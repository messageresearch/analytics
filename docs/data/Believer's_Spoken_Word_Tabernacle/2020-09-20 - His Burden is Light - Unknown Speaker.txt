is amen sing that next verse my family is sealed my family amen let's believe god now [Music] is over the victory is one my family let me comment on that verse [Music] when god made promise to abraham hallelujah there was not abraham had not even a child outside of ishmael he didn't even have he didn't even have a child ishmael wasn't even on the scene but god never intended ishmael but god said i will bring your seed into this land [Music] now you know a lot could have looked down there and you see everything going on and you think the battle is over the battle is the battle to believe as soon as faith is dropped it's done it's done as soon as faith is done it's dropped it's done yeah is that right you know you've heard it said from this pulpit before that brother andrew came along i don't know if it was this time or in july when he was here and and he he just came and he mentioned it as well he said go ahead and get the bible with their name on it and put it beside you on the pew amen [Music] but brother samuel i don't know if they belong get get that doubt out of your mind amen you claim the promise that's given to us they and their offspring shall be there with them [Applause] the battle is us looking beyond all circumstances and resting in god's promise all he told the philippian jailer believe and die and thy house shall be saved hallelujah faith unlocks the blessings of god amen now let's sing this again amen leaders brother bryant [Music] hallelujah glory for the battle is over the victory is mine [Music] this is the garden of gethsemane it's [Music] finished amen let's just let's just really entertain you let's enter in now it's already done oh yes [Music] it's already done amen do we give him a praise this morning [Music] amen hallelujah isn't it good to be a christian amen amen and it good to serve the lord amen amen amen god bless you i just let you have your seats for a few moments here um i had just a few things that i want to bring before you first of all i just want to say that we certainly want to thank you the mission offerings that had come in over the course of the sundays of those needs that we were trying to minister to there in the philippines um from different needs from the helping out of that that church building that was in palauan and where they were in need of funds to complete the project and there was about uh a thousand dollars is what they were in need of in order to complete that and uh that doesn't sound like maybe well it sounds like a lot to me but it probably don't seem like a lot compared to things we think about knowing the cost of things here but um the trade-off over there is is um obviously you know it's a over in other countries the american dollar is a precious thing and so they um you know they're able to to to purchase a little bit more things and obviously uh you know even the way that their their church building and how they would go about it that was that allowed them to be able to finish that uh to a place to be able to gather and to worship there so they've been doing that during this time of the covid because a lot of these things and perhaps some of you know this but really a lot of the things that we've experienced as far as we say you know inconveniences and that's really what it's been and you know and and when i say inconvenient you understand we things that we do we don't necessarily like doing them but we do them because it's you know certain things have been asked and certain things have been you know spoken in here and there so um they they themselves many of these places have not even been able to meet as a matter of fact brother roell and them when i spoke to you they were just getting ready to have their first in-person gathering again and that had been all my five months and some of the other places right now in other countries of the world they can't gather at all uh you know there's just i've been actually a brother had asked me to do a meeting i've got to do a meeting over streaming down into one of the other countries that had asked me to to minister and so i've got to do that you pray for me i told him just to give me the date because i'll have to preach at three in the morning in order to get to them so um and that's brother uh brian naidu from south africa and they had so i i just i said oh lord help me that at three three in the morning or something like that and may god help me that sunday morning when i have to stand here and preach amen but uh you know little things like this that you find out as you go along that my it just is a little bit of a it's a blessing you know little avenues you find out but there's nothing like being together with with saints of like precious faith there's nothing like getting together amen with believers and when the pillar of fire because more and more believers you get together you have licks of fire that are coming together and it's just something special about that and so we want to say thank you because the the offerings themselves of what had come in i think was around close to my mind serves me correctly around close to about twenty eight hundred dollars or what have you and we we just went ahead from the mission uh funds that are set there and thank you uh every month as you have been giving throughout the months toward the mission offerings that allows us to be able to when different needs would come up be able to put with that so we we put with that twenty eight hundred dollars and i i think i've rounded it up there we we we added with that incent an offering of four thousand dollars to brother roell soriano and that's that's going to go to feed because many of the people in their church have not been able to work so they're you know just doing all they can so thank you for that um the other thing that i want to do here this morning is um at times you know we we haven't altogether had different uh brothers and so forth you know that maybe have felt a burden on their heart and where we had to mention things in regards to an office in the church and we recognize that there are officers in the church and brothers who take on these burdens in their heart and it's not something that they do because they have to but it's something that that god puts in their heart i believe firmly that god works on both ends and so you know i want to just say it like this that at the request of the trustees when even when we had met in december and other things they had expressed their desire to see younger ones step up and carry the burden that they have faithfully carried and that was really a desire in their heart and so that some of them have carried this burden since the beginning of the assembly and so what i'd like to do is the trustee board along with myself i have recommended brother aaron bemet to serve this local body of believers in the office of trustee and uh we certainly thank the lord for brother aaron and his lovely family and um so we're thankful for what the lord has done within their lives and what god continues to do and as a couple you remember i think it was back in um it was back in december that seems like eons ago but that was 2019 maybe we can go to 2019 and skip to 2021 but uh because 2020 just been a blur hadn't it you know blur over top of the masks but we remember in december uh this is one of the the parts that um where there's a couple brother aaron sister amanda they took on that burden that brother bill and sister mary had carried so long uh with setting up the fellowship dinners and other events so we certainly think that they they uh about when they were getting into it then all this coveted 19 and everything else started in on us so um but i want to um after asking brother aaron to preferably consider this um he confided that even the burden the lord had already placed on his heart and that that's that's what i like to see is that god's already placed the burden on on the heart so we would like to present him to you this morning uh and and to take a vote on this and remember uh the vote itself it's not like it's not like what is a nation we're preparing to do in november uh but when we vote because a congregation elects its deacons trustees and a pastor and treasurer and so forth all of these things itself this is not that's political this is not political right the thing that a vote when we recognize what a vote is in the scripture when when the people already saw in david what was present they when they came to put the king the crown on david's head they said that was t that led us in and out of battle when saul was here see the only thing the vote was is they are a committing in confidence to the leadership of the lord so these are the things that we recognize as brother branham taught us that he said you know when a deacon a trustee a pastor you know they're voted in they serve until and he said if their one decides to step down uh every year the trustee or deacon you know if they and him decide that they want to step down they're more unable to at the end of that year and um you know and and so if they would desire to do that then then the deacons and trustees and they can you know who would they appoint who would they look at that would be a faithful uh brother to serve within that capacity and then we pray about that and look at it and so that's where we've come to here this morning and to bring brother aaron bema to present him before the congregation to serve in the office of a trustee so what i'm going to ask i'm not going to pass out paper ballots or anything like that i'm just going to ask you to bow your heads at this time if by your heads everyone young people all children and things like that i'd ask you to bow your heads and not only your heads but our hearts and as every member of this church that comes here regular and supports it with your tithe and offerings which is considered a member of this church while myself alone looks on i would ask if this church finds brother aaron beam it to be a just man and eligible by the best of their thinking to be a trustee to serve the local body here you will signify the same that you would agree that brother aaron is a just man eligible the best of your thinking to serve this body as a local as a trustee you signify this by the raising of your hand that i agree amen okay keep your heads about please uh if it would there be any that would be contrary put your hands down anybody that would be contrary to that okay all right god bless you raise your you can raise your heads there was only one no vote and that was sister amanda but your vote don't count sister man i'm just teasing just teasing amen so god bless you brother aaron amen i wonder if uh brother aaron if you'll come forward at this time i'd like to ask the other the trustee brothers if you'll come and um let's just we're going to have a word of prayer and we just want to brother bill come on brother and we just want to offer just a word of prayer deacons if you'll come to brother gomez brother richard we just want to offer a word of prayer we just so thankful to god for his mercy amen amen and so we just amen everybody love the lord amen and everybody happy amen praise the lord let's just get around brothers heavenly father lord as we lord lay our hands o god lord upon brother aaron father as a congregation and lord as lord your children dear god we recognize oh god that it takes you to put a burden within a heart lord the greatest lord lord reality that a person can ever know is to know you in the power of your resurrection and lord god i think lord is when you dealt with paul's life when you touched his life lord the thing that paul asked lord what would you have me do it was a burden in his heart god i believe that's something that reaches within our hearts lord as christians as believers we have a desire lord for what that grace that we have received lord and become partakers of we're not lord in debt but we just love you lord we want to serve you want to do all we can for you lord for your body for your people lord i pray that god you'll take brother aaron now lord as our brother is yielded lord dear god to that lord that you placed on his heart the lord the vote of the congregation and standing behind it in confidence and as we stand here lord god as the pastor of this assembly lord i ask your god that you would guide and direct him lord god father lord along the lord with the other brethren lord we pray lord we ask it in the name of jesus christ for the glory of god amen amen god bless you brother god amen here i don't praise the lord amen well let's stand amen amen well let's look into the word of the lord here this morning i want to go to matthew chapter 11 verse 28 and um just want to say these are things you probably realized after not just this past thursday but the thursday before we've been dealing with gifts of the mighty conqueror and then last thursday just just really the lord just pressing on my heart to bring these uh services these messages here and um we always want to be available to him and what the lord would have for us so we want to just continue to draw from where we've been looking here for the past few times we've ministered and just to look a little bit further here this morning on this thought on what a burden but i'd like to speak begin to speak on his burden is light so matthew 11 28 just ask you to pray for me and just pray as we're just looking into this here now come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light amen let's just bow our heads one more time amen who would have want to be remembered in prayer a need on your heart this morning god bless your hands amen lord jesus you lord are the same same god lord you know lord the needs lord among us this morning and lord we stand here lord in need of you lord that you would come and break the bread of life to our hearts may you lord just help us lord help me just to relax and lord help the congregation oh god we we just want to enter in lord we thank you for the songs lord of zion that was sung and just such a wonderful atmosphere to enter into oh god for the word to come forth lord we thank you for all you've done in our midst lord and all you're doing and we just lord turn our hearts to you now we ask that god you would just come just open your word to our hearts now lord make it plain deal with our lives in a special way we love you and thank you in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you as you're being seated in the patmos vision brother branham he takes this this scripture and he says how we receive this rest or the continuing sabbath is at the invitation of jesus no matter how long you've been laboring under your load of sin whether it's 10 years 30 years or 50 years or longer come with your tired weary life and you will find his rest the true sabbath jesus will give you rest think when brother branham went beyond the curtain of time and one of the first ones that would come to him you'd never know about how she looked in that body there was no trace of of death no trace of sin that is there in that body that body that that particular sister that came to him was just it was within the same age of even his little daughter sharon rose and remember the the the lord spoke to him at that time and said she was 90 years old when you let her to the lord you know that when you think of that woman and where she would have been and you think of her i think of where you know where the the the older uh gentleman was where brother branham went squirrel hunting and remember he was a proclaimed infidel he didn't believe in god and you know there's a lot of things he had seen that you know that have been just it brought skeptics i mean there's a lot of things we find that people now they say i don't want religion and i just tell you the truth like i told a man one time standing in panera i said i don't want religion neither because religion don't do no good religion's only a covering religion really don't deal with what the real issue is religion doesn't free you it binds you but but the word of god the holy ghost it sets you free and here the spirit of god moved down on the prophet and you know as you hear brother battlement tell that tell that particular instance with that gentleman who was standing there and he's looking and and brother banham takes under under the unction of the spirit of god and begins to preach jesus christ the living god and showing how god is identified in nature he takes that of the apple tree and to think he took that text and here that man could not deny it brought him in a place to recognize that the same god who is over and orchestrates all that in nature is the same god who healed that lady of cancer so it's the same god showing that he he is alive and and he is well and that person no matter how long that they've labored underneath that load of sin the weariness of it that they can be set free and so we thank god and we thank god this morning for that reality we thank god for the invitation that's given because the reality of the gospel does not push anybody away let me just tell you right now if there is any spirit any voice that tells you this is not for you right here i've just read in the scripture that's contrary to that voice you've got a right to call that voice a liar because when jesus came he said come unto me and that same jesus though not here in a corporal body but he's here in the body of his believers and that same call is going out even yet this morning come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and i will give you rest amen he didn't call us to a church he called us to himself amen and he said everyone defy everyone that the father has given me i i will in no ways cast out so right now when the enemy tells you well this isn't for you uh you know this isn't about you i look at your life he's trying to take circumstances and isolate you but you've got an authority you might say you don't know where i'm at in my life but to believe is an authority that renders the devil helpless you can stand on that word and say i've got a personal invitation amen in isaiah 28 verse 8 for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there is no place clean i don't think anybody would want to go to a table with vomit and filthiness on it the table is talking about teaching are you with me it's talking about teaching we're talking about teaching that that that wants to cover filthiness that wants to make allowances for filthiness that allows sin to continue on they just say well you know god loves you and god understands but that's not a table of the lord the table of the lord there is power amen amen in the sacrifice that has been offered our passover jesus christ to loosen you from sins hold amen amen the table of listen everyone when you look at the idols and you see these temples and you know i've been in other countries and you know that maybe you've seen them with pictures and stuff like that look every one of them places they bring in offerings sometimes they'll bring in nice cakes and food and everything else and they set them before that statue and that god and rats come around in there and they eat it all up when you look at it it allows them to continue in the life they're in it's not a bond it's a bondage it's not a liberty now when you bring that on down you might look at it and say well this is not a church where buddha is worshipped or this is worship but remember they in order to worship god is to worship him in spirit and in truth and the living god he never he never come that we would continue in our own burdens but that our burdens might be lifted whom look at this whom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make to understand doctrine them that are winged from the milk and drawn from the breast for precept look how look at this says for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line up online line upon line hear a little and they're a little you recognize that this scripture that it is speaking that there that that the channel there must be a true channel that is opened a true channel of the word that that people might come into that rest the preaching of the word let me just just try to you know bring this down it's the preaching of the gospel that brings jesus on the scene amen let me just say brother brown would say it like this over and over through the message he said we just don't need the preaching of the word we need the holy ghost we need the saith the lord that's what we need that's what we look forward to when we are coming here into these services we're not just coming to hear the preaching of the word we need something much greater than that we need thus saith the lord and god has given to you and i thus saith the lord in this hour hallelujah this word has power within it amen glory be to god and when the gospel is preached remember there's a lot of people that there were individuals will look for revival but remember you can't get revival outside of the word you can maybe get emotion where people get worked up in emotion but you cannot get true revival and revival is where the trash is cleaned out amen it's where lives are made clean and pure and then where god comes himself to live inside of that heart the preaching of the gospel is the channel of the word just like when david david wanted a revival he knew god had promised a revival he knew that the ark of the covenant it belonged back in jerusalem he knew the philistines had it but in order for that ark he knew it's got to come back to jerusalem but david consulted the captains of thousands he consulted the priest and remember when he did it got a man killed [Music] he had good motives are you with me he had good objectives but he was not following the pathway of the word and in order for revival to come for the rest to come for the holy ghost to come it comes according to the path of the word because jesus said he said he will send the holy ghost in my name and his name is his person his character his life being revealed [Music] this is what peter took up on the day of pentecost he began to preach what had been listen now what had been revealed he began to preach what had been revealed who it was that came out of the shadows out of the types and walked with them in luke 24. he began to preach that this this same jesus he began to preach that now notice when he when there was a request and a call god put a burden on peter's heart for that request they had looked for the coming of the holy ghost you realize the church they were posted in that hour they knew that with the coming of the messiah there would come forth the holy spirit you see it's not our minds cannot tie the scriptures together we don't even know where to go in the scripture unless the holy ghost would come and point us brother brown stands in the message the rapture and he's trying to express to the people in the opening about the message of the hour and you hear that term and he's saying well that's god what it is it's god's promise he's made for this hour he said see we wouldn't even know where to go in the scripture but you see he has led us to that place in the scripture that belongs to you and i you see a man cannot lead you there it takes the holy ghost god can work through a man but it takes the holy ghost to lead us to where our position i promise for this day to where you don't only look at it as that's a promise of god but when god starts dealing with your heart you say that's my promise that's my promise lord it be to god it becomes personal amen [Music] so it must be the word in order to bring word results bible results it's got to be the living word of god same thing when peter stood in the house of cornelius remember he was sent he was sent an angel came to cornelius and said go down here and there's one in there by the name simon a tanner i want you to sin for him he sent for him and peter when he came back in acts 10 he preached that jesus christ was indeed not only crucified but he arose he was the fulfillment of the prophecy you know what peter was doing he was setting before that not a historical event he was bringing them to the realization that what was done that god is here to make good on the debt that was paid he's present to release you from your burdens verse 11 for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to his people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith you may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear man i remember that weariness hallelujah i remember that i remember when i got i got weary i got tired i realized i couldn't help myself i realized that i needed him i didn't just need a church i needed him i needed to meet him i didn't even know how to articulate all that but it was a weariness the weariness is when you finally you come to your end when you come to your end when you're saying i can't make another step i'm tired of living this way i'm tired of going on this way i hope you're hearing me now don't just leave this for people who have not come into christ but that's for every one of our lives if there's anything where the enemy has tried to vet you or put anything upon your life you've got to come to a place to say i'm tired of this hallelujah and this is the rest the rest wherewith you may cause the weary to rest the faint be exhausted it's like trying to save somebody who's drowning one time in the swimming pool i almost drowned i didn't realize i you know they one of the first times i went swimming and i was out at my uh mamaw browning's house down there in salina and you know i've been going around the pool on the float and i was only four foot pools but you know i was shorter than four foot at the time and i remember when i jumped out there and one of the one of the young boys he pulled that that float away and well i went i wasn't i wasn't coming up i remember all the you know it was just a scare it was a things but everything took place so quick and then i remember when they pulled me up out of that water and got me over there on the side and and you know but many times you hear when people are drowning sometimes people they're fighting i mean they're fighting when they're drowning they're trying to and somebody has to tell them calm down just do what i tell you to do i mean when they're trying to help you it seems like you're still going down but if you just rest and you just trust them they'll get you to safety that's the same way that jesus does it all right blood picks it up and he says here it is prophesied right here in isaiah and it came to pass about 700 years later at pentecost when they were all filled with the holy ghost exactly as they said it would be this is the true sabbath that was promised thus when they were filled with the holy ghost they ceased from their worldly works their worldly doings their evil ways and the holy ghost took charge of their lives they entered into rest there is your rest that is your sabbath it's not a day it's not a year but the eternity of being filled and blessed in the holy spirit it is you ceasing and god doing it is god in you willing and doing of his own good pleasure so we recognize that within it as we are looking at it that the rest itself is speaking of the true baptism of the holy ghost it comes with the resurrection power to bring full deliverance in a life to bring a translating from death unto life from darkness into light amen it is it is god's power moving upon that life and that individual it's where all things pass away the old man dies and you cease from your worldly works it's the creation of god taking place within you you know when jesus here as it speaks in the book of revelations he said behold i make all things anew there's no way you and i cannot make ourselves anew we can try to patch ourselves up and we'll have to stop doing this or quit doing that but it it wasn't what we could do it wasn't that we laid around limp but it we recognize that it's not no more else getting our eyes on ourselves but it's recognizing of the one who is dealing with our lives standing in our midst that he's the one that said behold i will make all things anew it's his working so this rest remembers we're looking at because i know some of you have connections and you know we know the seventh day and or or jehovah witness and we have all these different ones you have you know sabbatarians and seventh-day adventists and different ones and they want to hang on to that seventh day not recognizing that that was a type it was a type that was given to a specific group of people the israelites it was that which god had told them you are to set aside the seventh day it's to be a sign between me and you and what it was god provided all they had need of within the six days they didn't have to labor on the seventh day and they were able to observe that rest uh at that time and we wrote that was only that was only a type god was showing that it was it was to show a memorial of what god had done there in creation he entered into his rest the works of god being finished there on the seventh day it was only a time it was only a shadow to show that indeed there would come indeed a place there would be a land that would be provided and made available there would be a people there would be a day that that there would be a people that would really come into a rest not just one day out of the week but would really come into a rest where you enter into this rest of the holy ghost the person of jesus christ and you're never going out anymore the the things of the world have passed away amen amen amen this rest that we're talking about which this is the holy ghost this rest is your inheritance it's the inheritance that jesus came to bring us to remember our inheritance was given to us before the foundation of the world hallelujah and jesus came god came down and it became flesh in order to bring us to our inheritance i just want you to follow me now he came he became flesh he took the word upon himself that he might pay the price and that he might lead us into our inheritance after he had raised when he appeared to them he spoke to them letting know the scriptures the word that had been fulfilled and then the word that had been fulfilled revealed and vindicated in that hour he told them go wait in jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high it wasn't enough that they knew the revelation yes amen they had to knew the author of the book amen the same god that fulfilled it through the body of jesus christ he was gonna continue his work through a many member body it would no longer it wouldn't be peter's strength it wouldn't be paul's strength it wouldn't be andrew's strength it would be the strength of almighty god fulfilling his word through their lives so much so that they took knowledge that peter and james they were ignorant but the bible says they took knowledge they had been with jesus it wasn't because they carried the scrolls like jesus come on now it wasn't because they had the same button belt buckle are you with me it was because the life the expression the image that had been reflected through the life of the messiah was now reflected through the messiahs it came like joshua to bring us into that place it's our position this rest is our position it's where the things that god has placed listen every seed if you take an apple tree every leaf every fruit all that will ever be is in it right then it looks real small but it's already in it what does it have to do it has to get planted and this is why when the holy ghost has come it's the holy ghost that brings a real planting in our life he releases that germ that's there in that seed on the inside every leaf every piece of fruit all those things it all begins to come out in his time in his season in his presence it's him it's getting in that position it's your place of authority they did not when they were in the wilderness in their journey that was not their position that was not the place of authority but they were going somewhere hallelujah are you with me so you're here this morning you just get it set in your heart i'm going somewhere i'm not just here rambling around there's a clear vision that's set before me i'm not just here taking up space i'm going somewhere amen hallelujah i've got a purpose for being here this morning i've got a purpose in everything that i'm going somewhere [Music] it's the place of adoption and spiritual blessings and that is that is only in jesus christ isaiah 11 10 it says in that day there shall be a root of jesse which shall stand for an ensign of the people to it shall the gentiles seek and his rest shall be glorious amen the root of jesse he what's which is before before all things by whom all things consist he which was before and he he alone there will be the end sign and the word ensign means that of the standard it's a rallying point no doubt many of us you know we've seen these banners or you've seen flags where you know uh different ones uh you know brother carlos you're familiar with that and there were brothers who were in the arm of forces brother dave you had one over your battalion or you know when those are in the civil war if we look back into that or or you know and and a revolutionary war and we look at it that that's that flag they had what they called a flag bearer the flag bearer did not necessarily carry a gun but he had an important duty and that was to carry the flag where the flag was at that's where the leader was at when the battle got hot and happy and and pressures were coming and they were fighting they had received orders right here is where we want you to launch the attack but you know sometimes in the midst of battle you can get kind of turned around and you kind of lose your bearings because you're so locked in on that of the battle but you know there would be a flag of your uh platoon or battalion that would be lifted up in your eyes oh help me preach now it would do you no good to look at your feet you had to lift up your head you had to look for that flag because there was somebody who was holding that flag and that flag was a rallying point where they could see that flag was raised high it was something about it that would give courage in those men to know our flag is going on let me just tell you something when the devil tried to take away the flag the life of jesus christ the name of jesus christ from the church of the living god god in this hour as he had promised he sent that of his word in this hour that god through the prophet would hold up that standard of the flag when you and i didn't know where to go what is right where do we go there who was exalted jesus christ and that's why this morning he is still exalted in his church he said if i be lifted up i will draw men unto me it's a living word of god the person of jesus christ that young man but brother brown talks about that french soldier he was on a train right right they had sent letters to their parents can anybody claim you know can they claim different is one of your sons here hallelujah these boys had amnesia the war had shocked them let me just say this to you those that have been in war and different things and seen sometimes it's not even war sometimes people have seen things in life a body or whatever more you weren't meant to see that right you weren't meant to see that you remember that from that training they told you you're somewhere you got to try to flip flip the switch in your mind we're not meant to see that all right are you with me but to think the shock of war let me just tell you something one of the greatest shocks that's greater than any shock of war was the shock of sin because it was through that fall that man forgot who he was he didn't know who he was but in that time when that stop was made there they noticed that boy got off that train when he got off the train the guy who's the guard you know you got to watch him he got to noticing when this boy got off the train he started looking around hallelujah and he noticed as he looked around he thought i'm just going to follow him see where he goes that that boy he started walking and so that that man began to follow him what he found was filed him up a little hill down this little path and he said he came and he said when he got up there he said he noticed here come this old man running out on a porch and he said my son they told me you were dead but i knew you'd come back home [Music] what was it that that man saw he saw something that was familiar brother said it was a water tower this is why there's only there's one water power there's one reality there's one person that is to be exalted that can bring sons back home and that is jesus christ amen that's what the word of god does it reveals jesus christ not to be a creed not to be a dogma but to be the living god it is the pathway back home it's what sons and daughters say that's what i've been longing for he might have had a train ticket to the asylum but it wasn't fulfilled amen hallelujah his train ride was interrupted help me preach now amen many of our lives we can go right through here we were on train rides you might be on a train ride this morning but the same one that interrupted a pair by revealing himself is the same one that comes and he interrupts our lives hallelujah the same god that will interrupt nature under the sixth seal is the same god that interrupts the course of nature in our lives by what by the word amen hallelujah glory be to god in the highest amen this is why he is our portion amen that's why paul in hebrews 4 he would exhort the believer to be diligent to enter into his rest labor he uses the word labor is to be diligent to to let enter in to that rest which is to be birthed into the word of the living god amen it's where we we in the word become one i want you to look at this here in hebrews 12 1 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about was so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which death so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us how they're going to do that looking unto jesus amen amen simple but what you got to lay aside look to him he gives you strength to lay it aside quit looking at it lay it aside [Applause] looking unto jesus help me read this next part the author and finisher of our faith who's the author of your faith jesus amen who's the finisher of your faith jesus glory be to god hallelujah who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and it sat down at the right hand of the throne of god let me just tell you something this speaks of our life as believers to catch a vision of that word oh it's true before our lives were surrendered to god anybody remember when god first lifted the load of sin from your life all hell was turned against you you begin to have everybody saying everything against you paul said you endured a great flight of afflictions but the bible says in isaiah 63 9 he said in all of their afflictions he was afflicted and he saved them by the angel of his presence let me just tell you something you're not in this alone with god brought him out of egypt he was there with them [Applause] this is why no matter what the skeptics and scoffers and everything else to come around your life you can say i'm going somewhere [Applause] i don't delight in being ridiculed or this or that nobody does but you see there's a vision that's set before you there's a promise that you know that it's not just a promise of god but it's your promise and god is calling you into that promise if you'll just look unto him because he is that promise for consider him that endured you catching those words endured hallelujah such contradiction of sinners against himself lest you be weary and faint in your minds listen jesus didn't only have the devils telling him if you're the son of god do this if you're the son of god do this then his brethren john 7. no man to have gift like this just sits around and don't show it publicly then he had that of the religion said you know what you got a black mark on your life you ain't who you say you are you're a drunken roman soldier son [Music] but jesus knew who he was amen i know this is very simple but the devil doesn't hold the mystery of your life all he remembers is that snare that entanglement and the life that was there he doesn't know that there's a real son and daughter of god on the inside thank you that's good amen look at somebody next to you and say lay it aside remember the son of man is the lord of the sabbath amen the son of man is the word made flesh it's god's word a promise that he made that is now taken upon flesh malachi 4 has come and gone amen brother branham had his part god had his part brother branham had his part and now that the messenger is passed off the scene that same god is fulfilling the word that he made real and the promise to you and i in this generation it's the same god who is present bringing his word to pass hallelujah amen they can say everything they want to say about this message but i'm living proof of it brother i needed this message this message ain't books and tights it's jesus christ i needed this a church couldn't do it i needed this message sometimes some of the nonsense i've heard where people say well we've got to get people to christ first how in the world do you get people to christ the message is not theology like well once you get to jesus then you know then we'll give you the message how do you know who he is unless he has been revealed to you in this hour that's a lie from the pits of hell it's satan's intent to try to take people away from a living reality the message of the hour reveals him to be the same yesterday [Applause] he is the inside that's been lifted up amen he's the rallying point amen hallelujah but the man told us he said i'm not god's gift he said the holy ghost is god's gift god used flesh come on that's saying listen to me don't put that back there on the prophet that same god is using your flesh [Applause] when brother adam talked about applying the token for your house he said let him see it in you glory amen but one catch on the tape won't catch them but a living reality of jesus christ in your life what's it like it's like the water tower listen you don't know where my kids are at they're out doing all this and doing all that but yeah when they get sick who they call them [Music] tell me now when everything starts going wrong you got family members and water more why don't they go and take it to their church i'm not saying that sarcastically you want to know why because they know what they're at is a social club they know there ain't no power there let's just say it let's just say like it is they know there ain't no power there they know there ain't no authority there i'm gonna go ahead and preach in hell when god when the chastening and the trying of job was over god not only had to wear that that that repression was lifted from job when he could pray for his friends but when god was able to stand there and rebuke those men build that and life fast and different ones he said now you go get an offering and offer it up and you come to job and you let job pray for you when abamelec was getting ready to take sarah it didn't change that abraham was still his prophet you might look at yourself and say they would come to me they're not trusting in your flesh but they know there's a living god that's there it's not your work it's a living presence of a living god there's a great storm outside sunny we're christian but mama in a storm like this i want a god with skin [Applause] that's what i'm looking at god with skin on what was once mean old badgers oh you might not have done everything else in the world brother saying i didn't do this and i didn't do that i was raised in a in a message church but god had to get that old meanness of pride amen that old goody two shoes like your own righteousness did something for you god had to let you know you needed the grace of god just as much as the drunkard or the dope addict or the prostitute got it let you know you need my grace [Applause] there's a need remember we were looking at this about the sabbath day there's a need amen they were wanting to accuse jesus of all these things all your disciples put corn on the sabbath day you're healing people on the sabbath day ah they're getting up and taking up their bed and walking they failed to recognize what was being done was not the own works of the people there was a need in their life and the son of man the word he who gave the sabbath was there to release burdens on the sabbath amen what were the people doing when he said rise up take up that bed and walk it was not their work he won their work what was happening they were tapping in to the vision of the word brother let me just say like this don't don't try to put it out there just stay with me now don't try to put it out there it ain't something far out there or some mysticism it was the simplicity where they were dialed into the word and the word just took a hold of their life and and they forgot all of their doubts and unbelief he was cast out and what did they do they oh they obeyed the word and they rose up and they walked amen remember they wanted to accuse jesus and jesus response was the father worketh and i work hitherto amen what i see the son do what i see the father doing that doeth the son likewise they were looking at everything in works based but what they failed to recognize that it is god revealing himself that actually is to set the works in motion and the works are not not that of where we're trying to do something it is yielding in obedience to his voice it's just as simple as the as the ox gold was laying there god got directed shamgar at that moment shamgar didn't have time to go get you know britannica encyclopedia and look it up and say well i wonder how this will work he'd have time for that inspiration comes not for you and i have to explain it inspiration comes to put us in motion [Music] so brother brown would tell us over and over he said obey the pulsation of the holy ghost amen sometimes the very things you can think are silly is the very thing god it will use the bible tells us here in luke 5 5 it speaks you you younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble how many say help me lord amen humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god remember in his power in his right in his right hand in the mighty hand of god there is power amen there is blessing this is where the seven stars come from or the power of the god has behind it everything all that he is the bible says they got not the land by their own sword but they got it by thy right arm and thy right hand humble yourselves under the mighty hand of god humble yourselves under come under the mighty hand of god remember when it was time for the rain to come the god had spoke through elijah when he sent his servant on the mountain remember the response was he said i see a cloud and the cloud is like that of a man's hand are you with me it was a man's hand when when elisha was all distraught i mean he was upset man you know he you know jehoshaphat and them had asked for him and uh uh the king you know that was there at that time and then king i think was ahab but if i'm not mistaken uh he they were there remember elisha comes up there and said if it wasn't for jehoshaphat i wouldn't even be such love i wouldn't even be here but what happened a minstrel came and the bible says the hand of the lord came upon him amen god's delivering hand has come upon this generation his word his word his presence notice why that he might exalt you in due time casting all your care all your anxieties all your worries all your worries all your frustrations casting them casting them casting all your cares all your burdens cast them on him because he cares for you no doubt every one of us you've heard this i guess we say it's an old proverb brother branham called it a god dishonoring proverb brethren said that gold god dishonoring proverb is god helps those who help themselves remember bran said how ridiculous god helps those who can't help themselves remember it was a pharisees and that day they were righteous jesus said they who are well don't need a physician but there were others who needed a physician [Music] they needed healing amen you're in a good place this morning satan's power is limited god's power isn't limited god's power is not limited it's the same power of god that brought the trees brought the flowers brought this earth the same power of god it's the same power of god that has led you to where you're at this morning i mean who in the world goes and tells the geese hey y'all get ready you know hey you know they're getting ready for you down louisiana and you know the rice patty hey you know you've got to be getting man look at it i mean you know the weather forecast over here you guys are getting together they don't need that right the ducks don't need our help the birds don't need our help [Applause] there amen an instinct and i like how brother branham said it he said science calls it instinct but i call it god who is it that tells them of the great herbs of the caribou and other things who tells the salmon it's time to migrate it's time to get back to the homeland it's time to get back to the bedding grounds who is it it is the power of god that speaks to their heart brother they don't try to fight it they just obey it on the way back yeah there's many that die but brother those that die they're on their way back they're headed in the right direction amen he's made a way he's made a way he is that way amen many times what keeps the blessings of god away is a lack of true repentance which is a true confession the angel of the lord told the prophet he was so burdened and he told the prophet he said before them people come in the prayer line brethren preaches this and he that's in you when they come in that prayer line he said you have them before they get in there have them confess their wrongs you know what why repentance and confession it is goes hand in hand because what god has brought conviction in your life it's the word right when the word listen uh just the word alone won't do that it has to be the living word to bring conviction in that life and don't just write it off of well you know this is just some little habit call it a devil identify what it is call it what it is and say god i'm wrong i need deliverance i need help amen well this is something i'll carry with me you know all along you know my family had it my son and my dad had it quit glorifying the devil look to the other family tree a natural tree it got a lot of strings in it all right oh i know everybody likes to look at their family tree like their family tree is the ultimate it's as rotten as cankered as everything else i know there's good people and everything else but let me tell you something it don't matter what you think about your tree there is one tree that is truly the tree of life and that is jesus christ well how do i get that cry out to him amen he is your help he'll do for you what's impossible amen can i have just a few more moments we only have one service today we might as well make it two in one remember jesus what he told many of the disciples who were following him at the time he the 70 and many he looked at him and he said if you'll continue in my word ye shall be my disciples indeed he told them you're going you'll know the truth you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free even talking about some truth he wasn't talking about a letter these are people who knew that the law the prophets the psalms the writings they knew it was the truth there were many that looked at him and said truly but he wasn't just talking about what they could see he was talking about they would have a personal experience with the truth which is him the word the holy ghost the spirit of truth brings out the truth of who you really are the spirit of truth reveals the seals it takes the seals off of your life it pushes back the darkness of your life what does that the spirit of truth he said i am the truth the way and the life [Applause] what did he say continue yes amen here's what they said we're abraham's seed we ain't never been in bondage what a sad sad lie that the devil had told them they thought they were free they didn't realize go on the outside remember on the listen to me now on the outside everything was pristine it would seem all on the outside oh my this is the real token everything's just so perfect so and so so perfect brother so and so so perfect look at how everything is it's just right it's one inch from the floor listen i believe the real holy ghost on the inside of a person either reflect itself to the outside but there but there is a holiness there is a holiness of the holy ghost that produces a holy dress are you with me it produces a holiness of heart and life and spirit all right are you with me amen i mean you know what i mean you can you can take people who have long hair and wear a long dress and one or more they're mean as a snake they can look the part in everything else and strip you down and cut you out and dice you out and everything else that ain't the holy ghost amen i need the holy ghost as much as people want to rip down with emotion and this and then that is that's true and the plum line also says that you can have the brandon will say just like this you can have he said the long hair and the long dressers and they've got tempers to fight blood sauce tongues that are longer than their hair well my my mama go ahead what are you talking about i'm talking about when the life of jesus christ it comes on the inside it produces a character of his life it changes your desires you want to walk pleasing to him that's why your dress changes your attitude changes and you find as things go on in your life little things you might be inclined in this area he's working in your life and you find things in your life just fleeing away what's happening you're aligning with the word that you're united with and satan's holds being removed that's why jesus said whosoever committed sin practicer is a servant of sin brought in bondage to it the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth forever if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed when jesus stood here remember what was delivered to him was the scroll when he entered into the synagogue the bible tells us that when he found he opened the book and he opened the book and he found the place where it was written i want you to just look at this they gave him the scroll and remember with the scroll it's not like our bibles they gave him that scroll of isaiah but the spirit that was upon him directed him to the place that was written for that hour for what was to be fulfilled in that hour he found the place that is written can i preach you might have been a bible reader all your life but when the spirit of god has come upon your life and that revelation begins to break forth in your life what does it do it guides you to the place that is written of you amen and this is what he said the spirit of the lord is upon me he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor sent me to heal the brokenhearted preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord he was coming with a person with a purpose the acceptable year is to bring a release a release to the poor the brokenhearted the captive he's coming to deal with things that are holding his people and it's going to be proclaimed to preach the acceptable year of the lord you know remember you know the brother brown would get in this sometimes the discussion would come up you know the catholic church said well you know we're the original church and they say you know well you know god gave the authority to the church to remit sins brother branson said he did yeah he said they you know god gave the authority now see they're pulling from scripture out of matthew 16. jesus and brother brown said like this he said i'll go along with you on that scripture if you do it the bible way remember i'm talking about all tables are full of filthiness and vomit you see the way the the the way and written it called a denominational way because denomination are gates that close off the presence of god are you with me they they shut out the friends of god who actually is the one that they need in their midst to bring deliverance but remember he doesn't come outside of the word he comes in the form of his word amen amen the revelation it prevails what does it do that revelation that reveals jesus christ to be the same yesterday today and forever amen how was sins remitted when peter preached he says repent are you with me repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ let me just say it to you very clearly if you repented baptism goes with repentance amen hallelujah what god deals with the heart don't let not stand in your way listen myself i was baptized again from when i first started walking with god you know i'm talking about when i was you know i was 13 years old man i was 10 years old and you know i did i have to be baptized again no i didn't but i recognized right at that point when god had dealt with my life as a 19 year old boy i really right now i know what i'm doing i know who i'm identifying with there was things at that time and there was business there was things that god was dealing with my heart i don't know how many that even right now since i've been pastor we baptized again different ones that call me up brother samuel i i was baptized when i was a young boy but god has dealt with my heart and i really know what i'm doing now i know where i'm standing at i want to be baptized again listen it was something that when you look at it you want to have confidence in your walk with god i'm not saying you have to but i'm saying if you've never been baptized in the name of jesus christ i adore you by the scripture be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost hallelujah this is god's promise amen amen this is a real remission of sins where the holy ghost comes down that's why brother branham he's standing there he's preaching brother braham is trying to show the congregation the authority of the word in the message end time seed sign he tells it he came into a meeting at the church there in the tabernacle they had told brother branham you know this young lady was on a cot and she couldn't get off that cot she was she was just sick she was real bad brother brandon said to prove something to my church he said i never touched that child i went straight to the pulpit he said i preached the word hallelujah now let me just tell you what the preaching of the word does you already know it changes the atmosphere in the beginning you go back to genesis 1. darkness was all around is that right and god said let there be light and the spirit of god begin to move the spirit follows the word amen hallelujah this is why jesus when he said if any man love me he will keep my saints amen and we will come and make our abode in you it's genesis 1. the word is spoken and the spirit of god comes to perform that word hallelujah glory be to god brother ram said as i stood there and i preached he said he said you know he said to think that child was bound for a premature grave and the word instantly healed her understand brother brown ain't trying to start another doctrine here but he was trying to get the people to see the power that's in the revealed word of the hour because it's not a man's word every time when i'm standing right here i'm waiting on him to come i'm waiting on him to come and the anointing to move down and for him to start bringing the word together sometimes i sit right back there in that office or other places and counseling or whatever more i don't enter in with the agenda i just wait try to be available oh my sometimes waiting and just listening and just listening but oh my you don't know what a comfort it is when all of a sudden i know that he's come here oh my it's at that time man i mean when you're in that moment right there there ain't a devil can lift its head and what i'm trying to say that ain't just for me that's for you as believers it isn't how you feel it's the power of that word because it's not you that's saying it it's the deity of god the holy ghost [Applause] hallelujah if you say to this mountain amen if you say to this mountain be thou removed blessed be the lord very simple brother brown says the word went forth and she believed the word and the word is god's life and god's power and the word is what does it mean he said he is the word and when you receive the word you receive jesus for he is the word and the word is made flesh and dwelt among us he never said do you see it or do you feel it do you believe it as you believe that word has that words coming forth cast aside every imagination cast aside every doubt cast aside every line spirit cast aside every voice that speaks contrary and just let the word speak to your heart what are you doing i'm looking unto jesus and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty amen hallelujah there is liberty liberty that sounds forth to your heart freedom freedom his burden is light yes it is to serve the lord is not a burden if it's burdensome if it's a drudgery why don't you trade that out smile if it's a burden to live right trade that out you you don't have his burden his burden is light you can't live his word by your own life it has to be his life inside of you and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty now remember he's the lord of the sabbath are you with me when that sounding would go forth across israel there were many of them remember they were sold as they were sons sons but a debt had come up and they had to you know go pay or work off that debt but when the time of jubilee was come this wasn't just a seventh year this was the jubilee this is when all debts were settled because you remember on the seventh year there was seven sabbath on the seventh year everybody was free to go for that year but then they had to return back are you with me this is the jubilee that's what the rest of the holy ghost is it's a jubilee it's where debts are released it's where burdens are lifted it's where all that was against you is struck off never to be brought up in me amen man walking was a cot told you who told you take that cotton start carrying it around the same same one who healed my eyes the same one who gave me eyeballs the same one and put that paste upon my where eyeballs were at who told you to do that the one who put clay upon my eyes the one who gave me my sight the man at the pool of bethesda who was laying there for 38 years with an infirmity are you hearing me brother braham said that that man would have lived to you know an old age that wasn't a prayer it wasn't a pressing issue as far as maybe like cancer or something else but do you realize god came down and i believe that's for me and you to show you and me that no matter how what we would look at like well i can live with this i i've been living with her for 38 years but jesus comes down and says you don't have to live a 38 and a half or 38 and 38 after 39 you don't have to live with it no longer amen who does that the lord of the sabbath the son of man the word made flesh who told you to do that jesus amen they took counsel how they could kill him that's the bible what they failed to recognize there was a need these people were in need amen here's a woman you know this from the sabbath here's a woman she's been bent over i can't now there's been some times in my life from my back some of you know the deal with back things i mean you don't want to cough you don't want to sneeze laugh nothing because everything hurts it's just radiating and i know some of you had a lot of things a lot worse than that but i'll tell you god brings them things back to your memory it humbles you she was all bound over she was looking her face her everything was she was she was cast over but here jesus notice what he does listen the word speaks to her and says woman thou art loosed from thy infirmity she couldn't stand up straight he said woman you're loose from your infirmity then he walked over and he laid his hands on her and immediately she straightened out why he is the lord of the sabbath i say that's why the reality that that here in the evening time it's revealed that jesus is not the second person of the godhead but it is the same almighty god the same jesus yesterday today and forever hallelujah this was a bondage that was upon her life the devil had her bound she was a daughter of abraham but this infirmity this affliction jesus said that the devil has put up on her bound her so she couldn't even walk right that day was her day i don't know what was in her heart that morning i don't know but i know one thing that that day was her day the faith that she needed in order to boost her faith to be able to straighten out to be able to stand upright it came to her that day and the burden that she was under was lifted i'm not here just taking time we're not here just taking time there was a man with the dropsy that didn't mean he couldn't hold on to things that's edema for you you know you you uh nurses and different things like that water retention like from kidney failure from heart uh heart failure congestive heart failure he had the dropsy and jesus came the situation that he was in but jesus came and released that build up on his life oh my god what was water he was holding he was holding water you were a man he wasn't meant to hold that water let me just tell you something there's a lot of things now preach with me there are a lot of things even in your christian journey you can accumulate a lot of stuff there's a lot of things that can start building up in your life you can get hurts built up you can let condemnation build up a lot of things start building up that doesn't allow you to operate right but jesus comes and he says lay it aside lay it aside cast it down let me read this to you in closing this is simple and i'm not making light of that but i want you to understand the simplicity satan wants to try to corrupt the simplicity in the seal of the antichrist he can go freely talking about when that one who's in bondage hears the sound of the trumpet there's no price to pay there's nothing to go through with how do you do it brother branham just drop your hope whatever you're working with and come lovely and take your freedom free i think brother andrew demonstrated to hear you here last week drop yes don't reason it drop it drop it and come take your freedom free there's not a thing you have to do brother branham will i have to be done this way or done that way you don't have to do nothing you have to accept it just say lord jesus i'm so thankful that you've brought freedom to me that you took me out of the bondage of a whirling mind that i didn't know where i was at i tried i joined different churches i went from place to place i tried to get right i didn't know what to do but now i'm coming on the basis that you died in my stead and i'm accepting you right now as my savior watch how the love of god will sway down into your heart peace that passes all understanding will soothe over i don't care what my neighbor says you'll love him anyhow i'm telling you his burden is light that's true if you're carrying a burden today you might be sealed away with god in his presence but if you're carrying a burden release it let's say brother branham speaks to a man in 1964. i don't know exactly what the man was was holding but the spirit of god calls him out and he says sir he said you've got to let the past in the past he said you're a minister of the gospel he said if you don't let that go it's going to cause a nervous breakdown he said but you've got to let it go in the name of jesus christ hallelujah it might have been a sickness that's come up on your way what do i do let it go that means put it in his hands committed to god like the man you might say well you know i could live with this i i've been going on okay but why not but who says that you're to continue on with it i say today's the day today's the day today is the day when it when it when it rains it raises within your heart to say enough is enough and let the word have free course satan has no place here he has no place in hearts he's a liar let me just tell you something right now he is fearful of the word taking hold he knows when believers begin to believe he trembles he can't stand in the presence of the holy ghost his burden is light yes weights there's not one person here not one of us here there's all throughout here we could go along and long and ask people you know and i think many times even individuals that i become more aware of it now you know sometimes the older you get and i know i'm still a young boy but sometimes when the older you get you begin to have a little bit more uh not that you had disrespect but you begin to have more respect for those who are even older knowing battles they've had to go through knowing how many times they've had to lay it lay aside things people have said this or this has been said or i've been done wrong here i've been done and they've had to you know what in order to move on with god they've had to lay aside that weight they had to lay it aside because they ain't doing nothing good it's weighing them down sometimes a person can carry a weight in their life for years and they don't need to carry it maybe it's a ruined relationship maybe it's a it's a broken thing you know but i'm among family and everything else and they'll carry that weight instead of giving it to the lord jesus and remember he didn't say i'll come and take it he said lay it aside it's that simple right it's to lay it aside as brother branham in that prayer i just read to you he said lord i accept that freedom you've got sickness lord i accept my healing his burden is light let's pray lord jesus freedom is here lord the time of burdens to be released is here lord jesus our faith and our confidence it's in you it's not the man who has his hands upon us and prays for us our faith is in you that's where we receive what it is we have need the lord i pray here this morning you're the lovely one that's here in our midst i pray right now lord that god for every hole that's present if there's a heart that desires to be set free a life lord whether it be the bondage of sin whether it be lord that in their life lord condemnation that they're carrying lord of sickness dear god your burden is light lord i pray that right now may they accept that and in their heart as you took brother branham lord and would express that back to a heart that's asking what do i have to do if that heart just can raise within and say lord i thank you for the freedom you've given me i thank you lord for delivering me of a whirling mind i thank you lord for making real to me yourself lord i thank you lord god lord that i can see you lord i thank you o god that you're making clear in my heart overriding every doubt and every fear lord that i am your child i've always belonged to you i'm yours lord lord i ask right now in the name of jesus christ that god for every heart aligned with your presence [Music] dear god every horde every addiction every unclean spirit every every sickness that the devil lord has put upon your people satan in the name of jesus christ you don't have to obey my word but you have to obey the word of the one i represent [Music] and in the name of jesus christ take your filthy hands off in the name of jesus christ grant it lord for your glory hearts

lamb i'm redeemed by the blood of the lamb oh blessed be the name of the lord let's stand i've been redeemed by the blood of the lamb or i'm redeemed filled with the holy ghost i am all of my sins are you the one knows that song all of my sins are under the blood i've been redeemed you know that song wow nobody knows it oh my is this no that's not the one well let's just sing just sing sing what's

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] he is our peace he is our peace who has broken down every wall oh here [Music] cares on him hallelujah he is [Music] you know brother branham tells a little simple story when they took a prayer cloth to a a little older german sister and they they took that prayer cloth to her house and [Music] and they you know had prayed over it and they gave it to her i came here with the sickness she was suffering with cancer or whatever it was but she she pinned that that that that little prayer cloth right there on on her uh on her garment and when she she pinned it on there brother brandon said what she spoke at that time she said all right mr devil it's time for you to leave i don't got time for you no more you might as well go on out of here it was just that simple just to apply that god stands behind his word if you're standing on his word everything is clear but the same you know how do i know if everything's clear if your heart don't condemn you and let me just tell you something if you confessed if you repented there ain't no condemnation now the devil might try to come and say this and say that and put that but when it has been repented of and confessed that's only the devil trying to bluff you you can stand right there on god's word because you know from the desire of your heart it's lined up with god see the spirit of truth it lines up then you can stand right there and like that old little german sister all right mr devil we don't have time for you no more get out of here that's the authority of this word how many times brother branham would as he would say anyone brother branham saying it but he knew by experience and the holy spirit would declare it you'll find this in a certain day you'll find this happen in a certain time you'll see the results from this [Music] i think of one sister brother branham prayed for it was one that that they knew 18 months later she received her healing but the holy spirit had told her go and the lord you'll find your healing he prayed for you see the word was certain what god has spoken it's certain the word is a seed you take it in your heart i didn't feel anything it ain't about what you feel are you with me you can have a lot of good feelings but after all the feelings has the word been planted the word that's been planted now you've got to water it [Music] how do i water it with praise and thanksgiving [Music] it's been planted i the lord have planted and i the lord will raise it up amen do you believe that this morning [Music] god is he's faithful amen amen let's just bow our heads amen dear lord jesus [Music] i ask lord god that as we lord would go from the presence of one another we leave lord from this building but not from your presence i pray that dear god the lord as hearts have lord been lord committed to you needs have been laid at your feet lives oh god turned over to you i pray oh god may even lord as they return back to their homes and their places your god may you who sounded that liberty who let them know my burden is light may the lord god find that and delight in the burden of the lord lord throughout the week throughout the days god our hearts are set with a full expectation it's a certainty lord you have sounded to our hearts [Music] in the name of jesus christ for your glory we ask these things now lord in jesus name amen amen god bless you this morning we'll that shall be dismissed in the name of the [Music] his lord oh yes oh yes i'm a child of the king his rose [Music] [Music] wretched and poor and lonely within but with one compassion for the king of all kings in pity and love he took me under his wing and oh yes oh yes i'm a child of the king i know his royal blood it now flows through my veins and i who was wretched and poor now can sing praise god praise god [Music] i'm a child
