[7:36] with I guess I got two testimonies
[7:38] because uh I don't know if you've seen
[7:40] the flooding and such down in Tennessee
[7:42] but my cousin that goes down to brother
[7:44] Donnie Reagan's uh was one of the uh
[7:47] members that was rescued on top of the
[7:49] hospital he said that the water was up
[7:51] at like 75 ft at some places and uh by
[7:55] the time he got rescued it was about 2T
[7:57] from the top of the roof of the hospital
[7:59] and he had airlifted by a helicopter so
[8:03] um I'm just thankful for that and uh
[8:06] afterwards uh the CEO or or whatever the
[8:11] hospital that uh is a uh just open
[8:15] atheist um had uh told my told my
[8:18] cousins that to gather all the hospital
[8:20] staff and uh to say a prayer you know
[8:24] and said he just felt the presence of
[8:26] the Lord come down uh just in that that
[8:28] little area there and so I I believe
[8:31] there's good things going to happen out
[8:32] of that too
[8:34] and so I I'll try to be uh quick here
[8:37] but uh just wanted to give you a little
[8:39] update on Dad um he's he's actually
[8:41] being transferred to to rehab he spent
[8:44] the last uh three days in the three
[8:46] nights in the hospital um with recovery
[8:49] and such he came home for for one night
[8:53] and
[8:55] um it it was very apparent that that was
[8:57] not going to work out I mean real quick
[8:59] so uh the next morning um I got uh on
[9:04] the phone and was was trying to make
[9:05] calls and such to to try to get him back
[9:08] into rehab and um I'll just be honest
[9:11] with you that the first answer was a
[9:14] direct no this this can't happen you you
[9:18] you know when you left the hospital the
[9:20] case was closed and with Medicare and
[9:22] such once it's a closed case it's it's
[9:25] done you know um and then
[9:30] at some point
[9:33] um after a few calls we we they called
[9:36] back and said you need to take your dad
[9:39] to the emergency room and we'll reopen
[9:43] the case um he's got to spend three
[9:45] nights in the hospital and then go to a
[9:48] rehab facility from
[9:50] there so we uh loaded him up and and
[9:56] ironically the the physical therapist
[9:59] that was um scheduled to come that
[10:02] day he came and helped me get Dad back
[10:05] out of the house because I didn't know
[10:06] how I was going to get him out by myself
[10:08] so he was able to to get him out of the
[10:11] house so again the Lord just opening the
[10:12] the door to get him back into the
[10:14] hospital
[10:16] um and then so we get to the hospital
[10:19] and they're running all the checks and
[10:21] stuff and uh kind of a long story we
[10:24] were there for hours uh four or five
[10:26] hours and and then they came back in and
[10:29] said well everything's checking out good
[10:30] so we're going to send you back home and
[10:32] I'm like um that's that's not why we're
[10:35] here you know in kind of appealed again
[10:40] um you know and I told him you know
[10:43] that's that's why we're here CU
[10:44] everything is checking out well I know
[10:46] he's he's not injured in any way but you
[10:50] know he's still having a lot of trouble
[10:52] and he said well I can't make any
[10:54] promises but I'll go and I'll ask again
[10:57] you so he goes back um to the the
[11:01] director
[11:02] uh and about and it was another couple
[11:06] hours uh it was about 9:00 at night at
[11:09] this point uh they came back and said
[11:12] we're going to met him and take him up
[11:15] to a room and you know everything is is
[11:18] fine so um I'd just like to read a
[11:21] scripture that uh boy I've just I've
[11:24] just fell in love with this scripture um
[11:28] Isaiah 42 16 it says and I will bring
[11:31] the Blind by a way that they knew not I
[11:36] will lead them in paths that they have
[11:39] not known I will make Darkness light
[11:42] before them and crooked things straight
[11:45] these things will I do unto them and not
[11:48] forsake
[11:51] them I can't explain it my brothers and
[11:55] sisters
[11:56] but it wasn't just a director of uh the
[12:01] hospital and such that was making these
[12:05] decisions I could feel the prayers of
[12:08] the
[12:09] Saints and
[12:11] how it was your prayers that were
[12:15] interceding on on on my dad's behalf and
[12:19] how even when you know the answer was no
[12:24] I know your prayers were interceding and
[12:26] that answer got turned around and became
[12:28] a yes
[12:30] so I just wanted to say thank you from
[12:35] from my heart
[12:37] um I know it wasn't my prayers because I
[12:40] didn't have the energy I I was exhausted
[12:43] and and doing all that I can but uh I I
[12:48] could feel the prayers of the Saints
[12:50] just move in and and intercede
[12:54] so just wanted to say thank you and then
[12:57] through all this um I can tell you I I
[13:00] was actually really challenged by the
[13:03] Holy Spirit
[13:05] uh you know uh just started remembering
[13:09] the first works and my first love and
[13:11] how God was you know when when he first
[13:15] got a hold of my life uh he's just
[13:18] always the center of everything in every
[13:19] decision and every you know just
[13:22] everything you know God was always a
[13:24] center Center of of everything I did and
[13:29] every all the decisions I made
[13:31] and just some
[13:35] somehow there would be one compromise
[13:38] after another you know and
[13:40] then one decision would lead to another
[13:43] one and next thing you know you're just
[13:45] you're just falling away from that first
[13:49] love and that fervency and such and just
[13:52] feeling the prayers of the Saints and
[13:54] stuff it just really challenged me to
[13:57] get back to
[13:59] to my first
[14:01] love and
[14:04] H just that clearcut focus on God
[14:08] because I've come to realize the the way
[14:11] is straight and
[14:12] narrow but it is straight and it's our
[14:15] own self-will that pulls us off of the
[14:19] straight and narrow and the path becomes
[14:21] crooked but like the the scripture here
[14:24] says he God makes the crooked things
[14:26] straight and I believe through this
[14:28] experience that has also
[14:30] happened in my life where I didn't even
[14:33] realize how far I straight still love
[14:36] him
[14:37] still you know not uh like I'd lost my
[14:40] love but I had just lost the the ferency
[14:44] and and I was challenged by that just
[14:46] feeling the the prayer to the to the
[14:49] Saints and how that came about and how
[14:51] that used to be me you know I would
[14:54] always be quick to go to prayer whenever
[14:56] I I heard a need and such and
[15:05] ironically somehow labeled it as
[15:09] spiritual maturity that I didn't you
[15:12] know I was mature enough where I could
[15:14] kind of decide and choose which things
[15:16] were important which things I needed to
[15:17] pray about and and so I I let down the
[15:21] bars and and I would say well there was
[15:23] sheep out in the pasture so there was
[15:25] some good things that were happening but
[15:27] totally ignoring the goat that got in
[15:30] because I had let down the bar so it
[15:33] just really spent a time in prayer and
[15:36] and just asking the Lord to to take me
[15:40] back to that to that first love and just
[15:43] that
[15:45] fervency so I just wanted to make that
[15:49] confession to the
[15:50] Saints I'm sorry I
[15:55] um I just uh was really challenged and
[15:58] it was the Lord doing it wasn't me so
[16:00] wanted to say thank you for your prayers
[16:03] and I sure appreciate each and every one
[16:07] of you and the and the Saints here uh
[16:10] the body of Believers we have both young
[16:12] and
[16:13] old younger and Veterans uh I like
[16:16] brothers and
[16:18] sisters just how we pull together and
[16:21] and it's just my brother Samuel talked
[16:23] about you know the cast uh and and I
[16:26] could feel Satan wanting to uh uh make a
[16:30] break of Dad's situation but there was
[16:32] the cast of prayers that was around the
[16:35] Brokenness that was holding everything
[16:38] together it wouldn't let Satan take him
[16:40] above Beyond a certain bounds so there's
[16:44] also another cast of of characters in in
[16:47] in like a play we know we're in a great
[16:48] drama and I've just been praying to the
[16:51] Lord to take my
[16:53] place my rightful place back again in
[16:55] the cast of this this drama and to
[16:57] become uh
[16:59] back to the part of of this this body
[17:02] that that he needs me to be
[17:05] [Music]
[17:07] so I believe uh I believe that's uh that
[17:12] was a burden on my heart this morning so
[17:14] Dad's doing well appreciate you all I
[17:18] appreciate a pastor that I can have
[17:20] confidence in
[17:22] and just preaches the the pure word and
[17:26] and
[17:27] it's um
[17:29] most of all I
[17:30] appreciate the heavenly father
[17:34] the The Good the great
[17:37] shepher when we're when we're blind and
[17:40] we don't know what steps in front of us
[17:42] says right here in his word he'll lead
[17:44] us in the past He he'll make the light
[17:47] in front of
[17:49] us and like myself
[17:52] when when we get off and we make the way
[17:57] crooked he'll make the crooked things
[17:59] straight he'll do those things he won't
[18:02] forsake us we might be straying away a
[18:06] little but he knows how to get us back
[18:09] so thank you once again let's just go
[18:12] before him in

[41:22] amen it's so good to be in the house of
[41:24] the Lord here this morning is it it's
[41:27] good to be in his presence and and so
[41:30] thankful for his
[41:33] mercy and um thankful for all that he
[41:36] has brought us through am God is
[41:40] faithful isn't he amen he is is
[41:43] certainly that we have that testimony
[41:45] Amen in our hearts that God is indeed
[41:48] faithful and um I know the different
[41:52] requests I heard the requests that were
[41:54] being mentioned and um I know that uh
[41:58] different
[41:59] ones uh down there in from the storm
[42:03] that has come through um I know that
[42:07] they were really dealing with it in the
[42:08] eastern part of Tennessee and in
[42:12] the western part of North Carolina had a
[42:15] um text from Brother Barry there
[42:17] yesterday evening and uh there's places
[42:21] where the roads are just washed
[42:23] out and so um
[42:27] and then even um as Benjamin was letting
[42:31] me know that uh even there today like at
[42:35] brother Donnie's you know there's going
[42:37] to be with their service they're having
[42:39] a dinner afterwards and then also
[42:40] allowing people to use the facilities in
[42:43] order to take showers and things uh it's
[42:46] just been it's it's been quite a bit and
[42:50] so we just want to remember them in
[42:52] prayer and I I know you have been but I
[42:55] also remember this in prayer because
[42:57] there's a storm that's forming in the
[43:00] same
[43:01] pattern and so we want to just pray not
[43:04] only that God cause that to recede as
[43:06] far as the water levels that are there
[43:09] God would just continue to watch over
[43:11] his children but also that the Lord
[43:14] would just you know turn that storm I I
[43:17] I know where as as I was talking to him
[43:19] earlier this morning I said Lord I know
[43:21] we're we're in a stage of drought and
[43:23] there's a lot worse places even in Ohio
[43:26] that's worse than what we were our here
[43:29] um and yet even in those areas and they
[43:32] just I was a few years ago I don't
[43:34] remember the name of these hurricanes
[43:36] because they name every one of them but
[43:38] probably you'll remember it that when we
[43:41] we went to prayer because it was going
[43:43] to come on
[43:44] landfall in in Florida and it was such a
[43:47] high category I can't remember what the
[43:49] highest number is but but I know that
[43:52] not only were we as an assembly praying
[43:54] but I know there were many others around
[43:56] the world
[43:58] it was on the thread that I was on and
[44:00] God lessened that category from being
[44:04] such a devastating storm I tell you he's
[44:08] still in control of all
[44:10] things and so we just want to remember
[44:13] them in prayer that God would just just
[44:15] be merciful there in that in that
[44:19] situation amen so could we just maybe
[44:23] stand and we let's just offer a word of
[44:25] prayer and then ask God's bless blessing
[44:27] upon the word as we prepare to look into
[44:30] the word and amen how many are looking
[44:32] forward to the word amen amen I I'm
[44:35] looking forward to what what he has to
[44:36] say Amen I'm in his hands we're in his
[44:39] hands we've come here to hear from God
[44:43] Amen let's just let's just agree
[44:45] together and let's just approach the
[44:47] throne of God heavenly
[44:49] father there is so many things Lord to
[44:52] thank you
[44:54] for we lord if you you never did one
[44:57] more thing for
[44:59] us when you
[45:01] Lord made known by revelation of what
[45:06] you did on Calvary for us Lord and the
[45:09] effect Upon Our Life of that
[45:12] Revelation that lord it's had nothing to
[45:16] do with any of our righteousness or our
[45:20] goodness nothing that we could ever do
[45:23] or become on our own but rather to
[45:26] accept accept what you've done for us

[49:44] nice parking lot and we thank the Lord
[49:47] for that amen and you know what when
[49:50] we're going in Rapture they can have
[49:53] it but in the meantime that's right

[50:03] thankful say Thank You Lord For The
[50:05] Miracle I'm walking
[50:07] on Amen thank you Lord for being our
[50:10] provider I want to say also thank you to
[50:13] brother Richie he I I was in and out of
[50:15] the office over the past three days or
[50:18] three three weeks while all that was
[50:20] going on and the brothers the trustee
[50:23] Brothers had met I think it was back in
[50:24] August and we the changes that was made
[50:28] in order to have that come about and you
[50:31] know how it is you get ready to do
[50:32] anything and you always know there's
[50:33] going to be uh some obstacles you get
[50:37] down there and here we're a week away
[50:39] and you find out from the village they
[50:41] say oh no you you you have to put the
[50:43] apron in and you have to go back so many
[50:46] feet so that just kind of changed
[50:49] everything and I got the looking and I
[50:51] said well God's made a way let's just
[50:54] let's finish this thing out so we are
[50:57] just so thankful to the Lord you know
[50:59] God know God knows what we have need of
[51:01] and he knows just how to supply when we
[51:03] have need of it because we thought sure
[51:05] as the world when we stood out there
[51:07] next April or May that's when we'll be
[51:08] doing the driveway that's what we
[51:11] thought but God had an even an even
[51:14] greater miracle in mind and uh I tell
[51:17] you brother brother Richie has labored
[51:19] uh very much over here and with the
[51:21] construction of all that with the
[51:22] driveway and all that and I know it's
[51:24] been a lot of time that he's taken away
[51:26] from me his job and I want to say thank
[51:28] you brother Richie
[51:33] not and U brother Joey he's kind of been
[51:37] and seeming like in his element I know
[51:39] he's not here just keep him in prayer
[51:41] this morning but he's the one been
[51:43] working moving all these things around
[51:46] and um I tell you I don't think I I
[51:49] looked closely to make sure he didn't
[51:51] have a bow on that Bobcat when he was
[51:54] driving it but uh you know know he's I
[51:57] really appreciate that and um so also I
[52:01] think we're probably self-explanatory
[52:03] the fire pit we won't be able to have
[52:05] that this evening um you know the rain
[52:08] and and it's incredible because uh you
[52:10] know brother Shane had text me yesterday
[52:12] morning honest the goodness I don't know
[52:13] why I didn't get that text um when we
[52:15] were conferring about it or at least
[52:17] that's what he was sending me something
[52:19] and
[52:20] uh but you know I look at the weather
[52:22] forecast and I one time before dinner
[52:25] last night it says only 177% I was like
[52:28] wow man this is incredible the the
[52:30] rain's already come through it then late
[52:33] last night I get to look let me go back
[52:35] over 95% chance
[52:38] wow it's like politicians are
[52:41] politicians controlling
[52:43] the flip-flopping from one to the other
[52:45] I just wonder what's going on but uh
[52:47] anyhow uh we're the Lord I know the Lord
[52:50] will make a way for us to have that uh I
[52:53] thought if nothing else it'd just be
[52:55] good to come set on the parking lot
[52:58] yes
[52:59] sir but uh anyhow uh we we won't do that
[53:04] but Lord willing next weekend or next
[53:06] Sunday we'll have communion and foot
[53:08] washing on Sunday service there so we'll
[53:11] be getting that out to
[53:13] you uh let's read in the word of God and
[53:17] I apologize for keeping you standing so
[53:19] long uh in verse 7 by faith Noah being
[53:24] warned of God of things not not seen as
[53:27] yet moved with fear prepared an ark to
[53:32] the saving of his house by the which he
[53:35] condemned the world and became heir of
[53:39] the righteousness which is by faith and
[53:42] by faith Abraham when he was called to
[53:45] go out into a place which he should
[53:47] after receive for an inheritance obeyed
[53:51] and he went out not knowing whether he
[53:53] went and by faith he sojourned in the
[53:56] land Land Of Promise as in a strange
[53:58] country dwelling in Tabernacles with
[54:00] Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of
[54:04] the same promise for he looked for a
[54:07] city which hath foundations whose
[54:09] Builder and maker is
[54:11] God I I don't know if you ever caught
[54:14] this but look at verse 11 it doesn't say
[54:17] by faith but it says through faith also
[54:20] Sarah herself see Abraham it was
[54:22] Abraham's faith that produced the
[54:25] miracle and Sarah's life see it's not
[54:28] our faith you say is that scriptural
[54:30] well yeah Paul said the life that I live
[54:32] I now live by the faith of the Son of
[54:35] God who gave himself for me through
[54:39] faith also Sarah herself received
[54:41] strength to conceive seed and was
[54:43] delivered of a child when she was past
[54:45] age because she judged him faithful who
[54:48] had promised therefore spring there even
[54:51] one even of one in him as good as dead
[54:54] so many as the stars of the sky sky in
[54:56] multitude and as the sand which is by
[54:58] the seashore innumerable these all died
[55:01] in faith not having received the
[55:04] promises but having seen them AAR off
[55:08] and were persuaded of them and embraced
[55:11] them and confess that they were
[55:13] strangers and pilgrims on the earth for
[55:16] they that say such things declare
[55:18] plainly that they seek a country and
[55:21] truly if they had been mindful of that
[55:23] country from when they came out they
[55:25] might have had an opportunity to have
[55:28] returned but now they desire a better
[55:32] country that is in Heavenly wherefore
[55:35] God is not ashamed to be called their
[55:38] God for he hath prepared for them a city
[55:43] amen may God bless you and bless the
[55:45] reading of the word as you're being
[55:48] seated and
[55:50] um I'd like
[55:53] to go ahead Brianna you can go and
[55:56] switch that over for me I'd like to just
[55:59] pick up here this morning and resume on
[56:02] this thought of between here and there
[56:05] and you know when we read here in the
[56:09] scriptures as we're reading in Hebrews
[56:12] 11 sometimes it doesn't there's not
[56:15] included I mean you could you could see
[56:17] why the Bible would have to we wouldn't
[56:20] be able to pack it around if it
[56:22] included all of the battles that took
[56:25] place
[56:27] once God revealed and made his will
[56:29] known to an individual it's always
[56:33] there's there's always every time when
[56:35] God speaks then a battle begins to set
[56:40] in remember the prophet would tell us
[56:42] there in the seals of how that every
[56:45] time that when a seal was opened that he
[56:48] said a trumpet was sounded and as soon
[56:51] as that trumpet sounded then war was
[56:54] declared and so every every time when
[56:57] God would would give his word and call
[57:00] his people back to the true atonement
[57:03] away away from the ideas of man as in
[57:06] every age there was always a battle that
[57:10] that follows the word being revealed and
[57:14] that's what we really want to deal with
[57:16] here today in this part of the journey
[57:18] which is not something all together new
[57:21] to us but it's things that God will
[57:23] would speak to us to make it very plain
[57:26] and helpful in our lives because
[57:28] sometimes there's things that we that
[57:30] can be ever so simple but we can we can
[57:33] Wonder and we can look at things and
[57:35] wonder perhaps why I don't see the word
[57:39] coming to pass in my life the way that I
[57:43] believe it should be and notice God's
[57:46] desire he's the one that brings the word
[57:49] to pass that's absolutely the truth we
[57:51] can do nothing without him but
[57:54] everything that God does does is God
[57:57] comes just like in a service like here
[57:59] this morning where we have gathered out
[58:01] from our homes and come together and God
[58:04] comes to speak to our hearts directly by
[58:08] his voice and minister to our lives in
[58:10] such a very personal way and I want you
[58:13] to think of even as we open this here in
[58:16] the scriptures of Noah and this is you
[58:19] know something to me we we've I've been
[58:21] there a few years ago this is this is
[58:23] down in Kentucky but you know it's a uh
[58:26] the think of this Arc to me it was very
[58:28] it's always been incredible to think of
[58:30] it but then as you stand there and you
[58:31] look at it and you are going through
[58:34] that and just to think of how all of
[58:36] this is done and you know this is one of
[58:39] the things I I watched it was a
[58:41] documentary years and years ago I think
[58:44] probably 20 some years ago almost 30
[58:46] years ago of how that even the naval uh
[58:50] testing that that when they construct
[58:52] their ships they use the same
[58:55] dimensional
[58:56] uh are the same um I do I want to say it
[58:59] proportions that God gave within this
[59:02] pattern because they when they have have
[59:05] have put those proportions into their
[59:07] testing tanks it is deemed Unsinkable
[59:11] and so they have use that for every
[59:12] aircraft carrier for all of these things
[59:15] these same proportions and I I'll just
[59:17] say it like this it's just it's just one
[59:20] testimony if you're going to go to war
[59:22] go with the
[59:24] word because the word is
[59:27] Unsinkable the word is undefeatable
[59:30] that's right is that right so when we
[59:33] think of this with Noah and Noah prior
[59:36] to even entering the ark I mean you know
[59:38] brother Brandon tells us that Noah
[59:40] wasn't even an architect he was a farmer
[59:43] it would you know you would you would
[59:45] think that you know God perhaps you got
[59:48] the wrong address you meant this guy
[59:51] over here but God didn't mean it for
[59:53] anybody else but for Noah brother Bram
[59:56] described Noah as just a simple
[59:59] righteous man before this Revelation
[1:00:01] came to him brother Braham said he was
[1:00:04] just a simple man that would gather his
[1:00:07] family together they would pray they
[1:00:09] would have devotions and there was a
[1:00:11] burden upon his heart with seeing the
[1:00:14] condition of the world at that hour with
[1:00:17] with with sin in the world and he said
[1:00:20] it was God who moved and was moving Noah
[1:00:23] in that place to where Noah would
[1:00:25] actually receive a divine revelation
[1:00:28] from God now I want you to think of this
[1:00:30] it would have to be a revelation
[1:00:32] remember as we looked at it last week
[1:00:34] that faith is a revelation faith is
[1:00:37] sovereignly given you and I cannot work
[1:00:40] ourselves up into I'm going to get Faith
[1:00:42] or I'm going to get Faith No that faith
[1:00:45] is sovereignly given but what you and I
[1:00:48] are charged with or commissioned with is
[1:00:51] to be available as a channel to make
[1:00:55] sure that everything that all God has
[1:00:58] laid out before us to do that our life
[1:01:01] is lined up with that now there's many
[1:01:04] things friends around our lives we do
[1:01:06] not need someone to Stand Here a prophet
[1:01:09] to stand here and discern what is wrong
[1:01:12] in our life because the word is the
[1:01:15] discerner there are things that the
[1:01:17] scripture tells us that is written in
[1:01:20] the word of God as far as God's will
[1:01:23] what what comes down to is is whether or
[1:01:25] not not that we in our lives allowing
[1:01:28] the word of God even during our time of
[1:01:30] devotion getting into the message of the
[1:01:32] hour and really inviting God to examine
[1:01:35] Our Lives I'll tell you when we invite
[1:01:38] God to examine our lives and then if
[1:01:40] there's anything that's wrong the
[1:01:42] prophet said ask God to remedy it and
[1:01:46] then then our hearts become an open
[1:01:49] available channel for divine inspiration
[1:01:52] to fall into you see we God gives us his
[1:01:56] word that then as the word would come
[1:01:58] forth that Lord I want my life to be
[1:02:01] washed I want it to be clean I want it
[1:02:03] to be ready I want to be walking in Step
[1:02:05] because when faith is needed I want
[1:02:07] there to be a place I want to be in
[1:02:09] position for Faith to drop that's the
[1:02:12] same way it is for the Rapture the
[1:02:14] Rapture it comes just like it was in the
[1:02:16] time of Enoch it was that where Enoch
[1:02:18] was walking with God when Enoch was
[1:02:22] raptured it was just another day in the
[1:02:24] life of Enoch
[1:02:26] amen he walked with God it wasn't all of
[1:02:29] a sudden one day he got really serious
[1:02:31] and then boom Rapture no he walked with
[1:02:35] God Faithfully That's what the Bible
[1:02:37] said before his translation he had this
[1:02:41] testimony when before right before right
[1:02:46] so when we look at this you know Noah
[1:02:49] all of his
[1:02:50] inabilities uh my what God called him to
[1:02:53] do to construct and build an ark
[1:02:56] I mean he's a farmer but God God gave
[1:03:01] him this Revelation and through that
[1:03:03] Revelation Noah would stand and be
[1:03:07] persevering where where there was no
[1:03:09] matter any of his inabilities of uh you
[1:03:12] know maybe he couldn't even cut a board
[1:03:14] straight or you know let alone doing
[1:03:16] other things he he just God did not
[1:03:18] choose him because of his natural
[1:03:20] abilities but God chose Noah because
[1:03:24] already before the Foundation The World
[1:03:27] God already saw all of this in his mind
[1:03:30] and that word struck Noah's heart and
[1:03:32] Noah in order for this to come about
[1:03:35] Noah had to die to
[1:03:39] himself every day every through every
[1:03:41] challenge he had to die to himself when
[1:03:44] it got hard when the situations went he
[1:03:47] felt like perhaps like you and I do
[1:03:50] sometimes when we get in things over our
[1:03:52] head and we say you know what this
[1:03:55] Plumbing job is too much call a
[1:03:57] plumber I'm in over my head right now or
[1:04:00] call this or call this or call brother
[1:04:02] so so call this but you see Noah himself
[1:04:05] when God gives a revelation our
[1:04:07] dependency is on the one who spoke to us
[1:04:11] not on ourselves not on anybody else
[1:04:15] it's on
[1:04:17] God Amen is that right now he held to
[1:04:20] this Revelation and that Revelation you
[1:04:22] know it brought it brought Noah through
[1:04:25] and and God gave him Grace within it
[1:04:27] that to persevere beyond all of his
[1:04:30] understandings and I I want to to go on
[1:04:33] here to a place and just to say every
[1:04:36] time that God speaks to our heart every
[1:04:39] time when the word comes forth I I want
[1:04:41] God I I and my desire is Lord that you
[1:04:45] would reveal yourself to us Lord reveal
[1:04:48] what you what the furtherance of your
[1:04:50] will is for my life is that your desire
[1:04:54] and even as we're coming to hear the
[1:04:56] word of God there's right after even
[1:04:59] hearing the word of God now I know
[1:05:01] there's times where there's things that
[1:05:03] right here while the word is taking
[1:05:04] place sometimes there's things that we
[1:05:06] can see not only what takes place on the
[1:05:10] inside but then there's change that can
[1:05:12] take place just like that but let me
[1:05:14] tell you when God gives you his word
[1:05:16] it's the word that produces the change
[1:05:20] because it's the word that creates the
[1:05:22] atmosphere and even after you leave out
[1:05:24] of these buildings when you get out
[1:05:26] there on Monday morning the word that
[1:05:29] you have received there the test is
[1:05:32] going to come and say Lord help me Lord
[1:05:35] God let me die more to my will let me
[1:05:39] die more to myself that the word that
[1:05:41] you spoke might come to
[1:05:45] pass I want you to think of this here
[1:05:48] there this with
[1:05:49] Abraham the Bible says right after this
[1:05:52] when this we get a little Glimpse on
[1:05:54] this this is just on my heart on the
[1:05:56] between here and there we have a little
[1:05:58] Glimpse on this with Abraham where the
[1:06:00] Bible says by faith when he was tried he
[1:06:03] offered up Isaac and he that had
[1:06:06] received the promises offered up his
[1:06:09] only begotten son of whom it was said
[1:06:13] that in Isaac shall thy seed be called
[1:06:17] accounting that God was able to raise
[1:06:20] him up even from the dead from whence he
[1:06:24] also received him in a figure now I want
[1:06:27] you to think of this the resolve of
[1:06:30] Abraham's Faith now I want you to watch
[1:06:33] the Abraham's faith it there was a real
[1:06:36] true faith in Abraham all the time but
[1:06:39] that Faith had to
[1:06:41] mature and the only way that Faith
[1:06:44] matured was not god pushing him or
[1:06:47] pulling him he had decisions he had to
[1:06:50] make in his life and Abraham made some
[1:06:53] wrong decisions
[1:06:55] Abraham made some decisions where he got
[1:06:58] under the influence of others and some
[1:07:00] of the influence he got under was was
[1:07:03] his own feeling of compassion in the
[1:07:06] gate of his affection and he kept lot
[1:07:09] and his father with him is that right
[1:07:14] that's good this is why when God opens
[1:07:16] up Genesis 12 and the Lord had said not
[1:07:20] it wasn't a new message coming God was
[1:07:22] saying hey I'm pointing you back
[1:07:24] remember what I asked you to do do back
[1:07:25] here before you ever left the valley of
[1:07:28] shinar it's not been complete yet aren't
[1:07:32] you glad that God brings you in I back
[1:07:34] with his word and says wait a minute
[1:07:36] here the reason there's no progress the
[1:07:39] reason things sometimes aren't going
[1:07:41] forward is is we need to examine have I
[1:07:44] done all that God has asked me to do
[1:07:47] right up to this point you see we do not
[1:07:50] want to become under the spirit of this
[1:07:53] lady o seean age that just thinks that
[1:07:56] well I'm a part of a church and you say
[1:07:58] Well when we're around the message of
[1:07:59] the hour that Spirit don't stay out
[1:08:01] there that spirit it's a part of the
[1:08:04] lady oan age as to where then you know
[1:08:07] well we've got this knowledge and we
[1:08:09] know God sent a prophet and I know this
[1:08:11] Doctrine and I know that but remember
[1:08:13] God's not going to Rapture doctrines the
[1:08:16] only thing that's going to be raptured
[1:08:18] is our character and that character can
[1:08:22] only come to pass by the character of
[1:08:25] life that's on the inside of us listen
[1:08:27] when we're raptured the books and texts
[1:08:30] will be
[1:08:31] here my Bible will be here but what's
[1:08:34] going back is the Living manifested Word
[1:08:38] that's what he's coming
[1:08:40] for Hallelujah glory be to God Amen and
[1:08:44] Abraham what a faith it was such a
[1:08:47] resolve within his heart Abraham had
[1:08:50] become so in tune with God that that by
[1:08:53] of the surrendering of his will and that
[1:08:56] inner man that that the preeminence in
[1:09:00] his life was God's desire that that's
[1:09:03] not something that just it just happened
[1:09:05] and it didn't just happen from him
[1:09:07] sitting in a message Church it didn't
[1:09:10] happen just because you know he was
[1:09:11] sitting around and hearing wonderful
[1:09:13] Ministry that happened because Abraham
[1:09:16] was making a decision from within and
[1:09:19] laying his will on the altar right
[1:09:23] that's why when the word speaks to
[1:09:26] in order for the word to come to pass it
[1:09:28] requires
[1:09:29] sacrifice think of it in your life and
[1:09:31] my life how could we ever live this life
[1:09:35] that we have now I can't live this life
[1:09:37] you can't live this life it takes him to
[1:09:41] come inside of you and I it takes him to
[1:09:45] bring the real change on the inside it
[1:09:48] takes God to deal with the heart on the
[1:09:50] inner man on the
[1:09:52] inside then it's no longer I that liveth
[1:09:55] but it's Christ that liveth in me that's
[1:09:57] beautiful so how did that come by
[1:09:59] sacrifice right that we might live right
[1:10:04] now think of this the surrendering of
[1:10:07] his will you know when you look at this
[1:10:10] here in the scriptures and think of how
[1:10:13] that the Bible would tell us that you
[1:10:15] know over and over when you just just
[1:10:18] look at the thoughts on the heart and
[1:10:20] that's what God's after God's not after
[1:10:23] our mind Satan Satan chose the intellect
[1:10:26] now remember you can start with an
[1:10:28] intellectual Faith that'll bring you up
[1:10:31] to the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost is
[1:10:33] where it moves from intellectual Faith
[1:10:36] to a supernatural Faith down on the
[1:10:38] inside because an intellectual Faith you
[1:10:41] never want to just stay there but an
[1:10:43] intellectual faith is a start but God's
[1:10:46] desire is that we would be fully fully
[1:10:50] Sons and Daughters of God by the
[1:10:52] indwelling of the Holy Spirit that's the
[1:10:55] only thing that can bring a real change
[1:10:58] of our
[1:10:59] nature that's the only thing that brings
[1:11:01] a distance between that between that of
[1:11:05] the world and us that's got to be a
[1:11:07] death to self and Christ himself moving
[1:11:10] on the inside and raising up that new
[1:11:13] life that new man that only he himself
[1:11:16] can
[1:11:17] do is everybody with
[1:11:20] me so I want you to think of this that
[1:11:24] the Bible said that as a man thanketh in
[1:11:27] his heart so is he that's why we we've
[1:11:29] got to make sure that everything our
[1:11:31] heart is lined up with God cuz see
[1:11:34] whatever is in the heart will always
[1:11:36] come out
[1:11:37] right this is why when the Bible said as
[1:11:40] a man thanketh in his heart so is he
[1:11:42] when God went to choose a king he's not
[1:11:46] the one who chose Saul God simply said
[1:11:49] what you want I got the man that'll
[1:11:52] match what's in your heart come on he
[1:11:54] went Saul was not not a man after God's
[1:11:56] Own Heart that's what was in their
[1:11:59] heart and God warned them be careful of
[1:12:03] the desires of your heart of where to
[1:12:05] lead you to God even let them know this
[1:12:08] is your choice I'm not going to make it
[1:12:10] for you but I'm going to warn you what's
[1:12:12] going to happen to your children they're
[1:12:14] going to become enslaved in bondage
[1:12:16] they're going to be taken in I'm going
[1:12:17] to warn you of what's going to happen
[1:12:19] because the desire of your heart and
[1:12:22] look what happened the desire of the
[1:12:24] heart brought forth a
[1:12:27] manifestation now if that would take
[1:12:29] place in manifesting that what about
[1:12:33] when God brings forth in our life a real
[1:12:37] Godly desire amen what about when that
[1:12:40] desire when that word is dropped in our
[1:12:42] heart will it not produce what the word
[1:12:45] is called for when that desire is there
[1:12:48] that'll match I say God I want my
[1:12:51] heart's desire let Lord every desire in
[1:12:53] my life if there's something that's not
[1:12:56] right Lord I want the word Lord I want
[1:12:59] the word to clear it out make me aware
[1:13:01] of it Lord so I can guide to myself I
[1:13:04] don't want that thing coming forth in my
[1:13:09] life so to think when God God's desire
[1:13:13] for you and I and this is always God's
[1:13:16] desire every time God you look through
[1:13:18] Abraham's life Abraham comes into the
[1:13:21] land he don't know he's arrived in the
[1:13:22] land but when he comes into the land
[1:13:24] that that God said I'll show you God
[1:13:27] speaks to him and immediately Abraham
[1:13:29] sets up an altar you find it when God
[1:13:32] spoke to Gideon soon as God spoke to get
[1:13:35] here's an altar on on and on you find an
[1:13:37] altar you know why because the altar
[1:13:40] itself it speaks of
[1:13:43] sacrifice and it speaks of the sacrifice
[1:13:46] of these things right here our will and
[1:13:48] our heart notice when Gideon himself
[1:13:51] even when God spoke to Gideon and he put
[1:13:54] that he put that offering on the on the
[1:13:56] altar you know what yes the offering was
[1:13:59] consumed but do you realize that as that
[1:14:02] offering was being consumed what was
[1:14:04] also taking place in Gideon's life is
[1:14:07] more of Gideon's will was being
[1:14:12] consumed I said God consume every bit of
[1:14:16] us Lord I want the word to consume every
[1:14:20] bit of my life I I don't want to take it
[1:14:22] off my off the altar when it's venient
[1:14:25] but I want to leave my life on the altar
[1:14:28] I want to continue to die to myself this
[1:14:31] is where the Lord Jesus said we must
[1:14:33] bear that cross daily dying to
[1:14:38] ourselves
[1:14:39] daily oh God help us this is where this
[1:14:43] is where the battle would come in think
[1:14:46] about even the heart itself and how
[1:14:48] God's desire would be on that of the
[1:14:50] heart where even David would say don't
[1:14:52] only let the words of my mouth but the
[1:14:54] med meditation of my heart be acceptable
[1:14:57] in thy sight oh God even in Isaiah 53
[1:15:01] when it would speak of how that God
[1:15:03] himself would look down upon the
[1:15:05] sacrifice and the Bible said he would
[1:15:08] see the travail of his soul you see God
[1:15:12] isn't isn't looking and all consumed
[1:15:14] with everything that's out here but God
[1:15:17] is consumed with what is on the inside
[1:15:20] this is why friends the message is not
[1:15:23] something that has come to move us in
[1:15:26] our thinking to give us some oh this is
[1:15:28] a better thinking and and this is some
[1:15:30] no the the message the word the gospel
[1:15:33] it comes to bring a change and a
[1:15:36] Deliverance it comes to deal with the
[1:15:38] heart because when God has the heart in
[1:15:41] his hand then everything else will
[1:15:45] change that's so good yes sir Hallelujah
[1:15:50] this is why when you think of this we're
[1:15:53] familiar with this when come here into
[1:15:56] the Garden of Gethsemane think of it
[1:15:59] right think of this I want you just to
[1:16:01] just pay close attention this now here
[1:16:03] in the Garden of
[1:16:05] Gethsemane God himself has stepped down
[1:16:10] to be our
[1:16:13] sacrifice Our
[1:16:15] Redeemer the one who would pay the
[1:16:18] penalty of sin's debt that he might
[1:16:22] release his life back into you and I
[1:16:25] now then remember what watch now the
[1:16:27] prophet tells us predestination because
[1:16:30] predestination is not you or I just
[1:16:33] getting you know one day we start
[1:16:34] thinking about God and we go to a Sunday
[1:16:37] school and all of a sudden we're reading
[1:16:39] and we're memorizing scriptures and then
[1:16:42] all of a sudden the seed is put in us
[1:16:44] that is not the Bible that's good is
[1:16:47] that right we were always his seed the
[1:16:50] the Bible tells us in Galatians 4 that
[1:16:53] you've re you've received the Holy Ghost
[1:16:56] because you are Sons
[1:16:58] Amen on and on we could go Paul wrote of
[1:17:01] on and on we get all the way through the
[1:17:03] scriptures it's not just isolated
[1:17:05] portions you say brother Samuel what are
[1:17:07] you saying that this is a drama that's
[1:17:10] being acted out and God himself when he
[1:17:13] came down he never came down in a
[1:17:16] halfhazard way he never came down with
[1:17:19] wondering will there be some individuals
[1:17:21] that will feel sorry for me and and you
[1:17:23] know they'll be moved they'll make a
[1:17:25] movie about me and people will be moved
[1:17:28] for just day week month whatever maybe
[1:17:31] somewhere actually they were moved to
[1:17:33] actually start going to church and give
[1:17:35] their life to God but he didn't come for
[1:17:37] that he came that he might redeem his
[1:17:40] children that were with him he forew in
[1:17:43] his mind that's why he came Hall so it
[1:17:48] wasn't a halfhazard event it wasn't just
[1:17:50] something that's just thrown up in the
[1:17:52] air god already laid out the plan plan
[1:17:55] the whole
[1:17:58] plan think about how the Lord Jesus here
[1:18:02] he is coming to this point in his
[1:18:07] ministry this is this is this is a
[1:18:09] climax in this Earthly Ministry and here
[1:18:12] he is coming and he prays three
[1:18:16] times this very prayer oh my father if
[1:18:19] it be possible let this cup pass from me
[1:18:22] nevertheless not as I will
[1:18:25] but as thou
[1:18:27] Wilt
[1:18:29] that that was not an act am God so
[1:18:34] condescended that he was able to feel
[1:18:37] the Bible said he learned obedience
[1:18:40] through the things that he suffered
[1:18:42] Hallelujah here he is he's feeling that
[1:18:45] pain because knowing what awaits him
[1:18:48] knowing the the test knowing what aits
[1:18:51] him with the with the calvary knowing
[1:18:53] what awaits with the cross but he knows
[1:18:56] he this is all the way down you read it
[1:18:58] in John 10 or John 10 John 12 you read
[1:19:01] all the way down the Lord Jesus even as
[1:19:03] he stood in Pilot's Hall this purpose
[1:19:06] has not been exempt from his life he has
[1:19:09] walked with this purpose the whole time
[1:19:12] it was this purpose that was in his
[1:19:14] heart that when Peter sought to lay hold
[1:19:16] and said it shall not be so Thou shalt
[1:19:19] not be crucified and he turned around
[1:19:22] and he said get thou behind me
[1:19:25] Satan right for thou you don't esteem
[1:19:28] the things of God it wasn't Peter Peter
[1:19:31] was not Satan but Jesus was able to
[1:19:34] discern the spirit that was trying to
[1:19:37] take him away from the purpose that he
[1:19:40] was called for oh God may God help us
[1:19:44] give us Grace continually in our lives
[1:19:47] to
[1:19:48] discern yes yes Amen brother Samuel my
[1:19:52] my boss no I want you to think how close
[1:19:54] to was
[1:19:57] Peter that's how close it was don't
[1:19:59] don't AR getting your mind on on
[1:20:01] somebody that's not what I've said that
[1:20:03] for I've said that for this for this
[1:20:06] point is so that you and I have to
[1:20:08] understand what God has asked us to do
[1:20:11] that's between you and God that's that's
[1:20:14] good Hallelujah there can be a lot of
[1:20:17] things that can come to try to reason
[1:20:19] you away from it because why that was
[1:20:22] that would have been better for who not
[1:20:24] for me
[1:20:25] that would have been better for the Lord
[1:20:27] Jesus if he would have taken that way
[1:20:29] went that way that would have been
[1:20:31] better for him in the sense of he
[1:20:33] wouldn't have had to Die the death that
[1:20:35] he died but he made a choice based on
[1:20:38] the word and when he made a choice based
[1:20:40] on the word it was a choice that held
[1:20:43] him and gave him strength to continue to
[1:20:45] submit himself to the will of God
[1:20:49] Amen
[1:20:50] yes and in this time this is where the
[1:20:54] Prophet speaks to us this is
[1:20:57] where that prevailing victory was
[1:21:00] at was where in gemane right Gethsemane
[1:21:06] the place of the olive press where all
[1:21:09] of the life is squeezed
[1:21:12] out Gethsemane is where he prevailed and
[1:21:15] overcame or you say oh no that that was
[1:21:17] on Easter morning that was only the
[1:21:20] manifestation that's right that's only a
[1:21:23] manifestation and let me tell you it
[1:21:25] started back even further than
[1:21:27] Gethsemane right or you say it his birth
[1:21:30] it went further back than
[1:21:34] that
[1:21:36] Hallelujah and all that dwell upon the
[1:21:39] Earth shall worship him talking about
[1:21:41] that Beast that religious system whose
[1:21:43] names are not written in the Book of
[1:21:45] Life of the lamb slain from the
[1:21:49] foundation of the world so where where
[1:21:52] did this all begin it again in the mind
[1:21:55] of God God was settled in his heart I'm
[1:21:58] going to do this before there was ever a
[1:22:02] devil God had already settled
[1:22:05] itall are you hearing me it was already
[1:22:08] settled this is why the very thing this
[1:22:10] is why Satan is always wanting us to get
[1:22:13] our attention away from the heart it's
[1:22:16] the heart that matters God sent a
[1:22:18] message to turn not our heads but our
[1:22:21] hearts back to him this is why so many
[1:22:25] times even as we we come sometimes in a
[1:22:28] service and oh how God Is So dealt with
[1:22:31] our hearts and my our hearts are so
[1:22:33] touched and so warmed then we get out of
[1:22:37] church goes maybe for days and maybe it
[1:22:40] goes for weeks and all of a sudden we
[1:22:43] find ourselves pulling back from what
[1:22:46] God is wanting us to surrender
[1:22:50] to that's so good this is why this is
[1:22:55] why that this is not a
[1:23:02] drive-thru Chick-fil-A has a very
[1:23:04] efficient drive-thru most efficient
[1:23:06] drive-thru okay I'm not trying to bring
[1:23:08] props for that company but this is not a
[1:23:10] drive-through I'll just be quite honest
[1:23:12] with you there's a lot of things in my
[1:23:14] life I'd love for it to be drive-thru
[1:23:17] I'd love to order it at one end and by
[1:23:20] the way have some more people out here
[1:23:23] so I can move quicker I got things to do
[1:23:26] I got Life to Live let me tell you
[1:23:28] something your life right
[1:23:31] here is not about
[1:23:35] you the life and the span that we have
[1:23:38] here you say how do I know I don't know
[1:23:40] our span between here and there I don't
[1:23:42] know I don't know how long that Dash is
[1:23:45] I don't know what that is until from now
[1:23:47] until the body change or you or I go
[1:23:50] beyond the veil of time I don't know
[1:23:52] what that is but in the meantime
[1:23:54] everything that matters what matters is
[1:23:57] what we have done for his
[1:23:59] kingdom because you can dig down and
[1:24:02] you'll find no notice the archaeologists
[1:24:04] dig down and they'll find the names of
[1:24:06] Moses they'll find the names of their
[1:24:09] pharaohs and everything else they're
[1:24:11] buried beneath the
[1:24:13] Earth but those that have surrendered
[1:24:16] their lives to God that's what lives on
[1:24:21] am I tell you friends I I mean this With
[1:24:23] all sincerity in my heart I could stand
[1:24:25] at a funeral and hear accolades after
[1:24:27] accolades that a person did but what
[1:24:30] everything that mean what means in my
[1:24:32] heart is do they know the Lord Jesus
[1:24:35] Christ in his resurrection power because
[1:24:39] everything else will not
[1:24:42] [Applause]
[1:24:43] matter this is what matters this time
[1:24:46] this moment that we have between here
[1:24:48] and there
[1:24:50] right I think of how that he gathered
[1:24:54] here was this was settled there I love
[1:24:57] how brother BR says this
[1:24:59] this this statement in Gethsemane he
[1:25:02] said Gethsemane laid just before him
[1:25:05] where that once and final all sufficient
[1:25:08] test must come when the burdens of the
[1:25:11] entire world laid upon his blessed
[1:25:14] shoulders there was no one in all
[1:25:16] Heavens or Earth could ever stood it but
[1:25:18] him and to know that all of the sins of
[1:25:22] past sins present sin sins future sins
[1:25:26] rested upon this
[1:25:29] decision so he didn't have to he don't
[1:25:31] have to come back if you made a mistake
[1:25:33] he don't have to come back and go to
[1:25:35] Calvary again when when he touched your
[1:25:37] life and made you aware that I am your
[1:25:40] sacrifice you know what he's doing he's
[1:25:42] not so much attaching attaching you to
[1:25:45] just a a place called Calvary he's
[1:25:47] taking you back to the mind of God where
[1:25:50] in his heart he made that decision that
[1:25:53] I will lay down down my life for
[1:25:56] you Calvary was a
[1:25:58] manifestation of what was settled in
[1:26:00] God's
[1:26:02] heart oh God let it be settled in our
[1:26:05] hearts I'm talking about friends even as
[1:26:08] we walk on with God as we move on
[1:26:11] brother bam said that was one of the
[1:26:12] greatest victories that Christ ever won
[1:26:15] or proved his messiahship notice one of
[1:26:18] the greatest ones you know we might look
[1:26:21] at that and say Well when he said not my
[1:26:23] will thine will be done
[1:26:24] the greatest victory that was won all
[1:26:26] the Demons of Torment was around to
[1:26:29] tempt him and try him why why to
[1:26:33] stop from what God's purpose was for
[1:26:37] him you think you think that you think
[1:26:40] even when we leave out of this place you
[1:26:42] think that the spirits don't want to try
[1:26:44] to gather sometimes you wonder why
[1:26:46] things you start feeling the way you do
[1:26:48] after you've left
[1:26:50] church you know we would love to be able
[1:26:52] to bottle this presence right here and
[1:26:54] let me just tell you this presence is
[1:26:56] not confined to this building he made a
[1:26:59] promise that he said I'll never leave
[1:27:01] you nor forsake you come on now you
[1:27:04] might say well brother Samu I don't see
[1:27:05] my life you know all the way tting up
[1:27:08] but if there's listen now if there's a
[1:27:10] desire in your heart to be fully fledged
[1:27:14] as a Christian that is the holy spirit
[1:27:17] up on your life that is creating that
[1:27:20] hunger and that thirst
[1:27:23] [Applause]
[1:27:24] Hallelujah his presence listen now all
[1:27:27] you say well I just want his presence to
[1:27:30] continue around my life I want that word
[1:27:32] because it will take his presence to
[1:27:34] bring it to pass as our will is
[1:27:37] continually surrendered to him sometimes
[1:27:39] the simplest of things of when we we can
[1:27:43] get we can kind of pull back yeah you
[1:27:46] know Jer Jericho was a great Victory
[1:27:50] right you have to be careful because
[1:27:52] after great victories is a Temptation
[1:27:55] for
[1:27:59] complacency yeah they came to Joshua and
[1:28:02] said everybody don't need to get out of
[1:28:04] bed this morning send a couple thousand
[1:28:06] up you said well that was because of
[1:28:08] achin remember what that spoke of When
[1:28:11] sin was in the camp When sin unbelief
[1:28:14] gets in the heart you say well what is
[1:28:16] unbelief and doing this and doing that
[1:28:18] listen there are many attributes of
[1:28:20] unbelief but one of the things always to
[1:28:23] evaluate is where is our trust and our
[1:28:26] Reliance are we relying upon oursel or
[1:28:29] relying upon my oh what a wonderful day
[1:28:32] in service the devil is going to be
[1:28:34] right on our
[1:28:35] tracks he's the devil's not looking at
[1:28:38] one thing and saying my what a wonderful
[1:28:40] service that was I'll just back away no
[1:28:42] he's going to tear right into you and I
[1:28:45] you might say brother Samuel I came to
[1:28:46] hear encouraging words God is speaking
[1:28:49] encouraging words he's letting you and I
[1:28:52] know that you know what the enemy you
[1:28:55] know this is what's been going on and
[1:28:57] Satan's desire is to try to knock
[1:29:00] everything out of you that God is
[1:29:02] wanting to put in you right there's no
[1:29:05] portion of the promised land that you'll
[1:29:07] ever take and it not be contested every
[1:29:10] inch that you have in God it'll always
[1:29:13] be
[1:29:14] contested is that
[1:29:16] right I want you to think of this
[1:29:19] there's where there's always some
[1:29:22] preparations let's get back to Abraham
[1:29:23] for for a
[1:29:24] moment there's always preparations and
[1:29:27] precautions that we have to take right
[1:29:30] remember how brother Bram talked about
[1:29:32] he said after you're prayed for he said
[1:29:35] what's the company you're
[1:29:38] keeping is that right he said because if
[1:29:42] you're not careful you get around people
[1:29:44] who don't believe in Divine Healing and
[1:29:48] all of a sudden that situation will come
[1:29:50] right
[1:29:51] back this is let me just say this very
[1:29:54] very clearly and the spirit of God is
[1:29:55] able to bring this to your heart if
[1:29:57] there's something you're battling with
[1:29:59] or you're struggling with don't yoke
[1:30:02] yourself up with like a self-help group
[1:30:05] of people with the same
[1:30:07] things you know why because it's Spirits
[1:30:10] Binding Together but yoke yourself to
[1:30:13] the word this is what God has said in
[1:30:16] his word and I'm going to stand with God
[1:30:18] I'm going to take his word I'm not I'm
[1:30:20] not you know looking down on somebody
[1:30:22] else I I just don't want to get around
[1:30:24] the same channels of influence amen
[1:30:27] that's right sometimes you see what it
[1:30:29] is we're we're wanting well well it's
[1:30:31] got to be done right here in the house
[1:30:33] of God there are things that God does
[1:30:35] right here and sometimes we get to such
[1:30:38] a place to where we we want things done
[1:30:41] and we get out of the presence of God
[1:30:43] and then we become seeking oh I I got to
[1:30:45] get into where wherever his presence is
[1:30:47] at I need to go here where the princess
[1:30:49] I got to go it's got to be so strong
[1:30:51] that's that's God only melting our will
[1:30:54] to his
[1:30:56] word there are many things that will
[1:30:59] take place in a moment in a twinkling of
[1:31:01] an eye but in this situation that I'm
[1:31:03] reading right here with Abraham this is
[1:31:05] a journey many times that you and I are
[1:31:08] on that when God speaks to us he doesn't
[1:31:10] do it right at that
[1:31:12] moment but he asks us will you
[1:31:16] surrender to my voice
[1:31:24] hey I'm with you I'm with
[1:31:28] you I want you to notice this when God
[1:31:31] asked
[1:31:35] Abraham and he asked him to take his
[1:31:37] only we read this in Hebrews but I want
[1:31:39] you to notice this are some things I
[1:31:40] want to draw your attention
[1:31:42] to God knew he said I want you to take
[1:31:46] thine only son Isaac whom thou
[1:31:50] lovest God's asking him to
[1:31:55] take the very evidence that he gave him
[1:31:58] and destroy
[1:32:00] it God's testing him to
[1:32:03] see what does he love
[1:32:06] most see God will allow situations God
[1:32:09] will sometimes will permit situations to
[1:32:11] come to test us do you love your job
[1:32:14] more than me that's so good wow do you
[1:32:18] love husband or wife or anybody listen
[1:32:20] friends I love my wife and I love my
[1:32:21] children but I do not love them more
[1:32:24] than I love God right that's good if
[1:32:26] they go on their merry way adios see
[1:32:30] you I'm not saying that to be cruel you
[1:32:32] say well brother Samuel you really can't
[1:32:34] say that I can say that but what's in my
[1:32:36] heart there's been friends that I've had
[1:32:39] that have walked away from this very
[1:32:41] truth and I wept right in my office
[1:32:44] floor when things that they expressed to
[1:32:46] me over the phone and I tried oh God
[1:32:49] trying to to minister to them and it
[1:32:51] wept I didn't even want to believe it
[1:32:53] that they were departing but you realize
[1:32:56] it's not my fortitude it's not it can't
[1:32:59] be your fortitude you understand it's
[1:33:02] got to be something deeper than your
[1:33:04] resolve it's got to be a divine
[1:33:07] revelation in your
[1:33:10] heart that's not an option that's a must
[1:33:14] amen amen Lord I've got to have this or
[1:33:17] I've got to know no I've got to have you
[1:33:21] amen it's your will
[1:33:24] it's your will because inside of his
[1:33:26] will that's where the blessings lay
[1:33:29] that's right that's where we're tested I
[1:33:32] want you to notice this Abraham in this
[1:33:34] scripture right here of of verse three
[1:33:38] after God telling him this Abraham rose
[1:33:41] up early in the
[1:33:42] morning Abraham didn't say I know what
[1:33:45] God's asking me to do I'm going to
[1:33:48] unplug the alarm clock
[1:33:54] he's making
[1:33:56] preparations and he's taking
[1:34:00] precautions are you hearing me
[1:34:02] now you say what kind of preparations is
[1:34:05] he making he's even chopped up the wood
[1:34:09] and said Isaac I want you to put this
[1:34:12] wood in a special little
[1:34:15] sack and if Mama asked us where we're
[1:34:18] going if she just happens to get a rouse
[1:34:21] you know how mamas can get they they can
[1:34:23] then my mothers once the children come
[1:34:25] along there's a feather can drop and
[1:34:26] Mama's
[1:34:28] up it says I want you to make sure just
[1:34:32] tell her we're going to go and
[1:34:35] worship now watch this he makes
[1:34:38] preparation you know for God he's taking
[1:34:41] Isaac he's taking the wood he's taking
[1:34:43] all this you know it's like this I know
[1:34:45] I may it may be a carnal example but you
[1:34:47] just have to take it as it comes it'd be
[1:34:50] like you and me and you saying let's
[1:34:53] meet
[1:34:54] for lunch
[1:34:55] tomorrow I okay and I know it'd be best
[1:35:00] if I left my wallet in the
[1:35:03] car and I can say my wallet's out in the
[1:35:07] car you know what I haven't made
[1:35:11] preparation but what it is I'm trying to
[1:35:13] go around I'm trying I know what's
[1:35:16] required but I know what I know what's
[1:35:18] possibly going to be required of me so
[1:35:20] so not let and not I don't I don't want
[1:35:22] to make that preparation but Abraham you
[1:35:24] see what all of this is it's not a show
[1:35:27] it's what is in Abraham's heart amen
[1:35:31] amen this is what's in Abraham's heart
[1:35:35] brother Bram says it like this I've
[1:35:36] always loved these quotes brother Bram
[1:35:37] says poor old Abraham he didn't want to
[1:35:39] wake Sarah up and tell her about it so
[1:35:42] he got up early and took the little boy
[1:35:44] and the two servants and their little
[1:35:45] mule and he chopped the wood and put it
[1:35:47] in a sack with something and took off
[1:35:50] into the Wilderness brother BR says in
[1:35:52] paragraph 13 3 he says you watch he said
[1:35:55] Abraham couldn't tell Sarah the wife
[1:35:57] that pretty little Jewish boy about 12
[1:35:59] years old going to take him up and cut
[1:36:01] his throat that would have been a
[1:36:03] horrible thing to tell mama he couldn't
[1:36:05] tell her
[1:36:07] right he couldn't do
[1:36:09] it now you we could you know we could
[1:36:12] play the you know the part well that's
[1:36:13] your wife but you know there's some
[1:36:15] things the Bible says don't let your
[1:36:17] left hand know what your right hand's
[1:36:20] doing sometimes there's things that God
[1:36:22] is dealing with your heart on he doesn't
[1:36:24] want the rest of the world to know about
[1:36:26] he just wants your heart to be in tune
[1:36:29] with his voice and to be so
[1:36:31] consumed with Lord and your thy will be
[1:36:35] done in this earth even as it is in
[1:36:38] heaven God consume me that's the whole
[1:36:41] part when God speaks to us consume me
[1:36:44] Lord consume
[1:36:46] me there's many examples here I had many
[1:36:49] other examples within last week and I
[1:36:53] all of just had to get spaced out from
[1:36:55] last week and even some other examples
[1:36:57] that I have in here that should be very
[1:37:00] encouraging to us because sometimes we
[1:37:02] read and look I could go through things
[1:37:04] within Abraham's life you know of other
[1:37:06] times where Abraham himself and with
[1:37:09] Hagar and all of those things that come
[1:37:10] along
[1:37:12] interruptions along the way and in the
[1:37:14] journey but it never changed who Abraham
[1:37:17] was right is that right sure there's
[1:37:21] things that Abraham had to deal with he
[1:37:23] had to deal deal with ishma when all of
[1:37:25] a sudden Abraham came around and
[1:37:26] realized it was wrong God didn't take
[1:37:28] him down and say ishmael's gone nope God
[1:37:31] said no that I'm going to you know what
[1:37:33] as as a Son of God those are things that
[1:37:37] now you're going to have to receive my
[1:37:39] grace to be able to deal with some of
[1:37:41] that Harvest right everybody with me
[1:37:47] yeah this isn't a shouting message and
[1:37:50] I'm not really trying I'm not trying to
[1:37:51] work it that way I just want the word
[1:37:53] tow drop that's that's really what it is
[1:37:55] I want this word to drop because this is
[1:37:58] what translates out of even other
[1:38:02] services other meetings is what takes
[1:38:05] place within our will see I don't want
[1:38:08] to get under an anointing I don't want
[1:38:10] you to get under an
[1:38:11] anointing I want our will to be
[1:38:14] surrendered to the anointing of the
[1:38:17] person of Jesus
[1:38:19] Christ because anointing is not emotion
[1:38:23] not against
[1:38:24] emotion but I can give you a Litany of
[1:38:26] quotes but I'll give you one perfect
[1:38:27] quote why people are so tossed about to
[1:38:30] think about the title of that message
[1:38:31] brother Bram even after preaching it
[1:38:33] comes to the end of that message and he
[1:38:35] says think of it there was never a
[1:38:38] person more anointed than the Lord Jesus
[1:38:41] and he sat down and taught the word
[1:38:45] that's so good the prophet said see
[1:38:47] anointing isn't running all over that's
[1:38:50] good anointing is a supreme power in
[1:38:53] control knowing how and what to do
[1:38:57] that's real anointing yes sir so to
[1:38:59] think of this here I want you to think
[1:39:02] of this for a
[1:39:03] moment and brother brandham even in his
[1:39:06] life you know there's things there's
[1:39:07] examples even where God as he would you
[1:39:10] know with Abraham you know when Nehemiah
[1:39:11] came back in the land Nehemiah when he
[1:39:13] came back from Babylon he knew what he
[1:39:15] was commissioned to do build the walls
[1:39:17] but he didn't go right away and tell
[1:39:19] everybody right he went out and surveyed
[1:39:21] the walls himself first looked at him
[1:39:24] and then he went and told the Brethren
[1:39:26] so sometimes there's there's a season of
[1:39:29] when to make something known that's is
[1:39:32] that right and the Bible said when he
[1:39:34] did that then the scripture said that
[1:39:36] the hand of God was upon the people to
[1:39:38] strengthen them I want you to think of
[1:39:42] this some of the brothers remember when
[1:39:44] we were at the the men's meeting this is
[1:39:45] one thing that struck me with within
[1:39:47] this think about
[1:39:50] mishaa and Misha Walker Every most of as
[1:39:54] as as message Believers when you've read
[1:39:56] this even in the life story of brother
[1:39:58] bradam and you read this and you
[1:40:00] recognize of how that the prophet
[1:40:02] himself he has received my what a what a
[1:40:05] wonderful thing has taken place at
[1:40:07] Mishawaka he's seen those those gifts
[1:40:09] being in operation but what it was it
[1:40:11] wasn't so much the gift that he's
[1:40:13] attracted to but he sees within it
[1:40:15] there's one of them in the speaking in
[1:40:17] tongues and interpreting that one of
[1:40:19] them is a genuine Christian beneath the
[1:40:21] gift then he sends there and he sees
[1:40:24] that beneath the gift of another one
[1:40:26] this guy's a
[1:40:27] hypocrite his wife is you know I can't
[1:40:29] remember if his wife was a brunette and
[1:40:31] he's living with a blonde whatever was
[1:40:33] the Bible said gifts and callings are
[1:40:34] without repentance the rain falls on the
[1:40:36] just and unjust this is why this is why
[1:40:39] you never ever base your uh your your
[1:40:43] foundation and who you are upon a
[1:40:46] gift because the prophet tells us in
[1:40:48] Harvest times Satan can hand out gifts
[1:40:51] by the handfuls
[1:40:53] amen hallelujah is that right nobody
[1:40:55] could out preach Judas right he was a
[1:40:58] great preacher he had he shared
[1:41:00] understanding the prophet said in the
[1:41:02] Mysteries so it's not the gift but so
[1:41:05] often in our Humanity we can we can be
[1:41:09] so attracted by gifts that's so good
[1:41:13] now we love the
[1:41:16] supernatural but the
[1:41:18] supernatural should always be held to
[1:41:21] the word test
[1:41:24] I don't care who it is how long they've
[1:41:26] been around the message the supernatural
[1:41:28] should always be brought to the
[1:41:31] urum are you hearing me yes now notice
[1:41:34] this here here the prophet is standing
[1:41:36] and he has seen this this great display
[1:41:39] and of what has taking place and
[1:41:42] remember he gets all the contacts to go
[1:41:44] and you know Minister here minister
[1:41:46] there and man he's got you know he's
[1:41:48] he's got a a calendar full of going and
[1:41:51] ministering in those churches remember
[1:41:52] he was he was the one that went up there
[1:41:54] and you know he didn't want to go and
[1:41:56] Minister uh they were calling Billy
[1:41:58] brandom and the guy next to him you know
[1:42:00] say oh here he is when brother BR makes
[1:42:02] him
[1:42:03] known see God God was making a way but I
[1:42:07] want you to notice this here when you go
[1:42:09] when you look at this when he comes
[1:42:13] back he makes one
[1:42:16] mistake he comes back and like you and I
[1:42:19] have done sometimes we're so elated and
[1:42:22] we share things
[1:42:24] that we shouldn't
[1:42:25] share I've always marveled at
[1:42:28] this brother BR says it this way he says
[1:42:31] this is his mother-in-law all
[1:42:35] right yeah after he tells her what's
[1:42:37] going to what what they're going to be
[1:42:39] doing she says the very
[1:42:42] idea that you think you drag my daughter
[1:42:45] out among stuff like that
[1:42:53] sorry I have a little bit of chuckle
[1:42:56] there ridiculous that's nothing but
[1:42:59] trash that the other churches has throw
[1:43:02] out she said indeed you'll not bring my
[1:43:05] daughter out like that wait a
[1:43:07] minute it's my
[1:43:10] wife it's my wife you see another this
[1:43:13] is a spirit at work sure
[1:43:17] domineering are you hearing me now it's
[1:43:19] a domineering Spirit Y and I said but
[1:43:23] you know Mrs bubuk down in my heart I
[1:43:27] feel that the Lord wants me to go with
[1:43:29] them people she said you go back up to
[1:43:32] your church my goodness until they are
[1:43:35] able to afford a parsonage for you and
[1:43:38] act like a man that's got some
[1:43:41] sense sounds like she had a little bit
[1:43:44] too much
[1:43:46] Liberty you're not taking my daughter
[1:43:49] out there I said yes
[1:43:51] ma'am and I turned around and walked
[1:43:56] out hope started
[1:43:58] crying she said Billy regardless of what
[1:44:01] mama
[1:44:02] says I'll stay with you amen that's
[1:44:06] tremendous bless her heart she said oh
[1:44:09] that's all right honey brother Bram says
[1:44:11] I just let it go in other words all
[1:44:13] those invitations for a year I just let
[1:44:16] it go he was so excited it was in his
[1:44:20] heart I'm gonna go oh my this is
[1:44:23] wonderful what God has opened what God
[1:44:25] has revealed it's in his
[1:44:28] heart but now through his
[1:44:32] mother-in-law it's knocking it out of
[1:44:34] him he's allowing it of what God has put
[1:44:38] in
[1:44:40] him he's allowing this are you hearing
[1:44:43] me now right the humanity don't bother
[1:44:46] me and I just let it go she wouldn't let
[1:44:49] her daughter go with such people that CA
[1:44:51] it was nothing but trash and so I just
[1:44:54] kind of let it go it was the worst
[1:44:56] mistake I ever made in my life one of
[1:45:00] the worst what was the worst what was it
[1:45:03] you see if we could take this for an
[1:45:05] example brother Brandman over and over
[1:45:06] in my life story he would tell us use my
[1:45:09] mistakes as stepping stones of God's
[1:45:11] grace for you I can tell you friends
[1:45:14] every one of us we have not experienced
[1:45:16] this kind of extreme things but there's
[1:45:18] things that God has asked us to do or he
[1:45:20] said don't do or he say spoke to our
[1:45:23] hearts and when we don't continue in
[1:45:25] with it sometimes we can get around
[1:45:27] other people and you know I I don't know
[1:45:29] this is what was spoke to my heart and
[1:45:31] all of a sudden through from here to
[1:45:34] there what God has dealt with our heart
[1:45:36] and what our will and our heart has been
[1:45:38] put up on the Altar and yet through
[1:45:40] those
[1:45:41] conversations from here to there we
[1:45:45] actually don't arrive there what's in
[1:45:49] here it becomes
[1:45:51] lessened and lessened W and lesson how
[1:45:55] does that happen because you have to
[1:45:57] battle right through these
[1:46:00] Gates reasoning right well you don't
[1:46:04] think God would want you to do that you
[1:46:06] don't listen you have to come to this
[1:46:08] place and your walk with God your walk
[1:46:11] with God has to be between you and God
[1:46:16] Amen you want the we want the
[1:46:18] effectiveness in our lives we want
[1:46:21] Christ to be effective it has has to be
[1:46:23] between us and him through that then our
[1:46:26] lives become channels for God to operate
[1:46:30] through here is this battle let me let
[1:46:32] me just try to wrap this up here here's
[1:46:34] this
[1:46:37] battle three
[1:46:39] days I just just was just meditating and
[1:46:42] pondering on this and I've looked at
[1:46:44] these things here three days I
[1:46:49] mean why didn't God just say take him
[1:46:52] out back
[1:46:56] you're going to offer him up now I could
[1:46:58] preach on Mount Mariah and go into
[1:47:00] Mountain Zion I go into all that but I'm
[1:47:02] saying why did God we understand there
[1:47:03] was a type but why did God say three
[1:47:06] days
[1:47:07] journey why didn't he just say take him
[1:47:10] out
[1:47:12] back God was showing here even in a type
[1:47:16] even if was it come to our life he could
[1:47:18] have placed it God could have placed it
[1:47:20] ever so close it's like this why not
[1:47:23] there's things that here when we come to
[1:47:25] the house of God and I I'll be honest
[1:47:27] there's things as we come here look
[1:47:29] friends I don't want you to ever put
[1:47:31] that things are way out here and it has
[1:47:33] to happen days later but this is what
[1:47:35] you need to be looking for if we can
[1:47:38] maybe just really our our our our Focus
[1:47:40] be so tuned into this is God the most
[1:47:44] important thing whether the
[1:47:45] manifestation takes place now or later
[1:47:49] let my heart be inclined Amen to your
[1:47:52] your will amen like David said thou has
[1:47:56] said chase after me my heart set after
[1:47:59] thee will I seek oh God God Speak to My
[1:48:02] Heart Lord let my heart be moved into
[1:48:05] position Lord that's what I want today
[1:48:08] not my intellect let my heart be moved
[1:48:10] into that place to say y the challenge
[1:48:13] is great the requirement is great but
[1:48:16] God speak to my heart drop Into My Heart
[1:48:19] Lord what's needed
[1:48:24] but as I walk these days in this
[1:48:27] journey brother Bram would say it like
[1:48:33] this the message why Christ speak he
[1:48:36] says we see the message come forth we
[1:48:39] Ser that we see the church rise to a
[1:48:41] place on the wings of the Holy Spirit
[1:48:43] until the power of God Thrills every
[1:48:45] person in there the glory of God Falls
[1:48:47] around and signs and wonders take place
[1:48:50] less than a week Satan is permitted to
[1:48:53] come into that
[1:48:58] congregation God doesn't move and then
[1:49:00] say oh no no no no no no no you can't
[1:49:02] touch
[1:49:04] them you know what it is it's the word
[1:49:06] being
[1:49:07] tested where has the where is the word
[1:49:09] at if the word's only listen if the
[1:49:12] word's only as deep as in our intellect
[1:49:15] it can be talked out of
[1:49:18] us but if the word's got to make its way
[1:49:20] to our heart amen we've got to St stand
[1:49:22] there like a real Steward on the inside
[1:49:24] and close off every other gate sometimes
[1:49:28] we we look at things like examples I was
[1:49:30] giving you last week of how that between
[1:49:32] the here and there where the grizzly
[1:49:35] bear God brought forth a grizzly bear
[1:49:39] the
[1:49:40] sister I can't remember her last name
[1:49:43] but here she is passing through a prayer
[1:49:45] line dealing with anxiety and
[1:49:47] nervousness is so bad and the spirit of
[1:49:50] God standing right there says you'll
[1:49:52] find out in about a year and a half from
[1:49:55] now it'll break yeah wow now God could
[1:49:58] have broke that right there right do you
[1:50:01] know what that was showing God's Got
[1:50:03] Confidence he knew what lay in her if
[1:50:05] you could have asked her the same way
[1:50:07] you would asked me I would say Lord I
[1:50:09] don't know if I can make it for 18
[1:50:11] months that's how my intellect would
[1:50:13] look at it that's how my flesh would
[1:50:15] look at it but God's looking deeper than
[1:50:18] the
[1:50:18] flesh he gave her a word and all of a
[1:50:21] sudden 18 months later she's driving in
[1:50:24] the car and the prophet said here the
[1:50:27] joy of the Lord filled the car and it
[1:50:29] broke I say when God has given you a
[1:50:32] word for healing don't ever turn that
[1:50:35] loose don't ever turn it loose because
[1:50:37] between here and there God will fulfill
[1:50:40] his
[1:50:41] word is that right the prophet when he
[1:50:44] came off of the mountain there and he
[1:50:47] says it on the wings of a snow white
[1:50:48] dove after God has revealed to him the
[1:50:52] deliverance and healing of your stomach
[1:50:54] trouble it's over it's finished and the
[1:50:57] prophet announces from the pulpit he
[1:51:00] said I'm not going to fear it no more he
[1:51:03] says God has healed me he didn't know
[1:51:06] that his healing was going to be coming
[1:51:08] in a few days but it wouldn't be on this
[1:51:11] side it would be on the other
[1:51:19] side God still kept his word yes he did
[1:51:22] true God still kept his word so Lord
[1:51:26] help us to leave our heart and our life
[1:51:29] there on the altar I want you to think
[1:51:32] of this here like with Abraham and I'm
[1:51:34] not going to I just refer to a few of
[1:51:36] these quotes that out of the same
[1:51:38] message Abraham's Grace Covenant you
[1:51:41] know brother brandom I love how the
[1:51:45] spirit of God will take us into these
[1:51:48] places to help us to see into this spot
[1:51:52] where you and and I are right the things
[1:51:54] we battle through after the word has
[1:51:57] been delivered to our hearts now on this
[1:52:00] 3day
[1:52:01] journey he leaves he leaves them and he
[1:52:04] tells those men this is what he tells
[1:52:06] them we just read it I and the lad are
[1:52:09] going to go Yonder and worship and come
[1:52:12] again brother Braham said the devil
[1:52:14] stood right beside Abraham and said you
[1:52:16] just told a
[1:52:19] lie the devil said you just told a a lie
[1:52:23] because God's asked you to offer him up
[1:52:27] but Abraham's Revelation is this is what
[1:52:31] God promised this is the evidence when
[1:52:35] God said I'll be the father of Nations
[1:52:37] this is the evidence right here and
[1:52:40] there's no way that God is going to take
[1:52:43] away this evidence but he'll raise it
[1:52:47] up let me tell you every time that God
[1:52:50] asked you and I to step into his word
[1:52:53] and surrender our will he'll always
[1:52:56] provide for you what is greater than
[1:52:58] what you walked up on Mount Mariah with
[1:53:02] hallelujah hallelujah Abraham walked
[1:53:05] down off Mount Mariah with a greater
[1:53:07] Revelation where the voice of God had
[1:53:10] said thy sea shall possess the gates of
[1:53:14] thine
[1:53:16] enemy hallelujah what put the RAM on the
[1:53:19] mountain Abraham's faith
[1:53:23] am Satan was trying to get him take your
[1:53:26] will off the altar take your heart off
[1:53:29] the altar but Abraham when all this was
[1:53:32] going
[1:53:33] on praise the Lord Satan speaking to him
[1:53:38] brother Braham said here's Abraham's
[1:53:39] response to the devil oh no it's not a
[1:53:42] lie there's something down in here that
[1:53:44] he tells me if I even have to kill him
[1:53:47] I've received him as one from the dead
[1:53:49] God could raise him back to Earth again
[1:53:51] the lad and I will return turn why
[1:53:53] because God already told me that through
[1:53:56] this land I will there will save Nations
[1:53:59] he changed my name put h on the end of
[1:54:02] my name you see what he's doing you see
[1:54:04] what he's doing he's doing the same
[1:54:05] thing that the prophet told us in spoken
[1:54:07] word or spiritual food and due season he
[1:54:09] said let this things that God is doing
[1:54:13] be accumulated in your heart right now
[1:54:16] let it build you up into the faith of
[1:54:18] this hour Abraham is reaching back that
[1:54:21] test that he facing right there where
[1:54:24] Satan is trying to get him and pull him
[1:54:26] back from surrender but he keeps on
[1:54:28] going back to the evidences this is what
[1:54:30] God did in my life this is what you this
[1:54:32] is what God did in my life God changed
[1:54:34] my name God brought me out of the year
[1:54:35] of Cales it was God's longsuffering for
[1:54:38] me when lot I let lot hang hang around
[1:54:40] and it was God's grace that allowed that
[1:54:42] separation to go he was able to go
[1:54:44] through
[1:54:46] evidences in his life that gave him
[1:54:49] strength that's right to continue to to
[1:54:53] submit
[1:54:55] himself to God's
[1:54:57] [Music]
[1:55:03] voice Braham said could you imagine what
[1:55:05] was slipping through Abraham's mind his
[1:55:08] human mind up there all of these things
[1:55:11] his intellectuals going
[1:55:14] on see his reasoning the reasoning
[1:55:17] coming in through the gate of reasoning
[1:55:19] how how's this going to be how you going
[1:55:20] to be a father man how you killed this
[1:55:22] boy that don't make sense you kill him
[1:55:24] God's asking you to do this how is this
[1:55:26] going to happen brother say he's going
[1:55:27] through all those intellects he's moving
[1:55:30] through all that he said but when the
[1:55:32] intellects begin to work there was a
[1:55:35] little buzzer on the inside that kept
[1:55:38] saying what did he believe me 25 years
[1:55:41] for
[1:55:42] though see that buzzer on the inside was
[1:55:45] that hid man of the
[1:55:47] heart when them when that wrestling
[1:55:49] match was going remember the prophet
[1:55:51] said you to have something on the inside
[1:55:53] that's able to break the toe hold of the
[1:55:55] devil ever felt like you've been in a
[1:55:57] place where you're ready to tap out oh
[1:55:59] yeah maybe for five of us we can go out
[1:56:01] in the parking lot and preach for five
[1:56:03] of us maybe at sometimes you've come to
[1:56:05] a spot and you feel like I'm ready to
[1:56:07] tap out it seems like how the enemy's
[1:56:09] got you you know in a headlock or he's
[1:56:11] got you in an arm bar he's got you in
[1:56:13] some way or maybe you're leg and you're
[1:56:15] getting ready to tap out but there's a
[1:56:16] hidden power on the inside that allows
[1:56:19] you to break that stro hold you know
[1:56:21] what that hidden power is it's the word
[1:56:24] of God to submit my will to God's Will
[1:56:27] and it breaks the hold of the enemy
[1:56:29] because greater is he that's in you than
[1:56:33] he that's in the
[1:56:34] worldall let me tell you what God has
[1:56:36] called you to do he's walking right with
[1:56:38] you he's leading you the whole way it
[1:56:40] was not when they got on Mount Mariah
[1:56:42] that God met him God was walking with
[1:56:44] them the whole time Abraham was fiing
[1:56:46] the whole time Abraham was casting down
[1:56:49] reasonings the whole time Abraham when
[1:56:51] things wanted to try to to come his way
[1:56:53] he stood on that word that's good yes
[1:56:56] sir that's so good say
[1:56:59] God God help
[1:57:01] us that this be the
[1:57:05] testimony in our
[1:57:07] lives we've had some Mission
[1:57:11] Walkers I've had some Mission
[1:57:13] Walkers
[1:57:16] yeah I remember one time God I just
[1:57:19] started preaching remember one time this
[1:57:21] is just this
[1:57:23] one of
[1:57:25] many man I I thought man here I am I'm
[1:57:29] going to preach and I was down down
[1:57:31] south and man I'm getting ready to go
[1:57:33] and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit on
[1:57:35] the way when I'm
[1:57:36] driving is telling me go over here to
[1:57:40] Jude and I want you to preach on
[1:57:42] this and I said I don't got no notes for
[1:57:46] that I don't got no notes for that I
[1:57:49] hadn't even sat down and real you know
[1:57:51] and you know what you say what did you
[1:57:54] do well I sat there and I battled and I
[1:57:57] wrestled in that hotel room you know
[1:57:58] what I did I preached a set of notes
[1:58:01] that I had and I didn't follow the
[1:58:04] lord it was one of the biggest
[1:58:07] flops and yet that service I had already
[1:58:09] preached it in other places that God had
[1:58:12] led me to preach it you know what it
[1:58:14] taught me it didn't mean that there
[1:58:15] still don't have those those times come
[1:58:17] but sometimes I wonder if that's why God
[1:58:19] will put it on me sometimes when right
[1:58:21] before I get ready to come out you'll
[1:58:23] change it and sometimes changing it it's
[1:58:27] only just I've got this but I know that
[1:58:30] inspiration is burning because it ain't
[1:58:31] about the length of notes you're always
[1:58:33] studying it's it's always be instant in
[1:58:35] season out of season ready for God to
[1:58:37] move but that's just one that's just one
[1:58:40] example it was like the same thing that
[1:58:42] were when God is this okay right it was
[1:58:45] like when God I you know 10 years ago
[1:58:47] when I stepped away resigned from
[1:58:49] teaching you know that very next year I
[1:58:52] called back my my principal and she said
[1:58:56] Sam she said we we could sure use your
[1:58:58] back here our scores have when it really
[1:59:00] went down she said you can come in and
[1:59:02] I'll tell you what she said you'll have
[1:59:04] you'll have a good you know we'll get
[1:59:06] you back on the salary you'll have
[1:59:07] insurance and and you know what you can
[1:59:09] name the hours you want all we want you
[1:59:12] to do is work on math through for the
[1:59:16] building man I thought about it the
[1:59:18] reason I thought about it was not
[1:59:19] because of those other things of
[1:59:21] insurance
[1:59:22] but I thought about it because the
[1:59:24] desire is you know you always like to
[1:59:25] help I like to see things go from here
[1:59:27] to there and you know to help and I said
[1:59:30] let me pray about it and I spoke to her
[1:59:33] and I said called her back about a week
[1:59:35] later I said Donna I
[1:59:38] said I'm not going to be able to do that
[1:59:41] and she
[1:59:42] said I understand I said you see I said
[1:59:46] everything that took place when I was
[1:59:48] there I was in God's will at that time
[1:59:51] right I said said that wasn't because of
[1:59:52] me I said I just happened to be a
[1:59:54] channel that God used God gave me wisdom
[1:59:57] I said but if I came back right now and
[1:59:59] it's not God's will I said it would be
[2:00:01] the biggest flop you ever saw I said
[2:00:03] it's not God's will for me to do that I
[2:00:06] said I'd love to help you out I would do
[2:00:07] anything I could and I'll tell you you
[2:00:10] know how it is when you're praying about
[2:00:11] things you come to a decision and
[2:00:13] sometimes you get you almost get
[2:00:15] scared because I'm looking at that part
[2:00:17] of it right there I'm like man I you
[2:00:19] know I have insurance again or you know
[2:00:22] you're looking at having you know the
[2:00:23] things some certain things and and you
[2:00:25] know the security and this and that
[2:00:27] you're kind of looking at different
[2:00:28] you're just kind of looking at things
[2:00:29] all around you and you almost you know
[2:00:31] you you you start almost trembling am I
[2:00:33] making the right decision am I making
[2:00:34] the right decision am am I doing the
[2:00:37] right thing but I tell you the more this
[2:00:40] is just from my heart that I from my
[2:00:43] heart saying Lord you know I want your
[2:00:45] will above everything that's right my
[2:00:48] wife was praying about it separately we
[2:00:50] had talked about it cuz that was going
[2:00:52] to be a decision there within the home
[2:00:54] and when we came back together and I
[2:00:56] told her I said this is where my heart's
[2:00:58] at on it and she said honey she said
[2:01:00] that's where my heart's on it too she
[2:01:02] said I know we're in God's
[2:01:05] will now I wish I could have that
[2:01:08] testimony for every single
[2:01:11] thing I'd really do you probably do too
[2:01:14] you've got some you've got some
[2:01:16] victories but we also have some Misha
[2:01:18] walkers in here too
[2:01:20] right but God would allow this example
[2:01:23] for you and I that you and I can see
[2:01:27] that through this whole journey there's
[2:01:28] going to be tests but let me tell you
[2:01:31] there's also Grace just like there was
[2:01:33] for the prophet there was Grace for him
[2:01:38] God never cast him away God never said
[2:01:40] you're not going to be my Prophet God
[2:01:42] never said I'm not going to use you no
[2:01:43] more that's not what God Said but what
[2:01:46] happened is is he had to recognize where
[2:01:49] he had went astray
[2:01:52] where he let his heart get away he had
[2:01:56] to recognize that and I'm glad that God
[2:01:59] I'm glad that he was man enough to allow
[2:02:00] us to read these
[2:02:02] things cuz he could have just edited it
[2:02:05] out where you and I did not see the
[2:02:08] humanity of the prophet he could have
[2:02:11] edited that out but God allowed that to
[2:02:13] be seen for you and I you know why
[2:02:15] because you and I go through the same
[2:02:18] battles I just say this to wrap to W
[2:02:21] wrap this portion up on this between
[2:02:23] here and there just on this message
[2:02:25] here the battle from when God speaks to
[2:02:28] our heart in a service whether it's a
[2:02:31] special meeting it's a service right
[2:02:34] here it's a moment at that time that
[2:02:37] God's drawing Upon Our
[2:02:40] Hearts and our heart that's the most
[2:02:42] important thing is Lord let my heart be
[2:02:46] surrendered whatever God's dealing with
[2:02:48] your heart just take it and I tell you
[2:02:50] just go to prayer about it you don't
[2:02:52] even you don't have to go out and and
[2:02:54] discuss it across the dinner just go to
[2:02:55] prayer about it begin to fellowship with
[2:02:58] God about it say Lord this is what this
[2:03:00] is what you're speaking to my heart I I
[2:03:02] don't want I don't want to result and go
[2:03:04] back to my reasoning I've I've done that
[2:03:06] too many times Lord i' I've resoled to
[2:03:08] this reasoning I've went to this and
[2:03:10] I've went to that I don't want to walk
[2:03:12] by my reasoning that's why God's calling
[2:03:14] us as Abraham's seed to
[2:03:16] separate from all of those Gates I don't
[2:03:21] want to be in influenced by my
[2:03:23] reasoning I don't want to be influenced
[2:03:25] you don't either Lord let me continue to
[2:03:30] die to myself the things that God asks
[2:03:33] us to do Lord I want it I want to
[2:03:35] continue to submit myself to your voice
[2:03:38] that has spoke to my
[2:03:40] heart that this word would come to pass
[2:03:43] in my life how many times let's just Tak
[2:03:46] it on a bigger Spectrum here how many
[2:03:49] times since God's got a hold of your
[2:03:50] life how many times the enemy's tried to
[2:03:52] talk you it's no use no use look at you
[2:03:58] you're a failure it's no use how many
[2:04:00] times he's tried to talk you out of what
[2:04:02] belongs to you right that's right he's
[2:04:05] tried to talk out of you what God has
[2:04:07] spoken into your heart you know they try
[2:04:10] to get you in a corner somewhere like
[2:04:11] somebody getting around say hey come
[2:04:12] here come here you hear hear this about
[2:04:14] the boss and like oh no come here come
[2:04:15] here you got to hear this come here you
[2:04:17] got to hear this well if it's So
[2:04:18] Glorious why do we got to go in another
[2:04:20] room

[2:04:24] do he likes to get you isolated he like
[2:04:26] to get you in one of them closets where
[2:04:28] you can't even move your
[2:04:30] shoulders try to get you wedged in in
[2:04:32] your mind and try to lay everything out
[2:04:34] well if you do this you make this choice
[2:04:36] I tell you what oh man what this is
[2:04:38] going to happen for your family oh no
[2:04:39] say Lord if this is what you're leading
[2:04:42] and how you're leading me then give me
[2:04:44] the
[2:04:46] grace for this to come to
[2:04:48] pass and to stay with it amen is that
[2:04:53] your heart's
[2:04:56] desire oh God help us let us let us stay
[2:05:00] there on that place on the altar between
[2:05:02] here and there because one of these
[2:05:04] mornings one of these mornings will be
[2:05:07] changed in a moment and a twinkling of
[2:05:10] an eye you love
[2:05:14] him see sometimes this is why the things
[2:05:16] that even and just these are the things
[2:05:19] friends these these these thoughts that
[2:05:20] God has placed in my heart just sharing
[2:05:22] from my from my heart sometimes these
[2:05:24] are the things why sometimes we're we're
[2:05:26] we're the enemy who come around and and
[2:05:28] whisper in people's ears and they
[2:05:30] somehow lose interest oh well God's not
[2:05:32] interested in me and God doesn't care
[2:05:34] about me and my was in such a powerful
[2:05:37] service but look at me no no no no let
[2:05:40] me just say this and I and I say this
[2:05:42] without without anything to put any down
[2:05:44] but let's just put the devil on
[2:05:46] notice we don't have to have a pity
[2:05:48] party that's still about self that's
[2:05:51] that's right what to recognize is what
[2:05:54] God dealt with your heart on you got

[2:06:17] to I don't want to take my heart off the
[2:06:19] altar I don't want to take Lord things

[2:06:23] there God provides what's needed you

[2:07:28] frustration sometimes Lord on the things
[2:07:31] that
[2:07:32] we cannot see and don't
[2:07:36] understand on what's going on
[2:07:40] Lord but you
[2:07:43] father you help us to see in the
[2:07:47] simplest of our lives and our journey
[2:07:52] Lord how many times that
[2:07:54] Lord we've all
[2:07:57] had and we will continue to have Lord of
[2:08:00] this experiences every promise of God
[2:08:04] that we
[2:08:05] receive Satan will always be there to
[2:08:07] contest
[2:08:09] it thoughts Lord like went through
[2:08:12] Abraham's mind
[2:08:15] reasonings where Satan wanted to try to
[2:08:18] move into that gate of reasoning but
[2:08:22] Lord
[2:08:25] Jesus you're the very strength of our
[2:08:27] life
[2:08:29] Lord realizing Lord that when
[2:08:33] we have been right here Lord in a
[2:08:35] service in a moment in your
[2:08:38] presence it's a Time Lord where you will
[2:08:40] deal so personally with us
[2:08:43] Lord how many times Lord where we come
[2:08:47] into that place and our hearts are
[2:08:49] just come to a place of being prostrated
[2:08:53] in your
[2:08:55] presence Lord where you would move our
[2:08:57] hearts to that
[2:08:59] place and say Yes
[2:09:01] Lord not my will but thine be
[2:09:06] done
[2:09:08] Lord there was a battle in Gethsemane
[2:09:11] and there was a
[2:09:13] prevailing that was done
[2:09:18] there
[2:09:20] father all the way back lord to the mind
[2:09:24] of
[2:09:25] God to the very Heart Of God then Lord
[2:09:29] as it comes to our lives Lord there's
[2:09:33] times
[2:09:35] Lord we have to Lord throughout you
[2:09:37] showed us the second time not my will
[2:09:41] thine will be done a third time not my
[2:09:44] will thine will be done Lord let this
[2:09:47] cup pass from me
[2:09:51] [Music]
[2:09:53] Lord
[2:09:54] Jesus forgive us
[2:09:57] Lord where we've
[2:10:01] allowed oh
[2:10:04] God the enemy to have
[2:10:08] leverage we've pulled back on different
[2:10:10] things Lord the enemy could whisper
[2:10:13] things in our
[2:10:14] minds Lord sometimes maybe
[2:10:18] Lord like Lord how the enemy tried to
[2:10:20] whisper through through Peter don't no
[2:10:22] you don't need to go to
[2:10:24] Calvary Lord just like it was Lord
[2:10:27] through Mrs brombeck
[2:10:29] [Music]
[2:10:30] Lord one way Lord that you can hear that
[2:10:34] Lord a mother that was wanting the best
[2:10:38] interest Lord for
[2:10:39] her
[2:10:43] daughter but yet
[2:10:45] father what she wanted was not the best
[2:10:49] interest in your
[2:10:52] eyes the best interest
[2:10:56] Lord was for her daughter hope and
[2:10:59] brother brandom to be out on the
[2:11:02] field ministering the
[2:11:05] gospel that was the best
[2:11:08] interest Lord help
[2:11:11] us we lord are surrounded and
[2:11:14] encompassed with
[2:11:15] infirmities the carnality of this life
[2:11:18] sometimes Lord things that Lord Lord
[2:11:21] that when
[2:11:22] we lord God just rubbing shoulders every
[2:11:26] day sometimes the environments and the
[2:11:27] pressures Lord the pressures are so
[2:11:30] great nowadays they're greater than
[2:11:32] they've ever been
[2:11:34] Lord that's because Lord the darkness is
[2:11:38] being pressed
[2:11:40] together it always gets darkest right
[2:11:44] before the breaking of the
[2:11:47] day Lord the Rapture is upon us Lord
[2:11:53] I pray Heavenly
[2:11:55] Father May our hearts Lord God be
[2:11:59] found I want to be deeper Lord in
[2:12:03] you not in myself not in my
[2:12:06] will but in your will
[2:12:09] Lord Lord I pray right here this morning
[2:12:12] Father you know the needs throughout
[2:12:14] this
[2:12:15] congregation you know the hearts
[2:12:18] Lord I pray heavenly father that you
[2:12:21] would
[2:12:21] by your divine grace Lord may you move
[2:12:25] down lord in such a way
[2:12:27] Lord Lord if there's any harder life
[2:12:30] that's gotten off
[2:12:31] track may they Lord God receive your
[2:12:35] grace
[2:12:36] Lord father to be able to recognize the
[2:12:40] wrong and to step right back in
[2:12:44] line I'm minded Lord that the prophet in
[2:12:47] that vision and preview of The
[2:12:49] Bride there was some at the tail end the
[2:12:52] very last part they got their eyes on
[2:12:55] the
[2:12:55] world got their eyes on the church
[2:12:58] system got their eyes on the things of
[2:13:00] the world and they got out of
[2:13:03] Step but the voice of
[2:13:06] God called out get back in
[2:13:13] line Lord that's what you call to our
[2:13:15] hearts
[2:13:17] Lord sometimes Lord our hearts our
[2:13:19] emotions Lord some sometimes Lord the
[2:13:22] things Lord in our life can get so out
[2:13:25] of line
[2:13:26] Lord and we know it just doesn't happen
[2:13:29] Lord we know there's things that lead to
[2:13:31] that help us Lord just through the
[2:13:34] simpleness Lord of things that you've
[2:13:37] charged us with here this morning taking
[2:13:40] Lord
[2:13:42] preparations
[2:13:44] precautions laying Lord in your presence
[2:13:48] Lord father from what just started right
[2:13:51] here in the house of God where the
[2:13:53] spirit of God has moved upon our hearts
[2:13:56] Lord and our hearts are submitted to
[2:13:59] you Lord
[2:14:01] Jesus it don't have to be right here
[2:14:04] inside of these
[2:14:07] walls where manifestations take
[2:14:10] [Music]
[2:14:11] place we thank you for it Lord but we
[2:14:15] know it's not confined to these
[2:14:17] walls I'm thankful for every
[2:14:20] manifestation thankful dear God for
[2:14:22] every miracle that you have done even
[2:14:24] Within These Walls because some Lord
[2:14:27] maybe wouldn't have never seen it and we
[2:14:30] need that
[2:14:32] lord it's
[2:14:34] necessary but
[2:14:37] father the greatest
[2:14:41] value is to be able to take you at your
[2:14:45] word to obey your
[2:14:49] voice help us
[2:14:51] Lord whether we're on day one day two
[2:14:55] God help
[2:14:58] us he had to climb Mount Mariah he had
[2:15:02] to
[2:15:04] ascend through a rugged
[2:15:07] territory but
[2:15:09] father you were leading Abraham that's
[2:15:13] where you're leading us Lord as Sons and
[2:15:15] Daughters of Abraham help us
[2:15:18] Lord God give strength I pray throughout
[2:15:21] this congregation
[2:15:23] lord lord of things that maybe you've
[2:15:26] dealt with hearts here this morning I
[2:15:28] know you have Lord there's things Lord
[2:15:31] that you would have us go back in our
[2:15:33] minds maybe things that we've let up on
[2:15:36] Lord things that we should have Lord
[2:15:39] held
[2:15:41] to but father just like the prophet said
[2:15:45] how Satan he's permitted to come right
[2:15:48] after the glory of God with fall your
[2:15:52] Prophet would tell us in another place
[2:15:54] in the message how Satan will try to
[2:15:56] knock the confidence out of us that God
[2:15:58] has instilled in our hearts on that
[2:16:01] Sunday
[2:16:02] morning Lord help
[2:16:05] us help us Lord I
[2:16:08] pray help us
[2:16:11] Lord help us Lord Jesus we love you Lord
[2:16:16] how we appreciate you Lord for your
[2:16:18] mercies Lord like Abraham Lord he was
[2:16:23] looking he was looking for that
[2:16:25] [Music]
[2:16:27] mountain Lord when he saw it that's when
[2:16:31] Lord God they made their track up that
[2:16:35] mountain oh
[2:16:37] God what you've spoke to our hearts and
[2:16:40] youve called to our hearts may we look
[2:16:42] for that manifestation in our lives
[2:16:46] Lord maybe it's things Lord that you've
[2:16:48] spoken so clearly for us to lay aside to
[2:16:51] separate
[2:16:53] from Lord God you'll never ask us to do
[2:16:57] anything that you haven't already
[2:16:59] done you'll never ask us to do anything
[2:17:03] that your grace will not prove
[2:17:04] sufficient to see us through Lord help
[2:17:08] us Lord I pray God throughout the
[2:17:11] congregation Lord for the hands that
[2:17:13] were lifted up Lord for the hearts Lord
[2:17:16] that are
[2:17:17] here Lord may you minister to each of
[2:17:21] their
[2:17:22] lives minister to their hearts
[2:17:26] Lord touch them Lord strengthen them
[2:17:30] Father in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:17:36] Christ
[2:17:38] oh I want to
[2:17:43] leave the
[2:17:46] way he wants
[2:17:49] me to
[2:17:52] and I want to give oh my maybe if you
[2:17:56] like to
[2:17:57] stand there's just no
[2:18:02] more to
[2:18:04] give I want to
[2:18:09] love love till there just
[2:18:15] no more love for I could never
[2:18:22] never I
[2:18:25] love
[2:18:28] the you
[2:18:33] know even when you've made a statement
[2:18:36] some moments ago and it comes back to my
[2:18:38] heart my
[2:18:40] mind and I made this statement about if
[2:18:43] my wife or my
[2:18:46] children you know when you think about
[2:18:49] Abraham brother B knew he said regarding
[2:18:52] lot he said he knew how hard it was for
[2:18:55] Abraham he said so God helped
[2:18:59] him God helped him God gave him strength
[2:19:03] he loved
[2:19:04] lot things like I've talked about with
[2:19:07] with my boys and my wife it wouldn't be
[2:19:09] that I don't love them but you you
[2:19:12] understand what I'm saying it's where
[2:19:14] it's
[2:19:16] Lord It's You above everything else that
[2:19:20] that that's the way it has to be you
[2:19:22] know sometimes we can become so
[2:19:24] interested in trying to keep something
[2:19:28] you know let's just say for example
[2:19:30] let's say let's say it was one of my
[2:19:31] boys and my one of them going astray
[2:19:34] let's say that I went astray with them
[2:19:37] to try to somehow win them back I
[2:19:39] wouldn't win them
[2:19:41] back it would it would it would drive
[2:19:43] them further
[2:19:44] away matter of fact then the then then
[2:19:47] the effect would be in my life it would
[2:19:49] be the further effect in my on you said
[2:19:52] well then how do you win them win them
[2:19:54] by staying true to the
[2:19:55] Lord because that scripture I read right
[2:19:58] here the Bible Never Said by faith
[2:20:00] Abraham it says through
[2:20:03] faith
[2:20:05] Sarah received strength to conceive
[2:20:10] seed if there's going to be a channel
[2:20:13] for God to move through in my home Lord
[2:20:16] let me be that
[2:20:17] channel let me be that channel let me be
[2:20:20] that
[2:20:21] like like that garden hose that's hooked
[2:20:22] up out here in order to get that water
[2:20:24] in other places that hose is only a
[2:20:26] conduit that hose doesn't have any water
[2:20:28] in it it only allows the water that
[2:20:30] comes in to travel that's all it
[2:20:34] does Lord God let me just be a
[2:20:37] channel let me be an
[2:20:40] instrument that his life can flow
[2:20:43] through because you know what the same
[2:20:45] God think about it the same God that
[2:20:47] touched your heart touched your life
[2:20:50] it'll will be the same God if there's
[2:20:52] something to be touched there it will
[2:20:55] have to be the same God to touch their
[2:20:58] lives that's why we have that confidence
[2:21:01] in
[2:21:02] him I want to
[2:21:04] leave the
[2:21:07] way that he wants me me to live I
[2:21:14] want
[2:21:17] again until there is just
[2:21:21] no more no
[2:21:23] more
[2:21:25] give I want you
[2:21:29] love love till there's just
[2:21:35] no more for I could
[2:21:41] never ever out
[2:21:44] love
[2:21:47] the oh
[2:21:50] I want to live Hallelujah the
[2:21:57] way he wants me to live and I want I
[2:22:03] want to
[2:22:06] give
[2:22:07] until there's just no
[2:22:14] more I want you love I want to love love
[2:22:20] till there's just no more love for I
[2:22:28] could
[2:22:30] never ever I

[2:33:36] meditate upon these things the
[2:33:39] encouragement that you've ministered to
[2:33:41] our hearts Lord as that's what you've
[2:33:44] come to do
[2:33:46] Lord Lord Jesus
[2:33:50] as even in this moment and we walk
[2:33:53] forward through the rest of the day
[2:33:55] should you T through tomorrow the next
[2:33:58] day Lord
[2:34:02] Jesus we don't know when Lord that

[2:34:13] ready Lord Jesus we trust
[2:34:17] you there's things Lord that you'll deal
[2:34:19] what you've dealt with our lives
[2:34:21] on Father maybe things that we've
[2:34:24] battled through for
[2:34:25] years but we trust you you never asked
[2:34:29] us how you never asked Abraham
[2:34:32] how Abraham did not
[2:34:35] know what was going to take place on the
[2:34:38] mountain he only
[2:34:41] knew I'm going up to the mountain with
[2:34:44] Isaac and we're going to come back down
[2:34:48] together it was not up to
[2:34:51] him to try to figure
[2:34:55] out how things would
