glad to have him here and uh with um as he's here I think we just use the gift so he's going to minister for us T tonight and then uh on Sunday Sunday morning the Lord willing and I didn't know if he'd be up to it tonight or not but um he's going to minister here for us and uh so we just want to pull on the gift of God God knows what what we have need of tonight anden knows just how to speak so directly to our hearts and I know we know that but I just know how God is able to so take a service and so design it to speak directly to our needs and we that's that's the kind of God we serve he's that personal and uh um so also I just want to make just a couple announcements as brother Jerry's coming um this coming Friday and I already sent that out to our youth at uh the uh tomorrow evening that that Bible study there at our home that's cancelled uh for the Youth and we'll try to get that rescheduled here for this sometime here hopefully in this month um and then posted on the bulletin boards in the in the restroom as well as it was sent out in the email so if you don't have an email or you don't read your email or you don't know what email is you can take a picture of the announcement on the bulletin board and that has all the information you need for sister Linda's viewing and funeral that that is there and the viewing is tomorrow night from 6:00 to 8:00 p.m. and then the service um will begin at 11:00 a.m. on um Saturday morning so we certainly they just ask you to remember that in prayer the family as well the Lord will just uh continue to minister to them there's there's one less Among Us and I know that sister Linda as after she came into that time of the surgery and prior to that a few years ago she wasn't able to make it on the Thursday nights but um she nonetheless many times was here and I I go went back through over the texts that she had sent me over the times after service was over and then even just recently and uh we're one less but uh Heaven's that much sweeter and uh she certainly stepping from this Veil into that there's no more suffering we're not praying for lung acceptance we're not we're not she doesn't have to worry about all of the conditions of this life any longer and I'm glad that not only that heaven is a real place but I'm grateful that we have that reality in our hearts of that that land and what he's done for us that we know that when our journey here is over if it's prior to the Rapture or in the rapture we have a body that is waiting amen reserved in the heavens not made with the hands we we that's a real peace to our hearts and our lives and she was ready to go uh not just ready spiritually but she was ready to go uh and we can see that so we're so thankful for that just continue to keep the family in prayer we'll certainly miss her but we we know this right here that we'll see our sister again and uh so let's just if we could stand here maybe change our position amen as we just want to maybe sing that course one more time as we just invite brother Jerry and so glad to have him here with us and uh so we just want him to take his Liberty have your way oh just [Music] away oh holy spirit fill our hearts and have your wait as we wait oh and as we wait we wait on you Lord and as we pray pray we pray unto you speak your word into our hearts and have your [Music] way you know when a when a Christian someone born um they you know it's actually a joyous time it's not really I mean we we grieve because we miss their presence here but it's actually a joyous time uh they went to a homecoming you know there was those there ready to greet them and meet them immediately actually to as soon as they went to leave this body there was already Saints greeting them to you know to take them on over to the other side remember brother brandham uh testifying uh what hope said when she was dying and he went in there and and she says I don't he called her back he said I don't got much time and oh they're coming I've got to go you know and uh so you know it's a joyous time for them and they're not grieving no right and uh you know remember hope I always think about it she had two babies and but when he called her when brother brandom called her back she said why did you call me back she didn't want to come back to this life it's so joyous that's right you know so uh so it it you know we say unfortunate uh circumstances to come together but it's actually it's a glorious time among the Believers you know so uh I'm happy to see you and let's just go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we thank you Lord tonight dear God and Lord I I see this message that you laid in my heart father as I was uh Gathering and my thoughts Lord from the long trip father I I wasn't even putting together why you were dirting me this way it wasn't connecting until I got up here in the pull pit Lord but God I ask that you'll just guide me now father anoint me father to bring this message Lord to be a a help to the people I pray in Jesus name amen amen if you would turn with me in your Bibles is 2 Corinthians chapter 5 um as you might have noticed I said when I was praying I you know uh it was a long trip up and uh I U I spent yesterday uh most of it getting my things together to come and then I I tried to lay down and and sleep and I I just couldn't get to sleep and so finally I just got up and and left about 10:00 last night our time which be 11:00 here and I just drove straight through and uh so uh I got a little sleep this afternoon but Samuel had called me earlier and asked if I'd speak so I said well let me just pray and let me take a look and see what the Lord would have and and I I just felt pulled to this message tonight and but I wasn't making the mental connection to why God was pulling me to it and until I got up here in the pull pit and felt the anointing so let's read from 2 Corinthians chapter 5 for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this Tabernacle do groan being burdened not uh for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life amen you may be seated you realize when God uh was addressing through uh the John the Revelator about th this age this last Church age that when God addressed this last Church age one of the things he he said about it about the people and you realize when God's addressing the age uh when of each age you realize that U he he's not actually if you read there in the book He's not actually addressing uh people that have no profession he is actually addressing the church and he's addressing people who have a profession of Christianity and and so uh when you look at him addressing them here in Revelations 3 and he's talking about this last Church age uh he actually addressing these professed Christians he tells them you you're naked and and you don't know it and and and he says uh uh I I counsel you to buy me gold tried and the fire thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness does not appear so they you know uh naturally you know we say they're close they they they're clothed with uh man's Creed spiritually they're clothed with their Church teachings spiritually but in God's eyes they're naked because they're actually not clothed with his word and and so uh you know and in Hebrews it tells us the word of God is quick and Powerful sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even dividing the sun Soul and Spirit and other joints of Marl zerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart neither is there any creatures not manifest in sight but all things are naked and open to the eyes of him whom we have to do and so God looks at them and and just like when when Jesus was here on Earth you know the the Pharisees and the priests and all they were clothed in in in their teachings of the law they were clothed in all their traditions and that but Jesus said you know uh hourly got this appearance but inwardly he said you're full of dead men's bones so Jesus actually called their hand on the whole thing and he's showing them you're you're actually not clothed and so uh you know so uh those that that that that actually don't come into Christ and you know a lot of people think well you know well I believe Jesus died for me I accept him as my savior and and that's all it takes but but it's not actually uh you you you actually got to actually accept that and become part with that and actually accept Christ into your life to actually uh uh make a change in you to to you know there has to be a a spiritual change that happens to an individual before there can ever be a a a physical change without that spiritual change there won't be a natural physical change and and you know so uh and then I I think about then talking about the body this body that uh that Paul was speaking of here in Corinthians this uh this building of God that's not made with hands and and and I thought about you know even in the Book of Genesis there at the beginning that uh after Adam and Eve had partook of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil you know they they realized they they were naked they said you know and so uh they they tried to make them something to clothe themselves but then they heard the voice of God walking and when they heard the voice of God why they uh uh they they realize no matter what we've done we are going to be naked before him but but the thing what I want to point out to you was that actually that it says they heard the voice of the Lord God walking you know now you can't hear a voice walking so the Lord God was actually actually in a had was in a body that came down in the cool of the evening and fellowshipped with Adam and Eve in the cool of the evening they had fellowship with him before the fall you know and and so after the Disobedience to to God then there they were naked and then after this time God no longer came down and and and actually fellowship with them like he had done because man had put himself out of fellowship with God and and so but uh so he but God actually had come down he was walking in a body you know that when uh Abraham was in the plains of memory that that we find that that he he looked and and saw three men come walking and and when and you know and you know when there was two angels that went down to lot then later and lot said my lords but Abraham looks sees the three but there's one that's more prominent to him and he says my Lord singular you know and it was God that had come down and hear two angels with him and friends they weren't Spirits floating around they were walking in bodies and the body that they were walking in Abraham said if I found favor in thy sight come and sit down with me let me feed you let me give you some milk let me slay make some meat and bread for you to eat and they sat and they ate with Abraham God was in a body sir Hallelujah good preacher Hallelujah yes sir and so Paul says if this Earthly house this flesh which we know this flesh after the fall we realize then this flesh started it it dies you know and and so there there's look I'll tell you what you can pump this thing full of vitamins you can put it on all kinds of diets you can do everything you want you can drink Health drinks and everything else it's still dying that's right that's right because it's under the curse of sin and death that's right that's right we know that Jesus Christ came to pay for our Redemption but what that actually does for us here and now it actually it's the Redemption of our souls the body we're living in friends is not in a redeemed state yes sir it fails us it's getting old it it changes and and it's dying and eventually it's not going to be able to hold us any longer it's a corruptible home but but Paul said but the thing is when this corruption is dissolved he said we've actually got a body waiting yes sir we're not going friends look brother R said some people thought well you know when they die you know they just float around they just go they're remain like in his Spirit no there is a body according to the scripture and it's not a body we got to wait for it to be formed it's waiting on us remember when brother Bram said when you hear this message and you recognize it to be Eagle food he said you have actually heard from that body the theophany remember when brother bam said Jesus went and talked to the woman at the well and and he had went down to the priest of the temple and brother bam said what was the difference between the priest at the temple and the woman at the well he said the woman at the well had representation she had representation in heaven what was it it was the theophany and when Jesus come down there and spoke to her at the well she heard from that body that was waiting for [Applause] herall now Paul says you know flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God he said but I show you a great mystery we shall not all sleep that means we shall not all die right but whether you die or whether you're alive he said we're all going to be changed we're going to receive a new body Hallelujah now and and and you know Philippians said the Lord Jesus Christ who's going to change our vile bodies to be like to his glorious body so when a when a saint dies uh there is there is a tabernacle a body a house a building waiting on them already for their their soul to go right into sir but it's not a glorified body brother bam said when he went beyond the curtain of time and he he saw them there he said they were in uh theophany bodies he said but they didn't need to eat they didn't need to sleep they didn't need these things and that you know he said but they were real he said I could touch them they hugged me I could talk they could talk I could hear them you said it was [Applause] real but now when the resurrection happens then it said you know uh the dead in Christ shall rise first and then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up to to meet uh together with them to meet him in the air but the thing that happens is they've got to come back and brother bam says that theop body therein it comes back and he says and it picks up flesh again and and but in a glorified [Applause] State and and we which are here friends look you think about it say in a moment in twinkling of eye how quick is that that's quick you know what happens is your friends look the theophany and and and that comes to meet you here and and this this these 16 elements that you're made up out of the molecules of this body friends there it's changed in a moment in twinkling of an eye and the theophany that glorified just comes together that quick oh my hallelujah oh what a Time Hallelujah when Jesus died on the cross and and the Bible tells us he descended into hell and he went and he preached to the souls that were in prison Jesus what happened when Jesus died on the cross he went into a theophany body the the body of Flesh that was hanging there that was the body of a man friends look it's it was the same kind of Flesh that you walk around in that flesh got old that flesh got tired that flesh at 33 looked like it was 50 and and and you know and it got tired and and and and and and and it he he had to uh struggle with the flesh yes sir right but they took that flesh down and put it in the Tomb but Jesus wasn't in that flesh he had already left that corrupt that was a corruptible body I want you to realize that that was not an immortal body it had to be a body just like ours because God wanted to come down and feel what we feel the Bible tells us that amen yes sir and so they took that body to a tomb but Jesus he had immediately went into a theophany body brother brandom said and descended into hell preached to the souls that were imprison that repented not in the days of Noah and then LED captivity captive came back up and remember he said when he he met uh them there in in in in in the the the the where the cemetery there was by the tomb and he said don't touch me he hadn't been R into that glorified body yet but then Jesus comes back look David said uh um I I have this uh hope in my flesh My Flesh has hope because he will not uh allow his holy one to see corruption he will not leave his soul in Hell or let his body see corruption but on the third day he rose again that thean he came back up and it picked up that flesh the molecules changed in that body you say what are you talking about the molecule change think about it friends go back into the Book of Genesis and look what happened to the serpent that's good that's good God cursed the serpent what happened to him his form changed his whole molecular structure instantly changed and he went from being a a beast to to to being a a like a reptile we look at today he said you're curse from now on your on thy belly Thou shalt crawl and the dust shall be thy meat that's so that's how the body change happens these molecules there brother bam in another place brother bam actually Likens it to a a solar system and he says it it's got out of orbit it's Planet our planets are out of orbit and he said you know like the Earth uh got off its axis and so it changed everything and that's the way it is with us but one day it's going to be set back right now second Corinthians 5 where we're reading if you look in verse 10 it says for we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body according that he ha done whether it be good or bad knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men but we are made manifest unto God and I trust trust also are made manifest in your conscience now there's there's there's actually seven dimensions the first three dimensions is light matter and time and you know you uh you our sight contacts the dimension of light our uh our feelings contacts the dimension of matter and and that and then there's the dimension of time but then there's a fourth dimension and uh that fourth dimension is a dimension of Science and and brother B said the proof of it is he said you know look there's there's uh radio waves and television waves and all this passing right through this building he said but if the right receiver's there it can pick up those waves and and and bring it in where it can be viewed but it's here so he says he says I I can't really explain to you he said that that fourth dimension of science but it it they've proved that it's there but then brother Bram says The Fifth Dimension is where the sinner the unbeliever when he dies that's where he goes that Fifth Dimension he says is kind of a horrible Dimension and and and I thought of that when I thought of what Paul said there when he said the terror when Paul said talking about those that that died uh that uh that you know were not in Christ he said the the terror you know and so brother Adam says that that Fifth Dimension is where the center goes it's a horrible Dimension he says when a Christian dies he goes to the sixth Dimension remember when brother brandom went beyond the curtain of time he asked where was Jesus they said oh he's on up you know we've got to wait for the time of the Rapture and everyone gathered together and then we go to meet him and and that so brother R said that Jesus is actually in the seventh Dimension now there was a story that brother brandham tells about in in 1965 uh of an incident that happened and it was wrote in Tucson paper and brother said a a woman was driving out across the desert he said about 50 m an hour or so and he said uh There Was An Old Gentleman in an Overcoat that was walking on the side of the road and he stepped out and she struck him with her car and his and when she hit him driving that fast he was thrown up into the air and and landed flipped over and landed out in the desert there was cars back behind her with people in it that actually witnessed it happened saw the lady got stopped her car got out went to look for the man you know and and the people behind her stopped got out they all went to go look for the man they couldn't find him they called the police the police come down there they search they couldn't find anybody but then what they said was they said well years ago there had actually been an old man that that with that description that had been hit by a car there and killed and brother said look what it is he says when they when a when a sinner dies they don't have a body to go to they don't have a body waiting on them he said so he says what happens is he said they they've got no body to go to this body has died so they got no body to come back to he said so kind of caught in between and he said they're in a nightmare and and he says here this this sinner had died and here he's stuck in that in that Fifth Dimension and here that Fifth Dimension actually can be contacted touched from this Dimension that we live in wowow wow that hear these people living in the first three uh four dimensions you know they the car actually hit somebody they saw him fly up in the air but the whole time he was already dead he was already gone he wasn't even in a body he was stuck the terror brother says when a man has a nightmare he's not altogether asleep neither is he awake he's between asleep and awake that's what makes him he said have a horrible shaking and screaming because he's not asleep but he's not awake and he says and take that and that shows where a man goes when he dies unconverted he's lived his time up he's dead on Earth he can't go into the presence of God because he's not fit to go there without the blood and and he's caught and he cannot come back to the Earth because his time's finished here and he's caught between he's in a nightmare he can't go into the presence of God to rest he can't come back here to Earth because his time is up he's in a nightmare and there he stays until the day of judgment he said what a horrible thing so you think about every soul that was unconverted that has died back through time nobody to go to and all this time they've actually been in a nightmare wow a horrible time brother R said their soul is actually caught between Earth and hell he said they're caught between the two things in The Fifth Dimension he's got a soul but he can't go in the presence of God but because he's not covered with the blood he's a sinner he can't wake himself up because his time's up here on Earth he said so he's there in a tormented nightmare he's caught between Earth and hell now in the Book of Revelations it speaks about the voice of many Waters and brother bam actually says that that voice of many Waters he says it it's people he said but it it is the the Ministers of the gospel that these people uh that lived in their time and he says that uh when the Judgment comes and he says the book of The Sinner is open and he says the The Voice he said that they sat in those services and they heard the word preached and they went out and left or friend you say well there was people that that had that that never maybe was in our services but the thing about it is Friends the voes is here it's the voice of God the voice of many Waters it's many Waters but it's singular voice yes sir and they get and and so they're held accountable right and on that day that that voice th those that voice of many Waters brother ra said from the the the services they set in it'll play back to them I think about those friends that we have saw over recent years that have actually set and and heard the message and and and some of them even claiming to have preached the message and they've turned their backs on it they've turned their backs on the message they've turned their backs and and you know they call Brother Brenham false and everything else and and you know they can't just go on their merry way but they got to post things on the internet and they and they've got to uh make videos and everything else trying to discredit it right Jes think about when they show up on the day of judgment they're going to hear the voice of many Waters the one that they turned their back on brother B said what is his voice it's the Judgment the voice of the ministers through the holy spirit that cried out to the people in every age standing there the voice of many Waters cried out he says the preaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost he says what will it be to know that they sat in the meetings and he said you sat in the meetings and heard that you should get right with God and receive the Holy Ghost and refuse to do it right he said a drifting soul to hear that voice speak out in that meeting that that you said in and heard the Judgment of God preached and refused it the great fall is just below you the great cataracts that'll take you to Eternal Doom the voice of many Waters he says how you going to do when it's recorded in glory when The Voice toight night is recorded he said your voice is recorded he said your thoughts are recorded as a man thinketh in his heart so is he notice your heart your your thoughts are louder in heaven than your voice here is on earth oh what will it be in that day when that voice Thunders out of many Waters many Church ages he said forming out and he said now a a drifting Soul a poor Drifter that's drifting over the great cataract Yonder be careful it'll be a horrible thing when you know there's no saving for you then you can't get saved you know your doomed lies before you when you know within a few minutes you'll hear that voice speak out depart from me you workers of iniquity into Everlasting fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels and you'll know when you hear that great FSE roaring of those voices of those meetings while you passed out of this and oh that horrible thing what a nightmare oh he says and door to the heart he said let let me give you a sight that's sickly he said how many people have sunk beyond the regions of Mercy into the devil's hell and torment of a nightmare how they'd love to come back and have one more chance if they could do it tonight if Jesus would come uh uh to hell and knock on their door he said but you know he said oh oh Robert says he's a good God he said he is a good god he he said he said he's a god of Mercy he said and he's also a God of Justice judgement he said every sinner that that that dies he said a nightmare a death that's due every sinner every sinner is subject to death and deserves it because he's a sinner he deserves the death he deserves that great horror wow you think about all these famous people over the years actually some uh Within the lifetime of some of you sitting here that that were famous you know and and they they sold out for popularity and and fame and and of this life and everything else and and brother renam said like that talking about Elvis Presley selling out his Birthright and that you know and they sold out and you think about it today they're in a nightmare tonight and they've been stuck there since they'd left this life now we know that the Rapture is going to take place but we know there's uh when the Rapture takes place there's three and a half years of tribulation here for those that are left behind here on this Earth uh the brides in glory for three and A2 years and then you know comes the the the battle of Armageddon and we come back down to this earth and and take over and then we set up the millennial reign of a thousand years here on this Earth friends look uh that resurrection that happens prior to the uh Rapture in that only the Saints only those that are born again that have died in Christ they're the only ones that come up in that Resurrection all the others who have died they're still stuck in that Nightmare and they're in that nightmare during the whole thousand years of the millennial Reign that will be in and it isn't until actually after the Thousand Years Millennial range Reign when the the white Throne judgment is and that's when the Bible says that the the sea will give forth it dead the Earth will give forth its dead and all the dead shall rise brother and sister when they rise they they when they died a sinner they had no body waiting on them to go to like a Believer does he says when they come back here they've got to stand the Bible says in a body before the Judgment seat and he said the body they're going to stand in is the body that they lived in here the body they Ed in here and the things they done and and and they won't be able to say no I never had an opportunity I never heard because they're going to be standing there in the very body that they had lived in here hallelujah they won't be able to to deny anything now I told you that uh you know the uh the story that brother man relates it was out of the Tucson paper about the man walking the old man getting hit by the car and that and he said you know it was a he was in a nightmare it was a a sinner he was lost you know and and here he was stuck in that Fifth Dimension stuck between Earth and hell and and you know hear a car in this Dimension that we live in actually contacted him touched him affected him threw him back up in the air remember when brother brandham uh remember he said he didn't know whether it was a dream or what it was in that but he he relates remember his his wife and his his daughter hope uh and and Sharon Rose had died and and so brother bandam said he was walking and he said uh that that that he saw this young lady and she said hello Daddy and and and he said well I'm not old enough to be your daddy you know brother BR was just a young man back then and she said Daddy she said I'm your little Sharon Rose she said there's no we're no babies up here you know and and and see she she had received that body she had been changed and and there she was and and so she spoke to him and and she says I'm going to wait here on Billy and she said uh Mama's on up at the house and there was a house and so brother brandom went on up to the house now brother bam begins to relate this story about when he and hope you know hope was alive and and you know they didn't have much money and and they were very poor and and they' went out and and they had purchased him a chair uh uh you know an easy chair to sit in at the house and they were making payments on it and I can't remember the figure right now off top of my head but it was a very low amount if you think about it today but they they got to where they got behind they couldn't meet the payments and that and so the furniture store came back down and got that chair and repossessed it and and took the chair back and remember brother Brandon was coming home and and hope was uh she made him a a pie and made him his favorite uh meal and she got the little boys in the neighborhood to go out and dig up some worms and things and he came in she didn't want him to go in living she said let's just go fishing I got the boys to dig you some worms and things let's just go fishing she didn't want him to go in there he said no I don't feel like doing that finally then she goes and she broke down and she was so sad said they've took your chair well brother Brandon relates when he went there and he was goes on up to the house and he goes up to see hope and and and he greets hope and and there he is and hope said do you remember that chair he said yeah she said that chair is here and she said they can't take [Music] [Applause] it now you know if you're aware at all have ever heard about brother Perry green I I'll tell you brother Perry green he was here with brother brandom and that and after the death of BR brand he actually went out and he located all these different things out in the desert the mountain everything that brother bam gave a witness to and talked about that brother Perry green actually you know he was very uh uh creative and inventive of finding these places than that there was one place brother randam talked about it came into a pyramid in that and brother Perry uh got hired a a little private plane to fly him out there in in in in in the desert out there in Arizona and he was looking for that where the mountains brother Bram said it came together like a pyramid and so he was looking for it and and he couldn't find it and he's flying around he's looking all of a sudden the thought hits him and he asks the pilot can you turn this plane upside down and so the pilot said yeah sure so the pilot rolls that plane like that and when he rolled that plane like that right there the mountains coming down this way was what formed that pyramid that brother Ram talked about yes sir brother Perry see he was he was real good and about finding these things and that and all that so brother Perry gives a testimony of when brother brandham died you know and and they they had the car for a while that was in the the wreck and everything and all that you know and and that and so brother Perry got to thinking about that chair so brother Perry you know he was going to he he was he was going to go get that chair and so he he he goes down over to the F the the furniture store down there to find that chair and that and when he goes they said they looked for it and that in their their warehouse said we can't find the chair and so they they look through the records and that and they had never resold the chair and so they couldn't find it and so brother Perry gives testimony and he goes back to this testimony brother Bam's given where hope says the chair's here and they can't take it so I'm telling you friends a chair got took from this Dimension into the that sixth Dimension where the saved are the Born Again are and it cannot be touched by this Dimension she said they can't take it when a Believer dies we've got a body that's not built with hands that's waiting for us just waiting there for us our soul to go right into and I'm going to tell you friends it cannot be touched by this Dimension it's not affected by this mention you might be crying people might be grieving but they that have left here and went into that body they're not crying There Is No More Tears there is no more grief there is no more sickness there is no more dying amen it's a glorious thing it's a glorious homecoming hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah yes sir Hallelujah hallu and brother bam says this that body that they go into in that theophany and he says you know then it comes back to pick up the the 16 elements here and become a glorified body pick up the glorified body we're changed in the moment twink of the eye and here we are you know as I said the theop our theophany comes down to meet us and and then it all just comes right together and this body is changed and and and you know and then we we're we're caught up you know and then we we go to the marriage supp of the lamb and then we then we're there in the Millennium and and think about this you know in the time of Millennium it says that Satan will be bound for a thousand years and brother bam says that he says I it's not logging chains like he said he's bound with he said he's Bound by circumstance and the circumstance is that the body that the Believers are in cannot be touched by Satan it cannot be affected by Satan it cannot be tempted by Satan it cannot Satan can't touch it with sickness Satan can't touch it with death Satan can't touch it with mental issues Satan can't touch you with anxiety Satan can't touch you with depression hallu no more sugar diabetes no more heart attacks no no more high blood pressure no more cancer Hallelujah that's the circumstance he's Bound for a thousand years he can't touch us you think about it friends he's tormented Us in this life I'm going to tell you when we get that body changed it's going to be torment for the Devil he's going to be bound for A Thousand Years by circumstances don't you think he's going to give up and not try but you think about the torment he's going to be in because nothing he's going to try and do is going to have any effect on us we'll walk around I'm glorious and Victorious hallelujah it's Paul said look friends oh death where is your your your your sting grave where is your Victory he said death has been swallowed up in life David said Thou shalt show me the path of Life Hallelujah talking about Jesus said you know he'll not he suffer his soul to be in hell nor his holy one to see corruption he said he shall show us the path of Life Jesus Christ came friends he he walked in the same kind of body we're in he died in this body but he passed from this body into a theophany and then from that theophany he came back up from Hell Rose on the third day and came and received a glorified body and we shall be changed from this vile body into a body like his glory body he has showed us the path of Life Hallelujah glory and that body friends I told you the sinner they come up and the body they had no body to go to so the body they stand there in the day of judgment in it'll be the body they send in now we know we have received Christ so we've actually passed from from death into life to not even come into the Judgment or the cond nation and why because this body that you've lived in here you the things you may have done things you may have said acts you may have committed lies thieving adultery whatever it is you're not going to be in that body that those things happened in that body you stand in on that day that body will have never known the sin the degradation it'll never knowing the dregs that maybe your life was in you will not be standing there in this body you did those things in you're going to be standing there in a body that never did those things think about it brother Adam said first of all that we are spiritually we're Justified he said and what Justified means is it's just as if we never done it well I'm telling you friends on that day we're going to be standing there in the body that never done [Applause] [Music] it that's what it mean to be in a glorified body that's what it means to be in a perfect body Hall that's so good look in this life you know we we know we've give our lives to the Lord and God has done a change in our lives but we still got to deal with that memory of that old nature of that old man and the Satan comes every day and torments you and brings back to your memory sometimes touches you in your dreams when you're sleeping to bring back to you things you did and acts you committed and and sin that you done in this life and he torments you with it in your memory and sometimes you're just you're maybe on the job you're working you're doing something you know and a thought drops your head before you realize it you've actually dwell on that thing for several minutes and it's the devil torment you for those things I'm going to tell you friends that will be no memory of that thing [Music] anymore that's how perfect it's going to be that body that's waiting on us when we leave here that's how perfect it is that glorified body that we'll stand in on that day that's how perfect it is Satan not going to be able to come and say remember when you done such son no I don't no I got no recollection of that never happened never happened that's good but see that that look friends Jesus Christ paid for that sin he died for it so you could be cleansed from it he paid the price but somebody has still got to answer for it those that that die as Sinners and have no body to go to they're going to have to stand before the Judgment the body says and give an account for the Deeds they've done in the body they're going to have to answer for that but on that day you're not going to have to answer for that because you're not going to be in that body but the Devil's going to have to answer for [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it brother bam said in Hidden life in Christ he say some glorious day he said this little old body of mine it's melting away little grayhair mothers and daddies out there a few years ago you walked here her here to the altar a little sweetheart beautiful girl and now you look and and it's going away but one of these Glorious Days Jesus will come in from the presence of God and everything thing that we was at our best will return to again to be with him forever brother said God took a picture of you and you're going back to it I tell people all the time I tell you I love talking and preaching about the body Chang CU I'll tell you friends I look in the mirror and I say who in the world is this guy my grand kids look at pictures when me and I we got married and they said Grammy who in the world is that you standing by you know some people seems like they age and don't hardly you can't tell it and they don't change not me I don't look nothing like that fell I don't recognize this guy cuz in my mind I still look like that and one of these days brother brm said I'm going back to what I was at my best that's right remember he told he told his wife sister meia he said You know here I am going bald he said but I'm going to tell you what every hair I've not lost a one they're all there and when that body change happens friends all that hair is going to be there yes sir I'm going to tell you friends you know you know sometimes you have dreams about different things I I have dreams all the time about the body change and I dream that I get up early in the morning go in there and look in the mirror and I'm a young man with a head full of hair and before I realize it I'm standing there combing my hair and then it hits me in my dream oh my goodness I've changed Hallelujah and brother Ram said you know people ask you know when when when we we go there said and we we go in the Rapture and all that he said the the resurrection happen said will we know one another when we meet one another in glory and he said certainly we will know one another another he said there's three kind of bodies that we dwell in one's human the other is a Celestial and the other is glorified then if we know one another in the human body the Mortal body how much more that we'll know each other in that glorified body he said see he said the the law can produce a good thing how much greater than can Grace produce because it's greater than the law if the moon can produce a certain part of Light how much more will the sun outshine it when it comes will will certainly know one another that's yes sir hallelujah look when that Resurrection happens friends you know you've have maybe had loved ones and friends and other believers that you you were brothers and sisters and friends with here in this life and when they resurrect they'll come before you and you might have say well I met them later on in Life or whatever you know or or or maybe I I never met him in this life a grandfather or somebody you know and how am I going to recognize him and know him we'll know even as we're knowing that's hallelujah hallelujah it's a it's a spiritual thing friends what a great mystery Paul talks about he he calls it a great mystery what a great Revelation I'll tell you friends you think about well everything's been revealed yes but there are things yet that God has yet to show us for eyes have not seen and ears have not yet out heard of all the things of God hallelujah what a glorious time on that day you know but I'll tell you what friends a saint that dies here and leaves here friends I'm going to tell you what a glorious time yes it I had a sister several years ago that started coming to our church you know and she was uh she had a lot of health problems you know uh and and disease and things that she suffered with and and she suffered greatly in this body and uh you know her her her her family some of them that that they they claimed to be messy Believers back then they tried to get her to to move away and go down where they were and all that she said no she said God sent me here she said and God showed me she said that she she was living alone said God showed me brother brownie wants to be my pastor here she said so I ain't going anywhere she said I'm getting right by God and I'm getting ready and you know she would get in the hospital and and every time she would be in the hospital I'd go up to visit in the hospital and every time her name was sister Susan she would ask me the same thing brother Jerry am I going yet and I said I don't know Sister Lord ain't showing me anything I said I I don't know and so I'd pray for her you know and and God would touch her and she'd get well back out of the hospital you know back in her little apartment now and back coming to church you know and then before you know it she'd be back in the hospital again the last time that she went in the hospital you know you know they called me sent word to me she was in intensive care I went in there and her body was racked with so much pain and her legs had swelled up and had actually burst open and and and they couldn't lay her down because it was causing so much pain so they had her on this this kind of like a bed thing that they had her strapped to and they they tilted it up like this and and and and there she was strapped to that you know and she friend that the nurses said she knows the medication better than we do and and they were trying to give her something wanting to give her something for the pain and she says no no no you can't give me anything right now she said I need my pastor up here right now she said you can't give me anything t i SE and so I I got up there as soon as I could you know and I got up there and I went in and there she was strapped to that that that kind of a stretcher like thing and she said brother brownie is God going to raise me back up or am I going and I something just struck me and I said sister Houston how much greater healing could you want than to step into a new body in just the next few moments sir she said yes we prayed we were only allowed to be in there for just a very few minutes and they the nurses ushered us out I went back home um after I left the nurses later told me that soon as I left she told him you can give me the pain medicine now and when she did it it actually uh put her unconscious she went into kind of like a a coma like and so they moved her then from from there just to a room CU they said you know she's dying and so uh there was her family had gathered in up there and there was uh some some other folks that were professed Believers at that time and uh they were gathered there with her and I got a phone call from one of them they said brother Jerry could you come up here said uh I've got some things I need to say to her and could you come up here and pray that God will bring her back too so I can say some things I need to say and get get get my heart off my heart you know and so I I went back up there it was about 11:00 at night I went back up to Nashville it's about 45 minutes to an hour away from me and and I drove back up there I got up there and and there she was just laying there you know uh unconscious in the bed and things and U the family gathered around and and so uh I the nurse came in and when the nurse went to step back out I I I slipped back out of the room with her and I said uh I said you know I I'm her pastor and she said yeah I said uh C could you please could you please answer me this question I said if she was to come back conscious how would she be she said pastor she would be in so much pain she wouldn't be able to comprehend anything said her legs are busted open said it's just all over and said she her her body would be just filled with so so much pain I said all right thank you so I went back in the family and different ones and there was a lot of uh her family a lot of unbelievers and things like that and they were all gathered in there so I went over and I took a hold of her hand and I just prayed Within Myself I I I wasn't I wasn't praying to none of those people and they didn't need to hear what I had to say and so I just prayed with them myself while I was standing there by her bed holding her hand and I said Lord if there if everything is okay okay between you and sister Susan I said and everything's okay and there is nothing hindering her from going into your presence I said don't bring her back to I said take her on out of here Lord and so I I got done praying and and I told myself I got to go it was on Saturday night about 11 you know about 11 12:00 in that and I said I got to preach tomorrow and so uh uh I I left you know and a few minutes after I left I said they pronounced her dead she had passed you know but I'm telling you friend she suffered here in this life but I'm going to tell you she stepped into a new body you know and and you know as brother BR said when it comes my time to go I don't want nothing stopping me at the river I want to be a a cross over you know and and she was ready to go and when I'll tell you friends when a person is ready to go I I've been around folks that you know that we we have a tendency I was telling my mom earlier today I'm closing and and I had telling my mom earlier today you know we we have a t because we're humans we actually struggle to hang on to this life yeah do you know we get diseases sickness death everything you know we'll do everything we can to try to hold on to this life but I'd watched many Believers you know they they come to a place where I believe God actually just dropped something in their heart and they know it's their time to go and they're ready to go and they stop trying to fight to hold on to this life and they're just ready to leave out of here that's so good and in a moment friends they go from this old foued uh body to to a glorious body uh a theophany that that is already waiting there for them the Bible says hallelujah let's stand oh friends I'll tell you we talked about a nightmare tonight that the sinner dies and goes to and that but I'll tell you friends what you need to know what a glory that awaits the believer Hallelujah as David put it in the in the Psalms he says I have a hope because he said he'll not leave my Holy One In Hell nor see him see corruption and he'll show me the path of life so I have a hope David says hallelujah in my flesh
