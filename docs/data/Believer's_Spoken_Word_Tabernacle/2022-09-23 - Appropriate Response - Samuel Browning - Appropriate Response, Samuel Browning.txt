the ever-present help in the time of trouble you're our strength Lord father you see Lord tonight Behind these hands O Lord that are lifted up Lord some not able to be here Lord and no doubt sitting in their living room their hands are up to Lord we ask that God that for every need that you'll just move in a very special way Lord father just let it be settled Lord right here tonight with just an expectation Lord father things sometimes can trouble our minds Lord and things can come and worry and a lot of different things Lord you know about all of that Lord for Lord you became one of us Lord and so Lord Jesus we ask tonight Lord that you'll just come Lord we have a great confidence that our high priest is in the building tonight [Music] and Lord Jesus that you can hurt touched by the feeling of our infirmities Lord Jesus we need you tonight Lord Behind These uplifted Hands Lord there are needs that God it takes more than a mortal it'll take you Lord to minister to these needs tonight and we just invite you Lord that you would just be that personal right here tonight Lord and just the Lord I just want to give myself to you and this people Lord that God that you'll just come and speak to our hearts that Lord when it's all said and done that God that there would be no doubt that we have been in your presence Lord and that we have heard from you and that Lord you have spoken to our hearts Lord Lord we just didn't ask the Lord that you would have had your way now thank you Lord for your presence Lord [Music] I just pray Lord you'll just take control have your way minister to every need now in Jesus precious name amen and amen amen you'll turn with me to Joba chapter one I want to um say uh God bless you brother Sue sister Maribel God bless you good to have you with us I don't think I see any other visitors here but um I want you to pray about you see the piping that's out here and I just want for parents and so forth that are here and those are streaming and those that that will be here on Sunday just please um uh the children don't don't be standing on the pipe or going back there we're just Lord willing we want to try to get that pipe laid for the drainage and um we're looking at possibly here on Monday we don't know just how weather is going so we just the brothers we just asked that you just join in prayer with us and I think I probably mentioned that before but we're just be in prayer that God will just give direction whether it's holding off the rain or directing it on another day and came in today and we're thankful that for the rails that we saw put up out here and remember that's that's been through a different company where for the stairs were made all of these stairs and those railings and kind of just like everything else it's a well-known company in this area but it's just been a backlog of work and so the gentleman has you know he's apologized to us and said you know he said I'll definitely said because of your patience not pressing he said it will be lower than what even was quoted so uh we'll take that amen we'll take that and so there I know they came out to measure for the ramp the reason you'll see the ramp up because all of those rails have to be made custom for what's here and for that setup so we're just we're glad to see that and little things that are that are going along and there's things also to be praying about we're trying to get a crew to do that um um well you call it brother Richie that overhang the porch trying to get a crew to do that porch and I was trying to um to do that so they you know because you get a Amish crew in here they can get that done in about a day and then we can move from there and so I just asked you to be in prayer God cares about everything amen he cares about everything let me just tell you something I don't even touch a paintbrush in my house unless I ask God to help me and guide my hand amen I believe that I because I just believe that in everything that we do we need to invite him to be a part of it and we need to ask the Lord you know and so I just ask you just to continue to keep that in prayer also this coming uh this week well Lord willing myself and a number of the brothers will leave tomorrow morning real early uh to be there in the men's meeting and we'll be there and ministering as well so just ask that you would keep us in prayer keep all the brothers in prayer uh that will be going and uh brother Alexander you know he'll be here this weekend and I I had even after everything took place for brother Alexander I checked right away I said hey you know I I don't want you supposed I don't want you to be in here if you're not supposed to be here so he was preaching the very weekend after that so uh you know he he told me he said I I'm ready to go I said okay I just I I want to make sure you're following doctor's orders you know but right you know so I just want to know how to go after that then on neck this coming then next Thursday for the running long is going to be here because on that Thursday I'll I'll actually be down at bible Believers to open those meetings those fall meetings up down there for brother Jonathan Martin and just ask that you just keep us in prayer for that as well then I will be back home here for for that Sunday and you got the email regarding uh sister Judith so if you didn't get the email you just have to pull it up or refer to some refer to that and uh she's what is it sister Roseanne what was it turned from grief to Joy is that what it is okay so it's a it's it's a custom where going from grief to to Joy and so uh we're going to be praying uh with her we'll be gathered there on that Sunday of August October 2nd I think it is I I don't know if I've got my dates right but I know where it's at my calendar uh so you just would you just keep all of that in prayer and um how many enjoyed the fellowship on that was able to be here on on Sunday man that was good wasn't it that was really good it would have been better with hot dogs but it was good minus the nitrate hot dogs it had been good with with hot dogs but uh uh we just we we thank God for that and I I'm just grateful because it wasn't a big thing to have to clean up and I just appreciate brother Shane putting all that together and you know building the the fire pit and doing all that and it just was a it was a great time and so Lord willing the calendar will be coming out for October and we'll have another one there in October a weather permitting so let's look here in the word of the Lord I don't I'm sorry I don't mean to just keep you standing I just wanted to go over those things I hope you remember them but uh Job chapter 1 verse 13. I want to cut in on this part of it um where Satan has has received permission from God and God has has pulled back the Hedge around job's life uh with all things that are around his life and Satan's not coming in this moment to touch his body or to afflict his body he's just going to touch what's around him and he's got permission to do that because Satan can't do that until he first gets permission we we hear these things and we've heard them over the years and it's very true that Satan can't do one thing unless he first gets permission from God and that's a real rest to a believer because in the midst of that time when everything's going on that we can't explain we know that wait a minute here God's in control I might feel like things are out of control but God's got it in control and he who's in control has me so verse 13 and there was a day when when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house and there came a messenger unto job and said the ox were plowing and the asses feeding beside them and the sabians fell upon them and took them away yea they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword and I only am escaped alone to tell thee and while he was yet speaking there came also another and said the fire of God has fallen from heaven and hath burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them and I only am escaped alone to tell thee while he was yet speaking there came also another and said the Chaldeans made out three bands and fell up on the camels and have carried them away yea and slain the servants with the edge of the sword and I only am escaped alone to tell thee and while he was yet speaking there came also another and said thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house and behold there came a great win from the Wilderness and smote the four corners of the house and it fell upon the young men and they are dead and I only am escaped alone to tell thee let me just stop here just for a moment how many knows that when you have you go to file an insurance claim if lightning strikes your house they call that an act of God that's the biggest lie there is it's not there's not an act of God God is not in destruction are you hearing me God's not in destruction so we recognize that these things even when brother Bram talks about that wind we were looking around on Sunday came up where where Satan blew his poison breath the waters were only responding to that poisoned breath of Satan and Satan's desire was to try to drown the disciples but Jesus came to them so when we we look at this we know that here are the things that are taking place and I can't help as I read through this we hear the phrase if you haven't you stick around uh Hillbillies long enough you'll know it and that is when it rains it pours sometimes they'll say it's raining cats and dogs you know it just it just seems like it just keeps coming and this is what's happening with job it just keeps coming One messenger after another you finally wonder if job didn't want to say I'm not even going to look out that window I'm not even going to answer the door let's not even answer the phone verse 20. then job arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head and this is what I want you to concentrate on these verses and he fell down upon the ground and worshiped and he said naked came I out of my mother's womb and naked shall I return thither the lord gave and the Lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the Lord in all this job sinner nor charged God foolish God will help us I'd like to speak a little thought on appropriate response may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I realize that when this looking at this here over the past few weeks and just with really just the thoughts of where we've been dealing with on purpose and passing and some of that that's really the file I've been working out of and when I got to looking at this this struck my heart and just kept coming at times in prayer and then even as I was praying here and just waiting on the Lord and I want you to understand when I we take this child title of appropriate response it's God's desire in every service and in every way he wants to lead us God's desire is never to dictate to us what needs to be done but he wants to lead us and that's that's what the holy spirit is he's a leader he's the spirit of Truth he's sent to lead and to guide us he's never the Holy Spirit brother Brown would describe he's a gentleman he's timid and brother Branham would speak of you know of how that we were to respond or to conduct ourselves he would talk about even in a service and so forth and so we recognize he's always a gentleman God never desires to force anybody into anything because if it's a force then it's not a love and it just it has to continue to be a force if you're if you serve him under a threat then it's always got to be a new threat and another threat and God doesn't operate that way but God's desire when he manifests himself and makes himself known to you and I now it can strike fear in our hearts but it's not a fear of a slavish sphere it's a fear his presence when he comes it what the fear that would come about our life is that him uncovering where you realize we are standing in the presence of almighty God and that there is nothing that is hidden from him it's as though that when as when he comes and it's not as though it is as it's though it's as though that whatever is upon your heart what is upon your life it's as though somebody has wrote it on the screen and that's because the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart it's as real as you know I I've seen it over the years of you know uh is a ministering and you know and just sometimes the different reports you know no matter here or other places and every Minister could say the same no doubt that you know you have things that say well you seems like you were set in our conversation it seems like you were setting our table but we all realize it's not a man that was sitting at our table it was God and to recognize we have an All-Seeing Eye that's watching us and God himself knows every thought of our heart David even is assured Solomon when he was entering in to this place of leadership and kingship he in assured him not only should you serve him with a perfect heart but I want you to know God understands your imaginations he wants he wanted Solomon to know you're going to have questions but I want you to know God understands so don't allow the enemy to tell you Solomon that God doesn't understand God does understand one of the biggest things that Satan did when he came to Eve in the garden he couldn't tell he could not tell Eve that there wasn't a God but the way that he did it was just with flipping those words where he now begins to move yeh hath God said and he places it God an object of worship Elohim the self-existent one which is a powerful Revelation but God had revealed himself as Lord God one who is existing with his family but now Satan is wanting to take him back into a place to make it that this is this God that you're walking with that has given you promises he's so far off and so distant from you he can't even relate to you he can't even understand you and that was a big lie that Satan told because the only thing that she had to do I think back now as it comes you know so even as we Minister over the years but I really like our brother Trevor even said it here that night back in January that he should have just put the brakes on when Satan was saying all this and said you know what I'm gonna go ask my father about this it's just cut to the chase you wanted to say this and that let me just go talk to him because it's not your word that matters it's his word that matters because it's not I don't live off of your word that's death but I'm gonna go see what he says you'd like to go with me you're more than welcome but I'm gonna go see what he has to say because it's his word that he has given and he knows every Junction and every moment many times that's where we can get off within our own minds and our own thinking and we get off into you know so many different circumstantial things that we can get off into ourselves but when we are when we're looking at this and that of appropriate response I just upon my heart looking at this this how job in the midst of this in verse 20 and verse 22 uh you know everything that has come all around him has been touched you know the ten sons and you know all the daughters and all of them have this young children they've been touched they hear the sabians have come the Chaldeans have come a great wind has come a fire has come all of this consuming has come and there's no doubt there was a flood of emotions and responses that could have come forth in this moment remember the Bible says that the prophets of old were men subject to like passions such as we are there's nobody's DNA that's superhuman nobody the Holy Ghost does not when he comes does not change this to a glorified condition it's the Holy Spirit coming on the inside that now there is an anchor there's a new creation there's a new life it's the love of God that is pulsating in our life and it's by that strength and that strength alone that we live and we conduct Our Lives and when we see this job when this strikes he falls upon the ground he rents his mantle shaves his head and he begins to worship and the testimony is naked I came into my out of my mother's womb naked shall I return thither the lord gave and the Lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the Lord it shows that everything that is around us there are many things that are temporal it can be gone just like that all right just like that it can be gone because there's no promise of those things of riches or wealth or houses or lands or cars or anything else and for that matter as we've been looking at there's a purpose that we're called to serve within this life is that right I think when brother random talks about his family and the life story it just was striking as I'm just going through some of those things just you know listening here a little bit even this morning and brother Brown makes a statement like this it would preach but I'm not going to preach that now but if brother Branham talks about the family and the children he said those are the real things of life his family the relationship with it's not even things that are that are the real things things material things are not the real things of life it's family it's one another it's persons that's what's real right outside of the reality of God in our life These are things that is around us that's real so there's a lot of emotions and responses that can come let me just run through a few of them we'll see what we can get to tonight but there's a lot of emotions that can come from trials and tragic events and sometimes tragic events it's not just an accident it's not just an accident in a factory it's not just sometimes a tragic a tragic event can be all of a sudden there's a diagnosis of a disease and it just it all of a sudden something comes up and it just it's like it could take the wind right out of yourselves right there's a lot of emotions and a lot of feelings that can come our way anger fear worry doubt bitterness and Malice right now with all of those things you know as they go I don't want to try to just elaborate on all of that but sometimes we we those those things can come emotions that will try to come our way and I want to take you back into a place here that brother Branham I was reading this a few uh Sundays ago when brother Brown remember he was talking about the tragic accident that had happened where the lady her neck was broke instantly and brother band was talking about this and he remember he had a box of candy sitting right there on the table she just had made for him a few days ago and so brother bam is talking about and he's speaking of purpose speaking of that tragedy and and those things and he says he now he picks it up here a few Services uh later uh at the end of um in December of 63. it's all in that within just a couple weeks later and he says he says we have something a little sad a little something on the sad side this morning and he refers to the Coates family and how that they're all there and you know he says here was brother and sister coats and you know they were on the road home the other day from over in the west and someone slid on the road and killed sister coats instantly and program talks about seeing that box of candy that was there now let me just say this sister coats was 70 years old but it doesn't matter how old she was it was a sudden event that took place she had no other health issues going on brother Brown says you know he says I was just talking to her two girls just now in the room there and brother coats her husband is sitting here this morning he's got some broken ribs and I called him in the hospital where he was hospitalized over in Missouri and his ribs broken things but he certainly had a real courage a real Christian knowing that his little Queen is not dead she is Alive forevermore with Christ and there will be a uniting time now notice how brother Batman was saying he spoke to the husband when he's in the hospital with broken ribs he survived it but he says he had a real courage a real Christian knowing that his little Queen is not dead she's alive forever more with Christ and there'll be a reuniting time and brother Bram goes into quoting that of job and bringing down the purpose of of Nature and how we've looked at that the flowers serving the purpose there'll be a resurrection again and he says now brother coats he addressed him he says God bless you he's that I'm so happy to know that that seal of god holds in the hour of trouble he said I'm glad to know the Seal of god holds in the hour of trouble now let me just say this without elaborating on it when Jesus prayed for Peter he did not say Peter I'm praying that you don't fail he knows we are human we fail but I prayed for thy faith that thy faith fail not because Humanity will fail humanity is weakness Paul described this Humanity as an Earthen vessel like that of a piece of pottery that you don't set it down too hard it'll crack right but inside of that we have this Excellency and the Excellency is that the power of God that's dwelling on the inside of our life so the Highlight is not the outside the Highlight is who's on the inside so it's not me or you holding ourselves together it's Christ in us the hope of glory holding us together when God wrote to Joshua throughout and said don't be afraid don't be dismayed kept on repeating those words the word dismayed means to be shattered in many pieces so who is it that keeps you and I together that when the enemy wants to come with fear because he does things would like to strike fear because worry worry is a product of fear right and and what keeps you and I together is the Excellency of the power of God that is dwelling within our life that holds everything together the love of God so he said I'm so happy to know that the Seal of god holds in the hour of trouble and he says I I know what you're going through because I went through something similar years ago I want you I want to read this here to you this is one of the places I you know you think about many times and I don't want you to read into this in any way but uh brother Brown makes a statement referring here to sister coats and he says Lord he's praying he says we want to thank you for the memory of sister coats and what a precious dear sister and now the time comes that when we live our life our Span in life that's been lauded to us and we must cross the river we thank thee because that she did not have to suffer so I want you to notice how he's directing it we're finding things we can give things she didn't have to suffer and watch what he says concerning that there must not have been anything against her here that she had to suffer for she just went straight into the arms of God just in a moment and when I ask you not to read into that don't read into it and say oh I know brother so and so and says don't read into that because even some even within this when we see sometimes where there's things that can go very quickly we can't apply this right here and say hey there wasn't any suffering it went straight into the Arms of Jesus if I can say it in this way brother random made it clear Stephen never felt one rock he stepped right into that other body it was already present Hallelujah nothing is not somewhere a far off you realize brother Rambo says oh God let think he calls a glorified body in the early in in a message he says oh God let that glorified body move up next to him tonight and give him a charge Lord is a representation when this message when you've heard this message and left the other thing and it's become Eagle food to you you have heard from you would be awesome what is your theophany it's your representation Before the Throne of God that's why God the Holy Spirit ties you into that representation it ties you into there so now in this life you're living under the influence that Seed Life Is Coming forth you're living and manifesting in this Dimension another influence of another dimension yes a dimension of heavenly places that the believer has moved into Hallelujah so he says hear her hear Lord her husband her children are here this morning Lord right back to their poster Duty how we thank you for that Gallant Faith the faith of our fathers living still instead of dungeon flame and store sword we thank thee for all these things so brother random is pouring those things out and I just look at that like job when job when all of this took place job bowed his head and he worshiped he worshiped God I I just say God let this become near to us and gathered into fifth rib these are not things tonight that we're speaking of that just like oh I'm going to learn to be better this way that's not what this is I'm speaking of an expression of life what you what we see job expressing when he worships is because job was already walking by revelation of the sacrifice that God had made known to him and job said per Adventure my children have sinned maybe they feel like they have and they're entitled to certain things that's a sin so I'm going to cover that with a burnt offering and I'm going I know that God has made a way for this so I am going to offer that sacrifice that was job's that that's where job was standing so even though his heart was ripped out if you want to ask job job what matters more Joe could tell you that cattle I've got that back before right like remember brother Dao came to brother Branham at the end you know his life and brother down could say Hey brother brother down knew how to make money it was a businessman brother down from down to Brown Supply in in Lima Ohio brother Dao and sister down who passed on sister doll was a nurse down there now your brother Brandon he he knew brother down knew how and God blessed him but you see when when we look at this what was the most value was that of his children I can't get into this tonight but sometimes we give we can give job's wife a bad rap but those were her children too I can't touch that tonight but there's you see within this notice that all of this all of this that's around and notice let me get to the scripture here in Romans 8 35 who shall separate us from the love of Christ who shall shall tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness pearl sword all of those things none of them are welcoming to us anybody have a welcome mat for tribulation if you do you need prayer distress anybody like distress no you can take the you can take the DI off and I don't like stress persecution anybody like persecution new famine I can tell we don't like that nakedness Pearl or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long for whose sake for his sake for his sake trials is not God coming against us Satan has got permission and it's not God doing it right we are counted as sheep for the slaughter now if you parallel that scripture think about with the Lamb of God he had to surrender his life in order that that life might be manifest In You and I and the same way in our life this is why the circumstance and things comes around us is so that that life might be made manifest through our lives because there's just no other way for our our character to be developed nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord notice a Common Thread in here the love of God that the love of God is the most prevailing power because the love of God is the Holy Ghost if you take away Divine love you have no brotherly love right and it's divine love it's love that this scripture that you and I can read and and draw strength from and say thank you Lord amen thank you Lord and and lay our lives on it we have this because one loved us and laid his life down for us and manifest his love to you and I what is it that caught you and I it wasn't oh they teach this they teach that it was the love of God that caught us that's what catches The Sinner not telling them this doctrine that Doctrine this Doctrine this Doctrine but the love of God God help us I don't want to go in that in that area but sometimes we need to we need to change and recognize that what this message has come to do is not produce doctrines it came to manifest Jesus Christ in flesh it's Jesus in your flesh Jesus that just cares hmm Hallelujah glory be to God charity the Bible says never failth a lot of things can fail a lot of things can fail but charity never fails the love of God never felt when we fail yet charity never fails right when we've had certain feelings but charity never fails because remember it's charity that is the creative power of God in our life but the man remember I'm talking about in his own walk with his own life and in the life story he was talking about remember he'd referred to brother Coates I'm glad that the Seal of god holds in that time and in that hour and he says you know remember the brand was asked the question brother Bram did you keep your religion during that time when brother Brown Lost his his wife lost his daughter and brother Brown says no he kept me and brother bran talks about that hardest hour that struck his life to where he had prayed for his daughter remember God took his wife even when he prayed for his wife here came the sheet down Black Sheep here came when he prayed for his daughter God that you would just Lord don't take her don't take her down came that black sheep now brother Branham talks personally for his own life he doesn't he's not saying this to give and to give that this applies to everybody as far as that this is what goes on but what brother Branham at that moment he realizes later on and realizes what has taken place when God had called him to go out and hold those revivals his mother-in-law Hope was going to go with him and his mother-in-law said you're not dragging my daughter around in that trash that's what she called the Pentecostal people and then you've seen the example here of brother Branham you know because the think of it pressure right it means the wrath of a mother-in-law you know but you understand you're the pressure that's an example for you and I brother Brown picks up that and he's telling you and I let it be stepping stones of God's grace because there's pressure we see that even in his ministry there's always pressure that comes pressure doesn't stop when all of a sudden we get 21 years old pressure doesn't stop it keeps coming our way it don't matter how old you get you still feel pressure hope this is all right ma'am said Satan came up to me so here he said God wasn't going to speak to me he said so Satan came right but Stood Beside Me he said and Satan begin to tell me hmm what have you done you've went and prayed for people all night long you've sat in the chair and you've prayed and you've went and the labor and matter of fact your your wife you prayed about her he wouldn't answer you prayed about your you know your dad your daddy died your brother died just like that one right after another what's Satan doing he's building the case now Satan has come right up there to stand right next to him and brother Brown begins to talk about how that that gate of reasoning because we are three room house flesh spirit and soul that's why that the real the Holy Spirit the baptism of the Holy Spirit God then just our flesh it's got to be Deeper Than A Feeling which really turns in also to a spirit it's got to be deeper than just an emotion it's got to come down to that inner most realm because that's the Abiding Place that's where New Life takes place that's where New Creation takes place we're not against emotion I'm not against emotion you understand what I'm talking about it's very clear throughout the message of where our basis and our evidence has got to come back to where the sin question on the inside has been settled and then that's the anchor that we have in our life Satan stood right there next to the prophet and began to accuse God and brother Brahm said he couldn't tell me that there wasn't no God a new banner I had seen him I knew him but what he tried to tell him was he doesn't love you he don't care about you I hope you're understanding me Satan is an opportunist somebody can get in a car accident this guy's an opportunist let me strike fear somebody can have an accident at work let me strike fear right you're going to get to fear where it can absolutely paralyze ain't letting nobody Drive come on friends let's be real it can go on and on something can happen heart attack everybody starts feeling it oh my goodness oh my goodness What's Happening Here what's happening come on we've been there we've been there we've been there back in 2005. we've been there right what is it Satan is an opportunist I'm not saying we don't get things checked out but I'm trying to say Satan is an opportunist he wants to bring certain emotions because God doesn't bring anger God doesn't bring bitterness God doesn't bring malice God doesn't bring worry brother Adam tells us Satan and his imps bring those things but how do they bring them how does the cancer get started one little Bruce cell and then I just brother Brian explains that that life just slips right in there and it just starts building and building and building there's Satan's standing right next to the prophet and the different things that he's saying that brother Brown said even at that moment in the different places there in the message I know you're familiar with this when he's he says the reasoning the reasoning in the spirit Realm is agreeing with everything that Satan is saying are you hearing me these are the words of the prophet he said everything he was saying was the truth you couldn't deny it your daddy's gone your Mama's Gone your Baby's Gone your brother's gone you've prayed for people walk the streets and came in Wheels the morning put on your clothes slept in them for a couple hours and went back out to work the rep said everything everything he was saying he said now see everything here right there in that reasoning in that Spirit Realm and he said I was about ready to say I quit in another place brother Brown picks it up and he says I was getting ready to say well if that's the way he's going to be all right come on now you packed that same old boy around too if that's the way he's going to be what was Satan doing he's coming on those outer two Realms if that's the way he's going to be that's why your flesh you don't ever trust your flesh your flesh is not your buddy that's why Paul could say who will deliver me from The Wretched Man that I have I thank God through Jesus Christ Paul knew his deliverer it was Jesus Christ he can say with my flesh I serve I served that of the law of sin but inside there is another law and there's a war that goes on and brother Brown called it a constant War when a Believer has been quickened there's some new ownership on the inside we're not going by the influences of the world we've got different desires are you hearing me so here in the midst of that time he stands brother Brown says and brother Bram just says it just just clearly just like this he says but something he says something and when I was getting ready to say that if that's the way he's going to act then I won't serve him he said but there was something came from somewhere else way down on the inside and it said who are you to begin with the lord gave and the lord taketh away see that's the Inside Man that Inside Man is the product of the new creation of the Holy Ghost it's our anchor it's our absolute you're hearing me it's the absolute because what is on the inside of you is not different from the word but remember what is in you is the Holy Ghost and he is the word it is the word wrapped up in your life Jesus said my word is spirit and life it's an absolute working in our life right and what does an absolute do you judge All Things by that absolute when something comes a thought comes you bring it to the Judgment seat of the absolute to a real believer that's born of the spirit of God that it's not out there but the Judgment seat what you see what John saw in heaven is inside the believer the Judgment seat is there right there by the baptism of the Holy Ghost so here are for brother Branham actually in another in one place here let me pick it up here in another is it just just looking at a few things here and brother Brandon was looking remember he was crying out to God this is days later okay this is days later this is after the hospital thing I'm referring to this is days later that here he is in the midst of these days they just can't he's still thinking I can see my wife being taken but my baby I can't understand that now you and I we let's let's just let's just Fellowship on this because this is exactly where you and I get to on things we can come to a place and here we are it's just like it's it's settled and then we can get and we can start thinking about things and brother Brown starts thinking about it I said I couldn't understand that about my baby I can understand about my wife he's not charging God foolishly he just can't understand what's going on you know I understand my wife but my baby now remember within this he goes here's from a questioning and as he's thinking on that he becomes very despondent which who wouldn't be despondent or have the temptation to be despondent or depressed or down or in despair who wouldn't foreign it's not saying that Oh Brother Sam you know we ought to be full of joy joy is something on the inside because there's sometimes that this doesn't reflect what's on the inside even in the midst of Heartache there's joy on the inside the joy of the Lord is our strength what Joy is that that I know in whom I have believed and I'm persuaded he's able yeah that's the joy of the Lord that inside of this booth this temporary housing there's a real joy that God has brought here that I pass from Death unto life I don't know what's going on here I don't know what's going to come next but I know where I'm going I know where I'm come from and I know where I'm going between the here and there don't know all of that but I know where I'm going that's the joy of the Lord and that's where we draw from that's Wells springing up within us Rivers out of his belly Shuffle rivers of Living Water and here brother Branham comes into that place and brother Brown remember he's telling us here as we were looking at last week and he says it like this concerning let me as I go into this he says no matter how much we cry out we think this that or the other nothing can take us until God is finished with us and I'm so glad to know this he said sometimes you feel like as I did one time I put a pistol against my head to commit suicide but I couldn't do it are you hearing me I took my glove off no this is when he took my glove off he's thinking about Sharon he's thinking about hope he's up there working on the power lines he's had to crawl you know when brother Brown walked in power lines he did what now the helicopters do when he would walk that and look at him I went right through those areas and pointed out houses he would stay he's up there near one of these where all of these vaults are passing by and it strikes him brother I'm saying I don't even know what in the world got in my head he said and here I looked at that and I took my glove off I said Sharon I'll be with you Daddy I'll see you in just a few moments see just in that I could preach that that debunks that Roman Catholic falsehood that suicide sends you to hell come on somebody Saul didn't go to hell Samson didn't come on somebody see that's that that's not that's not biblical that's Roman Catholic tradition and brother Brandon when he's going to do it he's apologizing to God God I'm sorry I'm a coward I'm coming this way I'm sorry and brother Bram tells us he says if it had not been for that gift in my life he said I probably wouldn't have been here now let me just say this that gift in our life God's got a purpose for each of Our Lives and I hope you understand these very things where I'm going that there is something that we're trying to look at here and how God is just so pressed this is here you take a situation that has taken place and here of what is tried to come and move there even upon the prophet and he's brother Brown he's he's speaking of this here how he retched out to grab that line with his hands he says and here I was he says I was about gone myself he says like Elijah I was under a juniper tree it's hard I'm not trying to get us into a confession service but it's hard there's things that's hard right brother Brown's not trying to elevate that that's not what he's doing he's not saying let's Elevate but he's what is the ding thing that he's pointing to is that we come into situations like this emotions can come around within our life he said but he says I got to a place I was so beside myself I tried to make a gun shoot my brains out but it wouldn't do it there's work to be done something has to be done God wasn't finished he'll always take care of you that was a reality that the prophet came to think of God's grace hadn't come to him and he would have just been and remained in that stupor would he have had a right sure he would have had a right but there was a strength from an unseen realm that he tapped into as the Son and Daughter of God let me say it like this things can come our way but those things do not define who we are as Sons and Daughters of God depression can come your way anxiety can come your way but it doesn't Define who you are because that CG on the inside there is no weakness our natural family tree is flawed it's filled with weakness but there is no weakness in the DNA of almighty God are you hearing me brother Randall would pick it up and spoke a word's Original Seed and he would let us know he said if this natural family tree that I'm of has certain strains what about he said that tree of life but I've been born of that life it has strings of predestination [Music] damn it yes Hallelujah sometimes We can question ourselves I'm just speaking these just as the Lord has given these to me here over the weeks sometimes we can question ourselves we're not questioning God we question ourselves what's wrong with me I prayed nothing happens of course the devil's always there to give you encouragement you know the devil's never there to Build You Up incredible how the devil wants to build up people lives that really aren't right with God and then he wants to try to come and tear down lives and bring every accusation against hearts and lives that are right on with God are you with me you never found God rising up against the ten spies and say you guys are a bunch of unbelievers you guys are God never does that God never did that it manifested what they were when the circumstance came and presented itself adversity brought out what was in him the whole time is that right so we can question ourselves and circumstances let me give you an example because remember we were talking about this last week on the Untouchable that that there's nothing that can touch Our Lives unless God first permitted nothing's going to take us from here unless God first permits it and I was speaking of brother brother Bill and I were fellowshipping at the uh fire pit there and I was telling him after the service there on Sunday I was just kind of just thinking about one particular occurrence because when you we take that statement of nothing nothing's going to take us out of the Earth uh before that purpose has been served and yet you remember the situation brother Brown will talk about it at length in the Hebrew series uh and then he'll also talk about it after that there was a minister and brother Brown talked about that Minister had become so discouraged and when he became so discouraged he brother Ramsay brother Bram calls him out in a couple different messages and uh remember he he he he sent the worker because he had a garage and brother went to Brother Ramsey said brother Ramsey said hey he said I want you to come and go to memes with me he said no Billy said I don't serve God no more but the man said what would you say nice I don't serve God no more Billy so brother Brown walked brother Brown walked away and brother Ben went home and like anybody else you know and things come like that you think maybe not just hearing things you know maybe I didn't have a you know the fourth shot of espresso today I need that something's not clicking right so brother Brandon went back and he said brother Ramsay said I you said something a while ago he said you know earlier today he said you said you weren't serving God no more he said that's right Billy I'm not but the RAM said surely you don't mean that and brother Ramsay said I do brother Ramsey had went and he sent this boy that was working for him and the boy gave the testimony he had sent this boy over across the river to give him a case of beer and bring it back and when he went to gold and drink that here he was under a car the car smashed it and brother Brown takes that up and brother Brown said see he said if you want heed to God's correction he'll have to take you home early now don't read into that you understand me don't read into that but it just goes to show if we heed to the correction of the Lord how important brother Brahm is dealing with that with correction of tests and trials and when those things come it we also that's something we need to heed to as well because here's the point God won't lose one God won't lose one but I don't know about you but I don't want my testimony to be on the side that you know what God had to bring me home early because I want to listen to him well that's free here's a little here's a little lady because we talked about being you know questioning sometimes here's a little lady and she had a dream and in this dream she dreamed that the devil had come up to the side of her bed and she he looked over and heard began to make all kinds of faces at her and he said I got you now she said something just happened to me brother Brandon she said I jumped up out in the dream I jumped up out of the bed and I said get out of here devil in the name of Jesus and I started running him and he run out of the house she said I don't understand what that means Brian said then the holy spirit being present he gave the interpretation he said it was a little while after that dream her husband had a heart attack and when she's seen her husband fall he's an aged man heavy man his hands went back and his eyes said death come to take him but God wasn't through with him now watch what happened and that little woman's Faith raised up and said I won't stand for it I call for his life in the name of Jesus Christ brother Brown said what it was the sixth sense rose up at that crucial moment that time that give her faith it wasn't that oh she had this Sixth Sense and she overwrote no it was it was not God's will for him to go at that time and there was an anointing that struck there it wasn't her speaking that anointing struck in that moment and says get out of here I won't settle for this God's watching over it that's why God anoints his body his people he anoints your life because remember we're not going anywhere until he's finished let me close on this one I remember the stats Cliff baby their sister Stancliff she gives the book profit visit South Africa to the doctor the baby's dying the baby dies the doctor reads the book well in the meantime whenever and he he showed you this doctor believed he says we're going to leave this baby in the oxygen tent I'm not going to say nothing and we're going to wait for brother Brown to come here for him to pray because he believed it just like sister stats with brother Brown prays this baby is going to be well and it comes back to a simple principle the son can do nothing but what he seeth the father doing so when prayer is offered in the sick get well it's God's will being done we're always in God's will when we're praying for health are you hearing me and it's God that anoints and inspires you never know it can be your faith out there in praying and there might be some right here and your faith is what's touching the Throne of God for this need and here with sister stats Cliff which this question can come she she hear the baby you remember the the Lord spoke to brother Brahman said don't don't rebuke that because that's the hand of the Lord it's pretty hard to understand didn't it it's very hard to understand so he got her on the phone he said no he said God has called your baby sister stats Cliff now see he was going to fly to Germany and this is what she said was it brother Branham my weakness of Faith every time I read this and I think about this it just it just strikes me was it my weakness of Faith see it's a question was there something I did was that that I know was I not fervent enough with God was it something that I I'm talking about floods of emotions that can come said you have great faith because you prayed for your baby and you and your husband held on to it God raised the baby and he refused to do it because he knows what's best and still you love him that's real faith Hallelujah that's real faith can we read the rest of it anybody when mountains are moving and things can have faith but let it go backwards one time and see how it works that's when you prove whether you've got faith or not remember the situation I just closed there remember the situation of the brother Billy Paul would tell the testimony there was a young boy young man he he went on home to be with the Lord and they called brother Branham in the hotel room and brother Brown was praying but then said let me let me let me talk to father so brother Brian begins to pray but then calls him up calls the calls the brother back up and he says to him he says now he says if you if you want me to he said I can ask for him to come back he said but if it was me I would leave him right where he's at does that make it easy on this side no but what it says is there waiting and like David when David remember when the baby had passed away the baby had died David got up he got cleaned up he stopped his fast David why are you stopping everything right now and David said because he said I cannot bring him back here but I can go where he is and God's [Applause] Gods can go it's about him who made a way he's made a way for you and I it's why we love him this is where it comes down to no matter tribulation famine whatever more it's the love of Christ there's a lot of things that can come our way but the love of Christ it holds it strengthens there it's a typos it's an anchor it's an absolute it's our strength that we draw from in the midst of that time just like brother Branham when he stood there after him you know with the the voltage line and and here he is on the ground and he goes home that day and he's just you know later he goes in and he says you know you're hearing that song about the wagon wheel and things out west immediately hear God here and a dream brother Bram calls it at that moment it goes into and he sees this Wagon Wheel and sees this wagon you know the schooner and here he sees this beautiful young lady walk up how you do how you do ma'am you didn't recognize her she was a baby when she left but she said Daddy don't you recognize me Sharon honey he said yes yes mamas of home she's doing well Hallelujah little babies over here sorry she died she passed as a little one but she went right into the prince of God because in God's photo album he takes a picture when we're at our Prime you're talking about a youth meeting we're going to what a youth meeting and the good thing about it is is we're not just going to be changed back young because we would be Youth and have the same issues we have now but it's complete change is complete change of glory be to God many emotions can come bitterness anger worry all let's not be we're not going to be coy a lot of things can flood in a lot of things can come our way with certain things when things come about but remember we have an absolute we have an anchor we have one that we can go to and if you don't have that tonight you need to make reservations and you need to ask God lord I need that absolute in my life I need that anchor that in the midst when everything else is going on there's something that holds me Steady in the midst of it all because the church won't do it just knowing the message won't do it you've got to have a relationship with Jesus Christ and it's an anchor that holds you that no matter what comes or goes it's an anchor that holds you well I'm thankful tonight for we can draw from that anchor aren't you amen musicians if you come let's sing that song Hold to God's unchanging hand hold to God's unchanging hand remember tonight as we're looking at this appropriate response God is Not dictating to us he's not demanding or commanding but God is leading us and directing us that no matter test of trial no matter what comes that even in the midst of this in the midst of even a tragic and tragedy and in the midst of things that we can worship and to recognize that God is in control he's overall it's my worship listen to me now my worship's not based on what I understand because brother Branham tells us I read that quote to you a couple weeks ago in 1964 message Shalom he said sometimes people ask the question why he said I've asked the question why he said but what I had to do he said when my family my wife and my children he said I just had to put my hand in his hand and say Lord I trust you I trust you I think I was reading here today I've just I've been studying a lot just in within that and just with the over the past few days just with just with things concerning even around this and how the Lord has taken different angles on it and just to see how that the enemy will would so come there was one sister in a prayer line she had comments and here the Holy Spirit came right down and discerned what the nervousness was in her life the nervousness was a product because she had been told your son is missing in action and here's what the Holy Spirit tells her he says sister you go he said and don't you take no for an answer you understand what I'm saying Satan is an opportunist that sister didn't wasn't dealing with nervousness maybe before but it's an extreme right now because she's been told your boy's missing in action but here came the word of the Lord don't you take no for an answer let me say this to you I did I did a funeral here well some years ago maybe 10 years ago now I think 11 years ago and you had here I am a funeral and you know I'm ministering this funeral and you don't you have situations where individuals that it was brother Rodney and I'm standing here at that funeral and I realize here I am I'm in a room full of of people and that was it a Methodist Church or out there in Oberlin Church all around and I'm in the middle of it and I and the Lord just strikes and I took the subject Lord remember me and I realized all of them coming up here were talking about the Glory Days of basketball okay it's wonderful it's fine I mean there were you know maybe it was the only winning season Overland had I don't know Seasons but you understand there's there's camaraderie that I get that and all the all the different accolades and things but one thing I I this was pressed on my heart I said do you realize that the thief on the cross if you want to ask the people around him and said what do you think about this man all they knew is what led to that moment but what they didn't know was the last moments of his life was the most important moments you don't know what the last moments are come on somebody when he sat right there in that moment Lord remember me when you come into Paradise Hallelujah and I said it just like this I said there are many there's things that you know and I was even speaking there about brother Ron yes and you know but the but the brother Rodney I know I know when God touched his life I know when God started dealing with his life I know how God started moving in his life and you know he kind of when he kind of kind of was drifting back your living God just brought her right back in line God knows what he's doing and I can share it like this even when I went to see him the first time brother Rodney I never went up there to preach to him I said I'm standing here as a buddy I said I've come because you're my friend and I come to pray for my friend I go there to preach to him I didn't go there to tell him you need this you need to do this you need to do that he needed Jesus he needed to experience the love of God are you hearing me now oh God May that may that be within that's what this that's what the world is dying for the love of God's Not A compromising love is not a sugar sappy thing it's expression that I care about you because Jesus cares about you Hallelujah glory be to God oh my I said I was finished you probably say yeah you always you love him say let's hold to God's unchanging hand let's hold to God's unchanging him Hallelujah listen stand let's just let's sing this [Music] transition [Music] to [Music] oh [Music] God's unchanging man [Music] gods are changing hands oh I'm gonna hold to God's unchanging hands let's go [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] finally [Music] oh let's go [Music] [Applause] some amazing [Music] [Music] [Applause] sure [Applause] that you've got changed [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] but I've been through there [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] your hosts [Music] I wish sister Bethany was here tonight I'd ever sing that song I never lost my praise amen what a fitting song I never lost my praise those circumstances come those situations that I never lost my praise you know part of the worship and when it says job out on the ground and job worship laid down his mantle he took he laid it all down and he worshiped what all the words that job said at that time I don't know but just simple worship would just say Lord you were in control Lord I don't know what's taking place but you're in control worship is not just confined to certain words of Hallelujah thank you Jesus worship is every day of our life it's an expression Lord I don't know what's taking place but I know you're in control I don't know all of this that's out here but I know that that burnt offering that you revealed to me is there's an acceptance there I don't know everything else around but I've Got Confidence in what
