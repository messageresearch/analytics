[32:13] How marvelous.
[32:18] Oh, the grace
[32:21] that calls
[32:23] my fully soul.
[32:29] He looks
[32:31] beyond
[32:34] all my faults
[32:37] and he's all my need.
[32:42] [Music]
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord Jesus. He's
[32:48] worthy.
[32:50] He's the worthy one.
[32:54] Amen.
[32:57] I'm so glad for that. Aren't you?
[33:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. He There was a lot of faults he
[33:02] had to look beyond
[33:05] the condition that we were in. And not
[33:07] just that, but I think how brother Bram
[33:10] says, I don't know who the brother Mike
[33:12] is, but I've always quote that quote has
[33:14] always stood out to me in questions and
[33:15] answers. He said, "To think of it,
[33:17] brother Mike, he chose us even knowing
[33:21] all of our mistakes."
[33:24] But see, his choosing was before
[33:28] any mistakes.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; His so his choosing is greater than any
[33:34] of your mistakes.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; Because his choosing was not in time.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; He had knowledge of that. He had
[33:42] knowledge of it. But his choosing was
[33:46] before there was one even one
[33:50] spirit wrong spirit. Amen.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; Before the devil was ever the devil, as
[33:54] a matter of fact, before he was ever
[33:56] created,
[33:58] &gt;&gt; you are in God's mind.
[34:00] [Applause]
[34:04] &gt;&gt; And that's where we're going back.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; We're not going back per se to his mind,
[34:08] but we're going back to what God thought
[34:11] of.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; But this time, those thoughts have
[34:15] already started to become
[34:17] &gt;&gt; material.
[34:19] And once God's word starts to unfold,
[34:22] there's no stopping it.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; It just keeps on unfolding just like in
[34:26] your life all the way through
[34:30] until the complete achievement.
[34:33] And to think of it, how God will stand
[34:35] there even in that time, even after
[34:36] everything is all said and done, that
[34:39] that great
[34:41] declaration, it's good.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; It's good.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; It's good. Don't you love him?
[34:49] &gt;&gt; So appreciate his goodness to us. Amen.
[34:52] God is so good. So good to be gathered
[34:54] here tonight. So appreciate seeing each
[34:56] and every one of you and the sacrifice
[34:58] that you've made to be here tonight. And
[35:01] we just want to hear from God.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; We want to give ourselves to the Lord. I
[35:05] want to leave out of here changed.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; And I realize that when we leave out of
[35:11] here changed, there's sometimes where
[35:13] God will bring an absolute change right
[35:16] there. And then there's other things in
[35:18] our life that God will do and he begins
[35:21] to initiate the change by causing our
[35:24] hearts to be inclined to him.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; And it won't be something that we can
[35:29] just have hands laid on us and it's
[35:31] achieved. But character is not a gift.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; It's a victory.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; All everything that we have that's
[35:40] needed, prayer lines are needed, the
[35:41] altar's needed, every one of these
[35:43] parts. But as we come through, that
[35:45] character is a gift. Not a gift, I'm
[35:48] sorry. It's a victory. And if it's a
[35:51] victory, it means there's a battle.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Now, I'll be honest with you. I'll be
[35:55] honest with you, man. How many times I
[35:57] would have loved to just God just hand
[35:59] it to me.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; But God doesn't do it that way.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; But you know what? He's got confidence
[36:09] in his word
[36:11] &gt;&gt; and he'll work with our lives, deal with
[36:13] us, and bring us to a place to say,
[36:15] "Yes, Lord." Like the song was sung
[36:18] tonight. Take me deeper, Lord.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; Take me deeper.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just go to him in a word of
[36:24] prayer before we read the word of the
[36:26] Lord here tonight. Heavenly Father,
[36:30] we love you, Lord Jesus, and we so
[36:33] appreciate your mercy and your goodness.
[36:36] Lord God, right among us and in our
[36:38] lives, Lord.
[36:40] And Lord, as we move into this further
[36:43] part of the service, we've come to
[36:46] fellowship around your word.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Lord God, just stepping away from the
[36:52] the cares of this life.
[36:55] And I pray Lord that you would give each
[36:58] of us the grace that we need just to be
[37:01] able Lord to move from just the dwelling
[37:04] upon this realm and all the pressures
[37:07] and all the the burdens of life. God may
[37:11] you just come Lord and lift us in your
[37:14] presence.
[37:16] May you come, Lord, and minister to our
[37:18] lives tonight.
[37:20] That Lord, when we would walk out of
[37:22] this place, should you, Terry,
[37:25] there's become a refreshment and a
[37:27] strengthening in our lives. that Lord,
[37:30] not that the trials and the troubles are
[37:34] taken away necessarily, but that Father,
[37:38] we've got a renewed confidence
[37:41] to be able to face
[37:44] the cares of this life, but to be able
[37:47] to do it, Lord,
[37:50] with the Lord Jesus, a renewed joy and
[37:54] strength in our lives. Lord,
[37:57] we love you, Father. We so appreciate
[37:59] your mercy.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; Lord, we ask that you would come here
[38:03] tonight.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; Lord, come take the pull pit tonight,
[38:07] Lord.
[38:09] Come be the speaker tonight. That could
[38:11] be no greater honor
[38:14] than you would come tonight, Lord, and
[38:15] speak to our hearts.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; Lord, that you just guide and direct us,
[38:21] Lord. The things, Lord, that you've laid
[38:23] on our hearts, but even within all that,
[38:26] you know how to bring it and to deliver
[38:27] it. We just Lord submit ourselves and
[38:30] may the same inspiration Lord may it
[38:32] move in our hearts and our lives Lord
[38:36] even in this moment continue to change
[38:39] us and transform us reach every heart
[38:41] and every life for your glory we pray in
[38:44] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[38:48] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen. We want
[38:52] to just open our Bibles if we could to
[38:55] First John chapter 5. And I want to read
[38:58] a few verses of scripture before we're
[39:00] seated here tonight.
[39:03] And uh
[39:11] want to mention to you I there's
[39:14] actually some things that developed
[39:15] between the time I sent out the calendar
[39:19] um and then uh last night or this
[39:22] morning rather. And so next Thursday
[39:24] night, Lord willing, brother Marcus
[39:26] Becker from Germany will be here with
[39:28] us. And um if you've never met Brother
[39:31] Marcus and or um just got a wonderful he
[39:35] got a wonderful spirit first of all.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; That's that's that's one thing I look
[39:39] for.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; is he has a wonderful spirit and um and
[39:44] uh he was able to put up with all my
[39:46] teasing at men's meetings some years ago
[39:48] and I would do the goostep and all of
[39:52] that. So, you know, but he's he's able
[39:54] to dish it right back. So, you kind of
[39:56] feel that out. You got to know your
[39:58] surroundings and what you can, you know,
[40:00] do because and but um he's got a real
[40:03] good spirit though and and just a real
[40:06] just so have enjoyed the different times
[40:08] I've been able to hear him and so I
[40:10] believe it'll be a great blessing to us
[40:12] as an assembly. And um so let's read
[40:15] here in the word in 1 John chapter 5 and
[40:17] verse one. Whosoever believeth that
[40:21] Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and
[40:27] everyone that loveth him that begat
[40:32] loveth him also that is begotten of him.
[40:35] Now, you'll watch how John will continue
[40:38] to tie this together because we know
[40:41] that there's a depth to that even in the
[40:43] first part of verse one. Whosoever
[40:45] believeth that Jesus is the Christ is
[40:47] born of God.
[40:49] And yet we re we recognize is that it's
[40:52] more than just what a person could
[40:55] actually say, well I believe. But yet
[40:57] believing you must believe and there is
[41:00] a beginning to believing. But yet
[41:02] believing itself is not being born
[41:05] again.
[41:07] Is that right?
[41:09] &gt;&gt; The Bible says man believeth with the
[41:12] heart and confession and believeth unto
[41:16] salvation. So there is it all starts
[41:19] with faith and believing. But then
[41:21] there's the evidence and one of the
[41:23] things how John will continue to write
[41:25] this. Everyone that loveth him that
[41:28] begat loveth him also that is begotten
[41:32] of him. So it's absolutely impossible to
[41:35] be born of God and not love the
[41:40] brethren.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; But first of all, you've got to be part
[41:44] of the brethren.
[41:48] Are you hearing me?
[41:51] &gt;&gt; By this, watch this. By this we know
[41:54] that we love the children of God when we
[41:57] love God and keep his commandments. I
[42:02] think that's to me is really striking
[42:04] how John would write that. By this we
[42:07] know that we love the children of God.
[42:08] when when h how do I know that I'm
[42:11] actually in that right state of even
[42:14] where I'm to be is when we love God.
[42:17] Well, how do we declare that we love
[42:19] God? Well, the life that we live, but
[42:22] it's even in just the simple daily
[42:27] expressions in our life of prayer,
[42:30] &gt;&gt; devotion,
[42:32] Lord, I love you. Right?
[42:33] &gt;&gt; Just being in the house of God. Just
[42:35] simple little things. That's just it
[42:37] just expressions. I mean, imagine if if
[42:40] a home there was no expressions of love.
[42:43] This it's not just something that's
[42:44] reserved for a certain time, but it's
[42:46] throughout the time. And that's how that
[42:49] it is between Christ and a believer. By
[42:51] this we know we love the children of God
[42:54] when we love God and keep his
[42:57] commandments. For this is the love of
[43:00] God that we keep his commandments. And
[43:04] his commandments are not grievious.
[43:08] In other words, they're not borome.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; They're not ah
[43:14] I guess I have to do this or I they're
[43:17] not grievious.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; You see what what makes the difference?
[43:20] It's not that the word changes. It's
[43:23] when our nature changes. And when our
[43:26] nature changes, even how God will bring
[43:28] things to attention to our lives, it
[43:30] might be things that are would still be
[43:33] lingering here or there. And then God's
[43:35] rubbing that out of our life and then
[43:37] quickly that spirit of God on the inside
[43:40] will always agree with the word. And
[43:42] that includes even in character as God
[43:45] works on our character. Because when the
[43:47] Holy Spirit has come into our life by
[43:48] way of the new birth, we understand that
[43:50] the new birth is not the adoption,
[43:53] &gt;&gt; but the new birth itself is the
[43:55] beginning as we grow into full adoption.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Is that right? So then with with all of
[44:02] that, there's many times within
[44:05] character and things that God will work
[44:07] out in our lives over time. And
[44:10] sometimes God just knows how to get us
[44:12] into a place that certain character
[44:15] trait can go for a long, long time
[44:19] &gt;&gt; and keep the same things keep on being
[44:21] repeated over and over. And finally, God
[44:24] gets it to a place, trust me, I've
[44:26] watched this and I've seen it not just
[44:28] by experience, but I've watched it also
[44:30] as a pastor. And finally, God will bring
[44:33] it to a place to where a person is
[44:35] actually able to see, I need to overcome
[44:38] this.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; And I'm so thankful for God's grace for
[44:43] that.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Because let me tell you something, you
[44:45] can be healed and physically in your
[44:47] body and if God carries, you'll get sick
[44:49] again.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; You might even be privileged to walk on
[44:52] the water, but if you come to that
[44:54] place, even in your character, little by
[44:56] little, that's lasting. Because when
[44:59] this when the rapture take place or if
[45:01] you go by the way of the grave, you
[45:03] don't take any of the water you walked
[45:05] on.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; But what you take with you is character.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible says precious in
[45:11] the sight of the Lord is the death of
[45:13] his saints. And that whole word precious
[45:15] is the actual taking the precious
[45:18] minerals
[45:19] &gt;&gt; that would be within the earth.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; You don't take all the dirt. People
[45:22] don't go to the museums and say, "Wow,
[45:24] look at the dirt that that was around
[45:26] that piece of gold. Look at that
[45:28] stream." No, it's the gold.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; You don't pay a lot of money for the
[45:32] dirt, yet we put gold on dirt.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[45:36] &gt;&gt; But it's the gold.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You can be seated.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Love you tonight and the Lord and
[45:46] pray that the Lord will just come by our
[45:48] way in a special way and speak to our
[45:49] hearts.
[45:51] I want to open here with that quote that
[45:54] we were looking at
[45:57] in that of becoming love and just
[45:59] dealing even thinking of that first
[46:01] phrase whosoever believeth that Jesus
[46:05] that Jesus is the Christ is born of God.
[46:07] Watch how brother Brandham would place
[46:08] this. He says now we know drinking and
[46:11] carrying on is sin but the whole thing
[46:15] is because of unbelief.
[46:18] Because if you believe God and Jesus
[46:20] Christ to be his son, you are absolutely
[46:23] not going to do those things. He said,
[46:25] "You believe that he that's born of God
[46:28] does not commit sin." He says, "You must
[46:32] believe. The whole thing lays in faith."
[46:35] Jesus said, "He that heareth my words
[46:37] and believeth on him that sent me has
[46:39] everlasting life and shall not come into
[46:41] condemnation, but already passed from
[46:44] death into life." He said, ' Do you
[46:46] believe that's the truth? There it lays.
[46:49] There isn't nothing else that you can
[46:51] do. Only believe. And if you believe,
[46:56] then them little immoral things will
[46:58] just drop off like that. That's why
[47:01] brother Ram would say over and over,
[47:03] "Well, I quit this." Brother Ram says,
[47:05] "Well, if you quit it," he said, "you
[47:07] could, but when when God comes and
[47:09] begins to deal with your life, God
[47:11] himself will bring the quitting within
[47:14] your life.
[47:15] So notice he says, "Then them little
[47:17] immoral things will just drop off like
[47:20] that." It's like, remember how you see
[47:21] different trees, some trees, I think
[47:23] it's beach trees and things like that.
[47:24] Some of them will hold on their leaves
[47:26] for a long time. They'll even hold on
[47:28] them. Sometimes some of the beach trees,
[47:30] they'll hold on through the winter, but
[47:32] you just let new life come up. You don't
[47:34] have to go out to the woods out here
[47:35] because there's beach trees, those
[47:36] things grow so fast, you know, and you
[47:38] really don't want to be around them
[47:39] because they'll fall over, too. But the
[47:41] beach trees, if you just give it time in
[47:43] the spring, when the life comes up,
[47:44] those dead leaves, you don't have to
[47:45] pluck them off. They'll fall off because
[47:47] the life coming up will actually cause
[47:50] them to fall off. That's really the same
[47:52] way it is within the life of a believer.
[47:55] It's just taking in and just believing
[47:57] and taking in that word and applying it
[47:59] to our lives. And notice he says those
[48:02] little immoral things will drop off. And
[48:03] as you believe, you become love and love
[48:08] is God. and you begin to wind yourself
[48:11] into Christ. And then these other
[48:13] things, you don't have to quit doing
[48:14] them. They just quit themselves. There's
[48:18] just no desire to do it. And the
[48:20] worshipper once purged has no more
[48:22] conscience or desire of sin. And there
[48:24] in the orange, when the worshipper is
[48:26] purged is when he's born again. When his
[48:28] old nature dies and a new nature sets
[48:32] in. And you become an offspring of God
[48:35] in the green. And God can't hurt you
[48:37] without hurting himself. I want you to
[48:40] notice brother Bram never said we become
[48:42] loving or lovely. Yet that is an
[48:45] expression or what can come forth but
[48:48] it's actually to become a part of God to
[48:52] become love. The Bible says God is love.
[48:56] Now, there's no way that that can
[48:57] actually take place without the real
[49:00] true experience of the Holy Ghost within
[49:03] our lives coming down there to the soul,
[49:06] which will actually be the word of God
[49:08] himself, the spirit of God coming in the
[49:10] form of the word that will actually
[49:12] begin to take residence within our life.
[49:14] So, there's no way that a person can
[49:17] actually be born again and say, "Well, I
[49:19] I love the brethren." and and indeed
[49:21] they would have maybe a love, but yet if
[49:23] the love within what they're proclaiming
[49:26] is the love that God has set forth for
[49:28] the brethren, but yet they're not
[49:30] walking in the word, they're not living
[49:32] within that word, there's not there's
[49:34] not that of the spirit of truth really
[49:36] abiding in their life, then they've not
[49:38] reached that degree. They can have a
[49:40] file love, but remember, felio love is a
[49:42] friendship love, and it'll only hold out
[49:45] as long as the conditions allow it to
[49:47] hold out. But when those conditions
[49:50] break away, it's gone as well, too. But
[49:53] this is why there's got to be something
[49:55] greater in our lives. God never stripped
[49:56] away feeling of love because there's
[49:58] still that feeling of love that you have
[50:00] for your your children, you have towards
[50:03] your wife, even that which would be
[50:05] expressed to that of our brothers and
[50:07] sisters. But it cannot be limited to
[50:10] just fileio. It must be under the
[50:13] influence of agape love. And this is why
[50:16] we need the Holy Spirit in our lives.
[50:18] Not just to be able to get along with
[50:20] one another, but actually to get along
[50:22] with ourselves. We need the spirit of
[50:24] God working on our lives. He's dealing
[50:26] with our hearts. And then when the Holy
[50:28] Spirit has come into our life, as the
[50:30] prophet tells us, you become love. You
[50:33] become a part of God. You become a part
[50:35] of the word. You become love. So within
[50:39] that and of the substance that would be
[50:42] present in our life. I want to just uh
[50:44] deal here uh tonight and just continue
[50:46] to speak on that thought on becoming
[50:49] love. Now when you look at this within
[50:52] the scriptures to understand of how that
[50:55] God himself would come down, how that
[50:58] love God is love and God would come down
[51:01] to become one of us. What what does the
[51:03] Holy Spirit then when it comes into our
[51:05] life, what does it actually produce?
[51:08] Well, look at how that God himself clear
[51:11] back in the beginning, God before there
[51:13] was atom, time, molecule, before the
[51:16] devil was ever even created. But God in
[51:18] his mind, he dwelt alone with his
[51:21] thoughts. Now, within that of his
[51:23] thoughts, I don't want you to think that
[51:24] thoughts were just as though there was
[51:26] just like a collection of thoughts, but
[51:28] yet to understand that that perfect and
[51:31] complete thought was of God himself
[51:34] becoming tangible. As a matter of fact,
[51:36] brother Ram tells us in future home that
[51:38] when God thought of becoming tangible or
[51:41] flesh, he thought of me and you. And
[51:44] then the prophet would tell us there was
[51:46] a Moses, there was a Jeremiah. All of
[51:48] them in their own time would be
[51:50] expressed. But yet here came the Lord
[51:52] Jesus, which would be God made flesh,
[51:54] who was the perfect and complete thought
[51:57] of God. And so every one of us chosen in
[51:59] him before the foundation of the world,
[52:01] we were there in him. So within that
[52:04] thought of himself becoming tangible and
[52:07] I want you to see it like this. Brother
[52:08] Ram tells us in the message adoption he
[52:10] says that Jehovah himself think of it.
[52:13] He says existing with his family. Now I
[52:15] want you to look at it like this. It's
[52:17] not just Jehovah here and his family
[52:19] there but Jehovah is a family.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; It's God becoming it's God in every one
[52:27] of our lives. So it's not God here and
[52:29] then us there, but it's actually God
[52:32] himself dwelling in the very midst of
[52:36] his the hearts of his people. Remember
[52:38] God said there to Israel, let him make
[52:40] me make me a tabernacle that I may dwell
[52:43] in the midst of them. So it's God
[52:45] dwelling with his family. God has longed
[52:47] as the prophet, I believe, says it like
[52:49] this in Christ the mystery, he loved
[52:51] fatherhood. And so God's desire was to
[52:55] so be able to have fellowship with his
[52:58] his children. There were those alonging
[53:00] within him. But in order for that to be
[53:02] fulfilled, there had to be the right
[53:04] bedding ground. And we know sin came
[53:06] along and it it was hindering it was
[53:08] blocking that from the expression. But
[53:10] then how that God came down and became
[53:13] one of us in order to pay the price and
[53:17] make a way back. I love how the prophet
[53:18] says it in wings of a dove. He talks
[53:20] about that dove falling in the camp and
[53:22] he said, "Oh," he said, "It wasn't a
[53:24] dove that fell in our camp, but it was
[53:26] one who came from home and he came down
[53:29] from home." You see what it was? It's
[53:31] that how God himself having those of his
[53:34] children that would be here in this
[53:36] earth and we were trapped in the
[53:39] conditions and the lives and where we
[53:41] were at. that God came down and become
[53:44] one of us that he might release us and
[53:47] bring us back into fellowship with him.
[53:50] I I want you to see this of even this
[53:52] expression through the scriptures on how
[53:55] that God himself coming down and the
[53:58] love that is expressed among that of and
[54:01] between and in the lives of his
[54:03] children. In Isaiah 14:13
[54:06] it says for thou hast said in thine
[54:08] heart this is Lucifer here his
[54:10] expressions of his heart I will ascend
[54:12] into heaven and I will exalt my throne
[54:14] above the stars of God or this phrase
[54:17] means Messiah's brothers. So then we see
[54:21] how that when God would become one of
[54:23] us, think about even in just one of the
[54:25] places of the resurrection, Jesus after
[54:28] he had raised, remember it had went from
[54:31] being servants to friends, the
[54:33] relationship now after the resurrection,
[54:36] go tell my brethren
[54:38] &gt;&gt; the the the price has been satisfied and
[54:42] I ascend unto my God and your God. Touch
[54:44] me not unto my father, your father. And
[54:47] we know that then as it goes into Romans
[54:50] 8:29, for whom he did forno, he also did
[54:54] predestinate to be conformed to the
[54:57] image of his son, that he might be the
[54:59] firstborn among many brethren.
[55:01] Hallelujah.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; So this conforming to the image was not
[55:04] that we would be the same stature as the
[55:07] body or the flesh of God that we would
[55:10] know that had took upon where God was
[55:13] able to descend and take upon the form
[55:15] or the human name of Jesus. It was not
[55:18] to make us like the prophet said to
[55:19] where in our physical we would bear a
[55:22] reflection of the physical image. He
[55:24] said, "But from our souls, we actually
[55:27] would bear the divine characteristic of
[55:30] his own nature." So he might be the
[55:33] firstborn among among many brother. In
[55:35] other words, he was the forerunner as
[55:38] Paul would say it. He was the witness of
[55:40] what is coming. And so what would that
[55:43] be? It would be now to where deity
[55:45] itself would not just come and move upon
[55:48] men like the prophets, but deity would
[55:51] absolutely tab tabernacle once again
[55:55] inside of flesh just as they knew it in
[55:58] the garden of Eden. What made Adam and
[56:00] Eve one in the garden of Eden? What was
[56:02] it that made them one with God? The
[56:04] prophet said, "What made them one with
[56:07] one another is because they were one
[56:09] with God." and being one with God, then
[56:11] they were one with another and there was
[56:14] a fellowship. And that's why the prophet
[56:16] said if there's something in a family or
[56:18] something in a home that is actually
[56:20] driving or breaking it apart, it shows
[56:23] that something is not right. So God's
[56:26] desire was is that that image would be
[56:29] there within our lives and that's how
[56:31] we're really united. Do you realize that
[56:33] even within that of a marriage, listen
[56:36] to me now because I'm not going to go
[56:37] here tonight on this, but do you realize
[56:39] in a marriage what actually is to hold
[56:41] you together? It's not something about
[56:43] that they're pleasing to you as though
[56:45] that everything is going around.
[56:47] Conditions are just right. Conditions
[56:49] will change. Not just physically, but
[56:52] even things hormonally, even things will
[56:55] change in our body. But this is one
[56:57] thing that must be there and that is the
[57:00] revelation that this is my mate.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[57:07] &gt;&gt; So within that revelation that's what
[57:09] the prophet said in marriage and divorce
[57:11] when that revelation whatsoever God hath
[57:13] joined together let man put us under.
[57:15] Let me just tell you something. If the
[57:17] devil God's not let me just tell you
[57:19] something. God's not going to put in
[57:20] your mind and bring confusion to you and
[57:22] run you in the ground with the word
[57:24] divorce. God hates divorce.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Now, I'm not talking
[57:29] about somebody staying around in an
[57:31] abusive situation or whatever more, but
[57:33] I'm talking about that God is not the
[57:35] one that facilitates that. He doesn't
[57:38] even drive people away from his
[57:41] presence. It is people themselves that
[57:44] make that kind of a decision. You say,
[57:46] "What do you work off of?" I'll tell you
[57:48] what you got to work off of. You've got
[57:50] to work off of that revelation that God
[57:52] placed in your heart. Amen.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? And shut out all
[57:57] other voices.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, we are real believers
[58:02] in this hour. I do not need secular
[58:05] advice from secular Christianity.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? They will lead to
[58:10] everything itself. They will try to
[58:13] propagate so much. You go to listen to
[58:15] that, fear will set into your life.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, you've got to come.
[58:19] This is where you have to resolve and
[58:21] reside on something deeper in your life.
[58:24] And what are you talking about? I'm
[58:25] talking about the love of God that God
[58:28] is watching over my life. And even
[58:30] within that within our homes, it should
[58:32] be even that of a of a revelation in our
[58:35] heart. Well, they're not a believer. Let
[58:37] me just tell you something. Let me just
[58:38] let me just give you a news flash. They
[58:40] might never be a believer.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; I don't mean to shatter anybody's
[58:45] confidence, but let's just say it like
[58:47] that. What if they never are? Will that
[58:49] change your love?
[58:51] &gt;&gt; No. No sir. No sir.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; God listen God loves he he came. The
[58:57] Bible said for God so loved the world
[59:00] that he gave his only begotten son.
[59:02] God's expression of love. But what
[59:05] matters is only those of the elect will
[59:08] be able to receive the depth that he
[59:10] expresses it for that of a mate.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Yet there'll be many others that can
[59:15] capture that and they experience
[59:16] salvation. They can experience it even
[59:19] to that depth and actually benefit from
[59:21] many of the attributes of love that
[59:23] they're able and able to capture from
[59:26] just a certain depth of salvation. What
[59:29] a marvelous thing.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; I mean, what a marvelous thing that even
[59:33] that God would provide hospitals,
[59:34] doctors, and surgeries. You know why?
[59:36] His desire is to see people well.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; He wants to see the atheists well.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; See, God's not conditional. Well, they
[59:45] don't believe me. So, I'm telling you,
[59:46] they're in the last in the line.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; That's not God.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; You see, that's our conditional.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; God's not conditional. I'm glad for that
[59:58] because how many times you and I have we
[1:00:00] before God really got a hold of our
[1:00:02] life, how many times did we push it out?
[1:00:04] How many times did we push it off? How
[1:00:06] many times even since we have been
[1:00:09] serving God, he's been long-suffering
[1:00:11] with us as a faithful husband?
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. He didn't kick us to
[1:00:16] the curb.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz if he did that, he'd
[1:00:19] hurt himself.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; He's put up with you and me. You know
[1:00:27] why? Cuz we're a part of him. And God
[1:00:29] didn't going around gathering the angels
[1:00:30] and saying, "Hey, let me tell y'all
[1:00:32] something. I I'm telling you, Paul, you
[1:00:35] would not believe this. God don't go
[1:00:36] around and complain about you.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; How in the world did I get here? God
[1:00:44] does not go around. That creates an
[1:00:46] atmosphere. You know what the prophet
[1:00:48] said? He said in uniting time and sign.
[1:00:50] When you complain, you weaken faith.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're wanting, oh, I want I
[1:00:57] want Brother Samuel to lay hands on me,
[1:00:59] man. This is going to go away. You have
[1:01:01] work to do in your own life. Say, God,
[1:01:05] let my tongue, let my mouth be so
[1:01:07] guarded by the love of God. I don't want
[1:01:10] to complain. Yeah, there's a lot of
[1:01:11] things to complain about.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says, "Let us have a
[1:01:16] powerful and positive confession. He is
[1:01:20] the apostle and high priest of our
[1:01:23] profession."
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; How many know it's true?
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; You confess negative things, words carry
[1:01:30] spirits.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Right? You go to talking critical there
[1:01:33] on your job. Watch. There'll be not a
[1:01:35] lot of other buzzards come around too
[1:01:37] because there's a lot of other people
[1:01:38] that'll join right in with that spirit.
[1:01:40] What does that was? There a memo set
[1:01:42] out. Hey, hey, over this cute cubicle
[1:01:44] right here. We're getting ready to grill
[1:01:45] the boss. We're getting ready to fry
[1:01:46] him, blister him, butter him up. We're
[1:01:48] Hey, why don't y'all join over here for
[1:01:50] a good barbecue on the boss? What does
[1:01:52] that how does all that get over here and
[1:01:54] all of a sudden there is just a
[1:01:56] gathering standing there? What does that
[1:01:58] spirits?
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Samuel, I'm a child of God. Do
[1:02:02] you mean that I can get under the
[1:02:03] influence of a spirit? Absolutely.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Absolutely sir.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said when he was
[1:02:10] getting into a place when different ones
[1:02:12] were coming off a plane talking about a
[1:02:14] Allen talking about different ones in
[1:02:16] India word made flesh he said I begin to
[1:02:18] realize forming up in me was a critical
[1:02:20] spirit. At the end of that message he
[1:02:22] said I want you to pray for me. God will
[1:02:24] deliver me of this selfish spirit that's
[1:02:26] come around my life. It's a critical
[1:02:28] spirit.
[1:02:33] Everybody said
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; I got a lot more quotes like that, but
[1:02:37] I'm not that's not for tonight.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; I don't even have it in any of the
[1:02:40] upcoming outlines. But I'm just I'm
[1:02:42] saying these things are placed within
[1:02:43] there so that you and I you know why
[1:02:45] those things are placed in there? It
[1:02:46] doesn't give the believer a loophole.
[1:02:48] You know what it does to a real child of
[1:02:50] God? It gives you and I strength because
[1:02:52] you recognize by the word, wait a minute
[1:02:54] here, that on the inside is who I am.
[1:02:56] It's repelling. It's resisting that even
[1:02:59] when you have fallen in that kind of a
[1:03:01] of a stuper right there, you can't
[1:03:03] remain there. Why? That's why the
[1:03:05] prophet said that being in God's mind
[1:03:08] gives you an eternal quality that you
[1:03:11] cannot get away from.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; That's why a backslider cannot remain
[1:03:15] content out there. This is why that even
[1:03:18] in your life you cannot take even joy
[1:03:22] and satisfaction with worldly things
[1:03:24] because you were not meant to be
[1:03:26] employed or service to worldly things.
[1:03:29] You were meant to serve the will of God.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Thanks be to God for his grace.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; So good.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; We're sheep, aren't we?
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; And we sure need the shepherd.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. firstborn among many brethren.
[1:03:48] My my. Hebrews chapter 2 verse1 17.
[1:03:52] Wherefore in all things it behooved him
[1:03:55] to be made like his brethren that he
[1:03:59] might be merciful and faithful high
[1:04:00] priest and things pertaining to God to
[1:04:03] make reconciliation for the sins of his
[1:04:06] people. So why did he become one of us?
[1:04:09] It was him.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; His love.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; That's who he is. That's what brought
[1:04:14] him down.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; It was his love for what? For his
[1:04:19] children.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; And yet, how many people are benefiting
[1:04:23] because of his love for his elect?
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; I'll just be honest with you, that don't
[1:04:28] bother me a bit.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; It don't bother me a bit that somebody
[1:04:30] experiences salvation of that degree. I
[1:04:32] thank God for that. Yes,
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Right. It's like I've said before, if
[1:04:36] we're swimming in the pool and my daddy
[1:04:38] I'm drowning and somebody else is
[1:04:39] drowning and my daddy pulls me out of
[1:04:41] the pool, I'm his son. pulling me out of
[1:04:42] the pool didn't change me. But if he
[1:04:44] pulls my friend out of the pool that's
[1:04:45] drowning, he's he didn't become a son,
[1:04:47] but at least he's not drowning no more.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? This is something I
[1:04:52] could rejoice in. I don't say, "Why did
[1:04:54] you do No, no. We can rejoice in that
[1:04:56] part of God's saving grace.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; My his brethren." So, this is where he's
[1:05:03] coming. It's it's kinship. It's kin
[1:05:05] folks. It's God himself becoming one of
[1:05:08] us. Notice when we look at this here how
[1:05:11] the prophet I love how he says it here
[1:05:12] in God's provided place of worship in
[1:05:15] him dwells the fullness of the godhead
[1:05:17] bodily where we in there are sons and
[1:05:22] daughters to God in God's godhead as
[1:05:26] sons and daughters were in the family if
[1:05:29] you're in there
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; now coming in there does not put us in
[1:05:34] the family but it brings us into the
[1:05:37] relationship ship through and by the
[1:05:40] blood that was shed. And the spirit of
[1:05:43] God has made it real to us as the Bible
[1:05:46] says by one spirit we are all baptized
[1:05:49] into one body. And then in there well
[1:05:52] you say what what happens in there? Well
[1:05:54] then coming in there see the love that
[1:05:57] would reach out to us. Think about this
[1:05:58] as young people or different ones that
[1:06:00] coming around you know believers. What's
[1:06:02] being expressed even as everybody there
[1:06:05] can there's such you know at times look
[1:06:06] every in every church there's you know
[1:06:08] all there's three kinds of believers.
[1:06:09] But as I said, I'm I'm I'm not focused
[1:06:12] on who's what, who's this. I'm preaching
[1:06:14] and I'm standing on that everyone is a
[1:06:16] believer. Cuz you know what? I have no
[1:06:18] other information and I don't want any.
[1:06:20] And I thank God for that.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Because God knows even what you and I
[1:06:26] would be able to handle.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; But see, God would would express God
[1:06:34] would express his life. And here when a
[1:06:37] person is actually comes to that place
[1:06:40] to where the love of God has so taken a
[1:06:42] hold of their life, it's led them into
[1:06:44] repentance, they've been baptized in the
[1:06:46] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, their
[1:06:47] life has been cleaned up and sanctified
[1:06:50] and set aside from from all of the evil.
[1:06:52] And the spirit of God now comes to bring
[1:06:55] them into the body. Then here they are.
[1:06:59] They are dwelling in the very divine
[1:07:02] love itself. And within their life,
[1:07:04] within your life is the same love in
[1:07:08] your life that brought him down to you
[1:07:11] and brought him to deal with your life.
[1:07:14] That same love is now working and you
[1:07:17] become a part of the conduit.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? It's like a hose that's
[1:07:23] out here. You run from one end to the
[1:07:25] other. And if it's not long enough, you
[1:07:27] put another hose to it.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; The water don't change. Now that hose
[1:07:31] gets joined together. And what happens
[1:07:34] when God moves down there in our lives?
[1:07:36] We've been baptized in to the body of
[1:07:39] Christ. Remember, as a seed, you are a
[1:07:41] channel for the Holy Spirit now to
[1:07:44] operate through as a son and daughter of
[1:07:46] God. What does that make you then? It's
[1:07:48] God's love now being expressed through
[1:07:51] and in your life. You become a channel
[1:07:53] or a conduit for the love of God.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; So, we're in the family if you're in
[1:07:59] there. Now, watch how Peter would bring
[1:08:00] this about. He says in 1 Peter chapter
[1:08:04] 1:22, "Seeing you have purified your
[1:08:06] souls in obeying the truth through the
[1:08:10] spirit." So, the spirit is dealing and
[1:08:13] leading in lives and bringing us to that
[1:08:15] place in obedience. No. So obeying the
[1:08:18] truth through the spirit unto unfeigned
[1:08:22] love of the brethren. Now watch how
[1:08:25] watch how he says this. See that you
[1:08:27] love one another with a pure heart
[1:08:30] fervently. So there's an aspect to it
[1:08:32] that even after that's come there's a
[1:08:34] stewardship that must be kept in our
[1:08:36] lives. Being born again. So how is this
[1:08:39] made possible? being born again not of
[1:08:41] corruptible seed but of incorruptible by
[1:08:44] the word of God which liveth and abideth
[1:08:47] forever. So it's absolutely as the
[1:08:50] scripture has said you have obeyed the
[1:08:51] truth through the spirit unto what
[1:08:54] unfeign love of the brethren. So, not
[1:08:57] only have you come fully into obedience
[1:09:00] into the truth, the spirit has brought
[1:09:02] you there, but also with that arriving
[1:09:05] in this place, you have now come to the
[1:09:08] place of unfeigned love. In other words,
[1:09:11] it's not something that you have to
[1:09:13] pretend put on. Unfeign means it's not
[1:09:16] hypocritical.
[1:09:18] Now, I'm not going to ask you to raise
[1:09:19] your hands, but there's times for every
[1:09:22] one of us in here, even even as you're
[1:09:24] filled with the spirit of God, that
[1:09:26] sometimes you have felt like a hypocrite
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; because you didn't have the certain
[1:09:32] feeling
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; and yet you were doing what was
[1:09:36] absolutely required of you to do. And it
[1:09:39] was something that you were looking at
[1:09:41] the word and say God my feelings and
[1:09:43] things just aren't there right now but I
[1:09:46] am standing on your word and I will not
[1:09:48] allow this feeling to reside in my life.
[1:09:51] You know what that's called? Overcoming.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; This scripture here is not about light
[1:09:56] switches on the wall that all of a
[1:09:58] sudden where somebody does something
[1:10:00] that you don't agree with or somebody
[1:10:01] steps on your toes and automatically
[1:10:04] boom there's a switch that goes on. Oh
[1:10:05] but brother Samuel that switch is on all
[1:10:07] the time. You still have feelings and
[1:10:11] those feelings are not in your soul.
[1:10:13] Thank God you've got feelings. Brother
[1:10:15] Ram tells us, could you imagine what
[1:10:17] life would be like without feelings?
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; But you see your feelings, listen to me,
[1:10:23] that's why we do not rest or reside upon
[1:10:27] our feelings because there's times you
[1:10:29] feel like a Christian and there's other
[1:10:31] times you don't feel like a Christian.
[1:10:33] So let's just use that example. So the
[1:10:36] times that you don't feel like a
[1:10:37] Christian, what do you do? Do you just
[1:10:39] do you just, you know, lay around and
[1:10:41] run back out in the world? You don't
[1:10:43] because you know why? You have no
[1:10:45] connection with the world when the Holy
[1:10:48] Spirit has come into your life. And
[1:10:50] you'll find yourself doing what?
[1:10:52] Pressing and getting down to pray.
[1:10:55] Pressing and reading your Bible. Putting
[1:10:57] on a tape. And you don't feel no more
[1:10:59] spiritual than a man in the moon.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Anybody know what I'm talking about? But
[1:11:04] why are you doing that that's called a
[1:11:06] sacrifice? What is that that's causing
[1:11:09] you to do that?
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; It's what is down on the inside. You
[1:11:16] know, I'm not going to let my feelings
[1:11:18] keep me away. You may not have felt like
[1:11:20] coming to church, but you're not going
[1:11:22] to let your feelings dictate who and
[1:11:25] what you are. Your feelings are not you
[1:11:28] as a son and daughter of God. But the
[1:11:30] son and daughter of God is that
[1:11:31] expressed attribute
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; on the inside.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Don't you love the Lord?
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Brother says in prodal, he said, I know
[1:11:46] a friend who will stick by you if you
[1:11:48] haven't got a penny. Jesus Christ, the
[1:11:50] son of God. I've been to a place where I
[1:11:52] had not sent. He loved me. He loved me
[1:11:55] just as much. If I wouldn't have had a
[1:11:57] penny as if he we' had a million
[1:11:59] dollars. He loves you just the same.
[1:12:00] Look at this. That pure, holy,
[1:12:03] unadulterated love comes from God alone
[1:12:07] down into his people.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; So, this isn't a love that we've
[1:12:12] mustered up.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; But the obedience of the truth through
[1:12:18] the spirit unto unfeign love of the
[1:12:20] brethren. How does that become? Because
[1:12:22] now you are fully baptized into the body
[1:12:27] of Jesus Christ, the brotherhood.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Woo. Glory.
[1:12:34] Because he took part of flesh and blood
[1:12:38] like his brethren.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; You were always a son and daughter of
[1:12:42] God. We were always his brethren. But
[1:12:45] that relationship
[1:12:47] could not even be spoken of or requested
[1:12:51] until after the resurrection. And when
[1:12:53] he raised, he never said, "Go tell my
[1:12:55] friends."
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; John 15, he called them friends.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Right? Transition from servants. But
[1:13:02] after the resurrection, he said, "I
[1:13:04] ain't going to call you church. I'm
[1:13:05] going to call you bride." It was a
[1:13:08] change in relationship.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Who was that that initiated that change?
[1:13:14] and would be able to actually bring
[1:13:16] about what was needed for that change to
[1:13:19] become an expression. It was God
[1:13:21] himself. Who is it that has brought
[1:13:23] about and initiated this change that you
[1:13:26] and I could be called sons and daughters
[1:13:29] of God in this hour? That Christ, the
[1:13:32] mighty angel, descended with an open
[1:13:34] book in his hand and begin to proclaim
[1:13:37] the rights of sons and daughters of God
[1:13:40] to rise in this hour.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he provided what was needed
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; for us to become what the word was
[1:13:47] speaking over our lives.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. That pure, holy,
[1:13:52] unadulterated love comes from God alone
[1:13:55] down into his people. That's the way we
[1:13:58] should love one another with that godly
[1:14:03] love.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; This are you saying that sometimes
[1:14:08] feeling will never come? No, I'm telling
[1:14:10] you it'll come.
[1:14:11] It'll come. And you know what it'll
[1:14:14] come? It'll come from us submitting to
[1:14:16] the God who lives in us.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; It'll come. You know what it'll do
[1:14:19] within those times like that that get
[1:14:21] hard? Those are the times. You know what
[1:14:22] God permits that to do? What? He's
[1:14:24] getting more of the greenness out of our
[1:14:26] life. And God is also, it's driving us
[1:14:28] into the presence where we need to be.
[1:14:30] You know, God knows just how to actually
[1:14:32] mold and shape our lives. You know, let
[1:14:34] me tell you that many of the things that
[1:14:36] are birthed and born in our life, it
[1:14:38] can't be birthed or born without there
[1:14:39] being a death. You can never be born
[1:14:41] again unless you die to yourself.
[1:14:43] There's no way in the world that it can
[1:14:45] actually come forth of more of God in
[1:14:47] our life without us coming into
[1:14:49] situations that will lead us as a lamb.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Is led before her sheerers dumb.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; So that's good.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Well, y'all think we can go on?
[1:15:09] Father God, we are so happy tonight to
[1:15:11] know that this group of people love us
[1:15:13] and we love them and all together we
[1:15:15] love you. And it's because of your love
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; that we love one another.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; It's because of his love.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Now remember, loving one another doesn't
[1:15:25] mean that we see eye to eye.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; God's not even interested in us trying
[1:15:30] to persuade one another.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; God's not interested in that. that
[1:15:35] that's where the battle gets lost. It
[1:15:37] gets lost not only in church, it'll get
[1:15:39] lost in home life as well.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; You're all of a sudden going to make a
[1:15:45] transition into dinner and now bringing
[1:15:47] up what happened last night or this or
[1:15:50] that or a week ago and all of a sudden
[1:15:52] you might as well have put spoiled meat
[1:15:55] on the plate.
[1:15:58] You might as well just put a bunch of
[1:16:00] garbage on the plate and sit here.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Why? You're bringing things up. Well,
[1:16:05] that that's got to be salt. No, what it
[1:16:07] is is that let God remedy it in your
[1:16:10] heart.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Those things are test in your life. Let
[1:16:14] me tell you something, friends. Your
[1:16:16] marriage and all these other things,
[1:16:17] Lord have mercy, these are not things
[1:16:19] that you look at, well, if I can just
[1:16:20] get this out of the way, if I can just
[1:16:22] get this out of the way, if I can just
[1:16:23] get this out of the way. Do you realize
[1:16:24] God allows things for you and I to go
[1:16:27] through in order to bring things out in
[1:16:30] our lives?
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; If we're looking for some sort of a
[1:16:35] picnic, God knows what will bring things
[1:16:38] out of our lives.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said in the
[1:16:41] message Exodus, he said, "Think of Moses
[1:16:44] and Zapora." He said Moses himself,
[1:16:47] meakest man in all the earth, but yet he
[1:16:49] had a temper. And he said his wife had a
[1:16:51] temper, too. He said, "No doubt
[1:16:53] sometimes there were things hot on the
[1:16:56] backside of the desert."
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Let me finish the quote. He said, "How
[1:17:01] do you know that God didn't give you
[1:17:03] that woman? That's your cross to bear."
[1:17:05] And also for the women, "How do you know
[1:17:07] that God didn't give you that man?
[1:17:08] That's your cross to bear." It may not
[1:17:10] be temper. It may be you having to pick
[1:17:12] up their dirty socks, pick up everything
[1:17:14] and everything else around them, and do
[1:17:16] everything else and use. Oh my, if I
[1:17:19] didn't have to sit around and pick this
[1:17:20] up, I might actually be able to get
[1:17:22] something done during the day. But God
[1:17:24] would allow that cross to be born for
[1:17:27] what purpose? To bring more of himself
[1:17:30] out of you and I.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; But it's when we fight against it,
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; trying to pray it away
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; instead of saying, "God, give me the
[1:17:39] grace
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; to become what you want me and would
[1:17:43] have me to become."
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:51] That's so good.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Notice he says, "Even though you may be
[1:17:56] an unbeliever or skeptic, that don't
[1:17:57] keep me from loving you. I do it anyhow
[1:18:00] cuz it's not me that does the loving.
[1:18:03] It's the Lord Jesus in my heart
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; that makes me love you."
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; See, I love words like this. I should
[1:18:11] have I should have put that make in big
[1:18:13] gigantic letters.
[1:18:17] You know why? Because when God gave you
[1:18:20] and brought you in the will of God and
[1:18:22] he changed your nature, he never
[1:18:25] stripped away your self-will.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Let me prove it to you. In the Garden of
[1:18:32] Eden,
[1:18:34] here after the Lord Jesus God come down
[1:18:36] into such a way in in among us, here he
[1:18:40] was in the Garden of Eden. Nevertheless,
[1:18:42] not my way. If it's possible, let this
[1:18:44] cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not my
[1:18:47] will, thine will be done. You know what
[1:18:49] the prophet said? He said he was
[1:18:51] contending with himself.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you, who do you contend with?
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother say my wife. No, it ain't
[1:18:59] your wife.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother. It ain't your brother.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; It's how it bothers you.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; It's how it affects you.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; You're not contending with somebody
[1:19:10] else. This is why we need to call the
[1:19:12] devil's hand to it instead of pointing
[1:19:14] out like this is the enemy. This is not
[1:19:17] the enemy. The enemy is right here.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; This is our biggest enemy.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; And you know what? If you didn't have
[1:19:26] feelings, it wouldn't bother you.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; But you have feelings. And thank God
[1:19:32] you've got feelings.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; But make sure you submit those feelings
[1:19:35] to God each and every moment of your
[1:19:38] life.
[1:19:42] My my my
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; it's not me that does the loving. It's
[1:19:48] the Lord Jesus in my heart that makes me
[1:19:51] love you. I know some of you already
[1:19:53] read the quote ahead of me, but you're
[1:19:55] going to have to wait on me. And me as a
[1:19:58] man, I wouldn't do it. I I'd want to
[1:20:02] know why, when, and how.
[1:20:05] But the Christ in my heart says this is
[1:20:10] me.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; I died for that person.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; So it's all right. No matter what you
[1:20:16] do, I still love you anyhow. Not from my
[1:20:19] lips, from my heart.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; And every Christian does the same thing
[1:20:24] as long as Jesus abides in the heart.
[1:20:28] Right?
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Just as much as the spirit of God, the
[1:20:32] love of God in the heart of the prophet
[1:20:34] would not allow that critical spirit to
[1:20:36] remain there.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says in another place,
[1:20:40] negative. He had become negative.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God would not allow that
[1:20:44] to remain in his life.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; To think about how that this will not
[1:20:51] allow those things remain. Remember when
[1:20:54] that rain came up there,
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:58] Brother Bram sized him up.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; What was happening? The same kind of a
[1:21:04] reaction of when he walked through that
[1:21:07] pasture where that bull was.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; He was looking for his gun.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; It wasn't there. God seen to it. The
[1:21:18] prophet said he left it on the truck.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Cuz if he'd had that gun, that have been
[1:21:22] one dead boy.
[1:21:23] See, God allowed him to be put in a
[1:21:26] situation where it was flesh and blood
[1:21:29] could not deal with it.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; You know why God did that? He didn't do
[1:21:33] that to lift up William Brandom. God was
[1:21:35] doing that to lift up himself before his
[1:21:38] children and say there are things even
[1:21:41] in your own life that will be difficult
[1:21:43] for flesh and blood. But that is where
[1:21:46] you will need to rely on me and I will
[1:21:50] step in. and I will take the battle. The
[1:21:53] battle is not yours,
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; but the battle is mine, sayaeth the
[1:21:58] Lord,
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; God did that for you and I. He allowed
[1:22:02] that to be recorded for you and I.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:22:16] And every Christian does the same thing
[1:22:18] as long as Jesus abides in the heart. He
[1:22:20] said, "If you can just love those who
[1:22:22] love you
[1:22:24] while the sinners do the same thing."
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Now, first part of this quote,
[1:22:31] I'll get to it in a minute. The first
[1:22:32] quot part of this quote, Brother Brham's
[1:22:34] rebuking the people for Pentecostal
[1:22:36] cussing.
[1:22:37] Pentecostal cussing. He's Yeah. This is
[1:22:39] what Brother Bram called Pentecostal
[1:22:40] cussing. Somebody's driving at you with
[1:22:42] their bright lights and you put your
[1:22:43] bright lights, you're going to drive
[1:22:44] right at them.
[1:22:46] Brother said that's Pentecostal cursing.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Listen, listen, listen. Brother and
[1:22:53] sister, you understand? The word's
[1:22:54] calling us to a higher standard.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; That's why it's calling us to come up
[1:22:57] higher.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; And we're not coming, we're not hitting
[1:23:00] the ceiling. There's a door that's open.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? John heard a voice say,
[1:23:05] "Come up."
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; There's a door that's open.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; And rapture, let me just tell you,
[1:23:11] rapture is not something that's going to
[1:23:13] take place on a day. It's happening
[1:23:15] right now in your life. When the spirit
[1:23:17] of God begin to lead you through
[1:23:19] justification, sanctification, and the
[1:23:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost, it's God
[1:23:23] catching you away. What's he doing? He's
[1:23:25] catching you away from all of your
[1:23:27] senses unto himself. It's God
[1:23:30] continuing. And the rapture itself,
[1:23:32] rapture morning, will be a culmination
[1:23:34] of a life that's been lived daily and
[1:23:37] being caught away.
[1:23:40] Brother Samuel, what about my faults?
[1:23:43] What about my failures? What about my
[1:23:45] mistakes? Rapturing grace has come to
[1:23:47] catch you away because rapturing grace
[1:23:49] will not allow you to remain where he
[1:23:51] has never saw you to be.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; You were chosen before him in love.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; And so the way that he deals with you
[1:23:58] and speaks to your life, speaks to my
[1:24:00] life is based on that right there. He's
[1:24:02] never had a new thought of you. He's
[1:24:04] never had a new picture of you. That's
[1:24:06] exactly how he's working and dealing
[1:24:08] with your life. Hallelujah.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; I know it's overwhelming, isn't it? It's
[1:24:13] overwhelming because we look at the
[1:24:15] person in the mirror the whole time. But
[1:24:16] I want you to understand the person you
[1:24:18] see in the mirror with all of his
[1:24:19] mistakes and failures. It's not the
[1:24:21] person that's there on that family
[1:24:23] album. The person that's on that family
[1:24:25] album is the real you that has a desire
[1:24:27] to please God more than anything else.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Wow. Amen.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; You know it's y'all's fault if I don't
[1:24:39] get nowhere.
[1:24:45] If we can just love those who love you
[1:24:47] while the sinners do the same thing. But
[1:24:49] we are different when Christ has come
[1:24:51] into our heart. We love those who do not
[1:24:55] love us. Love the unlovable. And we were
[1:24:58] unlovable one time too, you know. And
[1:25:01] Christ loved us until we came to him.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Now, just think about that for a moment.
[1:25:08] He loved us
[1:25:10] through everything
[1:25:13] until we come to him. He didn't stop.
[1:25:17] His love is unending. He's eternal.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Through it all,
[1:25:22] he didn't say, "Walked out of a service
[1:25:25] again or they went away."
[1:25:29] He keeps on wooing.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; He keeps on working.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God. And then if we be
[1:25:36] of Christ and Christ is in us, we have
[1:25:40] that same spirit of fellowship.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; And cooperation
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; and helping
[1:25:50] oursel. Wait a minute. helping to try to
[1:25:53] move the great load and make life a
[1:25:57] little easier for ourselves.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; No, that must have been the self-living
[1:26:02] translation.
[1:26:04] And make life a little easier for our
[1:26:07] fellow man. That that's what the spirit
[1:26:08] of God does.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Look how he comes to work in your life.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Look what what's he done. He's come to
[1:26:14] lead us into fellowship.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; He works in our life to bring about
[1:26:17] what? Cooperation.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. He works to do what? Make life a
[1:26:22] little easier. You know what? God comes
[1:26:24] down in services and there might be
[1:26:26] things that he, you know, and I'm not
[1:26:28] going to say that God puts things on the
[1:26:30] side, but God knows just what you and I
[1:26:31] have need of. And sometimes we have, oh
[1:26:33] Lord, this is my need. And yet God is
[1:26:36] looking at it really what the real need
[1:26:37] is. is not that first priority, but
[1:26:40] there's another need in your life to get
[1:26:42] you lifted up in your heart, in your
[1:26:44] spirit to where you can actually look by
[1:26:46] faith to receive what he already has
[1:26:49] done for you.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; So, here there comes a real brotherhood.
[1:26:57] Let me just let me have just a few more
[1:26:59] moments because I know I'm not even
[1:27:00] going to get in going to get finished
[1:27:02] with this, but there comes a
[1:27:04] brotherhood. And a brotherhood is that
[1:27:06] of of a family of a kinship that it
[1:27:09] would be between a body of believers.
[1:27:12] Now, does God want us to would God does
[1:27:15] God want us to express love toward all?
[1:27:18] Well, yeah. I mean, there's not like a
[1:27:19] switch where you express a different
[1:27:21] kind of a love as say, you know, to
[1:27:23] where well, I'm not going to, you know,
[1:27:25] to to those that are that are that are
[1:27:26] out there in the world. No, we're we're
[1:27:28] to express love. But there should be
[1:27:31] among the family of God.
[1:27:34] Even even those that would proclaim and
[1:27:38] working their way into that place to be
[1:27:40] to come into that place with God and God
[1:27:42] is working on their lives. You know
[1:27:44] what? You know what? Even sometimes the
[1:27:45] things that we are looking at and where
[1:27:47] maybe you can look at a person and say,
[1:27:49] "Well, I ain't seen why they moved or I
[1:27:50] ain't seen this or I ain't seen this."
[1:27:52] You know what? God allows those things
[1:27:53] for you and I to pray.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; And for us to express love and
[1:27:58] encouragement. You want to encourage
[1:27:59] somebody,
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; You don't want to go and tear down, you
[1:28:03] know, somebody's trying to do something
[1:28:04] with art. You don't want to tear down
[1:28:06] what they're doing. You want to try to
[1:28:07] encourage them along. I'm not talking
[1:28:08] about building a false hope. But I'm
[1:28:10] talking about to be an encourager.
[1:28:12] Because after it all, the new birth is
[1:28:15] not a work of flesh and blood. It's not
[1:28:18] something we're chided into, not
[1:28:20] something we're rebuked into. But the
[1:28:22] divine love of God by the new birth is
[1:28:25] where the spirit of God draws out of a
[1:28:27] life a surrender to God.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; You never were born again because of
[1:28:33] condemnation. You were never born again
[1:28:36] because of malign treatment. You were
[1:28:39] born again when you finally could see
[1:28:42] the expression of God's love to you
[1:28:45] personally.
[1:28:48] And so sometimes God will allow things
[1:28:50] among a body and everywhere else to see.
[1:28:54] Do you have the patience you need?
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Do you have the love that you need? Oh,
[1:28:59] I tell you, we're right there at
[1:29:00] Capstone. We're right up there. Really?
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Maybe I'm just preaching to me.
[1:29:14] Maybe I'll just go look in a mirror, but
[1:29:16] I'll look at y'all behind me.
[1:29:18] John 13:34-35. This is familiar
[1:29:21] scripture. A new commandment I give unto
[1:29:23] you, that ye love one another
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; as I have loved you. Notice as I have
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; the same degree.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; How is that possible?
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Because of his love.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Because of the Holy Ghost. Yes, sir.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; As I have loved you, that ye also love
[1:29:44] one another. And by this shall all men
[1:29:47] know that you are my disciples if you
[1:29:49] have love one to another.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; So you mean we're not known to be
[1:29:54] disciples of God because we can explain
[1:29:57] the mysteries?
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Because remember Paul said, "You can
[1:30:02] understand all mysteries and have not
[1:30:03] charity means nothing."
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; What you saying, brother Samuel? I'm
[1:30:06] saying there's got to be something
[1:30:07] deeper than what's just up here.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:10] You can know all the mysteries, tie
[1:30:12] everything together, and this and that.
[1:30:13] Paul talked about it with gifts, but
[1:30:15] there's got to be a greater substance on
[1:30:16] the inside, and that of divine love.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; That's what means everything.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; The word of God by the spirit of God
[1:30:27] dwelling in our life by this. Because
[1:30:30] think about it. Think about it. Usually,
[1:30:34] it's very rare. You take times where
[1:30:36] people get offended at work. out here.
[1:30:38] Pink slip gone.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; See you.
[1:30:43] You didn't you didn't you didn't treat
[1:30:44] me right or this or that. We understand
[1:30:45] those pressures. All of us understand
[1:30:47] those pressures.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; There's times when I worked within
[1:30:49] teaching and and some of the places I've
[1:30:51] been some of the days, boy, I'll tell
[1:30:52] you what, some things get hard. They get
[1:30:54] you know what you you go to just
[1:30:55] thinking about something one time as
[1:30:57] though that oh that ain't that bad and
[1:30:59] that pressure that brother or sister. Go
[1:31:00] ahead and start thinking like that. God
[1:31:02] will make sure you understand that.
[1:31:04] Uh-huh. That's right.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; God will make sure you understand it.
[1:31:09] He's not trying to rub our nose in it,
[1:31:10] but he wants you to understand that this
[1:31:12] pressure, you may not be built in a
[1:31:14] certain way. Maybe there's certain
[1:31:15] complexes that you don't have. Although
[1:31:17] we all have complexes, but there might
[1:31:19] be certain things that you're not
[1:31:20] dealing with that will have to be worked
[1:31:22] out in that person and that individual's
[1:31:24] life just as much as there's things in
[1:31:26] our lives. But it still comes down to
[1:31:29] the place to where when we're looking at
[1:31:31] all of this and to be able to just
[1:31:33] submit our hearts and our lives to God
[1:31:36] and for God to work out his perfection,
[1:31:39] his his his will within our lives. And
[1:31:42] we we look at this and think my as I
[1:31:45] have loved you to that same degree
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; and by this
[1:31:52] shall all men know you're my disciples.
[1:31:54] Remember among the early church
[1:31:58] when the strangers and different ones
[1:32:01] were around them
[1:32:04] the testament was behold
[1:32:07] brother tells about in a church age book
[1:32:09] behold how they love one another
[1:32:13] because you know what let me just tell
[1:32:14] you something
[1:32:16] it takes work
[1:32:19] when there's differences
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; and you know what it's easier just to
[1:32:24] say, "See you.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; I'll go to another church.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; I'll go to another job."
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, problems will find you
[1:32:33] there as well.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Cuz you know what? Every church is made
[1:32:37] up of multiple dispositions of people.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; But there's one nature or disposition
[1:32:45] that's to be the predominating factor,
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; and that's to be the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Trust me, I've been in multiple
[1:32:52] churches, rub shoulders in certain
[1:32:54] churches with more and many of the
[1:32:56] people and they are as different as
[1:32:58] night is today.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah. They have people in there that you
[1:33:04] know that don't I mean it's just like
[1:33:06] hey I mean hey you know it's just their
[1:33:08] personality their makeup it don't
[1:33:10] matter. Then you have other people that
[1:33:12] everything has got to be down to a
[1:33:13] certain line all within the same church.
[1:33:17] So it isn't that God puts together, oh
[1:33:19] this group of people, they're all
[1:33:21] natured alike. No,
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; what kind of a victory would that show?
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Really, that's what the Holy Ghost come
[1:33:29] to do is make us all alike. Come on.
[1:33:31] I've been preaching on this for a while
[1:33:32] now.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; That's not victory. But victory is where
[1:33:36] we can be as different as night today in
[1:33:39] our makeup, but have the love of God in
[1:33:42] our hearts. It's the love of God that
[1:33:45] joins us together, not how much we see
[1:33:48] alike.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. It wasn't until after
[1:33:56] my wife and I got married that I
[1:33:57] realized how different we were.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; I don't say that in a bad way. So, I
[1:34:06] hope that didn't come out that way.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; But you know what? God has to teach had
[1:34:10] to teach this guy. How in the world
[1:34:13] tonight I'm not even planning on this,
[1:34:16] but God had to teach this guy how to be
[1:34:19] a servant.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; God had to teach me.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know. Boy, I thought I had it all
[1:34:26] when I went into marriage. I thought I
[1:34:27] knew it all. What a knucklehead.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about me. I'm talking me.
[1:34:35] me me. How foolish I was. That's why you
[1:34:39] want to run to people and talk about
[1:34:40] they're going to talk about how they're
[1:34:41] going to raise their kids in Americ
[1:34:43] [Laughter]
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; because you're not even there yet to
[1:34:50] experience it.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Maybe we can just stand and sing When
[1:34:58] the Saints Go Marching In.
[1:35:03] This is not coming out like I thought it
[1:35:05] would.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; By this shall all men know that you're
[1:35:09] my disciples if you have love one to
[1:35:11] another. These things
[1:35:14] I command you that you love one another.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; And notice how this phrase, you'll find
[1:35:20] this same phrase in that verse, this
[1:35:22] verse, and all the way through the book
[1:35:24] of John.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Love one another. So it's not just
[1:35:28] something that's to beep
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; like sonarep
[1:35:37] love one another. You see there has to
[1:35:40] be something that's there of a
[1:35:43] corresponding part
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; that is able to actually
[1:35:48] catch
[1:35:49] that love and be able to reciprocate it.
[1:35:55] Let me leave you with this scripture. We
[1:35:57] love him
[1:35:59] because he first loved us.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; So, so what happened as we begin to
[1:36:06] believe, we become love.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; So, as the spirit of God being projected
[1:36:11] in our life and it brings us to that
[1:36:13] place till now, we're not loving God
[1:36:17] with our spirit
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; because the affection gate is a gate in
[1:36:23] the spirit. But we're loving God with
[1:36:27] his own love.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; This is why that Paul would write, "Who
[1:36:32] shall separate us
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; from the love of God?"
[1:36:37] See, when that when that has when that
[1:36:39] has come into that place within the
[1:36:41] heart of a believer, what can separate
[1:36:44] you? Paul said pearls would come,
[1:36:46] distresses, all sorts of things will
[1:36:48] take place, but nothing can take the
[1:36:50] place of the love of God. Oh, yeah. You
[1:36:52] might get down. That's right. Sometimes
[1:36:54] you might talk negative like man alive.
[1:36:56] I mean it seems like it's raining cats
[1:36:58] and dogs are running more. That's just
[1:36:59] this outer realm.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; But you see the greatness of the love of
[1:37:03] God on the inside. You know what? You
[1:37:05] might even get and say get so down and
[1:37:07] weary you're not even here on Thursday
[1:37:08] night. You don't show up to a Sunday
[1:37:10] morning service. But let me tell you
[1:37:12] something. If the love of God is in your
[1:37:14] heart, you can't stay that way.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; You can't stay that way.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; It'll it'll bring you right back to the
[1:37:21] fold because what is it? It's not about
[1:37:23] this building. It's about the
[1:37:24] brotherhood. It's about getting together
[1:37:27] with the body. And that's why the
[1:37:29] prophet said in the message shalom, he
[1:37:31] said, when more of the believers get
[1:37:33] together, it's more of the godhead
[1:37:36] bodily right among us.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; I'm asking you, what gives you that
[1:37:41] strength to force or propel beyond
[1:37:44] differences, beyond your feelings? It's
[1:37:46] the love of God. Amen.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; What was it when Noah did what he did?
[1:37:52] What was it that allowed the Lord Jesus
[1:37:54] even after the fall in Eden? What was it
[1:37:57] that brought him down? His love for his
[1:38:00] fallen creation.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; When Noah died a drunk,
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; the love of God did not stop there. I
[1:38:08] love how the brother Ram says in the
[1:38:10] message, Masterpiece, he said God was
[1:38:12] not about to let his creation lay there
[1:38:14] in ruins.
[1:38:16] He said he went to work to build a
[1:38:18] masterpiece.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; And when God built this great
[1:38:21] masterpiece of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:38:23] what would he be? He would be the word
[1:38:25] expressed. How does the word come
[1:38:27] through and by the prophets? It would be
[1:38:29] word on top of word on top of word on
[1:38:31] top of word. It would not just be some
[1:38:32] say thou Jeremiah. Some say you're
[1:38:34] Elijah. Some say this. He was the
[1:38:36] complete thought of God expressed the
[1:38:40] word.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; But he had to have the right pedestal.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:46] And God put that pedestal
[1:38:48] in such a way.
[1:38:52] Abraham,
[1:38:55] the election of God,
[1:38:57] Isaac, the love of God.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Then it would come to that of Jacob. And
[1:39:05] I love how Brother Bram calls it Jacob.
[1:39:10] You know what I love, brother Carlos? I
[1:39:11] love how God even on Mount Carmel, I
[1:39:16] don't know these little things like
[1:39:17] this, brother Aaron mean a lot to me.
[1:39:19] How that God within that he just he did
[1:39:21] not neglect Jacob and just say Israel.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; But God when he was assembling all that
[1:39:27] together
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; on Mount Carmel, you know why? He was
[1:39:30] recognizing there's still Jacob, but the
[1:39:33] Israel is what's inside of Jacob.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? And what is it that
[1:39:38] will bring deliverance? The fire of God.
[1:39:40] What is it that brings deliverance in
[1:39:42] your life? The fire of God, the Holy
[1:39:44] Spirit. What is it even today, right as
[1:39:46] you're sitting right here under the
[1:39:48] midst of maybe a hard trial? What is it
[1:39:50] that's giving you strength today? It's
[1:39:52] the fire of almighty God igniting that
[1:39:56] Israel inside of this Jacob
[1:39:58] [Music]
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; drives you on, encourages you,
[1:40:02] encourages you. You don't feel like
[1:40:04] coming my here you are. You find
[1:40:05] yourself putting your towel on if you
[1:40:07] were on one or whatever it was and you
[1:40:09] find yourself here you are sitting in
[1:40:10] the pew and you're thinking how in the
[1:40:11] world did I get here? What was it? I'm
[1:40:13] asking you what is it that moved you
[1:40:16] beyond your feelings.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what that is. That's a
[1:40:23] love of God.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; It's that same love if you can see it is
[1:40:27] the same love of God that would not
[1:40:28] allow him to stop with Noah. He kept on
[1:40:31] going and brother Brandon when he says
[1:40:32] Jacob he said everybody knows Jacob
[1:40:35] means grace. You just have to read a
[1:40:37] little bit of Jacob's life. It ain't
[1:40:39] nothing but the grace of God. Then he
[1:40:41] goes on he says now that fourth one on
[1:40:42] there was that of Joseph perfection. God
[1:40:46] notice it was the four pedestals. Four
[1:40:48] being that of life and how that he set
[1:40:50] his word upon what? Election, love,
[1:40:54] grace and perfection. Let me tell you,
[1:40:57] you are positioned in Christ in the
[1:41:00] elective love of almighty God. And it is
[1:41:03] grace that is swept down in your life.
[1:41:05] And it's grace that continues to work
[1:41:08] and give you strength.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Leading from that perfection of his own
[1:41:12] life
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; that leads you to perfection.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Every one of us, your children, your
[1:41:25] children disappointed you sometimes.
[1:41:28] Maybe your children or somebody, maybe a
[1:41:29] spouse or whatever.
[1:41:33] Well, there ain't no angels here,
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; but we've disappointed one another.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; I won't ask you to raise your hands,
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; but how many of you said things you had
[1:41:44] to go back and repent for?
[1:41:49] Lord, it's amazing we don't see hands
[1:41:50] flying up in the feet and flying up in
[1:41:51] the air.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; You know why? It's not an excuse.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; But what is it that would even drive you
[1:41:57] to that? What is it that would not even
[1:41:59] allow you for that to remain?
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Disagreements will come.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; What is it that won't allow you?
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; It wasn't because you were taught good
[1:42:09] in kindergarten.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Many times a lot of kids in school, tell
[1:42:13] them you're sorry. Sorry.
[1:42:15] It's
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; going to work real good on the plat on
[1:42:18] the playground next time, huh?
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah, right. Better keep one of them in.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Either that or you better be out there
[1:42:24] on duty cuz it that that ain't nothing
[1:42:26] genuine about that.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; That's good. That's good. That's good.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[1:42:40] It's reciprocal. that love working
[1:42:45] within the body.
[1:42:48] It's the love of God.
[1:42:51] It's the love of God from your heart
[1:42:55] that it would make you I I know listen
[1:42:57] friends things that God even as I've
[1:42:59] prayed I you know when I pray and I
[1:43:01] minister on this say God help me to
[1:43:03] understand it
[1:43:05] how you're revealing it right now
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; because I'm not these things. I'm not
[1:43:10] I'm gonna preach I'm not preaching by
[1:43:12] memory. The Holy Spirit will bring
[1:43:13] things back, quotes and things like that
[1:43:15] that I don't even have up here and and
[1:43:16] the way he'll bring things together.
[1:43:18] It's not by memory.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, there's even things
[1:43:22] the way God will pull pull things back
[1:43:23] by layers and I can look at it and I can
[1:43:26] honestly say, I never seen it like this
[1:43:28] before.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; And that's true.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; But it's God because you know why?
[1:43:35] The same God that is working in your
[1:43:37] life is the same God working in my life.
[1:43:41] So, it's not like, you know, in school
[1:43:43] where you got a teacher who's up here
[1:43:45] teaching and they're 35 years old and
[1:43:47] they're teaching nine year olds to, you
[1:43:48] know, do whatever they're supposed to
[1:43:50] do. Trying to remember now, algebra and
[1:43:52] different some beginning things. This
[1:43:54] person's already been through it. Right?
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; But to think about it, no wonder said no
[1:43:59] wonder Paul said through the foolishness
[1:44:00] of preaching,
[1:44:02] God would take men that are imperfect
[1:44:06] and God works in their lives and as he's
[1:44:09] bringing things even down into their
[1:44:10] lives and working in their hearts,
[1:44:12] there's things that God is opening and
[1:44:14] showing us and it's for the benefit.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; And it's not just about well me, but
[1:44:20] it's God working within each of our
[1:44:22] lives. And that's why I can come to the
[1:44:24] end or not really to the end but come to
[1:44:26] a stopping point here and say Lord bring
[1:44:28] me to that degree
[1:44:31] help me Lord Jesus
[1:44:34] because you know what there's things
[1:44:35] over time in our lives when Paul would
[1:44:39] write there's many other lot more
[1:44:41] scriptures I wanted to get into here
[1:44:42] tonight when Paul would say
[1:44:46] of how that we're to love one another
[1:44:48] charity out of a pure heart
[1:44:51] and yet The heart itself
[1:44:54] is grounds that must be kept
[1:44:58] because the heart itself remember Jesus
[1:45:00] would say if you don't from your heart
[1:45:04] forgive.
[1:45:06] It's kind of like taking a hose and you
[1:45:08] know I bought one of these hose I think
[1:45:11] it was last year if I'm right honey. You
[1:45:13] know I got tired of them big old rubber
[1:45:15] hoses. I had a good rubber hose there.
[1:45:16] But man, that thing pulling that out in
[1:45:18] the yard to water my trees. It was you
[1:45:20] just want to leave leave it there. But
[1:45:22] then you have dead marks in your grass
[1:45:23] if you leave it there. So I had the
[1:45:25] bright idea of one of these fabric ones,
[1:45:28] you know, that start out about this
[1:45:30] small and swell out.
[1:45:34] Let me tell you something. That thing
[1:45:36] didn't even last a year.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; And it end up with pin holes in it and
[1:45:42] everything else. I'd set out there at
[1:45:44] the end and you know how you do with a
[1:45:47] hose because you don't want to you're
[1:45:48] like I'm done walked out here already. I
[1:45:50] ain't going back up there and but you
[1:45:51] know what you why why why are you doing
[1:45:53] this even with your rubber hose? Why are
[1:45:55] you doing that? Cuz you know there's
[1:45:57] water.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; I've already turned on the water and I
[1:46:01] know there's water. So what you know
[1:46:03] between me and the water source that's
[1:46:06] where the problem's at. All right.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; And so sometimes when we look in our
[1:46:10] lives, it's constant, constant,
[1:46:12] constant, and say, "Lord, let my heart
[1:46:15] stay free as a channel."
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; If there's something that's, you know,
[1:46:18] it's just like a little trickle that's
[1:46:20] coming out. Listen, God wants to express
[1:46:23] his love through your life. So, he won't
[1:46:28] keep it from you, but he'll help you
[1:46:30] see. And God don't sit there and let me
[1:46:33] take him around this bin. Let me take
[1:46:35] him around. let me try to get the kink
[1:46:36] out. But you know what God will do?
[1:46:37] He'll walk right down in our life.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; And he'll say, "This is where it's
[1:46:42] kinkedked."
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; But when he does that,
[1:46:47] you know what the whole thing is? It
[1:46:49] loosens us.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Say amen to the word of God. And you
[1:46:53] know how it is when that when that hose
[1:46:54] that kink gets leaned out all of a
[1:46:56] sudden go
[1:46:59] the water starts coming out like that.
[1:47:01] And that's how after you set in the
[1:47:03] service like this and say, "Lord, be it
[1:47:05] unto me according to thy word." He
[1:47:06] begins to go down in your life and
[1:47:08] tomorrow it will be like maybe the next
[1:47:10] day and here's water coming out and then
[1:47:12] all of a sudden you be like a gush and
[1:47:13] then it goes what is it? There's it's
[1:47:15] getting that air out of the line.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; It don't mean that. It doesn't mean that
[1:47:19] oh nothing must have happened. No, no,
[1:47:21] things did happen.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; What it is he's pushing out
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; all of that
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; got between.
[1:47:30] Don't you love him?
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's pray. Lord Jesus,
[1:47:39] I just know Lord that Father,
[1:47:43] you are mindful of our needs,
[1:47:47] Lord, even to so speak to our hearts and
[1:47:52] help us.
[1:47:54] And I pray that God,
[1:47:57] Lord, if there's something that I've
[1:48:00] missed in some way tonight, maybe
[1:48:03] something that Lord that maybe an
[1:48:05] example here or there that may have
[1:48:06] helped someone, I I've got confidence,
[1:48:09] Lord, in you
[1:48:11] cuz I didn't even have any of these
[1:48:12] examples or nothing even wrote here in
[1:48:15] the few pages I've got through.
[1:48:18] But may you come, Lord. That's where my
[1:48:20] hands are up to you and this
[1:48:23] congregation,
[1:48:26] Lord Jesus.
[1:48:28] Make me more like you, Lord.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Lord God, we want our hearts to be
[1:48:36] clear,
[1:48:38] free channels, Lord, that are open,
[1:48:42] surrendered,
[1:48:44] submitted. Help us, Lord.
[1:48:47] May God by your spirit, Lord, just come
[1:48:50] down, Lord, and continue to deal and
[1:48:52] work in our lives,
[1:48:54] Lord. The sacrifices that's made
[1:48:56] tonight,
[1:48:57] my brothers and sisters, each one of us,
[1:48:59] Lord, we didn't come here to be seen.
[1:49:02] They've come, Lord, from working, their
[1:49:04] jobs, laboring, and coming into an
[1:49:06] evening service like this. They love
[1:49:09] you, Lord. They want to serve you, want
[1:49:11] to serve you better.
[1:49:14] I pray that Lord God
[1:49:16] help us Lord
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Lord give us the wisdom give us the
[1:49:22] strength Lord the grace
[1:49:25] even Lord in every area of our life help
[1:49:28] us Lord
[1:49:30] dear God as different places you took us
[1:49:32] tonight and bringing out things with
[1:49:34] marriage and other things Lord God help
[1:49:37] us Lord Jesus we're an imperfect people
[1:49:40] Lord
[1:49:43] We need you, Father.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; We need you. We need your grace and your
[1:49:48] strength, Lord. Help us, Lord.
[1:49:52] Lord God, like your prophet would
[1:49:54] describe that little boy trying to put
[1:49:56] on that coat. Many times, Lord, that's
[1:49:58] how we feel.
[1:50:00] [Music]
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Getting one arm in and then we're
[1:50:03] struggling to get our other arm in. But
[1:50:05] oh God,
[1:50:06] may we just take that hand
[1:50:09] and put it in your hand and say,
[1:50:12] "Father, you guide me into the sleeve."
[1:50:15] That's our heart's desire, Lord. You We
[1:50:17] don't want to It's not us to try to
[1:50:18] figure it out. We want to submit, Lord.
[1:50:21] We want to surrender. Help us,
[1:50:25] God. I pray if there's one here tonight
[1:50:27] that has not maybe even by under the
[1:50:30] sound of my voice going through
[1:50:31] streaming or archive Lord and they not
[1:50:34] come into that place Lord into the body
[1:50:36] to where that oh they they're around it
[1:50:38] they experience the love among the body
[1:50:41] and the saints reaching out to him Lord
[1:50:43] God and how that when they come around
[1:50:45] the greeting and so forth but yet Lord
[1:50:47] God to really know the love of God that
[1:50:50] loosens the grip of unbelief within
[1:50:52] their heart Lord God to wear Lord Jesus
[1:50:54] the attributes of sin just flee out of
[1:50:57] their life. Lord God, grant it. Lord,
[1:50:59] tonight I pray that you would lead them.
[1:51:01] May they Lord God have that of the
[1:51:03] courage to Lord Jesus under the presence
[1:51:06] of divine love to say, Lord God, take me
[1:51:09] there. Lead me there, Lord God. That's
[1:51:11] what I want in my life, Lord God. I just
[1:51:13] don't want to come into the house of God
[1:51:15] and sense the love of God. But I, Lord
[1:51:18] God, I want to be, Lord, a very product.
[1:51:21] I want to become love
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; to where the love of God
[1:51:25] It's on display in my life.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Once I was a sinner,
[1:51:32] but now I'm an express son of God.
[1:51:34] Beneath that darkness, I was always a
[1:51:36] son, but the darkness has broke.
[1:51:40] The day has dawned, the sun has rose,
[1:51:44] and sons and daughters of God are
[1:51:46] rising.
[1:51:48] Lord Jesus, thank you for your word.
[1:51:51] Thank you for your mercy, Lord. Father,
[1:51:54] I pray tonight, Lord.
[1:51:57] Thank you, Lord, for
[1:52:00] making it real plain to us.
[1:52:03] [Music]
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. We're thankful for
[1:52:07] the love of God in our hearts.
[1:52:10] As the prophet told us in many examples,
[1:52:11] the love of God would stand right up in
[1:52:14] our hearts and say, "Wait a minute.
[1:52:16] That's a person. That's one that I died
[1:52:18] for."
[1:52:20] Lord Jesus, how we're so thankful
[1:52:24] for the love of God.
[1:52:26] [Music]
[1:52:28] I'm not just thankful that you changed
[1:52:30] my nature,
[1:52:32] but I'm so thankful that you rise from
[1:52:36] within me
[1:52:38] and you won't let me get by with
[1:52:41] nothing.
[1:52:43] Correction comes to our lives. Lord God,
[1:52:46] I want to say thank you.
[1:52:50] Anybody else want to join me tonight and
[1:52:52] say thank you, Lord?
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for the Holy Spirit that
[1:52:55] convicts me, Lord.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; So thankful for the spirit of God
[1:52:59] that'll correct me.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Because Lord, like your prophet told us,
[1:53:03] when you discipline us, you do it with a
[1:53:06] vision in mind.
[1:53:09] You're bringing us back home.
[1:53:13] One of these days, one of these moments,
[1:53:16] cuz we're living in the harvest time,
[1:53:21] character
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; will be harvested
[1:53:25] from this earth and rapture.
[1:53:28] The great combines of God
[1:53:32] sweeping by to draw us up into his
[1:53:34] presence.
[1:53:36] Help us, Lord.
[1:53:39] Like your prophet said in another place,
[1:53:44] he said, "Lord, continue to work in our
[1:53:46] lives.
[1:53:47] Bake all the greenness out of us, Lord.
[1:53:51] Bring us, Lord, to the place until we
[1:53:54] become the bread on your table."
[1:53:57] Glory be to God.
[1:54:00] Not only Lord when we set that day at
[1:54:02] the marriage supper of the lamb
[1:54:06] and then as the fulfillment of you said
[1:54:09] I will not drink fruit of the vine until
[1:54:12] then
[1:54:13] and as we sat down there at the marriage
[1:54:15] supper of the lamb think about it
[1:54:19] even in memorial as we'll be partaking
[1:54:22] of the bread and of the wine
[1:54:25] and yet what will be setting there at
[1:54:28] the marriage supper of The lamb
[1:54:31] is the very bread of life
[1:54:35] himself
[1:54:37] that was given in order to bring life to
[1:54:40] us.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; No wonder Paul could liken us as a body.
[1:54:45] We are one bread, one bread, one body.
[1:54:50] Lord Jesus,
[1:54:52] help us, Lord.
[1:54:55] Help us, Lord God. Lord God, from
[1:54:59] marriages, Lord, every one of us, we
[1:55:01] need, Lord, your strength. Help us, oh
[1:55:03] God,
[1:55:04] brethren, Lord, ministries all the way
[1:55:07] through, Lord, help us
[1:55:10] not to make differences
[1:55:13] the focal point.
[1:55:18] Grant it, Lord.
[1:55:21] Grant it, Lord.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; Not even to give that a point of
[1:55:25] conversation.
[1:55:28] Because to talk about differences among
[1:55:31] brethren is not edification to the body.
