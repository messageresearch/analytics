[35:27] and all the stuff that you've been
[35:28] struggling with it's not going to Mean a
[35:30] Thing
[35:31] that stuff's not even worthy to be
[35:33] compared to the glory which shall be
[35:34] revealed in you
[35:36] so let's not worry about it this morning
[35:38] but let's just enter into the presence

[35:49] amen

[35:56] John 8.
[35:58] verse 31.
[36:02] John 8 31. boy whoever played the piano
[36:06] today we might have to take you to ER
[36:09] because your fingers must be on fire
[36:11] this morning
[36:13] see I'm I'm a little partial my mom when
[36:16] I was when I was raised and growing up
[36:17] and things like that my mom played piano
[36:19] all the time and things like that so
[36:20] I've been around piano musicians my
[36:22] entire life so when I hear that gospel I
[36:24] call it the Pentecostal bump and things
[36:26] like that when I hear the gospel runs
[36:28] and so forth it just brings shivers down
[36:30] my spine and I jumped out of my seat
[36:32] when I heard the music being played this
[36:34] morning amen amen God is good amen
[36:38] it's okay to be happy to be a Christian
[36:41] amen they can be happy in ball games we
[36:43] can be happy here amen glory to God
[36:46] all right let's read the scripture amen
[36:48] I just feel like going amen
[36:51] John 8 verse 31 John 8 verse 31.
[36:54] the scripture reads then said Jesus
[36:56] through those Jews which believed on him
[36:58] if you continue my word then are you my
[37:01] disciples indeed and you shall know the
[37:03] truth and the truth shall make you free
[37:06] they answered him we be Abraham's seed
[37:09] and we never in bondage to any man do
[37:11] you know that's how delusional they are
[37:13] they were in bondage to Rome at the time
[37:15] Rome owned them at the time remember
[37:17] they couldn't even crucify Jesus without
[37:19] Rome so see but they think oh we're free
[37:21] we're free let's see how sayest thou ye
[37:25] shall be made free they didn't know they
[37:27] were in bondage Jesus answered in verse
[37:29] 34 verily verily I say unto you
[37:31] whosoever committed sin is the servant
[37:33] of sin and the servant of the Bible
[37:34] That's not in the house forever but the
[37:36] son abideth ever if the son therefore
[37:38] shall make you free ye shall be free
[37:42] indeed
[37:44] if our heads were a prayer most gracious
[37:47] kind Heavenly Father Lord we have just
[37:48] gathered together under the mighty name
[37:50] of Jesus Christ Lord and we're so
[37:51] thankful of this morning Lord for your
[37:53] presence God we thank you Lord for
[37:56] meeting us Lord you promise you would be
[37:58] here when two or three are gathered you
[38:00] promise to be here Lord and so father
[38:03] God we just ask you dear Jesus this
[38:05] morning you would take this time and
[38:06] speak to our hearts oh God lord if it
[38:09] was just a man talking with a bunch of
[38:11] people listening it'd be no different
[38:13] than a college course a a normal speech
[38:16] but Lord if you'd show up Lord God when
[38:19] you come down it becomes the Church of
[38:22] the Living God and so Lord Jesus we're
[38:25] just asking you Lord to speak to our
[38:28] hearts Lord may we all step aside this
[38:30] morning Lord and be able to enter into
[38:32] your presence Lord where where things of
[38:35] Eternity can happen we're trusting you
[38:38] and believing we commit this service
[38:40] into your faithful hands in the name of
[38:42] thy son our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[38:43] the bride say together
[38:45] amen God bless you you may be seated
[38:49] amen you love the Lord
[38:51] amen God surely is good amen
[38:55] I'm going to preach a message called Let
[38:57] Freedom Ring
[38:58] Let Freedom Ring
[39:01] and I kind of like I told you I kind of
[39:03] switched my sermon so they may not have
[39:05] this quote ready yet because I gave it
[39:07] to him about 10 minutes ago so but I
[39:11] want to start with this little statement
[39:12] brother Bram said and it's kind of a oh
[39:14] they did I tell you what I I didn't
[39:16] doubt you for a second Brian amen
[39:19] and just so you know you're not seeing
[39:21] double okay I'm Steven and that's Brian
[39:24] back there
[39:25] his mama told me last time I was here
[39:28] said boy you look awful lot like my son
[39:31] I said I'll take it as a compliment amen
[39:34] watch what brother bam said here in
[39:36] Smyrna Church age he said now comes our
[39:38] triumphal Capstone on the baptism with
[39:40] the Holy Ghost now this this quote is
[39:43] very common but it's very Bedrock to the
[39:45] message because what is a Capstone a
[39:47] Capstone is something that unifies amen
[39:49] when you when you have a pyramid you're
[39:51] going up you need the Capstone in order
[39:53] to bring it all together without the
[39:55] Capstone you would still be piecing it
[39:57] together but when you bring the Capstone
[39:59] now you come up to the the full
[40:01] revelation of it amen and so thank God
[40:04] that God LED brother by him to say this
[40:06] for us because now we have what the
[40:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost does for us
[40:11] see it's so important to understand when
[40:13] you say I got the baptism of the Holy
[40:15] Ghost I mean that's great in yahata but
[40:17] what did it do to you see it's very
[40:20] important to understand what happened to
[40:21] you when you received the baptism of the
[40:24] Holy Ghost amen and because then it
[40:27] makes life so much easier you think did
[40:29] I just receive the Holy Ghost just to do
[40:31] good things on this side did I just
[40:33] receive the Holy Ghost to be nicer to be
[40:36] kinder and so forth like that what did
[40:38] the Holy Ghost do to me amen so he goes
[40:42] now comes our triumphal Capstone on the
[40:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost and he quotes
[40:46] Galatians 4 4-7 amen see it was already
[40:51] in the Bible amen Galatians 4 4 7. watch
[40:54] we're going to read it here real quick
[40:56] uh but when the fullness of time has
[40:58] come God sent forth his son made of a
[41:00] woman made under the law to redeem them
[41:02] that were under the law that we might
[41:04] receive the adoption of sons not Sons
[41:06] but adoption of sons amen and because
[41:09] you are Sons God sent forth the spirit
[41:11] of his son into your heart's crying Abba
[41:13] Father wherefore Thou Art no more
[41:15] servant but a son and of ascendant an
[41:18] heir of God through Christ remember you
[41:21] can't be an heir without inheritance
[41:23] amen if you are a son that means there's
[41:25] something you get then from it amen Oh
[41:28] Glory to God hallelujah sometimes we
[41:30] live under privileges
[41:32] this is what we're going to be talking
[41:34] about Let Freedom Ring sometimes we live
[41:36] under what we can actually gain from God
[41:39] listen you're not a son to be useless
[41:43] you know what I mean you're a son with
[41:46] inheritance that means you have rights
[41:48] amen
[41:50] glory to God in Hallelujah you know the
[41:53] president of the United States he has
[41:54] children and they get to fly Air Force
[41:56] One don't they I don't get to fly Air
[41:58] Force One
[42:00] it might be nice you know what I mean
[42:02] probably a nice plane in there it'd be
[42:04] kind of fun to ride that play but I
[42:06] can't why do that I didn't vote for
[42:08] those kids
[42:08] but see by association of the president
[42:12] being their father they get certain
[42:14] benefits they get certain rights and if
[42:17] God's your father
[42:18] that means you have certain benefits too
[42:21] [Applause]
[42:24] that's it listen it doesn't matter what
[42:26] you do you can't change that fact I got
[42:28] four daughters over there no matter how
[42:30] hard they try they will always be my
[42:32] child
[42:35] hold glory to God in Hallelujah
[42:38] no matter how hard you try sometimes to
[42:40] run if you were a Son of God God's Gonna
[42:43] Get You Still
[42:48] it is okay to lean on your free
[42:52] destination
[42:53] [Applause]
[42:55] now I know some people treat
[42:57] predestination like a rocking chair
[42:59] where they can do whatever they want let
[43:00] them do that you don't have to be like
[43:02] that
[43:02] but you're allowed to rely on it you're
[43:06] allowed to rely on being a son of God
[43:09] I mean think about it if God if you
[43:11] weren't supposed to do nothing with
[43:12] predestination why did God tell you
[43:13] about it to begin with
[43:15] God told you so it do something for you
[43:18] why you were always his son amen
[43:21] [Applause]
[43:24] glory to God who Hallelujah
[43:30] watch what brother bam says about
[43:31] Galatians 4 to 4-7 he says there it is
[43:35] Jesus Christ came forth died upon the
[43:38] cross and accomplished Redemption
[43:40] restoring the original owner by means of
[43:43] purchase or paying the price and thereby
[43:46] placed us as Sons
[43:48] that's in caps for some reason
[43:51] Amen brother bran put down caps you know
[43:53] why it's important for you to understand
[43:54] what the Holy Ghost did to you
[43:58] he placed us as Sons he did not make us
[44:02] Sons
[44:03] for we were already his sons and thereby
[44:07] to be placed as Sons
[44:09] Oh Glory to God do you understand see
[44:13] sometimes we think the Holy Ghost only
[44:14] started when you received him do you
[44:17] know the Holy Ghost has always been
[44:18] working in your life
[44:19] they that are led by the spirit of God
[44:22] are the sons of God
[44:24] when did God start leading you before
[44:26] you even knew it amen
[44:31] so think about like this if God was
[44:33] worried about your van and leading you
[44:35] then what makes you think God can't take
[44:37] you all the way now
[44:41] you can't even come to Christ without
[44:43] the Holy Ghost
[44:45] you could have even been led to where
[44:47] you at now without him doing all the
[44:50] leading
[44:51] and if he did it then he can do it
[44:53] tomorrow too
[44:54] [Applause]
[44:56] see why it's so important to understand
[44:58] what the Holy Ghost did to you
[45:01] it did not make you a son
[45:03] you were already a son but now you know
[45:08] you're a son
[45:11] and that's the difference
[45:13] brother Graham said in Christ the
[45:14] mystery God he said what is the baptism
[45:17] of the Holy Ghost he said it's the
[45:19] personal revelation of Jesus Christ to
[45:21] you
[45:22] okay
[45:23] it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[45:25] personally to you not Jesus Christ
[45:29] but Jesus Christ
[45:31] [Applause]
[45:34] it was already here
[45:36] amen even the mystery was depend from
[45:38] Generations from past things but now as
[45:41] May manifest unto the Saints which is
[45:43] Christ in you the hope of glory
[45:47] see Christ has always been in you but
[45:50] what did the Holy Ghost come to do it
[45:52] didn't come to you to make you a son it
[45:54] came to free you as a son
[45:58] [Applause]
[45:59] so now you can be free amen from the
[46:03] bondage of Sin from the bondages of this
[46:06] world
[46:07] glory to God and Hallelujah see you can
[46:10] be free from depression amen you can be
[46:13] free from anxiety and I'm gonna tell you
[46:16] something the world's handing it out in
[46:17] truckloads
[46:20] amen but we're the Church of the Living
[46:22] God when we receive the Holy Ghost we
[46:24] are sons of God
[46:29] glory to God
[46:32] see see this is what I mean when I say
[46:34] we live under privileges
[46:36] amen you're free that's what the Holy
[46:39] Ghost actually came to do it didn't come
[46:42] to bring more bondage we're going to
[46:43] read that scripture in a second it
[46:45] didn't come to make your life worse
[46:48] let me just give you something real
[46:50] quick maybe for the young people and
[46:51] stuff like that okay don't ever ever be
[46:54] jealous of what this world has
[46:57] right the only thing the world can give
[46:59] you is death
[47:01] it's the only thing to have
[47:03] look at their hot they got more
[47:05] hospitals than they ever have more
[47:07] medical stuff and yet we're dying more
[47:09] people are dying from mental things now
[47:12] I mean they can't the only thing the
[47:14] world can give is death
[47:16] it's the only thing you can give
[47:18] us hey man don't ever be jealous of what
[47:20] they got it's death it's useless it's
[47:22] not even that great
[47:24] it really ain't
[47:25] right hey man it's not that great out
[47:28] there
[47:29] listen sin might be great for a season
[47:32] but sin comes with consequences
[47:35] your body was not made to sin I know I
[47:37] know your body was constructed in shape
[47:40] and iniquity but God never made for sin
[47:42] to be in your body why it death Works in
[47:44] it God is not a god of the Dead He's a
[47:47] god of the living
[47:49] you remembered that so the reason why
[47:52] your body dies is because of sin all sin
[47:54] is is death amen so see all that stuff
[47:58] out there don't ever be jealous of it
[48:00] hey man it won't do you any good
[48:03] flee from it and run from it as if your
[48:06] life depends on it
[48:09] well that was free amen
[48:13] he placed us as Sons he did not make us
[48:16] Sons for we were already his sons but he
[48:18] placed us as Sons for as long as we were
[48:21] in the world in the flesh we could not
[48:23] be recognized as Sons see that's what's
[48:26] actually important for you to have
[48:29] is for you to know you're a Son of God
[48:31] see God already knew
[48:33] Gary knew you were a son but now with
[48:35] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can
[48:37] find out yes I am a son right
[48:41] right do you know how much of a sudden
[48:42] you are amen you know how much of a Son
[48:45] of God you are you're just as sinless as
[48:47] he is
[48:49] I tell you what sometimes when I say
[48:51] that people people just have a hard time
[48:53] in their mind about it hey man do you
[48:54] know why you do it's because you look at
[48:56] this as the sun right
[48:58] is not the sun we're changing this
[49:02] amen when we get a body change
[49:04] we get rid of this
[49:07] so of course we don't look at this then
[49:09] this is going to get changed I'm not
[49:12] this I'm this
[49:14] what do you identify as
[49:20] see that's what God did God was freeing
[49:23] you from yourself
[49:29] Oh Glory to God
[49:32] brother bam said who's my worst hand to
[49:34] me myself yeah so God even took care of
[49:37] that too glory to God and Hallelujah
[49:40] [Applause]
[49:42] it's an unconditional Covenant
[49:46] it's an unconditional Covenant when God
[49:49] came to Abraham to make a promise to him
[49:52] that he was going to have a son right he
[49:54] split the animals he told him split the
[49:56] animals and so forth Abraham knew what
[49:58] he was doing remember brother Branham
[49:59] taught us it was a custom
[50:01] that you would split the animals and you
[50:02] both Warriors would walk through and
[50:04] then that was symbolizing if we broke
[50:06] this Covenant then we become like one of
[50:08] these animals then so Abraham knew what
[50:11] he was doing Abraham knew about God was
[50:13] doing and so he split the animals kept
[50:15] the buzzards off and so forth and it was
[50:17] about time for him to walk through
[50:19] and all of a sudden God put a deep sleep
[50:21] on him
[50:22] and he saw the burning light we know
[50:24] what it was it was the pillar of fire
[50:25] the same pillow fire we have a picture
[50:27] of don't you dare let these critics out
[50:29] here make you think anything else
[50:33] the reason why that picture in 1950 with
[50:36] the pillow fire is so profound was not
[50:38] just because it was a supernatural
[50:40] picture that they can't prove why the
[50:41] light was there but it's more than that
[50:44] it was scripture Made Alive in our day
[50:49] it was the Scripture it was the same
[50:51] Pillar of Fire that struck Paul now
[50:54] it was the same thing amen the same
[50:57] Pillar of Fire that led the children of
[50:59] Israel
[51:01] that's why it's important
[51:05] it was the same Pillar of Fire that
[51:08] Abraham saw that night
[51:12] and a deep sleep fell on Abraham and the
[51:15] pillar of fire started walking through
[51:16] what did he say he said I have made thee
[51:20] a father of Mighty Nations
[51:23] God wanted Abraham so secure that he
[51:27] took Abraham out of the picture
[51:32] said he said Abraham I want you to make
[51:34] it so bad get out of my way I'm going to
[51:36] do it
[51:38] you see God did the same thing for you
[51:44] you said brother Stephen I really wish I
[51:46] could read that I'm so glad you asked
[51:48] it's actually in Romans 4.
[51:51] it's in Romans 4. listen I told you it's
[51:53] going to be an audible service today

[52:08] all right Romans 4 verse 16. watch this
[52:10] here Romans 4 16. thereof it is the
[52:13] faith that it might be by grace to the
[52:15] the to the end the promise might be sure
[52:17] to all the seed
[52:19] not to that only which is of the law but
[52:21] to that which is also the faith of
[52:22] Abraham who's the father of us all and
[52:24] it is written I have made thee a father
[52:26] of many nations that's what he went
[52:28] through right that was the promise he
[52:30] made it's an unconditional promise okay
[52:32] no so let's keep reading before him whom

[55:39] nations amen according to that which was
[55:42] spoken so that's our seed be and be not
[55:45] weak in faith he considered not his own
[55:48] body now dad remember this is the father
[55:50] of Faith he's our father

[55:56] amen who considered not his own body now
[56:00] dead when he was about 100 years old
[56:01] neither the Genesis Arizona he staggered
[56:03] not at the promise of God through
[56:05] unbelief but was strong in faith giving
[56:07] glory to God
[56:09] brother Stephen what should I do when I
[56:11] believe so I praising him about it did
[56:12] he do it or not
[56:15] you see what I'm saying uh everyone
[56:17] wants to sometimes well I know you won't
[56:19] raise your hand so I'm not going to ask
[56:21] you to do it
[56:22] but sometimes we blame god without
[56:24] thinking we are
[56:26] sometimes we blame ourselves true we
[56:29] blame everything else but it only comes
[56:31] down to Faith you're telling me think
[56:33] about like this
[56:35] you know sometimes we put so much stock
[56:36] into what the devil can do
[56:39] God's stronger than devil and I know
[56:41] that sounds simple you're like of course
[56:43] you act like that then
[56:45] you know what I mean God's on your side
[56:47] God's your ally God's your friend
[56:51] God's the boss
[56:54] amen God can do it all he never can't
[56:56] just do anything he wants he has to ask
[56:58] God first
[57:00] amen give too much credit to the devil
[57:02] sometimes
[57:04] amen do you believe it or not
[57:07] giving Glory he says strong in faith
[57:10] giving glory to God
[57:12] what should I do then Stephen if I
[57:14] really believe it well praise him about
[57:15] it
[57:17] spend some time worshiping tell people
[57:19] we know the story of that brother who
[57:21] was blind and went through the prayer
[57:23] line and got prayed over then he ended
[57:24] up in the prayer line and he said I
[57:26] still blind his motorcycle
[57:36] still blind being prayed for to not be
[57:39] blind anymore
[57:40] he said he's what did that man say I'm
[57:42] still blind
[57:44] and brother bear said I thought you
[57:46] believed me
[57:47] what was the actual issue faith
[57:51] was it even the blindness the issue was
[57:53] the faith and what did the man said he
[57:55] said I do believe you but what do I do
[57:57] that
[57:58] he said go tell people about it then
[58:01] did it happen or not
[58:03] amen and he did it for two weeks you
[58:06] know we're reading the end of the story
[58:08] could you imagine being him in the
[58:09] middle of week one
[58:11] blind as a bat going glory to God good
[58:15] news remember he was a paper boy right
[58:16] here's the paper I can see
[58:22] that's supposed to be an example of how
[58:25] we ought to act
[58:29] you say brother Stephen I don't know if
[58:30] I'm allowed Let Freedom Ring you were
[58:32] free from sin and shame to be able to do
[58:36] that
[58:37] [Applause]
[58:41] glory to God
[58:45] verse 20 stagger not of the promise of
[58:47] God through unbelief but was strong in
[58:49] faith giving glory to God
[58:51] and being fully persuaded that what he
[58:54] had promised he was also able to perform
[58:57] [Applause]
[58:59] I think it's time for us to get a little
[59:01] more convinced than we were yesterday
[59:03] get convinced of God
[59:06] I think I said this last time I was here
[59:08] amen you know God can still talk God can
[59:11] still speak to you if you are really not
[59:13] convinced that getting his presence and
[59:15] go find out whether God could do it or
[59:17] not
[59:19] amen
[59:21] God is greater you know the Bible says
[59:23] he can do exceedingly abundantly above
[59:25] all you can possibly ask or think
[59:28] so anything you could ever come up with
[59:30] that would be the best thing for you God
[59:32] is still better than that
[59:38] I'm saying this so God can do it for you
[59:40] too
[59:41] amen the issue is not the promise the
[59:44] issue's not God the issue is right here
[59:46] what do you believe
[59:48] remember when he cursed the fig tree
[59:50] and the disciples came to look how fast
[59:52] his fig tree was cursed what did Jesus
[59:54] say he said have faith in God for you
[59:57] could say to the mountain be thou
[59:59] removed
[1:00:01] and no doubt in your heart but
[1:00:02] believable you have asked for and you
[1:00:04] shall receive what you've asked for

[1:00:15] means without exception
[1:00:20] oh I don't know what's going on today
[1:00:22] but I feel like just hitting that some
[1:00:24] more amen
[1:00:25] you know brother Brandon even struggled
[1:00:26] about that scripture
[1:00:28] say to the mountain
[1:00:29] he even struggled with it he was asking
[1:00:32] God about that scripture it's Mark 11.
[1:00:34] he was asking God and God brought the
[1:00:37] interpretation to him
[1:00:39] and he was inspired and what did God say
[1:00:42] your squirrel hunting aren't you
[1:00:45] he met God met him where he was at
[1:00:49] said you're squirrel hunting aren't you
[1:00:50] it's like yeah I am how many squirrels
[1:00:52] are going to be this is the
[1:00:54] interpretation of Mark Levin

[1:00:59] going to be three okay that's great
[1:01:01] they're gonna be three
[1:01:02] okay where are they

[1:01:07] him didn't he amen and we know the story
[1:01:10] right he found the three School membrane
[1:01:11] remember he only made two and he thought
[1:01:13] that was good enough
[1:01:14] and he started walking away and got him

[1:01:17] you said three
[1:01:18] [Laughter]

[1:01:26] Branham
[1:01:27] you know this is this message was given
[1:01:29] to us for us to learn by an example
[1:01:32] do you know why that was so important
[1:01:34] for God to show up to brother Brandon
[1:01:35] like that for you
[1:01:39] that he is going to tell you what does
[1:01:40] Mark 11 mean
[1:01:42] amen ask what you will that your joy may
[1:01:46] be filled

[1:01:51] point amen you don't have to sit here
[1:01:53] and beg and hope and plead it is your
[1:01:56] right the Jesus said the kingdom of God
[1:01:58] suffered the violent and the violent
[1:02:00] take it by force
[1:02:02] why are you still sitting there it's
[1:02:04] your promise rise up and take it amen
[1:02:08] [Applause]
[1:02:11] I tell you what sometimes we spend so
[1:02:14] much time depressed about things
[1:02:16] we spent so much time about this stuff
[1:02:18] sometimes and I'm not saying it ain't
[1:02:20] real but do you realize depression and
[1:02:22] worry makes no sense for you to have
[1:02:25] I mean when you think logically if God's
[1:02:29] really in control of everything
[1:02:31] and God is your ally and your friend
[1:02:34] and he's taking care of everything what
[1:02:36] is
[1:02:39] the Bible is just perfect love cast out
[1:02:41] fear
[1:02:42] of course it's real of course worrying
[1:02:44] and depression is real I'm not saying it
[1:02:46] ain't real but also makes no sense why
[1:02:47] we do it
[1:02:49] right if you just think about it for a
[1:02:50] second
[1:02:51] and go wait a minute I'm a son of God
[1:02:54] what is there for me to fear
[1:02:56] I win
[1:02:58] you know what I mean we we win
[1:03:02] we're not on the losing side what does
[1:03:04] the Bible say the Bible says we are more
[1:03:06] than conquerors through Christ
[1:03:10] how are you more than a conqueror you
[1:03:12] look at the old stories of Wars you know
[1:03:14] you look at Napoleon Bonaparte and so
[1:03:16] forth and these these people who went to
[1:03:18] war Alexander the Great and so for like
[1:03:20] that when they would go to war they
[1:03:21] would go to that fight not knowing who
[1:03:24] would win
[1:03:25] oh sure they could have confidence in
[1:03:27] themselves and in their skills and in
[1:03:29] their armies but they didn't have an
[1:03:31] assurity
[1:03:33] but you're more than a conqueror
[1:03:36] why when you go to war you have
[1:03:39] assurance
[1:03:41] you have assurance that you win
[1:03:44] and that's why you're more than a
[1:03:46] conqueror right now
[1:03:51] why you've been freed to do it
[1:03:54] now we read a lot of this about Abraham
[1:03:56] here right and that sounds great for
[1:03:58] Abraham don't it
[1:04:00] but watch what Paul says here and I like
[1:04:03] we'll go back to verse 21 and being
[1:04:05] fully persuaded that what he had
[1:04:07] promised he was able also to perform and
[1:04:10] therefore it was imputed to him for
[1:04:12] righteousness now it was not written for
[1:04:14] his sake alone huh
[1:04:17] it wasn't just written for Abraham all
[1:04:21] that stuff that happened to Abraham
[1:04:22] wasn't just for him
[1:04:24] so it was for somebody else
[1:04:27] well I wonder who it was then who else
[1:04:29] was this for
[1:04:30] but if for uh
[1:04:32] now to him that it was written for his
[1:04:34] sake alone that it was imputed to him
[1:04:36] but for us also
[1:04:39] wait a minute Abraham went through all
[1:04:42] that stuff of an unconditional Covenant
[1:04:44] so forth for you
[1:04:46] why so you would understand
[1:04:49] that you have the same thing
[1:04:55] you have an unconditional Covenant with
[1:04:57] God
[1:05:00] you want unconditional means
[1:05:02] I know it sounds so simple I know you
[1:05:04] know what it means but when you're
[1:05:06] walking in your life why is it the first
[1:05:08] thing you forget
[1:05:10] unconditional means without conditions
[1:05:12] it means it happened you know you look
[1:05:15] you look at when God went to Adam he
[1:05:17] said if you don't eat off that tree when
[1:05:19] you went to Noah it was that if if
[1:05:22] all these other characters but when he
[1:05:24] went to Abraham he didn't say if he said
[1:05:28] I have
[1:05:33] you know Abraham
[1:05:35] Abraham wasn't necessarily doing
[1:05:37] everything right all the time now
[1:05:42] you remember uh one time
[1:05:45] he uh remember he saw the fires hit
[1:05:48] Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:05:50] remember he even pleaded for the people
[1:05:51] didn't he yes Lord if there be ten
[1:05:55] we found out there wasn't even 10 in
[1:05:57] that City
[1:06:00] there's really only one
[1:06:01] and you know God had enough thought for
[1:06:03] that one still isn't that oh I tell you
[1:06:05] what the mercy of God sometimes
[1:06:07] lot gets a bad rap sometimes
[1:06:10] you'll remember this when you're dealing
[1:06:11] with people out in the world okay
[1:06:13] because it's easy for us message folks
[1:06:15] listen I live around you quite a while
[1:06:17] okay it's easy for message folk to get a
[1:06:19] little high mind into their mind when
[1:06:21] you're looking at other people out here
[1:06:23] you look at a lot what did Brother Rams
[1:06:24] say about lot he said he was his
[1:06:26] denominational brother
[1:06:30] can you call somebody your
[1:06:32] denominational brother
[1:06:34] and God had enough thought of him to at
[1:06:36] least get him out of Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:06:39] Peter called him righteous and just
[1:06:42] oh is that something
[1:06:44] now remember he was Abraham was he
[1:06:46] Abraham was a silver dollar lot was a
[1:06:49] penny
[1:06:50] but God still had enough Grace for that
[1:06:52] penny
[1:06:53] aren't you thankful for that
[1:06:58] [Applause]
[1:07:02] I'd be able to see you know they might
[1:07:03] believe in three gods and so forth like
[1:07:05] that but they're following how much they
[1:07:07] got brother said leave them alone you
[1:07:09] don't know they might be a penny all
[1:07:12] right
[1:07:13] amen amen
[1:07:15] I think we get we get a little uh
[1:07:18] spoiled sometimes
[1:07:20] you look at brother bran when he
[1:07:22] preached how many messages do you preach
[1:07:23] in
[1:07:24] two
[1:07:26] I mean Jeffersonville maybe Arizona
[1:07:28] maybe a pair of green and that's about
[1:07:30] it
[1:07:32] you want to mean and yet you look at how
[1:07:35] he acted towards people that's how I
[1:07:37] want to act
[1:07:38] [Applause]
[1:07:40] you know what I mean yes
[1:07:42] yes we get sometimes we get too messy oh
[1:07:44] well gee I'll tell you what I'm might
[1:07:47] get in trouble this morning hope Sam
[1:07:52] I hope you can feel what I'm saying yeah
[1:07:55] is that sometimes we get so message you
[1:07:57] we forget about other people
[1:07:59] you know you know it's only by the grace
[1:08:02] of God you even had a chance to hear
[1:08:03] this right
[1:08:05] right so what about them how are they
[1:08:07] going to hear about it then
[1:08:09] don't don't forget amen about those lost
[1:08:12] souls out there that's the most
[1:08:15] important part amen and that was free
[1:08:17] this morning but we're just I don't I
[1:08:20] don't want listen sometimes we get so
[1:08:22] we we forget about other people out
[1:08:24] there why are you here for
[1:08:27] all right you know what I mean what are
[1:08:28] you here for are you here just to warm
[1:08:30] up you
[1:08:31] you know what I mean what does it mean
[1:08:32] when we say we work for God
[1:08:34] if you love God and you're working for
[1:08:36] him what does that look like what do you
[1:08:38] do
[1:08:39] well what is the what did uh John say
[1:08:41] when you love God's children you love
[1:08:44] him
[1:08:46] amen so when you help God's children
[1:08:48] you're actually helping God
[1:08:51] amen the Bible calls us co-laborers with
[1:08:53] him you can actually help God by helping
[1:08:56] somebody else know more about him then
[1:08:58] don't ever be ashamed of the message
[1:09:00] that we have
[1:09:01] don't ever be ashamed don't ever let the
[1:09:03] world make you feel bad about what you
[1:09:05] believe
[1:09:06] all right amen they're dying out there
[1:09:08] and you might have the words of life to
[1:09:11] save them don't ever be ashamed don't
[1:09:13] ever be scared to pipe up
[1:09:17] can I give you a little advice I hope
[1:09:19] you don't mind this okay when you
[1:09:21] witness to somebody you're not going to
[1:09:23] send them to Second hell
[1:09:25] amen they're already on the wrong road
[1:09:29] if they ain't saved by Jesus Christ
[1:09:31] they're already on their way to hell
[1:09:34] so how can you how can you shame them
[1:09:37] more into more hell
[1:09:39] you see what I'm saying you can take the
[1:09:42] truth you have eternal life in your hand
[1:09:45] and you can hand it to somebody else
[1:09:48] what did Peter say when he went to gay
[1:09:50] beautiful and saw that lame man he said
[1:09:52] such as I have I give
[1:09:56] make sure you got it first now
[1:09:59] but when you got it start using it
[1:10:04] amen Amen Let Freedom Ring
[1:10:07] amen give them the chance to be free too
[1:10:12] see this Freedom was not written just
[1:10:14] for Abraham this unconditional Covenant
[1:10:17] wasn't just written for Abraham it was
[1:10:19] for your sake as well for you to know
[1:10:22] that there's no conditions on this
[1:10:24] Covenant that you have with God Amen
[1:10:26] you're gonna make it when you trust and
[1:10:29] believe on him then of course you're
[1:10:31] going to make it God can't fail
[1:10:35] but when you start leaning on yourself
[1:10:37] and looking at yourself you go there
[1:10:39] ain't no chance for me to make it and
[1:10:41] it's like well of course there's no
[1:10:43] chance for you to make it you're trying
[1:10:44] to do it
[1:10:46] but when you lean on him
[1:10:48] lead not to thy own understanding when
[1:10:51] you lean on him
[1:10:52] stop living on this and leaning on this
[1:10:55] how can you miss it that

[1:11:47] mess amen
[1:11:50] and then you have to explode sometimes

[1:12:21] become the sons of God even to them that
[1:12:23] believe on his name which were born not
[1:12:25] of blood nor the will of the flesh nor
[1:12:27] the will the man but of God Amen go back
[1:12:30] to that verse 12 sister that verse 12
[1:12:32] there watch this he that is or to them
[1:12:35] gave you power to become the sons of God
[1:12:37] that can be hard to understand based
[1:12:39] upon what we just said this morning that
[1:12:41] you weren't you didn't become a son when
[1:12:44] you received the Holy Ghost you were
[1:12:45] freed
[1:12:46] okay but that word power up there is a
[1:12:50] little different Greek word Greek
[1:12:51] actually has multiple words for power
[1:12:53] amen one of them is dunamis
[1:12:56] and what that means is literally a force
[1:12:59] amen it's a uh you know the nine
[1:13:01] spiritual gifts one of them is the
[1:13:02] worker of Miracles that were Miracles is
[1:13:05] dunamis power it's a force so it does
[1:13:09] something amen amen but that word power

[1:13:16] and what does that word exocia mean it
[1:13:19] means freedom

[1:13:38] Commandments I got the quote just so you
[1:13:40] know okay but I'm just I would go in
[1:13:42] that movie he quotes it right God made
[1:13:44] man but man-made slaves okay the world
[1:13:47] has been nothing but controlled by
[1:13:49] Slaves by Emperors by rulers until this
[1:13:52] last day
[1:13:54] when a bunch of pilgrims showed up in
[1:13:57] America and created a constitution for
[1:14:00] freedom
[1:14:01] for life liberty and the pursuit of
[1:14:03] happiness and it just showed up in this
[1:14:05] last days
[1:14:07] why did this country just show up last
[1:14:08] day and its main listen I know it ain't
[1:14:10] the same as it was then
[1:14:13] but it was built upon that idea of
[1:14:16] freedom
[1:14:17] amen of Freedom man living in Freedom
[1:14:21] why in the last day God was going to
[1:14:24] send a message and he brought it out of
[1:14:26] that same country and what message did
[1:14:29] he bring freedom
[1:14:31] you're not bound anymore
[1:14:34] but God gave you the freedom to be a Son
[1:14:38] of God God Gave You Liberty to be a son
[1:14:42] of God
[1:14:44] amen you can't quit putting chains on
[1:14:47] you you know what I mean I know
[1:14:48] sometimes we we like to blame the devil
[1:14:50] and everything else but sometimes it's
[1:14:52] our fault why we put the chains on our
[1:14:54] neck
[1:14:56] hey man sometimes it's your fault why
[1:14:59] you're bondage you if you would just
[1:15:01] drop the chains
[1:15:04] you see brother Stephen though you don't
[1:15:06] know the sins I did I don't even need to
[1:15:07] know
[1:15:08] do you believe there's only one sin
[1:15:10] unbelief
[1:15:12] your sins ain't stronger than God
[1:15:16] who glory to God in Hallelujah your sins
[1:15:20] ain't that strong God's still stronger
[1:15:22] [Applause]
[1:15:25] quit throwing yourself in the jailhouse
[1:15:26] you know what I mean quit throwing
[1:15:28] yourself in prison
[1:15:30] sometimes you get yourself in prison you
[1:15:31] fall asleep like Peter did one day
[1:15:33] Peter ended up in jail and he fell
[1:15:36] asleep in jail Paul I tell you what we
[1:15:39] gotta stop falling asleep in jail
[1:15:41] you know why an angel showed up
[1:15:45] but Peter didn't see the angel
[1:15:47] why he was sleeping
[1:15:49] why aren't you glad for the grace of God
[1:15:52] [Applause]
[1:15:53] because even when you fall asleep in
[1:15:55] jail do you know what God's gonna do
[1:15:57] he's gonna send you an angel
[1:15:59] you don't even know it's happening Peter
[1:16:01] didn't know the angel was there until
[1:16:03] what the angel had him in the face
[1:16:06] smoked him and said get up Peter you
[1:16:10] ain't supposed to be in jail glory to
[1:16:12] God Amen you ain't supposed to be in
[1:16:14] jail either
[1:16:17] you start falling asleep in all your
[1:16:19] depression and anxiety and so forth
[1:16:21] God's gonna send an angel maybe God sent
[1:16:23] this Angel this morning Amen to smooth
[1:16:26] you on the cheek and say get up you're
[1:16:29] free in the blood of Jesus
[1:16:35] [Music]
[1:16:38] he gave you freedom to be a Son of God
[1:16:41] stand up and act like it then
[1:16:46] oh
[1:16:48] you love the Lord
[1:16:52] Let Freedom Ring
[1:16:54] you know what that means it's actually
[1:16:55] kind of interesting I don't know if you
[1:16:57] know this that phrase comes from a song
[1:17:00] um America the Beautiful I believe or or
[1:17:02] My Country Tis of the sweet land of
[1:17:04] liberty and so forth like that that
[1:17:06] freedom Reign Martin Luther later quotes
[1:17:08] it in this I Have a Dream speech
[1:17:11] and I like the there was a little
[1:17:13] commentary on it and I really liked how
[1:17:14] it's seti here what does that what
[1:17:16] Freedom Ring means
[1:17:18] and it says the phrase in using the
[1:17:20] meaning of the verb to ring
[1:17:22] to make or cause to make clear a
[1:17:24] vibrating sound metaphorically Freedom
[1:17:28] itself is not a sound
[1:17:31] but letting Freedom Marine means to
[1:17:32] exercise your freedom clearly and openly
[1:17:36] in this case by sending you for just
[1:17:38] cause in a non-violent way
[1:17:40] see when I say Let Freedom Ring
[1:17:43] it is not good enough for you to go oh
[1:17:45] I'm so glad to know I'm free
[1:17:48] and just let it sit in your lap
[1:17:50] if you want to be free
[1:17:53] then you got to stand up and accept it
[1:17:57] as a fact in your life
[1:18:00] no matter the circumstances
[1:18:04] said he said he said God has made you a
[1:18:07] master of all circumstances
[1:18:11] you say brother Stephen uh I got a lot
[1:18:14] of circumstances oh how do I master it's
[1:18:16] not that you control the circumstances
[1:18:18] that makes you a master it's that the
[1:18:22] circumstances can't do anything to you
[1:18:24] about what you believe
[1:18:27] [Applause]
[1:18:28] that no matter what the circumstances no
[1:18:31] matter what the situation amen I'm gonna
[1:18:33] lift up my hands we singing this morning
[1:18:35] in English hey man I'm gonna lift up my
[1:18:37] head I'm free
[1:18:39] I'm free from all this amen glory to God
[1:18:43] in Hallelujah
[1:18:46] trials to free you
[1:18:49] there's three Hebrew children who are
[1:18:52] going through a fiery furnace amen there
[1:18:54] are walking in Satan's eating they had
[1:18:56] an image of Daniel they would not bow
[1:18:59] down to amen kind of like what they've
[1:19:01] done in this message sometimes amen
[1:19:03] there is an image of gold that they
[1:19:05] refuse to worship why only Jesus
[1:19:08] receives My Worship
[1:19:09] [Music]
[1:19:11] amen and they bound them in
[1:19:14] circumstances
[1:19:15] amen they bound them but he could not
[1:19:18] keep them there amen
[1:19:21] and God sent him through a fiery trial
[1:19:24] remember they were walking the whole
[1:19:25] time
[1:19:26] all right we're sending you to the fiery
[1:19:28] furnace remember that fire was seven
[1:19:29] times hotter
[1:19:30] uh God knows how to do it right like
[1:19:32] seven Church ages amen

[1:29:18] man was made for the Sabbath but it was
[1:29:20] the Sabbath made for man amen now look
[1:29:24] at the Rapture it wasn't like the
