thank you before Islam he has leukemia too so it makes it a little more difficult to procedures what he's having done so but like brother bill says there's there's nothing too hard for the Lord we know that we've witnessed that we also have a special ability and that's not to approach God as a servant you know he's our King he's our Lord and a servant approach the king and hope hoping that he can win the Kings favour and have his request granted but we approach as the bride sitting beside him his Esther's leaning over and whispering in the Kings ear her request so we can approach in faith

to make just a couple announcements remember brother there's come Lord willing this coming Thursday and Sunday if next week brother Daniel a4e will be here with us to minister for us and brother Daniel is no stranger here to us we just we thank God for the opportunity amen and that the brothers would be able to come by so we want to remember that in prayer don't you just appreciate the word of the Lord amen also the remember the baby shower here right after the service today it's at Perkins restaurant the sisters will be in the one the room that's there the shower and then the brothers all the brothers that would like to come have fellowship we'll find another place there in the restaurant and even a few this one you don't like their food but you just want to come and drink coffee boy there wasn't much of a response on that I'm telling you I've been places some times where I feel like I've been starved to death I'm gonna talk about a restaurant sometimes you know when you're visiting people and things like that and so I just drink coffee coffee will fill me up but I don't plan on doing that today hopefully I'm okay to eat but certainly appreciate the fellowship amen so let's just look right into the word this morning and I just trust the Lord will just really help us we certainly need his help don't leave without him were we're in trouble Psalms 127 verse 1 I sort of like to thank you for your prayers I I'm doing better than what I was when we got back here from from Edmonton and little by little they got me on a strong antibiotic I've been trying to get rest but sometimes you know you just can't turn things off and rest I wish I had that you know ability I was always in B my dad my dad could get in an airplane or my dad could say I'm stressed I'm gonna go take a nap I don't I don't have freak that way I wish I did I wish I could sleep in planes I can't I wish I could you know rest sometimes you just your mind is going in and you know with everything so and I have to Hey I have to jot down the things as God's giving it to me because if I don't sometimes I forget it and so I just I have to jot those things down but I just really covered your prayers I really appreciate that because I know that the Lord is moving amen well let's read here in verse 1 we'll start there and and go down a song of degrees for Solomon except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it except the Lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain that's a truth in except the Lord of all of our best intentions except the Lord it is vain for you to rise up early to set up late to eat the bread of Sorrows for so he giveth his beloved sleep low children are in the heritage of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man saw our children of the youth and happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate amen let's just bow for a word of Prayer Lord Jesus Lord we love you we appreciate you Lord and father as we have had these moments Lord just to be able to come together and to worship you Lord we just pray that you would just Oh God by your presence Lord through your word just set down in our midst and speak personally to a slore father of the study Lord the countless hours of time but yet that would be to no avail without you coming Lord so father I just desire Lord to give myself to you and the congregation together that father that that secret food Lord that you might know God so embody yourself Lord in our hearts and our lives Lord that we can be spiritually nourished Lord from You Father Lord we just ask that you administer to every need and any doubt dissolve it Lord questions Lord answered father I pray this morning Lord God we love you and thank you in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless your being seated I really like this morning as we approach this here another hardest children as arrows I'd like you to think of it here and I'm going to deal with it more on the contexts and things of more or less here where we would have like the looking at it in the the spiritual part of how that God would deal with us because really those are the things that really open it opens to us and we are able to understand it because there's things that we can look at here in the Word of God and you know it's always it's always fitting to look to the Lord to find the season we're in so that we'll know exactly what what he wants and what he desires at that time and we need to find that because sometimes there's seasons that where God has it and things can be spoken just like when the Lord Jesus when he stood there in John 6 and he said except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood you know there were many that walked away in that time they said this is too hard of an under of something to be understood and so their offense came because they couldn't understand it but yet there were those of the disciples that they remain yet they couldn't understand it they couldn't explain it but recognizing that it wasn't that season that their understanding would be open to them as a matter of fact it wouldn't be until the inspiration God dealing with Paul's life even after they themselves had come into this place yet Paul would begin to be moved by the Spirit of God and how that Paul could say I have received of the Lord and Paul would go in and begin to open that season to them of the word and then we know that that is not Paul but it's God that makes our understanding fruitful in the season when we have need of it everything that you can look at within the Word of God the whole sum of the Christian walk is arrest and it's looking to the Lord to know that God has the seasons within his hand it's the same thing in the raising of a children same thing with the church same thing in each one of our lives there's seasons within our lives there's chapters in our lives there's certain times where there's chapters maybe that we don't want to end and then there's other chapters we want to end there's chapters we like to revisit and there's other chapters we're glad they're in the past but nonetheless we look in all of these things to desire that God would have the complete oversight and direction of our lives because when you when you look at this passage of Scripture it is not something that is rote or confined to that of just looking at a family and the natural but to recognize that God himself has arrows in this our God has had arrows in every hour because God is not one with a bow without arrows but God has arrows for his bow God has a target that he desires to hit in every age he's got a purpose for everything he does he's got children in every age that are born of his genes children that he molds and he shapes children he has a relationship with children he has to such a refined point to wear that when the transfer of fur of power moves upon their life it's able to bear that and actually hit the mark that God has called for I'm glad that we are in the hand of that mighty man we are in his quiver and you know God does not shape and fashion our lives to have us as arrows that would just remain there as arrows and we could look and say mile what a what a nice arrow that is and the fletching and you know the nock and boy the spine on that arrow oh my the tip no God has a purpose for every one of our lives every one of our lives there's not one of our lives that are gonna remain just in the quiver but God has for every one of our life is strung on his bone it's been fitted to the measure of his life within this hour and so when we look at it in that in that in that part of it and to see that within this of the arrow itself and as we've been looking at then at that identity you look and you bring it down in even as we here to here this morning would be gathered here our inheritance and when we look at our inheritance here you know each and every one of us you've made up me to 23 chromosomes a father 23 chromosomes of mother Yeah right we've got certain things within our body that way that even that certain chemicals would be arranged in our body you know some of you I think I heard a prayer request about somebody with kidney stones or whatever more I know my wife she deals with kidney stones I don't deal with kid stones we've been we've had doctors that have told us drink this do this and do that don't do this and don't do that let me tell you something I drink all sorts of things I do all sorts of things and yet for her she has to watch everything she does why is that chemicals in her body but why wouldn't with what's different within me it's an arrangement in me but you know regardless of what it is there might be certain things in my physical being or in your physical being that you deal with that someone else doesn't deal with but yet within it all God is receiving glory to himself because God has ways we know God can heal us of situations and conditions but what is it if God would allow something to linger see sometimes we look at things like that and we don't term that to be glorious but remember your testimony is not that you are completely and no longer have it but your testimony is actually reflected in the midst of the tests and of the trial where you're able by the grace of God to conduct yourself with joy and that takes something greater than our abilities because our natural abilities we get frustrated we'd be ready to give up but I'm so thankful for the joy of the Lord not the happiness the joy of the Lord is our strength so I'm grateful to God for that so we look at this this 23 chromosomes from each and then you look at an even the way that we are natured within within our ourselves our outer nature and then you put on top of that and inherited nature inherited traits inherited things even in our nature our emotional makeup and all of these things here we did not ask for but yet these are things that gets compiled and then you put on top of that the experiences that we've had in life positive and negative and all of this comes together and this is who we are but you know what God doesn't look at that and say there ain't no way in the world I can do with that but God says I can make a trophy of grace out of that I can take that and make a trophy of grace because he already by his choosing already knows what part and that of himself that lays there so God doesn't get caught up with all of these things that I just spoke of but if you look at it on the spiritual side of it we are also we are of our heavenly father is that right our mother the Holy Spirit come on now that New Jerusalem we are born our DNA is of God it's nothing tied into this of the natural so to be able to see that if that is that is so in the natural then as we look in the spiritual then what about that strain of predestination as that would travel on down the line we can go back and though that we and our outer nature might be different from Joshua we might be different from Moses we might be different from Peter but yet that inner nature that strain of predestination we are of that same family tree the tree of life so then to look at this we we are we were just kind of looking over these parts to just to rest within the fact that the Lord indeed is our maker and we look at it in the scripture you know to think of how you know unique and how that God is so laid everything out you know there's times where no doubt that you or me we've been places and I think we were on vacation and we were actually I thought one of my aunt's was at this place every one of us people start saying hey you go over that way and you look this way and we thought one of my one of our aunts from Maryland was actually at the place back in July we were on vacation I mean it was just an uncanny resemblance now when we got around we started looking and then there were certain things that we started noticing certain little details but I'm telling you the way she wore her hair everything about it I was like oh my goodness this looks like my aunt and for a moment I got happy brother joy I thought my there here - that's so wonderful and you know as we got closer and you know my mom and my wife started going around where she was at around the corner and looking at the corn and think they wanted a bit more interested in buying corn than nothing they were actually trying to find out is this really her or not but you know what if there then something that you would have found somebody no doubt all of us have you see somebody sometimes it looks like somebody else and and you know you've maybe had somebody come up to you and mistake you for somebody else but there's one thing about it there are certain unique things about us that nobody else would have when it comes down to even thumb prints fingerprints and all those there's many different things we can go through and to see how God has such a uniqueness of how then he has set us apart and made us and that's all been according to his choosing he and for his reason now look at this in Psalms 95 6 let's just pick this up as we work with it this morning here david says o come let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the Lord our maker verse 7 for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture and the Sheep of his hand then we look in Psalms 103 know ye that the Lord he is God it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves in that the truth it comes down to what the Lord Jesus you know the Lord Jesus makes the statement in the book in the book of Matthew then he's actually addressing sometimes the anxiousness that can be a part of our life where he says who by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature by taking a purpose to try to change and try to either add to or try to be something else and you know there's a lot of things that I won't deal with that this morning but there's a lot of inspiration that can come around our lives but we always want to make sure that what we're being inspired by is that of the Lord is that right we can the weekend you know really appreciating one another there's things when you say my I wish I could be a little bit more like this brother a little bit more like that sister the real part about it is that we enjoy within that is Christ and yet God has made every one of us different they're unique even in the blend it all comes down with this it's all about us surrendering to God's will for our lives only if it was easier said he's you're done than it is said we are his people the Sheep of his pasture and they know God has a plan God has a plan he is not the author of confusion his plan doesn't always it never unfolds quickly but his plan is sure and his plan unfolds and as it's unfolding it requires a patience to look to him as it's unfolding just as you look and how things begin to take place through that through the days of creation we find that that's exactly where Eve she got in trouble there was inspiration that came her way and brought a confusion to her regarding the plan she ought to just been waiting for God to unfold for her life you know one thing about it this is one thing you can I'll tell you what I'll just say it is short like this you can take it to the bank and cash it and that is God's plan for your life his will it will always be peace it will always be peace you know there's always things that you can find in your life experiences that you have either been through things where God has made known as will that there are principles that will always come and they will always move right in unison with them and you think of that we could go into Noah's Ark and just looking at that and the will of God but it just comes to this here when God reveals his will it does not increase our anxiety but it brings a rest so that's one of the ways to always test those things when something is made known because when God reveals his will he reveals that this is what his desire is for your life and when he does that then you realize that Lord as you've revealed it then it's you that's orchestrating it then let me yield myself to you that you can get me in position where I need to be in order for your will that you've revealed to come to pass and that brings a rest within our life so to understand that God has a plan we look in the scriptures here and I've let me just refer to this and then I'm going to go to Psalms 139 but in Jeremiah 29:11 here Jeremiah's moving by the unction of the Holy Spirit and he says for I know the thoughts that I think toward you now in this setting of Scripture without dealing with it a lot this morning God's actually letting them know that in the midst of correction the correction itself is not confusion but correction has your amendment in mind correction has in it because what God has already predetermined the destiny of our lives that destiny cannot be changed but along the way you and I need correction we need the tutorship of the Holy Spirit and God will work and direct our lives and he's letting us know right here as he did to Israel that I know the thoughts the aim the purpose the plan that I have that I think toward you says the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you and expected in it just puts at arrest correction is not evil corrections are blessing but it's only a blessing if it's received is that right it actually can become a blessing and minister to our lives peaceable fruit so as we look here in Psalms 139 going on to verse 1 here we find in the opening part of this chapter here David says O Lord thou hast searched me and known me thou knowest my down sitting and mine up rising thou understandest my thought afar off ma thou compass thou compasseth my path and my lying down and aren't acquainted with all my ways for there is not a word in my tongue but lo o lord thou knowest it all together thou hast beset me behind and before and laid on hand upon me such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high I cannot attain unto it and we knows we looked at the latter part of this this chapter here it's part of the chapter where but the random will lay it in within this time and we can see very clearly the where that we were already as the redeemed elect of God were already wrote in God's photo album even before our members were ever formed yet they were perfect yet God even as David would go through it right here even in these opening parts God knows you realize God has let it know right here that I know you're down times and I know you're up times you know you and I we pray and we'll come before God we let him know how we're feeling we'll will say Lord Jesus I need help or you know sometimes you know when we're feeling really good a lot of times we maybe don't let him like let him know like we ought to but let me tell you he already knew about all of those things he knew about our down sitting our uprising everything about our life and you know when we look at this and all when it can so strike our hearts to know that God has known the end from the beginning he knows every aspect about our life he knows us you and I might think that we're coming to a place of really getting to know ourselves but remember he knows us better he knows us in and out I mean God is one then you know he he knows exactly and here's the wonderful thing about it even in knowing that he doesn't despise us of our down settings even knowing things about us he doesn't look down on it because one thing about it all of this is opportunities of His grace to be made known and be reflected through our lives so he knows all everything and I I look at it like this if he already knows all these things about our life then why in the world do we have to pry and try to find out why do we become so anxious about things sometimes it's because that we're still here in this sticky carnal nature it's a battle that that we have and so within and I'm grateful to God that God would would help us to be really focused and very direct within the battle that we're in because you got to know who you're fighting you got to know what you're fighting you got to know who your enemy is you're not just going into a battle just haphazardly and we're not talking about just general terms here but it's really coming to find out what is the problem as brother van will say it in the message he cares do you know dad said here's a man he said that maybe he's a drunkard in his life and he's you know come to drink brother man says we know what the answer is but he says what we want to find out is what's the problem how many times were brother branham if then just think about this let's just pause for a moment how many times think about the messages from that time how many times within that time that brother am go into situations where people had come into such great devastation and heartbreak whether it was the you know a CEO of the bank that the Prophet spoke about or whether it was that young girl or that young boy and brother Brad would deal with those things that what had taken place in their life did they need the Lord absolutely they needed the lord did they need a change in their life yes they needed a change in their life but he had to be able to go and find out what the trouble is I'm glad that God just does not give a simple tylenol aspirin answer but the Word of God is so direct to be able to deal with the problem in our lives aren't you grateful for that and this is the promise that you and I are under in this hour this is not a message of just generalities but this is very the very precision of Almighty God let me tell you this shaft has been down through the ages of the genes of his loins these fletchings of his character is being reflected in his children the very knock of relationship is on this arrow and the very point and sharpening of a people who are made ready for the coming of the Lord already and have been in every age to speak with the enemy at the gate and in this hour I believe I'm one other and I believe I'm looking at people right here that lives are speaking with the enemy right at the gate it's knocked up in his bowl in the fullness of his power where the token itself is being applied and the transfer of God's power and it's moving through our lives I believe that with all my heart he is our maker as we said you know looking at God's plan you know we look at it as far as with children you know we don't know what God's plan is not all of us have a visitation like Samson's parents did brother Bram told us you know in regards to his birth he said this day said that Nazarite birth was pertaining just for me and to see that how that you know brother brems parents didn't didn't know but when you look at it the plan itself and I believe this is a real walk of faith because to think of it that how that God would send in a message to each generation or and you know God he God has faith that his word is gonna produce God's not wondering he's not if God you know then remember he doesn't look at your ups he doesn't look at your downs God knows his word is going to produce within our lives think back to the service brother Stephen a Bali was dealing with remember on the sowing of the word think back to the service we're dealing with in the family sowing for the supernatural we're live upon that word and noticing drawing strength from that God's Word will not return to Him void it's true every one of us the reality of it is we are not where we want to be we're not because the reality there's a life within us that there is a desire to be closer to the Lord a desire that to see more of him in us and less of us it's a desire and we're yet at the same time we we have to look and rejoice that were not where we used to be it's very important for that recognizing he that brought you from there brought you to where you are is the same God that will continue to perform his word until it has fulfilled what he has determined it's just like in every one of our lives as believers the plan that's unfolded for our lives there's things no doubt maybe you know where you're at or where I'm at and you know today we would never have thought we would have been here some years ago whatever vocation or whatever you're doing where you live and whatever more but you know this is something that is Gretz marvelous is how God's plan unfolds for us as believers it's to trust him and say Lord I don't know the next step I don't know the next fold but one thing that I do know is I want to be in the center of your will I just want to serve you Lord in whatever the next chapter is and has the plan unfolds I want to serve you in a greater measuring and the serving and a greater measure is us actually surrendering more to him aren't you glad that he provides that you see the scripture it goes on and it says it like this you know in in John 14 it says let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you and I go to prepare a place for you and if I go place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also now watch out brother branham picking this up in my father's house are many mansions and things that are to be he says in my father's house is many kinds of mansions I don't believe that when we get to heaven that we will be just everybody look exactly alike I don't believe we'll all be blondes or brunettes or little or all big or all giants I'll take comfort there's gonna be some big people there but once brother I'm saying now listen listen to me now remember all wrongs will be made right there's no doubt about it sometimes we have maybe birth defects or whatever more but let me tell you something there is a birth that takes place that there is no defect it's an effect that birth effect upon our soul will lead to this body actually being changed and brought in to match that birth that's been on the inside it's not a defect it's an effect so here all things will be made right in that time they'll send it well I know brother so-and-so well I know sister so-and-so absolutely you'll know me you'll recognize them I believe that God look what look I brings this out I believe that God is a God of variety the world proves that he's got big mountains little mountains got plains he's got deserts he's got different things because he made it the way he wanted it he made the season summer winter spring and autumn he made the seasons it shows he's a God a variety he made you in a variety now watch our brother man says this some men are real blusterous and some are real dogmatic others are fine others are kind and you just find all different kinds of people and in his kingdom Oh Lord there's blusterous people in his kingdom yeah there's dogmatic people in his kingdom you know there's kind people yeah there's fine people yeah all kinds are in his kingdom but say no why would it be that way well my goodness friends that's not even a question for us to ask it's simply to rest in the part that God has made a variety you know God can take different people you know sometimes you can know people and if you don't really come to understand the people I'm talking about understand a person's heart you might come into and you talk with somebody you think man there are rough character but you know what sometimes what it is you just don't know their heart I've come to find out of places that I've traveled here over the past few years I've met some individuals that probably you know that maybe some of us would say my there's some rough characters but their heart their heart is huge they have such a big heart I mean it's full of love and yet you know just looking on the outer the exterior and those things you would just want to classify them this way but notice brother branham never put him out of the kingdom of God he's showing how things can be divinely placed he's not one that's going to lead us into false evidences but there is a true evidence glory be to God now watch this this is such a learning point for us he says look at st. Peter and judge him by Andrew Andrew is that prayer warrior just stayed on his knees all the time an Apostle Peter was one of those firebrands that preached Paul was more scholarly like luck the Prophet or something had set back see this all three were different and yet they were all in the kingdom and they were all necessary all of the scholarly life the firebrand and the rare lawyer all of that was necessary and a part of the body remember this is God's doing this is God's doing but notice if he says if you try to judge st. Peter by Andrew you see this is where Paul told us and he told the Corinthians he said that judged themselves by themselves are fools we are never to judge ourselves and compare ourselves among one another we are never to judge ourselves and compare ourselves with another Church no it is a sovereign work in a local body it's what is God's mind and will for our lives I told you you know I know I haven't traveled as much as maybe some brothers and that's fine with me it wouldn't bother me if I didn't travel at all but you know just a little bit that I've went with in the past three years I'll tell you what I'll find such differences I find you know what I as I stand and I talk you know with the different pastors and things like that and ministers I find that each one of them although we're here aiming for the same purpose but each one has a unique approach to the Word of God and how that God is so gifted him I'll tell you what I think God for such a wonderful bouquet I thank God for that God knows what you and I needed in there right God knows I love red flowers but I like pink ones too I like pink ones I like red ones but I like white ones too God has a great bouquet and he knows what he's doing and all of those things coming together they show the differences but yet it complements one another and just as much as this is here where you cannot judge one by the other it's the same way within our homes you know you can't judge one child against another I could not tell Paul or Benjamin or Zachary I cannot say to them and say hey Ben why don't you be like Paul immediately I'm sowing division between them immediately I am placing that this is a higher standard and you need to be like him but really what it comes to is that within them and you know within your own children every one of them are different now they get some of those differences all of the the mixing and everything that comes together it comes right from the homemade pot you're right it depends on how much they got of this and how much they got of that and they may have got 1/4 a teaspoon of this half a teaspoon of this they might have got a cup of this but whatever it is the mixture listen God knows what he's doing and within it though you and I maybe if you've got real little kids now you know you don't really maybe see the things maybe with the makeup and the temperament and these things here right now but you can start seeing little things but I'll tell you what when they get older you're able to look at things that you're working with and trying to help them to understand and you look back at baby pictures and say aha there it was right there uh-huh there was a three years old ah there it was at four years old you see what it is it's something that's come it was always there but now it's a season for us to be alerted to it to help guide it so that this shaft of this arrow this shaft does not end up wobbly and bent and crooked because this shaft of an arrow it's got to be on this end and this end it's got to be firm but right here it's got to be flexible and that's the same way it is with each of our lives there's a part of our life that's got to be so firm with knowing who we are in the Lord Jesus Christ and yet there has to be such a part about us of recognizing that we must be flexible to his working which means dying to ourselves oh so how could we judge Peter by Andrew well we need to put end-around put Peter in or pit feeder out and put Andrew in so we don't judge by that right there little rabito God brother BAM you know he picks this up and keeps working with this thought and I'm not gonna read the whole thing here but Road I'm will keep coming back and said notice many kinds of mentions he goes into in the quote 49 there he says he talks about many kinds of Hills many kinds of River Springs and lakes he says you know will you come here first because the kindness of your heavenly father placed them here because some men like mountains some likes waters some likes deserts my now watch he placed him here because if you like deserts he put the desert for you if you like mountains he did it for you if you like waters he did it for you did he have to do that no you see what brother branham yield and listen to me now brother Bellamy yielded to the Lord and God is letting you and I know of his care for our lives these things that might seem so menial and it would seem like it doesn't matter at all but listen friends in order for doctrine and for the word to work and move within our life there must be a relationship and the Lord Jesus himself shows even in this right here little simple things that sometimes we pass over but they are keys to unlocking the channel for us to surrender more to him and that is that he's showing by these things that you and I can look at it and say wow I really like those mountains men are in luck that rivers mile really like those things I really like that that's God trying to show I care I know that it's in your nature to lock those things and I want you to see I've already provided that here in this than to realize if he did that in the natural landscape how much more is he provided in the spiritual landscape how much more has he provided for you and I all along this journey for what you and I have need of aren't you glad for that Braham says now he says you're coming knew your nature and what you would be so he made it just the way that you could enjoy it so this wasn't this is what's for dinner eat it or refuse it no he knew think of this he knew things that would minister to you things that you would look at and say that's not even spiritual but yet God knew you and I here we are friends though every part of us is not spiritual there's a part about us and this part that I'm dealing with here this morning it's not a spiritual part but it needs ministry it needs ministry and God has so said it that it might be ministered to our lives I say Lord let me hear the voice let me hear your voice Lord as you speak to my heart upon your providential care for my life you believe God wants you to be happy you believe that I believe it I just there were the some of the things I've looked at for weeks and things now however what is it 47 muscles it takes in your face to frown now I know we look at that how I know that brother Simon but think about it it takes more work to frown and it only takes 17 to smile it's something in it we were made and ordained to be happy I could read you a litany of quotes on those things right there where brother BAM could go through it we ought to be the happiest people in the world now listen that part right there it's not something that can be demanded it isn't something that I say in automatic you say right away I'm gonna be happy I'm gonna turn this frown upside down no no this is not mind over matter but in order remember if that's how we're supposed to be then we need to make sure we get all the knobs and everything and looking at it and look to see is my enemy working upon my enemy and I need to really look that and discern it and withstand it hmm so God knows all these things about as a matter of fact brother Ram will say like this in the unveiling of God I don't time to read it but every Bell he likens God's molding and bringing our life every Bell had so much silver so much bronze so much copper because they had to get a certain team absolutely now watch our brother Bram says this here I love this quotes questions and answers 1959 he refers out of their the book of Ephesians in love he's chosen us in in love before the foundation of the world predestiny so watch that word having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will what about that brother Mike isn't that wonderful uh every time over the years I've read this quote I read my name in there isn't that wonderful brother Samuel I'm in here he loved you he loves you before there was a world he knowed your nature he knowed your weaknesses he knowed your habits aren't you glad I'm not God and you're not God we'd have been having them running 40-yard dash and see if they can what kind of time you got it what kind of can you do this again o weaknesses no and yet we and ourselves are filled with weaknesses glory be to God habits but you see God look God didn't choose based on weaknesses he did not choose based on habits because if it had been that way we would have never been chosen but he knew about all of this but his choosing is based on that of himself he knowed all about you what you was going to be and then when he looked all over the great universe as it was he said I choose you and when he did that before there was ever a speck of life than your eternal with God when you receive the Holy Ghost then you become eternal because you're with God you're a part of god you're as eternal as God is now throughout the Scriptures you're aware of you're aware in the scriptures of how that when God would set the stars there in the heavens and you notice of how that things that are even wrote even throughout the Old Testament of many of the things where it would describe many of the constellations you know our Taurus Orion please he would go into that of even seek Him who make it for seven stars and Orion those statements would be made regarding the constellations which the stars themselves would be rays of light or that of light and to think of how that the Prophet now wants you to watch on he goes into this here that brother Brandon will actually move into a place here and he's letting us know that what the Lord Jesus did before that what God did in Christ it's Christ who still comes and he moves and he works within our life and brother webb says he uses our tabernacle and right after he makes that statement about how that he uses our tabernacle now in truth be known he does not use your tabernacle or my tabernacle because it is somewhat fitted better because it has certain things that are better than somebody else or whatever more that's not how God chooses to use us as a matter of fact God has a real sense of humor he will call you and ask you to do things that are entirely against your nature and it's God will do things in that manner so that he himself alone can receive the glory and mold and shape and my we can go for examples down through the scripture it is by no means because that we and ourselves are able to do it we've seen the failures of that Moses failed though having knowledge of the word but it was not about Moses performing it it's about Moses surrendering to God and allowing God to perform it right it would have made sense for God to call somebody who could be a great orator he's got a message to bring after all why would God call a stutterer he said he was of a slow tone but you see God received glory think of that Moses had to surrender it wasn't just his mouth Moses had to surrender his pride to think to stand in the council he knew what it was to stand in the counsel of Pharaoh's court where all the great dignitaries would be and to be able to call to stand there and make statements like this when you're already the outcast of Egypt when they already think you're not but yet God would call him and has ordained him to stand there and God is not looking about his ability that's why God says Moses stop all the excuses it's not changing my plan I'm still gonna use you so when we get through all these excuses here because you're trying to make your weaknesses excuses or reasons you know sometimes we think humility is looking down on ourselves that's not humility humility is not thinking less of yourself it's thinking of yourself less not thinking more highly than we ought to think so God brings Moses to this place to rest and to trust in Him now what's wrong brother Ram uses this right after this point in questions that answer 64 he said now notice this person that's in you you are John Doe you were born in a certain month you were born under a certain star you were born under a certain thing and that has something to do with you the program's not telling us to go seek out astrologers star gazers that's not what he's pointing out here but he is letting us know that all of the things with the stars themselves all of the birth paths and all of this has an effect upon our life hoga brother Samuel would somebody gets born of the Holy Ghost that don't make that statement yet because there's more to come brother Branham goes into it when you know reading this statement you know his daddy told him about planting potatoes planted at a certain time when the moon's at a certain phase and brother Brad said I ain't planting potatoes on the moon daddy and his daddy said go ahead smart aleck program goes into how that the moon the light the reflection it has an effect on the growth but I'm spends two paragraphs within that and then he comes right back around and says sure it's got something to do then it goes into why did Aaron have on his breast plate the birthstone of each one of those patriarchs the burnt stones did not drop out of heaven they were already here on earth but for choosing the positioning was already set in God's mind but God had things on earth that would reflect the positioning of where his children would be so those birth stones were carried into the presence of God not on the back of Haran but they were carried across his hearts let me tell you something you and I we have been there in the presence of God our names on the Lamb's Book of Life it has been there before there was a speck of eons of time we were always there and represented in him and in his choosing he knew exactly what bit of time that we would come forth the birth stone that you and I would be born under just as much as you and I were born under a natural star in a certain month we have been born under a spiritual star under a certain time under a certain season a certain age for a certain work glory be to God well he says look at those mothers when they gave the utterance when them mothers and them Hebrew women in labor giving utterance to bring those them children being born it placed their name he had told their birth yet put him in the homeland it sent him over into eternity but Adam goes on to it he says now sometime I want to take that he said what's Jacob when he was dying here when he laid his hands upon the patriarchs and blessed them he was telling them exactly where they would be that's according to their name exactly according to their birth and sure it has something to do with you now watch how he goes into this now that's your birth path that's what you are a natural man or natural woman but when you're reborn again that's not the outside conscience the outside is what you see taste feel smell and hear but the inside of that is what you really hard now this out here he's talking about this out here this birth path out here this out here Satan just tempts you and knocks you around everywhere here but down here you can't do it unless you let him do it but see you're able to stand your ground firmly here when you're also able to discern this out here glory be to God birth passes birth path is important in it well let's just watch here just for a little bit brother Graham says now notice for in here you've got faith and faith don't come from the outer conscience it reasons but in faith there's no reason you've got it from God and you know it's there I don't care how much it looks wrong you still know it's right it's thus saith the Lord and there's nothing going to bother that nothing can bother it it's moving right straight on difficult means nothing to it it raids right through it for its steward so the outer conscience under that birth path can stand in opposition but the inside man omaha standing on this says the lord it'll go completely against that outer conscience as a matter of fact the outer conscience will say you can't do this you shouldn't do this this isn't for you but that inside man will stand there and said I can't explain it there isn't even anything but I could put together as far as factual but it's just something that I know and you stand there by that inner birth path glory be to God now watch this questions and answers part 3 1964 now here's brother Branham dealing with the sister that she's had a question on whether or not she's had the Holy Ghost and brother bamas talking about talking to the sister here and he talks about how that he says you know I've talked to a medicine buddy this morning in an interview and he said I guess that person is still here and the person is a genuine person a real person they've lived right and they've heard me say the evidence of the Holy Ghost wasn't speaking in tongues and it isn't but what's that say go ahead say I oh it's not even up there why what happened it's on the email you look at this I advised I advised that person oh my lord well this would make great things for school for the scoffers right but it's because they don't understand the wisdom of God I advise that person to ask God to let them either speak in tongues or prophesy because it's the nature you mean God cares about that outer birth path yeah yeah because he's the one to sing to it the certain month the certain star and the certain sign so he understands that and he cares about that aren't you glad that God finds the problem aren't you grateful for that notice what brother Brennan goes in here saying I love this the first thing I went to that person and found their birthplace so before he's talked to him he said the very first thing I did I went to that person and found their birthplace and what sign that they were born under and could tell what their birth was which way it set in their natural nature sets them in a certain line oh my goodness Miss Emma don't that weak in your faith it raises my faith because remember faith worketh by love he's expressing his care for our lives sometimes friends and listen I think sometimes this is not a product of the message the message does not blow us up with pride that's not a product of the message that's where it gets in that outer intellectual realm and we think we know something but when it really really look at these parts within here God is not bypassing this woman and saying I'll tell you what you just need to have faith in the word you just got to believe the word what if she had been something that somebody would have just been preaching that to a preaching that to her it had never helped her although that was the truth but you see the Prophet here leading under the leadership of the Lord you see the Prophet was not a nut whew he was not an oddball as far as making himself odd he was a submitted channel of God and you know what God manifests right through this ministry in this hour that he cares he cares aren't you glad notice he said then when they're reborn again they're over here in another nature so when we're reborn again were then in another nature now he says that's you find this nature that's the inside the inside conscience the outside conscience moves you in one way that's your natural birth then they'll make up something and it put some what under a for whatever something like that numerology birth Path birth number under a for and it puts them in a split condition they don't know what to do they'll say the Lord wants me to do this and the inside says I just know it lines up with the scripture and they'll start to do it and the first thing you know Satan on this outside will show them all kinds of defects in it anybody ever been there I've been there I've been there matter of fact I've been there in this very next statement as well but if you haven't been there you will be because remember it's by experience it's by experience notice this and then they'll say well I guess I and they listen to sing you've got to take that inside something and that's what the inside of you that's scriptural and don't let Staton stand anywhere that's his duty to stand there and pound at you like that but don't you listen to him that person I told him they said well I know if I could just be sure of having the Holy Ghost a dandy person real loyal person with the Holy Ghost but it would be good for her to say father just to give me this for something to stand on Bill Graham goes on to tell us I can't preach this as doctrine you say because you had people grabbing toward the wrong thing but you see here it is God dealing with individually it would be good for her aren't you glad that the Lord has ministered things for you and for me that's been good for you than good for me aren't you glad God might have had a strain maybe had a minister come in maybe you were somewhere else maybe it was something that here you are listening to the message and brother BAM will just go into actually telling a little story and then working something around and all of a sudden something will click it'll come around and right then in there it just seems to open to you that is God's care for you and me oh my it's so precious not to think of this here you know the Bible when we look at it because you know no matter of how Holy Ghost filled the parents would be the genes of the children are still the genes of father and mother still that way and we still have inherited physical and emotional traits but yet God has a plan the Bible says in second Corinthians 5:17 therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature all things are passed away behold all things are new brother Graham takes the scripture over and over and brings it home for us it's an inner work within our lives a change has taken place a new creation in the same old temple now if we and I would have had our choice we would have said Lord and I get the new birth I want the glorified body as well I want my feel thing and so that human spirit go ahead and change it out right now but remember all of this is for our proving it's our testings right without the trials of life without the tests of life without the molding in our life where would our fletching be on our arrow how would we fly you with me so notice how God has it here there is a outer nature and there's an intern a church we've been looking at this year now notice this program says when in the message when divine love is projected when you become a son or daughter of God your disposition changes your attitude changes your all your look towards the life and towards others changes it doesn't mean you've joined the church it means you've been regenerated you become a new creation and cries and the old things have passed away and God has spoken to you and you have become a new creation so the Holy Spirit he now sets down on the throne of our heart that inner disposition is changed the darkness that was there that was covering that light that seed that was there that germ of life the darkness has been removed and the light has come to quicken what he already sewed and node was there but what about all my weaknesses what about the habits remember the quote that we read he knowed your nature not all of that but God knows one thing if I can move and I come to the innermost part but not of the throne of your heart if I am seated there I will absolutely be able to exert control over all these things because after all if you want to change the kingdom you change the king you change the administration and once the administration changes there'll be changes in the kingdom changes don't come overnight but changes are coming it becomes a kingdom of change that leads to change change change from glory unto glory unto glory unto glory glory and when Christ this is why people are so tossed about when Christ the Holy Spirit comes into your heart he is in you with your temperament so the new birth did not do away with my temperament then do away with yours oh so that's why there's some that's dogmatic some that's blusterous it's not saying that those things are okay you're with me because every one of us has strengths and we've got weaknesses and even in what is a strength can become a hindrance if it's not yielded to God Abraham was strong in faith but Abraham's faith could not make Ishmael the promised son so all of our strengths all of our weaknesses have got to be yielded to the Lord if there's anything today we think bla think I think I've really got something that could be a real and real added benefit you run as the Oh Lord help me that's already a thought of backsliding right there I'm already drifting from your presence that I need you Lord Jesus not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord when Christ the Holy Spirit comes into your heart he is in you with your temperament and he is living his own life through his own will through you oh he said I know that sounds awful but it's right Christ so yielded you are that Christ speaks the kind of words he would speaks he thinks the kind of thoughts he would think through you he does the kind of works he would do through you you are yielding and rested what a beautiful picture of a consecrated Christian yielded God is working through huh if I was choosing what temperament to put on their mind I wouldn't have put on my temperament maybe I ought to get to looking at the other code of Tim oh no I don't know about that one Lord I'd like to have this right here I'd like to have this one with this and this is what I don't want that I'll hey you know what that is that's the earnest of the body change because over there all wrongs will be made right you realize that's why we know the body change it's not about you and I just going back to young people we'd end up in the same mess we're in now it's got to be a change completely do you realize it's not going to be on the other side where I said well this person pushes my buttons and this person pushes my buttons remember you won't have those buttons to be pushed and they won't have fingers to push them even then that going to be wonderful glory be to God in the highest well why wait glory glory glory Paul said to me to live is Christ and to die is gain not me that liveth anymore but Christ that liveth in me Christ living in the individual so surrendered when Christ speaks through the lips thanks through the mind sees through the eye acts through the temperament acts through the temperament you cannot judge Peter by Andrew I am fearfully and wonderfully made and now I will praise thee how do we praise thee I bow down like when God revealed to Joshua the battle-plan of Jericho Joshua immediately went on the ground and said what would you have your servant do hallelujah think of this of think of the great marvel of how God would bring everything together in the body I want you to look at this this scripture just for a moment gonna turn there but in subscription we're familiar with an ax - verse 1 the Bible says when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place see they came in one Accord not because the Holy Ghost had already come but they were waiting in expectation for his coming and it brought them into unity what's it doing that what has the message that God has sent to us the unfolding of Christ in the sound what does it do it brings the people of God together are uniting for what the promise so what are we united around that we're all the same no no if we had off we had our choices or we looked at it we thought what in the world is this group of people doing together but that's God's choosing that's God's choosing think about it in the in the early church how that you had those who were servants you had masters and you know what they set in the same views and shouted one was a servant and the other one was their master and they shouted you had a kind people of different degrees different origin you had rich you had poor you had all sorts of people all kinds of backgrounds you had some that maybe their life was so pristine and thank God for that then you had other lives that Paul would have to be moved by the Spirit of God because they would get so caught and so jammed up within their mind and their conscience about their previous way of life and Paul let them know of the power of the redemptive flow of the blood of Jesus Christ and he would help them why so they could look beyond that and be able to do what he himself had done and that was learned to put the past behind me he had to do that you see that's God faithfully ministering to us as his children aren't you glad for that aren't you glad that y'all got don't look around say come on man get over it come on get over it you don't know what I've been through well I wasn't this way when y'all you don't know how I was when I was growing up get over it hey times have changed but God still the same see that was not the attitude that got applied that's not the attitude that even right here that the Prophet used at all it's not the attitude but what is it it's God ministering to you and I for what surrender surrender doesn't come by demands or commands surrender is submission and submission comes by love that is projected and when love itself is projected and comes to its end Grace will step in and take over and produce what love has called for so you're talking about having faith for the unfolding of God by the plan of God God has faith as he's watching the unfolding in our life God's not biting his nails bouncing up they're wringing his hands well no he's resting and his rest is exerted and moves upon us he reminds us over and over can I have just a few more moments they were all in one place with one Accord this this point this word right here one Accord or the phrase that's used you know it's used in multiple times throughout the book of Acts but this very scripture that's used or this word that's used out of the Greek it speaks of that which is like a great symphony where you have all types of notes that are being moved together and different pitches but they're all coming and running together in such unison of how that God would so set in the body even all the differences but all of it is necessary for his working God knew what he needed as he put Paul together oh but the same thing anybody could have done it that was yielded to the Lord no they couldn't have it's who God had for the job and God so fixed Paul's nature for that moment you understand as the Prophet tells us that God seeing the messenger of the age will so fix the nature of that man to catch the people of the hour that's God's doing oh my think of this let's look at this here with the Prophet just for a moment here it is as we looked at these statements of God acting through a temperament God acting through a temperament brother batam here he is you know he's already sent in a gun to the Winchester Factory and he's let him know something's wrong here it's not driving tacks straight in the in target they look at it and say was never meant to do that brother Brad said I know it can be done cuz I've already proved it see brother bran was trying to align and work it with the bead and everything else to get it to do what he already knew it could do so he was all worked up about this then here he is out in the woods squirrel hunting I know you're familiar with this but he says here I am he says I'm sitting under the tree and here's brother Woods and the rest of them up there banging it squirrels they hit him everywhere they want to front and anywhere you don't make any difference just as long as they hit the squirrel having a big time and I was sitting under a tree I started crying and I said Lord why did you make me a little nervous wreck why did you make me like this why can't I go out there and enjoy hunting what they do and have to have this gun in a super condition I waited there for about a half hour and laid down on my face and begin to cry and the Holy Spirit come to me and said I made you that way for a purpose that's for a purpose when one says one thing and hits loosely like that you can't stand it unless it's searing it has to be on the dot or it's not right I said I see the Lord you see how God moved on the scene at that time this was troubling to him God didn't just pass it off and say get over it snap out of it but God come and ministered why he needs to understand this if he doesn't he's always gonna be fighting what God had made him I would run so I could be like this and I wish I could be like this I wish I do just be what God made you to be surrendered to his will once you come into that it's rest you understand it's rest once God brought this to him he said I see now look at this how many years how many years brother brems has been ministering for how many years years how long's has been going on no doubt things that he's dealt with in his life think of this there's a part about his temperament is perfectionism that can be a positive that can be a negative it has to be governed by the Holy Ghost by no means was the Holy Spirit telling him here that your temperament is absolutely perfect but he's letting him know the conditions of things that you like things to be perfect that indeed I've made you that way for a purpose and brother Ram goes in to explain that to us he said because when the denomination says that God's killed or moved the same way he said I know that's a lie God moves the same way what he hit the target one time he'll hit it again you see that was not his spiritual nature that was that natural birth path whew but you see Liz Christ in there with his temperament and that temperament was so set for him for this age to carry the message and let me tell you something your temperament is set to carry the message horribie to God but we know we can't carry it but Christ can carry it through us hey man notice I've made you that way you know it might have been something let's just say I was like this let's just dramatize in a moment let's just say that maybe here he was the Prophet himself he's thinking why am I like this why is this way was that maybe he is a teenager maybe he's 20 years old still maybe 21 and here his father comes up next to him and says son I understand let me guess you're thinking about this like this how do you know your of this gene pool relating helping him you see God doesn't want you despising your temperament oh brother Samuel all we needs the power of God this right here if you despise your temperament God can't move it's to let go and let God have his way just watch this how many times we hear brother brems say over and over if I can just get William random out of the way God can do things William Branham no it's nothing so it's to get it out of the way now watch this being content being content remember the scripture said by the grace of God I am what I am bill arraignment question answer says be thankful for all things I am thus because I am thus God made me what I am and I can't be nothing but what he made me melancholy and those kind of things they tell me I just have to be that way in order to be the help that he sent me here to be I want to be that kind of a person if that's the way I was supposed to be that's what I want to be whatever is the kingdom of God's will or God's will that's what I want to be he's at rest he's at rest with the temperament but it doesn't mean that he can just be at ease he's got a govern that temperament but he's not governing it with his own intellect he's governing it as a son of God he's been birthed by the Spirit of God the spirit of God is sitting right down there in the midst of his emotions in the midst of his temperament think of this how many times were brother brand himself look at this a part of it I don't have time to go through all the different temperaments and read these different things their strengths and weaknesses within each and every one but think of the number of times with perfectionism perfectionism one of the parts with melancholy is perfectionism and needing to feel accepted by people now not one of you including me in here is one straight line melancholy or chloric of saying I phlegmatic we've got a mixture but I want you to look at this right here how many times where the Prophet was honest before us to where he stood and he criticized people come on you know I showed you those things right here where he has criticized and he says in my heart I'm critical I can't go out there feeling this way in my heart he identifies it as a critical selfish spirit what is that that's governing that temperament so brother BAM is not by no way looking and saying then everything I think everything I feel everything I say that's just Christ acting through me no more than it is you or I it's a governing no wonder when Paul would say that I bring my body in subjection he's talking a lot more than just your flesh more than just those five gates of the Spirit he's dealing with our temperament and our makeup some of these things are wonderful in one sense such as like chloric a cleric can maybe be wonderful in a sense that they are a self-reliant person hey that's a wonderful thing but it can be a big negative thing too because it can cause a person to where they don't need nobody they don't need a new reality of it is we do we need one another but yet at the same time when it comes to walking with God no doubt as a chloric there's parts within their temperament that would be a little bit more stronger than maybe a same guy because the same guys one man they can just see the vision hey hey let's just do this and they've got a great vision but there's no follow-through but you need same guys you need people with vision then you need people to pick up and make that vision become manifest see how God has everything so divinely orchestrated my it's beautiful it's beyond the comprehension isn't it notice brother brems says I'm a temperamental person melancholy sort of person what's this I can't let myself get away Satan takes advantage of me on that for the Rams dealing was even saying goodbye it bothers him so he says I won't even say goodbye to you I can't let myself get this way Satan will take advantage of me isn't he filled with the prevailing power of God he is but part of being filled with the prevailing power of God is coming into maturity to recognize our strengths and our weaknesses the maturity is not about oh I'll never make no more mistakes you're thinking about the other side but the reality with maturity is you learn by experience and the virtues in our life grow by experience I keep my body under subjects many many places in the scriptures where Paul would speak of our body he said let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lusts thereof even in Romans 12:1 by the mercies of God that you would present your bodies a living sacrifice think of this here in the message perfect faith prevents us now many of you will be waiting over till the morning it's got a long distance ago and I appreciate that effort some of you will drive home tonight because you got to go to work by daylight in the morning I know it's hard he says I get spells too you know I get Moody well that's hard to imagine that ain't it hmm I get to a spot to where I what gets me is where I get to those fells when I get all overworked and Satan comes telling me why nobody cares for you you really haven't got a friend in the world see oh so what's the problem well the problem is we'll just cast that devil away that's saying that that's not the problem the problem is getting overworked it's learning your enemy if the enemy can keep you moving and moving in that pace and moving in that pace and moving in that pace then they just get you set up to wear down and then he's ready to say well I know their guards gonna be now so I'll just come in with a little punch and nobody really cares about you so it isn't devil I say in the name of the Lord no this is called knowing how to possess our vessel unto sanctification and honor when I get overworked that's when Satan comes at me remember look at this I'm not immune to the temptation see I got to overcome that well he's already got the overcomer on the inside that's true but he's learning you see these things right here that's shared right there brother BAM no doubt has been hit with this over and over and over even to her brother Ram would spend countless times through the message interweaving it all the way through even where God would so move on his heart to take a word from the Lord to other people and let them know you've overworked yourself it is not God that brought that stroke upon you it's not God that brought the heart attack upon you you stayed too long in the presence of God and you shouldn't do that because Jesus don't want you to do that someday I'll preach that whole that whole Canada word I've been collecting for years because you know what that's been counseled to me and the counsel that I've received within that and you know maybe you don't mean it's easy when we hear these things like this you think this was easy for brother Brennan he said I've got to overcome that part of overcoming is to do what first recognize the enemy and every one of his tricks now you see right here you see brother Joey the way that the enemy I'd like to put this oh yeah you're not been praying enough you not been reading enough you've now been getting your Bible enough you not been doing this enough and really that may not even be the issue at all and here the devil's got us chasing men all round yeah well I gotta do this I gotta do that what are we doing more overworked instead of yielding because how does God speak to us yielding how do you meditate yielding you okay can I have another hour just a few more moments please I'm not trying to cram in again I just want to I want to get this to you by them says this in Church of the Living God sir you're a very deep thinker aren't you you're always studying things and if I'd say this that you might know you cross bridges many times before you get to her that's hereditary that's your makeup if you watched well how brother BAM goes into this and he deals with this inner nervousness it's part of the makeup the disposition the temperament the personality you can no longer no more go over to this person say I want you to return every material every bit of bridge building material send it back ha you're wasting your breath but here to see what's happening what's happening for this brother right here the problem is being addressed it's not somebody's tongue hey you need to quit being so nervous I mean what neural is being nervous about well to be happy in the Lord you know everything is secure in the Lord Jesus Christ that ain't gonna answer his problem sometimes we think we got the answer to everything sometimes the best answer we've got if we shut our mouth and open our ears and listen I know that was plain I'm not always straight but I hope we get it cuz you know what sometimes when you come in here I come in here sometimes you know what I'm just down sometimes I'm just down well y'all get down to sure sometimes I can tell just even by preaching to you but that don't all through what I'm gonna Minister my desire is when I'm standing here my prayer is that God would come and minister to you and lift you your face may not change here but it might be something it's just so moved in your heart it's like a little grain of sand on the inside of you let's starts moving and by the time 6 o'clock rolls around my you're actually starting to even think about smiling and then it gets to Monday morning my goodness you're smiling Tuesday come along what insert the word the kingdom of God is having an effect perfect love that's what God is doing I just believe that if we stay and preach this word this word brings the change I believe that was on my heart the Holy Ghost accompanies that word it's him that brings the change and no matter how loud the minister is how still he is how active it is that has nothing to do with it that's the makeup of a man but the word is the word and Christ is Christ [Applause] 19:50 obey the voice of the angel my brother is talking to another man here's a sick man brother brems let him know you got troubles he said you know what sir he said you got heart trouble stomach trouble he said you've consulted a doctor listen listen this I know I may not have the all these lines up there you consulted a doctor about this they didn't give you much hope you believe with all your heart he said I want you to look at me when I'm talking to you your whole trouble has been is your makeup there was an appeal that could have fixed his makeup there's not a doctor that could have fixed his makeup the same God David wrote back in Psalms 139 is right there letting him know I know you're down sitting I know you're up rising and I'm letting you know the culprit to your problem is your makeup so what do I do Lord are you gonna deliver me on my makeup I already have delivered you greater am I in you than he that's in the world more than what do I do first of all it's recognizing your makeup how many times brother BAM remember he would deal with certain things with people certain people had certain times when they would get down look what he would tell them you or I may look at it at first before we come across these things we would tell a person and say I'll tell you what you need to do you need to sit down and read your Bible that's what it is you're not spiritual enough you need to sit down and read your Bible tell you what else you need to do you need to get out you need to be listening to tapes you need to be doing this what did the Prophet tell them to do put on some good snappy gospel music Wow why because they needed that do you realize friends God don't only speak to you when we're reading the Bible or when we're listening to the message home and we're sitting in church but many of the times God will speak to us it's things after we've listened to the message and we're sitting on work or out in the store or driving at all of a sudden we're thinking on something that just so has grabbed us and all of a sudden it just comes winding down from the eternities and all of a sudden it lights up was oh I got it I see it well is it God speaking to you Satan will attack this one more can I read one more Satan will let me rock on oh man somebody gonna be trying to figure out my temperament don't you dare try to sit there and try to figure out my temper in my own preacher but Satan will try to attack you on this you see here the way that God will come and use your temperament Satan also studies you too and he'll also come and attack you right there in those places he also knows how that birth path how that can work against you and he'll come in and try to attack you in those places in the message or the private interview before the prayer the Granta preaches the message masterpiece here brother branham is speaking to sister Georgia Bruce she said brother Branham most of all I want the experience that I've been sealed in the Holy Ghost and if God will reveal it to your heart she's got to know this how many sister Georgia's here oh yeah yeah I believe with all my heart watch this that you are real born-again believer sister Bruce how could that spirit just leave when you get sick you get weary you're a nervous type person sister Bruce says yes and you get things on your mind see little bitty things it just keeps building up both ways you'll get somebody on your heart and you want to pray for them you get up and pray for it you can't rest till you get that person prayed for that's you what's this then take the other side Satan maybe might present something to you out this way you're a nature and God works and Satan works and then when Satan tries to make you believe that you are not sealed you keep building this and maybe this and this notice you keep building this Wow evidently sister Bruce is not the same guy then you have a man it gets called good evidently her nature her temperament is not a sane guy maybe her temperament is perfection I don't know I don't know I don't need to know but what I do know is that God was mindful enough to address the problem the problem wasn't she did she didn't need the Holy Ghost she already had the Holy Ghost but what it is is that Satan would study her and knew that she would get a certain way somebody come on her mind she couldn't rest till she pray for that person as a matter of fact after I preached down to brother Tim Humes one year right after I got done preach and I'd refer to this part for something I was ministering brother Tim got up and he referred and opened this story up my goodness wouldn't understand it opened to me I'd never know that unless this was told it was not sister Bruce that requested this interview this interview was an interview that was requested by brother Branham himself because he heard that sister Bruce was born around the tabernacle and she would go up to mama Humes and different ones and said I wish I had what you had I wish I had what you had and brother Brandon requested an interview with her aren't you glad that God request interviews with you and me girl repeater God amen to do what stabilize us you see it would do no good what if one of here she is before brother Brennan it takes some wisdom of God because if she comes up here and brother BAM begins to pray for a whole God fill it with the Holy Ghost the Lord just filled with the Holy Ghost because the Lord you know how it is shall no day time our moment minute what's your dispensation you're under what you know is there's a change and you know there's a change about the fruit it bears come on somebody you gotta follow the dispensation of the word as it progresses and to recognize within this how the Prophet what is he doing he's bringing her faith not to rest in her makeup you realize what's going on here he is dissembling Satan's army Satan no doubt has had a field day with sister Bruce no doubt he's had a field day with some of us but he says you keep building this and maybe this and this don't look at yourself sister Bruce remember she says I make so many mistakes and I fail so many times he said that's why Christ had to die with your mistakes wouldn't be allotted to you what's he working with he's working with that temperament right there he's giving that daughter of God on the inside jurisdiction by what the authority of the word he's dividing that part which is that natural birth path from the spiritual all he says he took your mistakes your desire in your heart is to serve Him she said yes that's what he died for so you could serve Him your mistakes are not lauded to you he is your perpetuation he is your sin offering your sins are not knowing you're not a sinner before God Christ took your sins and became you because your desire is to serve Him and she says but I never had an experience but I've been filled with the Holy Ghost that I can put my foot on where is she getting this from do you see how Satan will take the word and turn it and use it on you he has taken truth and turned it on her and her temperament being as it is it just took it oh the deliverance that's come all right ordinarily a human being is born in sin watch this I just love this ordinarily our human being is born in sin shaped and iniquity come to the world speak in lies that's the nature of a human being sister bruce says yes that was your nature that was your nature it changed once but what changed it and you said Christ they're your sister that's it what's he just done gave her something to put her foot on Oh glory be to God wow this arrows gotta fly straight the identity of who she is sure just like with sister Bruce and just like me and you oh my this outside part of us sticky taco whirl but the inside there has been wheat life that's been transmitted in the outside will be sticky brother Benham says it like this it'll bother you until the day you die I'll tell you this right now I'll just say thank God it bothers me don't you thank God it bothers you because you're not what you used to be it didn't used to bother you the way that it bothers us is because our desire is to please him that's what gets to us is when we Lord ah I don't want to let you down I don't want to displease you but in everything God through experiences he brings us to surrender again and again and you and me can say just like Paul o wretched man that I am Who Shall deliver me from this body of death I thank God through Jesus Christ my lord ah ha ha you talking about an Ernest moving into our heart of the body change oh yes but in the meantime His grace is sufficient and it is prevailing over all of our weaknesses over all things it's prevailing no wonder I love how the Prophet takes that place prevailing power it's prevailing don't you love him hey we're a chip off the old block we are a shaft of his choosing mm-hmm Lord just help me to be more surrendered yielding all of my strengths and all of my weaknesses and everything that you'd be glorified that you can act through it by the salmon you still Bronco my hahaha still growing and I still see by the growth I got a lot of grown to do because I looked at where I've come from and I said Lord I didn't even think I had that much back there but what I didn't think and what I really had it makes me aware right now oh my I've got a lot to go but you know what I'm growing you know what you're growing don't measure it by what it is that you might see or don't see just rest water the word and let the word produce what he said he will do he's doing it you love him this would be the name let's stand I know some me ain't gonna believe about it I mean to keep it this long but I trust that you're blessed this morning encouraged I trust this morning that out of this that you can see I see the problem and you're able by the help of God to address that problem a lot of other things you know beyond our temperament they own these things we've get sometimes we got scars in our life we've got disappointments we've got all everything so much complexities you know even when you look at complexes but the brand was so honest and open with us about the complex that he had formed you know the complex itself you look at certain parts about our temperament and our makeup it'll form it's easy to form in those areas of weakness it is it's very easy it'll come to us in certain ways and I'm grateful to God that God will teach us and he'll help us you know something I was just brother I was talking to another brother last night and the pastor talked to me it's talking about a presentation and things like Adhan and some things I had done on wounds and healing and their stages you know of healing when there's a wound there's four stages and when there's a there's a sometimes when you look in your life sometimes there's a healing and you can look at it in your life and you can think I'm not I'm not getting any better I'm gonna get any better but the reality is is that to know the stages of healing it's not something that takes place overnight but there's four stages I thought that's powerful it's four stages of healing and one of the last stages that shows a skin maturation as we start getting that pinkish and that marbling look you look at that say lion healed yet it and ain't blend it in with the rest of it but it's on its way you realize when there is a wound and everything itself will scab together you can stand there and say Healing is coming oh it's a scab right now I can still see the ugly mark yeah but it won't be there for all its stages what I got to keep doing keep letting him clean it with his loin nents and pouring in the medicine that's needed he's a good innkeeper and he he knows how to tend to those things he has the true essential oil he knows how to put it in and he knows how to sue this he knows how to move so that it brings healing in her life all of this he knows he knows only thing we have to do is say Lord I surrender I said and let him show you if you look at something maybe there's a wound in your arm maybe something now the Lord would have me to say that maybe something you can just let the Lord say lord I can see just look back saying what I'm not where I was and you might look at say I don't think I'll ever get here don't say that you won't you are not where you were you're headed somewhere you're headed somewhere thank God you don't got infection thank God you don't got infection let's pray together could we more Jesus what so many so many of things that you've spoke to us this morning I realize the Lord that it's not about that we would remember everything but how did you speak so personal to deal with what the real problem is what I want to say thank you for these examples that are laid out right here in the message thank you Lord I'm so glad they were captured on wire magnetic tape whatever it was I'm glad I'm so glad it was left I'm glad for this Lord these are things Lord that you show your care you're concerned how you ministered to our life you teach us Lord right through these things you teach us Lord how to minister as a husband as a father as a pastor as a deacon as a trustee as a brother to a brother sister his sister you teach us right here Lord forgive us sometimes more the things that we overlook seem to be so simple but they are keys that open and unlock the channel but your life my flow lord help each and every one Lord here this morning myself included Lord help us father no matter where we are at in our walk with you I pray that father knowing that you that have begun the good work in our life you'll perform it to the day of Jesus Christ and father we ask Lord here in this service Lord God we don't want to just lift our hands and open our hearts it's not just for our just a show but father we see right here revisiting these things coming through these pathways we see Lord God just as what was pointed out many times our whole trouble not in every case but many of these cases the trouble was the makeup you never stripped away the makeup you never did you never said I'm gonna change that makeup that outer conscience that outer birth path no but you help us to see how Satan would be coming to work and use things right in our own body our own nature would turn it and use it against us nor truly your word is sharper than any two-edged sword hid divides asunder what God from the bone and the Morrow Lord God how do we thank you this morning Lord I pray Lord Jesus as you are that balm in Gilead father you know every need in every situation Lord is even here in the last moments a spoken wounds Lord God

children maybe the Lord one sitting here this morning or standing Lord that just feels like I don't think I ever be the same but Lord God may they Lord God release that thought under under the love of God may they look at things Lord God and recognized the Lord has you laid it out in the scripture where you can take a vineyard as they were in the book of joy a vineyard that was so believed that there was no juice from grapes to bring as a drink offering there was nothing of the field to bring as a need offering Lord but you said I will restore father under the authority of your word we cast our cares upon you Lord for you care for us Lord God father you are Lord God how healer you said I'm the Lord that healeth all thy diseases Lord Jesus we cast our cares upon you Lord God and Father
