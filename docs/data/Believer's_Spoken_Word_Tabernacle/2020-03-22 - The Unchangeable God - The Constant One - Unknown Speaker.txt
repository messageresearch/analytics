is our desire lord have your way holy spirit fill our hearts and have your way oh and has we way and as we pray speak your word into our hearts and have you hallelujah Amen that's truly our desire and we certainly desire that the Lord would have his way in our lives and we just so thankful for his mercy so thankful that God even in the midst of the time that we're in that God has afforded a way in a measure that we are able to be able to still gather around the word of the Lord and we believe that even in times like this we don't we know for sure that God he manifests himself even even so real in these times and so I just want to just admonish you those that are are gathered as you're gathered there at home just to admonish you that let your home be a place that the Holy Spirit we're in that the Lord is welcome but even in this time here just to say Lord you're still God that you would come and minister to our knees our lives right here and just let it be a time where we just let the Lord just come and speak to our hearts we we realized that in the time that we are we are living in we I think God for the opportunity that we have we have had even had pastors different ones that had contacted me towards the latter part of the week and things and I you know some that they're trying to come up with means and order ways to try to meet with their congregations and different things that I could do to try to help them make them aware of certain things but I want to say that I think God that he's provided for us that we can do that and we can still have service and gather around the word of the Lord it's not the ideal situation as far as where we're at home instead of being here but yet within these times remember God is still God and so I want to just say this morning thank you mom during this time I want to just to encourage you there are needs like you heard mentioned in the prayer requests and we want to continue to hold one another up in in prayer remembering brother herb just been trying to get in contact here with sister Rita once again we want to remember brother herb in prayer God would just continue to strengthen him also brother Mark as he's coming through his recovery and we want to just continue to hold them up in prayer there's many different needs that are among us and I want to say this if the greatest thing that we can do even and we find during this time we need one another we're not able together here right now and as far as we really feel in our hearts just to comply with what they are asking us we have a it's not it's also the protection thinking of the people that are gathered here and we need one another during this time and I really want to admonish you those of you there out there you're listening stay in contact with one another and let me just be very clear don't just stay in contact with the three or four or five people that you normally stay in contact with do that and more be let us be purposeful and in this time checking on one another calling one another and and following up and not just during this time this would be a good thing that would bring about a good change that would be a good change to where we get out of certain things that we need to be changed where we need to be able into that place and so and just to do that too just to contact one another you know calling one another sending a text to one another during this time it's very important during this time and just to remind you in the scripture the Bible says that he that showeth himself friendly has friends so if you're waiting on somebody to contact you maybe gods wanting you to fulfill that part in the scripture that you would show yourself friendly so we want to fulfill the word we want to be we see it in the early church when situations arose they they would they would really come together and so would that's exactly where our hearts are we want to be able to reach out and stay in contact with one another throughout these times also to mention this is mainly for the young young people I'm going to be sending out an email for those that gather there on the the fridays there at our home i'm going to be sending an email there's a there is a an app in a way that we can actually have our youth meeting but we'll have it over online so we can see one another and i can get a chance to interact with you online and and so it's not idea we won't ideal we won't get to eat the snacks and things but and and our pizza but maybe i'll eat a piece in front of you over the inner internet but we just we want to be able to do that and so i'll be reaching out to you tomorrow and i'll just need the email of what i can use in order to get that visual communication so we can go ahead with our youth meeting throughout this time i think that's pretty much it that i wanted to mention you know with with you as an assembly we're trying to do all we can to comply with what they've asked they've said 215 days and we we're just looking at that right now we want i want to admonish you to keep everything in prayer keep those in prayer that our leaders keep those in prayer because the decisions that they have to make are not easy decisions and they're trying to do things all these decisions are being made are being our decisions that are being made for the benefit and to and to benefit the citizens of our country our state and city and I I don't know if some of you had the opportunity if you have it yesterday I I thought it was very interesting you you here where it is mentioned about the Spanish flu that came in among 1918 and there was a real interesting document from the city of Cleveland where it was commissioned and what took place during that time they closed down everything they would there was no of course back then there was no such option as streaming a service and so they closed where I was when I was bullying number one of this whole sheet and I thought it was a very interesting article that was wrote there by our local stations here in their news clip and I just read it and you know we're living in a time where with a world it's a time of uncertainty and uncertainty no matter in what it is it always comes with an opportunity where fear can step in and we all face uncertainty at times in our lives there's things sometimes that if you we start to think ahead too far then we venture into territory that does not belong to us it belongs to God remember we only take the land as we come to it so this is exactly where we we want to just rest in the Lord and just wait on the Lord and you know just just look into to him in this time and just trusting him for leadership and guidance within it all so if you know if you need to reach me during this time you can reach me as though at any other time it's you know about text or what have you but I think it's a time that there's so many things that we have already been looking at and examining within the Word of God and you know it's a time to be sure it's it's a time to be sure it's a time to evaluate it's a time to check up it's a time to look and it's a time that our expectation should not be in in the manner of that well this this is going to be done away with but our expectations should be on the Lord because remember you know these are let me just say it like this if I can say it in this manner these things that we are seeing just as there are preambles of the Constitution of our of our united states these plagues are preambles of the tribulation these things are our preambles of what and this was very minor to what the things will be it's very very minor the Scriptures speak of these these things in in the Book of Revelations and perhaps we would be able to move within some of those parts but we know where we are standing in this hour and that is what that is something that we take a great comfort from so I want to look in the word of the Lord upon something here that God has so just the other day in the office we were we were praying and my wife and I were praying together for some different needs and the Holy Spirit just spoke to my heart right there in prayer and it just these things just begin to just begin to move out of through my heart and I want to read in the scripture in job 23 3 it's just one scripture that I want to read but it says like this job says all that I knew where I might find him that I might come even to his seat Amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word I I think of this approach it's a great desire that an individual or a person would have in that they might find him and I I think the expression to which that you know job would right here he wants jobs in the midst of a situation in his life and we find ourselves in times in the midst of many different situations that they change and even with a life and a heart that is seeking after God seeking for answers seeking for the emptiness that is there and we could try to you know if I could say it like this the this Satan has nothing but empty promises his promises they hold no satisfaction they it only becomes something that is temporary and the Bible would say that that that pleasure is but for a season no matter how many duration of years that a person would have but it's only for that of a season James would call it that our life is but a vapor and Jobe noticed this longing you know there's a longing within job's heart that I might come even to his seat where he is abiding where he's dwelling where he is at and to think of this that there is a call there's a hunger even from the very beginning when when man fell away from the Word of God there was a hunger and a desire to get back in to that of life there was a hunger and God knowing that that desire would be there knowing that his children would have a longing to get back to life and the reality is that everything that we find within around us it is people that are individuals that are thirsting for life and everyone that I'm talking to on the internet from the assembly the few that are here you realize that we all were in that place we were seeking for things that nothing could satisfy but God in His mercy we couldn't find where he was at we could not find that but remember when the fall come he put there a cherubim with a flaming sword and the sword is the word of the Lord and that sword was in order to keep the way under the tree of life knowing that God himself there's no way that man could get to God but God would come to man God would come dan sinned and God would come into a place to where he would be able to bring about and restore a communion with man in the very heart of man and bring man into a place where man would have access into his seat into his throne because to think of it when God Himself now is received in his seat in his throne this is where his power his authority and to recognize that job there was a desire there was a calling for that which that there would be that of one who would manifest his authority manifest his power in his life and that's exactly what the earth is groaning for right now now when I look at this scripture I think of another scripture here because wherever that God has been found he still can be found he's the same yesterday today and forever he might change his mask but he never changes his nature hey man it's just like you know I can look in some of you that are streaming whoever you are whether has life as evolved when you were as a son or a daughter of your earthly parents it evolves then you become that of a whether you know a spouse whether it be husband or it be wife then from there evolves you become father or a mother then from there it evolves you become a grandfather or grandmother you're not multiple persons you are the same person we being revealed in many different masks or offices or attributes that are already within you and that's the same way with God all of these or with in God and God was manifested through every one of these attributes and the comfort within it all among his children is that through it all he still remains the same so we find how God will reveal himself to be the same to every generation in the book of Malachi chapter 3 verse 6 it says for I am the Lord I change not therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed thank God that he is the unchangeable one and that's what I want to deal with here this morning just to take a little bit of time with it on the unchangeable God and the real part of the thought that pulsates in my heart is the constant one anything that's constant cannot change it can't change it remains the same it cannot be altered it's not modified it's not reformed if it can be in any way then it has been changed it's it's been lessened been reduced from what it is and this is why the word would speak to you and I that he who would take away in the book of Revelation whoever takes away from the word or adds to it his part shall be taken away we're living and I think we all are in agreeance of this we are living in a changing time and I'll tell you within the past the past well really the past couple months from you know even when these things were already identified over there in China and I even though that really the first case was identified here in the states I think it was you know January 21st but in reality you know we look at their testing more and more and we know there's gonna be more cases that would come about because how many were already here before they identified the first one the more testing you do the more you're going to find so the you know the things that that are present even where things have changed so quickly and no island doubtedly you know I would say this right this you know in this in this regards as believers this too shall pass do we God God is seeing us through this the midst of this time the changing within it though there are things that we what we don't know is out of all of this what things we'll go back to the way they were and then what things are changed from here on out we don't know that neither is it for us to be given or concerned with that one thing about it is that when we look at this and keeping the thought in our hearts as we speak this morning on the unchangeable God and the constant one we know that there are things that perhaps that will be changed that will be changed for the better there can be things that will come about that would be you know perhaps change for the better then there's going to be things that where we will have to modify in our lives and certain things that maybe that we once were able to do maybe certain hours where we were able to go to different places certain things no doubt will change and I think you know of there's some things that I you know kind of look at this that even with the change and things like this through even this time that we're together here there's some things that I've got to look at and thought well it's brought me even to a place to realize that even if it God Terry's next year and snow or ice hit the ground then we might have to cancel people coming here but I can still deliver the word of the Lord for that service so there's things that were we're looking at and through it all we want to we just want to keep our eyes on the Lord because God is guiding us through this time we are truly living in that time everything is changing and if we just kind of maybe digress from this situation and step back and just to look before even this situation of that you know the the coronavirus before all of that you already identified that there are changes that take place all around us you know you come into certain neighborhoods and I don't know maybe if any of you drive back in certain places where you were raised places you grew up you see sometimes the house ain't even there sometimes you see that Street has been altered maybe they've changed they've rerouted I know even the the city where the school where I graduated from they completely altered a street altogether in order to make way for a parking garage at a hospital it completely changed the way that that route was through there there are changes that come about and everything itself is is so different cities change there's changes even when we look at it in our local city here of of Lorraine hey the way that you used to go down Broadway Avenue that's changing there's changes that's come about and change as you know man is always looking at things and to change it we find the changes of businesses clothes we find things if I can speak so even you know of the young ones see it as well there's certain things that close that of businesses and things like malls and and places that once we're a very busy metropolis or busy area now it becomes like a ghost town and we find we find things they change things change all around us sometimes there's even things that you change on the inside of your house there's things maybe colors you change and you know this is now the new color this is now the the new thing there's things that's constantly changing year after year politics change nations are changing we've watched we've witnessed here within the past years and I think about you know specifically over the period of time that our from our from our oldest son Paul who's 19 soon to be 20 I think about during the period of time over their lives and even when the very day that that that Benjamin was being born at the very day the very the very time I was looking at on a screen there in the hospital when they were taking down the very statue of Saddam Hussein day and in many things we see that what happened in that area it changed the landscape it changed the powers that changed things that were there things are changing we even recognize God already spoke by his word all in the scriptures from the old into the new that there would be a reviving even of the old Roman Empire its borders would come back that's why even when we look at the middle wall of between East Germany and West Germany that wall had to come down we see even the borders even where that old Roman Empire its borders its boundaries and being coming back into that into that place but also just as much as that is coming back into its place the real bride of Jesus Christ the believer God has laid landmarks down in his word by his presence that were man now Satan has wanted to encroach and move those landmarks and bring changes to where things no longer no longer is calling allowed to be the same God and we find that but God made a promise that I will give you back your land I will give you back your borders and that which belongs to you and as a matter of fact we are standing here like the widow under the ministry of Elijah and we recognize hey our land has been taken but God has appointed an officer to be able to execute but keep the king's command to bring back the borders and the that belonged to us this land I'm talking about is the genuine land of the real baptism of the Holy Ghost a man and that officer that has been important then that hasn't come about to execute the commandment of the king of the war is the Holy Spirit himself so we are resting in the midst of all of this and change here and change there but yet to know that the Holy Spirit is present to execute every word that he has promised every boundary every part is given to us in Christ Jesus I think about you know I've not been back to where where my momma you know grew up I haven't been back down in that area my brother has drove around down there around in the Blair and Logan areas but I've heard tell of it and I have you know you drive in certain times where places you know what we called hollers and I know some of you don't know what a holler is and that ain't just callin people to dinner either it's an actual place where he driving up between the mountains but the things where people come in through mining and strip mining they had a it's unbelievable I did see when I was 18 years old when they started to move into that area and my aunt Barbara would point out she pointed out some of the big equipment that was up there on the hill around Sharples I look back into those into those times I couldn't I didn't know machinery there it was machinery that big I don't even know how they got it up there but it has so changed it's longer mountains it's just one big leveled place because why because man has sought to to extract something from the earth and man has brought about a change it's changed it's it's no longer the same they told me they said you wouldn't even recognize that I've tried to you know look at different videos or people driving up through there and and you know you try to find landmarks and really the landmarks themselves as far as with schools here and there those things are removed there are certain things that could be pointed out of certain houses but my point is is that change scenery changes look the weather changes I mean you know everybody makes a statement and they say well you know stick around in Ohio it'll change every state says that I hate to disappoint the Ohioans and think we got a cliche on something you don't everywhere you go when I've been in this state or I've been in this country everybody says the same thing because why I don't care what they talk about with whether we know climate is more of the predictability weather is what can change from day to day but you recognize that even among those things things change people change the reality of it is right now is that even you know for somebody to know if their neighbor died somebody have to tell them or they read it in the paper it used to be there were people where neighbors used to be where people were friendly people change people go in you know even even they go in I never forget we were in a place with the family and my boys remember this they got a guy that stands in the middle of McDonald's and he just gets all upset because he didn't have his food with in under three minutes and then he wants to start and you know just ripping off swear words in the midst of a lunch hour you know maybe he took the lid to term fast food a little bit too literal but the reality of people changing people's under such a pressure in this hour they're in such a hurry we're used to be you know you would find where people would would would take time and rest they would they would take a time to be able to rest instead people are constantly in a hurry and you know I think of how you know even one brother when I was speaking with him here some months ago he works over in one of the Ford plants where he has to travel for 80 huh and I heard what he was saying I know the people jump for 80 it's 60 miles per hour but you'd have to tell them that you'd have to almost stick it on the windshield they don't want to go 60 miles per hour and if you're only going 60 miles per hour they're ready to run you over and they wonder what's wrong with you people are changing we've seen that taking place we've seen the loss of of motherhood fatherhood and everything else people are not there covenant the Bible said they'd be truce beta breakers and lovers of themselves we see that but the word is identified these changes would come about the wired has identified it the Bible tells us in the book of Daniel when it speaks of that of the working of that spirit in the Antichrist we when the Antichrist working it speaks of even that fourth beast that fourth kingdom and it speaks of how that that little horn that one of the Antichrist he would seek to change times and laws and we see that taking place modifications and things and that's been going on so within this here's what I want to I focus to be on all of that is changing the world is changing because the world it is to pass away but there is one who remains constant there is one who has never changed for I am the Lord and I change not circumstances change but God don't change the same way that God acted in the first time when he ever saved a man he'll act the same the first time they ever healed a man when those same grounds are met God will heal him once again he's a God of his word he's committed to his word you see the very thing that we are are looking at here if there's one thing that you and I can have a confidence in and can have a faith in that's in the Word of God when we get when we get our confidence in anything outside of the Word of God then that's where we're disappointed and let me just say it like this sometimes we can get our confidence in our thoughts concerning the Word of God and then we're disappointed come on how the Bible said in the book you know in the book of Matthew blessed to see that's not offended in me John the Baptist was offended because things weren't happening the way he thought in on a hat yet what he spoke was exactly the word of the Lord but God came down notice of the Lord Jesus he see called the disciples he said come here for a minute he said I want you just to stay right here you know he could have told John he could have sent him back and he could have said don't tell John don't worry don't tell John it'll be all right that wasn't gonna help John John needed something that he could take a hold off so Jesus said just sit down here and I want you to witness what is taking place in this meeting where the sick are healed where the devil's are cast out where lives are being changed you know what it was he knew that John was anchored to that of the Living cloth and all John had to do is hear a report of the Living cloth and it would anchor John and remove the film from off of his eagle eyes it would give him strength in the midst of that time of prison there was a different situation but God knows how to speak to his children and let him know till the unchangeable God at steal the constant one it's to build our faith in the word of the Lord this is why the ministering of the word this is like God send his message in this linda's in in the end time it is the promise of his work to do on restore back Bible faith it never took us out of the Bible but to restore back to Bible faith there's things that we're you know churches they get together in their councils and they come together and going to decide what's what's right and what's wrong God never left it to a group of man to decide what's right and what's wrong is that right the council that ought to be called is the same Council that was called in acts two that the power of the Holy Ghost would come down and feel those lives because God never intended man to pack the gospel God talks the gospel in man that's the kind of council that needs to be called because out of those councils they make certain you know things for a room for now women can cut the hair and now women can wear this and now we can't allow homosexuals in the church who decided all that stuff it ain't God bringing the decision if God alters one word then everything else is out David said thy rod and thy staff they comfort me he's either the same or he isn't the same man learns better sure there's things in the medical books right now like really what killed George Washington there one the bullet what killed him because of the method of bleeding them out there's methods where they used to thank God they don't have that no more but you got an infection we're gonna heal the infection we're going to bleed you out but our medical science right now doctors would look back on that day no in the world they'd let somebody stand around for that right now man is always advancing but God don't ever change and God don't need the counsel of men there were there were 400 prophets that came up there with a lying spirit but God had one and Jehoshaphat said isn't there one it was a lying spirit that came upon them but Michael could stand there and what did Michael say though the situation's change and though you can quote to me a promise out of the word and say God gave us the land of ramoth-gilead but he was standing on the word and knew God had pronounced judgment on the house of Ahab for their disobedience what was he doing Michael was standing with the constant one the unchangeable God and with Zedekiah said which way with the Spirit of God when he went out of me and Micah said you'll find out when you return back and are in your inner presence the Word of God is shallow that wasn't that wasn't Elijah's thinking but it was the word of the Lord spoken through the mouthpiece his servant Elijah in that hour by what the constant one I never forget we were out on vacation and we were in a certain place that was um this was some time back we were in a certain place that was kind of close to where my aunt Barbara and uncle Glen where they live and we saw a person in the restaurant there and you know it would have been a place that they would have been they matter of fact they went there to that place multiple times over there in Pennsylvania and how we were looking at it and not goodness we thought through we got to look the hair everything from behind I mean it looked exactly like man Barbara so you know there's a part of it we got a little excited we thought maybe they're here we just don't know about it so we got up there and five you know we're moving around and looking at things in the store not that we're interested in buying we're trying to find out is that her because you just don't want adrenals sneak up behind somebody and say hey and Barbara and they turn around and think one of the world's just crazy person doing here you wonder see who it was before you called their name and maybe just tell you something God will always reveal himself to be the same that's the only thing that you and I can have in life that is tangible we don't need more literature we need the presence of the Living God because it is that which Jacob when he was in his wonderings Jacob was wondering what's going on what's taking place but drawn met him there Jacob had something he could put his hand on and when he put his hand on it that same God changed him let me tell you something he changed him and it can never ever ever ever go back to being the same Jacob again that's the kind of change God makes God brings you and I into his constancy it's a constant life abiding in the Holies of Holies it's something that you can take ahold of don't turn him loose remember remember Jacob it wasn't God hold on it Jacob you know and God wrestle and Jacob that's not how God works God don't wrestle none of his children down God don't make none of his children serve Him because he puts him in a headlock and and puts him in a place of why cement or I submit no God moves by His divine love to wear something the goodness of God wouldn't move in our live into a place and say Lord I know that thou art the same and true and living and all I want you to change me it becomes that desperation that moves in the heart of an individual to know that there is one that is present that I have my hands all can deliver me and bring a change in my life is to build faith in the word I don't have nothing against Christian bookstores and all these other things and so forth but I'll tell your friends I think a lot of it has its we see people have substituted a real genuine acts to experience with theology a man in order for the same reality to be reproduced it takes the same Living God when one of his words has changed he no longer remains the same that's why people go on preaching experience and listen to me they go on that's why they preach it they preach experiences for the new birth instead of finding that the experience must be founded in the word and it is not something of changing from year to year and month to month when God brings a change in a man it's constant that man might have certain feelings he goes through different tests and trials but there's a constant God that lives in him and he is living and abiding in the presence of the same one who brought Aaron's rod into blossoming fruit producing and bearing to mature maturity you see this is where is to instill faith in the Word of God this is why this is why the presence of God we just don't need word we need the presence of the Living God and they just tell you son the Holy Ghost is the Word of God because the Word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart it has with the power to bring change whatever decision God if God met a man first and the first thing that God asked is have faith the Bible is very clear we must have faith is that right is to have faith in God let me just say to you like this you used to have faith in God and God is no greater than his word he's no more perfect than his word because God and his word is the self same thing I love this scripture it's a portion in the world that it's just been on meditation on my heart for months and just really moving right down even in these times it's a scripture that even will it moves over into the coming of the Lord and even to that a millennium and so forth but this scripture is something I really enjoy in Psalms 138 verse 1 I will praise thee with my whole heart before the gods ye are gods come on the scripture said Ye are gods right and God is the god of the universe Adam was made to be lowercase G God of the earth is that right the Bible said he had put all things in Dominion under his family is that right this is why the earth is rude groaning and longing for the manifestation of the sons of God because there is that reality that yearns within the earth just as it did in Joel just as it did in US and even now we crawl on within ourselves to be delivered there is a desire in the earth for the earth to come back under the Dominion of the sons and daughters of God this is why the earthquakes in diverse places this is why the nervous frustrations of the earth and all these things laugh because there is a kingdom that is being ushered in hallelujah before the gods well I sing praise unto thee I will worship toward that holy temple and praise thy name for the loving-kindness without truth I love this for thou has magnified thy word above thy name now we realize that a man's name you know somebody can have a real bad name because of their character their character becomes that of their actions what they do or what they don't do like somebody can say tell them if you're going to start Church at 11:00 telling church starts at 10:00 so they're here on time you know say I'm saying you can feel you can see different things right but now when we look at this here here that as David as a witness Dallas magnified that word above my name see God remember his name is revealed his name is his person is his character is who he is it is revealed in his word he reveals it he's not trying to make a reputation for himself and go off out here and give a bunch of loose words you know God's not a politician he don't make a lot of empty promises and then say oh hell you know I got under heat and Method and I've got to try to keep this together know every promise that God made he fulfills it he has magnified his word above his name because with his word being fulfilled that's what makes his name great amen and that's why the Bible could even say in the Book of Revelations of 19 when he comes riding back with the armies of heaven when we're get rid from the West wedding supper and he comes down to make that of war there in that valley of Megiddo there in Armageddon remember the Bible said that he had a name written on his vesture and in the Bible said his name is called the Word of God his name isn't the word of God but it's called the Word of God when his name is made manifest Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today forever that is the way amen that's magnified by word above thy name man is only as good as his word is that right so God is unchangeable he meets man on the same grounds that he did before human them same grounds when man gets almost same grounds God will manifest himself to be the same Amen so the only way to declare it is God is unchangeable I think of it you know my heart would break what good would it do for a person to go to seminary or any place like this and read about the Word of God no the Word of God and then to have somebody standing in the pulpit or to have those people there and say well God no longer does that or God used to do this back there that that is absolutely contrary to the word because what God did before he still the same God the smarted man has changed but God has never changed and that's why we're thankful because if he changed then we would be consumed but remember God can't change and he is the word for I am the Lord and I changed that therefore these sons of Jacob you are not consumed God is focused upon his word God rest in his word as a matter of fact Milliband would say like this God in the beginning spoke his word and step back and believe it remember it's the same God inside of you and me the Spirit of Truth it's the same the same Jesus is that right because when Paul met him on the road to Damascus remember he saw that pillar fire he knew this was God visiting his people and when God visits his people like that it's to lead them out of unbelief into faith and he asked him who are you lord and what did he do he revealed to him I am Jesus whom my persecutors the corporal body had already ascended on the throne holy ghost the same God that lived in that body that he created now that same life of God that same Holy Ghost if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you he was dwelling in his church in that hour Amen though the corporal body Jesus was on the throne that same one on the inside that had come down and took upon a human name for redemption he was standing there he was veiled in the midst of his church and that's why the scripture text you and I know in the Book of Revelations when John sees him revealed he is revealed as Alpha and Omega I am the beginning and the end though men would want to alter me but I am still the same the way that I started my church I will finish it the same God that came down on the day of Pentecost is the same God right here with you and I walking in the midst of the candlesticks David declares in Psalms Paul picks it up in Hebrews he's declaring the victory in the midst of his brethren I will sing in the midst of my brethren this is why the scripture building faith building faith in the Word of God this is why it says without faith it's impossible to please him he that cometh to God must believe that he is I'm a firm believer nobody nobody should come to an altar because their buddy comes to an altar because their friend comes to an altar come on I've seen that they come under pressure and under this and I want to do it because of this and do it because of that there's certain parts or we look at things and say well that would be good to emulate but it takes more than you emulating somebody else it takes where you become identified or introduced with that that same God he living God you first got to know that he's a living God let me just say it whether you're here or whether you're out there on the internet if you don't know him to be a living God one that you can put your hands on tangible all you have to do is ask God Lord make yourself known as the Living God the same God that part of the Red Sea the same God that turned the water into wine make yourself known the same God who changed Jacob and delivered from within him the Prince that was hidden your first is to ask God reveal yourself and once he does that then here's the next part and that he's a reward it ain't just good enough to know well I know this is truth I know the Living God is among us I know God is around us I know our brother Samuel administering I know this message is the truth all of those are wonderful those are wonderful things but remember it's for you to take ahold of and let the same god of this message that he delivered him change you you must believe he is a rewarder one who releases the spoil one who releases there of the riches of his glory the riches of his spirit the riches of his life his nature you must believe that he is a rewarder he's not an Indian giver it's church teaching that is cost people confusion that's what I would hope you feel it oh my if you feel it or if you spoke in tongues or if you did this and you're fine with people in and out and up and down and here they are living back out in the war you want to know why it wasn't that there was an anointing didn't come on their life there was a genuine anointing of the Holy Ghost that came on their life but remember the Bible said the rain it falls on the just and unjust the Sun that shines on the weep it shines on the weed it's not saying you're but it's Sam left the rain and let the light go into the depths of your soul then it is no longer you then liver but its Christ liveth in you it becomes then a constant by the unchanging God living out his word the reality is the accountability comes I just say a personal here I'm just speaking to the church that God has called me to pastor there's not one without an excuse in this assembly that God don't move among us there's not one that could sit here in this assembly and say well I ain't felt the premise of God i han't felt the power of God I ain't seen the power of God there's not one can say that then wrong what we what do we do with that it's to take a hold of that Living God because he's the one that comes he's the one that brings his word to pass you see when it's left up to the imagination of man man wants to fabricate it like this this is why we have that we have the situation's of where that we have that people look at and say well you know if I just confess the Lord I'm saved there's a beginning but you got to keep going amen there's the promise the promise is of redemption and Men we think God for salvation but it's gotta go deeper he's a sanctified he cleans out all dirty filthy habits he sanctifies that life he moves in to bring a cleansing and a sanctified by his power that then he himself comes down on the inside and let me just say it like this when God gets ahold of the life remember God don't as I said before God don't drag that in life and say yeah I'm gonna put you in a headlock neither does God put people in a headlock and say alright I'm gonna clean you up I'm gonna sanctify you God don't work that way what has to happen is is remember a further work of the grace of God it has to come a determination on your heart that Lord I want nothing in me that is unlike you and that never stops Lord I want nothing that would hinder you from coming in me if I've got desires in my life that are not right Lord I want to just give myself to you a determination of the Spirit of God moving upon that life Lord lead me to deeper depths in you sometimes God God the hill he'll do things every time God fulfills his word it's every time he fulfills it it is never how man has figured it out see God don't want you to view it God God's not in it for you and how to figure it out that's not what remember where God's confidence is is when he makes himself known among his children his children will recognize him well I feel good Gideon's standing there that day and remember in the book of Gideon in the book of Judges sorry a prophet had come first thing God sent a prophet why people get away from the word they get away from it and they get drifting out here what does a prophet sent forth to call you back into the word I'm talking about a true ordained prophet it's to call you back into the word of Almighty God it delivers from the counsels of men and men's ideas which hold no power that prophet came and let him know where you drifted from you're living a life of defeat Midianites keep coming in as grasshoppers and lighting you out and he's cold what do you know he's calling them back - he didn't come there - you know the bathe a.m. and say oh this is a terrible situation and oh in this horrible and you know what we just need to start a separate group here in the church in Israel we need to start a group among the harvesters and you know let's all just hold hands and sing Kumbaya and weep because we're defeated knows that the reason Israel was defeated there is because they live out on the word hey man when they let when their word is raised back up in power how do you then Satan don't stand a chance hey man he's still Jehovah Nissi a man when and when Moses was on the mountain and Joshua was down there fighting the battle Aaron and her were up in there and what were they to do hold up the hands of Moses and when his hands they'd seen the hands growing weary amen they put that put two rocks right there he's the same in the Old Testament as in the new he is the breach that breaches him together he ties it all together that is Jesus Christ same yesterday today and forever the power the same car that was there is the same power and called that is here now this hands are steel exalted and the revelation that has come to you and I in this Hauer this one with his hands up he swears by him that liveth forever and ever what is it the effect of calais what cavalry was initiating Redemption this is the gathering together I'm talking about the constant one here who was Gideon the Prophet came and went but the one that's sinning didn't leave the one that gave the prophet his message he came in the message and he came right up to her Gideon was the message was broadcast to all but it's going to find who it's intended for you see that message is going to build courage it's call it it's gonna answer the longing that's in the heart of the individual for the constant one where is that same God Gideon asks a question here is he's talking notice he doesn't perceive him as anybody anything oh I wonder who this is this wasn't Christian bookstore theology he didn't have he didn't have you know a certain aura or a certain light about him it wasn't that at all but this here was the angel of the Lord was present here he loves taken upon a veil and a form that Gideon would know as a man he wasn't startled but the man began to speak to him and speak to the depths that lay within his life he was uncovering to Gideon a mystery that laid within him that Gideon himself could not see but you see what the word comes to do it comes to inspire courage and the only way that courage comes from about in our life is for God to reveal himself as the unchangeable God and Gideon said if God be with Hassan then where P all the miracles we've heard what he did when he part of the let's see how he opened the Jordan why is that same God for this Hauer where's the constant one where's the unchangeable God promise after promise I'm just going to come down here and close promise after promise in the Word of God such rich and precious promises of how God he gave witnesses all the way down of the of the keeping of his word manifesting his word and even how God it would be expressed in the word of the Lord how David would express it the testimony of the Lord is sure Amen Solomon would write every word of God is pure I say it would ride on I was a a48 the grass wither at the flower of fate is but the word of our God shall stand forever Titus 1:7 speaks of that hope of eternal life where Paul was resting which God that cannot lie notice it notice where he's drawing the attention for God which cannot lie the Bible said that every man's word be a lot but let God's Word be true let me tell you God backs up his word Amen that God cannot lie he promised before the world began look at look at look look look this word is sure before there was Adam Stardust or molecule before there was even the dividing of the atoms the multiplying of the molecules before there was anything there was Elohim there was God existing with his thoughts in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the constant the earth was being changed the earth was coming into manifestation but as the earth would come into a manifestation we see where the enemy would come in and bring an encroachment in Eden he would lead notice God gave His Word in Eden God can't change his word he said the day you eat thereof the day you die God had to stand by his word but God made a promise he said to that of the woman I will give you a seed you see in order to bring this back it's got to be God giving a seed because in order to bring this back remember Jesus said I am coming my father's name right he had magnified his word above his name remember here it is in order to release that light because remember what does the Sun do a Sun is an error he's one that carries on the lineage and the name of the Father and Jesus has come in the volume of the book what was it an air it had to be unto us a son is given why it had to be that of a son it had to be were God would create a body a tabernacle that he could step down and pay the price of redemption and now through that clear the lien and the debt that was against you and I that that same life might be released back to you and I as sons and daughters we were under the darkness and the blackness of sin it was in Genesis 1 but God said let there be light and his light is his well made manifest [Applause] hallelujah hey man that same life now that's why the family of God is called by one the name of Jesus Christ hey man it has released the family name to whom it has released the family name to those who have the genes of his loins remember he that is L must come from the loins come on now Abraham said Eleazar shake he could be my hair tossing me but he that comes from your loins what was God declaring my ears my children they will come from my loins they will come from the loins of my mind of my word blessed be the name of the Lord think of it here's a scripture in the Book of Revelations to our church age an age where the Holy Spirit dealing with the church the church they stand here he stands and knocks at the door but he's been put out but yet they're still preaching this shows that the Lord is not the letter the word is the person to have the letters not enough that's why there has to be programs and people we have to get together and make promises man can keep a promise but God keeps every promise he's a constant one unto the angel of the church of the lady of seein's write these things saith the Amen which is the so be it the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God he is the author this is why the Scriptures I'm closing I'm just going to close here heaven and earth jesus said will pass away but my words shall not pass away let me just say it like this as work as I'm closing just skipping some different things here to have a constant is to have an absolute it's to have something that doesn't change it's an absolute is something that you can always come back to and base everything else off of help me preach out there in your homes that's why you've got to meet God on the sacred sands of grace you got to have an absolute that you know you've met God then no matter what comes your way sometimes you can feel like you're not saying but you've got an absolute to come back to you've got a constant you can come back to just say I know that I met God and the love of the world is past for my life I no longer love the world but God has become everything to me you've got an absolute you've got a constant that you can check everything by let me just put it clear like this you've got a thinking man's filter it is a constant and in that filter it will not allow the world it's constant it's an absolute David would call the constant in his life the absolute in his life he would say he's my rock when he said I get overwhelmed lead me to the rock that's hotter than hot he nearly had a constant pace lead me there it's higher than I these problems and I'm seeing what's going on around me there's a rock that's higher than I need me there Lord that's why David would say in psalm 62:5 my soul wait thou only on God for my expectation is from him he only he only this is from Shalom he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be moved in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god david knew him as the constant one the unchangeable god he didn't matter the obstacle sometimes the obstacles look different lines don't look like bears bears don't look like Giants hello somebody tests and trials that come our way they had come in many different ways and appearances as I write things that we are faced with all of that is things that change around us but like David David looked at Goliath and he knew this is different but the same God is with me David knew he's the same God the constant one the unchangeable God but just saying like this he doesn't matter what comes along and what goes we're in the midst of a time right now that of the changing all this as a whole around us we see all that change and look people are in their homes and all these things we see things that were that's had to be change they've asked us to comply we see a lot of things that's changed there's some right now that I'm speaking to a part of this assembly has went through some major surgeries there's been some major things that have happened here among us within the assembly things that we've been through and God has brought us through things have changed I've watched how things have changed over the years but let me just say this to you one that remains constant is that God is still God [Applause] he doesn't change sometimes we feel we look at the situation and say I never faced nothing like this before but the same God that was with you in the previous trial is the same God with you in this trial the same God that was with you there is the same God that's with you here because he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you and when we can entertain that thought it relieves us from the covetous spirit for I can boldly say the Lord is my helper David believed that God was the constant one David would even make the request in Psalm 63 verse 1 o God thou art my god early will I seek thee my soul thirsty for be my flesh longer for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see that power and that glory so as I have seen it in the sanctuary you know what David was calling here he knew what I've seen you to be in the sanctuary your power and your glory I may not be in the sanctuary right now I'm in a place of a dry and thirsty land it's like darkness is all around below along in to see your power and your glory right here in this time because you're the constant one the unchangeable God let me just say it like this if you don't know him to be the constant one inside of you then let him dear friends life something you know what if people get tired people get tired well I've tried this and I'm up and I'm down and I'm up listen when that's mentioned about being up and down it's not putting anybody down it's trying to let you know there's a place you can come to where it becomes constant in your life oh you go through tests and tryout sure is the world you'll go through you go through time but there was different is you've got a friend that sticketh closer than a brother you got one who is abiding with you constantly you got wonder whether you fill him enough you got to promise no I am with you always has he told Joshua whithersoever thou goest and there with you I'm the constant one not Jericho is different from me but I'm the same God no matter if it's caracal no matter if it's a as he told them in the Bible when there was an attack made on his character that he's only the god of the hills he said I will declare that I'm not just the God of the hills but I'm the God of the valleys he's God whether you're on a mountain whether you're in a valley he's the same God he's the constant one the unchangeable God he's the same yesterday today and forever let me tell you something this is where that same God he comes into the heart of an individual and he brings a constancy in that life by a constant love affair where the love of God is shed abroad in your hearts it becomes a stability oh you're not floating but you have an anchor that enters within the veil and you are held constant in him and I say to you this morning if you don't have that constant one dwelling in the midst of the chamber of your heart that can bring stability and comfort to your life that only he don't just get you through covet night Tina z-pak 20 or whatever in the world it is I'm talking about one he will see you through all the way through every test and every trial through every trap and every snare through everything the devil can throw at you he is are not constant one and there's a prevailing power that moves in your life to where when you get caught up in a little bit of weeds you got a power it's not just this humanity you got a power behind this humanity lots of power that is on a boat if a boat gets caught this power for it to overcome he's the constant one you might be sitting at home and wonder but Sammy you're still sweating as though you got a whole whole group of people there let me just say something I miss every one of you I miss you all not being here and pulling but let me tell you something you don't take numbers for me to get excited about the Lord I get excited just like this when I'm at home but I my heart's desire for everyone invite him invite him say Lord be the constant one in me become the absolute to me in my life you see it's him in your life that makes this message this revelation this word an absolute because now the Holy Spirit because otherwise there is a there is a chasm there is a breach between us and this we need one who's able to put his hands on us put on that of the word and tie the two together you see this is the mystery it takes the releasing of his life these two shall be amen don't you love him this morning oh those of you out there on the Internet don't you love him behind it gathered right there in your home one with another and and I say this as we get ready to pray right there God will come right where you're at whether you're in here in this building or whether you're out there in the living room you might be listening to this on the road or on the job let me just tell you something you let your heart be an altar you let your heart you let your life be a place where God can come in and say holy spirit you're welcome Lord come leave me don't try to figure it out let him lead you because you try to figure it out you only frustrate and disappoint yourself and it ends up being well I can't I can't and it's true we can't but we can yield remember God is not going to drag us he wants a yielded heart one that's willing to say Papa I'll put my hand in your hand you got my hand in the sleeve you put my hand in the coat because I can't get it in and right now you might be in the midst of a valley there might be things I know as many of our sisters here you are you've got the children and the things that you know some things has changed in your home homeschooling and things like that and not really exactly homeschooling but I mean there's things where there's been some modifications from things that you had to to to amend some of you on your schedule some of you in different in different ways in different settings let me just say this to you remember this he's the same God you're in the things around us there's changes but he's the constant one if there's one thing that we need that assurance of and we need to rest our hearts in right now it's in the constant one because all around us it's changing everything around this is shifting sands here we have no continuing City it's all shifting and changing but just to remember and to look at it like this even in the midst of times by the salmon these are times when you get over a limit I sure do there's times when I get overwhelmed with things because the things brothers and sisters that we're dealing with things and many times that I'm doing things I can put my hands on I've got to trust God to work it out the same way you have to trust God for our families and everything else we've got to trust God to work it out but to real the real reality within it is let's just ask God say Lord I want to draw closer to you and Lord that you would direct me through this moment because there's things that God can make known to you there's things that maybe there's some things that can come about in your life that you look at and say you know what I never thought of doing this before but you know what I realize I can do it remember God is not the author of confusion the world is running around in confusion but they're seeking this is an hour what people are seeking for leadership but you know if the leadership there wanting leadership that will calm their fears and I'm telling you everybody needs leadership we all need real godly leadership thank God that he provides leadership in the midst of a time where it's in a situation of the world of crisis but God lets us know I'm the constant one I haven't changed your life your schedules they might have changed a little bit you might be used to going up and picking a hamburger up here at a certain time and going wherever you want but that has changed but remember I've not changed and we can bring our thoughts back into that place then God can mold and shape and bring forth from our lives in this time what he's intended to bring forth I think God for His mercy for our requests that came in this morning read over me looked at it and just to know like this and how it said is that God he is faithful taken time that's like this and we're a heart could reach out and say I need God I need God I need one that'll be a constant one living on the inside of me not one who's trying here and failing here and try but there's one who's a constant in my life let's pray father Lord I know that you have spoke to us not just the Lord for those of us that are gathered here but you spoke to us as an assembly and Lord perhaps you've spoke even beyond that of which would be Lord that would come here that would look to me as their pastor being a part of this assembly under the vision that you've given here Lord but father you're still God and you know every heart Lord of life that Lord could even be on the very brink of where they don't even feel like going on father I asked right now that that same presence that's here in this building that same constant one that has come and brought the unction to deliver this word that you would move in that heart Lord move upon that life right now Lord by your grace you lord that heart and let him know let him sense that presence Lord like Jacob since that night Lord father that their hearts that their mind will be turned Lord and I pray God may there not be one Lord Lord would any longer tolerate the enemy robbing them from the privilege of being a son and daughter of God may they cast down all imagination cast down reasoning may they take a hold take a hold of you Lord say Lord I'm not going to turn loose I'm not gonna let it go until you bless me and only you can change me I can't change me and I'm tired of being Jacob I don't want to be Jacob no more I want to be free oh Jesus Renan Lauren moved down in
