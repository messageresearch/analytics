[39:51] to him in a word of prayer I'd ask you
[39:54] to um keep brother Brian holder and I
[39:57] think think that probably was mentioned
[39:59] uh in the prayer request this morning
[40:01] he's uh flying out has to fulfill a
[40:05] obligation for his job his employment
[40:07] and so they just had returned from
[40:10] Arkansas and so um not something that
[40:13] brother Brian wanted to do um but just
[40:17] ask for God will give him safe flights
[40:20] and uh be with him through the
[40:23] whole uh uh appointment that he has
[40:26] there with the business and things like
[40:28] that also ask that we would remember um
[40:32] my Uncle Bobby in prayer and I certainly
[40:34] want to say thank you for your prayers
[40:35] for him and uh I just had got um a text
[40:41] yesterday when it was here that
[40:44] um he he's
[40:47] uh you know there's been different
[40:49] complications at times when I was there
[40:51] to see him last Friday and uh he's
[40:55] there's certainly been a lot of
[40:56] improvement Within different things uh
[40:58] through his journey but they had to uh
[41:01] take him to Cleveland Clinic um they're
[41:04] the just on Friday and uh so theyve
[41:08] running different tests and uh you know
[41:10] there's things that just as I've just
[41:12] tried to be right there to encourage my
[41:13] aunt along the way to say you know it's
[41:16] a journey yes and uh you know I've stood
[41:20] there sometimes you don't know exactly
[41:22] why
[41:23] God the experiences we come through but
[41:26] I can remember as I I shared with them
[41:28] from the beginning and I've continued to
[41:29] hold to that I said when my dad could
[41:32] not even move his right side and there
[41:35] was no he couldn't speak at all there
[41:39] was no movement and you you you Elders
[41:41] you remember that that were here he
[41:43] could not move his right side at
[41:45] all and not even the framing of even
[41:48] mumbling he that that wasn't then it
[41:52] came about and so I've just I took that
[41:54] and I've just just continued to express
[41:56] to them and been right there to with
[41:58] with my uncle just to minister to him
[42:00] there at the bedside just trying to
[42:02] encourage him and and um just trying to
[42:04] minister to him with the things of the
[42:06] Lord and I can tell you they have been
[42:09] so thankful for the prayers that's right
[42:12] and they have asked me to thank you and
[42:14] my my aunt told me she said I know we
[42:17] would not be standing where we're
[42:18] standing if it was not for the
[42:22] prayers because things that have have
[42:25] we've seen I've seen things turn and you
[42:28] know we would like to see things a lot
[42:30] of times come quickly yeah we' like to
[42:32] see situations turn around quickly but
[42:35] you know the promise is they shall lay
[42:37] hands on the sick and they shall
[42:39] recoverall
[42:41] amen time is not under our control but
[42:44] faith in a God who does all things well
[42:48] in his time God knows exactly what he's
[42:51] doing and I just want to just ask you I
[42:54] told them I would bring special prayer
[42:56] because you know how it is within the
[42:58] nursing homes and things they they lower
[43:00] the bed which they should they lower
[43:02] that bed but he had rolled out of the
[43:03] bed the other day and uh you know when
[43:06] you get sores and things like that on

[47:38] amen amen God bless
[47:41] you amen I wonder if you'll turn with me
[47:44] to 2
[47:46] Corinthians chapter 12
[47:57] I trust you each of you had a
[48:03] wonderful uh time together
[48:06] or holiday
[48:10] and we certainly have we have so much to
[48:13] be thankful for and I'm grateful that
[48:16] Thanksgiving for me one of the things
[48:17] that I always uh do uh there's some good
[48:21] traditions and one thing that I always
[48:23] do is I I just like getting up real
[48:26] early that morning and listening to
[48:28] Invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus
[48:30] Christ the prophet preached that on the
[48:33] me on the Thanksgiving day and he said
[48:34] oh what a Thanksgiving message and I I
[48:36] can think about that I'm so glad that my
[48:38] old husband's
[48:40] dead I'm so glad not just divorced I'm
[48:42] glad that he's dead and I'm glad I've
[48:44] been married to Christ the word aren't
[48:46] you oh that's a lot to be thankful for
[48:50] amen uh 2 Corinthians chapter 12 and we
[48:53] want to read a few verses of scripture
[48:57] um Paul says it is not expedient for me
[49:00] doubtless to Glory I will come to
[49:03] visions and Revelations of the Lord I
[49:06] knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago
[49:10] whether in the body I cannot tell or
[49:13] whether out of the body I cannot tell
[49:15] God knoweth for such a one caught up to
[49:18] the third heaven and I knew such a man
[49:22] whether in the body or out of the body I
[49:25] cannot tell God knoweth how that he was
[49:28] caught up into paradise and heard
[49:31] unspeakable Words which is not
[49:34] lawful for a man to utter of such a one
[49:39] will I Glory yet of myself I will not
[49:43] Glory but in mine
[49:46] infirmities for though I would desire to
[49:49] Glory I shall not be a fool for I say
[49:53] the truth but now I forbear lest any man
[49:56] man should think of me above that which
[49:58] he Seth me to be or that he heareth of
[50:02] me and lest I should be exalted above
[50:05] measure through the abundance of the
[50:09] revelations there was given to me a
[50:11] thorn in the flesh the messenger of
[50:15] Satan to Buffet me lest I should be
[50:18] exalted above measure for this thing I
[50:22] besought the Lord Thrice three times
[50:25] that it might depart from from me and he
[50:28] said unto me my grace is sufficient for
[50:30] thee for my strength is made perfect in
[50:35] weakness most gladly therefore will I
[50:39] rather glory in mine
[50:42] infirmities that the power of Christ May
[50:46] rest upon me now what Paul's saying he's
[50:49] not worshipping his weaknesses or thank
[50:53] God that I'm sick but what he's saying
[50:56] is is that now I've
[50:58] realized that when this has come that
[51:02] it's a Time To Worship the Lord even in
[51:06] a greater
[51:08] measure and I say God help us this is
[51:10] what Paul he says he's he came to
[51:13] understand that that the power the Bible
[51:14] says that the power of Christ May rest
[51:17] upon me you you realize this phrase in
[51:19] the scripture the power of Christ it
[51:21] means that the tent of his presence
[51:25] would set down
[51:27] upon my
[51:28] life that's what I want don't
[51:31] you I I I want I want that Lord that
[51:34] would invite his presence in the midst
[51:37] of that time because it's actually
[51:39] something that's so divinely prescribed
[51:41] by God therefore I take pleasure in
[51:46] infirmities now watch this in
[51:50] reproaches in necessity so Paul just
[51:52] didn't limit it to what when his
[51:54] eyesight would come and go now he's
[51:55] learned to recognize I take pleasure in
[51:59] infirmities in reproaches in Necessities
[52:02] in persecutions in distresses for
[52:05] Christ's sake for when I am
[52:09] weak then am I strong amen may God bless
[52:14] you and bless the reading of the word as
[52:15] you're being
[52:21] seated I want to if the Lord will will
[52:24] help us here
[52:26] uh once again here this
[52:29] morning I'd like to speak on did you do
[52:32] number two on the big
[52:34] button
[52:36] um I'd like to speak if the Lord would
[52:39] help us here
[52:42] on sorry it that was
[52:46] me that was me it was not there we go it
[52:50] should be coming
[52:52] up I'd like to speak on overcoming
[52:55] hindrances
[52:57] and this is really uh things that we've
[53:01] many times we've we've as we've been
[53:03] looking at some of this and there's many
[53:04] parts to it some other things that the
[53:07] Lord just some weeks actually when we
[53:09] begin on this really begin to deal with
[53:11] my heart one Saturday night because when
[53:14] you I want you to think of this as as a
[53:17] message Believers and I realize that we
[53:19] may have some new ones that would be
[53:21] here but it's very fitting that Paul
[53:23] would would Place many things in the
[53:26] book not only in the writing in the
[53:28] Corinthians but also in the Galatians
[53:30] and think of how that brother Brana
[53:32] would take uh such a key message of
[53:35] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[53:37] which is really it's the seventh seal
[53:41] and he would spend he would take we
[53:43] would look at the amount of time that he
[53:45] would take he would take I just looking
[53:48] at it again yesterday he would take over
[53:50] close to 45 minutes at the beginning of
[53:53] that message and Express on the
[53:55] operation
[53:57] within the Church of the Living God of
[53:59] how that Satan would want to try to come
[54:01] against the church and try to bring
[54:03] division try to try to bring things to
[54:05] where we look at one another in a
[54:07] different way and you might we might
[54:09] wonder and say well why would it be that
[54:12] has the Holy Spirit would lead the
[54:13] prophet to speak within such a way
[54:16] through that message and you know many
[54:17] other messages discern discernment of
[54:19] spirit Discerning of the body of the
[54:21] Lord many of these that you see the
[54:23] title which are quotes that we're
[54:24] familiar with where it would deal with
[54:26] how that the church itself and in our
[54:28] lives would be so ordered uh of God and
[54:32] you know sometimes we're just we're
[54:33] looking at things we want to get to the
[54:36] heart of the matter in the sense of this
[54:38] is what God has called me to do God has
[54:41] called me to be an expression or a
[54:43] billboard but you see sometimes it's the
[54:46] things that come so subtly in our life
[54:49] that can actually be hindrances and the
[54:52] spirit of God is the one that comes by
[54:54] to be able to pick that up up in our
[54:57] life to help us to see that the desire
[55:00] that is burning within our hearts that
[55:01] God has placed there that these are
[55:04] things that he works to help us to uh be
[55:08] able to discern and then yield them over
[55:10] to him and I want to think look at this
[55:13] in this manner I've and looking at a
[55:15] perception and how that Paul's
[55:17] perception of what's taking place within
[55:20] his life remember he said three times I
[55:24] besought the Lord that God would remove
[55:26] this now this was not a besetting sin in
[55:29] Paul's life brother brandom deals what
[55:31] this was this was a this was an ailment
[55:34] this was something that would expose or
[55:36] bring to light where his eyes remember
[55:39] the Bible says you can see how I've
[55:41] wrote in a big hand writing and brother
[55:42] Bram said ever since he saw that Pillar
[55:45] of Fire on the road there to Damascus he
[55:47] said it always affected his eyes and to
[55:51] think that how that here Paul would God
[55:54] would use him so effectually as as a
[55:57] witness to be able to minister to so
[55:59] many to where that no doubt that there
[56:01] were many that that even we wouldn't
[56:04] have record of that they would actually
[56:06] be healed of some of the same ailments
[56:09] that Paul would actually suffer with in
[56:11] his body sometimes it's hard for us to
[56:14] understand that when we look at how that
[56:16] how many times that the prophet would no
[56:18] doubt pray for individuals I mean
[56:20] countless of times you can take on your
[56:23] table app and type in nervousness you
[56:26] can type in nervous mental oppression
[56:29] type in and almost every time a great
[56:32] deal of time within that you're going to
[56:34] find that there was an effect that that
[56:36] nervousness or that oppression actually
[56:39] had upon a person to cause them ulcers
[56:42] cause them stomach issues so something
[56:44] that would be in the emotional realm
[56:46] would actually affect this physical body
[56:49] because our bodies were not meant to
[56:52] actually experience those types of
[56:54] trauma and so it would be amazing how
[56:57] that the prophet no doubt would pray and
[57:00] it would he would pray under the
[57:01] direction of of the Angel of the Lord
[57:04] and how many individuals received their
[57:07] healing and deliverance from the very
[57:09] thing that the prophet dealt with and it
[57:12] would come in every seven years it would
[57:15] come in a very great way as a matter of
[57:18] fact it would come in such a way that
[57:19] brother BR would think that he was going
[57:21] to lose his life brother Bram tells us
[57:24] of how that God at one time and uniting
[57:26] time and sign he said of how that the
[57:29] Lord eventually has he spoke to him and
[57:31] said Don't Fear it he said now think of
[57:33] it he could have taken it just as easily
[57:37] as he told me don't fear it anymore so
[57:41] he God could have just taken it right
[57:43] from his body like he did for many other
[57:46] individuals but God would allow that to
[57:49] remain and sometimes in our minds we we
[57:52] we can look in such a way and our
[57:54] perception is that everything as far as
[57:57] maybe within our physical body or we
[58:00] have to be feeling on the mountain and
[58:03] man when I feel like I'm on the mountain
[58:05] who don't like to feel like when you're
[58:06] on the mountain but sometimes those are
[58:08] the greatest times that we're actually
[58:12] stronger and God's not as strong or
[58:15] preeminent if I can use that word in our
[58:17] lives as he wants to be you see it's
[58:20] totally contrary to the way that we
[58:22] think about things because his thoughts
[58:24] are so much higher and and sometimes we
[58:26] look at and we think well I you know I
[58:29] maybe I I'm not had such a good week or
[58:31] maybe you know I've had to deal with
[58:33] this at work and man everything was
[58:35] going so right and then I found out this
[58:37] and and then this news came and and then
[58:40] this and you realize some of that we
[58:41] think man I I got to get all this stuff
[58:44] out of the way so I can really serve God
[58:47] the way that he's called me this stuff
[58:49] is nothing but a bunch of junk that's in
[58:51] the way and the truth of the matter is
[58:54] that God permits those things to come
[58:56] about to remind us of our need of him
[59:00] and it brings us to a place of humbling
[59:03] ourselves and calling on God to say Lord
[59:07] I need you you so what would you say it
[59:09] is absolutely prescribed by God and God
[59:13] knowing that in our lives we would need
[59:16] this Divine assistance so that we in
[59:19] ourselves don't become a hindrance quite
[59:22] amazing how that Paul looked at this
[59:24] thing and he looked at it Lord
[59:26] these eyes I need to be able to write
[59:28] these letters what you're laying on my
[59:30] heart to express to the Brethren to the
[59:32] churches Lord Heal My Eyes Lord I I I
[59:35] need to be removed from these
[59:37] circumstances and yet actually what it
[59:40] was what he viewed as a hindrance was
[59:43] actually a prescribed Moment by God
[59:47] because God was bringing this to Paul
[59:50] for Paul to see Paul I don't want you to
[59:53] be a hindrance I don't want you you
[59:56] you're you thinking you can do something
[59:59] about this when you feel like that this
[1:00:02] very eyesight is a hindrance to what
[1:00:04] I've called you to do it's not it's
[1:00:07] actually a moment where my grace is
[1:00:10] sufficient and actually whether you feel
[1:00:13] it or think it my strength is actually
[1:00:17] at its greatest point in your life when
[1:00:20] you feel the very
[1:00:23] weakest but the key is is when we can
[1:00:26] surrender our
[1:00:28] weakness a lot of times the way that we
[1:00:31] sometimes are natural human ways look
[1:00:33] friends these are things we still have
[1:00:34] to deal with it's things that sometimes
[1:00:37] that we'll want to go and hide behind
[1:00:39] something or you know just try I I just
[1:00:42] man I got to get away I I just this I
[1:00:44] just that and sometimes we miss when God
[1:00:47] allows situations to show the humanity
[1:00:51] to show our need that's the time we
[1:00:54] don't want to run that's the time to
[1:00:56] make sure we're in that strong tower and
[1:00:59] say Lord I need you Lord I I Surrender
[1:01:03] Lord this weakness to you maybe it's
[1:01:06] something that comes up on the job
[1:01:08] something that comes up in the church
[1:01:10] something that comes up in the family
[1:01:11] maybe it's a sickness maybe it's a
[1:01:13] doctor's report maybe it's Financial I
[1:01:16] don't know whatever measure of which
[1:01:18] things could be used but how that God
[1:01:21] himself will so allow these things that
[1:01:24] are so contrary to our perception and we
[1:01:27] are doing everything in our manner to
[1:01:30] try to get them out of the way right
[1:01:33] isn't it amazing how the prophet will
[1:01:35] speak on tension and how that tension is
[1:01:39] actually a
[1:01:40] blessing and tell us that can you
[1:01:42] imagine if you didn't have tension in
[1:01:44] your life you'd be a ragd doll if you
[1:01:47] didn't have tension where tension itself
[1:01:50] in that of a belt you know how it is you
[1:01:52] still got belts on your cars and there's
[1:01:54] certain main Drive belts that have to be
[1:01:56] there I don't care how how luxurious the
[1:01:59] car is if the belt itself is broken the
[1:02:02] car's not going anywhere and brother
[1:02:04] brandom rescribed he says that tension
[1:02:07] to a Christian is actually always am I
[1:02:10] pleasing to my Lord that's always the
[1:02:12] question upon the heart of a Believer
[1:02:15] Lord am I pleasing you Lord am am I am I
[1:02:18] am I am I walking Lord where you want me
[1:02:20] to walk and the prophet said imagine
[1:02:22] what we would be without that tension
[1:02:24] and then he said something that you know
[1:02:25] I don't how many times I've quoted this
[1:02:27] quote read through it I I I've preached
[1:02:29] through it but you know God just has a
[1:02:31] way of saying a certain thing at a
[1:02:32] certain time and you know he said can
[1:02:34] you imagine if a marriage did not have
[1:02:37] tension in it he said how in the world
[1:02:40] would that husband and a wife you'd
[1:02:42] never have anything to work
[1:02:45] on wow that's not according to our
[1:02:50] perception but you see in order to work
[1:02:52] on something it requires submission
[1:02:57] it requires yielding and the many things
[1:03:00] that we would look at in our life the
[1:03:03] prophet would say it like this he would
[1:03:04] say it if you haven't listened to that
[1:03:06] message perfect strength through perfect
[1:03:08] weakness I I don't know how many times I
[1:03:10] you know I listen to that message but I
[1:03:11] I'll just tell you I keep on getting
[1:03:13] more and more out of it through the
[1:03:14] times don't even know when I'm going to
[1:03:16] preach out of that or whatever but if
[1:03:17] you haven't listened to it in a while
[1:03:19] just take some time don't you don't have
[1:03:20] to go through it all in one day but just
[1:03:22] take some time and really listen to that
[1:03:24] message of how that brother will deal
[1:03:26] with that aspect of it of of how that
[1:03:28] within you know even within our lives
[1:03:31] that God the very things that we would
[1:03:33] make excuses for are the very things
[1:03:36] that God will use to tackle the job but
[1:03:40] what matters is whether we hang on to
[1:03:42] our
[1:03:44] weaknesses or whether we'll submit them
[1:03:46] you know why the weaknesses God allows
[1:03:48] those weaknesses to be shown he doesn't
[1:03:51] do that in a way to degrade us he
[1:03:54] doesn't do it in a way so much to
[1:03:56] humiliate but yet there is a part of it
[1:03:59] that God wants to bring out of us a
[1:04:02] humility that will actually surrender
[1:04:05] more to him that will yield it to him in
[1:04:07] other words I don't want to make excuses
[1:04:09] for things there might be baggage that
[1:04:11] we've received and man this happened to
[1:04:13] me when I was a child and this I was
[1:04:15] ridiculed like this at school or or this
[1:04:17] was happened all those things are real
[1:04:19] no one no one is saying that those are
[1:04:21] not real but it's what we do with it
[1:04:23] friends it's what we do with weaknesses
[1:04:26] in our life maybe things the way that we
[1:04:28] are built and so forth God is not let me
[1:04:31] just tell you this right now God is not
[1:04:33] interested in trying to make every one
[1:04:35] of us exactly the same that's right real
[1:04:39] true Oneness with God is Not
[1:04:43] sameness God doesn't want you to be like
[1:04:46] somebody else God only wants to be
[1:04:48] himself inside of
[1:04:50] you and God will manifest his glory
[1:04:54] wherein we think but my weaknesses or
[1:04:57] this is showing up or this reproach or
[1:04:59] this was said and this affected my
[1:05:01] spirit or this was done and this so
[1:05:03] affected me in such a my goodness if
[1:05:05] that hadn't helped happened and
[1:05:07] sometimes we're so busy trying to oh if
[1:05:10] I would have done this if I should have
[1:05:12] done this if this wouldn't have happened
[1:05:14] if this instead of all of that it's one
[1:05:16] of those things that Satan is taking us
[1:05:18] on a detour from the real reality that
[1:05:21] God is allowing us to see our weaknesses
[1:05:25] and our need of him you realize when
[1:05:27] Moses got before the burning bush that
[1:05:30] God made known to him as his presence
[1:05:33] just dwelling there God never had to
[1:05:35] tell him this is your weakness this is
[1:05:38] your weakness this is your weakness he
[1:05:40] revealed to Moses seven weaknesses but
[1:05:43] how did he reveal those weaknesses God
[1:05:46] never called one of them out but in the
[1:05:48] presence of the Angel of the Lord Moses
[1:05:52] recognized his infirmities and his inab
[1:05:56] abilities you say why did God keep
[1:05:58] talking with him when he said I can't do
[1:06:00] this why does God keep dealing with
[1:06:04] us why does God keep dealing with us as
[1:06:07] I told him the other day Lord I don't
[1:06:09] understand why that you put up with me I
[1:06:10] don't understand that Lord I just I
[1:06:13] really can't I mean with things that I
[1:06:14] look over in my life and how that you
[1:06:17] can find God will lead us down certain
[1:06:19] Pathways of things that he'll move and
[1:06:22] deal in our life and sometimes we're so
[1:06:24] interested about I've got removing this
[1:06:27] but remember God listen to me now the
[1:06:29] prophet said in the message absolute he
[1:06:31] said God brought me here with all of
[1:06:33] these no accounts put in me so he could
[1:06:38] dig it out of me now God doesn't send an
[1:06:42] excavator down and say hey everybody get
[1:06:45] off the site no that's not how God digs
[1:06:48] it out God digs it out as we yield to
[1:06:51] him and then he said okay I'll bring my
[1:06:53] back ho down in there right now and I'll
[1:06:56] begin to move down you see I'm so glad
[1:06:58] that he digs it out you know what he
[1:07:00] really does it isn't that all of a
[1:07:02] sudden those weaknesses are gone from
[1:07:03] our life but God digging it out is where
[1:07:06] we can realize that Lord I want it self
[1:07:09] to be emptied up because the prophet
[1:07:11] said God takes those weaknesses as
[1:07:14] they're yielded to him and he pours
[1:07:17] himself in and uses
[1:07:21] himself they are
[1:07:24] opportunities for for God to display
[1:07:28] himself what a
[1:07:30] perception totally contrary to the way
[1:07:32] that I think it's contrary to the way
[1:07:35] that you think and I can tell you this
[1:07:37] right now that even after this service
[1:07:39] is over there's things within it God
[1:07:41] speaking to the moment to the season not
[1:07:44] only we're in or what we would be coming
[1:07:46] to but I can tell you right now that
[1:07:48] this is something I pray that will so
[1:07:50] resolve in our hearts and the Holy
[1:07:52] Spirit would just be present to bring it
[1:07:55] back back to us when we come into
[1:07:57] situations Necessities reproaches
[1:08:00] infirmities that to bring it back to us
[1:08:02] Lord I want to just yield right now I
[1:08:05] want to yield to you because remember
[1:08:07] every time anything takes place God's
[1:08:09] not asking you and I to become like
[1:08:11] robots to where all of a sudden we know
[1:08:13] what's going
[1:08:14] on that's not what God's trying to do
[1:08:17] but if we can just say Lord for this
[1:08:18] moment see what God's trying to do is
[1:08:21] build us for this moment and when he
[1:08:23] builds us for this moment he's preparing
[1:08:25] us for the next moment and then within
[1:08:28] that it comes to that place of prayer
[1:08:30] you know there's certain things that you
[1:08:32] know over through time that I I don't
[1:08:34] know about you but I'm sure everybody
[1:08:36] can there's things that I have God has
[1:08:39] spoken and things the where that it's
[1:08:41] helped my life in such a way that it's
[1:08:43] things that I've never forgotten about
[1:08:46] and then yet there's other things that
[1:08:48] won't seem to be in the Forefront of my
[1:08:49] mind but in in the midst of a situation
[1:08:52] sometimes of things to where that when
[1:08:54] I'm looking to the Lord and calling out
[1:08:57] to the Lord you know sometimes it's days
[1:08:59] will go by sometimes maybe a week will
[1:09:02] go by and then all of a sudden he'll
[1:09:04] bring to remembrance a certain quote
[1:09:07] that the prophet of God has said a
[1:09:09] certain scripture he'll bring you say
[1:09:11] why couldn't he have brought that before
[1:09:13] well I I you know I'm not going to put
[1:09:15] it all on God but you know there is an
[1:09:17] element to it that the Bible said that
[1:09:20] that experience it brings hope it says
[1:09:22] tribulation worketh patience and
[1:09:25] patience is endurance is that right and
[1:09:28] through that it brings out experience
[1:09:30] and experience hope hope in other words
[1:09:32] that in this situation I am trusting God
[1:09:35] to Stand and Deliver Me and move upon
[1:09:38] this situation I don't know how I don't
[1:09:40] need to know how I don't need to know
[1:09:42] the next step of the way many times we
[1:09:45] in our Humanity want everything
[1:09:48] explained out Lord I'd like to see
[1:09:50] everything from start to finish like
[1:09:53] that of a vision if God wanted to do it
[1:09:55] that way he'll do it that way if he sees
[1:09:58] that it would be beneficiary not to you
[1:10:02] but to his kingdom in our lives but
[1:10:05] sometimes God being a faithful parent he
[1:10:08] knows exactly how much to give us and
[1:10:11] then he's trying to build and mold and
[1:10:13] shape because God is term determined in
[1:10:16] his heart that he's going to have mature
[1:10:19] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:10:21] hallelujah that's what I want to be
[1:10:23] don't you yes sir you know it would seem
[1:10:26] so incredible of how that God would
[1:10:29] Place such a treasure as the holy spirit
[1:10:33] in in an earth and vessel it doesn't
[1:10:36] seem fitting I mean it would be like you
[1:10:38] taking the greatest picture picture you
[1:10:42] know and putting it in some old tattered
[1:10:45] frame that just maybe it's falling apart
[1:10:48] maybe you've got like duct tape on it
[1:10:50] and you've got such a picture maybe it's
[1:10:53] the picture on the road to emus maybe
[1:10:55] it's the picture the Hoffman's head of
[1:10:57] Christ and the only thing that you would
[1:11:00] have is a frame that might be held
[1:11:03] together with glue some duct tape and
[1:11:06] everything else you would look at that
[1:11:08] and say that frame is not fitting for
[1:11:10] the picture of my Lord let me tell you
[1:11:13] friends that frame is a lot better than
[1:11:16] what our humanity is within our Humanity
[1:11:19] there's things that on my duct tape
[1:11:21] would look like would look like dokin
[1:11:23] seats on a Cadillac I mean the way the
[1:11:26] glue would be on that picture frame but
[1:11:28] God knows he chose us when knowing all
[1:11:31] of that would be there why so it would
[1:11:34] bring us to a place God knows that you
[1:11:37] and I would have such a need in our life
[1:11:40] because still in this flesh even after
[1:11:42] the New Birth has come we will deal with
[1:11:48] pride remember how the fall came about
[1:11:51] where Eve she fell under the midst of
[1:11:53] Temptation to the enemy and how that she
[1:11:56] fail remember lust of the eye lust of
[1:11:59] Flesh and pride of life it was wanting
[1:12:03] to bring something out of her and you
[1:12:05] know that's remember the prophet tells
[1:12:07] us indoors IND door that's one some of
[1:12:10] the first places that where Satan will
[1:12:13] move he'll take maybe a new convert or a
[1:12:16] new life and how Satan will come in
[1:12:18] right there upon that door of Salvation
[1:12:20] and he's standing right there on the
[1:12:22] welcome M but remember he wants to be
[1:12:24] Lord of the entire Temple but he'll not
[1:12:28] force his way in but remember he'll
[1:12:30] stand right there remember Jesus will
[1:12:33] take what we give
[1:12:35] him but brother Ram say how he says that
[1:12:37] that first little door that we have to
[1:12:40] deal with is that little door called
[1:12:43] Pride brother brand would refer to that
[1:12:45] Pride as little pinned up black Devils
[1:12:49] called Pride little things things such
[1:12:52] as you know that would enter into the
[1:12:55] and then desire for Prestige the desire
[1:12:58] to fit in the desire to be accepted
[1:13:01] above friends let me just tell you if
[1:13:02] you if what you have as friends require
[1:13:05] you to act like them they aren't
[1:13:09] friends I'll just tell you that flat out
[1:13:12] they're using you like a knife on a
[1:13:14] stick of butter that's not friends but
[1:13:17] real friends whether you agree with them
[1:13:19] or not they are
[1:13:22] friends is that right if there's things
[1:13:25] that you have to do think of this
[1:13:26] friends it will never be when we look at
[1:13:29] all of this how that Satan will use
[1:13:31] these things in such a way to try to ens
[1:13:34] snare someone but oh if it could be such
[1:13:37] a glimpse and a view of the king of
[1:13:39] glory who laid aside such Splendor and
[1:13:42] we could ask him how did you feel
[1:13:45] leaving the ramp parts of Glory to lay
[1:13:48] aside that of that of your godship and
[1:13:52] come down in that of humanity you left
[1:13:55] that of the myriads of angels and you
[1:13:57] came down to subject yourself to take
[1:14:00] upon a body of Flesh off humiliation to
[1:14:04] walk in this way to be ridiculed to have
[1:14:07] things set against you to be called a
[1:14:10] drunken soldier's child to have all of
[1:14:13] these black marks placed upon your name
[1:14:15] if we could ask him how do you feel he
[1:14:18] would say it has been worth it it is
[1:14:21] worth it because why he did not come for
[1:14:25] his own self he came to be a blessing
[1:14:30] and to bring the blessing to you and I
[1:14:33] he came he laid aside Splendor he did
[1:14:37] something that no devil could ever do he
[1:14:40] laid aside his Splendor and adorned
[1:14:43] himself with such humility that he might
[1:14:46] win our hearts to
[1:14:50] him oh God let us get such a glimpse of
[1:14:53] that if if you not pray if you've not
[1:14:56] got a glimpse of the love of God that
[1:14:58] came down and paid a price for you and
[1:15:01] sent back the Holy Ghost to let you know
[1:15:04] and knock on your door I love you may
[1:15:06] God give you such a revelation of
[1:15:09] Calvary to see what he has done for
[1:15:14] you what a
[1:15:17] perception what a perception yes what
[1:15:20] was looked at in defeat was not defeat
[1:15:24] but the Bible said he was
[1:15:26] crucified in
[1:15:29] weakness but he
[1:15:31] liveth by the power of
[1:15:33] God hallelujah he submitted
[1:15:37] himself listen the last parts of Jesus
[1:15:42] third pole
[1:15:44] Ministry was not displays right it was
[1:15:49] humility that's right behind closed
[1:15:52] doors ging himself I think that that
[1:15:55] scripture is so powerful to me look how
[1:15:58] scripture is placed there's no
[1:16:00] coincidence Jesus the Bible says in the
[1:16:03] Book of John knowing that he come from
[1:16:05] God and going back from God very next
[1:16:07] scripture he dorned
[1:16:10] himself with a towel that's soj and
[1:16:13] begin to wash the
[1:16:16] feet of his
[1:16:18] disciples you see what real I wonder if
[1:16:22] real realization of our son ship has not
[1:16:26] been placed out here in some realm of
[1:16:29] like Aza Street Pentecost where it's
[1:16:32] going to have some massive expression of
[1:16:34] divine gifts it's not no amen the gifts
[1:16:38] are needed right but the gifts remember
[1:16:41] the gifts God has placed the gifts in
[1:16:44] their place when you come in my house
[1:16:46] you don't trip over pots and
[1:16:48] pans those are Bridal gifts are you
[1:16:51] hearing me now but they're not in
[1:16:52] storage we use them right right we use
[1:16:55] them we get them out as we need them but
[1:16:58] they're not on display so every time you
[1:17:00] come over we feel like we've got to
[1:17:02] display tongues I mean got to display
[1:17:04] the stock pot in order to somehow
[1:17:06] convince you oh my we don't have to do
[1:17:09] that but you know what sometimes through
[1:17:12] those very things a meal can be served
[1:17:14] and things done and you don't even know
[1:17:16] what pots been used right right you see
[1:17:19] the majority of the gifts are not even
[1:17:21] right here on display and brother bam
[1:17:23] actually says when they operate within
[1:17:25] Perfection will meet in the back
[1:17:28] room that's good that's right that's
[1:17:31] very it's very right that's very true
[1:17:33] but you see the thing about it is it's
[1:17:35] something about us the way that we look
[1:17:37] at things and God I tell you the that's
[1:17:40] why I'm saying for God to deal and work
[1:17:42] with me I don't know may maybe the rest
[1:17:44] of you don't feel this way but I I feel
[1:17:46] this way Lord through your patience and
[1:17:48] longsuffering for my life how you work
[1:17:51] with me and my perceptions sometimes
[1:17:53] have been so wrong
[1:17:55] I am so glad that he has been so patient
[1:17:58] with me and he would work with me and
[1:18:00] say Samuel you know what you've had the
[1:18:02] wrong perception but he did not look how
[1:18:04] God moved he did not somehow try to
[1:18:07] convince me or bring me to his side he
[1:18:10] just LED he just manifested himself he
[1:18:14] just kept leading and he kept dealing
[1:18:17] with my life until I come to a place and
[1:18:19] say oh Lord my what I thought is not
[1:18:24] what you thought at all and you know
[1:18:26] what and then God can step back and say
[1:18:29] now you're seeing it like I'm seeing it
[1:18:31] son but you see all of that of seeing
[1:18:33] things God wants his word to come down
[1:18:36] in such a way so that we do not become
[1:18:38] puffed up in our heads because you know
[1:18:41] there's such a vast difference we need
[1:18:43] knowledge is that right we we need
[1:18:46] knowledge but remember what we need we
[1:18:48] need Holy Ghost knowledge we need
[1:18:51] spiritual revealed truth we need God to
[1:18:53] reveal things to us we we need them I I
[1:18:56] need I want more of God like we were
[1:18:58] pray we were ministering the last time
[1:19:00] we were together we want to keep seeking
[1:19:03] more and more for God not just because
[1:19:05] oh we want to do this but to realize
[1:19:07] staying humble before God is staying in
[1:19:10] prayer staying with a Reliance on him
[1:19:14] that's one of the simplest of ways that
[1:19:17] we stay within
[1:19:18] humility is that all
[1:19:20] right now notice within this here
[1:19:23] there's many different points and parts
[1:19:25] and we'll just see how the Lord would
[1:19:27] what he would allow us to be able to get
[1:19:28] to here even this morning but I want you
[1:19:31] to just to think of it here within this
[1:19:34] manner because the prophet would speak
[1:19:36] about in these things of there's a
[1:19:38] reason why we come to church now you you
[1:19:41] know many times this message Believers
[1:19:43] you hear Brother Ram say this particular
[1:19:44] phrase in many different messages he'll
[1:19:46] say it and how can I overcome but he'll
[1:19:48] says it right here in perfect strength
[1:19:50] by Perfect weakness and I ask you just a
[1:19:52] moment of why do you come to church
[1:19:55] why do I come to church what's the
[1:19:57] reason what's the purpose behind it well
[1:20:00] I I would definitely say that we come to
[1:20:03] be fed is that right but you see even
[1:20:06] feeding itself feeding itself there's
[1:20:09] also another part to it when the prophet
[1:20:12] of God would tell us in Christ the
[1:20:14] mystery he says he says if your heart
[1:20:16] does not burn to get in here when the
[1:20:18] church doors are open he said it's time
[1:20:21] for you that you got to praying to do
[1:20:23] what get in here and fellowship with
[1:20:26] your brothers and sisters now this is a
[1:20:29] certain realm or a part of Fellowship
[1:20:32] that we have here that as we'll come
[1:20:34] together and we're fellowshipping one
[1:20:35] with the other now listen if it was just
[1:20:37] all about us you or me or whatever more
[1:20:40] I could just say you know what I don't
[1:20:41] need y'all I can just look in a computer
[1:20:43] screen and I can just preach to all of
[1:20:45] you but I'll tell you what I've done
[1:20:46] that before God was gracious to us when
[1:20:49] we had to do that but what good would
[1:20:51] that do you see there's something about
[1:20:53] it to be able to feel that that pull as
[1:20:55] it's coming and needs are coming
[1:20:57] together and you know what it is it
[1:20:58] isn't just about you or it isn't about
[1:21:01] me when we come to a meeting and we come
[1:21:03] together it's not so much just about us
[1:21:06] alone but as we'll begin to pull on the
[1:21:09] gift of almighty God it's kind of like
[1:21:11] this if you had a certain dish at
[1:21:13] Thanksgiving you liked like for me I
[1:21:15] love sweet potato casserole not
[1:21:17] anybody's I like my
[1:21:19] wife's she says it's more like dessert
[1:21:23] but I like it
[1:21:25] with a pumpkin in it the sweet and
[1:21:26] condensed milk two two two two in part
[1:21:31] of that time the topping on the top I'm
[1:21:33] not trying to make your mouth water but
[1:21:34] I'm just saying this to you that you
[1:21:36] know what if that's something that I
[1:21:37] have I desire and say man I cannot wait
[1:21:40] for Thanksgiving I mean forget the
[1:21:41] turkey forget everything else let me to
[1:21:44] the sweet potato casserole guess what
[1:21:46] you may not have asked for sweet potato
[1:21:48] casserole but you being in my house and
[1:21:50] she puts on that at down the table now
[1:21:52] if you like sweet potatoes or youve
[1:21:54] never tried it guess what you're going
[1:21:56] to be benefited because I have asked for
[1:21:59] that that's right and that's the same
[1:22:01] way when we come to the house of God
[1:22:03] don't let it become something in our
[1:22:05] mind our perception that it's just oh
[1:22:07] I've come to feed and we're just like
[1:22:09] you know getting our own little stall
[1:22:11] and we're just feeding that way no it's
[1:22:13] something to wear together that the Holy
[1:22:15] Spirit begins to flow throughout the
[1:22:17] body there are needs and as we're
[1:22:19] pulling on God there are things that
[1:22:22] maybe a brother or sister does not even
[1:22:24] feel like they can lift up their head
[1:22:26] but in the presence of God when the
[1:22:29] Eagles of God begin to feed oh more
[1:22:32] there is the godhead bodily being
[1:22:34] assembled and needs are being met lives
[1:22:37] are being changed Deliverance is coming
[1:22:40] faith is being
[1:22:43] lifted I am My Brother's Keeper
[1:22:47] Hallelujah I am I
[1:22:50] am cuz you know what I'm not going in
[1:22:54] this rapture Everybody by
[1:22:58] myself you're going with
[1:23:02] me and you know what you ain't going by
[1:23:04] yourself without
[1:23:06] me you might look and say brother
[1:23:09] Samuel come on man you need to get with
[1:23:12] the program maybe God's letting you see
[1:23:14] things in me that need to get with the
[1:23:15] program for you to be able to pray in
[1:23:17] humility say God help my
[1:23:19] brother you know why and it ain't so
[1:23:22] much allog together just me alone but
[1:23:24] it's God allowing things to get out of
[1:23:26] your life as
[1:23:27] well remember it isn't always about I
[1:23:30] can just get all this out of the way
[1:23:32] I'll be the absolute Apex perfect
[1:23:35] Christian I think our perception of what
[1:23:38] we perceive that to be is totally not
[1:23:41] what God perceives it to
[1:23:43] [Music]
[1:23:48] be I say God help us
[1:23:51] am so the reason we want to come to
[1:23:53] church is on right if I just read
[1:23:57] this now watch this brother BR says it
[1:24:00] like this he says there's little things
[1:24:01] that we
[1:24:02] do that's what we come to church for is
[1:24:06] to find out where our faults is and the
[1:24:10] things that we might better ourselves by
[1:24:12] how many of you like to go sit down with
[1:24:13] the boss and the boss you know on that
[1:24:16] review now every one of us will like
[1:24:18] sitting down with the boss interview say
[1:24:19] I tell you what you everything man you
[1:24:21] you do everything just right
[1:24:25] right now listen our flesh would like
[1:24:26] that we we you know depending on how
[1:24:28] we're made up sometimes affirming words
[1:24:30] and things like that depending on how
[1:24:32] we're made up but yet there's a part of
[1:24:34] it that we also know there's areas
[1:24:37] there's some areas I need to grow in I
[1:24:39] may not know what they are but you see
[1:24:42] if there's a boss that's above us that
[1:24:44] really cares about us then it's going to
[1:24:47] point out of ways that things could
[1:24:50] actually improve and sometimes those
[1:24:52] things when they come out that way woo
[1:24:54] they sting at first right they sting
[1:24:58] let's just be honest friends they sting
[1:25:00] at first but you know what it's what we
[1:25:03] do with them oh sometimes they'll smart
[1:25:04] a little bit my man it stings oh my
[1:25:07] goodness you talk to your wife about it
[1:25:09] talk to your husband can you believe can
[1:25:12] you you see this is where the balance of
[1:25:15] things that we don't want the prophet of
[1:25:16] God even talked about this in what was
[1:25:18] surround him he said we don't want a
[1:25:20] bunch of Yes
[1:25:22] Men right we want real Real Men of God
[1:25:26] we also want that I want I want God to
[1:25:28] be honest with me don't you this Rapture
[1:25:30] means everything this Rapture means
[1:25:32] everything to me I I want to be where
[1:25:34] he's at as a matter of fact everywhere
[1:25:35] he's at in the word that's where I want
[1:25:37] to be right now I don't want to be left
[1:25:38] behind I want to be where he's at in
[1:25:40] press and truth that's where I want to
[1:25:42] be and because of that desire I want to
[1:25:44] be listen I don't want to miss out on
[1:25:45] nothing that he's doing I Want to Be
[1:25:47] Right a part of what he's doing now it
[1:25:50] may not be what my part I might think
[1:25:53] but I know he's got a part in it for me
[1:25:56] and whatever it is whether it's
[1:25:57] something on the front or something
[1:25:59] behind the scenes No matter what it is
[1:26:01] Lord I just want to be a
[1:26:04] help to what you are Desiring to do in
[1:26:07] this
[1:26:09] hour now think about this he says if we
[1:26:12] come to church for any other objective
[1:26:14] than this I'm afraid we won't get too
[1:26:17] much out of coming to church but we must
[1:26:19] come to find our weaknesses find our bad
[1:26:25] places and see how little we are and put
[1:26:29] our trust in somebody that's
[1:26:33] strong Now find out our weaknesses
[1:26:36] that's these are things that this has
[1:26:38] really requires a real courage of a
[1:26:41] child of God this is where a lot of
[1:26:44] testing comes in of in our lives of how
[1:26:47] God will work with our lives and deal
[1:26:49] with our lives and it's also our
[1:26:51] perception on it listen friends God is
[1:26:55] not God is not here ridiculing us and I
[1:26:58] want you to understand this maybe your
[1:27:00] concept of the message has just been
[1:27:04] Conformity out
[1:27:05] here you can be ever so conformed out
[1:27:08] here and you miss the
[1:27:11] Rapture but if you're conformed in here
[1:27:14] it'll reflect out here are you hearing
[1:27:17] me it'll reflect all the way through
[1:27:20] because whatever God does within it'll
[1:27:22] show itself on the on the outside but
[1:27:24] you see if it only is perceived as just
[1:27:27] putting on a new coat we don't need a
[1:27:29] new coat we need a new man in the
[1:27:33] coat that's what the Holy Ghost comes to
[1:27:35] do it comes to change our very
[1:27:39] nature it gives us strength so that it's
[1:27:42] not us conforming but it's yielding and
[1:27:45] being transformed by the renewing of our
[1:27:49] minds say Lord if you find yourself look
[1:27:52] look friends if you find yourself with
[1:27:54] any little bit of resistance to the word
[1:27:56] of God well this was applied this way or
[1:27:59] this was applied that way listen just
[1:28:00] lay aside all vessels and look straight
[1:28:04] at the word of God and if the word of
[1:28:06] God if this is what it's laid out say
[1:28:08] Lord remedy everything within me to
[1:28:11] match the very word of God and the
[1:28:14] character the heart of it Lord God let
[1:28:17] it be so formed in the depths of my
[1:28:22] life now watch this
[1:28:24] brother brand would make this statement
[1:28:26] how many ever heard of this term high
[1:28:28] horse I mean it's a it's a common term
[1:28:30] you know that's that's used and I think
[1:28:33] it's still used today but you know when
[1:28:35] we look at this of what a high horse
[1:28:37] would be it' be like that of of pride of
[1:28:40] arrogance there's a lot of different
[1:28:42] ways in which that this very thing would
[1:28:43] mean and it would be something this of a
[1:28:46] high horse would be something to where
[1:28:48] that owners and different ones of
[1:28:51] Estates and so forth they would show
[1:28:53] their prestige or who they were by
[1:28:56] riding on a horse so that they were able
[1:28:59] to look down upon their subjects wow
[1:29:03] they put themsel they put themselves in
[1:29:06] a position to be able to look down on
[1:29:09] others and so they would they would this
[1:29:12] is what the whole this is where a high
[1:29:14] horse actually comes from it comes from
[1:29:17] that the parts of you know Masters and
[1:29:19] servants and other things like that but
[1:29:21] you know sometimes it could even be to
[1:29:23] where as when I was doing the studies on
[1:29:24] it to where somebody would make sure
[1:29:26] that they had a more brilliant horse one
[1:29:29] that would be maybe a little bit larger
[1:29:31] a little bit bigger to where that they
[1:29:32] still had the upper as it were Echelon
[1:29:35] to be able to somehow have at least an
[1:29:38] angle to look
[1:29:40] down now let me read what the prophet
[1:29:42] says here in perfect strength he's
[1:29:45] asking that God would help us as a
[1:29:47] people to be able to understand these
[1:29:50] things God I hope that this gets down
[1:29:54] deep to us when brother brand preaches
[1:29:57] this message he includes
[1:29:59] himself you hear me when brother BR
[1:30:02] preaches perfect strength he includes
[1:30:03] himself he realizes for the furtherance
[1:30:07] of the ministry that's coming on of that
[1:30:10] third pull he says I need more of a
[1:30:12] killing of William
[1:30:15] brandom more of an emptying up notice he
[1:30:19] says both here in the tape world that
[1:30:22] you realize you've got to become nothing
[1:30:24] not a know- it all not a great somebody
[1:30:27] but a nobody got to come to dust you've
[1:30:31] got to get to a place that you know that
[1:30:34] you're nothing true and don't ever rise
[1:30:39] above it for as soon as you rise above
[1:30:42] it you rise above God let me ask you the
[1:30:45] question that that second paragraph when
[1:30:47] he says don't never rise above it when I
[1:30:50] read that that shows the possibility
[1:30:54] that still lays there in our
[1:30:57] Humanity
[1:31:00] right you've notice you've got to keep
[1:31:05] yourself in the dust and on the road to
[1:31:09] Damascus you've got to keep yourself off
[1:31:13] your high
[1:31:16] horses ain't it incredible he didn't he
[1:31:19] wasn't saying in this message now he
[1:31:21] deals with the new birth of Us coming to
[1:31:23] a place to know that we're nothing that
[1:31:25] surrender through all of our efforts
[1:31:27] through all of our try to finally come
[1:31:29] to a place of surrender full surrender
[1:31:32] that the spirit of God can move in and
[1:31:34] bring about a real Divine change in our
[1:31:36] life but that no we are nothing staying
[1:31:40] in the dust listen the new birth is
[1:31:42] there to equip us with that reality that
[1:31:45] without me you can do nothing but
[1:31:46] remember keeping ourselves in the dust
[1:31:49] right does not mean walking around oh
[1:31:52] I'm nothing I can't do nothing right I
[1:31:55] can't do anything right that's good
[1:31:57] preach that's not surrendering no our
[1:32:01] weakness if you can receive it in that
[1:32:03] way it's actually Pride cuz none of us
[1:32:06] likes our weaknesses to be exposed
[1:32:09] that's right none of us likes our
[1:32:12] weaknesses to be talked about you take a
[1:32:14] husband and wife that'll sit down and we
[1:32:16] begin to sit down sometimes things will
[1:32:18] will arise that allows us to be able to
[1:32:20] talk with one another I'm not talking
[1:32:22] about getting out of chalkboard and
[1:32:24] ripping somebody down and pointing out
[1:32:25] this and this and this let me tell you
[1:32:26] something we both both as husband and
[1:32:29] wife are flawed human
[1:32:33] beings and we both need the grace of
[1:32:36] almighty
[1:32:38] God but notice this high horse that
[1:32:41] would be here it's evident remember when
[1:32:44] Elijah was taken beyond the curtain of
[1:32:47] time or when he moved from one dimension
[1:32:50] into the other remember even how brother
[1:32:53] Brandon would ALS also would also speak
[1:32:55] of that and referring it into the
[1:32:56] scriptures when he was caught up there
[1:32:59] there when the Jordan was split and here
[1:33:00] he was he was caught up and he was
[1:33:02] raptured and Elisha saw it and he threw
[1:33:05] back the same garment there of The Same
[1:33:08] Spirit upon Elisha brother Braham says
[1:33:12] there was horses that was gathered in
[1:33:14] the
[1:33:15] bushes and he said when it came time for
[1:33:18] Elijah to go God loosened those there
[1:33:23] was the host or the myriads of angels
[1:33:25] thousands upon thousands upon thousands
[1:33:28] and here Elijah slips into that place
[1:33:31] and the Chariot moves down and here the
[1:33:34] very power that's needed when you think
[1:33:36] of horses think of power they are beast
[1:33:40] of
[1:33:41] power and they were loosened for that
[1:33:44] moment to carry him from one dimension
[1:33:47] to another they serve their purpose but
[1:33:50] yet after the New Birth is come in our
[1:33:53] lives God does not strip away the high
[1:33:56] horses they're still tied up right here
[1:34:01] hallelujah that's good yeah and we've
[1:34:05] got to keep ourselves off of
[1:34:10] them the difficulty within that is we're
[1:34:13] talking about a
[1:34:15] spiritual spiritual thing we're not
[1:34:18] talking about a natural thing remember
[1:34:21] the prophet of God when he preaches the
[1:34:22] seals and he stands up there and he
[1:34:24] preaches there and he's dealing with the
[1:34:26] first seal remember he's taken a stab at
[1:34:29] it throughout some of the other places
[1:34:31] drawing from other men's conclusions is
[1:34:34] that right he did the best that he could
[1:34:36] at that point in time but you see it was
[1:34:38] an urgency that was moving in that hour
[1:34:40] there was an urgency why this was the
[1:34:42] season for the seals to come open but it
[1:34:45] just wasn't the junction or the moment
[1:34:48] of time but seeing the burden of the
[1:34:50] hour even as the prophet would begin to
[1:34:52] look into those things and yet he would
[1:34:54] call that white horse rider the Holy
[1:34:59] Ghost but you see when the spirit of God
[1:35:02] came to the place to open it up to what
[1:35:06] it was what seemed so
[1:35:10] innocent that's good there was one
[1:35:12] detail that was left out yeah that's
[1:35:15] right there was no arrow in his
[1:35:18] bowl that's right the other detail as it
[1:35:21] was left out it was not coming to
[1:35:24] conquer for Christ it was coming to
[1:35:26] conquer the people and lead them away
[1:35:30] from the victory that God had brought
[1:35:33] down to earth through
[1:35:35] Calvary and through innocency it was
[1:35:38] Leading the People in a ride on a beast
[1:35:41] of power Hallelujah it was leading them
[1:35:46] from their humility from the
[1:35:49] Purity just doing it as on a ride coming
[1:35:52] in very innocent
[1:35:54] listen friends when I look at the seals
[1:35:55] I don't look at the seals as Doctrine it
[1:35:58] is Doctrine there is an event of what
[1:36:01] Satan it exposes what Satan's attempted
[1:36:03] Destruction has tried to do and come
[1:36:06] against the Church of the Living God all
[1:36:08] the way down through it reveals also our
[1:36:11] place it reveals our name reveals our
[1:36:13] position but look friends I don't just
[1:36:15] look at the white horse rider even
[1:36:17] anybody there has been men that could
[1:36:19] have taught and have taught these things
[1:36:21] and the white horse rider is the
[1:36:23] Antichrist Spirit and the black horse
[1:36:24] rider is the is you know death and and
[1:36:26] you know the r red horse rider church
[1:36:28] and state coming together we don't need
[1:36:30] that kind of knowledge alone we need the
[1:36:33] Divine application of discernment by the
[1:36:36] spirit to discern Satan's attempted ride
[1:36:40] in our own lives in our own homes in our
[1:36:45] church we need the discernment of the
[1:36:48] Holy Spirit to take the cover off of
[1:36:52] him let me tell you brother brandham
[1:36:55] does not have to come back and preach
[1:36:57] the trail of the serpent it has already
[1:37:00] been laid
[1:37:01] [Applause]
[1:37:08] out and I want to remind you this thing
[1:37:12] that we comb his hair if you've got it
[1:37:14] feed it take care of it baby it pamper
[1:37:16] it I want to remind you this is the
[1:37:18] Serpent's meat uhuh book of Isaiah
[1:37:24] serpents meat right
[1:37:26] here this is what Satan likes to come
[1:37:29] and try to anoint you know what he wants
[1:37:31] to try to do pull us out into these
[1:37:34] Realms anybody ever felt anxious
[1:37:37] before maybe I'm just the only one
[1:37:40] remember there's a few other people
[1:37:41] agree with me but at that point you know
[1:37:43] in that feeling anxious wait a minute
[1:37:44] that ain't the spirit of God making me
[1:37:45] feel that way right there can be a
[1:37:49] seriousness of the moment like let's say
[1:37:51] if we're sitting in the house of God but
[1:37:52] the spirit of God will never produce
[1:37:56] anxiousness that'll be the enemy trying
[1:37:58] to get in there like let's say God
[1:38:01] calling upon a life God dealing with the
[1:38:02] heart right here in service and here he
[1:38:04] is the gentleness and the sweetness the
[1:38:06] wooing of the Holy Spirit to bring us to
[1:38:08] a place of open up to yield our
[1:38:10] weaknesses to him not walk away closed
[1:38:13] but say Lord Lord God strip it all out
[1:38:15] of me dig it out of me Lord God so you
[1:38:18] can pour yourself in I realize Lord that
[1:38:20] this in itself it's not so much of a
[1:38:22] hindrance but it is a prescribed moment
[1:38:26] for you to come and move down in my life
[1:38:28] but Satan will try to slip up and bring
[1:38:32] anxiousness but the dove of the holy
[1:38:34] spirit is always with sweetness and
[1:38:36] tenderness to bring about a real release
[1:38:38] in our life places where we can put our
[1:38:41] feet
[1:38:43] spiritually but even in our lives when
[1:38:45] we have felt anxiousness in other places
[1:38:48] remember when the maniac Came Upon the
[1:38:50] platform and the prophet is standing
[1:38:52] right there he was temp tempted to be
[1:38:54] pulled out into another realm he even
[1:38:56] had people around him that was trying to
[1:38:59] pull him out of another realm the
[1:39:00] policeman good men I I thank God for the
[1:39:03] policemen but here they were they were
[1:39:04] coming they were getting ready to lay
[1:39:06] hands on that man to tell you the truth
[1:39:08] they have shredded he' a shredded every
[1:39:09] one of them policemen why cuz he was
[1:39:13] anointed there was a devil that was
[1:39:15] there upon him who knows what would have
[1:39:17] taken place on that platform maybe he
[1:39:19] would have ended up dead I don't know
[1:39:21] maybe others would have ended up dead do
[1:39:23] you
[1:39:23] just in that moment the right thing to
[1:39:27] doen when the prophet yielded he said he
[1:39:30] be to thank different thoughts
[1:39:32] concerning that man and that allowed the
[1:39:37] Holy Spirit to move down amen High
[1:39:42] horses were
[1:39:45] tied he could have got on them
[1:39:50] Hallelujah and we would have read a
[1:39:52] different story right
[1:39:53] listen friends all of the spirits and
[1:39:56] things that we have out here you better
[1:39:58] be careful who you're beeping at when
[1:39:59] you're riding down the
[1:40:01] road there's enough people that's on
[1:40:03] enough stuff and it's not even dope
[1:40:05] that's out there it's stuff that's
[1:40:06] prescribed through doctors and
[1:40:08] everything else and even when you lay
[1:40:10] all that aside there's enough things
[1:40:12] where individuals even have listen
[1:40:15] they're tormented and we're at the end
[1:40:17] time this is why this is where it's at
[1:40:20] it's not going to get any better the
[1:40:22] prophet tells us in Jubilee year
[1:40:25] 1954 it's not going to get any better
[1:40:28] it's only going to get
[1:40:35] worse God help
[1:40:38] us to stay off our high
[1:40:43] horses let's look at this high horse
[1:40:45] just for a moment here subtleness of it
[1:40:53] something that could happen so
[1:40:55] easily of things that we could have in
[1:40:59] our lives that God has done for
[1:41:02] us remember Brother Brad would tell
[1:41:05] us healing salvation he'll go through
[1:41:09] many things he said it will hold out as
[1:41:12] long as your faith holds out right
[1:41:15] everybody with me still right brother BR
[1:41:17] then takes us into perfect perfect Faith
[1:41:20] now remember perfect faith cannot
[1:41:22] operate
[1:41:23] when anything in that channel is not
[1:41:26] right whether it's unconfessed sin or
[1:41:30] it's
[1:41:31] Pride anything gets in the way it starts
[1:41:35] weakening
[1:41:38] faith brother Ram tells us even
[1:41:41] complaining
[1:41:42] weakens
[1:41:45] Faith now watch
[1:41:48] this here is a situation of a sister
[1:41:52] here she is standing before the prophet
[1:41:54] said yes lady you're standing before me
[1:41:56] you're a Christian you're suffering with
[1:41:58] the blood pressure you're real nervous
[1:42:01] you got gallbladder trouble nervous
[1:42:03] upset brings her to a blood pressure and
[1:42:06] there's something strange about you
[1:42:09] you've accepted your healing once before
[1:42:13] on the same thing but you got too Hottie
[1:42:17] with it wow and it got away wow the very
[1:42:22] thing that she had in her possession she
[1:42:25] got too Hottie with
[1:42:28] it now brother Rand doesn't go on to say
[1:42:31] as far as how was it that she was acting
[1:42:34] I don't know was she testifying in a way
[1:42:37] to where it was lifting her faith up to
[1:42:41] where as though she had such great faith
[1:42:43] I don't know maybe it was at even at a
[1:42:45] coffee shop or at other places and it
[1:42:47] got to somehow some way it was in place
[1:42:50] to where that God could no longer
[1:42:53] abide in that same place and you know
[1:42:57] what it did it invited those same things
[1:43:00] that she had been free from it invited
[1:43:03] him to come right back into her life
[1:43:06] gallbladder trouble blood pressure why
[1:43:10] she got too hotti with
[1:43:12] it was it that she got careless in her
[1:43:14] life and in her walk with God was it
[1:43:17] that she just got to
[1:43:20] thinking was it she just got to thinking
[1:43:23] are you with me was it that she just got
[1:43:25] to
[1:43:26] thinking how many times we going to pray
[1:43:28] for so and so about gallbladder trouble
[1:43:29] God healed me where's their faith
[1:43:32] at I don't know the prophet doesn't go
[1:43:35] on and say but he just says you got too
[1:43:38] hoty with
[1:43:39] it brother random talks about out in the
[1:43:42] trailer park power transformation talks
[1:43:45] about the little sister sitting there in
[1:43:47] the wheelchair he said we prayed for her
[1:43:49] time and time again why that God has not
[1:43:52] healed her I don't know why but brother
[1:43:56] Bram goes into another part in the
[1:43:57] message this day the scripture is
[1:43:59] fulfilled not the long one the short one
[1:44:01] right after the event happens in Arizona
[1:44:04] and he talks about how the people got
[1:44:05] together in that trailer park and you
[1:44:07] know what what was looked at as a place
[1:44:09] they could have looked and said God why
[1:44:11] don't you heal her I don't understand
[1:44:12] why you're doing this but brother Brown
[1:44:14] tells us he said the people got together
[1:44:16] and they made her home conducive for a
[1:44:21] wheelchair oh wow ramp the door being
[1:44:24] widen we would look at that God raise
[1:44:27] her up what a witness she'll be but God
[1:44:29] said through this situation I'm not
[1:44:31] trying to interpret it but look what
[1:44:33] happened God's love would just was
[1:44:35] displayed in maybe not seeming to be
[1:44:38] such a spiritual way but it was a care
[1:44:41] for her well-being it wasn't just people
[1:44:43] standing at the altar and praying oh God
[1:44:46] healer oh God healer oh God healer they
[1:44:49] knew he was a
[1:44:51] Healer that's so so good but they took
[1:44:54] it upon themselves out of love
[1:44:57] Hallelujah to make her Dwelling Place
[1:45:02] accessible to her now I don't have to
[1:45:04] ask you our
[1:45:07] Humanity the way that we think of
[1:45:09] glorifying God is so far contrary oh yes
[1:45:13] to what we
[1:45:15] think and God does it in such a way to
[1:45:18] ensure he's not going to share his glory
[1:45:21] with nobody
[1:45:23] that's why he's placed his glory in this
[1:45:26] earn frail vessel that's like a clay pot
[1:45:30] that if you're not careful and you don't
[1:45:31] set it down just right if it's too cold
[1:45:34] and you bring it inside suddenly in the
[1:45:36] hot it's liable to crack it's liable to
[1:45:38] break you got to handle it with
[1:45:40] care well who is it that handles us with
[1:45:43] care CU we sure don't do very good on
[1:45:44] our own right sometimes the way we
[1:45:47] handle our attitude handle our emotions
[1:45:50] handle everything we don't do too good
[1:45:51] friends but aren't you glad that there
[1:45:54] is one on the inside of us that like
[1:45:56] when God told Joshua do not be afraid or
[1:45:58] dismayed dismayed don't be shattered in
[1:46:01] a bunch of pieces aren't you glad that
[1:46:03] there's one who holds us together oh yes
[1:46:07] when we feel like we're in a million
[1:46:10] pieces that is so good and we wonder oh
[1:46:13] God I I want to be stronger God said no
[1:46:15] no no you're too
[1:46:17] strong you're getting to a place you're
[1:46:20] getting there you're getting there oh
[1:46:22] God I just Lord take it out and take
[1:46:24] this away from me Lord I you know this
[1:46:26] thing Lord I I seem like this this area
[1:46:28] and this part and maybe my respond here
[1:46:31] or this this was said to me oh God just
[1:46:33] remove this boss Lord oh God put
[1:46:36] powdered sugar all over my wife Lord God
[1:46:38] oh Father dust my husband with honey
[1:46:40] Lord but God permits these things for
[1:46:44] one purpose hallu that we would
[1:46:47] surrender our weaknesses and see our
[1:46:50] weaknesses let me tell you something it
[1:46:52] takes a real son and daughter of God to
[1:46:55] be able to stand in the mirror of God's
[1:46:57] word and hear what the word is saying
[1:47:00] and say Lord be it unto me according to
[1:47:03] Thy
[1:47:05] word anybody can look at the word as
[1:47:07] long as we're being pattern on the back
[1:47:09] and listen to me there are services and
[1:47:12] times that God he works in such a way
[1:47:15] how sometimes that he'll move over here
[1:47:17] and this way and other times man you
[1:47:19] you're swinging so high up in the ramp
[1:47:21] parts of glory and other times you're
[1:47:23] just pulling up your toes and your shoes
[1:47:25] with man I don't want to be on the
[1:47:26] Flames God has a way of even bringing
[1:47:29] the church and he swing back and forth
[1:47:32] why he keeps us in a place of
[1:47:37] humility not of wondering not of tore up
[1:47:41] don't misunderstand me God doesn't keep
[1:47:43] us tore up but he keeps us in a
[1:47:46] place of looking to him
[1:47:49] amen but how was it that this little
[1:47:51] sister got too Hotty
[1:47:53] I I don't know but I just pray Lord help
[1:47:59] us because whatever it was whether it
[1:48:02] was something she said whether it was a
[1:48:05] way she started to carry herself whether
[1:48:07] it was a way that she started to do I
[1:48:09] don't know but somewhere along the line
[1:48:13] it became a welcome mat for those same
[1:48:17] Spirits gallbladder blood pressure other
[1:48:20] things to come right back
[1:48:25] I don't want no welcome at on those
[1:48:29] things now watch the prescription watch
[1:48:31] what the prophet tells her her husband's
[1:48:34] already passed on to be with the
[1:48:37] Lord and watch what he tells her he says
[1:48:42] sister now you go on your road
[1:48:46] rejoicing and saying and the sister
[1:48:50] says I had doubts about my
[1:48:54] healing and I lost
[1:48:56] it now go watch this be humble and sweet
[1:49:03] and Jesus will be with you
[1:49:06] amen she lost it by getting too
[1:49:10] hotti and now here's the
[1:49:13] prescription be humble be sweet and
[1:49:18] Jesus will be with
[1:49:20] youall that's what we want Lord
[1:49:24] Lord I want him to be with
[1:49:27] us God help us that in these parts
[1:49:29] there's other places that we could go
[1:49:32] with this here this morning I just I'm
[1:49:34] just going to pull up right here but
[1:49:36] these high horses that are still tied
[1:49:40] right in here just because they're tied
[1:49:43] there and every once in a while oh every
[1:49:47] one of
[1:49:48] us have Rotom every once in a while
[1:49:52] the thing of it is is when you get up
[1:49:54] there on the high horse it's kind of
[1:49:55] hard to get down yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:49:59] because a lot of times you had to climb
[1:50:00] a ladder to get up there and you get up
[1:50:03] there into where it's everything and
[1:50:04] we're just looking down on everything
[1:50:06] else you know there is a place that God
[1:50:08] does lift you and I but it's not on high
[1:50:11] horse on the wings of an
[1:50:14] eagle and when he lifts us on the wings
[1:50:16] of an eagle oh it's true we can see
[1:50:18] things but you know what we're seeing
[1:50:19] we're not looking down on somebody else
[1:50:21] but on the wings of the eagle we can
[1:50:23] begin to see things like it is when you
[1:50:25] zoom in in and out on your Maps Google
[1:50:27] Maps whatever you use Apple Maps Google
[1:50:29] Earth any of those things and you can
[1:50:30] zoom right in and you can move right
[1:50:32] down the road take 3d pictures and you
[1:50:34] can see what what the address what the
[1:50:35] house looks like business looks like you
[1:50:37] can move right down you can zoom out and
[1:50:39] see all the different directions of the
[1:50:40] parking how traffic comes off should I
[1:50:42] get off at this exit ramp and travel
[1:50:44] here should I you you can see all of
[1:50:45] that why from The View up there but
[1:50:48] notice what that view is all about that
[1:50:50] Eagle View is not about looking down
[1:50:54] yeah it's about looking to the answer
[1:50:58] looking to our
[1:51:00] destination are you hearing me that's
[1:51:03] good looking to the end that is so good
[1:51:06] say God help us am many other ways of
[1:51:09] this subtleness of these high horses but
[1:51:13] you know what it's kind of like that
[1:51:15] little black dog in our life I want
[1:51:18] these high horses to be starved to death
[1:51:23] would it not be no Marvel if when God
[1:51:25] gave you the Holy Ghost he totally done
[1:51:28] away with every high horse but instead
[1:51:30] he said they're just going to stay tied
[1:51:32] up right there in your
[1:51:33] flesh and it'll be a
[1:51:36] testimony syvia is that you God bless
[1:51:39] you good to have you Lord have
[1:51:41] mercy God allows them high horses to be
[1:51:45] tied up in our flesh
[1:51:49] right that his glory might be made
[1:51:51] manifest
[1:51:53] but you know what if you ever get on a
[1:51:54] high horse and we
[1:51:56] have God will give us Grace to get off
[1:51:59] of it but a lot of times coming off a
[1:52:01] high horse it won't be pumpkin pie apple
[1:52:05] pie it'll be humble
[1:52:06] pie and God does it in such a
[1:52:09] way you know why he does that because
[1:52:13] part of that humility sometimes the ways
[1:52:16] of things of getting up there on that
[1:52:18] high horse God has to allow the
[1:52:21] situations not to to be so nice and
[1:52:23] sweet and coming back down but God does
[1:52:26] things in order to teach us and shape us
[1:52:30] and mold us don't you love
[1:52:34] him Lord thank
[1:52:37] you for the right
[1:52:40] perception kind of makes you look at
[1:52:41] your weaknesses a whole lot different
[1:52:43] doesn't it it doesn't make us make
[1:52:45] excuses for him we don't want to do that
[1:52:48] we want to yield un to him when we come
[1:52:51] into His presence and we can see certain
[1:52:53] things listen Satan would love nothing
[1:52:56] more than to get you isolated from the
[1:52:58] rest of the body get you if he can get
[1:53:00] you look he can get you isolated he can
[1:53:02] just start waylaying on you he can just
[1:53:04] start waylaying and get you down and
[1:53:07] everything else you know how it
[1:53:11] is why he's trying to weaken
[1:53:16] you and now for
[1:53:18] us what if we see our brother our sister
[1:53:21] in need
[1:53:24] don't get on your high
[1:53:26] horse but come wrapped in humility and
[1:53:30] say Hey Brother Hey sister praying for
[1:53:33] you right I love you see sometimes we
[1:53:37] can look we not we're not careful these
[1:53:39] high horses are so
[1:53:42] subtle we can climb up on the high horse
[1:53:45] and say well if they would have done
[1:53:48] this if they would have done this if
[1:53:51] they would do this if they and we're not
[1:53:54] careful listen friends we understand
[1:53:57] there's times where even in our own life
[1:53:59] where there has to be correction but you
[1:54:01] know what God hadn't asked me or you to
[1:54:04] be the
[1:54:06] enforcer restoration of the brid tree
[1:54:08] the holy spirit is the enforcer to God's
[1:54:13] word and the whole thing that the
[1:54:15] prophet said if you need your healing if
[1:54:18] you need the Holy Ghost if and he lays
[1:54:20] out a whole bunch of needs he said just
[1:54:21] yield and let him take you there hallah
[1:54:28] amen this is where I
[1:54:31] stand cuz there ain't none of us have a
[1:54:35] right to get on our high
[1:54:37] horse if we really start looking at
[1:54:39] weaknesses and faults of one another
[1:54:42] we're all in
[1:54:43] trouble we're all in trouble well that
[1:54:46] isn't making us a little group you know
[1:54:48] that sits around with folding chairs and
[1:54:49] sings Kumbaya and we'll never be any
[1:54:51] better people that's not what I'm
[1:54:53] talking about it's every one of us
[1:54:56] individually recognizing our need of
[1:54:59] almighty God and as he deals with our
[1:55:03] life as weaknesses are made known don't
[1:55:05] pull back from him but say God Amen help
[1:55:09] me Lord even be this honest with him and
[1:55:12] say help me to surrender in the Right
[1:55:14] Way Beyond Lord I might think I'm
[1:55:16] surrendering but God help me let my
[1:55:19] heart match what you're calling for you
[1:55:21] allowed this Lord to show up something
[1:55:24] that maybe something that I seen where
[1:55:27] why did this brother go astray why did
[1:55:29] this sister go astray sometimes God
[1:55:31] allows those things to happen that we
[1:55:33] might be tested whether or not we'll
[1:55:36] climb on our high
[1:55:40] horse or whether we'll go in humility
[1:55:45] see sometimes remember our perception on
[1:55:47] things is we've got to get everything
[1:55:49] just right in the church
[1:55:52] we've got to we've got to iron it all
[1:55:54] out if that was possible denominations
[1:55:57] would have been a
[1:55:59] success it's not a man that can iron out
[1:56:03] a
[1:56:04] people it's the power of almighty
[1:56:08] God I have Got Confidence as the
[1:56:11] scripture says not by might not by power
[1:56:14] but by my spirit sayith the Lord we
[1:56:17] don't need to manufacture
[1:56:19] anything we just need to let the Holy
[1:56:22] Spirit say Lord if my part you know how
[1:56:25] it is when you got two hoses together
[1:56:27] sometimes to get out certain things
[1:56:29] around my shed I've got two hoses each
[1:56:31] of them 50t in length and sometimes to
[1:56:34] get out there and water my plants around
[1:56:37] the shed and when we had a garden I had
[1:56:39] to get a thing in order to join those
[1:56:42] hoses
[1:56:44] together your part my
[1:56:47] part god might call you call me and he
[1:56:52] has and he
[1:56:53] will in some instances to join things
[1:56:58] together and place Us in places to say
[1:57:02] will you stand in the
[1:57:03] breach will you stand in the
[1:57:06] Gap will you make up the Hedge will you
[1:57:10] stand there on behalf of your brother
[1:57:11] but they're wrong Lord but I want to
[1:57:13] know are you going to get on your high
[1:57:15] horse or you going to stand in the
[1:57:19] Gap what are you going to do I said Lord
[1:57:23] hallu the only thing I want to nourish
[1:57:26] is I want to nourish if I can say it
[1:57:28] this way that horse that Beast of power
[1:57:32] that came and changed my nature like
[1:57:35] Rebecca I want to water it I want to
[1:57:38] water it I don't want to water them high
[1:57:40] horses it's amazing how them high horses
[1:57:43] still there I don't want to water them
[1:57:46] Brother Carlos I don't want to water
[1:57:47] them they can still be tied up but
[1:57:49] greater is he that is in me
[1:57:52] than those High horses better are tied
[1:57:56] up let's
[1:58:01] pray Lord
[1:58:06] Jesus may you Lord I pray the words that
[1:58:10] you've delivered
[1:58:13] Lord to our hearts this
[1:58:16] morning
[1:58:18] Father I'm asking you Lord right here
[1:58:20] for my own life
[1:58:23] and for the life of this assembly for
[1:58:25] every brother every sister those that
[1:58:28] would be here those that would be
[1:58:29] streaming those that would archive it
[1:58:32] everyone that would look at it Lord as
[1:58:34] their home
[1:58:36] assembly I'm asking you Lord help us
[1:58:41] father
[1:58:44] Lord sometimes lord it's like when
[1:58:47] we you can hear those horses sometimes
[1:58:50] and they'll make those snor in sounds
[1:58:52] and they're standing around many times
[1:58:54] we've been down there in Amish Country
[1:58:56] and walk through different barns or even
[1:58:57] sometimes down the sidewalk and you just
[1:58:59] kind of hear them they kind of Click
[1:59:02] their their uh
[1:59:05] Hoopes where they've been Shaw and you
[1:59:07] can hear it on the pavement sometimes
[1:59:09] you can hear that snort whatever we say
[1:59:10] it is that they're
[1:59:12] doing
[1:59:15] Lord in various
[1:59:18] settings in times Lord of weakness
[1:59:21] necessities
[1:59:24] reproaches I can hear them
[1:59:28] Lord
[1:59:30] father on behalf of myself and behalf of
[1:59:33] every one of us in
[1:59:35] here I pray heavenly father that you
[1:59:38] would forgive us
[1:59:40] Lord I know Lord that no doubt Lord as
[1:59:44] we've sat
[1:59:45] here individually in our lives we've
[1:59:48] went through times and things where
[1:59:50] we've
[1:59:52] you brought us to be able to come to
[1:59:54] that realization Lord forgive
[1:59:58] me forgive me Lord for getting up that
[2:00:01] high
[2:00:04] horse but Lord our
[2:00:07] desire now that you've helped us to
[2:00:12] see you've not taken the high
[2:00:16] horses
[2:00:17] away yet in one sense when the New Birth
[2:00:20] has come you have delivered us from the
[2:00:24] ruling power that was in our
[2:00:28] life Lord the reality
[2:00:33] is we didn't need a new
[2:00:37] devotional we didn't need a lot of other
[2:00:40] things that we thought we needed what we
[2:00:42] needed was a new
[2:00:46] Administration I thank Lord when this
[2:00:48] Earth as it's going through its stages
[2:00:50] of redemption
[2:00:52] [Music]
[2:00:54] in that time lord god of the
[2:00:57] Millennium when this Earth will fall
[2:01:00] under the
[2:01:01] administration of the son of
[2:01:04] David the Bible says that the knowledge
[2:01:07] of the Lord will
[2:01:09] fill the land the Sea and the
[2:01:15] sky it'll be a new
[2:01:18] Administration the old Administration is
[2:01:21] done away with
[2:01:24] Lord I pray here this
[2:01:26] morning if there's one that doesn't know
[2:01:29] you in that
[2:01:30] way for the things that Lord that you
[2:01:33] have spoken and ministered to our
[2:01:35] hearts you're not requiring and asking
[2:01:39] us to somehow conform Our Lives you're
[2:01:43] not laying down better steps on how to
[2:01:47] be a better person that's not it but
[2:01:51] Lord you're speaking to Sons and
[2:01:53] Daughters of
[2:01:54] God reminding us of our
[2:01:58] position calling Hearts to the
[2:02:01] realization of whether or not they have
[2:02:05] received the necessary change of
[2:02:10] administration or so much so to we that
[2:02:13] when things would arise within their
[2:02:18] lives this is where the Prophet speaks
[2:02:21] of such a difference between he says
[2:02:23] sometimes and he said it multiple
[2:02:25] messages he said I've wondered why is
[2:02:27] there sometimes there's people that are
[2:02:28] up here on the housetop and then they're
[2:02:30] down in the valley now he wasn't talking
[2:02:32] about going through things but he's
[2:02:33] saying sometimes here they are man
[2:02:35] they're a Christian today and then
[2:02:37] they're you know just out just wondering
[2:02:39] the next day he said what is it that
[2:02:42] would be difference cuz you meet some
[2:02:44] people and they're like on the they're
[2:02:47] on the housetop seemingly every day
[2:02:50] maybe they're not all together when we
[2:02:52] look at it and say ma they must not have
[2:02:55] anything going on their life no it's
[2:02:56] they have a hidden source of joy in
[2:03:00] their life by a new
[2:03:03] Administration to where when Gloom would
[2:03:05] surround us the lights of the Stars
[2:03:08] would grow dim the lights of the
[2:03:10] candlesticks would be blown out as
[2:03:12] though in our spirit things would become
[2:03:15] clouded but we have a different
[2:03:18] Administration in our lives we have a
[2:03:23] strength
[2:03:25] within the joy of the Lord to know that
[2:03:28] we have passed from Death unto life Lord
[2:03:31] I pray this morning if there would be
[2:03:34] one that would be here under the sound
[2:03:36] of my voice Lord that would be able to
[2:03:39] say in that way
[2:03:41] Lord I Surrender my
[2:03:44] weakness I Surrender Lord my first birth
[2:03:48] Lord I've tried I've made many attempts
[2:03:52] but Lord I realize I need a different
[2:03:53] Administration in my life Lord I don't
[2:03:56] need mental exercises Lord I need divine
[2:04:00] revelation oh God let me seek Calvary in
[2:04:04] full view Lord let there come Lord a
[2:04:07] real Administration by the baptism of
[2:04:10] the Holy Ghost into my life that'll give
[2:04:13] me power to
[2:04:15] subdue my
[2:04:19] enemy granted Lord
[2:04:23] I pray that you would help
[2:04:25] us help every one of us that are
[2:04:27] gathered here

[2:05:20] that sister there might have been other
[2:05:22] sisters

[2:27:18] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:27:21] [Music]
[2:27:25] Hallelujah you know that little
[2:27:28] sister that we referred to
[2:27:33] today I want you just to think about
[2:27:35] that for a minute of how that God could
[2:27:38] have just looked down on her and
[2:27:40] said stay that way you became hottie I
[2:27:44] healed you once I delivered
[2:27:47] you but aren't you glad
[2:27:50] some weeks ago as we were ministering on
[2:27:53] this brother BR
[2:27:55] says I'm glad he's not
[2:27:58] hottie to where he would go down he he
[2:28:00] talks about Rosella Griffin God came
[2:28:03] down in that meeting and delivered her
[2:28:04] of her need aren't you glad that he
[2:28:07] doesn't come down and he could get on
[2:28:09] his high horse but you know what Pride
[2:28:12] don't belong to God we looked at it the
[2:28:15] other time I don't know if it was the
[2:28:16] last time we were together or whatever
[2:28:17] more but there's a certain element of
[2:28:19] certain things of of of with pride that
[2:28:21] we can look at that we know did not come
[2:28:23] from God but instead God would write in
[2:28:26] in such
[2:28:28] humility and such
[2:28:30] Authority and so take over in that
[2:28:35] situation I'm glad that he came to me
[2:28:37] like
[2:28:39] that because what I read here of this
[2:28:41] little
[2:28:42] sister every one of us could put our
[2:28:44] name right there no matter what the
[2:28:47] situation has been somewhere along the
[2:28:49] line now you know what as I sit right
[2:28:52] here and the Lord would take us through
[2:28:53] that what was it what was that part of
[2:28:56] hottie that she got I don't know you
[2:28:58] know as the Lord was just bringing that
[2:28:59] today he's just fitting those things to
[2:29:02] our
[2:29:03] life but you know what it was more
[2:29:05] important than to have some certain
[2:29:07] thing of she did this or she did this
[2:29:09] she that you know what's more important
[2:29:11] is to realize how to keep it away that's
[2:29:14] what's more important stay sweet and
[2:29:17] humble and Jesus will be with you
[2:29:20] that's what's more important you see
[2:29:23] when God deals with us on these things
[2:29:25] it isn't that he's asking us somehow to
[2:29:27] just oh if I could just muster up enough
[2:29:30] strength no that's the problem our
[2:29:33] strength our
[2:29:35] strength we need his
[2:29:37] [Music]
[2:29:38] strength but his strength it manifests
[2:29:42] itself remember with Aaron's Rod it was
[2:29:45] dead but when he got in the presence of
[2:29:48] the
[2:29:49] Lord it budded blossomed and bore
[2:29:53] almonds where in his
[2:29:57] presence that's the
[2:30:00] key cuz we could go out of here and
[2:30:02] listen brother BR would say it many
[2:30:03] different times when he would come to
[2:30:05] the end of the Statue of a perfect man
[2:30:07] and he said I raised both of my hands
[2:30:09] before this congregation and I
[2:30:11] pledge myself before God and this
[2:30:14] congregation that I will not cease until
[2:30:16] I see every one of these virtues flowing
[2:30:19] freely through my
[2:30:22] life and pledges are wonderful
[2:30:26] things and he'll draw us to that place
[2:30:29] you know in our lives it's a wonderful
[2:30:30] thing for us to say
[2:30:31] Lord I need to be closer and I want to
[2:30:35] be closer that's a wonderful things
[2:30:37] friends don't ever despise that it's
[2:30:40] it's a wonderful thing but you know what
[2:30:43] the where all that comes about where
[2:30:45] those pledges can become reality is just
[2:30:48] simply entertaining his presence
[2:30:51] like when Abraham when they came to his
[2:30:53] tent door Abraham said sit down right
[2:30:56] here we're we're going to go get
[2:30:57] something for you right it's like you go
[2:31:00] over to somebody's house I could walk
[2:31:01] into your house and you say Hey Brother
[2:31:04] Sammy don't don't run away come sit down
[2:31:07] here you can have my chair you want
[2:31:09] something to drink want some coffee you
[2:31:11] want a piece of apple pie now you're
[2:31:13] talking my language you know what you're
[2:31:15] trying to do you're trying to entertain
[2:31:17] me yes you know what it is maybe there's
[2:31:19] a just you just you're thankful to see
[2:31:22] somebody maybe it didn't so necessarily
[2:31:24] me but you're just glad to see somebody
[2:31:25] and you say hey sit down you see the
[2:31:29] whole the whole thing is is to entertain
[2:31:32] him and
[2:31:34] Satan knows if we entertain the angel of
[2:31:38] the Lord things
[2:31:40] happen and that's why he'll try to get
[2:31:43] us to entertain so many other things
[2:31:46] he'll try to get so many other things on
[2:31:48] our on our mind
[2:31:50] but see the real the real reality God's
[2:31:53] not looking for you to be so strong as a
[2:31:55] person man if I could be like no no you
[2:31:58] don't have to be like nobody else just
[2:31:59] entertain him entertain the angel of the
[2:32:03] Lord be like Gideon wait right here wait
