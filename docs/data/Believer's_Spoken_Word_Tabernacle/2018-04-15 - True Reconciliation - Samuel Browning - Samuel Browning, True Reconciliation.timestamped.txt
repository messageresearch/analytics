[45:34] granted Lord in the name of the Lord
[45:38] Jesus Christ amen
[45:43] amen let's look into the word here this
[45:46] morning Matthew chapter 3 I want to
[45:50] probably on the prayer request no doubt
[45:54] was mentioned
[45:56] regarding the passing of
[45:58] sister gomez's mother and we want we
[46:02] certainly want to remember them in
[46:04] prayer was there yesterday in the
[46:07] evening there with them
[46:10] just about a few hours before she had
[46:12] passed had passed on and you know what a
[46:16] great comfort it is is where
[46:20] with with sister Gomez's mother
[46:24] you know she was very much a Catholic
[46:27] all of her life but here in the latter
[46:30] part of her life you know sometimes we
[46:34] just don't know how God has everything
[46:37] orchestrated and you know I think back
[46:41] you know to the moment I don't mean to
[46:43] keep you standing but I think back to
[46:47] where you remember it was at about four
[46:49] or five years ago she came over here on
[46:50] the boat her mother she actually
[46:53] thought they were gonna lose her and
[46:56] they couldn't fly her they had to bring
[46:59] her over on a boat you remember that is
[47:00] about four or five years ago I my time
[47:02] frames are all kind of off a little bit
[47:04] but that was about that that amount of
[47:06] time and when she came over here you
[47:09] know here she is with you know and you
[47:11] know with brother and sister Gomez and
[47:14] over that time you know they just had
[47:16] began to further express to her and how
[47:20] that she in her heart and that how the
[47:23] Lord touched her life to where that she
[47:25] embraced the Lord Jesus Christ as her
[47:29] Lord and Savior so much so that see many
[47:33] of you you know the backgrounds from
[47:34] things of which that you've come from
[47:37] the Catholicism to even where when there
[47:40] were different ones that even last year
[47:42] it wasn't even a year ago some were
[47:44] still they started to bring in from
[47:46] different parts of the family start to
[47:49] bring in rosaries and different things
[47:50] to her and she looked at them when they
[47:53] brought him in and she says I don't
[47:55] believe in that
[47:56] she said I believe in the Lord Jesus
[47:57] Christ amen
[48:02] you know and that's that's just so
[48:05] wonderful in
[48:06] you know brother ray I think of your
[48:08] mother I think of that as well you know
[48:11] and to God be the glory
[48:13] you know sometimes we we're wanting to
[48:18] see them to turn to truth but I'll tell
[48:22] you this right here the greatest witness
[48:23] that you and I have is the witness of
[48:26] his life in us and just be ready God
[48:29] prepares you and you and I hope prepare
[48:31] us maybe just for just a moment and I we
[48:34] don't know when that moment is but God
[48:36] is working he's working he's not out of
[48:38] sync he's working and I just I think God
[48:41] for that was with all my heart because
[48:44] even when they tried to do it even even
[48:47] here just recently again bringing her
[48:49] rosaries and the other things like that
[48:51] she said I don't want that here
[48:54] [Laughter]
[48:56] then that wonderful
[48:59] amen you know even how the Prophet made
[49:03] it so clear to us he says to where if
[49:06] you have he said he said you had to take
[49:08] a Catholic person he said a Catholic man
[49:11] a woman he said but if they're trusting
[49:12] in the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior
[49:16] not in the church they're saved I
[49:19] kind of jumped there just a moment you
[49:22] see they can they can trust in him as
[49:24] their Savior now there's some things
[49:26] that doesn't change it doesn't move
[49:27] places to the election but even when you
[49:30] take
[49:31] individuals that can be in other places
[49:34] they might be under a Lutheran title
[49:36] Baptist title Pentecostal title but if
[49:38] they're trusting in the Lord Jesus
[49:41] Christ as their Savior they're saved
[49:45] there say then that wonderful to me
[49:48] that's to me that's just glorious I I've
[49:52] said this all the time if all I can do
[49:54] on with on the job if I can fellowship
[49:56] with someone maybe they don't see what
[49:57] we see but if we can all we can do is
[49:59] fellowship on salvation that to me is
[50:01] not all we can do I can shout on that I
[50:05] can rejoice on that and then if there's
[50:08] something starts stirring in their heart
[50:10] for a time God will prepare that amen in
[50:13] the Lord good
[50:14] amen amen so good to be with each and
[50:17] every one I'm not trying to keep you
[50:18] standing it's just good to see you all
[50:20] amen I love you I really appreciate you
[50:24] amen nope no other group of people I'd
[50:26] rather minister to than you all I love
[50:30] you amen I really love you oh man
[50:36] I'll go other places and go other places
[50:38] the minister but the whole time I'm
[50:40] thinking about you all
[50:42] and that's the truth so well we
[50:46] certainly want to just look on into the
[50:48] word and
[50:50] Matthew chapter 3
[50:53] verse 11 is what I'd like to start
[50:56] and we'll read just a few verses of
[50:59] scripture
[51:05] verse 11
[51:07] and I indeed baptize you with water unto
[51:11] repentance but he that cometh after me
[51:15] is mightier than I whose shoes I am not
[51:20] worthy to bear he shall baptize you with
[51:25] the Holy Ghost and with fire
[51:27] whose fan is in his hand and he will
[51:31] thoroughly purge his floor and gather
[51:34] his wheat into the garner but he will
[51:37] burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire
[51:38] I can just stop there for a moment here
[51:41] is a prophetic ministry john is
[51:44] identifying who he is his place in the
[51:48] word and he's also
[51:50] pointing out that there's one who is
[51:53] coming even among us he's mightier than
[51:57] I then John breaks into the next next
[52:00] scripture and I say John is the Spirit
[52:02] of God moving on him because the
[52:04] fulfillment of this word it will lead to
[52:07] this very
[52:09] placing in verse 12 whose fan is in his
[52:12] hand he will thoroughly purge his floor
[52:14] gather his wheat into the garner but he
[52:16] will burn up the chaff with unquenchable
[52:18] fire we're living in the time in the day
[52:21] when that scripture is to be fulfilled
[52:22] but see the Spirit of God is even
[52:25] issuing in there because there's a
[52:27] completion to this work
[52:33] then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan
[52:37] unto John to be baptized of him
[52:40] but John forbade him saying I have need
[52:43] to be baptized of thee and comest out to
[52:46] me and Jesus answering said unto Him
[52:49] suffer it to be so now for thus it
[52:51] becometh us to fulfill all righteousness
[52:53] then he suffered him and Jesus when he
[52:57] was baptized went up straightway out of
[52:59] the water and lo the heavens were opened
[53:01] unto him and he saw the Spirit of God
[53:03] descending like a dove and lighting upon
[53:06] him and lo a voice from heaven saying
[53:08] this is my beloved Son in whom I am well
[53:13] pleased
[53:15] amen may God bless his word bless you as
[53:19] you're being seated this morning
[53:21] I'd like to
[53:23] to speak here for a few moments
[53:29] on
[53:31] true reconciliation
[53:33] and I just want to just deal with that
[53:35] word just in a a part of it right now
[53:39] because
[53:41] that word to be reconciled if we just
[53:46] look at the definition just for a few
[53:48] moments here to
[53:50] reconcile completely that's that's the
[53:53] one meaning to reconcile completely to
[53:56] reconcile back again so if it's back
[53:59] again then it shows there was a former
[54:03] there was already a place there was
[54:06] already a place where we were reconciled
[54:11] or brought to our already together so to
[54:15] reconcile was to bring back to reconcile
[54:18] back again bring back to a former state
[54:22] of harmony
[54:24] so if you just think of this let me just
[54:27] give you a few examples so maybe you'll
[54:29] see the thought of it where we want to
[54:31] go that when you look at to be
[54:35] reconciled and you take for example just
[54:38] opening up in Genesis one where that the
[54:41] earth itself was covered over with
[54:43] darkness its void its without form
[54:47] but here God says let there be light so
[54:52] he sends forth a word and the word that
[54:54] he sends forth is a word of
[54:57] reconciliation
[54:59] it's a word to bring the earth
[55:03] back from from a state of darkness of
[55:07] where there's no form and it's void to
[55:10] bring back and so there first must be a
[55:13] word that goes forth first God will not
[55:17] do anything outside of his word but God
[55:22] will speak his word and within that word
[55:25] there is the authority the creative
[55:28] power of God for God's creative will to
[55:32] come to pass every one of us in our life
[55:35] we want God's will and
[55:37] yet where you and I find our struggle is
[55:43] where many of the times is trying to
[55:46] look at things and then trying to make
[55:48] things happen either by our own feelings
[55:50] our own desires and yet it's nothing
[55:54] that you and I can make happen it's not
[55:57] something that God wants our strength to
[56:01] make it happen but our strength is to
[56:04] yield to him that he can bring it to
[56:07] past
[56:08] is that okay it's yielding to him that's
[56:12] that's the whole part as the strength is
[56:14] the yielding yielding to him that he
[56:17] then by his word it's his creative will
[56:20] so you find the earth here's the earth
[56:24] when the Spirit of God begins to move
[56:27] upon the earth it is reconciling the
[56:31] earth unto
[56:32] himself to that former state of harmony
[56:37] but yet the Spirit of God going out and
[56:39] moving is not the reconciling buddy it
[56:42] leads to full reconciliation to where
[56:47] that the earth itself that where the the
[56:50] actual dividing of the heavens above
[56:53] beneath to where that even the dividing
[56:56] of the waters of the land all of that is
[56:58] part of the consoling part of it but yet
[57:02] even in those dividing of things it's
[57:04] not the reconciling but then when the
[57:07] earth it's south here the seeds begin to
[57:10] come up and you begin to see different
[57:12] plants taking form you begin to see the
[57:14] botany life then you begin to see the
[57:16] animal life and yet still it's not fully
[57:19] to the place of full reconciliation but
[57:22] yet then when it comes to the place here
[57:25] one in the image of the one doing the
[57:28] brooder of the brooding the one stands
[57:30] there in the image upon the earth of the
[57:32] one doing the brooding then God places
[57:34] this man into a body of flesh and there
[57:39] he places him in the garden and here you
[57:42] have a work that began in reconciling
[57:44] and now the earth itself here here in a
[57:47] place of full reconciliation it is a
[57:50] process that goes on it's just like let
[57:54] me give maybe a another simple example
[57:57] when you take the word that was sent
[58:00] down to Egypt and the word went down
[58:03] there and when God sent Moses with the
[58:06] word and that was I will bring you into
[58:09] a land that floweth with milk and honey
[58:11] that was the full reconciliation
[58:15] but there had to be a message that would
[58:18] go down there a word that was speaking
[58:21] of this and this was the fulfillment of
[58:23] it but there had to be a word that would
[58:26] go down there and begin to deal with the
[58:28] hearts of the people here the lamb comes
[58:31] forth in that time then you find them
[58:33] coming out and walking in the wilderness
[58:35] and many that came out from under the
[58:38] bondage of Egypt they begin to walk out
[58:41] in the wilderness in a very short amount
[58:43] of time they begin to complain they
[58:46] begin to look at things and they and
[58:48] eventually we know even where it led to
[58:51] that there were people who settled in
[58:53] that Transjordan or the the tide of
[58:56] Jordan that was not even the promise
[58:58] they saddled there what they failed to
[59:01] grasp is that message had a for final
[59:05] fulfillment or a full reconciliation to
[59:09] take them from bondage and place them
[59:12] into the land of inheritance so there's
[59:16] a full reconciliation those who just
[59:19] stopped in the wilderness we're not
[59:21] fully reconciled but a full
[59:23] reconciliation is to take us from from
[59:27] that condition and all the way back and
[59:29] that's why I say death in our lives
[59:32] those when we have been born in the
[59:34] Spirit of God listen to me now we've
[59:36] been born the Spirit of God your soul
[59:39] and my soul has been fully reconciled to
[59:43] God and with that promise moving in us
[59:46] it pulsates within us to know that there
[59:50] shall be a redemption of the body
[59:54] this is not just where we're stopping
[59:57] we're happy we're glad we're thankful
[1:00:00] but our happiness our joy it goes beyond
[1:00:04] all the things of this earth because
[1:00:06] there's enough around us there's enough
[1:00:09] things that just to get us down and to
[1:00:12] try to pull us away from the real focus
[1:00:15] and the real purpose but thanks be to
[1:00:18] God the real happiness the real joy in
[1:00:21] our life is that to know that what he
[1:00:24] has started he'll finish
[1:00:27] that I'm going somewhere
[1:00:30] this is just a journey all of these
[1:00:32] things all the way through it's just
[1:00:34] part of the journey
[1:00:37] so when we look at this with the
[1:00:40] Ministry of John
[1:00:42] this is something just some some time
[1:00:46] ago about a month ago I just was so
[1:00:48] drawn to this just in prayer one day I
[1:00:51] began to look at this word this word is
[1:00:54] laid on me heavy for for over a year on
[1:00:56] reconciliation and I began to look at it
[1:00:59] and I think of when I look at this this
[1:01:01] whole setting of John see John's
[1:01:04] ministry you see here the Messiah coming
[1:01:07] you see a great parallel
[1:01:09] in the hour we're coming you know this
[1:01:11] is one thing that the the message of the
[1:01:13] hour has has brought to you and I to
[1:01:17] where we're not reading the Bible as a
[1:01:19] textbook we're not reading it as a book
[1:01:23] of history but we see it as a book of
[1:01:25] prophecy
[1:01:27] let me just say it like this every
[1:01:30] believer in every age they have also
[1:01:33] looked at this book as a book of
[1:01:35] prophecy
[1:01:36] because they themselves were a partaker
[1:01:39] of that same life that you and I or a
[1:01:42] partaker of
[1:01:45] so they were looking they were waiting
[1:01:47] they were walking by revelation and
[1:01:50] waiting on these things to happen there
[1:01:53] was something moved within their life to
[1:01:55] let them know that there is coming a
[1:01:58] time there is going indeed to be a
[1:02:00] rapture Paul was looking forward to that
[1:02:03] rapture Paul could say though though we
[1:02:06] we who are alive and remain we shall not
[1:02:08] hinder nor prevent the coming of the
[1:02:10] Lord in every age they look for his
[1:02:14] coming
[1:02:14] they live for his coming
[1:02:17] they did not live in a passive life
[1:02:21] there were things listened just in this
[1:02:23] age the the people who lived in the
[1:02:26] previous ages they had to endure all the
[1:02:30] pressures that came along with that age
[1:02:32] but God gave them his word of promise
[1:02:36] and that word of promise held within it
[1:02:40] the life and the strength to be able to
[1:02:43] bring them to overcome and they overcame
[1:02:47] by the very life of Christ himself that
[1:02:51] was issued into their lives through the
[1:02:54] ministry that God had given in that time
[1:02:57] they gave that word three eminence and
[1:03:00] they were over comers and part of the
[1:03:04] bride in that day
[1:03:09] hallelujah
[1:03:12] so when we look at this a parallel this
[1:03:15] hour you find that what was taking place
[1:03:18] here
[1:03:20] in the Ministry of John it was a great
[1:03:23] reconciliation taking place here
[1:03:26] this was a time that God was desiring to
[1:03:31] come to to where that God could get back
[1:03:35] inside of man the where he could come
[1:03:38] and dwell inside of man I
[1:03:41] wanted to say it like this not just
[1:03:43] dwell in a mortal body
[1:03:45] but he wanted to dwell in his word his
[1:03:49] word that he has sold in mortal bodies
[1:03:52] God dwells in his word is that right
[1:03:54] that's why the mystery of even the
[1:03:58] outpouring of the Holy Spirit that here
[1:04:01] the Holy Spirit can fall upon all flesh
[1:04:03] but yet the Holy Spirit is sent for the
[1:04:06] servants and his handmaids which those
[1:04:09] that are part of the word that the
[1:04:11] Spirit of God comes and quickens that
[1:04:13] word that soul than is laying within you
[1:04:17] and I and Christ is dwelling in the very
[1:04:19] midst of our life to give order to
[1:04:23] everything else
[1:04:25] are you with me
[1:04:28] and by that authority by that authority
[1:04:33] within us that gives us the strength to
[1:04:36] subdue our spirit and it gives us the
[1:04:39] strength to subdue our flesh
[1:04:45] it's a parallel our here we are the
[1:04:48] great reconciling what a time that took
[1:04:50] place when here the Lord Jesus in this
[1:04:53] moment he walks down to the river of
[1:04:55] Jordan
[1:04:56] think about how the Prophet would place
[1:05:00] this over and over in the message of
[1:05:02] lamb and the Dove and I'm just going to
[1:05:03] be referring to many of these places
[1:05:05] brother Branham he's standing there he's
[1:05:07] getting ready to preach on the wings of
[1:05:09] a snow-white dove and brother one of the
[1:05:11] brothers there within the Assembly at
[1:05:13] Shreveport had said brother Branham you
[1:05:16] remember the messages you preached on
[1:05:17] lamb and a dove and you know I'm the
[1:05:19] dove and the lamb and he said I guess
[1:05:21] you're with your schedule you're too
[1:05:22] busy to to preach on messages like that
[1:05:25] and the Prophet said when I get away
[1:05:27] from that I've gotten away from my
[1:05:30] message
[1:05:32] you see it didn't diminish all of those
[1:05:35] things were pointing to the place that
[1:05:37] in order for a uniting to take place
[1:05:40] there must be things that are alike
[1:05:45] it must be things that are alike human
[1:05:49] hell God represented himself as a dove
[1:05:51] and he represented his son on earth as a
[1:05:54] lamb it's showing that meekness will
[1:05:57] only come and dwell with meekness I'm
[1:06:00] gonna ask you a question here how in the
[1:06:03] world could you and I make ourselves me
[1:06:06] how in the world could you and I produce
[1:06:10] in ourselves something that's acceptable
[1:06:13] the question is we didn't do that
[1:06:16] but the Spirit of God drawing upon our
[1:06:20] life he knows what is laying down there
[1:06:24] and so this Holy Spirit the purifier the
[1:06:28] age of the Lord moving out begins to
[1:06:31] move upon our lives and draw out of our
[1:06:34] lives what's needed in order for that
[1:06:38] union and it's just simply us submitting
[1:06:42] to the predestinated plan of Almighty
[1:06:45] God and if it's just that simple and
[1:06:49] it's just that great then that is the
[1:06:51] same way from henceforth it's us
[1:06:54] submitting to the predestinated plan of
[1:06:58] Almighty God
[1:07:00] who glory be to God so it's not our
[1:07:03] ingenuity our work at our our
[1:07:06] orchestration of this this bride is not
[1:07:09] a manhandled bride this bride is is is
[1:07:13] his Christ's own body it's the body of
[1:07:16] the Lord Jesus Christ it's all
[1:07:17] everything that he's said in and and how
[1:07:19] that he's orchestrated all this all you
[1:07:22] and I are we are actors being a part of
[1:07:24] that word but being a part of that word
[1:07:26] we and ourselves don't even have the
[1:07:28] right means act it out but the option
[1:07:31] the inspiration comes of even how to act
[1:07:34] it out within this age and it's all
[1:07:37] Christ Himself getting glory to himself
[1:07:39] I
[1:07:42] think this is a very great thing
[1:07:45] when I look at this hour a howl that
[1:07:48] things must be alike
[1:07:51] there couldn't be one thing that would
[1:07:53] be on a life remember that dove was not
[1:07:55] set to settle down upon the lamb brother
[1:07:58] Ram many times he'll go over and say if
[1:08:00] the lamb had had been like a wolf in
[1:08:02] head snarled like a wolf and all of
[1:08:04] those things he said he couldn't have
[1:08:06] sat down on there so you see it isn't
[1:08:08] the Holy Spirit is not the Dove of God
[1:08:11] is not just someone who's overriding our
[1:08:14] will because we still have free more
[1:08:17] agency but remember the choice that you
[1:08:20] and I make is not a choice as though
[1:08:23] we're making a choice but it is God it's
[1:08:26] a reflection of a choice he made it's
[1:08:30] not our desire the Prophet says that
[1:08:33] throughout the message in regarding
[1:08:35] election it's not your desire it wasn't
[1:08:40] Abraham's desire it was God's choosing
[1:08:44] what God chose he knew the desire you
[1:08:48] had within you but that desire was
[1:08:51] already sold there and it's up to him to
[1:08:54] make a way for that desire to come forth
[1:08:57] Oh
[1:08:59] glory be to God so when we're looking at
[1:09:03] this place of it here we find that it is
[1:09:06] God Himself moving the bringing this
[1:09:10] place bringing it all to a place I like
[1:09:13] on the scripture says then came Jesus
[1:09:16] here's the Lord Jesus here he was right
[1:09:18] among them
[1:09:20] he was right among them but at a certain
[1:09:24] part you know it's almost like you're in
[1:09:26] a symphony and a certain thing is wrong
[1:09:28] you know you're waiting somebody's
[1:09:29] telling you do it at this time and doing
[1:09:31] it this part I remember one time when I
[1:09:33] wasn't in the player whatever more I
[1:09:35] didn't like getting before people I
[1:09:37] still don't but they said run the lights
[1:09:39] for this play so I had this little thing
[1:09:41] and I go Lord when do I turn the red
[1:09:43] lights on window I turn these back
[1:09:44] lights on and it probably got better
[1:09:46] gadgets now to run those lights but I
[1:09:48] was looking at this sheet of this play
[1:09:50] you know and I'm just hoping I get the
[1:09:52] lights right when this one speaks red
[1:09:54] lights on in back row and
[1:09:57] see I'm looking at a cue
[1:10:00] I'm not just up there flipping lights
[1:10:02] green and blue and red and whatever more
[1:10:04] I've got to look at a script and the
[1:10:07] reality is if not for the Holy Spirit
[1:10:11] even looking at the script we missed
[1:10:14] what the script wants us to do
[1:10:17] that's why it's so necessary that our
[1:10:20] eyes we sing that song keep your eyes
[1:10:23] turn your eyes upon Jesus that's
[1:10:25] absolutely the truth we have to stay
[1:10:27] focused on him because he's the one who
[1:10:30] wrote the script who is the script and
[1:10:32] we're a part of the script so we need
[1:10:34] his leadership in the script
[1:10:40] so here here is standing here's the
[1:10:42] point then cometh Jesus
[1:10:44] he's led by the spirit to this place to
[1:10:47] this moment for this time
[1:10:51] the Bible you know here it says
[1:10:55] winning when he comes when he comes the
[1:10:58] Bible says in Malachi 3 verse 1 behold I
[1:11:01] will send my messenger and he shall
[1:11:05] prepare the way before me this was the
[1:11:07] Ministry of John the Baptist another
[1:11:09] part in the scripture that's identified
[1:11:12] you see here's a part here there's a
[1:11:15] part in Isaiah write all of these parts
[1:11:18] it looks like they're all scattered but
[1:11:20] when God gets ready to fulfill them God
[1:11:23] assembles the word that is ordained for
[1:11:27] a moment and that's where the believers
[1:11:30] they rest in the Lord God who is
[1:11:34] revealing and vindicating his word
[1:11:37] that's our rest
[1:11:41] so here he brings these scriptures
[1:11:43] together
[1:11:44] here he is John's place now listen it
[1:11:47] wasn't enough for John just to read this
[1:11:50] no doubt John like you or me what could
[1:11:53] he read through these things but yet out
[1:11:56] there in that time when he's out there
[1:11:58] with God in the desert these scriptures
[1:12:01] had to be quickened to him they had to
[1:12:04] be more than just something that was
[1:12:06] rehearsed he had to have more than just
[1:12:08] what his daddy Zacharias or Elizabeth of
[1:12:12] even what they would say to him it's not
[1:12:14] that he had to have another message that
[1:12:16] it was the same God had to quicken this
[1:12:19] to John so that John might see his
[1:12:22] position in the world
[1:12:26] hallelujah it was necessary for that
[1:12:31] glory then the Bible goes on to say and
[1:12:34] the Lord look at this and the Lord whom
[1:12:37] you seek
[1:12:38] shall suddenly come to his temple
[1:12:43] even the messenger of the Covenant who
[1:12:47] is the messenger of the Covenant Jesus
[1:12:49] Christ it's the angel of the Lord the
[1:12:52] same one the same one who brewed in the
[1:12:54] beginning same God that same God
[1:12:58] changing for these the messenger of the
[1:13:01] Covenant hey man is that right and here
[1:13:05] he is this one you're seeking after he
[1:13:07] shall suddenly come to his temple
[1:13:12] we know that he could not it could not
[1:13:15] come by way of a sexual birth we
[1:13:17] understand that but when we look at that
[1:13:20] why did it have to be a virgin birth
[1:13:22] because it must be a body that is
[1:13:26] separate of blood that is separate from
[1:13:29] what has already been it cannot listen
[1:13:33] to me now it cannot come under the
[1:13:36] inspiration that fell in the beginning
[1:13:39] where Satan through the tool of the
[1:13:42] serpent he enticed Eve in deception to
[1:13:47] give herself and then here you have a
[1:13:49] Cain coming for
[1:13:51] every one of us this is why David could
[1:13:54] say we were born and said shaped in
[1:13:57] iniquity there's got to be inspiration
[1:14:01] come that it's not inspiration like that
[1:14:04] but it will take and produce - what is
[1:14:08] needed is the virgin birth a body that
[1:14:11] God Himself can come down in his own
[1:14:15] body
[1:14:16] be able to redeem you and I back to
[1:14:20] himself because we belong to him we were
[1:14:24] always his
[1:14:28] even when you and I were in the world or
[1:14:31] maybe you were just sitting in a in a
[1:14:33] church pew even like I was I still
[1:14:35] belong to him but just sitting around
[1:14:38] the message I wasn't reconciled to him
[1:14:40] there has to come a reconciliation there
[1:14:44] must be a call by faith a cleansing by
[1:14:47] the blood and there must be the fire of
[1:14:49] God coming down mental Holy Spirit comes
[1:14:52] and begins to dwell and reflect that
[1:14:55] work then there is a reconciliation that
[1:14:59] is made manifest
[1:15:01] so here the Lord shall suddenly come to
[1:15:04] his temple I want you to catch even the
[1:15:06] phrase of what's mentioned here suddenly
[1:15:09] it speaks of such a a change that's
[1:15:12] going to take place a transition that's
[1:15:14] going to happen he shall suddenly come
[1:15:16] to his temple
[1:15:18] this here this body I always think of
[1:15:22] how the prophet he places it in future
[1:15:24] home and he takes this event of we're
[1:15:28] here the Lord Jesus here he is walking
[1:15:30] into the water and as he's walking into
[1:15:33] the water to be baptized he said then
[1:15:37] down after the baptism
[1:15:39] here comes the Holy Spirit in the form
[1:15:42] of a dove and he's descending down and
[1:15:45] he's letting it be known that this is my
[1:15:50] part of the earth that I've come to
[1:15:52] redeem now watch this the Holy Spirit
[1:15:55] moved upon the prophets is that right
[1:15:58] the Bible tells us that they they spake
[1:16:02] he spake in the fathers spake in the
[1:16:05] prophets unto the fathers but yet the
[1:16:08] Holy Spirit had never come to a place to
[1:16:12] where it was abiding inside of a vessel
[1:16:16] he couldn't do that Redemption had to
[1:16:19] come and this is where the the the
[1:16:23] direction that the Holy Spirit that was
[1:16:26] given to John upon whom thou shall see
[1:16:28] this spirit descending and
[1:16:32] remaining
[1:16:34] she couldn't just be descending but
[1:16:37] descending and remaining you see what
[1:16:40] that is that's an evidence of the Holy
[1:16:43] Ghost in you
[1:16:45] it descends and it remains
[1:16:50] to work out and fulfill that word that's
[1:16:54] promised it's not just it's not just the
[1:16:58] Holy Spirit coming and then pulling back
[1:16:59] and then coming and pulling back sure
[1:17:02] you you feel times where you don't feel
[1:17:05] his presence but I'm talking about when
[1:17:08] he has come he brings a change within
[1:17:11] your life and he takes up residency in
[1:17:15] the temple of his word that he has sown
[1:17:18] in your life your life has become his
[1:17:22] sanctuary and from the sanctuary he
[1:17:26] gives order and authority to the other
[1:17:29] courts
[1:17:32] so here he shall suddenly come to his
[1:17:36] temple here he's coming to claim
[1:17:38] his body what he and through this body
[1:17:42] he will redeem the rest of the
[1:17:46] attributes so he come to Jesus Jesus
[1:17:49] there was an attribute he come to claim
[1:17:52] that attribute he claimed that and here
[1:17:56] as he goes walking forth now let's this
[1:17:59] transition let's move back here into the
[1:18:02] Ministry here of John looking at this in
[1:18:04] John chapter 1 where they came to John I
[1:18:08] want you to just look at this here just
[1:18:11] for a moment they came to John and they
[1:18:14] begin to ask John who are you
[1:18:17] everybody knew his name
[1:18:19] John that's not what they're asking
[1:18:23] who are you
[1:18:26] what
[1:18:28] character what characteristic where are
[1:18:32] you where is your ministry in the
[1:18:34] scripture
[1:18:38] so here John the Bible says in John 1
[1:18:42] verse 20 and he confessed and denied not
[1:18:45] but confessed I'm not the Christ and
[1:18:47] they asked him what then
[1:18:50] art thou Elijah he said I am NOT
[1:18:54] no wait a minute
[1:18:57] he says he was an Elijah
[1:19:03] he wasn't that Elijah that was to come
[1:19:06] but it was the Spirit of Elias that was
[1:19:09] on him you see the Holy Spirit John is
[1:19:13] catching what they're asking
[1:19:16] this is not John's intellect here this
[1:19:19] is the Holy Spirit what's he doing it's
[1:19:21] positioning the Holy Spirit does not
[1:19:24] breed confusion
[1:19:27] it's letting him know I'm not that
[1:19:30] Elijah
[1:19:32] I'm not that in time ministry
[1:19:38] glory be to God
[1:19:41] and-and-and-and art tell that prophet he
[1:19:44] answered no
[1:19:45] but yet he was the Prophet that was
[1:19:48] spoken of in Isaiah
[1:19:50] he was the Prophet that was broken up in
[1:19:52] Malachi 3 we just read but you see the
[1:19:55] Spirit of God is catching and gleaning
[1:19:58] they were trying to place him in the
[1:20:01] scripture and they're giving this and
[1:20:03] they're giving that but John knows his
[1:20:05] place and the Spirit of God is able to
[1:20:08] discern that and he says I am NOT that
[1:20:11] prophet
[1:20:15] they said unto Him who art thou that we
[1:20:19] may give an answer to them that sin us
[1:20:21] what say it's Dow of die itself here he
[1:20:25] goes he's going to declare his ministry
[1:20:29] he said I am the voice of one crying in
[1:20:34] the wilderness make straight the way of
[1:20:36] the Lord has said the Prophet Isaiah's
[1:20:39] they've asked you know that when they've
[1:20:42] asked before they tried to place him but
[1:20:45] John knows exactly where he's at do you
[1:20:48] see friends they were already they were
[1:20:50] overlooking this promise right here they
[1:20:54] were overlooking and it was a key a very
[1:20:57] key Junction and here John stands there
[1:21:01] because he recognizes who he is so he's
[1:21:04] able to identify himself in the
[1:21:07] scripture how beautiful and I believe
[1:21:10] that with all my heart that we are to
[1:21:12] identify ourselves in the scripture it's
[1:21:15] not us making ourselves something but it
[1:21:18] is the Holy Spirit that divinely
[1:21:21] positionally places you and reveals to
[1:21:24] you who you are you are a part of the
[1:21:28] bride of Jesus Christ a part of the word
[1:21:31] in this hour a believer
[1:21:34] [Applause]
[1:21:37] Alleluia and
[1:21:41] they which were of the Pharisees they
[1:21:46] asked him and said what baptizes thou
[1:21:48] then if thou be not the Christ nor
[1:21:51] Elijah neither that prophet John
[1:21:53] answered them saying i baptize with
[1:21:55] water
[1:21:56] but understandeth one among you whom you
[1:22:00] know not
[1:22:01] he it is who's coming after me is
[1:22:05] preferred before me whose shoe letter I
[1:22:08] am not worthy to loose you see look how
[1:22:10] John John is speaking in his message he
[1:22:14] has already identified there's a change
[1:22:17] coming there don't even recognize who
[1:22:20] John is and even John in the midst of it
[1:22:22] he's identified there's one here who's
[1:22:25] mightier than I
[1:22:27] he's here
[1:22:29] John's ministry is announcing that he's
[1:22:32] here he's mightier than I and he is
[1:22:34] coming he's actually preferred before me
[1:22:39] you see the humility
[1:22:42] he's announcing there as a forerunner
[1:22:46] there's going to be a transition now the
[1:22:49] Bible goes on to say
[1:22:51] it says these things were done in
[1:22:54] Bethabara beyond Jordan where John was
[1:22:56] baptizing the next day John seeth Jesus
[1:22:58] coming unto him and said behold the lamb
[1:23:01] of God which taketh away the sin of the
[1:23:05] world
[1:23:06] see he's identifying
[1:23:10] the very sacrifice he's identifying the
[1:23:15] very body are you with me now he's
[1:23:18] identifying the body
[1:23:20] and he's also identifying the future
[1:23:24] work that will take place in his
[1:23:28] priestly ministry
[1:23:31] amen this is he look what he says this
[1:23:35] is he of whom I said after me cometh a
[1:23:39] man which is preferred before me for he
[1:23:42] was before me and I knew him not but
[1:23:45] that he should be made manifest to
[1:23:47] Israel therefore am I come baptizing
[1:23:51] with water
[1:23:53] John could declare he's here but getting
[1:23:56] them not
[1:24:01] how could he do that because listen John
[1:24:04] his remember where's John resting John's
[1:24:07] resting in the Lord
[1:24:09] see it's not up this is not about all of
[1:24:13] a sudden John's quickened John sees this
[1:24:15] place in the scripture and now John's
[1:24:17] got to make all this happen no God is
[1:24:21] the one working John is just a vessel
[1:24:25] that's the same with you and I it's not
[1:24:28] what you and I got to make happen it's
[1:24:29] God it's God working and performing his
[1:24:33] word
[1:24:34] so John all John had to do is say you
[1:24:37] know what I'm gonna do what he told me
[1:24:39] to do he told me to go stand here he
[1:24:41] told me to baptize and John's not doing
[1:24:43] it just out of mere just something
[1:24:46] mechanical but John recognizes the
[1:24:48] calling there is a need for repentance
[1:24:50] what's it doing it's making a people
[1:24:53] ready for the Messiah and
[1:24:55] John's ministry here it is it's a
[1:24:58] ministry that is that is making a people
[1:25:01] ready he's standing out there and he's
[1:25:04] pointing the people to the word there's
[1:25:06] a need of repentance and there's a
[1:25:10] washing there's a baptism of how these
[1:25:13] baptized them in water washing them
[1:25:15] what's he doing it's preparing the
[1:25:18] people for the Messiah who has to come
[1:25:23] let me tell you something this word that
[1:25:27] God has sent let me just let me just
[1:25:30] just dwell on this a moment
[1:25:34] even leading up to the opening of the
[1:25:36] seals there's a preparation of the word
[1:25:40] making you and I ready I
[1:25:44] want to be very clear and go on record
[1:25:47] we do not do away with what's prior to
[1:25:50] send be a part of where we are in this
[1:25:53] hour where the message itself has taken
[1:25:56] on flesh in the lives of the people he
[1:26:01] was longing for that he was Lord will it
[1:26:04] has it is
[1:26:07] so here John said I knew him not but
[1:26:12] then he should be made manifest in
[1:26:13] Israel therefore I am come baptizing
[1:26:15] with water and John bear record saying I
[1:26:17] solve the spirit descending from heaven
[1:26:20] like a dove and in a boat on him and I
[1:26:22] knew him not but but he that sent me to
[1:26:25] baptize with water the same said unto me
[1:26:28] upon whom thou shalt see the spirit
[1:26:31] descending and remaining on him the same
[1:26:34] as he which baptizeth
[1:26:36] with the Holy Ghost
[1:26:39] did everybody see it there no John saw
[1:26:44] it but you see it was necessary that
[1:26:48] John would see it and when I say it so
[1:26:51] necessary
[1:26:52] God ordained it to be that way
[1:26:54] here they are they these the people have
[1:26:58] been brought John's ministry here apart
[1:27:01] within that a ministry to forerun to
[1:27:03] introduce the coming Messiah that
[1:27:05] ministry was a very critical ministry
[1:27:09] very critical and crucial ministry it
[1:27:13] was calling those people together and
[1:27:16] through that ministry the very Messiah
[1:27:20] would be identified
[1:27:23] and John is standing there and he's
[1:27:26] waiting I don't know him I know he's
[1:27:28] here I know who were he I'm not even
[1:27:30] worthy to unlatch his shoelaces I'm not
[1:27:33] even worried for this and here he comes
[1:27:35] to this place and he tells the Lord
[1:27:37] Jesus I have need to be baptized of you
[1:27:40] and what did the Lord Jesus say suffer
[1:27:43] it to be so it behooves with us become a
[1:27:47] thoughts to fulfill all righteousness
[1:27:50] as the Lamb of God he must be washed
[1:27:53] before he's presented see God's not
[1:27:56] going over all of these orders he was
[1:27:59] the sinless spotless virgin born Lamb of
[1:28:02] God you agree with that he did not have
[1:28:05] to be washed like you and I are washed
[1:28:07] or baptized in his name he didn't have
[1:28:11] that was not why he was baptized he was
[1:28:13] baptized as the sacrifice being being
[1:28:16] made ready to present he was also being
[1:28:19] washed as the coming High Priest
[1:28:22] there was a transition here it was
[1:28:26] Melchizedek now on earth in a flesh body
[1:28:30] this is why the Prophet could say
[1:28:33] Melchizedek was not Jesus Christ but
[1:28:36] Jesus Christ was milk hesitant
[1:28:39] because because Melchizedek when he
[1:28:43] appears to Abraham it was not in a
[1:28:46] virgin born body it was creative but how
[1:28:49] that God in this hour in order to redeem
[1:28:52] us he must come in a virgin born body
[1:28:56] the transition was already there
[1:29:02] our high priest think of this think of
[1:29:05] this the people who were there the
[1:29:08] priests and the high priests
[1:29:10] think what kind of a of an attitude they
[1:29:14] had
[1:29:15] they had no care for the people
[1:29:18] they had no care you say how can you say
[1:29:21] that but the Rev says they would visit
[1:29:22] the widow's house he talks about your
[1:29:25] kind no priest but listen friends all of
[1:29:27] those wonderful flowery things that can
[1:29:29] be done but when they were taking the
[1:29:31] key and shutting up the kingdom they did
[1:29:33] not have the love for the people
[1:29:36] they could not they could not even be
[1:29:39] touched but this high priest
[1:29:43] he could be touched by the feeling of
[1:29:46] their infirmities and that touch was not
[1:29:48] just something that happened within the
[1:29:50] courts of the cavern Akal here he is
[1:29:53] moving under the leadership in the
[1:29:56] direction of redemption he makes his way
[1:29:58] to Samaria and he brings a little woman
[1:30:02] who is beneath all this cloud of
[1:30:04] darkness and gloom and all these things
[1:30:07] said about her life but beneath there is
[1:30:09] a true seed of God an attribute of God a
[1:30:12] redeemable thought of God so what does
[1:30:15] he do he comes and reconciles that
[1:30:17] thought that attribute unto himself
[1:30:21] and when he reconciles and her life is
[1:30:24] changed her life begins to express
[1:30:27] who she really always was
[1:30:31] so what she was living under was a lie
[1:30:38] there was a shadow about her life oh
[1:30:41] there's a lot told on you come on
[1:30:45] somebody Oh somebody's total out on you
[1:30:47] but you see the truth came the person of
[1:30:52] truth Himself came and he broke the lie
[1:30:55] that was around her life and around your
[1:30:59] life and my life
[1:31:01] when the person of truth comes seals are
[1:31:05] broken he's the seal breaker
[1:31:11] hallelujah
[1:31:14] so here John jump makes this declaration
[1:31:18] and
[1:31:19] he says again I want to read this here
[1:31:22] the next day verse 35 John stood and two
[1:31:25] of his disciples and looking upon Jesus
[1:31:27] as he walked now watch his disciples
[1:31:29] have watched what's taken place here in
[1:31:30] the water okay they've they've seen this
[1:31:32] they didn't see the Spirit of God
[1:31:34] descending like a job but John did the
[1:31:37] heavens were opened Hey they had been
[1:31:40] closed off now they're open
[1:31:42] this was the signification to John this
[1:31:45] is him and the next day John see as well
[1:31:50] as his disciples the Bible says the next
[1:31:53] day after after John stood and once you
[1:31:55] watch this in verse 35 and two of his
[1:31:58] disciples looking upon Jesus as he
[1:32:01] walked he says behold the lamb of God
[1:32:04] notice he's already said this once now
[1:32:08] he cries out again behold the lamb of
[1:32:10] God so after he's already introduced the
[1:32:15] Messiah his ministry and the message
[1:32:18] changes there's a transition to where he
[1:32:21] is identifying now what was one time
[1:32:26] prophecy is now in fulfillment
[1:32:30] so he cries out again behold the lamb of
[1:32:33] God now watch this in verse 37 and the
[1:32:38] two disciples heard him speak and they
[1:32:41] followed Jesus
[1:32:45] now no doubt there were many who heard
[1:32:47] him speak
[1:32:49] but there was two that heard him speak
[1:32:55] many heard John but to hurdy
[1:33:00] you said what are you saying I'm talking
[1:33:03] about that they could hear this what an
[1:33:06] event was taking place my I'll tell you
[1:33:08] what great knows out about it you're
[1:33:09] gonna be going to tell me the presence
[1:33:10] of God wasn't around I don't care if
[1:33:12] they didn't see the light the presence
[1:33:14] of God was there that was said that
[1:33:16] listen to me that was the greatest event
[1:33:18] that taken place upon earth when God was
[1:33:21] reconciled to man heavens and earth
[1:33:24] kissed and embraced
[1:33:27] the greatest event you tell me a
[1:33:30] supernatural event tell me inspiration
[1:33:32] was not falling and not striking in that
[1:33:35] hour in loss
[1:33:38] but there was two of them that heard
[1:33:41] what John said and
[1:33:44] when they heard what he said
[1:33:46] honoring what he said help me now he
[1:33:49] spoke the word and them honoring what he
[1:33:52] said they walked with that word and they
[1:33:56] followed Jesus
[1:33:58] they caught the transition
[1:34:02] are you with me John didn't have to
[1:34:04] explain they caught the transition they
[1:34:06] were a part of that transition I
[1:34:10] don't know if you know this or not some
[1:34:14] of you probably do you know there's
[1:34:16] still a group I think it's called
[1:34:17] Madden's I think it's called the
[1:34:19] Madden's modeun ISM that it's a group of
[1:34:22] people that still believe in John's
[1:34:23] baptism and still everything revolves
[1:34:27] around the River Jordan
[1:34:28] yes
[1:34:30] even when we went and invaded Iraq there
[1:34:33] was I can't member how many thousands
[1:34:34] fifty thousand something like that you
[1:34:36] can read this listen um I'm a it's right
[1:34:38] you just punch it on the internet and
[1:34:39] read about it these are people who
[1:34:41] believe
[1:34:42] in that of John the Baptist ministry but
[1:34:45] they've never moved on they built their
[1:34:48] homes they built elder doings around the
[1:34:50] River Jordan and
[1:34:52] they missed what the message was
[1:34:57] it's just something that's it's just
[1:35:00] handed down it's just a it's just a way
[1:35:02] of life it's just a tradition they
[1:35:05] didn't go on they didn't move on they're
[1:35:08] still dwelling within that where
[1:35:10] everything's revolving around John the
[1:35:13] message was not about John
[1:35:16] John was a spokesman and a vessel of
[1:35:20] which it was to be declared but the
[1:35:23] message was not John the message was the
[1:35:26] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:35:28] and John was faithful to that remember
[1:35:31] he had the opportunity are now the
[1:35:33] Christ without thy prophet he had the
[1:35:35] opportunity but he stayed true to who he
[1:35:39] was I
[1:35:45] want you to watch this here and spoken
[1:35:48] words original seed
[1:35:51] how that the Prophet says the messenger
[1:35:55] of Malachi 4
[1:35:57] will appear at God's appointed time we
[1:36:01] are all looking for him we believe he
[1:36:03] will come that's in 1962 that is
[1:36:06] according to his word it will be at the
[1:36:08] end time which it is time now for to see
[1:36:11] it he's declaring this is the time now
[1:36:14] to see this he's declaring this
[1:36:17] he will be correctly dedicated to the
[1:36:21] word as they have always been indicated
[1:36:24] by God's Word and have indicated God
[1:36:27] will vindicate what he preaches to be
[1:36:30] the truth as he did Elijah for it is
[1:36:33] Elijah coming making ready for the Mount
[1:36:36] Zion rapture see making ready for the
[1:36:41] Mount Zion rapture who is ayan it's the
[1:36:46] Church of the Living God the bride of
[1:36:49] Jesus Christ it is the culmination of
[1:36:53] all ages in
[1:36:56] the last days it would be like Lots time
[1:36:59] so these are little checkpoints along
[1:37:02] the way and he lets it be known within
[1:37:06] this here
[1:37:08] but how that God will vindicate
[1:37:11] what he preaches to be the truth
[1:37:15] can I have some more monitors up here my
[1:37:18] voice is literally just straining please
[1:37:20] I
[1:37:21] don't want to bust you all out my voice
[1:37:25] is just really straining right now so
[1:37:27] you pray for me will you
[1:37:29] this is something the Prophet continues
[1:37:32] to lay out for us even in the seals he
[1:37:36] says it must not only be revealed it
[1:37:40] must be
[1:37:41] indicated
[1:37:43] it's God to be vindicated the
[1:37:45] vindication is of his very person Christ
[1:37:50] himself coming and vindicating what he
[1:37:54] has revealed to be the truth
[1:37:57] so it's it's not to infer the
[1:38:00] vindication it cannot just be oh my it
[1:38:03] cannot just be just truth that's given
[1:38:07] out but it must be vindicated
[1:38:12] that's where it falls in our life just
[1:38:15] as God comes and vindicates that to be
[1:38:18] the truth then it draws you and I to
[1:38:22] what God is opening for the Lord to move
[1:38:25] into our life and fully vindicate his
[1:38:29] truth in US and through us
[1:38:33] right at the resurrection of the Lord
[1:38:37] Jesus Christ they didn't know him
[1:38:39] is that right Mary thought he was a
[1:38:42] gardener
[1:38:44] right they thought wherever every
[1:38:47] wherever you laid him and he walked with
[1:38:49] them on the road to Emmaus their eyes
[1:38:51] were holding that they wouldn't know him
[1:38:53] that was done purposely
[1:38:56] that's why Paul could pick it up later
[1:38:59] in his time and say though we have known
[1:39:01] Christ after the flesh henceforth we
[1:39:04] know no man after the flesh
[1:39:08] because it was no longer knowing Jesus
[1:39:11] Christ as the Messiah as Redeemer after
[1:39:15] the flesh I walked with him I talked
[1:39:17] with him think about the Prophet
[1:39:18] emphasizes that in Christ the mystery of
[1:39:20] God revealed he lays on that four
[1:39:22] paragraphs it's not just enough to walk
[1:39:25] with him it's not just enough to walk
[1:39:28] where the promise is that we must be
[1:39:31] partakers of the promise and that
[1:39:34] promise lives inside of you and I and
[1:39:37] you know what you've got a right to ask
[1:39:39] for that you and I have a right when God
[1:39:41] is real making known his word and you
[1:39:44] say brother Samuel sometimes it seems
[1:39:46] like it goes over my head but remember
[1:39:48] the same God is speaking it is the same
[1:39:51] God who desires to open word in our
[1:39:54] lives and it won't be something to that
[1:39:56] he opens that we become more
[1:39:58] knowledgeable but it actually lifts you
[1:40:01] and I in position of what God desires
[1:40:05] for our life and I tell you that lifting
[1:40:09] by the current of the Holy Spirit it
[1:40:11] lifts us above complexes it'll lift us
[1:40:15] above all of the things of this world
[1:40:17] that want to try to get us away from the
[1:40:21] purpose of the hour
[1:40:29] Elijah came there on the mountain he
[1:40:32] began to he began to take stones and
[1:40:34] assemble those stones he didn't go and
[1:40:37] get new stones he took the stones that
[1:40:40] were there
[1:40:41] what was there he brought them together
[1:40:43] he assembled those stones and there came
[1:40:47] order how did the order count
[1:40:50] how did Elijah know what order he was
[1:40:53] doing and according to the word I have
[1:40:57] done all this according to that word
[1:40:59] so the word had declared itself and gave
[1:41:03] direction and within that word to be
[1:41:06] made known these things being in order
[1:41:08] that God
[1:41:10] himself might come down and declare
[1:41:13] himself as the Lord
[1:41:17] notice what Elijah called for not just
[1:41:20] God
[1:41:22] but that that part Lord
[1:41:25] master
[1:41:27] we were chief oversight
[1:41:31] are you with me because the Israelites
[1:41:33] had called bail God
[1:41:37] God let him know when I bring you back
[1:41:39] to myself I will take all the names of
[1:41:43] bail out of your mouth Hosea Hosea and
[1:41:46] you shall in you shall not call me no
[1:41:48] more bail bail means God you shall call
[1:41:52] me no more bail but it was God but it
[1:41:54] was God in the formation of a man's
[1:41:55] thought I
[1:41:57] will remove that
[1:41:59] theological thinking away and you shall
[1:42:02] no more call me bail you shall Misha
[1:42:05] because you were issue from me husband
[1:42:14] here's a transition the prophets letting
[1:42:18] us know and 62 remember even when he
[1:42:20] talks about there's been a settling down
[1:42:21] there's been a cooling down seems like
[1:42:23] nothing's taking place he said
[1:42:25] everything's dying everything it was all
[1:42:28] making me
[1:42:32] wear the brem says his preaching will be
[1:42:35] with the spirit let me just try to get
[1:42:36] through this his preaching will be with
[1:42:40] the spirit and strength line of God's
[1:42:42] Word
[1:42:46] because so much has been called God's
[1:42:49] truth many will misunderstand this true
[1:42:53] messenger
[1:42:55] there's been a lot of things called
[1:42:57] God's truth
[1:43:00] the seventh angel this
[1:43:04] revealing of the word that God had
[1:43:08] promised a visitation in this hour was
[1:43:11] not for a new Bible
[1:43:17] the message books do not replace the
[1:43:20] Bible
[1:43:26] perhaps you've been around I've seen
[1:43:28] people they would carry their Seventh
[1:43:30] Seal book and said this is my Bible
[1:43:31] that's not my Bible but if that is truly
[1:43:37] revealed you'll love your Bible more
[1:43:41] it opens the scriptures what has been
[1:43:45] wrote all the way down
[1:43:50] you see listen it's not people friends
[1:43:53] these are the things for you and I it's
[1:43:55] discerning spirits
[1:43:58] it's the enemy that wants to try to
[1:44:01] divert the focus and the attention let
[1:44:04] me just can I just preach a few moments
[1:44:06] this is where even the trickery then
[1:44:09] even when you had in this time there's
[1:44:11] always been people walking away from the
[1:44:12] message I don't know if you know that
[1:44:14] that's true there always have been there
[1:44:16] were people that back in 70 they wanted
[1:44:19] to throw away their books and everything
[1:44:20] out there's been people doing that this
[1:44:22] is not anything per se new in the sense
[1:44:25] I believe it's a greater culmination of
[1:44:28] those things pointing even into this
[1:44:30] time I believe we're at that time
[1:44:33] you understand what I'm saying there's
[1:44:35] Bruce things even when the internet at
[1:44:37] first came out after Al Gore invented it
[1:44:39] that after it came out some of you'll
[1:44:41] get that tomorrow
[1:44:43] but after it came out there were people
[1:44:45] already saying different things brother
[1:44:48] Brian you remember this there are
[1:44:50] certain things that you could open and
[1:44:51] things like that on a on a web site and
[1:44:53] whatever more those types of things
[1:44:55] where people's always been troubled by
[1:44:57] the cloud and troubled by this and
[1:44:59] troubled by that you know it's what's
[1:45:01] very simple is when if something is
[1:45:03] revealed to you and made known to you
[1:45:06] you simply rest in the reality of it
[1:45:09] when brother Branham identified that
[1:45:11] cloud it said his cloud
[1:45:14] it's God's cloud
[1:45:17] hallelujah and
[1:45:19] here think of God's mercy remember the
[1:45:23] drawing brother Steve had where it was
[1:45:25] traveling from east to west
[1:45:27] right I want you think about it if it
[1:45:31] had kept on boiling and not come back
[1:45:33] for you and I
[1:45:34] it would have bypassed us but notice
[1:45:38] rudram says those great telescopes call
[1:45:42] it the cloud as it was coming in
[1:45:46] and he said when I got there they were
[1:45:48] there waiting on me
[1:45:51] he said that what those telescopes
[1:45:53] didn't catch they didn't catch up catch
[1:45:56] it when it was going
[1:45:58] the angels that formed his wig
[1:46:04] there's always been these the
[1:46:07] controversies and this and that and
[1:46:09] there's always been and you know what
[1:46:11] let me come back to this point that it
[1:46:13] was just so quick into my heart what the
[1:46:14] trick of the devil is is is somehow to
[1:46:18] try to bring people back to a place
[1:46:19] where we got to prove the brother
[1:46:21] branham's Malachi 4 we got to prove his
[1:46:23] losers own ministry of Luke 17 and 30 we
[1:46:25] got to prove its revelations Ted 7
[1:46:27] that's a trick of the enemy you say how
[1:46:29] can that be a trick of the enemy be
[1:46:31] cause his his focus is its to try to
[1:46:34] divert from what God is doing now let me
[1:46:37] tell you something the greatest
[1:46:39] vindication of this message this banner
[1:46:42] that we're under is the life that it is
[1:46:45] producing in you and I and even when you
[1:46:48] don't understand that you're sitting
[1:46:49] here and you say I don't understand at
[1:46:51] all but you know that it's a living
[1:46:53] Christ that's discerning your life and
[1:46:56] he's releasing to you overcoming power
[1:47:00] daily in your life
[1:47:06] when will I understand all this will
[1:47:09] understand that in the times and seasons
[1:47:11] that he has set
[1:47:17] down there were people in John's time
[1:47:25] John said this in
[1:47:27] 1963 John identified he's the one who's
[1:47:32] come
[1:47:34] but over here John in 1964 said
[1:47:38] hey go ask if he's the one or do we look
[1:47:42] for another
[1:47:46] come on somebody
[1:47:49] you know brother Branham preached a
[1:47:51] message Forgotten beatitude
[1:47:53] Forgotten beatitude but them said this
[1:47:55] is a beatitude that's not put in with
[1:47:57] all the rest of them it's tucked away
[1:47:59] over here and brother Brant pulls that
[1:48:02] beatitude out and he begins to go into
[1:48:04] John's thinking he said what it was John
[1:48:08] and there the attitude is blessed is he
[1:48:09] that's not offended in me the last
[1:48:12] person you think would be offended in
[1:48:14] the Lord would be John
[1:48:16] come on but what was John offended what
[1:48:20] what offended means that word offense is
[1:48:23] stumbling
[1:48:26] I'm gonna preach just a little bit you
[1:48:29] said you've been preaching another part
[1:48:30] but I'm preaching alone I'm going
[1:48:31] another side road now y'all with me
[1:48:35] he he comes to this place he's stumbling
[1:48:38] on it because John is looking at I don't
[1:48:41] see happening what was
[1:48:43] I don't see happening his fan is in his
[1:48:45] hand he's just early purchase for you
[1:48:47] see that junction of time for when that
[1:48:49] was to come into place although it was
[1:48:51] absolutely the truth it was absolutely
[1:48:54] right to say it buddy it is reserved for
[1:48:57] a time and for a season and there are
[1:49:00] people that will be upon the earth that
[1:49:02] will move into that part of the
[1:49:04] fulfillment
[1:49:05] but what did Jesus say
[1:49:07] stick around and I want you to go tell
[1:49:12] John what you see see he didn't he
[1:49:15] didn't send John back with John no hold
[1:49:16] on let me get it all together here and
[1:49:18] we'll you'll get your iPad's okay we'll
[1:49:20] download it from the cloud and we'll do
[1:49:22] all this and you know then then you can
[1:49:24] just take it on back to John let let
[1:49:25] John read it let John read over John
[1:49:28] didn't need to read
[1:49:30] but he needed to see
[1:49:34] that's why I'm telling you right now
[1:49:37] don't ever get the thinking in your mind
[1:49:40] that we don't need to see him don't ever
[1:49:43] get to thinking in your mind well we
[1:49:45] don't need miracles God's already
[1:49:47] confirmed the message I'm not talking
[1:49:50] about confirming the message again but
[1:49:52] we're talking about God making it even
[1:49:55] more real and more personal to you and I
[1:49:58] if he's a living God he still does the
[1:50:01] same thing he's the same God yesterday
[1:50:04] today and forever
[1:50:07] hallelujah
[1:50:12] so they went back and they told John
[1:50:14] what they saw you know what that did
[1:50:16] that removed the film from his eye I
[1:50:19] hope you're with me John going down
[1:50:22] there in that if we could say in that
[1:50:24] place of offense John was like that bush
[1:50:26] like the red blur Ram talks about that
[1:50:27] eagle got blown out and that snowstorm
[1:50:29] that stormed and fell into that bush
[1:50:32] that falling in the bush didn't make him
[1:50:34] not an eagle he was still an eagle
[1:50:38] when you've stumbled it's not that
[1:50:41] you're not an eagle when doubt has
[1:50:44] thrived the swirl around your life it
[1:50:47] doesn't mean that you're not an ego
[1:50:51] hallelujah
[1:50:52] you're always an eagle you were born as
[1:50:56] an eagle
[1:50:57] hallelujah mama Eagle came over your way
[1:51:01] and drew you to herself
[1:51:05] sports might come things my tongue but
[1:51:09] as you're down there in the midst of
[1:51:10] that time you'll start hearing all this
[1:51:12] chichi chichi chichi chichi chichi
[1:51:14] chichi
[1:51:15] chichi chichi chichi chichi you see
[1:51:18] where chatter takes place in an earthly
[1:51:21] level
[1:51:23] but that Eagle he looked around he said
[1:51:26] I
[1:51:28] can escape this
[1:51:31] what I do he said his wings and took off
[1:51:34] he didn't try to straighten out the
[1:51:37] squirrel who was doing the chatter
[1:51:39] he didn't try to straighten everything
[1:51:41] out and this one with this one and this
[1:51:44] one that was but the eagle himself he
[1:51:46] said himself there into the heavenlies
[1:51:49] friends this is our victory is in him
[1:51:53] if we get focused on the earth we lose
[1:51:56] sight of the promise and when you lose
[1:51:59] sight of the promise you start all these
[1:52:01] things start entering in in your life
[1:52:03] the frustrations and the hurts be seems
[1:52:06] so great everything seems so great you
[1:52:08] feel so many things but when you can
[1:52:10] just look to him and set your wings
[1:52:12] you'll find sufficient grace to be able
[1:52:16] to soar
[1:52:19] above that kind
[1:52:28] of finish this quote
[1:52:30] [Music]
[1:52:34] because so much has been called
[1:52:38] God's truth by fakers
[1:52:46] many Truman ministers will misunderstand
[1:52:49] that messenger and that did happen
[1:52:54] still does happen I mean think about
[1:52:57] even these things that as we speak about
[1:53:00] how many of these things we spoken about
[1:53:02] over the years and yet there's been
[1:53:04] people that have read these things if
[1:53:05] I'm not him I'm laying a platform for
[1:53:07] him and they feel like the platform is
[1:53:10] for them this is a body ministry
[1:53:18] the profit has come and what then what
[1:53:22] was the profits what was the profits
[1:53:24] message to do let's look at John's
[1:53:27] message John's message us to do what
[1:53:29] introduced the body of the Lord
[1:53:36] this is him this
[1:53:38] is him let me just read this now
[1:53:42] as the endtime prophecies
[1:53:45] will repeat I believe as the forerunner
[1:53:49] came from the wilderness and cried
[1:53:52] behold the lamb of god the second
[1:53:54] forerunner will probably do the same by
[1:53:57] pointing the people to a word born bride
[1:54:03] so the ministry of malachi for
[1:54:08] revelations 10-7 the revealing of luke
[1:54:12] 1730 is to point the people to a word
[1:54:16] born bride
[1:54:20] the body of the lord not just a part of
[1:54:24] the body even though in this age we are
[1:54:28] only a part of the body the building
[1:54:33] that's been going on down through the
[1:54:34] ages is that right but in this closing
[1:54:38] part the scriptures are clear they
[1:54:41] without us should not be made perfect
[1:54:45] it goes with every age that succeeds the
[1:54:49] next age it is Christ working by his
[1:54:52] Spirit through his word drawing a people
[1:54:55] unto himself that he might reflect his
[1:54:59] word through their lives
[1:55:02] but in this time think of it Jeremiah
[1:55:06] was apart Isaiah was apart all of these
[1:55:10] were parts but when he came he was the
[1:55:16] fulfillment
[1:55:17] of it all
[1:55:20] all of these down through the church
[1:55:23] ages has been a part there's been a part
[1:55:26] is that right here everything being a
[1:55:29] part you and I listen to me now here's
[1:55:32] the understanding we're a part we're not
[1:55:34] separate we are apart
[1:55:37] but where we are in that part this is a
[1:55:41] combination of all things to where God
[1:55:45] has brought a body from the feet all the
[1:55:49] way as the Prophet said our place is the
[1:55:52] neck that the head itself might set down
[1:55:56] on the body
[1:55:58] here we are in this lady ocn age but yet
[1:56:02] we've been called out or called up
[1:56:05] higher by the Spirit of Almighty God to
[1:56:09] where the word might have preeminence in
[1:56:12] you and I the word cannot have
[1:56:14] preeminence in a denomination
[1:56:17] that's why it is a domination believe
[1:56:20] this and that's it
[1:56:22] but here a word born body just as John
[1:56:27] could stand there and say behold the
[1:56:29] lamb of God now what's this next part
[1:56:31] here
[1:56:33] the Bride of Christ
[1:56:35] will be pointed to the skies at the
[1:56:39] appearing of Jesus
[1:56:41] so the Bride of Christ
[1:56:44] this word born bride because
[1:56:47] what did Jesus say
[1:56:49] upon this rock I will build my church
[1:56:53] what is that rock who is that rock that
[1:56:57] rock is him the personal revelation of
[1:57:01] who he is
[1:57:05] that's the new birth it's not just I
[1:57:08] know this to be the truth but it's
[1:57:10] Christ himself being personally revealed
[1:57:14] to you and in you
[1:57:17] it changes your life
[1:57:21] it changes your thoughts it changes your
[1:57:27] whole being
[1:57:30] here this is pointing to a word born
[1:57:32] bride this is where wrath this is
[1:57:34] whereas now notice a word born bride a
[1:57:37] body that now
[1:57:40] Christ himself
[1:57:43] the son of man can step inside of his
[1:57:48] body
[1:57:49] and
[1:57:50] be made manifest
[1:58:00] you see I
[1:58:03] may just skip over here just a few
[1:58:06] things and his appearing they'll be
[1:58:09] pointed to the skies at the appearing of
[1:58:11] Jesus we know that coming and appearing
[1:58:14] are two different things
[1:58:17] there right
[1:58:19] there is the literal
[1:58:22] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ that he
[1:58:25] will come in a literal physical corporal
[1:58:28] body
[1:58:30] is that right
[1:58:33] but we also know that in order to be a
[1:58:36] part of that physical coming there is
[1:58:40] that part within that that is his coming
[1:58:43] by his word his presence his fullness
[1:58:48] that must come and it brings a people
[1:58:52] into that place of readiness which we
[1:58:55] know to be his appearing he has appeared
[1:59:00] to us
[1:59:02] making himself that appearing is him
[1:59:05] making himself known as the same God
[1:59:08] this is why
[1:59:10] the brother Graham could say over no
[1:59:13] these are not just loose statements well
[1:59:15] brother brown could make a statement of
[1:59:16] people say 10 couldn't God do this and
[1:59:18] can't God do things outside the
[1:59:19] scripture brother M says sure he said
[1:59:22] he's God he can do whatever he wants to
[1:59:24] do he said but to me he says I want to
[1:59:28] stay inside the scriptures
[1:59:30] what you think of this when the Lord
[1:59:33] Jesus raised from the grave when he
[1:59:36] makes himself known by many infallible
[1:59:38] proofs he doesn't appear to them in ways
[1:59:42] that he never that he didn't do the
[1:59:44] first time but he appeared to them in
[1:59:46] the same ways that he did before
[1:59:50] that he might prove himself that he
[1:59:53] still alive
[1:59:54] and it was through that that part that
[1:59:58] was then that was necessary those forty
[2:00:01] days like we looked at it that ministry
[2:00:03] was necessary in order to bring a people
[2:00:06] to the upper room
[2:00:08] they had seen him on the outside what
[2:00:12] they needed was him on the inside
[2:00:16] so that meant making known from that
[2:00:20] resurrection where he's taking literally
[2:00:23] the seals off himself it was all laying
[2:00:26] in the word and he walked with them it
[2:00:29] wasn't a hurried up thing he walked with
[2:00:32] them and he began to open the scriptures
[2:00:35] concerning himself he's taking the seals
[2:00:39] off himself
[2:00:46] then we know he enters in with them into
[2:00:49] that place where he breaks the bread now
[2:00:51] and this huh
[2:00:54] it's him he appear there right there and
[2:00:57] then he's gone you see the appearing
[2:01:00] wants to stimulate their faith that
[2:01:03] there's nothing out of order everything
[2:01:06] is right in order everything's right in
[2:01:09] time
[2:01:16] his appearing he was making himself
[2:01:20] known to them so it's a call
[2:01:23] called to the promise of the hour a
[2:01:28] word born bride bride that is born of
[2:01:33] the word a man what is it what is taking
[2:01:37] place it's God revealing his chosen
[2:01:41] place of worship
[2:01:44] see here's odd come down
[2:01:46] let me just skip over these things here
[2:01:50] and just skip to the skip to the places
[2:01:54] here you find the
[2:01:57] Ministry of
[2:01:59] the seventh angel he's on earth
[2:02:04] this is what's being ministered on earth
[2:02:07] and he's pointing us to a time that's
[2:02:10] coming well brother and he's pointing
[2:02:12] all those seals all those sails all
[2:02:15] those thunders see things are stirring
[2:02:17] in his heart I
[2:02:19] mean just I mean I'm gonna just I've got
[2:02:22] to keep going here with this you
[2:02:24] remember brother Brown when he's talking
[2:02:25] about look we're leading up to that
[2:02:26] place of the seals you're not brother
[2:02:28] Rams talking about praying and fasting
[2:02:29] well let's pray let's fast memories
[2:02:32] drawing the people all where we've
[2:02:33] drifted from all the all-night prayer
[2:02:34] meetings and all this listen it's not
[2:02:37] saying that now that the seals are open
[2:02:39] that we don't need those things listen
[2:02:42] to me now all of that was leading up
[2:02:45] God's presence moving upon the earth
[2:02:48] that the people were moving to pray and
[2:02:51] look for those things how much more on
[2:02:55] what has been revealed to you and I
[2:02:58] ought we to be in prayer
[2:03:00] prayer for the fulfillment of these
[2:03:04] things
[2:03:09] it doesn't do away with fasting you see
[2:03:13] now what they were looking for now has
[2:03:16] it's arrived what's it doing it's us
[2:03:18] what are we doing you say Oh praying or
[2:03:20] fasting I'm talking about us
[2:03:22] consecrating ourself to the mighty God
[2:03:26] to Christ who's in our midst that same
[2:03:30] Christ now that mystery being unfolded
[2:03:33] in your life it wasn't by happenstance
[2:03:36] that you're born in a message family
[2:03:38] it's not by chance that you come in to a
[2:03:41] church it's not by chance that you hear
[2:03:44] the message hid everything God is
[2:03:46] arranging it I
[2:03:52] wish I had 10,000 10,000 years to
[2:03:56] appreciate this morning wish I had ten
[2:03:58] thousand voices my voices it seems like
[2:04:00] it's just failing me this morning
[2:04:03] but here is that seventh angel
[2:04:06] he's on earth the Prophet says it like
[2:04:08] this in the message breach here he is
[2:04:10] standing on earth at the time of his
[2:04:13] coming and he says he tears the seals
[2:04:16] off of that book and
[2:04:19] hands it down to his seventh angel
[2:04:22] messenger
[2:04:23] he's got to have one the Prophet said
[2:04:26] like John like Elijah that set aside to
[2:04:29] begin to minister these things I hope
[2:04:31] you understand what I'm saying friends
[2:04:34] the holy spirit of things that's been
[2:04:36] speaking and ushering to our hearts it's
[2:04:38] not enough just to know God sent a
[2:04:42] prophet
[2:04:43] it's not enough
[2:04:46] it's not enough with this the rapture is
[2:04:49] not about rallying around brother
[2:04:51] Branham I know sometimes the people say
[2:04:55] who are you trying to do we're trying to
[2:04:56] do I'm not trying to do anything I'm
[2:04:59] trying to declare as the Prophet himself
[2:05:00] is there to be rallying around the Lord
[2:05:03] Jesus Christ that's his desire of where
[2:05:07] we would be in this hour and that's why
[2:05:09] we don't need another message it's the
[2:05:12] God who already spoke by prophecy in
[2:05:15] this message this message becoming flesh
[2:05:18] in you and I which is the promised
[2:05:21] scriptures of this hour
[2:05:24] let me say to you very clearly when
[2:05:28] Sarah was there
[2:05:30] here's Sarah
[2:05:32] hearing herself in her condition God had
[2:05:36] her and his mind the whole time
[2:05:40] was that right but here it comes down to
[2:05:43] this time and we know that God even
[2:05:46] tells Abraham you're going to have a
[2:05:48] child of Sarah
[2:05:51] and you're going to call his name Isaac
[2:05:55] seeing how God dealt with Abraham
[2:05:58] then here in Genesis 18
[2:06:00] God had appeared in lights
[2:06:04] forms dreams
[2:06:07] many gifts but in Genesis 18 he comes
[2:06:11] down and takes on the form of a man
[2:06:16] and what does he do why is the purpose
[2:06:19] that coming
[2:06:22] the purpose of that coming is to bring
[2:06:26] Sara's faith
[2:06:29] through the place that the promise can
[2:06:32] be made manifest
[2:06:38] you don't see in the ku don't see in
[2:06:41] Genesis 18 Abraham saying I don't know
[2:06:44] how to I don't know if this is gonna be
[2:06:46] previous chapter
[2:06:47] when Abraham's not saying in 18 I don't
[2:06:51] know no it's Sara but you see when he
[2:06:53] came he come to dissolve that dot that
[2:06:58] she had
[2:07:02] that part about her life was a complex
[2:07:06] to her
[2:07:09] think about it the by he wasn't a good
[2:07:11] thing to be called barren
[2:07:14] John's mother Elizabeth LeBaron there
[2:07:18] wasn't a good thing to be known as a
[2:07:19] barren one but God had a reserved for a
[2:07:23] certain time
[2:07:25] because this would be done in Abraham or
[2:07:28] in Abraham and Sarah's life it would not
[2:07:30] be through their strength
[2:07:33] God allowed Abraham's strength to die
[2:07:39] he allowed that age to die
[2:07:42] he allowed it to come to a place of
[2:07:45] deadness where it could not produce
[2:07:48] anything
[2:07:50] then he steps on the scene the very life
[2:07:53] giver himself the prophesy the promise
[2:07:57] himself he steps on the scene and he
[2:08:01] begins to step on the scene and through
[2:08:04] this ministry
[2:08:05] the bridegroom call comes
[2:08:08] it's the bride man caller the revealing
[2:08:12] of the son of man what's the bridegroom
[2:08:14] called doing it's calling the bride how
[2:08:16] was the bridegroom calling the bride the
[2:08:18] bridegroom calls the bride by speaking
[2:08:20] and manifesting bridegroom's print
[2:08:22] scriptures and promises and by
[2:08:25] manifesting bridegroom promises it calls
[2:08:28] the bride
[2:08:30] they mad and wanted to do that unites
[2:08:33] the two together
[2:08:37] all of that being said for this when
[2:08:41] he's told he told Sarah I'm coming he
[2:08:45] announced his coming here was his
[2:08:47] appearing now he announces his coming
[2:08:50] and his coming was going to be a coming
[2:08:54] inside of her first and that coming
[2:08:59] inside of error would carry her to the
[2:09:02] coming son
[2:09:05] so that coming was actually a going
[2:09:11] are you with me when he's told Sarah he
[2:09:15] said I will visit you according to the
[2:09:17] time of life who was that that said that
[2:09:22] was it the body was he going to come
[2:09:25] back in in that same body no but the one
[2:09:29] who was in that body who was speaking
[2:09:32] that promise was letting Sarah know that
[2:09:35] I am going to visit you according to the
[2:09:39] time of life
[2:09:41] so the revealing of the son of man what
[2:09:45] does it do it brings a word borne by
[2:09:48] into position for Christ to step into
[2:09:54] she is bone of his bone flesh of his
[2:09:58] flesh life of his life she is him a
[2:10:07] reconciliation
[2:10:11] reconciling these parts together and the
[2:10:14] Bible said Sarah judged him faithful
[2:10:17] there's no greater honor that we can do
[2:10:20] you might look at all in your
[2:10:22] disappointment you might look at all
[2:10:23] your flaws you might look at all of your
[2:10:25] letdown you look it up but you're
[2:10:27] looking at the wrong thing
[2:10:30] you need to look to him because what
[2:10:34] he's speaking he's not looking at your
[2:10:36] weaknesses he's not even looking at your
[2:10:40] strengths what he's looking at is his
[2:10:43] word and the greatest thing that you and
[2:10:47] I can say Lord let it be in me me to get
[2:10:51] out of the way Lord dissolve all down
[2:10:54] Lord and all unbelief Lord even remove
[2:10:57] complexes about me that I've got about
[2:11:00] me but I'm no good and I'm this Lord
[2:11:02] dissolved that I take your word
[2:11:05] hallelujah
[2:11:07] let his word be preeminent let it cast
[2:11:11] out and cast down all imagination let it
[2:11:14] cast down every doubt and say Lord I'm
[2:11:17] united with the promise of this hour
[2:11:19] these are other things and things that
[2:11:21] take place I have sealed it's just to
[2:11:24] try to get me down they try to get me
[2:11:26] from the purpose is to try to take me
[2:11:29] from the joy of you and your the joy of
[2:11:32] my life Lord
[2:11:33] help me Lord
[2:11:35] the Bible says he shall arise with
[2:11:40] healing in his wings
[2:11:44] healing
[2:11:50] we're walking and talking with the king
[2:11:55] that
[2:11:57] same son of man
[2:11:59] the Lord Jesus Christ is here in his
[2:12:04] bride body
[2:12:07] the prophet said in the message of trial
[2:12:10] he said I charge you to believe that
[2:12:12] Christ the Son of man is manifest in the
[2:12:17] bride's body
[2:12:21] what do I have to do but say man what do
[2:12:25] I have to do what can I do
[2:12:28] Jesus never tried to do anything I know
[2:12:31] this is simple I know it's simple but
[2:12:33] friends that's just it's just reality of
[2:12:35] where it's at god help me help me to
[2:12:39] give myself to that simplicity there's
[2:12:42] more for me to give this simplicity
[2:12:45] remember what the Prophet said in that
[2:12:47] pick up your pen and write the Spirit of
[2:12:48] God said noticed
[2:12:50] notice what harmony is to exist now
[2:12:54] between the groom and his bride
[2:12:58] notice notice means look at observe the
[2:13:02] harmony
[2:13:04] remember when Lazarus died they couldn't
[2:13:07] move him they couldn't pull him oh
[2:13:12] my there's so much more to be saying but
[2:13:15] let's just move to this simplicity I do
[2:13:18] nothing
[2:13:20] what I see the father do
[2:13:25] whatsoever the father doeth
[2:13:27] that doeth the son likewise
[2:13:32] that's the same privilege that you and I
[2:13:35] have we don't have to be hasty God don't
[2:13:38] want you to be hey listen the focus
[2:13:40] please understand me you have needs in
[2:13:43] your life I have needs
[2:13:45] there's things that I wish I didn't have
[2:13:47] to even think about or do you understand
[2:13:51] I mean there's things I wish I didn't
[2:13:53] who here we just passed was the tax
[2:13:54] season coming up or it's already past I
[2:13:56] don't know I I do mine way ahead if I
[2:13:58] don't even like it
[2:13:59] but there's things we got to do like
[2:14:01] that right there's certain things that
[2:14:03] you have to do that we have to do we
[2:14:04] don't like doing them
[2:14:06] there's certain things that comes up
[2:14:08] like this for certain things that even
[2:14:10] with a job and other things that can
[2:14:12] come up and so forth but the thing of
[2:14:15] the thing of it is is that in the midst
[2:14:17] of it we just remember our
[2:14:20] focus and our purpose is him
[2:14:28] when things itself wants to try listen
[2:14:32] there's times you know how it is I know
[2:14:33] how it is there's things that comes my
[2:14:35] way and it seems like it pulls me right
[2:14:37] down just like that Eagle fallen in the
[2:14:38] pine tree
[2:14:40] and that's and that is a truth and
[2:14:43] sometimes you look at you think what am
[2:14:45] I doing here
[2:14:46] sometimes I can get to looking at and
[2:14:48] you're seeing you know you're hearing
[2:14:50] chatter you're listening to chatter and
[2:14:52] things like a hit done and you get to
[2:14:53] looking at so many different things and
[2:14:56] what does that do it keeps us there
[2:15:00] but there have before that ego could
[2:15:03] take off that ego could not take off if
[2:15:05] he's still looking at chatter
[2:15:08] he's got to point his head to where he
[2:15:11] wants to go
[2:15:13] he knows where he needs to get to that's
[2:15:17] the first start you say well he didn't
[2:15:19] take off right away he had to set his
[2:15:20] head first so first of all turn your
[2:15:24] attention away and turn it back to the
[2:15:26] purpose and
[2:15:28] and you find that heart say Lord
[2:15:30] returned me to the purpose
[2:15:33] store me back to the first love Lord get
[2:15:37] your head turned in the right direction
[2:15:38] then listen you've got the wings you've
[2:15:41] got the equipment for it you're built
[2:15:43] for it you're built to overcome this not
[2:15:48] in your natural self your natural self
[2:15:50] you're not built for it but within you
[2:15:52] you're an eagle you're ordained to
[2:15:55] overcome this
[2:15:56] yes you are and the grace of God is
[2:16:01] ever-present to build you up all you're
[2:16:04] gonna do is look to him and say Lord I
[2:16:06] lift up my eyes to the hills from whence
[2:16:09] cometh my help and just set your wings
[2:16:12] and what's the Spirit of God who has
[2:16:15] healing in his wings has strength in his
[2:16:18] wings you watch the presence of God
[2:16:20] sweep down and take you to where you
[2:16:23] want to get back to before you fell into
[2:16:25] that pine tree I know I'm preached and
[2:16:28] personal here this morning but I'm just
[2:16:31] going to what he's giving me
[2:16:33] don't get looking at the needles focus
[2:16:37] on him
[2:16:39] Lord Jesus lifted me up Lord
[2:16:42] lift me up Lord
[2:16:45] set my wings Lord Jesus
[2:16:48] but Simon how am I gonna take care of
[2:16:50] this front don't worry about that you're
[2:16:53] focused on the wrong thing how am I
[2:16:55] gonna make this come out right you're
[2:16:56] worried about the wrong thing that's
[2:16:58] only the enemy trying to trick you and
[2:17:00] keep you down I gotta work this I know
[2:17:02] set your wings and you'll find he will
[2:17:06] bring everything right where it needs to
[2:17:08] be
[2:17:09] and it no longer is something that's
[2:17:12] your mind that's that's consumed and
[2:17:14] everything around you just adds to that
[2:17:16] battle and it keeps bringing you down
[2:17:18] lower and lower you're built to soar in
[2:17:21] the heavenlies you're built for this
[2:17:23] you're ordained as a son and daughter of
[2:17:26] God
[2:17:26] don't focus on the storm
[2:17:30] the storm is only an opportunity now but
[2:17:33] God proves his grace that there's a
[2:17:36] strength there's a direction there's an
[2:17:38] authority in you that's given to rise
[2:17:40] above that
[2:17:43] what's he doing he's reconciling you
[2:17:46] he's drawing you beyond your doubts your
[2:17:49] complexes your thoughts are yourself
[2:17:51] he's drawing you the real you he's
[2:17:54] drawing you to himself I
[2:18:01] feel like singing that song I give
[2:18:04] myself away I
[2:18:07] knew Lord I knew but consecrate myself
[2:18:12] to you I know I knew a
[2:18:17] new Lord
[2:18:19] afresh the
[2:18:22] sender how am I gonna do it all you have
[2:18:25] to do sarah is judge him faithful who
[2:18:29] made the promise
[2:18:32] judge him faithful
[2:18:35] and he's faithful
[2:18:38] to move in your life
[2:18:41] let me tell you something we are called
[2:18:45] in an age of impossibility
[2:18:49] we are called to do things in this age
[2:18:54] that's impossible
[2:19:00] it's impossible for me to produce a
[2:19:02] rapture
[2:19:04] it's impossible for you to produce a
[2:19:06] rapture
[2:19:08] it's impossible for me to preach you in
[2:19:10] a rapture
[2:19:14] but my dependency is not on me
[2:19:20] my dependency is in him
[2:19:24] he is the one he is the rapture
[2:19:29] he is our catching away he is our
[2:19:33] quickening that catches us away
[2:19:37] he's already caught us away within right
[2:19:41] he's already raised us above the things
[2:19:44] of the world we can't produce that
[2:19:46] you're not going to produce that Christ
[2:19:49] is going to manifest it through you you
[2:19:54] are ordained for this moment I'm
[2:19:57] ordained for this moment so what can we
[2:20:00] say Lord as he did in groom form in
[2:20:04] groom form
[2:20:06] he committed himself to God
[2:20:13] you loved him this morning I
[2:20:18] trust I trust that it's it's come
[2:20:22] together I trust that it
[2:20:25] it's so quicken to our hearts so remain
[2:20:30] alive and more and more real to us let

[2:21:31] how that you lead I know a thought Lord
[2:21:33] and when you place it on my heart but
[2:21:36] father this is not my ministry this is

[2:21:44] Lord God that you have ransomed and
[2:21:47] purchased with your own blood and Lord
[2:21:51] Jesus this is our desire as we see more
[2:21:57] clearer more clear
[2:21:59] the Lord in the purpose
[2:22:02] of this message and to recognize the
[2:22:06] Lord
[2:22:07] that the greater one how many times as
[2:22:11] your profit would minister and words
[2:22:15] Lord titles they were not just titles of

[2:22:51] focus of this hour

[2:22:57] many things that desire to try to come
[2:22:59] our way
[2:23:00] that help us Lord to stay focused upon
[2:23:04] you
[2:23:06] Lord Jesus no matter
[2:23:09] friends may come friends may go

[2:23:29] I'm gonna have a job tomorrow there is
[2:23:31] no security lord no other security
[2:23:35] outside of you
[2:23:38] Lord when we would even look at those
[2:23:40] things we could become anxious and
[2:23:43] fearful because there is no certainty in
[2:23:46] it the Lord God when we can just
[2:23:50] be so focused Lord to know that
[2:23:54] we're not here because of our job
[2:23:58] we're here to serve you we're here to
[2:24:03] serve your purpose we're here to declare
[2:24:06] you as the call was made and Isaiah 53
[2:24:11] he was cut off from the land of the
[2:24:13] living who shall declare his generation
[2:24:16] that
[2:24:20] life that expression
[2:24:22] [Music]
[2:24:24] boy was not the ending
[2:24:27] the Calvary was only the releasing
[2:24:32] glory
[2:24:35] whereby the ransom price was paid to
[2:24:39] redeem us that then through the offering
[2:24:44] up and ascending on high that the high
[2:24:47] priest himself could begin to release
[2:24:51] back into the Church of the Living God
[2:24:54] his own life
[2:24:58] uniting with that seed that word that
[2:25:02] was there from the inside the whole time
[2:25:04] and raising up his children breeding
[2:25:08] back sons and daughters of God again
[2:25:11] or father this morning if there's one
[2:25:14] here Lord that doesn't know you that way
[2:25:18] I had pray this morning that God in all
[2:25:20] humility that Lord Jesus they were just
[2:25:24] from their heart Lord their God and say
[2:25:27] Lord
[2:25:29] I want to be received of you Lord
[2:25:32] help me Lord maybe or there in a time of
[2:25:35] dying out to themselves but thank God
[2:25:38] there's water present Lord to run away
[2:25:41] on our own ideas our own thinking lord I
[2:25:45] pray this morning that's your minister
[2:25:48] to that heart
[2:25:50] maybe they don't even got the courage
[2:25:52] right now to raise their hand but God I
[2:25:54] pray that within their heart as they'll
[2:25:56] say the Lord don't pass me by Lord I
[2:25:58] pray that God you'll brood upon that our
[2:26:00] Lord let them know your darling yes you
[2:26:04] are speaking parsley to them Lord I
[2:26:07] don't know Lord that you care as your
[2:26:10] prayers and sword moved apart employed
[2:26:12] let them know that Lord
[2:26:16] their God
[2:26:19] the storms of life
[2:26:23] sometimes the Lord we have warnings
[2:26:28] sometimes there's warnings when there's
[2:26:30] a weather change there's warnings
[2:26:33] winds high winds will begin at this hour
[2:26:37] of the day
[2:26:38] this will take place at this hour of the
[2:26:41] day there's warnings
[2:26:45] Lord sometimes
[2:26:47] we've not given heed to certain warnings
[2:26:52] forgive us Lord and
[2:26:54] I pray that Lord to know within this
[2:26:59] you are faithful in your word
[2:27:04] that all things
[2:27:07] work together
[2:27:09] for the good
[2:27:11] not that everything is good there's been
[2:27:14] a lot of things the Lord I know that
[2:27:17] I'll speak for many but I can't speak
[2:27:19] for my own self there's a lot of things
[2:27:20] Lord there's a lot of mistakes I've made
[2:27:22] a lot of things I
[2:27:26] cannot call the mistakes I made tests
[2:27:29] and trials but what I can say Lord that
[2:27:32] by your grace you have taught me you
[2:27:36] have showed me and you have helped me
[2:27:38] Lord even when I find that Lord God so
[2:27:42] many times that you by your Holy Spirit
[2:27:45] will even take me back sometimes Lord
[2:27:47] sometimes when I've been sitting in
[2:27:49] counseling someone Lord and the Lord God
[2:27:52] you'll take me back and I knew exactly
[2:27:54] by the grace of God where they're
[2:27:56] setting and you begin to give me the
[2:27:58] words to say sometimes Lord it's things
[2:28:00] that pull right out of the mistakes that
[2:28:03] I've made
[2:28:04] they wouldn't know it because I don't
[2:28:06] say
[2:28:07] [Music]
[2:28:09] the Lord God how that you'll come down
[2:28:11] and make those things known well there's
[2:28:15] many times the Lord how it will come I
[2:28:16] don't it's not it because of any mistake
[2:28:19] I've made it it's just how you come and
[2:28:21] MA what a wonderful feeling that is as
[2:28:24] you take control Lord
[2:28:28] right now as we look at this
[2:28:30] their storms may be a storm that's come
[2:28:33] up it's knocked one of your little
[2:28:35] Eagles and they're down there in that
[2:28:37] pine thicket
[2:28:39] and they realize I don't want to be here
[2:28:43] this chattering all this is just getting
[2:28:46] to me I don't want to be here
[2:28:49] they realize the Lord it's not just that
[2:28:52] they don't want to be there but I pray
[2:28:54] that by the leadership of the Holy
[2:28:55] Spirit this morning that they realize
[2:28:58] that they've got the power within them
[2:29:01] to overcome that they've got the power
[2:29:03] to be able to rise above that
[2:29:06] all they have to do is set
[2:29:10] set their affections on things above
[2:29:16] set their eyes and their focus and
[2:29:20] believe in that same God believe in that
[2:29:24] same life
[2:29:27] then he arranged them right back into
[2:29:30] the heavenlies
[2:29:33] they don't want to be there Lord they're
[2:29:36] still an eagle
[2:29:38] but they won't arise out of that back
[2:29:41] into the heavenlies
[2:29:43] back into the purpose
[2:29:46] help us lord help us to be more
[2:29:48] consecrated as you spoke to us this
[2:29:50] morning with these things that we see
[2:29:53] before us may we be desperate Lloyd
[2:29:58] desiring to see you in US Court
[2:30:04] we praise your wonderful name papa
[2:30:06] we love you this morning
[2:30:11] the name of Jesus Christ
[2:30:13] [Music]
[2:30:18] that's your desire won't you stand with
[2:30:21] me you've been set in a while you
[2:30:27] from the from the very back
[2:30:31] all the way back those are not even here
[2:30:35] streaming or would archive this later
[2:30:39] even a part here of this of this
[2:30:41] assembly
[2:30:43] may we all just consecrate ourselves in
[2:30:49] the purpose that God has for us
[2:30:53] consecrate ourselves in there I
[2:30:56] think like the Holy Spirit spoke last
[2:30:59] week their brother Steve the purpose is
[2:31:01] not that everybody come here to church
[2:31:04] the purpose is not that everybody go to
[2:31:07] this church or to that your that's not
[2:31:09] the purpose
[2:31:10] that's not the zeal of the hour the zeal
[2:31:13] and the purpose of the hour is being
[2:31:16] Christ the purpose and the focus is in
[2:31:20] Christ it's the rapture that's the focus
[2:31:23] that's what this message when God sent
[2:31:27] His Word it causes you and I to lose
[2:31:29] sight of ourselves
[2:31:33] and focus on him
[2:31:37] you love him
[2:31:40] might say brother sandal I've tried to
[2:31:43] help this individual I've tried to help
[2:31:45] this person I
[2:31:47] they don't seem like I can help them you
[2:31:50] may not be the instrument that God will
[2:31:51] used to help
[2:31:53] but it don't mean that what what's been
[2:31:55] done was in vain
[2:31:57] he understand it's no more than than
[2:32:01] myself I'm not everybody's pastor I'm
[2:32:03] only those whom goddess has set forth in
[2:32:06] ordained and for whatever time
[2:32:08] [Music]
[2:32:11] you understand what I'm saying there's
[2:32:14] some times where there might be people
[2:32:16] that will pass right through this
[2:32:18] assembly they might pass in this
[2:32:20] assembly maybe for a year maybe for two
[2:32:24] years may for three years
[2:32:27] sometimes
[2:32:29] sometimes there's things that God will
[2:32:31] do and I will try to find the answers to
[2:32:34] it I
[2:32:35] don't try to find the answers to it God
[2:32:38] knows what he's doing
[2:32:41] is that Alright he knows what he's doing
[2:32:43] and that's why that even within it God
[2:32:48] puts a burden on your heart for this
[2:32:50] work and this assembly here I can't
[2:32:53] teach that I didn't give you that I
[2:32:55] didn't give myself this burden
[2:32:58] but you see what it is we're a part of
[2:33:02] it
[2:33:03] co-workers together
[2:33:05] are you with me I'm just I'm just
[2:33:08] declaring to you my heart we're
[2:33:10] coworkers together in this we've got one
[2:33:12] objective and one motive and that's the
[2:33:15] scene the Lord Jesus Christ glorified we
[2:33:18] want to help every life in every soul
[2:33:20] that we can help is that right that's
[2:33:24] what our desire is as you see that
[2:33:28] let us not get our eyes on anything else
[2:33:31] but let us stay focused looking unto
[2:33:34] Jesus
