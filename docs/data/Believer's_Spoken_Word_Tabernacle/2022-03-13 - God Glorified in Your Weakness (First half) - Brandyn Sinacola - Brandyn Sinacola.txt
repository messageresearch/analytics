[Music] [Applause] [Music] forever [Music] amen we greet you in the name of the lord this morning if you can stand i won't sing a special so you don't got to sit any longer if you want to open to psalms chapter 33 we'll just jump right in here i was finishing the service message i was listening to and study and is this all okay brother do i got that too high or anything okay and just before i got here i i just i was thinking and then you know you think on the service and you try not to get in your head what the service will be like and just let god lead um even feel a little bit more prepared and then you sit in the office and as the songs get sung and you know that you're getting ready to come out you realize how inadequate you are and then you think oh lord but um the prophet said something in his prayer and i i just wanted to read it because i just uh i have a real burden for this right now and he says we'll read in psalms in just a moment he says may may ever who wears these handkerchiefs be healed may broken homes be re-established may little children without a father without a mother and them separated may that home be united again granite lord heal all the sick now and the afflicted get glory unto thyself but i just i thought that was real special because there's a lot of situations and and i have a bad memory so even if you told me yours i probably don't remember it standing here this morning but um you know there's situations back home that just real burden forward praying for and i just thought that was real special that the prophet would say that may broken homes be reestablished and those that are separated may they be united again so just hold on to that if you come from a broken home this morning amen psalms 33 and verse 12 and we'll read to the end blessed is the nation whose god is the lord and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance the lord looketh from heaven he beholdeth all the sons of men from the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth he fashioned their hearts alike he considereth all their works there is no king saved by the multitude of and hosts a mighty man is not delivered by much strength and horse is a vain thing for safety neither shall he deliver any by his great strength behold the eye of the lord is upon them that fear him upon them that hope and his mercy to deliver their souls from death and to keep them alive and famine our soul waiteth for the lord he is our help and our shield for our heart shall rejoice in him because we have trusted in his holy name let thy mercy o lord be upon us according as we hope in me amen if you want to be remembered in prayer if you just want to lift your hand we'll pray before we start and god bless you heavenly father we come before you lord and we we just approach your throne lord one more time before we bring your word realizing lord that father so many times god i just i i feel so young i feel so young in the ministry and and lord not that we want to compare ourselves amongst ourselves but there's many men lord more capable of of handling your word than i am but father look down upon us lord as the scripture said lord i look to you the people are looking to you lord they they see me father but they're coming to hear from you and so i pray god that you would speak lord every need behind every hand father you know what it is lord you knew god that they would raise their hand this morning maybe some feeling too weak to raise their hand but lord they have something on their heart go to them lord i pray you would speak now and be with brother sam this morning and i pray father that you would give him lord your divine word upon his lips lord wherever he is today keep him safe and bring him home safely to the flock i pray that everything would be done decent in order and father just thinking of ukraine lord we pray for the people of ukraine as a nation but also for the believers father lord just reading this morning that the shelling was starting and in their areas and i just pray father that you would lord again as our scripture said be their shield be their peace lord we love and praise you bless the church back home in jesus name amen amen you can be seated it's good to be here with you this morning and and we just bring greetings from brother paul and the church back home and just feel like you know sister churches and so just you guys always make me feel welcome and i think i say that every time but you do and i think it's something worth worth noting and and telling you thank you from the bottom of my heart i sure thank you and i and i know your pastor is proud of you so so just um as as i was looking at this the scripture i was reading a devotional um i think it's the family altar volume three the other day and and uh it was just i was just looking for inspiration for a service for home and and uh god just just seemed to open it through something that was on my heart you know just thinking i'm a imperfect man and make many mistakes and many many faults and failures and things that i you know i wish wish i didn't do and then you know you just you go through this whole process of how how you think about yourself you know and looking in the mirror and seeing you know who you are and and you know we we really we got to look through the mirror of god's word to see who we really are but the devil likes us to look in the mirror and and reflect on on ourselves and and you know just our weakness and and i was thinking you know even about some things in my life i wonder lord well how you know how long lord before that you know how long do i got to be this way and when when does deliverance come and you know you think you think about all these things go through your mind and and then i just the thought came to me one day and i thought you know i wonder if i'm doing things in my own strength i wonder if that's part of the problem and then i remembered a message that the prophet preached perfect strength by perfect weakness and so i've been i've been thinking about that that's been on my heart and then i read the psalms and i just what what jumped out to me about the psalms as it's talking about the lord and and his eyes are on the people of of the nation his eyes are on you know the scripture says his eyes going to and fro throughout all the earth and and so i was just thinking about that how the lord is constantly looking upon us we're always in his sight we're always on his mind you can't you can't go to any depth paul said you can't go from a height to a depth you'll never escape the love of god and you'll never escape the vision of god you'll never you'll never go too far where god loses track of you amen and you and you'll never be good at so good that god's you know that you're that god says you know what you're so good in your own strength why don't you come up next to my throne now you'll never do that because the bible says that our righteousness is as filthy rags so the very best that you can present to god god says i'm sorry but that stinks in my sight so i was just looking at that and i thought man this is but look at look at this how he says he fashioned their hearts so god makes a people with all of our faults and our failures and and he's made you he's he's made you a bent a certain way and and you know he he he made you maybe you have more passions than the other or or maybe you have something about yourself you know you you gotta have it exactly right i i don't know i can't remember what i preached on the last time but maybe i mentioned you know i'm a perfectionist and you know you look at those things and you and you just you think you know why am i bent so much this way and and you know brother branham said that if he if he was out hunting if he didn't hit that squirrel right in the eye he was he was disappointed it wasn't good enough he had to hit that thing right dead on and you know so that translates over into his ministry we see and so you you wonder why god has made you with a certain makeup that you have and it's not to give excuse for sin and it's not to not to give excuses for things you know a temper and things like that um you know you need to bring that to the lord i'll do respect to you if you got a temper you need to you need to be at the altar and get that thing under control amen i'm just letting god lead so whatever comes out is coming out brothers is it okay if i move this off to the side a little bit okay thank you i just feel like i'm going to bump it um but it i'm not even off my first paragraph so but you know it's it's god's god's made us this way and and he's fashioned us this way and and one one of the scriptures i've always struggled with and i still struggle with it to this day i just try to have faith but it says can the clay say to the potter why have you made me thus and i have a hard time with that because oftentimes i'm saying lord i i know the scripture says not to do this but i don't understand myself why why did you why am i this way why did you make me this way and really i don't think that there's a problem in asking god those types of questions right you you can ask god lord show me why why is this a part of my makeup the question to ask is lord how can this be used for your glory what what do you want to use this for in my life what what is this there for it's it's not just for me to struggle along through life but lord and maybe it's just so that i learned to to to stay close to you and and bring it under subjection to you but what what can you use this for today amen and yet god with all of our weaknesses and everything that he made us with he he's always looking at us his eyes are always upon us you you feel low about yourself like i do sometimes and yet god is always there and he's always loving you despite those things it's an unconditional love that you know you might you might not understand love because maybe you didn't get it as a child properly maybe maybe your mom and dad you know i was listening to he's actually a christian comedian and he was saying you know he was sitting around with this group of of of men and they were kind of bashing it was a dad bashing session you know like i'm you know my dad was this and i didn't get this in life and and this and this comedian said i was sitting there and he said all of a sudden it hit me and he thought let's turn this into a positive thing and he said you know he's looked at the one and and i think his dad might have been on drugs too and he said you don't you have never taken a drug in all of your life and he said that's because you watched your dad hooked on drugs he said so you ought to think your father because through that example you realize that i don't want to be that way and through that it made you a better person you might not have received the love that you should have from your mom your parents might have passed away when you were young or one or the other passed away and so you raised up with that with that void in your life but i want to tell you this too this morning is that god provides within the body of christ and and so there's there's many men here that you could look to if you didn't have a daddy that you could look to and and see that this this is what a real man of god is like and you can you can use that as an example and fashion yourself after that man amen none of this is in my notes so this is keep pulling and but you know there there's that can create a void in your life and that can create a weak spot in your life to where you don't you don't know how to receive love you don't know how to give love but when you look in the bible and you can you can look even even if you didn't have a good example in your life if you look at the bible you can see how the father loves you that nothing you do can separate us from the love of god and that and that alone tells us he says why you were yet sinners christ died for you so while you were no good before you even could could have a desire to do good christ died for you and so you can look at that and you can grab onto it and you can you can give love to others through that example amen but it's it's it's those things that god allows it's it's it's brother branham called it predestinated trials in our life so your trials are you are are unique to you and yet there's nothing new under the sun so you can't say i'm the only one going through this somebody has gone through that before amen but but it's predestinated to you to your life so that you can become who god god knows what you need to go through to get from the negative to the positive to get from the from the image of of let's just be real of what you are to really who you are to who god sees you as god knows what to put you through and he knows he knows what you have to lose in life and what you what you what you can gain in life and what you know you look at another brother and you compare yourself to that brother and and you say lord but he he has the the nice new vehicle and he has this and he has he's he's living in overcoming life and but why can't i but yet god god has taken him through usually we're looking at somebody older first of all i know i have a lot of peers who are just a year younger than me and and they're so much farther in natural things than i am and many probably in spiritual things do but you know i've always wondered about that but you can't compare yourself because because god knows he's taken you through a channel maybe even for a different work than what that brother is going to have and and maybe you couldn't handle the things that that brother has yet because you need to know what it is to suffer a little bit because of what god has for you coming up amen are you with me so far so i want to open um you can turn there or i'll just read it hebrews 11. and you know sometimes i was thinking too we can think of you know we know where the minister's going so we can just check out you know take a nap i know i'm not as fiery as brother sam so i might not keep you awake like he does but but i've never seen this before in this chapter in verse 32 hebrews 11 32 paul writes and what shall i more say for the time would fail me to tell of gideon and of barack and of samson and of jephthah and david also and samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stop the mouth of lions quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword it's a pretty good testimony ain't it my goodness we'd love to be that but watch this next part out of weakness we're made strong so you have this this not even a full sentence in itself just uh you could maybe say between brackets you know between two commas there's this this little spot in the in the heroes of faith and it's saying man this this this brother did that and this sister did that and this is the power of god and and you know hold of these things and yet there's this one little part in here out of weakness we're made strong so we look at the strength of these brothers and sisters and the heroes of faith oftentimes and and we think man i want to be that way and why can't i why can't i live like that and in the faith of abraham bless god and yet there's weakness and through that weakness they were made strong brother branham said in perfect strength by perfect weakness just quoting and he says you know i i hope that when i get to the other side he said i hope my my story reads like abraham's and he's saying i made a lot of mistakes and he's talking about mistakes he made in the last year and yet he says he says i hope my story is written like abraham's that when it comes through the blood of christ when i get over to that other side that my story is written that it's my weaknesses are no longer seen but it's what god did in my life because the bible said that abraham staggered not at the promises of god but if you go read abraham he staggered a lot and you think lord how could this be how could this be about his life but it's the same that's going to be written about your life is that even though you feel weak at times even though you feel weak many times it's that's not how god sees you god's looking at you through the blood of christ and he sees you as strong and mighty in the lord he sees you as a perfect work rock through jesus christ amen now there's there's a side i i want to speak on on god glorified
