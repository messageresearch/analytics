privileged people we are and when we say that we recognize that of god coming to us and finding us and making himself known to us then what a privilege it is and now a responsibility that we have do you know the responsibility it doesn't require us working it requires us yield if we can just recognize him and just yield to him he'll come and do the work and yield to him amen let's just go to him in a word of prayer heavenly father tonight as we lord are gathered here o god with brothers and sisters of like precious faith and most importantly lord you're the you're the guest of honor it's you lord that we've invited into this meeting father it would be no more than just a gathering of mortals like any other gathering tonight but father it's you that makes the difference and this is our our longing our desire lord you put that desire within us as david said deep calleth to the deep at the noise of thy waterspouts so before we could ever have that desire and that longing there had to be a god who was able to meet that not just a god but the only true and living god lord everything that we have need of nothing takes you by surprise the prayer requests the needs that are spoken and unspoken nothing takes you by surprise if we can lord just entered into that place tonight that no matter the request that's been made or what's on the heart that we can enter to that place to know god's got this covered god's in control god's above this situation god's over this need god's over this sickness god's over every every need and he's the god of his word every promise he made he will bankrupt the heaven to keep one promise [Music] father we believe that god we are witnesses of that tonight so lord right here tonight we displace our lives so completely oh god as much as we could know how and depending on your grace that you would come and help us lord that father we might be able to fully place ourselves oh god every need committing it lord upon the altar of god in prayer and lord as we're standing lord god this evening before the throne of grace that we might find help lord in the time of trouble we believe oh god that you are mindful of your children tonight lord we invite you that you would come down as you lord would come down in the cool of the evening there in the garden in fellowship with your children lord this is the greatest moment lord if we could say it like this of a thursday when we can come lord and be gathered together and invite your presence that you would come down lord and speak to us it's the greatest desire of our life lord that's not only confined to a thursday or a sunday but oh god every day of our life lord to have that privilege o god to invite the living god down lord that you might come lord for we know one of these days lord it'll be a final invitation because as your prophet told us lord is the spirit of god that is moved on our hearts god to restore us back to that lord of what they had at pentecost lord that that has been restored in this hour lord with the spirit of the living god to welcome you back oh god oh father your provision lord and lord our yielding to it oh god now it is your own word in your own life being reflected back to you oh god inviting you lord inviting you as your prophet would say it a welcoming spirit that welcomes you back lord father granted this this evening we're looking for the coming of the lord we're expecting the coming of the lord in this service we're expecting you to come lord and to speak to our hearts to minister to our lives now father for every need that's here lord god i claim every need lord god in the name of the lord jesus christ that every need will be met oh god every life that'll be filled lord god that sickness o god will be turned back hold in indifference lord will be removed lord we pray may you come lord in the name of jesus christ and take control lord we pray and we love you lord in jesus precious name amen amen in the church said amen as you're turning in your bibles with me to psalms 65 and we'll read a verse of scripture there i want to mention to you a few announcements that is first of all this sunday is the special offering for the building project brother shane had followed up with an email that you had received regarding the church calendar for march the shane followed up with that email to give current amounts and where we're at with everything so would you just be in prayer continue in prayer about that and how god would lay upon your heart amen as we go forward in that project also brother brandon senecola will be ministering for us this sunday i'll just ask you to keep myself in prayer i'll lord willing to be with brother jonathan martin in service there in the morning and then a youth service in the evening there in lima so if you just remember us in prayer and also brother brandon being here and we put out to you um on that announcement of some special services here with brother berry coffee on march 26th and 27th and those are just some services that i've had on my heart since back in the first part of november when i just just dropped in my heart and i contacted brother berry and of course you know that barry's very been very much involved with everything with ukraine and russia and it's just one channel that's been there it's just been easy to feed everything through that channel and so and that that's been mounting there so the reason i didn't get that to you earlier it's because it still was kind of hanging and not knowing right where it was and so the lord willing we're going to make this happen and i just there's some just some real things that i just felt just to come in and just to focus on some things and uh so i just really appreciate brother barry's ministry uh myself and my family we've been just we've been blessed and just been benefited and i know some of the rest of you you know brother barry well either you've streamed him on the internet or you've heard him speak in person and so i just i just really i appreciate that i appreciate all of god's gifts they're all every gift is different but i appreciate it because we need every gift amen so let's look here in the word of god tonight psalm 65 and let's read here verse one it says a song a psalm in a song of david prays waited for thee o god in zion and unto thee shall the vow be performed i wish i could preach on that oh thou that hearest prayer notice what he says in verse two oh thou that hearst prayer there's there's no wondering does god hear prayer and you realize from the first verse in order to say praises waiting for you is talking of a life that is free because worship is a result of freedom praise is waiting for you in zion i know you're coming and so when i see you come i'm going to release my praise oh thou that hearest prayer unto thee shall all flesh come iniquities prevail against me as for our transgressions thou shalt purge them away blessed is the man whom thou chooses and calls it to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house even of thy holy temple by terrible things meaning awesome things in righteousness wilt thou answer us o god of our salvation we want the confidence of all the ends of the earth and of them that are afar upon the sea i could say right now in this time he is our confidence as as paul would write on whom the ends of the earth have come and brother brown would take that scripture in corinthians and say what he is saying there is now where we are standing in the end time on whom where the end of the world has come but what a time in an hour to have a confidence in the lord amen amen may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated tonight i want to speak here just a few moments go a little bit further on that thought of communion we've been speaking on prayer and i want to just move into that a little bit more we started looking at that thought last week on settled and listening and i'm not going to get there tonight into that part of it of being settled and listening but that's the goal that god has with communion is where we come to a place of rest and to where that we're available and open in communion with him and there's things that as we recognize that this tonight i'd like to just speak on a communion and a desire for fellowship and truly there's no real child of god but you long to get in the presence of god sometimes there's things that can work or we allow and i just say it like this we allow god doesn't put any hindrances if there's any hindrances is what we allow or what we permit but i'm glad that there's grace and mercy to a company that can speak to any hindrance that can minister to our lives and that woos us into fellowship i want you to think of this how david would write it here when we would look at that in psalms 65 4 blessed is the man whom thou chooseth and calls us so notice the causing to approach unto him is directly related to the choosing of god you see no man sought god at any time it was god that came seeking for man there's no way we could find our way so the way himself became us that he might direct us and bring us into the way so blessed is the man whom thou chooseth and calls us so even in the causing when you recognize god dealing with your heart and drawing you into that place and there's a longing for something more we can fellowship with this that there were things that were in our lives i remember before god you know a full surrender in my life but there began to be a desire for something more than the things of the world those things it was just losing all of its uh its you know value or what we would look at but there was something that was moving there it was god that was stirring up and causing things to begin to look in a different way it was god dealing with our lives so even in god dealing with our lives that is a blessing that he would cause us to approach unto his courts you're a blessed person for the holy spirit to come by and speak to your heart you're a blessed person tonight amen when god met mary there through the ministry of gabriel what did he say blessed art thou and highly favored among men she didn't become blessed at that moment he was announcing to her your whole life you've been blessed you did not become blessed you always were blessed it was god watching over your life to bring you to the place where his blessing can be poured out to fully make known to you the blessing that rests in your life so psalms 84 verse 1 notice how david would write how amiable awesome are thy tabernacles o lord of hosts the courts my soul longeth yea even fainteth for the courts of the lord my heart and my flesh crack out for the living god if david a man under the law of god would desire to get in the presence of god and all that he knew was the law of god david knew what it was to get in the presence of god but to think about it that was only a shadow that was only a type what ought that to do to the children of god that are partakers of the blood of jesus christ it's a longing to get into his presence well let me just say this his presence don't allow it to be limited to just coming on a thursday or a sunday that's not god's desire but he announced his desire in matthew 28 that lo i am with thee always whether so ever thou goes so it's god's presence then that we are invited to be partakers of his presence and notice david would say yea the sparrow have found a house the swallow a nest for herself where she may lay her young even than altars o lord of hosts my king and my god blessed are they that dwell in thy house they will still be praising thee in psalms 16 11 david david said thou wilt show me the path of life and in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand are pleasures forevermore so david is already announcing under an unction and inspiration of the holy spirit of where the real pleasures and where the real delight where the real joy is for a child of god you you can't find joy in any other thing if your joy is limited to that of the world then you need to recognize that i i need that joy that the lord jesus spoke on because the joy of the world it comes and goes and let's face it we can get a new job and manic everything can just seem like this is the best thing since sliced bread and we get there and realize there's mold on this bread too there's hairs in these biscuits too are you with me because we realize there's always a law of contrast no matter what you do there's always good and there's always bad and if there's things that god has led you into whatever he leads you into does not mean it's going to be a rosy pathway but whatever god leads you into and he's there and he's guiding you in it all you have to do is say lord with these things that are coming along my way lord let me submit myself that my character can be molded through these things that it might match the image that you're calling me to lord you see god knows exactly what he's doing so here david is announcing that it's in the presence of the lord that there's fullness of joy and it's at his right hand in the power if that is his right hand in his strength this is where there are pleasures forevermore you know no wonder what brother branham could say the greatest thrill of my life the greatest thrill of the church is to pray until we can get into that place of his presence i'm sure i can i'm talking to believers tonight that there's times as you get into his presence there and here you're able to move into that place past all of the distractions and thinking about the load of laundry and thinking about tomorrow where you're able to come into that place in his presence where he begins to speak back to you and and you get up from your knees or on your face or walking around and here you go throughout the day and he's still speaking to you he's bringing things to you if there's a channel that becomes open between you and god and you find yourself listening to the word and there's things that you're reading in the word hearing in the word and you say my i never seen it like this before but it's the effects of being in his presence there's a channel that becomes open to you and i so when we look at prayer and i i think if we'll take it in this manner prayer itself because we hear a lot of things you know where i think as we've looked at it last week and throughout times when when a nation or or people get in trouble and everything is pray and pray and remember brother branham announces in the world falling apart again he said it isn't a day of prayer we need we need a day of repentance now the prophet is not speaking against prayer because paul would identify i would that every men would pray everywhere lifting up holy hands but the scripture goes on to say without wrath and without doubting so in order to bring it to that place there's got to be a repentance or a provision made that where we are in prayer that it's real communion with god because prayer itself is not a religious act i know it is limited to many as a religious act but prayer is not a religious act prayer is a communion with god prayer is not confined even to your prayer closet although i think it's good to have a place that's designated where you're able to go but prayer itself paul could say that men would pray without ceasing that they would pray everywhere and by praying always is that right so it would speak to you and i that prayer is not something of a tradition or religious ceremony but prayer is a contact with a living god where there is a communion with almighty god himself that no matter where we go there is a channel that has been opened to you and i to be able not only to speak to god but to hear from god you see when we're talking about this with communion prayer is real communion brother iran would take it into this manner and he would talk about the communion as far as he would say you know the sacraments that of the that of the bread and that of the wine he said that's not really communion he said we've got that he said from from the church he said that he said real communion is talking with god face to face it's being able to have in communion this when we take communion is only a testimony that i am in fellowship with the living god that's what that is is that right now notice when we look at this of communion so communion itself it deals with being able to talk to somebody to not talk at them sometimes we're really good at that we can talk at people right but communion is talking with one another so in other words you can speak to them and they'll speak back to you it's a two-way street is that right you know that's why when we read it last week brother brandon would tell us you can listen to a radio watch a television hope you don't but if you do they're you know they can't commune back to you right it's a one-way street you can't stop the announcer on the news and say wait wait wait wait that's fake that ain't right you can't do that is that right it's not a communion you can't stop that so communion even brother branham said me standing here ministering the word is not communion but it is a necessity the preaching of the word will point us to fellowship you see there's things that sometimes in our life let's take here the sinner coming it takes the preaching of the word to bring conviction and point them in the right way that calls them into a full fellowship and it's also the preaching of the word when we come and we hear the word this is why when we hear it that's why brother ramsey says a person can say i can stay home from church and be just as good a person brother bram said no you can't do that he said coming to the house of god keeps us in fellowship more than just fellowship with one another and to know what's going on in the assembly but it keeps us in a place of fellowship because the living word comes by and ministers to conditions and to needs and to situations that are in our lives because it's god's desire that we remain in fellowship is that right now when we're looking at this we realize that you know brother brandon would tell us with that of the communion that you know he says one of the things that we make the biggest mistake on now you know we'll get to this eventually but just to drop this in tonight he said the greatest mistake we have and i could say that covers every one of us he said is we do too much talking we get there and we're in prayer and he says you know we're talking about lord do something for so and so do something for so-and-so do something for so-and-so he said that in communion you're only asking for favors but you see communion is where there is a there is a transmission of strength should we ask requests we should ask requests but our prayer prayer is not limited to requests that's not communion communion is fellowship if it's only request it's no more than you or i being the radio or the tv to god he can't speak back at all we don't have no time lord i got 15 minutes fit this in you'll have to you got to come within 15 minutes you might as well save your time you're all twisted up in your spirit you'll never be able to break beyond that realm but instead to approach almighty god don't put him on a time schedule but say i'm going to redeem the time i'm going to step back into a place and stop allowing all these pressures to encroach on my time oh my so we know that there's enough with brother we got to wait until he'll answer back sometimes he answers right then sometimes he answers moments later hour later days later we understand now what did you think of brother ryan would take this around in this message communion and he would speak of how a great way to commune is to be agreed and to agree on certain things we find that in the scriptures we read this last week out of revelations 3 20 behold i stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice open the door i will come in to him and will suck with him and he with me now this scripture we we can labor on it long but we know that this is a scriptural promise that god has vindicated in this generation now it's not vindicated before the church that has put him out because when the church rejected the word the prophet tells us they disfellowshipped the holy spirit from their meetings so to welcome the holy spirit you've got to welcome the word and the word is not a letter because they all carry bibles but the word is the person of the holy ghost himself coming present into lives and knocking on doors and saying hey i love you i want to have fellowship with you amen it's not a god that's far away it's not pointing off to somewhere out in the distance but he says behold i stand at the door and knock he's announcing his personal presence i'm not coming i am here is that right we know his coming now in the fullness of the holy spirit it's what makes us ready and looking to the literal coming is that right so when we recognize this you know brother brown talks about in order to have communion and he says he ties it in with the eating and when you think of it when we look at things that that that that are eating because he said i will come into you and sup with him and he with me you know brother brown texts he takes this exact example in that message communion and he speaks of how that with communion eating is associated with it now think of it brother brown will take this and apply a simple example he said any good salesman knows not to talk to you about their product if they're just getting you out of bed before you get a chance to eat come on i could say man for that for every one of us right feed the bear right put the bear to bed so we can talk business right is that right well they call it not hungry they call it hangry right i mean you just know hey wait a minute wait wait wait you need to eat you need these eating's associated with it why because eating itself is where things get settled so then you can agree and you can begin to talk on things you you're in an agreement to sit down and discuss those things i'll just say it in this way you recognize that if that happens in the natural in that way how much more important is it that we have the right spiritual diet the word of god would come in this hour to direct us into fellowship but hold on now not only that but the right diet in our life that makes us ready for continual fellowship you see not only did the word have to come in this hour when we talk about the dynamics of the holy ghost coming in this hour you cannot have the dynamics without the mechanics but the dynamics come to put and direct us into the mechanics of the word that he might fully come behind it and make it alive that's what brother bram says he says i have to stand here he said and when he was preaching scriptural signs of the time in birmingham in 64. he said i know some of you are not aware of this ministry the message of the hour he said but i want to sow and lay these things out clear because there's no way you can have faith if you don't know what you're approaching so god lays out his word and he himself i said he lays it out not a man lays it out that's why we need the dynamics to lay out the mechanics because it builds faith in the presence of the living god what is it doing it's opening up the way so eating is associated with it and we can all say man if our diet gets off we get off in things of the world and i'm not talking about going out to bars and getting on this and i'm talking about if we're not feeding on the word of god it's really hard to get into prayer you see prayer feeding on the word of god it prepares you as you're listening to a message sometimes as you put on singing and you say well brother samuel i'm just praying i can tell you you can't cause god to break his order god won't break his order the greatest thing we could do is say lord i'm tired of frustration i'm tired of spinning around i'm tired of trying to tell you what you need to do in my life instead i realize this is what i need to do first of all to eat we've got to lay down our will my my my my you we've gotta we're eating on the word of god it prepares us to enter in and to have fellowship with god do you realize in these services right here if all you get out of this service and it sounds like help me forgive me it sounds like charlie brown's teacher up here and you get done with it and say i need prayer brother samuel you missed it god is speaking to our needs right now he's setting things in preparation and order right now if my mind was a little bit foggy and i found it so upon the things of this earth and it can be pressing needs but i believe there's a presence of a living god right here right now while the word is being spoken that you can look and go forward oh my those things that are alike is what dwells together is that right that's why when the dove descended down there that day on the river jordan he did not light up on a wolf it lit up on a lamb the dove did not make him the lamb of god he already was the lamb of god the dove only confirmed the lamb of god you see it was a heavenly creature that come down to be united with that of the earth that then through that uniting could come uniting in our life to take us into the heavenlies so it's all god condescending you see it's the same dove of the holy spirit that that brewed and made love to the earth back there in genesis 1 and brought it in condition is the same dove of the holy spirit that works with our life because we in our first nature are wolves come on friends but the dove of the holy spirit deals with our life he ain't working on that wolf he's drawing that lamb out that's on the inside because your name is not wrote in a wolf section your name has been wrote in the lamb section of the book of life glory be to god oh my those things that are alike dwell together oh hallelujah think of this what makes people fellowship what does it what causes man to love to get together you know brother baby tells us that when we see it man loves to fellowship even the unconverted man is that right isn't it amazing you don't have to tell the people you just watch a little bit and you'll find them fill up a room with 300 people and you give it a few hours a few days and you watch how things will start merging together there are certain things that what you start finding is is things that you have in common with other people i mean nobody wants to stand around and be a wallflower or brother tell me i'm humble stop lying that is not it at all everybody loves fellowship now a person can say oh i don't like fellowship no you're lying that's not the truth what it is somewhere along in your life you've been hurt and you're not allowing the holy spirit to deal with it and the response and the reaction in your life shows you need healing because it don't feel right is that right percentage i don't like being around big crowds oh brother samuel there's medicine for that there's a greater medicine than that it's the medicine of the holy ghost i'm not knocking medicine but you understand what i'm saying it comes to deal with that because it is a desire within a person's heart to be able to fellowship that's why people can get together with their ball teams right well you got to beg them to support even if it is the sorry browns you don't got to beg them to support it they'll get out there and eat their hot dogs and bratwurst and everything else and knowing there's probably a good chance they're going to boy lose browns would be excited about this one and i wouldn't they won't be tuning in maybe some of their fans will take notice though but i want you to see it in this manner that there's things that can start to come together people that things that they have in common but let me just remind you that you and i were not created for that fellowship that was not the first priority we were created to have fellowship with almighty god and the reality is the rules and sometimes is the things of the world and the appetite it's because of what's still there now let me just say it like this brother graham said i love to fellowship he said there's men out here that love to hunt and love to fish talking about in the in the in the assembly of where that he's ministering at and how that he loves to be with him now he says now he says you know i love to be around people who loves the lord and have fellowship with them because we see the same thing our motives are the same our ideas are the same i said i like to talk to people like that let me just say this like this if you're more comfortable with people of the world than you are with people of god you need the holy ghost plain and simple obviously now i don't know about being around people of god no no because if the love of god is in your heart you're you are a part of that body and that portion inside of you and that unity is greater than the uniting of anything of this earth even if it is your own family there's the uniting on the inside by the baptism of the holy ghost where you've been birthed and born into the body of jesus christ are you with me even with friends of this world listen now over the samuel but we got a witness too many times what we call witnessing is compromising i'm just going to lay it on the line oh i'm trying to win them you don't win them by going on their turf there's a desire when i can talk to somebody a neighbor or something happens at a store that i can have even when i was working there in the school system or i could talk when god would open the door trying to make inroads to talk to somebody but when it came to a place that you you know you're looking at things and they want to go you know out here to eat afterwards and this and that there may not been nothing wrong with the steakhouse but for me i didn't want to be around that atmosphere i knew that in that atmosphere there was going to be jokes flying there's going to be things that i didn't want to hear things i didn't want to be a partaker of come on somebody what is that that's a desire for fellowship but we've got to have the right kind of fellowship listen you don't think the devil ain't sly enough you talk of how that god will begin to deal and work with the life and the enemy will try to line up everybody in the world to try to draw you away from the fellowship that god has for your life brother samuel when god got a hold of your life did you quit your friends no they quit me i'll tell you why because they wanted to tell me you can come out here you can just drink a coke now i said you know what i don't know where it's written in the word but the bible said how can two or three walk together unless they be agreed i said i am not afraid of that i said but what it is i don't want to be around that atmosphere because i said there's been a change that's come into my life it's not what i can't do it's what i don't want to do oh my we're not under a message of reformation we're under a message of transformation amen you see there is a longing for fellowship it's a long among natural but that longing itself that comes from a strain that is placed within man brother branham would speak of that of that strain for fellowship because it's it's something where you can agree together that's what god within it and longing to have fellowship with man brother branham would say i love fellowship with man but the greatest fellowship are you understanding me the greatest fellowship now watch this when we look at with broken fellowship because in the beginning in the garden of eden there was perfect fellowship between god and his people but when sin entered sin broke the fellowship god didn't break the fellowship sin broken you see sin even in your life will interrupt fellowship god will not tread over top of it but he comes to deal with that god let me just let me just deal let me just speak a little bit on that broken fellowship think of how that when god came down in genesis 3 god came down when the announcement went out in heaven that there has that a fall has taken place god didn't send an angel he didn't send nobody else he came down himself now he had been coming down every evening time and would speak to them there was nothing that would prevent them from coming and gathering together when he would come down as a matter of fact when god would come down among them and they would hear the voice of the lord god walking amongst them here god embodied and moving among them they would run to that place a matter of fact they could not wait till that time of evening oh it's drawing close oh oh oh oh darling it's growing close to time for papa to come down there was an excitement where they could not wait to get there into his presence oh glory be to god and here when he came down in that announcement that there was a fall he's the one that begins to call out not adam he calls out where art thou now god knew where he was god knew what all had happened but god's grace and mercy is giving his child an opportunity to come out and say and confess what has taken place oh my let me just say this his presence when he comes it does bring fear it but a fear not a slavish fear or a fear of torment that's satan trying to get in there but the presence of god will bring a holy reverence and a holy fear as david said the fear of the lord is clean it's a fear it's a reverence to where when his word comes to deal and uncover and deal with hindrances it invites us to a place to say yes lord forgive me lord god cleanse me lord jesus iran would take it up in this manner in the message oneness of that perfect harmony that god had with adam and eve he could come down at any time and talk lip to ear to them now i want you to think about it with the prophets god could god would come and his presence would lift then his presence would come on the prophet and it would lift why because that anointing would come to announce redemption is coming but when the lamb of god walked up out of the river jordan the dove came down and abode on the lamb showing that through this sacrifice it will not be the spirit of god coming and leaving and coming and leaving but when the spirit of god through this sacrifice the announcement of the blood when it comes upon your life it does not depart but i will be with you even in you amen i'll abide in you and you will abide in me coming back to this place of where god could come down at any time and talk live to hear any time he desired now one thing we've got to admit his desire is greater than our desire yeah don't matter if you're here or you're on the internet and setting self righteously it don't matter i'm just telling the truth his desire is greater than our desire but it's his desire that comes down that influences us and builds and brings faith and brings courage and stirs things up that we need to be praying for oh glory be to god so man now what you think of brother brown would put it like this he says now there was such a perfect harmony with god till they were one with god god and his family was one and a man in his family a correct good noble obedient family is one with another any family if there's something in that family that moves them apart then it's not right the family is broken somewhere they should all be one father with mother and mother with father children with parent parent with children all in agreement now don't hang up on me now oh brother samuel that's right where i'm at don't hang up on me now because whether you know it or not you're part of the solution and when you see that you'll see one lovely picture now think god's purpose was so that there would be a a a coming together in a union once again where fellowship would be restored and how would that fellowship be restored is when god's nature would come fully on the inside of his children i want you to think of this god we know will not override our own will god will not do that but god works to bring our will in surrender to his will now think of that then he said how that there was a beautiful picture there in the garden of eden no heartache no worry no nothing just joy unspeakable think oh brother samuel if i could just get back there no worries brother samuel do you got a month i could tell you all my worries no i don't even have 30 minutes or you could tell me all your worries and a matter of fact you really don't have to do that because this what god has desired we can come back into that place where the prophet could say us as long as adam had fellowship with god he had no worries oh this is more than don't worry be happy this is a reality when we're in fellowship with him and we have fellowship with him listen let me tell you we're not speaking to the janitor we're not speaking to the secretary we're talking to the main man we're talking to the almighty god who's over it all this ain't like talking to your friends on facebook that can get around it with a pow wow and cry on one another's shoulder oh that's so bad that's so terrible i'm so sorry for you we don't get a lick of health that way but there's one that not only will hear what you're going through but there's virtue in this blood that's able to reach out and deal with that situation and give you strength and give you courage oh glory be to god think of this when there was something that moved his family apart what did god do he came down himself when there's something in your home that good moves apart this is where you have to start saying god let that anointing of redeemer move in my life if there's something that comes up in the church between you and another brother another sister of family let that anointing of redeemer move on my life that reaches out in redemption right now there's stages in redemption forgiveness and reconciliation they're not the same thing but forgiveness will lead to reconciliation is that right oh my it's just like you can forgive somebody and you should because you can't stay praying with faith if you have ought in your heart so you can forgive and look to god to deal with that life to bring reconciliation are you with me oh glory be to god so then when we look that's the only grounds brother brahma said it this way that's the only grounds that god has ever laid down for fellowship is for himself and his church is the oneness of himself in the people that's the only grounds of fellowship the only way you can have those grounds is by union to be united with him forever so how we have this established that this is god's grounds for fellowship is a uniting with him god's desire is and was for communion fellowship and the only way that that those grounds that a fellowship can really be fulfilled is when his life has fully come in us and we're under the blood is that right think of this when god as he came down he came down personally and that was that god laid down the basis of how that he would deal with man because when we talk about fellowship we're talking about relationship you see love itself brother man we put it this way love demands fellowship he said like a young man he becomes interested in a young lady he said but before he can ever have fellowship with her relationship there's got to be necessary agreements with them is laying this out you know it's a theme throughout the whole message because we're in the time where where where let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has come and he lets it be known that no matter what that young man thinks about that young lady he first of all he's got to be able to take her to be his wife there's got to be a proposing is that right and there's got to then be an acceptance it's not brother brown takes us in the church age book he said it's not the woman who decides to accept the man but he said it's the man that is speaking to the woman and the woman accepts that invitation are you with me that's a vow that's a betrothal that's why there is that that necessary of a proposal is that right oh my it's just like when my wife and i were getting ready to get married you know well i say getting ready to get married you know i let her know you know months coming on hey you know what i went and looked at rings i was waiting to see if there was chirp chirp chirp chirp chirp chirp or click on the other end what was i doing i was announcing where the seriousness of the intentions of what's coming on in other words you want to back out go ahead and back out we weren't tied to one another we kept talking it's pretty evident eventually when it came to the proposal she accepted that's pretty evident right there's a lot of manifestation from all that right but you see all of that had to take place that's the same way that god works with our life he doesn't force himself on our life god makes clear through the preaching of the gospel his intention and his desire for fellowship for relationship with us but everything in itself notice there must be a process and god has that process now i want you to think of this in luke 17. i can't read all these scriptures but you're familiar with them but you can read over them tonight or or tomorrow look how god's desire for fellowship when the lord jesus hears standing god made flesh oh my oh my you see brother brown takes that up and he says god came down in the garden and begin to holler for adam and eve he said oh look how look how the spirit of god would take us he said look he said that's why i disagree he said with men just trying to put a social status upon jesus as though him just being a prophet he said it was nothing less than god made manifest listen to me when god became brethren with us it was not a separate person it speaks of how great his condescension was that he so merged himself to become brethren god uses personification personal ways the arm of the lord stretched down the hand of the lord he shows and deals with these things to show how personal that he has become to his people in john 17 as he's standing there and you're aware of of that prayer it's an intercessory prayer it's a prayer of redemption right he said i'm not praying for the whole world but i'm praying for those that are thine for thine or mine that didn't mean they didn't mean where you and i can say well i ain't praying for for any out there no when we're talking about he said i don't pray for the world he is what his prayer is going up is for the elect that would be scattered all the way down through that of the time and then you know and i don't know who's elect and who's not let me just say it to you like this even for a person that you and i come in contact with and you recognize there's no opening they're flying right where they're at i had lunch here back in the fall with an individual god allowed us to come back and reconnect one of my he was one of my coaches when i first started coaching in football one of the first years he was a pastor over here in illyria god allowed us to connect back up and brought it together now i don't know where it's at right now but i knew at that time when we sat down and we began to talk for lunch now i just put myself i'm not there to present a bunch of doctrine i'm not there to try to say glory to god i take this guy for lunch you know he wrote in my car he ain't getting out of here until i deliver every no i'm waiting on god because i only want to deliver if there's something that god presses on my heart for him i could see in just a little bit he wasn't he wasn't probing or looking around for more truth now i don't know where he's at right now now you say brother samuel what are you saying then i'm saying that prayer is because we don't know who's elect and who's not elect and i'll tell you this right now even if they're not elect or you think they're not elect i'm still going to pray for them pray that god open their eyes and get them out of those systems [Applause] that their eyes be really locked into what the sacrifice is because they can't trust in those cursed walls of jericho then walls are cursed god already brought them walls down and god announced in his word cursed be the man that'll raise that up again he'll build it he'll it'll cause him he'll build it in his firstborn there you know what it is it cuts off the supply line of god's grace and god's power so surely we ought to pray god turn their hearts from those cursed walls of jericho because if they see no further we're talking about praying now we're talking about praying because if they see no further well that's that's between them and god and god doesn't let you and i know hell brother samuel god let me know so-and-so's elect you're lying i just tell you right now whether you're here on the internet you're lying we we look at it we don't know who is but we're to stand here with a message and interceding with divine grace and praying with the anointing of redemption upon our life oh come on now hey abraham prayed for lot didn't make lot part of the bride right daniel prayed for enter in intercession for god's mercy but that answering of life the revealing of what was taking place with the image didn't make the rest of them come in they continued right on with their program but they still had life all right so here jesus in 17 john 17 20. notice as he's praying he says neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word how many knows we've got we got a gospel to carry amen that they all may be one as here's the oneness as thou father art in me i in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me you know your life my life is a testimony that don't just point back to a historical event but brings it present that is still the i am that i am because my life is a trophy of the unmerited grace of god that's what your life is a trophy of the glory of god matter of fact your life in my life where christ himself has taken the uppermost seat within our life you realize there was a lot of other things exalted in our life at one time all sorts of things whether it was sports or whatever more a lot of things that were exalted of the world but when he came on the scene those things no longer have the influence and are exalted in our life it's jesus christ that's exalted in our life he's the one who's on display you say how's he to be on display he's on display in our life just like he will be in the new city where the lamb is the light is that right it gives light to all parts that's the same way the light of the holy ghost is in our life right now oh glory be to god notice and the glory which thou gavest me have i given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them vow in me that they may be made perfect in one that the world may know that thou has sent me and has to love me and as thou has loved them as thou has loved me but the random just takes it like this and things that ought to be just think of this here just for a few moments he says jesus only that he asked the father there in john 17 he asked for this one thing that where i am they may be also he asked for our fellowship that's what he asked for that's the only thing he asked the father in prayer is your companionship forever he says oh then how much should we desire him he said if you really are born of the spirit of god that means everything to you it ain't some book of rules you don't live any laws and so forth you live by the grace of god the spirit of god he asked for our fellowship now you know with this right here since the garden of eden remember god provided a way that man had come back into fellowship with him under the shed blood of an innocent we see that with the it was all an antitype or a type that spoke of the antitype that was to come man could come under the shed blood of a of an innocent one and have fellowship with god but it was not the fellowship that they had back in eden it was not the fellowship that we would call perfect fellowship but perfect fellowship it would take god himself to come down and become the sacrifice you see what i'm saying that in order for there to be fellowship it requires sacrifice if i can just condescend just a little bit here it requires in order for fellowship to be in marriage it requires sacrifice it requires sacrifice and even when maybe you had words with one another of course i know nobody here in this church ever does that but let's just say for anybody who's on the internet or for anybody else who just would happen to somehow just stumble across this the only way that when those words you know when words come about between you and your spouse you don't feel right the rest of the evening don't feel right or the rest of the day lord don't fault them they think we're all here but somewhere along the line somebody has got to be redeemer are you with me and all it takes sometimes is one to be the redeemer well i didn't do it she needs to say something i didn't do it he needs to do it but you see god didn't do it we did it but he came down and became our redeemer and he manifested himself as the prophet said in this time as the redeemer anointed one that's the same way god comes to our lives and he'll bring conviction to our life he's not trying to run us down that is the anointing of redeemer that's dealing with our lives to bring us back into fellowship you say conviction hey listen you let words come between you and your wife or you know and somebody else and you begin to go and just let yourself down and say you know what i'm sorry i shouldn't have said that i'm sorry well brother samuel it ain't my fault if you go along that way there'll never be a restoration of fellowship you know what made god so big and so great he's able to make himself so small sometimes god will use situation where we're preaching now sometimes god will use situations that he's drawing humility out of our life to where that communication between husband and wife during your spouse means more to you than anything else means more than a hunting trip more than a fishing trip more than your buddies somewhere else it means more to you how did he redeem us well he didn't just come straight from the womb and go straight to the cross there's a little bit of suffering involved brother graham talked about not just between spouses he talked about even in a family when children aren't warm with their parents and parents one with their children what does that require the anointing of redemption well what does the anointing of redemption speak to relationship not laws come on that doesn't mean oh they just do whatever they want praise god we believe in predestination don't let me go there tonight that is not how predestination works at all that's not how the grace of god works at all the grace of god comes to correct us let us know where we're wrong and where we need to straighten up redemption works to move and heal the wound to bridge the gap to stand in the breach think of how the prophet at this hour what an example as he would stand there and he would see the churches walking before him and he saw that condition of all the church of america and all the rest of me said oh he said i bound my head in shame and said god is that the best that we can do for you i want you i want you to understand right now where the prophet is standing at he's standing right there in that time after the seals and so forth have been opened but as he stood right there notice he says now notice the bride will come in to preview again you think there was times he was discouraged he was discouraged he told us about a complex that had got a hold of him he talked about when he would go to preach to the people and they would tell their women put your hair up so he don't preach on it brother branham would stand and how can i overcome in the tabernacle and say i'm and he said i hear you out there saying brother branham i'm tired of hearing you preach on that he said well i'm tired of seeing you do it there had to be somebody that would stand in the gap with truth for you and i and let me tell you the bride itself is no longer a vision she is on earth now oh glory be to god in the highest how we can take such a lesson here how brother adam could tell us like the disciples said teach us how to pray now these were not ignorant fellows that didn't know how to pray but it's a request teach us how to pray see it's a restoring of those open channels remember many of these right here the disciples when they asked him that they had been raised in homes that believed in praying but you see there's a question that's deeper than just teach us how to pray as far as in our thinking do i get down on my knees do i fold my hands a certain way no it's asking what should we pray for and the only way you can know what to pray for is to be in contact with god and begin to pray for those things as brother branham would say god when we recognize and realize your presence and the god great god of heaven is among us we realize how insufficient we are you see sometimes let's just be honest all through this room sometimes we get too sufficient in ourselves that's a battle friends it's not it's not anything to condemn you but it's a battle but when you can recognize his presence among us then when we really recognize it we recognize just how insufficient we are that that we can't make things happen but we can invite him to teach us what we need to be asking him for because you see god the whole law of the kingdom god's desire is that we would ask ask that your joys might be full ask and he would say you have not because you ask not and the only way you can ask is you must ask in faith and let me tell you something faith itself brother bran would put it like this in god's provided way of fellowship god's provided approach to fellowship brother brown would pick that up and he said now it's not some great super duper sid supernatural faith you need and he takes us right into the waters of separation it was the ashes of the red heifer that was put there in that clean vessel with that of clean and pure water and they were to take hyssop and they were to sprinkle upon the worshiper as he would come near to draw into fellowship and that water is the waters of separation it's the preaching of the gospel and that hyssop brother brown would tell us over and over and over and over it's simple common faith so don't let the devil put it way out there well i've got a hat no god comes and he deals with what faith is already in your life is that right then god himself he's drawing i see our faith is now he's the one that's directing our faith and it's directed in him to come into a place of fellowship and relationship with him i i'm just gonna just pull up there tonight because i don't want to i don't want to push any further it's faith simple faith you see that's everything within our life every promise of god is based on faith you can't get anything the bible said a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways it said to ask without wavering so it's to have faith now to have faith is to know that you have met god's requirements whatever whatever the need or the situation is it requires faith you realize to receive the holy ghost it requires faith in order to receive it it requires faith satan will come just like upon that is the same way that he'll work and try to hinder a life and try to put things in there and try to try to in a manner so that things can remain between our life and god but that's not god's desire it requires faith but the only way that faith can come we know there's got to be repentance there's got to be confession is that right then you come into that place brother braham says how god bringing us into that place and we come into that spot he said and right there standing in that place of the inner court not the holiest of holies but the inner court he said here comes the holy spirit kissing away every fear every doubt but you see we can come in the kitchen and we can fellowship with everybody and eat the word but it's in the living room is where he puts his arms around us it's where he begins to move and what he's dealing with in our life is to get all the shame away from us that's his presence moving in that way to do what bringing about a yielding that we can fully enter into fellowship and into communion with him god made the way that we can enter into fellowship let me just say this just in this manner this is why that things it's just like that can be if there's something that's in our life and the holy spirit brings it to our attention make it right get it right and let's go on with god amen because the bible said if our heart condemn us god's greater than our heart see satan's desire and that's why when there's things we we i desire within our heart there's a longing we'll put that longing there god put that lonely there it's a longing for fellowship it's a desire what is it that's drawn with doing it it's love love demands fellowship now tonight as we've looked at that just a little bit god's desire for fellowship it's something that i believe that in our hearts and our lives i'm just going to say it in this way who wouldn't want that fellowship who wouldn't want that fellowship a man to enter on in into his presence to where his life comes in and that channel is open and there's a transformation there on the inside who wouldn't want that fellowship you see in that place to where everything is gone between you and him there's nothing you and not only has everything been repented of but he he has dealt with every fear with every doubt to where you can stand there in his presence and he comes to do what only he can do you see that's what real prayer is prayer is fellowship with god prayer is not it's not a religious right but prayer is communion where the channel's really been opened back up between us and god and it's a privilege that we have to enter in to his presence that's where real joy is that's where strength is friends that's where we find that all the worries that we can have things that we can hear and look things we can hear and if you allow them to to drop in it can trouble you but if you'll take and cast your cares on him if you'll take the things that are the uncertainties and begin to go to him in prayer and say god i know with you all things are certain there is no unsteadiness there is no variableness with you lord everything is certain now lord jesus i lay all of this rumors or things you know ideas sometimes you you can hear things on the job and well they're getting ready to cut this many people or they're getting ready to do this and they're getting ready to do this and all those things can come about and not saying that those aren't things that couldn't cause worry we've got a place that we can come to and having fellowship with him that he will give us a strength and a fortitude to where worry does not dominate our life but where the love of god and the joy of the lord overshadows our lives let's pray heavenly father lord as once again lord as we come to you lord oh how we stand lord as a people of god lord in need and lord as well as to thank you for the privilege that we have there's not one one person but what has an opportunity to enter into fellowship with you lord and i pray god tonight i i don't know lord here throughout the internet lord i don't know but you know every need you know every heart you're the one who's directed this service lord not only the placing of things together but of that unction lord that you would place on my heart and you would deliver it lord and there's a reason there's a purpose lord i pray that god if there be any life lord that's here tonight or listening that maybe their life has just been a ceremony it's not been something that's real it's been of like rules of do this and don't do that late tonight lord god they it be lord such a reality would strike their life that there is a desire that you have for fellowship that god that it's your desire to bring deliverance to bring healing to bring real relationship to their life for lord god when you you came to redeem us you never sent down a book no you came yourself [Music] you took upon the image of man that you might press your image back through man [Music] lord right here tonight i pray for every heart and every life that's gathered here those under the sound of my voice [Music] lord god even among families among homes among brothers sisters lord god a longing and a desire for fellowship [Music] oh god may we move lord with that anointing of redeemer i pray god among us lord may there not be lord found in our life if there is may we lord quickly lord side with the word and cast it aside lord god where there would be lord that of a real forgiveness lord because that alone that is the grounds that can lead to a reconciling or jesus it's forgiveness that produces faith trust [Music] confidence lord help us tonight lord father every one of us that's gathered here lord i don't believe lord that god there's one that's here tonight just to be seen but it's a desire in our hearts lord maybe there's something lord that may be a lord it's an attitude the god that we've allowed to come upon us maybe it's a spirit of complacency maybe lord god it's a lack of patience [Music] lord god you're present to deal and to make these things known to our lives that whatever it might be lord that would be hindering that fellowship or that communion father you're here tonight lord you're here to minister lord to our lives

life think about it god doesn't come in this service like this that we would walk out with our heads saying no no that's not that's not a diet of faith but a diet of faith that even in the midst of our wrong we have an assurance that if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us that we can walk out of here in fellowship with god [Music] it builds faith that builds confidence to

my may we may we just be in prayer may we just take it upon our hearts and say lord with a greater determination not just something we just say here tonight but something to say lord [Music] i'm not

try to put things in it jam my life or put these different things lord help me by the grace of god that my life can stay as an open channel lord when i'm reading the word when i'm listening to the message when i come and hear the word of god being ministered lord that where i might stay in fellowship that if there's anything that gets in the way that the spirit of god the waters of separation
