[19:35] so he had to go to
[19:40] cavalry
[19:45] where he shed his
[19:48] last drop of blood for me
[19:56] and the jury found
[19:59] him guilty of love in the first degree
[20:09] as he stood in the judgment hall that
[20:12] day I find no fault in him Pilate had to
[20:16] say
[20:17] an angry crowd

[20:24] Jesus guilty of love in the first degree
[20:30] order in the court would you bring the

[20:40] you are accused of healing on the
[20:43] Sabbath day and many other things the
[20:45] elders did say and they say your
[20:48] disciples pluck corn on the Sabbath day
[20:49] and did eat and ye yourself set with
[20:53] sinners at meat so what have you to say
[20:56] but he kept silent that day but let's
[21:00] see what the witnesses have to say
[21:03] my name is bartimaeus I was blind and
[21:07] could not see the light of day oh but I
[21:10] can see today because of him and then
[21:14] another came and he said my name was
[21:15] legion i lived among the tombs until one
[21:19] day he came by my way and then there was
[21:22] another and he said i was a leper i was
[21:25] one of the ten and i've come back this
[21:28] final time just to glorify him and on
[21:31] and on they came that day and each had
[21:34] kind words for him to say but the crowd
[21:37] began to cry crucify crucify give us
[21:40] Barabbas this man here he must die and
[21:44] so they led him away to a place called
[21:46] Calvary and nailed him to a cross
[21:48] between two thieves for the jury had
[21:51] surely found him guilty guilty of love
[21:55] in the first degree
[21:57] guilty
[21:59] on love in the first degree
[22:07] so we had to go to
[22:13] Calvary

[45:05] you know I had thinning hair when I was
[45:07] 17 I already had
[45:10] and then I also want to announce here we
[45:13] have a special announcement as well
[45:15] brother Brian jr. and sister Gracie
[45:19] announced their engagement
[45:28] so the Lord willing though Lord willing
[45:32] to be married here sometime in the fall
[45:33] I think they're kind of des settled I
[45:36] would let them announce that date so we
[45:40] just are sold so happy amen for them
[45:46] well I told Jax one I meant acts too
[45:55] Acts chapter 2 verse 1
[45:59] and
[46:01] when the day of Pentecost was fully come
[46:05] they were all with
[46:08] one Accord in one place and suddenly
[46:13] there came a sound from heaven as of a
[46:16] rushing mighty wind and it filled all
[46:19] the house where they were sitting
[46:21] and there appeared unto them cloven
[46:24] tongues like as a fire and it sat upon
[46:28] each of them and they were filled with
[46:32] the Holy Ghost and began to speak with
[46:35] other tongues as the Spirit gave them
[46:39] utterance
[46:41] now in the scripture you you're aware
[46:45] that how many were gathered outside of
[46:48] there even in the in the continuing
[46:50] scriptures and they had asked the
[46:52] question in verse 12 they were all there
[46:55] and they were amazed and were in doubt
[46:58] saying one to another what meaneth this
[47:05] and others mocking said these men are
[47:07] full of new wine
[47:10] then we find Peter here he stands up and
[47:13] declares the fulfillment of the
[47:16] scripture he says in verse 14 Peter
[47:19] standing up with the eleven lifted up
[47:21] his voice and said unto them you men of
[47:24] Judea and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem
[47:26] be this known unto you and hearken to my
[47:29] words for these are not drunken as ye
[47:32] suppose seeing it is but the third hour
[47:35] of the day but this is that which was
[47:38] spoken by the Prophet Joel and it shall
[47:42] come to pass in the last days saith god
[47:44] i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh
[47:47] and your sons and your daughters shall
[47:49] prophesy and your young men shall see
[47:52] visions and your old men shall see
[47:55] dreams and on my servants and on my
[47:58] handmaidens I will pour out in those
[48:00] days of my spirit and they shall
[48:03] prophesy and I will show wonders in
[48:06] heaven above and signs in the earth
[48:07] beneath blood and fire and vapor of
[48:10] smoke the Sun shall be turned into
[48:13] darkness and the moon into blood before
[48:15] that great and notable day of the Lord
[48:18] come and it shall come to pass that
[48:20] whosoever shall call on the name of the
[48:24] Lord shall be saved
[48:28] amen we're gonna let you be seated and I
[48:31] just want to continue reading here in
[48:33] the scripture
[48:44] here let's go to verse 32 in that same
[48:46] chapter
[48:50] Peter's Peter here Peter is declaring
[48:53] the prophecy that has come to pass in
[48:57] the outpouring of the Holy Spirit which
[49:01] is the result of the sacrifice that was
[49:06] offered out of that perfect sacrifice
[49:08] now that life can come back upon the
[49:13] worshiper so here Peter is declaring in
[49:16] verse 32 this Jesus hath God raised up
[49:21] whereof we all are witnesses therefore
[49:25] being by the right hand of God exalted
[49:28] and having received of the father the
[49:30] promise of the Holy Ghost he hath shed
[49:34] for this which he now see and here for
[49:38] David is not ascended into the heavens
[49:40] but he saith himself the Lord said unto
[49:44] my lord sit thou on my right hand until
[49:47] I make thine
[49:50] until and sit down on my right hand
[49:52] until I make thy fold thy foes thy
[49:56] footstool therefore let all the house of
[49:59] Israel know assuredly that God hath made
[50:05] that same Jesus whom ye have crucified
[50:08] both Lord and Christ and I want to just
[50:10] pause there just for just a brief moment
[50:13] here you find remember when the the
[50:17] disciples had went away and they had
[50:20] departed from Jerusalem after the
[50:23] crucifixion of the Lord Jesus and they
[50:26] were walking on their way in Luke 24
[50:28] they were going away from Jerusalem but
[50:31] when he appeared to them on the road to
[50:35] Emmaus he made himself known to them by
[50:38] by the scriptures or in the scriptures
[50:42] that indeed what was spoken has come to
[50:45] pass they in their mind they did not
[50:48] understand it and you remember as we
[50:50] been through that in the scriptures
[50:52] there many things that he said they did
[50:54] not catch regarding the suffering they
[50:58] didn't see that but it wasn't necessary
[51:01] in that hour that they catch it but it
[51:04] would be necessary that they would catch
[51:07] that of the suffering in that time so
[51:10] that they could see that the payment had
[51:13] been made that now once the payment is
[51:16] made they can receive the earnest from
[51:20] that payment in other words to receive
[51:22] the life of the sacrifice inside of them
[51:25] so notice notice what the the unfolding
[51:30] of of the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ
[51:33] does it brings them not going away from
[51:37] where the promise is but it brings them
[51:40] back to where the promise is to be
[51:43] poured out it must begin in Jerusalem is
[51:49] that right that is where that the Holy
[51:52] Spirit was to be pulled out because
[51:54] remember God had made a promise and
[51:57] brother and sister this morning
[51:59] every promise that God has made he keeps
[52:02] it he doesn't have to alter it and say
[52:06] well you know maybe I meant this or
[52:08] maybe this or maybe that or maybe it can
[52:10] be out here in Galilee nope it's to be
[52:13] in Jerusalem
[52:15] amen remember it was there in Jerusalem
[52:18] he chose to place his name there and to
[52:21] think about it God was declaring there
[52:23] in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[52:26] that indeed the promise that he had
[52:28] given to Israel all the covenants and
[52:31] everything that was made he kept every
[52:34] promise of that word right to the dot
[52:38] and here Peter he is standing as an
[52:41] exponent and he is addressing notice
[52:44] what the Bible said here let all the
[52:47] house of Israel know assuredly that God
[52:51] hath made that same Jesus whom ye have
[52:54] crucified both the Lord in Christ oh I
[52:58] tell you my heart is looking for the
[53:01] time where that same call will go forth
[53:04] through the hundred forty-four thousand
[53:06] over there in the land and that same
[53:09] Gospel message will be preached to the
[53:12] 144,000
[53:14] all the house of Israel know assuredly
[53:18] so you see in the midst then of the time
[53:21] we we see where Israel you know they
[53:24] they were blinded for our sakes
[53:28] they were blinded so that you and I
[53:32] could be brought in that was all part of
[53:34] the mystery that lay there in we're all
[53:37] the way in the Old Testament it was a
[53:39] mystery that lay there in Christ that
[53:42] you and I could be brought in now to
[53:45] think of this and that was already many
[53:47] of those places were already spoken of
[53:50] in the Old Testament even where Paul
[53:52] would record in the book of Galatians I
[53:55] believe Galatians three where God
[53:57] preached to Abraham and saying that the
[54:00] HUD the the heathen would be justified
[54:03] how that God would would pour out the
[54:06] spirit are there upon us as Gentiles and
[54:10] to think of it you and I on I want you
[54:12] to catch this now you and I as Gentiles
[54:15] were not looking for the Messiah as a
[54:18] matter of fact Paul picks it up very
[54:20] clearly there was no promises that was
[54:23] made per se to us but the promises were
[54:26] made to Israel yet there were promises
[54:29] that pertained to us but we didn't know
[54:33] it
[54:35] but when it came time for us that we
[54:38] would know the promises that were made
[54:40] for us God would make sure that we would
[54:44] know those promises and when he makes
[54:47] known the promise brother he just
[54:49] doesn't give you something that's empty
[54:52] he provides what is needed that you
[54:55] might be a partaker of that promise just
[54:58] as he has done down through these past
[55:01] two thousand years when he would when
[55:03] the word would go forth and be expressed
[55:06] there were those of the Church of the
[55:08] Living God that would receive a deposit
[55:11] of the Holy Spirit that made them ready
[55:15] from waiting and longing for the coming
[55:18] of the Lord in his corporal body
[55:22] hallelujah now I want you to think of
[55:25] this here you know this morning
[55:27] when Peter he speaks this and he speaks
[55:32] it to the whole house of Israel and and
[55:35] and notice the Bible says in verse 37
[55:38] when they heard this
[55:41] they were pricked in their heart and
[55:43] they said unto Peter and to the rest of
[55:46] the Apostles men and brethren what shall
[55:49] we do I need some gas up here in these
[55:52] monitors there's nothing what shall we
[55:55] do then Peter said unto them repent and
[55:58] be baptized every one of you in the name
[56:02] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[56:05] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[56:09] the Holy Ghost I want you to look at
[56:12] this very and we've been really really
[56:14] covering this in combing it and combing
[56:16] it but you realize the Holy Ghost is not
[56:19] anything that you merit
[56:22] you don't earn it
[56:24] it is the gift of the Holy Ghost there's
[56:29] only two things that you and I are
[56:31] required to do and it's His grace that
[56:34] would even lead us to that and that is
[56:37] repentance and you know the Bible says
[56:39] that the goodness of God leads us to
[56:42] repentance
[56:43] are you with me so here to even repent
[56:47] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[56:50] Jesus Christ in the name of our
[56:52] sacrifice we are identifying when we
[56:54] repent of our sins and you see
[56:57] conviction has to strike the heart you
[56:59] know friends conviction a very sign of
[57:02] impending judgment is when conviction is
[57:05] leaving the hearts of men people are no
[57:09] longer under conviction at all they're
[57:12] no longer under conviction for the
[57:14] things that they do you know come
[57:16] to church and everything the way that it
[57:18] is and no longer under conviction I'll
[57:21] tell you that's an endtime saying it's a
[57:23] sign right now that we're living here in
[57:26] the final moments in the final days you
[57:29] see when Peter began to speak this you
[57:32] know Peter was not just quoting words
[57:35] but it was the Spirit of God within
[57:37] Peter that was quoting there of the
[57:40] Psalms and what the promises pertained
[57:43] to the Messiah it was the Holy Ghost not
[57:46] not the voice of Peter that brought
[57:49] conviction
[57:50] it was the Holy Ghost not the voice of
[57:53] Peter that led them to the place of
[57:55] eternal life the Holy Ghost just
[57:58] borrowed Peters natural voice
[58:02] hmm I'm trying to get somewhere now
[58:07] amen it that is what God would call us
[58:10] to do notice what verse 39 says the
[58:12] promise is unto you and to your children
[58:17] and to all that are afar off even as
[58:21] many as the Lord our God shall call in
[58:27] that wonderful
[58:28] the promise is unto you and to your
[58:32] children even as many as are afar off
[58:36] that was you and our brother and sister
[58:38] we were nowhere near there we were afar
[58:41] off but God knew where we were and the
[58:45] same God that knew where we were he
[58:48] knows exactly where our children are he
[58:51] knows exactly where our loved ones are
[58:53] he's the same God
[58:59] you with me this morning when the
[59:01] prodigal son went away he went the
[59:05] father woody was not down there in the
[59:07] Pigpen contacting him you understand me
[59:10] he wasn't down there but what it was it
[59:13] was the angel of the Lord that brought
[59:15] conviction to his heart and he started
[59:19] to think differently about home
[59:22] who changed he did home didn't change he
[59:27] was changing even though the father and
[59:30] the mother could not see anything but
[59:33] yet the angel of the Lord was turned
[59:36] clearly you and I are no are not more
[59:39] powerful than the Holy Ghost it takes
[59:42] the Holy Ghost to take a whole it takes
[59:45] the Holy Spirit there to grab ahold of
[59:48] that line it takes the Spirit of God to
[59:50] work on that heart and bring it to a
[59:53] surrender
[59:56] many times when I gave my testimony it
[59:59] wasn't so much a surrender it's just
[1:00:01] flat-out God made an arrest
[1:00:07] you're with me God just made an arrest I
[1:00:10] had other plans but God made an arrest
[1:00:14] God said wait a minute your plans that's
[1:00:17] what you made but now it's time for you
[1:00:19] to come into my plans for you
[1:00:25] Oh glory I'm glad he's still in the
[1:00:27] arresting business aren't you
[1:00:30] know what Peter said and with many words
[1:00:34] many other words did he testify and
[1:00:37] exhort saying save
[1:00:39] yourselves from this
[1:00:42] untoward generation
[1:00:44] then they that gladly received his word
[1:00:47] were baptized and the same day there
[1:00:51] were added unto them about 3,000 souls
[1:00:54] now let you turn with me to the
[1:00:57] Leviticus 25 here I
[1:01:00] still just wanting to continue here on
[1:01:03] the fault that we were looking at just a
[1:01:05] few weeks ago
[1:01:08] on that of Pentecost and the Jubilee
[1:01:14] and I want to look here in Leviticus 25
[1:01:19] verse 8
[1:01:25] we read just a few verses scripture here
[1:01:29] just trust the Lord or bring it all
[1:01:31] together for us
[1:01:34] and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of
[1:01:38] years unto thee seven times seven years
[1:01:42] now remember every seven years the land
[1:01:45] would go into a time of rest when the
[1:01:49] land would go into a time of rest during
[1:01:52] the seventh year even the person who was
[1:01:56] in slavery and they altered debt they
[1:01:59] were not released during that time
[1:02:01] however during the seventh year came a
[1:02:05] time of rest to where the debt that they
[1:02:08] owed nothing could be extracted or or
[1:02:12] required to be given within that seventh
[1:02:14] year because the seventh year remember
[1:02:16] what grew in the seventh year you to let
[1:02:19] it grow and don't touch it
[1:02:21] right so there would be a time of rest a
[1:02:25] time of reprieve and then it's right
[1:02:27] back into that into that cycle and here
[1:02:30] they are coming back into that you know
[1:02:32] still slaving still slaving away it's
[1:02:34] still slaving away but notice here what
[1:02:37] God is speaking of is this time of the
[1:02:40] Jubilee and Jubilee means 50 right
[1:02:43] Pentecost itself means 50
[1:02:46] right now and the space of the seventh
[1:02:50] Sabbath's of years shall be into the
[1:02:52] forty and nine years so seven Sabbath's
[1:02:56] of seven times seven forty-nine years
[1:02:59] then shalt thou calls the trumpet of the
[1:03:02] Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the
[1:03:06] seventh month in the day of atonement
[1:03:10] shall you make the trumpet sound
[1:03:13] throughout all your land and you shall
[1:03:17] hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim
[1:03:20] Liberty throughout all the land unto all
[1:03:23] the inhabitants thereof it shall be a
[1:03:26] jubilee
[1:03:26] unto you and you shall return every man
[1:03:30] unto his possession and you shall return
[1:03:33] every man unto his family
[1:03:35] now I want you to look at this the
[1:03:38] trumpet itself was sounded there in the
[1:03:41] 49th year it was sounded on the Day of
[1:03:44] Atonement
[1:03:45] but the trumpet is what alerted and
[1:03:48] announced that the Jubilee is all it was
[1:03:52] that where they were looking forward to
[1:03:54] that and remember look how the scripture
[1:03:56] is placed here in verse 9 it speaks in
[1:03:59] the seventh month in the Day of
[1:04:01] Atonement
[1:04:02] ye shall make the trumpet sound
[1:04:04] throughout all your land now remember
[1:04:07] that atonement it's that which would
[1:04:09] it's that which brings
[1:04:12] where we are accepted in him remember
[1:04:15] where Israel would go down would have to
[1:04:19] every year once once a year there would
[1:04:22] be a cleansing of the sanctuary each
[1:04:25] year there was that offering of the red
[1:04:28] heifer there all of those parts were
[1:04:30] known the scapegoat and and the live
[1:04:32] goat all of those things within itself
[1:04:34] was that which was rendered there on the
[1:04:36] day of atonement but remember the time
[1:04:39] of atonement itself was when you read in
[1:04:42] the Book of Leviticus when you
[1:04:44] especially when you read in Leviticus 23
[1:04:46] it refers back over to Leviticus 16
[1:04:50] where the Passover lamb was offered up
[1:04:53] and that Passover lamb is the Lord Jesus
[1:04:56] Christ he was offered once and for all
[1:05:01] we don't we don't need Jesus plus we
[1:05:05] need the Lord Jesus and him alone
[1:05:08] through and by his offering brother
[1:05:11] every in every sin and every devil has
[1:05:14] already been conquered the Bible said he
[1:05:17] was in the world and and you know as he
[1:05:20] was here he was tempted in all manner
[1:05:22] such as we are yet without sin when he
[1:05:25] stood there in Pilate saw they could not
[1:05:28] find any Fault in him it was testified
[1:05:31] before even all the unbelievers they
[1:05:33] could not find any Fault in him but
[1:05:36] brother even when man couldn't find no
[1:05:38] fault in him what was glorious is God
[1:05:41] found no fault in him
[1:05:45] the Bible says in Isaiah 53 that he saw
[1:05:50] his offering when he shall make his soul
[1:05:53] an offering for sin he shall be
[1:05:56] satisfied I
[1:05:59] hope you preach him in just a moment
[1:06:01] here you see God looks Beyond and down
[1:06:04] into the depths of that heart he knew
[1:06:07] that so it was being willfully
[1:06:10] surrendered there on behalf of you and I
[1:06:13] ha he made the ransom payment that you
[1:06:16] and I could go 3 and how that God looked
[1:06:19] upon the head and through his offering
[1:06:21] the Bible says in Isaiah 53 he would
[1:06:25] justify many
[1:06:29] glory be to God I don't want to get
[1:06:32] ahead of myself but I'm gonna go ahead
[1:06:34] and say it anyhow I tell you right now
[1:06:36] he's already paid the prize for whatever
[1:06:40] it is that you have need of this morning
[1:06:43] if you need deliverance he's already
[1:06:46] paid the price if you need healing he's
[1:06:49] already paid the price if you need the
[1:06:52] Holy Ghost he is the way
[1:06:57] it's him and him alone
[1:07:05] Alleluia
[1:07:07] or glory be to God you see this Jubilee
[1:07:12] year think how God would give these
[1:07:14] types and these shadows would lay here
[1:07:17] within the scripture and how that
[1:07:20] slavery it would it would speak here how
[1:07:22] that there would be times that would
[1:07:25] come up where we're an Israelite they
[1:07:28] would they would have to
[1:07:31] you know sell of themselves in order to
[1:07:34] pay a debt they would go and begin to
[1:07:37] labor and yet you know within the
[1:07:39] labouring of that right there you see
[1:07:42] within this this land of Israel they
[1:07:45] were each one given an inheritance
[1:07:50] they were given an inheritance when they
[1:07:54] were down there in Egypt God had already
[1:07:57] made a promise before when before they
[1:07:59] were ever in Egypt God had already made
[1:08:01] a promise when he was making this known
[1:08:03] to Abraham regarding that it would be
[1:08:06] the seed your seed will be a stranger
[1:08:10] they will sojourn in a strange land but
[1:08:13] I will bring them into this land God
[1:08:17] already was lending know this
[1:08:19] inheritance here belongs to the seed of
[1:08:23] Abraham and right now I'm speaking of
[1:08:25] Israel in the natural and remember what
[1:08:27] God's desire was was for Israel they're
[1:08:30] gonna be brought out of Egypt and come
[1:08:32] into this land that belonged to them
[1:08:35] their inheritance because in this land
[1:08:38] they could serve the purpose of God God
[1:08:42] himself would put them in position where
[1:08:45] they belong is that right now within
[1:08:48] that that inheritance that even that you
[1:08:51] and I that we'll look at here this
[1:08:53] morning for a little bit that
[1:08:54] inheritance that it was given to us as
[1:08:57] the children of God is that of the Holy
[1:09:00] Ghost to be in Christ and Christ Himself
[1:09:04] is the word is that right it is the word
[1:09:07] you see you can't be in Christ and deny
[1:09:10] the word because you're denying him that
[1:09:14] would be like an Israelite being in
[1:09:16] their land and saying well you know well
[1:09:18] you know I like this part of the land
[1:09:19] but I don't like that part of the land
[1:09:21] but everything that when they came in to
[1:09:24] their inheritance they were to possess
[1:09:26] the land the inheritance that God gave
[1:09:30] them and brother let me tell you
[1:09:32] something if May there was those and you
[1:09:34] know that did not have an interest in
[1:09:36] going into the land they didn't go in
[1:09:38] the land but for those who had a desire
[1:09:41] to go into the land and a hunger to go
[1:09:44] in the land rather all the unbelief
[1:09:46] could be around there but they knew that
[1:09:48] God made the promise and God was big
[1:09:51] enough to back that promise up
[1:09:54] that has to be caught to do that it was
[1:09:58] a Joshua that opened up from the Jordan
[1:10:02] it was the Lord God that opened up the
[1:10:05] Jordan it showed that you can't get into
[1:10:08] this land but the efforts of man it has
[1:10:11] to be an act of Almighty God they
[1:10:14] couldn't decide and say we're Joshua
[1:10:16] I'll go on down the stream a little bit
[1:10:19] and I'll enter into another place there
[1:10:21] was one way into this land you got to
[1:10:25] come through the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:10:27] Christ there's one way there's one
[1:10:30] opening and that is through the Lord
[1:10:33] Jesus Christ into this land
[1:10:37] Oh
[1:10:38] glory be to God the debt itself you see
[1:10:43] God lays this promise down here in the
[1:10:45] word and the Lord was letting it be
[1:10:48] known here it was it was this which
[1:10:51] would prevent an oppression it was also
[1:10:55] where God was declaring that the debt
[1:10:58] won't be forever
[1:11:03] that was God God was declaring this this
[1:11:06] was a type of what God was speaking of
[1:11:08] when he let it be known for Israel that
[1:11:11] in the natural seed of Abraham but it
[1:11:14] was a type of the spiritual seed of
[1:11:16] Abraham and he will also be fulfilled in
[1:11:19] that and the gathering of the 144,000
[1:11:26] and God also let it be known these are
[1:11:30] all I'm drawing this out of the
[1:11:31] verticals 25 here God let it be known
[1:11:34] that what that it that the Israel those
[1:11:37] of the sons of Israel they were his
[1:11:40] servants they belonged to him and that
[1:11:43] the inheritance you know the inheritance
[1:11:46] would remain with the tribe of whom it
[1:11:48] belongs you know even when a man was
[1:11:50] sold into slavery his inheritance
[1:11:52] remained with the tribe that he was a
[1:11:56] part of
[1:11:58] he could not diminish that inheritance
[1:12:01] it was there that inheritance was for
[1:12:04] him Oh
[1:12:05] glory be to God brothers sister although
[1:12:09] the fall when the fall came there hinge
[1:12:12] Allah in there in Genesis 3 and it was
[1:12:14] announced but brother our inheritance
[1:12:17] was not taken away it was not diminished
[1:12:20] it was not transferred to somebody else
[1:12:22] but God himself would make a way that we
[1:12:27] could be brought back to our inheritance
[1:12:32] hallelujah think of this of even you
[1:12:34] know where the land the inheritance it's
[1:12:36] never to be taken or lost even from a
[1:12:39] tribe and this this land this heritage
[1:12:43] what what belongs to us it belongs to us
[1:12:46] I'm inside real clear it belongs to us
[1:12:49] and to our children
[1:12:53] I sure had a big Amen on that this
[1:12:56] inheritance belongs to us and to our
[1:12:59] children even as many as the Lord our
[1:13:02] God shall call
[1:13:07] when they came into the land
[1:13:10] God knew
[1:13:12] Israel would get away from what God set
[1:13:16] forth they came into the land they had
[1:13:18] wells they didn't dig houses they didn't
[1:13:20] build vineyards they didn't plant all of
[1:13:22] those things God let him know if you'll
[1:13:25] just focus on me and let me be the
[1:13:27] center of your life I'll take care of
[1:13:28] all these other things
[1:13:31] you know him being the center of your
[1:13:33] life isn't just looking and saying I
[1:13:35] Love You Lord Jesus but it's also
[1:13:37] dealing with sin when he comes and
[1:13:39] knocks on our door and says hey you need
[1:13:41] to take care of this hey you need to get
[1:13:43] this out of your life hey you need to
[1:13:45] address this
[1:13:47] is that right he let him know all of
[1:13:50] this are provided but when you go in the
[1:13:52] land there's lingering remnants and you
[1:13:54] need to tear them down
[1:13:56] tear down all of those of those trees
[1:13:59] that are known as groves get rid of them
[1:14:01] get rid of the idols tear down the
[1:14:03] pictures get rid of all that stuff clear
[1:14:06] it out of the land
[1:14:08] hmm
[1:14:10] God let him know here Israel would you
[1:14:14] know they would get away and think of
[1:14:15] how the Scriptures would portray it they
[1:14:18] would go to dig to themselves broken
[1:14:21] cisterns
[1:14:22] they and God was the one who would water
[1:14:25] their crops
[1:14:27] are you with me why did they have to
[1:14:29] start going to these other means
[1:14:31] they want to know how to you know how to
[1:14:34] fix their family problems how to fix all
[1:14:36] these other things and they go to all
[1:14:38] these other means rather and sister I'm
[1:14:40] telling you Jesus Christ is the answer
[1:14:46] who want to go to all these other means
[1:14:48] and what happens is the reason they had
[1:14:51] to start going to all those other all
[1:14:53] those other avenues you see what it does
[1:14:56] it shifts it to where it is the works of
[1:14:59] their hands what they're trying to do
[1:15:02] what they're trying to maintain they're
[1:15:04] trying to bring the water to the cross
[1:15:05] but God told them in Leviticus 22 this
[1:15:08] land is not like the land of Egypt you
[1:15:11] do not water your crops with your foot i
[1:15:14] Lord my eyes are upon this land I care
[1:15:17] for it I'm the one who brings water I'm
[1:15:20] the one who irrigate sit I'm the one who
[1:15:22] sees that water gets there I'll tell you
[1:15:24] right now if we can allow the water if
[1:15:26] the Holy Ghost the washing of water by
[1:15:29] the word brother he knows how to clear
[1:15:31] how every irrigation he knows how to
[1:15:33] clear out every ditch every stream every
[1:15:36] valley he knows how through you and I
[1:15:38] can stay clean and stay unclogged and
[1:15:41] untainted from the things of the world
[1:15:44] that the life of the Holy Ghost might
[1:15:46] move through us and water that seed
[1:15:51] it was a time of grace that's what the
[1:15:53] Jubilee was
[1:15:55] it didn't matter you could have went you
[1:15:58] could have went in bondage on the 48th
[1:16:00] year
[1:16:01] when the trumpets sounded you were going
[1:16:04] free
[1:16:05] it didn't matter if somebody had they
[1:16:08] had had been in debt and they had been
[1:16:10] serving for 47 or 48 years it did not
[1:16:13] matter
[1:16:16] this was the grace of Almighty God
[1:16:21] Amen that that sounding would come forth
[1:16:24] and you see it speaks even in this earth
[1:16:27] that you and I live upon you know the
[1:16:30] Bible says that in the Book of Psalms
[1:16:32] that the earth is the Lord's and the
[1:16:35] fullness thereof
[1:16:38] God Himself is bringing this earth
[1:16:41] through Redemption
[1:16:45] this earth belongs to him if God didn't
[1:16:48] write about all the other planets it was
[1:16:49] the earth that God that got his
[1:16:51] attention his focus was upon this of the
[1:16:54] earth
[1:16:55] is that right and so here God even
[1:16:59] within this it speaks of God's word and
[1:17:02] a sounding of the Jubilee for that even
[1:17:05] of the earth where God himself is
[1:17:07] leading the earth as he led it in the
[1:17:10] days of Noah there through repentance
[1:17:12] and water baptism he baptized it in me
[1:17:15] he baptized this water this earth in the
[1:17:18] days of Noah and then here when when he
[1:17:21] came himself when he created a body he
[1:17:24] himself he paid the price brother he not
[1:17:27] only redeems you and I but revenge in
[1:17:29] history by about all that belongs to you
[1:17:32] it stirred by that all that belongs to
[1:17:34] him and here his blood was shed and he
[1:17:39] claimed this earth what he had what had
[1:17:42] already come through repentance he
[1:17:44] claims it there with the blood that was
[1:17:47] shed and brother it's to get a baptism
[1:17:50] there a fire in the Millenium cleansing
[1:17:52] it there sanctifying it and when the new
[1:17:55] home comes it will set down the baptism
[1:17:59] of the Holy Ghost it will sat down in
[1:18:02] the new home
[1:18:05] he is bringing the earth
[1:18:10] back home the earth that was killed it
[1:18:15] will come up right I
[1:18:18] say can you do that I
[1:18:21] mean I can bet that something you know
[1:18:23] and most of a lot of you out baptized I
[1:18:25] can baptize you even with the help of
[1:18:27] somebody else but there's anybody in
[1:18:29] here think you could baptize this earth
[1:18:33] nope it had to be God and brother in the
[1:18:38] same God is the same one that dealt on
[1:18:40] your hearts even though God used the
[1:18:42] hand and the strength of man to lower
[1:18:44] you down but it was God that moved on
[1:18:46] your heart to submit yourself and say I
[1:18:49] want to be baptized in the name of the
[1:18:51] Lord Jesus Christ and then he steps in
[1:18:54] and does what no man foreknew he
[1:18:57] takes you have that passes you into
[1:19:00] himself
[1:19:04] hallelujah
[1:19:07] amen
[1:19:08] is a time of Jubilee and how that God
[1:19:13] would call us back to himself the Bible
[1:19:15] says blessed in Matthew 5:5 blessed are
[1:19:18] the meek for they shall inherit the
[1:19:19] earth
[1:19:21] think about this the acceptable year of
[1:19:24] the Lord
[1:19:27] read with me in Isaiah 49 would you
[1:19:34] Isaiah 49
[1:19:44] Oh
[1:19:46] the promises of God are just wonderful
[1:19:48] aren't they
[1:19:49] it's wonderful to have eyes to see and
[1:19:52] ears to hear him
[1:19:54] amen now watch your how that God would
[1:19:59] be speaking speaking of Israel but you
[1:20:01] and I are tucked in here as well in for
[1:20:04] Isaiah 49 8 thus saith the Lord in an
[1:20:09] acceptable time have I heard me and in a
[1:20:13] day of salvation have I helped me and I
[1:20:17] will preserve thee and give thee for a
[1:20:20] covenant of the people who's that
[1:20:23] speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ to
[1:20:26] establish the earth to cause to inherit
[1:20:31] the desolate Heritage's
[1:20:34] that thou may uh say to the prisoners go
[1:20:39] forth to them that are in darkness show
[1:20:43] yourselves they shall feed in the ways
[1:20:45] and their pastures shall be in all high
[1:20:49] places
[1:20:51] go over to Luke chapter 4
[1:21:11] Luke chapter 4 here
[1:21:16] the Lord Jesus here the scroll of Isaiah
[1:21:18] is delivered to him what's road in Hosea
[1:21:22] 61 and here he picks it up the Bible
[1:21:25] says in verse 17 and there was delivered
[1:21:27] unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah
[1:21:29] and when he had opened the book he found
[1:21:31] the place where it was written the
[1:21:34] Spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:21:38] now he's reading the scripture
[1:21:41] but it's more than just reading
[1:21:44] this is a declaration of what has been
[1:21:48] wrote is now in fulfillment
[1:21:54] this one's just a scripture reading the
[1:21:57] Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he
[1:22:00] hath anointed me to preach the gospel to
[1:22:05] the poor he hath sent me to heal the
[1:22:07] brokenhearted to preach deliverance to
[1:22:10] the captives and recovering of sight to
[1:22:12] the blind to set at liberty them that
[1:22:15] are bruised to preach the acceptable
[1:22:19] year of the Lord now remember here the
[1:22:25] Lord Jesus Eirias he's a he is
[1:22:27] announcing
[1:22:28] this time in that we're the Jubilee it's
[1:22:32] time for the Jubilee the acceptable year
[1:22:35] it's time for this to be ushered in to
[1:22:38] where the captives can go free to where
[1:22:41] those who are blind that they can
[1:22:43] receive sight those who are bruised
[1:22:45] where they can be healed now to think
[1:22:48] here it was even before before he went
[1:22:51] to Calvary think of how that he moved
[1:22:54] down there in through the coast you know
[1:22:56] of the Israel how many lives that were
[1:22:59] touched there as they themselves were
[1:23:01] looking like the woman at the well her
[1:23:03] life was touched her life was changed
[1:23:05] brother she never had to go to self-help
[1:23:07] seminars
[1:23:08] she met him
[1:23:11] in when she had to come to a a steady
[1:23:14] and you know we're gonna teach you how
[1:23:16] to be a more respectable woman brother
[1:23:18] she met him who made the woman
[1:23:23] you with me she met him and he changed
[1:23:27] her oh my he was already demonstrating
[1:23:31] the power of God was already on earth it
[1:23:34] was moving
[1:23:36] there were those who tried to hide in
[1:23:38] trees by the name of Zacchaeus are you
[1:23:41] with me there were many others you know
[1:23:44] who were witness and there even gyruss
[1:23:46] himself the Bible says a generous here
[1:23:49] he was as a secret believer but a
[1:23:51] situation in his household it forced him
[1:23:54] to come out and seek out the Lord Jesus
[1:23:57] because he knew although here he was he
[1:24:00] knew all the scriptures regarding
[1:24:02] healing I hope somebody's hearing me he
[1:24:04] knew all the promise regarding healing
[1:24:06] but brother he wasn't enough to raise up
[1:24:08] his daughter from the dead that he knew
[1:24:11] all the promises and could recite
[1:24:13] everything regarding healing he needed
[1:24:16] to meet the healer
[1:24:18] you need the God who gave the word to
[1:24:21] come and confirm that word and quicken
[1:24:24] it and bring it to life
[1:24:26] his daughter was dead
[1:24:31] but here came the Lord Jesus
[1:24:34] brother he got in that house
[1:24:38] he said she's only sleeping
[1:24:41] and the rest of them left him to score
[1:24:46] What did he say get out
[1:24:50] get out ain't got nothing to prove to
[1:24:53] you get out I've come here because
[1:24:55] there's a need I'll tell you what Jesus
[1:24:58] will come where there's a need that a
[1:25:01] person says Lord I've got a need and
[1:25:03] only you can meet this need I'm not
[1:25:07] gonna try to hide behind things any
[1:25:09] longer I need you to meet this need in
[1:25:12] my life
[1:25:17] they change in genres this house
[1:25:21] after Jesus made a visit things were
[1:25:23] different
[1:25:26] things were different brother death was
[1:25:29] no longer lingering their
[1:25:31] funeral plans cancelled Oh
[1:25:36] life insurance company sorry to disturb
[1:25:39] you I did not mean that we need to fill
[1:25:41] that policy we have received another
[1:25:43] life policy
[1:25:46] whether they had come in contact with
[1:25:48] the Prince of life himself the Lord
[1:25:51] Jesus Christ
[1:25:57] you know Jesus has a he has a habit of
[1:26:00] going to funerals and raising people up
[1:26:06] you say brother Simon we're still
[1:26:08] bearing different ones I know that but
[1:26:11] there's also a promise in the word that
[1:26:13] they said they shall rise first
[1:26:17] event God proving within that but to
[1:26:20] think of it how many funeral plans that
[1:26:22] the devil's had with your life
[1:26:25] how many things were people wrote you
[1:26:28] off come on now I know about it I was
[1:26:31] wrote off
[1:26:33] if browning a week he'll be right back
[1:26:35] out here get browning this he was only
[1:26:38] brainwashed give him this giving this
[1:26:39] but you see my testimony remains the
[1:26:42] same this morning I did not need an idea
[1:26:44] I did not need a book but I met person
[1:26:48] of Jesus Christ that same pillar fire
[1:26:50] that are reading about in the book of
[1:26:53] Acts on the day of Pentecost part of
[1:26:56] that pillar fire he came down and laid
[1:26:58] claim on me
[1:27:00] you know that said boy you've got an
[1:27:03] inheritance
[1:27:10] hallelujah oh
[1:27:13] yeah you see I knew what it was like to
[1:27:16] know how to quote all the message y'all
[1:27:19] with me I've given this testimony many
[1:27:22] times I could quote the message when I
[1:27:24] wasn't even in my right mind
[1:27:27] I was raised in a message view you know
[1:27:31] with me I could quote it you nay you
[1:27:33] start out certain quotes I could tell
[1:27:35] you what message that came out of and I
[1:27:36] could finish the quote for you I could
[1:27:39] finish verses in the scripture but you
[1:27:41] know what it that was not the power that
[1:27:44] I needed
[1:27:45] knowledge is not power that's a lie
[1:27:49] there's only one power and Jesus said
[1:27:53] you shall receive power after the Holy
[1:27:55] Ghost is come upon you brother
[1:28:00] knowledge itself if it's all powerful
[1:28:03] why is it changed why's it altered but
[1:28:06] brother when the Holy Ghost has come
[1:28:08] I'll tell you introducers the same
[1:28:10] results today that it did back there on
[1:28:13] the day of Pentecost
[1:28:15] if the formula is kept the same
[1:28:22] too many quack druggist want to tamper
[1:28:24] with the formula
[1:28:26] wonder why it ain't working the way at
[1:28:29] all to work rather it ain't nothing
[1:28:31] wrong with the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[1:28:34] is still the same
[1:28:36] Paul never put a footnote in the
[1:28:39] scriptures and said this is only for a
[1:28:41] certain time but you know after the ages
[1:28:44] go on and the evil it continues to go
[1:28:46] forward then don't count on the Spirit
[1:28:48] of God quickening your mortal body the
[1:28:50] way that it raised up his body and the
[1:28:52] way it raised up our body that sounds
[1:28:54] like somebody trying to explain away and
[1:28:56] live in a life of defeat but brother the
[1:28:59] sway the Holy Ghost it raised him up
[1:29:01] from the grave it does the same thing
[1:29:03] today
[1:29:04] it's still the same power it produces
[1:29:08] the same results here today
[1:29:11] don't believe that
[1:29:13] well if you don't I do
[1:29:20] this was grounds that belong to the
[1:29:23] believer
[1:29:25] when they came out of there on the day
[1:29:28] of Pentecost
[1:29:29] they came out of there they were
[1:29:32] quickened
[1:29:33] they were made alive they went in there
[1:29:36] cowards
[1:29:38] they were afraid
[1:29:40] hello somebody but they came out of
[1:29:43] there and Peter remember Peter who is
[1:29:46] the spokesman
[1:29:47] he's the one when he was asked before
[1:29:51] hey you hang around with him hey I think
[1:29:54] you know him hey don't you believe what
[1:29:56] he teaches oh I don't know him
[1:30:00] and yet this is the same man that said
[1:30:04] I'll go and I'll die for you it shows
[1:30:07] self-will is no good
[1:30:11] his heart wasn't surrendered
[1:30:13] but rather when he came out of that
[1:30:16] upper room that was not anything his
[1:30:19] daddy could do his momma can do it want
[1:30:21] anything Peter could do the only thing
[1:30:23] they can do is present themselves as the
[1:30:26] word was calling them to present
[1:30:28] themselves and that's all you and I can
[1:30:31] do is a percent ourselves as God would
[1:30:34] lead us and it requires God to come on
[1:30:37] the scene and for him to perform the
[1:30:39] word rather the rapture in the glowing
[1:30:42] of the church it's not our efforts and
[1:30:44] I'm gonna make the rapture happen and
[1:30:46] I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna make it
[1:30:48] do this be careful your heads gonna bust
[1:30:51] you're not gonna do nothing but yet God
[1:30:55] is calling you and you submit yourself
[1:30:58] to the word and that same God that's
[1:31:00] changing you where the Spirit of the
[1:31:02] Lord is changing you from glory unto
[1:31:05] glory unto glory
[1:31:10] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:31:16] because we believe that
[1:31:23] it quickened their language
[1:31:26] is that right
[1:31:28] the things that they were talking about
[1:31:30] it quickened it
[1:31:36] I think of one brother we had to it was
[1:31:38] that the men's retreat you just say the
[1:31:40] testimonies that comes to me my brother
[1:31:42] down a down in beach not South Carolina
[1:31:45] we were at the men's retreats a few
[1:31:48] years ago and they said they
[1:31:50] said yeah brother brother Mike used to
[1:31:54] like to ride Harley's
[1:31:56] he said Ben I don't know I don't know he
[1:31:59] just he don't like riding harleys no
[1:32:01] more he likes riding you know
[1:32:04] motorcycles and they said brother Mike
[1:32:06] said the truth of the matter was he said
[1:32:08] he's not that he said that I just I got
[1:32:10] rid of Harley's or I stopped he said I
[1:32:12] just got so tied up with the Lord that
[1:32:15] that took precedence over the
[1:32:18] motorcycles
[1:32:21] you see it ain't something that you have
[1:32:24] to give up I hope you hear me this
[1:32:27] morning well I gotta give this something
[1:32:29] I gotta get you don't got to get nothing
[1:32:31] up let him take let him do what he alone
[1:32:36] can do
[1:32:40] it's like a person said you know one
[1:32:44] time you know that a person come through
[1:32:45] you know the where I was teaching and
[1:32:48] man they were announcing you know that
[1:32:49] older lady and she said hey Sam she said
[1:32:52] happy hour has that sense such a time
[1:32:55] first of all that shot me to death I
[1:32:56] didn't know teachers drink
[1:32:59] shot me to death you know she came
[1:33:01] through she said Sam she said happy
[1:33:03] hours are setting such a time I looked
[1:33:05] her she's about 73 74 years old I looked
[1:33:07] at her I said Betty I said I'm a
[1:33:09] Christian
[1:33:10] I don't drink I
[1:33:13] am - I said well that is all I know I
[1:33:17] can tell you is what he did for me I
[1:33:20] said everything that's alright he left
[1:33:22] it alone but what was it he took
[1:33:29] you with me
[1:33:31] it ain't what I had to do it's what he
[1:33:34] did
[1:33:40] we might be on this for months
[1:33:43] the quickening power he'd come down
[1:33:45] there I tell you it you know it behooves
[1:33:49] us friends listen the life is what is
[1:33:52] important
[1:33:55] people can no doctrine still they know
[1:33:58] doctors do they know doctors and they
[1:34:00] don't know Jesus
[1:34:02] what good does all the doctrines do if
[1:34:05] you don't know him
[1:34:07] the doctrines only create fences come on
[1:34:12] somebody because the doctrine itself is
[1:34:15] the bark on the tree and the bark is to
[1:34:17] protect the life you don't want to
[1:34:19] become insulated with doctrine against
[1:34:22] the light
[1:34:23] you want to received alive and the live
[1:34:27] will bring the bark in the right place
[1:34:32] glory oh my they received you see they
[1:34:37] had a title deed Jesus gave them a title
[1:34:39] deed I mean you never bought a house
[1:34:42] on about five of you
[1:34:49] I know it's more than that
[1:34:51] some of you woke up on that
[1:34:56] but they go through the whole process
[1:34:57] and you got to have that deed searched
[1:35:02] you've got to have it searched when you
[1:35:04] buy that land that claim of land you've
[1:35:07] got to have that land searched they have
[1:35:10] what they call the land title company is
[1:35:13] that right I know it's another line on
[1:35:15] the mortgage paperwork more money but
[1:35:17] yet they go through there and they
[1:35:19] search everything out so see are there
[1:35:22] any liens on the deed
[1:35:25] and if there's any liens on the deed
[1:35:29] there is no transfer of property until
[1:35:34] the liens are taken care of
[1:35:40] those you know you've brought existing
[1:35:42] property you buy a house you know what
[1:35:44] please don't let you be no existing
[1:35:45] liens because then you know you got to
[1:35:48] go to the owner or do whoever and try to
[1:35:49] you know finagling everything else hey
[1:35:51] will you pay the $500 water bill you got
[1:35:53] on this house you know I'm saying or
[1:35:56] this $5,000 back taxes will you
[1:36:00] brother there was a lease that was on
[1:36:03] this deed
[1:36:06] liens that were on the deed where even
[1:36:09] those who died and had rent there with
[1:36:14] the promises in mind and here they were
[1:36:17] they were in paradise
[1:36:18] but brother they win fair rent by
[1:36:21] revelation as they would offer at the
[1:36:23] lam and when that deed was cleared
[1:36:29] paradise was done away with
[1:36:32] when the deed was cleared you see his
[1:36:34] blood was shed on Calvary he went to the
[1:36:37] lowest parts of hell he dropped and
[1:36:41] deposited sin he put it back on the one
[1:36:44] who brought it in the beginning
[1:36:46] he ascended up he led captivity captive
[1:36:49] come on now he led captivity captive
[1:36:52] what was it it was a parade of triumph
[1:36:56] the mighty Conqueror had went there in
[1:36:59] the midst of Hale and Hale could not
[1:37:02] hold him there there weren't enough
[1:37:03] demons to keep him there
[1:37:06] amen the price had been paid he was the
[1:37:10] Madi Conqueror the Living God was there
[1:37:13] and he ascended back up he led captivity
[1:37:16] captive and then he began to announce to
[1:37:21] the disciples who were there
[1:37:27] he began to announce to them the deed
[1:37:30] that belonged to them
[1:37:33] the Bible says in John 1:12 as many as
[1:37:37] received him to them gave he the power
[1:37:41] to become the sons of God that word
[1:37:45] power is the right to become
[1:37:48] are you with me it was not that's not
[1:37:52] the same word as acts 1:8 he had he had
[1:37:54] to give them the right you see you got
[1:37:56] to know what your rights are
[1:37:58] come on now we're living in an age right
[1:38:01] now people's rights
[1:38:03] but their rights they want to put them
[1:38:05] right down your throat
[1:38:07] they want you to accept their immorality
[1:38:11] Varon calling us their sin they want you
[1:38:14] to call their sin good
[1:38:19] they're right we're living in that age
[1:38:22] of people's rights now listen if that's
[1:38:25] the spirit there that's on the AIDS look
[1:38:28] at the contrast of that it is an hour
[1:38:31] where remember the Bible says in Romans
[1:38:34] 8 that the earth is groaning and
[1:38:36] travailing it is longing for the
[1:38:38] manifestation of the sons of God brother
[1:38:41] what has been seven Sabbath's down
[1:38:44] through the church ages it was the
[1:38:46] promise in this hour that God would
[1:38:49] restore us back to as it was on the day
[1:38:52] of Pentecost where he himself was given
[1:38:54] a pure undefiled bride a bride that was
[1:38:58] fully matured where Christ Himself
[1:39:01] veiled himself in her I
[1:39:03] say what power is in this life
[1:39:07] you with me it went in to the grave and
[1:39:11] the dark ages but the grave couldn't
[1:39:13] hold it
[1:39:14] it came up here in the hour that we're
[1:39:18] living in and now the Holy Ghost
[1:39:20] returning now in full power full
[1:39:23] maturity over the Church of the Living
[1:39:26] God why it's time to go back home it's
[1:39:30] time for rapture it's time to be changed
[1:39:35] the ministers are right
[1:39:43] all right a title deed but within that
[1:39:47] title deed it's got to be cleared
[1:39:52] believing get you the title deed
[1:39:56] believing is not the abstract hello
[1:40:00] somebody
[1:40:01] Paul said it and that's 19 have you
[1:40:05] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:40:07] believed that in Ephesians 1:14 you were
[1:40:11] sealed after that you heard the gospel
[1:40:15] of your salvation
[1:40:16] after that you believed you see you
[1:40:19] first have to have a trumpet that would
[1:40:23] sounds to you and I and lets us know
[1:40:25] what belongs to us
[1:40:28] I
[1:40:30] remember hearing my wife and I you know
[1:40:32] the first time
[1:40:34] after I'd stepped away from teaching
[1:40:38] you know I was used to that I guess I
[1:40:40] didn't know I had a Cadillac insurance
[1:40:41] plan when I talked yes I did and
[1:40:45] we're in the hospital I thought Lord
[1:40:47] here's the first hospital here's the
[1:40:50] first thing
[1:40:51] of course I have a there's a share
[1:40:53] ministry we use it it's the Lord I'm
[1:40:56] looking at it sometimes you don't
[1:40:58] realize why you're in places that you're
[1:41:00] in sometimes we look at the situations
[1:41:03] we're in and we just look at the
[1:41:04] situation instead of looking at saying
[1:41:06] the Lord is there something you want to
[1:41:08] give to me while I'm right here
[1:41:10] and Here Come a little here come a lady
[1:41:13] she was filling out you know she's
[1:41:14] asking us all these questions and things
[1:41:16] and stuff I've never had to do before
[1:41:17] and you know filling out all this
[1:41:19] paperwork and everything and and then as
[1:41:21] we're talking about it and you know she
[1:41:23] let me know the prices on the drugs and
[1:41:25] what's coming up and finally she says um
[1:41:28] so here's a little card she said do you
[1:41:31] know about this I said no what is that
[1:41:33] she said this card she said if you take
[1:41:36] this she said now you got to present it
[1:41:38] every time she said but it will give you
[1:41:40] a discount on your prescriptions
[1:41:42] something like 70% off or something like
[1:41:45] that I don't remember exactly what it is
[1:41:46] but then you know I wouldn't even wear
[1:41:48] something existed like that I
[1:41:50] had already paid amounts on certain
[1:41:53] prescriptions already but you know what
[1:41:55] somebody made me aware of what I had I
[1:42:00] didn't even realize I I could have that
[1:42:03] but rather now that I know what I had
[1:42:07] when I left that hospital and I went to
[1:42:09] fill them prescriptions I took that card
[1:42:13] and I showed them that card because you
[1:42:16] know what somebody presented something
[1:42:18] to me and they said you can have this
[1:42:20] this is rights I took that and presented
[1:42:23] that and you know what I've been
[1:42:25] benefited from it ever since
[1:42:27] somebody's got to tell you what is for
[1:42:30] you
[1:42:32] and if you know what what kind of a
[1:42:35] person would that have been if they
[1:42:36] would always held that from me
[1:42:40] what would that have been that would
[1:42:42] have been nobody that wanted to help me

[1:42:51] I want to get on to that but brother and
[1:42:53] sister that's why I'm telling you that
[1:42:55] the ministering of the gospel and when
[1:42:57] God puts that spirit of the Holy Ghost
[1:42:59] within your life it is no longer you
[1:43:02] about you but your heart it beats for
[1:43:05] the kingdom of God it desires to see
[1:43:08] others that they will know that same
[1:43:10] Liberty that you have come to know and
[1:43:14] you might have to take a little bit of
[1:43:16] time
[1:43:18] you may not be able to get into
[1:43:20] scriptures with them

[1:43:26] a living witness right there
[1:43:30] hey man come on down and be God in flesh
[1:43:34] to them
[1:43:39] I'm gonna tell a little something here I
[1:43:42] hope it's all right
[1:43:44] about a year before brother Aaron his
[1:43:46] sister Amanda before they had ever come
[1:43:48] to the Lord before they come over here
[1:43:49] they come over to our house when they
[1:43:53] came over to our house you know they
[1:43:54] left after they left her house my wife
[1:43:57] won't mind this if she does she could
[1:43:59] skimmin we get home
[1:44:01] but my wife said honey she said
[1:44:06] you and shouldn't we have you
[1:44:08] know you know been talking you know man
[1:44:11] and bringing some more things up about
[1:44:13] you know with the Lord and things like I
[1:44:14] think that's a right way she'll correct
[1:44:16] me when I get home any huh I'm just
[1:44:18] she's real good to me she's easy homey
[1:44:21] but
[1:44:22] you know I told her I said but honey I
[1:44:24] did I said everything you can you can
[1:44:27] you can ask brother brother Aaron and
[1:44:28] sister man when the things that I would
[1:44:30] talk with in the conversation I would
[1:44:31] say the Lord said the Lord did this the
[1:44:34] Lord did that brother he wants something
[1:44:37] I had to reach back into scriptures back
[1:44:38] here and going back to there and go
[1:44:41] through some teaching but let it be a
[1:44:42] present tense God let it be the presence
[1:44:45] of the Living God is the Lord leading me
[1:44:48] the Lord said this the Lord directed
[1:44:50] this brother people are hungry for
[1:44:52] reality
[1:44:55] amen let them experience the reality
[1:44:57] then you can get it to the Bible studies
[1:45:00] you with me let them experience the
[1:45:03] reality
[1:45:06] is that right
[1:45:08] glory be to God so I that's why I'm
[1:45:10] brother Bram said you don't ever go up
[1:45:11] to somebody he said here's a man on a
[1:45:14] roof he said it he's using a
[1:45:17] hammer and he said that man's using that
[1:45:20] Henry said and you've got an automatic
[1:45:21] nailer he said you don't run up to the
[1:45:23] man and say you don't got nothing you
[1:45:25] don't got what I got
[1:45:28] no what you got nobody wants
[1:45:32] I'll take a smash thumb over top of that
[1:45:35] not over what you're offering
[1:45:38] come on now but you see it's the present
[1:45:42] to them and say man
[1:45:45] you could you do a really nice job with
[1:45:46] him nails you're a real good job come on
[1:45:50] I'm not gonna read the quote word by
[1:45:51] word I don't have it in front of me just
[1:45:53] pulling into my heart right now but you
[1:45:55] see begin to say mind that's you know
[1:45:57] that's wonderful in it but then you say
[1:46:00] have you considered this and
[1:46:02] begin to show them and that's why your
[1:46:05] brother Ben told us he said ain't nothin
[1:46:07] wrong with the Holy Ghost we've got
[1:46:08] sometimes he said it's the way we
[1:46:11] presented it
[1:46:13] ain't nothin wrong with it it's the way
[1:46:15] sometimes that it's been presented
[1:46:18] him and you see what they've had listen
[1:46:21] friends what somebody has don't take
[1:46:23] from them only add to it
[1:46:25] come on now what Luther had was not all
[1:46:29] of it there was a lot of wrong there was
[1:46:31] a lot of wrong ideas that was in there
[1:46:33] but yet there was truth that was there
[1:46:36] when God sent further life he did not
[1:46:39] take from he added to
[1:46:43] glory be to God in the highest
[1:46:47] my
[1:46:49] mama
[1:46:53] so this promise of the Holy Ghost it
[1:46:57] this is our inheritance it brings us to
[1:47:01] this place to the promise that we would
[1:47:04] have in him back to the grounds of the
[1:47:07] belief what belongs to us that of that
[1:47:09] of eternal life now I want you to think
[1:47:13] of this
[1:47:14] go with me to John chapter 8 for a
[1:47:18] moment
[1:47:24] John chapter 8
[1:47:43] John chapter 8 now notice here Jesus
[1:47:48] the Bible says in verse 30 as he spake
[1:47:51] these words many believed on him
[1:47:54] then jesus said to those Jews which
[1:47:57] believed on him if you continue in my
[1:48:00] word then are ye my disciples indeed
[1:48:05] and you shall know the truth and the
[1:48:08] truth shall make you free
[1:48:11] you know and he's letting them know
[1:48:13] you're in bondage
[1:48:16] now these were religious come on now
[1:48:20] righteous men you couldn't put a finger
[1:48:24] on their lives ooh
[1:48:29] and Jesus let him know you need to be
[1:48:33] free
[1:48:36] then they answered him we be Abraham's
[1:48:40] seed
[1:48:41] and we're never in bondage to any man
[1:48:44] how say us now you shall be made free
[1:48:48] Jesus said verily verily I say unto you
[1:48:50] whosoever committeth sin is the servant
[1:48:53] of sin and the servant abideth not in
[1:48:56] the house forever but the son abideth
[1:48:59] forever if the son therefore shall make
[1:49:03] you free ye shall be free indeed I know
[1:49:09] that you are Abraham's seed but ye seek
[1:49:12] to kill me because my word hath
[1:49:16] no place in you
[1:49:20] Jesus let him know I know you're
[1:49:22] Abraham's seed now remember what Jesus
[1:49:26] is announcing to them if the son
[1:49:30] therefore shall make you free you shall
[1:49:33] be free indeed
[1:49:34] he's announcing to them the jubilee that
[1:49:38] is coming
[1:49:40] that there is a Liberty that is coming
[1:49:43] to you there is a Liberty that is going
[1:49:46] to come forth but yet they themselves
[1:49:48] said we don't need to be free we're
[1:49:51] already free
[1:49:54] they were in bondage
[1:49:56] they did not realize that they
[1:49:59] themselves that in jolt to the coming of
[1:50:02] the Holy Ghost that was for them they
[1:50:07] needed to be set free but here's the
[1:50:10] stance that they took on it they took on
[1:50:12] it that their natural birth as though
[1:50:14] everything of who they were and what
[1:50:17] they had done that somehow that that
[1:50:19] qualified them that they were free but
[1:50:22] they were not free they were still born
[1:50:25] in sin and they needed to be born again
[1:50:30] they needed to be born again I don't
[1:50:32] care how much message they knew I don't
[1:50:36] care how much of the Scriptures they
[1:50:38] know
[1:50:39] come on somebody I don't care how many
[1:50:42] experiences they had they needed to be
[1:50:46] born again
[1:50:49] amen they needed a new life to come on
[1:50:52] the inside and Jesus told them there
[1:50:55] they did what was right they believed on
[1:50:58] him but brother just believing on him
[1:51:00] did not bring them into Liberty it was
[1:51:03] the pathway they had to keep walking
[1:51:06] that pathway
[1:51:11] you see here you find
[1:51:15] there's a difference Jesus here is he's
[1:51:19] speaking the sons of Abraham are you
[1:51:21] with me
[1:51:23] these are guys that could say I'm
[1:51:25] circumcised
[1:51:26] Abraham is my father
[1:51:30] there go through everything
[1:51:33] sons of Abraham in the natural but yet
[1:51:39] when the word was standing before them
[1:51:43] the very one that was standing before
[1:51:45] them that visited their father Abraham
[1:51:48] right here in this same chapter Jesus
[1:51:50] let him know he said Abraham saw me in
[1:51:54] his day
[1:51:55] is that right he saw him that visitation
[1:51:58] where he came there in Genesis 18 and
[1:52:01] God took upon a flesh body are you with
[1:52:04] me now he saw that visitation and look
[1:52:07] how Abraham
[1:52:08] responded there when the Lord visited
[1:52:10] look I responded in every chapter when
[1:52:13] the Lord was visiting him in lights and
[1:52:15] dreams and on and on and every time
[1:52:18] watch how Abraham would surrender and
[1:52:21] give of himself and Jesus let her know
[1:52:23] you are not responding to me the way
[1:52:27] that Abraham did
[1:52:29] they could say Abraham our Father my
[1:52:32] father's father my father's father's
[1:52:33] father's father he taught us this we
[1:52:36] know the word and Jesus said search the
[1:52:39] Scriptures for in them you think you
[1:52:43] have eternal life and they aren't they
[1:52:45] that testified me brother he took what
[1:52:48] was a promise and made it a present-day
[1:52:51] fulfillment the devil don't care how
[1:52:55] many times that something is kept in the
[1:52:57] past or how many times a promise is put
[1:53:00] in the future what stirs the house of
[1:53:02] hell is when the promises become present
[1:53:06] tense in the heart of the believer
[1:53:08] brother that's what upsets hell
[1:53:14] and that's to when the Holy Ghost came
[1:53:20] the devil hit his snooze button on his
[1:53:23] alarm
[1:53:25] I'm not gonna read the quote but I
[1:53:27] paraphrase it he didn't even get out of
[1:53:29] bed
[1:53:32] they had been filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:53:36] but when they walked by the gate called
[1:53:38] beautiful and the life that was now
[1:53:43] inside of them
[1:53:46] the same one that had healed the sick
[1:53:49] before the same one that had raised the
[1:53:52] dead the same one that had casts out the
[1:53:54] Devils that same God now that the
[1:53:57] sacrifice had been received and accepted
[1:54:00] all glory now that the sacrifice has
[1:54:03] been accepted there was a sounding that
[1:54:06] went out and let him know this sacrifice
[1:54:09] has been accepted
[1:54:12] they looked on that man at the gate
[1:54:15] called beautiful silver and gold such as
[1:54:17] I have I don't have any but rise up take
[1:54:22] up thy bed and walk
[1:54:23] brother branham tells us he said that's
[1:54:26] when the devil got mad
[1:54:29] why because the life was being expressed
[1:54:33] through the believer that life was being
[1:54:37] his friend Emma just say like this the
[1:54:39] devil don't care how much Holy Ghost you
[1:54:41] got if you don't surrender if you don't
[1:54:45] let him be preeminent in your life if
[1:54:47] you don't look at in your life and say
[1:54:49] Lord take anything out of the way that's
[1:54:51] hindering Lord is there anything that's
[1:54:54] hindering the expression of the Holy
[1:54:56] Spirit through my life
[1:54:59] hallelujah you weren't born to torment
[1:55:02] hell
[1:55:05] hallelu
[1:55:07] glory be to God
[1:55:12] hallelujah
[1:55:14] the Bible said he's the surf and brucer
[1:55:17] and if we are bone of his bone flesh of
[1:55:20] his flesh life of his life then as he
[1:55:23] was a serpent bruzer so is the bride to
[1:55:26] be a serpent bruzer
[1:55:30] truly be the god I'm telling you your
[1:55:33] code to put your foot on demons
[1:55:37] your cloud to put your foot on
[1:55:40] uncleanness and ungodliness
[1:55:43] rather you're called to delete all them
[1:55:45] socks and put your foot down
[1:55:47] come on somebody you're called to live a
[1:55:51] godly life
[1:55:52] that's a right that's arrived you say
[1:55:56] Lord this is my right I surrendered
[1:55:59] [Applause]
[1:56:04] when that sounding went forth
[1:56:07] I'm trying to close here
[1:56:10] when that sounding went forth of that
[1:56:12] trumpet you
[1:56:14] know what the trumpet was for
[1:56:18] it was to declare by the sounding the
[1:56:22] blood has been accepted
[1:56:27] others that were in this place not
[1:56:30] everybody was right there the priest had
[1:56:32] to ride throughout the land and blow the
[1:56:36] trumpet
[1:56:38] that's why Jesus could say go you
[1:56:40] therefore
[1:56:42] preaching the gospel right how shall
[1:56:46] they hear
[1:56:49] unless there be a preacher
[1:56:53] let me tell you something you may not
[1:56:55] have the gift in your life to be a
[1:56:58] preacher
[1:56:59] but if you have the gift of the Holy
[1:57:01] Ghost you can let him preach right
[1:57:04] through your life
[1:57:06] it declares the victory of Calvary
[1:57:09] brother it's a witness you're able to
[1:57:12] reach places that hear that ministers
[1:57:15] were high myself could never go but you
[1:57:17] see God wants your life as a witness God
[1:57:20] wants your life as a testimony you write
[1:57:24] you with me hey Li Chen Li Chen wanted
[1:57:26] to get on the boat with Jesus Jesus said
[1:57:29] no no
[1:57:31] Legionnaire I don't know what he called
[1:57:32] our Lord what his name was and we get to
[1:57:34] the side we'll know
[1:57:37] but you but you you understand just for
[1:57:40] sake of time here he told him he said go
[1:57:43] on back to your friends and go on back
[1:57:46] to your family go on back to your
[1:57:48] neighbors
[1:57:57] okay
[1:57:58] brother David Horner comes to my mind
[1:58:01] right now
[1:58:04] he said he'd tell me in the testing when
[1:58:07] he's outside dear Lord my neighborhood
[1:58:09] got quieter
[1:58:13] and he said every behind my neighborhood
[1:58:14] boy that everybody got little nicer and
[1:58:16] a little quieter
[1:58:20] brother Jerry now stream now I want
[1:58:22] everybody else if you got changed
[1:58:29] you heard you were the instrument in the
[1:58:32] calls of all that disturbance and
[1:58:34] everything else but you see what the
[1:58:36] power of it is when God takes a hold of
[1:58:38] a live brother that's a paradox
[1:58:47] that sounding of that event that trumpet
[1:58:50] would go forth it would sound throughout
[1:58:52] there of all the land and God has
[1:58:55] equipped
[1:58:57] to be a witness
[1:59:01] mama you may not you may not feel like
[1:59:03] well I'm not getting out here as much
[1:59:05] like that but God's equipped you to
[1:59:08] sound that out in your home
[1:59:11] he's equipped you to sound that out as a
[1:59:13] testimony
[1:59:15] that the atonement has been accepted and
[1:59:19] the life of the atonement has come is
[1:59:23] their right to keep them to keep our
[1:59:27] children under the atmosphere of the
[1:59:29] Holy Ghost as the Prophet said you be
[1:59:32] the Holy Ghost until the Holy Ghost
[1:59:33] comes right to keep them under that of
[1:59:38] the atonement
[1:59:41] we're just gonna stop because there's
[1:59:43] just so much I don't even
[1:59:47] but I hope you I hope how I hope he made
[1:59:49] sense of it today for you
[1:59:51] the tribulus sounded when that sound
[1:59:54] goes forth
[1:59:58] that man
[2:00:00] when that sounds the man who has
[2:00:04] whatever instrument in his hand
[2:00:07] maybe he's holding in the field this is
[2:00:09] what his master has told him
[2:00:13] he went to bed that night he got up the
[2:00:16] next morning
[2:00:19] still back on the same
[2:00:22] here come
[2:00:24] sound of the Jubilee
[2:00:27] brother when that sound come he didn't
[2:00:29] have to ask the master do you think I
[2:00:32] could lay this down there was a greater
[2:00:35] authority than his master his master had
[2:00:40] to recognize the authority
[2:00:43] of that
[2:00:45] sounding brother what was his master was
[2:00:49] no longer his master that trumpet
[2:00:53] sounded he could throw down that garden
[2:00:56] hoe whatever it was he could let it go
[2:00:59] he could walk out of that we could walk
[2:01:01] right out of that field he didn't have
[2:01:03] to ask that master do you think I can go
[2:01:05] a little bit do you think I can do this
[2:01:06] he didn't have to ask nobody's
[2:01:08] permission he had received authority to
[2:01:13] come back to his inheritance and
[2:01:17] that's what the Holy Ghost does it
[2:01:20] sounds out to a man's heart it sounds
[2:01:23] out to a woman's heart and lets them
[2:01:25] know there's something you're missing
[2:01:27] there's something you're missing in life
[2:01:29] there is a greater life
[2:01:34] I'll tell you here this morning if
[2:01:36] you've still got a devil's instrument in
[2:01:38] your hand you've got authority to throw
[2:01:40] that thing down
[2:01:42] you with me oh brother Samuel ha I can't
[2:01:45] get out of here to go do this and go do
[2:01:47] that you don't need to get out of here
[2:01:48] to go do this and go do that he can take
[2:01:51] care of it right here
[2:01:54] he can take care of it right here but
[2:01:57] where your faith has to be is that he
[2:02:00] has already
[2:02:02] finished the work
[2:02:06] brother saying I'm not worthy it's not
[2:02:09] about your worthiness it's about his
[2:02:11] worthiness you
[2:02:15] understand I'm not talking about traps
[2:02:17] brother and sister I'm talking about
[2:02:19] where there's things are still bondage
[2:02:22] they ought to be there ought to be
[2:02:24] enough well we'll get into the end of
[2:02:25] you there ought to be some discernment
[2:02:27] within that right there you see bondage
[2:02:29] is where you're still held captive
[2:02:32] and you're not free from it but there is
[2:02:35] one to liberate you from it and when
[2:02:38] you're held captive it's not a trap but
[2:02:40] he who is said to liberate you he's able
[2:02:43] to loosen that hold on your life
[2:02:46] don't let the devil tell you well I got
[2:02:48] a pack this instrument around with me
[2:02:50] the rest of my life he's a liar I said
[2:02:53] he's a liar
[2:02:55] well I received this from this and I
[2:02:57] received this from this and I received
[2:02:59] this from this we need to look back to
[2:03:01] the atonement the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:03:04] there is no weakness in the atonement
[2:03:08] but in their strength there's power
[2:03:10] there's glory there's honor
[2:03:15] you with me
[2:03:24] I think of our
[2:03:27] when you look in in your life sometimes
[2:03:29] you look at things and think well I've
[2:03:31] been a failures this or I've been this
[2:03:33] or I've been that let that be a has-been
[2:03:36] let it be a has-been
[2:03:39] walk in that Liberty that he he gives
[2:03:44] if you started walking for God and the
[2:03:48] Lord's draw in your life and you got off
[2:03:49] the pathway somewhere you got off the
[2:03:51] pathway it's time to get back on it it's
[2:03:54] time to say Lord I want to come back I
[2:03:57] want to come home I don't want to just I
[2:03:59] don't want to just come to church you
[2:04:00] know many times people come to church
[2:04:02] and that's all they do
[2:04:05] see I thought she was gonna stop
[2:04:06] preaching I was but the preacher wants
[2:04:08] to preach
[2:04:10] some people just want to come to church
[2:04:12] you know why that's a satisfying of a
[2:04:16] religious duty
[2:04:18] serving God is not religion it's
[2:04:22] serving the Living God
[2:04:24] it's not just coming to a church once a
[2:04:28] week or twice a week or whenever you
[2:04:30] feel like coming to church it's about
[2:04:32] serving part and delighting yourself in
[2:04:35] the things of God
[2:04:37] just to come here on Sunday and pray for
[2:04:40] me brother Samuel but I'll make it on
[2:04:43] Sunday how about asking God say lord
[2:04:45] give me such a strength Lord in my life
[2:04:49] Lord God give me such an anchor in my
[2:04:52] life give me such a joy give me such a
[2:04:55] stability
[2:04:58] hallelujah
[2:04:59] you're asking for big things because
[2:05:02] he's a big God
[2:05:04] I'm not preaching my textbook I preach
[2:05:07] in my experience I know him to be Viv's
[2:05:11] I've been to ask him at times restore to
[2:05:14] me the joy of thy salvation
[2:05:16] not just once or twice I've had to ask
[2:05:19] him many times
[2:05:22] lord give me strength Lord love God
[2:05:26] encourage me Lord
[2:05:30] God wants your life to be full of his
[2:05:34] joy
[2:05:36] Jesus said I prayed that your joy might
[2:05:39] befall
[2:05:40] he said ask that your joy might be for
[2:05:43] brother if he already prayed for it
[2:05:46] if he's already asked for the joy to be
[2:05:50] fooling us I think we ought to ask what
[2:05:52] he decides for us to have
[2:05:55] no I want the fullness of joy in my life
[2:06:01] David said I will serve thee because I
[2:06:03] love thee thou has given life to me thy
[2:06:07] loving-kindness is better than life
[2:06:11] there's a trumpet that sounds there's a
[2:06:14] real reality that sounds now let me tell
[2:06:17] you what this reality does when it rings
[2:06:19] down into your soul it's not something
[2:06:21] that you can ever get away from it
[2:06:24] changes you it takes the fear of ever
[2:06:27] falling out of your life are you with me
[2:06:30] why because there's a change that moves
[2:06:33] down on the inside the devil might try
[2:06:35] to bluff you and tell you oh it's just
[2:06:37] this you're just worked up and you're
[2:06:39] just that but you know by that voice
[2:06:41] that's coming in you know that there's a
[2:06:44] life that stands in resistance against
[2:06:46] that you know that there's something in
[2:06:48] you that resists that very thing it says
[2:06:51] that is not the truth the life has found
[2:06:59] what do you think I ought to do
[2:07:02] well I think you ought to go into your
[2:07:04] contacts list and take the devil out of
[2:07:07] your favorites

[2:21:03] Lord this is our land
[2:21:06] this is our land of promise
[2:21:09] God I pray if there's one here this
[2:21:12] morning that does not

[2:21:41] and say Lord Jesus

[2:21:47] strength Lord

[2:22:09] granite Lord I pray
[2:22:11] Lord if there's any Lord God that and
[2:22:14] falling in a trap Lord
[2:22:19] something Lord that has ensnared them in
[2:22:22] their life I

[2:22:27] your God has a brother - a brother a
[2:22:32] brother Lord - my sister
[2:22:36] Godfather hold them up Lord before your
[2:22:39] throne in prayer this morning Lord
[2:22:42] your God I pray that
[2:22:47] you would loose
[2:22:50] [Music]
[2:22:51] that hole that trap Lord God that
[2:22:55] ensnare Lord let him see Lord God the
[2:22:59] power resting Lord in their bosom Lord
[2:23:02] taught to be able to lay aside every
[2:23:04] weight and every sin that does so easily
[2:23:06] beset of Lord
[2:23:08] let it recognize every trick of the
[2:23:12] death and
[2:23:13] recognize that greater is he that is in
[2:23:16] them been he that's in the world
[2:23:19] father may they not Lord
[2:23:23] entertain Satan's Bluff
[2:23:26] may they rise oh god I pray
[2:23:32] Lord in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:23:36] for the glory of God we ask you Lord
[2:23:39] Jesus
[2:23:40] precious name Amen
[2:23:45] what I want to live fully in my
[2:23:47] inheritance
[2:23:49] don't you I
[2:23:51] want to live fully
[2:23:53] occupied fully
[2:23:56] if you see you feel like you've given
[2:23:58] any ground it's time to retake it
[2:24:01] it's time to retake that ground
[2:24:04] amen it's time to rise and say Lord I
[2:24:09] want to reclaim that ground that belongs
[2:24:13] to me
[2:24:16] sometimes you know you go through things
[2:24:18] and you you have what you call a bad
[2:24:20] week
[2:24:22] so what do I do brother Samuel start
[2:24:26] right now reclaim
[2:24:28] you reclaim
[2:24:32] amen the Word of God is true are you
[2:24:36] with me this morning the Word of God is
[2:24:38] true
[2:24:40] traps can be around but the Bible says
[2:24:44] if we confess our sin he's faithful and
[2:24:46] just to forgive us and to cleanse us
[2:24:49] from all unrighteousness are you with me
[2:24:51] we can have faith in knowing that he
[2:24:55] already did that I
[2:25:01] don't mean to hold you but I just feel
[2:25:03] pressed to say that when he was in the
[2:25:06] Garden of Gethsemane brother and sister
[2:25:08] he made the all-sufficient surrender and
[2:25:12] he went to Calvary and he paid for the
[2:25:15] past sins
[2:25:17] present sins and future sins
[2:25:22] he paid for it all
[2:25:26] you can rise within that
[2:25:30] sometimes you may not be holding a hoe
[2:25:34] as it was but there might be
[2:25:36] condemnation that wants to circle over
[2:25:38] your head
[2:25:41] you've got authority
[2:25:44] by the atonement of the Lord Jesus
[2:25:47] Christ to walk free
[2:25:51] you with me
[2:25:59] if we're stand on his word if we have
[2:26:01] followed all that he has asked us to do
[2:26:03] and we're standing on that word then God
[2:26:07] is there to back that word up he's there
[2:26:10] to make it alive within our lives you
[2:26:13] understand what I'm saying you can't get
[2:26:15] anywhere with living in the past
[2:26:18] you can't get nowhere
[2:26:24] you've got to look we're today
[2:26:27] today
[2:26:29] in the past let it be in the past
[2:26:34] amen let it be in the past
