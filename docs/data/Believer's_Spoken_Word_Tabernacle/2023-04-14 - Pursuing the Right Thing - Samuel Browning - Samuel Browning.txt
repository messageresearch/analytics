so appreciate the Lord tonight and just appreciate his mercy so good to see each one of you and uh we just want to turn our attention to the word of the Lord appreciate the musicians tonight and amen maybe if we could look in the scriptures to First Corinthians chapter 14 I'm just going to read one verse of scripture and then we'll let you have your seats tonight pray you know sometimes you read just one just a few words is all it takes to so much is packed within it and a lot of times I know that how the holy spirit will get a hold of it and it's something you just go to reading and then there's a little something that'll just drop and and I just pray tonight that he'll just he'll just unpack what's in here for our hearts I know what he's placed on my heart but I I don't want him to deliver it because if the thought is delivered it don't matter if all of the if everything is red or not it's the thought that gets across and I just I believe that with all my heart so let's just as we read the scriptures here tonight before we read it let's just invite him to come Heavenly Father Lord Jesus how we thank you tonight Lord that you would Lord Lord move Among Us and Lord withdraw us bring us to yourself Lord and father we're thankful here tonight we are not standing here Lord out of fear Lord or our minds o God of slavery but Lord It's A Love Affair Lord we are so thankful dear God for what you have done for us the reality that you have brought in our lives Lord and we just pray tonight that you'll just come Among Us in a special way you know every need that's gathered here Lord and we just want to give ourselves to you that you'll minister to every need Lord even those that are streaming Lord those that will archive it later we just ask that you would move Lord in a very special way father we just give ourselves to you now Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen First Corinthians 14 and verse 1. Paul writes follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy Paul would would write this after he's already come through the chapter of First Corinthians 13 and I believe it's a real admonition to us as the Saints of the Living God I know that when brother Brown tells us that we're to pray for Revelation but we recognize that you know as much as we can pray for him if the heart and the reason for it is not right it'll never come because God God doesn't just hear our prayers he hears our heart and so you know sometimes we can have the right motive and right objective but it's not according to God's will so our desire is I want my motives and objectives to match the will of God I want God's will to affect my motives and objectives I want his will to so influence my life to say Lord that's my full objective you're my full objective you're my full motive you're my full goal and I believe that's what Paul is bringing us here tonight is follow after charity so I'd like to speak tonight on that thought pursuing the right thing may God bless you as you're being seated we look at this word of follow and you know there's a lot of things in life that a person or persons or individuals could pursue after and uh bless you that was a hearty one I mean that was a that was a good one man brother Branham would have been proud of that one amen it was nothing like to break the ice sister didn't mean to embarrass you I know brother Richie's not embarrassed but man sometimes that happens that way in this time that we're living in I think the other day I was walking out from underneath and doing a little bit on our our cherry tree out there and I walked out and and I let out a big old sneeze and I looked over in the driveway and there was my neighbor I said don't worry you don't have to get no mask on you know she just started laughing you know but um you know it's something when we look at it I think if there's anything that we should really set our heart on in pursuing and that's the love of God because everything else itself I have many things and places that brother Branham will admonish us on here and I think we could we we could grasp this without without me even reading that quote and that is if we if we will love God or have the love of God and seeking after that and loving one another then brother Brahm says it just like this everything else will fall right into place because the love of God it cast out fear as as the people of God we were never made we were never made even as humans we were never made to worry we were never made to have fear that's why that when those types of things come in and it can have such an effect upon a person and upon a body but that all came in because of one letting down on the word of God it allowed an opening for all those things to enter in and you know that's why that when we look at it that the strength of of our lives really comes from the Lord and from the word of God and giving ourselves to him and so when we look here at at the word to follow after charity this word it means to to run after something not in a hostile way but to run after it or to follow after it's to pursue to seek after eagerly and earnestly Endeavor to acquire and I believe with all my heart that a consecrated walk with God it puts us in the position for the love of God to operate through our lives I I believe we're coming into I believe we're coming to a place and not just I don't want to just say coming but I believe the reality it strikes our hearts that you know in in in a life that we want to live close to God I I want to know him more I I can love him more he can't love me any more than what he's done but I want to love him more I want to know him in a greater way I I want I want more of his life taking over more of my life I see the effects of that I see the effects the importance the value of what it means to be in the house of God and not just to come and sit but to hear from God and to have an expectation in my heart and say Lord I need you to speak to me and I'm Desiring God to speak to you I see the value of what it is to to make time to read to pray to get in the message I see the value of it I see the effect of it and I see that within it to follow after to pursue after charity which is to pursue after God and I think what David said when thou has said uh run after me you know my heart sent after thee will I run or after thee will I seek o God and you know we looked last week at some moments when we think about the love of God and and I know that there are a lot of times that when we you know we might have things maybe in your life now or things you've come through or things that we will go through that will be termed like brother Branham did with the Hornets the bull the maniac when he termed it a crisis but let me just say this like this every day is not a crisis every moment of our life is a crisis if if every moment let me just let me try to encourage you and it might be a little bit of rebuke but I'm trying to encourage you in the right direction if every moment and every day of your life is a crisis you're missing something you're missing something and what it is you're missing is is you're pursuing after the wrong things if you pursue after everything else in life let me just tell you everything else in life there's nothing can bring you the satisfaction The Joy the subtleness the peace the discretion everything nothing besides the love of God everything else at the end of the day it'll leave you empty it'll leave you seeking for something else the next best thing to catch the next best thing to catch and the world has caught on it is set up to for that in order to ensnare people and are being blindly drawing into those things but we as the people of God are not to be ignorant of Satan's devices if there's one thing that we should have as a pursuit in our homes our marriage and here in in a church and in within our lives with God it's charity it ought to be the love of God that should be the number one goal in our lives because if we've got charity let me just tell you this right now if we've got charity we're not going to be absent from what God has for us in our lives I know many times we and I refer to that quote on Sunday out it is the rising of the sun where brother Raymond said I went wrong he said Satan does not care how right you are in your Doctrine but if you miss the life you're not coming up anyhow and I but I will say this if we've got the right Spirit we'll it will lead me to the right Doctrine so the right spirit will not leave me wondering and out here it'll lead me right into the place that I need to be and so I believe that when we're looking at the love of God it will lead us it will direct us it will have it will help us to be in a place to operate in our lives and for God to move through us because as I said every day is not a crisis in the life of the believer do we have crisis moments we do but that's not why we give ourselves to the love of God he is the very source that we're to operate by and we don't live close to him because there might be a crisis come up we live close to him we love him because he first loved me that's why we live close to him we've experienced that love that love is reached down to our life in the tenderness and sweetness and it's been made real to us it's changed us from creatures of time to creatures of Eternity there's a meaning in our life Hallelujah and this is why that when it all comes down to it that like brother Brown would bring in he says we you can't educate people into loving one another it takes the divine order of almighty God and I believe that with all my heart it does take the divine order of almighty God and we're recognizing even as Paul would tell the Believers follow after charity pursue seek after that let that be the Target that you're racing after you know it's kind of like they when they put those Greyhound dogs on the track and you know in order them dogs are trained to run on that track but you know what they'll put out in front of them and they'll have that thing speed around the track they've got a fake bunny rabbit on a pole and that thing is moving around that track and then dogs take out and they run it keeps them in that place on the track let me just say this when the love of God is what is set before us it keeps us right on track because the angel because the love of God it Works in continuity with the angel of God the Holy Spirit and I believe it takes that divine order this is why Paul could write out of First Timothy 1 and verse 5 and I believe we can invite God in that way in our lives because when it's all said and done like brother Brandon would mention it over and over and you can you you heard in the brother Ram say this again and again in a message and it's something we can Echo out of our Lives we can try to pursue a lot of things Paul's talking to the Corinthians just give me a moment he's talking to the Corinthians and they're looking at Supernatural gifts they're looking at Supernatural things that are taking place and Paul is letting them know don't let that be what you're pursuing after but pursue after the love of God because if you have that and don't have love it's it means nothing is that right brother Brown would even stand there in church order and he I just heard him in the here today in the message in his presence and he's talking about how he's past so many different places and he says but never he said I find a church as spiritual he said as this church and then he says it in the church order and he talks about how finding a church that's spiritual he said no I don't say that because we're a very gifted church he said there's church that have a lot more gifts operating than what we do here but he said that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about the love of God and the word of God going forth freely that's what we're after if we're after love in the love of God is what centered our life and you know in order for that Pursuit it's going to lead us into places of dying to ourselves is that right now first Timothy 1 verse 5 now the end or the completion of the Commandment is Charity out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and a faith on feigned that means without hypocrisy so that's the end or that's the completion that's the Perfection of the Commandment is Charity out of a pure heart you know the first two Commandments that are given out of the Ten Commandments it encompasses the whole once those two are nailed down the rest of the Commandments are just are are actually sealed within those two thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart is that right strength mind and so forth and thy neighbor as thyself when those when that is preeminent then the rest are there as well is that right is that separated it all became all becomes right out of the life so to think about this of what charity itself uh in looking at it I I was going to go through some things here but I want to just say when we're looking at it here with Charity if you don't mind let me run through these things here and these are just points out of that out of First Corinthians 13. and I'm doing this here just for a moment charity it endures long and is patient and kind it's never as envious nor boils over with jealousy it's not boastful or vainglorious it does not display itself hotly what doesn't do that charity does it charity doesn't we can but charity doesn't do that is that right and if we act out of line with the king that's on our heart when you've been born we've been born of the spirit of God if you act out of line with Charity in your heart charity will bring you subject that's the confidence that we have and there's a witness of that it's not conceited which means to be arrogant or inflated with pride it's not rude unmanned let me just go back to it's not conceited arrogant inflated with pride you know it's this is why it's not about always telling everybody everything that God did are you hearing me or this or that or you know and sometimes you know it comes and sometimes sometimes sometimes some of those things it's working in a maturity within a life to recognize hey you don't need to hold that complex anymore your confidence and your peace is in God sure there's times to share but there's experiences that God gives in our life that's for us and him there's things that's not shared with nobody else is that right or and sometimes it isn't even about that of testimonies and healings it can even be about the you know you sometimes no doubt I've heard people and you know if you've done this they've always got the one up oh he's got the one up come on I've been around preachers like that you know it's always got the so what has been the same and what do you do why not throw them out you realize there's molding and shaping we're all being molded and shape it and there's made the temperaments and makeups are all different are you hearing me because there are probably some things some could throw me up for oh boy this is a good one tonight isn't it V it is not rude unmannerly and does not act unbecomingly God's loving us does not insist on its own rights or its own way for it's not self-seeking you know after that when I'd like to have some pooched out lips the pout it's not touchy or fretful or resentful it takes no account of the evil done to it not even in a secret file cabinet stashed away in the basement what do you mean by that well hit the wrong you always do that you oh what was that that's how they always file my whole basement's filled with always it does not rejoice at Injustice and unrighteousness but rejoices when right and Truth prevail we're going we we see things sometimes and there can be things that that are are done even wrongly but the heart of the believer is is God in through the midst of it all Let Your Grace and your love prevail even when brother random and they left because they weren't willing to go along with the order that was in the Tabernacle and they went and established their own church and brother Brandon rebuked people in the congregation for telling for saying that Junior Jackson and them whoever went down there was dirty birds brother random rebuked it and said that's our brother that's a sister Church come on somebody is that right so it comes down to it's not looking at whether you know they're off so we're just expecting them to fail shame on us it's not looking for somebody to fail listen there's times that within every life there are going to be decisions that are made that we don't agree with but that's where we need to be that much more in prayer if we believe we're looking at the right thing and looking in the right way did God help us to have the right heart to get down on our knees and pray for one another who my mama I told you it's unpacking here I don't know where it's all but it's unpacking it Bears up under anything and everything that comes it don't mean there ain't some times that you can't say oh I can't take any more but you get in the presence of God and you realize he took an awful lot from me hello hello it is ever ready to believe the best of every person isn't that what you'd want somebody to do for you I want somebody I would rather have somebody be ready to believe the best of every person not go along with everything that somebody tells you or or they say this and all and then all you have is a bunch of past it from here to here to here to here to here to here come on Friends it hopes are faithless under all circumstances it endures everything I want to just say it like this he is the source of all these things and I know this is very simple but if any one of them attributes that that I was reading off of there tonight out of First Corinthians 13. because there's there's not a time that when the word of God comes forth that it should not strike our hearts and challenge us to go deeper that should be the things like when you know how I would allow those things would wear me out in the prayer line he said but I've grown since then and he says like a little person he said that here they are trying to go down the aisle a little toddler and they're struggling to get down this aisle but he said you let an athlete walk down that aisle he said they know how to walk and don't bother him you let somebody sit there they starting out swimming and man they're just going to town making the other side he said but you let somebody that's older and able to swim they can get to the other side and it don't bother them so much and brother Brandon solidifies that with this statement he said we ought to be growing and it should be growth I want to grow and that's my heart's desire and there's only one way that I'll grow is the more I stay in his presence so I say it in this way he's the source for all of these things but when it comes down to it if I if I go to even look at one of those things and say you know what man I need to focus on that right there I need to focus on let me find one of them I need to focus up on bearing upon anything of everything that comes in Lord help me to Bear up Lord help me to Bear up Lord help me to Bear up if I go to focus just on one thing I'm already starting with the wrong attitude that's pretty it seems like well for the same you know I'm giving myself to that when we can see something where we're falling short remember that is not just one that's just not charity in itself that one thing that I read that is one of the attributes of Charity which is an attribute of God so what it comes down to in our lives is that it's just falling in love with him you know you can live right in the same house with somebody you can eat at the same dinner table set in the same living room and be strangers preach with me now especially in the age we're living in with all the glued devices and everything else you can become strangers even talking at the dinner table for the same I mean you mean talking at the dinner table sitting in the living room yes you can become strangers if if your Pursuit ends with not pursuing the heart of that individual not listening to them preach with me now oh this is getting right down to where the rubber meets the road but it comes to that place it's the same way with God same way with God when we're wanting to see and our lives are being challenged the whole key is is us getting more In God's Presence if you find yourself who that is ruffling my feathers it's not the person that should be a sign I need a fresh refilling of the Holy Ghost I need something that'll give me strength over them [Applause] come on now I need something that'll give me strength that'll turn Pooch lips into the smiley lips right it becomes accurate these are attributes of divine love that comes forth so first John this scripture here just just here at the end of last week just meditating on this part of it I want you to think about this for a moment Hallelujah First John 3 verse 1. behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God now I want to just dwell there for a minute I've never got over what he's done for me look at me and behold notice behold not just not just something that said but behold it's it's taking into view what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us we were unworthy we who didn't deserve it but look what his love has done for our lives now it may not have been something that right away that our change came but his love started dealing with our lives and we might have pushed it back but he kept on dealing with our lives he knew what was beneath the darkness in our lives and I think it behooves us within that the faith how long suffering how forbearing that God has dealt with you and I not just to bring us into the body of Christ not just filling us with the Holy Ghost but after we've been sealed away how his grace has kept us in Step how his grace has come to us how he's ministered to us when we did not deserve it how is provided for us how he spoke to us how he Has Lifted us up behold what manner of love is this that we should be called the sons of God but he would come and Whisper love secrets to us that he would reveal was put on the Lamb's Book of Life when I wrote his name in there what manner of love is this and I I believe that that something when we went oh God help us not to allow that of of all the busyness of Life do you realize busyness we all have things that we have to attend to let me just bring it down so that you understand it as well brother Branham even warned the ministry he said don't get too busy to where you can't get alone and hear God's voice Moses was so busy with the people he forgot significant things are you hearing me so it isn't sometimes it can look like that we're busy about the right things but we've got to have a heart centered on the right things I mean it's easy to tell when we've been we're busy with the wrong things that's an easy thing when there's pursuing after this and pursuing after that and pursuing after all these other things let me tell you something when we are pursuing after the love of God that's when we're pursuing after the right thing that's when our heart is becoming tender oh my first Thessalonians 4 9. that's touching Brotherly Love now watch this this is where it's important beholding what manner of love and you know that manner of love that came to you and I it's according to the word of God it is the word of God being expressed to you and I so beholding that manner of love is actually dwelling in his presence dwelling in his word but that's touching brotherly love you need not that I write unto you not brotherly love that's filial love that's brotherly kindness and Paul would say as touching brotherly love you don't need me to write unto you for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another now why if Paul said you don't need me to write unto you this why why would he say you don't need because he's wrong now to the Corinthian Church he writes it in the Church of Ephesus but he's letting the people know you have a stronger teacher inside of you than anything outside if you only give yourself to the love of God that has come to you he said you don't need any writing to come to you concerning brotherly love for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another and I'm just going to say this God he continues to teach us he continues to minister to us the series of messages I preached elsewhere that if God gives me Grace at some time to bring and to minister here and really dealing in with some of those parts but it is something that is even as you pour through and I'm going through the word there's things that you begin to see how the Holy Spirit puts light upon things in the word of God and it challenges your life the word of God it should be a challenge to our life you know what makes it challenging not just reading it but his presence coming standing here tonight and making that word as it goes down in our life that's what makes it challenging Now watch how Paul says and and indeed ye do it toward all Brethren which are in Macedonia but we beseech your brethren that you increase more and more I say Amen there would be an increase of the love of God let it be as Paul could say shed abroad our hearts Lord let it increase now let me say this there's going to be opportunities but they won't be desirable opportunities there'll be opportunities for God's love to be displayed but just like that of the bull The Hornet the maniac there in Oregon those were not desirable but they were moments for the love of God to step down oh my so Paul he's speaking to them that they would draw from their own experience and I just say that oh my how we we need the grace of God in our lives to lead us and to direct us John 13 34. a new commandment now hear the Lord Jesus would write and was expressed to the people I a new commandment I give unto you that ye love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another now notice that ye love one another as I have loved you that's the way I want you to love one another but that can't be without his love in US and it can't operate without us letting the love of God have the right of way in our lives sometimes the love of God that channel gets jammed up by feeling of love are you hearing me now feel your love is that love of Fellowship brotherly family if it gets jammed up Agape cannot display in the right way but this is where we need agape to be the direction to be the life Giver to be the motivator of feeling or love that's where we need God's love and with God's love it is the grace that overrides our own will are you with me tonight I know it's quiet but this you know this you don't sow seed in windy weather but it's things that we that are things to be looked at and to be given to in our lives because if they say like this we can be ever so revelated but if this is not displayed then all the Revelation means nothing because it's not really operating as Revelation in our life is that right because Revelation is his life inside of us so love to love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another and by this shall men know that you are my disciples if you have love one to another so not if you have the picture of the prophet not if you're carrying a book come on now if you're just going to a church but by this how can how can they see it unless it's expressed let me tell you the reality is whatever whatever a man or a person loves you get around them enough that is what will dominate the conversation that's what will dominate it and if you love God then it's there's always going to be that effect there's always going to be that I'm not talking about then we have to center around and exchange quotes but you understand what I'm saying because our heart there is being in tune with God and there is a love for the body of Jesus Christ there's a love for one another a love that we have not produced but God produces through us John 15 11. let me just see science these things have I wrote to you that my joy May remain in you and that your joy might be full this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you I want you to think of this it talks about this love in the very next verse he says greater love hath no man than this that a man would lay down his life for his friends you know over and over brother Brown would make a statement and I just for the sake of time just let me refer to it you know you'll find that brother Brian said if I ever get to a place then I can't put my arm around any brother that's working for the kingdom of God and recognize him as my brother I feel black backslid he said I'd be scared to stay for him and face evil spirits to know that I had Envy in my heart against any brother no matter who he is that's trying to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ or live a Christian Life if we disagree a million miles upon theology oh no you didn't have to say that oh no if we disagree I'm [Applause] oh boy this is breaking a fallow ground but this is loving one another no matter if they the theology they disagree it's loving one another loving listen loving doesn't mean going along with it but you have love for that brother love for that sister and that means that even though there's things that maybe I don't agree with I don't want to I do not want to disparage or take away from that brother or that sister or that Pastor that I don't want to do that if he loves the Lord Jesus he's my brother it's my sister he said brother Brown goes on to say we've we're the ones who's Drawn Lines Galatians 5 13. let's just look at this here for a moment we're talking about dwelling in the love of God I believe this to be a very a very important key Paul writes it says Brethren you've been called unto Liberty only used not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another so we've yes it's true when we have experienced Liberty in our life but that Liberty does not give us just it's not a liberty just to I just become careless but that Liberty that we receive remember the Holy Ghost is power for service it directs us how placing Us in the body and then the focus becomes Christ and his body that I'm a part of notice but by love serve one another um for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself who's my neighbor one in need that's what the Lord Jesus expressed who's my neighbor the one that's in need that's who my neighbor is but now notice how Paul would write this and says but if ye bite and devour one another take heed that you be not consumed one of another because it becomes like a frenzy feet on one feed on something and it'll just keep on going the love of God is not in the love of God is not in that of tearing of tearing down the love of God is to edify Our Lives and it's not edifying sin but it's edifying one another in Christian love evidently evidently Paul knew there's going to be differences in situations arise and you know why because we're all humans when you are converted your flesh is not converted that's not an excuse your spirit's not converted it's the soul that's converted then there's a molding there's a shaping there's a growing there's a developing of our character and that molding of our character does not mean God coming and cutting things out of our life but it's where we begin to recognize these are weaknesses in my life sometimes the very things that we're proud of well I spoke up and told him my mind those are the very things that God's trying to get us to die to and it isn't going to be like God coming in and cutting this out of of your life or out of my life praise God I've been delivered no you're an overcomer and to overcome is to recognize the devil and every one of his tricks right and then recognize that the god in you is greater and has already overcome that thing that's why the greatest overcoming is you submitting to the Holy Spirit and God overcoming through you as you overcome and subdue your temperament yet God has made you in a special way but God wants it all under his control oh my that's why look you you you can't do that I can't do that for you no you can't do it for me but As We Lay In God's Presence God brings things to light in our life and we can say Lord mold me shape me Lord Change Me Lord God knows how to bring it out in her heart don't he this I say look at this prescription walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit it's not our human spirit in the capital of s and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things you would but if you be led of the spirit you are not under the law now let me just let me just skip over here down into verse 22. but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there's no law now what's a fruit a fruit is only the display of the life within is that right it's got to have a branch to display through you don't have fruit coming out the trunk right you can see right now in this beautiful weather we've been at you see the buds you see certain flowers you see certain trees that are budding right now right you see those things and some of that will continue to go on even in gone coming days and times like I'm sure we'll we'll drive by the Apple Vineyards and we'll see the beautiful flowers on the trees the pink the white and so forth you know if you if you like those kind of things but remember that in itself is only leading to where they'll come forth fruit and fruit itself is a product of the life within moving through the branch that's why Jesus could say if you abide in me and my word abide in you then ask what you will and it shall be done unto you it's abiding in his presence and that fruit it comes out of our lives let me just say this like you take Faith itself you don't have to think about faith coming out this faith that we're talking about here is God's faith it's that faith that motivates even to move our own faith and it's things that will happen sometimes subconscious but it's Faith toward God it's meekness toward God it's Temperance it's it's taking con it's taking control and here it is there's situations that arise that Merit that there would be fruit that would come out of our life it's not just something that when we're in other words I'm going to say it like this remember it's not just something that's coming forth like ow oh here it is here's long-suffering coming forth for what for what well you know I'm just there's long suffering there's gentleness no you have for that fruit of long-suffering comes forth when things are so contrary and you're tempted to go the other way that's when the fruit of long-suffering comes out fruit is not produced on mountaintops it comes in the valley that's where Temperance that's where self-controlled to wear in the midst of a trial you might feel like running but you stand steadfast on the word of God that's fruit and they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust if we live this is really the verse if we live in the spirit if this is where we're living if we are dwelling in the Spirit dwelling in God he's there in the center our lives have been changed let us also walk in the spirit you would look at that scripture and this that's this that Paul has wrote that in an earlier part you would look at that scripture and you would think that ought to be a given now it doesn't mean somebody's gonna if they're living in the spirit that they're going to go out and live in sin but Paul is letting us know of the privilege let all of your law walk be regulated by him don't don't don't just let Liberty and being loose but be focused on him Lord where's the next step I want to step higher I want to move closer so this is where of that responsibility that we were speaking of last week in Jude chapter 1 and verse 20 beloved beloved building up yourselves on your Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost keep yourselves in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life what a responsibility and yet this is the victory right here the victory is not separate attributes but this is the victory of keeping ourselves in the love of God even as it's wrote when you look at this word it's to be on guard because things that would want to pull you out pull you out into other realms this is why that when we looked at that in the scripture where brother Branham had mentioned that the where that if we get into a place and we separate from Divine love we can never Overlook our brother's mistakes no more because let me say this we're all going to have the mistakes that's what brother Branham could say it in the Hebrew series he said we he said do not backslide on God we backslide on Christ and he said before the church at times we one another will see things he but if we are in Christ you can never backslide on God because God can only see the blood are you hearing me that's why that God he was in Abraham and so this is why of saying this is why it is also very important let me just say it this way these should be indicators like on the gauge on our um our cars I mean I hope we don't run around and say I don't know if it's on empty or not I don't know maybe got a little bit more to go it only dinged once if it dinged it means you know it's all right a couple more days going to work you'll be all right man but we got gauges don't we we got gauges you don't go down the road now I know I've rode in cars with people where their gauges had got off I've rode in cars where they're uh speedometer was off for some reason my mind I think I drove someone I worked for the greenhouse but maybe I'm wrong maybe but I know I've been in vehicles and you know what you're kind of trying to guess by what you're seeing or who's around you but those gauges are made so you you can have a proper reading on where you're at I think tonight if we can look at the word of God in the right way and we're seeing the word of God we're seeing it as gauges that Lord if I'm having issues with looking over somebody's mistakes somebody's failures that's a gauge that I need to get back in the love of God where I need to be it's not a condemnation it's a gauge that says get back in move in closer moving deeper this is why Peter would say first Peter 4 7. but the end of all things is at hand realizing where we're at be therefore sober and watch unto prayer and above all things above all things have fervent charity among yourselves in other words if there's anything that's going to be boiling up in the fire and man it's hot Let It Be charity Let It Be charity among you for charity shall cover the multitude of sins it shall cover and that word it means to hide or Veil to hinder the knowledge of a thing hiding about because remember Peter's not writing about hiding sin what Peter's dealing with right here is I'm just going to say it in plain terms not becoming a big mouth about it I know what so-and-so did and so and so did this and then we become busy beavers that ain't the spirit of God the spirit of God will never lead you to tell something on somebody else's character it won't do that because the objective remember charity does not rejoice in iniquity it rejoices in righteousness it believes the best of an individual let me tell you something there's a lot about you and I that's not the best but down beneath but down beneath hello somebody because you know it's always this is one of the things where we live at sometimes we can come and we can hear the word and we're not even taking it in and reflecting the way we need to be in our lives I'm saying all of us because when you think of it there can be things that that can arise and come up and things and I'm just going to say it very plainly as a pastor I can go back many different times and some of you know my mind and my memory within certain things and I can recall and say my goodness I just preached on this I just went through this I just spoke on this right here and you look at you say well brother Sammy in your mind I'm not expecting things to be mental but I look at it God was already identifying the proper prescription on how to approach certain things that's why we don't want to come here and just let the word pass right through us we want to say God let the word find its place in my life because not only would I am presently facing but whatever it is that's coming in the future you are the eyes Lord that's showing me you're on the control tower and you've got a man position here that's moved by the unction of the Holy Spirit to identify the enemy that's coming on I don't say that to Daniel I say it if we can be in that real spot the recognizing the word of God we're not coming here to here I intellect we're coming here to be moved by the spirit of God then our lives would be molded and shaped by him so Paul is talking about nothing you know not sweeping something under a rug Paul's talking about where love itself remember has he worked with the Corinthian Church they had it they had a situation you know it was there that where the young man it wasn't even where he was living and one living right was living you know with his his father had already passed on and he's living there with stepmother and Paul called it out and said wait a minute that ain't the right covering of sin covering is to not talk about it but to work to deal with it to remedy it to let me just say it like this if somebody's out of the way if my heart is right in the wrong that I want to see that heart restored are you hearing me true mama mama everybody still all right this is why Proverbs chapter 10 verse 12 said hatred stirth up strives but love cometh all sins Proverbs 17 9 he back covereth a transgression seeketh love and maybe the new updated version is he that post about it seeketh attention that's a New Living Translation he that you know whatever it is now you know uh Instagram and Tick Tock and everything he whoever seeketh attention oh my family who am I this oh my pastor oh my church oh my this oh my oh my oh my oh my oh my oh my he that covert the transgression seeketh love I want to pursue love it takes something Mighty big and they know what that is it takes God because what the objective is is for things to be right to be restored God's in the restoring business and this is why brother Brandon I'm closing here I I'm not gonna I'm just going to wrap this up right here but let me just let me read this this out of the message humble thyself but the Brand's talking about the main thing is love and I love how he says this here it's let's all grow closer to God by humbling ourselves in another quote I won't get to but he says Let's Love let's love God that's the main thing and humble ourselves with it I don't know about you because when I look and I'm meditating and I'm listening here within the message I do not listen to the message as a check sheet I listen to it as an ongoing MRI of my life when it says the main thing is the love of God and to Humble ourselves with it that means it's God's responsibility to save me it's God's responsibility the love of God to draw me to do the work in my life it now becomes my responsibility responding out of the love that has come to me to humble myself with that love that then becomes my responsibility he says let's all get closer to God by humbling ourselves in paragraph 40 there Brianna don't forget this Tabernacle will lose its strength this is a target where Satan has got every gun in Hell trained on it now you know there's similar quotes in Christ the mystery right it's one thing as we read this read this quote and we can read it but we need the spirit of God to identify and say Lord bring it to light I'm not saying light now but light when things were coming on it just let it be something that passes through as though that what in the world is going on but to recognize look Satan's got every gun in Hell trained on it he'll calls one person to do something that's contrary to what the other one thinks wow you mean we think differently you mean God just didn't cookie cutter and made us oh they all think the same way we all sit in the front row wouldn't that be a blessing here in this church I think we need to do away with the front row we just make a back row but it caused one person to do something that's contrary to what the other person thinks he is doing that that he is Satan he is up to it that's his business if he can get somebody to say something somebody to talk about someone well listen did you know so and so did that's wrong right there are you hearing me that's covering a transgression not spreading it because the objective is is for God to be able to move the objective is not I need a group to then facilitate the way I feel I want everybody here around me to feel the same way I feel that's wrong that's wrong listen did you know that so-and-so did no what did it what did they do oh if we could just be that adamant about what God wants to tell us don't you listen to it how do you hear something and not listen to it how do you do that how do you hear and not listen you tune it out as soon as you can hear where something is going turn it out hello somebody tune it out don't you listen to it at all that's the devil it's Satan don't you believe it if there is anything y'all believe this okay I do so I'm going to read it anyhow if there's anything that somebody has done wrong pray for them and don't pray in US and I've got to pray for that brother well I can just feel the atmosphere and the angels coming right now I've got to pray for him that's kind of like you know getting two school kids together and you say you're sorry and you say you're sorry who who that was warm right I mean I remember when I taught the fourth grade and fifth grade around morning time you telling your sorry you tell me save your breath they'll be on the playground a little bit playing put one over here and one over there okay you're not in that Dolphins reading group today you're in the turtles you take it to your heart really down for that sister and just talk and be real sweet and the first thing you know you'll find him right back in the service again because after all we're headed towards the setting of the Sun and friends I tell you the key is this Lord is being sweet and God how we be sweet by the presence we're in he's the sweetener to our life and just close with that the Bible make a statement and this is as I was praying I got to thinking about a quote I had read across and read across it many times brother Brennan would say in one place that day on Calvary he would say we need a Revival of love Among Us and one of the quotes that his eye was in prayer you've been here today and it came back to it came back where brother Bram says we need a fresh baptism of the love of God and I I just what was pressing on my heart as I was in prayer I thought you know that's it's just nothing but the truth because you know you know how it is when you've been in a real good meeting a good service if or you've been in prayer you've had a you've had a good quality time I mean you're refreshed you come out and man I mean tires could have been flat but you're just refreshed I mean it could have been anything else you're not even thinking about all the negative you're not even thinking in a way there's not even there's not even any room for a thought to cross you about boss or so and so on it's just no room there's nothing to stick to and yet we're sticky at First Step first nature is still sticky but what does that it's being in his presence that's what has an effect Upon Our Lives and that's why I just as I was just striking and I said God grant us a refilling a refilling of the love of God a refilling of the Holy Spirit to where to think about you you know and I'm talking about when you've walked out of prayer you've walked out of a service and might just been one of those that just you just saturated I mean you you wonder if you're just leaving tracks wherever you go you feel like you're just like a sponge I can't contain no more I'm saturated and I believe that's what God's desire is that's the whole goal and victory in our life we're not going to get to a place to where we don't have well I haven't had nobody offend me and let me see how many days since the last person offended me no is God fences are going to come fence is going to come things are going to come all right that's all and even of all the humanity that we have around but the key within it all is following after charity is staying in the love of God stay in the word of God stay in his presence brother Brown said when Adam got away from keeping the pure love of God the word of God in his heart that's when he got away and he could no longer overlook the mistakes isn't incredible what happened in the Garden of Eden as soon as in the presence of God Adam wasn't taking responsibility this woman you gave me she's the reason and here where did she stand she said the serpent he began me nobody wants to take responsibility but oh when we can dwell in the love of God gives us Grace to face the responsibilities that we're faced with and say Lord I want us I want to stand tall in your grace I want to be right where I'm supposed to be Lord because crisis every day is not a crisis every moment's not a crisis but we need God's grace for every moment of our life because as we're we're in love with God we're staying in his presence there's times that even when you're reading and I'm bringing it down to this place you're reading you're praying and sometimes you feel like that there's just nothing going on but there is you give yourself to him even when you read even as you're listening to a message Lord speak to me today Lord speak to me today you know what I have a need of Lord and you're giving yourself to him and what's God come on the scene it may not be right at that moment it might be something that comes later on down the line but let's pursue the right things let's pursue the love of God let that be the focus let that be the goal if there's anything let it be the love of God brother Brian said they could offer me he said if God came down tonight and said I'll give you any gift that's here or I'll give you divine love brother Brahm said I'd tell him I'll take Divine love he said Give Me Love I say Lord let it be a fresh baptism a fresh refilling let's pray Heavenly Father Lord truly Lord not only tonight but I believe God in our lives as we can stand and look and behold what manner of love that has been bestowed upon us Lord that we should be called the sons of God it's truly Lord God abiding under and in your love where our lives are changed from Glory unto Glory father this is Lord the objective Lord in our lives and our hearts we want to just Lord unreservedly give ourselves Lord to you Lord that it that's the goal in our life if there's one thing that is set before us Lord oh God let it be the motivator of every aspect and every part of our life the love of God oh Lord Jesus it's was love that drove you to become one of us and to take our sin upon yourself that you might Minister Lord to our needs Lord help us we're I believe that God that there are times where we have to be we unsee this there's times where there's a time to be firm but Lord I believe we can move and operate in things Lord without being rude I pray that God that you would just give each one Lord each one of us the grace that Lord that's needed Lord we need you Lord and sometimes Lord the real truth of the matter is their situations and things that take us by surprise Lord there's things Lord that just like just as much Lord as when the prophet walked in that pasture that day when they stood on the platform in Oregon when he was mowing there in the backyard those things Lord that happened it was not planned it was not even anything that was thought about but there's situations that do take place Lord and how we need your grace and your mercy I realize Lord sometimes as we go and we move and we navigate sometimes through things and Lord I believe that as your word is said they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover I believe that but I also know that there's times where there's things Lord that you want us to be desperate in our life and that we step aside and really get into prayer and really seek after you Lord Lord maybe sometimes it's when we look at these things with I want to seek until I've got the right attitude the right feeling I want to seek until my heart everything is just right to where it needs to be Lord we're talking about a useful life job's life was a useful life and that's the Lord sometimes there's things that we have to pray and pray out and pray and seek Lord sometimes through very Lord bitter situations but God this is where as we'll go to prayer and go to you in prayer and Lord if we can just get lifted off the ground and just get into your presence it's that refreshing that comes Upon Our Life where the burdens that seem so great and or whatever the the situation might be we come out of their Lord with life that's been refreshed by do from heaven where our lives have been able to come under the Peace of almighty God and your presence has settled down lord sometimes Lord it's just to get in there and say Lord you know what's on my heart it's just to get in there Lord just to enter in Lord I I want to come into your presence Lord I Need there's needs that I have that you know Lord I don't even know how to express them but you know Lord granted Lord I pray Lord as we look upon these your word and we see the gauges [Music] I think your Prophet looked at the gauges in his life when he stood there and standing in the Gap and even before that message he realized that the feeling that had come about him that he was not going to be able to help people unless you could get that feeling back in his life and he said that that little something I lost in that complex complex is a way of thinking oh God I believe there's one thing that you spoke to us and you let us know the prophet was standing there [Music] Lord I'm glad that you let those things be known I'm glad that there was a man of God in this hour and I know there's times to be transparent with things but I believe God that you allowed that for our lives that we could see the grace of God for our own lives oh you know I think Lord how many times I could read certain things Lord prior to even the seals being opened brother Brandon requesting and going over his life over and over and over but here he stands and this is after the opening of the seals but Lord I believe it shows us as a people that God how important it is of giving our lives to you the main thing is to have the love of God and to Humble ourselves with it Lord I pray if there's one in in the audience tonight seen or unseen that does not have that Lord I pray tonight that you would move in a way Lord that they would be able to look at the gauge that's before them and say I don't have that I need the love of God I need the Seal of the Living God I need that to wear that my love for God it's not a love in my mind but it's something in my heart that's displayed back to God [Music] and it's displayed toward one another to where Lord it becomes evident that's a Christian that's a Believer that's one who loves God [Music] Lord I pray if there's one tonight that doesn't know you in that way may they give themselves to you Lord may they follow after charity may they pursue it Lord May each of us that are here Lord that know you in that way I ask the Lord may you grant tonight Lord afresh baptism Lord afresh refilling Lord granted Lord we're looking at the gauges Lord and I need more of you Lord [Music] I don't want to see how close to empty that I can run I want to be full I want to be full or sometimes right now we'll drive and my we may only need ten dollars worth of gas but if gas drops five cents we're there to get it want to stay full God made that be may that be Lord to see the reality may that be the Lord the desire the blessing that we can see the effect of it Lord not just look at the gauge and say well I'm good to go I'll be good for a little bit longer but may we not Lord run to gauge down to E but may we stay full to where our lives are saturated Lord [Music] we're going to have feelings Lord we'll have discouragements we'll have differences but Lord when differences and feelings and everything is what Lord is dominating our life and that's time for a refilling and I pray God tonight as we draw from that I don't want to just wait to that I don't want to wait till I see myself sticky to we're not no God where it's I can't overlook this but Lord let it be in our lives oh Lord I need you Lord every hour I need you Lord I need more of you Lord Hallelujah glory be to God [Music] every moment of the day Lord [Music] granted Lord we pray in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah oh my don't you love him Hallelujah I know it's simple but it's real overcoming it's real overcoming I say God fill me up Lord Fill Me In sometimes you're on a long trip you'll stop multiple times to get filled up right you look oh I need to get filled up oh but that's why friends even in your prayer life you might pray 20 minutes here 10 minutes there 10 minutes there don't make prayer a check in and check out that's why it's time for Philip I think I'll just top this thing off right now or to be to God keep ourselves in the love of God oh how we need we need him and we need one another we need one another remember Satan's desire is try to divide us is Desiring but I say let the bloodstained banner be lifted up let it be the love that reached out to you and me let it be that love let it be that that undying love that reached out and Drew us amen let's stand tonight go ahead and sing brother Brian
