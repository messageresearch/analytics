[25:44] about this I can make that statement
[25:46] brother branham made that statement
[25:48] clear back in 1964 he wasn't saying that
[25:52] to put people down but he's letting us
[25:55] know of darkness do you recognize where
[25:57] darkness darkness knows no ends it keeps
[26:01] going it keeps working to where things
[26:03] that would you you look we've seen this

[26:07] going on even right now more movements
[26:09] continue to come more movements continue
[26:11] to come everybody is so moved by their
[26:14] feelings well I feel this is right I
[26:17] feel they ought not do this I feel feel
[26:19] feel feel feel feel feel feel feel and
[26:22] you're not careful you'll get remor
[26:24] you'll get caught up in that social
[26:25] mumbo jumbo to come on somebody because
[26:29] you know what they want to play on who
[26:31] you are you've got to remember you're
[26:34] not called here to be a part of their
[26:36] movement there is one movement and it's
[26:39] not the movement of man it's the move
[26:42] holy ghost it's the move of the pride of
[26:46] the Lord Jesus Christ glory be to God
[26:50] hallelujah gross darkness
[26:53] I'll cover the people but the Lord shall
[26:58] arise upon him and his glory shall be
[27:03] seen upon thee and the Gentiles shall
[27:09] come to thy light and Kings to the
[27:11] brightness of thy rising wear the brim
[27:22] says when man has sent a message so long
[27:24] when man see you living like him when he
[27:29] sees your character and your conduct
[27:31] with the word just exactly like he was
[27:33] the word being manifest then man will
[27:38] see Jesus Christ they won't have to look
[27:42] around anywhere else and say what does

[27:47] teach they'll know what God is when they
[27:51] see you

[28:24] royal priesthood a holy nation a
[28:31] peculiar people

[28:40] forth the praises of him
[28:45] that called you out of darkness into
[28:50] this marvelous light which in times past
[28:56] were not a people once you think of how
[28:59] this is worded there was no order about
[29:03] our lives we were in chaos we could say
[29:07] all we were Gentiles but we were not a
[29:09] people God looks at a people is one who
[29:12] is assembled to him by his namesake we
[29:16] were not a people but are now the people
[29:20] of God which had not obtained mercy but
[29:25] now have obtained mercy can I read one
[29:31] more - you may read this quote here I
[29:37] know it's small had to try to dig that
[29:39] up brother Richard can't you see that
[29:41] okay back there okay and I know the rest
[29:44] you can see it
[29:45] and the only way that God can preach the
[29:49] gospel today is through that lump of
[29:52] clay God's God doesn't need machinery he
[29:57] just needed lumps of clay lumps of
[30:00] surrendered claim and that's why he is
[30:05] keeping you here you want to know why

[31:54] I've been through believe me you're
[31:55] looking at the wrong way remember
[31:57] remember when the purpose that we are
[32:00] coming here is that he might speak to
[32:02] our lives the first thing that goes from
[32:09] you assembling yourself together with
[32:10] the Saints is your heart and when your
[32:14] heart goes outside your body will follow
[32:18] that's a truth it's your heart
[32:22] Omaha hey commonality is a big thing in
[32:26] it it's easy to become common with one
[32:29] another that's where we need the help of
[32:31] the Lord lord help me to be able to look
[32:34] beyond vessels help me be to be able to
[32:36] when I come here I come here how many
[32:38] days a week or how many a survey how
[32:40] many how many services out of the month
[32:42] i lord help me not to let this become
[32:45] common you realize friends it's not just
[32:47] something that just oh it just becomes
[32:48] common it will become a part of your
[32:51] life and who you are that's up to you
[32:55] you can either be known you can be a
[32:56] full-time work on your job and yet
[32:58] people call you a part-time worker hello
[33:02] somebody you know I'm saying but it's up
[33:05] to you do you want to be a full-time
[33:07] worker and be known to be a full-time
[33:08] worker it's up to you you're the only
[33:10] one that makes it you're the only one
[33:12] that can make that choice and that's why
[33:16] you sit people have a right to come to
[33:19] Christ and say Lord Jesus if you only
[33:23] heal me now I'll go I may not be a
[33:25] preacher but I'll talk about it I'll do
[33:29] everything that I can
[33:31] you are the vine I'm one of the branches
[33:34] now the vine doesn't bear fruit the
[33:37] branches bears fruit not the vine the
[33:39] branch the vine only puts the energy
[33:42] into it the gospel can be creep pre
[33:45] preached by Christ if you'll open
[33:47] yourself and be a branch that old bear
[33:51] forth fruit did you catch what he said
[33:52] the gospel can be preached by Christ
[33:56] he's just told us you don't have to be a
[33:59] preacher for the gospel to be preached
[34:02] Paul said the Word of God has sounded
[34:05] out from you the gospel can be creature
[34:11] be preached by Christ if you open up
[34:13] yourself and be a branch that will bear
[34:15] fruit others can see Christ in you by
[34:20] your testimony by your life and the way
[34:23] you live
[34:24] he is the energy but you're the show
[34:27] picture you're the walking Bible no man
[34:33] light of a candle and hide of it under a
[34:37] bushel but he that lighteth it he sets
[34:41] it on a candlestick positioned in him
[34:47] the body
[34:49] for what purpose to show light you see
[34:54] in all the places where you live where
[34:56] you go think of this friends God did not
[34:58] want I look at it if if brother Branham
[35:01] had still been here I don't think any of
[35:04] us would have to think where we would be
[35:05] planning on going this weekend nobody
[35:07] had to think about it is that right we'd
[35:10] probably be going right down we'd be
[35:12] traveling to wherever brother branham's
[35:13] at withers in Jeffersonville and Matt be
[35:14] down in Jonesboro or you might be it
[35:16] don't matter
[35:17] we'd we'd probably be trying to
[35:20] but you see God the message itself has
[35:24] already been spoken what God wanted to
[35:27] say has already been said but now that
[35:31] same God who spoke it is the same God
[35:33] making it real in our lives and in our
[35:37] hearts and God did not want just one
[35:41] little place and everybody gather to
[35:42] that one little physical location but
[35:45] remember that one place that is so
[35:47] important that we be and that's in the
[35:49] Lord Jesus Christ it's in that one body
[35:52] and God would have so much about
[35:54] diversity that is set up God would have
[35:56] one little outpost here God would have
[35:57] one little outpost there don't why would
[35:59] God have that think of this what if
[36:02] there had not been light come by your
[36:05] way oh brother say me I was hungry but
[36:08] who put that hunger in you who put it in
[36:10] you to where you could not be satisfied
[36:12] where you were who did that that was
[36:15] already within you but how God shined
[36:19] that light right across there and that
[36:21] light when they begin to minister to you
[36:23] it began to warm up and here you begin
[36:25] to walk in it and eventually that light
[36:27] itself it lights you up and then as it
[36:29] lights you up then Christ Himself he
[36:32] sets you on the candlestick all these
[36:39] places even where we live where we work
[36:43] where you go to school sometimes being a
[36:47] light it's not necessarily all that we
[36:50] say it's the life that we live and
[36:56] remember the life that we live it speaks
[37:01] volumes it ministers it preaches that's
[37:07] last scripture that we let's stand that
[37:10] we mentioned let your light let your
[37:15] light I think that's such a big word let
[37:20] your light
[37:23] so shine that they may see your good
[37:30] works how many know he's not talking
[37:35] about delivering fruit baskets how many
[37:40] know that he's not talking about opening
[37:42] the doors for the elderly those are all
[37:44] wonderful things he's not talking about
[37:47] that but remember your good works is him
[37:52] working through you because there's
[37:55] nothing good in you and me if there's
[38:00] any work that is good it's him doing the
[38:04] work remember they asked the Lord Jesus
[38:05] what must we do that we might work the
[38:07] works of God believe on Him whom he had
[38:10] sent and that you might work the works
[38:16] of God that would they may glorify your
[38:20] father which is in heaven
[38:23] I said Lord I want my vessel to shine
[38:30] wherever I'm at wherever God's placed
[38:32] you at whatever the job is wherever it's
[38:35] at let it shine you realize sometimes
[38:38] remember it's the light shining through
[38:41] you that makes a way for even the light
[38:44] to be spoken through you said Lord just
[38:49] shine through me let it give light Lord
[38:52] let it be there I've seen pictures here
[38:56] I was looking at just some wonderful
[38:59] pictures that showed some little
[39:01] children kneeling beside the bed praying
[39:03] and then it showed a little pictures of
[39:06] you know them sliding glass doors that
[39:08] you have it showed some children as
[39:11] they're praying there and when you look
[39:13] that they took the picture and looking
[39:15] at it's a drawing they took a picture
[39:17] and looking at those glass sliding doors
[39:20] and you see the Lord Jesus standing
[39:23] right there in that room that's our
[39:27] desire we may not always we may not see
[39:30] it all the time may not feel it it's not
[39:33] about that it's let your light shine let
[39:37] your life be so placed by God God where
[39:40] you have for me your position your
[39:42] placement Lord
