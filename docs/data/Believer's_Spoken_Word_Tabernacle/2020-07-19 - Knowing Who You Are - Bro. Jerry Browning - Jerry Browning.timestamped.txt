[29:18] we've been streaming online so we've
[29:20] been with you in
[29:21] all the services and uh have enjoyed the
[29:25] ministry that
[29:29] god has given us in this last day amen
[29:33] this is our heads go to him in the word
[29:35] of prayer heavenly father we
[29:37] thank you lord this morning god for this
[29:41] opportunity
[29:43] for us to be gathered together in your
[29:46] name lord
[29:47] we ask god that you would have your way
[29:50] in this service lord may
[29:52] lord you anoint me they're gone that you
[29:55] can speak lord the thought which you've
[29:57] placed upon my heart your god that would
[30:00] be a help to the people dear god
[30:03] encouragement i pray in jesus christ's
[30:06] name
[30:06] we ask amen
[30:11] i'd like to read from psalms 47
[30:17] verse 2 through 4.
[30:33] what i would like to speak on this
[30:36] morning is
[30:36] knowing who you are
[30:43] for the lord most high is terrible he is
[30:46] a great king over all the earth
[30:49] and he shall subdue the people under us
[30:51] and the nations under our feet
[30:53] he shall choose our inheritance for us
[30:56] the excellency
[30:58] of jacob whom he loved
[31:01] now if you can turn with me to romans
[31:02] chapter 9
[31:10] verse 10-13
[31:16] not only this when rebecca had conceived
[31:20] by one even our father isaac
[31:22] for the children being not yet born
[31:24] neither having done
[31:25] any good or evil that the purpose of god
[31:29] according to election might stand not of
[31:31] works
[31:32] but of him that calleth it was said unto
[31:35] her the elders shall serve the younger
[31:37] as it is written jacob have i love but
[31:40] esau have i hated
[31:42] may be seated
[31:47] i know we live in a time where
[31:50] you know as we're coming closer down to
[31:52] the end
[31:54] satan's just going to put on more and
[31:56] more pressure
[31:58] and there's the pressures of the world
[32:00] the uh pressures of
[32:01] life i guess i should say that are
[32:04] honest and uh
[32:06] uh satan many times will take things
[32:09] that
[32:09] there are pressures on us and they make
[32:11] like a mountain out of a
[32:13] molehill and he'll just
[32:16] worry your mind over things
[32:20] but then we deal with a lot of other
[32:21] things we deal with
[32:23] things that some people deal with
[32:27] anxiety because of something that's
[32:30] causing it
[32:31] you realize there are other people who
[32:32] deal with anxiety and there's
[32:35] nothing tangible that they can put it to
[32:38] why they're suffering from that or
[32:40] depression or whatever
[32:42] it's just something it's it's a disease
[32:45] just like cancer or or high blood
[32:48] pressure or diabetes or whatever there's
[32:51] diseases of the mind and
[32:55] these uh individuals uh uh
[32:58] you'd say you can't tell them well you
[33:00] know god's gonna take care of everything
[33:02] that
[33:02] they're not worried about that they
[33:05] can't help that they're feeling this
[33:08] because there's a it's a disease but
[33:12] we know that the lord that the bible
[33:15] says that
[33:16] god is the lord that healeth
[33:19] all of our diseases so it's not just
[33:22] those
[33:23] of of the body but those of the mind as
[33:27] well
[33:28] and we must lean on him for those things
[33:30] and in this time
[33:32] of going through so many tests and
[33:34] trials and
[33:36] you're being tried because friends we're
[33:38] coming down to the end
[33:40] and once we once we go
[33:43] from this realm to the next realm your
[33:46] trials are over
[33:49] all right but you've got to have your
[33:51] trials here
[33:52] so that you can be perfected because
[33:55] once you
[33:55] reach that other side
[33:58] you're supposed to be perfect
[34:02] there's no more working on your
[34:03] character then
[34:05] there's no more working on on on on your
[34:08] being
[34:09] it all that's done here and now
[34:12] and uh after the marriage supper when we
[34:15] go into the time of the millennium
[34:17] why it's not character building time
[34:20] it's time to rule and reign
[34:24] and so now we go through things
[34:27] to build our character and to make us
[34:30] ready to reign and the thing
[34:34] that that will help you going through
[34:37] all these things is knowing who you are
[34:41] because when you know who you are then
[34:43] you know where you stand
[34:46] and you know what you can depend upon
[34:50] and in this day satan look he never
[34:54] gives up
[34:56] he uh he clocks in every day right on
[34:59] time and he's right there waiting on you
[35:02] and you know he's been around a lot
[35:04] longer than you have
[35:06] and he's known a lot more people than
[35:08] you've ever known
[35:10] and so he knows about every trick in the
[35:12] book
[35:14] and he's there constantly trying to tell
[35:18] people
[35:18] you're not no you're not god
[35:24] he's there to point at every mistake you
[35:26] make and every fault you have
[35:28] to point it out and say see i told you
[35:30] so
[35:32] you know and he don't care if you sit on
[35:34] the pews here
[35:37] he don't care if you come to church
[35:38] regularly and sit on these pews
[35:41] as long as you don't receive the word
[35:44] that's coming forth but when you know
[35:47] who you are then you know the word
[35:49] that's coming forth is for you
[35:51] [Applause]
[35:55] and that's something that satan can't
[35:57] combat
[35:58] because the province said when the bride
[36:00] realizes who she is
[36:02] she would be an invincible army that not
[36:06] even
[36:06] satan would be able to come against her
[36:09] but it's not by
[36:10] our might or our power but it's that
[36:12] there's greater is he that's in me than
[36:15] he that's in the world
[36:16] there's a power that resides in me that
[36:19] that is not of me it's of him
[36:23] [Applause]
[36:24] amen and that's how we overcome
[36:29] now there's something that before either
[36:34] boy was born esau or jacob
[36:36] that god had already chose jacob
[36:40] neither boyd had a chance to do evil or
[36:43] good
[36:45] but god had already chose jacob
[36:49] and he he loved jacob and it's because
[36:53] he knows the beginning from the end
[36:59] he knows what's in your heart
[37:03] he knows what brother branham said he
[37:05] knows what you
[37:07] it doesn't matter what you say he knows
[37:10] what you mean
[37:11] from your heart
[37:15] and he knew jacob's heart before jacob
[37:18] even had a heart to beat
[37:26] now think of david when david come
[37:30] against
[37:30] goliath one of the things you can draw
[37:34] from that
[37:35] is david knew where he was standing
[37:38] david knew who was on his side
[37:42] he didn't rely on the the armor that
[37:45] saul tried to offer him or the sword or
[37:47] all these things
[37:48] but instead he relied on the god
[37:52] and he and he relied on it by experience
[37:58] when you truly experience something
[38:00] friends the devil can't take that from
[38:02] you when you've had a real experience
[38:05] with god
[38:07] you can stand on that and the devil
[38:09] can't
[38:10] persuade you from it you've had the
[38:13] experience
[38:14] and david had had the experience of
[38:16] having god come down
[38:18] and helping kill a bear and help him
[38:21] kill alive
[38:22] so he said who is this this philistine
[38:26] to come against the armies of god
[38:33] and he used what he knew
[38:37] when satan comes against your friends
[38:40] don't
[38:41] don't try to reason with him because
[38:42] he's too good of a reasoner
[38:45] just use what you know
[38:49] use what you're already familiar with
[38:53] it's just like when uh
[38:57] john ryan came before brother brandon to
[38:59] be prayed for
[39:01] and he didn't receive his sight brother
[39:03] branham said
[39:04] you just go forth saying by his stripes
[39:07] i'm healed
[39:09] john ryan didn't look for something else
[39:12] he just kept using that over and over
[39:16] he depended on it he didn't get to say
[39:19] well i've said this
[39:20] many times now maybe it ain't gonna come
[39:22] to pass no he just
[39:24] kept saying it that's all he knew
[39:28] so he just kept using what he knew buy
[39:30] his stripes on him
[39:32] extra extra he read all about it by his
[39:35] stripes on hill
[39:37] until one time when the barber and the
[39:40] men were going to make fun of him
[39:42] and he said by his stripes i'm healed
[39:44] then the healing
[39:45] came and he received his sight but
[39:48] friends the hilly was there
[39:50] all the time but john ryan had to go
[39:53] through it this way god could have
[39:56] healed him right on the spot
[39:58] give him his eyesight right then and
[40:00] there but why did he do it
[40:02] because god knew what john ryan needed
[40:05] to go through
[40:10] and also god knew there was a barber out
[40:13] there that needed to be put in his place
[40:24] now unless god elected you you couldn't
[40:27] be a christian today
[40:33] pardon me
[40:44] it wasn't you calling god it was god
[40:48] that called you
[40:51] it wasn't you looking for god it was god
[40:54] that came after you
[40:58] and you know what god knows what it took
[41:02] to get you he knew what
[41:06] he was going to have to do he knew what
[41:08] would have to come your way
[41:10] he knew what he'd have to let come your
[41:13] way
[41:15] friends listen the devil can't even do
[41:18] nothing
[41:19] without it in the end bringing glory to
[41:21] god
[41:24] the devil afflicts somebody with
[41:25] sickness and god turns around and heals
[41:26] them and it's
[41:27] glory to god
[41:29] [Applause]
[41:31] i heard one some years and years ago
[41:35] brother tim pruitt say
[41:36] you know when you get sick just look at
[41:38] that as an opportunity to get healed
[41:43] hallelujah when you get bound just look
[41:45] at it as an opportunity to be delivered
[41:49] it's an opportunity for god to do a work
[41:51] in your life when you're going
[41:52] when you're going through the valley and
[41:55] it looks like you ain't ever going to
[41:57] get out of it
[41:58] just realize it's an opportunity for god
[42:01] to do something in your life
[42:03] [Applause]
[42:08] that's where god really works on us it's
[42:10] down in the valley
[42:14] and satan can't do anything unless god
[42:16] allows him to do it to you anyway
[42:19] so in the end like i said it's just
[42:21] going to bring glory to god
[42:26] when god called you it showed he elected
[42:29] you
[42:31] and then you accepted that call
[42:35] that shows who you are
[42:39] you might i i don't know each of your
[42:41] spiritual
[42:42] standing today there might be some here
[42:46] standing and say well brother
[42:47] i'm not sure whether i got the holy host
[42:49] or not
[42:50] but if god's called you that shows
[42:52] you're elected
[42:54] and if you're elected then you will
[42:56] receive the holy ghost
[42:58] you are ordained to
[43:01] satan can't prevent it
[43:07] friends there's i'm telling you this
[43:09] morning there is going to be a rapture
[43:16] i know that satan sometimes tries to
[43:18] work on people's minds especially in
[43:20] this day and time
[43:22] an era where we've got people that are
[43:24] turning their backs on the message and
[43:26] walking away from it
[43:27] and then satan comes and says well what
[43:29] do you think is this really real or not
[43:32] what if this is all just a big hoax and
[43:34] there ain't going to be anything and
[43:36] once you die you're dead
[43:38] no there's going to be a rapture and i'm
[43:41] going to tell you something none of
[43:42] satan's reasoning
[43:44] nothing satan can do is going to be able
[43:46] to stop it from happening
[43:48] [Applause]
[43:53] and satan can't stop you from getting
[43:55] the holy ghost
[43:59] if you're if you accepted the call
[44:02] friends
[44:03] you will the holy ghost is a promise to
[44:06] you
[44:08] it's a gift it isn't based on something
[44:12] that you do there's nothing you have to
[44:16] do
[44:17] to receive the holy ghost because it is
[44:20] a
[44:20] gift god gives it
[44:23] [Applause]
[44:25] all you got to do is accept the gift
[44:31] what is the one thing god asked us to do
[44:34] believe
[44:38] he asks us to believe
[44:45] abraham when god called him it wasn't on
[44:47] any merits that abraham had ever done
[44:50] it wasn't because abraham was a good man
[44:53] it wasn't because abraham wanted it
[44:56] right it wasn't because abraham was
[44:58] seeking after it
[45:00] it was because god chose abraham
[45:04] and god come down and talk to abraham
[45:06] and said i've chosen
[45:08] you out of all the people of the world
[45:13] i've chosen you to be the one
[45:16] to be the father of a nation
[45:20] [Applause]
[45:24] and by you and by your wife sarah
[45:28] her being past the age of 65 she's going
[45:31] to
[45:32] have a child it's going to be a boy
[45:35] and from there is where it's going to
[45:38] come my people
[45:40] i chose you to bring it to pass
[45:50] it isn't because you've done anything
[45:53] it's because of what god did
[45:58] you're not here by your merits god
[46:00] didn't look down and say
[46:01] i think they're a pretty good person
[46:03] i'll call on them god don't do things
[46:05] just
[46:06] fly off the handle
[46:09] i've been around people that just do
[46:11] things just just off the cuff
[46:13] you know they just they don't never make
[46:14] no plans for anything
[46:17] yes are you having a cookout for the
[46:19] fourth i don't know
[46:21] at the last minute they're running
[46:23] around trying to get stuff together to
[46:24] have a cookout
[46:26] god don't do things that way he knows
[46:28] the beginning from the end
[46:30] god has plans
[46:35] and he has plans for you listen to me
[46:39] it doesn't matter if you look and say
[46:41] well i i was trying to do this or that
[46:44] but i i feel like i
[46:45] failed and doing it god wanted you to
[46:48] fail because somehow
[46:50] he's going to bring glory to himself
[46:53] through your life
[46:59] so when it comes right down to it you
[47:00] ain't failed anything
[47:07] god wasn't surprised when moses killed
[47:09] the egyptian
[47:10] he didn't scratch his head and say oh
[47:12] man i got this guy already now look what
[47:14] he did
[47:16] now i might have to find somebody else
[47:19] no god knew that was going to happen
[47:22] before moses was ever even born
[47:25] and he knew that from that he was going
[47:27] to take moses out on the back side of
[47:29] the desert
[47:30] where he could get him off to himself
[47:32] and speak to him lift to ear
[47:39] friends he couldn't meet god down in
[47:42] egypt
[47:43] because that wasn't where god wanted to
[47:45] meet him at
[47:46] god wanted to meet him out there away
[47:48] from everybody
[47:50] away from everything he had to god
[47:53] wasn't going to meet him until moses
[47:54] looked around and said
[47:57] i'm a failure
[48:00] i thought i thought i had it all figured
[48:03] out how i was going to bring about this
[48:05] deliverance of god's people
[48:08] you know i had position in egypt and i
[48:10] thought maybe i could use my position
[48:13] and by that you know i was i was in line
[48:16] for the throne
[48:16] you know and thought maybe i could use
[48:19] that to get his
[48:20] people delivered that was moses thought
[48:23] but it wasn't god's thought
[48:31] moses fled into the desert at the age of
[48:33] 40.
[48:34] at the age of 80 god appeared to him and
[48:37] said
[48:38] pick this staff and go back and deliver
[48:40] my people
[48:43] an old man
[48:47] see when moses was 40 now some of you
[48:50] all know what i'm talking about
[48:52] when moses were 40 he had the strength
[48:55] of a warrior
[48:57] but at the age of 80 most had trouble
[49:01] kneeling down and getting back up
[49:07] it didn't look like that he was one that
[49:10] god would even use why would god use an
[49:12] old man
[49:14] but see god had chosen moses before he
[49:17] was ever even
[49:18] born and then he directed his mother and
[49:22] father on what to do to protect him
[49:25] from the devil trying to kill him
[49:28] god had his hand on moses all the time
[49:33] there was never a time in his life that
[49:36] god didn't have his hand on moses
[49:38] friends
[49:38] i don't care where you come from i don't
[49:41] care what you did
[49:42] i don't care what you did in your past i
[49:44] don't care if it was drugs
[49:46] alcohol or whatever it was god has
[49:49] always
[49:50] had his hand on you god had his hand on
[49:53] you
[49:53] for you to even be born
[50:02] when you maybe you were in uh
[50:05] some denomination or some under some
[50:08] creed god still had his hand
[50:09] on you
[50:14] and the whole time there was something
[50:16] that you felt you were lacking
[50:20] something you needed and
[50:23] many of you looked forward to many
[50:25] different ways on how to satisfy that
[50:29] look maybe some of you got children or
[50:33] loved ones that haven't received the
[50:36] lord
[50:37] look friends the elect come at the
[50:41] proper time
[50:43] god has his timing
[50:47] and and it doesn't work out with our
[50:52] timing
[50:56] it's like the song you were singing
[50:57] before i came out
[50:59] he might not come when you want him
[51:03] you know martha wanted him to come
[51:05] before her brother died
[51:07] but he didn't
[51:11] their lazarus had to die
[51:16] because god was going to get glory out
[51:18] of raising him back up
[51:22] but not only that he carried around
[51:24] until four days had passed and she said
[51:26] lord by now his body stinketh
[51:33] god didn't care about that that just
[51:36] showed more of god's glory
[51:39] that god was god could bring a stinking
[51:42] rotten corpse
[51:44] back to life
[51:53] i imagine he went from stinking to
[51:55] smelling like a rose within an instant
[52:08] you know it wasn't my choice to preach
[52:11] i didn't want to preach growing up
[52:16] i saw too much i'd watched my dad
[52:19] i'd watch people turn their backs on him
[52:21] i've seen how tough
[52:22] and how rough it was i've seen times
[52:25] when dad would go
[52:27] to preach one time he went and preached
[52:28] in mansfield
[52:31] and we were living over toward st mary's
[52:33] ohio and we had to travel right
[52:35] 30 you know and uh i don't know if any
[52:38] many of y'all traveled much on route 30
[52:40] but there ain't no lights
[52:44] it's country and here
[52:48] dad preached on faith
[52:51] and buddy we had to live faith before we
[52:53] got home
[52:58] i don't know if i've told you a story or
[52:59] not but you're going to hear it again
[53:06] we got we got out on route 30 where
[53:08] there was no lights and there was no
[53:09] houses and there was nothing
[53:12] and the car the lights went out and the
[53:14] car just quit running
[53:17] it was a 1971 ford ltd
[53:22] and dad got out he didn't know what to
[53:25] do
[53:26] all of a sudden this farmer came out of
[53:28] nowhere
[53:30] driving a pickup truck and pulled off in
[53:32] front of us
[53:33] and he said uh
[53:36] what's going on he says he just quit he
[53:38] said well
[53:39] he said he got out his flashlight and he
[53:41] shot it in there he said
[53:42] go in there and try to start it up again
[53:45] dad went in there and
[53:47] turned to ignition when he did it fired
[53:49] up the lights came back
[53:50] on and everything and dad got out to
[53:52] think the man said what'd you do he said
[53:53] i just shined the light in there
[54:04] but this is the you know how paul harvey
[54:06] would say the rest of the story
[54:09] the rest of the story was me and my mom
[54:11] and my grandmother were sitting in the
[54:13] car praying god somehow
[54:15] get this car going again
[54:24] that wasn't the end of the testimony
[54:28] dad got back home and took the car to a
[54:30] a mechanic that he always took his old
[54:32] cars to
[54:34] and this mechanic said now what did you
[54:36] say you did he said it just started back
[54:39] up and he ran he said it's impossible
[54:40] for it to run said
[54:41] i don't i don't know much about cars but
[54:43] i don't know if it's the alternator or
[54:44] something wasn't even working no more
[54:48] and he said i don't know how you had
[54:49] lights i don't know how you ran the car
[54:51] you know
[54:54] well it was on glory power
[54:57] [Applause]
[55:04] i didn't choose to preach i
[55:07] people would ask me if i was going to
[55:08] preach be like my dad i said
[55:10] no i don't want to preach you know
[55:13] and mom had worked with me and
[55:17] taught me uh how to sing along with
[55:19] piano you know
[55:21] and so i when dad would go somewhere i'd
[55:23] sing
[55:24] and so when i got older i told people no
[55:27] that's all i'm gonna do just testify and
[55:28] sing
[55:30] you know that's easy
[55:34] somebody asked are you are you you feel
[55:36] like you're ever gonna be preacher no
[55:38] not me and then god called me
[55:43] when i was uh when meena and i were
[55:47] engaged
[55:48] getting ready to be married i told her i
[55:50] said i'll never be a preacher
[55:54] and then god called me
[55:57] and then i told her i said she said you
[56:00] said
[56:01] you would never be a preacher i said i
[56:04] know it but i promise you i'll never be
[56:06] a pastor
[56:07] [Laughter]
[56:13] it's like brother branham said woe be
[56:15] unto me if i don't do it
[56:20] you realize you don't get to be what you
[56:23] want to be
[56:26] you get to be all you can be
[56:34] you don't get to pick what you're going
[56:36] to be
[56:38] you think you're getting to pick god
[56:40] already knew
[56:41] everything about it
[56:44] you say well i'm going to college for
[56:45] this or this or this
[56:48] look i've got my oldest son has went to
[56:51] college for about three or four
[56:52] different things before he ever landed
[56:54] on the thing that what he was supposed
[56:55] to be
[57:05] god knows what he wants you to be
[57:10] it's not what you want to be it's what
[57:11] god makes you
[57:15] you are what you are what you are
[57:17] because god chose you to be that
[57:22] i know some young people like i just
[57:24] mentioned you you might be looking
[57:26] still yet to say what am i going to be
[57:28] don't worry about it
[57:31] do all you do all that's in your natural
[57:34] possibilities to do
[57:37] and then put the rest on god
[57:44] he'll guide you
[57:48] friends i went to college i don't do a
[57:51] thing of what i went to college for i
[57:53] forgot most of the stuff that i ever
[57:55] learned
[58:00] i i remember more about english and
[58:03] and math than i do the stuff that i was
[58:05] supposed to learn
[58:08] that's because i use english
[58:16] you know but
[58:19] god had me go through that for a reason
[58:24] through all that it was character
[58:34] building
[58:38] so you got to be what god chose you to
[58:40] be he called us and chose us before the
[58:42] foundation of the world
[58:44] so we're putting this back not just back
[58:48] before you were born
[58:50] we're putting this back before anybody
[58:52] was born
[58:54] god chose you
[58:59] amen well i got something i just keep
[59:02] hanging onto and it keeps wanting to
[59:04] come out and i keep on just to hold back
[59:05] on it a little bit
[59:09] when he spoke jesus name he spoke your
[59:13] [Applause]
[59:16] name
[59:21] hallelujah god knows you by name
[59:28] i was just listening to a message this
[59:30] morning brother brown was given the
[59:32] illustration about
[59:33] zacchaeus how zacchaeus was climbed up
[59:37] in this tree you know
[59:38] where he could see because he was small
[59:40] of stature
[59:41] and he wanted to see jesus over top of
[59:44] the people when jesus came by
[59:46] jesus not only pointed him out in the
[59:48] tree but jesus knew his name
[59:53] is it zacchaeus come down out of that
[59:55] tree i'm going home to eat with you
[59:58] today
[1:00:02] he knows your name
[1:00:06] nathanael comes before jesus he said
[1:00:09] behold an israelite and whom there's no
[1:00:11] god he said
[1:00:12] rabbi when did you know me he said
[1:00:14] before philip ever called you under the
[1:00:15] tree
[1:00:16] i saw you
[1:00:22] there's nothing that you've done that's
[1:00:26] ever surprised god
[1:00:31] any wrong or evil you did before you
[1:00:33] came to the lord none of that surprised
[1:00:36] him
[1:00:37] he knew but friends
[1:00:40] that wasn't you that was that old nature
[1:00:42] [Applause]
[1:00:44] that was that old man see
[1:00:47] a lot of times we look at somebody's old
[1:00:50] man to decide whether
[1:00:52] we think they're going to be a christian
[1:00:53] or not but that ain't what god does
[1:00:55] because he knows that old man's going to
[1:00:57] die
[1:01:00] and there's going to be a new birth
[1:01:05] that's how you're born again
[1:01:16] i've got a little granddaughter she's so
[1:01:19] curious
[1:01:20] name is rose she asked her mom about why
[1:01:22] does this happen and why
[1:01:24] does that happen and why is this and
[1:01:26] that
[1:01:27] and how do we know that there's a god
[1:01:31] and things and uh her mother was kind of
[1:01:36] talking about it you know saying boy
[1:01:37] this is really some questions i got to
[1:01:39] answer
[1:01:39] for her you know and jessica spoke up
[1:01:42] you know michael's mom she said yeah
[1:01:44] try answering the question of how do you
[1:01:46] get the holy ghost
[1:01:50] what is the holy ghost how do you get
[1:01:53] born again
[1:01:54] another time
[1:01:59] that's michael's questions
[1:02:06] jessica answers him best he can then she
[1:02:07] says go talk to your papa
[1:02:09] [Laughter]
[1:02:18] he redeemed us when we were unworthy to
[1:02:21] be redeemed
[1:02:23] friends we have not yet even begun
[1:02:27] to thank him enough for redeeming us
[1:02:38] you you think about when when this all
[1:02:41] does end
[1:02:44] and and we're in that
[1:02:48] 45-day window you know when the dead in
[1:02:52] christ rise
[1:02:54] and then we are changed
[1:02:58] i i don't know what you see or how you
[1:03:01] believe it
[1:03:03] but i believe when we're changed the
[1:03:06] rest of the world won't even be able to
[1:03:07] see us
[1:03:09] he said now how can that be jesus walked
[1:03:13] right through the midst of people was
[1:03:14] going to throw him off a cliff he walked
[1:03:15] right through their mess and they never
[1:03:17] even seen him
[1:03:23] but you when we get into that window
[1:03:26] friends look
[1:03:30] you're you're only you i don't even
[1:03:33] think we've begun to realize just what
[1:03:35] all god has really done for us
[1:03:40] i mean we to the best of our mental
[1:03:43] ability
[1:03:44] realize what god's done but it's even
[1:03:47] beyond that
[1:03:56] the bible says that the purpose of god
[1:04:00] according to election might stand
[1:04:03] that he chose jacob before they were
[1:04:05] born
[1:04:07] election you know
[1:04:10] rightly the birthright belonged to esau
[1:04:14] he was born first it was his by right
[1:04:20] but god didn't look at that
[1:04:24] god knew before they were ever even born
[1:04:27] that that birthright wasn't going to
[1:04:28] mean nothing to esau
[1:04:33] but he knew that jacob would want that
[1:04:35] birthright
[1:04:36] and would seek after and do everything
[1:04:38] he could anything he could
[1:04:40] to get it
[1:04:55] it's by foreknowledge let me read you
[1:04:57] this god know the end from the beginning
[1:04:59] therefore he could plan
[1:05:00] everything that would work out just to
[1:05:04] his glory
[1:05:06] that gives us courage to know no matter
[1:05:08] what comes or goes
[1:05:09] god is making everything work
[1:05:13] for your good
[1:05:22] the clock is ticking just exactly on
[1:05:25] time
[1:05:26] sometimes we get weary upset
[1:05:30] we get hastily we think oh i must do
[1:05:34] this or that but remember
[1:05:35] god's clock will be just exactly on time
[1:05:39] all these things has to be this way it
[1:05:43] has to all be done according to his
[1:05:45] great knowledge
[1:05:46] his foreknowledge for by foreknowledge
[1:05:49] he could predestinate
[1:05:50] not by his desire
[1:05:55] but by foreknowledge he knew who would
[1:05:57] accept it and who would not
[1:06:00] therefore he could make everything work
[1:06:02] according to his big
[1:06:03] time clock that's ticking away for he
[1:06:06] could foretell the end from the
[1:06:07] beginning
[1:06:10] he knew that we would live in this day
[1:06:14] he knew this would be our day and he had
[1:06:18] plans for our day
[1:06:21] god's got a purpose for you
[1:06:29] jack cole you know he preached faith
[1:06:33] and had a healing ministry and
[1:06:36] uh then he died i forget from what
[1:06:41] disease it was it struck him down and he
[1:06:42] died from it and there was many people
[1:06:44] that time were saying well that's
[1:06:47] because jack got off the
[1:06:48] got off of the you know the the path he
[1:06:52] kind of got out of the will of god and
[1:06:53] that's why god took it
[1:06:56] brother brown spoke up and he about that
[1:06:58] and he said
[1:07:00] that's not the way it is at all he said
[1:07:03] death can't take you to the purpose god
[1:07:05] sent you here for has been served
[1:07:09] and he said god
[1:07:13] didn't take jack cole until the purpose
[1:07:15] he sent jack hole here for
[1:07:18] had been served and once he had
[1:07:20] fulfilled that purpose
[1:07:22] then god said all right now it's my time
[1:07:23] to take you on home
[1:07:26] you there's a purpose for you to be here
[1:07:32] you think well my purpose was to get
[1:07:34] married and have children and
[1:07:35] you know have a family and all this you
[1:07:37] know
[1:07:40] god's got a purpose that goes beyond
[1:07:42] even all that
[1:07:50] don't worry his plans never fail
[1:07:58] foreknowledge brotherham said by
[1:08:01] foreknowledge god set in the church
[1:08:03] apostles prophets evangelists teachers
[1:08:05] pastors
[1:08:07] by foreknowledge god set them in he knew
[1:08:09] every one of them before the world began
[1:08:12] right
[1:08:21] he knew as roman h tells us that he
[1:08:24] hated esau and loved jacob before either
[1:08:26] boy was born
[1:08:28] for his foreknowledge allows him to
[1:08:30] predestinate all things to work together
[1:08:32] to his glory
[1:08:33] that's the great jehovah it isn't him
[1:08:36] that willeth or him that runneth it's
[1:08:37] god that showeth mercy
[1:08:39] you know what the scripture says so it
[1:08:42] isn't how much you try it's how much god
[1:08:44] has done for you
[1:08:47] now listen to this if you've got enough
[1:08:50] of god
[1:08:51] to come out here today a desire to come
[1:08:54] hear the message you ought to be the
[1:08:56] happiest person
[1:08:57] in the city
[1:09:03] why because that shows who you are
[1:09:14] and it shows because god is moving in
[1:09:17] your life
[1:09:18] trying to lead you to the fountain it
[1:09:20] shows he loves you
[1:09:24] that you've got the desire to come and
[1:09:26] hear it
[1:09:27] shows god loves you
[1:09:30] shows god's movement in your life it
[1:09:32] identifies who you are
[1:09:37] you know i think of in the bible where
[1:09:39] jesus says
[1:09:40] when they begin to speak evil of you
[1:09:42] cast your name out as evil and
[1:09:44] you know tell lies on you and all this
[1:09:46] stuff he said
[1:09:47] rejoice leap for joy
[1:09:52] for so did they the prophets
[1:09:55] so it shows what side you're on
[1:09:58] shows your identification it's not
[1:10:02] easy to be happy when people are abusing
[1:10:04] you
[1:10:06] when people are telling lies on you it's
[1:10:08] not easy
[1:10:09] and the natural man would like to go out
[1:10:11] there and straighten all that out
[1:10:15] so nobody would be believing any of that
[1:10:17] stuff
[1:10:19] but you can't do it just let it alone
[1:10:23] both parts of that scripture has got to
[1:10:24] be fulfilled and somebody's got to
[1:10:26] fulfill them
[1:10:37] by foreknowledge god predestinated
[1:10:41] not god god was not willing that any
[1:10:44] would perish
[1:10:47] but by foreknowledge he knew who would
[1:10:50] and who wouldn't
[1:10:52] he knew who would choose and who
[1:10:54] wouldn't choose
[1:10:58] it was his foreknowledge that let him
[1:11:01] know that jacob would have respect
[1:11:03] for the birthright
[1:11:07] brother branham says here he says god
[1:11:09] knew by foreknowledge
[1:11:11] who would be saved so he sent
[1:11:14] jesus to catch those who he foresaw
[1:11:18] would be saved
[1:11:22] now all was given the opportunity look
[1:11:25] and live
[1:11:30] but god knows who would
[1:11:38] but it goes even deeper than just that
[1:11:43] in the bible if you'll read in
[1:11:47] the beginning there of genesis i'm not
[1:11:50] going to turn to it i'm just going to
[1:11:51] tell you about it
[1:11:54] you'll find they go through the lineage
[1:11:56] and start saying who
[1:11:57] came after seth and this one named that
[1:12:00] and that
[1:12:01] name this and then it starts talking
[1:12:02] about esau or not so but cain's side
[1:12:05] and it starts saying you know the cain
[1:12:06] begot this one and that one got this one
[1:12:08] and this one begotten that one
[1:12:10] and if you go through there and look up
[1:12:12] the meanings of their names
[1:12:13] after a while there was one named i
[1:12:15] can't remember his name right now but
[1:12:17] he his name meant who is of god
[1:12:22] so you see satan he don't even know
[1:12:26] who's his
[1:12:32] he don't know who belongs to god
[1:12:37] so when he comes and tries to tell you
[1:12:39] you ain't one of them
[1:12:40] how would you know you don't know
[1:12:53] you see god knows his children
[1:13:02] god knew who you were going to be
[1:13:05] what color hair you would have what
[1:13:07] color eyes you would have
[1:13:08] how tall you would be he he knew
[1:13:12] everything about you
[1:13:20] i think about what a rascal i was before
[1:13:23] god really got a hold of me
[1:13:25] and then i think about that song when he
[1:13:27] was on the cross i was on his mind and
[1:13:29] it says
[1:13:30] he knew me yet he loved me
[1:13:36] he loved in other words he loved me in
[1:13:38] spite of all that
[1:13:40] because you know why i belong to it
[1:13:47] when your child does something wrong you
[1:13:49] don't disown him
[1:13:52] when she does something that that's not
[1:13:55] right or you didn't prove up you don't
[1:13:56] disown her
[1:13:58] you correct her that's what god does
[1:14:02] with his children brother mam said it's
[1:14:06] like this he says when a little one
[1:14:07] falls down you know learning to walk
[1:14:10] he said you don't pick him up and spank
[1:14:11] him because they fell down trying to
[1:14:13] learn to walk
[1:14:14] he said you pick him up and say now come
[1:14:16] on i walk this way
[1:14:19] he said that's how god does us papa god
[1:14:22] he'll pick us up and say now walk this
[1:14:24] way child
[1:14:27] [Applause]
[1:14:30] we get to go in the wrong direction oh
[1:14:32] turn back around here now
[1:14:39] my dad had this thing i i i can't do it
[1:14:42] like him but my dad had this thing about
[1:14:44] snapping his finger and
[1:14:45] i tell you he could stop you in your
[1:14:54] tracks romans 9
[1:14:57] verse 15 says for he
[1:15:00] saith to moses i will have mercy on whom
[1:15:03] i'll have mercy
[1:15:05] and i will have compassion on whom i
[1:15:07] will have compassion
[1:15:09] so then it is not him that willeth nor
[1:15:11] him that runeth
[1:15:12] but god that showeth mercy for the
[1:15:15] scripture
[1:15:16] saith unto pharaoh even for this same
[1:15:18] purpose
[1:15:19] have i raised thee up that i might shoe
[1:15:23] my
[1:15:24] power in thee that my name might be
[1:15:26] declared throughout
[1:15:27] all the earth therefore have he mercy on
[1:15:31] whom he will have mercy
[1:15:33] and on whom he will he hardeneth
[1:15:41] it isn't god looking
[1:15:44] at the marriage and saying i don't think
[1:15:46] much of pharaoh so i'm going to use him
[1:15:48] for this over here
[1:15:49] no god looked down and said he don't
[1:15:51] belong to me
[1:15:53] he's not one of my children but i know
[1:15:56] there is a doctor for destination out
[1:15:58] there brother branham said it's rotten
[1:16:01] but predestination is in the bible
[1:16:07] and i would like for somebody to explain
[1:16:09] to me how the infinite god
[1:16:11] could not know who was his and who
[1:16:13] wasn't
[1:16:15] right the god that knows all things how
[1:16:18] would he not know who belongs to him
[1:16:36] the bible says that
[1:16:39] saul while he was yet breathing out
[1:16:42] threatenings against the church of god
[1:16:46] that jesus appeared to him
[1:16:50] on the road in a bright light
[1:16:55] while he was while saul was intent
[1:16:58] on carrying out to come down there
[1:17:02] to damascus and to to bind those people
[1:17:06] that worship the name of jesus christ
[1:17:09] while he was on the way down there to do
[1:17:11] that that's when god chose to call him
[1:17:16] see it was god's timing
[1:17:21] but saul knew enough about god to know
[1:17:26] that that was something supernatural
[1:17:30] and he said lord who are you
[1:17:34] he said i'm jesus whom thou persecuted
[1:17:36] it is hard to kick against the prick
[1:17:44] a prick was a rod
[1:17:47] that they had that had a point on the
[1:17:50] end of it
[1:17:52] and the oxen or whatever was pulling the
[1:17:56] the cart they could prick it with that
[1:17:59] it didn't matter how much it kicked it
[1:18:02] was hard to kick against that they won't
[1:18:03] have to move
[1:18:05] and that's what god was telling saul
[1:18:10] you're going to do what i want you to do
[1:18:12] not what you want to do
[1:18:14] you're not going to be who you thought
[1:18:15] you were going to be you're going to be
[1:18:16] who i chose you to be
[1:18:19] and then god appeared you know he he was
[1:18:22] blind for three days
[1:18:23] and god appears to ananias and tells him
[1:18:26] hey
[1:18:27] saul of tarsus is down here and he's
[1:18:29] blind and i want you to go down there
[1:18:31] and lay hands on him
[1:18:32] and give him back his sight and adam and
[1:18:35] i said now
[1:18:36] isn't he the same one lord that i've
[1:18:38] heard about
[1:18:40] that has been persecuting the people
[1:18:42] that worship you
[1:18:45] he said yes but he's a chosen vessel
[1:18:48] unto me i chose him to proclaim my name
[1:18:53] before the gentiles
[1:18:54] [Applause]
[1:19:00] [Music]
[1:19:03] and the bible says after that
[1:19:06] he went down there prayed for
[1:19:10] saul and told him to receive the holy
[1:19:12] ghost
[1:19:13] he was baptized and immediately went
[1:19:16] preaching about jesus christ
[1:19:24] wait a minute wait a minute now saw
[1:19:26] before you start preaching this message
[1:19:28] you're going to sit down and learn a
[1:19:29] little bit about it
[1:19:32] you're new to it you weren't in his
[1:19:34] meetings
[1:19:35] [Music]
[1:19:42] paul said i received this from the lord
[1:19:46] it didn't come from man it come from
[1:19:50] god
[1:19:54] i'll tell you something ain't nobody can
[1:19:56] teach you how to preach
[1:19:58] and i know not everybody preaches every
[1:20:00] man don't preach the same way
[1:20:03] and the thing is you can't help how you
[1:20:07] preach
[1:20:08] you just have to preach the way god
[1:20:09] gives it to you
[1:20:11] just be who god made you to be
[1:20:15] and he made us all different and
[1:20:18] sometimes we approach things a little
[1:20:20] different ways
[1:20:22] but it's just to get you to see the big
[1:20:30] picture
[1:20:34] colossians
[1:20:37] 1 21 and 22
[1:20:41] now paul was the
[1:20:45] enemy of god's people he did not look
[1:20:48] like
[1:20:48] somebody that would be chosen to preach
[1:20:51] the name of jesus christ
[1:20:54] but god turned him from an enemy of the
[1:20:56] people to a defender of the truth
[1:21:02] and you that were sometimes alienated
[1:21:05] and enemies
[1:21:06] in your mind by wicked works yet now
[1:21:09] hath he reconciled
[1:21:11] in the body of his flesh through death
[1:21:14] to present you holy and unblameable
[1:21:16] and unreprovable in his sight
[1:21:21] this is what he has for you to be
[1:21:25] you're to be holy said how am i going to
[1:21:27] be holy
[1:21:28] you will be holy because he
[1:21:32] has desired for you to be holy that's
[1:21:35] what he
[1:21:35] made you you're not holy because of
[1:21:38] anything you do you're holy because he's
[1:21:40] holy you're accepted because he was
[1:21:43] accepted
[1:21:45] you're righteous because he was
[1:21:47] righteous you're
[1:21:48] unbelievable because there was no fault
[1:21:52] found in him
[1:21:59] the anointed word of this day of which
[1:22:03] you are apart by predestination
[1:22:06] you immediately like knew when you heard
[1:22:08] that you knew right quick you
[1:22:10] was an eagle you realized that you
[1:22:13] wasn't a denominational chicken to begin
[1:22:15] with
[1:22:16] you know there was something wrong there
[1:22:17] there was something wrong that's right
[1:22:19] you know
[1:22:20] that you were trapped into it at the
[1:22:21] beginning
[1:22:23] he the bridegroom took away your shame
[1:22:26] and put it in the sea
[1:22:27] of forgetfulness
[1:22:31] that's how you stand unblameable
[1:22:34] before god he made you that
[1:22:39] because he took away your shame and put
[1:22:40] it in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:22:46] you are standing completely justified
[1:22:50] as though you never did it in the
[1:22:52] beginning
[1:22:54] you're standing if you're standing on
[1:22:57] god's word
[1:22:57] with god's word every amen every jot
[1:23:00] every tittle
[1:23:01] where are you standing i'm trying to
[1:23:04] tell you pull away from them
[1:23:06] shucks and get out here in the wheat
[1:23:08] where you can get right before the sun
[1:23:11] i hear the coming of the combine you're
[1:23:14] standing complete
[1:23:15] justified like you never did it at the
[1:23:18] first place
[1:23:19] hallelujah talk about a thanksgiving i
[1:23:21] feel real good
[1:23:23] i'm more thankful for that than anything
[1:23:25] i know of
[1:23:27] you are the pure virtuous
[1:23:30] sinless bride of the son of the living
[1:23:34] god every man and every woman that's
[1:23:37] born of the spirit of god
[1:23:39] and washed in the blood of jesus and
[1:23:41] believes
[1:23:42] every word stands as though they never
[1:23:45] sinned at the first place
[1:23:48] [Applause]
[1:23:49] so you know where you're standing you're
[1:23:52] knowing who you are
[1:23:56] my goodness i think i've caught my
[1:23:58] brother's spirit
[1:24:06] i thought i'd be done before now
[1:24:15] if you were condemned to die
[1:24:18] and a man took your place then you could
[1:24:21] not die for that sin because somebody
[1:24:24] took your place
[1:24:26] and you can't die for the sins that were
[1:24:30] committed because somebody else
[1:24:32] took your place he took your sin
[1:24:36] upon him he became sin
[1:24:39] that you might become him
[1:24:44] he took on our unrighteousness so we
[1:24:48] could take on his righteousness
[1:24:51] he took our place so we can't die for
[1:24:55] that because
[1:24:56] he took our place
[1:24:57] [Applause]
[1:25:02] brother says here all the spiritual
[1:25:04] union of christ in his church now
[1:25:07] when the flesh is becoming word notices
[1:25:10] when the flesh is becoming word and the
[1:25:12] word
[1:25:13] is becoming flesh
[1:25:17] your flesh is becoming word
[1:25:20] and the word is becoming flesh in you
[1:25:28] manifested vindicated just what the
[1:25:30] bible said would happen in this day it's
[1:25:32] happening day by day
[1:25:35] it's culminating so fast see
[1:25:39] we're nearing the coming of jesus to be
[1:25:41] united with his church
[1:25:42] where the word becomes the word
[1:25:47] the holy ghost is searching the hearts
[1:25:55] you never came in i never came in by my
[1:25:58] own will
[1:26:01] it was god that chose me so it's his
[1:26:04] responsibility to take care of me
[1:26:09] it's his responsibility to provide for
[1:26:11] my needs
[1:26:19] i know i can get in trouble for this
[1:26:21] statement with this day being the day of
[1:26:22] women's rights and all this but i don't
[1:26:24] mean anything bad by it
[1:26:26] i don't mean to degrade anybody in any
[1:26:27] way but when
[1:26:30] a man and a woman gets married that man
[1:26:33] is taking on the responsibility to care
[1:26:35] for her
[1:26:36] and he's taking on the responsibility
[1:26:38] once they have children to care for that
[1:26:40] family
[1:26:42] when christ took you as his bride he
[1:26:45] took on the responsibility to take care
[1:26:47] of you
[1:26:50] [Applause]
[1:26:54] not only to make sure you got food on
[1:26:55] your table but to make sure you got food
[1:26:57] on your table
[1:27:04] god doesn't want you to be frowning
[1:27:08] he don't want you to be sad he don't
[1:27:10] want you to be depressed
[1:27:13] he wants you to be happy he made you to
[1:27:17] be happy
[1:27:20] brother branham said that that uh
[1:27:24] sadness and and worry and all these
[1:27:27] things could cause cancer
[1:27:29] what is happiness calls
[1:27:34] there are so many scriptures in the
[1:27:36] bible that talk about being happy
[1:27:38] clapping your hands praising the lord
[1:27:41] making a joyful sound
[1:27:47] there are so many scriptures about being
[1:27:49] happy
[1:27:51] being glad
[1:28:01] sometimes we get our focus on the world
[1:28:04] and the things around us
[1:28:06] you know sort of like peter did when he
[1:28:08] walked on the water
[1:28:13] but he still walked on the water
[1:28:21] don't get your focus on these things you
[1:28:24] might
[1:28:24] look if you're going through a valley
[1:28:27] you're going through a trial
[1:28:29] don't get your focus on it get your
[1:28:32] focus on him
[1:28:33] get your focus on what he has done for
[1:28:36] you
[1:28:38] if you can get your focus on that
[1:28:40] instead of on the trial
[1:28:41] you'll be happy
[1:28:53] brother branham talks about the spirit
[1:28:56] of esau
[1:28:56] still being here and he said
[1:29:00] just like the birthright was rightly
[1:29:02] esau's
[1:29:04] he said the it was rightly the church
[1:29:07] belonged to the church but they despised
[1:29:10] it
[1:29:14] they didn't want to get down on their
[1:29:15] knees and cry and plead before god and
[1:29:18] they didn't want to get filled with the
[1:29:19] holy ghost and they
[1:29:21] instead they despised it and called them
[1:29:22] a bunch of holy rollers
[1:29:27] he said it's because that's their nature
[1:29:30] that's why they've done that
[1:29:33] the crow and the dove the dove
[1:29:39] craves this word because that's what
[1:29:42] she is
[1:29:46] and the crow despises it because he
[1:29:49] wasn't
[1:29:50] born to receive it
[1:29:56] but that dove you couldn't keep him away
[1:29:58] from it
[1:30:00] it's because the election of god
[1:30:04] it's because you're born to be
[1:30:08] a spiritual man a spiritual woman
[1:30:12] i i'm not talking about the new birth
[1:30:14] yet i'm talking about your natural birth
[1:30:17] in your natural birth you were born to
[1:30:19] be a spiritual man and a spiritual woman
[1:30:25] you become that by your second birth
[1:30:35] you know there's some that
[1:30:38] they could hear this message hear this
[1:30:40] word and it goes right off them like
[1:30:42] water off a duck's back
[1:30:46] i don't know you know maybe you've heard
[1:30:48] that expression over and over and over
[1:30:50] again but i've raised some ducks
[1:30:53] and i've i've come to realize that all
[1:30:55] these expressions they say about ducks
[1:30:57] like this is duck weather and different
[1:30:59] things like that
[1:31:00] all that stuff is cause somebody was
[1:31:01] watching the duck
[1:31:06] and when they made this the the the
[1:31:07] phrase up like water off a duck's back
[1:31:09] it's cause somebody was watching the
[1:31:11] duck
[1:31:14] and a duck just ruffles his feather and
[1:31:16] looks as dry as can be
[1:31:18] they can plunge under the water come
[1:31:20] back up and still look as dry as can be
[1:31:23] because they're a duck and that's
[1:31:26] that's the way it is with some folks
[1:31:29] there's no
[1:31:30] penetration
[1:31:33] they don't absorb it they can't become
[1:31:37] one with it they can't eat it
[1:31:42] just like you you couldn't take carrying
[1:31:46] out
[1:31:46] and feed it to a chicken
[1:31:52] but an eagle can eat it he can eat the
[1:31:55] fresh meat
[1:32:09] people become so calloused with their
[1:32:11] religion
[1:32:13] the things of this world their own
[1:32:15] ideals
[1:32:19] friends they could sit right here with
[1:32:21] you and they wouldn't do a thing to them
[1:32:25] because they weren't born for
[1:32:30] now i know some people that don't
[1:32:32] believe in predestination
[1:32:34] that way they think well how that would
[1:32:36] be god being cruel how could god
[1:32:38] it's like god not giving them a chance
[1:32:39] oh no he gives them a chance
[1:32:43] if they were sitting in here this
[1:32:44] morning that would be their chance
[1:32:52] but it's because of who you are is why
[1:32:54] you hear it the way you hear it
[1:32:56] and why you absorb it and take it in
[1:33:01] it's because of who you are why you can
[1:33:03] take the book and eat it
[1:33:10] god knew everything you and i would do
[1:33:12] but the thing is he chose us
[1:33:14] first before we done anything
[1:33:18] because he first loved us
[1:33:22] we didn't love him first he loved us
[1:33:24] first
[1:33:31] you can't help but make it friends you
[1:33:33] can't help but make the rapture because
[1:33:35] you
[1:33:35] are preordained to make it
[1:33:39] you're predestinated to make it you know
[1:33:41] what the word predestinated when you
[1:33:42] break it down
[1:33:43] it comes down to destiny
[1:33:47] your destination
[1:33:50] it's already been determined you have a
[1:33:53] ticket in hand
[1:33:54] that says i've got a flight to glory
[1:34:05] and you can there's nothing satan can do
[1:34:07] to prevent you from going
[1:34:16] you had the word in you
[1:34:19] you were born with a seed of god in you
[1:34:22] you don't get it in you by some man
[1:34:24] putting it there
[1:34:26] you didn't get it in you the prophet
[1:34:28] didn't put it there
[1:34:30] you were born with it and because you
[1:34:32] had it
[1:34:34] is why you could receive this
[1:34:39] because that's who you were that's
[1:34:43] who the real you is
[1:34:47] listen to this and i'm going to close
[1:34:51] there is only one out of a million that
[1:34:54] is going to live did you ever think of
[1:34:56] that
[1:34:58] there are the germ and and the egg in
[1:35:01] both them
[1:35:02] but there's only one going to live and
[1:35:05] that's not determined by the one that
[1:35:07] beats
[1:35:07] there first because sometimes the egg
[1:35:10] will back
[1:35:12] way back in the back and the germ might
[1:35:14] be up
[1:35:15] in the middle of the sperm and they'll
[1:35:16] crawl over one another
[1:35:18] it takes an intelligence to know whether
[1:35:22] it's going to be a boy or a girl
[1:35:24] red-headed black-headed or what more
[1:35:27] it's
[1:35:28] the election of god it can't be nothing
[1:35:30] else
[1:35:31] election even the natural birth
[1:35:34] is election whether it's going to be a
[1:35:37] boy or girl
[1:35:38] whatever it's going to be and when that
[1:35:40] little germ wiggles into this little egg
[1:35:43] and the tail drops off and it starts the
[1:35:45] baby's spine whatever
[1:35:46] after you know the baby and the rest of
[1:35:49] those million germs and me and eggs
[1:35:51] a million germs only one lives all the
[1:35:54] same but god
[1:35:55] chose by election which one was going to
[1:35:58] live
[1:35:59] and the rest of them perish one out of a
[1:36:02] million
[1:36:06] [Applause]
[1:36:07] so even in your natural birth you're one
[1:36:10] out of a million
[1:36:14] you're special in god's sight you're
[1:36:18] special
[1:36:20] and in your spiritual birth you're one
[1:36:22] out of a million
[1:36:24] [Applause]
[1:36:28] god ordained you naturally to be born
[1:36:32] and he ordains you to be born again by
[1:36:35] the spirit
[1:36:36] of god
[1:36:41] none of this is left up to chance
[1:36:47] it's all in a plan
[1:36:52] everything of your life fits in god's
[1:36:55] plan
[1:36:57] let's stand
