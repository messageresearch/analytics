speak to us tonight in a very personal way amen we are so thankful to god for his mercy amen in this in his grace and this hour we're living in amen it becomes more and more real to us it's a great it's a great precious reality to have the peace of god it's a peace that passes all understanding amen it's a piece that's not based on facts it's a piece that's based on divine revelation amen because facts do not produce faith but revelation brings real faith amen so we we thank god for the peace of god within this hour there's a settlement in our hearts amen we know who we are we know in whom we believed and we're persuaded that he is able to keep that which we have committed against that day and if you don't have that tonight you can have it it's for you amen we just just want to invite you to the word of the lord so appreciated being able to uh brother brian i appreciate each one of the song leaders and uh brother brian has just been a little while since he had been able to be able to stand up here but i think he did a good job hallelujah i'm just just really just thankful how the lord has just touched brother brian and uh just different ones that uh spoke to and we want to just continue to keep different ones in prayer just spoke with sister miranda here today and i told her last week on the phone i said you sound like sister hannah to me you know it was like when i first heard brother bill you know and over the weeks and over the days and talking to him and then you finally you hear me say that sounds like brother bill or that sounds like sister hannah you know and it's wonderful to hear it's wonderful to hear that and god has testimonies throughout all of this time amen god knew the situations and the conditions within this time that god is faithful amen to he's seeing us through all of these things and i'll tell you it's for the world it's a very gloomy hour but for the bride of jesus christ i tell you it's a wonderful time uh just the amount of things that i know from in my heart personally and the life and just seeing the things over the past year has just been wonderful the things that god is just opening in his word and the things god how he's just moving right here in our midst even during the midst of this whole whatever you call it that this is taking place and things that's been moving around in the midst of it all god's still saving souls god's still healing the sick devils are still being cast out amen lives are still being set free god is still god amen and we're just we're just thankful to to witness that and that is just it's so precious to us in the midst of this time i got to dwelling on some things even here was in prayer today i just thought of that how that in the midst of of goshen when there was a darkness that struck over the land of egypt but yet the bible says that they had light in their dwellings in goshen you see it was a light this was we're not talking about a candle light they had shekinah glory the word of that hour had brought light into their dwelling just like as we this place would be lit right here today it was a type of you and i being in this hour where darkness is all around a darkness that can be felt but yet in the midst of it there is light that has come to our dwellings oh thanks be to god for his mercy don't you love him i tell you you feel like brother branham says and does god change his mind he says when you see that that god has revealed these things to you and for what he's done in your life he said it makes you want to go over in a corner and just cry and you for what he's done amen well i could talk to you all night long i'm not going to preach on that but we want to just look into the word of the lord here tonight and just ask that god will just take control thank the musicians amen then for all of their work and the yielding let's just go to the lord in a word of prayer if you'd like to stand just for a moment we'll just offer a word of prayer and go right into the scriptures and then we'll just move forward into the message here this evening heavenly father lord as we just come to you this evening lord how precious it is that dear god that we can come and dwell together dear god is the writer of the song lord by divine inspiration oh god would record that of how pleasant it is lord for brethren to dwell together in unity oh god as he described it as that anointing oil that was poured out upon aaron and it ran down oh god through his upon his head through his beard lord upon the clothes it ran down to every part of his garment the body oh god was anointed lord and it flowed from the head oh god all the way down lord we're thankful god to be in unity and and lord we realize that even the admonition of the holy spirit that would speak to our hearts to endeavor to keep the unity lord so we realize there's a charge there's a responsibility that even that you have given us lord we know that in ourselves that lord that we alone can't do it but we can yield to you and you're the one who brings a real unity lord so we just ask o god here tonight that even as we come together lord they gathered in the upper room and the bible says lord that they were in one mind and one accord oh god that invited the holy spirit to bring such a unity and this is our desire god to lay aside everything of this world lay aside our thoughts and our cares though they might be ever so real and and very important but you care lord and you said that the lord and would ask of us to cast our cares upon you because you care for us so lord for every need is here tonight god i asked as we place some lord upon the altar of god and ask that the fire of god would come down and consume them and emit and address those needs that lord you would minister to our hearts in a very personal way as we are gathered here lord to walk in your presence lord and to be changed lord we love you and thank you now in jesus precious name amen amen one verse of scripture first corinthians chapter 13 verse 4. and i'm just going to read here and then we'll let you be seated paul writing with that of charity and that of love charity suffereth long and is kind charity envy if not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up amen may god bless his word and bless you as you're being seated sorry if you didn't get turned to it soon enough that's okay i heard some movement on pages but we just when we look at this and discerning the love of god and i want to continue to look at this this portion in the word i believe the word is set forth to admonish us as children of god to the rights and to the privileges to be reminded of what belongs to us that the spirit of god would bring discernment to our hearts and situations and i don't believe that it's god's desire that we it would just be reserved to where we come to the house of god and that's the only place of discernment but the reality is that every son and daughter of god that is born of the spirit of god you receive the spirit of discernment and we discern we recognize that our discernment is sharpened by the word of god and the word is the bible which would speak to us in hebrews 5 that you know milk itself is necessary in the beginning but then as we grow that strong meat belonging to them that are full age who have their senses exercised to discern good from evil we have situations that even in our life at times that we go through and there are things that i will say it like this that if we ever get to a spot that we feel like that well i'm going to get to a place that i'll never make a mistake you're aiming for a place that you'll never make it but the reality is is that is to have a real a real change on the inside when we have that change on the inside then we have the righteousness and the grace of god we've got the direction of god and we have that which seeks to please god and to follow his will and we learn as we go through things within our life there are situations and things that we can just come to a place and i think that we can speak freely in this to where you say lord help me to be ever more discerning in this in a situation because every situation sometimes it becomes somewhat the same but yet it comes in a different appearance we see that even in the temptations of the lord jesus this is where we need discernment and this is where to say lord let me live ever close to you that when things arise and come that god that i'll know i may not understand what's going on but there'll be something that i'm very sensitive to to let me know be careful in your step be careful what you're going to say be careful in your mood we want to be so under the control of the holy spirit and this is where with the scripture here as we're reading and i want to just touch a little bit here this this evening trying to uh move through this part here just a little bit uh and brother branham is is dealing with this here in the message influence and this i want to read this quote to you here he's speaking of of reverence he's speaking of uh of the the seraphims there in the temple and he says reverence we ought to honor one another respect one another as brother and sister and love one another with undying love and you say well i just can't well just stay here a little longer than you will like people too you'll love those who doesn't love you that's a really good sign of christianity when you can from your heart love those who does not love you love the unlovable jesus said and we read from this last time jesus said if you just do favors for those who do favors for you well the publicans do the same thing but you see you must be kind to those who are unkind to you do good for those that would do evil to you always remember that i think that's a very fitting uh admonition always remember that keep that before you that god is watching he's watching you remember god was good to you when you were evil to him while you were yet sinners christ died for you it's a very basis in the reality of our life we are we are taught to love by the love of god itself coming into our lives this is where that paul paul would write in many also different places and we find this admonition to the believers and you would you would look how paul would write this a concerning love and he would say let love be without dissimilation in the book of romans that means hypocrisy abort that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kindly affection to one another with brotherly love in honor preferring one another i think he would paul would write this he's not writing this to unbelievers truly with among the church there would be unbelievers there's make believers and believers but it's not up to you and i to decide who is a believer who's not a believer and frankly even if a person would even proven to be an unbeliever still the bible says he is kind to those who are unthankful see they're to recognize that even when judas was there among the lord jesus there was not one not one mark in his response or action toward judas even though he know who he was there was nothing that you could point out and say something's wrong here is that right right i think we all could say put both our hands and both our feet in the air and say help me jesus but being kindly affection to one another see god knowing that here you and i even after the change and after that there has come a real birth on the inside there's a change that's taken place let me just say it like this you used to live at the address of unkindness that used to be known you know how when you'd have you know kids going down the street don't walk in that guy's yard don't walk in that lady's yard they'll come out on the porch and yell at you there used to be and how god would write this at through paul to titus we once he writes it like this lived in malice lived in hatred hating one another we once lived in these places but god has delivered us there's a ransom that came as titus records through the kindness of our lord jesus christ that that kindness overwhelmed even our our first man was a contentious man the bible records a carnal mind as enmity and strife against god but what a paradox it is for god to get that man to come into a place of agreeance and laying down to where then he can move to bring about a real birth on the inside that is a paradox to where god can change a person's mind begin to change their thinking what did that the kindness and appearing of our lord jesus christ to us personally there's an effect that he has had upon our lives so here the scripture said be kindly affection one to another with brotherly love this this scripture it deals with that family that that love that is to exist between that of a family where you cherish your kindred you know i mean you know how it is i mean i found it out as a pastor i found it out in other situations blood's thicker than water blood's thicker than water i mean you just you know in in situations you you recognize there's a cherish sometimes between that can be and this family this person can be against this one don't get between it right there you get yourself killed because there's still a cherishedness that's there there's still a a a a part that's there that we should cherish that of our family but you see it raises to another place here we're not just talking about filial love we're talking about agape love where there's a real cherishing of our kind let me just say it like this the bible would say there should be peace toward all men we spoke of this there should be a love toward even those on the outside just because somebody doesn't see what we see or whatever more you know but we're we we are to love them and to be kind but how much greater it is to me to be able to come and be able to fellowship with brothers and sisters of light precious faith to be able to sit down with a brother or a sister and to be able to have fellowship around the revealed word of the hour to be able to come together with the body of believers let me just tell you something when we come together like this everyone bearing a lick of fire it's more of the godhead bodily coming together it's a fellowshipping of the attributes of god it's something that we cherish that you know how it is you can walk you can work around people and maybe there's people all around you and yet you feel so lonely but how precious it is that there are others that you can come to and there's a there's a cherishing just to be around brothers and sisters it's not even anything you've got to say or anything you've got to do you don't even have to have a partner service it's just a delight to be able to be gathered together with brothers and sisters there's a cherishing to this it's something that we cherish we cherish brothers and sisters and this is why the scripture is speaking of being kindly affection one to another and this word it deals with that kind of a love that would exist between of a children and parents where it's reciprocal now you think of this there's many places in the scripture like when it speaks of husbands and wives it never says one place in the scripture wives love your husbands it does say for the four the children honor father and mother and it ties in with that promise of of of longevity of life really speaking of the quality of your days and it speaks of these of these things but yet these things how can that be gained when we talk about honoring father and mother when we talk about wives you know that just submit as we read on sunday submit and and be subject under your husbands all of these things are to be governed by love but there must be a source of love a fountain of love as we spoke on where this right kind this love is being drawn from and this love has an effect it's effectual and that's why within this love here in order for it to be reciprocal it must be something that is flowing through the body because for something to be reciprocal it's what's expressed and then what's expressed it flows back i pray to god say god let there not be any damns in my life let there not be nothing that hinders the reciprocal flow of the love of almighty god even my thoughts on something i may not agree i may not feel but don't let me pull myself off because charity will never do that let it be a reciprocal let it be something that can be received as the moon can receive the light of the sun and reflect it back let it be something that our lives there's a reciprocal cherishing that that is taking place before our lives because this is where you know brother bran will tell us in a very simple way he talks about how you know the doctors told uh a hope when billy was born you know uh you know don't be picking that baby up all the time you let it lay in the crib by six months it ought to be quite broke and if it's crying let it lay in the crib brother bram said that don't sound like a doctor that sounds like a witch doctor to me you've got a choice as he said he said you know that little baby it's something that god has given to you and he says god's given it to you to spoil it and to love it he says take it and you love it because why how does a child learn love unless love is expressed is that right how can a child learn how to love and sometimes i understand that through when we speak to a congregation i understand we've all come from different backgrounds and different walks and sometimes these things sometimes would be like well that's just normal that's just natural but remember how does a child learn how to love unless they first are taught by an example how do they learn how to reciprocate a love and bring a love back and i know even our makeups can be different but this but such a love a love that is expressed how could you and i know how to love in this way if there hadn't been one who loved us when we were unlovable this is what paul says ye yourselves are taught of god to love one another god has taught us we were unlovable then listen there was a quarrel between us there was enmity between us there was a situation we were going completely the opposite way there was there was at odds but yet god himself he came he dealt with our life he spoke to something that was much deeper than the condition that we were in he spoke to the very depths of our life and his love brought a change love didn't pat us on the back but love spoke to the real need that was in our life love was able to discern this is the real need you see the real love of god is not just something that's a bubbly on the outside without any depth and density on the inside the real love of god is that it goes beyond emotion it's something that propels us it's what holds us it's what keeps us in the thickness in the darkness of the trial it's the love of god that we are not separated from it's what helps us when things look dark it helps us to look up when we feel down he lifts us up when we are discouraged he encourages us what is that that's the love of god amen oh hallelujah this is why when the scripture as it would speak to us there there in ephesians 4 it says be kind to one another tenderhearted you know you just kind of take that for granted well yeah you should be kind to one another but be kind to one another these are admonitions that when we know they're going to be times we really need that admonition there's times when we want it to come we want to be available to where god can bring it to our heart and say be kind you say oh lord yes lord jesus lord help me be tenderhearted that doesn't mean to be a but to be tenderhearted it deals with where there's compassion there's compassion and once again sometimes backgrounds but i don't believe i'm speaking to people here because sometimes the reality is in our life we want to when we can't see what we want to see in our life or we look at things and we say you don't know the family i come out of but i'm not talking about your natural family tree that's a cursed tree anyhow i'm talking about if you are born of the spirit of god you're of the tree of life so now you're not just looking at you're not under that of the strains of that natural tree you've received that strain of life that comes from the tree of life that lifts you into that place to where these are are the attributes and those parts that belong to us as sons and daughters of god it doesn't mean that you're not going to feel things out here this is why you've got to have an inside man charity on the inside that's able to pull that outside man in subjection to be tenderhearted this word in being tenderhearted it's the same word that's used in colossians 3 well in referring to it put on therefore as the elect of god this word put on i i'll tell you it becomes more real i've looked at it over the years put on it's sinking into a garment it's this where this garment of the new man the new birth becomes more preeminent amen it's overtaking in our life it becomes more and more preeminent the less man like we are the more god-like we become put on sink into that as the elect of god holy and beloved bowser mercy kindness this word kindness is the same word in the new testament that deals with goodness the goodness of god the gentleness of the fruit of the spirit but put on this and it speaks of bounds of mercy this is where that compassion that tender heartedness you know one of the first thing that god deals with in our life when he's bringing us to himself he changes our heart the bible says i'll give you a new heart and a new spirit so even with the tender heartedness god moves even to really affect even our thinking in the situation amen that god works so deep within our life and helps us to see things sometimes in a way that we can't see it and we need that we sometimes can't even see it even when it's presented to us and we can look at it sometimes the argument or the point of contention is is we're looking more at the wound or the grievance than actually at the admonition are you with me sometimes the wound and the grievance can cause people to ignore the healing that is present wound is a very serious thing a grievance there's probably not one of us in here that haven't been grieved i'm not talking about the holy spirit in your life i'm talking about you a grievance and those things but there is one who can take care of that wound but if you keep your thinking about it that wound will only canker it'll spread through your whole body and it'll overtake the system this is why there's got to be bowels of mercy this deals with a reserve like that of the spleen in our body that takes old cells that we would look at and say just get rid of them what it does it takes those cells i know i'm speaking to doctors here and everything there's some that studied for doctor and those are nurses and so forth but it takes those cells and it takes them in and instead of recycling them back into the body or just passing them on through it takes breaks down and it forms new cells i said god help me with bowels of mercy to have that when something comes like brother baby says when something comes your way oh you heard what so and so or you heard this let it be bowser mercy says let me have that sale take that sale and not pass it on to somebody else say this sound doesn't need to be loose in the body it's a corrupt cell this is why the bible says that let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but only that which would minister grace and edification to the hero we're responsible this is not just a duty of a pastor of a deacon we all are responsible in these things we all are to put on we all are to have that a charity we all are responsible to where we look at it and i'm just saying even for this church where you say this is my church this is my i'm talking about you saying that this is my church this is not coming in here we're not entertaining that hey did you hear about stop it right there glory be to god this is this is where the scripture goes on let me just just trying to wrap up that first part of that verse it deals in the scripture even in the stature of a perfect man of how that peter is dealing with you know from the foundation of faith and bringing it all the way up to the capstone but within there within the last age and the time that we would be in it's the admonition this is what the word would bring about a brotherly kindness remember the one one brother the way this was described in the vision was that where you had the water being poured into the church which is the holy ghost the the the the holy ghost being preached but inside of the church brother braham says there's all sorts of people it isn't that water itself as it's poured in that well everybody the whole church holds that water that water is a type of the holy spirit and it is poured out and there are individuals who receive that life and become born again but then you have the honey coming down brother says that honey was coming down he described that as brotherly kindness and look pouring it in that rock box it looks like you know the box that has like holes in it he says it looks like that honey would not stick but he says it does stick now these are the things that he speaks concerning this brotherly kindness he says so much where you know somebody could say you know i sure don't like brother neville i sure don't like brother jones i don't like brother so-and-so and something like that but just let something happen to him and your heart is broke it just nearly kills you he said see we can obtain brotherly kindness and feeling for one another feeling for one another you know sometimes feeling of having brotherly kindness and feeling for one another god sometimes can allow you and i to go through something so we can develop a little bit more feeling sometimes it's always so easy to think well why is this person going through this or why is this or why is that and why but you know each and every one of us we got our own tasks trials struggles what however you want to word it and this is where as we enter in brother graham called it like this schools of suffering that we have that we go through in order to know what someone else might be feeling and to have sympathy for them this is where even kindness comes in is to be able to look at it and he takes it even a little deeper he says now why he says do you care for that brother it's because you broke bread with him at the altar you fellowship with him you shook hands with him you worship with him he's your brother he might do something in the flesh that you would disagree with but you just kind of and because of that you just kind of stay he's saying stay away which you want to do he said but you shun him a little that's a natural tendency yeah someone said well that's not my tendency you're lying there's i'm talking not talking about your soul if you're born again there is no one that likes to stick around with somebody where there's contention and disagreeable or something see that's seal parts this is the mystery of even as we come together as a body of believers you know we sat down long enough it's like just when i sat down with ministers there's things that you know what we may not see i don't that's good let's move on let's move on i'm not we're not there to try to well let's try to hash this out and try to get this and we're not about that i i'm not interested in that right there there are some things that are important and there are other things that ain't going to stop or hinder the rapture you might feel it this way and i might think this way or whatever mark don't matter let's the main thing be settled is that you know jesus christ in the power of his resurrection and many times as we get into that it all depends on our makeup too sometimes others have to reign on this a little bit more sometimes people are a little bit more geared they gotta prove their point they gotta do they'll be tested in that just as much as others can be tested that are withdrawn but there are times that they've got to stand and say hey this is that there's got to be times and this is where we need the discernment of the holy spirit it has nothing about well i know what word comes and i know how to lay this in and you may know all of that but it's waiting on him to know what does he say do at that time this is where the love of god it governs that and that's what we want we do not want the knowledge without love we want love to govern our understanding this is where he says now but from the bottom of your heart now notice it will cause you to shun a little bit but notice brother ram takes this but in the bottom of your heart separating now if something happened to that brother it would just nearly kill you or that sister i'm an old man i was once young and now i'm old i'm just going to stop here just for a moment i wish i had a picture up here that somebody sent me a long time ago it showed two it showed two adults you know it looked you know it was like a a see-through body and it's just an outline of people and it showed uh two body come up here paul for a minute you might see through this guy but not me just stand stand with your back up next to mine it had and fold your arms like like no fold your arms out there like like you're upset and it had two adults standing like this and they're just facing the other way just but inside it showed two little people that was pushing to try to get together two little people like a little person in me a little person in there that's actually trying to get together but it's me and him keeping us apart you ain't moving me from my way i dug in i've created an imaginal line right here you ain't gonna budge me buddy hallelujah i thought of that just now there's things sometimes that that that within a person's life they know you know what i need to let this go let me tell you what comes to you and says no keep it going it ain't the spirit of christ it is satan because his business is to divide what should i do let the inner man have the right of way and humble yourselves as a little child see because in the bottom of the heart this is what brother braham said a person outwardly would chunk but in the bottom of the heart you still you have such a feeling for that person sometimes what it is you're trying to even process how to even how do i even interact with a person i don't know about you but maybe you haven't sometimes i've had that where people i don't know how to even interact with them i don't know i don't even know because it's just kind of the way things are when when things happen brother simon you as a pastor i'm just being honest with you so what do you do well you just try to you try to be friendly you're trying to be kind you don't know which way to go you know what way to say sometimes you know you've been around people that you say this right here they're coming to correct that wait a minute brother just chill out we're not here this isn't about anything we're just coming to just ease up you know where everything is all around and it's fine i don't call that fellowship but still maybe that brother maybe that sister maybe they're intense maybe there's things in their life that needs to be humbled and god is saying i got something i gotta rub off on you too samuel isn't it amazing we always look my that person god help that person god said i am and i'm trying to use you and trying to help you oh my once again hands and feet in the air help me jesus i'm an old man i once was young now i'm old i've seen it down through the age you hear people say i just won't have no more to do with it and something happened to that man that nearly kills you he thinks oh god i let my precious brother go without making friends with him see that's brotherly love brother brown would also describe it that that brotherly kindness it's putting yourself in his place on the matter i wonder why maybe the brother maybe there's maybe there's something back in the life maybe there's something that's been it doesn't make what they've done right that's not what it's saying but it's trying to understand why are they responding this way why are they going about this way why is it i mean it's just like when i've had things where people just do not trust as a pastor they don't trust everything's a conspiracy tell me why this what do you mean why things are just done but you know when you start to look at something you begin to realize what's behind that person's life and i'm not talking about a devil now i talk about sometimes there can be things sometimes it goes deep maybe into the raising maybe they have been scarred maybe they have been burnt but let me just tell you something if you've been burnt and you've been scarred and every one of us have had some sort of offense don't let that offense become an excuse i ain't never gonna trust nobody else that's natural to come that way you know that when you get burnt with things like that that's a natural tendency i don't care who you are even if you're a pastor it's a natural tendency to say i ain't trusting nobody no more we got quiet i know seeds dropping it's natural tendency i said it's a natural tendency i didn't say it was a god tendency this is where the battle comes in this is where it requires the strength of the lord within our lives this is where it requires leading us this is where it comes to that place and say god teach me lord help me lord and maybe in your life maybe there's things complexes that you didn't even realize and now a situation arises and you're looking at that situation and god is allowing that situation to highlight our need for more of him and that our lives might be further dissolved to become more of an instrument sometimes we're looking god i want to be such an instrument of you but you can't go past your abc's and become a great instrument here you have to in order for algebra it takes abcs is that right these things that we we see within it it takes it takes god to help us as brother braham says putting ourselves in under the brother's place he would say it in this manner if he's out of tune don't be impatient with him right anybody ever like anything out of tune like what if this piano we you know just had it out of tune or a guitar you would set out there and let brother so-and-so play air guitar tonight just let so-and-so play air piano tonight everybody can play air piano like beethoven let them play that tonight but i'm talking about when somebody gets out of tune you know what out of tune means they're not in one mind and one accord one mind and one of corn means where like everybody is a note and you you'll yield yourself to a harmony and when someone wants to start pulling off their note i mean their note might be a bigger note maybe an eighth note 16th note half note whole note man it's a better note no it's not it goes with the rest of the notes there's no big eyes or little u's your note on its own cannot make a song but if you yield your note it'll come in and it'll be part of the song and there'll be a beautiful melody that's what happened on the day of pentecost the great composer came down and the arrangement he put every note that was laying in their life and brought it to a divine expression oh god so when we get out of tune you know sometimes they appear on these instruments they get out of tune my father-in-law has these elec electronic tuners and you know they we have we have individuals that come in here and tune this piano same guy that goes over and retunes them over you know in other places in the cleveland areas goes into the halls and other places and tunes them and then we have guys that have to come in here and they have to look at this on the on the organ they try when the guy comes in here i've been here when he's done it that guy some of your brothers brother richard brother carlos you remember it before first time we had that guy come here about this tall he got behind that piano right there and the brothers were up there talking in the sunday school room he said pastor go tell them to be quiet please i need to hear because he don't turn by electronic he tunes by ear and his pitch he said no i need somebody to play that organ he tuned this to match that organ so that things would operate in a way he didn't want no even in this building he couldn't take any talking i started to whisper at that time he was tuning you know why you and i don't think about it we just come in here god is good all the time but you appreciate things being in tune don't you but because listen every once in a while that gets out of tune how bit not because kids are coming up here and beating on it it's because of use it just gets out of tune and sometimes you and i get out of tune and god has to come down and we're like oh lord be still and know i'm god [Music] you see how terrible that would be for that to take place while we're in service what if we all came in here and we sat down tonight brother brian here that guy came up he walked right down and says hey i'm here to tune the piano you know what you'd look at and say you're here at the wrong time this is not the time to be tuning it it's a time it needs to be tuned because we need to use it right now that's how we have to look at our lives we need god to come down but we will in our lives individually in our walk with god god keep me tuned up lord i want to be so in tune with him to where like when a guitar needs to be tuned you can say brother brian strike a c on that guitar and brother brian does it and i say okay let me i'm tuning mine up i don't know how to do it but i'm tuning mine up because why his is in tune i said god let our lives be in tune that somebody else could have an effect upon their life that if it's out of tune it could get into this is what the love of god will do amen oh my god let me just let me start into another part here i'm just going to start here but i want you to look here at this part of the scripture it suffereth long is kind we just looked at that but charity envieth not it envies not this out of the amplified it is love never is envious nor boils over with jealousy doesn't do that now when you realize that from a gumpa in love when you take feeling of love which so love we have is you know between parents and children and philadelphia would be that of a brotherly love but we recognize that the love that we're to have for one another it's a love that's drawn from the love of god we draw from that strength even in situations that are very hard we're drawing from the love of god we're saying lord that fountain that i'm tapped into lord i need to draw from that fountain i need that fountain that's open in the house of david i need to know that i need to draw from that fountain that life lord that's within me i need to draw from it in this situation lord i need strength lord i need to look at this in the right way let me just tell you something god doesn't like actors the bible says i read to you let love be without dissimilation you know when you go to talk to him tell him what's on your heart yes if you feel like you've been wrong just say god this is killing me this is hurting me stay there don't just go tell him that stay there and say but god you took what was wrong in me and made it right you projected a love toward my life that passes all understanding lord i have been affected i've been changed by that love now lord this situation has arose change my thinking lord change my feelings lord lord you're stronger lord and able to dissolve that feeling in my life that part that wants to pull away i don't want to pull away i want to pull away lord i want to yield that note that you've given me it might only be a little eighth notes quick it's gone but i need to yield my life lord charity in these not but chad but this envy envy doesn't come from that of agape envy comes it can be associated with that of the filial love but the brand describes the difference between that of a we're a wife he said a man would would say something to her or flirt with her whatever more he said fellow love would cause you to rise up he said uh you know you'd want to he says you know shoot his brains out that's his words you i think you get the picture but agape in love would make you pray for him and you know as i've said that before it's not shoot his brains out then pray for him afterwards sometimes we pull the sick shooters out and then pray oh god lord forgive me for being such a good shot and sometimes you know before it's the face off at the old corral the shooting practice at home oh preach really saying you know hitting the target you got everything this is wrong this is what should i do leave the gun in the truck like the prophet when he walked through the pasture he didn't even know he left the gun in the truck when he faced the bull say god help me to rest on you as my defense and not be defensive he said i'm your sheep and buckler yes i'm your defense may just let me just pause right here with this on envy let me just leave this here and we'll just close on this tonight envy envy's a terrible thing it's a terrible thing envy itself you can never put in the own god but satan himself rose with envy in heaven not on the earth in heaven he wanted a kingdom more beautiful and bigger than michael's kingdom what prompted him to do what he did envy see out here it looked mine this it might have seemed something grandiose but it was envy look what envy did it brought rebellion it brought division envy is a horrible thing it begins inwardly in a life it can even be envy itself is something that can start but it's got to be attended to and let me just say this to you and i'm closing with in any of these parts here in any of these things there's a part about it where we can look at us and we want to be real reflected that's the only way we're really helped is to be able to say god help me well brother samuel but i when i read into this or you're ministering or i'm looking at this i feel like i've got to go so much taller i've been preaching from this i've been reading from this i've and you know what as i told you weeks ago every time when i look back over there's not a time i'm not challenged there's not a time that i'm not looking at a situation i'm just trying to tell you you never get to a place that you outgrow things bothering you but you can grow to a place to where you catch it and say i'm not going to let you continue any longer that's where discernment comes not i got this feeling no that's you're you've not lost you're not been defeated understand me you've not been defeated but remember overcoming is recognizing the devil at every one of his tricks don't worry one of these moments we're going to get the change that'll match the change on the inside and not only will there not be oh boy when we get to the side that person's going to be changed they won't be pushing my buttons your buttons won't be there either thanks be to god see this is why we need to be changed more than just young people brother shane we need to be changed but there's a there's a god who's working on the inside i believe i'm speaking tonight brother dave to delegates brother aaron of that city there are there are delegates of that new jerusalem that are received of that life that are represented do we have battles oh we have battles are there offenses yes there's offenses are there trials sure there's trials is there is there adversity that wants to raise its head against this word that we're looking at tonight yes but i want to remind the devil greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world i used to live at that address i don't live in there no more god bless you let's stand amen brother brian or whoever's going to come and take the service amen do you love him amen let's just let's just look to the lord in a word of prayer heavenly father lord jesus i know lord if i ask for hands throughout this building i'm certain lord hands would be lifted up my hands as well god fill me lord with more of your love lord jesus help me to be more sensitive more discerning lord lord as you put it tonight in a manner the lord tucked away with you to where that my life lord could be in tune that somebody else might be able to be helped and i certainly would want to be helped by my brother my sister lord we need one another lord we need one another lord truly right here and i don't mean just in this assembly but i mean among the bride body this is lord god where the love of god resides in the earth this evening lord god help us lord [Music] lord jesus we're tested sometimes lord i know that we can lord in a place we can feel lord maybe a little down and i pray that god that you would help each and every one here this evening may they recognize lord of the strength of that inner man may they as paul would say put on that new man may they as we read put on as the holy as beloved holy elect of god vows of mercy help us lord i pray in our lives that god when situations and things arise tendencies maybe there's a tendency lord maybe for one to withdraw and there's a tendency for another to be able to try to get their point or their case across help us to realize lord that in either way help us lord we do not want to be of that where we've got to prove our point neither do we want to be of that lord god where it's just pulling away help us lord i realize lord that satan as your prophet he said it over and over it's realizing lord that it was the same way that satan wanted to try to come in among the ephesian church the galatian church the church in thessalonica on and on and on and on and on his objective was to try to break unity no wonder paul would write to us to endeavor that means to be strategic teaching endeavoring to keep the unity through the bond of peace help us lord i pray lord may we rely and rest upon you when situations arise may we really take it to you in prayer and may we not just lord leave it in prayer of complaining about it but may we take it to you and lord as we're there in prayer ask you to change us change my feelings toward it change my attitude lord god i don't want to leave out of this presence lord god without a change but i want to draw from the fountain lord god and i'm asking you lord jesus let my life be so saturated with that opium of the lily of the valley oh granite lord i pray tonight may you minister to every life every heart i pray as we commit ourselves and this congregation into your hands for the glory of god in jesus name amen you love him i want to love love too there's just no cause i could never [Music] ever he wants me to live [Music] there's just [Music] you will notice we say brother and sister around here it's because we're [Music] and these folks are so dear when one has a heartache we all share the tears and

that you give us lord as a body lord one towards another amen lord as our pastor was talking about the lord it's a it's a love that goes beyond the human love lord and said i can't be about the floor thank you lord that no matter what happens little things happen you know anywhere you get people together there's gonna be at least a little bit of trouble lord but you give us a love that just washes over it lord and we look at one another and we we just still we love one another like the brother said if something bad happens somebody somebody gets sick somebody gets in trouble lord we go to prayer for our lord thank you for that lord i pray that it would just grow deeper in us lord and lord if there be something that would rise up where we you'd be testing us or trying us or trying to work out something in our life lord may we always look with love towards one another and be praying for one another lord jesus never cut nobody off but always be praying for one another help us never to hold a grudge lord jesus it's not like the holy spirit we're thankful for the holy ghost it's that law that comes and lives inside of us lord amen if we can fulfill your word thank you for it lord i pray and bless all my brothers and sisters that's here tonight everyone within the sound of my voice lord god those on the internet lord may the holy ghost go with them bless them lord just fill them lord may they be overflowing with love may it may it affect someone around the lord be someone around and get thirsty for god just just tasting a little bit of that love that's flowing granted we pray lord may your holy ghost walk with us and be in us jesus christ amen god bless you all amen how many says i love my brothers and sisters tonight i'm gonna pray i'm gonna pray for somebody this
