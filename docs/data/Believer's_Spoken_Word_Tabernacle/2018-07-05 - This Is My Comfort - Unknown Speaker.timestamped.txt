[31:31] [Music]
[31:39] hey let's just bow our heads and word of
[31:42] Prayer Heavenly Father lord of your God
[31:46] lord I pray help me to yield to you that
[31:49] you may be able to come and speak to me
[31:51] to help to the people uplifting
[31:53] strengthening on a parade your God
[31:55] we asked us in the name of the Lord
[31:58] Jesus Christ to the glory of God amen
[32:05] if you could turn me in your Bibles to
[32:10] one to me on down to the 92nd verse
[32:16] unless the law had been my delights I
[32:21] should then have perished in my
[32:23] affliction I will never forget thy
[32:26] precepts for with them down as quicken
[32:30] me I am dying
[32:32] save me for I have sought thy precepts
[32:36] the wicked have waited for me to destroy
[32:39] me but I will consider thy testimonies
[32:41] you may be seated
[32:45] we as human we look people look for
[32:50] comfort in many different things there
[32:55] are some people that look for comfort in
[33:00] sickness it might seem strange but there
[33:06] is a word for that it's called
[33:07] hypochondriac and as long as they got
[33:12] something they're okay they've always
[33:16] got to have something wrong with them
[33:18] and you realize that one of the things
[33:22] that's anxiety that actually brings on
[33:25] these false symptoms that they feel and
[33:30] you know used to be they would have a
[33:32] home health care encyclopedias now they
[33:37] got Google now they can ask Siri you
[33:43] know tell them this is what I'm feeling
[33:46] it and there's a disease for every
[33:52] occasion and there's an illness for
[33:55] every symptom
[33:58] there are people who take comfort and in
[34:05] things like David one time took comfort
[34:12] in he was hit away from solving men when
[34:16] saul was chasing David and David took
[34:22] refuge in a cave to hide from Saul and
[34:27] then while David and his men are hid in
[34:32] this cave why salt comes there and salt
[34:37] Kampf right down at the cave and
[34:38] actually lays himself down to sleep
[34:40] right there in the cave David says in
[34:43] the Psalms when that happened he said my
[34:45] refuge has failed me and people take
[34:51] refuge or comfort in a lot of different
[34:54] things and these other things fail them
[35:00] there are some people who take refuge in
[35:04] your job in a job you know being able to
[35:08] provide for themselves is what they feel
[35:09] like and then they lose that job and now
[35:13] they don't have that refuge there are
[35:16] some people who take refuge and money
[35:18] they take comfort in having money money
[35:22] money can fail you it can run out there
[35:28] are people that take comfort in money
[35:32] and maybe perhaps have enough to where
[35:34] that they'll never run out in their
[35:36] lifetime but without Christ their refuge
[35:40] has failed them because when you come
[35:44] down to the end you can't take none of
[35:46] it with you and it won't buy you
[35:48] anything on the other side
[35:59] but the Brenham says man's always tried
[36:04] to find some way to save himself right
[36:07] here it is that's his nature in the
[36:09] Garden of Eden the man as soon as he
[36:12] found out he was lost he made himself a
[36:14] religion a fig leaf apron and put it
[36:17] over him
[36:18] that's the strain of man yet today even
[36:21] after 4000 years yes nearly 6,000 years
[36:25] man still trying to cover his own sins
[36:27] by his own merits he'll quit eating meat
[36:32] there's a lot of that going on today
[36:34] well could eating meat just eat all
[36:37] vegetables and you'll be better than
[36:39] theirs they've got many of people that
[36:42] you can read about in the news of a
[36:43] swear by this and how much better their
[36:46] life is and how much better they're
[36:48] feeling brother Brown says that here he
[36:51] said there could eating meat and they'll
[36:54] keep all kinds of days and he'll tear
[36:58] himself down he will try everything he
[37:00] can to save himself when it's so simple
[37:04] that even a fool couldn't fail to find
[37:06] it that's right the Bible says so just
[37:09] simply by grace are you saved through
[37:13] faith yet he will try to mystify it have
[37:18] all kinds of seen lights and hearing
[37:20] sounds and everything and all kinds of
[37:23] mystifying things to get people to be
[37:26] saved there's only one way to be saved
[37:32] jesus said I'm the way the truth the
[37:35] life but
[37:42] David writes here what we read in our
[37:45] text and saw that his comfort was the
[37:49] word had quickened him in his
[37:53] afflictions this was his comfort the
[37:54] word had quickened him he wasn't looking
[37:58] for sympathy from someone else there are
[38:02] times when people will face things and I
[38:05] think I might have said there's some
[38:07] Sunday I'm not sure but they will
[38:09] they'll call up somebody else looking
[38:14] for somebody to sympathize with what
[38:15] they're going through and try to find
[38:20] some kind of comfort in the fact that
[38:22] somebody else would say oh poor you but
[38:30] David said his comfort was in the word
[38:33] had quickened him in officience chapter
[38:38] 2 Paul writes a new hath he quickened
[38:43] who were dead in trespasses and sins
[38:47] where in time past she walked according
[38:50] to the course of this world according to
[38:52] the Prince of the power of the air the
[38:55] spirit that now worketh in the children
[38:57] of disobedience among whom also we all
[39:00] had our conversations in times past in
[39:04] the lusts of our flesh the fulfilling
[39:06] the desires of the flesh and of the mind
[39:08] and we're by nature the children of
[39:11] Wrath even as others but God who is rich
[39:14] in mercy for his great love we're in he
[39:18] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[39:22] hath quickened us together with Christ
[39:25] by grace ye are saved and it's raised us
[39:30] up together and made us sit together in
[39:33] heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in
[39:36] the ages to come he might shew the
[39:38] exceeding riches of His grace in his
[39:41] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus
[39:43] for by grace are you saved through faith
[39:46] and that not of yourselves it is a gift
[39:49] of God not of works lest any man should
[39:53] boast
[39:54] for we are his workmanship created in
[39:57] Christ Jesus unto good works which God
[39:59] hath before ordained that we should walk
[40:02] in them so we've been quickened from
[40:05] trespasses and sins we should be able to
[40:08] take comfort in that that's what David
[40:11] saying I take comfort in that the word
[40:13] has quickened me we take comfort in
[40:19] knowing our destination we're not going
[40:24] to find any comfort here in this world
[40:26] and this world is a comfort seeking type
[40:31] of world and as I said people are
[40:36] seeking that comfort in many different
[40:39] types of things to try to lose
[40:44] themselves or or to escape from the
[40:49] things that are troubling their minds
[40:59] but we as the Bride of Christ ought to
[41:02] be able to look and say I know I've been
[41:04] quickened I know that he called me he
[41:10] ordained me this is where I find my
[41:13] security this is where I find my refuge
[41:16] this is my comfort before I know no man
[41:22] did it and in joining the church but
[41:28] it's joining Christ Jesus letting Christ
[41:33] come into your life and he said we were
[41:36] dead in sins but he hath quickened us in
[41:41] Christ hallelujah
[41:46] I like this he writes in Colossians
[41:52] chapter 2 verse 13 and you being dead in
[41:58] your sins and the uncircumcision of your
[42:01] flesh hath he quickened together with
[42:04] him having forgiven you all trespasses I
[42:10] haven't forgiven you all trespasses
[42:15] Satan will try to plug your mind through
[42:19] the gate of your memory with things that
[42:23] you had done or committed but this says
[42:29] we have been forgiven all trespasses
[42:34] blotting out the handwriting of the
[42:37] Ordinances that was against us which was
[42:42] contrary to us and took it out of the
[42:45] way nailing it to his cross so all of
[42:51] our trespasses our sins the handwriting
[42:55] as the Bible says that was against us
[42:57] has been nailed to the cross we should
[43:01] be able to take comfort in that amen
[43:04] knowing that will not have to face those
[43:09] things
[43:10] the Bible says that there is coming a
[43:13] day of judgment and it said every man
[43:16] will appear in his body and give account
[43:18] for the sins which he committed in the
[43:20] body says I believe it's in 2nd
[43:23] Corinthians chapter 5 but we have a new
[43:30] body our bodies will be changed will not
[43:36] be in this body in this condition that
[43:41] it's in
[43:50] and it's bill all because he nailed it
[43:52] all to the cross and having spoiled
[43:57] principalities and powers he made a show
[44:00] of them openly triumphing over them in
[44:02] it
[44:06] the battle is already won you know when
[44:15] we lose is when we try to do it
[44:17] ourselves we try to take it into our own
[44:20] hands that's when we lose but he's
[44:23] already won for us
[44:24] we're already victors we already have
[44:29] the victory
[44:39] brother Branham says he was talking into
[44:42] message of God's who's rich in mercy he
[44:44] was talking about his little story about
[44:46] the Eagle the little Eagle it that was
[44:49] hatched under a chicken and and how that
[44:53] it was scratching around in the barnyard
[44:55] not knowing what it was and trying to
[45:01] eat like the chickens were eating
[45:02] because it was born there but then one
[45:06] day said that great eagle flew over and
[45:11] screamed looking for that little one and
[45:15] when I heard that scream it wakened
[45:18] something within that little eaglet and
[45:21] it caused it to jump up on the fence
[45:24] post and begin to spread its wings and
[45:27] then took off soared into the heavens
[45:30] all because that it it became to itself
[45:33] to realize what it really was something
[45:35] that was in that screen spoke to him
[45:38] didn't speak to any of the other birds
[45:41] but it spoke to him and brother Branham
[45:45] says that's the way it is with every
[45:47] born-again believer you can hear all the
[45:50] theology you want to and all the
[45:51] man-made discrepancies but when the word
[45:54] flashes out there there's something that
[45:57] takes ahold you come to it you were once
[46:02] dead in sin that life has he quickened
[46:06] there has to be a life there to to
[46:11] quicken to first so when you were born
[46:18] there was a life in you there's more
[46:22] than this life and it's quickened when
[46:28] you heard the word it brought something
[46:32] that brought a change in you something
[46:34] that felt like came alive
[46:43] that there had to be a life there first
[46:45] in order for something to be quickened
[46:48] and God by his foreknowledge knowed all
[46:51] things and we were predestinated to be
[46:56] sons and daughters of God see he
[47:01] connects this with this God's
[47:03] foreknowledge there's some people that
[47:06] stumble with these things and say well
[47:07] there's some does it mean that they
[47:10] don't have a choice no everyone has a
[47:11] choice everyone has a choice but God
[47:16] being all-knowing knows what you're
[47:17] going to choose and therefore can
[47:23] predestinate means your Destiny's
[47:27] already determined I I don't see a
[47:29] problem with that if you're gonna if I'm
[47:31] gonna go somewhere I've got to know what
[47:34] my destination is going to be I don't
[47:35] don't get on a plane and say wherever
[47:37] you take me well when you book an
[47:44] airline ticket why you booked it from
[47:47] where you're at to where you're going to
[47:50] and you know where you're going to so
[47:55] our destinies been predetermined we got
[47:58] a flight that's going to take out of
[47:59] here and go straight to heaven
[48:03] we are predestinated to be sons and
[48:06] daughters of God ye who were once dead
[48:09] in sins and trespasses we're in all had
[48:13] our times past but hath he quickened and
[48:19] brother Branham goes on to say look at
[48:20] Paul he was a great theologian but when
[48:25] he came face-to-face with the word Jesus
[48:27] in the light it quickened him he come to
[48:35] life right quick because he was ordained
[48:37] to be that you realize you were ordained
[48:41] to be where you're at you were getting
[48:46] to be what you are if you are a
[48:51] born-again believer filled with the Holy
[48:54] Ghost you are gain for that
[48:58] and if God has called you and you say
[49:02] well I don't know that I haven't
[49:04] received a whole negotiate but if God
[49:06] has called you you're ordained to
[49:08] receive the Holy Ghost talking more
[49:17] about Paul he said he was a part of the
[49:19] word brother Branham says in one message
[49:26] he says in the back parts of God's mind
[49:29] he had some thoughts that he was wanting
[49:32] to manifest those thoughts were
[49:35] redeemable thoughts those thoughts were
[49:39] you and I that he would in the age to
[49:47] come in the right season you would be
[49:50] born you would come forth and you would
[49:53] be quickened by the Word of God in the
[49:56] season God had preordained for you he
[50:03] was part of the word meaning there was
[50:06] part of if you are a part of God then
[50:10] you always had to be a part of God you
[50:12] were born a part of God you may not have
[50:16] known but once you came in contact with
[50:19] the word there was something that
[50:22] changed in you there was something that
[50:24] that that spoke to and the word saw the
[50:35] world and all the clucking of the hens
[50:40] and the Orthodox churches didn't
[50:42] effective have no effect upon him he saw
[50:45] the word and it was part of him I one
[50:55] time went and was on a round to Easter
[50:59] time I went and I bought some ducks some
[51:02] little ducklings and they were just
[51:04] little fuzzy little yellow looking
[51:07] things and
[51:08] and they seemed real fragile and I took
[51:14] an eye
[51:15] I bought a container to put them in to
[51:20] keep them and while they were little and
[51:23] put a light in there you know to shine
[51:26] on a little to give him some warmth so
[51:28] they wouldn't be cold and they had water
[51:32] to drink and had food to eat but then
[51:36] one day I bought him a bigger container
[51:38] they were still pretty small they still
[51:41] were yellow in color and I bought him a
[51:45] bigger container and then I bought this
[51:47] little tub that would fit in that
[51:48] container and I put some water in it now
[51:52] that little ducts had been hatched in an
[51:55] incubator because the kind of ducks say
[51:58] words of Peking Duck they call him and
[52:01] those ducks will not sit on their eggs
[52:05] they're a heavy duck and could perhaps
[52:09] even crush their own eggs if they tried
[52:12] to sit on them so to get these ducks
[52:15] you've got a hatch him in an incubator
[52:16] and so these ducklings had come out of
[52:20] an incubator had never been around a
[52:23] mother duck had never been around water
[52:26] except for a little bit of water that
[52:29] was in a special container where they
[52:31] could get around and drink out of it but
[52:36] when I put that tub of water in there
[52:38] something happened to them little
[52:40] ducklings and one of them I guess must
[52:46] have been the leader took off straight
[52:49] for that water just as fast as he could
[52:51] go
[52:51] and it wasn't good enough for him just
[52:54] to get in it he would dive down to the
[52:56] bottom in that little tub and will you
[53:00] see him dive down the bottom and just
[53:02] moving those feet and just going down
[53:04] through the water and he was like look
[53:06] more like a fish than a duck brother
[53:11] Brennan tells a story about that now he
[53:15] said a duck that was hatched in a
[53:18] chicken yard
[53:19] he said he'd never knew anything about
[53:24] water and something strikes because when
[53:27] you go to buy these ducklings buy them
[53:29] in place like TSE or someplace like that
[53:31] and they'll have other containers of
[53:35] chickens in their little chicks and
[53:38] they're eat now the same type of
[53:40] container the Ducks treat now to other
[53:41] drinking out of the same kind of
[53:43] containers the Ducks are drinking out
[53:44] over so they're treating these ducks
[53:47] like chickens brother Brown said this
[53:51] little duckling it was born in chicken
[53:53] yard he didn't know any different except
[53:55] that one day he smelled water and he
[54:00] took off of that water just as hard as
[54:02] he could go brother branham said he had
[54:09] never been on a pond before he had never
[54:11] been in the water but he was a duck to
[54:14] begin with you ever heard that saying
[54:17] like a duck to water
[54:21] ducks have to have water they have to
[54:27] keep their feathers cleaned and and they
[54:30] have to keep oil that they spread
[54:33] throughout their feathers so that it
[54:36] makes him boy in the water just roll off
[54:40] you've heard the same like water off a
[54:42] duck's back a lot of those sayings
[54:46] you've ever heard about ducks I've seen
[54:48] they are true and brother bream said but
[54:54] he was a duck to begin with the only
[54:55] thing he had to do was come to himself
[54:57] and that's the same thing to believer is
[55:00] there's something in him that when he
[55:03] meets God faced the faith he faced he
[55:06] comes to himself that seed in him is
[55:10] quickened I've had someone come to me
[55:17] one time and they were saying no they
[55:20] you weren't born with that seed in you
[55:22] state they had been in brother branham's
[55:24] meetings as individual they said brother
[55:26] Branham put that seed in me I said no he
[55:27] didn't because that's against even when
[55:31] he preaches
[55:32] I've had other people come see my pastor
[55:35] put that seed in me no he didn't if you
[55:39] have that seat of God that you were born
[55:40] with it God put it there no man gave it
[55:45] to you no man can take it away the devil
[55:47] didn't give it to you and he can't take
[55:49] it away
[55:49] the devil cannot do one thing about your
[55:51] predestination he can't stop you from
[55:58] going to heaven because you're ordained
[56:02] to go there
[56:10] my that's right he says he flies away
[56:12] from the things of the world they become
[56:14] dead to him my I remember we all had our
[56:18] life in the past and those things of the
[56:20] world but once we got a hold of that
[56:22] real thing
[56:24] something that quickened us a little
[56:27] seed that come to life then all the
[56:30] things of the world rotted right there
[56:32] we had no more desire of
[56:46] often think of the story of the woman at
[56:48] the well I like how in John and Jesus
[56:54] says I have need to go by Samaria I love
[56:58] that statement I have need to go by
[57:01] Samaria why do you have need because
[57:04] there was a redeemable thought down
[57:06] there but it was the woman at the well
[57:12] she was a Samaritan she was half two and
[57:17] half Gentile she was a Samaritan the
[57:23] Jews didn't have anything to do with
[57:25] those people but jesus said I have need
[57:31] to go by there you may have been sitting
[57:38] in some other Church in some other place
[57:43] but one day Jesus said I've got need to
[57:46] go by there and there was something in
[57:53] you that seemed like it just wasn't
[57:55] being satisfied and so you went
[58:02] searching everybody is searching but
[58:08] sometimes brother Brown says they take
[58:11] the things of the world and try to to
[58:14] quench that thirst that God put in him
[58:17] for himself but there was something that
[58:23] you couldn't be satisfied with that
[58:25] the other man says in another place said
[58:28] maybe while you were growing up you you
[58:33] would go and do certain things he said
[58:35] but it seemed like there was something
[58:37] that kept you from going any further and
[58:41] he said you would see others do those
[58:44] things and was like it had just rolled
[58:47] right off there meant nothing
[58:49] but to you you felt a little something
[58:53] you and it was more than just some
[58:58] morals or something in you what was it
[59:02] it was that seed it was the the part of
[59:05] the word that was in that woman she come
[59:15] to the well at a time when it was later
[59:19] a little bit later in the day the
[59:20] afternoon after all the maidens and and
[59:24] different women had already been to the
[59:27] well and left then she came because the
[59:30] Bible says she was a ill-famed woman
[59:39] but you know Jesus never one time even
[59:43] though he discerned those things he
[59:47] never condemned her he never said
[59:54] because of these things you have no
[59:56] chance he went down there especially
[1:00:04] just for her you know the story she
[1:00:09] comes to the well she says he says give
[1:00:12] me a drink and she says it's not
[1:00:15] customary for a Jew dass's american for
[1:00:17] something to drink and he said if you
[1:00:23] knew who you were talking to you to ask
[1:00:24] me for a drink and I'd give you a drink
[1:00:27] you never thirst again see he knew she
[1:00:31] had a thirst in her life for something
[1:00:33] she was trying to quench that thirst
[1:00:36] with all these other things she tried to
[1:00:40] quench that thirst with all these other
[1:00:42] men she had been with but Jesus
[1:00:46] recognized he knew the thirst was still
[1:00:48] there that's why I said you'd never
[1:00:50] thirst again if you drink this water
[1:00:52] she said the wells too deep you have
[1:00:54] nothing to draw with how are you getting
[1:00:56] where did this water come from then he
[1:01:00] just begins to talk to her you noticing
[1:01:05] about it he never goes on talking more
[1:01:07] about the water or how he's gonna draw
[1:01:10] the water but yet again he is talking
[1:01:16] about it because he begins to to talk to
[1:01:23] her and she says well our Father said
[1:01:27] worship in this mountain and others say
[1:01:30] worship at the temple and and what do
[1:01:34] you say
[1:01:35] and he said the time will come when you
[1:01:38] would neither worship in the mountain or
[1:01:40] the temple but all that worship Him will
[1:01:42] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:01:46] she said I perceived you are a prophet
[1:01:51] now when he went down to the temple they
[1:01:55] called him belzebub they called him the
[1:01:59] Prince of Devil's City casts out Devils
[1:02:03] by the Prince of Devil's that was the
[1:02:07] priest the so-called religious man of
[1:02:12] the day they didn't recognize him
[1:02:17] why because religion is not enough to be
[1:02:21] able to recognize Christ you don't
[1:02:24] recognize him by religion and his
[1:02:30] religious as they were and as much of
[1:02:32] keeping the law as they did they didn't
[1:02:36] recognize the very Messiah that they
[1:02:40] were looking for they looked for a
[1:02:43] messiah because the law told him that it
[1:02:45] was coming the prophets prophesied of
[1:02:49] him
[1:02:50] they were looking but all through the
[1:02:54] time of waiting they had made up in
[1:02:56] their minds how it was going to be and
[1:03:00] it didn't come the way they thought it
[1:03:02] was going to come so they did there was
[1:03:08] nothing in them to recognize that voice
[1:03:13] jesus said my sheep know my voice they
[1:03:17] were not of his sheep they couldn't
[1:03:21] wreck that was not something in them
[1:03:22] that recognized that voice maybe perhaps
[1:03:29] some of you can remember the first time
[1:03:31] you ever heard brother branham it wasn't
[1:03:33] his voice
[1:03:34] there was a voice behind that voice that
[1:03:38] you recognized and it spoke of the truth
[1:03:47] but she said sir I perceive you are a
[1:03:50] prophet it's because there was something
[1:03:53] in her that recognized that voice there
[1:03:57] was something about that voice to her
[1:03:59] and then went on talking and Jesus said
[1:04:02] go get your husband and she said I have
[1:04:04] no husband
[1:04:05] he said you spoke him well for you've
[1:04:08] had five and the one you're with now
[1:04:09] it's not your husband this didn't cause
[1:04:16] her to be offended there was something
[1:04:21] in her that said you have to be the
[1:04:24] Messiah she dropped her water pots the
[1:04:31] Bible said and running into the city
[1:04:32] come see a man that's told me everything
[1:04:35] I've ever done
[1:04:51] there are some individuals that can say
[1:04:56] well they were raised in this message
[1:05:00] grew up hearing this this message grew
[1:05:08] up hearing the tapes when they were
[1:05:10] young grew up hearing the tapes in their
[1:05:11] homes but went out and did the things of
[1:05:15] the world or just seemed like you wasn't
[1:05:17] quick into that but one day you were one
[1:05:23] day it did quicken why it was at the
[1:05:26] time and season that God had ordained
[1:05:29] for it to happen
[1:05:37] brother Branham says concerning the
[1:05:39] little woman at the well he said she had
[1:05:43] fallen from God's thoughts she could be
[1:05:47] redeemed she was a subject she had
[1:05:52] representation in heaven look at the
[1:05:57] difference between her and them
[1:05:58] preachers her priests they saw it and
[1:06:02] said this man's a fortune-teller they
[1:06:05] didn't know the word but she said sir
[1:06:08] you must be a prophet we ain't had one
[1:06:11] for hundreds of years we know that when
[1:06:13] the Messiah comes and he what he's going
[1:06:15] to do oh my
[1:06:18] and then she recognized that it was him
[1:06:29] my parents come to this message when I
[1:06:31] was just a young boy and I can remember
[1:06:40] living up in Cleveland Ohio and sitting
[1:06:44] out on the porch and in a little chair
[1:06:47] and hearing the tapes played and I could
[1:06:55] tell you things that were said on the
[1:06:57] tapes I could tell you things that
[1:06:58] brother Branham said I could tell you
[1:06:59] the stories that he talked about I must
[1:07:09] have had a tender heart for the Lord
[1:07:16] but when I came to be a young teenager
[1:07:20] why begin to see the attractions of the
[1:07:24] world and they glitter and they shine
[1:07:34] and they look pleasant just like in the
[1:07:38] Garden of Eden and just like the Bible
[1:07:44] says sin is pleasure for a season and
[1:07:47] then it's death
[1:07:55] but one day something spoke to me and I
[1:08:01] had grew up to me knowing that the
[1:08:05] message was right
[1:08:07] and when that hunger for God began to be
[1:08:12] awakened in my life I didn't look
[1:08:14] somewhere else to define to quench that
[1:08:18] thirst another church I mean but I I
[1:08:22] knew that it could only be quenched in
[1:08:26] in the God that had been revealed in
[1:08:29] this age it changed something hidden me
[1:08:39] stayed you ever backslide sure it did
[1:08:44] brother Ram talks about Abraham said he
[1:08:46] was back slid over in the desert telling
[1:08:50] that King that Sarah was his sister and
[1:08:52] not his wife
[1:09:01] one day I got the Holy Ghost and that
[1:09:07] changed everything that changed
[1:09:11] everything
[1:09:18] I'm thankful tonight that he's quickened
[1:09:21] me that I can look and I can see where
[1:09:26] I'm going I know where I'm going
[1:09:30] we need to know that just this week
[1:09:35] Monday actually marked the date my dad
[1:09:40] had passed a year ago but I know where
[1:09:43] he's at and I know there's others that's
[1:09:47] passed away and I know they're there
[1:09:50] together and sometimes I said and I I
[1:09:58] think about the different ones that's
[1:10:00] went on to be with the Lord and the ones
[1:10:02] that are together and that knew each
[1:10:06] other here in this life and are together
[1:10:08] there now
[1:10:17] and I think I can't wait to be united
[1:10:22] reunited with them again for the date
[1:10:27] when we'll have that time to be
[1:10:33] reacquainted oh my then I look forward
[1:10:41] friends I find comfort in knowing that
[1:10:45] I'm gonna have a body change in this
[1:10:52] body I struggle with different diseases
[1:10:56] but I know I none of those are gonna be
[1:11:00] in that change body this body some of
[1:11:05] the diseases I suffer with they if I let
[1:11:08] them they'll worry my mind that I'll
[1:11:12] worry about as I get older how well will
[1:11:17] I be able to get around but in that body
[1:11:24] I don't have to worry about that and I'm
[1:11:28] trusting in God while I'm in this body
[1:11:31] and I believe that he said I'm the LORD
[1:11:34] thy God that healeth all thy diseases
[1:11:45] and if he can heal somebody from cancer
[1:11:50] what can stand in his way no disease
[1:12:01] and I know the Bible says that he
[1:12:03] wouldn't put on us more than we could
[1:12:04] bear some things that we struggle with
[1:12:14] and they remind us of our the dis life
[1:12:21] is short this life has no certainty but
[1:12:27] we know we got a life that's coming how
[1:12:33] one of the things I thought well my
[1:12:35] after my father passed was he's not
[1:12:38] suffering anymore he suffered so many
[1:12:40] different illnesses and I thought well
[1:12:44] he's not suffering them now right before
[1:12:49] he passed he couldn't walk very well but
[1:12:53] he's walking now and he doesn't need a
[1:12:57] cane
[1:13:03] and I'll see him again I take comfort in
[1:13:05] that Paul talking about that he says
[1:13:13] comfort one another with these words
[1:13:20] that the dead in Christ shall rise first
[1:13:25] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:13:31] be changed
[1:13:32] be caught up together to meet him in the
[1:13:36] air and Paul says comfort one another
[1:13:41] with these words when we lose a loved
[1:13:45] one that's one of the things that we can
[1:13:48] look forward to take comfort in is that
[1:13:50] we'll see them again
[1:14:02] I take comfort in coming to church
[1:14:10] when you've been through a week you're
[1:14:13] facing different things and having to do
[1:14:17] different things and and you face
[1:14:21] different ones out in the world and
[1:14:25] things have happened and things have
[1:14:28] been said in that and but when it comes
[1:14:31] to church time you can't wait to get
[1:14:33] there brother Branham said leave it's in
[1:14:37] Christ and mystery God revealed he said
[1:14:39] if you have the Holy Ghost you can't
[1:14:41] wait for them doors to open we long for
[1:14:47] the comfort that we get from our
[1:14:51] brothers and sisters spending time with
[1:14:57] them fellowshipping having time is hogg
[1:15:07] we strengthen one another we encourage
[1:15:10] one another sometimes you may walk up to
[1:15:18] somebody and say something not even know
[1:15:20] anything's going on in their life I
[1:15:21] don't even know what they're going
[1:15:23] through or anything's going on but
[1:15:25] you'll say something and you don't know
[1:15:27] what that that's something you say might
[1:15:30] have been exactly what they needed to
[1:15:32] hear right at that moment and you may
[1:15:39] never know it but that's okay that's
[1:15:46] Christ in you speaking one to another
