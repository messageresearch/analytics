[20:48] in a homily he chained her name
[20:51] how do when he gave him a new name I
[20:54] Israel was not down because of Ishmael
[20:58] would've been de Saint John 3:16 gonna
[21:01] be wrote he will write in the New
[21:04] Testament
[21:05] that was so long the world that He gave
[21:07] His only begotten Son so we have one son
[21:11] to bring that time so God got away with

[34:31] know that what we all grown in and we
[34:33] are in prevail weight in front of a
[34:35] manifestation waited by the I prefer the
[34:39] strike this body right hello Lou you
[34:44] that was Jesus he come for his
[34:48] atmosphere within himself he conquered
[34:53] it
[34:54] Jesus was late after Jesus was baptized
[34:56] the Bible say he will lead into the
[34:58] wilderness to be tempted of the devil
[35:03] at him fasted forty days and forty
[35:06] nights a forty days and forty nights
[35:10] fast your stomach over a hamburger look
[35:17] like Outback I mean you know Jesus had
[35:23] to fight that human battle if Gina would
[35:26] have fight it the devil in the
[35:27] supernatural way then we had to pin on
[35:29] the super they not in a in a miracle way
[35:32] and we had to look for miracles every
[35:34] time something going but Jesus wanted us
[35:36] to put our faith in the word because
[35:39] heaven and earth will pass away but my
[35:41] word won't pass away so we need
[35:43] something that won't bet what L promise
[35:45] you fail what have been healing only
[35:47] they might fall into it but the word
[35:49] will live and by forever and ever
[35:52] and ever so edgy Nutella if he gonna
[35:57] tell us to walk by faith walk and bleed
[36:00] a word then he can prove he going to put
[36:02] it to the test
[36:04] so Hickel Jesus he's in AD with Willis
[36:07] Peter plaster 40 days 40 night and he is
[36:11] weak
[36:12] I mean weak like you would be cuz he's
[36:16] fighting that he facing the devil as a
[36:18] magnet he could have you know he was God
[36:22] he could have done what he want to do
[36:23] but he he decided to face him as a man
[36:26] so when you know what it was doing he
[36:29] was taking out all the excuse for the
[36:31] weak Christians he trying to let the
[36:34] weak Christians know that you look at me
[36:35] to use y'all gal wish you get you can
[36:37] always beat the devil how do you even
[36:39] want to prove I want to let you know
[36:41] Devon that the weakest Christian they
[36:43] can beat you any place any time any
[36:45] world so to do that he had to become
[36:48] weak you know sometimes we say oh I'm
[36:51] just too weak no you hey do we how do
[36:54] you can you say a word wave you hate if
[36:56] you can't say you can't wave your hand

[37:46] Hailey's uh but what did Jesus do Jesus
[37:49] goes to the devil and he goes back to
[37:51] the word because the power is in his
[37:54] word he goes back his word he's a Satan
[37:58] it is written man shall not live by
[38:03] bread alone but by every word to precede
[38:08] neither man for God I just say if Jesus
[38:11] would decide that he was gonna he hungry

[38:17] a stone off the ground out here to do
[38:20] this thang bread big old sit right

[38:41] pointed you back to the word it is
[38:43] written man shall not live by bread
[38:45] alone but by every word never seen
