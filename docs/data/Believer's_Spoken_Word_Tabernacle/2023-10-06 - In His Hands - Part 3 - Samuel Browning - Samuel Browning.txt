Lord be it according to Thy word amen be it according to your thoughts Lord not my will not my thoughts but your thoughts aren't you glad that we have that promise that where Paul would write just reminding us of that great working that lays within us and he says according now unto him who is able to do exceedingly above all that we could think or ask praise God and unto him be glory in the church by Jesus Christ forever aren't you glad that's reality how many things that he's done beyond what Samuel's thoughts beyond what your thoughts beyond what I could even ask God Specializes in making himself known that he's God and every situation that he shows himself in our life it's to further build our faith that when we rise to another situation to remember he's still God Amen the giant might look different from the bear the bear looks different from the lion but he's still the same God that's right amen don't you love him tonight amen let's just go to the Lord in a word of prayer I had two prayer cloths here that brother Gomez had asked me to pray over and uh would ask you just to join with me in prayer as well Heavenly Father Lord as we're just so thankful for these moments that you allow us to have lord lord it's according to your word that we would gather together Lord with an expectation Lord a rest in our hearts that where two or three are gathered together in your name here you are in the midst of us Lord there's no greater request that we could have because Lord in you and with you all all things are possible it really doesn't matter the request or the need sometimes Lord my it's just Lord to our mind in our way of thinking we can look at it and we can see the limitations as far as in the humanity but God when we look to you and that's where we look as Believers Lord we look to you father and there is no limitations there Lord and Lord frankly as your Prophet Lord would quote that scripture that Lord if we can believe all things are possible and your Prophet would turn around in the Easter seal in 1965 and say and you as a Believer there's nothing impossible with you Lord we know that that is much deeper than just our flesh but we're coming to realize more and more that this guy that we take care of and pack around that's not the real us that's just like a screen that allows a picture Lord to be seen on Lord oh God truly Lord when we shake hands with one another and greet one another in Christian love as your Prophet would tell us in the message Shalom we are shaking hands with the attributes of God lord Jesus how we thank you for your mercy Lord I pray Heavenly Father tonight that as we hold this prayer cloth and the needs that are held in the hearts Lord of your children tonight may you come Lord I pray God in such a manner and a way Lord that even even when these prayer cloths Lord would be placed for that need Lord to know that God that you are a Mindful and a faithful merciful high priest God I pray that it would go straight to the mark Lord For What the request is that lays there Lord we know that there is absolutely nothing impossible there's nothing Beyond with you Lord father if it's sickness of the body sickness of the Mind sickness Lord God of the spirit and sickness of the Soul whatever it might be you're the Lord that Health all our diseases Lord I pray that God is its place there Lord by faith May Lord God every Spirit every Lord hold that would be present Lord may it turn loose Lord to recognize the presence of almighty God that same quickening power and Lord even here tonight with the request that we hold in our hearts Lord that oh God that father every hold would be broken Lord that we would receive Lord the inspiration from you Lord that we're standing in need of Lord may you move for every need Lord among us tonight Lord for we need you father we love you and we thank you now in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen amen God bless you tonight as you turn in your Bibles Amen to John the 23rd chapter or not John sorry job the 23rd chapter there I just want to remind you as you're turning there that we'll have the communion service on Sunday and that will follow uh the ministering uh portion of the service and uh of course we'll give an opportunity for uh any lives any hearts that want to be prayed for or a heart that maybe wants to come to the Lord or uh however that God would work and and I told you I would try to be very mindful of the time we're going to try this like this this time I I can't promise that it would stay that way I'm just going to try and we'll just see how it goes and how how the Lord will will lead us there's a objective is so that it would try to be more convenient for everyone else as well so uh you just uh let's just be in prayer for that amen I I thank God for uh the communion Services what a wonderful time amen job 23 and I'm just going to read three vers of scripture and then we'll let you be seated I Just Want to Jump Right In on verse eight uh behold I go forward Ward but he is not there and backward but I cannot perceive him on the left hand where he doth work but I cannot Behold Him He hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him but he knoweth the way that I take and when he ha tried me I shall come forth as gold bless the Lord amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated Lord I want to just continue to speak on this part on in his hands and I just want to really draw from that verse n where we've been looking at it in that part and I um this is to me when we look at it on the left hand and on the right and we have been stressing that that God in himself it's not it's all figurative in terms of his hands it's God being involved in every part as a matter of fact there's one of the Hebrew letters that as I was reading of this even a week ago it is present within every word of God because it represents that one of those words that represents God's hand and I believe I've got the word right y or Yad however you pronounce it it's present because God is present in every part of his word because he is his word there's no one can bring the word to pass but God and to even think of even in the time that we're living in and I just look at this of how that God would this would be portrayed and set forth here in verse n i I want to just say it in this way that God he's balanced in every one of his dealings with us and all things uh there are times where we look at it like we see out here today there's wet seasons and there's dry seasons and there's Seasons that come there that's just why there's such a time you know I sometimes we look at why is there like that little bit of a dusting of snow and up here up north they have what they call winter wheat and it's got to take that little covering of snow to kind of protect that seed and that moisture then to get down there so that that wheat will be ready for Harvest in the springtime and so there's always those things that sometimes that we may not understand what's the purpose and what's the need of it but every season itself there is a purpose that God has God has every appointed season and we see that that even when we look at that as God would unfold in tight there in uh in Leviticus and he would make known the different seasons or the different uh uh Feast of the Lord they would all come in the different seasons they didn't all happen at once but they all happened in their own season and we understand that that as we step back by God's grace and look at it that it we're not just seeing Feast of the Lord but we see Christ in every verse of the scripture we're seeing God being unfolded all the way through because the feast themselves they take into the entirety of the great program of almighty God and God laid it out in type of things that he's working and doing and I I want to just draw from this to kind of lay this background in here tonight in Psalms 31:5 I think this is the greatest thing that we can ever do into thy hand I commit my spirit thou Hast redeemed me oh Lord God of Truth what a powerful thing committal is yes sir you know when we commit something and that's probably the greatest struggle that we have within our humanity is to is to commit things because we have a tendency to worry you know I I've teased some and joke with some and I've said they might not call you for a prayer request they call you for a worry request could you help me worry about this and worry now I didn't say it to anybody this is close people to me that I just kind of tease you know uh but you know when I look at it there's times that we're prone to that that in ourselves we see that within our our Humanity but you know when we're looking at things so many times this is where our Victory comes is when we can really commit things to the Lord and say I'm not going to worry about that any longer and you know I've never been too big to say God help me get to that place to where I really can commit it because as long as I keep it God can't do nothing about it but when I can commit it and that means where I've surrendered it I'm not worrying about it I put it in his hands and you know friends listen that's not a work of Samuel that's not a work of you that's saying God help me come into that place this is your word and I'm not going to worry about it no longer and this is why brother Bram would say God is all God is just trying to find someone that he can get into his hands he's always tried to do that that's God's desire as we looked at it from a few weeks ago that God's desire is to have lives that he can get into his hands God just don't want there to be lives that you know that they can experience God's healing power but yet there's no life that comes from that as far as where their life becomes a real expression of him God's desire is that our life would truly be one of his handiwork I mean God set all the stars in place he set everything in its position that's where he wrote his first Bible and God put them all there and you know what they all are known by name there's not one of them you know you didn't lose any sleep wondering with that star stay in its place or would this one fall God's got them all there and they're all set in his time and they're all declaring a purpose and so that's the same way when God desires to get us into his hands and this is where you know with thinking of that then it comes down to us that for us to give all that we have to the Lord and I I think is once again I think these are precious moments in this time that you and I can have that real personal placing with God to speak to the Lord and just say Lord I want all of my life in your hands you know friends I've never stopped asking that I've never stopped there I've never just placed it and said well all of my life is there you you know I've been born again I want all of my life in his hand I want all my actions I want my thoughts I want everything in God's hands so even brother B says your reverence your respects everything you are just put it all in God's hands in Psalms 37-5 perhap this scripture will tie a little bit more into our our subject tonight as we go along verse five commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass how do I commit my way unto the Lord It's committing my life unto him it's committing all that I am unto him it's placing it in his hands and when it's all in his hands this word commit here actually means to roll upon on one to roll so God is saying remember cast all your cares on me cuz I care for you so to put our our committal to put it upon the Lord he'll bring it to pass not I will bring it to pass not you will bring it to pass but he'll bring it to pass what will he bring to pass he'll bring to pass everything that you've committed to him God will bring it to pass all the ways everything that you commit to God God will bring it to pass verse six and he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light and thy judgment as the noon day amen I tell you everywhere you look in the word of God you should see Jesus Christ amen and when you see him you should see yourself and when you see yourself in him you find rest yes sir I just say it in this way he'll bring it to pass amen I never can I just say it this way it isn't I know we say receive the Holy Ghost but brother Bram says it two different places in the message in the 50s then he comes around in future home he says I don't think you should say I've received the Holy Ghost he said it's the holy ghost that accepts you is that right how perfect is that it's God drawing us it's God dealing with our lives it's God all along and what's happening it's you yielding it's me yielding it's god making away for himself it's not me trying to get good enough it's God working to bring me into the position that I need to be and if I can just commit my ways to the Lord then he'll bring it to pass I say it just like this you're in that channel stay in that channel keep following him and God will bring his word to pass Hallelujah because there's not a man that he should lie amen hallelujah that's so good so here in the scripture I want to just move real quickly into that of verse 9 and I want to just draw one verse from here tonight or one word on the left hand where he doth work but I cannot Behold Him He hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him probably every one of us whether you like art or not or you've had to go through some place of some art museum or and there's something that you're able to look at a picture a sculpture you know even that we look at with Michelangelo it wasn't the whole public was standing there viewing him sculpted he got a chunk of marble like how brother Ronnie preached it when he was here and I like how Michelangelo as well as other sculptors make this statement that what they saw inside of that chunk of marble Michelangelo said he saw saw Moses other sculptors say whomever they're going to do and it says it was I was commissioned to release him from that chunk of marel that's exactly what God has come to do is to release us from all of our previous moldings Hallelujah shaping amen and he removes and he works in our life but let me just tell you this right here your work the work of God in your life is not a public show good preaching that's right come on now it's an individual work between you and God hallelujah If You're Expecting just when I show up to church God come and work on me it's a daily Moment by moment hour by our work as a matter of fact the greatest deal of work is what takes place with between you and God when nobody else sees hallu thank you Lord yes sir so you know I know sometimes I've been places where you know I can remember back in the days when you go to SeaWorld when that was still open and they would uh have those Lumber jaacks out there them guys with chainsaws would carve out of the wood you know whatever it was they made they Bears sometimes and other things then I've watched them over in uh whatever you call those days is it pioneer days at Vermillion mollow I've watched them carve out uh um out of the ice blocks you know they'll take things and and carve things out of the ice blocks and what or more they wouldn't want to see what I would carve out cuz I don't have that kind of a gift not only to see it but you know to to carve it out but I just want to say all of those we had Spectators watching us right but I want to say this to you tonight that even though here we are right in the midst of a body of Believers here we are in the midst of our family here we are in the midst of our job but God is doing a work in your life and God allows glimpses of that as he sees fit Hallelujah and as a matter of fact there's many glimpses about your life that you don't even see that's good pre but God allows somebody else to testify that's good yes sir so I want to deal with that actually that latter part of that that that that you know verse and I told you this is going to come forth well it's going to be more than three parts I take that but when we look at this and it'll be a lot with the left hand here and but I cannot notice what job said I cannot Behold Him that word behold is the word to see or perceive to look behold to prophesy to see as a seer in the estatic state in that realm of vision I can't Behold Him remember job was a prophet in other words he's working but I don't know what he's doing that's good preacher I can't see him right and remember that's what the prophet said was making job worry because that's how God spoke to job was by Revelation that's so good I want to just work through here just a moment in Ezekiel 1:3 the Bible says the word of the Lord came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest the son of busai in the land of the caldas by the river Jabar and the Hand of the Lord was there upon him now watch what happens and I looked and behold a whirlwind came out of the North a great cloud and a fire infolding itself and a brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof is the color of amber out of the midst of the fire but Sam what are you saying I'm saying unless even though Ezekiel was a prophet with the word of the Lord came the hand of the Lord and when that comes together then Visions begin to open then sight is given in the hand of the Lord so the spirit in Ezekiel 3:14 so the spirit lifted me up and took me away and I went in bitterness In the Heat of my spirit but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me at that time Ezekiel was to let them know that they had to take account for their own lives in verse 22 and the Hand of the Lord was there upon me and he said unto me arise go forth into the plain and I will there talk with thee and it came to pass in the sixth year in the sixth month in the fifth day of the month as I sat in my house and the Elders of Judah sat before me that the hand of the Lord God fell there upon me in Ezekiel 371 the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of Bones I I'm not going through all these passages but I'm just trying to make a point here here tonight that is the hand of the Lord there's a purpose when the hand of the Lord comes upon your life and the Hand of the Lord was here breaking forth in that realm that he says as job said he's working but I cannot Behold Him and Ezekiel didn't make this happen but Ezekiel was in a place that the hand of the Lord could come upon him you see that's what's important is being in a place that the hand of the Lord can come upon you that's why we want our lives lined up with the word of all that we can know Lord I Want My Life lined up with your word because when it's lined up with God's word and it takes his grace to help us and to direct us if there's things that's beyond our understanding or knowledge of it and when we're lined up we're in position for the hand of the Lord to move Upon Our Lives let me just say it to you like this if the hand of the Lord carried Ezekiel and showed him the valley of dry bones and showed him what looked like an impossibility where there would be Bones come together and not only bones but flesh and senu and muscle and then there would be life that would come into that body that same hand of the Lord is upon your life tonight has come upon this generation not to give you a vision of defeat but a vision of victory a vision to let you know you're more than a conqueror and you are his [Applause] workmanship Hallelujah yes sir Hallelujah BR says like this an impersonation of Christianity I love this quote said God likened the prophet to the eagle that would go into the makeup of a prophet he's a Seer and in the spirit he climbs beyond the emotion of the church he goes beyond the rhythm of the music he goes beyond the Clapping of the hand he goes beyond the joy among the saints he goes beyond all that what does it a prophet God brings him up into a realm alone alone then he opens his eye and he lets him look around and see things that is to come then he brings him back down among the members of the body to forell them of what is in the making so good are you hearing me yes sir to tell them of what's in the making these visions that I read to you even out of the Book of Ezekiel a number of them even with the valley of dried bones we understand that spiritually speaks of the Bride of Jesus Christ and we're standing in that hour right now but that also speaks of the the house of Israel is that right think about how many how many years and years ago that was but a prophet and look Moses was taken up was he not he was caught up into the clowns that right Paul said I was caught up into the third heaven John on the Book of Revelation he got into the spirit and he saw the coming of the lord well did he see the coming of the Lord he saw the coming of the holy ghost in a bride body he saw the coming of the Lord he saw the climax of it all what did that it took God to raise up a prophet and open his eye amen well why did God get that prophet and open his eye it is not for the prophet's benefit that's for you that's for me why God sends a prophet is not to show off God sends a prophet to deliver a word to a predestinated people in that hour to announce to them the move is on and I'm working to bring my word to pass whether you feel it or not I'm still working amen amen BR said God he took Ezekiel far up he let him see 2600 years think of it a prophet is also a gift of knowledge no he's not just confined to that he like an attorney who studies the books and when you go to hire an attorney to plead your case he's only taking what he knows and you're paying him for what he knows to present your case before the judge I could preach on that but I've got to go now a gift of knowledge in the Bible is prophecy which goes up and finds out these things that are to come and brings them back down but they must compare with the Bible with the book if they're out of the book then then they're not received because the judge judges by the book you see so it must be on the word oh my God I could preach there for a minute too but I just I I got to go on you see because this is where brother Bram says prophecy is to be judged by two or three but nobody sets before a prophet God's already Vindicated what are you saying brother Samuel I'm not God as I've said it over and over for for years that God has not called me to take my time to try to prove and authenticate statements God himself has Vindicated this message you understand we got to recognize the devil at every one of his tactics Satan when love our time is precious the Bible said redeeming our time notice the word of God has been spoken before the foundation of the world I watch watch this now with the prophet it isn't that God speaks and says something to the prophet at that time it is the prophet catches what God has already said for the word was before the foundation of the world God spoke the word and it's laying look at that and it's laying way out stretched out in time and the prophet goes up and sees the time coming so it's only a gift of knowledge that he brings it down and puts it on paper and I Daniel understood by the books aren't you glad for the books amen notice this in Proverbs 29: 18 when there is no vision the people perish or become loose or naked this very word perish is the same word of what Aaron and them did when they presented the golden calf they made the people naked how by taking another way God provides the weding Garment God provides the robe of righteousness God himself has provided our wedding garment is that right and to deny that and turn away from it is nakedness and then one is left to their own devices they're left to their own reasonings oh friends we are a blessed people that we're not walking by our own reasonings anymore you know what that means that means you don't have to guess about the Holy Ghost God has made it real and sure in this hour God Knocking at Your Heart it's a sure promise you're included in it just open up and receive it where there's no vision the people perish so without a vision you know Visions leadership and God has given a clear leadership in his promise that's why you see when God has done something that is so promised in the word this message is not outside of the word if it was we wouldn't be for it but this is God's word as a matter of let me call it just like this it's the secret that God mentioned and declared in his word and he laid it out in Tights laid it out in Shadows and he laid it out even in Luke 17 among other many other places that even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed it's a secret Hallelujah and yet it's happening I mean our doors are not closed to anybody coming in here right our desire is Lord that all would know the same Liberty that God has brought into my life that they would know the Lord Jesus in the same saving Soul cleansing way that he has touched my life that he's a living reality that it's not it's not I that live in but it's Christ that liveth in me but it's a secret yet God has opened that secret amen but remember in the scripture where it says my people perish for a lack of knowledge and the next phrase of that is because they reject the knowledge what is the knowledge the knowledge of the truth what is the knowledge of the truth it's the person of Jesus Christ it's the Holy Ghost the word they reject that but oh I'm glad I I'm thankful that it wasn't nothing that I had anything to do with Brother Sam you had to make a choice but my choice reflected a choice that was made before the foundation of the world Amen are you with me you you say oh brother Samuel well what does that have to do because it's putting it all in God's hands if you take it and put it in your hands then you've got the rest of your walk in your hands but when you can see predestination the right way you recognize you're not here but accident I don't care what Mom and Dad if whatever's been told to you I was an accident you're not an accident even if the way that you came into this Earth may not have been a way that would have been celebrated but the seed itself Still Remains [Music] true Hallelujah yes sir prise the Lord that's why the prophet could say it like this in six-fold purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel they're talking about this end time message there's a power and a vision behind it a word of God that's been revealed to get the church in order for the Rapture and the going home I'm grateful for the hand of the Lord God has showed even in think of it in this age we're living in we have went from horse and buggy right to automobile to airplane to Astron right there have been four stages in one age that's amazing yes sir and God promised there would come he let it be shown in in the natural that here where you had that of the astronaut where it escaped the hold of the earth they they they they were able to get into that to that rocket to get into that ship that shuttle however you want to say it and they were able to have the throttle power that was needed with the fuel that would be able to thrust it so that it would be able to escape the gravitation and be able to move beyond that of the earth and to look down on it wow and God in this hour yes he had promised an astronaut and God has supplied and that astronut is none under none other than Jesus Christ himself revealed in the message of Malachi 4 that he's the same God you say how is he revealed because he's not bound and Tied by the Creeds and dogmas of a man he's not held by the gravitational pull of a seminary or a Doctrine but it is that which has escaped all of those boundaries oh my and just as that word has been presented to you and I it's to announce to you and I the countdown and all is on and we are astronauts in him yes sir brother and sister we're not just escaping denominationalism we're escaping our own selves that's right greatest b f brother said God's calling Abraham's seed to se from seed taste feel smell here conscience memory reason affection to walk completely relying on God Lord I'm talking about astronauts who not going to be held down by memories of the failure not held down by reasoning not held down but released and free in God this is why when this message that we're under in Revelations 18 when it speaks of that great and mighty angel that came down and that strong Angel began to Proclaim Babylon Babylon the greatest fallen and then it goes on to say in verse four and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people and be not a partakers of and receive don't be a partaker of her sins and don't receive any of her plagues brother BR says it clearly I I love this as it brings it into the Highlight that that messenger's voice not the human voice but God sounded it through a human vessel and that voice was so inclined with God that heaven echoed the same thing why because this message is not a message of Earthly origin it's a message of heavenly origin brother Samuel I thought we're in job 23 that's what I'm preaching on here tonight if you can recognize that it's we are not living under the means of an Earthly work you are Birth by Heavenly work of almighty God it's God bringing his word to pass and what he's doing he's not fumbling around and figuring it out as he goes That's you and me we figure it out as we go oh I got to go home deepo for this oh I better call brother so for this I got it overhead God ain't fumbling around though we may not see it or understand it he still working he's right on time [Music] that's good let me read that again in job 23:9 on the left hand where he does work but I cannot Behold Him we can't always see what God's doing right we'd like to let's just be honest like job we'd like to Oh Brother Samuel I'm not a prophet though I know but I want you to understand the prophet said once you've been born of the spirit of God you are our citizen citizen of two Dimensions he said now you have opened you have come into a place to receive Angelic visitations Revelation book of symbols for the spirit of God to come and reveal his word to you don't you realize it is not when you stand here and say oh brother so- and so preach that it was brother so- and so that revealed it it's God that reveals it it's God that opens understanding just like God catches the prophet up then opens his eyes that he can see the same way God does the messenger is the same way he does you and I and he does it just as we have need of it God don't always let us know every little step of the way kind of like you know you or me or somebody's planning a party for somebody else a birthday party like hey you got this you got that you got this you got that you got this and you're planning every step of the way God already has this already planned out but he's not letting you and I know every step of the the way God doesn't need our assistance he just needs us to be yielded in his hands amen because God has such a authentic way of proving his word that it must be him doing it through surrendered vessels so it's undeniable that's God it's undeniable when you can look and say it's God it ain't me oh my so think of it you know even how the prophet remember when brother Bram went to pray for that that that that little lady that was dying with that ureic poison she had you know was carrying a child and things like that remember that just a long story short of how that uh when brother Brandon have prayed for and the Lord went ahead and took her home remember brother brand told the Lord you owe me an explanation brother brah said don't ever say that to God he said God don't owe you nothing he said he don't mean nothing glory be to God he said he let he let me just sit and stew about it for a while oh my I'm glad those examples are included in there I'm real real glad BL Samu don't that trouble you no not a bit the humanity of brother bam don't bother me I only lets me see God more clearly are you with me that's the same way in you and me but sometimes we determine our Victory based on our Humanity in your Humanity you'll never be victorious but it's in Christ it's his spirit in you it's you in the inside that's the Overcomer that has to wrestle with yourself wrestle with your thoughts and bring this outer man into subjection constantly and God don't tell His prophets everything he does think about think about it if God would have told Jacob hey your boy they ain't nothing but a bunch of liars I'll tell you where he's at he's a Prophet come on God told Samuel Saul you'll find you'll find your your donkeys over there God knows where they're at right God knew where Joseph was at right are you hearing me but what if he' had told Jacob that buddy he'd have been in Egypt to get him come on which one of you is a parent oh oh brother Samuel Jacob would have just said God you've got some bigger plans God didn't tell Jacob got a bigger plan oh boy sometimes I'd like to be in on them Secrets wouldn't it it don't mean that it would stop us from nail biting right right but you see it still requires trust and faith even when we don't know what's taking place is that right now God doesn't tell them everything but you know so when you think of this of how let me just read this how brother BR says and I've have heard but now I see I love this message he said job was a prophet in this day and the only thing God had done to job was always give him wisdom and his word and inspiration he could get no inspiration but he knowed all of his mechanics he had offered the burnt offering he had done everything he knowed to do was right that's what's important I I could probably ask all throughout this congregation who who desires to see God move in your life this is the very basis of where you check if you know know that you've got everything right as far as what God has showed you then you can stand waiting for inspiration on are you hearing me it's just like coming to be prayed for if you got sin in your life God will never move over top of that sin anything that's unconfessed that's why even in the giving of the Holy Ghost unless there is that part on the inside that really is dying and death to self that complete death it will never never come but let me just tell you something if he had to lead the first lamb to the slaughter what makes you think he's going to do you any different he had to lead me to slaughter he had to lead you you understand it goes back to what we said on Sunday God has never done anything that asked you to do that he had do himself that's that's why brother Bram could say when he came to the River Jordan to be baptized brother Ram says notice he was already the lamb right brother B says I wonder sometimes when the words going forth wonder he says when God is ready to pour out of his Spirit he said I wonder if it's because we're not being Lambs because the spirit of the dove will always come to the lamb Oh Brother Sam are you saying I'm not a lamb no I'm just saying sometimes you allow that wolf to rule over that right there but as a lamb you've got to recognize who you are and recognize what belongs to you and say God lead me to the slaughter lead me to the place that nothing else matters outside of you but he couldn't get a look at this but he couldn't get a word from God oh I love that this this is what I love not that he couldn't get a word from God I love this next part but the devil couldn't move him right he couldn't get a word no vision breaking no inspiration hey what's going on I don't know right I don't know hey but you're a prophet I don't know see added pressure you're a prophet you've helped me out before God's used you to help me out God's used you to show but what's he doing I don't know I don't know what he's doing but he couldn't move job off of the Revelation amen that he had in his heart given by God you understand what that was the right hand of God that in the midst of that time while the left hand is working the right hand David said upholdeth me Glory watch out brother BR brings us down to Everyday living there you are when you're prayed for you don't have to run back through a line or go let somebody else pray for you when you know you've done exactly what God told you to do see then wait for that channel of inspiration to open to you now I'm Healed and when it drops in there it's all over you don't need no prayer lines nothing else it's over it's been revealed to you oh my my Bri let if you would skip to there's a paragraph there it starts out with the word when no wait wait wait wait uh yeah go back up to the word where it says but but he alone talking of job here but he alone job knew he was right his pulsation of faith of hearing God's word speak to him he knew it was the truth he knew God's voice nobody could fool him on it for he knew it not even all of his friends quoting scripture but job knew there's a difference are you understanding me there's a difference between just written word and God's voice God's mind is his word is that right this is his will but it's not left open to interpretation Amen in other words God didn't put it in the hands of man for man to try to apply it the way he feels like he should apply it but God himself him he comes down and he shows us how to apply it that's why we're living in an hour whatsoever the son the father doeth that doeth the son likewise amen God opening and revealing himself showing you and I where to apply the word and how to apply it that's friends I just tell you as simple as I can say it we wouldn't even know how to cross a fence if God hadn't given us Grace in this hour amen the simplest of things that we could see would be so simple and yet it lays right there and God comes right forth and reveals it thank you Jesus watch this watch this statement he said watch something's revealed to you maybe contrary to what the people think watch what he says now I'm speaking in the line of prophets CU prophets are speaking the thoughts of God it might seem contrary to the thinking of man but remember a prophet is caught Beyond how many ever tried to see inside a circus or something you tried to see inside somewhere come on everybody in here has tried one time or another tried to see into something and we're sitting there and then you get one of the tall lanky boys you know and they get up there and they can you know a little bit more but you see a prophet is where the ring Master himself of the circus comes out gets a hold of him and lifts him up so a prophet ain't lifted up there by his own strength amen he didn't bring himself up there and he has to wait until God gets done showing him all he wants to show him and when he gets done showing him all he wants to show him he wants him to turn around and tell the others what he has saw and when that's told it'll have an effect upon the others am that's the power behind this message brother that's why it has a power behind it a vision behind it that's why it has an effect Upon Our Lives let me go on here when when it's God reveals something if there ever is a secret comes out from God to be know made known to the people it'll never come through a seminary it'll never come through a group of people never did it always will has and will through one individual a prophet Amos 3:7 the Lord does nothing except first he reveals it through His prophets right that is a powerful important verse God ain't going to work he ain't going to work out nothing unless he spoke it through His prophets and when God speaks it he is speaking of what is already a finished work I'm going to bring this to pass don't expect it to be Lord I want a lot of right-hand days the bulk of your journey is a left-hand Journey it's God working working working working working working brother Samuel I need rightand days just take a look around you're standing aren't you that's his right hand it's the power of God it's holding you in the midst of all the working if his life if your life was not in his hands you wouldn't be able to stand the first test the first trial the first little thing comes along oh I got a hang nail when I open the bathroom door I ain't going to come back to church no more first little thing comes along but because the right hand is upon your life there's one that anchors you and holds you stabilizes you through the midst of the storm through the test and trial but the left hand is working God does nothing except first he reveals it let me just try to bring this down I want to just drop this in here as we look at this because all that God is working out in your life and my life I want you to remember these three words God has spoken right God ain't going to take it back God ain't going to say oops I made a mistake I should have never spoken that over this generation nope God has spoken amen amen this word has come to a predestinated people it's no accident that's right that it's come across your life that's right are you hearing me now I want you to consider this look at this for our own lives Hebrews 2:8 thou Hast put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put all in sub ection under him he left what's that word nothing brother brother Dave's the only one with me if I had some kind of token or treat brother Dave he was right with me he left nothing that is not put under him right key but now we see not yet all things put under him you may not behold it or see it but it's already done all of everything it's all finished in him when he said it is finished amen but here's what we do see and this is what important but we see ourselves no that ain't important right but we see Jesus right well what do but we see Jesus yes the mighty conqueror who conquered both the scene and unseen Realms we see him who paid the price for us and who rose again and sent back the Holy Ghost we see him who is the mighty conqueror we see him and that's where we're looking amen hallelujah where am I looking I'm looking at a battle that cannot be lost why cuz both of his hands was nailed up and I'm in his hands and brother let me tell you they had to keep up Moses hands but those men got tired and they let them down but not the hands of our Lord Jesus they are not let down brother it's still standing in a banner of victory tonight we see Jesus amen oh my you see the Bible says in Revelations 1:16 I'm I'm coming down and he had in his right hand Seven Stars now what's John seeing the vision of the mighty conqueror he's seeing the coming of the Lord coming right in his bride body calling a people out of every age for his name sake like Joseph was given a gentile bride so is Christ Hallelujah taking a bride and he and he has upon his vesture a name that is called the word of God what did they call Joseph zapan panel which means the revealer of the secret things Hallelujah he had in his right hand Seven Stars right hand power and authority these Messengers these stars have all the power and authority of the godhead behind them brother Samuel what is that a message a word word that cannot fail a word that has not painted defeat to you that's right but it's painted Victory this ain't a pie in the sky remember a prophet goes beyond even the joy of the Saints goes beyond the music goes beyond the Clapping of the hands it goes beyond your emotions and you know what brother Samuel what are you saying by that I'm glad because it goes beyond even the times that I feel down it goes beyond the times that even that I may not feel feel like it it goes beyond that this is a word that is not based on your feelings this vision is not based on your Humanity of whether you can make it come to pass this is thus saith the Lord your emotions God has called a message up and announced it to you and I if you could take it tonight I don't care where you're sitting at tonight if you could take whatever promise of God and you take a hold of that promise let it take a hold of you and you let that word it power and authority behind it let me tell you something friends it'll begin to move your thoughts right now it'll begin to divor cause you to divorce thoughts of doubt and defeat and skepticism if you can receive it this word has transforming power within it brother it'll lift you beyond your circumstances it'll let you see yourself Victorious but s you don't know the condition I'm sitting in right now quit looking at your condition you'll never get anywhere that's right if you'll look to him that's acknowledging you need help that's right I need help Lord amen he's my helper am and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me now notice when the right hand came upon him there was something to be said fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I'm alive forever more and have the keys of hell and of death oh brother brandom could say it like that what is there to fear the Judgment that fell upon him at the cross at the grave and when he descended was for us he absorbed the full brunt of the wound of sin and there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus for aurity he is our attorney he is our judge he is both attorney and judge and as a judge what better what what come on Friends what better could you get he was a judge came down and became our attorney God became flesh and paid the price am amen can I say it like the prophet said it in the token case dismissed that's what this message is an announcement case dismissed if you allow the Holy Spirit he'll come right to your life he'll announce it personally case [Music] dismissed Glory I feel like running Brandon go to that go to that very next quote there uh uh the same one patma Vision bless her heart she's running all over the place on me don't fear John Don't Fear Little Flock all that I am you are heir to oh my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst I love this I have not come to bring fear and failure laid his right hand upon me I have not come to bring fear and failure brother samel I'm I'm feeling fearful listen the presence of God has not come to make you fearful and listen don't be afraid of the very thing you need to embrace the very thing that'll relieve you of fear the very thing then when fear wants to try to come into your life when doctor's reports and anything else come you've got a strength that'll put P fear back in its place and say you're Crossing on territory that's occupied by Divine love love there is no room for fear here get out what does that perfect love cast out fear it don't just ask it to leave it throws it out and I don't care where you land I don't care if you land on your head land on your nose land on your back it cast it out and that word cast out means you throw it behind your back and don't care where it lands I have not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability won't you love him yes sir that's good let me end with this this point in thinking of our scripture tonight just because that God has not revealed what he is doing at the moment in your life around the bride think think of this to me this is overwhelming it really is to think about it of how God great our God is that he's working in individual lives amen now I don't know about you but to me when I tght school I wanted all the Ducks lined up in a row I don't want stragglers I don't want people playing in the classroom but how God has everything held right together where there's lives and justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost God on Fret a bit you know why God's working all things after the counsel of his own will God's working think about it around the world the bride body is being brought into Perfection that's so good around the world believe in assemblies and in our individual life and God is working in your life working in my life listen friends as I I say it again I say it again by the word of the Lord no matter where you're at if God is working in your life stay with him and let him work it all out that's the trth don't get your eyes off of him keep your eyes on him he will continue to lead you all the way no matter what what what it is the vision is still in effect he's still working kind of like the song even when I don't see him he's still working amen right but BR would say it kind of like this and I just he talks about a dream that um brother Junior Jackson and you know brother Brown would put it like this he says now we don't he said there's been many dreams that brother Jackson has received he said of the Lord he said that is has come to pass he said but I don't know he said God's kept this from me it was when brother Jackson went clear to Louisiana when brother Bram was preaching him last few meetings he just woke up you know he woke up he seen the pillar of Fire coming in he he never been to the building at Life Tabernacle he just he saw a building the Lord showed him a building in a dream and saw a pillar of Fire coming in there and saw and heard thunderings going out and people were you know laying out on the ground and just you know giving their all to the Lord Brother Jackson at that time he got on a plane with his wife and they came down there said I don't know what's going to happen and brother brandham he just says it like this this is to me as a principle see brother brandom just because a dream itself is one of those things that just like no doubt there's others in here that's had dreams I've had dreams that that's been many times of an area the way that God has spoke to me with things in the church or things individually but I'll tell you any time there's been something coming I don't look at it it's thus sayith the Lord I just wait because if it's of God he'll bring it to pass and then he'll tap me on the shoulder and say this is what I showed you that's why he's worked with me but how brother brandham put that within a dream brother Bram once saying it was thus sayith the Lord but I this is something that's very important that with any word that's been given or anything and brother BR would say it like like this he says Dear God In Prayer just let me just refer to this dear God thou Hast kept it a secret from me about this dream what this means I don't know but if you shall visit us Lord prepare our hearts now for that visit oh wonderful wow I just think we can close on that part of it God has given a word that we never I just said like this I can I told you before I can remember sitting around with well I wasn't sitting around with Brother Ray and my dad then we Benjamin and I were playing with blocks on the floor not my Benjamin but Benjamin Ericson and um but they you know everybody looking look they've been looking for the coming of the Lord you'd hear you know I remember hearing a little boy where people thought man didn't think we'd be here either this year didn't think we'd see this year didn't think we'd see this year why because this is an end time message that God has promised and we're here right we don't know how many more moments that we have individually and collectively as the bride body but whatever God is doing and whatever it is that God is bringing to pass and it's his word that he's bringing to pass in our life I believe we all can join together with this tonight is Lord prepare my heart to be in a place for that inspiration to strike because one thing for sure this message is not a dream sir the Rapture is not a dream amen the Rapture is thus sayith the Lord and the prophet said the bride will be waiting on that Revelation amen she's walking under the effects of it now but there'll come a final quickening is that right so what do we want to do Lord let my heart be prepared for that moment and you know what he prepares our hearts when we don't feel it we don't see it we see not all things but we see Jesus amen amen and that's what's important is we see him the word because the word cannot fail amen don't you love him oh friends tonight commit thy way unto the Lord if you're when you look in your life be sure where you're standing and then when you're standing Look to Him Amen in those moments just like job I'm sure none of us are any different these are moments that the prophet said because job wasn't receiving inspiration it was worrying him anybody ever felt that way Lord I I'm just looking for an answer oh yes looking for an answer and it was worrying I I'm glad these these things are included in here that you and I can look at and say yep I'm I'm right on track I'm not an oddball it's right on track it doesn't mean that we welcome worrying but we just you know what God helps us to see you're still housed in this humanity and where he comes to help us to look Beyond this Humanity am that's why friends a message of Earthly origin could never have got us Beyond this right here it couldn't have got us Beyond it took a Heavenly message in this hour you know why it's time for Rapture that's right it's time for Rapture amen you love him let's pray father Lord I'm sure that throughout this building here tonight Lord that we have all been in those places and those moments even tonight Lord even tonight I I thank Lord as many times I stand and I preach sometimes Lord I stand and looking at things that we're presently Lord God seeing your grace Lord making yourself known to encourage us as your children experiences Lord that we passed through Lord I pray that God here tonight May Lord as we have just been graced by your presence for a few moments that Lord that we're are able to look Beyond of this realm and to Lord be able to look and to see the big picture now I Lord truthfully Lord I don't there's things Lord that even that I know you're working out in my life I don't see it I don't see it I don't know what you're doing there's things that we could Lord testify throughout this congregation Lord but father I think Lord what you've spoke to us tonight is to trust you that Lord when that Vision lord of the word has broken over our life it's things that Lord that you see the end from the beginning it's you working it out Lord Lord even this moment this moment it's a predestinated moment yeah Lord you would arrange things so particularly Lord even to move down lord to cause our our hearts to be inclined to your voice Lord that's what that's what we want Lord May every one of our hearts be inclined with your word Lord Lord I pray tonight Lord if there's one Lord outside of the fold if they're not even in that place of Journey May Lord it be a moment that God that they would see see you see what you have done for them what what you have made possible Lord God that may it grip their heart in conviction that would cause them to surrender to the vision of Calvary breaking forth over their life Lord surrender to the Mighty God lord I pray right here tonight Lord you've said it throughout the message that no matter Lord where that life is at in Journey May they keep walking with their eyes on you Lord May Lord it be that taking their the word that you're speaking Lord how could we even know unless Lord God you would speak to us they asked you on the day of Pentecost what must we do to be saved Lord many times we can rehearse those if we've sat Lord in a message church for years we can rehearse it sometimes lord it's where you help us to see the condition that was present in the heart of those individuals and that is Lambs that were led to the slaughter ready to die to their own selves not just want to remedy for the situation of the Sorrows they in but willing to forsake to lose as the scripture said their own [Music] life God I know you to be that personal I pray tonight Lord may we not be too big that Lord whatever it might be if it's a committal of a request may we be that simple to say Lord lead me to that place to where I can stop fretting about this problem stop worrying about it lord it's got me all worried but Lord God I'm
