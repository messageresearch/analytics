[16:57] Lord and father we just give ourselves
[17:00] to you Lord that you would have your way
[17:02] tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus
[17:04] Christ amen
[17:06] god bless yous your being seated tonight
[17:09] I
[17:11] want to speak to you tonight on thought
[17:15] just continuing a little bit from last
[17:17] weekend and to just take that thought on
[17:21] God permits with a purpose
[17:25] to understand that there's nothing that
[17:29] can come our way as a child of God
[17:33] unless God first
[17:36] permits it God
[17:39] he we know that he permits those things
[17:43] and things to come our way with a
[17:46] purpose in mind
[17:47] even as we look at it here just a little
[17:51] bit I want to deal with it just a little
[17:53] with how that God would permit this time
[17:58] here for or Jacob to arise to get him
[18:02] back into place to get him back into
[18:04] position you find of how that God was
[18:07] already dealing with Jacob's life but
[18:10] yet think of how that Laban was able to
[18:13] come to him and able to persuade him to
[18:16] stay a little bit longer but God here in
[18:20] this time there is not gonna be any more
[18:22] persuasion of him staying any longer as
[18:26] a matter of fact as you read later on
[18:27] down in the scripture God is very
[18:29] affirmative and clear when he tells
[18:31] Laban by a dream I don't want you to
[18:33] speak good nor bad
[18:36] I don't want Jacob to find no refuge in
[18:40] words that you would speak and so how
[18:44] that we find that within it that how
[18:47] that God has already been dealing with
[18:50] Jacob's heart to turn Jacob's heart back
[18:53] to going back home and to see how that
[18:57] God allows as we've looked at it here
[18:59] for some time a countenance and things
[19:02] to turn against Jacob where Jacob begins
[19:05] to notice it and it's taking into a
[19:08] place to where the comfort that Jacob
[19:11] has known from Laban and how that Laban
[19:13] has looked at him before God is removing
[19:16] all the comfort that would further calls
[19:19] Jacob to look back to this a home and
[19:22] now you find how that God speaks
[19:25] directly to Jacob it's not just
[19:27] something where the Holy Spirit is
[19:28] dealing with his heart but God tells him
[19:31] to arise and get back unto the land of
[19:35] thy kindred and finding of how that God
[19:38] is turning then the whole the whole
[19:40] household to where Rachel and Leah that
[19:43] how that they themselves are are looking
[19:45] no longer at where they have known all
[19:48] their life to be home they're no longer
[19:50] looking at this as home but they read
[19:54] they look at themselves now in this
[19:56] place of where they have sojourned and
[19:58] known all this time they look and
[20:01] recognize are we not but strangers
[20:04] dwelling here so there's nothing god is
[20:07] removing all the comfort all around and
[20:10] and we know that when we are looking at
[20:12] this here if I can just just deal with
[20:15] this just a little bit we know that even
[20:17] within this here that when you you think
[20:20] of it of how that God would would even
[20:23] permit the time to arise were Esau you
[20:27] remember was breathing threatenings
[20:29] regarding Jacob and if that had not been
[20:31] think of this would Jacob have ever left
[20:35] the land and you think and say well if
[20:37] he had never left the land you know he
[20:39] was in the land but yet if he had never
[20:41] left there he would have never have met
[20:44] God in Bethel for himself so we would
[20:49] have been there would have been no
[20:50] recollection where God could let him
[20:52] know I am the God of beth-el so God had
[20:55] to allow that to take place you know in
[20:58] times in our life when we look at many
[21:00] times when they the greatest fulfillment
[21:02] of things are are taking place and I'm
[21:05] talking about not only just for the
[21:07] bride as far as a body but even in our
[21:10] own lives where God will permit things
[21:13] to take place that moves us in position
[21:15] when you think of how that even as the
[21:19] time of where of the Lord Jesus and the
[21:21] birth was drawing near to think of how
[21:24] that at this time God would let
[21:25] inspiration move down that would
[21:27] actually calls Herod to say let every
[21:30] man return into the city of his birth
[21:32] and you recognize that even though that
[21:35] was something that was political that
[21:37] was given but yet within it God allowed
[21:40] and permitted the influence to come upon
[21:43] Herod that in order that Mary and Joseph
[21:46] would come back into that place that the
[21:49] scripture might be fulfilled there are
[21:52] things that God has desire to be
[21:55] fulfilled in our life and there is a
[21:57] certain position and now sometimes we
[22:00] look and say well is it here is it there
[22:02] but it's it's more in our lives with a
[22:04] condition that God would have in our
[22:06] lives a position of our heart a position
[22:09] of our mind a position of our spirit
[22:11] sometimes there are things that God has
[22:14] within the physical the localities and
[22:16] all those things we we see that even
[22:18] within how that God would have the
[22:20] Prophet go west but I want to deal with
[22:23] this tonight in looking at how that you
[22:25] know the the the Prophet Hosea picks
[22:28] this up in I Hosea six and I'm not gonna
[22:30] dwell very long upon this but to think
[22:33] of how that the Prophet would give the
[22:36] unction and prophesy wherein that this
[22:38] would be the echo that would be among
[22:41] the the the elected Jews of God and the
[22:44] Jews coming back into the homeland we're
[22:46] in that they would say come and let us
[22:49] return unto the Lord for he hath torn
[22:52] and he will heal us for he had smitten
[22:55] and he will bind us up and after two
[22:57] days he will revive us and in the third
[23:00] day he will raise us up and we shall
[23:02] live in his sight and then shall we know
[23:04] if we follow on to know the Lord his
[23:07] going forth is prepared as the morning
[23:09] and he shall come unto us as the rain
[23:11] and as the ladder in the former rain
[23:13] unto the earth and think of even when
[23:15] you you you look at these things of how
[23:18] that God had made a promise every time
[23:20] when Israel would be exiled from the
[23:24] land yet God would lay it forth in his
[23:26] word that there indeed would be a return
[23:29] but yet the return itself was not
[23:31] something that was just by mere
[23:34] intellect of looking and saying well
[23:36] this is a time but there's God always in
[23:40] his time when it's time for his word to
[23:42] be fulfilled not only are there signs
[23:44] that correspond with that but in order
[23:47] to recognize those signs and able to see
[23:50] where we're at it takes the unction of
[23:53] the Holy Spirit and Friends it brings it
[23:55] down to this without that unction of the
[23:58] Holy Spirit and there being a receptive
[24:00] part in our life and ordained for this
[24:03] moment we could see a lot of signs and
[24:05] yet not know what it means to us because
[24:08] you can talk to many people in the world
[24:10] and they know there's people you can
[24:12] talk to and they'll tell you we're in
[24:14] the end time they'll tell you we're in
[24:16] the coming of the Lord but you see there
[24:18] has to be something that's able to
[24:21] interpret for you let me just say it
[24:22] like this it's like being in a mall and
[24:25] where you want to know I want to get to
[24:26] this store well you know I know I'm in a
[24:28] mall I don't need nobody to tell me I'm
[24:31] in a mall but where I need to know if in
[24:33] order to get to the store I didn't want
[24:35] to go to I need to know where I am and
[24:38] if I know where I am and I can see then
[24:41] on a map where I need to go to I can
[24:43] find my way there and that's the way the
[24:46] Spirit of God is lets us know by way of
[24:48] his word where we're at that's why that
[24:51] the message that God has sent in this
[24:53] endtime is not just another message but
[24:56] it is the very message of the atonement
[24:58] that lets you and I know who we are
[25:01] where we are and where we're going hey
[25:04] man it has already is that we're
[25:07] certainly and it declares it has a
[25:09] meaning to you and I the message is not
[25:11] doctrines to you and I it is not
[25:13] teachings to you and I the message is
[25:16] the person of Jesus Christ revealed to
[25:19] us in this hour it stirs our hearts unto
[25:23] him because listen friends many can love
[25:25] the doctrines and yet not love him
[25:28] they can meet doctrines and yet not meet
[25:31] him this is not about doctrines this is
[25:35] about him the Bible said to receive the
[25:38] love of the truth
[25:40] amen that's where when we look at this
[25:43] of how that God would permit that this
[25:47] would this would begin to resonate
[25:49] within the hearts of the Jews and how
[25:52] that you know brother Anna will pick
[25:54] this up and he talks about how that God
[25:56] would you know permit the things to
[25:58] happen he talks about the bitter Pierce
[26:01] of persecution that coming against
[26:03] Israel and and any you know it when you
[26:06] look at it you you find everything of
[26:08] how that there is sense that is made of
[26:11] it within the word that it's God calling
[26:14] Israel back home to the atonement and to
[26:17] think of it like this that here within
[26:19] this hour that we are living in and in
[26:22] this time of how that the trumpets
[26:25] have sounded those six trumpets have
[26:27] sounded there and the Jews themselves
[26:29] assembling back home this not a sounding
[26:32] that's been a broadcast throughout the
[26:34] world but it's been a supernatural
[26:36] sounding that has alerted the Jews and
[26:40] calling them back to their homeland as I
[26:41] shared with you last week when you can
[26:43] go and you know not just when they were
[26:46] returning back down there from Yemen and
[26:49] and other places of the world but even
[26:51] every year the amount of Jews that are
[26:54] returning back to the homeland under
[26:56] that program they call on the wings of
[26:58] an eagle there are multitudes and
[27:00] multitudes and multitudes of Jews not
[27:03] just a thousand or 2,000 but thousands
[27:06] of them that are returning home why it's
[27:07] their time it's God allowing that and
[27:11] how that everything around them is is
[27:14] driving them into that place because
[27:16] it's there that God will reveal himself
[27:19] to them God will not reveal himself to
[27:22] the Jews over in New York City come on
[27:26] somebody you know place is important it
[27:28] brother random couldn't say you know
[27:30] what God your God anywhere so you can
[27:32] just read real the seven seals right
[27:34] here but God let him know God took
[27:36] everything around him every bit of
[27:39] comfort and God we even have to take in
[27:42] the comfort and the profit going God
[27:44] never let him forget about it for the
[27:47] Prophet said he always makes it hard on
[27:49] me when I come back here God never
[27:53] wanted him to forget what it means to
[27:55] obey
[27:56] the think of this here think of this
[27:59] here you know and you look at that
[28:01] there's many things that can be applied
[28:03] in our life with that but the see of how
[28:06] that within the Jews if if these things
[28:08] had not arose if if the persecution had
[28:11] not come and God allowed those spirits
[28:13] that are released there in revelations
[28:15] line if God had not permitted those
[28:18] spirits to come and begin to influence
[28:20] men like Hitler and Stalin and Mussolini
[28:24] and all of them if God had not allowed
[28:26] those things to come and allow the
[28:28] turning of the tide to where that people
[28:30] themselves would begin to look at the
[28:32] Jews and they would look at him with
[28:34] such detest and they would look on him
[28:36] in despise them if
[28:38] had not allowed that they would have
[28:40] continued to dwell in the lands where
[28:42] they were living but God permitted that
[28:45] that it would turn him from the lands of
[28:47] where they were living to where they no
[28:49] longer felt at home in Germany in Poland
[28:55] and all those places God removed the
[28:58] feeling that this is home
[29:01] he removed that how did God remove that
[29:05] by allowing everything to turn against
[29:09] him and
[29:10] God permitted that to come that way and
[29:13] to think of how that the Prophet in this
[29:16] hour would address this in the third
[29:18] Exodus where he would speak of how that
[29:20] I'm just referring to these places when
[29:23] he would parallel that time and he would
[29:25] parallel it to the time down in Egypt
[29:27] and he would bring the parallel to where
[29:29] that that at that moment in time in that
[29:32] junction of time of where the word was
[29:34] that at that time and the Prophet would
[29:36] address it like this and speak of how
[29:38] that we see denominational churches and
[29:41] so forth pinning the people down and
[29:43] getting so indifferent he says it's
[29:45] really pushing the people out so God
[29:49] bringing his word was closing things to
[29:52] be stirred up to where better
[29:54] denominations were starting to take a
[29:57] stand against the word and there's
[30:00] taking a stand against the word to where
[30:02] the Prophet picks it up and he says that
[30:04] they are being pressured that these
[30:06] believers are being pressured that they
[30:09] must have their name on a book or else
[30:11] they're going to be excommunicated he
[30:13] said but all that is nothing more than
[30:16] the tender hand of Jehovah that's
[30:19] leading them to the Tree of Life God
[30:21] allowed those things to come about
[30:23] because why the recognize that this
[30:26] denomination that this thinking and this
[30:29] is not my home
[30:31] God permitted it to come about to drive
[30:35] and bring that that long in here God is
[30:38] permitting it and unlike unlike that of
[30:41] where Israel themselves as we looked at
[30:45] it last week that brother Branham would
[30:47] tell us in that message the third exit
[30:49] is the where that these centers have
[30:51] people people that's not inspired God
[30:55] will take the laws of the land to move
[30:57] them into position and to find how that
[31:01] it was people that was not inspired but
[31:03] listen friends that is not our plight we
[31:06] are not a people that's without
[31:07] inspiration and I say that with a heart
[31:11] full of Thanksgiving that movie would be
[31:13] moved by the inspiration of Almighty God
[31:17] in this hour we we know where we're
[31:19] going we know who we are we see these
[31:22] things taking place around us and the
[31:24] Word of God becoming more precious and
[31:26] his presence and all of these things
[31:28] were not without the inspiration but
[31:30] inspiration is here leading us all the
[31:34] way back so glad we'll use the natural
[31:37] laws of the land to get things in
[31:39] position of people who are not inspired
[31:41] that's why the Prophet would go on and
[31:43] say in recognizing your day and its
[31:45] message and he would talk about national
[31:47] forces and you'll talk about the
[31:50] spiritual force and he'll speak of how
[31:52] that in the National forces he said it's
[31:54] those national forces that puts Israel
[31:57] back into her homeland it puts her back
[32:00] in her homeland we've seen that of how
[32:02] it he drove them back into that place
[32:04] we're flying the hell he goes on to say
[32:06] it's national force we'll put the church
[32:09] in the World Council of Churches
[32:11] national force but how does that
[32:13] national force come about by demonic
[32:16] influence how is that demonic influence
[32:19] able to touch it God permits
[32:21] God is over it all remember revelations
[32:25] 9 the angel that angel came falling down
[32:28] that had that key to the bottomless pit
[32:30] but in in revelations 10 that angel
[32:34] didn't come falling down that angel
[32:36] descended it was a mighty angel and to
[32:39] see that within this that it's not the
[32:42] national force but it is the very power
[32:45] of God that puts the people in the brown
[32:47] it's not a church it's not a pastor it's
[32:50] not a prophet it's the Holy Ghost and
[32:52] God comes through his ordained channels
[32:55] God comes through and it's God that puts
[32:57] you and I in his bride
[32:59] amen it's not it's not great teaching
[33:02] it's not this it has be God come on the
[33:05] scene and put the people in the bride
[33:08] so within this and how that God would
[33:11] would place this his is children I I
[33:14] want to just just to look at this for a
[33:16] moment because you see we find and we
[33:18] see a lot of things that take place and
[33:21] happen around and you know it's a time
[33:23] that really to be moving on in and if
[33:26] there's ever a time to be consecrated it
[33:29] ought to be this hour and to see that
[33:32] trends that for as the bride of Jesus
[33:34] Christ being his wife then we are not
[33:38] serving him under fear or under that of
[33:42] a
[33:43] browbeating or anything but it's out of
[33:45] love because if it's not out of love
[33:47] there's no faith that corresponds with
[33:49] it because the Bible is clear faith
[33:52] worketh by love and when we're seeing
[33:55] all of these things take place that here
[33:57] you find these these forces are putting
[34:00] then the church and putting Israel in
[34:03] its place but the power of God is
[34:05] putting the people in the bride then if
[34:07] we turn and look at this and bring it
[34:09] down into our everyday lives and to
[34:12] recognize that it's God sovereignly
[34:14] moving upon each of our lives it's God
[34:18] performing his word and dealing with our
[34:21] lives bringing us into the place and
[34:23] position that he has for us so let's
[34:27] look at this just for a few moments here
[34:29] tonight you see in first Corinthians
[34:32] chapter 10 verse 12 the scripture says
[34:35] wherefore let him that thinketh he
[34:37] standeth take heed lest he fall
[34:42] there have no temptation taken you but
[34:45] such as is common to man but God is
[34:49] faithful who will not suffer you to be
[34:52] tempted above that ye are able but will
[34:55] with the temptation also make a way of
[34:58] escape that you may be able to bear it
[35:01] wherefore my dearly beloved flee from
[35:05] idolatry in that of a powerful thing
[35:07] that God would deal with in this chapter
[35:10] of how that Israel was being tried in
[35:13] their wilderness journey and God would
[35:15] begin
[35:17] this verse here in verse 12 that let not
[35:20] a man think he that thinketh that he
[35:22] standeth I'll take heed lest he fall
[35:25] when when God would bring of this around
[35:27] then he ends the next then he ends that
[35:29] in the verse of 14 fear wherefore my
[35:32] dearly beloved flee from idolatry what
[35:34] is idolatry it's things that are not
[35:36] true it's things that are created by
[35:40] imagination it's vanity it has no life
[35:43] it has no strength and here the
[35:45] scripture is dealing with this that you
[35:47] know when we look at it that every one
[35:50] of us are tested and tried and we will
[35:53] be tested and tried and we will be
[35:56] tested and tried don't let anyone faint
[35:59] but I you know I can't be tested I can't
[36:02] be tried I can't never come to a place
[36:05] to where that I I feel like Oh God Lord
[36:08] I need you this very next moment but yet
[36:10] Paul is letting it be known hey hey God
[36:13] Himself don't ever get to thinking that
[36:16] way don't ever think that you're beyond
[36:18] the ability because you've got to
[36:21] remember it is God who gives you and I
[36:24] the strength to be able to stand it's
[36:26] God who gives us the courage to stand
[36:29] and it's God who brings us through this
[36:33] is where Paul would picked us up in hi I
[36:35] love this this verse thirteen out of
[36:38] that out of the diag lot of how it reads
[36:40] no trial has assailed you except what
[36:46] belongs to man
[36:48] so we're not getting trials that are Oh
[36:50] Lord God you you gave me a trial that's
[36:53] four angels no our trials that we're
[36:56] getting they belong to men now they are
[36:59] beyond our strength an hour an hour man
[37:02] ability but they are here within this
[37:06] time and God is faithful who will not
[37:11] permit you to be tried beyond your
[37:14] ability anybody ever feel like you've
[37:15] been beyond your ability I got both of
[37:18] my hands up there's been many times I
[37:20] feel like it's been beyond my ability
[37:23] and it has been my natural ability my
[37:26] physical ability but not according to
[37:28] the ability that God sees in me and
[37:31] that's what I have to come to and in
[37:34] coming to that ability that's what you
[37:36] have to come to time and time and time
[37:39] again
[37:41] but with the trial look at this but with
[37:45] the trial will also direct the issue
[37:49] that you may be able to bear it
[37:54] in the message I know
[37:56] brother brems says why does God let
[37:59] troubles come
[38:00] god harnesses trouble puts bits in its
[38:05] mouth and makes it obey him and those
[38:09] troubles bring us into a closer
[38:12] fellowship with God now think of how
[38:16] there's how the Prophet lays us in with
[38:18] Noah there had been no ring until the
[38:21] flood came but after Noah was pressed
[38:24] into that condition that he was in to
[38:26] flow forty days and nights in a storm
[38:28] and the little ark pitching up and down
[38:30] in the water it was after the flood was
[38:32] over that he saw the rainbow for its
[38:35] first time the Covenant of Hope the
[38:37] Covenant of promise after he went
[38:40] through the tribulation then he saw the
[38:41] promise that's the way you see the
[38:44] promise after you've gone through the
[38:47] tribulation no I didn't see the rainbow
[38:50] before it was after it's after things
[38:54] that God the tribulation those things
[38:57] are able God permits to come away and
[38:59] the Prophet will refer to that poem or
[39:02] that Psalm must I be carried home to
[39:04] heaven on a flowery bed of ease while
[39:06] others fought to win the prize and sail
[39:08] through bloody seas he said we ask for
[39:11] comfort and peace God gives us the best
[39:14] he could give us trials and tribulations
[39:20] lord have mercy I need somebody to help
[39:22] me understand this
[39:29] we asked for comfort and peace God gives
[39:32] us the best he could give us trials and
[39:35] tribulations that's better than comfort
[39:39] and peace our comforts is just the on
[39:44] the river
[39:45] over and over what we find that this
[39:48] message tell your friends identifying
[39:51] itself as God coming and leading and
[39:54] directing us it's not God who was
[39:56] leading us to to and to uh you know just
[39:59] to a church it's God leading us out of
[40:02] here with a sight that goes beyond this
[40:05] world it's not just something that comes
[40:08] to a place and it stops but it's got to
[40:11] be a sight that he goes beyond it's
[40:14] looking to the Lord and following his
[40:17] leadership
[40:18] because if we're just looking for well
[40:21] when I start coming to church my you
[40:23] know I'm just really expecting a lot of
[40:25] things that changing my things do change
[40:26] things will change
[40:29] absolutely you'll feel the the very low
[40:33] the burden of sin lifted you'll find how
[40:36] God comes down and brings a real
[40:37] cleansing and how that God can step into
[40:40] that life and begin to reflect see him
[40:42] reflect his life through you and I but
[40:44] it does not exempt us from testings and
[40:48] from trials and things that would come
[40:50] our way but there has to be a vision
[40:53] that recognizes that this is only
[40:56] temporary I tell you friends we need
[40:59] that and we need it to be renewed again
[41:02] and again and again because here we are
[41:05] standing in these fleshly Tabernacles
[41:08] our spirit our human spirit and in the
[41:10] inside of us if you met God face-to-face
[41:13] been born of his spirit that part is in
[41:16] contact with God and through the midst
[41:18] of tests through the midst of trials
[41:20] it's working to bring these outer two
[41:23] realms into that subjection and said
[41:27] wait a minute God is on my side
[41:32] hey man I may not have anything around
[41:35] here that I can see to boast in but I
[41:38] will boast in my God all the day long
[41:43] amen you are ordained to take control
[41:46] and master those circumstances by the
[41:50] faith of God look how the look how the
[41:53] scriptures would deal with this let's
[41:55] look at this for a few moments here
[41:56] tonight
[41:57] beloved inverse first Peter 4:12 beloved
[42:01] think it not strange concerning the
[42:04] fiery trial which is to try you as
[42:08] though some strange thing happened unto
[42:12] you but rejoice
[42:16] in as much as you're partakers of
[42:18] Christ's suffering that I don't want to
[42:20] deal with that part of it tonight on
[42:21] rejoice but just to drop it it is that
[42:25] where we are rejoicing is not in the
[42:30] affliction our rejoicing is in the Lord
[42:33] I
[42:37] rejoice in as much as ye are partakers
[42:40] of Christ's sufferings that when his
[42:42] glory shall be revealed ye may be glad
[42:45] also with exceeding joy
[42:48] look at how that James chapter 1 verse 2
[42:52] my brethren
[42:55] count it all joy when you shall fall
[42:58] into divers temptations
[43:01] knowing this that the trying of your
[43:03] faith worketh patience endurance
[43:09] but let patience have a perfect work
[43:12] that completeness that you may be
[43:14] perfect and entire and wanting nothing
[43:17] when I look at this as two things first
[43:20] of all throughout here throughout the
[43:22] entire New Testament of even held that
[43:24] the Lord Jesus himself and I believe
[43:27] it's in John chapter 16 that he would
[43:29] let the church know you're gonna have
[43:32] much tribulation
[43:34] you're gonna have much tribulation in
[43:36] this world in this life it's only
[43:40] temporary
[43:42] sometimes maybe in your life or in our
[43:45] life it seems like eternity but it's
[43:47] only temporary
[43:51] but to see hell that even
[43:54] these believers down through time
[43:58] that God would be able to comfort them
[44:01] and minister to them and direct their
[44:05] lives as he directs us of even how that
[44:08] we are approach the trial how we are to
[44:11] approach the the test which is the
[44:13] temptation that trial that would come
[44:15] our way even of how we would approach it
[44:17] you say brother Samuel what does that
[44:18] matter because if we don't approach it
[44:22] the right way it's gonna repeat and it
[44:27] doesn't work out what is needed in our
[44:30] life so we need God's help
[44:32] we need God's strength we need that
[44:35] understanding within it god help me and
[44:38] give me the strength now I just we just
[44:40] say it right out here tonight but
[44:42] there's not a one of us in here and
[44:43] maybe just even today that when we look
[44:46] at things and we come across things and
[44:48] sometimes we get to a place and we're
[44:50] looking at how seems like everything is
[44:52] going and then all of a sudden there's a
[44:54] bump in the road and if we're not
[44:56] careful we wonder where did this come
[44:57] from I I don't want this bump in the
[44:59] road every one of us I flash just not
[45:02] like bumps in the road I don't know
[45:06] about you how to like them they put the
[45:08] bumps when you're getting off the
[45:09] Turnpike and you've got the bumps and I
[45:11] don't like riding through places they
[45:12] got speed bumps I'll just avoid them
[45:14] I'll go the long way around I don't like
[45:16] bumps none of us like bumps spiritually
[45:20] in the road
[45:21] now don't tell me that you take bumps
[45:24] and trials and say glory to God praise
[45:27] the Lord there's a trial that came my
[45:29] way I know better than that
[45:31] but I bet I do we do have an
[45:34] understanding that God gives us the
[45:36] strength that even in the midst of that
[45:38] time to bring and hold everything
[45:41] together and even in the midst of it to
[45:45] look to the Lord and say lord help me
[45:47] Lord take my hands Lord guide me through
[45:50] this Lord direct me through it Lord I
[45:52] you know you're not the author of
[45:54] confusion you know what you're doing
[45:56] here you know who wants you to look at
[45:59] this here tonight look at how that when
[46:01] this began to happen with Jacob how how
[46:05] Jacobs approach was to all of this
[46:08] Jacobs approach was not a worn out of
[46:11] spite he said in elevating Jacob this is
[46:15] God moving around in Jacobs life to
[46:17] bring him in position to wear that even
[46:20] he could point out to go to his as Leah
[46:23] and Rachel and say you know that I have
[46:25] honored your father I have served him
[46:27] faithfully and in these things and they
[46:29] could recount or even two
[46:32] would go along with that to know his
[46:34] character even in the midst when he says
[46:37] God allowed allowed him but he suffered
[46:40] him not to hurt me God had a way that
[46:44] Lathan could kill him against Jacob but
[46:46] he could not take Jacob's life
[46:49] here was a line a line and to think of
[46:55] how that in the midst of this are our
[46:57] testing our attitude the Prophet he says
[47:01] this in the message masterpiece in
[47:03] prayer he says give us the desires of
[47:06] our heart where we truly have these
[47:09] desires to serve you in these weakening
[47:12] conditions and afflictions and things of
[47:14] the world that's put upon us sometimes
[47:17] to perfect us we've been told that think
[47:21] it not strange that these trials come
[47:23] they're only working out for our good
[47:26] and to perfect us and bring us into that
[47:29] place look at this outlook on the trial
[47:33] this is why they're giving to us to
[47:36] perfect us
[47:38] to perfect us and bring us into that
[47:41] place these great deserts of experience
[47:44] where righteous men are molded into
[47:46] Saints we thank thee for these
[47:49] experiences Lord we wouldn't know we
[47:52] wouldn't know me no lies want to do
[47:54] anything contrary to your will but we
[47:57] pray father that in this will be brought
[48:00] closer to you I believe that would be
[48:03] our prayer it should be our prayer that
[48:05] within every time that Lord in the midst
[48:07] of this bring me closer to you
[48:09] bring let me be drawn closer to you Lord
[48:13] because the trial itself it's permitted
[48:17] by God the test is permitted and to
[48:21] recognize that sometimes we can look and
[48:24] think where did this come from but to
[48:26] know that God permitted it but it comes
[48:29] with a purpose it's not for naught it's
[48:33] with a purpose God has purpose in mind
[48:37] and he knows with each and every one of
[48:40] us those things that could come our way
[48:42] that would triumph what he why is why is
[48:45] God permitting that he's permitting it
[48:47] to temporize to mold us to shape us to
[48:53] perfect us
[48:57] my look at this in the scripture here
[49:01] let's just look at this a little bit on
[49:03] God's oversight on these things in
[49:05] Revelations 2 verse 8
[49:08] it's writing to that of the angel of the
[49:11] church in Smyrna
[49:12] write these things saith the first and
[49:15] the last which was dead and is alive I
[49:17] know thy works and tribulation and
[49:21] poverty but thou art rich and I know the
[49:25] blasphemy of them which say they are
[49:27] Jews and are not but are the synagogue
[49:29] of Satan fear none of these things which
[49:32] thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall
[49:36] cast some of you into prison that you
[49:38] may be tried and ye shall have
[49:39] tribulation 10 days be thou faithful
[49:42] unto death and I will give thee a crown
[49:44] of life I want you to think of this in
[49:48] this in this time
[49:50] this this age itself we know that that
[49:53] each age here is a name that is given of
[49:56] a particular City there in Asia Minor
[49:59] and it would hold within that city and
[50:01] that name those characteristics that
[50:04] would describe a spiritual age a time of
[50:08] God dealing with the Gentile with the
[50:11] Gentiles God dealing with his children
[50:13] that in every age God is calling out of
[50:16] every age his children he's making up
[50:18] his body that in this age there it is
[50:24] spoken in that of some erna which some
[50:26] urn itself being that of myrrh and that
[50:28] of bittering and to think that this is
[50:30] an age where of such great bitterness
[50:33] that is being released but it was not
[50:35] bitterness toward the people of the
[50:38] world it was not bitterness toward just
[50:42] everybody but this bitterness was that
[50:45] which was being released toward the
[50:48] children of God the rest of the world
[50:51] remember within these times there
[50:52] they're moving into a time where in
[50:54] their unions and their guilds as it was
[50:57] known in that time where they were tied
[50:59] in and able to obtain you know about
[51:01] being a member of the church and they
[51:03] were able to obtain you know the jobs
[51:05] and everything like that and how that
[51:07] everything that was taking place that
[51:09] even within the midst of this time and
[51:12] all that was taking place yet God's
[51:14] words within the midst of it to this
[51:17] group of people was I know I
[51:21] know I know and
[51:26] to think of how that
[51:29] in the midst of the time bitterness you
[51:32] know is a terrible thing anybody know
[51:35] what I'm talking about I know it by
[51:37] experience bitterness is a horrible
[51:39] thing
[51:39] it can it truly can it can really really
[51:43] move within your life it's it's a it's a
[51:45] bad thing so to recognize of how that
[51:48] within things of bitterness and you know
[51:50] it doesn't take much it just takes a
[51:52] thought getting off in a certain way
[51:54] that's why those things have got to be
[51:56] checked because remember what bitterness
[51:57] is bitterness itself is poison
[52:02] bitterness is not you pouring a glass
[52:04] for somebody else and them drinking it
[52:06] bitterness is you drinking the poison
[52:09] and waiting for the other person to fall
[52:11] over
[52:13] that's bitterness bitterness itself it
[52:16] has a way that it can affect people's
[52:19] lives where everything you get around
[52:21] everything's negative and everything is
[52:23] this and look friends all those things
[52:25] can come it can come in marriages it can
[52:27] come in homes he can come around in
[52:28] churches all of those things we're not
[52:30] exempt from that but bitterness itself
[52:34] it's a place and every one of us know
[52:36] here from the youngest sometimes you've
[52:38] got that when you've got done eaten and
[52:40] you get things that come back up and it
[52:41] comes up your throat and man you're
[52:43] trying to get that taste of those
[52:45] stomach acids it burns your throat
[52:47] you're trying to get it out you try to
[52:48] drink orange juice or whatever more why
[52:50] you don't like the taste of those acids
[52:53] and if you're you know you start looking
[52:55] and thinking wait a minute what did I
[52:57] eat that calls that right there because
[53:00] what it is you don't want that coming up
[53:02] again because it burns like fire
[53:06] that's the way bitterness itself does
[53:09] within a life you realize that even in
[53:11] the midst of tests and trials successive
[53:14] things sometimes things that God would
[53:16] require you and I to be patient with you
[53:19] can look at things sometimes within your
[53:20] marriage you can look at it in your home
[53:22] look at it within the church and you can
[53:24] look at it and want to so put your hands
[53:27] on it and fix it by your own strength
[53:29] you will make a mess out of it every
[53:31] time but patience itself it looks to the
[53:34] Lord and as God Himself you give
[53:37] yourself to that word and say lord help
[53:39] me in the midst of it if this individual
[53:42] there's something about them a wife or
[53:43] husband that needs to be changed in Lord
[53:46] change that part about me of them that
[53:49] bothers me you know that part about you
[53:51] that's the button they can press
[53:53] because it's not God just changing the
[53:56] buttons on them God's gonna change the
[53:58] things that moves in us now God is not
[54:02] going to come down and perform surgery
[54:04] on us and take that part away because
[54:06] within each of our lives the way our
[54:08] personality is which is our temperament
[54:10] which is our makeup the Holy Ghost does
[54:13] not take the temperament or makeup out
[54:15] but the Holy Ghost sets right down in
[54:17] the middle of it has the will in the
[54:19] middle of the will to direct that
[54:21] temperament to direct that life but it
[54:23] does not mean that that temperament
[54:25] cannot get out of line as a matter of
[54:27] fact we need the Holy Ghost to keep our
[54:30] lives in line it's God giving us
[54:33] strength over our domain of Earth right
[54:36] now to rein in that earth because in the
[54:39] Millennium there is promises of rain
[54:41] there's promises where the heathen will
[54:43] get no ready and I believe with all my
[54:46] heart that as a son and daughter of God
[54:48] we have that designer laughter say Lord
[54:50] more than anything I need the rain of
[54:53] God I want the rain of God I want to do
[54:56] of God I want the flow of the presence
[54:59] of God and I want to ensure that I like
[55:02] his right where it needs to be that God
[55:05] is you're pouring yourself out that I'm
[55:07] right there to receive it because if I'm
[55:10] not then I don't get no rain there's no
[55:15] growth in my life and I'm wondering why
[55:17] isn't there growth taking place so God
[55:20] knows how to bring us along and
[55:22] bitterness itself is something that can
[55:24] come sometimes with a result where there
[55:27] is at the same time patience is being
[55:29] formed and yet bitterness itself can
[55:32] come in where that in the midst of us
[55:34] something that is taking place that a
[55:37] person can get bitter and it won't be to
[55:39] where necessarily they'll get bitter on
[55:41] God it can happen sometimes where people
[55:44] can get bitter and people can wonder and
[55:46] question about different things is that
[55:48] right but yet in the midst I remember
[55:50] the man who brother Ram told us about in
[55:52] one of the places of the message and
[55:54] there's multiple places he talks about
[55:55] that man in the Hebrew series to where
[55:57] that the brother who was a minister and
[55:59] so forth he had become so discouraged I
[56:02] don't know what the man had seen there's
[56:04] a lot of things around us that we hear
[56:06] and we see that could discourage us if
[56:08] we allow that to be our focus but I
[56:10] believe that we have received a word
[56:13] from the Lord I believe friends with all
[56:16] my heart this is not something that I'm
[56:17] just preaching to you but I am preaching
[56:20] to you by way of experience to where
[56:22] when there are things that in the midst
[56:24] of the life of things that you want to
[56:26] see change things that you want to see
[56:28] turn but it's not within your physical
[56:31] power to do it but God Himself will
[56:34] bring us to that place to pray and to
[56:36] look to him and trust him that he comes
[56:39] on the scene to fulfill his word every
[56:42] time and if we can have that kind of a
[56:45] relationship if we can be nurtured in
[56:48] that way if we can submit ourselves that
[56:50] way then it cast out any bitterness it
[56:53] cast out any faults that can turn into
[56:56] that bitterness I'll tell you the joy of
[56:58] the Lord is our strength
[57:02] amen there are times when there's things
[57:05] that you know what you know in there and
[57:07] then I have everything in the world just
[57:08] like you to be down and to be
[57:10] discouraged is that right I'm not
[57:13] talking about shame on you for being
[57:15] down Timon you're I'm not talking that
[57:16] way - no that's not what I'm saying what
[57:19] I'm trying to say is is that when you
[57:21] find yourself in the midst of those
[57:23] times and trying times let the Lord be
[57:26] your refuge and say little harder hold
[57:29] my hand Lord God help me Lord God you
[57:32] might say Lord hold my mind Lord help me
[57:34] Lord but my mind is riding light help my
[57:37] spirit Lord I feel like I'm coming to
[57:40] pieces help me Lord
[57:45] and he says I know I know I know
[57:54] as I said bitterness sometimes can come
[57:57] when we don't see change you're seeing
[57:58] things come the way that we want to see
[58:01] it but to think of how that the Prophet
[58:04] he puts it like this in the Sumerian Age
[58:07] he says the Lord God Almighty says I
[58:10] know
[58:12] there he is walking in the midst of his
[58:15] people
[58:16] there he is the chief Shepherd of the
[58:19] flock but does God does he hold back the
[58:22] persecution does he stim the tribulation
[58:26] no he does not he simply says I know
[58:31] your tribulation I am not at all
[58:34] unmindful of your suffering I love that
[58:36] how that the Prophet brings that home
[58:39] down God's not saying I know in a
[58:42] flippant manner God says I know I'm I'm
[58:45] fully mindful not just of the situation
[58:48] I know
[58:51] even in your spirit
[58:53] I know in your body
[59:02] what's what's the profit says what a
[59:05] stumbling-block this is there's so many
[59:08] people
[59:09] like Israel they wonder if God really
[59:12] loves them
[59:13] how can God be just and loving if he
[59:16] stands by and watches his people suffer
[59:19] I
[59:21] won't ask you to raise your hand
[59:24] but how many times have you how many
[59:27] times of me said God do you still love
[59:30] me I
[59:33] know you're thinking ahead you're going
[59:36] ahead on this quote but let's not let me
[59:38] just say this right here God doesn't
[59:41] love us just by mere words
[59:45] the Apostle John picked this up in first
[59:49] John brethren let us not love in just
[59:53] word only but in deeds
[59:58] let that love be expressive how where is
[1:00:00] he tying it back to that love that has
[1:00:02] been expressed to us and is expressed to
[1:00:07] us over and over
[1:00:10] with me
[1:00:12] even out that the Prophet would bring
[1:00:14] that down he brings it down into the
[1:00:16] marriage of how that even he says how is
[1:00:20] your wife going to know that she's a
[1:00:21] good cook how is she gonna know this how
[1:00:24] is she gonna know unless you tell her
[1:00:29] brother sadness she knows but maybe she
[1:00:31] wants to hear you say it I
[1:00:34] love to hear the Lord come down and
[1:00:37] speak to me
[1:00:38] now friends let me tell you the Lord
[1:00:41] speaks it's things that God speak to me
[1:00:43] within men and you know what the
[1:00:45] majority of everything it deals with
[1:00:47] right here with this assembly the
[1:00:48] bringing of the word the ministry and
[1:00:50] those things like that but within it
[1:00:52] within it all I still love to hear his
[1:00:55] voice it dread thrills my soul when God
[1:00:59] comes down many wakes me up in the
[1:01:01] morning in the middle of the night or
[1:01:02] whatever more and it's just something
[1:01:04] right there that God just speaks to my
[1:01:06] heart it's a thrill of my life and yet
[1:01:09] it can be the most trying time that I'm
[1:01:11] going through it I'm not just talking
[1:01:13] about even now sin I've just been here
[1:01:16] you know and when I stepped away from
[1:01:18] teaching but I'm talking about even in
[1:01:20] the midst of times of where when I was
[1:01:22] teaching all those years there were
[1:01:23] times I was standing right here on
[1:01:25] Thursday nights standing on Sunday and
[1:01:27] knowing what I had to face on Monday
[1:01:30] knowing what I had to face from a
[1:01:31] Thursday night going into a Friday times
[1:01:34] of uncertainty things that were coming
[1:01:36] all around it and situations that were
[1:01:38] isin just like you do
[1:01:40] but you know in the midst of it God is
[1:01:43] faithful to give us the strength that we
[1:01:45] need to be able to stand in that moment
[1:01:48] he knows now I could have let that just
[1:01:51] totally cab beats me down we de had been
[1:01:54] just a bummer of a service on a Thursday
[1:01:56] night or on a Sunday or whatever more
[1:01:58] but you know within it all God by His
[1:02:00] grace I believe he taught me some things
[1:02:02] I believe he's still teaching me some
[1:02:04] things is he teaching you a little bit
[1:02:08] acum the more a depth of compassion and
[1:02:10] sympathy were I don't just look on a
[1:02:12] person and say come on snap out of it
[1:02:15] man you're the bride of Jesus Christ he
[1:02:17] didn't just snap out of it it isn't
[1:02:19] something that just snaps out of your
[1:02:21] finger because nine times out of ten the
[1:02:24] people that tell you that they
[1:02:25] themselves you know when they're wearing
[1:02:27] a frown and the church said so see God
[1:02:32] permits things to come our way for what
[1:02:35] for what reason oh my we're not people
[1:02:37] without understanding God does not want
[1:02:40] us to walk without understanding but
[1:02:42] that you and I would have an
[1:02:43] understanding where we'd be able to
[1:02:45] stand there and pray and enter in
[1:02:49] enter in to that right there I believe
[1:02:53] that was on my heart think about it look
[1:02:57] at how that within this there love the
[1:03:00] Prophet he deals with this of how that
[1:03:02] their love in itself let me come down
[1:03:05] here their love they looked at it is
[1:03:07] that it was a love that meant no
[1:03:08] suffering they thought it was a love of
[1:03:11] parental care
[1:03:12] we're in every in every situation and in
[1:03:17] everything they they couldn't see that
[1:03:19] the things that God permitted to happen
[1:03:21] was with a purpose in mind and God would
[1:03:26] speak to Israel and let him know they
[1:03:28] waited
[1:03:29] didn't I late he sells mountains to
[1:03:32] waste
[1:03:33] did not deliver you from Egypt didn't I
[1:03:37] bring you all this way
[1:03:38] what's God let him know my love for you
[1:03:42] as always
[1:03:46] my approval of you is in me that I would
[1:03:51] come by your way and reveal myself
[1:03:56] but I would make known myself and draw
[1:03:59] you
[1:04:00] unto myself
[1:04:02] but to think of how that things work
[1:04:05] things go
[1:04:08] brother Bama he makes a statement in and
[1:04:11] he talks about how that why does he
[1:04:14] stand by
[1:04:16] and he says the reason is in Romans 8:17
[1:04:20] 3:18 if children then heirs and heirs of
[1:04:23] God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be
[1:04:26] that we
[1:04:27] suffer with him that
[1:04:30] we may also be glorified together see
[1:04:34] this is a this is a union
[1:04:38] husband and wife
[1:04:41] for better or worse in sickness and in
[1:04:45] health until
[1:04:48] unto death we do part it's not about how
[1:04:53] good it is it's not about how bad it is
[1:04:55] it's about serving
[1:04:58] suffer with him do you realize what the
[1:05:02] suffering with him he's right there
[1:05:04] walking in the midst of this church he's
[1:05:09] right there in our lives
[1:05:11] we're not a part in this this isn't
[1:05:14] something where and you work this out on
[1:05:15] your own he's right there with us but
[1:05:17] say no why don't he just take it away
[1:05:20] why don't because he knows
[1:05:24] the purpose that it's working out
[1:05:30] if God came down every single time and
[1:05:34] answered every single prayer according
[1:05:37] to how we prayed it and answered every
[1:05:39] single thing when we got sick as soon as
[1:05:41] we prayed the sickness was gone as soon
[1:05:43] as we would become the most spoiled
[1:05:47] group of people or the sender but we're
[1:05:50] children of God your children that are
[1:05:53] born of your flesh and your genes if you
[1:05:55] leave them to yourself and don't correct
[1:05:57] them and step in on every little thing
[1:05:59] they'd become spoiled but why don't you
[1:06:04] step in on everything you're tempted
[1:06:06] your tests why don't you do it because
[1:06:08] you know there's certain times they need
[1:06:09] to stand on their own feet there's
[1:06:12] certain times where they need to be
[1:06:16] spoken to by somebody else I'm not
[1:06:18] talking about another dog reprimanding
[1:06:20] them I'm talking about where they need
[1:06:23] other things where you have situations
[1:06:25] that come about where they have things
[1:06:28] that come their way where you have
[1:06:29] someone that stands there in school says
[1:06:30] you know what you're not as smart as you
[1:06:32] think you are
[1:06:34] they need somebody to deflate their
[1:06:37] balloon once in a while
[1:06:38] you understand what I'm saying friends
[1:06:40] this isn't meant to be but what I'm
[1:06:42] saying is that even though in the midst
[1:06:43] as a parent let me tell you something as
[1:06:46] a parent even when you know you have
[1:06:48] things where the Deacons would come in
[1:06:50] and they have to bring correction and
[1:06:51] and so forth they've raised children in
[1:06:54] the church and you can look at and say
[1:06:55] they're just being picky you can take
[1:06:57] that attitude in your heart and it'll
[1:06:59] never do you really good or you can say
[1:07:02] whom I let stings but you know it's
[1:07:04] truth and stand right up and back it up
[1:07:07] I hope somebody's with me tonight it's
[1:07:10] just like with the teacher in school you
[1:07:12] can either talk it down to where they
[1:07:14] look down at that teacher and you can
[1:07:15] talk it down or you can stand behind and
[1:07:17] back it up you say brother Samuel that
[1:07:19] teacher might be ever so wrong but if
[1:07:22] you go to talking down then they believe
[1:07:25] it's okay for them to disrespect
[1:07:27] teachers oh
[1:07:28] brother Sammy you're just saying that
[1:07:30] because you're a teacher no I'm saying
[1:07:32] because that'll transfer from one
[1:07:33] authority figure to another authority
[1:07:35] figure to another thirty figure to the
[1:07:37] pastor you know transfer to God you know
[1:07:39] transfer to the Prophet
[1:07:42] you understand what I'm saying these are
[1:07:45] necessary God trains us and teaches us
[1:07:49] and is molding us and shaping our
[1:07:51] character because our character is not a
[1:07:55] gift
[1:07:56] the Holy Ghost is the gift of God but
[1:08:01] character is not a gift
[1:08:04] money can't buy it
[1:08:07] money can't buy character character
[1:08:10] itself is molded and it's made or
[1:08:16] suffering
[1:08:17] when it all because in the midst of the
[1:08:20] fiery trial I'm closing in the midst of
[1:08:23] the fiery trial
[1:08:25] it's God
[1:08:27] allowing the fire from the trial
[1:08:31] mold
[1:08:33] to burn out all the dross
[1:08:38] all the impurities all the things about
[1:08:43] in our life
[1:08:46] think of it the Prophet tells us there's
[1:08:51] no church that's exempt from it there's
[1:08:54] no believer that's exempt from it
[1:08:57] but to everything remember everything it
[1:09:02] comes to the believer trials themselves
[1:09:04] our seasonal
[1:09:08] this season shall pass
[1:09:13] after this season we know comes after
[1:09:17] the winter comes the spring then the
[1:09:20] spring gives us that place to where
[1:09:23] there will be another season coming
[1:09:25] there are only seasons
[1:09:29] but it's seasons that there are things
[1:09:31] that are necessary to happen in this
[1:09:34] season in order for the next season
[1:09:39] every part of our life it's God moving
[1:09:43] us in place and in position molding us
[1:09:49] shaping us
[1:09:52] sometimes isn't an amazing how God will
[1:09:55] allow things to go for a long time
[1:09:57] my everything is just peachy at the
[1:10:02] workplane and then God will permit
[1:10:06] another boss to come in but her permit
[1:10:10] another worker to come in
[1:10:14] God will permit maybe a little
[1:10:17] disturbance to come in there in the home
[1:10:20] why would God permit that over the
[1:10:21] seminole that's not God why would God
[1:10:23] permit those things come about why would
[1:10:26] God you say oh brother Samuel that was
[1:10:27] just that was just a you know that was
[1:10:29] just a wrong spirit that came in
[1:10:30] influenced him or influenced her but did
[1:10:32] it bother you how did you respond to it
[1:10:35] how did you react to it
[1:10:38] you see God permits those things what's
[1:10:41] it doing it's God tempering that it's us
[1:10:45] for us we recognized you know
[1:10:47] recognizing our weakness
[1:10:49] recognize that he's our strength
[1:10:52] don't get focused on the weakness focus
[1:10:55] on Lord I need you you're my strength
[1:10:58] mold me shape me make me
[1:11:01] he's faithful you love him
[1:11:05] may God help us that all of these things
[1:11:08] the tests and trials that he permits to
[1:11:10] come away let him you say Lord bring me
[1:11:14] into that place Lord in my life and my
[1:11:17] walk spiritually Lord bring me into that
[1:11:20] place with you that you are calling me
[1:11:23] to
[1:11:25] he's faithful
[1:11:29] let's bear here
[1:11:32] anybody like to be remembered in prayer
[1:11:35] tonight
[1:11:37] your hands throughout this building my
[1:11:39] hands up - I wonder if we just couldn't
[1:11:42] let's all pray together
[1:11:45] let's pray together
[1:11:50] Heavenly Father
[1:11:55] Lord how intimately Lord you speak to us
[1:12:00] Lord
[1:12:02] in the midst of that age
[1:12:05] you said I know
[1:12:10] good god to think of how that
[1:12:13] inspiration would flow through that age
[1:12:17] and the word Lord that was given by the
[1:12:20] Spirit of God
[1:12:22] that would drive away
[1:12:25] the bitterness that would try to
[1:12:28] overtake the lives of the believers
[1:12:32] circumstances
[1:12:34] physically
[1:12:36] materially that would triumph would
[1:12:40] even to wear as your prophet would tell
[1:12:43] us that kind-hearted people in the
[1:12:46] society in that day that they could
[1:12:51] Lord
[1:12:53] be Lord turned against because they were
[1:12:57] simply kind to the children of God
[1:13:00] to think about how that the pressure and
[1:13:03] things would come Lord to wear that
[1:13:05] there was nothing Lord
[1:13:07] no kindness were trying to remove
[1:13:10] kindness Lord from all around them and
[1:13:12] you permitted that you knew the
[1:13:16] situation you knew the condition
[1:13:19] your prophet goes on to tell us Lord in
[1:13:22] this in this right here he says how that
[1:13:26] the mind itself of the untutored
[1:13:28] believer would think how could God not
[1:13:32] just stop and give in and lavish them
[1:13:35] with everything
[1:13:38] Lord
[1:13:40] I've got to be honest lord I
[1:13:43] thank you Lord for the understanding
[1:13:46] that you give us Lord
[1:13:49] but I realize the Lord Jesus more and
[1:13:51] more the understanding that you give us
[1:13:55] is not just something Lord God that we
[1:13:58] would learn by hearing the Word of God
[1:14:01] not just by hearing it Lord but there
[1:14:04] are experiences
[1:14:05] that must come in our life from learning
[1:14:09] experiences where that word is is put to
[1:14:12] a test
[1:14:13] we're in the midst of those times Lord
[1:14:16] [Music]
[1:14:20] it rises up within us
[1:14:24] remember when I said
[1:14:26] remember what I spoke remember in my
[1:14:31] world oh god
[1:14:35] no the tests of the trials
[1:14:39] or our flesh our spirit is never one of
[1:14:44] them but God that inner man
[1:14:48] it's setting us free Lord
[1:14:50] [Music]
[1:14:52] you're strengthening us you're molding
[1:14:54] us Lord a faith or God that has been
[1:14:59] deposited there and raised up Lord God I
[1:15:02] think Lord here tonight
[1:15:04] [Music]
[1:15:07] there's testers trials than Lord that
[1:15:10] we're faced with
[1:15:11] things that we've come through Lord
[1:15:14] whether Lord this week this month this
[1:15:16] year there's things Lord that we can
[1:15:21] truly say
[1:15:23] not those those things that were in the
[1:15:26] pasture know that Lord was some great
[1:15:27] trials and things in our life
[1:15:30] but all those prepared a smarty
[1:15:33] shapeless our faith
[1:15:38] and we with patients
[1:15:42] standing there and say he's faithful
[1:15:47] God how your prophet tells us that
[1:15:49] sometimes how they right afterward pray
[1:15:52] for
[1:15:55] healing Lord would begin to come he said
[1:15:57] then all of a sudden you begin to sit in
[1:16:00] and it seems like we're worse he said
[1:16:02] God will permit that to test us
[1:16:07] what will we do in that time
[1:16:09] [Music]
[1:16:12] Lord we're here tonight confessing that
[1:16:16] we need you Lord
[1:16:18] we ask that God I start here and I ask
[1:16:22] Lord for the entirety of this assembly
[1:16:24] forgive me lord in the times when I've
[1:16:27] complained Lord
[1:16:28] forgive me Lord in the times Lord
[1:16:32] that I've looked and I've wondered lord
[1:16:35] I know that Lord even in the midst of
[1:16:38] those moments Lord that those things the
[1:16:41] Lord that I had even in those times Lord
[1:16:43] of Akef Lord he would be turned around
[1:16:46] he would be turned about I
[1:16:51] think God of how your prophet
[1:16:54] he said there in the message go tell
[1:16:57] [Music]
[1:16:58] and he began to talk about a condition
[1:17:01] Lord that had come in his life fear had
[1:17:03] come in
[1:17:04] and he was talking about it he said I
[1:17:06] was a I've always been afraid of failing
[1:17:10] but you took the lord of circumstance
[1:17:12] you took a situation
[1:17:16] and you let him know the doctors tried
[1:17:18] to bring the fever down to the sinus
[1:17:20] condition all those things
[1:17:23] but they couldn't do it
[1:17:26] and he was looking at it Lord looking at
[1:17:29] everything
[1:17:31] and in the midst of that time
[1:17:34] you spoke to him and you said I've
[1:17:37] confirmed the furtherance of your
[1:17:40] ministry your commission but you've got
[1:17:43] to accept it
[1:17:45] Lord at that moment he said Lord then I
[1:17:49] accepted
[1:17:51] he said immediately he said that sinus
[1:17:54] condition was broken and it begins to go
[1:17:57] on and talk about how that Lord the
[1:17:59] examples of men like Patton and others
[1:18:02] how that God he took that and began to
[1:18:05] apply it spiritually in his life
[1:18:07] and you removed the fear of failure
[1:18:14] from his life oh my what Satan thought
[1:18:17] that it would be a demise but right
[1:18:19] there Lord God you proved yourself
[1:18:24] faithful more
[1:18:26] but sometimes situations
[1:18:28] how things are permitted to come our way
[1:18:32] nor do we know that there are things
[1:18:34] that are allowed it shows it brings out
[1:18:38] of our life those things God that you're
[1:18:40] wanting that lust Lord to surrender
