[14:21] right now as they're under attack
[14:25] amen it's just uh any unspoken prayer
[14:28] request us this morning uplifted hand
[14:30] let's just go together with our
[14:37] brother uh just a quick testimony too um
[14:41] uh last week at work I'd been battling a
[14:43] sinus infection for like a couple of
[14:45] weeks and so I went to work it's
[14:47] actually after Thursday night felt
[14:48] pretty good and there was something I'd
[14:50] been working on for for a few months and
[14:53] I actually got some good news about it
[14:55] so I was I was doing pretty good and
[14:57] then Satan laid a uh a trap for me there
[15:00] and U and I actually failed so you say
[15:03] that's not much of a testimony but see a
[15:06] few a week before that or so brother
[15:08] Samuel had said something in his sermon
[15:10] he said you know when you're on the
[15:11] Mountaintop that's when the test
[15:14] comes so through the failure of that
[15:17] test I
[15:18] actually that that uh that became more
[15:21] real to me you know so we sang a song
[15:24] last last week where it said he looked
[15:25] beyond our our faults and saw our needs
[15:27] and you know I didn't I didn't need to
[15:30] pass a test at that moment God knows I
[15:32] it wasn't about that you know passing or
[15:35] failing but but uh what I needed was his
[15:37] word to become just a little more real
[15:40] to me and maybe maybe that day even
[15:43] through the failure you know maybe I
[15:45] made a half a step in my walk with the
[15:47] Lord you know and I'll take I I'll take
[15:49] that over a pass or a fail or you know
[15:51] just his word becoming more real to US
[15:54] mean means more than me than than what I
[15:56] do or don't do or or anything anything
[15:58] like that so I just wanted to to share
[16:00] that with you you know sometimes it's we
[16:03] we we never want to fail a test you know
[16:05] it always feels bad but you know even
[16:08] every single test that Satan lays isn't
[16:12] for you know one thing or another it's
[16:15] he he wants to destroy us you know so
[16:17] every test he lays with the purpose of
[16:19] destroying us but you know every time we
[16:23] walk past that test is a time that he
[16:25] failed so there's still victory in our
[16:29] failures so even even at the end we can
[16:32] come we can come out and say you know
[16:34] what God still give God the glory and
[16:36] it's still you know a victory for the
[16:38] kingdom of God and we'll learn from it
[16:41] so just wanted to kind of share that
[16:43] with you so let's just go before the
[16:45] Lord in
[16:47] prayer dear Lord Jesus we just come
[16:49] before you Lord we just thank you for
[16:51] this time this opportunity just another
[16:53] opportunity to come Lord and just to
[16:55] Worship You Lord and to exalt you Lord
[16:57] just hopeing everything that we do Lord
[16:59] that Lord you would be exalted Lord and
[17:02] I just pray Lord for the for this
[17:05] service Lord that you would just come
[17:06] Lord and just be able Lord to just
[17:09] manifest yourself to each and everyone
[17:11] Lord in just a special way this morning
[17:13] Lord Lord we're not here Lord to just
[17:15] see each other Lord or just to even
[17:17] gather with with with people Lord as a
[17:20] even as a lord some look at it as
[17:23] formality and such Lord but it's it's so
[17:25] much deeper than that lord it's coming
[17:27] another opportunity Lord Lord to meet
[17:29] with you Lord and to to learn of you
[17:31] Lord and to have a closer walk with you
[17:34] Lord and Lord that's our our our desires

[17:38] I believe just a people that comes Lord
[17:40] just thirsting Lord for a deeper Closer
[17:42] Walk with You Lord and Lord we just want
[17:46] to put these requests Lord before your
[17:48] throne of Mercy Lord in each each and
[17:50] every one Lord we
[17:51] just each one is you know serious Lord
[17:54] and in in in our hearts Lord as we want
[17:57] to hold them before for you Lord but
[18:00] Lord the prophet taught us Lord that by
[18:02] your stripes we were healed Lord and we
[18:04] weren't healed on any day we were healed
[18:06] you know 2,000 years ago and I always
[18:08] wondered about that didn't disbelieve it
[18:11] Lord but just didn't understand it Lord
[18:13] as in the other day I was reading in the
[18:15] scripture where where you was talking to
[18:17] Thomas and you said here's the nail
[18:19] prints in my hand and here's here's put
[18:22] your hand in my side where the where the
[18:24] spear pierc me Lord but the the stripes
[18:27] aren't mentioned in there Lord and I
[18:29] believe that you went down with the
[18:30] stripes Lord but when you Rose in your
[18:32] glorified body Lord I believe that your
[18:34] stripes were healed Lord as a
[18:37] representation lord of the healing that
[18:39] you're going to have for your body on
[18:41] Earth Lord so I believe all these
[18:44] request Lord that the healing was was
[18:46] done back then it's a finished work Lord
[18:49] your body was healed Lord so our bodies
[18:51] can be healed Lord and I just Lord I
[18:54] just pray Lord for each one of these
[18:55] requests Lord maybe just Lord realize
[18:58] that healing Lord physical emotional

[19:03] Lord you have already provided
[19:05] everything we need Lord and Lord we just
[19:08] want to commit all these into your hands
[19:10] Lord and just for the tithes and
[19:12] offerings Lord I just pray that you

[38:34] worth it all and I I I pray that I am
[38:39] and I believe God will allow me to stand
[38:41] there to listen for every one of your
[38:43] names to be
[38:48] called
[38:50] Hallelujah I'm looking forward to that
[38:52] day amen you talk about a time of
[38:56] shouting well we're we're getting it use
[38:58] we're getting it right now because we
[39:00] have a liberty in our soul that's right
[39:03] that that the world's lost its hold on
[39:05] our lives even how God continues to move
[39:08] on our hearts it's just there's no grip
[39:11] there no more there's things just it's
[39:13] just passing away but to think about it
[39:15] on that day no wonder no wonder as the
[39:20] prophet lays that out we see it in the
[39:22] scripture when the Lord Jesus raised
[39:24] from the grave he was with
[39:27] them the Bible tells us in the book of
[39:28] Acts for a period of 40 days and the
[39:33] prophet said when he when that
[39:34] Resurrection comes we will be gathered
[39:37] with the Saints for a period of time of
[39:40] 30 to 40
[39:41] days and he said you know he goes on to
[39:45] say it like this he says you see he
[39:48] knows that we're going to be looking
[39:50] around to see who made it that's right
[39:53] and so he gives us ample opportunity
[39:56] we're rejoicing but also going to greet
[40:00] but he wants at that time when he
[40:03] descends that all attention would be
[40:06] upon Him amen amen God's got everything
[40:09] arranged yes he does you know aren't you
[40:13] glad it's it's not something that we
[40:14] have to think about or worry about the
[40:17] whole Christian walk is a walk of rest
[40:22] am that's really what it is it's a rest
[40:25] in him and we're just we're thankful to
[40:28] be a partaker of that just so glad that
[40:30] each and every one of you here this
[40:33] morning uh I also have that down Sister
[40:37] Rita you give her testimony
[40:41] Hereafter before the communion time and
[40:45] we just want the Lord just to come and
[40:47] have his way and just to deal in our
[40:50] hearts and I want to just say brother
[40:52] Brian and the rest kind words and um you
[40:54] just let me know where you would like to
[40:56] go for
[40:58] [Laughter]
[41:00] dinner just teasing
[41:02] you but um we love you and the Lord and
[41:06] we just want to take a few moments and
[41:08] look into the word this morning and uh
[41:12] appreciate the musicians and amen don't
[41:15] you just thank God for our musicians
[41:17] amen I tell you I mean we've got to it's
[41:21] just a
[41:25] blessing um I've been I've been to
[41:28] assemblies that would have a have a few
[41:31] more in number than what we have and you
[41:33] know if if a song leader is not there
[41:35] the pastor is leading the song matter of
[41:37] fact another assembly that where I've
[41:40] been multiple times and uh they've um
[41:44] they've tried to say hey could we make
[41:46] some swaps here we'll swap you a few
[41:48] preachers for a couple song
[41:51] leaders because when uh you know the the
[41:54] song leader or the couple song leaders
[41:55] are not there there because of different
[41:57] duties and things then the pastor will
[41:58] lead the singing and then go right in
[42:00] and uh but you know all those times we
[42:03] we labor like we do we go ahead like we
[42:05] do and it makes you
[42:06] appreciate sometimes you know we we
[42:08] think back on that and I just want to
[42:10] say that the song leaders and also the
[42:12] musicians I appreciate because I know
[42:14] these brothers and I know the musicians
[42:16] they take it seriously and I really
[42:18] appreciate that that shows there's an
[42:21] atmosphere that's created because it
[42:24] it's not just that man it's not just the
[42:25] music positions but it's you coming with
[42:27] and putting your lick of fire together
[42:29] and I tell you what it's a little bit
[42:30] easier to enter into something like that
[42:33] and get together and because we we just
[42:36] have one purpose when we come here and
[42:37] that's to lift him up so let's look here
[42:40] in the scripture and I want to just uh
[42:43] for a few moments of verse 23 of 1
[42:46] Corinthians 11 sorry I didn't tell you
[42:48] the chapter and I want to read from here
[42:52] and with this being where we'll uh take
[42:54] communion and and do footwall Wasing
[42:56] here after um ministering of the word
[42:59] and we'll give time that for any hearts
[43:02] that to be clear or any that would like
[43:04] to be prayed I know I've had one request
[43:06] already to
[43:07] pray uh for someone um so we we're we'll
[43:12] be willing to do that as
[43:17] well verse
[43:20] 23 for I have received of the Lord that
[43:24] which also I delivered unto you that the
[43:28] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[43:30] was betrayed took bread and when he had
[43:34] given thanks he break it and said take
[43:37] it this is my body which is broken for
[43:39] you this do in remembrance of me and
[43:43] after the same manner also he took the
[43:45] cup and when he had SED saying this cup
[43:49] is the New Testament in my blood this do
[43:52] ye as of as you drink it in remembrance
[43:55] of me
[43:56] for as of as you eat this bread and
[43:59] drink this cup you do show the Lord's
[44:02] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[44:06] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[44:08] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[44:11] of the body and blood of the Lord but
[44:14] let a man examine himself and so let him
[44:17] eat of that bread and drink of that cup
[44:21] for he that eateth and drinketh
[44:23] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[44:26] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[44:29] body and for this cause many are weak
[44:32] and sickly among you and many sleep for
[44:36] if we would judge
[44:38] ourselves we should not be judged but
[44:41] when we are judged we are chastened of
[44:44] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[44:48] with the world I tell you when I I read
[44:51] that even in verse 31 and verse 32 I see
[44:54] the grace of God
[44:56] yes because even what would slip us I'm
[45:01] grateful that when it slips Us in some
[45:03] way whether it's we just Overlook it or
[45:06] we don't esteem it the same importance
[45:08] but I'm glad that God so loves us as our
[45:11] heavenly father that he'll correct
[45:14] us that's
[45:16] Grace that's
[45:18] grace verse 33 wherefore my brethren
[45:22] when ye come together to eat Terry one
[45:26] for another let's just look to the Lord
[45:29] in a word of prayer heavenly father as
[45:32] we lord stand here in this moment Lord
[45:36] how grateful we are for your grace Lord
[45:39] Upon Our Lives Lord and father we are
[45:42] standing here this morning Lord with
[45:45] Lord a a desire Lord in our hearts Lord
[45:49] that just Desiring to please you
[45:53] Desiring Lord in every way that God that
[45:56] our lives would Lord be as vessels Lord
[45:59] that you are free to use and Lord that
[46:04] you're operating through you're
[46:06] manifesting your life and changing us
[46:09] Lord from Glory into glory Lord the
[46:11] whole part of our life is we just want
[46:14] our lives to be consumed by you Lord and
[46:19] I pray that Lord that you would just
[46:21] come by our way in these few moments and
[46:23] a very simple little thought Lord that
[46:25] you've placed on my heart for this
[46:27] morning I'm asking that you'll come Lord
[46:30] and and give me Grace that I can just
[46:32] step out of the way that you can say
[46:35] what needs to be said Lord for you know
[46:38] our needs Lord you know what we have
[46:41] need of and we just Lord look to you
[46:43] this morning that you'll come Lord and
[46:45] heal those that are sick among us
[46:47] visible and invisible audience Lord that
[46:50] you will Lord touch every heart Lord
[46:53] according to the needs in our life Lord
[46:55] we pray may you pour out of your spirit
[46:58] Lord and may you find God vessels Lord
[47:01] that are Lord open and available Lord
[47:03] and yielded Lord to you father for we
[47:06] love you Lord and we want to be closer
[47:09] to you Lord we want to serve you better
[47:12] Lord we just ask that you would have
[47:14] your way now in this service Lord may
[47:16] your presence Lord as we already sense
[47:19] it here Lord now as we just enter into
[47:22] that Lord and just to allow you oh God
[47:25] to just have your way now father we ask
[47:28] it in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen
[47:31] God bless you as you're being
[47:34] seated I'd like to just speak here just
[47:36] for a few moments just on
[47:38] a just on a
[47:41] thought uh spiritual
[47:45] checkup and I want to just begin here
[47:48] with this part of it that you know
[47:52] communion itself when
[47:54] you we look at it and it's uh it's how
[47:58] the prophet referred to it as a it's a
[48:00] time of a
[48:01] showdown it's a time that I believe to
[48:05] examine our lives very closely under the
[48:09] guidance of the Holy Spirit and I I
[48:11] couldn't emphasize that enough that we
[48:13] want his guidance in our
[48:16] examination we want to know we don't
[48:19] want to go off on our own with it
[48:21] because we can go to either either
[48:23] extreme we want him who is is the truth
[48:26] he's the balanced one and we want to be
[48:29] under his guidance in that examining and
[48:32] I believe however I I believe that we
[48:34] would certainly be um uh living beneath
[48:38] our privileges if we only approached it
[48:42] and approached our walk or evaluating
[48:45] our walk we would be living beneath our
[48:48] privileges if we only did it when we
[48:50] knew communion service was coming
[48:53] up communion service when we think of
[48:56] that that's a testimony and I know
[48:58] there's been all sorts of things that
[49:01] you know could be laid out and you know
[49:03] sometimes you still have individuals
[49:04] that say well I you know I I don't
[49:06] believe we should take Natural communion
[49:08] it's spiritual communion but we want to
[49:11] stay with the word of
[49:13] God this is just like water baptism when
[49:16] you are baptized in the name of the Lord
[49:18] Jesus Christ that water does not save
[49:22] you that water does not clean you right
[49:26] but that is according to the word and it
[49:29] is as the scripture says you making an
[49:32] outward declaration that an inner work
[49:36] had taken place that's right that's what
[49:38] you're saying I'm not ashamed to be
[49:40] identified with him and the same way it
[49:43] is with communion you are testifying
[49:46] that the word of the Lord is abiding in
[49:48] my heart that he has changed my life
[49:53] He's My All In All and he and I
[49:56] are in Fellowship thank you Lord that I
[49:59] am a partaker not just not just at
[50:02] church that's why I'm so grateful that
[50:05] the real Gospel of Jesus Christ it
[50:07] brings that the relationship is not a
[50:11] membership but the relationship is a
[50:14] union between you and Jesus Christ that
[50:18] when you go into your job when you go
[50:20] back to your home it's god with skin on
[50:24] it's the Lord Lord right there to direct
[50:27] you with every problem every adversity
[50:30] every situation of life it's God living
[50:34] his own life through your yielded vessel
[50:37] and so communion means to talk with one
[50:40] another it means to speak with one
[50:42] another now I know sometimes we we all
[50:45] maybe some more than others we have
[50:47] habits where we don't we don't uh
[50:50] commune maybe we talk too much and you
[50:54] know we can step away from there and
[50:56] maybe it would do us all a realm of good
[50:58] to say what did the other person say
[51:00] well I I don't know you know I don't
[51:03] know I just I I don't know well did you
[51:06] do all the talking I guess I did you
[51:09] know um but communion and then you know
[51:12] even when we talk to the Lord in prayer
[51:15] you know brother Brandon would go over
[51:16] that many times he said you know he said
[51:18] sometimes even in myself he said I do
[51:21] too much talking and even we find that
[51:23] in prayer prayer is not about that you
[51:25] know it's how much that I can talk or
[51:28] how much that I can say you know
[51:30] sometimes as you've been serving the
[51:31] lord for any length of time your time in
[51:34] prayer and talking to the Lord sometimes
[51:37] you know it's just things that what you
[51:39] roll rolls out of your heart is just
[51:41] praise and thanksgiving there's needs to
[51:43] pray about but there's things that is
[51:45] just coming out of your heart that's
[51:47] just Thanksgiving It's Just Praise And I
[51:48] mean it's bubbling out at that in those
[51:51] moments and you know and there's times
[51:53] where in prayer that you have it to
[51:55] where you are worshiping and it seems
[51:57] like I don't feel anything taking place
[51:59] but you're creating an atmosphere you're
[52:01] you're wanting you're wanting just to
[52:03] invite him just to worship him in the
[52:06] situation cuz I I I would say friends
[52:08] that it wasn't a too it wasn't a very
[52:10] comfortable moment for Mary Magdalene to
[52:13] make her way to the feet of Jesus and
[52:16] wash his feet she had critics she heard
[52:18] their Whispers all around and she knew
[52:21] how it would be when she went into the
[52:23] into that house but she made her way
[52:26] because there was something moving in
[52:28] her heart that was greater than all of
[52:31] her feelings aren't you grateful that
[52:33] there is a pulsation of the spirit of
[52:35] God that can move in your heart that
[52:38] will actually supersede all of your
[52:40] feelings and all of your thoughts I I'm
[52:42] a witness and I know I'm speaking to
[52:44] other Witnesses and that don't ever stop
[52:46] but that's where the Prophet would tell
[52:48] us yield to that pulsation of faith and
[52:52] move with it because she didn't know how
[52:53] she was going to meet the need that God
[52:55] was calling her to do but God supplied
[52:58] every time God calls you to do something
[53:00] God Will Supply what's needed to
[53:03] accomplish the task that's so good and
[53:05] so when we look at prayer sometimes with
[53:07] prayer you know we know it's not just
[53:09] even uh the position of our body it's
[53:12] our heart and there's times where in
[53:14] prayer that and I I'm just speaking but
[53:16] I just say it openly that there's times
[53:18] in prayer where I've sat down in times
[53:21] you know and and I've ready to go into
[53:23] prayer sometimes it's happened when I
[53:25] may be in the midst of going into a
[53:26] meeting and and uh I might be in you
[53:29] know you're in a different setting maybe
[53:30] I'm in a hotel room and things and
[53:33] sometimes I just get out I don't want to
[53:34] disturb the family or my wife or anybody
[53:36] else and uh I just get out and find
[53:39] somewhere to prayer then there's other
[53:40] times where there might be another room
[53:42] in that in that hotel a room and get out
[53:45] there and you just find the presence of
[53:46] the Lord and there's not anything that
[53:48] you're saying out of hear but it's just
[53:50] meditation it's things that there's a
[53:53] communion and I'm hearing his voice and
[53:55] how that God is speaking you know to my
[53:57] heart and things that he's saying and
[54:00] and sometimes it isn't that I've even
[54:02] said anything auditorily but it's just
[54:04] been a moment in a time and before you
[54:06] look around how much time has passed by
[54:08] but it's a communion with the Lord amen
[54:12] and I just want to just encourage you
[54:14] that when we're looking at this of
[54:15] communion it's our prayer and it's being
[54:18] in fellowship with him and feasting on
[54:21] his word we are declaring that I am a
[54:23] partaker of his own life remember he he
[54:28] gave them he says except you eat the
[54:30] Flesh of the son of man and drink his
[54:32] blood what was he speaking about the
[54:35] word that has been made flesh because
[54:38] you can't live you can't live from
[54:40] something in the past you've got to live
[54:43] by that which is present and which is
[54:47] life right and here he is declaring that
[54:50] and that's where you and I remember it
[54:52] was when Abraham when Abraham returned
[54:55] from the battle and he's returning back
[54:59] he meets mzc in Genesis 14 and here when
[55:02] he meets MDC MDC gives to him bread and
[55:07] wine after Abraham had fought the Battle
[55:11] and the battle if we can bring it this
[55:13] way the Battle of life you realize there
[55:15] was a battle that was fought in
[55:17] Gethsemane and he overcame there was a
[55:20] battle there here Calvary the lamb is
[55:23] offered up he went to the lowest parts
[55:25] of hell and he deposited our sins there
[55:29] let me just tell you the journey to the
[55:31] lowest parts of hell was not a joyful
[55:35] Journey but the Lord Jesus the Bible
[55:38] says has he endured the cross despising
[55:43] the shame he was able to look past all
[55:47] of the shame everything that he that he
[55:50] would have to go through and be put
[55:52] through because he could see your
[55:54] Delight in your joy in the Liberty that
[55:57] would be brought by his sacrifice and he
[56:00] did it because he could see your life
[56:03] liberated he could see your life my life
[56:06] changed he could see you healed he did
[56:09] it for the joy that was set before him
[56:13] and he endured it and then he offered
[56:15] there on the day of Pentecost who do we
[56:17] find coming back among the Believers the
[56:20] same God here he is delivering what the
[56:23] Bread and Wine to the old Overcomers
[56:26] it's the same mezc the same one that met
[56:29] Abraham is the same God giving to
[56:31] Abraham a feast to the Overcomer giving
[56:34] him what's needed and that's why even in
[56:37] the typ here of the Bread and Wine it's
[56:39] a type that we are a partaker of the
[56:41] word and the spirit we are true
[56:46] worshippers and this is why that when we
[56:49] we have that that own our testimony that
[56:51] even as we declare it here I'm a
[56:53] partaker of of the word of life I am one
[56:57] with him and so I I believe that that is
[57:01] something as we always want to stay
[57:04] before us um that that I want to be
[57:07] available to him I want to I I I I want
[57:10] to always be in a place we want to
[57:13] always be in a place not just certain
[57:15] times of the year where we become uh
[57:18] very uh uh conscious but we listen we
[57:21] want to be conscience of God at all
[57:27] times and and this life this world the
[57:31] way Satan is he battles to constantly to
[57:35] some in many ways to numb us to try to
[57:39] get our minds and there's listen there's
[57:42] so many things sometimes that we have on
[57:44] our minds and problems we're faced with
[57:46] and things that arise and sometimes you
[57:48] feel like I can't take another one I
[57:50] can't take anything else mouning up you
[57:53] you just feel like you're pulled in a
[57:54] mini
[57:55] million different places but you know
[57:57] even when we look at those those moments
[58:00] we say God help me Lord help me Lord I
[58:03] need your help I want to remain in that
[58:05] place to where that I'm conscious of him
[58:08] at all times where I however if however
[58:11] he wants to use me but it's also even in
[58:14] the ways that I'm not aware of that he
[58:16] is using me because in this particular
[58:19] even assembly how many of us have had
[58:22] people come over to us on even on your
[58:24] job or on others at different times your
[58:27] family listen your life is being watched
[58:30] not just what you say our lives are
[58:32] being watched and so they're watching
[58:35] that life they're watching our testimony
[58:37] what do we do where what do we stand for
[58:40] how do we approach things is is Christ
[58:43] the very fervency of our life or do we
[58:45] just have a a religion do we just have
[58:48] something that we do on certain days or
[58:50] is he our life is he our everything amen
[58:54] amen you see that's more important and
[58:57] that's more powerful than any words that
[58:59] we could say is a life to be lived
[59:03] amen many people will never give maybe a
[59:07] time of day for anything to be spoken
[59:09] verbally but your life continues to
[59:12] thunder
[59:13] out greater than anything we could ever
[59:16] say am we've all had these moments where
[59:20] of all the things that be said they'll
[59:22] find you on your job and say could you
[59:24] keep this in prayer can you keep this in
[59:27] prayer I remember the last school I
[59:28] worked at I mean I had a wonderful
[59:30] principal that knew you know she was a
[59:32] uh you know a Christian as far as all
[59:34] that she knew and so forth she'd come
[59:36] get me out of the classroom I what your
[59:37] class you go go pray for this one down
[59:39] the hallway down here will you go pray
[59:41] for this one they just got news that
[59:42] their husband got cancer and so forth so
[59:44] I just go do it I'm doing what my boss
[59:46] told me to
[59:47] do that's
[59:50] right uh but I really enjoyed working
[59:53] for her and uh you know we we'd have
[59:56] some different times even when
[59:57] situations would arise and um she'd call
[59:59] me in the office I got a big try these
[1:00:01] are things coming up so forth well you
[1:00:02] pray for me sure well let's have prayer
[1:00:04] let's look to the God for guidance on
[1:00:05] this but you see there's things that in
[1:00:08] other words you to have confidence in
[1:00:10] your prayer uhhuh yes to have confidence
[1:00:13] in your prayer to have confidence that
[1:00:14] you know how how does that confidence
[1:00:16] have it's not by how great we are in our
[1:00:18] speaking it's about the life that's what
[1:00:21] brings
[1:00:22] confidence so I don't believe communion
[1:00:25] in it in all is to be a scary frightful
[1:00:28] time see remember Catholicism is all
[1:00:33] about taking communion they call it Mass
[1:00:35] but it's all with the pretense of I hope
[1:00:38] I'll be
[1:00:40] accepted that's not
[1:00:43] Christianity this is in remembrance not
[1:00:46] only of the work he's done but as we're
[1:00:48] looking at what he did we are partakers
[1:00:51] of what he's done and is doing in me
[1:00:54] thank you Lord
[1:00:55] yes amen we're not doing it in fear of I
[1:00:58] hope I'll be accepted we are doing it in
[1:01:00] saying I know what he's done for me I
[1:01:03] know what he's doing in my life and I am
[1:01:06] rejoicing in the liberty and the
[1:01:10] Forgiveness of my sins
[1:01:13] that'sall so I certainly believe there
[1:01:16] should always be that devotion and
[1:01:17] sincerity leading up to it and this is
[1:01:20] where that when we look at this where
[1:01:24] Paul would write in 1 Corinthians 5:7
[1:01:26] Purge out therefore the old leaven that
[1:01:30] you might be a new lump as ye are
[1:01:33] unleavened so Paul's not taking anything
[1:01:36] from them but remember here among the
[1:01:40] people there was a situation that was in
[1:01:43] the church that was going on and going
[1:01:46] on where you had that you know a young
[1:01:48] man living with his um you know his
[1:01:50] stepmother and all those things and
[1:01:52] brother Brandon brings that right back
[1:01:54] down down to when we lift from under the
[1:01:56] protection of the blood and brother
[1:01:58] Brandon brought that same thing on down
[1:01:59] to even when you had uh the one the one
[1:02:02] young man who even just called someone a
[1:02:05] Holy Roller or the people in a church a
[1:02:07] bunch of holy rollers and his dad got up
[1:02:09] and relied him from the protection of
[1:02:11] the blood why cuz he wouldn't make it
[1:02:14] right is that right now we s Paul is
[1:02:19] dealing with this here because it's
[1:02:21] things that's been let go and it's just
[1:02:24] get and what's happening what Paul's
[1:02:26] looking and what he's saying is Purge
[1:02:28] out therefore the old leaven what's
[1:02:30] leaven it's sin right and he notice that
[1:02:34] you might be a new lump as ye are
[1:02:38] unleavened so you are
[1:02:41] unleavened God's done a work in your
[1:02:44] life but you need to take out Purge out
[1:02:47] those things that are
[1:02:49] hindering from me working and
[1:02:52] manifesting myself through through you
[1:02:55] that's so
[1:02:56] good good
[1:03:00] preaching for even Christ Our Passover
[1:03:03] is sacrificed for us therefore let us
[1:03:08] keep the feast not with own Leen neither
[1:03:11] with the leaven of malice and wickedness
[1:03:14] but with the unleavened bread of
[1:03:16] sincerity and truth it's a It's Our
[1:03:20] Lives devoted to him amen I want to just
[1:03:23] you know is just praying and I'm just
[1:03:26] looking you know to the Lord I going
[1:03:29] back through in the message I've heard
[1:03:32] but now I see and you know I've been
[1:03:33] really drawing from that for well over a
[1:03:36] year now and preaching on job but as I
[1:03:39] was going back through it here even in
[1:03:41] the other day and just praying over some
[1:03:42] things Lord do I continue on with that
[1:03:45] of uh humility with things you know I've
[1:03:47] studied and I believe this also pertains
[1:03:49] to that of humility but I want you to
[1:03:51] notice that how brother BR would bring
[1:03:54] this with job in job's life and his walk
[1:03:56] with God uh how many of you read in the
[1:03:59] Book of Job and you're aware that job is
[1:04:01] he is standing even when accusations are
[1:04:05] coming and you have men that are trying
[1:04:08] to say this is why this is happening and
[1:04:10] this is why this is happening and this
[1:04:12] is why this is happening and I tell you
[1:04:14] what if job had not had a revelation he'
[1:04:18] have been blown this way he'd have been
[1:04:19] blown this way he'd have been blown this
[1:04:21] way you see it would have come from this
[1:04:23] church to come from this church or this
[1:04:25] website this website you got to know
[1:04:28] where you're standing that's right the
[1:04:31] objective of the Gospel is that we be
[1:04:34] not blown around as children right but
[1:04:37] that we're stable we're solid in Jesus
[1:04:39] Christ we know in whom we have believed
[1:04:42] we know where we belong and we're
[1:04:45] standing and so when we look at it this
[1:04:47] is where why that that that brother
[1:04:49] Brandon when he takes that whole message
[1:04:51] on I have heard but now I see you
[1:04:53] realize that job was in a place that he
[1:04:57] knew where he was standing that I've not
[1:05:00] sinned now job was not listen to me now
[1:05:03] job was not looking at himself he was
[1:05:07] looking at the
[1:05:09] sacrifice because God had spoke to job's
[1:05:13] life he had revealed the provided way
[1:05:16] like he did to Abel like he's done to
[1:05:18] every other believer is that right he
[1:05:20] did that and job responded to that word
[1:05:25] and now even job we don't we don't have
[1:05:28] all the way down through there but it's
[1:05:29] undoubted job had mistakes job had flaws
[1:05:33] job had failures but he had a sacrifice
[1:05:36] he had a revelation of his Passover and
[1:05:41] job had a revelation that in this re in
[1:05:44] this sacrifice this word that's been
[1:05:47] revealed lays my cleansing lays my
[1:05:51] healing lays the atoning work for me so
[1:05:54] so job's s complete confidence was in
[1:05:57] the sacrifice
[1:06:01] amen so good yes sir I know
[1:06:05] what I don't want to go all the way here
[1:06:08] but just let me drop this point but what
[1:06:11] even Satan was doing when caused his
[1:06:14] friends to turn against him and begin to
[1:06:16] say all of these all of these things it
[1:06:18] was actually started even though job
[1:06:20] where he was standing was true it
[1:06:22] started to pull job in into a place to
[1:06:24] where he was justifying himself let me
[1:06:28] just tell you
[1:06:29] something you or me and ourselves have
[1:06:33] can we have no grounds of justifying
[1:06:38] ourselves the best week you have you
[1:06:40] still are in need of the blood of Jesus
[1:06:43] Christ we are in need of his
[1:06:47] righteousness amen so the desire to be
[1:06:51] perfect it's not about that my one
[1:06:54] column my ones versus losses oh I've got
[1:06:57] more ones than I've got losses that's
[1:06:59] not what it's about our desire for
[1:07:01] Perfection is to please him
[1:07:04] amen that's that's that's what
[1:07:05] Perfection is is to have that that that
[1:07:07] right there that there then there's
[1:07:09] nothing that's in between that because
[1:07:11] even when things come up in our life and
[1:07:13] the Holy Spirit deals with our heart
[1:07:14] quickly say Lord forgive me and get it
[1:07:16] out of the way why that's Perfection
[1:07:19] working upon your
[1:07:21] life to be pleasing to the Lord
[1:07:25] so brother Bram was talking about faith
[1:07:26] having a channel to move into and he
[1:07:28] says it like this and I have heard but
[1:07:30] now I see he said job was checking
[1:07:34] himself with the genuine faith that God
[1:07:37] had give to him that he was just and
[1:07:41] that he had done everything that God
[1:07:43] required him to do now I want you to
[1:07:44] catch that job was checking himself with
[1:07:48] the genuine faith that God had given he
[1:07:51] was not checking himself by what the men
[1:07:54] were saying he was checking himself with
[1:07:57] the
[1:07:58] absolute that he had received which is
[1:08:02] that Revelation from God personally to
[1:08:07] him you you see what I'm saying because
[1:08:10] we will disappoint one
[1:08:12] another that's why you have to have an
[1:08:15] absolute in your life and that absolute
[1:08:18] is to be Christ revealed to you that he
[1:08:21] is my redeemer he's my savior he's my
[1:08:24] Lord he's my healer he's mine and I am
[1:08:27] his you have to have that absolute and
[1:08:30] that absolute comes between you and God
[1:08:35] alone then when everything else is
[1:08:37] against you you've got grounds that you
[1:08:40] can stand on it's an anchor that holds
[1:08:43] you it's an
[1:08:46] absolute this is why brother bam goes on
[1:08:49] to say he says when we're going to be
[1:08:50] prayed for for our sickness I wonder if
[1:08:53] we have done everything that God
[1:08:54] requires us to
[1:08:56] do I I I love this this personal placing
[1:09:01] we're we're approaching God on things
[1:09:03] now it should be the first thing have I
[1:09:05] done everything he's required me to do
[1:09:08] amen you see I think that should be a
[1:09:10] very a
[1:09:12] very a litmus test that before we're
[1:09:15] writing for others to pray are you in
[1:09:18] position to receive
[1:09:20] it are you hearing me now because you
[1:09:23] know we're not just going through acts
[1:09:24] of well I know I got this need in my
[1:09:26] life but God will never move if the
[1:09:29] Channel's not right so listen if you're
[1:09:32] praying and asking God the thing that
[1:09:34] you also have we have to be listen
[1:09:36] friends God God's not standing there
[1:09:38] ashamed for you and I to say Lord my
[1:09:40] heart's not in the right channel God
[1:09:42] wants us to be honest with him am cuz he
[1:09:45] sees it anyhow amen he already
[1:09:49] knows right and it's what God wants us
[1:09:52] to to be honest with him and say Lord
[1:09:53] Lord I now want my life my heart in the
[1:09:55] right Channel and as a believer that
[1:09:58] should be an examination because listen
[1:10:00] friends just as much as an inspiration
[1:10:03] can drop for our healing as brother Bram
[1:10:05] goes on into here for other things just
[1:10:07] as much as that inspiration will drop
[1:10:09] for healing we are to be in channel for
[1:10:12] Rapture amen for that inspiration to
[1:10:17] drop let me tell you something God's not
[1:10:19] God's not going to move at the last 30
[1:10:21] seconds and get us ready to go God's
[1:10:24] getting us ready he sent a word to
[1:10:27] prepare us for that moment against that
[1:10:30] day
[1:10:31] amen so that's the reason you know when
[1:10:34] let me just move on from there this is
[1:10:36] why when the when as Peter would say in
[1:10:39] First Peter 4:17 the time has come that
[1:10:42] judgment must begin at the house of
[1:10:45] God and if it first begin at us what
[1:10:48] shall the end be of them that obey not
[1:10:50] the gospel listen how brother brandham
[1:10:53] approaches this and how can I
[1:10:55] overcome he says when we come here we
[1:10:58] are here for one specific purpose
[1:11:03] right this is the house of correction am
[1:11:07] this is the throne this is the Throne of
[1:11:10] God and judgment Goes Forth from the
[1:11:13] house of
[1:11:15] God now if you just say Lord I'll lay
[1:11:18] aside even all my complexes against
[1:11:21] correction I'll lay aside all of my
[1:11:24] complexes about this because as soon as
[1:11:26] a scripture or something can be read
[1:11:28] like this you can
[1:11:29] just but you got to understand when God
[1:11:32] is coming to correct you he's not doing
[1:11:34] it out of frustration
[1:11:36] amen God never chastens us out of
[1:11:42] frustration that's so good he doesn't do
[1:11:44] that and God knows exactly what you're
[1:11:47] able to handle and I'm able to handle no
[1:11:50] more than just when when our children we
[1:11:52] come to a place to R realize when do we
[1:11:55] start to discipline
[1:11:59] them there's got to be a
[1:12:02] time right there's a time where they
[1:12:04] start you start seeing where they're
[1:12:06] recognizing and then they're starting to
[1:12:08] push the envelope a little bit and
[1:12:10] you're realizing boundaries must be
[1:12:12] established here I mean they can't help
[1:12:14] it when they're so small they cry right
[1:12:16] they cry you might say I know some big
[1:12:18] crybabies but you you've got people that
[1:12:20] listen as a baby they don't how and
[1:12:22] they're not doing it Defiance like well
[1:12:24] they're really screaming here they're
[1:12:26] they're they're two months old they
[1:12:27] don't know how else to
[1:12:29] respond but when you start seeing the no
[1:12:32] and then that's when correction comes is
[1:12:34] to establish boundaries for their health
[1:12:37] wow how do we get
[1:12:39] here but you see what what real
[1:12:41] correction is about it's not about
[1:12:43] despising it's not about frustration
[1:12:46] it's real genuine
[1:12:49] love because what correction does the
[1:12:51] Bible says is Drive the foolishness out
[1:12:53] of the heart Hallelujah God doesn't he
[1:12:57] just like God knows when to do it he
[1:12:58] knows when to he knows when to bring
[1:13:00] correction how to bring correction he
[1:13:01] watches over all these things in our
[1:13:03] life and I'm glad you know God God
[1:13:05] doesn't operate the way that sometimes
[1:13:07] even in the timeline and even the way to
[1:13:10] bring correction cuz we might be looking
[1:13:12] at it that it's something that my it's
[1:13:13] got to be something if maybe if I can
[1:13:15] put the visual where the belts got to
[1:13:16] come off and it's you know spiritually
[1:13:19] speaking here even where the belt's
[1:13:21] going to come off correct correct is not
[1:13:23] always that there's many times you've
[1:13:25] received correction I've received
[1:13:27] correction even on your job you've
[1:13:29] received correction and it hasn't been a
[1:13:31] demoting a Dem meriting or where you've
[1:13:33] been docked in pay or kicked out of work
[1:13:34] for a day there's times where correction
[1:13:36] can simply come hey don't do it like
[1:13:39] this do it like that it's correction so
[1:13:42] correction is not always something
[1:13:44] that's right flames of fire shooting out
[1:13:48] of their eye it's not always correction
[1:13:51] that's right that's good but it doesn't
[1:13:53] matter how we take it it's true because
[1:13:56] if we don't take it in that way and in
[1:13:58] that
[1:13:59] manner then there will
[1:14:01] be why that's his
[1:14:03] grace brother said here we come together
[1:14:06] and we gather here and we are under the
[1:14:08] leadership of the Holy
[1:14:11] Spirit and the Holy Spirit is among us
[1:14:13] and we're here to take Reckoning among
[1:14:17] ourselves that means to to calculate to
[1:14:19] think of to see where our short places
[1:14:22] are our
[1:14:24] shortcomings and how can we catch from
[1:14:27] where we should be over to where we
[1:14:30] ought to be now where we are and where
[1:14:33] we ought to be so that's the whole
[1:14:37] purpose of Us coming here amen it's it's
[1:14:40] God coming and let me just say something
[1:14:43] friends as I said correction itself
[1:14:45] isn't alt together you're doing this
[1:14:46] wrong you're doing that wrong no
[1:14:48] remember brother BR says study where we
[1:14:49] are and catch where we need to be yes
[1:14:53] that's
[1:14:55] good when I worked at the
[1:14:58] greenhouse my boss no doubt he kept me
[1:15:00] on in the Summer where with a couple
[1:15:02] other guys that played football man some
[1:15:05] of the work he'd have us do I know it
[1:15:06] was just it was like cleanup work but it
[1:15:08] was hard work right picking going down
[1:15:11] them plastic green houses on my hands
[1:15:13] and knees picking out weeds before he
[1:15:15] put the black tart down be 10 and
[1:15:18] something degrees in there with them
[1:15:19] fans and my nose didn't respond to that
[1:15:22] well bloody nose and things and he'd run
[1:15:24] out for a little bit swigging the water
[1:15:27] down but I I look back on this time and
[1:15:31] there was things that when I would stand
[1:15:32] there this is for me and I how God has
[1:15:36] made me but I also think that we all
[1:15:37] kind of look this I would I wanted to
[1:15:39] know what's the plan for the day is this
[1:15:43] all I'm going to be doing today what's
[1:15:45] the outcome what's the goal why so I
[1:15:47] know checkpoints along the way right
[1:15:49] we're going to do these three green
[1:15:50] houses you're going to do these three
[1:15:52] green houses today then we're going to
[1:15:53] come to the warehouse and we're going to
[1:15:54] stack trays and it's like you know where
[1:15:57] you're
[1:15:58] at that's how God does that's why this
[1:16:01] bride message listen to me now that's
[1:16:03] why this bride message is not a message
[1:16:07] of man handling
[1:16:10] man because you're not brought in
[1:16:13] position by
[1:16:16] pressure that's good you're brought in
[1:16:18] position by the Holy
[1:16:22] Ghost that's right hallu Israel gets put
[1:16:25] back by national pressure but we're not
[1:16:27] put back by naal national pressure we're
[1:16:30] put back by the Holy Ghost and God will
[1:16:33] use measures of Correction but what I'm
[1:16:35] trying to say to you is is that what
[1:16:37] greater way of correcting when you're
[1:16:39] even learning a job you're looking at
[1:16:41] something is to see one who is perfect
[1:16:44] calling you to
[1:16:46] Perfection so you don't have a fallen
[1:16:49] image speaking to a fallen image you
[1:16:52] have the image of Jesus Christ reflected
[1:16:55] through Fallen images but it's him that
[1:16:58] we're looking at it's him that we're
[1:17:00] seeing we're looking unto Jesus the
[1:17:02] author and the finisher of it that's why
[1:17:05] he the word is to be set before us
[1:17:09] because he's what we're to strive for
[1:17:11] he's what we're to press for because our
[1:17:13] life is to be molded Amen to match his
[1:17:21] image sure
[1:17:26] shortcomings we're here to see where our
[1:17:29] short places
[1:17:32] are boy what a comfortable thing to look
[1:17:35] at
[1:17:35] huh where you going going to let my get
[1:17:39] my shortcomings made
[1:17:42] known
[1:17:44] right
[1:17:45] yeah but our shortcomings are
[1:17:49] faults failures to meet a certain
[1:17:52] standard
[1:17:54] typically in a person's character plan
[1:17:56] or system and we all have them yeah see
[1:18:01] the Holy Ghost is an inward work that
[1:18:04] begins inwardly and comes outward right
[1:18:08] amen he works from the inside out true
[1:18:13] the Holy Ghost is the gift of God to be
[1:18:15] born again it's God's Sovereign Grace
[1:18:18] but our character is a
[1:18:21] victory and victories do not come
[1:18:23] without battles and guess who the
[1:18:26] battles are not my brother not my sister
[1:18:29] not my boss not my this the battle is my
[1:18:32] own self right contending with my own
[1:18:36] self when here is the word in front of
[1:18:38] me well brother Samuel they're acting
[1:18:40] disobedient to the word but your
[1:18:42] attitude might be disobedient to the
[1:18:43] character of Christ and God is allowing
[1:18:46] that to be showed up to see will you
[1:18:48] allow him to mold and make you and give
[1:18:52] you overcoming Gra in that
[1:18:54] area don't mean that it's never going to
[1:18:56] bother you but you have to recognize the
[1:18:58] devil at every one of his tricks and
[1:19:00] recognize then that the god in you has
[1:19:02] already overcome that
[1:19:05] thing this is why brother Bram could say
[1:19:08] in the message Faith forgive us of our
[1:19:09] shortcomings all of the things that
[1:19:11] we've done that's wrong even our wrong
[1:19:13] thoughts right we pray that you'll
[1:19:16] forgive us on our motives if they're not
[1:19:17] just according to Thy word and thy will
[1:19:20] forgive us Lord and let us ask Act only
[1:19:23] in thy will Amen in the message Look
[1:19:26] Away to
[1:19:27] Jesus brother Bram is just talking about
[1:19:29] the effect of the third pool coming into
[1:19:32] his own
[1:19:34] home with a healing of his
[1:19:36] wife and he opens and he says we thank
[1:19:40] we are thankful father forgive us of our
[1:19:44] shortcomings I know that seems very very
[1:19:47] simple but that's very much a part of
[1:19:49] our prayer amen because we have them
[1:19:54] we have where we've missed the
[1:19:56] mark right I mean when I'm shooting my
[1:19:59] bow in or testing that out or you
[1:20:00] shooting a gun you don't go out there to
[1:20:02] say man I wonder where we can shoot this
[1:20:03] Arrow so we can go find
[1:20:05] it no way sometimes they get dug in the
[1:20:08] ground and you don't find them to a year
[1:20:09] later you what do you do you set the
[1:20:11] target up and you try to hit the target
[1:20:14] but you don't all of a sudden go out to
[1:20:15] 40 yards and do it you get you you you
[1:20:18] go in close and then you work your way
[1:20:19] back out and you're seeing where your
[1:20:21] grouping is at you're shot that are
[1:20:23] fired is it around where I'm aiming
[1:20:26] because if you can hit it close up you
[1:20:29] hit it further
[1:20:31] back right and the reason you're you're
[1:20:33] doing what they call sighting it in
[1:20:35] because you got to tune it there's some
[1:20:36] things that's got to be dialed in you're
[1:20:38] drawing about all my no it's not hitting
[1:20:39] right what do you do you you you you
[1:20:42] dial it in why do you do that you say me
[1:20:45] brother Samuel I don't even hunt but you
[1:20:48] you're getting the point though right
[1:20:50] why why why is that done it's done so
[1:20:52] that when it matters you're
[1:20:55] ready that's why it's important as we're
[1:20:59] coming to the house of God we just don't
[1:21:01] shoot our gun in shoot our bow in and
[1:21:04] say bless God I can put it in the case I
[1:21:06] got it all sighted
[1:21:09] in no it needs to be
[1:21:12] checked continuously amen why because
[1:21:16] we've got to Target The Rapture that
[1:21:19] we're focused on
[1:21:21] Amen
[1:21:23] least little things even sometimes in
[1:21:25] travel were different ones as I've heard
[1:21:27] I've never traveled myself and had
[1:21:29] things toted or the gun or bow or things
[1:21:31] like that but different ones where
[1:21:32] they've traveled with those things and
[1:21:34] they get to the location they're going
[1:21:35] to hunt and then they find out they go
[1:21:38] out there and they test it why because
[1:21:41] during the trip even though it's padded
[1:21:43] it's got such padding that squeezes that
[1:21:46] gun in that case or that bow in that c
[1:21:48] it squeezed so tight it looks like oh
[1:21:50] this is nothing's going to move move
[1:21:52] this sight out of line you test it
[1:21:55] anyhow why because it matters that's
[1:21:57] right and many times little bumps little
[1:22:02] turbulences little things of Life can
[1:22:05] get it out of sink that's so good that's
[1:22:07] why we always need to test it on the
[1:22:11] target amen it's a checkup
[1:22:16] that's look look how brother Ram says
[1:22:18] this we are small people we are
[1:22:20] uneducated more or less an illiterate
[1:22:22] people but we are so thankful that we
[1:22:24] have a great omnipotent God who watches
[1:22:27] over and cares for us for we don't know
[1:22:30] how to care for
[1:22:32] ourselves we commit ourselves to
[1:22:36] you the Bible says in Proverbs 14:15 the
[1:22:39] simple believeth every word but The
[1:22:41] Prudent man lookth well to his
[1:22:44] going you know you speak of this of of
[1:22:47] the
[1:22:48] checkups I know that uh when we talk of
[1:22:51] checkups it's not like when we're sick
[1:22:52] you know anybody a lot of times when
[1:22:54] you're sick you we would go to the
[1:22:55] doctor or we go somewhere like that and
[1:22:57] we we want to we want to hey whatever if
[1:23:00] there's a assistance that's needed we
[1:23:01] want to feel better but yet we
[1:23:03] understand we're talking about checkups
[1:23:04] here it's more than it's not just about
[1:23:06] when we're sick but it's even in the
[1:23:08] times that we and ourselves we feel very
[1:23:10] good we feel well and every one of us
[1:23:12] have been listen don't go to sleep on me
[1:23:14] now everyone don't go oh no but saying
[1:23:17] my wife's been nagging me about this I
[1:23:18] don't want to do that I I'm sorry I
[1:23:21] don't mean to get you in a bad mood but
[1:23:23] keep it spiritual
[1:23:25] here you know the the the screenings the
[1:23:30] physical exams that you have to
[1:23:32] do you don't have to do it they
[1:23:35] recommend you do it why do they
[1:23:37] recommend you do it why is some of the
[1:23:38] ages and things that they change why do
[1:23:40] they do that brother Samuel they're just
[1:23:43] after
[1:23:46] money
[1:23:48] okay friends I we we understand certain
[1:23:51] things but why is is it that they put
[1:23:53] that out there like that with screenings
[1:23:55] right why do they have screenings to be
[1:23:57] done why do they have things what's the
[1:23:59] objective is to try to work in
[1:24:02] prevention before something takes
[1:24:05] place is that right how many individuals
[1:24:09] that when they went for certain
[1:24:11] screenings didn't want to go but boy are
[1:24:14] they glad they caught that
[1:24:15] cancer yeah they're
[1:24:19] grateful right there's so there's times
[1:24:23] that even when we would go in maybe
[1:24:24] we're feeling something in our body that
[1:24:26] we can't even explain what's going on so
[1:24:30] immediately like any wise person we do
[1:24:33] we call up
[1:24:36] Google sure enough I've got this thank
[1:24:39] God that thank God we can't print out
[1:24:42] pharmacy license because I'm sure we'd
[1:24:44] all have our Pharmacy Li I need to write
[1:24:46] out this prescription they have said I
[1:24:47] have this this this this and this sure
[1:24:49] enough that's you know what I feel like
[1:24:51] that now oh my goodness yep I'm I'm
[1:24:52] feeling it have this
[1:25:01] prescription there's a lot of things
[1:25:02] that can change why do those ages change
[1:25:04] why do they change ages when you get
[1:25:06] certain screenings why have they done
[1:25:07] that cu the hybrid condition that we're
[1:25:10] in yep the hybrid
[1:25:14] food well bless God you know my parents
[1:25:16] ate biscuits and gravy every morning and
[1:25:19] man I should be able to do yeah but they
[1:25:21] things were a little bit different yeah
[1:25:23] and even the way things were right I
[1:25:26] mean you're not talking to a person that
[1:25:28] don't like more biscuits and gravy more
[1:25:29] than anybody else I love
[1:25:31] it let me just say it like
[1:25:33] this it'd be better to have a
[1:25:36] checkup than to have an out autopsy
[1:25:40] right
[1:25:41] yep because an autopsy there's nothing
[1:25:44] you can do about it y the results are
[1:25:49] final that's why it's important to have
[1:25:51] a spiritual checkup
[1:25:53] continuously let our lives be evaluated
[1:25:56] by the word of God because once it
[1:25:59] passes out of this lifetime we we don't
[1:26:01] have the next opportunity we don't have
[1:26:03] that opportunity now it becomes an
[1:26:05] autopsy what happened to this person
[1:26:06] well they turn a letting down here this
[1:26:08] starting to happen and this and it
[1:26:09] becomes a shipwreck a car wreck becomes
[1:26:11] something that when they're wrecked off
[1:26:13] what happened oh it started with this it
[1:26:14] started with that it started with this
[1:26:15] just little things and now what
[1:26:19] happened right because an autopsy is
[1:26:21] going in to find out
[1:26:24] internally what was it that led to this
[1:26:27] death that way that's what was the
[1:26:33] cause that's why we need spiritual
[1:26:36] checkups not just wait for communion
[1:26:40] service but allow the Holy Spirit every
[1:26:42] moment of our life
[1:26:45] Lord examine my
[1:26:49] life I get many other scriptures here
[1:26:52] but the the the thought of is is already
[1:26:54] all brought together David is asking
[1:26:57] God here and I do want to read maybe one
[1:27:01] scripture David is re is referring and
[1:27:03] asking the Lord in verse 26 or verse two
[1:27:07] of Psalms
[1:27:08] 26 examine me oh
[1:27:11] Lord and prove me and try my Reigns in
[1:27:17] my
[1:27:19] heart this is what we want
[1:27:23] you know it takes it takes
[1:27:26] humility it takes first of all it takes
[1:27:28] humility to go in for a checkup it takes
[1:27:30] humility for us to allow the word to
[1:27:33] examine our life you realize just coming
[1:27:35] to church is not enough humility that's
[1:27:38] right you've got to let the word examine
[1:27:41] your
[1:27:43] life it's got to open up to a place to
[1:27:45] where God how do you see
[1:27:48] me listen friends don't judge yourself
[1:27:50] by well the person that's school or the
[1:27:52] person might oh man you see them they
[1:27:54] got nose rings all over they got purple
[1:27:55] pink hair they got this well sure I
[1:27:59] could look at that and feel pretty good
[1:28:01] but that's not what you're to judge by
[1:28:03] you don't judge yourself by somebody
[1:28:05] else you judge yourself by the
[1:28:07] word CU if you judge yourself by
[1:28:10] somebody else you'll feel pretty good
[1:28:11] man I got this thing all I'm a better
[1:28:13] person than them I mean I mean look at
[1:28:15] them they're all this and that you're
[1:28:17] looking at the wrong thing that's right
[1:28:20] and you know what that does that
[1:28:21] produces produces a condition of
[1:28:24] lukewarmness that's goodl to where all
[1:28:28] what you're looking at and evaluating
[1:28:29] your life by is something that you're
[1:28:33] hit you're hitting it a little bit
[1:28:35] closer to the Target but that's not what
[1:28:37] it's about right it's about where are
[1:28:39] you in your walk with the Lord what does
[1:28:41] God say Amen what does he say what does
[1:28:45] he say about where I am that's that's
[1:28:48] that's the open that now listen friends
[1:28:49] we should be able to speak on these
[1:28:52] terms like this and not become oh I
[1:28:55] don't know where I'm at I I don't we
[1:28:57] should be able to be able to look at the
[1:28:59] word of God and invite God to evaluate
[1:29:02] our lives and not in a manner do I have
[1:29:04] the Holy Ghost don't I have the Holy
[1:29:05] Ghost but evaluate our lives in a term
[1:29:07] to realize I know where my heart is at
[1:29:09] and you know where your heart's at if
[1:29:10] you don't have if you haven't moved to
[1:29:12] that place where it's a love affair
[1:29:15] because when it's religion it's
[1:29:16] miserable how do you know been there
[1:29:18] done that got the t-shirt it's miserable
[1:29:22] right because it's just form there's
[1:29:24] nothing in the
[1:29:26] heart It's Not A Love Affair it's
[1:29:30] keeping myself looking right for
[1:29:31] everybody else around me or if I don't
[1:29:33] do this God's going to be out to get me
[1:29:36] that's not a love that's fear that's
[1:29:38] right oh I want to be pleasing there's a
[1:29:40] difference between wanting to be
[1:29:42] pleasing to him and being fearful in a
[1:29:45] tormenting
[1:29:47] fear God's desire through Calvary was to
[1:29:52] bring the love of God into our hearts
[1:29:54] that we could see the love of God
[1:29:58] perceive it that he laid down his life
[1:30:00] for us and then receive that fire that
[1:30:03] was in his bosom into ours that's so
[1:30:06] good and it's a love affair you know
[1:30:09] what love does love does makes you do
[1:30:11] things even when you don't feel like
[1:30:13] doing it that's right ites love causes
[1:30:16] you to sacrifice your own will your own
[1:30:20] ideas it causes you to evaluate things
[1:30:22] and look at what's really important
[1:30:25] that's what that's what real love
[1:30:27] does I want you to think of this here
[1:30:30] David's asking God examine
[1:30:33] me now I know how many
[1:30:37] people how many can carry this Bible
[1:30:40] around or even have our
[1:30:43] message but how many invite
[1:30:46] this because you see when we get into
[1:30:49] this place of examination it's it's
[1:30:51] bringing
[1:30:53] Jesus off the cross out of the grave and
[1:30:56] personal to our lives that's so good
[1:31:00] where does our lives match up with the
[1:31:02] word that's so good examine me Lord now
[1:31:06] I'm going to tell you the heart of the
[1:31:09] Bride of Jesus Christ it is a heart that
[1:31:12] desires to be examined and to be
[1:31:15] pleasing to him yes
[1:31:19] sir
[1:31:20] Hallelujah
[1:31:23] it's like when
[1:31:25] we like when I would you know you had
[1:31:27] had to have physical exams when I played
[1:31:29] Sports it was no choice then you'd go in
[1:31:32] there I remember some guys I could call
[1:31:34] their names right now I went to school
[1:31:35] with in s Dusky these guys
[1:31:37] were physical
[1:31:41] specimens I mean that I'm not
[1:31:45] exaggerating but after they get when
[1:31:46] they went through that physical
[1:31:50] exam some of these young men men that I
[1:31:52] had I'm talking about out of my class
[1:31:54] they wanted to play basketball they
[1:31:56] wanted to play football boy we we would
[1:31:58] have loved to have had them I mean I
[1:31:59] guess if they'd have been a team player
[1:32:00] I don't know how they'd have been on a
[1:32:01] team but as far as athleticism I mean
[1:32:04] the guys were just you know they
[1:32:05] probably came out of the wound
[1:32:07] defined you know there's people like
[1:32:09] that you know
[1:32:12] they any we won't go there but they get
[1:32:15] him in a physical exam but they had a
[1:32:18] heart
[1:32:19] murmur and they couldn't play
[1:32:24] they wanted
[1:32:26] to but they had a heart condition that
[1:32:29] wouldn't allow them to
[1:32:32] play you see you have to let the word
[1:32:35] discern your heart is there anything in
[1:32:37] your heart that's presenting that's
[1:32:40] preventing you preventing God from
[1:32:43] bringing you fully
[1:32:45] in that's okay oh Lord I I I really want
[1:32:49] I I really want to serve you but will
[1:32:51] you have listen listen you have to
[1:32:52] evaluate your heart and then listen
[1:32:55] friends that evaluation of your heart
[1:32:57] never
[1:32:59] stops never
[1:33:04] stops God it's not us waiting on God
[1:33:07] it's God waiting on us that's
[1:33:10] right and I think my what if they would
[1:33:13] have just what if it had been me I mean
[1:33:14] if it had been to me like hey I want
[1:33:16] this guy man he'd be a good he'd be a
[1:33:18] good he'd be a good safety this gu be a
[1:33:21] good safy Rock Solid and coming up there
[1:33:23] flying and man it'd be great what if
[1:33:25] they to ask
[1:33:26] me hey Sam what do you think man I think
[1:33:29] this guy be good as
[1:33:31] us I'd be going what I see on the
[1:33:35] outside but what's on the inside if he
[1:33:38] gets out there he could
[1:33:41] die that's why it's important friends
[1:33:45] that you go all the way with the Lord
[1:33:48] amen go all the way with him let let him
[1:33:52] do a a full work a full change in your
[1:33:55] life let him examine every area of your
[1:33:59] life and if you put any any any signs up
[1:34:02] restricted area listen I'm just going to
[1:34:05] tell you God won't blow it up God won't
[1:34:07] tear it down you just pull
[1:34:10] back he pull he's a gentleman he'll
[1:34:13] never force himself on
[1:34:16] anyone oh brother Samuel I've accepted
[1:34:18] him as my savior he'll stand on the
[1:34:20] welcome mat won't move a one foot more
[1:34:24] in your life right you are the one who
[1:34:27] is in control of how deep he
[1:34:33] goes if you want him to stay on the
[1:34:35] welcome mat he'll stay there well I
[1:34:37] don't want him to stay there well then
[1:34:38] say
[1:34:39] Lord take everything out of me yes well
[1:34:42] brother s what's that mean take
[1:34:44] everything out of me like like I've got
[1:34:46] magazines plugged in here no it's
[1:34:48] desires take anything that I have the
[1:34:51] slightest
[1:34:53] value where it's even equal with you or
[1:34:56] even a little above you take everything
[1:34:58] that I
[1:35:00] value and let it rise to the place to
[1:35:02] where I only value him and him
[1:35:06] alone amen that's good because then
[1:35:08] you're in a place of surrender yes and
[1:35:11] let me say this that's ongoing in your
[1:35:14] Christian
[1:35:15] walk God continues to deal with our
[1:35:19] lives once he's brought us into that
[1:35:21] that
[1:35:22] place there's things that we can testify
[1:35:25] in our lives that maybe in the first
[1:35:26] parts of our Christian Journey we can
[1:35:28] look back on and say
[1:35:30] wow God's brought me from there to where
[1:35:33] I am now some things that I used to hold
[1:35:36] on to and I'm not talking about you
[1:35:38] understand friends as Believers I'm not
[1:35:39] talking about running around the world
[1:35:41] I'm talking about things that we look at
[1:35:42] in the way that you begin to look at as
[1:35:43] a believer of you begin to look at in
[1:35:45] terms of what things that hinder the
[1:35:49] working of the Lord in my life that's
[1:35:52] how you evaluate it's not about oh I
[1:35:54] because Paul said all things are lawful
[1:35:56] unto
[1:35:59] me but all all things are not expedient
[1:36:06] right you Lov
[1:36:10] him that's why in this exam you know
[1:36:12] when we you have it they look for
[1:36:14] sometimes you can see things outwardly
[1:36:15] right you can see things that sometimes
[1:36:17] the doctors will look at things and they
[1:36:18] can tell outwardly hey hey something's
[1:36:20] wrong outwardly and listen friends let
[1:36:22] me just say this that's why that within
[1:36:24] this the scripture says let a man
[1:36:27] examine himself what I just read here
[1:36:30] for our text let a man examine himself
[1:36:32] you know what God desires for us to do
[1:36:37] is to look at that word take the word
[1:36:41] and examine our own lives by
[1:36:44] it that's you talk about making God
[1:36:47] proud and our lives surrendering to that
[1:36:50] this is why the scriptures says the same
[1:36:52] word that we in that scripture we used
[1:36:55] examine
[1:36:57] himself you know that same word is also
[1:37:00] same meaning same meaning in the Greek
[1:37:01] is the same word that says because they
[1:37:04] did not
[1:37:05] like to retain
[1:37:08] God in their
[1:37:11] conscience that's good God gave them up
[1:37:14] to a reprobate
[1:37:16] mind they didn't want him I don't want
[1:37:19] this condemnation in my mind mind I
[1:37:22] don't want we're living in that time the
[1:37:24] world hates
[1:37:27] absolutes that's right they hate the
[1:37:29] absolute of traditional family hate the
[1:37:30] absolute all of these things they hate
[1:37:32] that you know where that come from from
[1:37:33] the pits of hell that's
[1:37:38] right yes sir Satan knows if he can get
[1:37:40] people away from even the protections of
[1:37:42] the word he can destroy them Y and
[1:37:45] sometimes people are walking under under
[1:37:47] their they are still partaking as far as
[1:37:49] in a manner of certain principles and
[1:37:52] yet yet Satan can come around so
[1:37:56] slightly through media through all other
[1:37:58] things because let me tell you something
[1:38:00] it's Spirits yes and it works to do what
[1:38:03] remove that fortification that
[1:38:04] protection remove them from all of those
[1:38:07] principles but this is why it's got to
[1:38:09] be more than just a word you're holding
[1:38:11] out here it's got to be more than just a
[1:38:14] principle out here it's got to be the
[1:38:16] Principal in here it's got to be
[1:38:18] something that's holding you
[1:38:23] it's evaluating it's God listening to
[1:38:25] our our lives I'm glad that you know
[1:38:28] when they go in to do blood work
[1:38:30] remember one of the first times when
[1:38:31] they they did some of that at school you
[1:38:33] I want to go I want to blood work
[1:38:37] done I don't want to T stff done you
[1:38:40] know because you start thinking what's
[1:38:41] my cholesterol level going to
[1:38:43] be what's my this going to
[1:38:48] be you know what you can feel very fine
[1:38:50] you can feel good
[1:38:52] good but blood work don't lie that's

[1:39:17] watching I've been watching I've been
[1:39:19] blood work don't lie right so you know
[1:39:23] sometimes listen friends sometimes even
[1:39:24] what we see on the outside let me just
[1:39:27] tell you something don't diagnose one
[1:39:30] another because sometimes what you see
[1:39:33] on the outside may not have anything to
[1:39:35] do with sin it might actually be having
[1:39:37] everything to do with something that a
[1:39:40] person is going
[1:39:42] through so God's not called us to
[1:39:44] examine one another he's the one that
[1:39:47] examines us and then we take what he has
[1:39:50] said and examine ourselves how by
[1:39:53] presenting ourselves to him and even cuz
[1:39:56] sometimes everything can seem so right
[1:39:58] on the outside oh the teas is the teas
[1:40:00] is crossed the eyes is dotted and this
[1:40:02] is right and this is right and that is
[1:40:04] right but God said let's do a little bit

[1:40:51] that checkup is about it's for
[1:40:55] prevention come on we can finish this an
[1:40:57] ounce of
[1:40:59] prevention worth a pound of cure that's
[1:41:02] an oldie but a
[1:41:05] goodie this is what the holy
[1:41:08] spirit is doing friends not just service
[1:41:12] after service that's why it's important
[1:41:13] that we as we're in the house of God
[1:41:16] you're tuning in you're it's evaluating
[1:41:19] our Liv not just listen don't don't I
[1:41:21] encourage you it'd be like this you go
[1:41:23] to the doctor you get the results how
[1:41:25] many you know what I'm talking about in
[1:41:26] the
[1:41:27] natural no hands are going up just head
[1:41:30] nods just nod the head
[1:41:39] buddy it matters what you do with the
[1:41:41] results yeah yeah it matters what you
[1:41:45] do with what the word is saying about
[1:41:49] your life
[1:41:51] in the
[1:41:53] service at the end of the service and
[1:41:55] after the service don't take your
[1:41:58] results and put them on the
[1:42:01] counter and then your wife has to say
[1:42:04] what are these here put these in your
[1:42:06] office they go here that's where
[1:42:08] everything else goes I just put here
[1:42:10] just put them in here put them in here
[1:42:11] put them in there put them in there you
[1:42:12] know and it becomes like you don't leave
[1:42:15] things lay
[1:42:16] around that you care about
[1:42:19] right and let me tell you something the
[1:42:22] re exams that God brings our way he
[1:42:26] cares he
[1:42:27] cares do you
[1:42:30] care it's a moment a time that our lives
[1:42:34] would be really
[1:42:37] examined because I I want I want the
[1:42:40] checkups I need the
[1:42:42] checkups I I don't want to become a
[1:42:44] casualty that an autopsy has performed
[1:42:46] on what happened to them they were so on
[1:42:49] fire they were so fervent my it seemed
[1:42:52] like the world was going to come apart
[1:42:54] what happened oh it just started little
[1:42:58] by little a little bit of forsaking to
[1:43:01] assemble together forsaking prayer
[1:43:05] forsaking oh brother Samuel I read and I
[1:43:07] pray and I listen friends there's a lot
[1:43:09] of things that we can do understand me
[1:43:11] now
[1:43:13] religiously that's good but are you
[1:43:15] obeying all the work that's good do you
[1:43:18] evaluate all the work
[1:43:21] are you living day by day Moment by
[1:43:25] moment that I want my life to be
[1:43:27] pleasing to him amen In A Love Affair
[1:43:31] not like the Bible says let every man be
[1:43:35] careful for he that thinketh he standeth
[1:43:38] lest he
[1:43:41] fall why why would Paul put that in that
[1:43:44] that that chapter because in that
[1:43:46] chapter is where he's talking about God
[1:43:48] sent a prophet here came the pillar of
[1:43:50] Fire here came The Parting of the Red
[1:43:52] Sea here they were baptized unto Moses
[1:43:54] here came the Mana here was The Rock in
[1:43:56] the and they were just looking at all of
[1:43:58] this all around
[1:44:02] them no possibility in me
[1:44:06] falling you've already started to
[1:44:09] fall as soon as you begin to look and
[1:44:12] evaluate your life and your walk by
[1:44:16] something besides the word of God and
[1:44:20] it's not listen friends that's why it's
[1:44:21] not enough just to have our own
[1:44:24] little communal part just Among Us
[1:44:26] ourselves as our family and just among
[1:44:29] but we want the word of God yes because
[1:44:32] the word of God Don't Lie amen it's like
[1:44:35] the blood work it don't lie it gets down
[1:44:39] to where the needs are at in our life
[1:44:42] and this is our
[1:44:45] desire I want him to be on display yes
[1:44:49] Lord the Rapture is my
[1:44:53] goal that's what I'm that's what I'm
[1:44:56] looking forward to am and until that
[1:44:59] moment of catching away I want to live
[1:45:02] every
[1:45:03] moment pleasing to him amen that doesn't
[1:45:07] mean you've got to quit your job it just
[1:45:09] means you've got to Val you've got to
[1:45:10] Value him more than you value your job
[1:45:13] because after all he gave it to you and
[1:45:16] God never gives you something to take
[1:45:17] you away from his presence right
[1:45:21] oh that's too much of a burden you're
[1:45:22] listening to the wrong person you need
[1:45:25] to evaluate it based on the word of
[1:45:28] God it's a spiritual checkup right how
[1:45:31] many times they tell people hey you
[1:45:32] better slow down right you better slow
[1:45:35] down I can keep going I can keep
[1:45:38] going hey you got to slow
[1:45:42] down I say
[1:45:44] God continue to help us
[1:45:47] Lord a spiritual checkup regular
[1:45:52] checkups why it's
[1:45:55] prevention brother Bram identified that
[1:45:57] I'm closing brother Bram identified that
[1:46:00] I we
[1:46:02] just where the churches had got to they
[1:46:05] didn't aim to get there the the
[1:46:07] Pentecostal Church didn't need to get to
[1:46:08] where it is today but how did it how did
[1:46:11] that happen they
[1:46:13] neglected the examining by the word and
[1:46:17] it got to a place to where they no
[1:46:19] longer wanted to word
[1:46:21] to examine their lives you're not
[1:46:24] telling me I'm overweight you're not
[1:46:26] telling me I need to lose a few pounds
[1:46:28] this is fall buddy this is pumpkin pie
[1:46:30] season this is Apple Cris time not
[1:46:34] now oh I'll wait till after the first of
[1:46:36] the year that's when I'm really going to
[1:46:38] tone it
[1:46:40] down always putting off for another
[1:46:43] day and you can't and we do that it
[1:46:46] becomes easier easier easier easier but
[1:46:50] why put off to tomorrow what you can do
[1:46:54] today it's about this moment it's about
[1:46:57] this time it's about the moment of Lord
[1:47:00] I want every moment to count I want my
[1:47:03] life to match your word amen and I'll
[1:47:05] tell you the grace that is so solemnly
[1:47:07] and sovereignly given by God that even
[1:47:09] if you're not standing where you need to
[1:47:11] be standing today no matter where you're
[1:47:13] at God has sufficient
[1:47:16] Grace to release to you not only a
[1:47:19] pardoning of your sins but to also
[1:47:22] realign anything that's got out of line
[1:47:25] Thank You Lord because you start going
[1:47:27] off in one little area it'll lead to a
[1:47:29] greater angle friends that's why we need
[1:47:32] him amen that's why we need him that's
[1:47:35] why just us taking the word in according
[1:47:37] to our own reasonings it'll never work
[1:47:39] it's got to be him it's got to be him
[1:47:43] and when we can see it from him we can
[1:47:44] present ourselves and say forgive me
[1:47:46] Lord amen Lord let me rise and try
[1:47:49] again Lord Lord forgive me of my faults
[1:47:51] and my failures where I've missed the
[1:47:52] mark where I'm missing the mark Lord

[2:10:57] will we realize Lord as it stands as a
[2:10:59] symbol as we said here moments
[2:11:02] ago that God we in ourselves there's a
[2:11:07] testimony that we are
[2:11:09] partakers of your life and of your word
[2:11:14] you have transformed Our Lives we're no
[2:11:17] longer we're the
[2:11:19] same Lord we're we're Witnesses of what
[2:11:23] you've done in
[2:11:25] us a
[2:11:27] paradox and we ask that God that is this
[2:11:30] bread Lord representing the precious
[2:11:33] body of our Lord
[2:11:37] Jesus oh
[2:11:39] God when there was no way for us to get
[2:11:43] back you became the way back lord
[2:11:49] you stepped down lord God and took on a
[2:11:52] body of
[2:11:55] Flesh no wonder Lord as a prophet could
[2:11:57] call it what
[2:12:00] humiliation the king of glory stepped
[2:12:05] down to Adorn himself in a robe of Flesh
[2:12:09] and
[2:12:13] bone to pay that
[2:12:15] price of redemption that's what Grace
[2:12:19] really is
[2:12:20] Lord
[2:12:22] Grace is the
[2:12:25] result of when the price has been paid
[2:12:29] that's why we can preach Lord of this
[2:12:31] message of Grace
[2:12:34] because every requirement for a Kinsman
[2:12:38] has been met it has been
[2:12:41] [Music]
[2:12:44] satisfied thank you for going to Calvary
[2:12:47] for for us

[2:13:02] there was nothing Lord God that can
[2:13:04] cleanse the
[2:13:06] stain the stench the desires Lord can do
[2:13:10] the work but you shed your blood to pay
[2:13:13] the price to satisfy the debt
[2:13:18] to not only purchase us out of the slave
[2:13:21] market but such a purchase that we can
[2:13:26] never be sold
[2:13:28] again for we have come
[2:13:33] back into under the possession of our
[2:13:37] rightful
[2:13:39] owner oh God how we thank you Father for
