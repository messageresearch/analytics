the goodness of [Music] God hallelujah praise the name of the Lord amen that's just nothing but the truth isn't it and God is faithful in all things you know every time you God ask you to take a step in his word and whatever it might be God is faithful not only to lead you in that step but to lead you right there in that moment and he's right there with you you know when God brought Israel out of Egypt I don't don't think anybody thought about what are we going to eat how are we going to replace our clothes what about our shoes they didn't know that the journey itself was going to be over 40 years that's that wasn't God's choice but that was a decision they made but look even in those 40 years they didn't even have to look back to the Red Sea although God said remember I brought you out of Egypt they could look at their garments their clothes they've not even worn out they could see the goodness of God the Mana that fell they didn't have to go look for water water came looking for them that that's that's all God not just speaking of Israel but God was relaying his thoughts about you and I it's like with Noah why would a man build an ark on dry land not in a shipyard because God didn't need to bring the ship to the water God would bring the water to the ship once again God expressing his thoughts to you and I it's the mercy of God I I'm grateful for that tonight when man fell in the beginning no way to get back to God God came and made a way back for you and I it's the grace of God and how thankful we are for his Mercy I'm grateful we don't have to look far but we can see him in our own life we see him we see this token working we see the living reality of Jesus Christ and that's worth everything that's precious amen don't you love him tonight amen it's so good to be together Amen in the presence of the Lord and it's good to have brother Timothy a Shong here with us tonight and we're not going to prolong we want to invite him to go ahead and make his way forward I want to remind you as I mentioned to you on Sunday about um the prayer request for brother joshu and sister Sharon um there when she has her interview uh coming up for um the admittance into the United States uh that's on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving which is November 22nd that we would be in prayer many of the things that we just was talking with brother way at the beginning of the week many of the things they know within that day and sometimes then there's papers that sent uh within a few days later so I told him I said you know what I said in the beginning first of all it's a miracle and second of all we're not going to stop praying until we see the feet on the soil amen so you know the the the Church of the Living God there in the book of Acts they were praying for Peter and the angel of the Lord let him complete out of the city then Peter comes and knocks on the door and I'm sure their response is many times like you and I they open the door and there's Peter Wham they slam the door Peter's ghost Peter's theophany he's he's on and an incredible we're praying and we have faith in what we're praying but when God answers it startles us I love I love how God included that in the book of Acts don't you God doesn't care about Humanity being seen because it's deity that we glorify it's Christ that we glorify amen so we want to remember that in prayer also brother Brian read that about sister Fay right now and um we just had had prayer with her over the phone just a few moments ago so just continue to keep her in prayer that's Sister carper's Sister some of you no doubt remember her from when she would come here also the meetings this weekend with Brother John Sanger it'll be the first time that brother John Sanger has been here perhaps for some of you it'll be the first time you've heard brother John Sanger and uh brother John just has a wonderful Ministry and uh very very visual so my boys are already looking and saying is he bringing a U-Haul truck with visual displays because brother John is just that kind of a minister but he's just has just such a wonderful gift and brother John has ministered in many different um youth functions as well as there in the home church but uh with the young ones there and byc and just just a really wonderful gift and I believe we're going to be blessed this weekend so regular service on Sunday morning at 11:00 and then the youth service at 5:30 and all are invited to the youth service all are invited and I tell you what I think it's like this if I see our young people I want to get behind them I want to support them I want to support what's going on I know I didn't make it over there this past Sunday when they were doing the volley all volleyball but I was supporting him from a distance on that one but um we so appreciate that I want to say to uh brother Shane sister Lily brother Brian sister Mariah thank you for getting all that together for our young people this past uh Sunday evening so let's just get ready let's just I believe we're ready amen and it's so good to have brother Timothy here with us quite a miracle as he was sharing with it when he stood here uh on the way home and uh so we just uh I'm not sure if he can hear me back there or not I don't know if that sound's been turned up up or not so um but anyhow let's just continue to sing that song Amen I know we've sang it a lot but you know I don't think we've wore it out I think it's good and all my life you have been faithful that's my testimony know my life you have been so so good so so good with every bre that I am aable oh I will sing I'm going to sing the goodness of God I love your voice yes Lord Jesus you have led me through the fire thank you Lord Jesus and the darkest night you are

and uh thank you brother where is he okay whatever is God bless him yeah he back there for the open door given to me that any time I call as I'm coming around and say you are welcome so thank you for it my brother and my friend and I bring greetings to you from the Believers I came into the the country some few weeks ago to see the doctor and uh by God's grace he said everything is fine so we are grateful to the Lord so let's read a portion of the scripture so that I will not keep you standing I will let you seat while I will be standing so you enjoy the seat and I will be standing but it's okay I understand all right so we bless the name of the Lord and uh we'll read from the book of numbers let's read from Numbers Chapter 13 read some lines from numers 13 Numbers Chapter 13 let's read from verse 27 number 13 from verse 27 and they told him and said we came unto the land whether thou sentest us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are W and very great and moreover we saw the children of anak there the amalekites dwell in the land of the South and the Hittites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the Canaanite dwell by the Sea and by the coast of Jordan and Caleb steal the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil reports of the land which they had search unto the children of Israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that heated up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it were men of a great stature and there we saw the Giants the sons of anak which come of the Giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight may the Lord bless the reading of his word shall we please be seated amen let's read 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse 7 for we walk by faith and not by sight amen we walk by faith and not by sight in the book of the prophet Isaiah chapter 45 verse 22 the Lord said look unto me all ye ends of the Earth look unto me and be ye saved all the end of the Earth for I am God and there is none else amen hallelujah so we bless the name of the Lord again and uh I'm very grateful again to the almighty God for the opportunity given to me to be here and to Fellowship together with the Breen and I thank God so much that today by his grace I am standing on my feet last year I was here and I was very sick very very sick and I had to go through surgery and uh what they call it uh radical protonic prot Atomic uh uh surgery or whatever they call it and uh I have to deal with my prostate and uh yeah it was very very difficult somewhere last year or the year before yeah and I I I I was having problem I was not able to pee or want to go to the restroom and and there was nothing the urine not coming oh my it was very very difficult and uh I was just having pains and pains and pains and all sleepless nights and Sleepless days infections all kind of trouble so finally the Lord made a way for me to come travel back I mean travel to the US and uh that was in July last year July and I stayed for about 9 months in the US and I have to be seeing doctors here and there and finally they decided to do surgery because they said my Pro R has become so big and I was not able broken the chance or the way to urine so they have to do that and uh after that has been done complications came in and at a point I was not even able to walk I have to be using the we what they call it the Walker to be walking if I sit down I could not get up if I lie down I could not get up they have to pull me my wife has to pull me or my nephew has to PVE me or even to sit in the car I man to back able to sit down and then they have to I could not lift my leg like this they have to raise it and put it in and raise this and put it in ah it was it was just difficult but thank God for his grace that today I am standing on my feet by his grace I Knew You prayed for me and I thank you for your prayers that if you see me standing here is because you prayed and God answered your prayer he said God and is so good it's our savior is a God that answers prayer I work cath for nine months nine good months I could not PE on my own for 9 months I was wearing the catheter and uh when they took it out I have to be wearing Pampers I'm saying that because God has done it to give glory to Jehovah God and for you to know that whatever your condition might be God is Mindful and it's he's still in the business of healing right amen and and is still working and is still alive so whatever your challenge might be look to the promise of God don't look at the circumstances or the obstacles look at the promises of God I remember when I went to the doctor in Ghana and the check the doctor I said oh there is cancer and is and I said no you don't have to worry just a little it's a little spot there it's not spread I said but I was not worried anyway because when he said that the only thing that came to me do you fear cancer because I know the prophet preached that and he told us there is no fear there is no virtue in fear so you don't have to fear no matter what they said to you even if you are going to die the next day there is no need to fear it's just to believe he a faith we sign the pardon for you Hallelujah and even when I was living Ghana because we told what should we do I said no I told my wife let me stay in GH I said no no you have to go and some but B coffee got to hear about it and then he has to call that look brother if you can travel out just travel leave and come we have the best doctors and we see whatever can be done and the doctor when I was leaving GH I told me you know people go to America overseas they do surgery and they come back and the rest of their lives they will be wearing Pampers here and there but I thank God God is good he took care of me and today by his grace I don't wear Pampers yes and I'm saying this because I said to God if you hear me if you work I will wherever I go I will testify I said I testify to the glory of God and to The Shame of the devil so when God does something for us he doesn't want us to keep it he want us to testify you have to testify sometime people get afraid of testifying because Devil comes and when you testify you'll be sick again this and and I said to Satan if I get sick again he will heal me again I don't have problem with that yes sir when I was going through the trials and I said brother BR I'm said until God has finished with you nothing can take you out of this life that's just what I believe if I drop that today because because God has finished with me but until then nothing so we should not be tormented by the fear of death because he has not given us the spirit to fear he has given the spirit of sons and daughters that we can cry AB father and I was saying to Brother Sam said God is so good and it's always it's always on time amen I was booked to go to the hospital to do cystogram when after the surgery and uh I went first after the surgery last year by this time I was very very sick J they did the surgery on the 14th of November so today it's I think 16th so last year by this time oh it was very difficult so I give God the praise and I give God the honor and I give God the Adoration and so when I went to do the cystogram and then they said oh no it's not where they Stitch they have to open here there there five spots yeah and then it's okay you have to come back in 10 days 10 days in 10 days come back and then we went myself and my wife and at this time my sister and my nephew that we were staying with in the house they've left us to Africa so just the two of us were at home and it happened we went to the hospital in the that morning very fine went there but then when I was put on the table I went on lie on the table for the cystogram the whatever SC was to be taken and all of a sudden I was shaking shaking the whole table was moving vibrating so what is happening I said I don't know I didn't know what happened from there again I only saw myself in the emergency room so my wife said they called they came and called said who brought Timothy as sh so said do the I was lying and then they came they tried to fix things on me and then at that time he said all my system begin to shut down everything was going down and the doctors were looking at her she was looking at them but she was just praying and somehow by the grace of God he begin to pick up again God they give dreams and things but nothing but at a point he begin to pick up again so we give glory to God and then God is so good I said if this situation that I fell in or went in if it had happened while we were at home it would have been very difficult because we were strangers in the place nobody was with us the closest brother that was with us was 45 minutes away and my wife would not have know even how to call 911 because we are just strangers and the condition would have put her in a very bad shape but God is always right he always ahead of the enemy that he made it to happen right before the doctors and so right there they move into the emergency room so you can't beat God he's so mindful of us praise the name of the Lord and there was scripture that comes to me and said this also shall pass this also shall pass and I remember the scripture that says and it came to pass and I will say to myself this also shall pass and thank God it came to pass amen God is mindful I stayed in the emergency for 6 days when they did the surgery the next day I was discharged but this time I have to stay there for 6 days God is so good that he saw me through because he saw that I will be here this evening so he SP my life to be here this evening to give this testimony to you that no matter your situation keep your eyes on the promise because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever just to encourage ourselves this evening let's speak on keep your eyes on the promise not the obstacles Hallelujah he said now what made Caleb so sure of it when the opposition was so great it is according to what you are looking at Caleb was looking at the promise of God the other was looking at the circumstance if you go to look at the circumstances or to look at what is around you you are sure to fail but you must never look at what is around you don't look at the circumstances or what is around you the Lord Jehovah said in the book of Isaiah look unto me or ye an of the earth and you shall be saved so in this hour that we are living in God is calling his children he believing people that we should look at him in this hour in this period when men's hearts are failing for fear when the leaders of this word heads of states and president are confused because nobody know what will be the next hour look at what is happening in Palestine Israel today nobody knows how it is going to end and Israel is God time peace whatever happens to Israel watch out praise the Lord and I try to find and look Brothers what brought Israel into this condition is because at that point they were divided the nation was divided because the whole world knows the security of Israel there is no nation that is security minded like Israel and everybody believe their agents what they can do but they were divided they were almost about to fight one another they were determined to fight because somebody is thinking oh this one is doing this because of this this one is doing because of that and sometimes our thinking our thoughts is wrong because sometime we think about ourselves oh this did that that did that he did this because of this he didn't greet me he didn't call me he didn't do this and that sometime that is just your thought right and when you conceive a wrong thought you will deliver a wrong life because whatever you conceive you give birth to it so the prophet say you just imagine that somebody hat you or somebody doesn't like you once you imagine that way you will see everything that way and then you will put meaning to things that is not so because whatever you conceive is whatever you give birth to so then if God speaks to a heart of a man there will never be bitterness in your heart there will never be hatred when God is on the scene when God is dealing with a man he feels your heart with love it takes away suspicions it takes away bitterness and Malice may the Lord help [Music] us let me read this quote here the prophet say I've never talked like this to a group of people but in this locality here and throughout the Nations is becoming now if the devil can keep us separated he's got us he's got us shooting at one another he's got a an open Target anywhere he wants to shoot and what is the use of shooting we are shooting one another see so he can just sit back and relax when we begin to shoot at one another he sits back and he relax yeah just do it for me the prophet said let me just give you if I have found Grace in your sight through God you take my word for this Brethren if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing when a man has done you wrong and he has absolutely justly I mean he's done you wrong and you know that he's done you wrong is done you evil don't mention that you take him to prayer before God and don't take it in a way of just a selfish and say well I'm supposed to do this but but stand with your shoulder to his shoulder and stand in the presence of God our Father a way a prayer should be made in the presence of God say father here is my brother and is justly he deserves punishment because he has done me evil I don't see why he did it then listen to this then let God go to talking to you when you have been offended when somebody has done you wrong and you go to God praying he said let God go to talking to you not to the one that has offended you but let God go to talking to you if it is your wife if it is your husband if it is your church member whoever it be or the pastor or the church member or a deacon or whatever let God go talking to you because some time we pray Lord let him see that he has done me wrong let him know that he's wrong let God go to talking to you and you will see maybe what that mans has been through the devil has Twisted up somewhere and cause him to do that you will see what that man what that woman what that brother has gone through the devil might have twist him in some way to cause him to react or behave that way towards you you will see maybe he has not seen it what but you will see after you have gone to prayer are we together are we together don't be afraid to say Amen to the word of God what about somebody ask a question you are not speaking huh are we together all right the prophet said though he is absolutely wrong though he is absolutely wrong before you leave the Throne of God you will be feeling sorry for that man you'll be feeling sorry for the one that has offended you you'll be feeling sorry for the one that has done you wrong when God talk to your heart you will be sympathizing with that brother and when you get back down to where to Earth again you will go over to that brother and shake his hands did you hear that you'll be feeling sorry for the man you'll be sympath with the man and you will go and Shakeen with the one that has wronged you this is difficult but that's the word of the lord we believe the Prophet this is the prophet speaking to us this is God's Prophet instructing us and remember he told us complete obedience to the word of God what would that do to us we give you the token and Jesus told us if we greet those who greet us alone if we do good to those who just do good to us alone if we love those who just love us alone what extraordinary things are we doing the Christian the believer goes the my you'll be sympathizing with that brother and when you are you are back on Earth again you will go over to that brother and shake his hand cuz you know what he has been through you can't stand with a MTAR in the presence of God and condemn anybody I don't believe NOS sir even if he is a rank Sinner and what about a brother that has made a mistake though I say he is wrong sometimes he is accus wrong when he is not wrong but if he is wrong well if we will take him to the throne of God stand there shoulder to shoulder with our brother knowing he is a mortal and maybe his destination rest upon our attitude towards him when we come back from the Throne of God you will realize that we are everyone guilty and we all need help from one another and the best way to do is pray amen may God help us not to be forgetful hearers of God's word or not just to sympathize with God's word but that we will be hearers and doers that God will give us Grace to obey his word and I've said Jesus said we should love our enemies and we should love our neighbors and love one another and I have said if you cannot love your brother your husband your wife oh whatever say as your wife as your brother as your sister then love him or her as your neighbor because he said love your neighbor as yourself if you cannot love him as your neighbor then love it as your enemy because he said love your enemies is it funny that's the word of God love your enemies so even if your wife becomes an enemy love her as an enemy we are not asked to hate our enemies we are asked to love our enemies praise the Lord Brother Brown told us love is the strongest force he said when it is put to test it will defeat the strongest enemy this is the word of the Lord to us remember God sends a prophet and the prophet brings the mind of God Amen the message that we have received today is to bring Christ in our lives amen that they can say and look at us and say that this man this woman this boy has been with Christ amen because when you stay with Christ your life will change amen praise the name of the Lord may God help us the hour is late look at the state Israel is in today since they became a nation 75 years ago nothing like this has ever happened to them for over thousand people to be killed on their own soil even in their Wars when they fought battles fought against Nations 13 Nations five nations nothing like this ever happened to them nothing like that in a day over a thousand people killed and those that were kidnapped and those that were raped and come on all because they were fighting they were divided and in their unguided moment the enemy came in so the enemy is always looking for a time to strike that's why we are taught to watch and pray because the enemy he's not sleepy he's not sleepy and he's not joing your enemy the Bible tells us our adversary the devil is working about raring like a lion seeking whom he may devour that's right true that's right so we are not on picnic we are in a battle Watch and Pray Saints are we together we are living in evil days the homegoing is at hand there is pressure on the Land There is pressure on everyone Nations under pressure churches Under Pressure family under pressure The Young and the old everybody is under pressure it's not time to play Church no no no no no it's not time to play Church watch and pray we need one another more than ever before you need me and I need you the brother you think is so troublesome the is you need that fellow along the way you will need that one along the way you might think today I don't need this one I get this I don't you just talking you don't know when they threw away Joseph at the end they needed Joseph may the Lord help us to stick together pray for one another stand shoulder to shoulder bear with one another and pray with one another I cannot be like you you cannot be like me take me the way I am and pray for me let me pray for you let's pray for one another the way we are we are made differently the disciples were different Peter was different from Andrews though they were brothers everyone is made differently to serve different purpose in the kingdom of God so don't also try to be like anybody no no no what God has made you be that way let us be like Christ Lord help me what did you bring me on Earth to do give me Grace and strength to do all people don't understand me it's okay try to understand why they don't understand you oh yeah I prayed to God I said God help me to understand more than to be understood I pray to God if I can understand why you look down on me it's okay I can live with you if you want everybody to understand you you have problem every day because I promise you everybody will know not understand you your wife might not your husband might not no no why should everybody understand you pray that God will give you Grace to understand as somebody got it wrong yeah it's okay God help me so that my conduct and my attitude my action will not offend God amen amen because many of we get all these excuses I'm not coming to church I'm not doing this I'm not I'm ano I don't want to talk to anybody they don't want to talk to who you just worry yourself for nothing you just worrying yourself I'm not this one done this to me hey hey they don't love me just love them they don't understand me just understand them understand why they don't understand you and you'll be fine you'll be fine once you understand why they don't understand you you are okay we should put the devil where he belongs to we should not give him chance to separate us to bring confusion and begin to think about this one think about that one and sometimes our thought away from scriptures brother Bram said if anything good with come to us it must be revealed by the spirit of God and confirmed by the word of God and be made manifest by the results the fruits that's right the fruit that will come your actions and your attitude will show whether it is the right Spirit or the wrong Spirit right Hallelujah woo glory to God are you happy yeah I'm happy too and God is happy just one person that is not happy here it's just one person the devil that's right and we don't want him to be happy we want him to feel bad and get out amen may God help us what a happy people we are we should be happy let blessed be the ti that binds our hearts in Christian love don't just make a circle for yourself and separate no no no no no forget about that we are going home am and I thank God that Israel has waken up now they know that whether you belong to this you belong to that it doesn't matter we are Jews we have to fight we are Jews we are part of one another we are Jews we are believers we are messed believers we are Christians we are the elect of God that's the main thing for us [Applause] today Hallelujah and I thank God when they were calling their soldiers the reservist to come and all over the world the Jews Israeli soldiers move from all over back to Palestine they want to fight all of them they responding more than they've ever resp responded at any time because the nation is at stake and they want to fight for their loved ones they want to fight for the nation they want to fight for their children and may God give us Grace saints of God to fight the Battle of Faith pray for our children pray for our loved ones claim them those that have been kidnapped by the enemy those that have been captured by the enemy let's go to the let's go on the offensive as Believers and Warriors and pray day and night claiming again for the kingdom of God go for the rescue if we fight will win and I thank God for Israel for the at say we will win Israel will win and you see them today they are going to war and they'll be reading the scriptures they'll be quoting the Bible yes God said this about us and they are holding on to that oh God give us Grace today to know who we are and hold on to God's promises if Israel will look at the obstacles the number of people that are against them almost the whole world is standing against them but if they will look at that they will never move but they don't look at that they holding to the promise that we are Abraham's seed we are God's children the only Jewish Nation don't look at the obstacles don't look at the circumstances look at the promise and remember this there is something about what you look at brother Bram said the eye is a gateway so what you look at affects you he does something in your life what cost the four if so he look at that three what he look at why do we have a lot of adverts bballs advertising this and that and that it has something to do it affects you so there is something about what you look at in the scripture somewhere I think in Genesis 30 somewhere there you know Jacob even play a trick with the animals the cattles or the sheep and things and that and he fix something in the Gess and he said when the strong sheep come to give birth it feels them that they will be looking at the purples or purp trees whatever he has made and when they look at it they birth it they give birth to what they were looking at I don't know how it happened but the Bible says so and I just believe what the Bible says so there is something about what you look at because it's a Gateway your eye is a gateway so God tells us look unto me all ye ends of the Earth God is the same with his word so look to the the word what is the word the promises that God has given us no matter the obstacles no matter the difficulties look to me look at the promise Moses God was sending into Egypt he said who am I to go to Pharaoh I cannot go they are looking for me they will kill me God said I will be with you and you will bring the children of Israel out of Egypt keep your eyes on that promise look at the promise Moses went out in the power of that promise that God gave him why did the spies failed because they were looking at the obstacles oh we saw the Anakin we saw yes of course the Anakin were there the jebusites were there the amorites were there God already told them I am giving you De Land God knew they were there see you cannot tell God what is there what is not there God knows and they begin to look at those ones instead of looking at the promise they forgot that it is not by might nor by power but by the spirit of the Living God you are not even supposed to look at yourself am you are look he said because he said in our eyes we were like grasshoppers yeah and that is what we were in their sight so what did I say you should look at yourselves or look at the enemy I said keep your eyes on me look onto me I am the Creator I am the Almighty I am God and I change it not I am the Almighty I am the way the truth and the life I am the Alpha and the Omega I am your strength and I am your God I am your savior I am your healer I am your provider I am the o in all I am the resurrection and I am the life look unto me what are you looking at what are you looking at why are we not progressing because we are not looking in front of us the Bible said looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith it didn't say you should look at your wife or look at your husband or look at your mama or look at your papa or look at the pastor look at the n he said look unto me if you look to man you will fail what are we looking at today why are we not progressing why didn't they take the land because oh the land is f all those things were fine yes the land was F that's true the anak were there that's true the amales were there that's true the Je were there that's true and the people were of big that's true all that they say were true was it it was true but God never said they should look at those people oh yeah you are suffering with this that's true you are suffering yes that's true but the Bible alsoo I am the Lord that healed all your diseases I am the word the truth and the life listen listen Church remember Fai is not always oh jump out Faith endures Faith endures you might be having trials oh yeah Faith endures Paul was speaking to the people in the book of Hebrews said call to remembrance call to Rememberance the former days in which you you endure all this and that and that and that and that and the Bible and Jesus endured the cross and despised the shame so Faith endur us Faith gives strength Faith gives Grace my grace is sufficient for you my strength is made perfect in time of weakness our fathers our brothers that thrown to the Lions the lions eat them up in the book of Hebrew said they refuse Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection if they had been mindful of where they came out from they would have gone back but these people confess and profess we are strangers here we are not going back we are ready to die sh M andego they Our God can deliver us but if he will not compromise we are not going to to live nothing you can kill us Faith endures Lord help us oh too much of babying you want to be babied what are you talking about this is Paul here H uh uh Zachary yeah and uh PA at this mama mama want to eat suck breast say are you sick what what are you talking about how do you want to be babied God don't baby children God want us to be mature yes God want you to be mature to know where you are standing to be a soldier and fight what are we talking about out God is not in a crying crying baby no no no no no he want us to be up and be doing strong firm fight on if nobody come to church oh everybody can leave the message if I have Revelation as I have today let anybody go anywhere they want to go that's why Paul say as of me and my house will serve the Lord if nobody go I will go did you bring me into the message go call me I came alone if you want to go you can go oh we are friends we have friends we love them but hey this is life and death yes sir if a child a young man you get that revelation of who Jesus is his mother and father can kick him out and throw him out he will not move in an inch because you know whom you have believed our brothers our sisters they were true to the Lions they were fed to Lions was it because they didn't have faith no they had Faith they defy the Lions all the persecution they defy it they endure it so we will not we will not compromise you know sometime we think when we compromise we'll be free but I'm telling you that's a big Li oh maybe I do this the man they will be satisfied Israel give the land the that where they are fighting Israel gave it up for peace have there been peace they've never had peace let's give this for peace land for peace this for peace to today the land was gotten by fight Joshua went out and fought the children of Israel fought we must fight for our right that's why brother said we are not on picnic we must fight for every every in of the land every promise that God gave us we must fight for it sometime you die in battle praise the lord we have to die in battle we read about men like um Antipas different ones different of our brothers thousands were thr to the lion killed in the dark edges they were killed because they refused to compromise they refused to bow they refuse to worship idols and that caused their death Hallelujah don't look at the circumstances look at the promise because the promise endures the promise endures us the promise inspires us the promise gives strength when you know God give no wonder Caleb at the age of 85 years and old man amen they've entered the promised land for 45 years after 45 years oh thank God how we need personal revelation when they they went to spy the land and the rest of the people said we cannot take it hey Cal said let's go at once he didn't say well the people said we cannot take it so let's said no no no he said let's go at once for we are well able to take it let's go if somebody is not ready hey I'm ready be ready stand on your grounds hallelujah praise the name of the Living God oh I know Satan is not happy but I don't want him to be happy I'm not here to make him happy I'm makeing I'm here to make him mad I don't care about you Satan yes sir he thought he could retired me but he didn't succeed I went on leave I'm back yes sir prise God glory to God I'm ready to fight on I'm ready to go on no turning [Applause] back what are you looking at today calb said he came to Joshua he said brother Joshua do you remember what the prophet said about me said what he said when we went to spy the land when the rest of our Breen said they could not take the land do you remember I brought Revelation as it was in my heart I spoke to Prophet Moses when the rest were afraid when they said we could not make it you remember I told Moses we are well able to possess to overcome it oh yeah I do where did he he was reading the message and he got that quote what the prophet said about him the message became oh no wonder the prophet said Children of the light keep walking in the light watch and see more unfold that has been in the scripture or the message of Moses for years 45 years it was there but one day the light shine across it as he was reading it wo this is me it's about me and right there he went to the prophet Joshua is said Joshua do you remember that time look at this here see this quote calb son of death or what the father's name yeah I've given you this land because you did this and did that said oh he said brother Joshua list this is 45 years ago I was 40 years at that time now I am 85 years but I want you to know this my strength to fight today is at that time give me the land give me the promise give me the authority give me allow let me go and I you remember that time our brothers said the Anakin were there the Giants were there I don't care who is there God gave me the promise God said it I believe it amen hallelujah he was not looking at us he was not even looking at himself he was looking at the promise so don't be looking at yourself there is nothing there look to God look to the word because the word inspires the word anoints the word strengthens o Hallelujah glory to God look at the promise look at Jonah in the belly of the fish what did he they said I will not look at these things around me I will not look at these things around me he said these are lying vanities what the tie my leg or my hands I'm not going to look at that because when you look at that you'll be affected you'll be weakened you'll be discouraged so I'm not going to look at these things no no no I look at the promise I look at the promise Solomon said when we are in trouble and we tend to go and the temple and we pray he their prayer and he look at the promise in that condition and he was loose he was free he was delivered the Bible saying God spoke to the fish huh God spoke to the fish it's okay take him out now and the fish obey everything obeys God every Power OB obeys God every demon obey God whatever force is they obey God God spoke to the fish move out because Somebody Prayed because somebody looked to the promise the promise that can never fail promise that Solomon that backed made and God honored it because somebody hold on to that what about the promise that Jesus gave us amen what about what he has told us all the promise he given to us what are we doing with it and we want to blame God no I'm I'm trying to close because Hallelujah woo ah one time okay let me res the prophet was speaking about somebody here said now now what made calb and so sure of it when the opposition was so great it is according to what you are looking at Caleb was looking at the promise of God the other 10 were looking at the circumstances if you go to look at the circumstances or to look at what's around you you are sure to fil but we must never look at what is around you what if that man sitting there look at the opposition by his boy there a in that chair what if this nice clean looking man sitting back there in the wheelchair look at the circumstances what if the lady laying in the chair leaning back look at the circumstances what if this poor blind woman leaning on a shoulder of another thought of the circumstances the doctor has tried he failed he a man like I am you are and if you look at that then you are going to be failure to begin with but the Christian doesn't look at the circumstances he looks at the word and stands still God says so that settles it what if Abraham I look at the circumstances if the doctor examine your heart that kisss more people than anything else the doctor examined your heart and said you might drop at any time you got a mamama that's true if you look at that then you are defeated to begin with look what God Said one time when the test was on when the Covenant people had come up out of Egypt led by the Holy Spirit Moses the great leader and the spies had went over into the promised land 10 of them came back and said we cannot take it they are too great we are too small but there was two men Caleb and Joshua who had been over there and they steal the people first thing one saying this and one saying that one saying this why did you bring us out here and all kinds of things ah why why why why did you do this and why did you do that and calb seal the people before Moses and said we are well able to go over and take it because it depends on what you are looking at some of them were looking at the obstacle the great armies and the great Wars and the great giant size of people but calb was looking at the promise of God and it was the hour had come when calb had to get the people stay before he could tell them the promise of God and I think that's the very needy thing today is for the people to stand still and see what God has promised it's a day that God is fulfilling his promise these things must be they've got to come therefore we must see the Promise and stand still and what God's salvation move into it God always works according to his word hallelujah it depends on what you are looking at if you look at your afflictions you will never go any further but if you look at the promise of God you've got a right to every Redemptive blessing that God promised in his word is yours right the Christian always looks at the Unseen things every Redemptive blessing of God is unseen may God be with us my brothers and sisters stop looking around you stop looking at your afflictions like i s the text to one of our sisters in a challenge I said sister don't be looking at your enemies the people against you in the place of work in your office I said don't look at that look at the promise of God as long as your mind is on them you will never make it this one is doing this against me forget about them let them do and be tired look at the promise why did Israel fail when there was a golad they were looking at that golad the doctor said this even saw said that hey nobody can fight this man he was the one that discouraged the people I believe what he told David this man has been a man of Youth from his way he has told the people that way said we are in trouble that man that is there from his you for it's not today he started fighting so I I don't think we have a chance don't have to begin at all and everybody was afraid because they were looking at at his head the size of his head they are looking at his spear they looking at his breastplate they looking at his fingers they they all about goia they were talking about and nobody said anything about God they were just looking at the negative look at this look at that they were looking at the wrong things you continue to look at your problem Oh the doctor said this and this one and this one kill this one and this you will die if you can take your eyes turn your eyes and look to Jesus look at the promise do he SL me yet I will trust him he is my way it's my truth it's my life he's Our Redeemer he everything to us when David came and saw tried to discourage him he refused to be discouraged when sa tried to point it to golad he refused to look at him you know he said let me also look at look at this other one God did this he saved me from the bear he Sav me from The Lion he he said this one we also go the same God the same God the same yesterday today and forever the god of Abraham the god of our fathers he will do it again amen look at the promise the promises are good they are yeah and amen and God who promised them he not a man that she should say something that they will not do God will fulfill his word no matter what God will keep his promise no matter what what are you looking at today turn your eyes on Jesus take from your trouble this one did this take from your sickness all have this keep looking to him there is something about what you look at and the Bible say we should look to Jesus am you know let me close by saying this you know Peter was walking on the sea Jesus was walking and Peter said if it is you Lord let me also come Jesus said come he started working he was doing very well until he begin to look at the waters what he saw and he got scar was already there since he started walking the water has been moving up and wah wah wah wah as he was looking and going forward he didn't have problem until he turned from the word he turned from looking to Jesus and he begin to look this way I want to see what is happening on this side I want to see what is hey ah he begin to sink but thank God he cried to the Lord he didn't say let me die here let me sink it's all over he said Lord save me help me when he came back to Jesus he crossed he made it God be with us let's now look to him anywhere Brother Sam you can come God bless you stop looking at yourself look unto Jesus look

the Lord God speaking to our hearts speaking to our lives so personal remind reminding us who we are reminding us our position reminding us of how our approach with everything and you know what I'm thankful for is when we can look to the Lord God gives Grace for us to rise to what he's calling us to he don't just give us Grace for a mistake we've made but God gives sufficient Grace to we can rise above that he's the same God who breaks veils and just like he came tonight in the Simplicity of his word but God comes to break veils because sometimes there's things that we can as even the message started tonight we can begin to look at things through our own thoughts through our own veils and you know God has to break that Veil brother Bram himself when he went when there was those who were um he tells about it in the bruised serpent they were you know wanting to baptize in his name and other things and brother BR went right to him and brother Bram when he went to him he said he sat down with those Brethren and brother Bram said I showed him what I did not say he said but they wouldn't hear it and he said see the reason why because it was a spirit that was veiling them then brother brandham prayed this is what I love brother Bram comes back and tells us what happened is he went and prayed for those Brethren because he realized just sitting down and showing them what he said they had see the power of conception they had brought a conception that even though brother Bram didn't say it they had conceived their own understanding and it was a veil that's how powerful a spirit is brother ad said he went and he prayed for the Brethren he continued to pray and he said God broke that spirit and he said then they turned to him and they said when they came back a few days later what sure brother bradam you never even said those things no he showed them what he said but that Veil that spiritual Veil would not allow him to see it I'm glad that God still breaks Veils I'm glad that he aren't you I'm glad I'm glad he comes and breaks veils in our minds veils in our lives veils of things and I'm so thankful for his grace I tell you the Lord has really spoke to us tonight amen it was so good I uh when brother Timothy was was asking and saying it wasn't that we didn't agree with it we agree I was just trying to make sure I took in every word I wanted everybody to take in every word it it was good it was right down it was very good hallu amen it so good amen now now we have the wonderful privilege of taking it and living it this is where the rubber meets the road now to take it and apply it and live by it and let the word change our life that's what it's for that's why God came to speak to us tonight and I want to be like that little boy all the rest of had come and tried to win that bicycle they asked this little boy got on there he would not have been the pick to win the bicycle the guy was not a good biker yes but he rode that bike down the plank and the rest of the fellas around asked him what was your secret he said what it was is I never took my eyes off of the end I focused on the end you see how Satan wants to distract with try to get us to look this way look at this look at that look at this because soon as we get our eyes off of the Lord Jesus we fail that's the failure is getting our eyes off of him the other things are just results of that so may God help us to keep our eyes on him no matter your situation no matter the problem whatever it is even that is before you and that you're praying about Look to Him Look to Him scripture
