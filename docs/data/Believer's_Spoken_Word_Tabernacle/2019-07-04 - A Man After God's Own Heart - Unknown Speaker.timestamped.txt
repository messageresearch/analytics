[0:00] a man turns me to acts chapter 13
[0:07] when I read verses 21 through 23
[0:23] and afterward they desired a king and
[0:26] God gave it to them saw the son of sis a
[0:28] man of the tribe of Benjamin by the
[0:31] space of 40 years and when he had
[0:34] removed him he raised up unto them David
[0:36] to be their king to whom also he gave
[0:39] testimony and said I have found David
[0:42] the son of Jesse a man after my own
[0:44] heart
[0:45] which shall fulfill all of my will of
[0:48] this man's seed hath God according to
[0:50] his promise raised unto Israel a saviour
[0:53] jesus may be seated
[0:56] what I want to Minister on tonight is a
[0:58] man after God's own heart we find where
[1:04] we start there in the scriptures and
[1:06] first Samuel did that saw what it took
[1:11] place Saul was actually only in his
[1:14] second year of reign eNOS King oneness
[1:16] took place and he the Philistines had
[1:21] come and were gathering against them and
[1:24] Saul was waiting on Samuel to come to
[1:28] offer up supplications into the Lord
[1:31] offer a sacrifice before he went into
[1:33] battle against the Philistines and while
[1:37] he was waiting samuel delayed from
[1:41] coming
[1:43] and the Philistines were moving and
[1:47] gathering themselves and Saul became
[1:50] worried and so Saul decided that he
[1:56] would give the sacrifice to God himself
[1:59] and so he made the sacrifice ordered it
[2:04] to be brought to him made the sacrifice
[2:06] offered unto God and the Bible says as
[2:08] soon as he was finished that Samuel came
[2:12] and Samuel asked him what have you done
[2:15] and so Saul right away begins to say
[2:19] well you know this and that
[2:23] I the Philistines were gathered against
[2:25] me
[2:25] the people were scattering from me I was
[2:29] waiting on you and you didn't come and
[2:32] so I forced myself to give this
[2:35] sacrifice because I was afraid the
[2:38] Philistines would come and fall upon us
[2:40] before I give my supplications unto the
[2:42] Lord
[2:44] and Samuel said you've done a foolish
[2:46] thing you have disobeyed the
[2:49] commandments of God see Saul got out of
[2:53] his place it's always anointed to be
[2:57] king but Saul got out of his place and
[3:00] offered up a sacrifice as a minister
[3:04] something we ought to always be aware of
[3:08] and never get out of our place with God
[3:11] amen and so then Samuel says to him
[3:17] your king God would have that your
[3:20] kingdom continue on down through your
[3:23] sons and sons sons and so forth he said
[3:27] but now it's not going to continue
[3:28] because of what you've done because you
[3:31] couldn't keep the commandment and God
[3:33] has sought him out a person a man after
[3:36] his own heart
[3:38] and of course we know that in Acts it
[3:42] speaks of it says David was this man
[3:46] and you know we look at David we look at
[3:50] all his faults we look at his failures
[3:52] we look at his mistakes we look at his
[3:54] sin
[3:55] and we wonder how that in the book of
[3:58] Acts God could still call him a man
[4:01] after his own heart
[4:08] but we'd have to look at David's
[4:12] characteristics Paul is actually riding
[4:16] here in the book of Acts how telling you
[4:18] how God feels about David this is how
[4:21] God felt about
[4:24] here's the thing how God feels about you
[4:27] has nothing to do with how perfect you
[4:31] can be because there's none of us
[4:33] perfect how God feels about you has
[4:37] nothing to do with your mistakes your
[4:40] failures your shortcomings that doesn't
[4:44] affect how God feels about you
[4:48] as the natural father
[4:52] my sons may make mistakes my daughters
[4:56] but I doesn't change my love for them it
[5:00] doesn't remove them from being my sons
[5:02] and daughters and that's the way it is
[5:04] with God with his sons and daughters it
[5:06] doesn't remove you from being his son or
[5:09] his daughter it doesn't there's nothing
[5:12] you can do to make God love you more
[5:15] than he already does and there's nothing
[5:20] you can do to make him love you less
[5:24] God loves you unconditionally
[5:29] but how could God still call him a man
[5:32] after his own heart we find this in the
[5:36] verse that we read there where it says
[5:41] he was a man after his heart that he's
[5:44] going to do everything I want him to do
[5:47] David would do all that the Lord wanted
[5:50] anything God asked of him David did
[5:55] unlike Saul
[5:57] so didn't always do everything the Lord
[6:01] asked of me
[6:08] David was far from perfect in this
[6:12] scriptures David opens up his life for
[6:15] examination by all
[6:18] he doesn't hold back he doesn't hold
[6:21] back from you
[6:24] his is crying unto the Lord he doesn't
[6:28] hold back from you his repentance unto
[6:30] God
[6:32] he David's heart was pointed toward God
[6:36] he had a deep desire in his heart for
[6:39] God he loved the Lord with all his heart
[6:50] one of the characteristics of David was
[6:52] his absolute faith this is we can see
[6:58] this when Goliath the great Philistine
[7:02] came against Israel and David just a
[7:06] young lad goes up says who is this
[7:11] uncircumcised Philistine to defy the
[7:13] armies of the Living God
[7:16] and you know Goliath was saying let's
[7:21] one of your champions come out and fight
[7:23] me and whoever wins were then that'll be
[7:26] the Conqueror
[7:27] they said I'll go fight him you imagine
[7:32] how ridiculous that looked to all the
[7:35] men around him the men were afraid to go
[7:38] out and fight this this gigantic man
[7:42] but David said I'll go do it
[7:45] David had faith and he says just as God
[7:50] delivered me out of the pall of the bear
[7:53] and the fall of the line he'll deliver
[7:55] me out of the hands of this Philistine
[7:58] he had absolute faith David knew that
[8:02] God was in control of his life when we
[8:07] can get to a place where we realize that
[8:09] God is in control of our life we'll quit
[8:13] worrying and fretting over things will
[8:17] cook worrying and fretting over our
[8:19] children will quit worrying and fretting
[8:21] over our own lines why because we know
[8:24] that we are in God's hand he's got it
[8:28] all in control if God can't do it we
[8:32] sure can if God can't accomplish it
[8:37] you're not going to be able to were
[8:40] dependent on him and David was utterly
[8:43] dependent upon the Lord
[8:47] here he he had no military experience he
[8:51] had no fighting experience but he had
[8:55] experience with one thing and that was
[8:57] trusting God and he had this little
[9:00] sling and had these stones you know I
[9:07] believe that David knew that one of them
[9:11] stones was ordained to strike that giant
[9:14] in just the right place because I don't
[9:21] care how good you are with the sling or
[9:23] how good even you are with the rifle you
[9:26] know they didn't have rifles back then
[9:28] but David to be able to hit that giant
[9:32] exactly where he needed to hit him with
[9:35] the exact amount of force that needed to
[9:38] in order to actually kill that giant
[9:43] that was God in wouldn't no matter if
[9:46] David would have turned and throwed the
[9:48] stone the other way it has still hit the
[9:50] giant took him down
[9:51] [Applause]
[10:00] David's faith pleased God he was pleased
[10:05] with David's faith and he reward David
[10:08] for his faithfulness
[10:10] David was faithful to the Lord
[10:14] another one of David's character it says
[10:16] he'd loved God's Word he loved the Word
[10:22] of God
[10:27] there's 150 songs over half of them
[10:32] somewhere between 73 and then they say
[10:34] that in the New Testament it gives him
[10:37] credit for two more so about 75 of the
[10:39] songs were wrote by David
[10:42] he loved absolutely loved the Word of
[10:45] God
[10:48] and he repeatedly mentions how that he'd
[10:51] love God's Word Psalms 119 47 48 David
[10:57] writes I will delight myself in thy
[10:59] commandments which I have loved my hands
[11:03] also will I lift up into thy
[11:05] commandments which I have loved and I
[11:08] will meditate in thy statute
[11:12] you can see his complete adoration for
[11:16] God's Word he simply adored
[11:21] also the scripture says here that we
[11:25] read david meditated on the word
[11:30] he meditated on God statue he thought on
[11:35] gods were
[11:37] you know it's not just important to read
[11:40] God's Word but God likes us to meditate
[11:44] on his word to think about his word I
[11:51] when I'm studying for a message why
[11:55] after I've put notes together in things
[11:58] I'll get off to myself and I'll just sit
[12:00] there and I tell my wife I'm studying in
[12:02] my mind but what I'm doing is I'm
[12:04] meditating on everything I've studied
[12:06] I'm meditating on the Word of God for
[12:09] God to direct me to put in me what's not
[12:13] in the notes lest are they that keep his
[12:21] testimonies and day.this seek him of the
[12:23] whole heart David says
[12:27] another one of Davis characteristics was
[12:29] he was grateful he was always thankful
[12:34] unto the Lord
[12:36] he had a heart of gratitude toward God I
[12:42] I don't know if you've ever had any
[12:45] experience with people who have no
[12:46] gratitude at all
[12:50] but it doesn't matter what you do for
[12:53] them they're never grateful
[12:57] I've had that experience firsthand but
[13:04] David was grateful for all that God did
[13:07] for him and David through all the
[13:10] seasons of his life
[13:12] David never failed to give thanks to God
[13:16] for everything that he had it didn't
[13:20] matter if he was up or he was down look
[13:23] he was giving God praise he was giving
[13:26] God thanks
[13:30] they was life is marked by peace
[13:35] prosperity also marked by fear and
[13:38] despair
[13:40] but he always gave God things
[13:45] he says in Psalms 1 of 104 enter into
[13:52] his gates with Thanksgiving and into his
[13:55] courts with praise be thankful unto Him
[13:58] and bless his name
[14:02] we ought to follow David's lien be able
[14:05] to give praise unto God give praise to
[14:08] him in the song give praise to him with
[14:11] our hands
[14:12] amen give praise to him with the shout a
[14:16] man give praise to God with the dance a
[14:20] man we ought to be able to give praise
[14:23] with job with every fiber of our being
[14:27] hallelujah
[14:33] the other characteristics of David was
[14:35] he was truly repentant whenever his sin
[14:42] was found out David was truly repentant
[14:46] David never offered an excuse for why he
[14:51] did what he did
[14:54] David never blamed it on anybody else
[14:59] he always took the blame it didn't even
[15:02] matter if the blame was shared David
[15:05] still just took it himself
[15:08] in the case of him and Bathsheba brother
[15:11] branham says in one place fast she even
[15:13] knew that the king walked up on the roof
[15:15] that time of the evening so did she have
[15:21] some blame in this yes but David never
[15:24] even mentions it David takes the blame
[15:29] in himself he said I have sinned so
[15:34] that's one of David's great things about
[15:36] David David was willing to admit his
[15:40] transgressions he was willing to admit
[15:42] his sin
[15:46] even when saul was faced with by Samuel
[15:51] with what he'd done and that was wrong
[15:54] Saul still would not admit that he'd
[15:57] done something wrong and he always had
[16:02] an excuse and Saul didn't repent
[16:08] the only thing saw felt sorry for was
[16:10] the fact that Samuel said God's taken
[16:13] the kingdom from you
[16:17] but look at look at David you know we
[16:20] read by that in it when you read in
[16:22] First Samuel chapter 13 you find out
[16:25] that when Saul did what we were talking
[16:28] about earlier offered this sacrificing
[16:30] that he was only in the second year of
[16:32] his reign
[16:34] and God said I have sought me out a man
[16:38] after my own heart then we find a few
[16:41] chapters a little bit later on is where
[16:43] Saul was supposed to to go and to kill
[16:46] your Melek Ines and he refused to do it
[16:50] he didn't do all that God had asked him
[16:53] he didn't actually utterly refused but
[16:54] he didn't do all God told him to do
[16:59] and whenever Samuel confronted him Saul
[17:05] always had an excuse
[17:08] well Samuel you know you didn't come and
[17:11] I was waiting on you and the Philistines
[17:13] are gonna be upon me and I hadn't had a
[17:14] sacrifice and and so I forced myself
[17:19] and then when
[17:23] Sall is told by Samuel that God has
[17:27] taken the kingdom from you he's giving
[17:29] it unto your neighbor a man that's
[17:31] better than yourself then Samuel turned
[17:35] to go and saw reached out and grabbed
[17:37] his robe and rent his role and and
[17:40] Samuel looks and says this day as he
[17:43] rent the kingdom from your hands see
[17:45] that was the only thing Saul was sorry
[17:46] about
[17:50] now somewhere along the way Saul had to
[17:53] repent he had to get right
[17:56] but that was not ever his first reaction
[18:02] we ought to think about that don't don't
[18:07] try to give excuse for when we've done
[18:10] something that we shouldn't have done
[18:12] see okay yeah I did it
[18:20] but it's not just enough to emit your
[18:23] skin that's only half of the equation
[18:27] you've got to repent of it
[18:33] David had a repented heart
[18:38] Psalms 51
[18:55] Psalms 51 says this is David who is
[19:01] writing this Psalm after Nathan had come
[19:04] to him and after he had been with
[19:06] Bathsheba and his sin was before him
[19:10] and he says have mercy upon me O God
[19:13] according to thy loving-kindness
[19:15] according unto the multitude of thy
[19:18] tender mercies blot out my
[19:20] transgressions wash me thoroughly from
[19:23] mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin
[19:26] Brian ology my transgressions and my sin
[19:29] is ever before we
[19:31] verse 7 purge me with hyssop
[19:35] and I shall be clean wash me and I shall
[19:37] be whiter than snow
[19:40] make me to hear joy and gladness that
[19:43] the bones which thou has broken may
[19:45] rejoice hide thy face from my sin
[19:48] blot out all mine iniquities creating me
[19:51] a clean heart O God renew a right spirit
[19:53] within me cast me not away from that
[19:56] presence and take not thy Holy Spirit
[19:58] from me restore unto me the joy of thy
[20:02] salvation and uphold me with thy free
[20:05] spirit then will I teach transgressors
[20:08] thy ways and sinners shall be converted
[20:10] unto thee deliver me from
[20:13] blood-guiltiness O God thou God of my
[20:17] salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud
[20:20] of thy righteousness o Lord open down my
[20:24] lips and my mouth shall shew forth thy
[20:26] praise for thou desirest not sacrifice
[20:29] else I would give it now light is not in
[20:33] burnt offering the sacrifices of God are
[20:36] a broken spirit and a broken and
[20:38] contrite heart O God that will not
[20:42] despise
[20:45] David had a soul that could be touched
[20:47] by the truth he was unafraid to admit we
[20:52] had done wrong
[20:54] and we can see here the tenderness of
[20:56] his spirit
[20:59] David had a tender heart toward the Lord
[21:05] to see another quality of David we'll go
[21:08] back to what I was saying earlier Saul
[21:11] was only in the second year of his reign
[21:13] when he offered this sacrifice and then
[21:17] we find the book of accident says he
[21:19] reigned 40 year
[21:22] so that was 38 more years from the time
[21:25] that that God spoke through Samuel and
[21:28] said I've sought me out a man after my
[21:30] own heart
[21:30] 38 years later before God ever placed
[21:35] David in that position
[21:39] david was anointed
[21:41] a few chapters later on David was
[21:46] anointed but still was many years passed
[21:48] and we could see David's respect for the
[21:52] office that saw hell
[21:56] David many times had opportunity to slay
[21:59] Saul and Saul had definitely become the
[22:04] enemy of David because he counted David
[22:07] his enemy Saul feared David because he
[22:12] saw the Blessed hand of Almighty God
[22:16] rested upon him
[22:22] David even when Saul was delivered into
[22:27] his hands
[22:29] they even felt bad that he even cuts all
[22:31] skirt
[22:36] but he done that to show Saul you were
[22:39] in my hand
[22:40] and I didn't take your life I am NOT
[22:43] your enemy
[22:45] didn't change souls how was it gon hit
[22:48] though
[22:51] want a character what character David
[23:03] when Nathan came to David and told David
[23:07] of what I remember he tells him a little
[23:10] parable
[23:11] and David from that says that man shall
[23:19] restore
[23:22] back what he's taken and David actually
[23:27] ordered his death David in doing so was
[23:32] actually ordering his own death you
[23:33] realized what David done David committed
[23:37] adultery David committed murder
[23:42] according to the law David should have
[23:45] been stoned
[23:52] but God looked on David's heart and he
[23:56] saw the desire of David's heart was a
[23:59] desire for God
[24:02] and God extended grace to David
[24:06] remember when David said I've sinned and
[24:10] Nathan said God's not going to kill you
[24:14] God has removed your sin David said hide
[24:18] my sin from your faith so God
[24:25] brother branham said grace is solver
[24:29] it's game by a sovereign one
[24:32] and he says grace doesn't have to ask
[24:34] permission for what it does
[24:38] I'm thankful for that when God extended
[24:43] his grace to me he didn't have to come
[24:46] down and ask a bunch of church members
[24:49] is that okay because there might have
[24:57] been some back in my life that wouldn't
[24:58] have said yeah that's okay
[25:02] I know you might find this hard to
[25:05] believe but I wasn't liked by everybody
[25:13] but God didn't ask anybody
[25:20] God just God didn't ask anybody when he
[25:22] touched your life God just did it and he
[25:30] didn't do it because you merited it he
[25:35] didn't do it because he looked down and
[25:36] said Maya this is just a wonderful
[25:38] person
[25:41] why they're so perfect
[25:45] my goodness I don't know how I've
[25:46] overlooked them up to this point no it's
[25:54] on Christ's merits that God extends
[25:58] grace to us but here in the Old
[26:01] Testament God extended grace to David
[26:07] David didn't get by
[26:12] even though God said he was a man after
[26:14] my own heart David didn't get by
[26:18] David still had to come and face the
[26:22] consequences of the things he done he
[26:25] says he'll not kill you David but the
[26:29] child will not live
[26:35] David cried before the Lord would not
[26:39] eat would not get up stayed laying down
[26:42] crying for the for the life of that
[26:44] child
[26:47] God had already spoken
[26:52] after they come and told David the child
[26:55] is dead
[26:56] David got up washed himself off then
[27:02] went down to eat remember they asked him
[27:04] a question said why he says before maybe
[27:08] perhaps God might have moved on behalf
[27:11] of the child he said but now he's gone
[27:14] on to be with God there's no there's no
[27:18] need for me now to the beg gonna ask God
[27:24] sovereign grace brother Bentham said
[27:28] that was proved that the cross were the
[27:31] vilest thief he deserved to die
[27:34] God had never come across his mind he
[27:38] had never thought nothing of it but
[27:40] there on the cross through those
[27:43] bloodied lips in between the groans came
[27:46] a sound Lord be merciful to me remember
[27:51] me when you come into your kingdom
[27:55] it showed that he believed there were
[28:02] those around that were mocking him even
[28:05] the other thief began to mock him and
[28:07] said if you're truly that Christ and
[28:10] save yourself and save us too
[28:13] which the other thief rebuked him for he
[28:19] said remember me when you come into your
[28:20] kingdom showing he believed who Jesus
[28:24] was that he was indeed a team that he
[28:31] was indeed king of Israel
[28:33] he said remember me and he knew that it
[28:35] wasn't this natural kingdom
[28:39] he said remember me when you come into
[28:42] your kingdom and God showed grace to
[28:49] that thief couldn't help himself
[28:53] no more than Adam could help himself no
[28:56] more than Eve could help herself no more
[28:59] than you or I could help ourselves no
[29:04] more than you and I could reach down and
[29:06] pull ourselves up through the great
[29:07] Milky Way by our own bootstraps
[29:10] but grace grace can do something about
[29:15] it we can't do for ourselves but grace
[29:19] can and here's the thing it does
[29:24] hallelujah
[29:27] this day thou shalt be with me in
[29:30] paradise
[29:31] amen
[29:35] twice God mentions that David is a man
[29:40] after his own heart he was one of God's
[29:46] favor
[29:49] even though he's sinned even though he
[29:52] comes short but God looked on his heart
[29:57] now there's a thing today that I've
[30:01] heard a lot of people say God don't look
[30:04] on the outside he looks at the heart
[30:07] and that's true however they're using it
[30:12] for an excuse because their outside
[30:14] isn't matching the word but if the
[30:19] insides right the outside is going to
[30:21] come into subjection to what's on the
[30:23] inside the outside will match the word
[30:27] amen the the the what the outside
[30:32] displays what's in the heart and David's
[30:37] heart was after God and David displayed
[30:39] this
[30:41] in in his writings
[30:45] it is praised in his songs in his music
[30:50] David worshiped God he loved the word he
[30:55] had great faith
[30:58] and he had a repentant heart
[31:06] David was a poet a musician a prophet
[31:10] Israel's greatest King one of the
[31:13] greatest military leaders ever but it
[31:20] was his character and the fact that he
[31:23] had a repentant heart was way more
[31:24] important than any of those other thing
[31:31] david says in the songs the Lord
[31:35] confides in those that fear him to think
[31:40] that God would confide in a human being
[31:45] that's amazing
[31:49] but God chose to share his heart with me
[31:54] he chose to confide in him David said
[31:58] the secret of the Lord is with them that
[32:01] fear
[32:04] God confided in David it shows and
[32:07] speaks something of David's character
[32:13] David was committed to following God
[32:17] he demonstrated his faith david's faith
[32:21] was tested on a grand scale and there
[32:26] was times he fell
[32:30] but after his sin he always sought
[32:33] forgiveness
[32:34] you saw it and receive God's forgiveness
[32:40] when we think of David's legacy
[32:47] there are those that that may be
[32:52] critical could be
[32:56] but you should remember how Israel
[33:00] thought of date
[33:04] we're familiar with the expressions the
[33:06] City of David the seed of David the
[33:12] throne of David the house of David and
[33:18] you know something that to me was a
[33:21] great commentary of David was when the
[33:27] Lord Jesus identified himself as being
[33:31] the son of me
[33:37] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[33:52] I'm sure that all of us would like to be
[33:54] a person after God's own heart we would
[33:58] like for God to think of us in that that
[34:00] way
[34:06] when these are the characteristics you
[34:08] need absolutely
[34:11] trust God believe him no matter what the
[34:15] circumstances look like no matter how
[34:18] impossible they may see
[34:21] you know there are times when things
[34:24] seem to be headed a certain direction
[34:26] the opposite direction of the way that
[34:29] you want them to be
[34:31] the opposite of good but you've got to
[34:34] remember that the Bible says all things
[34:37] work together for the good of them that
[34:40] love the Lord that are called according
[34:42] to his purpose
[34:45] all things not just some things but all
[34:51] things even the things that look like
[34:53] they're not going to be for your good
[34:55] work for your good
[35:03] love the Lord and love his word with all
[35:07] your heart want to keep this work
[35:14] want to read his word want to be
[35:18] intimate with God
[35:23] be ever thankful
[35:26] you God
[35:29] giving him praise always even when we
[35:33] don't feel like there's times maybe
[35:37] you're going through things during the
[35:40] week and you come into the service and
[35:44] maybe humanly you really don't feel like
[35:47] raising your hand
[35:49] you really don't feel like clapping your
[35:51] hand you really don't feel like getting
[35:53] into the service sometimes they I don't
[35:56] really feel like sing
[35:59] maybe you've never felt that but I can
[36:05] tell you I've witnessed that feeling
[36:08] myself and I've witnessed others having
[36:14] that feeling I was a song leader before
[36:18] I started preaching all the poor song
[36:26] leaders remember one time song leader
[36:31] down a Dixon you know somebody told him
[36:33] after service said that was a wonderful
[36:35] special you son he said it wasn't meant
[36:39] to be his special have a repented heart
[36:50] David said the sacrifices of God are a
[36:53] broken spirit a broken and contrite
[36:55] heart O God thou will not despise
[36:59] your contract means means showing sorrow
[37:03] and remorse percent
[37:13] showing sorrow and remorse now there's a
[37:16] lot of people that are getting a
[37:18] situation and they'll be sorry they got
[37:20] in the situation
[37:24] but they don't have any remorse for what
[37:26] they did to get him in that situation
[37:30] I have spent times going to court with
[37:34] different individuals that's had to go
[37:37] and and some of them were guilty and I
[37:41] still went with them
[37:43] asking God to have mercy
[37:46] but I've watched time after time
[37:49] individuals get up
[37:52] and it's never their fault
[37:57] they robbed the store but it wasn't
[38:00] their fault
[38:05] one young men robbed a chicken place and
[38:11] the reason they caught him and knew he
[38:14] was the one was because she still had
[38:16] the crowbar with
[38:18] but it wasn't his fault
[38:24] that's that's the way this generation is
[38:27] today nothing's ever their fault it's
[38:30] always somebody else's they never take
[38:32] responsibility for their own actions
[38:35] that's the world today
[38:39] but David always took responsibility for
[38:43] his action
[38:51] yes he begged for mercy but he still
[38:55] took responsibility for his own action
[38:59] you never hear David when there was
[39:01] trouble that faced his family when the
[39:06] you know the God said the swords never
[39:09] going to depart from your family
[39:12] David had problems he had his own son
[39:14] stand up against him
[39:15] try to take the kingdom from me one of
[39:18] his sons raped one of the sister
[39:23] Davida there was many problems but you
[39:25] never hear david saying why God why
[39:30] why me
[39:33] I've heard people say that YNAB happen
[39:36] to me like it'd have been better if it
[39:38] happened to somebody else
[39:45] why'd it have to happen this way
[39:48] why am I going through this
[39:52] I've heard people say doesn't God love
[39:54] me
[39:58] yes God loves you that's why he's
[40:00] allowing you to go through those tests
[40:02] those times those trials those
[40:05] situations because he want look we go
[40:09] through situations that actually brings
[40:12] us to trusting God
[40:19] we go through things that increases our
[40:22] faith
[40:28] we face sicknesses sometime and it
[40:32] requires faith on our part
[40:36] to think about this is gonna require
[40:38] faith to go in the rapture
[40:45] if we can't have faith for the little
[40:47] things how we're going to have faith to
[40:48] go on the rapture to have faith to where
[40:59] when the doctors have gave up
[41:03] but you've still got faith in confidence
[41:06] of God to go before God and ask him to
[41:08] do something about it
[41:10] [Applause]
[41:15] not well the doctors have give them up I
[41:20] guess we better be finding them
[41:22] something to wear at their funeral
[41:27] no bud go before God and say I don't
[41:29] care what the doctor but God I know
[41:35] you're able that's the thing and we you
[41:41] know we always want to seek for God's
[41:43] will in everything
[41:46] I've had people come up to me prayed for
[41:49] that they wouldn't have to go through a
[41:51] certain surgery I said but what if it's
[41:54] God's will for you to go through that
[41:55] surgery
[41:57] what if through that that God's gonna
[42:01] work something in your life I know he's
[42:06] a God of miracles I know that God come
[42:08] before my miracle and a person wouldn't
[42:10] have to go through surgery I have
[42:12] witnessed we've got doing that very
[42:14] thing but there are times when God has
[42:18] you go through it
[42:23] for your own benefit I've had people
[42:27] come and ask me that they wouldn't have
[42:29] to go through surgery because they were
[42:31] afraid of anesthesia I've never
[42:33] understood that
[42:36] I've never been afraid of anesthesia
[42:38] whenever I went in for surgery I'm like
[42:41] hurry up
[42:43] put me out I wouldn't be surgeon one
[42:48] time and a young fella came in there he
[42:51] was just learning you know and he said
[42:53] they're not gonna put you to sleep and I
[42:54] said what but I got in with the chief
[42:59] anesthesiologist I said you are putting
[43:01] me to sleep right because I don't want
[43:04] to be awakened during this
[43:09] that's some good sleep you never you
[43:12] don't even dream there's some people
[43:17] that are afraid of it well what if I
[43:20] don't wake up well I guess you'll be in
[43:22] glory
[43:24] [Applause]
[43:31] what's the fear don't fear death
[43:40] my mom don't fear death for herself she
[43:43] fears it from here boy sometime
[43:46] if it was up to her she wouldn't want us
[43:49] to go on any of these mission trips
[43:51] but I'm not afraid to go because if I
[43:57] feel let have got to go I know God's
[43:59] gonna take care of me if it comes my
[44:00] time to go wouldn't matter if I was here
[44:02] in the United States I'm gonna go when
[44:08] it comes your time to go you're going
[44:09] nothing's gonna stop that
[44:17] and if it's not your time to go I heard
[44:20] one time just forgive me I'm not saying
[44:23] this to be funny but I'm saying this to
[44:25] make a point I heard one time where a
[44:26] person said you know they were on a
[44:28] plane and they said the Ellen City you
[44:32] can't go until it's your time to go and
[44:33] he said what happens if it's the pilot
[44:35] it's time to go and you know I read a
[44:38] story true story about a woman who was
[44:45] on a plane and the plane was going over
[44:48] South America and the plane utterly
[44:54] disintegrates plane just came apart and
[44:57] she was strapped into her seat
[45:00] and the plane became apart everybody
[45:03] else on the plane died somehow her seat
[45:06] fell got caught in a tree and she lived
[45:11] she was out in the jungle she was out in
[45:14] a very dangerous place but the only
[45:17] thing she think of was follow the river
[45:20] I've instantly come to something and she
[45:22] followed it till she come to a community
[45:24] and then she was saved so if it ain't
[45:28] your time to go not even a plane crash
[45:30] can take you when I read that story I
[45:34] said well it definitely wasn't her time
[45:39] because all the all the the ingredients
[45:44] to dyes were there for her but it wasn't
[45:49] her time so there's nothing can take you
[45:52] before your time you know brother Jack
[45:55] Cole there were those that said after he
[45:58] died they said he got out of God's will
[46:00] and that's why God had to take him and
[46:03] the prophet of God stuck up for him he
[46:05] says it's not true he said God doesn't
[46:08] take anybody until they've served the
[46:09] purpose he put him here for and he said
[46:12] when brother Jack cold serve God's
[46:14] purpose then God took him
[46:17] but you know there were great critics of
[46:19] him because of the way he died of the
[46:22] disease he died of you know and here he
[46:24] was supposed to be a faith healer
[46:28] you got to go some way
[46:38] broken and contrite heart
[46:42] you know
[46:45] I've had the experience in my life
[46:49] no happened to repent for God
[46:56] and asking God begging God had God
[46:59] forgive me
[47:00] I'm sorry I never meant to do
[47:08] forgive me for making excuses God
[47:12] sometimes we'll do something we'll make
[47:14] an excuse for why we're going to do it
[47:18] like that'll make it okay God forgive me
[47:28] truly sorrow and remorse for sin I want
[47:32] to be a person after God's own heart
[47:37] when I come down to the end I want God
[47:41] to say well done my good and faithful
[47:42] servant you've been faithful in a few
[47:46] things I'll make you ruler over many
[47:53] I only have a few things but I want to
[47:55] be faith
[47:58] faithful to the war
[48:01] I want God to look down on me and smile
[48:13] I'm sure he did
[48:19] I know I can't live without the mercy
[48:21] and grace of God
[48:26] I want

[48:31] lives we want God's blessing we want

[49:24] when I go on the mission field there she
[49:27] is left back at home
