the Lord and be able to fellowship around the word and Holy Spirit I want to remind you brother bill will mention this announcement twice but this Lord willing this coming Sunday at brother Richard and sister Maria's after service and after you've had a chance to get something to eat then you're more welcome to go on over there for some fellowship and activities that they would have for a little bit on Sunday afternoon also I want to say it's good to see sister so god bless your sister so good and we want to continue to remember the saints of God and all in prayer there with the hurricane Florence and you know they said just yesterday I had was reading it last night before I went to bed and they said that it had weakened during the day but then it picked back up in the evening and so where it stands right now you know they've said that a lot of the things with the coast and where they're looking at everything that it's gonna hit in land and they've said that supposedly I don't even remember Hurricane Hazel maybe I just you know it was only nine years old at the time when that would have hit but this is supposed to be as hard as what Hurricane Hazel was but you know remember God has moved time and time again remember last when we said here on Tuesday night at prayer meeting last year and I don't remember the first it was the first hurricane that passed through last year where that they did not even realize or they did not know the meteorologist said we don't know how it happened but this has weakened this hurricane and that was last year God still the same God and I I think that maybe we just continue to pray in our hearts God that he would be gracious and merciful amen to - to all of the of the people that are there and we certainly need His mercy don't we we sure do I want to say just such a is a real real privilege to have brother Stephen in Bali here with us from Uganda and really brother Stephen is just just a real friend and brother and I just so appreciate every time that we've we've had together I appreciate the ministering of the word and we I believe we're in for a good treat tonight I really believe that amen and so we just want to pull on the gift of God and how many believes that God already knew what you would have need of and what you had on your heart and he's already orchestrated this service to where you and I are looking and saying Lord I have this need and instead of saying Lord I'm recognizing you've already met my need he has provided for us and he will manifest himself once again tonight as Jehovah Jireh our needs give him an opportunity to manifest himself amen you're loving tonight Amen we want to welcome brother Stephen to Bali and just ask him just to obey the Lord and just to amen just to speak what the Lord has put on his heart and and to share some testimonies and know that he has so if we could let's just sing the song Amazing Grace amen Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that's it a wretch like me [Music] boy was [Music] now [Music] but now I see could we sing verse three through many dangers toils and snares through [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] when we [Music] Hey [Music] let's give the Lord to handle price tonight praise the Lord amen god is good and I trust the Lord is gracious I want to appreciate brother Samuel for letting me back over 10 years yeah but the Lord is gracious oh the same Amen you know when you come to a moment like this you really do not know where to begin from because you know you're stepping into eternity you know the word in itself is a ring and you see with the Eternity you don't have where to start from and where to end so stepping game is just you know very challenging but I trust that your prayers we helped me through tonight so I want to bring greetings from the church back at home and my family they pass their greetings to you and I trust they've been praying for this service I know that there are some still that awake and committing us to the Lord in prayer you know of what areas of my privilege I came to this message to know what it is in the NIT 78 and so I've traveled almost as long as my brother Samuels ages it's been a long journey full of ups and downs but the Lord has been gracious that he has helped us to this point you know I remember when I was just a young Pentecostal boy and going from door to door trying to witness about the love of Christ and one day I just got to this house had some people sing and oh I wanted to go and be part of the blessing and they were about 14 15 if I can remember you know and so I entering I had my big Bible you know they said oh you woke up I said thank you sis can you share with us God's Word I said fine so I turned to Samuel and I started speaking about a lie a prophet with a dimming sight so I fired away and at the end of it all another young man told me that was wonderful I say thank you he says but under what were you baptized [Laughter] so we began from there and you and I was challenged to what my faith was and what I believed to be you know the message that I was carrying around and you know so finally we kind of came and I tried to defend my Trinity and I just finally couldn't defend my train team you know and I saw I said unto you the people that were waiting to go in 1977 they said no we never wanted to go in 1877 I asked then what was it all about they told me to take this book and read it I was given the seventh Church edge book I read it I tell you every Junction was answered by Scripture amen and you know I had read my Bible from cover to cover so you know I had a foundation upon which to judge what I was reading and I tell you that it was a blessing amen I took the seals read the book and I can't stand in the transformation that it is shed into my life so I was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you know and so I thought hopefully maybe I wouldn't and before the Lord comes but 1978 went and the Lord added come 1979 he went the Lord added come so I said well if I'm going to be a very good minister I need to get into family life you know so 1980 I married and the Lord has given me for beautiful girls amen and I have four grandchildren and just the end of this year I'm expecting another and I have five grandchildren so the Lord has been so gracious to me but you know along the journey this is what I want best my subject tonight you know I kept thinking well we do not have more time to go and so you know I thought well I've married for the sake of it but maybe I never have kids and the kids skip maybe they were never good school they went maybe they would never go to college they went so you know and finally here we are but you know I was challenged after about eight years and I just decided to say well you know the Lord be gracious to me I caught into some kind of a Junction and I was really praying and the brother who led me to the message told me what God had spoken to him about me so you know but I really did not believe that how to make a good pasta because you see I always was out there witnessing you know even when I came to the message I was out there trying to establish little groups you know and so finally you know God as a way of doing things we've got some of those turbulent moments that comes sometimes in Africa and in July 1985 was one of those turbulent times there was the change of government violently and then we were caught in the crossfire so we were threatened one night and I did not want my wife to keep staying where I was because it's looked like it was dangerous I sent her to stay with my parents and about a week after that I wanted to go and check on how they were doing so I asked a brother to come and keep my house the brother will accepted and it was a young man still staying with his parents he would spend the day there and then the night you to come back to keep the house and you know when those turbulent times come they put some kind of what we call a curfew so this date rained so much that this young man was bitten by the curfew how as he could not come to the house and the following day when he came back there was nothing in the house so I believed that now God has actually come to a point if I can't move he's moving so 1986 I started pastoring I mean I founded a little church where I am and I started settling down as a pastor so for 40 years the Lord you know has given me grace to work with growing churches and I love so much to go out and help organize you know meetings you know teaching meetings with the some of the pastors so that we can look at some of the things that we hold so dear in this message and been doing that for quite a number of years and I've seen the blessing of God come with it you need to have had my highs and milos you know as a minister brother Samuel knows that you wake up one morning when you're high and you just want to preach and pump out everything and another time you wake up and you you have nothing to say those moments have come to me I don't about your brother Sam and I just get on the phone in that morning I said brother can you take the service tonight you know so you know those kind of moments come but we thank God you know as a minister you go through your years of criticism and different things but yet still at the same time deep down on the side you feel something that keeps saying God you know and so you know I'm so billion to the voice on the inside they men you know that's where the source of my joy is and it's what keeps me going along this journey you know something happened in our country just last year a brother you know I do radio programs we have three programs a week on radio and one of those programs we run brother branham's voice for an hour and then we come party means behind that but this young man you know who is the voice of brother Branham in the country because he he translates him you know and he's the one who is translating the books he has got a very serious condition of sugar diabetes and high blood pressure so one time he got into this crisis and he was rent hospital it was in such a bad situation and when he got in hospital was in a coma then that went on for a few days but I went and prayed with him and the rest of the brothers will believe that the Lord will move in a special way and you know for him he said Lord bringing me out of here so that I may continue to serve you so you know this young man had a Pentecostal friend a pastor so when he came down out of hospital he ended up you know going out there to testify I mean - he was invited to this place and so he goes out there and he shares the truths that we hold so dear in this message and this man here believed and it was very astounding you know and he had such a big group of people but then he says hey I will also testify he goes to the next posture and the next posture takes him to the next posture so it became a very big thing and brother Fred from a deathbed has been able to baptize hundreds of Pentecost was in one day you know and the way things were happening I was scared of getting involved because it was very mind blowing you know I stayed on the sides and I was watching I said Lord what is this that is happening but I realized that it was just a change of attitude yeah you see you know the world is open for us and they look to us as witnesses they look towards us to sow the seed but sometimes we hold on the seed and we don't saw it you see with good grounds that are over soul and that's the church so we keep saturating among ourselves all the time which is not bad but you're not sometimes the food is of a song and you know there are people out there that are crying for what we have you see so this young man felt so overwhelmed and so you know the world could not believe what is happening so we've got our friend brother Tim God from Cloverdale he was coming through going to FeO peer and so this brother says brother Tim when you come here you are going to speak to the new believers and that was the first time I got into the saint of it he couldn't believe because we could fit in the church you know the world yet was filled and the cars were bringing in people we had about 2500 gathered that day so you know and you know it pushed me at the center of it because this brother was you know we kind of come together and we decided on a strategy because this was an unending thing I said brother now what we need to do is to feed the leaders that the leaders can feed the ship so when he had the group that was closest to him he organized the classes whenever Friday and they would be in church the word afraid and the leaders and so there were another group that was in my area so we also did the same every first day and so while I was there then I get this call from a man he was a Baptist Theological and he says I've heard you speak on radio for quite a number of years now I said yes and he said that by the way I'm in teaching in a certain place and when I knew you were coming I came to that place and he says I heard you teach about a year ago but you see we've gone through things here and we won't talk to you so what this man here did was he had come out of the umbrella of the Baptist Church and so under him who about 100 different groups and so he invites me and when I got out there what do we see you know he had a signpost you know independent baptist something-something so when we got in here was about over 100 ministers and so i went in there and i speak on the name Jesus and I did the best I knew how to present Jesus and I tell you it was very astounding the man says that this door is open for you so I started getting again those ministers would bring them to my church and then we were to keep transporting them and we continued teaching them and so when they you know I talked about Acts chapter 2 verse at 8 the best way I knew how and so I said the poor is ready if you want to be baptized they did not answer back to me I said I wonder what this is now because this is the dog this is the beginning point and so they said excuse me I said yes John the Baptist baptized in living water I said fine if living water we shall do that hair to travel into their area and you know what they took to they took me to as living water IIT was such a route was just sealed too much clay and so much so I said thank God I did bring my wife with me because she won't let me go in there but by grass I went in there and I baptized those ministers and then when I walked out I said well I don't want those clothes to go back into my house you see but you know that's the kind of hunger that the people have if we could be open you know and got them on their level and so this message here is the character of Christ on display so the people keep watching the fruit you see if they see there is something they can feed off of that tree they always make a move so we need to really keep ourselves as a a fruitful bright tree you know producing the very correct of Christ when these guys are hungry they can come and pluck some and eat amen and out of us would flow rivers of living water if they are fast of reality they will come down and tap in and drink so we found God who out of our hearts would flow rivers of living water that the faster can be able to come and drink some amen so we could speak much but let us get down if we can stand up and get into the service tonight so we pray that you just remember us in your prayers different things that are happening out there some of them are being run out of their buildings and you know we are doing everything that we can to see that they are accommodated some of the churches now the buildings have been reclaimed back from them so this pastor here he just now has to do house to house selves through the week to keep the church going but they've taken the sacrifice amen less prayer dear father the great I am the one who came to display his life through his son Jesus Christ we thank Heavenly Father for Woolworths they'll add to us father God you've been so gracious that you extended your hand of love father while we were yet sinners you just dressed yourself you accepted to take our scene that you can give us your righteousness so each time we come into the presence of Jehovah in moments like this Heavenly Father our hearts uh challenged about your goodness love and mercy and definitely five each time we open the heart our hearts get so anxious because we know that we are going to dine from the word of life may you every father be the teacher tonight break this food Lord go to your hungry children further that would ever be say tonight may not be the words of the minister but the words of the Holy Spirit Himself father dear Lord God challenges encourages correctors father dear Lord God for we've got a journey to travel Lord God to the change of our bodies be gracious Heavenly Father and feed us what we have need of tonight in Jesus name Amen so we thank God let's start the book of Saint Luke chapter 2 and verse 40 the scripture says and the child grew and worked strong in spirit filled with the wisdom and the grace of God was upon him made the Lord that blessing the reading of his word you may be seated so I am our title tonight that the word grows into harvest so Christ the word grew to you he met his purpose here on earth and while Peter looks at him he uses the words that being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth forever meaning that the Word of God which is the seed that brings life is eternal it abideth forever meaning that the word in the predestinated ground with us all trials and weathers or conditions and it comes to the harvest because once it's left in its channel it liveth and abideth for ever so what we need to do is just suck in that word just give it a good learning spot in your life and once you do that it'll leave it forever you may go through your situations your ups and downs you may have hard times but if the seed is on the inside there it with us all both circumstances and it comes to a maturity Amen so we know that in the beginning was the word the word is the source of existence and anything with the life reproduces itself and it grows amen so I want you to know that God's folks is what we know the world because ever what org units from the thought so God's thoughts we given life by the spoken word amen so the word is not the word unless it has got the ability to bring forth an existence yes because in the beginning was the world and that word was God's fault they were God's creative concepts they were what God wanted to be and so now he brought his faults and passed them through the word and he said let there be so God's Word never fails you know once it comes through his mouth it puts her life because it's incorruptible it never dies it doesn't matter what circumstances it goes through but if it's that way it's eternal amen so being a believer means to tap into God see folks just tap it the fault just stay there in the channel and allow the first flow through you and where the thoughts flows through your channel express them as God's Word you know and once you speak them is God Himself that's whispers were to give his one life hey man is not me that's responsible for God's why not sir God is responsible for his own well is not my world so once I take God's thoughts and I help them in my mind then God Himself waters them to life amen so you know we know that he gave Moses defaults and when Moses spoke the thoughts of God they became life you see is one thing believing what God says but is another harboring those souls and speaking them out if Moses believed what God said that was fine but God required him to say what God says before it can become life brother Branham says a word is the fruit expressed and so then when God thought it and put it in Moses mind and his pocket it became a word from God thoughts to Moses thoughts and through Moses it becomes the word and Moses turned around and went back maybe not a fly in the country in an hour from them maybe one old green fly began to buzz around in half hour there was ten thousand pounds per square yard what was it the creative word of god that was spoke by the lips of the Matra man so the word is a phottix press so the prophets always waited on god's thoughts many times we don't really get into that channel because we are not so you know we are not so given to really trapping into the channel you see we need to tap into the channel but the words that we read may become living folks that's the only way they can work if they are in the book so if they are in the tapes they are goes through folks but you see they have to draw down our hearts as revelation and once they get into our hearts by revelation that's when it becomes the Word of God if we speak it out amen so and when God revealed these faults to those prophets they express the fault by saying thus says the Lord God fold sir to come as revelation and so strong that they cannot really get of of the souls both thoughts were so strong that they influenced the lives of these men they were so strong that they could not just do without those thoughts they govern their lives those thoughts govern their judgments good thoughts govern their future amen and so you know they just come and speak them out sometimes even not understanding what they were saying and you know until you the word the message of the hour becomes God's strong folks they remain written letter so what do we read or what we hear off of the tails we need to pray about those things we sell oh god I wish you could give them to me as inspired thoughts amen you see like Isaiah 7:14 was a fault and when the prophets spoke it is to put on flesh 500 years later because it was God's creative cos'è did as I understand that not at all had you ever heard of it before no but it was so strong but it controlled always thinking and he wanted it off of him and he says a virgin shall conceive then he steps back and says but how how was the man he wondered how but you know when he spoke it was God's thoughts coming through a clean channel and was God's thoughts go through a clean channel the Holy Spirit Himself gives that word life amen sir brother Branham says the world is a seed but isola sowed in the ground and every seed will bring forth of its kind if you need salvation the seed is here if you need healing here is the seed in the world the Word of God is a seed put it in your heart don't dig it up every morning to see if it is sprouted put it in there and leave it there is God's business to bring forth the harvest you just leave it there water it by faith and prays every day thanking God for it believe it go out whether you understand it or you don't give thanks to God for it water eating with prayer and you know he and they go forward justifying Oh God said Oh God say so the reason why God's word comes through your mind is because God has found you a good ground he has found you a good ground God's Word was to put on flesh through your believing channel you thank God because these thoughts come through your mind they are not data faults they are not evil thoughts but God is bringing greater light about his word and as you share it among yourself and it becomes a testament of your life you know God Himself desires to bring that word to pass so when good thoughts pass your mind believe them meditate on them speak it into the channel of creation because that's the way the word comes to be a creative concept when you speak it see there are so many things that both our lives as children of God we have all these kind of troubles in our families we've got different troubles in the church this family sometimes against the other family and so many different things begin to bother us but simply because we are feeding on the negative seeds and yet every seed has got a life so once you allow your seed in a good ground it's going to sprout you see this is the problem of the sower you know when the the evil and so but all my the Son of God has sown seeds the ground is good he comes and was to salsa so you see that ever seen but you are a good ground and God chose his word through you the enemy will work to come and so some behind you but you see you do not have to open channel for the negative seeds if the devil comes down and say ah after we were not born again say no the word says I'm a son of God amen keep sowing the right seeds tell the devil I come from God tell the devil redeemed tell the devil God's righteousness you keep sowing the right seed and you're going to have the right harvest tell that the from the righteousness of God in Christ and the devil is going to back up because he has no part in you amen speak the fruits of God because if folks are creative concepts amen don't speak your fears I know that there are certain fears that come your way anything that negative you say now that's the wrong soul trying to commit a good ground rejection those fears reject when the bill comes and says are you sure you gonna make it you say yes I'm gonna make it because I'm not a preacher of Tang am eternal amen don't speak your differences amen when that ever comes I've said the church is going to get to know you sir devil we are one body we are of one bag we have got one God we've got one purpose the name your good ground amen don't keep speaking about your weaknesses amen turn that ever I could be weak but let my strength be manifested through my weakness let the weak say I am strong amen so the word is the seed and it comes with its potentials and the white zone in a good ground it will bring forth an eternal character yes because that's what the world is all about it has to manifest Christ it will definitely bring for the attributes of Christ not your attributes now but the attributes of Christ that's what the word does you remember the transition of David when he was trying to become king determines under the tortures and the persecutions that so talked him through but after all of it you know saw was dead David says is there not any of the house of soul that I may show the kindness of God on to him he wanted to show the right side he had been tormented as a human being he could get bitter sometimes but he says well I need to start sowing good seeds these seeds are not my seeds but they are seeds of Christ that dwells in me I must begin to bear his fruits the fruit of the Spirit and then he says is there any of the house of soul that has remained that I may show him not my kindness but the kindness of God hallelujah he says that my own is not possible but I'm speaking living thieves praise God so you know the word as is for patience he says not my kindness but the kindness of God no wonder it is pure he has no ever charge is not self glorifying he does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not of his own you know it works for the benefit of the body not easily provoked thinketh no evil does not rejoice in iniquity that's what the right seed sir it looks at all these good gifts and he says fine but if there is no charity if they are not prepared by the life of Christ so it bears all things like in the case of David that's what the CDs and once you put the right seats amen even through the mouth of the Prophet like Balaam the word remains positive why do you think Balaam got that kind of problem Balaam was interfered with by Balak but before that he was an anointed prophet he had the right seats on the side of him and when the temptation come even though the seat that was in him remains positive he said there shall come a stir out of debt Jacob and - arise out of Israel and shall - might the corners of mower then he stands back and says what's this kinda magic the word even through the life of the Prophet like a bailer how about the word if it's rightly planted in our hands what do you think it shall produce see we should know that the word never fails it has an eternal nature he says that an incorruptible seed and through the seven church edges it has worked through em any memory body was in a good ground it speaks Christ was a good ground for that word in Jesus it spoke volumes because he was a predicated ground he says lo I come in the volume of the book that's written of me to express the image of the invisible God he manifested that name are you together with me yeah you know John 17 6 6 I believe it is he says I have manifested ining they believe that John 17 6 of manifest remaining but you know you start wondering because sometimes we don't really look back and understand what the name stands for the name is the definition of character and sometimes this definition if it comes from God is a prophecy even in the midst of the weakness he says there at Vita and yet Peter was foretelling but it was a professor thou shalt not be called Abram but Abraham he had no son but you know the name was the definition of the caller and so in Jesus came down and he says that manifested thy name I have come down to manifest the attributes of the great Jehovah all that God was I'm here to manifest hallelujah so the word is the fruits of God Express when it finds good ground in the heart of the believer you manifest what God is that way the believer becomes the volume of the book just like Jesus was the volume of the book amen you become that written epistle to express those attributes that way you need not anybody commend who the lat you do not want any and you don't need a letter of commendation please receive brother so-and-so because he's an open book what you see is what you buy amen when the Holy Spirit comes into your life he opens you up because you are a written epistle rather woman so the word becomes the recommendation hallelujah it's the seed growing on the side of us and bringing forth of his own fruits it comes to harvest amen in numbers 203 Moses did not declare himself the meekest man on earth but the word declared in the meekest man you know because that's the fruit that was tangible the seed comes to harvest j11 the career job man that was perfect and upright and one that feared God and eschewed evil is not one who says look at what I am but the seed on the inside brings for the harvest amen Isaiah fretta 1 verse 8 decay at Abraham the friend of God is not Abram who said you know who I am I'm Abram the friend of God no sir Acts chapter 13 verse 22 he raised up unto them bility to be their king to whom also he gave their testimony and say I have found David the son of Jesse a man after my own hat hallelujah why there is something on the inside that friends good ground and takes control the king sits on the throne and begins to bring forth his life into harvest and the Swint happens bosses no longer i but quest that leaves him amen John fight father here he says I kind of my own self do nothing as they hear I judge and my judgment and my judgment is just because I speak not my own will but the will of the Father which are said to me I bear witness i if I bear witness of myself my witness is not true there is another that beareth witness of me and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true who is the Christ that lived in the Jesus body he says he witnesses and this witness is true are you together with me so brother Branham says Christ did not come down to make himself known he did not come to reveal the Sun he kept revealed and no the father see what I'm saying so he did not come to testify of himself but the father that brought on the inside that seed of life but existed in Genesis one had found a ground to make himself made manifest again he came to reveal the father as we come to reveal Christ and every one of us has a unique part to reveal but is the producer where God works he can call Peter John James Paul different brothers as pastors but the way he worked through us is totally different everybody has got a part the seed on the inside there comes up to manifest himself amen and you know you have your predestinated position in Christ you possess it you step in there and then you say now father I'm ready to bring manifestation let me try to get into this adult faith here let me say this which we all know but when Malachi for him he thought if we had the or robust field without the big Ram field but then we also have the Malachi 4 field listen friends there's something that I want to bring out here now all this field also and you see as long as life continues sowing and reaping shall not cease that scripture so you saw simply because you are looking for a harvest if there is no harvest expected there is no reason why we saw are you together with me so Malachi 4 came he sought the fields with all this under mania or robbers Billy Graham they never saw the world so they don't feed in the parable of muscle fatigue because the parable says the solar showed the world are you together with me so technically we are in the harvest amen so the people simply you see the people are separated for the message and you start seeing that they are bearing the fruit of the Spirit they exhibiting the life of Christ the fullness of the Godhead bodily again showing that we in the harvest the child has grown again through Luther wisly Pentecost and now the bringing back of the world to bring forth the fruit again the scripture says and the child grew let's go just back here to Luke chapter 2 verse 40 he says here and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit filled with wisdom and grace of God was upon him and verse 52 he says and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man so the life you know hard to grow and brother branham show thyself that happens in the series not here with the shack so once the Sidious saw it the womb of a virgin it grew and then the child was born but when the child was born that was not our Redemption the Bible says and the child grew and then he brought forth the gospel Redemption and then he went to Calvary and took our sinful nature upon himself to give us his own righteousness by bringing down the bottom of the holocaust in the upper room and when that happened but child again was being bought and this child had to grow he had to grow through Ephesus he had to go through Samana he had to go through a bigamist he had to go through all those ages to come to the age of the harvest are you together with me so the child has grown again through Luther Wesley Pentacles and now back into the fruit time here we are we are in the time of the harvest we are life of his life spirit of his spirit and when Christ is our life shall appear we shall appear with him that's who we are we a quest one more time but in a physical body we shall be like him that's the harvest amen so as is you know that's first John chapter 4 verse 17 I believe which says as he is I mean so a we in this one he says as he is so are we in this one meaning but we are the manifestation of his invisibility like he was the manifestation of the invisibility of Jehovah Ponyo and then brother Branham says what God was he poured into Christ and what Christ was he poured into the bright body and then John says as he is in the present tense so are we in this world and he says that is our bonus in the day of judgment hallelujah he has brought us up into that to restore the image and character that gave the authority of Dominion we are here he can never judge his own body that's why he says we have passed from judgment to life so now listen our friends but teaching grains kept sowing the seed of the world through the Ministry of Malachi flow so out there it was another photo familiar for the Baptist another DS but the word was served by Malachi for in good health now listen if the sowing of the way is where we have the three kinds of ground the wayside peroxide and even the good ground all these are in the message churches because that's where the word was so so friends if we are going to bear the fruit we had better take care of our ground he says break the fallow ground and don't show in the fold take care of your ground because the seed sown in a good ground is the only web that can come to harvest amen so now we know that the teaching grains came and many people sometimes we get a little bit of confusion here they say all you know the former rain was the teaching but the Holy Spirit is the latter rain but no both ways it is the Holy Spirit is the Holy Spirit as the planter because you cannot teach a dry litter and it brings life the Holy Spirit has to be behind every statement to energize it so he is the solar and the Energizer the one who bring first promise so what are we talking about that in the sowing of the seed entirely the Holocaust is responsible okay your tournament attitude was to here he says my doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distil as the dew as the small rain upon the tender hub and as the showers upon the grass so there's nothing much add here because he sold in the former rain he gave us all that we needed for this journey we have it on the tapes everything that we have need of you see so you know he gave you to us so we are being remembered game after revelation 10 7 and the mystery of Christ has been revealed down here he's telling us pipbuck no seeds and sewed them back again thou shalt prophesy again I write this clear one more time I'll still run back the same shoes that Malachi for so so here we stand in a special time whereby we are not only having the seeds into the harvest but what we have this we sow back amen see that's what is happening here the same one who came as the former rain is the same one that comes forth in the manifestations the same spirit because listen friends when the former rain went down to server he says I'll come back again as the lottery he I brought the promise but he I'll come and energized the promise he says our return and see according to the time of life it will not be another one but I will return again unto thee in the time of life it's the same one listen friends here we you know you use motoring all the time you know motorbikes in you know those four-wheelers and because but the man who puts together the mechanics is the one who also arranges for the dynamics of the track it's the same one that's the same thing we have you see that was you give yourself over to the former rain and the seed is planted he says it's incorruptible the rain will come upon it you see what I'm talking about it's the same passion let me give you Joey chapter two here there is something here I want to bring hopefully it can bless us Joey to verse 23 he says be glad be ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former a moderately the same one he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the lottery in the first month are you together with me first of all he has to serve the former II and then after does that he brings us in Revelation 10 8 and he says thou must prophesy again so in this mafia of the harvest there is a unique time here where he says that you have to serve back again and again the manifestation should keep coming behind the word that you saw so there is a one-man promise which is Malachi 4 cramming alone in the former rain but after he has done that and the bride has separated itself to the message then which we get has to be planted back and he says at that time I'll be singing both rains together that's the promise that we are standing in and in Isaiah chapter 6 were three he makes it so clear he says then shall we know if we fall on to know the Lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come at us as the rain as the latter and for marine unto death he says after Malachi who has done his job the promise of this hour is not latter in the promise of this hour is firmer and Lipari together and that's why he says on the sensitive he shall come to us as the former and latter in together that's why we have got pastels butter peeking the former rain seeds and planting them back and the Holy Spirit is following those seeds in the hearts of the children of God thus our good works every seed must come to a harvest the person of Christ comes there to us of the former and latter rain together short quick work amen so every minister is the anointed as a planter to pass on the understanding by a gift amen and the same ole spirit resides in the heart of every believer too quickly that sea which lands in a good ground so that every seed must have an opportunity of coming to the harvest if there is no harvest then there is no need for us to do the sewing you saw because there must be a harvest listen friends when he said the words in the bride as it was in Mary he met that the word will and compromise restoration the word could not remain a baby throughout the word had to grow but many times when we read the court the court never changes it remains in the sub is static that's the written word even right after now we can go to as a 7:14 is in the scripture a virgin shall conceive but when we minister sometimes we said the word is in the bride as it was in the Mary Mary gave birth when are you giving back to the sketch of the perfect man are you together with me you are because there must be a bath and until you have the bath that you can also be able to plant you can't give what you don't have amen so the crop is now formed by the latter rain in this season where we are and we identify as the very bright and life of Christ Jeremiah the Proms chapter 5 verse 24 Naida said they in their heart let us now fear the Lord our God that giveth rain both the former and latter knee season he reserved unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest I love that this is he gives the rain and he reserves a season for the harvest so when the seed goes into the ground God reserves the firm a special thing and in this space of time Boaz comes down in his field because they harvest is good and that's the time again when you see Ruth coming up here interior sowing and reaping and this Ruth here what happens she conceives to bring forth the same you see we are in this season here friends the return of the very life that went into the ground let me give you this quote I love it Christ was the first one trace from the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bright coming of Christ coming out of the church they'll have to be achieved with the game in the last days so here we are there must be another harvest we are he experiencing again the life of the original seed its adoption time you see it's the time to manifest at the life of Christ amen so you see brother Stephen why do we have discrepant feeds now but look at people for this one then people for that you know why because we're in the harvest that's the reason why because we're in the harvest now so the principle matter team is that when the authentic so when sowing the seeds the non-authentic came behind sowing the tares are you together with me now the players with sown in the right brain and the follower also comes and comes in some kind of a smooth way he sews exactly the seed he does not show doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church he says there the Pharisee but the war problem lays on the attitude behind it the motive behind it he says together this seed with something else a little bit of philosophy here and a little bit of psychology there some form of competition personal goals and it's not basically Pentecostal doctrine because you would catch that the motive and objective was what makes the seed a seed of descriptors and that's what makes Matthew 24:24 because you cannot tell the man preachers God yet bossom in Jesus name serpent seed as all these kind of things but the attitude with which the seed comes is what creates manipulate the 424 and every seed but goes in the ground comes through the habit so we're now the firm owner looked around he could not differentiate between the wheat and the tares they were standing on the same doctrine they were both saying God you know sent us a prophet they were standing on the same water baptism they were saying exactly the same but what spoils the seed is the attitude with which we received the word and sent away we need to keep our channel clean he says break up the fallow ground that you may not show in the film's best way maastradamus a metaphor is so slick because it ties people to the duck letter and the word is the word if only it can bring forth its purpose Christ was that word because we grew to come to the harvest and the father's is the purpose for which the seed comes into the ground let there be light there's no light what happens does not God's were God's work has positive life behind it the principles let them go together and in the time of the harvest that's why you see all these things happen somebody kicked back the message and somebody did they didn't know what they were looking for you know they come to the time of challenge but the attitude with which they were seen god help us to clean the channel you see when Paul sowed the seed his fear was men and so that kind of seed with some kind of attachment pulling people to themselves the object was not Christ and process watch out because this seed must be kept in its original channel you see so we shall be given a period of harvest thus the law of sowing and reaping the reserve is the season of harvest see and now that's why I say we're now adoption time the manifestation of the sons of God they see coming to its harvest in DC let's go to Romans chapter 8 here and see if I can finish somewhere you know sometimes you really do not know who you are and that was the problem of joy he he was redeemed he was a son of God but he was not sure because it had not struck his heart as a revelation and so now at the closing of the edges then a voice calls him come up hither and when he moved over his trusting Thrones were set and then he saw my the judgment has come but Who am I journey began to cry that's the revelation that we needed to have if we can know that we are redeemed and our names I am the Lamb's Book of Life we shall settle down but if we do not know who we are we cannot come to the harvest you see the purpose of this message is to bring people to a settlement that they settled realize that no their what God called them for the purpose that's where we grow up - but you see people are not settled they are running back and forth this way and that you and then fears and then oh pastor I don't know whether I've got it or you know we need to come to a point of settlement let me tell you the reason why you're here is because you are a child of God God near you from before the foundation of the world and let me tell you you've got a body waiting for you if you don't make it what will God do with that body because it's the time it is eternal the shadows are around you find that's what God is dealing with so he allows you to go into chastisement so that we may clean this spirit this spirit which controls you and takes you into this and packs into that that's what God is dealing with are you together with me yes let me tell you even in nature knows that you are a child of God and what nature is crying for is father let this your children come to the realization of who they are let them come to the harvest let's go to Romans chapter 8 verse 19 for be honest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God now the manifestation is just a clearing away of the mist of the frog that kind of you know causes you to think like you're not part of it you know this bracketing in the cuttin of time you know as long as you're in the cuttin of time you'll have fears but you see the only way we can overcome these fears is by remembering what God said about you brother Branham at the similar fears he says what shall I be like will I make it I wonder I wish I got can you let me says would you want me to go beyond the car he says exactly brother Branham had similar fears like you do and God says let me take you behind bigger the cuttin of time this button here is the liar it's ducking sentences but the creation knows who you are and the creatures are pray that you may compare realization of who you are and you know that God is helping you to come to a time of harvest which is abduction time the manifestation of the sons of God is the seed on the side of you that must come to that position it's not this thing here is the seed on the side of you and once the seed on the side of you comes this type of maturity to realize Who I tell you that will be the king on the throne you begin to combine your kingdom you take control of your flesh hallelujah because God will have brought back the image and likeness he says let us make man in our image and in our likeness to have dominion so when you come to the harvest you are actually bringing back the life of the seed which is on the side of you and that was the image and likeness which God wants you to take and stand at the top of your fears hallelujah let this thing not talk to you when this thing twice talked to you you took back God's what rate I'm a son of God a man yet I'm chosen and in the Lamb's Book of Life I'm waiting for my body change amen see he says in Romans 8:19 for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God amen for the creature was made subject vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope because the creatures have also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God so we know that the were creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which of the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan with ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of this body for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man sees why does he yet hope for it hallelujah amen Romans for he says that against hope he believed in hope yes if the devil comes and says you have beaten down you shall never bring forth the harvest the stretch of the perfect man you just tell her well that's devil that listen Satan Abram in hope against hope he believed in hope yes God never fails on his word amen so nature groans and his groans are the inner longings for total Redemption and the creatures no but our fate lays in the rest of man nature looks forward in faith believing that the man who fell will count with harvest because the seed that was sown in his body is eternal life nature has faith but you will make it listen listen man and when Adam sinned by heeding his wife's groaning instead of holding to God's Word he lost all his inheritance when he lost his fellowship and righted life remember the day eat thereof that Dave died and when he lost his life he also lost his inheritance in life he lost two things he lost life and also lost his inheritance in life which was the earth he lost both of those and the redemption is bringing those together back you see and now they asked that never seen nature is crying it understands that there is a Redemption coming for it and then he says let man come to his adoption the earth knows you see so when Adam seen he lost his obstructed heed to you know to his property and you know Satan took it over you know to control him but God says I know what I'm going to do I'll take the wheat seed and drop it in the cocklebur the life on the inside is different from this coconut shell and that life is growing it's growing and crowding out the control of this flesh and the child grew and then he says in wisdom in stretcher in grease that was crushing the Jesus body and it's planted now again in another body the body of the church and then he says this child will grow and he says will grind wisdom will grain structure will grow in grace to come to the purpose in mastcam to his harvest the fullness of redemption will be a path of both man and nature God bringing back that state again and then we are saved by grace I mean by by hope that's what he says it will be new bodies and a new earth I'll together with me so we are coming to a time where we really need to look beyond these things here which try to attack us let me tell you the reason why you have trials is simply because you dropped into this body of flesh it has got certain elements that control it this body of flesh even when the Krishna took the body he became hungry I had together with me when he came down into the body of flesh brother the temptations acted towards him and wanted to take out his control and then Paul says he lanta previous by the things he suffered to keep him in the channel so all these things that you go through is God keeping in channel and peel the seed comes to the harvest that's what we are looking for that's what God wants to do this is the season where we are we end the season of D amen he kept revealing portions of himself through the seven chat edges and he kept restoring the elements that make the kingdom and in the age of the odyssia he at the age of game and the end of war things and now he says if you become I'll cause you to sit in my throne as I overcame and I sat in my father throne I manifested who my father was that was the authority I took this wrong and he says even you overcome you are going to be the store of God's divine authority you are going to be the voice of Jehovah Indian time it's the harvest it will be a life it will be a manifestation it will not be things that we say we say but it will be a life that we experience and remember as my father sent me so send are you my father sent me as a growing word so I send you also as a growing word the word has life and once the word is spoken it may take years and years and years but finally two picks up life and brings forth a manifestation amen so don't rely on yourself rely on God's well Holly don't rely on yourself rely on the seed of God's Word and when the time of planting it back a may plant back every seed because there has to be a continuous planting and harvest planting and harvest that's what it is that's what the word is for plant back John 3:16 God loved me gave his life for me plant it back plant every seed black into your soul God to come and whatever a part of his body and then you are going to bring forth fruit all the time fruit all the time fruit all the time and the devil said man this is a great harvest time this man has countries harvest god bless you Lester the harvest is here Boaz wouldn't be in his field but they are the people that have realized that they are the growing of God's Word that will come down to harvest every seed and God will testify about it he will say you are written epistles and you say amen I'm God's were made manifest you see the devil will come you know the devil not ceased being the devil listen friend he will not cease being there yeah because Christ is in you that devil will always try to come and kind of you know swing some kind of lies about you around you but one thing which you need to do as I'm back by the word just go back and you say or a certain I know I know I know but the word says the word says we don't make ourselves the world makes us we can't define ourselves the word defines us that's why we shall come to a time to know as we were know yeah we are realizing who yeah and this is a great moment between the sixth and the seventh seal he hangs him out there and he says look and leave keep your eyes on him look look how it to Jesus just look and leave precious every father we thank you Lord Jesus for the word that we have heard tonight the seed which was planted on the side of us we realized the very father that you too to life the enemy Satan tries to do whatever I guess but as long as we are good ground and father the seed is on the inside the Holy Spirit takes the responsibility of guarding that seed and watering it father that's eternal security and we thank you Lord Jesus for the work that you're doing in our lives we pray that you may continue Heavenly Father just creating channels Lord God for us to go through we pray that you may block the left and broke the right front and that we may walk in a straight line oh how we desire already father that you may give us grace grab truth faith fact that the alert God in the work that we are planted on the side of us Lord we have confidence that Lourdes this one he is going to come to a harness because we don't blunt ourselves but you plant yourself and you have eternal life you'll never fail we have confidence in you we surrender all that we are to you O Lord that every father you may watch over us that father dear Lord God whatever step we take in life help us that we may take it together with you be that pillar of fire that went before the children of Israel be our protection every father and where there is no way we pray that you may make a way for us we know every father the battles that we go through to come home but yet every father you came down to walk us home with you bless our hearts father and give us the confidence in the world not in ourselves in Jesus name Oh hallelujah god bless you [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's take a little by little and go back over that message you know it's uh the word itself it has life within it and it's God's thoughts being delivered and we we come to the realization and I believe God brings us to this more and more that words we are receiving the word we are not receiving something that is not already in us we are receiving the life that activates what he has already placed within us so you are already the word it's not God repeating himself it's God activating what is already there it's like I know this might be a lot for some of the older people but you have cell phones and inside of that cell phone there you get it some of the cell phones say by this cell phone it is for Verizon this one is for spring then you buy a certain cell phone you have to pay a little bit more money that says it's open whatever network that cell phone has a SIM card with in it which means it is built to be able to communicate and receive the signals that are already out there translate them so we receive calls and texts and so we're able to tap in to what is already going through here God has provided to where that that can be submitted and there is a channel we can get into to where that's that that seed that SIM card becomes activated and when it becomes activated then you begin to have communication you begin to have you begin to see images are being sent the images are sent to your videos are sent to you messages are sent to you tweets are sent to you is that right yeah the Lord speaks to you because you have been baptized into this network hallelujah and you have the same cellular service that Philip had that Peter had that Andrew had the same service it is laying and resting within us oh my I tell you the Lord is so good at me the word is so so rich and so precious to our hearts amen aren't you thankful tonight when you look back over the tests and trials of your life that it's God's mercy and God's grace to keep us as clean channels in that powerful God it's God it's not us there's not one of us that would ask and say Lord I want to trial I want to test none of us do that but the Bible says is the trying of our faith it also says it worketh patience and the whole part is cleansing and purging so that that life and his work might be accomplished aren't you grateful looking job look at job's life God here the expanse of what is it 42 43 44 chapters look at the expanse of it and God spins in the volume of job God spins telling job have you considered this

raindrop to do and all that right there their testimonies of what I'm doing in you oh my so if God wrote his Bible than a nature in you and I can look at that and say Lord the tests and trials you're cleansing me and removing from me toxins impurities the attitude that would affect the delivery of that word aren't you glad for God's grace oh if it was up to us treat all my attitudes good but I'm so glad that God evaluates and when he comes on the scene we can say Lord forgive me Lord help me forgive me Lord cleanse me oh my oh my my my my mother Stephen it was too long and we will not let you
