and move in on aren't you glad that God gives us the first opportunity to create an atmosphere that he can come Hallelujah and just do what he does man we want the Lord to have the right away tonight

of God what God has for us how many believes that God is mindful of your need he knows just what you and I have need of and sometimes the things that we're even thinking about really God sees things that need to be moved first and speak to this area and God knows just even how to speak to whatever it is that we even have need of and I believe we've come here tonight to hear from the Lord amen so let's just as we sing that Course once again brother Brian was leading Us in just Draw Me Close to You Lord that's our only desire amen draw me close to [Music] you and never let me go I lay it all

not with the temper I have or with the rebellious spirit that I have but I'm want to leave closer to you and I trust that your desire in an atmosphere like this all things are possible Hallelujah my what an atmosphere that's been created amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to Daniel 11:32 like to say it's such an honor to be here this evening um I'm brother Josh Martin from Pony Oklahoma um I'm just a simple preacher but I I pray something could be said to be blessing I appreciate the opportunity to be ministering tonight it's good to have my wife Loretta with me and our our two children Ethan our little boy he's two almost three and Brielle is five months I believe four or five months something like that so it's it's good to have them with me you know I I always say it's it's nice going to new churches with your wife because if you have nobody to talk to you can always talk to your wife and so it's it's such a blessing having her travel with me I know it's a sacrifice especially with with two children and and a toddler Ethan is full of energy but it's it's so good to have them with me tonight um Daniel 11:32 the Bible would say and such as do wickedly against the Covenant and shall he corrupt by flatteries but the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits are you thankful for that this evening can we B our heads tonight dear heavenly father Lord what an honor it is to come into your house Lord God as we feel your presence Drawing Near to us Lord you promised where two or three are gathered in your name you wouldd be in our midst father and Lord we feel you here tonight father we've made your welcome Lord we we've sang songs of worship Lord to to create an atmosphere for your word to fall in Father Lord as we submit oursel to you I ask that you would speak through this vessel father Lord you placed a gift in my life Lord and I give it back to you father you see the needs that are in this building Lord that can only be met by you father Lord we need the supernatural tonight to walk the aisles and touch the hearts Lord Lord we lay the service into your hands we ask these things in your precious name amen you may be seated tonight and if I had a subject it would be a people that know their God and we know brother brandom would place this scripture at the end time and he would say this here and all that Daniel said about the last days and how that they that know their God will do exploits and just so many scriptures tying in this day that we're living in how that these time that these are evil times deceiving times would be on the earth and just exactly what we're having now fulfills it and they that had been given a chance to seek him but they rejected the very Messiah and today it's the same thing the very same thing we are given the opportunity then brother Brandon would say in in another place Daniel said in that day they run to and fro knowledge shall increase and he said the wise shall know their God and in that day they shall do they shall do great exploits in that day but the wicked will not know the god of Heaven they know him in a form or in a ritual and I think my knowing him in a form or a ritual ain't the realities of God I believe just coming to church is fine but we need to come to a reality and I believe that the message has brought a reality to us where it's no longer just a duty it's no longer just scriptures or quotes but it's a reality that is a on the inside of the Believers and brother Brandon would say and I think today we have much fine preaching many fine ministers able ministers that has brought the word and your pastors and the evangelists and so forth that comes through the city but I think the main thing that I'm trying to bring to you is the reality of the presence of Christ that you might see him and know that it's him by his identified promise for today so we got to identify where he's at we got to identify and how we identify him is by scripture and I believe this message is so backed up by scripture that we can identify him for today not a god of yesterday but a god of today not promises made for yesterday but promises made for today so the Bible would tell us there were two different people and what's going to separate the two people is knowing their God the world has been given a chance to see him but they have rejected him but on the other hand there's a group that's been predestinated not to reject him but to see him so I believe the Bible is talking about a literal people coming in contact with the literal God and Performing literal exploits literal signs and wonders but I don't believe it's a random people but it's a chosen people that has been been predestinated to see the things of God because if you wasn't predestinated to see it you would have rejected it as well you know brother Brandon m the only ones that can see it is the one who was predestinated to see it or otherwise you'll never see it the Jews could not see that being their Messiah and yet they were Scholars theologians men of great renowned scholarship read the Bible that you read now after all it's been made known to us we see a plain that it was the Messiah but they couldn't see it neither can they see it today and that just struck me when I read that that it's obvious that Christ was the Messiah it was God made flesh but without it being revealed they couldn't see it he come to his own and his own received him not oh my but as many that were ordained to eternal life believed oh I believe we're not just here by accident but we've been brought here for a purpose and with something on the inside to identify scripture for this generation and so that's why this people is a predestinated people without being predestinated you'll never identif Iden ify it but being predestinated you can't help but identify it you know and as you look upon the message of the hour many are turning away and saying it's a false prophet a false prophecy a false uh he's a liar and he's a deceiver they can't help but not see it but at the same time we can't help but see it we've been predestinated to see what God has in this generation and brother Brandon would saying notice God when he called Abraham he didn't say Abra if you will do a certain thing I will do a certain thing he said Abraham I have already done it not what you did what I did what God did he said now when he made a covenant with Adam if you'll not touch the tree you'll live forever Adam broke it Moses and them if you keep the Commandments I'll do so so and so if you break the Commandments I'll do so and so when God makes a covenant with man man breaks his Covenant with God but I love this part right here but so that the elected the church the elected people the called out separated group of people which sure to be saved God called them by Grace oh my so it's Grace that we are saved not what we know not what we we can do but we're predestinated called by Grace so that we can't help but see it in this generation everybody is trying to be the people everybody wants to be the people they want to do the supernatural they want to do the they want to live a life but they haven't been called to it everybody claims to be the bride we're the church we're the we're the ones God has called but there's only one group that is the bride of Christ that is the ones that is called by his grace oh Hallelujah the Bible would say you have not chosen me but I have chosen you we didn't choose God but he chose you when you was running from the grace of God he chose you when you was running from the things of God he chose you when you was on a bar store he chose you when you was in pornography he chose you and there's nothing you can do that can outrun the grace of God if you're called for this generation you can outrun the grace of God oh Hallelujah you have not chosen me when there was no desire for my things I chose you when you turned away from the message I still chose you oh and I say if there's doubts concerning this message you're still Chosen and just wait there's a revelation coming for you don't give up on the Revelation if you're elected to it you can't help but see it oh Hallelujah but look at the grace of God when we was unable to choose God he chose us whenever we was unable to go to God he come to us oh Hallelujah you can look at Peter he was unable to choose Christ before the car Crow twice but God still chose him and I think that is so amazing but Christ even told Peter you're going to deny me and he says no Lord I'm not going to deny you I'll stand for you I'll go to the very end I'll stand for you but in the time of pressure the pressure got to him and he denied him he cursed but when Jesus resurrected again he says go tell my disciples don't forget about Peter go tell my disciples and tell Peter the grace is still calling his name oh this evening you might feel like you're in the dumps but Grace is calling your name you might feel like it complete failure but Grace is calling your name saying I haven't forgotten you I haven't forsaken you you might have failed me yesterday but the grace of God is still calling you oh it was Jesus saying Peter I'm I'm I'm being identified by scripture my grace is letting you know I'm here fulfilling scripture oh and it's the grace of God that is telling us in this generation that we're fulfilling scripture oh hallelujah it's only by the grace of God and it is so what amazes me about the scripture the Bible would say in John 15- 16 you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go forth and bring forth much fruit and that your fruit should remain and he's letting the letting us know that we're not just going to have fruit today and lose it tomorrow but he ordained us to have fruit and that our fruit should remain and you see the word ordains means to appoint to set so God didn't just choose us just to choose us but he chose us so that we can be appointed with good works oh you see we wasn't just saved to sit on pews we wasn't just saved to be a Christian on Thursday nights and on Sunday mornings but we was appointed to have good works every day of the week we know that we're not saved by our works we're not saved by our actions but if we are saved it's going to produce such a life that we've been predestinated to to fulfill and that your fruit should remain and you notice right after he says that he says though whatsoever you shall ask of my of the father in my name he may give it to you and so he's letting you know that the third pole ain't the only exploits the exploits ain't just you speaking the word but the exploits is you're living the word he's letting you know don't be so worried about the spoken word and that's fine that comes with it don't be trying to do Miracles and do this but live the word first then once there's fruits that is remaining then you're going to ask oh Hallelujah and I say Lord I'm a bright I'm the people that you called for this generation that has a life I have the fruits of the spirit the message ain't just in a book The Message ain't just in a tape but the message has come on the inside and the fruits of the message message is manifesting itself in my life not just today but it's remaining oh when I wake up in a bad mood the fruits remain oh when I wake up on the wrong side of the bed the life of the word is still on the inside and that whatsoever you shall ask oh Hallelujah you should go forth and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask in my name don't be worried about this get the fruits from first then it will produce the word it will produce the spoken word hallelujah and so it's it's Grace that has chose us to live a life not just a life but it chose us to be a Powerhouse oh Hallelujah and you see he he links the two together exploits ain't just a spoken word but exploits is a life many people put the life on the back shelf until Sunday mornings then they pick the life back up and they put it on and they say Lord how come I'm not overcoming how come I my family ain't in Revival you put the fruits on the shelf and trying to put on the supernatural but you need a life first then once the life is on the inside it will produce it Hallelujah sir the Bible is saying in Ephesians 2 and8 for by grace are you saved through faith but not of yourself it is the gift of God not of Works L any man shall boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them walking what brother Josh good works he's saying here it's not works that we're saved but it's because of Grace that we can produce the life it's only the grace of God that we can live a life every day the church World wants to live and overcoming life but there's nothing to produce it but because of Grace We're saved and can produce good works and walk in them oh Hallelujah so we're not just saved by grace to fill up you but we're saved by grace to express the life of God and if we ever get that Revelation we'll look at Christianity in a whole different view Christianity ain't just something that we claim what what what brother brandom say being being a Christian is to be Christlike so we're not just claiming the life of Christianity but the Life of Christ has claimed us to be a workmanship and to perform the works that he has called us to perform the Bible would tell us in First Peter 2 and9 but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who ha called you out of Darkness into Marvelous Light and I like how how scofi scoffield puts it he says that you should show forth the Praises of him who had called us and he describes Praises as virtues as excellencies so the one that has called us has called us to express the virtues of God oh Hallelujah the attributes that was once in the mind of God is now being expressed in the people that he has called out of Darkness into marvelous light oh Hallelujah you're one Earth more than just to sit on a Pew you are God's Powerhouse you are God's body upon this Earth you're the expression of the life of God in this generation oh it's no longer a one man Ministry but it's a multi member Ministry upon the Earth the same life that was in Jesus Christ is in the body of Jesus Christ expressing the virtues oh it's the virtues inside of the body but the Brandon would say the True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is likened to pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her ATT her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect oh hallelujah we're just a reflection you know brother brandom talks about the morning dew he says you look at the Dew and it's sparkling and you wonder how is it sparkling it's not the de doing it it's the sun just reflecting it through the de oh Hallelujah and you can ask how come there's a bride on Earth without spot and without wrinkle it's not her ability she's just called by Grace coming under the word of this generation and is expressing the attributes of God oh remember the bubbling brook we have the privilege of seeing it some years back where the brandom talked about the bubbling brook he says you can go by the Brook Any Time of the Season any time of the year and it's always bubbling and you could ask it what makes you bubble is it because the deer drink from you no sir is it because I drink from you no it's not because of you and he would ask it how come you're always so bubbly he says it's not me there's something on the downside that is pushing it up oh hallelujah it's not you trying to perform the Greater Works it's the word inside performing the Greater Works oh come on now the Greater Works wasn't for brother brandom it's for you you are the Greater Works you are the the exploits of in this generation Hallelujah but the brandom continues on to say what he what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest oh what he has she's to manifest so no longer is the Christ manifesting The Works of God but what he had there's another Temple now reflecting it so that means if you get out of step and out of your out of your position who's going to reflect it now oh come on now who's going to reflect the Life of Christ if you don't reflect it what if the moon know decid to not to shine who's going to reflect the light in the dark times but the brandom T types the Bride As the moon he says the moon only reflects what the sun is but if the Earth gets in the way of the Moon and the Sun then it becomes a blackout oh Hallelujah it doesn't mean that the that the son has lost his light it just means the world is in the way oh I'm preaching now and whenever you get in in a discouraging time don't put the worldly things in front of the light of the word when you're discouraged that's the time to get in the message when you're when you're tired that's the time to get in the tapes don't grab oh Hallelujah don't grab worldly pleasures and place it in front of the light because you're going to get darker and darker and darker but I say maybe you're dark this evening but the light of his word is here and preached to pull you out of Darkness so that you can shine forth the virtues of the one who has called you amen hallelujah oh Hallelujah brother Brown would say in that in that same quote there there was found no fault in her she is all glorious within and without from beginning to ending she is the work of her Lord all his works are perfect in fact in her is summed up all the manifested Eternal wisdom and purpose of God he says how can one fathom it how can one understand it though we cannot do that we accept it by faith for God hath spoken it oh we might not understand we might not understand how there's a Rapture but it might be far out there in our mind but we accept it by faith oh brother Brandon would say if we could understand God by reasoning what's what's good and what why do we need Faith but we understand God by faith we understand d The Rapture by faith that's why we needed a message that's why we needed a message we will Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word the word of God not an opinion not a Doctrine not an idea but the true unadulterated word is to produce a faith that can see the realities of God you know brother brandom says there's no realities without faith oh the only way you can see the realities of the super natural is by faith that's why we needed a message to restore the faith back to the original so that we can rise up and see what God is doing in this generation the Bible would say in in Ephesians 1:4 according as Heath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love and that just spoke to me he he he didn't just choose this but he chose us to be holy and Without Blame before him any of you ever thought about that he's the allseeing God he sees in every circumstance he sees in every situation he sees in every hidden agenda but because we're called and chosen we stand before him blameless you ever think about that we stand before him holy and Without Blame and I think my goodness W you see the power of your calling because you're called there's no sin to your account because you're called there's no addiction that he can remember you see predestination ain't just a Doctrine predestination a reality that God saw me before the foundation of the world that's why I can stand here today blameless I stand blameless because I'm predestinated I stand filled with the Holy Ghost because I'm predestinated oh predestination now many people take it as a crutch and say because I'm predestinated I can do what I want no sir it's because you're predestinated you're wanting to get away from those things hey if you're using predestination as a crutch you've got your Doctrine all messed up and you might not be predestinated but it's because you're predestinated you say Lord I'm not happy here I'm not happy I'm called for another purpose yes sir oh Hallelujah you realize you're called for another purpose you realize it was the prodical son the Bible says he come to himself you ever notice that he came to himself and said my father's servants have a better than what I have it it wasn't somebody coming and saying hey you're a son he knew he was a son all along but it was hidden under the Fallen nature oh come on now it was hidden under his Fallen state but Grace showed up one day grace showed up one day and brought him to himself and he said my goodness this ain't my condition I'm called to be in I'm called for another purpose I'm called for another identity but because of the Fallen State he put his identity on the back burner but because of Grace he said my father my my father's servants have a better than what I've got it and could you imagine that he's rehearsing he's rehearsing his speech he's coming up okay I'm going to tell my father I'm not worthy to be called your son I'm not worthy to be called your son I'm not worthy let me be a Serv let me be a servant and as he has his head down there's the father there's Grace just waiting on him to come back to where he fell from Hallelujah and what happened he come before the father and said father I'm not worthy to be called your son and he said what did the father say my son who was once dead is alive again slay the fatted calf slay the fatty calf grab the ring put it on put it on his put it on his finger it was Grace expressing itself to a fallen son but you notice what what did that what of the prodical son say he didn't say I'm not worthy to be your son he says I'm not worthy to be called your son and that's what condemnation does condemnation says well you might be a son but you're too far in you're too far in sin to be known as a son I know what I'm talking about now I fought condemnation you know my dad always uses the phrase he says it's the devil that talks you in to robbing the bank then he calls the police on you it's the devil that that brings you down into s brings you down in addictions brings you down and says well now you're too far in there but the grace of God remains yes sir come on now the grace of God is still calling your name if you're willing to come to yourself the prodigal son come to himself even though he spent all of his life savings he he brought disgrace to the family name but he realized that predestinated seed Oh Come From the father man you no matter what you have done buddy you might you might have brought disgrace say you went out and backslid you you turn your life upside down that never takes the seed of your father it never takes it away the seed is going to remain and the only way for you to be satisfied is you to realize that I'm a seed of the father oh come on now I'm called to be in the people to to do exploits and that's what the prodical son realized I'm not called to be begging I'm called to rain I'm not called to serve my master I'm called to stand up in authority and have others serving me amen oh Hallelujah and so this people ain't chosen because of a natural bloodline but because of a spiritual bloodline because you look the Pharisees could trace their bloodline all the way back to Abraham but but then Jesus would say you're of your father the devil so it ain't a natural bloodline that God is looking at it's a spiritual bloodline because then you have the Samaritan that was a prostitute she had a pass she she did nothing good to her name but then God could looked at that bloodline and see it might not be a natural bloodline but there's a spiritual bloodline that I'm attracted to that I'm coming for oh Hallelujah the Bible would tell us in Galatians 3:28 there was neither Jew nor Greek there was neither Bond nor free there was neither male nor female for Year all one in Christ Jesus and then be if you be Christ then you're Abraham's seed and hirs according to the promise we're HS so whatever Christ had we have oh we don't got separate Powers but we're life of his life bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life she is him not because I'm a Martin not because Browning but because there's another inheritance there's another family that we belong to that is the family of God the people not a people but the people that know their God oh Hallelujah not a people that know they're God but the people the he's making a claim my people is going to know me they're going to identify me and produce exploits Hallelujah and I believe this is the hour that the people is knowing their God and I heard brother Samuel he was preaching in Uncle Jonathan's I think last year or the year before and he made a profound statement he says we're not living in an hour where promises are being made but we're living in the hour the promises are being fulfilled so we're not living in the hour that God is promising there's a people but we're living in the hour where God is coming in the people we're not looking for Elijah the prophet we've identified Elijah the prophet we're not looking for that for that spotless bride we've identified the Spotless bride I am her I am she oh Hallelujah but you see what is separating the two groups is the people that knows their God and so to know God you got to see God understand God you got to know where he's at if you don't know where he's at you're never going to find him but you see but the Brandon would tell us and so many people have different opinions of Christ and as I travel in different parts of the country and around the world I find that so many people have their different opinions you'll be surprised to know what some of their opinions are some of them thinks he's a wonderful teacher he says well he was that just exactly many thinks he was a great philosopher which he was that certainly he was some of them think he was a good man he was that but see he was more than that and I I love this part he says he was all of that plus he was all of that plus in other words don't be looking at the Garment quit looking at the outside and look what's on the inside oh come on now many people is looking at Malachi 4 and fail to see what he brought come on brother Malachi 4 was to be a man but what he was bringing was Jesus Christ the word many people's looking at a prophet and Fa to see Christ oh Hallelujah but I'm not looking at a prophet I'm looking at the word I'm looking at Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I've identified the word in this generation so that I can perform exploits hey if you want to perform exploits you got to know your God that's right you got to know him you got to identify him and make him your God make this your message this ain't this ain't the preacher's message it's my message this is my inheritance this is my identity this is my life oh Hallelujah you got to identify it as yours it ain't the chickens I don't care about the chickens it's me it's mine it's my identity we all know the story that you have the eagle in the barnyard the chickens could care less they was happy eating the the slap they was happy clucking and walking around but there was predestination there was Grace on the inside of that of that eagle that says my goodness I don't belong here I don't belong here and because of Grace he looked up and because of Grace a scream cried out to him and because of Grace he responded oh Hallelujah brother brandom says it was Eagle to Eagle he come from Mama eagle and since he come from it he couldn't help but identify it then brother brandom says it's word responding to word he says it's word promised and the word word coming together you identifying you've come from the word oh Hallelujah you can't deny this message even if you wanted to it's who you are it's your name it's your purpose it's your identity oh hallelujah it's Grace coming to you and saying you're called for a greater purpose oh you're not meant to be walking in a cycle you're meant to perform exploits amen hallelujah but you got to come up higher hey too many people's happy in the chicken yard come on now many too many people is sitting in a church but they go back to a chicken yard and they're happy there you got to get unsatisfied with where you're at so that you can know your God in order for the chick for the eagle to know mama he had to get up on the post he had to get on the post then after the post he got on the peak of the barn and each step he was taking he was getting higher and farther away from the Barnyard and let me say this you might not perform the supernatural WI way but each step you're getting closer and closer and closer to one day you're sitting in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus hey brother brandom says that's the believer's position is in Heavenly places yes sir so in order for the eager to get in Heavenly places here to start climbing here to climb here to get the justification sanctification the Holy Ghost and you don't got to stop with the Holy Ghost come up a little higher come up a little higher word has come and revealed itself sir oh Hallelujah that that eagle says man I don't belong care I'm called for a higher calling I've got a greater purpose I'm supposed to be eating chickens not eating with the chickens come on now I'm supposed to be eating these guys not walking around with them oh man you know but and the Bible says you're going to judge the ones that have judged you the ones that have spoken against you you're going to be the ones that judge them oh come on you're not supposed to be walking around with them being judged but you're going to be the judge all right hallelujah oh my but we got to stop looking at the Garment and look at the word brother Brandon we continue on to say some of them think he was a prophet he was a prophet but he was more than a prophet he was what a prophet was plus see so what how would we know now if he was a teaching of his teachings he was a teacher he was a great philosopher but the only way we'll ever know him today is to identify him today and I believe he raised from the dead I believe that with all of my heart I believe that he's promised here and he's the same yesterday today and forever amen he says in order to identify him you got to realize he's more than a prophet he was a philosopher but he's a philosopher plus he was a man but he's a man plus and let me say this remember when Nathaniel seen Jesus it wasn't the Garment that Jesus was wearing that revealed to Nathaniel that he was the Messiah cuz we know what happened he performed the Messiah sign and then he realized this is the Messiah not by what he was wearing but what he was bringing yes sir oh come on now too many people is looking at a Ministry trying to identify Christ you never identify Christ in a Ministry come on now you can't identify Christ in a gift you got to identify Christ in the word come on now it wasn't the Garment that Jesus was wearing and too many people is looking at the garments of ministry garments of preachers garments of gifted men trying to see the world trying to see God and God said no it's not the garments it's the word get your eyes off of a man and say the word get your eyes off of a Ministry and see the word know me so that you can do exploits you're called for this you're chosen for this just identify me recognize me oh Hallelujah so identifying him is to recognize not on pages but in a body you see brother the Brandon would say but but what would identify him would be the identification that the scripture says he would be in and that's how we have to identify him that's that that's the way he was identified then and this is where this is where B was pulling the Garment from because he wasn't any spectacular man in a certain array of dresss he had no organization that he boasted from he had no credentials from any certain Fellowship that he could say I belong to the biggest see he had only the works of God that was proven and spoken of that would identify him that was his credentials it wasn't the dress that was the credentials it was the word oh my and makes some people mad it don't matter if it's your favorite preacher behind the desk if it's the word coming forth that's the credentials too many people think we can't see the supernatural if so and so ain't preaching if we're not at a convention if we're not at a youth camp we're not going to see the supernatural it don't matter who's preaching as long as it's the credentials as long as it's the word we can see God Mighty in action on a Thursday night on a Sunday morning it don't matter who's in the dress just look for the word oh hallelujah look for the word because hope this is okay I'm I'm going to take a little bit of Liberty here brother Brandon preaches a message at the voice of God in the last day and it's a powerful message he goes through many many voices he says there's a a voice of politics he says the voice of Hollywood and he says those voices have more influences than the voice of God does has a strong pul than the voice of God and then he comes to a a voice of a spouse he talks about Adam and Eve then he talks about communism but then he comes down and talks about a church voice and you know and and I was as I was listening to that sermon and I was thinking my how could that apply to a message church and I'm just going to take some Liberty here because you can look up the denominational churches they've got their voices they've got their influences and I was thinking how could that come into a church and something just struck me and I I remember as a as a teenager I never thought God did anything for me because I never went out to the world I'm sure you guys can testify I was raised on a church pew I sat on the front row every service I never went out to the world I never drank I've never smoked I I've never cussed I've never did any of those things and I remember thinking as a as a as a child that man God never did anything for me and I remember one service sitting on the front row we had a preacher come through and he says you know many people think many young people think since they never went out into the world they've never drank they've never smoked they never did these things that God never did anything for him and I'm sat there on the front row thinking whoa that's me who told him and he says not to take away from these other testimonies but you've got a greater testimony cuz you're in the midst of Satan's Eden and yet you're not the fou and I was thinking on that and that struck me it was a church voice getting me to look at other others testimonies and denying the testimony that God has given me oh come on now cuz the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence we can be sitting here with the powerful testimony I've never drank I've never smoked I've never cussed I've never did these things and here the devil's whispering to me with the church voice saying look at so and so this one was delivered from drugs that one was delivered from smoking and man God's never did anything for you that's a church voice that tries to attract your attention away from the supernatural oh come on now then that that moves on from just a an individual to a body and now we're thinking man if we're not in a convention God's not going to move if we're not in a special meeting God's not going to move it's a church voice trying to attract your attention away from the Supernatural and I say the gift don't bring the supernatural the word brings the supernatural I said Lord I'm not listening to the voices that the devil is bringing I'm listening to One voice that's the word and what is so incredible about the sermon where the brandom goes through all of these voices then at the end of it he says but my sheep know my voice there's all of these voices that is plaguing homes plaguing minds but my sheep ain't attracted to those voices they're attracted to the voice the words oh Hallelujah so don't let us get so attracted to a to a garment that we don't see the word amen so then brother Brandon would say this the scripture is what testifies of him so that's what identified him was the scripture you believe that that's what we'll have to identify him today then we will know whether we're right or not whether it was him he was the same he will do the same and then that that struck me as as I was reading this brother Samuel because once a Believer finds out that he's right there's such a confidence you know how many's ever been in in an argument and you just think that you're right you know that you're right you know it so you're proving your point proving your point and then the other person pulls out their phone Googles it and you're wrong and then you're like oh man you just lose all of your confidence then you're second guessing everything you believe in cuz you're like man cuz I I I thought I was right and that's why brother Brandon saying once you identify him then you know whether you're right or if you're wrong amen there's a courage that comes inside of a Believer once he identifies that what I believe ain't my word it's his word oh come on now once a once a young lady realizes that wearing a long dress and long hair ain't she it ain't trying to be be somebody good or special it's a covenant that God has with you yes sir it's what God has commissioned you to do and put Authority behind it you know you you you can look at David when David come to his brothers at the battlefield there was on man of David weren't they not say man you just come to to be a spectator you just come to do this and to do that but in reality the father sent him he didn't come by his own free will his father sent him remember Joseph the brothers of Joseph was mad at him because the father sent him come on they wasn't doing it by their own free will the father sent him and let the world get maded at you sisters let the world say you're a goody tisue you're this you're that you're not doing it on your own free will the father has told you to do it and I say young people let's get some courage young adults let's get some courage I've identified the word for this day it's not my word it's God's word I'm not backing up this message God is backing up this message oh come on now God the father has sent this in this generation to do exploits Joseph didn't sent himself the father sent him and could you imagine being Joseph the Father the brothers are mad at him Brothers the father sent me I did I didn't give me this garment the father gave it to me I didn't give me myself this Grace the father gave me this Grace oh Hallelujah and he's robed Us in his word in this generation he's poured out his grace upon us let them be jealous it's not our fault God called us to this oh Hallelujah but there's such a confidence that the father has sent us and I'm going to I'm going to tell on myself now hope this is okay and you know and I remember being a young preacher and believing things in this message you know and I and I believe that uh the the mighty Angel come to the Earth to the Earthly Angel and give an open book you know I've always believed that but to be be honest I never could find a quote for it and and it's Give me liberty here I never could find a quote I've looked and I looked and you know because I never could find a quote for it I would get nervous around guys that didn't believe that I would get skittish because man I've got nothing backing me up you know and then brother Wayne he was talking about how he was preaching for a minister one time and somebody challenged him on it and he quoted a quote that brother brandom said about that and I thought whoa there's a quote for that and it was great hearing him talk about the quote but once he sent me the quote and I read it for myself it was a whole different story and this is what brother brandom says in the breach between the seven Church ages and the seals he says talk about a jubilee talk about a time when the lamb walked forth he says see the book's even sealed in heaven the Mysteries are say is my name there I don't know I hope it is but if it is it was put there before the foundation of the world and then he says but the first thing that represented the Redemption come the lamb and that the lamb that had been slain before the foundation of the world and this and this is the part right here and he took the book Glory opened the book tore off the seals sent it down to the Earth to a seventh angel to reveal it to his people and he says there you are and I'm telling you brother there is a liberty that come over me that it ain't just my opinion it's God's word and let me say this once you identify by the word for this generation there's the faith the pulsates there's a pulsation of faith that the Rapture ain't my word it's God's word the body change ain't my word it's God's word Grace ain't M it ain't me coming up with Grace it's God's grace yes sir once you identify it there's a courage because what the devil wants you to do is Venture without Authority and that's what I was doing all all those times was I had no Authority and even even though I knew it was right I had no Authority behind it and brother Brandon preaches a message to presume and he says presume is to venture without Authority and he says in the time and the hour we're living in if a person don't know which way to go or what to do how to turn you're not walking by faith anymore he says you're just guessing you're presuming and purum is to advance with without official Authority so if we haven't got the real official authority to know what God Said with take place in this hour how are we ever going to face this hour he says how are we ever going to face it if we're just presuming Oh my he continues on to say and we've got to face that knowing by faith in his word that the things that are supposed to happen now and the conditions of the Nations the condition of the people condition of the church and so forth we've got to know that and then how to walk out and to face it if you don't know how to do that uh you're you're just what we used to call uh just jump just jumping in hoping it will be there hoping this hoping that what will it be but God wants us not to do that he wants us to know he wants us to know and so that's why we've got to identify it we got to identify without identifying brother brandom says we're just jumping into it blindly but once we're we put the pursuing aside we identify it then there's Authority we're walking no KN what's happening out there you know you know you know what I'm talking about I'm a sort of I'm an honory fell you can ask my wife and and I I sometimes I like pranking people you know and it's always aggravating as a prankster whenever you're standing behind the door waiting to jump out and scare somebody and as you're waiting there for 10 minutes 15 minutes you're waiting for just an innocent person to walk an innocent bystander just to walk by and then some smart Alex says hey Josh's behind the door then you're like come on man I've been waiting all this time you still try to scare him but now they're not walking blindly anymore but they know you're there then I can jump out and say ra better don't scare them because they know what's happening oh come on now and that's what brother Brandon is saying we got to know what we're walking with we know the devil's blueprint we know the devil's tactics we got to know with the Revelation not presuming that it's the devil's Playbook but no it's the devil's Playbook oh then we're walking now the devil can pull out Temptation we said not today devil no not today he can bring discouragement not today he can bring up he can bring up doubts not today he can bring up all of these critics and naysayers and we say not today I've identified it I know before the coming of the Lord there's a perilous times I know there's many going to fall away that's just the sign of the end time I know what's taking place and man then there's a courage man there's a courage no and I might not know what's happening tomorrow but I Know Who Holds my tomorrow we're no longer walking blindly but we're walking with courage praise the Lord you know I I I I hope this is going to be okay you anybody know know of Mark Lowry the comedian the singer you know and I remember hearing a story he told one time he says man I survived the tornado and I thought my pick my interest because we're we're in Tornado Alley Oklahoma and he says you know I got me I got out me a house boat and I was on I was on this Lake and Tornado Alley and man there come a tornado he says the boat went rocking back and forth back and forth and he says after the tornado I was scared to death he says I come crawling out of my house boat all the boats are on their sides they're they're flipped over and he says there are some guys there on the dock that says whoopy we survived another one and he thought what's wrong with these guys he walked up to him and says guys why y'all so happy he says You must be new here says this is tornado H this is Tornado Alley this happens all the time and he makes a statement he says if I knew I was going to survive I would have had a good time too he didn't know if he was going to survive or not but the other ones knew they was going to survive and since they knew they had joy in the midst of the trial and little church we know we're in we're going to reign as kings we're going to March over the ashes of the wicked we can have joy in the midst of the trial we can have joy in the midst of the suffering knowing that our future is in concrete there's nothing the devil can do to keep us from our expected end he hasn't given us an unexpected end we have an expected end we know what's going to happen at the end of the book yes sir come on I know my thoughts towards you thoughts of Peace not not of evil but of good and to give you an expected end we know what's we know what to expect we know there's a rapture we know there's a mar supper of the Lamb if we didn't know those things man where would our courage be but we've identified it and says this people this people ain't somebody down the road it's me yes sir I'm a part of that people hallelujah the brother brandom says this in presuming he says it's written over in St John I think about the 15th chapter if you abide in me my word abide in you see the word abides see then ask what you will and it'll be done because it's not you it's the word that's in you and the word is God see God in you God is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us now when the return of the Holy Spirit bringing the word in us and it abiding in there it's not you that speaks it's the word itself coming out so it is the word that will perform the work oh Hallelujah and that's in Pursuit in he says once you not you're no longer pursuing and let the word abide and then it's not not you speaking the word it's not you performing the work is the word and I thought my you know you and I was as I was thinking on these things I I I'm imagine I have a big imagination you know so I as I work and things I just I my mind just thinks you know and I was thinking on this and I thought and I thought of me and my wife I thought before me and my wife was married she had a full-time job she had to pay for her own own clothes she had to pay for her own food she had have pay for her own car she was under her own authority she was her own absolute but once she come under my authority I become her absolute then it was her no longer working for herself but now it was my job to provide and I thought my goodness too many people have a problem with the word being the absolute because it's the final say but they fail to see that the final say is also the ti poost yes sir come on now if if you let it be your final sa then it becomes your ti poost then it's no longer you trying to be good enough but you're under the authority of the word it's the word's responsibility oh hallelujah it's not you performing The Works it's the word in you coming out and performing The Works and so now it's not my wife having a job I got to work you know I ain't got to work I I'm the one making sure she has food I'm the one making making sure she's clothed I'm the one making sure she's got a nice van I'm the one making sure that has an all change it's not her it's me she's come under my headship oh man if you could ever come under the headship of the word you you look up you look in Exodus it wasn't Joshua and Caleb trying to make sure they had shoes on their feet right it wasn't Joshua and Caleb bringing Mana Out of Heaven it wasn't Joshua and Caleb bringing water out of the out of the rock it was them following the word then it was the word bringing Mana Out of Heaven it was the word bringing water out of the rock come on now it's not you trying to bring forth the peace it's not you trying to bring forth the hope it's the word coming on the inside bringing a a a hope a joy full of full of Glory you're you're marching over everything because it's no longer you it's the word and what what what is so incredible about the story I hope this is okay this evening you look at Joshua and Caleb Caleb Gets all the way to the promised land right he gets to the promised land and what did he say what did he say we're more than able to take the land that is Flowing with milk and honey where did he get the milk and honey from did you ever think about that Moses where did Moses get them milk and honey from God so you notice that Caleb's voice become the same as Moses voice sir Caleb's understanding become the same as Moses understanding what's the say the the spirit and the bride say come it's that they've come under the the same word they've got the same Authority and you notice what God says about Caleb Cale God says because Caleb has followed me fully who did Caleb follow Moses come on now I'm going say the man the word he followed the word and the word brought him through the Wilderness the word brought him through all the Skeptics the word brought him through the Red Sea and now you notice the Bible says and because Caleb hath followed me fully his seed shall possess the land and that distruct me as a father you know our our children have to have their own experience but now the same Grace I have is the same Grace they can experience now it's no longer saying Lord please keep my children it's Lord I've honored your word you're not going to give me Serpent seed and that's what Dad has always spoke over us as boys he says Lord you never you haven't given me Serpent seed every one of my children are part of your seed Caleb is in drugs Caleb is in a gang Caleb was was out partying but D always say Lord you haven't given me Serpent seed and because Caleb in the Bible followed the Lord fully followed me fully his seed possessed the land oh I said parents let's get some courage about us and not follow this half-heartedly but let's let us follow it fly so there can be exploits I want to be exploits the brother brother brother ROM preaches uh the exploits of Faith he says it's a natural people with the supernatural God coming in the natural people help performing Supernatural signs that's what I want to be I don't want to be a dead church member I want to have the life of God Amen oh the brother Brandon would say this about David and give me a few more minutes I'll bring this down to a close he says and Little David standing there with a little piece of leather goat skin sheep skin with two pieces of string tied to it but it was revealed to him Revelation struck him amen he said the god that took me out of the PS of the bear that took me out of the paws of the lion how much more will he deliver the uncircumcised Philistine into my hand and he says he was standing there with Revelation and this just struck me like I said I'm constantly thinking what was the Revelation that struck him the god that kept me but during the bear attack yesterday is the same God keeping me today and that's what Revelation does the same God of yesterday is the god of today the same God in the book of Acts is the same God today the same God that walked on the shores of Galilee is the same God walking today but you got to identify him and brother Brandon and I love how brother Brandon puts this he says how much more will he deliver that uncircumcised Philistine into my hand he says his brothers was more able to do it Saw Head and Shoulders above his army but you see it wasn't revealed to them oh it wasn't revealed to them you might not be the be the sharpest knife in the cabinet but it's revealed to you you might say that one's smarter than I am that one's got more money that one's got a nicer house that's got better cars but it's not revealed to them it's revealed to you oh God don't look on the outward he looks at the heart he looks at the seed oh Hallelujah and he continues on to say Amen there it is they believe and this is just so profound he says they believed it could be done they he's talking about David's Brothers they belied they could be done they belied God could do it but it wasn't revealed to them and that D struck me brother Samuel they knew God could do it but they was afraid that God can do it in them you ever catch that there they knew God could do it but they didn't have a revelation that God can do it in here oh my don't ever let us get to that point where we believe God can heal the sick but can he heal me we believe that God can keep children but can he keep my children well I believe that God that there's there's the bride making a Rapture but can I make the Rapture what separated David from his brothers was it's me it's me and what did Brother brandham say your your your confession should be if there's only one making the Rapture it's me oh that's what Revelation does that's what identifying the word does this might you might not believe it but I believe it it's me and he says but it wasn't revealed to them but it was revealed to David see there's the difference right there if it's absolutely revealed to you that God is going to heal you you're going to get it you're going to get it I don't care what's wrong with you what the odds may be may be worse than David and Goliath but if it's revealed to you and I say Amen it's revealed to me the odds of me being good enough to be spotless is slim but I believe it's going to happen sir hey I might not feel I by mistakes I have blunders I I a past but because of Grace we stand before him blameless hlj we stand before him blameless give me a few more minutes you see recognizing God brings him out of yesterday into today I know this is simple but you remember the two that walked the road to emus we all know the story we've heard of that growing up as a kid and it just struck me as I was listening to that and reading it that these two men were walking down the road talking about Jesus right man we thought he was the Messiah we thought he was the deliverer then you notice what happens Jesus appears walks up to the ones that are talking about him and they couldn't see him and something just struck me brother Samuel how come they couldn't see him because they were putting Jesus in yesterday without bringing him into today they couldn't see him oh man I think that's what D Daniel is talking about a people that know their God the people that know their God recognize their God not a god of yesterday but they know him as a god of today they've identified him that's the people that's going to do exploits hey the church the church World they they know him in a forum and a ritual they know him of yesterday but my people's going to know him of today they going to know me today oh Hallelujah they're going to know me as a God that keeps marriages together today they going to know me as a as a way maker today but bring split homes together today not of yesterday but today they know me and they're doing exploits but brother Brandon would say that Jesus was standing right in front of him picked up the scripture and was going through all of the scriptures concerning Kim and brother Brandon makes a statement he says preaching the word won't bring Revelation you got to receive it and you know what the Bible says he walks with them it was in the evening time and he acted as if he was going to walk by them and they the Bible says they constrained him said come in with us and brother brandom says right there they received the word oh there's a difference there's a difference in looking at the word and receiving the word there has to come a time we receive it yes sir now there's many people that don't like this the only way to receive this word is to receive it as your absolute that's right the only way to look at this message is to look as the final say then once you receive it as the final say you see it as God revealed today yes sir hallelujah it's not a god of yesterday it's a god of today that's right then how what opened their eyes the Bible says as he broke the bread their eyes was open what did they see then receiving the word open their eyes that the same way he broke the bread yesterday he's breaking the bread today oh man identifying recognizing him brought it to a present tense God oh and recognizing the Lord today brings it to a present tense god brother brandham talks about let the musicians come brother brandham talks about the Mary Magdalene he says as he W as she was walking by Simon's house she seen Jesus and brother brandom he says this here she saw it and recognized his presence and what did it do it washed what did it release to her forgiveness release to her forgiveness of her sins did you did you catch that brother brandom says her recognizing Jesus released to her her forgiveness oh my I don't know what you have need of tonight but just recogniz him maybe you need a renewing in your body maybe you need a refilling of the Holy Ghost recognizing him releases to you what you have the most important desire in your heart it releases to you but you notice you notice that Simon was Simon invited him in and this really just spoke to my heart that Simon invited him in but failed to recognize him and oh man we can invite him to church with us we can invite him in our homes but if we fail to recognize him oh don't let us come to church saying Lord come among us but when he comes we say oh man the song Leader's too long oh man the preacher's too hard oh man that's not what I want to hear this service you invite him in but fail to entertain him that's right oh Hallelujah but let's invite him in then recognize him because recognizing him releases the authority of God brother Brandon would say overcome means to rec recognized he said overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks a lot of people say there's no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil he's just as real as you are anybody a real devil you must recognize him as real you must know he's a devil the same time you recognize him know that he's a devil and he's against you he's against you and and let me close on this point but the brandom says you don't just recognize he's a devil you got to recognize he's against you and that's what many people fail to do is recognize that the spirit of backbiting is against them the spirit of a critical that critical spirit is against them because what happens if you don't recognize it it moves on to justifying and the definition of justifying actions is to prove or show that it's reasonable or necessary oh don't let me be that way don't let you be that way what we felt recognize that a critical spirit is of the devil then we start justifying him preacher you don't know what I've been through you don't know what happened here this what I'm I might be bitter but I'm rightly so because this one didn't me wrong let's recognize it let's recognize you can't brother brandom says overcoming he continues on to say and then to overcome he you got to know he's a devil he's against you then to overcome recognize him know he's a devil you must recognize that God in you is greater and mightier than he is then the one that is in you has already overcome him and by his grace oh I just love that by his grace you're more than more than a match for him amen real overcoming when you recognize so we don't just got to recognize God but we got to recognize the enemies after us let's bow our heads tonight dear heavenly father father Lord there's a sweet spirit in the building tonight father Lord we're not just recognizing and identifying the word for this generation but we're identifying the tactics of the enemy Lord maybe there's somebody here that are struggling with bitterness Lord may they identify it so that they can overcome Lord may they identify it not justify it but identify it Lord as we're searching our hearts tonight if there's anything that is not of you Lord maybe recognize it and say Lord I'm not happy with it I don't want that in my life I don't want that in my home I don't want that in my spirit I don't want that among my children but I want I want exploits I want exploits in my family's life I want exploits in my SP my spouse but Lord if it takes recognizing the spirits of the enemy Lord may we recognize it we ask these things in your pray precious name amen Jesus overcoming is the recognize the other day I was I was studying on these things and I was in my house and I was studying then Ethan my little boy he had some rain boots and he was right there beside beside where I was studying he was crying he had his shoes on the wrong feet and he was trying to he was stomping his feet crying and I looked at him I said Ethan your shoes on the wrong feet want me to help you no no no it's okay I'm watching he's crying he's trying as hardest to put this his shoe on his boot but it was never going to work because he couldn't recognize he was doing it the wrong way and something just spoke to me and many time we're trying to get Victory but fail to recognize we can't overcome because we're entertaining bitterness we can't overcome because we're entertaining backbiting we're justifying this we're justifying that and we're trying to cram victory in her life and God is saying you're doing it wrong recognize it you're doing it wrong let me help you but Ethan could have recognized he was doing it wrong if he could have just recognized I was a helping hand that can help him and oh man maybe you've been trying to get the victory just recognize look into your heart maybe you've allowed Spirits into your home maybe that's the reason why you haven't seen your house on fire you want to see your homes on fire maybe we need to recognize some Spirits you want to see rebellious children come home maybe we've let some Spirits in I was working on my house the other day I was doing some tile and I don't know if anybody's ever done to before but it's very aggravating you do the grout and you take a sponge and you get a wet sponge and you're you're you're cleaning up all the grout you dip in a buckle of water you clean up the grout and I did my tole over and over and over and it was still dirty and I thought I was getting aggravated and something hit me like I said my mind's always going I was dumping out the bucket of water and it was dirty and I thought my it wasn't the sponge's fault it was the environment that he was in and I thought my sometimes it ain't the children's fault that they're rebellious and they they're born with a carnal nature but sometimes it's the environment we put them in maybe our home lives but I had to recognize in order for that sponge to get clean and clean other things are to empty out the environment and maybe we need to recognize that our environment's dirty you want to see children doing exploits maybe we need to recognize that our environment's dirty can you sing a song brother how could he desire Hallelujah to have fellowship with me there must be something more within that only he can see I pray dear Lord take all my life I give it all to thee grant that every day Hallelujah you commune with me Hallelujah [Music] pictures and photographs memories of can you just Search Your Heart Tonight stories of have you been entertaining things that have never youve been justifying Spirits tonight's tonight the Lord's walking Among Us my the Lord's walking in the place the supper SE oh Lord help us not to just a picture that let us identify to do exploits until now I never we stand and SE this as we turn it to our pastor and how can he desire to have fellowship with me there must be something more within that only he can see and I pray you Lord take all my life I give it all to thee Oh grant that every day Lord you commune with me on the road to eus three men walk that way oh yes as they reach their destination two men ask the third to stay oh yes Lord and as they talk together breaking bread and pouring wine I finally now realize the Simplicity of his sight tell me how can he desire to have fellowship with me there must be something more within that only he can see I pray dear Lord take all my life I give it all to thee oh oh grant that every day you'll commune with me Lord grant that day you commune with [Music] me amen wasn't that wonderful am amen a word for today amen a word for this moment I love how the Lord took and brought so many different examples down to show us and minister to us so many things to show us that the real Simplicity of the Gospel it's God wanting just to be preeminent present in every part of our life in every phase of our life it's always inviting him into today and I I think of that simple simple part of recognizing him brother Josh when he mentioned that that when they were walking before they ever got in to that little room with them what started it was they invited him and when you invite him he's the only one that can turn situations that look hopeless Darkness to light he's the only one that can take things that you or I could try to solve out in our mind and we'll never be able to do it in our mind on our own amen but you just invite him he's the same one that turned the water into wine he's the same one that brought the bread the man in the wilderness he's the same God who brought the water out of the rock it's just that simple to believe God for what he has said I was reading a little something today and it struck me I was it was in my devotion and then I went back to it afterwards it's just the simple part about obedience and when God had told Israel there will not be any Mana fall on the seventh day but on the sixth day there'll be a double portion so don't go out on the seventh and expect to find any because God drops on the sixth enough to carry us through the seventh clear to the first day but the Bible says there were some who went out on the seventh day and the Very things that God said is how long will this people refuse my Commandments you notice how the spirit of the Lord turned right around here even at the end of it just dealing with that of the part of just responding and taking the word of God in it just goes to show us it's simple obedience and just simply obeying just taking God at his word don't try to figure it out that was said tonight over and over just take God at his word that's what faith brother Joshua was preaching that it's faith we accept these things by faith it's not because we know it it's not because well I've proved it with this scripture I see this scripture this scripture this scripture this scripture that you could know all of that and still not accept it by faith but to accept it by faith is because he said so and I know him that God is not a man that he should lie I know every promise that God has said I that's a place of certainty you know there's no other place in this world that you can have that kind of certainty there's no word of any politician no word of any boss I'm not saying there's not good bosses but you can't have that kind of certainty because somebody above that boss can come around and say hey sorry we got to do this we got to change this around and immediately a guy that might have been your buddy or your friend or somebody you had a lot of confidence in you realize there's a higher word than them but there's no higher word no higher authority than God himself and that's what this message has unfolded to you and I it has revealed the Living God of his word that we can have a confidence no matter what situation no matter what the need is he's still the almighty God and it just starts with just inviting him in just invite him in just invite him take the situation whatever the need is in your life invite God in even the bucket of water that brother Joshua was talking about invite God in because he's the one that can tell you hey get that dirty water out of here you know you can I said this to you many times my dad you remember many times my dad in the last years that he was with us I would walk we had a door between our offices I would walk over to his office and you know my dad he was sitting there and he said he was sick he was sick and I said Dad what's wrong he said Sam he said I'm just I'm sick I said well let's pray we would pray and it may not have been right then but it might have been after I was out here ministering a little bit and you remember how he would come and sit down sometimes he'd come sit down up front right here God would lift what was going on and touch him but it kept on happening over and over again and you know what it was it was a certain medication he was taking that was making him sick now God kept on touching him God kept on moving for him but eventually we had to get down to figure out what's the cause of it and I'm glad that we have a god a living God Among Us that not only lifts lifts our cares when we're in the presence of God but he can go down and say you're giving too much time here you're neglecting here we need to we need to get the dirty water out I'm glad all it starts with is just inviting him I I don't know but no about you but I want to invite him I always want to invite him I want this word that I've heard I want to take it and let it work in my life invite God into today today today you love him amen hallelujah go ahead lead us in another song There by his

that has come by our way you know when you when really when you hear the message and you're hearing what God is saying it brings rest to your life yes it brings a rest because you recognize it's not my work I'm not his work when you can recognize that it's God's work it's the sovereignty of God even the prophet said our experiences are not schooled into us but they are predestinated from the hand of God that brings a rest to realize the word that has sought us out will bring us to the appointed moment it'll be it'll have have everything right there on time even to when God listen even when God
