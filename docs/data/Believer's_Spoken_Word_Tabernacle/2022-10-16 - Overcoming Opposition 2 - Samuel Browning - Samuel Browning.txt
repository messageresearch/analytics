Christ [Music] Lord this is our desire and it's our longing Lord stay Lord in your presence [Music] oh God realize the Lord that it's just not confined to a building but your desire Lord as you expressed that you would desire to walk in a spot to live Lord so completely in our lives just like Isaiah when he went into the temple that day though he was a prophet all along but that day there came a change in his life there came an influence oh God from another Realm the Living God made himself known in that moment Isaiah stood with discouragement he had saw failure before him but God there was something within him and that is part of yourself that he made his way to the temple if there was going to be an answer that would come his way it would have to come from God and you directed him Lord to that place and he saw you in a way they never saw you before it affected his life like never before and it brought forth a confession a repentance whoa is me for I am undone I'm a man of unclean lips but God wants the confession came here came a seraphin one that ministers the lord of the offering a higher order it took not just any coal but alive cold oh God placing it upon the lips of the prophet God you brought a cleansing in his life just a moment in your presence then he could rise with the confidence when the voice would speak who will go for me oh God what a confidence comes a good courage comes from confession cleansing then commissioning oh God that's your order that's your order that's your order to redeem your children that's your order Lord that your word would go forth Lord in our lives we stand here this morning Lord God that full awareness your desire is to walk in US Lord not just to be the presence that we sense here in this moment that we have set aside on a Sunday and on a Thursday your desire is to so live in the midst of our life oh God Amen to shake the uppermost seat in our life to be the sole influence of our life that our life oh God would be the word of God wrapped and made flesh Granite Lord may this once again this morning be a moment Lord we make a trip to the temple may it be for hearts and lives right here this morning may you come Lord and minister physical and spiritual needs alike I'm asking God that you'll take control in this service Lord and everything be glorified oh Lord change lives and hearts Lord move Among Us Lord we we didn't come here to be seen we want you to move Lord we're inviting you to move Lord to move in our lives Lord God that the Holy Spirit would have the right of way here this morning Lord in our lives oh God not in my neighbor but in my life in my life granted the Lord we pray yeah we ask these things Lord for every need in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen may God bless you if you don't mind what you have your seats just for a moment three years Brothers of Paul if you'd come and Benjamin or Benjamin and Paul whoever wants to go first from the testimonies from the men's mini isn't it just a wonderful presence of the Lord here man I'm just so thankful that he he comes a manner it's just he comes you know and when he comes he comes to move he comes to work he comes to minister to our lives don't you love him all everything every song that's been sung everything is all with the preparation even for these moments right now of what God is going to do you believe God's going to do things here this morning I believe that I believe that amen that's why we've gathered here we're expecting that Brothers if you'll come just briefly here I don't know just take the wireless mic if you don't mind God bless you all uh I just wanted to mention really quick um about the men's meeting it was a real blessing for me um a lot of you know the brothers a lot um I think all of them anyway I think all of them can agree that uh it was a good experience uh really good teaching um but I think sometimes a lot of people maybe can think that you know you know maybe you don't need it or maybe it's not you know if it's like extra outside of like your own home church but sometimes it takes those extra meetings sometimes that can make a difference and there's different perspectives you can get too from different ministers like my brother Tim Dodd was preaching on the infinite there's different there's different angles that he brought out of who God is and when you see it it's like whoa you know because it's the simple stuff because like growing up the message it's always the simple stuff that blows over your head and you you're like oh really like that's how it works though you know but it's amazing I just thank the Lord that he was able to show some things to me in the men's meeting and just help help me my journey things that I'll have with me you know Lord willing for the rest of the way so I just you know I wish you all would show up Amanda the sisters can't but I wish you always I wish those who could would show up you know um it'd be a real blessing for you and uh I just love you all God bless you and uh well I'll tell you what I can agree with Benjamin and many different others that win it just uh was just a real blessing to be there and for myself I was edified by it and I was just I was really blessed and for me I think the whole time I think before I went there I just I was an expectation you know just to hear from God you know just to receive some from the Lord and really that's what we all had that's really what our desire was is that we wanted to hear from the Lord and for me like what he was mentioning there with uh with brother Tim Don when he uh spoke on the infinite God of and it just it's just it was just such a powerful message you know I mean it was just like it was in one of those morning sessions you know it was like sessions that were I mean there was all day I mean Saturday it was like every day you know like the whole day it was just sessions after session but I I just but the amazing thing about it was we weren't tired you know we weren't tired and we were just like cleaning into strong strength and uh it just it was just really good and everything and he uh brother Tim when he was dealing with the infinite God of how that there's being that God is infinite that there's nothing too big for God it was not too small for a guy and that just that spoke to me that spoke to me that he knows you know from our end to our beginning or beginning to our end you know and that he knows he even knows like he even mentioned he gave an example of how that for even a flea that even knows um how like how a fleeve and bats its eye and of course we all know how a small flea is you know a pretty small little guy you know he's able he's able to like you know uh watch him as he pass his eyes and that's how much to think that that God that knows that that Creator cares about you and he wants a relationship with you and that's just oh that's so wonderful it's just so powerful and I just was really blessed and of course you know when you're down south um you know they'll come up with phrases they'll call you buddy and different things I don't know him from Adam you know but I'm like well that's okay I guess I guess I mean whenever you call me buddy or whatever but I guess I'm your buddy today or whatever but anyway it was uh it was just we just had a real good time it's a real good fellowship and uh just really enjoyed the word and and also you know just like to encourage uh just each and every brother to make it down there it's it's definitely worth the trip it's it's it's worth the eight hours for sure I promise you even you know you can sleep all the way if you want that don't matter just don't just don't be sleeping while you're driving anyway uh yeah but it was just all good and I just want to give God glory that Amanda I received something from the Lord that that week and amen so amen God bless you [Applause] I had to write all my stuff down because I can't remember it the young guys yeah my young buddy over here so uh just a little scripture to part of a scripture to start out with is uh the beginning of Proverbs 1 8 says my son hear the instruction of thy father to me uh that's that's what these men's meetings are it's it's not it's not really a men's meeting it's more like the Holy Spirit just pulling you close you know and sitting down right beside you putting his arm around you and and just uh giving you it's like a private interview with him uh in my opinion so um I wanted to you know all the services were so good I just I wanted to get up and give a little sampler like of of each service but uh it'd be like standing at the Grand Canyon you know and like taking a picture and then showing you the picture just it just doesn't do it justice you know but uh uh brother Samuel last year actually spoke on uh being intentional and I saw you know during during these meetings that it was actually the holy spirit that that was actually very direct uh it was very intentionally um during these meetings and brother Berry actually made a couple of statements um he opened the the first service uh right before he opened in prayer he gave these instructions on kind of how to pray for the services and he says this statement said take your need to the Lord and don't pray in general pray specific and ask God for things that are very real in your life and that just echoed I think just kind of from the previous you know just be intentional and I think these men's meetings are a chance to just be very intentional very specific uh with God and each service was unique uh and direct and in its own way and and I honestly think every uh single person in a tendency I mean from the ministers on down to I believe every brother was ministered to uh directly at one point another I I just can't imagine anybody even was able to leave that type of atmosphere without their life being uh untouched the the ministry team is just absolutely phenomenal and uh I I honestly left with a deeper respect how God can take um you know different preachers from all different areas and different age groups even different races different backgrounds and just have them speak something unique but also speak in unison and that just really came out in these meetings and each sermon was powerful to me but kind of in my humble opinion I I feel our pastor just preached an outstanding message to me and uh and it wasn't just because like it was brother Samuel but I watched like the Holy Spirit just take that instrument in his hand and just strike the bow and just played a song or a sermon that was just absolutely beautiful and I in my opinion after the sermon the Holy Spirit was just so real and in the room and just so sweet and soft and uh brother Barry came up again after after that sermon um and we sing a couple of songs but he still was kind of almost at a loss for words just because the presence was at Sweden he ended that service with this statement my he said you just think it can't get any better you think that God can't get any more personal you think God can't get any closer you think God can't dig any deeper and then he does he just knows how he's the great physician so I thought that that statement just kind of encapsulated the men's meetings what it's all about I mean just when you you know you just think that he had already done all he could do and then he just gets a little more personal a little more deeper he just digs a little farther and he just knows how to do that and it just goes back my son hear the instruction of thy fathers so I'd like to to take just the last few moments and actually uh Echo um brother Paul what he said about the expectations and I felt just a great expectation going into the meetings I mean uh brother Steve and I talked about that for weeks ahead the days prior and I'd heard brothers from other assemblies just talking how they just just felt that you know God was going to move in just a a special way uh and just do something very special in the meetings and so that our expectations going into the men's media I think for for many of the brothers were was just at a high even going into the meeting but uh one thing caught my attention almost immediately and there was someone else with the even greater expectations for these meetings than we had and that was the Lord Jesus Christ and brother Samuel kind of alluded it to alluded to it uh I don't know what time he arrived but the Lord God was already in brother Samuel driveway before we even started to gather he ushered us into our vehicles and he personally escorted us down to the meetings where he guided our fellowship all the way down in fact I mean I would estimate probably at least 75 percent of the things we talked about in the car and on the way down was brought out in the meetings at one point of another I mean so the Lord was just ministering you know directly to us uh just the whole time and he brewed it over us on the way home kind of kind of like a tidal wave the the sermons and such was kind of like the waves crashing ashore and then on the way home you know he's seen the tidal wave how it just keeps going Inland and it just keeps flowing and flowing and that's that's what it was for us on on the right home it was just the Holy Spirit uh just brooding over our lives and and then it just uh during the conversation on the way home it just it just became very real to me that this was more than a men's meeting this had been a Divine appointment with God Almighty there's just nothing less of that so if the Lord would tarry for for another men's meeting I would highly encourage all the brothers who have the ability to go to the men's meeting to go and as men just take the chance to have a Divine appointment with the Lord Jesus Christ and have this chance to become be intentional and deliberate and specific and personal with him he'll be delighted to have you and he will make you feel welcome amen God bless you [Applause] let's go to Zechariah Chapter 4. back there this morning I think there was also a mention about the fire put the fire pit Fellowship here at uh 5 p.m this evening I just certainly looking forward to that you read an announcement about that video okay well chairs firewood Zechariah Chapter 4 and verse 1. I know we read these scriptures last week but we just really hardly didn't get too far at all and just upon the thought of it and I I want to speak continue on that thought to see where the Lord allow us to get to on overcoming opposition overcoming opposition verse 1 says and the angel that talked with me came again and wake me as a man that is awakened out of his sleep and said unto me what seeth thou and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold with a bowl up on the top of it in his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees buy it one up on the right side of the bowl the other upon the left side thereof now all of this is symbol it's there we understand that this was in the Tabernacle of in the wilderness remember Moses had been caught up and Moses caught the vision of of the Tabernacle of God and how that that was to be prepared on Earth and all of this was representative and a type the whole Tabernacle of God is man God's purpose is to dwell in man that's where all that's the where the whole mystery comes back to is God's purpose to dwell fully in man so when we see of these symbols as we see here what Zachariah is the Angel is Awakening him to see these things now notice in verse 4 and so I answered and I spoke to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my Lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts so God is clearly declaring strength human strength is not enough and it is not acceptable unto God even itself might is another form of strength it's not acceptable unto God because it can never accomplish the work of God so it's not our might it's not our strength because the reality is our might and our strength it fails right this is why we have to have more we we take our will and yield our will to the will of God because God's will will never override our will it's our will being surrendered to the will of God that's the key to Victory yeah so not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts who art thou o great Mountain before zerubbabel Thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you for who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubbabel with those seven they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole Earth amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated we certainly can see that in the symbols that are laid out here before us go out when he was expressing in his desire is that it would it would take it would take God's own life coming into a man into a woman and God through his life God brings a change in that life where it's it's not the person trying to do right and we all have been there we can try to do right I've had individuals text me and you know different things over the time here and not not setting here but texting me and I'm trying to get this right and I'm listening to this podcast and I I have to just come right back and just add the one thing as I look right right at and I say there's good intentions but you're trying to get the cart before the horse there's nothing you can do outside of being born again God never intended that it would be you or I handling the word you you or I could become a pretty good person we could live a good moral life we can live clean we could live above sin and still not be born again are you hearing me now uh we're this is a reality that it's it's God wanting to reveal himself in us and through our lives and so when we see this it's not by might it's not by power it's not by efforts and that is within everything in our life even after the Holy Spirit has come into our life by way of the new birth it still is a bringing to a reality within us it's not your power it's not your might it's our surrender yes sir it's his Spirit accomplishing his work in our lives and that's why that when even Nicodemus can come and Nicodemus could say do you expect a man how can a man enter into his mother's womb because Jesus is talking about being born again he wasn't talking about another natural birth because another natural birth would have the same problems so there's got to come a birth something that is a part or separate different from the natural birth and that requires the supernatural birth of the Holy Spirit God's own life see this is why you remember the scriptures that we referred to last week out of First John chapter four beloved try every spirit because it says many false prophets false preachers have went out into the world and he says we try every Spirit not just looking at the flesh but we tried the spirit because if it denies that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh it's not of God you realize the agnostics only want to make it just a man many just want to say well you know Jesus was just a man but you see what that is it's not the people it's spirits that are upon them to try to hold them back from a reality because if you have it that God has become flesh then it means the way has been opened up for you and I there's absolutely no excuse and it begins to bring what an accountability a responsibility in other words as pilate stood there that day and pilate his wife told him don't you have anything to do with this just man I had a dream don't touch him don't do nothing with him and so what did he do he wanted to wash his hands of the situation but no matter how much he washed his hands he could not get the blood off his hands he was responsible you know where a person that says well I'm just not going to make a decision you're making a decision every day of your life every service you're making a decision I'm making a decision it's not a choice or we're no choice zone no we're making choices every service every day so when we consider that pilate remember throughout his life the man tried he was always profusely as as history records trying to wash his hands you know why he had come face to face with the just one he had come face to face with one that stood before him and he could see through their lives this is a perfect and just man are you hearing me now it's got to be more than just seeing the message as perfect and just [Applause] are you hearing me it's got to be more than just that's a good message that's a perfect message that's a just message but yeah it has to come to a place what does this have to do with me because it's Jesus on our hands you know we think about the accountability that you and I will have within this hour it's a high accountability that we will have brother Samuel that scares me sometimes we need to be shook in our boots because we get the spirit of this age is such a you know a Syrah Saran just going with the flow and you know and don't judge me and this is that this is the whole Spirit of the age but God's word is a judge and you know what I'm thankful for that because the Bible tells me that when I am judged his desire in our life if I can accept it in the right way his desire is that I would not be condemned with the world so when we say this the scripture in verse 7 says who art down I want you to catch this who art thou oh great Mountain it's not a what it's who right it's a spirit it's Satan who art thou oh great obstacle or opposition is not just thoughts it's spirits you realize habits are spirits I've gotta I could quote it on the direct quote on this but you recognize habits are spirits people driven to to do things and moved about things where does that influence come from it's a spirit that's why a habit is not just let's look at the wall and we're going to change this around and we're going to do this and you know I'm gonna it's habits are not broke without anything apart from the Holy Spirit is that right if all of these things that brother random covers it whether it's clothing whether it's drinking whether it's less all of those things as he covers in that quote it's all spirits that are habits and the only thing that can break that is the Holy Spirit yeah are you hearing me it's very real demons are very real demons are not bad thoughts demons give bad thoughts the Holy Ghost is not a good thought the Holy Ghost is a person [Applause] who art the whole great Mountain what difficulty or obstacle because before or in the presence observable Thou shalt become a plane cerebrumable being a type of Jesus Christ are you with me it's very important for me to lay these things in zerubbabel was not just was not just an instrument that was being used by God there it was the type of Jesus Christ and let me go on to say it it's a type of Jesus Christ in the body of his bride [Applause] when the word finds its place in our life there's not a devil that can stand before you Hallelujah I don't care what's been in your past I don't care what's been in your childhood I don't care what injury has come your way I don't care what wound I'm not making light of it I'm saying that when the word is come in its rightful place and if it's there it's to recognize when I bring that to the word when I bring it to the word bring my life to the word it might require you and me dying to ourselves more the word is not just something we're accumulating and packing in the word is what wants to flow through us and release what God already has within us oh my These Are Spiritual powers that work this is why that Paul I read this I don't have time to read these scriptures but Paul would refer in the Ephesians 6 put on the whole armor of God it's not an outside armor it's an inner armor the armor of God is the word of God it's not a ladder it's a spirit of God it's a spirit of God his word wrapped up inside our life by the baptism of the Holy Ghost now why is that because that we might stand against the Wows of the devil let me just say this to you in case you don't know Satan is constantly on the onslaught and an attack against the work of the Holy Spirit no matter what he's done so far in your life whether you've went all the way into the new birth or it's just become justification or sanctification he is against the work of the Holy Spirit it's a spirit these you and I walk around and we can try to manipulate you know sometimes you'd see how they you know it's like with psychology wanting to manipulate people in their minds manipulate things and we'll just change this and and alter this you recognize that it's not psychology can never produce a real change in a person's life if it could have then God when he became flesh he should have sent a psychology book I'm not against psychologists but I'm trying to say if we're relying on that instead of the Holy Spirit we've got our rest and our hope in might and power and it'll never work because the Devil is a smart shrewd fellow he's more subtle than everyone there's only one that can outdo the devil and that's the Holy Ghost the holy spirit is not he does not come to shame us he comes to break the hold that Satan would want to have Upon Our Lives Hallelujah do you realize sitting in a service like this here this morning do you realize that there are two spiritual powers that work right now let's not be coy it's not just the spirit of God in this place right here right now remember when the sons of God come to worship you've heard it we're preached it on the Thursday nights brother Connery was just here on Thursday night when the sons of God Came To Worship Satan never said oh I'll stay home and stream that Satan said I'm streaming that I'm going are you hearing me now so here what we find is two spiritual Powers right here at work even in a meeting and while it's going on you know why it's a war it's trying to get positioned Satan wants to get positioned God's designed to get positioned let me just say this to you Satan is no match for God he's no match for God [Applause] the right here gathered what is it faith doubt there's paddling that's going on it's Satan that's wanting to tear down and move around and all of those things this is why the battles that we face it's not against flesh and blood you let a person make a decision to serve God and you watch all hell will come against them wife will raise up husband will raise up family will raise up it's not the people it's demon spirits that's inspiring them that's exactly why it is this is why that when a person I sit here and watch this that when a person can start to get close to God something will raise up and say if you keep going there if you keep doing that I'll leave you it becomes a real Showdown let me tell you something nobody's yoked up in hell let me just be honest with you there ain't no buddies in hell oh there is in hell is a lot of finger pointing wives will be pointing the finger at the husband you didn't leave the home right you didn't tell me when my dress wasn't appropriate you didn't Point me you didn't sit down with me and the husbands will sit down and say well you did this and you did that and husbands will look around to their buddies but there won't be no buddies in hell come on now and everybody believe hell's a real place hell ain't no figment of imagination if it is Heavens a figment too Heaven Ain't a figment Heaven is real [Applause] I mean they go to heaven cause they say they believe the message does not mean they go to heaven just because they're a good person does not mean they go to heaven heaven let me tell you something hell is filled with good people [Applause] brother Sammy I need some scripture glad you asked the Rich Young Ruler the Rich Young Ruler he stood before the presence of Jesus Christ and he stood right there and Jesus said what must I do to inherit eternal life he knew I know all about the message I know all about this a matter of fact I Rejoice around the message but he lacked something in his life it's more than just rejoicing around this message it's more than that you've got to have the substance it's got to take the spirit of God inside of your life the devil's not afraid because you recognize William Branham it was a prophet of God the devil's not afraid that you can just Rejoice at quotes on Sons and Daughters of God with before the foundation of the world but what he wants to do is keep it back from you rising up and saying that's me that's me [Music] I know you might look at me and say how could we be rejoicing and not saying it's me because spirit will come around and want to point things out why you are not worthy condemnation in your life where you know I'm not there yet what the message is calling for I believe this message I love this message but I'm not there yet you understand what I'm saying we're not talking about I don't think I should have to make this disclaimer I'm not talking about making this perfect but neither am I going to make excuses for this guy you understand like my dad told me when I was growing up boy you don't get out of bed don't expect to know for me to go into school of course after that car got taken and everything else you know don't expect that you're on your own you ain't sick get out of the bed so in other words quit writing excuses for this guy who do you think it is that tells you oh you're too bad to come to church or you're to this and you know you feel too bad and you who you think tells you that oh boy we're preaching now do I have to come down there and preach in the house I walk down the pews if I have to get about uncovering Satan we give him too much room the Bible said give no place to the devil friends it's things you're looking back to other examples let me tell you something you need to look back and deeper than just Mom and Dad because Mom and Dad might not be the example you need to look at you need to look clear back into Jesus Christ the Lamb's Book of Life [Applause] amen I'm talking about battling demon Spirits you're saying the song This Means War right right it's overcoming opposition and we don't overcome opposition by patting it around we've got to face the issue amen the word brings us to face the issue I want to face issues my flesh don't want to face them but my son but on the inside of the son and daughter of God I want to face him you know why because I realize it's Satan's desire to keep me back from all that God has for me so we're not wrestling against flesh and blood we are wrestling against Spirits principalities powers in Heavenly places and to understand that within this that Satan as Peter would write for you and I in verse 8 of First Peter 5 be sober it means being and be in her right mind I know we just kind of take that for granted but do you realize everything that's coming right through even Airwaves and everything else is there as the prophet could put it in this phrase to want to poison our minds I know it gets easy we talk about oh that person out there with blue hair oh boy it's so ungodly but remember I ain't talking about the people out there I'm talking about right here the Bible said that judgment it's time that judgment began at the house of God because we can feel pretty comfortable in looking at somebody else out there and say praise God you know I ain't like that that's called Pride and you know what pride is it's homemade it's got a homemade recipe you make it and you look down on somebody else and judge your life by somebody else that is not what a son and daughter of God does we do not judge our life by the world you judge your life by the word by the Holy Spirit as he's speaking to our lives I tell you he'll bring correction he'll bring out a vacation and if you're allow him to he will enable you and equip you with strength to stand against things in your life but see what Satan wants to do is get on your shoulder and you get offended oh I'm offended you hurt my feelings you hurt you know what that is that's a spirit of this age people's rights well let me just say this is clear you've got a right to go to hell too it's your right boy I thought we were having fire pit afterwards the preacher here come on friends let's listen God's not against us he's for us it's overcoming opposition does anybody like staying in the same place I don't want to stay in the same place because that's not moving on with God that's become bachelin that's become hypocrisy we want to move on with God in the power of almighty God in the power of His might what ordained from that brother joy to move when the Holy Spirit is here to move upon our life it's a time to move you realize the spirit of God through the prophet could say that when the Holy Spirit is here to inspire you he said confess what he is saying because God is here to make your body obey your confession who art thou old great Mountain because Aruba boy Thou shalt become a plane so we recognize the battle that set in in a ray all around us now this battle when we look at it as we mentioned of it last week of how Paul would Express to the church there in second Corinthians 11 3 I just want to jump to this scripture I fear less by any means as the serpent that was a vessel right the serpent was a vessel the serpent can say I'm one of God's creations come on now he won the slithering snake the Bible said he was a beast of the field are you with me he lost his position because of what he yielded himself too Hallelujah so if one yielding themselves in that way can go into a fall condition what about a child of God that will yield themselves to the word of God it'll take you back into your rightful position I fear less by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his satility so your minds somebody say they're with me your minds should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ so Satan's attack is there at the mind brother Sammy I thought it was there at the soul the Battleground is the mind the Battleground is no man's land are you with me the Battleground is where spiritual Powers they test their instruments Hallelujah they parade their nuclear submarines down through your mind come on let's just use some present figures they're flocked That's what Satan wants to do in the mind don't you realize that when David came out there to face Goliath David never said man you're pretty good with the slingshot but what goliath said to David was he said you ain't nothing but a youth right right you're ready there ain't nothing to you but that's just what you can see in the visible room you see Goliath wasn't gifted to see the supernatural Realm he was being influenced by demons but he couldn't see what David was standing and representing my my if his eyes could have been opened he would have solved the same Myriad and host of angels because when David said I'm not coming at you in the name of a church in the name of a family I'm not coming to you in the name of a Doctrine I'm coming to you in the name of the Lord of hosts the Lord is mighty in battle you know what host means it means that which is indivisible and unseen Realm the angels of God were gathered there you're nothing but a youth I will lift you I will I will feed your carcass to the foul there what's he trying to do get in his mind getting his mind that's the same way listen to me now that's the same way he'll come to every one of us no matter what it is you're facing you'll try to come in your mind I don't care if it's sin I don't care if it's disease I don't care if it's condemnation that didn't matter what it is he'll try to come in your mind and what he's pointing to is physical stature he's pointing to your abilities but not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord and if we can recognize that the spirit of God is here I'm a Child of God well that should have been a little bit more amen I'm a Child of God I am redeemed let the redeemed of the Lord say so let the wheat say I am strong well I'm weak I'm not even going to come to church that's the dumbest decision you could ever make sorry just shooting plane don't even make sense that's like saying you know I'm hungry but I ain't gonna eat how foolish is that it's a place to get strength from it's not this building are you hearing me it's drawing strength from El Shady eye that's why we come and We Gather here in this place and God rewards sacrifice I said God reward sacrifice and just to check it where is your sacrifice at [Music] are you sacrificing for the right things or some people you couldn't keep them at home for a social event oh dear God they wouldn't miss a social event but church becomes optional I'm telling you what it is your backslip there's another spirit working on your life honey maybe we just be the ones fellowshipping around the fire tonight you preaching that's good do you think God's against you you think I'm against you not at all it's not you it's a spirit you see God has equipped that part of it to see there's times that you can't see things about your life but thanks be to God that God knows and he sees about our life and God doesn't say Joshua you're not worthy of me that's not what he does but he comes down to do what deal with the opposing spirit it's running to oppose the work of the holy spirit in your life that's why he would want you just to settle for some cheap counterfeit like we were talking to the young people I'm speaking to them on Friday night well we were collectively together had just a wonderful time there on Friday night with famine we were just right there together sitting around and speaking but just as we speak about things I said you look at influences back there we can talk about Elvis Presley you had young people there that were looking at Elvis Presley say well he's a Christian so because somebody says they're Christian does that make them a Christian no knew what makes a Christian a Christian well because they reflect god well I know some people that can reflect attributes they can be kind you know maybe the seventh day of the week but they can be kind no what separates it makes a real Christian is the Holy Ghost that's why brother Brandon could tell us in the Holy Ghost series he said there's a difference between just a Christian and a holy ghost-filled Christian because the Holy Ghost feel Christian it is Christ on the inside living out his life you think a real Christian don't have trials and tribulation and trouble and have to battle against coldness sure but there is an effer present God that is there within their life there's a desire that beats for God a desire that longs for God a desire that says I can't get enough of him I need more of Jesus foreign that's what the real Holy Ghost does it gives you a desire for God not just well I'm good enough I don't drink no more I don't smoke no more I don't look at stuff on the internet no more no the Holy Ghost is there to live inside of you [Music] Lord God is dealing with opposing spirits yeah that's true when God sends his word it comes straight from his throne he maketh his angels flames of fire that's Hebrews one he maketh flames of fire what if fire is it it's the fire of God it's the same consuming fire God has a consuming fire the same fire that consumed the sacrifice is the same fire that came and got in them on the day of Pentecost but the Samuel why is that important I'm glad you asked that you ever take a balloon maybe you did you didn't I hate loud noises so I always hate it when they want to do stuff like this but they take a balloon and just fill it up with hair and you put it over heat a flame what's it going to do come on man say it with confidence what's it going to do I'm going to take you around back after church it pops right you put a flame on it on a balloon it pops but you know if you take that same balloon and you put water in it and you hold it over a flame it won't pop you know why it don't mean that he ain't there but it's got something inside it that's able to change the temperatures it's got something inside of the table to adjust the Temptations that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost it don't mean that we're not over the Bunsen burner and the Flames going but we've got something inside us that's able to move when Satan comes this way it's able to water moves this way what is it it's a holy spirit because this right here alone not by power not by might it would pop without the water of the Holy Ghost that's why we must have the Holy Ghost by my Spirit saith the Lord of hosts God sends his spirit he sins his angels now Satan's got angels too we talked about that last week right Satan's got angels too and they're not lazy they are they're workers the Bible calls them deceitful workers transforming themselves into Apostles of right this is new understanding if it doesn't match with a word are you hitting me this isn't just something we're looking at out here examining in here does my reasoning match the word of God if it doesn't get rid of it if my imagination does not match God's word get rid of it yeah and you know what I'm grateful that the spirit of God he maketh his angels flames of fire that the spirit of God can come and minister to you and I as Sons and Daughters of God and reveal Satan's attempted destruction of Our Lives the Bible said that be sober and diligent because your adversary not your buddy right not your friend on Facebook or Instagram or SnapChat or whatever no no your adversary I think we all agree the devil's an adversary but remember he goeth about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour his duty his job is to destroy God's creation Satan would love nothing more than to destroy your life he would love nothing more than for you to stop right where you're at but like Elijah or Elisha told gehazer remember when the sunamite woman came she said I've got a knee my child is dead we laid him in the upper room The Prophet's chamber he's dead I put him up there and Elisha told Geezer you take this staff and you go and I don't want you stopping I don't care who comes in your wake don't you stop for nothing you know what that's saying you've got authority to override every opposition you've got authority to override every obstacle why you've got a prophet's word that has come from the Throne of God what is it it's the king's message it's the king's scepter [Applause] it's the scepter of the King You've Got authority to say get out of my way devil if it's condemnation get out of my way you say how do I say get out of my way repent that's saying get out of the way don't just push him back because he'll be right there to greet you when you get out steam out and that's why God sends his servants he maketh his and his ministers angels angels ministering spirits that do what Minister the spirit of the word not just the word because the word alone killeth but the spirit giveth life see the ministering of the spirit of the word what does it do it opens up the vision over our life to where you can look and Satan can point out all your faults all your failures let me tell you something you can sit right here this morning and say he's preaching all over me and not preaching all over you it's God wanting to free you now if you want to live by kerosene lamp that's your choice but you don't have to live by a kerosene lamp there's electricity here there's a power here that can light your life up that'll illuminate your life like never before don't let the devil crouch in on you well you believe the message you've believed a message for a long time you remember no we match it with the word of God what does your life say right now with the word of God does your word does your life say Amen to the word of God if it doesn't the a manner is here if you've got cold the a minor is here come on Fred don't you hang your head because well I'm so sad I got down I got cold that's a spirit wanting to anoint you with self-pity reject that Devil he's wanting to hold you back what do I do stand face to face because that is death stand under the anointing of life and say Satan you that wanted to hold me back your scheme is exposed what are you going to do stand on the Lord's Side because he is the captain of our salvation you know what salvation is Deliverance he's the captain of our deliverance he's a five-star general he's never lost a battle the Simplicity that Satan would love to corrupt the minds from is that true Liberty that's in Jesus Christ and let me tell you something he conquered every demon I could read a Litany of scriptures I could cover we could get covered up in scripture right here I don't have to read them over and over through the script because it's true he is above every principality every Power I don't care what new disease comes up I don't care what Greek letter they put on it I don't listen friends we're talking about the word of God why are you hearing me you know it's one thing it's one thing when things come our way and then we're faced with it within our own home right we're faced with they win our own home but what are we going to do about it Satan comes and wants to make an attack it doesn't matter who who you are it doesn't matter if it's me you think Satan is trying to send the tax right here it wants to send a tax because if he can get a leader a Shepherd weakened man he can have Heyday with the flock oh my same thing in your lives Brothers as husbands fathers grandfathers same thing in this church talking about angels you know what we're under right now the anointing of the Holy Ghost that's who's Discerning your heart that's who's Discerning your life don't worry because brother Samuel you know me I don't got Facebook I don't want it I don't have Instagram I don't want it I have to speak to the young people and work with them on those things I don't want the stuff you know why I don't got time for it because you probably got family like I got that if you look at their trash book I mean their Facebook page all it is is trash and all them spewing all their their political stuff here and there not as Sons and Daughters of God brother random said what where your Uzziah failed is he got caught up in politics the church is not a political machine we do not live Victorious because of politics Trump did not help us live in Liberty it's because the Council of God was his present that our lives would move under the influence of the Holy Spirit [Music] Lori hey that's awful strong brother Sammy I love my country I think you'll love it more than you love God shame on you where have you fallen from you know and all about it ain't gonna straighten it all out the thing you need to be ready for this life is not about this life this life are you hearing me it's not about this life this life is about the next life [Applause] of assemble what are you saying don't give me an excuse for what you're indulging in because the reason you're indulging it because you're lacking spiritually and you know what you've got to find someplace something to fill that void come on some people they will find the god of sports to fill their void right even if it is ungodly people come on I don't have to leave and go 30 some miles from here you know what I'm talking about and put the god of sports you know why you know what that is there's a lacking it shows there's a place in your life that God wants to feel it oh brother Samuel I don't believe God's against Sports well I never said God was against sports but sometimes those things get said like that to just make room how much room is it in your life getting quiet now how much room [Applause] you know more about their stats and everything else and hadn't even prayed and listened to a message [Music] I'm talking about spiritual opposition don't you realize Samson the Philistines are upon you thank you you know I've already left the notes long time ago I'm talking about who likes our old great Mountain you've got to face that mountain stop letting the devil put it off letting him some shove it to another service do you realize if you and your mind entertain a thought I'll do it on Thursday I'll get it next week brother Branham takes us right into the message of by faith faith is the victory he said if Satan can get you to think that he said you'll get up from this Altar and walk out the same person it's got to become between life and death I would not be too ashamed to say God I need more oh brother the same night he went to the altar ones what's stopping you from coming again God never took the altar out of church all the altars in my heart the altars in my mind are you using it are you using it God never took this out you can never have more enough of the Lord oh I got enough that's what the spirit of this age says I'm rich increased with goods and I Don't Need No More Jesus but they'll say they love Jesus right give them a few scriptures because remember Jesus says the word may flesh is that right give them a few scriptures and see if they love Jesus because Jesus ain't something different from his word that's what Satan's desire has been to corrupt the mind because you know why the real gospel brings Liberty to your life he ascended far above every principality every Power and it's his anointing that comes to break the yoke that same Pillar of Fire he's here well bless him you're just saying it no he's here he's here he's here he's the one he's the one that brings the message he's the one that inspires me I don't I don't apologize for that right as Believers we know that and we expect it who you think it is that moves you to pray who do you think it is that moves you to read who do you think it is that moves you to you know what it's been a while I've let some things creep into my life who do you think it is that moves to that place let me tell you who it is it's the angel of the Lord and he's wanting to influence your life you know why so that you don't become so bound up so Twisted so tied up because let me tell you something if you can look back a few months ago or a year ago and you can say man I ain't as ferving as I was before there's Grace right here this morning I said did you hear me there's Grace right here at this moment there's a there is a strength with the spirit of the Lord in our life because it's safe to desire he wants to get us all just settled down that's been his trick down Through the Ages is to get them all settled down in Zion get everybody settled down you know in the message that they had received in that day they get settled down they get comfortable and let me tell you something this is right here where the devil's fighting and one of the things right now we could look at and say well I'll tell you I'm still in church I still believe the message I still that ain't what that is not what oh well I must be going everything must be going on good Satan is fine with you just being just a warm body on a pew he's okay it don't disturb him if you say you believe the message that don't bother him yeah right right matter of fact he won't even send his alarm clock on it and get out of bed he don't bother him that you can quote the message but what'll get him up off of his bed is when that life goes to start living through you some of you know right where I'm at on a quote brother bam tells us when the day of Pentecost had fully come Satan didn't even get out of his bed and they were filled with the Holy Ghost but Satan didn't even get out of the bed but when the man at the gate called Beautiful got healed what was it it was the life working in the body that same life that overcome every demon spirit and every Spirit had to bow in subjection to the authority of Jesus Christ he got upset when that Authority was working in the body because the whole purpose of redemption is that he might dwell inside of his creation it's the anointing that breaks the yoke it's anointing let me read this to you in closing it's just a wow a quote right here that I want to read to you the ram says a sinner I don't have it in there don't look for it brother Brown says this a sinner comes to the Altar and says brother Branham I want you to pray for me I want to be good I want you just to pray for me and you go back in your seat whether I'm saying on the next the next night he said I'll say how many wants to be saved he said here the same man stands up you want to be saved young man yes sir well why don't you get saved I don't know he said see the devil's holding that boy he wants to do right are you hearing me he wants to do right but there's a spirit a power that won't let him do right he wants to do right but there's a power that won't let him do right another man said oh Hallelujah here it is no wonder God would let a true man of God he would never let him say that he could heal somebody because Christ done that when he died are you catching what's saying here no man heals you it's not the man's hands it's not even the man's prayer it's your faith in a finished work man amen all right this is about the Simplicity of Christ I couldn't save nobody no one else could save anybody but God and he said and God can't save you because he's already done it you see it be like you trying to pay a hospital bill that somebody's already paid you've got to come to terms somebody paid my debt oh yeah somebody paid what was to stand against me what the devil would try to use against you and say you're not worthy but Christ already paid the way he already made a way that's why he comes to deal with you God is not dealing with your life because he can't help you he's dealing with your life because he is the worthy one to help you he's already done it the only thing you have to do is accepted and you know that's the hardest thing that's the hardest thing is for us to accept it it requires us to surrender to accept it not sit around and try to well let me accept it now come on let's not make this as hard if I had you know 20 in my wallet I'd be happy but if I had twenty dollars in my wallet and I pulled it out I'm sure if I went to pull that out your Lord I'd have to have armor bearers to protect me right pulling out in today's economy and it may burn up in your hand but I've had 120 Bill 100 bill you know what and I said you know what I want you to take this and I want you to go buy lunch today with this you know what I guarantee and you might say Oh Brother Sam that's that's all right but it really in your heart like pray you don't put our heck in his wallet I'm not just trying to be humble because on the second time around I'm Gonna Take It yeah true right yes sir sometimes we think being humble is saying Lord I'm not worthy that ain't being humble that's called being prideful and that's a spirit of pride that I can help myself know we need his help brother Banner will put it just like this he said there's an old God dishonoring proverb that said God helps those who helps themselves he said that's a lie God helps those who cannot help themselves God don't shame anybody because of the condition they're in but he lets them know I am your Waymaker I am your deliverer I am the one that comes the loose and the holds upon your life Hallelujah that's not the anointing of an evil spirit that's the anointing of the Holy Spirit is the angels of God that are set and rather around you this morning that's nudging you and saying this is for you back him a hundred dollars Mr Amanda I think you would maybe you you would take it and say I'm going to go to lunch with that I'm sure you wouldn't be going to McDonald's either yeah I better not say anything about McDonald's but 100 I guarantee what you do you don't you think you know what I'm gonna go somewhere and I'm gonna get me a good steak right as soon as that touched your hand like that you'd start thinking about them rolls that butter that steak and all those things that you could and do you realize to accept Jesus Christ to accept what he's already done for you is easier than that yeah it's just what must I do just as much if I wanted to give you that hundred dollars you wouldn't sit there with your hands in your pockets you know what you do right come on now you'd reach out and take it that's what you have to do with the word of God when the word of God is coming forth God's dealing with their life they'll sit with your hands in your pocket but reach out and take it bring it home it'll change your life it'll change your mind it'll change your nature it'll change your desires it'll change you from sickness to hell [Applause] truth he said I was saved 1900 years ago I just received it and I just accepted it I was healed 1900 years ago you got a disease or an infirmity or something's bothering you in your body you were healed before the foundation of the world you said brother Samuel right there you just read 1900 years ago that's when Isaiah 53 was manifested right but when Isaiah stood right there the spirit of God picked him up and he said he was wounded I might not be that smart but I know was it's past tense you know why from the mind of God it was a finished work and if the devil couldn't stop that bear he can't stop it here what do I do accept it foreign right now in this presence where the spirit of God is present to break every spirit right now you know you know there's things that's lifted oppression from off of your life what are you saying brother Samuel I'm telling you a spirit that's wanted to keep you back but right here under the anointed preaching of the word of God it's done something for you then more pictures can do you could look at the mirror all you want to look at and all you'd see is the same sorry old person that can't do nothing about his ways but right here in the presence of God there is a mirror that you can look into it is a mere a perfect Liberty a mirror of the glory of God not a mirror where you see yourself as a defeated helpless worthless being but you see yourself as a son and daughter of God amen then I'm not worthless I'm somebody he came all the way from Glory from me he shed his blood for me he sent the Holy Ghost for me he came to break the hold of opposition from around my life the brand goes on to say and I'm closing right here he said but once that spirit is broken right around that young man's life then it can be saved what is it it's a spirit but God has sent his word to cast out the unclean spirits I'll go ahead and put the devil on notice again he ain't welcome here every sinner is welcome because there's one that can change you just like he did me but I'll put him on notice the devil ain't welcome when the devil gets upon the Sheep you ain't welcome these are God's sheep and God's put their heart within me for his sheep for his children you ain't welcome here you ain't welcome we ain't giving you any room we're not giving you any place we're not giving you any Corner we're here to call you out [Applause] he's a liar he's a defeated being Hallelujah This Means War This Is War we're not fighting a losing battle we're on the winter side we're more than conquerors I'll tell you right here in this atmosphere this morning brother goes on in that same quote and he brings it on down for anyone he said even if you're suffering from a disease or an affliction he said let that Spirit be broken from around you it's a spirit you realize that diabetes is high blood pressure is a spirit come on every disease is a spirit well you mean because I've got that disease I'm not a Christian that don't have one thing to do with it these bodies are still sin just because you've maybe even got a weakness in your mind don't mean you're not a Christian can come and hit you with depression he can come and try to hit you with anxiety that don't mean you're not a Christian it just means you're living beneath your privileges that ain't to shame you that's to remind you the joy of the Lord is my Shred not anything else the joy of the Lord is my strength Hallelujah let the Holy Ghost have the right away [Applause] get on your feet receive it in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah every devil is defeated every disease is defeated Hallelujah glory be to God if you like if you haven't surrendered accept it right now accept it right now while Satan's Army is being routed and put to flight what are you saying son stand still we don't want Darkness to come back in Sun stand still stand still till there's full Deliverance stand still until there's full healing you've got Authority you hear me you've got Authority if you need to repent repent in the name of Jesus Christ you've got a liberty that you can move within that right now the spirit of God right here this morning the angel of the Lord not a minor Angel the angel of the Lord is here to break every habit listen how can you say that he has been lifted up far above principality in every Power don't let you don't you let the devil stand in your ear and say well you've had this for this many years well today is your day what are you saying push back against the devil has a son and daughter of God brother Samuel this is it can't be my strength it ain't your strength that's not what you feel right here because your strength and my strength we wouldn't feel like nothing but this is not the strength of a man it is the strength of almighty God man yes by my spirit what must I do just open your mind up letting flow right on through your mind and what did you do doubt your doubts and believe God's word I don't care how many times you've been prayed for you believe it right here this morning right here it's my moment but you let the devil remember spirituals spiritual battles engage but we denounce the enemy the announcing let's pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus in the all-sufficient name of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord every principality and every Power has already been defeated Lord You've healed before the foundation of the world by his stripes we are healed Isaiah was caught up and seen it as a finished work the sons of God the morning Stars shouted for joy at seeing the salvation of the Lord the Deliverance Lord we are morning Stars we are rejoicing shouting thanking you Lord and surrendering Our Lives to you Lord you laid this thought on our heart father Even In This Moment we stand here o God under your leadership I pray Heavenly Father that God Even In This Moment may you just Lord take every life and every heart deeper Lord deeper Lord may you move for every need Lord I pray God every Lord every disease that's already defeated every habit already defeated oh God right here the smoke every sin every every Spirit of unbelief and doubt has already been conquered now Lord may your subjects May your children may they walk and accept it just like that hundred dollar bill Lord may they take it into their bosom Lord May there be God Hearts where Lord Spirits Lord that have been broken that they might walk in a real surrender in this moment lives Lord that can really fully repent not just be sorry for a condition they're in but really really look at you and say Lord forgive me of my sin I Lay My Life down lord and Lord my strength is nothing I can't do it Lord my power is nothing I can't do it Lord I can't do it Lord I've tried to fill my life with devotionals or this and that I can't do it I still find I'm lacking I'm empty I need you Lord God May there not be we dismiss every Spirit of pride God want to hold any life back may they Lord just move right into your presence Lord of life that Lord that can really as a son and daughter of God look in their life and say you know what I'm not where I used to be I've gotten cold I'm letting little things move into my life and what's happening is the more I let things like that move in it's crowding out Jesus it's got to where that Jesus is not the priority in my life I don't make the same sacrifices the same effort that I used to make instead I find myself making excuses well he ain't here to shame you but I'm telling you how that you can look and say God you're a restorer Lord I'm asking you to restore the joy of thy salvation in my life like they looked in the Book of Joel they did not have any drink offering or any meat offering the vine and the and the fields were all bare they had nothing to bring to the house of God they had no joy the reason is is they had become neglectful little by little it don't start out real big it starts out little by little by little by little by little by little by little the same way that God builds himself in your life little by little by little Satan takes away little by little by little by little why is he doing that so he can go unnoticed but right now in his presence the restore is in the building one to restore you one that's here that you can say Lord let me just move out all of the things that's accumulated in my life things that I've allowed because you find once you start giving room to something there's always something more you've got to lay in there it's just what it is is we're actually replacing the what you really need you know how they tell us Medical Science and things they can say a person will drink pop and everything else but what you really need is water all those other things they do not satisfy your thirst this is why you feel empty look what Satan wants to do to you he wants to do that to where then you feel so condemned to where you don't even feel like you can stand in the presence of God I say right now why don't you take the sight of the Lord right now just say Lord Jesus you're a restorer Lord I've drifted but I want to come right back in Lord to your presence I want to come back into that fervancy Lord there's some things that I know I've got to clear out and set aside but I want to be fervent I want to make the rapture I don't want to live a life that's tribulation bound I want to live a life that's rapturing Grant it Lord Jesus help us Lord granted Lord for those that Lord are suffering in their body maybe they're suffering Lord they've suffered in their mind but right here this is the day this is the moment of Liberty Lord father where the spirit we're Satan is Cast Away or they can rise rise in that Liberty Lord because we're the spirit of the Lord there is Liberty Lord God you don't condemn us you don't shame us but you come Lord to manifest yourself through our life how many throughout this building Lord Jesus I think you know Lord I've done it many times when somebody sometimes the Lord has come maybe it's been a situation on the job they can speak to me Lord and I know that God that you have given counsel and wisdom right through this channel but even after that is done many times I will make mention to them and say why don't you go talk to sister so and so or brother so and so because I know that person has been through exactly what they're going through and they're there to let them know God Did It For Me he'd do it for you Lord throughout all this building right here this morning what Satan has meant for evil you have turned for our Goods there are testimonies that stand right here that Lord that can look write depression look anxiety look other things right in the face and say you don't have no hold on me you don't have to hold on me oh dear God granted Lord this morning granted Lord may we rise like that eagle may we
