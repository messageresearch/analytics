god lord jesus how we love you lord we can look lord and see how that god you have dismantled every hold upon our life oh god you have brought us lord from where we were to where we are now oh god we can look o god and and see lord not the work of man but to see the work of almighty god lord we're thankful tonight lord we are rejoicing in the god of our salvation lord to know that you who begun the good work in us will perform it until the day of jesus christ we're looking to you lord who is the author and the finisher of our faith oh god we are drawing strength lord from el shaddai oh god we love you lord we thank you lord for your mercies lord they are new every morning o god how we praise you lord jesus we thank you lord once again lord for the privilege that you've given us this evening lord to be able to come together lord father not just lord together as as people coming together but lord to assemble lord according to your word according to the promise that lord that you have given us lord that lord if we father would be gathered together lord in your name then you will be in the midst lord father that's what makes the difference in every gathering lord there can be many gatherings of people but you're the one who makes a difference lord there were many rooms lord and many occupying rooms there in jerusalem that day but what made the difference lord is where you were present with them lord so father we sense lord your presence lord knowing by your word that god even if we did not sense it we stand like elisha could stand that day when he could speak to geheza your prophet told us elisha didn't see those angels but he knew the promise of the word that the angels of god are encamped about them who fear and love him and oh god what a strength lord what a comfort we have lord that father to know that lord it's you you're among us lord and what things can take place lord i pray that god that you'll help us this morning or this evening rather that our eyes lord of faith will be lord open our eyes will be anointed lord for whatever the need might be lord father we ask that you'll just come lord be the speaker and hear together and help me just to step aside lord that you can speak personally lord help us lord in these next few moments lord oh god as we just yield ourselves to you and just invite that you'll just come in a very special way this evening father lord we love you and we thank you lord in the precious name of the lord jesus christ amen amen if you'll turn with me to deuteronomy chapter 28 i will say it's just it's good to be in the house of the lord and amended now i just know i heard even the reports the service here on sunday and just a wonderful it meant a wonderful service and we certainly thank you for your prayers there as we were with brother ray erickson and the assembly there and just ask that you'll continue to keep them in prayer many of you were aware of the couple that was that had passed on in that house explosion and then on sunday evening there was also a family that was involved in a head-on collision and the the brother the young man went on home he passed away so and just to keep the families in prayer and the church because they're certainly certainly been dealing with a lot and i can i can say this that um even as we were there on on sunday you you know that there is the strength of the lord that is really there with them and just to see god's comfort and just just how how that the lord just has been helping them along and we we have that you know no no i'm glad that that that god not only ministers to give us uh real comfort in our soul but then even at times when our spirit needs healing he's there to heal our spirit just as much as to heal our body and so we're thankful for that and we just want to continue to remember them in prayer and also i know i heard the testimony that was given for for sister linda and that she's back home now and she was really well of course you can imagine after five months in the hospital uh someone she's very very thankful and uh she just to me it's just a miracle all the way through i don't i you know i've spoke to some and i don't i don't want to take a lot of time here tonight um but i just it's just a miracle just from just the moments of seeing her at first and then to where everything has come to and we just give god all the praise on our glory and um let's just look here in the word in deuteronomy chapter 28 and i'm not going to have you stand for the whole part i'll just we'll just read a couple scriptures and then we'll let you be seated here tonight in in deuteronomy chapter 28 and verse 1 and it shall come to pass if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe and to do all his commandments which i command thee this day that the lord thy god will set thee on high above all nations of the earth and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god amen may god bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated if you notice as we read here in verse 1 and verse 2 i'd like to speak tonight subject i've been trying to get to uh and then tonight hopefully it just leads a conjunction in between but um the path i want to just speak on tonight the path of spiritual blessings the path of spiritual blessings and when we look here in verse 1 and in verse 2 if you notice that when god pronounces this of of the blessings that the blessing of the lord if you look here in verse 2 it says all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god so the blessing of the lord it travels through the word of the lord the blessing of the lord doesn't will not come in any other way but through his word and to see that within just verse one and verse two it's hearts that and lives that are hearkening not just it first starts with agreeing with the word but it's more than just agreeing with it it's the le it's to give our lives to that word and let that word change our lives so the so the blessing of the lord as it comes through the word and in verse 3 i want to go on and read it says blessed shalt thou be in the city blessed shalt thou be in the filled blessed shalt thou be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground and the fruit of thy cattle the increase of thy kind and the flocks of thy sheep blessed shall be thy basket and thy store blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out and the lord shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face they shall come out against thee one way and they shall flee before thee seven ways so there's going to be opposition in the midst of all the blessings there is going to be oppositions because this land of promise that we are speaking of we know we're reading here god gave that land of canaan as a type in the natural of what the real promised land is to the believer is the holy ghost and god has as let it be known there is going to be opposition in other words satan is going to challenge every single blessing and everything that god has for you and i there's going to be opposition before us but we have this promise here the lord shall cause thine enemies not not our our great ability our great military strategy but god shall cause thine enemies that rise up to be smitten before thee and notice they will flee before thee seven ways it'll be a complete victory not partial anything that god does is not a partial doing when god when god moves on the scene to fight the battle god brings a complete deliverance a complete victory so no matter you you might be looking at something even tonight but remember this is part of the blessing that even when as you might see one pathway going and one pathway going there is a complete victory that god has and for every situation that arises we might see little by little sometimes things just doesn't go right away but we have the promise that god has given us he said i will dismantle every enemy that rises up against you verse 8 the lord shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses and in all that thou settest thine hand unto he shall bless thee in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee the lord shall establish thee and holy people unto himself as he hath sworn unto thee if thou shalt keep the commandments of the lord thy god and walk in his ways let me just let me just stop here just for a moment god's desire was that israel would have a heart it would be in their heart to do the will of god and notice the law itself the law being given thou shalt do this thou shalt not do this thou shalt not do this that was not god's perfection or what god desired is that man would just live by the law but god's desire knowing that when man fell in the beginning it was inwardly there had to come about a change on the inside to where it's more than us just not doing this because i shouldn't do that but it god's desire was i want to make it i want to bring it to where now there's a change on the inside to where the very desire of the heart of the individual is changed so that the keeping of the word is not you and i trying to keep it and listen that's all part of a of a stage of the journey are you hearing me god begins to deal with the life that's all part of the stage of the journey justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost but in this where his where his life comes down on the inside it brings it brings a complete transformation in that life and the path of spiritual blessings is heeding the word of god he's yielding to it it's not us trying to figure it out that's many times where we fail we try to figure it out listen let's just be honest now it's this thing that has got us in trouble the fall itself happened by reasoning with the word of god god made a promise and all he asked them to do was believe it and believe it is is to look to god to fulfill it in his season not for us to make it come to pass but notice where in the beginning the failure came when they begin to reason with the promise of almighty god reason with the word and all god asks you and i to do is yield to his voice be diligent to observe what it is that he's speaking every promise to the ages is he that hath an ear everybody has ears is that right but when it says he that hath an ear it's speaking more than these ears right here but it's speaking to that on the inside of that heaven hath in here let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches that it's not it's not man but it's the holy spirit that's speaking to where a life begins to awaken to the voice of god notice this in verse 10 and all the people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the lord and they shall be afraid of thee and the lord shall make thee plenteous in goods in the fruit of thy body in the fruit of thy cattle in the fruit of thy ground in the land which the lord swear unto thy fathers to give thee let me just say it like this this all of these promises that god has given is not the reason why a life serves god are you hearing me it's like when you go to sign up for a job there's such a thing called french benefits is that right you know as a teacher i couldn't ask much when i went for the interview but when i went for the interview of an administrator that's different you start asking them here do i have pick up on the pickup in other words i'm not paying for my retirement but there you are kicking in the part that i normally would kick in are you hearing me there's benefits french fringe benefits things that come with it and it's just part of the package and that's what god is saying many of these things we've read about right here are natural blessings and god has said i'm your caregiver i'm your caretaker i'm jehovah jireh if you'll just hearken to my voice i'll see that the things in the natural or their blessings will be poured out so that your focus is not on the natural things of life when israel got away from the voice of god that's when they had to start focusing on the natural things of life this is where they started to worship other gods trying to find on their books trying to find other things and find other ways but god has one program it's a simple program all that god asks us to do is believe and yield to his voice and give ourselves to him and he'll take care of everything else and the lord shall open unto thee his good treasure the heaven to give the rain unto thy land in the in his season and to bless all the work of the hand and thou shalt lend unto many nations and thou shalt not borrow and the lord shall make thee the head and not the tale i'm not going to be able to get here tonight and thou shalt be above only and thou shalt not be beneath that if thou sh now hearken unto the commandments of the lord thy god which i command thee this day to observe and to do them thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which i command thee this day to the right hand or to the left to go after other gods to serve them what an application that remember that even the dying to ourselves when we've come face to face with the word it's a dying to ourselves when the word is dealing with our life even in the initial parts where god is dealing with the life and justification and sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost it's requiring a dying out to self and then when that takes place on the inside then we have a strength a power a life on the inside there is a new desire on the inside the desire to please the lord and by that desire to please the lord then comes the fulfillment of the scripture paul could say i die daily it's not struggling against sin it now comes to a place of things that could be absolutely lawful but we look at it and evaluated of is this going to take me out of the will of god how is this going to affect my family how's this going to affect my life you see now everything is everything all of our ambitions and all of our dreams have now come subject under the headship of the word and we can look to him and say lord if my dreams do not fit your program though i may desire to be this or do this or do that i want your will above my will that's the victory of gethsemane nevertheless not my will thine will be done [Applause] and what blessing that you and i have received because of that victory we now have received are you hearing me now we have received that same life that same quality of life inside of us to where that you and i have strength to yield our will to god's will oh hallelujah so the blessings of the lord are tied to obedience it's obedience to the things of god the bible said he giveth the holy ghost to them that obey him it's obedience it's simple obedience is simple obedience is not trying to figure it out obedience is simply do what he has said do don't turn from it to the right or left in other words don't reason here or reason here don't try to pass it because to try to pass around it then is to remove from the path of spiritual blessings now i want to just just taking this part here on you and i being partakers of this resurrection life and i want to just kind of cap back over a few things from last week i i just just feeling pressed in my heart here on saturday morning and i want to read this here on joshua 5 and 8 where they crossed they've crossed the jordan into the land there is memorials that are set up and here there is instruction by god that joshua was to make sharp knives and circumcise the children of israel again all part of this so that they might be partakers in other words they can't have the identity of egypt upon their life they can't be identical egypt is a type of the world not a location are you hearing me now it's just like in the scriptures when it says babylon the babylon the great is fallen in the book of revelations it ain't talking about a physical place it's talking about a spiritual condition a spirit of religion that is permeated throughout this entire world and you can see the effect of her religion it's a gathering listen now there's a gathering going on the gathering in the dispensation of the fullness of time fullness of times mean at the completion of the gentile ages it's a gathering and the bible said the gathering shall be unto him unto jesus christ himself the very fullness of god himself in the fullness of time and yet while that gathering is going on remember there was a jacob and an esau there was an abel and a cane is that right there was always twins and while that gathering is going on there's a gathering also that is taking place through that mother are you hearing me now it's a gathering that's going on it's permeated through all the world her religion now what has her religion produced it's a gathering just like you and i have been gathered spiritually in christ right no matter if you're in costa rica no matter if you're in honduras no matter if you're in lorraine no matter if you're in lima no matter if you're in christ that's the place to be because in christ is the place of rapture is that right so it's not a physical location it's a spiritual location where the promise of rapture is in christ right and notice how do we get into christ we come into christ by one spirit first corinthians 12 by one spirit we are all baptized into one body right and yet that's now on the contrast the spirit that's out there it's a gathering and she's gathering it through her teaching are you hearing me now she's gathered through her three chord her three chord teaching teaching in the name of father son and holy ghost well i don't know this this is not here but he knows where we're going and that's why that when you look at that all throughout the bible says that she has daughters now what are those daughters those donors are a product of what she is those that have forsaken the way of the lord is that what the bible says in the book of proverbs that she hath forsaken the paths of her youth are you hearing me now she had forsaken that she went she went in air went in perverseness now notice the gathering of her it is a cage full of every hatred and unclean foul bird this is a gathering she's gathering all the spirits all of these all of the peoples of the earth is being gathered together oh but we want to be gathered to the right place the world council of churches is gathering but this is god has sent a word in this hour because let me tell you something there is judgment on that image daniel pronounced it under the spirit of god and saw judgment come into that image that there would be a stone that would be cut out of a mountain without hands oh glory and the prophet said in this hour god in his grace had sent a message that he would catch you and i before that stone would smack the image that we can flee to him who is that stone that stone is christ jesus it's that revelation of christ that smites the image that breaks the yoke that that that that that does away with that foundation oh my oh my my my now here these partakers of resurrection life god as as it said in verse 8 and it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people that they abode in their places in the camp till they were whole and the lord said unto joshua this day have i rolled away the reproach of egypt from off you well it was joshua that made short knives but he was obedient to the voice of god so god was letting him know because you have yielded yourself to my word this was not an easy thing to ask for but there's got to be a circumcision coming the camp are you hearing me i'm just going to be playing it would be painful for a little child but for grown men notice it shows what the word requires this is separating from egypt it's a cutting away but notice when it's all said and done god has placed it that this is my work that i have come down and i have rolled away the reproach of egypt from off you you know what you said brother samuel what would that mean when he would come to stand in battle they would know that i am standing here as a covenant jew i am in the covenant of abraham how are you in that covenant god himself has come down and god performed a circumcision on my life [Applause] they can say all you've got's a man's word no this ain't a man's word it's god's word there was an authority an anointing that came behind that word that they could say i am no longer bound to my first birth i'm no longer bound to egypt god removed the reproach the unbelief of egypt the world from off their lives now this is only a type of what the holy ghost comes to do in the life of the believer when god had called them into the land remember there were spies that went over and there was a great deal of them that said we can't take it and we've heard this over and over they can't we can't take it they came back over across the land even there were those who said give us our inheritance on this side you can read in the new testament of those and the effect of those staying on this side of jordan come on the tribe of god are you hearing me it was of the gatherings where there was that demon-possessed man there's an effect of staying out of the promise and they did not want to go on in to the promise of god they let me just say it plainly they were fine with being where they were they had come out of egypt they had walked through the red sea and here they were they were fine hate let us just dwell right here this is an okay place to raise our family we can have you know our cattle we can have all of this they settled down right there even in the midst of the 40 years they had no ambition i'm talking about spiritual ambition to go over even when they went even when god and and spoke to them that you must pass over with your brethren and you must fight alongside with them and once the land is subdued then you can return back across jordan and go back to your inheritance even seeing think of this these people saw giants whipped in the land they saw him taken down they had testimonies moses held a testimony meeting in the second third fourth honor remember which chapter of deuteronomy and begin to let them know that there were others that were not of the election but they had taken down giants you know why god gave them that portion are you hearing me now this is why you know there there be those that cannot see and walk within the light of the word but you know if they're able to live according to the portion that all that god has given them they will be blessed within that part are you hearing me but after seeing all these things supernaturally what god is doing it still did not rise anything within them i tell you friends if there ever ought to be an hour of real spiritual ambition this is the hour for spiritual ambition this is not the hour to become complacent this is not the hour to let down your garden let me say it very clearly it is not the hour to be occupied with the distractions of the enemy you cannot fight the devil by veering away from the word the only way you can ever fight satan is standing upon the word of god you might say i feel so weak let me tell you something the weakest christian that'll stand on the word of god it's more than a match for hell because it's the word every failure has taken place when god's children when one has let down on that word when satan can somehow get him to think or feel that their weapon is not greater he's disarmed him right there incredible to have a sword in your hand and yet be disarmed to not have confidence to use it that's satan's desire oh but we want to we want to be we we don't want to be caught listen friends in this hour if there ever was a time we need this is why we need the discernment of the holy spirit even as i heard the prayer go up tonight and i i believe our prayer should be in here tonight god let that discernment of the holy spirit ever pulsate my life lord as i'm reading the word as i'm listening to the message when i'm in prayer lord god i'm trusting in you remember brother branham said that that white horse rider as it was he said satan oh he said he can outdo the theologian he said but there's one that he cannot outdo and that's the holy ghost that's why we were made to be led by the spirit of god we do not trust our flesh or our abilities or how much we know we want the spirit of god to speak to our lives let me tell you something whether you know it or not you're still living in these flesh bodies it's easy for things to become common it's easy we have to battle against that we have to battle against things getting to a place to where now we become covered around with the veil of complacency then you know i'm all right and you know i believe that god sent a prophet i'm in the message i i really believe that that god's done a work in my life but when god has done a work in your life it is not so that you become a spectator it's now there are promises to be taken there's mountains to be taken they're cities to be brought down we're not we're not to be spectators now that the holy ghost has come that's the weapon that we needed to take down the giants that's the weapon that's needed to take every promise of god we need it but the veil of complacency i say oh god tonight let that veil of complacency let it be exposed tonight lord i say for every one of us oh god let it be exposed because we want to be people in this hour a pulsation of spiritual ambition what is it we've got a promise in this hour we're not preaching a promise to come we are preaching the promise of the coming of the lord the rapture it's upon us we have stepped into the cycle of that word do you realize we are experiencing the benefits the benefits of stepping into the cycle that has been opened to you and i is that right the prophet told the prophet was told by the angel of the lord before the for this great momentous decision that thou hast made it is my decision and you have made this decision this choice because of that a huge portion of heaven awaits you not just something over there we are recipients of the effects of that choosing right now brother samuel what did i have to do with it it was your choice but remember you came under the influence of the mind of almighty god [Music] when jacob spoke there in the book of jail genesis and jacob could say to this tribe you will be here and this tribe you will be here and this tribe you will be there it was not a maybe soul it was a certainty by divine inspiration that was tied into the names of those tribes and when joshua stepped on the scene what did he do he moved into that same channel of inspiration that here were the people that was promised now was coming into the effect of that promise or if we could say it tonight the cloud of many witnesses are looking over the banister of time do you realize why this book when this book has become open it's a cloud of witnesses now it's the voice of god that has thundered through every type in the scripture don't seal it up any longer but take the seals off of it amen let the seven fenders let the voice of god begin to speak it's god's voice it speaks through esther god's voice speaking through rebecca it's god's voice speaking through esther it's god's voice speaking through david and what does it say it is saying that my life was the prophecy concerning your life i wish i could preach how i really feel that's a friend this is the reality of where that we are living at in this hour it's a precious reality that god has committed into our lives into our hearts let me read here a portion of the scripture in colossians chapter 2 verse 10. and i read i read out of this one last week but i want to just read this this portion and ye are complete in him in him we are complete you see that that part that was that god placed within you that seed there was there was a thirst that you had for god and only he could satisfy that that seed was a womb a place that was jehovah jireh prepared for himself are you with me now that he himself now when he pours in his life and his spirit through the redemptive work of calvary now the holy spirit coming down what does it do it quickens that seed it now brings forth a new creation not the old man made over not a new coat we don't need a new coat you have to put a new man in that old coat because you can put a new coat on him a new shirt on him but he still has the same desires but if you'll deal with the desires on the inside then that change on the inside will manifest or declare itself through the old coat and you're complete in him i love that but i oh my we we're complete in him he is our perfection all that we have need of is in him is that right and we're in him and he is in us which is the head oh my of all principality and power in whom in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands so now this is not a circumcision by man which was given in a type in the old testament circumcision declared everything that's in the covenant belongs to you is that right you are part of the fellowship of the mystery you now have fellowship in the mystery fellowship in the covenant you see this is what they were asking for on the day of pentecost what must we do to be saved in other words let me just try to bring it down in layman's terms what have we got to do to be a part of this they saw something but they needed they knew there was something that was real that was there and they wanted to know what must we do to be saved and the prescription was given repent that's first of all and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins is that right now peter had the keys there that's the revelation of father son holy ghost is that right he's what is he doing he's showing this is the path into spiritual blessings now that goes together repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins in other words the cutting off of all the past sins right but he's still got to deal with that sin nature see he forgives you of all all the past sins everything that was done in the past it's all forgiven but now when the holy ghost has come it brings forth that life on the inside to where the desires are no longer there it's a new creation that's the capping work of the holy spirit can i take my time here a minute i should be able to in the pastor but justification that's a work of the holy spirit it's not a man bringing bringing conviction to your heart it's the holy spirit that leads you lead it's the goodness of god that leads us to repentance then a further work of the holy spirit brings us to sanctification what is sanctification when we think differently you think differently about sin it's a it's a purging where there's things that i'm not doing this and i don't do this and i can't do that and i can't and we're saying i can't do this and i don't want to do this because we really we don't want to be displeasing to the lord but then there's a further work of the holy spirit a capping a capping is a finishing work to where he comes down and he brings a change on the inside where that seed that is laid there is now brought forth to life and so it's no longer you and i looking at well i i'm not not supposed to do this or i shouldn't do that but now there's a desire to fully please the lord in whom you also are circumcised with a circumcision made without hands so it takes the holy spirit to take the word and and bring the word to become a sword the word is a sword is it not but remember it's only as strong as the hand of faith that'll yield it right so there had to come a faith there had to come a faith that was able to handle the sword of the word in order to bring forth what the word was calling for god promised he would restore the faith he's restored that there was a vessel that was chosen and ordained by god to be moved into that realm that faith to where the word itself would be able to move in down to a life to cut away egypt in other words no lien of debt satan has not one lien on a born-again christian are you hearing me now he has not one lien because you can have a deed to a house deed to a property and you know you got a deed to it but there might be liens against it so-and-so ain't paid that twenty thousand dollar water bill right they'll back taxes on it did you got a deed to the land but you got liens against it the deed comes with believing the word but the holy ghost is the abstract that goes down and clears off every debt that was ever against you in whom we are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands in putting off this is what paul was talking about in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of christ he's speaking of that old nature that's what the new birth comes for is to do away with that old nature we i've used this example over and over you know what happens if you snap off a weed you come to find out quickly why they got little tools that got that little splitter on them right there because you know why sometimes you got to get down in there and get them when they got a taproot or they've got those those other spread out route you got to get in there and get it because if you don't get it it's going to come back it'll look pretty good for a while but it'll come back circumcision by the spirit of god it goes to the root now notice buried with him in baptism wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of god through the faith of the operation of god that's the holy ghost who hath raised him from the dead so when the holy ghost has come we are risen with him where are we risen with him in spiritual places where are we risen with him above every devil above every disease oh brother samuel we're still in this body but he has triumphed over satan's trinity death hell and the grave he rose up and said i was he i am he who was dead and am alive forevermore [Applause] he was given testimony that there were more that's going to come forth they are dead right now but they're going to come forth he went talking about out of the graveyard this is where he goes on to say in verse 13 and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh this is where we were held we were dead that seed that was laying there the whole time but yet could not be manifest as a son of son or daughter of god the uncircumcision of our flesh hath he now hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us took it out of the way nailing it to the cross and having spoiled principalities and powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it how sad it would be to read this and put it all back there on jesus and not to recognize that what he's did he made a pathway that you and i can come into this victory and it's not me that it's not my victory it's his victory living inside of my life we are victorious because he has overcome and because he has overcome now with that life inside of you and i we are made more than conquerors not just a conqueror napoleon was a conqueror the right hitler was a conqueror many were conquerors but it's more than conquerors because the ground that god has given us there is no retreat there is no losing this crowd when that victory has come we are more than conquerors we're not going back because there's nothing to go back to our lives have been changed we are more than conquerors [Applause] our victory has come the right way our victory did not come by drunkenness and people making deals in the back room but our victory came because our heavenly father came down in the body of flesh [Applause] the great creator became my savior and all god's fullness dwelleth in him he came down and he prevailed he overcame he was pulled against his will are you hearing me now there was a war that went on in gethsemane preach with me now we're going somewhere there was a war in gethsemane in the garden there was a war remember there was a war in the garden in the beginning and that war was lost there but in gethsemane [Applause] in this garden [Applause] may i say to you in this garden because he prevailed there in that of the oil press where his life was surrendered out now we the garden of god what is it it's christ prevailing in his garden [Applause] nevertheless not my will thine will be done is that not daily but what is it greater is he that's in the garden more than conquerors it's the life of the word that's moving within our lives notice this is the badge a believer this circumcision it's the badge of believers because this circumcision is the baptism of the holy ghost is that right it's the sign paul would write in romans 4 11 he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised so the faith itself it was stimulated now let me just go back a little bit in the message faith is a victory brother branham says abraham heard what god had done in the days of noah are you hearing me now what do you say but the same thing ain't written in the scripture but let's look at it here all right because you realize that enoch all of this here enoch was still around when adam was living they were in the coffee shop together he could hear adam talk about how the presence of god came down i mean it had to be a coffee shop but you understand what i'm saying but abraham brother abraham said what abraham did he heard and what god had done with noah and what it was about is how god had made himself so real he said to abram ask god lord make yourself real to me like that i'll tell you this brings it down to where you can put it in your lunch box he heard he heard what god did through noah and it caused him to say lord speak to me like that and he did and the lord said get thee out of thy kindrigan [Music] abraham did not do everything all at once but let me tell you something he made a move oh preach with me now he made a move there had to be some that he brought with him they had to pass away god had to allow things to arise then what everything was happening is god was stirring and stimulating his faith in the promise till eventually he would come to this place when he would meet god in genesis 17 and god would let him know i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect how can a man be perfect in himself he can't but if god opens up the way there's only one thing with god is perfection god was declaring i'm the life giver i'm the almighty god and the covenant that god said i'm gonna make my covenant with you now remember his covenant was i have already i have already i have already god had confirmed it now god what he confirmed he's going to vindicate it personally to abraham he's letting abraham know that what i confirmed back there are you hearing me now how i came down on the houston coliseum i confirmed my word what i've revealed and vindicated now i've come to you personally that i'm calling you i've come down to knock on your door can brew put you in the covenant with me when god comes down on the scene like he did with gideon god sent his word there was a prophet on the scene is that right after the prophet passed off the scene the angel of the lord that accompanies the message was still right there to take the message because that message god is not gonna let that message fall to the ground that message is gonna find its way into the heart of the elected gideon had heard it gideon was sitting in the meetings but now it came time for a personal visitation get in you've got to pass through the little room it's a personal visit in other words there's got to come to where that this message is not just something that's outside here but that message now it moves into your heart get in to where that your life begins to reflect my desire my ambition god said thou mighty man of valor and gideon turned around and said who else is here besides me because you want to know why gideon did not see himself as a mighty man of valor but god wasn't looking at his flesh anyhow what god was seeing down on the inside a mighty man of valor is a life that can be touched and will yield to the voice of god and will ask god to come and fulfill his word he will just take something presuming but it'll say if god be with us then where be all the miracles get in saying i just don't want to hear it i want to see it in my life god said that's it right there go in this thy night what's his might it's the strength of the lord confirming his promise glory be to god get in had a moment right there thou shalt smite the midianites as one man the angel of the lord brought that message it's a message of unity to the promise of god oh lord have mercy there's all sorts of golden nuggets on those blank spots but let me just try to to bring this this point down here where abraham was at think of this in our lives this this circumcision remember god let it be known that there's going to be opposition there's going to be things that will come when they would get over into the land they now was a dispossessing of all the inhabitants but they couldn't do it without the promise of god in their life you'll never be able to dispossess the inhabitants without the promise of the holy ghost in your life yet it takes the promise of the holy spirit listen friends there's battles that all throughout this building right here tonight when we cross over into the land of promise into the baptism of the holy ghost it doesn't do away with wars and battles are you hearing me now where the war in the battle stops is on the inside are you hearing me because that's the battle you need to get stopped first once that victory's won there then you've got the victory that'll it'll prove through every other victory every other battle it's strength it gives you strength faith is the victory that overcometh the world oppositions are there things are there before us but it's faith that is the victory faith that is the victory now i wish i could just i wish i could just keep preaching here but let me just try to finish this part up here a little bit and we're not even going to get to that but i want you to think of this abraham brother brown would place it like this in the message confirmation and evidence and i know this is very simple but when abraham was getting old and the bible said that his body was as good as dead what you think he met el shaddai or he met the same god that he had met in other places through vision dreams lights are you hearing me see god has many listen god gives you many experiences and you might and sometimes we well you know i've had this experience and it may not be the capping experience but don't despise it let it build your faith because listen let me tell you something not everybody has them experiences it's only when god deals with you know why the presence of god comes around your life is because it takes the presence of god coming around to start to awaken the seed even though it doesn't maybe quicken it right away it takes the presence of god to begin to awaken the seed to the promise of the one that is right there before them [Applause] that's why brother bram could say he said a son of god talking about the eagle in the chicken yard talking about the prodigal son he said ex-son of god can go a long time before recognizing who he is it's why staying in the presence of the word oh my lord have mercy friend this is the simplicity of the obedience if you'll stay under the presence of the word the god who's dealing with your life the same god who's dealing with your life he's not an indian giver he's not there to play with your emotions the god who deals with your life is there to move on your life and do a real work on the inside i'm telling you there is nobody that's more true than jesus [Applause] i can promise you things and i'll have to text you and say can't make it brother ray sorry not able to do it today but not jesus he don't have he's not looking for an excuse he don't have to say can't meet that one he knows and he keeps every appointment [Applause] your situation is not too big for him he blotted out all he triumphed over all principalities [Applause] hallelujah abraham getting old his body his body brother joshua was speaking contrary to the promise maybe his hunch got gotten more maybe he was having to do the arthritic stretches getting out of bed oh where are you at now well half hour after waking up sitting on the side of the bed now his body was as good as dead now we know that was life he could not reproduce any more children but you understand his body was as good a dead in other words god let abraham get to a place that he has he brings every seed of abraham to where god says i don't need your help this birth this birth this transformation it's not you doing something i do not need your help i don't need you to manufacture something i just need you to get to a place to where you realize i can do nothing without him and god said praise god i've got him right where i want him now let me make myself known as el shaddai you're weak i'm strong [Applause] hallelujah he reveals himself that i'm stronger than any habit i'm stronger than any desire i'm stronger than any family strength i am greater than every affliction i'm stronger than any bruise that happened in your life i'm greater than any broken heart i am greater i am your provided lamb i didn't have to preach i believe i'd run [Music] he was good as dead can i read this to you brother braham said he was good as dead but he could look down to this sign in his flesh and know that it was god's token that he'd keep his word circumcision look at the evidence and say god made the promise look at the evidence in your life and say god made the promise because it's the holy spirit that brings it to pass he's the enforcer of the word sarah said i'm 90 and i'm far past any act of life but then abraham could turn and look you catching this sarah could say this but abraham had a place to turn and look to oh my we're not looking way off in some distant land we're looking unto jesus and might i say this i don't have to look to this building i'm looking to the living lord jesus that is veiled inside of our life it is the seal of the living god the holy spirit has brought thee i was the i am and that i will be to be present in our lives i'm not looking somewhere else i'm looking to jesus a lot of discouraging things can stand right before us the enemy will come at you one way but he said i'll smite him in your presence david said thou hast prepared a table in the presence of mind enemies [Applause] what's a table it's where you eat we are feasting on the work of all almighty god sarah said this is not possible it's too old you can listen whatever your need is you can put that right in there the doctor said this my husband said this my wife said this my family said this my boss said you can put anything you want in there my children are this or put it all in there but abraham could turn and look at the evidence you've got something to look at don't you let the devil steal your eyes and focus them on those things hallelujah i'm speaking denied by inspiration stand still and see the salvation of the lord those egyptians that you see and that you hear you ain't going to see them no more after this day stand still and see the salvation of the lord i'm talking about the blessings of the lord this is the pathway in the victory the pathway of our rejoicing oh god abraham could turn and look at the evidence that god had said and said this is a token and abraham could give glory to god and be stronger than ever because it was a token a confirmation that god was going to grant it to him he could look at the unfailing work of el shaddai in his life he was drawing strength from the strength giver situation presented itself brother dave that was there to challenge challenge the promise in his life the promise that god give remember he turned and looked at the evidence in his life and said but god made the promise satan can say you're not going to make it you can turn to the evidence in your life and say god made the promise it don't have nothing to do with your feelings i'm thinking about the prayer letter right now that the prophet sent out he said it's time for you to doubt your doubts and to believe god's word and to begin calling anything contrary as though it were not that's abraham's seed oh brother samuel that's make believe it ain't make belief because we realize who art thou on great mountain before zerubbabel thou shalt become a plane you know what that is an announcement of of the working of the holy spirit that would be present in the sons and daughters of god in the last day there would be great mountains and great opposition but there is a greater one than the mountain that is before you and that is almighty god el shaddai you can look at the evidence in your life and say god made the promise i'm not here by myself you're not by yourself he said i'll be with you even in you to the end of the age [Applause] [Music] can i read one more same message now look back where you once were look where you've raised up to now you died with christ you were buried in his name you raised with him in resurrection spiritually tonight according to the word we are now risen with him sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus and every conquered devil under the feet of him sitting in the living presence of the lord jesus oh if that ought to give you a hold on something to see him with that same evidence that same faith that was once delivered to the saints now in operation doing the same things today that it always did see the appearing of the lord jesus among us and looking back and see where we once were and now where we are now see we're not looking back like lot's wife [Applause] lot's life was looking back to what she was still tied to she she turned her head but it was stealing her heart and eventually she's turned out as an overcomer she started out as an overcomer but eventually she started hearing cries coming from sodom things have started tugging on her till eventually she turned around and looked back and she became a pillar of salt this is why jesus we utter those three words remember lot's wife she started out an overcomer but eventually the world overtook her you know why because she didn't keep going on it's obeying the voice of god it's keep moving on walk in the light as he's in the light see we look back to where we once were see when we we look back we're not looking back with a longing to go back god remember god would tell israel remember where i brought you from that's part of battle plans let me tell you something that's part of battle plan when you can look back and realize wait a minute i didn't get my i didn't bring myself out god brought me out oh brother samuel that's pretty simple the same god that brought you out there the same god brought you where you are now is the same god that'll take you on you see what it does when you look back you're it's faith in el shaddai who's present in your life and that's why even when you're approaching the baptism of the holy ghost where god has brought you from the same god that brought you and turns your heart some of you wouldn't even sit in a meeting like this you might have been raised around it but you didn't want you didn't want nothing to do with you were out there sowing your wild oats and everything you had another i don't want nothing to do with that or what what turns you around help me preach now what turns you around god turns you around you got to get pointed in the right direction you pull up to somebody and say hey you know what um i'm lost honey okay where are you going that's the first thing they're going to ask you right where are you going well i'm trying to get to so and so and so and so and they'll tell you all right you need to go make a left right here and you go down this way you see what it is they've got to get you going in the right direction you and i were headed in the wrong direction but god's the one that brings us and points us in the right direction and the same god that does that remember it's a path into the spiritual blessing that same god he's right there walking with you to guide you all the way man i'm not a man of myself but lord have mercy we were dead then and now we're alive and as sure as we were dead and buried with him we've raised with him in the resurrection for we've raised up from down there oh brother brandon said i feel religious now we're dead in our lives as hidden god through christ and sealed by the holy ghost i look back and i see where i once was that william branham died 32 years ago and now we're a new creation in christ already raised with him and sitting with him now in heavenly places with the authority of his promised word that every devil is subject to us in my name they shall cast out devils in my name it's the presence of god in the life of the believer you see this evidence is just where we come to as paul could say in philippians 3 3 for we are the circumcision which worship god in the spirit and rejoice in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh you see with this circumcision of jesus christ we're united with him in a union remember here within the old testament that circumcision it pertained to the male every male child right but the only way that that of of the female could become into that of the covenant it came through marriage it came through a union are you hearing me there's many places in the scripture we could go to even when the daughters of zelaphia zolofi had their father passed away right he had no sons so what happens to his part in the inheritance and that inspiration moved upon the daughters of zelafia you know they they could have sat there and said well we don't our dad didn't have no sons there isn't you know our inheritance is gone you say brothers tell me what was that it was more it was more than just a natural desire it was the inspiration of the holy spirit that moved upon those daughters and they asked shall our fathers inheritance pass away our father who stood with caleb and joshua he agreed that the land was for us oh they had a testimony in their home our daddy stood with this message our daddy stood with this word moses took it before god and when he took it before god god said that's right but the only way they can have of that inheritance they must marry within their own tribe because you see that land cannot pass from one tribe to another what god has in ordained for you cannot be passed to another it's been ordained for you spiritual blessings in christ jesus this is our inheritance and through union we come into our inheritance that union is the baptism of the holy ghost that union is the circumcision that union is the seal of god that union is the new birth let's pray heavenly father as you spoke lord by inspiration through david that lord the path of life thou wilt show me the path of life and in thy presence at thy right hand our pleasures ever more in the fullness of joy not the joy that the world would give but a joy that you give lord that joy that is it was wrote in the time of nehemiah the joy of the lord is our strength lord the joy of the lord it's our strength in these temporary dwellings in these temporary booths in these tabernacles it's the joy of the lord the lord is you wrote here in the word where the blessings would overtake the blessings of the lord the blessing travels through the word lord as david could make that request lord this is the very desire of our hearts lord order my steps in your word lord david the lord would express through the psalms he was expressing what we as lord as believers that have been born of your spirit when david would say teach me lord quicken thy word to my heart lord teach me lord your word david was calling upon you lord that that word that you would come you would quicken the lord you would teach him lord that that word would come to pass in his life david was speaking under inspiration for what would be restored through the lamb of god where lord you would stand there upon earth and say the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing that doeth the son likewise that was restoring back that was a restoring back to us the lord would not be us learning from the hands of a man you use men but it's you it's not man man cannot give understanding to man it's you lord you're the teacher you gave yourself lord to the church you're our tutor you're a comforter lord that god it's you that comes lord and and reveals your word and lord we're we're asking o god that you'll continue to reveal your word to our hearts lord like david can say their lord in the psalms teach my hands lord to war teach us lord like joshua went up before jericho he was asking you teach my hands to war in this battle lord oh father i pray tonight lord as we're standing here lord in your presence and lord jesus every need that's gathered here lord may hearts that lord that you've touched and and stirred but maybe they haven't come to that place yet but lord i can rejoice with them that they've repented they've been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ we can rejoice that lord they're standing there and there's a sanctification moving in their life we can rejoice in that but god we rejoice and with also an encouragement to say press on to perfection let let god finish the work in your life let just just keep continue to yield to his voice continue to yield to him and things that are not under understood and you say i maybe don't understand but when you hear his voice speaking to you invite him to say lord come abide in my home and teach me lord take lord the bread and break it lord lord reveal this word to me lord come lord make yourself real lord to my life to my heart lord oh granted lord father hearts and lives lord those lord those of us lord that dear god have come lord into that circumcision by the grace of god we didn't bring ourselves there we didn't make ourselves good enough we couldn't lord lord it's like abraham when he come to a place where he was as good as dead and you stepped on the scene lord i pray heavenly father tonight o god that lord throughout this building lord there's no doubt lord what you said in the word where it spoke there that particular scripture the lord will cause will smite thine enemy that would rise up before you lord every devil every sickness every disease lord i i all i know is to say how you came to the prophet because i could stay here all day and try to name off everyone but when you came to the prophet and that serpent lord came there on the roadway it said speak the word and bind him. and it said it's this and all else is bound that's the authority because it's not a man's word it's you lord the head the head the author you've come to your body the marriage of the lamb is come oh god how thankful we are that you're our husband lord god it's our delight you're our head the key of david is upon your shoulder you let us know i'm your provider i'm your protector i'm here to teach you i'm here to lead you oh i'm your victory i'm your strength when you feel like you can't make another step where you you are weak i i'm your strength oh dear heavenly father granted tonight lord lord we're not going to look at the opposition like like abraham lord as you spoke through your prophet right there sarah said i'm too old abraham but god oh jesus abraham yielded himself to be a channel he could not change serie i it had already been spoke to him you called her sarah but she needed to have that revelation on her own abraham did not go into the tent and try to convince her but god he became a channel a channel that lord god that you could move down lord in a visitation and deal with sarah's heart lord though her name that had been pronounced over her sarah but oh god that was to awaken that one on the inside that would that would yield to the breath of almighty god oh lord god it was to call the eye to a place in syria's name to where i would come to a place of submission and agreeance with the word to realize i can't do this then the same one who brewed upon the earth in the beginning luak elohim could breathe there into sarah's life oh glory be to god her name was no longer sharia she was identified by the breath of almighty god glory be to god is that not what you did father when you called your disciples together in john 20 you called them together after the resurrection and the bible said you breathed upon them and said receive ye the holy ghost you was announcing to them that the coming of the holy ghost was the breath of almighty god hallelujah the same one that could remove the eye from your name and place the h the one with uplifted hands hallelujah who swore by him there is no one greater glory be a god in the highest oh jesus abraham could turn his eyes and we as your children tonight can turn our eyes from all all objects of unbelief words of doubt we got an evidence to look at lord we could go to a we could go over there to israel i'd like to go there someday we could go there and we could look at an empty tomb but we've
