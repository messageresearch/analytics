discouragement through every mistake through every faith that same Victory one day we'll swallow up and we shall be changed Hallelujah Oh Glory we're going somewhere we're going somewhere amen don't you love the Lord amen I'm gonna let you have your seats just for a moment here brother Brian just stay up here with me if you don't mind hey man you can if you want to sit just for a minute you can but um I just want to uh um go over that what I mentioned last week of the Christian family event and I uh want to just encourage you to sign up out there and um if if if you're a procrastinator this is not the time to be a procrastinator because there's the things that what we have to plan on the event and I know I've asked you for something within that that event of having that and making that be able to happen that's been that's been in the planning in the works for for some time and uh it's something that I just believe that God and His grace to provide to us to just enrich our lives and I want to just say something here just very clearly whether it's myself or any other minister no man is an expert on the word of God so I don't want you thinking or even approaching in that way because that can sometimes be intimidating that's not at all in in that or even in in any part of it our lives are to we want our lives to be enriched by the Holy Spirit I I want to be the best that I can be for the Lord and you know there's sometimes there's things like I've said before that you know when they gave us when I I got my first vehicle that had an auto start on it I didn't know what the button was and I really didn't care about that button it's just the vehicle it had the low mileage and I was getting it for a good price you know because it wasn't one of those that everybody was seeking after and uh and I'm talking about the car that Benjamin has now and you know I'm I'm already up there to sign the deal and and so I just get to looking at the key fob where they're over there you know doing the stuff at what is this I've never seen a button like this it's got one of them three quarters of a circle what is that and uh so I know now that's almost standard equipment on car right so you know and I got to look at that button and I thought what is this so there was another gentleman just kind of looking out the window and I said sir I said can you what is this button right here now what if I had to walk down to that dealership because I really didn't it didn't matter it had auto start or not it was just a good deal the car was but when that man came over and he could speak and say hey this right here you know what that is I said no you know what he just didn't tell me he picked it up and he says watch deep oh my goodness this has auto start too now mind you I'm thinking about when I was still teaching I was thinking about getting that car oh man I can get that car positioned just right to where when I've got so much time in the classroom I can just step out there and go beep beep go copy some papers and then when I get in it'll be nice and warm and hopefully them seats turn on and you know I mean you know you start thinking about that but what was it it's what I already had and it's just making me more aware of it and I just say it like this and that's what listen that's what the Holy Spirit comes to do in our lives even even listen the preaching of the word even makes you and I aware of we could never even come to a place of a new birth outside of God stirring up and making to us know what the desire is he's placed within us and it lets us know this is your right this is your privilege as a Son of God and then after the New Birth has come what happens the Holy Spirit just continues to unfold to you and I our privileges and we've got a right and an authority to act upon them so I just want to encourage you because this is this event it's for it's for the entire church body and I know I mentioned to you and I said hey if you feel if you find you might be working on that day I I would just ask you with two months in advance um consider taking off for that and you might say oh brother Samuel what well let me say this when it gets to the end and anything that we get in God and receive from God it's worth more than any overtime yeah any amount of money and there's sometimes there's things that what happens is it's just a missing piece within there and I know sometimes we think um we can you know get in well I've Beyond this or beyond that but how many times how many of you can witness when you've read in the scriptures you're listening to the message and you'll hear certain things you're like wow I never heard it like that before and how many times you listen to that message how many times you read that scripture right I don't know about you I mean I've even I've come through that Weekly I come through as I'm listening I'm like wow it's almost like a I mean it can be a message that I've been listening to because a lot of times when I'm in a series I'm listening to certain messages and I'm just it's going on sometimes within a series of something I can listen to those messages I don't know how many times that God puts on my heart but you know what it's things that'll Stand Out whoa wow okay now the picture so I just want to say this to me the spirit of this age says I'm rich increase with Goods yeah I don't need no more I got it are you hearing me I got it but the spirit within us says Lord I just need more of you and even if my children are already at the point and raise and I'm in that transition of being independent but this right here because I am one of your children it can open up things for me of how that you're working with my life is that right brother brother uh Barry is also um I've I've been a part not of this exact uh um series but there's some different things where I have been a partner with him and brother Barry will go into a lot of things he'll bring certain parts in of the Jewish Family and really establish that in and setting that forth here in this and there's the reason I say about the sign up because we have to know with food and I have we have to know with copies because the things you're getting you'll be able to write on and it's not and once you understand it's an opportunity if you have a son or daughter and I'm saying this for our assembly if you have a son or daughter that maybe they're not serving the lord but if you can say hey would you like to come to this right here because it's not going to be if I can just say it in this way you understand it this is not going to be Hellfire and brimstone preaching this this is not what this is but it's an opportunity even that to witness because how can you speak the word of God without his nature being displayed so it's an opportunity also because you know look we I I want to help we want to help hearts and lives and and so it's a it's a wonderful opportunity as brother Barry and I were talking about that and I um and the reason I we need the RSVP because right now we've got over there in the fellowship hall in the Presbyterian Church we've got about the they let us know here the other day as seats of it'll seek 200. and I've got to let them know the arrangement that I want for that um and so you know I have to take into account what we have here about a hundred or so but I've already had because with in different individuals I had on my phone when as soon as I walked out of the pulpit last week I already had a text hey if you open that up if it gets open to others will you let me know first well I'll let you know you know and I and I will indeed let the the pastors know but I want to contain it here so I want to I want to do that and then I'll go through from there to the pastors and then they can move from that that point um but I already have then I had an email come in the other day I don't know that had been forwarded from the office where there was a sister who streams the services and said hey and when you when that gets opened up will you let us know and so and by the way that just to let you know that sister who emailed me I know her she's a grandma she said I'll be coming alone but I'm a grandma you know I said praise God so we want to do that and you say praise the Lord amen so I want to to me I want to really encourage each and every one of you um to be there the things that I have mentioned Brian will you give me or sister Brianna will you give me that slide of um the one who is it for I think is what I have listed on there I think it's uh yeah the next one the next one there we go when I asked for the burial where should I be with as far as in the ages and the reason we have this with any single 20 years old enough is because generally any single the first the four children it's marriage right so that's that's the first realm of focus but with this part here when we're getting into about that that place brother Barry I brother Barry's the one that gave me those directions on that that age part um because then there's also expectations of what to even to look for in certain things remember choosing of a bride brother Brian says when a man is choosing his wife he's choosing what he wants his future home to be right and vice versa and even when a wife is is choosing a husband she's choosing her future home she wants someone who's going to be a leader not a dictator a leader right one one who leads where the presence of God can come into that home and so these are things that it's very be very good for that any single 20 years old enough so uh and then the other part is self-explanatory couples and grandparents and I I just you know as I've admonished there with grandparents there's a lot of scriptures maybe God will just allow me just to preach on grandparents one day because um our my children still have grandparents and I certainly trust that every one of their grandparents are going to be there if they're not they're related to me and they're going to hear it you say why is that because I I want I want my boys even when they are not even in my home I want them to be able to sit down and talk with their grandparents about the things of God which they do I want them to be able to do that because it doesn't end when you we know in the scriptures how many knows as a as a parent that when they turn 13 or 12 and I might be stepping a little bit but it don't become autopilot that's where it's like oh man there's more engagement even now than it ever has been more engagement it turns 17 more engagement or 18 more engagement right it's continually continually engaged and those are those are such crucial years in there I'm not I'm not doing the presentation but you understand it's just something that because transition is important how many know that without the Lord Jesus raising there and when he raised the way he raised for our justification right leadership was important to move from one Feast to the next Feast so when he raised he gathered the disciples together to do what let them know this is the word that's been fulfilled now it's time to prepare for the Feast of Pentecost so it leadership is crucial in times of transition right it's very crucial for that and so how I thank God that he's not left us alone in this hour I love the last little statement in the message leadership in 65 the last message brother Branham is ministering there and he says uh he starts singing a song and he says and it's not just a song that he's making an announcement God be with you till we meet again and then the next service this communion I'm glad that Mighty Angel's still here leading us amen he's leading us he's directing us what is it God is seeing us through the transition of this Third Exodus from from the spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost into that new body God is seeing us through and I'm grateful for that aren't you sometimes the transition times can be times of uh you know scary oh what's happened but I'm glad that he's here he's the stabilizer amen that's here among us so we just love him and I just um I I just with a joy in my heart and and we're going to have we're going to have a good time on that Saturday uh you know I'm not going to be wearing a tie thank God I'll be I'll be in my jeans and my friend on my boots and it's not going to be I want you to understand it's not going to be lecture but it's it's everything there's if there's questions and there's interaction and even some maybe you want on the side to write something down and have brother Barry to answer it questions and answers will be there as well so as things even come up it's just a it's just going to be a good time together and and we're there to grow together in Christ is that right that's what we're there for we're there to grow together in Christ and so uh that RSVP is by next next Sunday because I need to start moving forward on that on that part of it um so sign up sheet is where who knows where the sign up Sheet's at by the door what door not that door by what door Brother David where's it at front door by the front door that's exactly where it's at go over to be to God don't worry brother right don't get nervous you're not back in the classroom we won't make you stay in the corner just teasing with our brother do you love the Lord this morning hey man it's good to be a Christian amen it's good to serve the Lord amen we just want to go to the Lord in prayer before we do that um sing a song that's on your heart here and we'll stand and maybe change our position would that be all right and Mana just Worship the Lord and amen [Music] [Music] you promises I can stand secure [Music] yes Lord Jesus the truth [Music] according to you [Music] unto me let's pray oh Lord that's our prayer Lord yes Lord hallelujah glory be to God [Music] oh yes Lord right upon my heart oh the truth according to your word oh Lord [Music] be done to me amen and amen let's pray father thank you Lord for your presence Lord yeah that Lord means more to us than anything Lord we're so grateful Lord for the mercy in the grace of God father just Lord I want to invite you to come in a very special way once again Lord I invite you Lord to this Pulpit Lord that you'll just come stand behind this vessel of clay Lord I just give myself to you may you just minister to our hearts the things that you see and you know that we have need of because we're your children Lord and you care about every one of us and every part of our life so would you just Lord make your care even known for every life and every heart may your presence Lord just as it's here in the building just moving so Softly and Tenderly and sweetly Lord to every life and every heart and Grant to them Lord the request that they have we give ourselves to you Lord in Jesus name amen John chapter 17 and verse 20. I'm just going to read a few verses of scripture here this morning amen say God bless you thank you musicians and brother Brian just a few verses of scripture and then I'm going to just let you have your your seats verse 20 and we'll read through verse 23. neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I indeed that they also may be one in us that the world May believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gave us me I have given them and what did that Glory do it unfolded who he was okay that they why is this Glory given that they may be one even as We Are One i in them thou in me that they may be made perfect that's complete in one right think about the example of we don't do it nowadays but remember uh brother Brandon will talk about that of the um Chinese Laundry ticket and win that ticket in order to get your clothes back to you you had to present your part that was given to you right and the one who cleans your clothes have the other part so when those two parts came back together you didn't get dirty clothes you had clean clothes so in that part within us that's been deposited comes together with him what does it release a Pure Life a born-again experience amen oh praise be the name of the Lord I in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou as loved me amen God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I'd like to continue to speak on that thought on Oneness with God working in you and just to really try to move on what the holy spirit is putting on my heart so I'm just going to um just say it in this way Oneness Oneness itself is truly a work of God you can try we can try even in ourselves to try to get even family we can try to get church we can try to get people we can even try to get ourselves and Oneness with God but Oneness itself is a work of the Holy Spirit it's what God does through US individually and through us as a body of believers so it's not an achievement of man but I say it's the greatest privilege to be United with God man has tried to unite remember the the the Tower of Babel they they United but they United under a false head they United under a wrong purpose they were trying to escape judgment but they were doing it a different way than what God had provided and so when you see that there is a power in unity but the achievement of Oneness is not an achievement of man it's an achievement of God it's a supernatural working because even to bring all of us together and I'm not on this even close to being here yet but even in this part of it right here we we can take just two people in this room and we as far as in our makeup are different as night from day but what's important is we have the same Holy Spirit the same life within us and that's really the thought line where I'm going to be working behind here today because that's what the Oneness of the working of God in us brother Brown refers to it like this and I just appreciate sister Brianna running them slides but I'll let you know I thought I'd let her know when I want to actually read one with you but brother Brown would say this is exactly what take us to this is what Jesus prayed for and um I I believe that God not only has been but God is answering that prayer amen amen that we would be one he wanted he wanted us to be one like he and the father were one that the church we as members of the body of Christ would be one together just like he and the father are one that at that day we would know that he was in the Father the father in him and he and us that together we're one what a union a Oneness that would be to see God and not not yet what a union a Oneness that would be to see God in his church till every member is just perfectly in harmony with each other and God amen now you tell me that's got to be something besides man I mean that that that's going to take the supernatural working of God for us to be to be one with God and one with each other that can't be done any outside of of the working of the Oneness of God in us that's the church that Jesus is coming for and that's when his prayer will be answered that we will be one it's the only grounds of Fellowship that God has ever laid down for himself in his church is the Oneness of himself in the people so what's the grounds for Fellowship is the Oneness of himself in the people and the only way you can have those grounds is by a union to be United with him forever so United eternally with the Eternal God perfectly in harmony with him perfectly United together a church that all both God and his church is one United together I just want to pause here just for a moment and just make this declaration he's still working on me I said he's still working on me because once my soul and that's the greatest victory has been brought into harmony with God now it's through that seat of a power that it works to bring everything else in harmony with his will and I can say he's still working on me don't worry like we said on Thursday when God rolled up his sleeves he knew what he had cut out for him so I want you to think of this here and I'm just quoting out of the message Oneness to lay this ground if you haven't listened to the message Oneness in a while it'd be good because I'm just that's just where I'm be drawing your over services he says he says stay with his word that seems like that's a pretty simple statement stay with his word but here's here's the reality of staying with his word it's simply it's to believe what he said it's to say Amen to it even when it's cutting us even as God is speaking to us even if we're not where we need to be we're staying with the word because if I pull away from the word I'll never get the help that I need but if I'll just stay right there in his presence then the word will change me because what they don't do you'll say well I don't see any change right now but the first thing that's got to be broke down in our life is our will to recognize I need changed I need some work done I'm not just bringing something to God and say here God like we've been talking about on Thursday night here I got something that'll help you out no God said I know all about you but I don't need you to give me anything to fulfill my word all I need is for you to surrender and that's I tell you that that's a great that's a great challenge but God's up for it and I'm glad the Holy Spirit comes and moves in our hearts not to demand it but to woo us too praise God stay with his words I don't care I just this we could just stay here for a Month of Sundays stay with his word I don't care how you feel I don't care how many defeats I don't care how many failures stay with his word I don't see it in my life yet stay with his word because God's word can never fail if he's made me a promise I'm going to keep knocking until that promise is made manifest in my life because I'm not dealing with a man I'm not dealing with a church this is the Living God this is almighty God El Shady eye speak into my life stay with his word to separate from it is breaking your fellowship with God true God's Oneness by the Holy Spirit and he says if you say you've got the Holy Spirit and it it doesn't agree with the word then you're not Oneness with God and that's Romans 8 16 the spirit beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God I want to read this sister Brandon's getting a workout today and me calling her name probably embarrassing I don't have to do something special for her this is God's Oneness I want to read this with you here how to Oneness this is God's Oneness when the spirit that you got agrees with his word and Manifest this word and make this word power to act the same way it did there let me just pause here that doesn't mean everybody's going to walk on the water it doesn't mean everybody is going to have the gift of healing or the gay it doesn't mean that because God has that through his body like sister shakarian so brother bam I've been praying fast and praying fasting praying fasting and I I'm just been praying that God will give me the gift of him he said sister your duty wasn't for that but it's for the praying and fasting God's got somebody else in the body for that right I mean I need my hands for eating not my feet but I need my feet for walking right in order for me to get that nice donut I got to use my feet to get there and then I can use my hands to put it in my mouth and you understand it's all working together in a Oneness for one purpose so let's say this together brother Brian goes into this next places this is a powerful statement he said let's say it together so I think let's say it together Oneness with God is to have God's spirit in you agreeing with the word all the word the whole word and to make it manifested in power that's Oneness and brother Brahm goes on to say this and he's talking about that Oneness with God if I can just jump to that third line in that he says when the power of the Holy Ghost In Me Works in you there's no disagreement the words there now I don't want to spend a lot of time on this but what brother Brahm is saying he's not saying brother kid you and I'll disagree that's not what he's saying because our our Oneness is not based on you and I agreeing and seeing every point exactly the same let me just say it if what I'm seeing and what you're seeing and we say well I know what I'm saying God has shown me this okay then you know what one of us is wrong but if we've got the spirit of Christ in us we're United with Christ who's the revealer of all things and because we're his children if I'm wrong I'm willing to say I'm going to agree with the word above everything above my own ideas about my own opinions because I'm United with him and you are a part of the body of Jesus Christ so it's not about me trying to say brother just Ray I want you to think like me I want you to see it like me we're not right no matter how Americanized you've become yeah that's a that's a joke he and I have on over and over right but you see it ain't going to happen you see so so there's no disagreement what brother talking about there's no disagreement with the word right that means that we are walking into light for all that's been unfolded and if there's something that I'm not seeing right I trust you have Grace to pray for me and say Lord the same Grace you've given me Lord would you just help brother Samuel amen I trust that way that's what I desire because it's going to take the grace of God working Among Us right so with that in mind if there's a disagreement it's not me disagreeing with the word because then when the words presented I can say Lord Jesus thank you Lord what is it our heart what is within our hearts isn't a man to the word of God oh my God so when the power of the Holy Ghost In Me Works in you there's no disagreement the words there it works oh amen it makes it what it is God made flesh in You by his word and the word made Power among you every word so in Romans 8 1 as we would look there because with the thought what makes us one with God and what makes us one with one another it comes down to the Holy Ghost the spirit of God right that's the I Unity is the indwelling of the holy spirit in each of Our Lives then we're a part in the body Romans 8 1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus because there's no condemnation in him you can't find one fault in him and when that same life is in you and you are in him there is no fault in you amen that's why brother Brandon says when we pray he only hears our voice he doesn't see us he's looking at the blood right this is why brother bam will go on to say when he dedicates a baby in standing in the Gap and he says he's holding that baby he said to think of how innocent these little guys are he said but do you realize that when you have been born again of the spirit of God you are more innocent than they are that's what the new birth produces where there is no longer a record or a case against you because you're not the same person you don't have the same desires case dismissed and the authority of the token has brought it present who do what walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of Life In Christ hath made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh no and we understand that about the law he must do this and thou shalt not do that and thou listen the law was holy the law never ever became Unholy the work of the Holy Spirit was only coming to establish the law of God in the heart of man by God's Own nature because the law was God's nature being expressed right so that's why look that's why in looking uh Malachi 4 we we grow quickly to say behold I send unto you Elijah the prophet but a few verses up from there it says remember ye the law of Moses because remember Joshua did not have a new message Joshua's message was to take the people in to what had already been spoken and that's who the Joshua is Right among us he was unveiling himself in the ministry of Malachi 4 and that Saint Joshua is right here among the people of almighty God it's taking us into our inheritance into our homeland amen we don't need another message we just need the God of this message to make it live inside of us where is the god of Elijah for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh God's sending his son his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh why that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit so there had to be a way that was made for you and I had to be a way made a way back into the holies of holies a way back into a place that the desire to serve God could come into an expression and in other words there had to come the way for a real true New Birth now think of it when Israel would be out of their inheritance when that Trumpet of the Jubilee would sound remember God said the land shall not be sold always God actually established in his word the land belongs to me now God has given it to you it's the land that belongs to your tribe and that land may have passed out of your possession but it never passed out of being yours it was always yours let me say something to you the Holy Ghost ain't something that you have to beg for it always belonged to you he made a way because that's the life God intended you to have right now it may have been away because of the fall and here we come through our birth but he made a way he came away what that we might obtain The Inheritance that's why brother man could tell us in the adoption series Jesus never left me an inheritance he made a way to bring me to my inheritance my inheritance was before the foundation of the world is that right so we understand that it makes a way for the true New Birth which is that Born Again experience so the only way that could come is God had to get himself a son again there was no man worthy right so God had to get himself a son well who was Worthy all the blood was was born right it was polluted right every bit of it I don't care you can pick the most righteous man that you would think that would be the most righteous in the Old Testament and still is not worthy worthy in order to redeem you and I but God had to get himself a son what does the son do a son packs the life the name the character of the father that's why Jesus said I am calm in my father's name it could not be a blood that was already here that was contaminated it had to be that had to be a blood cell created which was separate from man that was here because that blood it still had condemnation attached to it but there had to come a blood that was able to be shed to pay the price pay the ransom that the life of God in that blood cell could come to you and I and bring a new birth oh Galatians 6 14 God forbid that I should Glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ if I'm going to brag if I'm going to boast if I'm going to join it's going to be in the cross amen but I'm glowing in it because I am a participant in it are you hearing me now I'm not just coming and singing songs about his cross I'm coming to realization he made a way for me as Paul said by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto it in other words because through that the world has become dead to me and I'm dead to it right try to bother a dead man can't do it right right for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision so what are all these these are things that God gave the children of Israel as signs as tokens as witnesses that would be speaking of the coming of the Holy Spirit and Paul is establishing the type has now been fulfilled by the annotype you know what he's doing he's lifting a burden or a liberty that false Brethren came in and wanted to bring the church under an oppressive spirit that falls back unto what I can do salvation is not what you can do clear back from the Old Testament Jonah echoed from the belly of the well salvation is of the Lord it is of the Lord as David said that we have not been consumed for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature I love this another message to listen to that day on Calvary oh my goodness hmm Brother Brown said if the church can ever come to those fundamental facts that it's not something you try to do you work yourself up to do it's something that's born in you anybody ever put something on yours like this don't feel right right I mean I don't know about you when I maybe try on jackets I'm like hey don't feel right a lot of times if it don't feel right or you just asking what do you think about this um you know what she knows me it ain't just about her like wanting to dress me up like a Barbie doll but she knows me I made no sense in buying something I don't care if it's a dollar if you're not gonna wear it boy that's a separate subject isn't it God gives us Grace to learn don't he but it's not something we do it's not what you can do or I can do it's not something we work ourselves up into it's what we're born into so watch how Satan will come to try to uh uh do away with the Simplicity that's in Christ he tries to make it that it's something that you have to do well I've got to get myself into this right no the whole secret is is yielding to him [Applause] working in you that's real understanding it's like giving myself to him him the brand says we've got to recognize that fact recognize what Calvary did for you he says we can look at it and say oh yes that's fine but that ain't it if that son of God had to go to Calvary for crucifixion read this with me would you every son that comes must go to a country he must also have a Calvary you must have that day at Calvary well I thought I thought Calvary made a way for me it did Calvary made a way that you and I could have a Calvary well what do I need a Calvary for we had to die we have to die to ourselves that couldn't be done before Calvary the spirit of God would move on the prophets and here he would they would speak and give an utterance but it can never ever bring about the new birth in their life right so notice it says I've got to have that day of Calvary that settles the sin question Not Shake Hands with the preacher not be shook into the church not come in by letter not come in by profession but come in by birth he never gave a letter he never gave a profession he gave a birth and that's how we come in this is a powerful powerful point then from that from what the new Bears automatically we're living Christian lives see it's not when brother Bama says it automatically it's not something I'm trying to generate but it's what I'm yielding to what's there okay I'm yielding to what's there there's a new owner in the house not two heads in the house there's a new owner well we used to do things this way key phrase used to right right just like on the job sometimes it's a blessing you get a new boss maybe other times is not right right but then when they come in they've got a a culture a vision a mission and what they want to see done is that right true just like somebody moves in next door to you or in the neighborhood you're like what in the world why in the world are they painting that color for what in the world are they what are they well why was it was it the house what made the difference say it again the people new people are in there right that's what affects what's on the outside is what's on the inside then from that automatically we're living Christian Life and it doesn't mean and you see this maybe here a little bit it doesn't mean like then we're walking around like this you know if there is a we are in cooperation with the Holy Spirit there's a son a daughter of God on the inside that says be it unto me Lord yes Lord you said it I believe you said it it is done Hallelujah because through that I love this statement here this is like one of those you could just put on the put on the refrigerator because we visited quite a bit we'd see it have your day at Calvary God will have his way with you it's powerful isn't it this is like this is like one of them cans of juice concentrate you open it up pie it just keeps going you know have your day at Calvary and God will have his way with you well what happens at Calvary we die to ourselves you know it's tremendous is that dying never stops we die daily amen Romans 8 10 if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin now I want you to I'm going to read some scriptures and I want you to hone in on this part when Paul is writing about the body okay the body is dead because of sin if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin and the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you now I know Paul could have wrote on you but that that wouldn't be that wouldn't be good enough because it could be on us and it still has not come to the right place it could even be in US and still not be to the right place it's got to be in us and that us he's talking about is not my flesh it's not my human spirit it's that part that come from God that's the real you that's the real me are you with me this is what the Holy Spirit has come to influence and draw to a living reality is the real you because once that's once that right there that Victory on the inside that then the rest of it it'll be from Victory after Victory after Victory after Victory right what was going into the Promised Land I mean did they just go into the promised land and praise God this is Resort City hey I'll take another lemonade give me another you know sudden Joy you know diet lemonade unsweet tea give me another one like that hey I'll take another I'll take another Chick-fil-A I'll take no when they got into the promised land it was a battle it wasn't a picnic it was a battle media something when the love of God has come into your heart you don't have to fight for the love of God but you've got a fight to stay in Victory day after day after day after day you've got a fight to pray Factory you've got to fight against the pressures to take what belongs to you but here's the good news you got the soldier on the inside how am I going to win this battle how am I going to win this battle and then all of a sudden you're there in prayer submitting yourself and he shows up and you say wait a minute what is this right here he says as captain of the Lord's host am I now come glory be to God I'm here to Lead You In victory over your complexes I'm here to lead you in Victory through your life your makeup other things all the hurts and everything that is wanted to encroach upon your land I am here to lead you in Victory [Applause] if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwell in you so it shall make him alive make it alive to what the word that's on the inside because this guy right here is no more saved than he was I'm 20 some years ago he's no more saved but this guy on the inside this is who came this is what he came for and this guy on the inside is there to bring this guy in subjection so the quickening is the quickening power coming in to God's provided place in our life that he has reserved for himself are you with me then through that quickening that of living presence of God it then Works to bring every bit of our mortal body in subjection how many knows that's battle after battle and it isn't that we don't want to bring it in subjection but there's times it's wrestling it out it's submitting over to the Samuel I need Scripture I'm glad I'll give it even though it's not here Hebrews 5 7. how many knows what the requirement was of the Lord Jesus to go to Calvary right he was heard in that he feared he cried with strong crying and tears is that right he learned what obedience by the things he suffered obedience is not something cheap of you and I saying yeah I believe that no obedience is where we submit to it and we may not even see it out here right away but it's right here you have obeyed the doctrine of the word from your heart that's where it's at right here obeying it from my heart giving our heart in submission to God and the body will follow the heart not my not my heart following my body no Colossians 2. everybody all right Colossians 2 9 4 in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily so to thank how God himself came down in Redemption it was not a separate person it was not a lesser person it was God calmed and sending down to come and to redeem you and I and in him throughout the fullness of the godhead bodily but it's just like when you look at a development and you think of a Housing Development or whatever more within that development one will make a purchase in that development and then they will actually partition or they will section the different plots of lands to try to set up and develop it with all the roadways and everything electric coming through Plumbing all that other stuff and they will set it up in that way and what God did after Calvary he ascended back on high and got sent back the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit coming in among the vessels that had prepared themselves by the word god subdivided himself into his church so if he subdivided himself in his church then you have part of him I have part of him you have part of him it's like a great big puzzle once you get all the pieces together and this piece saying I want to be that peace I'm going to be in the center because my peace just looks the best and nobody's a more perfect message believer than me I mean you know I'm oh oh oh that ain't one that's working there that's called know it all in this if that's such a phrase right so I don't care if I'm just to be the corner piece I don't care if I'm just the guy that's got the little C with the circle on it that says copyrighted but oh God let my life be an expression that God is right here living in my life in your life no matter what piece of the puzzle I have I'm just glad to be part of the picture of Jesus Christ in this hour verse 10 and ye are complete in him well let's say I don't see everything yet in my life but wait a minute when the New Birth has come you are complete in him it's the outworking of that Perfection think of the crossing of Jordan let that just stick with you as we continue to talk about this in Services which is the head of all principality and power is anybody greater than him no no he's seated in power in our life there was a stronger one who was there but it was stronger than him right but a stronger one came that was stronger than he the angel of the Lord was stronger than that Spirit than that nature that was there amen and there was a stronger one that came and spoiled the house pulled his good and sat down and said now this is my house you were just a squatter I've come to claim what belongs to me and I've not only got the title D but I am the abstract of the title deed glory be to God verse 11 in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands now circumcision as we said before type from the Old Testament a type of what of the Holy Ghost what does circumcision do in the Old Testament it was God letting Abraham know I have accepted your faith Abraham had Faith but the circumcision was a seal of his faith Romans 4 right it was a seal of his faith what he was saying is that any time that there is something arises something comes up there will be a seal in your flesh something that you can look at when doubt arises when things comes against you you're going to have a seal that will settle doubts a seal that'll settle questions a seal that will give you strength to bring your life subject to the word that I don't know how but I know I've passed from Death unto life I know I pack within me the token the Seal of the Living God there is no doubt in him him and because of that then it'll overcome any doubt that comes in here because perfect love does what cast out all fear fears can come but perfect love said sorry there ain't no room for you there's no room in the Inn um [Music] notice what did it do they didn't do what did the circumcision do it's putting off the body once again keeping in mind that the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ now think about putting off the body of the sins of this flesh so Paul is talking about something more than just this right here because right here you still see this it's still living and breathing and so Paul is speaking of something by the spirit of God that's more than this right here the body of the sins of this flesh Paul is expressing it's the nature that God came to change is that right and by a circumcision well circumcision ain't Pleasant circumcision isn't easy circumcision is a process circumcision isn't signing our names on the book or even making a declaration with you I believe I believe a message no circumcision is where now what we have believed and said I believe it's for me God has some sharp knives a word think about it in this age that you and I are living in you know the Bible pulls it up then in the days of Saul in the days of Saul they couldn't even find a person who was a blacksmith within the time the time of Israel you know why so they had nobody to make weapons nobody to sharpen the word but when David came back on the throne there now came one who was able to sharpen knives there came now an entrance oh glory be to God there came an inference by the seventh seal the quickening power of God that could sharpen this word and cut a bride away from denominationalism that can cut a bride away from herself it could cut her away from her past and cut her right in to Jesus Christ I wish I feel like running right now I want to be to God you're going to not be that emotional shame on you did I tell you what every one of us enjoys something you may not act like me but that's all right I ain't going to be christianize you but let me tell you something I just don't get happy in here and dance I dance at home I dance in the yard I'll dance sometimes I gotta get out of the car oh brother Samuel that's just silly if you knew what I knew now maybe you won't act like that and that's okay that don't mean you're not a Believer it don't mean it don't mean as much to you but see back and forth well we're not even there today are we that's Oneness of God working in the body oh man [Music] verse 12. buried with him in baptism Now watch how Paul is bringing this how does this come about what's this process buried with him in baptism so when down in here as one comes up they are they repent from within their heart there's an abhorrance an abhorrence of a life of sin I do no longer want to serve the way of sin I want to serve God Lord forgive me of my sins I want to serve you Lord then what's the next step that's in conjunction with repentance be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that's what Paul is saying buried with him in baptism this is a sign of a grave right but here's the other part wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him from the dead so as we are laid down in there in the watery grave it is not me or somebody else whoever baptize you or baptize somebody else it's not that person that's actually raising you into Christ but that raising up is a symbol just as you have walked in to be identified with this name you say what do you mean that when God has touched your heart and you've repented of your sins then there comes a testimony that will rise up and say I am a Christian God has saved me and brother babe said you keep on confessing that and you watch it work righteousness in your life that's why we don't be baptized if we don't mean business with God we're reason we're baptized is because Lord I want to serve you right it's him that's dealing with the heart it's him that's breaking down our will it's him that's drawing us to him and then he by the spirit of God raises Us by an operation of Faith where God comes down and operates on our faith by his presence so as we've been buried with him then we are raised with him so Romans 6 5 for if we have been planted together once again in the likeness of his death we shall also be in the likeness of the Resurrection so this is here where we're taking on that identification notice verse six here I want you to watch this again knowing this that our old man is crucified that's the only time I think that it's fitting to call somebody old man I don't think it's fitting to call Daddy old man I I just really don't think it's fitting to do that you that's your personal opinion sure I'm not preaching it as Doctrine but I'm just looking at respect but this right here this is a place where you can call the old man and say you know what it's the old man that lived here why he's not that he's old in years it's that he's old he's done away with that the guy who used to live here no here no air anymore Hallelujah that our old man is crucified with him what does it mean to be crucified dead that the body of sin might be destroyed once again the body of sin might be destroyed what's he talking about the nature that we're henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin he Made A Way isn't that right he made a way the body of sin keep that in mind how Paul's working with that here because when you look at this out of souls in prison this is one of the many places but I love how the prophet States it here he said the soul of man is not the body of man it's the soul and that soul is something that that's the nature of the spirit and he says now we are dead quotes of scripture out of her Paul the scripture pulling tells us we are dead and our lives are HID in God through Christ sealed there by the Holy Spirit now it wasn't that your body died right right how many can say that's born again it wasn't my body that died and when my body that died it wasn't your spirit that died it was the nature of your spirit died and that nature which is the soul brother Samuel why did it have to be why couldn't God just clean up that Soul because that soul is still married to another husband it's the second Adam and God will not marry one who has a living husband right because that would be adultery right that's why the false church when she claims she's married to Christ but she's living in adultery because she still has another living husband how can you say that because she she holds the Bible or she'll cry it ain't about whom the Bible crosses it's what's held in here that's holding you because whatever is here that don't tie us into here something's wrong there's not a union right now that'll never appeal to a carnal man but to a spiritual man there's something about it just raise up and said that's what I've been rolling for that's it right there that's what I need why because all the time you've been an eagle and you're Desiring to come out of that cage you've tried to rise to a spot and you beat your head on the on the cage beat your head on the cage but now there's something that says you're free the penalty's been paid the guilt has been dismissed you can rise in the glory of almighty God through the grace of God that comes to lead us in Repentance and through the waters of baptism and into the Holy Ghost it wasn't your body died it wasn't your spirit died it was the nature of your spirit died oh he says which is the soul and the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if it's not it's of the world so who's controlling who Romans 8 29 everybody all right for whom he did for no he also did predestinate for what to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren simple example that comes to me right now they have those Auto shows up in Detroit or wherever now I don't know if they still have them or not they used to have an IX Center too I think right remember in the mall back in the days of dinosaurs when we actually had malls remember how they would have the car set up in the middle you're going to sit down in the car man I look good in a Camaro man man look at this in the truck man I got me a gun rack in my you know I mean you can go sit in those cars let me just say this to you when they display him in an auto show what they're displaying is is prototypes right and that prototype is letting you know this is what's going to be coming out of the assembly lines right but that prototype is not what you'd end up driving on the road because a lot of times it has other you know sometimes it might be more plastic than anything I know you say which vehicle isn't now but you understand what I'm saying right when God became man it wasn't just a prototype it wasn't just something cheap he became fully man he was he became fully he was tempted in all things such as we are he became fully but it was also a declaration there's more coming there's more coming just like it and they're going to come off the same assembly line glory be to God I've already got a covenant I mean a contract I mean a covenant it's going to be coming to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren this is what the word conform means it is it means it describes where those two stars are describes what is the essence and character and thus it's complete or durable not merely a form or an outline not just something on the outside because everybody knows everybody here no matter where you've been if you try to serve God just by what you can do on the outside now let me I have to spend a little bit of moments with this here there is something that rises in our hearts that says Lord I want to please you okay that's not trying to what I'm trying to do the outside that's not that's not what we're talking about here there has to the God begins to direct and get a hold of the heart to submit to him it's when a an individual a person becomes content with looking at well I have this or I do this or I do that if it's not from your heart let me just tell you when you're out of sight out of mind you'll do what's in your heart are you hearing me what whatever's in here is going to come out I don't care if you put it on a deserted island it's going to come out that's why it's Gotta that's why this has got to get changed on the inside okay it's going to come out no matter where it's at Under Pressure whatever it's going to come out that's why I'm gone when it could be conformed to His Image as we read last week wasn't for us to grow a beard wear a long Palestinian robe or dress or or do exactly as we say well what he did is to have his image his life in us and that reflected through us now personally say well I have I have Jesus in my heart okay I'll go along with you for that you've accepted the Lord in Salvation I'll go along with that but then when more word is presented will you go along with more word because the very one who's LED you in Repentance is wanting to lead you all the way to where he cleans you up and he fills you up he that begun the good work in you will perform it right I want more of him moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified but they're just wait to take these papers I want you to hand them out here to some people okay four papers just hand them out whoever you want to just go ahead right now and just hand them out so I want to say this now don't be doing like a bunch of school me me we are ordained to Bear the Heavenly image hey I've borne the Earthly image you born the Earthly image and we still have that Earthly image we still have those characteristics of our family right we can look back and you look like a dad look like Mom look like grandpa or whatever more you know we didn't get to go to an extra value menu and say I'll take their nose their ears and their we didn't get to say oh take that personality or I'll take we didn't get to right that God but you know what God designed it that everything even your eye color you mean my makeup my temperament you mean God God made that for a purpose God made that for a purpose okay so I want you to stay stay with me here thank you brother just wait so he's the firstborn among many brother now I want you to think of this Hebrews 1 3. who being the brightness of his glory they talk about the ones who spoke through the prophets revealed same nature through the prophets his nature never changed can you say Amen I'm God and I change not what never changes his nature right what changed his form right his form changed Elijah Elijah Elisha Jeremiah Isaiah different forms but his nature has always been the same I'm God and I change not my form changes but I don't change well how do I know it's him because I'll act the same but behind this form that I did this form that I did this for Glory and the express image of this person now here's what the express image I think I have this yeah sister Anna go ahead Express image look what this word is right here can you see that uh right up there as it says uh that word well if we can get this to work what's that word right there somebody go and call it out character that's what expressed image is his character now watch this what is it it's the marked stamped upon an instrument wrought out on it a Mark or figure burned in it or stamped on it an impression the exact expression is the image of any person or thing marked lightness precise reproduction in every respect and the last word is facsimile which is facts is that right brother Greg the facts right and who's got them four pieces of paper if you've got a piece of paper come on up here we're going to embarrass you real good come on up who got one come on now come on up all right I'll see three I ain't going until I get that fourth one sister Naomi praise the Lord but this is perfect uh you know what why don't you saying right here brother Dave come on over here and brother Shane right there and president come on up here and just know me right over there and then let me get down here now I want you to read go ahead you don't bite yo you okay okay I want you to read what you got on your paper then turn turn around let him see it okay go ahead brother Dave okay turn it around go ahead brother Shane Christ the same yesterday today for go ahead sister Naomi Jesus Jesus what's the same about all this same message right Jesus Christ The Saint what's different different colors can I see this one maybe this right here has something a little bit like this maybe this right here there's something right over here I'm gonna crinkled up right here but this one right here remember there's something right here maybe this one like this now what's the same about them the message is the same what's different the paper the colors and some of them everybody's got different hurts different things they come with but what's important is when he is there like that he's able to mend that which is torn he's able to heal that which is broken are you hearing me now he moves into that life to bring healing in that life amen come to God he's the great physician God does not look at you and say you got too much too many hurts and this was done and this was done he says no you just let me get into my position and to offer you into your position [Applause] as the Son and Daughter of God you rule over it different sheets of paper but the same God he's the same yesterday today and forever thank you God bless you keep it in your Bible we may need that again Hallelujah Hallelujah don't you love him this is why it comes down and brother Brian can say truly when a man is truly he's not truly converted until he's been changed and died to himself and the Holy Spirit has control of that person now can I just say this real quick all those tears and wrinkles and everything else that I want you to understand me now that isn't something that's done away with one night at an altar but Samuel what are you doing I'm putting a real true expectation on the baptism of the Holy Ghost but what it is God equips you as a Son of God and he says okay walls that's been built in your life walls between relationships everything else I have come to bring healing in your life because sometimes the very ways that we're responding has nothing to do with the person that we're responding to it has everything to do with the experiences and misrepresentations that we've had in the past but let me say this to you and remind you who's in you the same message and the same message that's in you it releases to your healing virtue it releases to your strength it releases to do what to be able to heal that which is broken on that paper if I could really represent it the right way that soul that soul is not what's torn that soul is not what's wrinkled it's a spirit it's that part which is in the body of sin he comes to circumcise to to separate that old nature and then as he gets on the inside then what does he do he can begin to emanate his glory to where you can look in your life and say it's not an open wound there's a scar what does a scar say I've been healed I've been healed for the son of righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings with the glory be to God in the highest Hallelujah now he said the Holy Spirit think about those sheets of paper here and I'm trying to come down the holy spirit will not misbehave itself in one person and behave itself in another it'll make each person come into its character see the Holy Spirit draws us into his character because I mean why is that important because when you look at somebody else don't try to be like them if there's anything you want to be on you say Lord I want an experience like they've got not I want to act like them because then you're an impersonator and I'm not saying that to be strong I'm saying God God comes to deal with you individually that's why his pride is not manhandled that's why you'll never hear from this Pulpit or from me something that comes down to you like that you'll never hear that by his grace and if he does you need to come to me because it's a wrong because his bride is not manhandled because let me tell you that will only last as long as you're around somebody that's like this what needs to be is a new ruler an ownership on the inside not afraid of your pastor not afraid of somebody else but a fear a reverent clean holy fear for the Lord because let me tell you something we're going to just we're going to work we're going to displease one another right I don't care how much you you might think me or you either one are the best thing since sour cream or whipped cream guess what we're going to disappoint one another because you know why we're still in this body but oh if there's a Oneness on the inside it unites with the Oneness on the inside of you what is it we've got something greater in us working in us through us than our differences than our disagreements then our opinions then our ideas and that's Rapture material when we can walk to the mountain like Abraham and say the rest stay right here I'm going to go Yonder and worship I don't know how God's going to do it I don't know how God's going to dissolve this division this disagreement I don't know how God's going to do it but I'm going to obey his word I'm going to do what offer up what he gave to me he gave you the power when he gave you the Holy Ghost to offer yourself and let the word live through you can I finish this quote it it'll make each person come into its character once again that's not something that's just pow because if every one of us are honest right now right it's amazing sometimes how with age we get rose-colored glasses about our own self well my kids never did this and not well just coach Let's go ask some of your kids because maybe what you remember you have seasonally somehow forgot I could preach on this for a minute aren't you grateful that God gives you Grace to forget all that and what you do remember about your children is that which is good that's the grace of God that's the grace of God that's a little foretaste of the marriage supper thank God for that right because you could never see him in another light right you'd always see him as the this or the that or whatever more but thank God for his grace aren't you glad for Grace has been provided for us that God is not seeing us in the light as a sinner but he sees us as one of his children we have been chosen before him in love it brings you con brings you in subjection to his character character is what a gift or a victory victory the Holy Ghost is the gift of God the character is a victory now Brother Carlos I'm not that smart but I think I know victories mean we have to have what War battles right some battles we lose some battles we've lost but guess what we ain't won the war because we are on the Victor's side yeah if I get knocked down I'm going to get back up again if I get knocked down I'm going to get back up again why I've got one in me who stood for me now he's standing in me and I'm standing for him I'm gonna get back up again I'm gonna get back up again I'm gonna get back up again hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen it'll make each person come into its character because it's a spirit that leads you it brings you and makes you subject to its nature you don't bring it subject to your nature oh we get in trouble we don't bring it subject to us it makes you subject to its nature and the Holy Spirit makes you live and love to do it Lord I'm soul in love with you you touch my heart with your grace and Lord I'm so in love not with the church not with the pastor but with you glory be to God oh how you love to give up the things of the world when the Holy Spirit comes in once again he's still he's still working on me because sometimes some of those things of the world is what's still out there in that body of sin and he's working and saying you're not going to go in that direction oh that might be a strain through your family but you're under a different strain now you're under a different stream now do you love him how it cleanses you and washes you and puts a desire in you to follow him and a thirst and a Hunger for More of it just bathing yourself he brings realities don't you love him I love the scripture when Jesus stands there and out of the book of Isaiah Luke chapter 4. and it begins to speak he's come pull that upward for me Brianna pull it up Luke 4 and I don't remember what scripture somebody it's one where Jesus is the one I've come to heal the broken the bruise pull that up for me would you please but what this Jubilee does in this Jubilee is the announcement that the atonement has been made for you you don't have to keep trying to be a better person I mean yes giving ourselves to the word but rise and take what the word is saying come back to your inheritance and listen to as the word is saying as you're in your inheritance God's equipped you but Lord I see you and this no you got to look deeper deeper yeah look deeper and you see me in you that's your overcoming that's your victory that's how walls come down of Jericho that's how cities are burned to the ground that's how strongholds are pulled down not by what you do but what you can yield yourself to I'm The God Who made the Covenant and I cannot fail you got that up there in Luke chapter four 4 18 Luke 4 18 thank you brother Brian here it is can we read this together the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to heal just sorry to set at Liberty them that are bruised thank you Lord Jesus think about them papers there might be some tears and wrinkles but he came to not only release the captive he said but I've come I've come to minister to the bruise those who've been bruised and something is has taken place that's tried to hinder the woman at the well was one come on in it ain't just about he'll Fame but she was one Rahab was one but what had to get to her there had to come a voice to her that was able to tell her this is who you really are and I want to tell you that you are beautiful in my sight Lord this I don't know I'm talking about this what I ordained you to be they were bruised scarred human beings that he came to minister and said look I'm not here just to minister to your bruise but I'll come to the inside I'll bring healing from the inside because that's real healing I say Lord as the prophet would say over and over beginning of the message middle the message in the end of the message the token in Jeffersonville what does he talk about taking the medicine taken the medicine I want to keep taking the medicine why I'm being changed from Glory unto Glory you know what it's doing it's given the real me on the inside dominion over this guy on the outside because this guy on the outside this is only like that screen that allows those words to be on it that's all that screen serves a purpose for if we turn this off right here turn that that which sends the signal all the way and send it all the way to that part right there you turn it off you have a blank screen right but that's when the light of God the Holy Spirit comes into a life it's not our body that died not our spirit but it's the soul that nature that died and Christ raises that nature he say raises that which he placed within us by the quickening power and there's a new life on the inside The Spar heads think about that son of the king he was a slave and remember one came down to buy some slaves or a slave and he looked out there across the field and he said he's seen this one it acted it just acted different he had to do some of the same jobs he wasn't the boss's pet or her pet or whatever more but he had to do some of the same stuff sometimes they ask why is he acting different do you feed him yeah he eats the same stuff does he does he sleep in a different but no he sleeps in the same bunk house the rest of them sleep in well so what what's different about him what's making him act different well I wondered that myself one day he said the owner until one day I recognized and realized he's the son of a king and he knows he's the son of a king he knows his father in a distant land is a king and so while in this land the land where he's at does not change him from being the son of a king he was born a son of a king and so he conducts himself in that way I wonder here this morning if we can say Lord that's Lord the desire from the depths of My Heart Lord maybe you've never walked fully into that part of the new birth but what an opportunity this morning to say Lord and really from your heart whether at your seat whether at an altar it matters about your heart because you could come to an altar but remember it's not an altar that does it the real altar is in your heart where you offer up and surrender your own will that's where it really takes place and you have to accept what he's already done he he's doesn't have to go to Calvary again he doesn't have to raise it he's already paid the price well brother Samuel you don't know all the baggage in my life I don't need to know it all he already paid for it all and if you can really accept it that call of freedom and liberty is going out that right now there can be a real merging in a uniting a real laying down Lord I'm I don't want to try to live it this is a miserable life trying me trying to live it me trying to do it watching his brother Samuel around but Lord I realize like brother Samuel said you don't do it for me you don't do it for a church you you do it as unto the Lord why do we do what we do we do it because of the spirit of God within us directs us to the word of God and we see it's the desire of almighty God and that same nature is working in us we want to please him we love him because he first loved us our own human love can never equate to the love of God this is why Calvary Made A Way That You and I by the love of God pulling on our hearts can lead us that we might have our day on Calvary that that love of God could do a full work and come fooling in our lives and bring about a real transformation and as we are here gathered here this morning what what a wonderful privilege what an opportunity I'll tell you this morning if I didn't have that life I would be so oppressed upon my heart and realize what a benefit has been given to us this morning has the spirit of God would put up on our hearts forget not the Lord and all his benefits the very center chapter of the whole Bible Psalms 103. Christ is the center of it all oh Lord as we remember your benefits what about us what about lives that where we've crossed over by the grace of God we we have that seal in our life we know that our life has passed from Death unto life oh we might be different paper that's true different in our makeup different in a lot of ways but one thing that is the same is the nature and it's not just what we're saying it's not just because that nature being the same isn't just because I go to a message Church carry a message book to carry a Bible quote a Bible quote the message no no that's that's not what it is it's his living presence on display in our lives remember true Oneness is the spirit in us that agrees with every word of God and it manifests itself through us so agreeing with the word of God that's a start that's a start to Oneness amen amen but I would say here this morning if there is something where it's not manifesting something on the inside where there's an amen say Lord I need thee amen of the word I need the finished work I need the so be it as our heads are bowed and eyes are closed how many I wonder if we just be honest before God this morning the holy spirit is not pulling on everybody pulling our hearts and ministering to lives this morning to let us know that there is a place to where the character of Christ remember what he he will not miss misbehave himself in one and behave himself in another his nature is the same remember I wonder if there'd be one this morning say Lord that's what I want that's what I want in my life I want that Lord and God bless you God bless your hands that's my desire Lord I want that in my life I want that I want that working Lord in my heart that character I wonder if we as we express from our hearts and say Lord this is this is the desire Lord help me daily to die to myself you've Lord made me aware I realize it but I I see it more right here there's maybe there's hurts there's baggage God's Not Afraid of the baggage in your life God's Not Afraid of the hurts he's not afraid of the where your spirit maybe has been torn been wounded been bruised but there's one in the house this morning that can do for you what no psychologist no psychiatrist I'm not against them remember his brother Ram told us he said everything that helps he said that which helps is of God I'm not against it but I'm letting you know there's one here this morning that can go down that there is no prescription they can write that will ever be able to satisfy it but there's one that can go right down and minister to you a healing brother Samuel how could that be I can't explain it but I'm a witness of it it's a paradox explain to me how that Daniel was in the Lion's Den and didn't get eaten and how that those lines was around him the whole time explain to me how that the three Hebrew children were in the fiery furnace and not only did they not get burned but they didn't even smell like smoke when they came out explain to me how that the bands on their wrist were burned off and their clothes wouldn't even smell like smoke or burnt explain it to me we can't it's a paradox tell me how God can take a man that could say I don't want nothing to do with that I don't want nothing to do with this but how God can take a man and turn that man around by the grace of God and that man will become a Powerhouse with the spirit of God living through his life his or her life in a way of humility explain that you can't it's a paradox so we're talking about the God of paradoxes this morning who comes and sits in the very middle of our Lives the midst of it I just say this morning how many would agree with me Lord make me more like you help me Lord to surrender just as I surrendered with Lord in Repentance just as I surrendered when you dealt with my heart with habits in my life just as Lord the surrendering coming to a place of fully letting down my will and the spirit of God coming and accepting and taking me into the body Lord that same surrendering Lord that equipped me to surrender to yield that's your character might come and mold my character into your own image I say Lord granted Lord in my life that's my heart's desire that's where my hands are at Lord mold me and shape me I don't want to be like brother so-and-so or sister so and so I appreciate that but what it is in them that strikes my heart if I've got the real objective it's Christ it's not them I don't want to be like them I want to act like them I want I want that same Jesus to come in me and act as Jesus would act through Samuel that's what I want just like Jesus would act on the pink piece of paper blue piece of paper yellow piece of paper white piece of paper it's still the same Jesus displayed in many forms oh my what victory when we can realize that Lord you don't want me to be like brother Aaron Brother Brian Brother Ray brother Joey brother Samuel brother Carly you don't want me to be like that you don't want me to be like so and so if I could just be like sister so and so why would you lower your sights be like Jesus quit looking at other people because other people eventually that you look at you'll see their faults you'll see their failures what should I do if you really get a clue true glimpse of that their life should be pointing you to Jesus Look Away to Jesus I say granted Lord this morning Heavenly Father hearts Lord throughout this building Lord thank you Father I want to say this thank you for helping me to get out of the way Lord that you could bring what needed what you wanted to bring there's things Lord you know in my heart and I know they don't mind me just taking this moment but I have to lord it's just it's a worship it's from my heart I'm so thankful you know Lord the very desire is I want to always get out of the way the things that you press on My Heart Lord and meditate on and wake up Lord and not praying on and looking at the word oh God help me to get out of the way that Lord that you can speak you can bring it Lord the way that you are inspiring It To My Heart Lord Lord I trust this morning Lord that I've been able Lord to get out of the way you've given me Grace to do that now father you're the one Lord who's been right here in our midst and we're all appreciative of that that we have all been able to step out of the way this morning now Lord I pray for every need Lord that's gathered here for every request behind every uplifted hand be behind every heart that Lord that even while the words coming forth that you have touched our hearts Lord we surrender to you Lord oh God we're not surrendering to a church we're not surrendering to a man we're surrendering to The Living Word of God the Lord Jesus Christ the mighty conqueror well we're not surrendering to one who's just on a power and has a bow with no arrows no no no no no no we are surrendering to him who is seated in power and on his thigh was a name written the word of God has a sword that's sharper than any two-edged sword we are worshiping the presence of the Living God who comes in in meekness and glory and Power who rides in to conquer thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord we stand this morning as children of God Sons and Daughters Lord granted this morning all that Lord that you have moved upon our hearts Lord grant it right here Lord in the camp this morning when we're gathered I ask Lord God that may there be hearts and lives that Lord are born into the kingdom of almighty God May there be lives Lord I pray that father where Lord there has been bruising and hurt and scars and everything Lord God that would want to try to hinder him and tell them why they're not worthy there is not one thing that one person could ever do to make themselves worthy Lord they could live such a life that a person wouldn't be able to put a finger on that steel is not what makes us Worthy there is the worthy one who has been offered in our behalf he's the worthy one he's the reason he made a way we love you this morning Lord in Jesus precious name hmm he made a way when our backs were against the wall and it looked as if it was all the thin you you made oh come on little Eagle there's a weight been made and we're standing [Music] mountains you move mountains you cause walls to fall with your power all you perform Miracles and there is nothing [Music] that's impossible and we're standing here only because you make it away you made a way oh you made oh my just sing it to him or just worship him personally Lord I'm here I'm here to wash your feet you made a way Lord you may [Music] you made a way and we're standing here only because this is what he'll do [Music] oh you move mountains and you cause walls [Music] it's not nothing oh that's impossible [Music] the express image of God that facsimile that facts a facts is something that's sent from one destination to another destination there's a point of transmission that sends it and there's got to be something on the other end too be able to receive it right we all have had that where you've had the facts important documents and sometimes are that important you say hey hey did you get them did you get them why because you know you sent them and let me tell you something he sent the Holy Ghost he sent the image man tried to cut the cable and block the cord but God said I've reserved a channel for myself for my image to come back into my church my character my life to come back on display he sent the Holy Ghost now you've seen those different sheets of paper right sometimes there's textured paper right you don't know what I'm talking about sometimes there's texture paper that you want for a formal announcement then you've got one that's a plain sheet of paper and then you've got once a little thicker sheet of paper than other sheets of paper but what what what is it that matters is it the paper it's what's on it help me preacher now the little boy wanted some ice cream he got a stamp out of a collection he went down to the pawn shop and the pawn shop looked at it he knew the value of that stamp and he offered the little boy hey he said I offer you five dollars little boy all you can think about his ice cream cone five dollars how many ice cream cones could I get with that that was before inflation how many ice cream cones can I get I was trying to see what he did he was a little boy he only thought in terms of little things are you hearing me now he's what was wrote on the paper but there was one who who knew what was on that paper he knew the value that was there and God in the end time once again has come down it wasn't the thinking of a man it was God who declared to you and I he took his word and he let you and I know my word is the same and I'm the Satan God and you begin to take it and play upon it he began to play upon it what did he do what looked to be of no value and was being sold nobody would even bid on it but when the master got it in his hand one who knew how to play it one who knew how to release what was trapped on the inside help me now somebody who knew what was how to release what was in here who knew how to release what was in you and I everybody else could have looked at our life bid I won't even give you a penny for his life let me take it let me get my hands on it Lord I'm of no value that's the way to come in humility but I he thought I was worth saving he shed his blood for me remember as I said the other night brother Brian said if I had three drops of the literal blood of Jesus Christ holding it to my chest he said sitting before me tonight is something that was more precious to him than this Blood because he shed his blood to purchase us in his sight what was on that stamp you know the report says it goes on that stamp who knows what has been sold for now what a little boy only looked at it in a little way is just five dollars it ended up being sold for millions of dollars did the Stamp change no did they beautify recognize what the value was and that's why the spirit of God comes to you and I to bring us to the realization of what the value of the Holy Ghost is it's more than a feeling it's more than an expression it's more than just something I feel at church on Sunday and it leaves me when I go out but it's something that comes down on the inside of the god it changes me there's an operation on the inside that changes me from an old creation to a new creation then from there it's automatically lived out what comes out of your life then well it depends on who you got on the inside right remember what we said earlier in the service whoever's living in the house they're the ones who causes the decorations to come forth but you let new ownership come in and guess what you don't have to tell that person man stop painting your shutters this color stop painting your door that color don't even match nope just get somebody in there that knows what to do and all the shutters and the doors will be will come forth you understand what I'm saying that's how it is in our life what is the value that's on the stamp the value of the spirit of God you made up a way [Music] and it looked as if it was over Hallelujah and we're standing here Hallelujah [Music] long way when our backs were against the wall and it looked as if it was over here [Music] only because [Music] before your toes there is nothing possible understanding here [Music] when our backs were against the law and it looks as if it was over for you foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] Glory Days [Music] I know you
