[39:46] Brian if we could let's stand and
[39:48] I want to read from a very familiar
[39:51] place
[39:52] in first John chapter 3 and
[39:56] um
[39:58] just some things that when we begin to
[40:01] look at a useful life here within the
[40:03] Book of Job and right there in job 22
[40:07] where we've been
[40:09] and wanting to remain as a useful
[40:12] truly a useful life I I don't want
[40:16] to just sit around
[40:19] brother Brown said I'd rather wear out
[40:20] than rust out
[40:22] and over and over and yet brother
[40:25] Brennan would balance that with the
[40:28] statements as well as is what God has
[40:31] called to be done
[40:33] he didn't lay all that burden upon one
[40:35] man as if one man feels the burden to do
[40:37] it all
[40:38] because that's that's the equation for
[40:40] Burnout
[40:41] is that right
[40:43] and uh so when we see this what we want
[40:46] to be what we want to be is is just
[40:49] available I want to always be available
[40:51] because one thing that we don't know is
[40:54] we don't know when God will use us
[40:58] and for what he will use us for and it
[41:01] might be to speak or to minister
[41:04] to someone else to testify witness our
[41:08] life we don't know but we always want to
[41:10] be a channel
[41:12] that's available to him
[41:14] and that's one thing if we can have a
[41:16] declaration in our hearts if there's one
[41:19] thing I'm going to be reserved to I want
[41:22] to be reserved to the presence of God
[41:25] that's that's the objective that's the
[41:28] Forefront that's the goal amen within
[41:31] within our lives because
[41:34] um like when you consider brother
[41:37] Stephen was mentioning ministering here
[41:39] on Sunday on the cure for fellowship and
[41:41] I want you to as you catch that it's a
[41:44] two-fold because we can look at it and
[41:47] say well that part within our life is a
[41:50] cure it was what God was Desiring that
[41:52] Fellowship but do you realize that was a
[41:56] longing that God put in your heart too
[41:59] is that right that's why brother Branham
[42:01] when he preaches and he deals with the
[42:03] messages on communion and he deals with
[42:05] a communion it's where there's a mutual
[42:08] agreement and one can speak to one and
[42:11] one can speak back to another and
[42:13] there's only one place of Fellowship one
[42:15] place of communion and that's under the
[42:18] blood
[42:19] and there's only one thing that can
[42:21] truly satisfy any heart any believer's
[42:24] heart and that's communion with God
[42:27] there's nothing the world itself I know
[42:29] we can all testify there's nothing that
[42:32] from before God got a hold of our lives
[42:35] and even yet now there is nothing that
[42:39] satisfies
[42:40] the believer like his presence
[42:44] he is our satisfying portion
[42:48] amen and we are so thankful for that
[42:50] amen so as we're looking here at the
[42:53] word
[42:54] in first John chapter 3 verse one if you
[42:57] wouldn't mind could we just ask the Lord
[42:59] just his Blessing and Leadership here
[43:01] before we read
[43:03] Heavenly Father
[43:05] we just Lord invite you Lord knowing
[43:09] that God that you're here father
[43:12] you said where two or three are gathered
[43:14] together in my name I'll be in the midst
[43:17] of you and Lord there's no greater
[43:19] desire that we would have that you would
[43:22] come in our midst may you move down upon
[43:25] us Lord move Among Us may it become Lord
[43:28] so personal Lord to each and every one
[43:32] of our hearts and our lives Lord tonight
[43:34] you know our needs Lord and father
[43:37] there's a desire we've not only come to
[43:40] worship you but we've come to hear from
[43:43] you Lord that God that when we would
[43:45] leave out of here that God will leave
[43:48] out of your lord being better Christians
[43:52] Lord we know that we cannot Lord do
[43:56] anything once that Soul has been changed
[43:58] oh God it's passed from Death unto life
[44:01] but we want to serve you better Lord
[44:04] that if there's anything Lord oh God may
[44:08] you just come and guide us Lord we do
[44:11] not Lord like Paul profess to be perfect
[44:14] but Lord we are pressing to that
[44:17] profession Lord God and Lord we just ask
[44:20] that you'll come in a special way and
[44:22] anoint us together speaker in here and
[44:25] may you receive all the glory we pray in
[44:28] the precious name of Jesus Christ amen
[44:32] familiar scripture here in first John
[44:34] chapter 3 and verse 1.
[44:38] and here John would write behold what
[44:41] manner of love the father hath bestowed
[44:45] on us that we should be called the sons
[44:49] of God
[44:51] therefore the world knoweth us not
[44:54] because it knew him not
[44:57] frankly put we're not of this world
[45:01] we're not of this world sure we walk
[45:03] around in our outer garments and we have
[45:06] oh you're from this country oh you're
[45:08] from this nation or you've but within we
[45:11] are of the Tree of Life
[45:14] Amen in verse 2 beloved now
[45:18] are we the sons of God I want you to
[45:21] notice how he draws that now to the
[45:24] Beloved are we the sons of God and it
[45:26] does not yet appear what we shall be but
[45:30] we know that when he shall appear we
[45:34] shall be like him for we shall see him
[45:37] as he is
[45:39] amen you know because we're seeing him
[45:41] right now as he is
[45:44] amen verse 3.
[45:47] and every man
[45:49] that hath this hope in him what hope
[45:54] that hope that expectation that I shall
[46:00] see him
[46:01] I'm looking forward
[46:05] to his coming
[46:07] so every man that has this expectation
[46:09] in him watch what he does
[46:13] purifieth himself now notice purifieth
[46:17] it's ongoing
[46:19] purifieth himself even as he is pure so
[46:23] what is the purpose of our purifying is
[46:27] because we have an expectation in our
[46:29] hearts we have already been purified by
[46:33] the blood of Jesus Christ and because of
[46:36] that that stands out in such a contrast
[46:38] to everything else around us and the
[46:41] more that we we stay in his presence as
[46:44] we're feeding on the word and maturing
[46:46] we even find ourselves beginning to
[46:49] distance ourself from our own Nativity
[46:54] our own upbringing our own birth
[46:58] we begin to distance ourselves from we
[47:01] always done this my family always did
[47:04] this because why we're recognizing I'm
[47:07] not of this world
[47:09] I'm not the son of Charles and Ella
[47:11] Branham
[47:13] I'm the son of God
[47:16] beloved now are we the sons of God
[47:19] so I'd like to speak here tonight if God
[47:21] will help us on
[47:23] um of the thought and I think I sent
[47:26] that to purifying by a Pure Source
[47:30] purifying by a Pure Source God bless you
[47:33] as
[47:34] you're being seated unless the reading
[47:36] of the word
[47:40] many of these things as you know are
[47:42] just you just keep as the Lord deals
[47:45] with in your study and a lot of times
[47:47] there's things that we come in that has
[47:49] been laying before us here for some time
[47:52] and and just waiting on the Holy Spirit
[47:54] and his timing to actually
[47:56] uh get to some of these things and even
[47:59] as we took that thought last week on how
[48:02] the Lord brought that with David and
[48:03] Abigail and that channel
[48:05] and I want to deal with this this
[48:08] thought of it here on this ongoing
[48:12] purification and purifying by a Pure
[48:16] Source and when you look here in verse 3
[48:19] because I I believe this with all my
[48:21] heart
[48:22] we need a continual purifying
[48:26] now once your soul let me just set this
[48:29] straight once your soul has been
[48:31] purified by the blood of Jesus Christ
[48:34] we're all unbelief has been removed
[48:37] because
[48:38] sin itself is unbelief
[48:41] all the attributes when it comes to
[48:44] dress and it comes to all the types of
[48:46] things are like those are only
[48:47] attributes that come out that declare
[48:51] they're still unbelief so when unbelief
[48:54] is dismissed the attributes flee and
[48:58] that's what the Holy Spirit comes to
[49:00] deal with is that root of unbelief so
[49:03] once the life has been pure that Soul by
[49:06] the new birth then we're not in a place
[49:09] of purifying our souls but it is living
[49:14] in a place to where as we said moments
[49:16] ago there's such a distance and that
[49:19] part we begin to see the contrast of
[49:21] things that surround us and we then
[49:23] operate and are looking to God through
[49:26] the purifying source that Lord let
[49:29] everything within me let it be pleasing
[49:32] to you
[49:33] and you find that as we grow on and as
[49:37] we mature
[49:39] that immaturity even the little crumbs
[49:43] stick out in our lives as Believers
[49:46] things that once that at one time that
[49:49] we could Overlook and it isn't
[49:51] necessarily that we were willfully
[49:53] overlooking it's just God God knows how
[49:56] to deal with our lives
[49:58] at just the right time and I'm glad
[50:01] about that God didn't leave that for
[50:03] somebody else to deal with my life or
[50:05] God knows how to deal with each of our
[50:07] lives with everything and just at the
[50:10] right time and through that maturing
[50:12] things begin to stand out and the
[50:15] changing within our lives and I mean and
[50:18] even when God is dealing with our hearts
[50:20] when God was wooing us and drawing us to
[50:23] himself remember it how it took a place
[50:26] to where for us giving ourselves to God
[50:29] giving ourselves to his word and as we
[50:32] would walk in obedience to the word we
[50:35] would find a cleanness that would come
[50:38] in our life and what would happen
[50:39] through that cleanliness is more courage
[50:42] would come for a deeper promise of God
[50:45] so the word Works in our life to really
[50:48] bring us courage in approaching the
[50:50] promises of God so notice every man that
[50:53] hath this hope in him so this is our
[50:56] expectation and I want to just say it
[50:58] with something that's very familiar to
[51:00] you and I that brother Brandon would
[51:03] tell us like this he says if there was
[51:05] one in this city that was going to be
[51:08] going in the Rapture the faith that you
[51:11] want to have is I'm that one
[51:15] and it's not about that we're better
[51:17] than anyone else that's not what it's
[51:19] about it's not me comparing myself to
[51:21] anybody else
[51:23] because we realize Paul told us that
[51:25] that's foolishness to do that but it's
[51:28] looking at the word and the word
[51:31] examining our life and we know from our
[51:34] soul there is an amen to the word of God
[51:37] and know that I have passed from Death
[51:39] unto life I know that it isn't something
[51:42] that somebody has told me I know it and
[51:45] I see the effects of it in my life
[51:48] and so that's the faith that I'm living
[51:50] by that if there's going to be one I'm
[51:53] going to be that one because I have that
[51:55] Assurance in my life
[51:58] and so then I live by that faith in my
[52:02] life and that's why brother Brandon
[52:04] could go on to say he would say I want
[52:06] to live so close to him to where that
[52:10] when I know he's going to take me when
[52:14] he comes
[52:16] I don't want to live just see how far I
[52:19] don't want to I don't want to have a
[52:20] casual approach because truly the
[52:23] thought of predestination when it really
[52:26] strikes the heart predestination is the
[52:29] unmerited grace of God in real the real
[52:32] revelation of predestination does not
[52:35] bring loose living
[52:37] sorry the real revelation of
[52:39] predestination it's simply that there is
[52:43] within your heart and your life
[52:45] something that part of God himself that
[52:48] can respond to God
[52:50] thank God for his grace
[52:53] it doesn't promote that it doesn't
[52:55] cultivate that as a matter of fact the
[52:58] word itself when we look at it it comes
[53:01] to cultivate our walk with God and to
[53:04] think about him if we're in love with
[53:06] God why would we want to live far from
[53:09] him
[53:10] I want to live close to him
[53:13] I want to I want to live so close to him
[53:16] to the to the Rose of Sharon is the is
[53:19] the aroma of my life I want to live so
[53:22] close to him to Lily of the Valley
[53:25] I want to live so that I'm I'm in that
[53:28] you know I often tease our boys there at
[53:30] home and I say if I can just get in the
[53:33] vapor trail
[53:34] I won't have to use any cologne or
[53:36] nothing
[53:38] I just don't know if I can just walk in
[53:39] that Vapor trial you just let me know
[53:41] when because it's just like sometimes it
[53:43] just seems like a cloud I know you
[53:45] that's where I want to live is in the
[53:47] cloud of the Shekinah Glory
[53:50] they would take there of the of the
[53:53] prayer and of the of of all the beaten
[53:56] material and they would offer it there
[53:58] on the fire and it just becomes a cloud
[54:00] before the mercy seat I want my life
[54:02] don't you want your life to be sold I
[54:04] want it to be that I want it to be a
[54:06] when you walk among people we walk among
[54:09] lives we're in our homes we want our
[54:11] lives to be a refreshing
[54:14] I want to live that close to him until I
[54:16] know that he is going to he's going to
[54:18] take me when he comes and I want
[54:21] everything to be in line with that so
[54:23] now as we even see that part in the
[54:26] scripture that's an expectation every
[54:28] man that hath this hope in him I've got
[54:31] an expectation for his coming I'm
[54:33] looking for his coming I don't want to
[54:36] be in a place to where I have to sit
[54:38] that I would even have the thought oh
[54:40] Lord don't come this moment oh Lord
[54:42] don't come tomorrow we want to live
[54:44] ready to go
[54:46] let me just go on a side track that's
[54:48] why I've never understood
[54:50] the whole part about of communion even
[54:55] needing to be announced so far in
[54:57] advance now I do it but I don't
[55:00] understand the part where you've had oh
[55:02] because listen
[55:05] what if he comes before communion
[55:08] over the same you gotta we've got to
[55:09] give us time to make everything right we
[55:11] should live ready
[55:13] we should live in a place with no
[55:15] regrets
[55:17] as if he can come in the next moment
[55:20] because we're not even guaranteed to
[55:22] make it to communion service is that
[55:25] right
[55:26] and so the effect of the expectation I
[55:30] want you to notice here's the effect of
[55:32] that expectation we have on our hearts
[55:34] is that it's a purifying of ourselves so
[55:38] let me say this to you
[55:40] we realize brother Brown would tell us
[55:42] he said for you take he said a person
[55:44] that's trying to clean themselves up
[55:47] all your all you're doing is is making
[55:49] your spots like the spots on a leopard
[55:52] you only make them stand out more
[55:54] so it shows that when this scripture
[55:58] says purifieth himself that this is not
[56:02] where I'm purifying myself as by my own
[56:05] means it speaks I have an access as a
[56:10] Believer to a source that brings Real
[56:14] Purity
[56:16] that's a privilege of being a believer
[56:19] that's a privilege of being in
[56:21] fellowship with God that's a privilege
[56:23] of being under the shed blood I'm just
[56:26] talking to you tonight about one of your
[56:27] benefits forget the lot the Lord and all
[56:29] his benefits this is one of the benefits
[56:31] we have an access to a source of
[56:35] purifying Our Lives
[56:38] and I don't need to purify my soul when
[56:41] I've been born again but I must purify
[56:43] every other area of my life
[56:47] is that right don't give any place to
[56:50] the devil tear down strongholds right
[56:53] so all of this this is God's
[56:56] commissioning to our hearts and I'll say
[56:59] it like this as we go on because I'll
[57:02] even come to a place here to where even
[57:04] no matter where you're at in your
[57:06] journey if you've not come to that place
[57:08] of the new birth it's still taking the
[57:11] word and you've got to come according to
[57:13] the source of purification which is the
[57:16] word of God in order for it to lead to a
[57:20] real Pure Life and a real pure birth
[57:25] so here's an ongoing purifieth himself
[57:28] and notice even as he is pure Soul it's
[57:32] not me uh with my reasoning it's not me
[57:36] or you looking at something else but
[57:39] it's him who is standing in view it's
[57:42] him that I'm beholding it's him that I'm
[57:45] examining My Life by because he is Paul
[57:48] said he has been made to be our wisdom
[57:51] our Redemption our sanctification he is
[57:55] our all in all
[57:57] so he's making himself known and as he
[58:01] reveals himself let me just say this
[58:03] when the prophet says that we are to
[58:05] pray for Revelation more than anything
[58:07] else friends I do not believe that that
[58:11] statement there is a few paragraphs
[58:13] there that brother Adam makes that
[58:15] statement in regard solely to Doctrine
[58:18] but he is talking about the revealing of
[58:22] the person of Jesus Christ when the
[58:24] revelation of Jesus Christ was made
[58:27] known to John in Revelations chapter 1
[58:30] it took the life out of him he said I
[58:33] fell at his feet as dead
[58:37] and I believe with all of my heart to
[58:39] say oh God you say brother Samuel can we
[58:42] have that experience we can't and we
[58:45] need to continue to have experience
[58:48] after experience after an experience
[58:51] when the prophet went beyond the curtain
[58:54] of time he said I can no longer be the
[58:57] same William Branham that I was
[59:00] he didn't get born again when he went
[59:02] beyond the curtain of time but he came
[59:04] into a press a place that he realized
[59:07] nothing else in this earth matters he
[59:11] already felt that way
[59:14] but he came forth with such a
[59:16] determination I'm not going to let
[59:18] nothing stick in my life nothing hold me
[59:21] back
[59:22] oh may God give us Grace may we pursue
[59:26] that to live under the effect of that
[59:29] Realm
[59:31] that he has made a way for us
[59:36] there's a battle to live in Heavenly
[59:38] places and I can't deal with that
[59:39] tonight but there's a battle and there's
[59:41] always that to try to keep you out but
[59:43] to think of how the word comes like a
[59:47] Waters of separation
[59:48] Upon Our Lives to bring a conviction to
[59:52] bring leadership to bring Direction
[59:55] and you see when we serve God when you
[59:58] think about
[59:59] last week when we were talking about
[1:00:01] David and you talk about David and Saul
[1:00:04] even in that when you look at David's
[1:00:06] life
[1:00:08] David's reverence
[1:00:10] for God
[1:00:12] and dwelling in God's presence is what
[1:00:15] gave him strength
[1:00:17] to look Beyond Saul
[1:00:20] let me just tell you something David
[1:00:22] absolutely held nothing in his heart
[1:00:25] against Saul because when some men came
[1:00:28] to him and those men said
[1:00:31] look what we've done we've killed your
[1:00:34] enemy Saul and David just steps back and
[1:00:36] said you've got your own death sentence
[1:00:39] even when one came and killed there one
[1:00:43] of Saul's Sons
[1:00:45] and then he comes Blessed Be him of the
[1:00:47] Lord I have killed thine enemy
[1:00:50] David was not even viewing Saul in that
[1:00:54] way
[1:00:56] it showed his approach because he could
[1:00:59] look at that and say you're not fearful
[1:01:01] to even touch the Lord's anointed and
[1:01:04] what I'm saying is is that David's
[1:01:06] strength has he said in Psalms 27 my
[1:01:10] strength is in the Lord he is the
[1:01:13] strength of my life
[1:01:16] that's how David was living in Victory
[1:01:19] in our life
[1:01:20] let me just say it like this
[1:01:22] we are not and the the if we can call
[1:01:25] them like this bumps in the roads or
[1:01:27] things that come along in our pathway
[1:01:29] and things that come and challenge us
[1:01:32] are not just oh why did that bump happen
[1:01:34] oh why did this have to happen those are
[1:01:37] all opportunities for growth
[1:01:42] is that right I think brother Stephen
[1:01:43] brought that out even as we have been
[1:01:45] speaking that even on the Statue of a
[1:01:47] perfect man and brother Stephen made a
[1:01:49] statement in this manner he says you're
[1:01:51] asking God for patience or you know
[1:01:53] there might be something you have you
[1:01:55] deal with jealousy or whatever more he
[1:01:57] said what happens is it isn't God just
[1:01:59] all of a sudden coming as it was
[1:02:00] bringing broth that he just deposits
[1:02:02] something and oh I've gotten more no
[1:02:04] there's an overcoming so there's
[1:02:07] opportunities that challenge that
[1:02:11] is that right
[1:02:13] so this is why when the statue of a
[1:02:15] perfect man is adding it means that of
[1:02:19] an enlargement that of an increasing
[1:02:21] are you with me that's why this is why
[1:02:24] the kind of faith that we want to stand
[1:02:26] with that your that that patience will
[1:02:29] never be greater than what your faith is
[1:02:31] virtue will never be greater than what
[1:02:34] your faith is but see Faith itself
[1:02:36] because because there must be a pyramid
[1:02:38] are you with me so it cannot be it's not
[1:02:40] awkward there is a continual growing and
[1:02:44] we come into that under the message of
[1:02:47] the hour that's the entrance into the
[1:02:50] Capstone and when we've come into the
[1:02:53] Holy Ghost now we've been birthed and a
[1:02:56] child grows
[1:02:58] right so let it be added unto you
[1:03:01] added so we want to keep on let it be
[1:03:04] added added because Paul said let
[1:03:06] yourself let abound in the work of the
[1:03:09] Lord right let may your love abound one
[1:03:12] towards another well how can that happen
[1:03:15] unless there are things that are
[1:03:16] completely opposite to that that require
[1:03:19] that
[1:03:20] not sure nobody in here we're not we're
[1:03:22] not going to all sign up and say okay
[1:03:23] can you show me the sign up lifts I want
[1:03:25] more love because we know in order for
[1:03:27] that to happen it's going to be more of
[1:03:29] the opposite coming our way
[1:03:32] God knows that because we we would take
[1:03:34] the easy path in the easy way but we are
[1:03:36] his children and God knows exactly what
[1:03:38] we have made of once we've done
[1:03:40] complaining about the bumps and the
[1:03:42] hiccups and the why did this happening
[1:03:43] and when we finally get past all are
[1:03:46] complaining and God said okay okay now
[1:03:49] are you ready for me to move in your
[1:03:51] life and give you strength oh yeah Lord
[1:03:53] are you going to remove this out of my
[1:03:55] life no I'm going to give you overcoming
[1:03:57] Grace to grow in that area of your life
[1:04:02] but if you'll stay in my presence
[1:04:05] my goodness
[1:04:08] there is a fountain open in the House of
[1:04:10] David
[1:04:12] hallelujah how many know that prayer is
[1:04:15] important
[1:04:17] oh brother Branham I'm asking that God
[1:04:20] would just help me to overcome my temper
[1:04:22] what did he say
[1:04:24] sweeten it
[1:04:26] with prayer
[1:04:28] sweeten it with prayer
[1:04:31] that's overcoming that's as tuning of
[1:04:34] God where we recognize and where our
[1:04:36] source comes from so I want you to think
[1:04:38] of how a duck we we all know and I just
[1:04:40] maybe to reference this first part in
[1:04:42] this quote of how that a dove itself
[1:04:46] cannot eat on the carrion that a crow
[1:04:49] can
[1:04:50] it can't do it it doesn't have why it
[1:04:52] doesn't have the gall what's necessary
[1:04:54] to digest it
[1:04:57] so it can't it can't do it there's
[1:04:59] nothing within it that could feed on
[1:05:02] carrion is that right so notice if then
[1:05:07] as we look at it brother Brown would go
[1:05:09] on to say go to the next part sister
[1:05:11] Brianna a dove is not built like any
[1:05:13] other bird and that's why God
[1:05:15] represented himself as a dove descending
[1:05:19] from Heaven it cannot stand the stink of
[1:05:22] a carrying it's not a vulture the reason
[1:05:24] you don't have any goal couldn't digest
[1:05:26] it he would kill it if it eat it now
[1:05:28] this is where I want you to notice here
[1:05:30] a dove never has to take a bath
[1:05:34] right
[1:05:37] and Dove's body puts out oil
[1:05:41] from the inside
[1:05:43] that keeps it clean
[1:05:46] so where does its cleansing come from
[1:05:48] the inside
[1:05:51] it's a life that's in the Dove it
[1:05:55] generates in it and oil that keeps the
[1:05:59] feathers clean
[1:06:01] and so as a Christian there's a life
[1:06:03] within them that keeps them clean it's
[1:06:07] filtered
[1:06:10] what is it it's an oil within now notice
[1:06:12] what does that oil do it comes from the
[1:06:14] inside out why because there are things
[1:06:18] that can get stuck in the feathers there
[1:06:22] is a cleansing that's needed when things
[1:06:24] are in the feathers things upon the Dove
[1:06:27] and where does its cleansing not from an
[1:06:30] outside Source but the oil that is
[1:06:33] within it oh oh my the oil that is
[1:06:37] within it is where its cleansing comes
[1:06:40] from that oil emanates from the inside
[1:06:43] out
[1:06:45] it's like the woman who had sons that
[1:06:47] were taken by the Creditor and she asked
[1:06:49] Elisha she said hey my sons have are
[1:06:53] going to be taken uh what can I do and
[1:06:56] Elisha looked and he said you already
[1:06:58] have oil in your house what you need is
[1:07:01] empty vessels what was he letting her
[1:07:03] know your answer is already among you
[1:07:08] [Applause]
[1:07:09] but she didn't see it as her answer she
[1:07:12] didn't see it as the Deliverance but
[1:07:14] when she got empty vessels the oil that
[1:07:17] was already among them begin to pour
[1:07:20] itself out into empty vessels
[1:07:22] and when the empty vessels were filled
[1:07:24] it satisfied the debt
[1:07:28] is that right so there's an oil of the
[1:07:31] holy spirit that comes from within us
[1:07:34] and I want to just just picking this in
[1:07:36] this turn in this manner that it's a
[1:07:39] cleansing oil of God that rests in the
[1:07:42] midst of our life that is the power that
[1:07:45] lays within a believer
[1:07:47] to release
[1:07:49] and cleanse every thought
[1:07:52] that wants to gain a hold in your
[1:07:55] feathers
[1:07:57] because if eventually if it starts
[1:08:00] mounting up it'll weigh you down
[1:08:03] it'll keep you from flying like you
[1:08:06] ought to fly
[1:08:08] but the source of cleansing
[1:08:10] comes from the inside that's why there
[1:08:13] must be an inside source and this is why
[1:08:15] his brother Brown could say it like this
[1:08:17] so let me just reference this this out
[1:08:19] of broken cisterns
[1:08:21] there's a fountain that's open
[1:08:23] he says there's no other found I know
[1:08:25] but that Fountain it cleansed me when I
[1:08:28] was dirty how many witnesses tonight it
[1:08:30] cleansed me when I was dirty
[1:08:35] cleansed
[1:08:36] because I want to live right at it I
[1:08:40] want to drink this fresh water that
[1:08:42] fills my soul with joy
[1:08:46] so in our walk as as Believers there is
[1:08:50] a continual sanctification by him we're
[1:08:55] talking about this purifier Romans 6
[1:08:57] verse 11. Paul said likewise reckon that
[1:09:01] means think ye also yourselves to be
[1:09:04] dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God
[1:09:07] through Jesus Christ Our Lord now these
[1:09:09] same scriptures that I'm going to read
[1:09:11] is where a life will pass through even
[1:09:14] on their Journey to the New Birth these
[1:09:17] same scriptures apply even after a life
[1:09:19] has come into the new birth they apply
[1:09:22] in a continual sanctification of life
[1:09:28] because once a New Birth has come you
[1:09:30] don't need a sanctifying of your soul
[1:09:34] are you with me
[1:09:35] but it is a need because things
[1:09:38] sometimes can get
[1:09:40] stuck in the feathers things can get
[1:09:42] caught in the feathers
[1:09:46] ye also yourselves to be dead indeed
[1:09:48] unto sin but alive unto God through
[1:09:51] Jesus Christ Our Lord let me just put in
[1:09:53] a nutshell remembering Who You Are
[1:09:57] you are a son and daughter of God
[1:10:00] beloved now are we so our conduct is
[1:10:03] Sons and Daughters of God verse 12 let
[1:10:07] not sin therefore
[1:10:09] reign in your mortal body that you
[1:10:12] should obey it in the lust era that word
[1:10:14] Reign means it's the word uh in the
[1:10:17] Greek which is basilio which is a is a
[1:10:19] ruling power
[1:10:21] you see if something comes in a thought
[1:10:24] and you don't deal with it eventually
[1:10:27] that thought it starts moving and
[1:10:29] working on your emotions and your
[1:10:31] feelings
[1:10:33] are you hearing me I don't want no birds
[1:10:35] I don't want no birds building a nest
[1:10:37] but the one of the quick signs that you
[1:10:39] know that they've lit down on a tree
[1:10:41] with some little twig of a thought is
[1:10:43] all of a sudden it starts affecting your
[1:10:45] emotions what do I do wrecking
[1:10:47] yourselves dead unto sin and Alive unto
[1:10:51] God
[1:10:52] I don't want this raining I don't want
[1:10:54] this controlling I don't want this
[1:10:56] ruling in my life
[1:11:00] I want to deal with that here just a
[1:11:02] little bit don't let it rain in your
[1:11:04] mortal body that you should obey it in
[1:11:06] the lust thereof neither yield ye your
[1:11:09] members now notice who's got the
[1:11:11] authority here
[1:11:12] the believer
[1:11:14] don't yield yourselves members as
[1:11:16] instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin
[1:11:19] but yield yourselves unto God as those
[1:11:21] that are alive from the dead and your
[1:11:23] members as instruments of righteousness
[1:11:26] unto God
[1:11:28] I don't want to be yielded to him
[1:11:32] right
[1:11:33] I I want him to when it's when it's time
[1:11:35] I don't want him like the screwdriver or
[1:11:37] the or the hammer he'll say hey who had
[1:11:39] the hammer last I want to be right in
[1:11:40] place
[1:11:42] I want to be right in place
[1:11:44] for sin shall not have dominion over you
[1:11:46] for you're not under the law but under
[1:11:48] grace notice verse 15 what shall we say
[1:11:52] What then shall we sin because we're not
[1:11:54] under the law but under grace God forbid
[1:11:56] know you not that to whom you yield
[1:11:58] yourself servants to obey his servants
[1:12:01] ye are to whom you obey and whether of
[1:12:04] sin unto death or of obedience unto
[1:12:08] righteousness now notice now look at
[1:12:09] that purifying of obedience unto
[1:12:12] righteousness but God be think that ye
[1:12:14] were the Servants of sin but you have
[1:12:17] obeyed from the heart that form of
[1:12:19] Doctrine which was delivered unto you so
[1:12:23] where does obedience take place in the
[1:12:25] heart first
[1:12:27] sometimes we're so taken with I don't
[1:12:30] see this action but it's first got to be
[1:12:32] here if it's not here so listen when
[1:12:35] you're praying for any you're praying
[1:12:37] for a loved one you're praying for
[1:12:39] another situation pray for the heart
[1:12:43] pray for the heart God sent a message to
[1:12:46] deal with the heart when there's
[1:12:48] problems pray for the heart are you
[1:12:50] hearing me don't pray for certain
[1:12:52] actions because maybe God is not going
[1:12:55] to lead it in that way but you
[1:12:57] interceding for their heart you're
[1:12:58] interceding for the real reality of what
[1:13:01] will bring a change and display in the
[1:13:05] actions
[1:13:06] Verse 18 being then made free from sin
[1:13:09] ye became the Servants of righteousness
[1:13:12] I'm glad about that I speak after the
[1:13:14] manner of men because of the strength of
[1:13:16] your no because of the infirmity of your
[1:13:19] flesh
[1:13:21] for as you have yielded your members
[1:13:23] servants to uncleanliness and to
[1:13:25] iniquity unto iniquity look at this even
[1:13:28] so now yield your members servants to
[1:13:32] righteousness unto holiness
[1:13:36] for when you were Servants of sin you
[1:13:38] were free from righteousness and what
[1:13:39] fruit had you in those things wherever
[1:13:41] you are now ashamed for the end of those
[1:13:43] things as death but now being made free
[1:13:45] from sin and become servants to God ye
[1:13:48] have your fruit unto Holiness and the
[1:13:50] end everlasting life for the wages of
[1:13:53] sin is death but the gift of God is
[1:13:55] eternal life through Jesus Christ Our
[1:13:57] Lord let me just say it in this manner
[1:14:00] you know brother Branham takes
[1:14:03] God leads him to speak a message
[1:14:06] remember when he he led him back and
[1:14:08] told him to pick up that cigarette pack
[1:14:10] when he picked it up
[1:14:12] and said ran fun and surely not
[1:14:15] he turned around and what did it say
[1:14:17] uh
[1:14:18] uh you know a smoking man's fate taste
[1:14:22] and a thinking man's filter
[1:14:25] whoo
[1:14:27] so to think the whole marketability of
[1:14:30] that particular
[1:14:32] cigarette company
[1:14:34] was that by this filter
[1:14:37] you're not going to get as much nicotine
[1:14:39] okay so you spoke smoke two twice as
[1:14:42] many packs to get the same kind of
[1:14:44] nicotine you wanted in one
[1:14:46] why
[1:14:47] instead is instead of smoking one pack
[1:14:50] now you gotta smoke two packs why
[1:14:53] because it's not about the filter it's
[1:14:57] what's on the inside
[1:15:00] craving that nicotine
[1:15:02] and so the Holy Spirit would bring that
[1:15:05] and so take that a thinking man's filter
[1:15:08] and draw the prophet's attention to it
[1:15:11] and God here would take a phrase and
[1:15:13] bring that out to you and I and show you
[1:15:16] and I there is a provision for a real
[1:15:21] thinking man for a real thinking woman
[1:15:24] for one where the spirit of God can deal
[1:15:27] with our lives and say not just is this
[1:15:30] world bad but I need God I need a living
[1:15:36] God in my life I I need a God that'll
[1:15:39] come and dissolve all unbelief I need a
[1:15:43] thanking man's filter I need the blood
[1:15:46] of Jesus Christ because once that Soul
[1:15:50] has been redeemed once it's been born
[1:15:53] again there is a thinking man a thanking
[1:15:55] woman on the inside and it is the filter
[1:15:58] of the word that's why when a person has
[1:16:01] been born again in the struggles of the
[1:16:05] world have ceased in your soul
[1:16:09] are you hearing me it isn't a struggle
[1:16:11] to dress right and in the struggle to
[1:16:14] live right why you've got a different
[1:16:16] nature on the inside
[1:16:19] there's a filter that filters out all
[1:16:24] reasoning filters out all trash
[1:16:28] and the only thing that can pass through
[1:16:29] that filter is the word and the spirit
[1:16:34] because on the other end is a thinking
[1:16:36] man thinking woman that's drawing
[1:16:39] upon that word
[1:16:41] so the prophet would take this even at
[1:16:43] the end of that message and he would
[1:16:45] deal with when you come into situations
[1:16:47] in your life
[1:16:49] are you using a thinking man's filter
[1:16:53] when somebody does you bad
[1:16:55] how do you react are you using a
[1:16:58] thinking man's filter now let me just
[1:17:00] say it like this this thinking man's
[1:17:01] filter is not like
[1:17:03] the gas mask that the firemen use or
[1:17:08] some other people we saw use in the past
[1:17:10] few years
[1:17:11] they're not like that that isn't
[1:17:12] something you put on and then you oh we
[1:17:14] don't handle fire we just take it off
[1:17:16] and hang it up you need this as a matter
[1:17:18] of fact as a Believer let me just tell
[1:17:20] you a real believer you don't take Jesus
[1:17:22] off and put him on
[1:17:24] when you've been born again you're a new
[1:17:26] creation
[1:17:29] are you hearing me now
[1:17:31] so it's learning to live by that source
[1:17:35] of that filter on the inside that
[1:17:38] everything is to be filtered through
[1:17:41] that source and it's not about well I
[1:17:44] have to do it it's about Lord this is
[1:17:46] your word this is your character this is
[1:17:49] what your desire that's my desire is to
[1:17:52] please you and to draw through the
[1:17:54] filter of God's word in our life I tell
[1:17:58] you what if we would pass many many of
[1:18:00] the things right through the filter of
[1:18:02] God's word I tell you what we wouldn't
[1:18:04] end up with a lot of other things that
[1:18:05] we've got to repent over
[1:18:07] is that right if we just live more by
[1:18:10] the thinking man's filter what are you
[1:18:11] saying I'm saying live more by the
[1:18:13] inside man we are so in touch with
[1:18:16] outside things that we become out of
[1:18:18] touch with the God who lives in US he
[1:18:21] ain't living way out there he's living
[1:18:23] inside of you
[1:18:25] that's why when we look at real
[1:18:27] Fellowship when God told them my house
[1:18:30] shall be called a House of Prayer you
[1:18:32] are that House of Prayer you are that
[1:18:34] house of Fellowship you are the dwelling
[1:18:37] place of almighty God a place where God
[1:18:40] can come and unload his heart to his
[1:18:43] beloved
[1:18:44] what is it you can only unload your
[1:18:47] heart when it's a safe place to unload
[1:18:49] it
[1:18:50] it's a House of Prayer
[1:18:53] his people it's a Dwelling Place
[1:18:56] amen almighty God in Christ Jesus
[1:19:00] oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:19:03] in the scripture of Matthew 6
[1:19:06] verse 9.
[1:19:09] when the disciples were
[1:19:11] admonished of how to pray he said after
[1:19:14] this manner our father would turn in
[1:19:16] heaven Hollywood
[1:19:18] be thy name
[1:19:21] thy kingdom come
[1:19:24] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[1:19:26] heaven
[1:19:28] give us this day
[1:19:31] Our Daily Bread
[1:19:33] and forgive us our debts
[1:19:36] debts as notice that as we forgive our
[1:19:40] debtors
[1:19:42] and lead us not into temptation
[1:19:46] but Deliver Us from Evil
[1:19:48] for thine is the kingdom and the power
[1:19:50] and the glory forever
[1:19:52] amen
[1:19:54] now some months back when I was just
[1:19:57] looking and studying and many of these
[1:19:59] things were dropping I just just the
[1:20:01] thing it just just really Dropped In My
[1:20:04] Heart
[1:20:05] on that phrase Deliver Us from Evil just
[1:20:08] thinking about the manifestation of the
[1:20:10] sons of God and I just begin to think
[1:20:12] that phrase the Holy Spirit began to
[1:20:14] press that upon my heart Deliver Us from
[1:20:16] Evil now I want you to catch this
[1:20:19] lead us not into temptation I I don't
[1:20:22] Lord I I'm not Desiring Tire trials and
[1:20:26] tests and all that I I'm not because if
[1:20:29] I were then I would be able I would be
[1:20:31] saying Lord I'm fit for it but I I he
[1:20:34] knows what I'm fit for and whatever he
[1:20:37] makes a room and wait for I guarantee
[1:20:40] you I don't want to go through it but if
[1:20:41] he's with me I'll go through it because
[1:20:44] when I come out on the other side like
[1:20:45] job said I'm going to come out pure as
[1:20:48] Glory
[1:20:49] I know that I don't know how it's all
[1:20:51] going to work out I don't know all the
[1:20:53] parts and how everything what all is
[1:20:54] going to be dissolved but I know when I
[1:20:57] come out of this I'm going to be pure
[1:21:00] so job is letting us know that the
[1:21:02] trials are even as they come away it is
[1:21:05] a place of even World lives there's a
[1:21:08] purifying that's going on from his
[1:21:10] presence
[1:21:12] oh because let me tell you something
[1:21:14] when they were walking around in the
[1:21:15] fiery furnace they weren't down there
[1:21:17] texting everybody how bad the King was
[1:21:21] come home they wasn't tweeting out in
[1:21:23] instagramming or whatever you call it
[1:21:25] and Facebook and can you believe this
[1:21:27] rotten guy can you believe him why is he
[1:21:30] thinking throwing us in here they
[1:21:33] weren't down there they didn't even have
[1:21:34] that in their heart
[1:21:36] if they'd have had anything in their
[1:21:38] heart like that he'd have never came
[1:21:41] right but it shows even their approach
[1:21:43] to the king that they were able to stand
[1:21:46] there in the presence of the king and
[1:21:49] without arrogance and say then we've not
[1:21:52] heard what our God's going to do but
[1:21:55] we've already reached our decision we
[1:21:56] don't even got to pray about it we're
[1:21:58] not going to bow to this because it's
[1:22:00] wrong
[1:22:05] what Grace is given
[1:22:09] I tell you friends that sometimes even
[1:22:10] when we look at it
[1:22:13] standing for what's right standing for
[1:22:15] truth is not easy but if you stand for
[1:22:18] the truth the truth also has Grace to be
[1:22:21] released that cleanses you
[1:22:24] it cleanses you
[1:22:26] and I want to say Deliver Us from Evil
[1:22:28] it shows with the from this very phrase
[1:22:31] why would you need deliverance from it
[1:22:33] if you haven't been if it isn't around
[1:22:35] you
[1:22:37] come on why would we have to even pray
[1:22:39] this if it's not even around us but you
[1:22:42] see evil is all around us
[1:22:46] when I would go to
[1:22:48] do good evil is present yeah I know
[1:22:52] sister so no I ain't sister so and so
[1:22:54] it's this old stinking evil thing
[1:23:00] and then like brother John LaFontaine
[1:23:02] Used to Say stinking thinking
[1:23:04] and if you've got stinking thinking you
[1:23:06] need checkup from the neck up
[1:23:07] [Laughter]
[1:23:10] is that right
[1:23:12] right now notice it's all around us
[1:23:15] and Paul deals with this in Galatians 5.
[1:23:18] it's it's all around us and he did he
[1:23:20] deals gives us admonition which we've
[1:23:22] been through that and that evil can come
[1:23:24] in many forms and ways throughout the
[1:23:27] day
[1:23:30] but to deliver us is to free us
[1:23:33] from the evil laying a hold on my life
[1:23:37] in other words it might be all around me
[1:23:40] but I don't
[1:23:41] zest me I
[1:23:43] need to affect my thoughts I
[1:23:45] thought I had my mind I don't want it to
[1:23:47] affect me to where I become a channel
[1:23:49] for the evil that's all around me not
[1:23:52] that I'm going to do the evil I don't
[1:23:54] want to I don't want to be a channel to
[1:23:57] where my life becomes showering bitter
[1:24:00] and exasperating and oh no oh here comes
[1:24:04] so and so Lord have mercy I'll see you
[1:24:06] God bless you goodbye no I want my life
[1:24:08] to be a refreshing
[1:24:11] I want my life is that what you want
[1:24:14] I think of one of the greatest
[1:24:15] testimonies in the book of Philemon one
[1:24:18] in one of the very first admonitions
[1:24:20] that Paul makes concerning before Layman
[1:24:23] himself who was a leader there in the
[1:24:25] church in colossia he would say by thee
[1:24:29] brother the Saints are refreshed that's
[1:24:33] the kind of testimony we want
[1:24:35] right I don't want a testimony where I
[1:24:37] exasperate people I want a testimony
[1:24:40] where there's a refreshing of the spirit
[1:24:42] of almighty God
[1:24:44] is that right well how does that happen
[1:24:46] brother Samuel oh that could be like
[1:24:47] so-and-so no you cannot put forth the
[1:24:51] Fountain of Life if you're not living in
[1:24:53] his presence
[1:24:56] notice this let's look at this here in
[1:24:58] teaching on Moses how many know Atari is
[1:25:02] tar t-a-r
[1:25:04] I'm not talking southern part I'm
[1:25:07] talking tar t-a-r like they put on the
[1:25:09] roads like on blacktop tar like I'm
[1:25:12] tired no tar
[1:25:15] you children know what part is when
[1:25:19] they're fixing the streets oh that awful
[1:25:22] smell
[1:25:23] but here's what it does it shuts out all
[1:25:26] the cracks on the street
[1:25:30] and that's the way this does it shuts
[1:25:35] out all water if someone knows aren't
[1:25:37] this the way this tar does it shuts out
[1:25:40] all water how many know what the tar was
[1:25:43] the word the pitch itself was the Holy
[1:25:45] Ghost the word pitch means atonement
[1:25:49] that's what prayer does
[1:25:53] for the believer
[1:25:55] that's what keeps the world out of you
[1:25:57] is when you pitch yourself on your knees
[1:26:02] when you pinch yourself on your knees
[1:26:05] and say Lord Jesus and the blood comes
[1:26:08] down and seals you all up so the devil
[1:26:12] can't get you
[1:26:14] glory be to God oh that's right oh many
[1:26:17] times the people go around and say it's
[1:26:19] awful but I don't make no difference it
[1:26:21] keeps you safe that's the main thing it
[1:26:23] keeps you safe you're old-fashioned but
[1:26:24] it don't matter it keeps you safe what
[1:26:26] when we pinch ourselves on our knees now
[1:26:30] you might be standing on your job what's
[1:26:32] important is is you pitch your heart
[1:26:34] towards him we pitch our will towards
[1:26:36] him we're not asking God to come and
[1:26:39] change it Lord you come according to my
[1:26:41] will let me just I've already got this
[1:26:42] printed out how I want you to do it I
[1:26:44] want you to do it this way and God will
[1:26:46] say keep your plans because your plans
[1:26:48] are not my plans your ways are not my
[1:26:51] ways right but when we're willing to say
[1:26:53] Lord Jesus let my will be conformed to
[1:26:58] your will
[1:27:01] notice the very next scripture here
[1:27:02] right after that
[1:27:05] for if you forgive men
[1:27:08] their trespasses
[1:27:10] your heavenly father will also
[1:27:14] forgive you
[1:27:16] I don't know kind of sounds conditional
[1:27:18] to me
[1:27:21] right
[1:27:22] sounds conditional verse 15. but if you
[1:27:25] forgive not men their trespasses neither
[1:27:30] will your father
[1:27:32] forgive your trespasses why
[1:27:35] why would he do that you don't know what
[1:27:38] they've done to me you don't know this
[1:27:39] you don't know that it's because we are
[1:27:42] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:27:43] and God expects us to act like gods
[1:27:48] if a dog acts like a dog it's like my
[1:27:50] wife tells me many times
[1:27:52] stop it
[1:27:53] she said they're dogs
[1:27:56] right some of the rest you got animals
[1:27:58] and whatever more I know we love them
[1:27:59] and everything else like that but
[1:28:01] they're dogs still right they still have
[1:28:03] the Tendencies of dogs
[1:28:05] I don't care how many blankets we give
[1:28:07] them how many nice treats they still
[1:28:09] will do dog stuff because it's there in
[1:28:12] their nature
[1:28:14] is that right and this is where that
[1:28:17] when we look at it for this notice how
[1:28:19] this would be placed here for a real
[1:28:22] god-like expression oh I'm sure all
[1:28:24] across this building we would raise our
[1:28:26] hands if God ask us who wants to be more
[1:28:28] like me what I do Lord I want to and
[1:28:31] Lord I want to be more like you okay who
[1:28:33] would like to walk on the water and just
[1:28:35] be a real display Lord I will sacrifice
[1:28:38] and I will walk on the water I I will
[1:28:40] lay my hands I'll surrender to be laid
[1:28:42] on the sick that they shall recover okay
[1:28:44] so who also wants to be Godlike in a
[1:28:48] manner that is so deep because remember
[1:28:50] many can work miracles but who would
[1:28:53] want to display the Godlike of
[1:28:55] forgiveness
[1:28:56] [Music]
[1:28:58] oh be careful we're not raising the
[1:29:00] hands now because if we go to race in
[1:29:02] that hands he remembers what there's
[1:29:04] going to be things that will come our
[1:29:06] way that will require
[1:29:07] God like forgiveness
[1:29:11] are you with me
[1:29:13] oh my notice forgive
[1:29:16] it means to let go or give up a debt
[1:29:19] forgive to remit now here's what the
[1:29:21] word forgive really when we look at it
[1:29:23] because sometimes we can we can look at
[1:29:26] the offense we can look at what has
[1:29:27] taken place I'm talking about a useful
[1:29:30] life now remaining a channel because we
[1:29:33] can look at that a lot of the times but
[1:29:35] remember sometimes the offense itself
[1:29:37] that is in itself is really what the
[1:29:40] problem of forgiveness it's what lingers
[1:29:43] as the result of what was done which to
[1:29:47] forgive means to stop feeling angry or
[1:29:50] resentful towards someone for an offense
[1:29:53] a flaw or mistake how many in here have
[1:29:57] offended somebody
[1:29:58] wow only five
[1:30:00] six eight ten
[1:30:02] how many have flaws if I could raise my
[1:30:05] feet I would
[1:30:07] I've got flaws my wife has to put up
[1:30:10] with them all the time
[1:30:12] maybe hers out waiting on
[1:30:14] but I got flaws right she can spend the
[1:30:17] month of Sunday's trying to iron all the
[1:30:19] flaws out of that this is who I am it's
[1:30:21] not an excuse for things but through
[1:30:23] those Falls mistakes how many make
[1:30:26] mistakes
[1:30:27] yeah sure every one of us and now when I
[1:30:31] ask you of that with having offenses
[1:30:33] flaws and mistakes how many want God's
[1:30:36] forgiveness
[1:30:38] I know brother Sammy just feels like I'm
[1:30:39] in elementary school I know I know I
[1:30:41] know but sometimes participation is good
[1:30:43] then if we want God's forgiveness now
[1:30:46] this is what it calls for because for us
[1:30:49] to be able to forgive
[1:30:51] others
[1:30:53] what is greater let me ask you this
[1:30:55] what's greater the offense
[1:30:57] what's greater the trespass
[1:31:00] or a lack of forgiveness
[1:31:04] you understand as a person can so regard
[1:31:07] the trespass
[1:31:09] that they fail to see the lack of
[1:31:13] forgiveness actually becomes as great or
[1:31:17] greater
[1:31:19] than the offense
[1:31:21] are you with me I'm just going to drag
[1:31:23] my feet here you see what it does listen
[1:31:26] to me now what this does you say what's
[1:31:27] happening here this is the Waters of
[1:31:29] separation
[1:31:30] it deals with our life it brings
[1:31:32] conviction to our life it calms down
[1:31:34] through our life we want to remain as
[1:31:36] channels
[1:31:37] that the Holy Spirit can work through
[1:31:41] now I want you to think of this
[1:31:42] forgiveness is a choice
[1:31:45] I've never as a pastor mandated anybody
[1:31:48] to forgive somebody else I've admonished
[1:31:51] them but I realize forgive forgiveness
[1:31:53] is the condition of the heart
[1:31:55] it's a choice mama can't make it for you
[1:31:58] Daddy can't make it for you husband wife
[1:32:00] nobody it's a choice now here's what I
[1:32:03] want you to lay on now but forgiveness
[1:32:06] itself is not something that's cheap we
[1:32:08] must not make it cheap it must not be
[1:32:10] something that is just you know because
[1:32:13] when you think what was it that had to
[1:32:16] go in on our behalf in order to release
[1:32:19] us from the hold of sin upon our life
[1:32:22] and our offenses we were enemies unto
[1:32:25] God what went into that in order to
[1:32:28] release us there was a cost
[1:32:30] is that right
[1:32:32] it cost
[1:32:35] almighty God
[1:32:37] it cost him the life
[1:32:40] of his only begotten son
[1:32:42] and you know he was willing to give it
[1:32:46] in order that not only that we might be
[1:32:48] forgiven
[1:32:49] but then through his life
[1:32:52] coming and lead us to reconciliation
[1:32:55] with him
[1:32:57] I want you to think about this right
[1:32:58] here
[1:33:00] there's a lot that I could go into but
[1:33:01] I'm just not going to be able to I know
[1:33:03] tonight but forgiveness is also
[1:33:06] something I want to make these points
[1:33:07] forgiveness is not about whether someone
[1:33:09] deserves it or not
[1:33:13] are you hearing me it's not about
[1:33:14] whether somebody deserves it or not
[1:33:17] are you with me forgiveness itself is
[1:33:20] not whether they even asked for it
[1:33:25] just like sometimes I've had you know
[1:33:26] individuals that call me up or come to
[1:33:28] me but so much for me I said listen I
[1:33:30] forgive you a long time ago
[1:33:32] I couldn't go on with God
[1:33:35] not even one moment
[1:33:37] are you hearing me
[1:33:40] you can't go on without that I I want to
[1:33:42] go on with God I want everybody else to
[1:33:44] be free to go on with God so forgiveness
[1:33:48] is to be like God it's an act of God
[1:33:51] that's supernaturally transpires when we
[1:33:55] surrender our rights of being offended
[1:34:00] now we can wear our offenses like a
[1:34:02] badge
[1:34:03] of Honor I've been offended
[1:34:11] but what we need is a supernatural
[1:34:14] we need the in touch
[1:34:17] with the oil of God on the inside and
[1:34:19] they say Lord there's some stuff that's
[1:34:21] got stuck in my mind
[1:34:23] stuck in my feathers
[1:34:26] there's some things that I have heard
[1:34:28] that other people said this and said
[1:34:29] this I've had things that's got stopped
[1:34:32] Lord I don't want it stuck I don't want
[1:34:34] to be stuck because I want to go on with
[1:34:36] you I don't want to be a Christian that
[1:34:39] dwells stuck in a rut I want to go on
[1:34:42] with you Lord are you with me Hey listen
[1:34:45] friends not one of you every one of you
[1:34:48] sitting here tonight you can look back
[1:34:50] at pictures from when you were in
[1:34:51] kindergarten even five years ago and you
[1:34:54] see changes in your life you would not
[1:34:56] expect anybody let's bring in now to the
[1:34:59] spiritual to hold you back to a
[1:35:01] spiritual picture of five years ago
[1:35:05] but sometimes we are guilty of holding
[1:35:08] one another in spiritual pictures of the
[1:35:13] past
[1:35:14] hello
[1:35:16] well yeah I took out that picture in my
[1:35:18] wallet well who is that
[1:35:20] you don't know who that is well that's
[1:35:22] brother so-and-so that's when they were
[1:35:24] five years five years old they're 67
[1:35:27] years old now and you're still carrying
[1:35:30] a memory from when they took your
[1:35:32] marbles on the playground
[1:35:36] we laugh friends but it's many times
[1:35:38] these are things that's got stuck in our
[1:35:41] feathers
[1:35:42] and the Holy Spirit begins to deal with
[1:35:44] these things and say hey you want to fly
[1:35:46] higher you want more of me you want more
[1:35:50] of my grace in your life you've got to
[1:35:52] be in tune now with that inner man he
[1:35:54] purifies himself even as he is pure what
[1:35:57] is he he's the standard not the church
[1:35:59] not your brother not your sister he is
[1:36:02] the living standard of the word that's
[1:36:05] been raised against the enemy
[1:36:07] so to be to her forgiveness is to act
[1:36:10] like God
[1:36:11] and the impediment is removed
[1:36:14] that the spirit of God May abide and
[1:36:16] flow through our lives
[1:36:17] remember got a kink and a hose
[1:36:24] sometimes it's a it'd be a long hosing
[1:36:27] man it's rough because you know the
[1:36:29] water's turned on
[1:36:31] you know what's going on
[1:36:34] what you got to do
[1:36:35] they'll say hey what's going on you know
[1:36:38] listen you've been through it enough
[1:36:41] you know there's a king somewhere
[1:36:44] and what do you do
[1:36:45] from where you're at you trace it back
[1:36:51] to the king
[1:36:52] right you don't stand out the garden and
[1:36:55] say hey honey find the kink
[1:36:59] no the spirit of God leads us to the
[1:37:01] places
[1:37:02] where it's kinked
[1:37:05] why that the channel might flow
[1:37:08] see that's where Satan he wants to
[1:37:11] he wants to trap us
[1:37:14] and I'm closing he wants to trap us we
[1:37:17] just don't have time
[1:37:18] he wants to trap us into being selfish
[1:37:20] sometimes I know we we don't always
[1:37:22] think of things in these terms sometimes
[1:37:26] you say what do you mean by being
[1:37:28] selfish to where that all we can do is
[1:37:30] ever think about is the wrong
[1:37:33] that's been done to us
[1:37:37] feelings that are stirred within us but
[1:37:39] I want to remind you
[1:37:41] First Corinthians 13.
[1:37:43] love
[1:37:45] seeks not
[1:37:47] her own
[1:37:50] love is not about self you might say
[1:37:52] what are you saying brother Samuel
[1:37:55] I wasn't here but when I streamed the
[1:37:58] message and I don't know where I was
[1:37:59] coming from
[1:38:01] might have been back in March when I was
[1:38:02] at brother Homer's and I was coming back
[1:38:04] I think that's when it was when brother
[1:38:06] Alexander magulis was here
[1:38:09] maybe it was in February February
[1:38:12] and I was coming back home from Brother
[1:38:14] Ray's and I mean the boys were streaming
[1:38:16] that service
[1:38:18] and brother magulis made a statement
[1:38:19] when he was here
[1:38:22] and he talked about how that you can
[1:38:24] take an offense
[1:38:26] and you can actually make a God out of
[1:38:28] it
[1:38:30] it's about three quarters way through
[1:38:31] the message and the Holy Spirit took him
[1:38:33] on that
[1:38:35] and I want to just say in this way if
[1:38:37] we're not careful
[1:38:38] you can make a god which is an object of
[1:38:40] worship
[1:38:42] out of the offense whereby you worship
[1:38:47] and everybody that comes into your
[1:38:49] circle
[1:38:50] has got to listen to your worship
[1:38:54] got to listen to the offense
[1:38:57] some somebody say amen that's on me
[1:39:05] but friends listen
[1:39:06] this is true for all of us
[1:39:09] this is true for all of us this is why
[1:39:11] we need
[1:39:12] purifying you see what the enemy's
[1:39:14] desires to do is to hold you down
[1:39:17] he wants to weigh you down now listen to
[1:39:19] me I don't have time to preach on this
[1:39:21] tonight
[1:39:23] the word forgiveness and Reconciliation
[1:39:26] are two different words
[1:39:29] are you hearing me
[1:39:31] you forgive
[1:39:32] but that forgiveness this is why in your
[1:39:36] heart when you forgive from your heart
[1:39:38] it looks
[1:39:40] and Longs for reconciliation
[1:39:43] God forgives me of my sin right it's
[1:39:47] already forgiven and I come to that
[1:39:48] acknowledgment the Holy Spirit keeps
[1:39:50] working on my heart why did the Holy
[1:39:53] Spirit correct me
[1:39:55] why does the Holy Spirit correct me
[1:39:56] because he likes picking on me Brian I'm
[1:39:58] going to pick on you I'd like to pick on
[1:39:59] you no
[1:40:01] so what is correction
[1:40:03] if I have to correct Paul what is the
[1:40:05] what is correction
[1:40:06] is correction about destroying him
[1:40:09] no it's correcting what's wrong why does
[1:40:12] the Holy Spirit come and bring
[1:40:13] conviction our life to correct what is
[1:40:16] wrong
[1:40:17] but he can it will only become corrected
[1:40:20] when we receive
[1:40:22] the grace that has brought that
[1:40:24] correction then our what happens where
[1:40:27] does that correction start it starts in
[1:40:29] our heart to say you
[1:40:32] be it unto me Lord forgive me see that
[1:40:34] correction within begins to Humble
[1:40:37] itself what is that it's moving in
[1:40:39] forgiveness then the same holy spirit
[1:40:41] that brought that conviction is the same
[1:40:43] holy spirit that guides and leads
[1:40:45] through all the proper channels to
[1:40:47] reconciliation
[1:40:49] right what's reconciliation back in
[1:40:52] harmony
[1:40:53] aren't you glad
[1:40:55] God is a faithful father he comes to
[1:40:59] lead us and he comes to guide us
[1:41:03] and I I don't believe anybody here
[1:41:05] tonight I don't I just sorry friends I
[1:41:07] don't believe that any heart
[1:41:09] even a person that look I know we may
[1:41:12] have lives and hearts I'm sure you can
[1:41:15] see lives and hearts and even sometimes
[1:41:17] when you see lives and maybe hearts and
[1:41:20] lives that maybe would even come and
[1:41:21] they Fellowship here are still living in
[1:41:24] the same address that you and I once
[1:41:26] lived in
[1:41:27] where Peter told or Paul told Titus we
[1:41:30] once lived in hatred we lived in those
[1:41:34] things but we don't live there no more
[1:41:37] we don't live there no more
[1:41:38] what do I do don't despise that person
[1:41:40] who's there but pray for their heart
[1:41:44] that God will move upon their heart that
[1:41:46] they can see that same Liberty and come
[1:41:48] to that same cleansing within that'll
[1:41:51] release them and give them a strength to
[1:41:53] overcome every complex a strength to
[1:41:56] overcome all of the isms of the world in
[1:41:59] this life
[1:42:00] because I don't believe that anyone
[1:42:02] wants to worship
[1:42:04] around an offense
[1:42:07] there's no edification in that
[1:42:09] is that right
[1:42:11] so let me just close with this
[1:42:18] good old General Lee
[1:42:21] now
[1:42:25] these men even
[1:42:26] brother Brown would talk about Stonewall
[1:42:28] Jackson
[1:42:29] even when you really read I'm not
[1:42:31] talking about NR
[1:42:33] I just say it the history books and
[1:42:35] stuff that's out now it's just like when
[1:42:36] I taught history and things in school
[1:42:39] when they wanted to me to teach certain
[1:42:42] things on Black History Month I'm on a
[1:42:43] pool from where I went to Africa and I'm
[1:42:46] going to teach it the real way
[1:42:48] I'm going to teach things for how it
[1:42:49] really was I don't want to know all of
[1:42:51] these channels of how things were and
[1:42:52] whatever
[1:42:53] but sometimes we have things that where
[1:42:55] it's been kind of you know distorted and
[1:42:57] I I just say that because these were men
[1:42:59] as brother Branham would call it these
[1:43:00] when you really read about these men
[1:43:02] these were men of character
[1:43:05] and generally the one of the advice that
[1:43:08] he he gave there was a woman
[1:43:12] she was in Kentucky
[1:43:14] and uh
[1:43:16] it was a beautiful tree that was in her
[1:43:18] yard and this tree had been all shot to
[1:43:21] pieces I mean the the bark was off the
[1:43:25] trunk limbs were blown off of it
[1:43:30] so General Robert E Lee had went there
[1:43:34] and she
[1:43:35] got Robert E Lee and she said
[1:43:39] General come here
[1:43:40] she said I want you to look at what they
[1:43:42] what these federal troops did to this
[1:43:44] tree
[1:43:46] they blew all these holes in it and now
[1:43:49] this is years after
[1:43:52] she's still living
[1:43:55] with what had been done
[1:43:58] and here's the great words that General
[1:43:59] Lee gave her when he looked at her
[1:44:02] he said ma'am
[1:44:04] cut it down and burn it
[1:44:08] in other words quit living in the past
[1:44:13] oh if you're hurt
[1:44:15] no not big brown words but you know what
[1:44:18] there's some trees we need to cut down
[1:44:19] and just what burn it
[1:44:22] amen not a man-made fire but let the
[1:44:24] fire of God come down amen let's cut it
[1:44:27] down instead of living but you say we'll
[1:44:29] do the same though what's wrong with
[1:44:30] that because you realize friends
[1:44:31] sometimes with things that you can keep
[1:44:33] in your life
[1:44:35] that can actually keep God at Bay
[1:44:39] I want to be close to him
[1:44:42] I want to draw closer and how do I draw
[1:44:44] closer when there's something that
[1:44:45] stands out
[1:44:47] that he'll deal with my heart and I can
[1:44:49] see it
[1:44:50] I want to act like God
[1:44:53] I want I may not be able to break bread
[1:44:55] off and bread come on and I may not be
[1:44:57] able to take just a little bit of fishes
[1:44:58] and break it off and more fish come I
[1:45:00] may not that may not be what I'm called
[1:45:02] to do
[1:45:04] but I am called like everybody else
[1:45:07] to forgive
[1:45:09] I am called
[1:45:10] because I'm part of the I've received
[1:45:13] the pass over
[1:45:15] so I've got the strength to give a pass
[1:45:19] to give a Passover
[1:45:22] purifyeth ourselves
[1:45:24] even as he is pure don't you love him
[1:45:27] tonight
[1:45:28] that's powerheads I
[1:45:34] Hallelujah
[1:45:37] Lord Jesus
[1:45:42] oh God
[1:45:45] as we look Lord into your word and
[1:45:48] more than just a page more than a letter
[1:45:52] it's beholding your character beholding
[1:45:56] your image Lord
[1:45:59] father I pray tonight God
[1:46:03] that Lord as you had just been sweeping
[1:46:05] through the building sweeping through
[1:46:06] each of our hearts
[1:46:08] I pray Heavenly Father tonight Lord as
[1:46:10] we
[1:46:11] Lord God would desire that you would
[1:46:15] just pass Lord very
[1:46:18] just closely O Lord
[1:46:21] may we lord God it's not something that
[1:46:24] we can try to do from the outside
[1:46:27] but may we lord live
[1:46:30] from that of the inside that
[1:46:33] purifying
[1:46:36] by the Pure Source
[1:46:39] oh Lord Jesus
[1:46:42] there's no words Lord sometimes we look
[1:46:45] for words that would somehow dispel
[1:46:49] that dear God at
[1:46:51] it's getting in your presence Lord It's
[1:46:54] just Lord and that first of all that
[1:46:56] starts just even in these moments Lord
[1:46:58] as your word is coming I don't want to
[1:47:00] draw back
[1:47:02] I want to move forward Lord
[1:47:04] that's you lord it's drawing me it's
[1:47:07] drawing us into that place Lord I don't
[1:47:10] believe there's any heart here tonight
[1:47:12] that would want to distance themselves
[1:47:14] from you Lord I'll just I'll just say
[1:47:17] that Lord tonight I don't believe that
[1:47:19] Lord Hearts would come here with the
[1:47:21] desire to get further from you
[1:47:23] but I believe God that every desire is
[1:47:25] to say Lord
[1:47:27] I want to draw nine to you
[1:47:30] Lord that my thoughts
[1:47:32] if they're contrary to your thoughts
[1:47:34] Lord
[1:47:36] then oh God we dismiss them Lord by the
[1:47:40] grace of almighty God let me Lord think
[1:47:43] like you Lord
[1:47:45] help us the Lord as a people
[1:47:49] oh God how that sometimes the Lord with
[1:47:52] even past offenses if we're not careful
[1:47:57] it can actually become
[1:48:00] what hinders us Lord
[1:48:02] from even opening and accepting other
[1:48:07] friendships
[1:48:09] that you want to send our way
[1:48:13] oh help us Lord
[1:48:15] your God in our hearts Lord as as people
[1:48:18] because we still have feelings Lord when
[1:48:21] the Holy Ghost has come we don't do away
[1:48:23] with our feelings
[1:48:25] but God help us Lord It's a natural
[1:48:28] tendency sometimes in our lives to draw
[1:48:31] back when we've been hurt Lord
[1:48:34] but I don't want to live by the natural
[1:48:37] tendency
[1:48:39] of a natural man
[1:48:41] when Lord I believe with all my heart
[1:48:44] I have a supernatural birth
[1:48:48] let me Lord God in everything Lord I may
[1:48:51] never walk on the water
[1:48:53] Lord God I may not Lord God be used in
[1:48:56] certain ways that's okay
[1:48:59] but oh God
[1:49:01] may I Lord from every from the very
[1:49:04] depths of my heart
[1:49:06] forgive
[1:49:08] and live a life Lord
[1:49:10] that oh God to where that oil of God on
[1:49:14] the inside we just cleanse Lord anything
[1:49:17] that would want to get caught
[1:49:20] in our feathers Lord
[1:49:22] we want to fly
[1:49:24] we want to move in the liberty of the
[1:49:26] Holy Spirit
[1:49:28] and Lord how the enemy Will Spring it's
[1:49:30] true he Springs traps on us
[1:49:32] but father
[1:49:34] it's in these moments Lord
[1:49:37] that when you come
[1:49:39] and not only will you make yourself
[1:49:41] known but it's also a moment
[1:49:44] that we might grow
[1:49:46] to be more like you
[1:49:48] and like job had said when I come out of
[1:49:52] this it's going to be less of Samuel and
[1:49:55] more of God
[1:49:57] Lord Jesus you know the process the
[1:49:59] refining process Lord that we
[1:50:03] must go through
[1:50:05] and it's true Lord it isn't always in
[1:50:08] forgiveness this is just Lord a part of
[1:50:10] it but I think
[1:50:12] in order Lord just for us to operate
[1:50:15] as a local body
[1:50:17] even within our homes in our marriages
[1:50:20] in relationships
[1:50:22] oh God
[1:50:24] this is an absolute necessity
[1:50:28] may we live close Lord and in your
[1:50:31] presence to where it is recorded of your
[1:50:34] character and your nature thou art a god
[1:50:38] who is ready
[1:50:39] to forgive
[1:50:42] plenteous
[1:50:43] in Mercy
[1:50:45] that's where I want to live Lord
[1:50:47] if that's the address the Lord to be
[1:50:49] found that's where I want to be found
[1:50:51] We Can't Stop Lord the things from
[1:50:54] coming out I'm trying to stop this from
[1:50:57] happening I'm stopping Lord God we can
[1:50:58] try to stop so many things that we end
[1:51:00] up living in a little bubble house
[1:51:04] love itself is a risk
[1:51:10] but it's a risk worth taking
[1:51:14] relationships Lord all throughout this
[1:51:17] building
[1:51:18] we've all been hurt in one way or
[1:51:21] another
[1:51:22] something Lord has been said maybe this
[1:51:25] has been done
[1:51:27] oh God
[1:51:29] help us Lord to realize
[1:51:32] help us Lord I pray
[1:51:34] oh God Lord my hands are Up My Heart
[1:51:38] Lord God before you Lord
[1:51:40] I don't want anything Lord to stick
[1:51:44] if there's anything in Lord in my heart
[1:51:46] if there be anything Lord in the heart
[1:51:48] of anyone
[1:51:49] anybody want to join me
[1:51:51] if there's anything Lord
[1:51:54] Lord God
[1:51:56] would you make it known Lord
[1:51:58] I don't want anything Lord God to
[1:52:02] hold me back I don't want anything Lord
[1:52:05] that God that would
[1:52:07] Kink up the hose stop the channel
[1:52:11] I wanted to be a place where you can
[1:52:14] come like it says in the Song of Solomon
[1:52:16] where you can put your head
[1:52:19] in my lap
[1:52:21] oh God a place where you can find rest a
[1:52:25] place where there's a peace oh Lord that
[1:52:27] you can come into your garden lord it's
[1:52:29] a place of Solace a place of rest a
[1:52:32] place of delight a place
[1:52:35] that is secluded and shut out from the
[1:52:38] rest of the world
[1:52:40] what a paradox Lord
[1:52:42] we see it in this life this world that
[1:52:44] we're living in
[1:52:46] hatred
[1:52:48] is such a common place Lord
[1:52:52] oh God
[1:52:54] but in the midst of it all
[1:52:56] how could we stand
[1:52:59] if it wasn't for you Lord
[1:53:02] but God it's what you've done within us
[1:53:04] lord it's your work the love of God that
[1:53:07] is shed abroad in our hearts
[1:53:10] and Lord we want to live from that
[1:53:12] source of life
[1:53:15] that purifying I want to be in contact
[1:53:16] and I want to live
[1:53:18] from the source of life
[1:53:22] that Lord is placed Within Me
[1:53:26] because that's the Shekinah
[1:53:28] that's that light Lord that keeps and
[1:53:31] watches over our life that the word
[1:53:32] itself never corrupts never grows moldy
[1:53:36] but it stays fresh
[1:53:39] help us Lord
[1:53:40] that our lives might always remain fresh
[1:53:43] it's a battle Lord it will be a battle
[1:53:45] there will be many things Lord even now
[1:53:48] that we have to pray through
[1:53:51] but it's worth it Lord
[1:53:53] help us Lord I pray
[1:53:55] oh God May every bit of our worship go
[1:53:58] to you
[1:53:59] if there's any Idol in our life God of
[1:54:01] an offense and this did me wrong and so
[1:54:04] and so did me wrong and this happened
[1:54:06] and this Lord even if it's an idol of
[1:54:08] Mama and Daddy of what Daddy did or an
[1:54:10] uncle did or an aunt did oh God may we
[1:54:13] recognize that there is a cleansing Lord
[1:54:16] Jesus to relieve us
[1:54:18] from that Idol
[1:54:20] that would produce nothing but
[1:54:23] bitterness and resentment
[1:54:26] oh granted Lord tonight may we lord as
[1:54:29] we stand and have stood in the washing
[1:54:31] of Water by the word
[1:54:32] granted tonight Lord I pray may you
[1:54:35] grant Lord to every heart Lord what's
[1:54:39] needed tonight Lord in the name of Jesus
[1:54:42] Christ
[1:54:43] amen
[1:54:46] don't you love him
[1:54:50] amen if you'd like to stand
[1:54:53] you know it's a Moment Like This
[1:54:56] I don't know about you but
[1:54:58] you know even as you look at things and
[1:55:00] praying about it and pray about it
[1:55:03] much before you bring it
[1:55:07] there's just something about it that you
[1:55:08] just it's so wonderful
[1:55:11] when you really can just let go and let
[1:55:13] God just scour it all out
[1:55:15] it's just there's a refreshing that
[1:55:17] comes from that it's refreshing that the
[1:55:19] world wouldn't understand
[1:55:21] you know the things friends is the world
[1:55:23] can argue they can they can hold on to
[1:55:26] their offenses people can hold on to
[1:55:28] offenses but I'll just say it like this
[1:55:30] you'll never get any further with God
[1:55:33] when God brings that to light
[1:55:36] you'll never get any further
[1:55:39] you've got to relinquish that
[1:55:42] why
[1:55:43] for if you forgive not others of their
[1:55:45] trespasses
[1:55:46] neither will your heavenly father
[1:55:48] forgive you of your trespasses
[1:55:52] I want to live in Liberty don't you I
[1:55:55] want to walk in Liberty
[1:55:57] I want to I want to live in that place
[1:56:00] where brother Romans he talks about in
[1:56:03] perfect faith
[1:56:04] living in that channel
[1:56:08] for that Faith to drop in
[1:56:11] this is the very text that he reads out
[1:56:13] of
[1:56:14] my brother bran will take a time in
[1:56:16] perfect faith and he'll deal with that
[1:56:19] faith is based on forgiveness
[1:56:25] I believe that's what we're called to
[1:56:27] do I believe it's easy no
[1:56:30] I'm just from experience
[1:56:32] is it like the switch on that wall over
[1:56:34] there I wish it was
[1:56:37] I wish it was I'm just going to be
[1:56:39] honest
[1:56:41] it isn't just something I just say hey
[1:56:45] but it's right here
[1:56:47] it's right here
[1:56:49] this is where it has to be dealt with
[1:56:52] and I have to invite him and hope first
[1:56:54] of all
[1:56:55] I've got to get in his presence
[1:56:58] then realize that I've got need of him
[1:57:01] what I need you to cleanse
[1:57:03] the hurt
[1:57:04] I need you to cleanse the offense
[1:57:06] because it's it's real
[1:57:08] when I say it's real
[1:57:10] we don't want to make a God out of it
[1:57:14] I want to say Lord
[1:57:16] take every Idol out
[1:57:19] take it all out
[1:57:22] because I want it to be a place that you
[1:57:24] can put your head
[1:57:25] where you can rest
[1:57:27] you know what's wonderful is when he
[1:57:30] deals with our lives like this you know
[1:57:31] what he's saying
[1:57:33] put your hand in mind
[1:57:36] I'm here with you
[1:57:38] you're not alone
[1:57:40] I'm right here with you
[1:57:42] we're gonna take us
[1:57:45] the foxes
[1:57:47] not take you take us
