Lord God we walk in that liberty granite Lord Jesus we pray in the name of Jesus Christ we give ourselves Lord as speaker and congregation into your hands Lord and ask that you would have your way in the service in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Colossians chapter 1 I'd like to say God bless you each and every one of you so good to be here in his presence it's all I could do to stay in that office y'all having a time out here if we come to church and don't have a time something's wrong it may not be exactly always the same because sometimes how God will move but it ought to be something that thrills our heart that we want his presence to draw near you know the scripture tells us drawl 9 to God and he'll draw 9 to you brethren was very clear in in taking that scripture for us who said to draw 9 to God he said his begin to meditate and think on him he says you begin to think on him and he let us know there's a lot of things that we can think about that our cares of this life and we do have to think about him but don't let him be the meditation think about it do it but then entertaining him and then he draws near ain't that wonderful it's so wonderful I want to before I read the scriptures here I want to thank the Sunday school kids and I got back from my trip had a lot of drawings there and a lot of letters of encouragement and I really appreciate that so much if any of the rest of you adults try to draw a drawing well we won't say nothing else but I really appreciate that and those are things and I just tuck away it just really means a lot amen Colossians 1 verse 12 giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who have delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son so we were under another ruling power at one time but when we have been delivered from that and then translated in to once we're delivered and then translated into the real you the real me can begin to be expressed in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him we're all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist amen god bless you we'll let you be seated here and like to keep on reading here just a moment in verse 18 there and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence to see how that he has gained this preeminence and I want you just to think of this and let this just stay with you just for throughout the service and then in the next that Rite of preeminence in the midst of our life belong to him but there's a way that he came to take his throne he did not take his throne and has not taken his throne in your life nor will he any under sound of my voice he will take it by force but he comes and he wins this battle by divine love because God's desire preeminence is not just where we as a person are doing those things which are right but it's where righteousness itself is reigning on the inside and it is not only the actions that we're doing but in every aspect of our life he is preeminent he's the preeminent one in our thoughts he is the center just like in a garden many of the times some of the gardens we have in in the parks and things like that and I think of that beautiful rose garden over there by the lake I'm glad that's close to me you go up through that rose garden that they have set up with all the different roses but there is a center most part and all the rest of it is just filler all of the paths in that garden point to one main focus so when a garden is being developed everything else the flowers are beautiful all those things are wonderful but all of those point to a focus that he who planted the garden wants the focus to be on that which is the center of all those things so we recognize that that is God's desire is that he would be the center of our lives and of our hearts and so as we keep that in mind to gain this preeminence that which is chief that which is first place he does not take this by force but it is by divine love verse 19 it said for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven so when the purchase was made there at Calvary there was a reconciling that took place in in that where the debt itself was settled where that those who were gathered by the Spirit of God in looking forward for the Lamb that was to come all of those who died under that in the elect and were waiting for the fulfillment of this word they themselves we know that the scripture says that they were waiting in paradise but when he descends down there in paradise after the payment has been made he himself after the depositing of sins holds the authority then to loosen them paradise itself is done away with and those that as they were held in paradise now in his ascension they themselves are as they have been placed already in what what has been revealed to them now has become substance now and here they are being transported they are ascending up with him their sacrifice that they were looking forward to by eyes of Revelation and now here what has been revealed has now become substance and it is now lifting them out of the very hold of paradise and when we look at it to think of how brother Branham will tell with this particular scripture and he'll make a statement and stop there and I'm not going to dwell on this today but he'll stop when reading this for a text and he says look where that reconciliation goes because the reconciliation does not stop here in time it's not just us where there is a uniting to where there is a change within our nature but there is a complete salvation which is the matching of the body with what God has done on the inside and to wear that there is a complete reconciling to that of our our new home this is our this is our promised land that we see coming into sight and this is where we are dwelling as Joshua and Caleb stood there and notice as Brillion will place it Joshua and Caleb standing there he says as we see our Promised Land coming inside what is our promised land our promised land is not just that of the baptism of the Holy Ghost yet that is the token in the fullness in this hour but it is that to where we can look in my father's house are many mansions and if I go away to prepare a place for you I will come again so his coming I will come again and receive you unto myself so well the world is looking for a coming for him to step out on the clouds his coming is secret his coming has come in you and I when his life is coming you and I that this is the bride coming the coming of the Lord its Christ coming in his body that he has been building through the ages so then we begin to see where we're at even in time and why that even when we're looking at the seals we're looking at the word we realize it's not it's not adding something new but it's bringing to light what is always late here and when God begins to take what's always late here there is power and authority within this word when Christ himself gets a hold of it to be able to loosen you and I to be able to cleanse you and I and to be able to fill us and equip us to where our life is a reflection of what has been wrote god bless you god see brother brother Williams uncle god bless you sir god bless you appreciate having you here amen wonderful amen here we stand there's a need in this hour what God God made a promise back in Genesis 3 after the fall had taken place and he says to that he says of the woman thy seed shall bruise the head of the serpent and he said I'll put enmity between these two seeds we know that the woman has no seed the woman is a field was that right she is a garden and but yet within it so for her to have a seed it would have to be God himself that would give her a sea but yet this he could not just give her a seed and her supply the egg but it must be God himself coming down and become one of us it had to be a kinsman redeemer it had to be one who was born and the other human race one who where there would be a blood that was not a polluted blood it was had to be one to wear that Satan couldn't could not put any claim upon his life so there had to be one who was made in the likeness of sinful flesh but yet in his nature I want you to listen to me now in his nature there was nothing sinful about his nature Oh glory be to God this requirement was made for the virgin birth it was made and you know brother man we'll take it like this in the message of reach he said God will put requirements on my we could just spend months on this statement right here he said God will make a requirement he said and then there's nothing you can do about it it's all left up left up to God to fulfill that promise no matter how righteous or how holy or any of them were within the Old Testament and by the way any holiness or any righteousness that could be attributed to them was not because of their mere status or their genes within the natural but it was because a holy God had spoke through their hearts a righteous God had moved upon their life there's no sir as a holy mountain it's a mountain where a holy God comes down is that right so here we find that there's not one of them that could produce what was needed but yet their lives only pointed and was only testifying there's going to be a ram come on this mountain come on somebody their lives was pointing and testifying there's one who's going to come and they were all searching and they were waiting around they were looking but here God Himself is the only one that could produce this kind of a sinless character this kind of a sinless nature and God had a reason there's a there's a reason of how that His grace stepped in to overshadow that law and I began to look at this here when I just thinking you know and in this whole thought of reconciliation mind I'll tell you for some time it's just been so permeated and percolating on my heart and I began to look at it of how that we were starting in this last week or a few weeks ago and you know you find of how that the Lord Jesus himself here God found in sending because the Lord Jesus is not a second person he's not someone separate and you might say what little Sammy we already know that but you know there might be some that don't and I believe what needs to be emphasized and to recognize that it is no one other that has redeemed us but God himself coming down and becoming one of us and what if he's redeeming he's redeeming what belongs to him what belongs to him God's sons and daughters of God we are ships off that diamond we are parts of that masterpiece but we ourselves do not have within ourselves the ability to redeem but that little chip that's off the masterpiece when it begins to strike and everything begins to line up there is an expression of the word that can be played from the buckin sail like this from the vinyl of our soul that will actually begin to pick up the song of redemption the sounding it begins to play it out that little that little chip off the diamond begins to reflect the great diamond himself so to think of this of that the Lord Jesus himself coming down and becoming one of us I look at this in Philippians 2 verse 7 and this is a just a to me just an astounding thing that's just so gripped my heart he made himself of no reputation you know how brother Bram talks about he said the guy who invented false teeth made himself a reputation the guy who made a prosthetic leg he said they he put his name on it he made himself of no reputation when they tried to pull him out tried to get him to present himself and show himself even from after the temptation on the Mount clear to where it came amongst his brethren in John seven he made himself of no reputation this scriptures wound so tight that the very purpose of God I want you to understand because this pertains to you and I it shows the prevailing power of the very purpose and mystery of Christ working in our life but let me tell you something that it is God's prevailing power moving upon that which has already been wrote in our life that cannot be defeated because that is God and let me tell you something it's by that strain of predestination whereby the flow of redemption moves down and it is Christ himself raising up his own sons and daughters of God to where that the characteristics that are spoken the word of Christ to be manifests in this hour are reflected in the hearts and lives of the believer and you can't help but reflect it you can't help but reflect it just like the natural genes of your parents you can't help that I mean you know unless you want to be like some peoples lived and had a thousand nose job and everything else but the jeans are still there they're still there they're still there certain things you'll catch yourself and you'll think man I'm starting to act like dad about this I find myself that even this year I find myself and I catch myself and I just smile oh lordy you know my dad's already go over on the other side but Here I am these jeans keep coming and some of the things brother Dominic you know how it is there's some of things I used to pick with him about he's here you can say you remember but it's a prevailing of those characteristics that have laid in our lives house let's look at this here just for a little bit this morning and he took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross that's a very that's a very important statement he became obedient unto death we look many times just at the cross but remember before the cross was gasps M&E and in all aspects of his life he was tempted he was tested the Bible says this in all points such as we are he was tempted to be drawn to the tomb of Lazarus before it was time but God here was he was he was reserved to the will of the Father you know this is the thing when Jesus was speaking about rest he was speaking about that place for you and I to enter into to as we enter into through the atmosphere of that life not only permeating in our souls but also dwelling there it would bring you and I into a place of rest because the truth be known there's many times we are too strong there's many times where there's and see that here's God working the whole time and we don't have time to cover all this the God will work many times and he's moving in our lives even now to bring you and I into a place of greater trust to where that we're trusting it's he doesn't want us to submit to him out of fear he does not want that he wants submission he had brought me to his banqueting table and his standard his banner all for me is love my mouth we could go on with that but his love that's the standard this is the part he wants our hearts be brought in submission so he humbles himself this was not something that was just a given but I want you to notice here has the word is continually coming and being unfolded in his life he was always the word is that right but here we find that we're the word itself now the word the promises are quickened to him after he comes up out of the River Jordan and those promises being quickened to him here he is in his life every day is a life of humility now let me just say this to you and let's just leave this right out clearly a person can be ever so humble and you can see a person and say they're humble but that don't mean that they got the Holy Ghost there's a lot of good humble people but remember Cain was humble are you with me there's many people that have the Verte that have all of those virtues in the natural in their life and yet not capped are you with me so what is it it's a humility to the word it's a humility to Christ amen in the message desperation the Prophet said to take our shoes off will not be good enough he said but humility is a life that will bring forth the fruits of the spirit so it must be his fruit in his season it must be the fruit of his life coming forth in our life whereby that that is a testimony the fruit is a testimony of the life in the vine glory be to God but he became obedient this scripture it shows of even the the the warfare that went on between his will and God's will you know what I'm talking about as the Prophet lays the statement like this in the church age book here he is he said contending with himself who do you contend with beside me do you want me to start naming names no well you don't know so-and-so yeah but but really is it so-and-so or is it how so-and-so is or what so-and-so does that raises up something different in you to where then it brings you to a place to say Lord I don't want this in my life what are you doing contending with yourself and by standing on that and say this temple is reserved for my lord you're contending with yourself and at the same time you are humbling yourself and becoming obedient unto death because the Holy Ghost in your life it makes the word empower it brings the word from a letter a letter killeth but the Spirit gives life it brings it from a letter and giveth it power in your life you became obedient unto death what was looked at here within the garden of gethsemane here's a garden and I some of this was a little bit over from where we were at the last time but I want you to catch this here he was in the midst of a garden there was a fall in the garden back there but here in this time he comes to the garden and notice he leaves the disciples back here he says watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation he himself knows a little part from them and he begins to pray here is now where a great conference is to be set in in this conference there is a Specter spectators that show up much like it did for Samson when Samson was in the midst of everything Samson's strength he was able by his strength to slay many of the Philistines but it was when Samson came to a place after he had already been taken captive he was led by a little child to a place and he said lead me to the place upon which this temple rest you see God comes to the very root of the problem and here he leads him right to where you see the child knew where this simple place was it ain't something deep it's very simple God hides in simplicity but then he reveals himself in the same here here is Samson standing here in the midst of it you see what it was his heart to Delilah brought him in bondage but when it wind sensing himself was always a part of the Covenant and as he was there in bondage and under creeds and under dogmas and he was turning out meal and everything under the enemy's camp but but there began to grow out the seven locks and those that locks that hair that was upon me there he began to think and remember there's a covenant about my life oh my Samson was aware that there was a covenant and there was no Philistine that could strip that covenant away from him let me tell you something I don't care how far you've gone Carol deep you feel you are there is nothing that can strip away that covenant that God himself has made with you before the foundation of the world hallelujah Samson standing there in that time and here in the midst of this time in this hour he defeated more Philistines in his death than he ever did what he was alive what was it it was death that brought the victory his many surrendering all of this but notice when all of a sudden they began to think back here the God who made the Covenant begin to move upon his body and Samson was led to that place and then that midst of that time death itself it brought a defeat within that hour oh that's the same way it was with our Lord Jesus Christ here he is and disseminate there is a conference that's been called as Samson stood in that arena in this very garden right here every demon out of hell was gathered around they were filling all the seats they had it nosebleed seats they had front-row seats they had ten yard line seeds they had all of these seats all around and in the midst of it there was a conference going on and how that God Himself he turns around the Father he said are you willing to go through with it are you willing to go ahead are you willing to go to Calvary because he could not make him do he had to go willingly he couldn't be forced he couldn't be drugged Abel led his lamb he had to pull his lamb but this lamb this lamb didn't have to be pulled this lamb was going to be led to the slaughter they were not going to be led with fetters of man but this lamb was going to be led to the slaughter by the same doubt that had come down and raised up that word on the inside and that same dove that is sought you out that same doubt that's leading you is the same dog that will lead you and me into the rapture that same dog of the Holy Ghost what's he doing he's leading us to that face blessed be his name your love him this morning he became obedient unto death even the death of the cross he already died before he ever went to Calvary he already died before he went to Calvary but he he still was walking around life but he already died to his will he already died to his will but yet that's something that was taking place in secret see this was the third pull of his ministry he had been praying in secret come on somebody and what he had been praying about and what was now happening on the inside that was about to be manifested he reward thee openly this is a crowning of the ministry right here are you as me he already became obedient unto death that same principle friends this same principle is the same thing that applies to our lives across the board on everything it applies to our life in order for you and I to have been born again we first had to die and that's what I want to deal with a little bit no death no resurrection if there's no death there's no resurrection let me just set the stage very clearly body resurrecting the man who dies he's resurrecting the man who was dead but was alive before but it's in submission though it's in submission so all of this this pertains to all of us on everything everything that involves the assembly everything that involves our family everything that involves in the workplace listen we're not handling things you handle things out here first you can get in trouble handle it here first so even when brother Brandon water was made known to him of that trap that Satan was laying for him even God making that known to him the Prophet didn't take it lightly he prayed about that he didn't know when it was going to be he didn't know but then after it was taken place then God made it known this was that trap now look at this those young people and how that they were acting in that service that was totally inappropriate is that right but notice how the Prophet moved within that time and what he spoke within that notice the grace of God maybe they had never heard anything like this before you understand no doubt about it there's no maybe that something they had never even heard before but notice God's grace come down because at the same time how many was standing there when there would be prayer lines taking place and things going on and yet many was standing there even ministers that would not put their head down when that when the Holy Spirit was right there discerning those diseases and calling them out the Prophet himself could not even stand in the way of that he said because you would not bow your head now you have those disease and that ministry noticed the ministry and all that were under it notice they fell under that is that right it it shows within it in the midst of it within our hearts must in our hearts be reconciled unto God and in our hearts we must be reconciled it's just like if there's any any division in your home before words can come there's got to be a reconciliation on the inside are you with me this quote I love this quote God hiding in himself in simplicity he says now he hid his self in the death of Christ but manifested himself in the resurrection there had to be a death according to the will of God according to the will of God it was not all age were not so fast you with me old age wouldn't do it well he was the lamb but he had to be offered willingly had to be the lamb all the types full of an innocent one it had to be one that would offer his life so it had to be according to the will of God if he had to offer up according to the will of God in order to pay the debt and the price then there is also where we must come according to the will of God in order to be recognized and reconciled by his death hallelujah so there had to be there had to be the rejection had to be the death had to be the suffering everything I want you to catch he must willingly surrender his life listen now to the satisfying of the father to the satisfying of the father men could watch as he walked standing there in Pilot Sport that could watch as he walked down the way to Calvary men could watch the Prophet speaks to us of even how that Satan himself he said he said was looking at him at that time it said this just can't be the Son of God son of God wouldn't put up with this but brother BAM said sons of God will put up as long as they know they're doing the will of God you see what gives you authority it's not I'm not going to say it's being focused on his will if you get your eyes off of him and off of his will your mouth will start going Oh Lord pastor got back in town but his will this is where the Prophet could say many places identification he said that the Lord Jesus himself never paid any attention to the criticism it was all around me it didn't cease it got more and more and more and more understand when he's down here at the base of his life there's a many following but as he moves towards the crowning it's a narrowing down criticizing itself does not disease it increases but this is where if we're locked in into the program and plan of God and now you can see why that Satan worked so hard with things to try to bring things up in our life and even when it's things that you and I that we can't truly say this is a test or trial you just have to say this is just a dumb mistake that I made are you with me but in the midst of what we can say God teach me help me Lord help me because the Bible does say that he'll make all things work together for our good he can teach us things I we see that very clearly so been with so that within the midst of it here must be then a satisfying according to the Father so this is going to take one that maybe the rest of them could look and say hey hey let up he let up he's he's already met the requirement but the father's looking deeper the fathers are looking deeper beyond what we can see on the outside you with me it's got to be a death on the inside and that's a death that only the father can see and when that death happens don't worry the outside will be reconciled to the inside because when that of the RAM of the heifer was offered up they took it in to the innermost part of the tabernacle and as they sprinkled that blood on the altar then they took it in there the holy place and then you know as they worked from the innermost part they worked to the outer and the holy place and then to the outer court what were they doing they were reconciling all the courts together because the whole building was called the tabernacle of God and you and I are the tabernacle of God and God Himself dwells in a three-room house this is why when death happens on the inside then it gives you power to reconcile those flus or those gates it gives you the power to reconcile that human spirit that human spirit will never take the place of your theophany but you have with inside of you the deposit that gives you strength by the word to rule over those gates you with me Nehemiah you with me near mine and you've got an answer on the inside tooth and knows how to open up your understanding glory be to God in the highest and when he reconciles that s what everything on the outside starts looking right to dress starts happening open theirs even I mean not only in dress starts happening you know earrings truck falling off pants drop and you know not just pants you know we talked about for the sister but even these homosexual jeans they got out there now for the boys these skinny jeans you can save money and go to hardware store and get you a can of spray paint I'm telling you friends these things are real there's demons on them racks try to go in just a regular store and buy a suit nowadays it's a problem well I ain't gonna preach on that concern you know I just I'm not gonna do it but it anyway it is a reality that we need to take account about because they're sissies also making the clothes and they also are trying to accentuate things on men on the way you're going Lord but we'll go you see its reconciling all parts but if the Holy Ghost only follows on the spirit that's soul still in reconciling and that soul will say but I tell you what I can do this the Holy Ghost comes and falls on me but still not reconciled who see the father has to see it has to be satisfied in order for this life to be dispersed can we read in Isaiah 53 verse 10 verse 10 yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin his soul and offering for sin his soul you this was an innocent one innocent he shall see his seed notice within this I want you to catch this he shall see his seed isn't Isis he shall prolong his days he saw me and you through this suffering through this purchase he saw me in you this is what the purchase was about he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he's hiding in the death Satan doesn't know what's going on if Satan would have known what was going on Johnson and Johnson would not have been the band-aid manufacturer Satan listen to me if Satan would have known what was going on he would have tried everything to prevent this death it'll be preached from hell that is why Satan down through the ages he knows the power when death itself finishes him that's why he's trying to stop lives from coming to a place of death because before you can be born again you must die but he's hidden in the secret of death you see Satan can sit here and scan in this audience right here this morning you said well they ain't even an altar call going on but the kingdom of God cometh without observation hey man Christ in chat will radrat in on our lives in a white horse come on until my revelations 19 his name is called the Word of God till ran ran in and he'll they didn't to reveal and move past the vesture z' of our life and he begins to take over our life and the devil don't even know what's going on he can't do nothing about it because it's Christ drawing you don't you let that devil try to tell you that he's got power he's been stripped of every power when you and your heart begin to surrender and letting God have his way I tell you the Holy Ghost he'll come right to where you're at right to where your need is let me tell you something they don't have to wait till the end of the service the Holy Ghost the Prophet tells us hearing recognizing acting on the word he said right there when you yourself have come to that place of death you don't have to turn a new leaf he said the fire of God will come down and burn that thing up and your change right there but it's a death that the father sees church members can say hold Bob tell you what what a wonderful guy what a wonderful but God knows whether there's a death there or not well he'll make a wonderful Christian she'll make a wonderful all you don't know I made shield should just do such a wonderful thing she'll be such a blessing your church you don't know how she is in the workplace she worked work work work work work work that's a mule mules can outwork thoroughbreds come on somebody adoption Series mules can outwork a thoroughbred but they can't out Jean a thoroughbred a thoroughbred is a thoroughbred is a thoroughbred because he was always a thoroughbred he's got papers that traces it all the way back I'm not talking about church papers I'm talking about that he has within that same life that ties him back and identifies him all the way through the book to where that have you lived in the days of not you'd have been working on New York if you lived in the days of Moses you'd have been standing right there by his side glory be to God he shall see OMA he shall see of the travail of his sword the travail of his soul what is this death death he shall see and hear the death gurgle the death rattle and shall be satisfied you mean God would draw me and sometimes work on a person's life for years yeah yeah don't get impatient friends if you've already have this witness in your heart it'll give you grace for others it will also because if you've got this in your heart you're you're in partnership with the Redeemer it puts you in a place to where that you'll pray come on brother Bram tells us he said for us as mature soldiers he said we are to contend he said with those who would be weak and in mature he said now they'll talk about this one they'll talk about that one they'll say this they'll do this they got all this and they're all he said but as mature Christians he said as we endure he said as you pray he said eventually once they become mature Christians they make fine soldiers then are you with me the church listen right here this this right here it's a place of birth come on friends it's a place of birth it's a place to where God Himself is able to we want him to be able to move can you imagine if you come in here with the critical Spirit and you get to look in whether it's an me or whether it's at anything else don't you recognize friends that that's a devil trying to Fort birth you say brother saying I've been born again but you still need to die daily you and me both but look how Satan that slewfoot he knows if he can get in here and get the attitude twisted just a long day it will prevent death you know why he does that because he's afraid it's too cold it's too hot it's too loud it's too quiet it's true this it's true that friends those things don't matter they don't matter they don't give you a rap string faith because if we make it too cold for you it'll be too hot for it'll be 2 to 2 mil warm for somebody else where they need to be warmer we're making one for somebody else and you're here you are sitting we make this quiet we make this loud just remember you're not the absolute he is who you're Jesus my my my mind it don't matter how long you've been in a message my question is how long has it been in you you can be born and raised in this and still it not be preeminent in your life this is not about doing things because what brother Brown said this here and we do it here because of that that's stealing preeminence that's law it must be a love affair I'm telling you straight out if it's not a love affair you need to get a heart checkup glory be to God let's go on now and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many how many of you know he knew what he was doing by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many so when he went to Calvary he knew what he was doing by his knowledge when we are in that place dwelling there you see God doesn't look it isn't come up here and reliable event says people say come up here and empty out your mind empty out your mind he said you better be careful about that cuz Satan will fill it up he said you get a spirit it won't be the holy ghost it's empty out the heart let the heart be willing to die got to be a death therefore will I divide him a portion with the Great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong who's the strong it's true because he hath poured out his soul unto death I have to go to be to God aren't you glad for that and he was numbered with the transgressors he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors he did not become sinful but your sin and my sin was transferred upon him for he made him to be sin who knew no sin that we might be made the very righteousness of God in him you see this type there was many types in reconciling but when you look at this even in Ruth and Boaz here when Boaz before he can ever take Ruth and be reconciled fully Ruth recognizes who he is then Boaz must go to the one who had a claim on the estate first and he goes to him who had a claim on the stake because he who had a claim on the state it was actually his property and you and I and then listen to me listen to the words closely you and I were the property of Satan what was his property our first birth our first birth we were his property but you see has the man who was there when boys came to him the man said I'm not gonna Mar my inheritance how can i Mar my inheritance I can't redeem that if I take Ruth it'll Mar my inheritance and this is where the Prophet lays it out he said see the devil he was already sin and he said that listen now listen to these words he said the devil could not be countin the devil in order to take away sin it had to be one who was innocent become our sin come on now forsaking all the Prophet tells us he said he could not remain a son and make sinners sons so he himself became a sinner died a sinner these are his words that he might take sinners and make sons but how can he make sons out of sinners because beneath that darkness is a representation that's laying there that's what redemptions all about but the devil could not take away that sin but God came down and was made man a kinsman redeemer that he might shed his blood notice he suffered without the gate he went to the gate and there were the elders gathered around there was a transaction gonna be made at the gate gates refer to transactions a place where things are sealed away a place where debts are settled the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it there's not a transaction of hail that can come against the child of God you with me in the head in the north sorry Satan does need stripped of his power brother Samuel you're preaching that all your preaching that off the ha who was it that was revealed in this hour it was not a church that was revealed it was Christ the mighty Conqueror that has come in plain view Oh God has to do is turn their heart and your heart begins to believe and seek after him and God will come right down to your need glory be to God we were that property but notice God came and he redeemed us I want you to look at this my let me just try to lay this in a little bit we'll see where we get to I want to come back here to this place of the River Jordan because what we find here so now we've moved away from Calvary and we're kind of coming back to a place right here at the River Jordan because the Spirit of God had come down in the past and the Bible tells us in the book of Peter that holy men of old spake as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost David remember David would write take not thy Holy Spirit from me none of them had been sealed because the ceiling is a manifesting of redemption it's laying what rightfully belongs to me we see that down through the Old Testament even where it went Tamar when she came and she was ready to be stoned but when Judah said stone this woman but remember in the transaction in the transaction she had asked for his staff and his signet and when she wins the stones were ready to fly she said the seed I have in me is of this man pray tell if thou canst discern this [Applause] hallelujah what was this that declared what was on the inside his staff and his seal he seeketh such to worship Him in spirit and in truth glory be to God so here at the River Jordan what we see is the lamb coming the lamb is coming the prophet he lays it out in this manner and we see how that here when John he walks out in the water and as a baptizing here as he comes up out of the water the scripture said the heavens were opened to him and that the Holy Spirit descended in the form of a dove and a voice spoke out this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased the Lord in Malachi 3 was suddenly coming to his temple lo a bali has doubt prepared for me he was claiming redeeming what belong to him are you with me he couldn't if that could not happen any other time but he redeemed because here was a lamb I like nature so the dog could come and redeem like nature now you're wondering now you're saying oh brother salmon you got yourself in a fix oh no I don't all of them were identified in the lamb but there was not a blood that had within it the power and authority to release them that they might die to themselves and receive his life so the had to be one cup of light nature pay the price there had to be that reconciling a great event after River Jordan in order for that death to take place that you and I might be redeemed had to be like nature's see Jesus when he went to the River Jordan he was not baptized like you and I when we come up here and we repent of our sins he had no sins repenteth he didn't he didn't have a sinful nature it was a lamb when he came behold the lamb of God it was already the nature was there see that nature was hidden down through the elect why did Satan hey Satan say this about everybody but sitting on it look at enable he's I got him I got him it come to Ezekiel I got him there were many others who were offering lambs many were offering lambs but not all had down beneath a lamb nature that was identified because that lamb nature underneath there you see a Jeremiah and Ezekiel all the elect down through the ages that was looking forward to that it's spoke of this time the Bible says many of the slate Saints arose not Oliver only the elect who were the overcomers in their day got up that's all right so here is this like nature it could not be think about the Holy Spirit has the Prophet dealing with this all the way down through the ministry the lamb and the death it keeps working with it keeps working with it and speaking to the people you were a lamb at one time but it says now you've become like a wolf how do you go from a lamb to a wolf see he says when you go to that when you go to even thinking then rather probably brings it when you go to thinking you've got a right to get even the Holy Ghost takes its flight ephesians grieve not the Spirit of God whereby you are sealed you're not a wolf in sheep's clothing you're a sheep in wolf's clothing you understand for the point that's made okay I'm you tried to visualize that now but this is where brother Brown takes this he spends time on this and the message the token he was a lamb when he came there he did not become a lamb at the River Jordan he already was a lamb you don't become a lamb when you're born again you always were a sheep but that old nature had to die that he might raise up that lamb yes sir it must be the lamb standing in you glory be to God that's the only kind baby then said let me just let me just kind of quote in here don't try to follow me on it he says it was a lamb when it come there it shows predestination that's the only kind Jodeci said he was born Alam raised up a lamb therefore that's the only kind of a true spirit that can receive the word that can receive Christ so it's God coming through his word to worry by his word to bring us on to himself to wear that that old nature dies that the two might blend together because the Holy Ghost will not sit down on a wolf remember this preeminence is not forced he draws us in obedience unto himself is that right he says when he found that nature it was one he could blend into this was a coming of the Lord he blends right into it and yet it happens so secretly that the devil don't know nothing about it but he blends right together oh and he says brother BAM goes on and it's a paragraph 64 he said I wonder today when God leads us to a life of complete surrender and service to Him I wonder if our spirits then sometime don't rebel kind of showing that wonder if we are lambs a lamb is obedient a lamb is self sacrificial it doesn't take claim its own you think about it 1st Corinthians 14 love it love seeketh not his own can lay it down and cheer the wool off of it now you remember we were in some one of the Thursday night services we were talking about that you don't ever see a sheep when they go to shear the wool the sheep just don't stand there and there take the shears and they just said now can you turn around this side this is not a haircut but there are people who are trained to know how to handle that sheep to be able to remove the war that's why in every test in every trial he's right there he knows just how to hold you so you don't hurt yourself he ain't interested in nobody else he's right there he is the Good Shepherd the Lord is my shepherd he knows how to hold you move you around or watch some guys do it they'll move it around the pulling up here man they're sharing that that will off and that lamb will just lay there this is the rest that we have in here I know when things come up sometimes in our life it takes us by surprise and that's where we look at the scripture and monitors thinking not streams the fiery trials that have come upon you but just know this that when God has permitted anything to come our way this is a time for us to rest in his hands and say Lord shear off what needs to be sheared off sure it away Lord God did get every part of the wool because I don't want to run around with just one big old patch of wool hanging on me somewhere like I'm thinking what you and now if somebody's running away with a patch of wool they slipped out but the Bible says in the book of Corinthians he will not permit something to come your way that he himself does not provide sufficient grace in order for you to bear it he is faithful once you love him this morning maybe we'll just try to descend on this point here this lamb he leads us to a life of self sacrificing this is where God Himself continuing to move the whole time in our life it's continuing to lead us onward into a greater sacrifice and once you just to think of this and let me close on this the book of Romans says in Romans 12:1 and 2 it speaks to us by brethren by the mercies of God that you would present yourself as a living sacrifice holy and it goes through all of these things how can you or me present ourselves in that way by receiving what he has given to us we are like Esther called by the love letter and the rest are telling hey GI hey guy we want this we want that we want this we want this we see it they're not dead hello somebody they're not dead we want this we want these jewels we want this we but Esther comes in all the Bible Bible said she had such a spirit upon her she comes in there and the Bible says she took nothing but what hey guy the Kings Chamberlain required hey guy the Kings Chamberlain is a very type of the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost himself that has overseen the calling of his bride down through the ages he's had messengers and under messengers and it's been him making up his bride she's not dressed to reflect an idea her dress wear reflects who her husband is and that that dress we're reflecting who her husband is she's clothed in the fine linen which is the righteousness of the saints she has said I'll take nothing but what you say I need you see you see already in here she's already died she's ready to be united she's ready to be United because God can't marry if you still got a living husband who can't do it you make him an adulterer and all somebody has got to be a death then when there's a death he says she's free Abigail's mind now come on somebody preach with me a little bit Abigail's mine now he has authority to raise you up and marry you don't you loving I take only what you require Lord what you require not what I but what you require surrender and the whole time here is God he's watching he sees down beneath and when he sees that death he says no it's just like you wonder why certain things maybe haven't taken place he don't just leave this on a level of just we're talking about the new birth because that's every service and this is I want you to see that there's got to be a death before he can ever raise up what was alive once before right his thoughts are real and eternal but it's the same way with everything within our lives that we come in contact with everything we have to be willing to die and this is a question we've got to ask ourselves who do we want to be revealed in this situation us or him in order for him to be revealed we have to die to ourselves how has he been revealed to you how has he come to be revealed to you and me how because he died in order to bring this revelation to you and me so it applies in every part of our life sometimes you know as I said when it comes to things within a family comes the church comes with things on your job there's things it has to start here you know I'm not preaching now neither have I been preaching by letters this is experience it's got to be here sometimes you don't even realize when you've still got something in your heart when you get before God God can let you know you know sometimes sometimes you can thank you forgiving but if you're still talking about it you ain't forgiven when it's truly forgiven I'm talking about from your heart you're dead to it you're dead to it man I tell you this is this is rich in it and I'll say this that in our life if it is him that has led us and does lead us to this place to where we submit and die then how much more should we make ourselves of no reputation and take upon ourselves the form of a servant not one who is waiting to be served but to serve this is what the body of Jesus Christ is about one time I preached in another place and I preached on a priest on a situation I preached on dealing with some things prodigal son just came out a little bit in the service you know sometimes when you go places I you know you meet people and I have no idea what the background is you know sometimes somebody can tell you a story and and I look at it right away first of all I ain't your pastor don't wanna hear it I ain't your pastor because I know you're gonna give me your side of it your pastor he knows a whole lot more than what I know but sometimes you know you can take people they like like one opinion and the individual came to me and said I tell you this is exactly it was a husband I tell you Bruce a man ain't that the truth man they need to be forgiving they need to I heard what he says it I started looking for the pastor so I lookin for somebody else that I could say hey god bless you ain't seen you in a while I don't want to see that I didn't want to see the person not get help but the thing of it is is that they had taken what was spoken and they missed the thought of it they were looking at the forgiveness of that of the prodigal son and trying to mandate it as though this is what somebody needed to do for them needless to say you know I found out later on I didn't ask but come to find out that home just completely split right apart but you see it's an attitude I bring it to this it's an attitude that we take that's what's important we want to apply the word ha but some how do I know I'm applying in the right way well he's got to be received by Lamm nature you cannot receive the word with a wolf nature you can receive it in America it ought to be when we're coming here right here Lord you speak to me come and show me Lord how to apply this in my life and you watch not only within your marriage as you watch within everything else listen you watch within everything else how God will move on the scene when your heart is right first when your heart is mandating things your heart's not right that's not what he did now listen to me listen to me listen to me he calls us to himself but did we have to repent hello somebody did we have to repent sure we did well my dad was paid but my repentance shows I recognize that I am a sinner I need to be saved and that you have paid the price for me don't you see don't you see what it means not for you to demand debt of somebody else but for you to say I'll pay the price you okay this listen friends this is a mystery come right down into the simplicity of our life to where that the devil himself cannot have an inch God is hidden in the secret of death but he's manifest in resurrection and has the Spirit of God moves upon our heart what does it do he's mellowing us out by just anything wonderful he gave you and me a new heart and they gave us a new spirit because we couldn't even get along with ourselves then he placed his spirit inside of us and causes us to walk according to his ways what you never dreamed possible and as a mystery you see it happening from within and through your life so I say this and coming back to all of these examples of these things this debt is not a demand but I'll say this right here for every marriage that's here every marriage every home every life even there on the job you might say I've got the worst boss in the world but the Bible says in 1st Timothy 2 I would that you were praying for men everywhere Keane's boggles on because why he says it in the claw and then that latter part I believe at verse 3 that you might lead a quiet and peaceable life when you are in prayer with God the result of you hiding away and being in prayer with him is a quiet peaceable life but that requires dying gotta mow the grass gotta fix dinner gotta go here but just remember prayer is not just the position of your body more importantly it's the position of your heart the Prophet himself spoke about the times even when he went hunting and he said many times he said I'll get in the car he says I'll Drive down and find a road turn off this road turn off this road he said and get into a road where nobody's act I'll pull over he said I've been praying the whole time and I'll pull over he said and just keep talking to him prayer is important before the Lord Jesus himself went to Calvary he prayed three times it was not an easy but he prayed what was he doing in prayer he was giving his will over he was dying to his will that God's will might be front and center remember the father looked down and he was satisfied he saw this was not an act this was a death that had already taken place back and gets M&E you see friends this is why prayer the Prophet could tell us he said prayer is one of the most powerful weapons that's ever been put into the hands of mortal men don't uh never underestimate that but you can see why the devil wants to try to take it from you I believe I believe God does reward you when you sacrifice time out of your day or out of your week but I also want you to know God's desire is that you pray without ceasing how do you pray without ceasing when you are on the lawnmower or when you're ironing the clothes you're praying right there you've realized I don't have to be on this mountain I don't have to be in Jerusalem he seeketh worshipers to worship Him in spirit and in truth don't your loving I don't know you let's pray Heavenly Father what God is we give Lord of our lives and our hearts Lord to you Lord right here in this time that we've had here this morning as you speaking to us through your word father you're the one to break the bread you Lord see to it that each of us would Lord be able to receive be able Lord to have what is needed or perhaps here this morning I no doubt Lord throughout this building the gathering maybe those that streaming those that would they realize I've never died but I I want to die to myself I want to die Lord perhaps they realize you're not pressuring maybe they've been lord setting here within the the church for may be coming around maybe around the message for many years the Lord and this time they see it it's you just waiting on them to come to a death the Lord I [Music] stood here this morning as one of your ambassadors to be able to declare that it's by your sacrificial death and offering that you have released what is needed in order to even bring them to that death all that they need to do is surrender to you let the word continue to work in their heart and in their life
