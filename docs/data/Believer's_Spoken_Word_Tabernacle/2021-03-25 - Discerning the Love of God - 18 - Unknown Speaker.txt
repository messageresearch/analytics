midst [Music] just give ourselves to you now in the name of jesus christ god bless you brian i've got just a little bit of a ring here just a little bit let's turn in our bibles if we if we could let's go to first corinthians 13 we're just going to read verse 4 going back into that just verse there and then we'll just let you have your seats you may make god just richard bless each of you amen so good to see you in the house of the lord tonight and sacrifice that's made to be here amen we just just looking to him tonight that you'll just come by our way in first corinthians 13 verse 4 charity suffereth long and is kind charity envious not charity wanted not itself is not puffed up you want to just look at that a little more tonight charity is not puffed up which would mean to act hardly or to display itself in a proud manner may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated as we look here in the word i don't think there's a service that would should go by or would go by that we don't have our hearts open to the word of god that god would come by and he would speak to us there's things that we begin to learn more and more as we walk with the lord that it's it's something that we don't take for granted the things the way that god would speak to our hearts and deal with our lives we just always want to be sensitive that god will come and that always invite him never in a place to where we would feel like as though that we have ever we've attained to everything or we've made it or we don't need help in anything anymore but the contrary the longer that we serve the lord and the closer you draw to the lord we begin to realize more and more our inabilities we realize more that we in ourselves were not self-sufficient that's that's a that would be a great that's a great detriment in our walk but what begins to take place as we recognize more and more our sufficiency is of the lord he's our strength he's the one that guides us he's the one that directs us and you know the very moment that we would feel in any way as though that we have everything at hand and it doesn't matter what part of it is in our life that's the very time that god his presence will draw back from our life because god can never dwell with and work with any time there's anything about our life that would become puffed up as though that this is us that's doing this or my abilities and you know to think of it you might you know might be a person that has a lot of abilities maybe very very smart maybe have great gifts and great talents in your life but yet without those gifts and talents really being surrendered to the lord and looking to god that god would govern those and guide them then they're really there they're really nothing and god will pull himself back because as the scripture said he will not share his glory with another this is why when we begin to look at this last week and seeing this of how that it is something that can come just so subtly in a life and how that we we need the holy spirit to be ever present and we want him to discern our hearts we want him to discern the thoughts and we want to be ever mindful and quick to align with the word when the word is coming forth and we've seen how with last week how that meant many of these times and situations to where that a heart itself comes to a place of being lifted up when at first that heart was was in the right position it was in a place to where it was looking you know to the lord it was in the right uh in position of of of resting in what god had done for it and we looked at different examples in the scripture and begin to trace of where this comes from because we recognize that pride itself there's not one ounce of pride that would come from god when there's a there is there is a rejoicing that comes in our life but that rejoicing comes with an understanding that it's not us that has made ourselves it's not us that has done this in truth be known even of things that maybe that whether you felt to say something to someone or to pray about something the truth of the matter is it's god that's given us the grace in that moment to just submit to what he's impressed upon our hearts and we're thankful for that and may we always stay in that place because then god is able to really move and to use us and we find in the scriptures where paul would admonish us as believers knowing that there are times that thoughts can come our way and thoughts that paul would call it a things happenings that would exalt itself against the knowledge of god sometimes it isn't when these these high things that would exalt himself against the knowledge of god we remember we're not ignorant of satan's devices we know it's not always something that where a thought would come that would necessarily exalt against the word of god in the sense that telling us that well this is wrong or this is right or we need to believe this but sometimes it can be even in the way that we would carry ourselves or a feeling or an attitude but it's to discern that thought and bringing it into the word because we know that the word itself it produces a reality in our life that of a right attitude and a right heart towards the things of god and so paul would speak to us and admonish us to always to to cast down imagination and every high thing that would exalt itself against the knowledge of god and to bring it into subjection to the obedience of christ we look at this you know in in the examples here in the scripture that we looked at last last week and i want to go into another place here in the scripture and in in the book of daniel in daniel chapter four is where i'd like to take up tonight and we like to look here at a man that many of us probably would know as a bible reader or you've heard the name of nebuchadnezzar and to know that that this this king was was raised up as a tool in the hand of god everything that had been given to him god had given to him we recognized that israel you know israel had gone astray they had disobeyed they had gotten away from from the things of god they still had the prophets still had the psalms still had if i can bring it down in our terms they were still packing around the bible but their heart had gone away from god they had gotten away from from his voice and from the leading of his holy spirit and so then when they rejected all that god would send to him then god had no other recourse but that they would be delivered in the hand of one who would actually bring a discipline and a chastening to their life and here was a man that god had raised up he was a tool a servant in the hand of god let me just say this to you when brother branham was was here and remember at the time when many were looking at communism and looking at a lot of those things and many times the preachers they were speaking about that and brother brown told us he said it's not communism that you have to watch out for but he said it is that purple curtain that scarlet curtain that of romanism the roman catholic church he said because he said communism itself and we see this in the scripture it's only a tool in the hand of god to bring judgment when mercy has been rejected and to see that within this here of of this man by the name of nebuchadnezzar you know to think of of this time that you know what he's already witnessed but i'd like to break in on this here a moment in daniel 4 chapter 28 the bible says all this came upon the king nebuchadnezzar at the end of 12 months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of babylon and the king spake and said is not this great babylon that i have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power and for the honor of my majesty while the word was in the king's mouth their fellow voice from heaven saying o king nebuchadnezzar to thee it is spoken the kingdom is departed from thee now i want you to notice that god had visited this king by way of a dream he had already and this would not be the first dream that he had received but it was the second dream that he received and when he received this dream god had made known to him as though and and put it in a symbol that it was a tree that had grown into the height of heaven and its leaves and everything was come to lodge under the branches and how that it was made to be ruler over over all all things here as far as upon the earth but then within that dream remember nebuchadnezzar himself he was not able to interpret that none of the wise men could do it but here came one who was a dedicated channel to god daniel and daniel stood there and daniel under inspiration he began to interpret to the king of what had taken place and he identified that you are that tree you are that one that was cut down to a stump and it begins to identify of of who it was now what we just started reading here this is a year after the dream has come to the king and daniel has interpreted that dream you would look at it for a moment and you would just think just for a minute that my goodness within a trance a period of time of a year you see god gives grace for repentance god will give a space of time when his word goes forth he'll deal with the heart he'll deal with the life he'll let it even be known this is the direction that things are going and the mercy of god it's not god's mercy to cut off something from happening but that's god letting you and i know that hey judgment is coming this is coming and here there there is a way for you to be made right before that judgment comes so when we look at this notice how the scripture it goes on in here this is all taking place even after nebuchadnezzar has heard this he's listen this man he's not ignorant of the power of god you understand he's he's witnessed here this very man has witnessed that god that when all of the astrologers musicians and wise men of the kingdom not one of them could interpret the first stream but god didn't only interpret it god revealed it to daniel what was in the king's heart and none of the rest of the wise men knew it it was the king that was getting ready to slay everybody and daniel stepped forth and he said why is the king so hasty he said let us look to god who reveals the secrets and let us let us beseech the mercies of almighty god and here daniel stands in this time and it's revealed in that moment of exactly what that whole dream is which would it would unfold the whole gentile kingdom and how each of those parts would would play out and even yet in the finality that is taking place in the earth even right now to that even of the iron that comes out there and mixed with the clay to where it would come into that place but notice even right after that he's seen the power of god he's witnessed it to where even when his heart right after that dream was interpreted he became haughty in his heart and he wanted to force all of them to come and worship this image that he erected and if they'll just worship it then they'll be at peace and we can see everything even right now let me make us let me make a quantum leap to now we see that everything itself is heading up to the mark of the beast we see everything but things are coming in to position because let me remind you it is not something that as far as for the natural eye will catch it but it is the holy spirit that has come in this hour to reveal the word to our hearts and call us out of babylon to call us out of confusion as a matter of fact it's an announcement of god's mercy because the stone that smacks the image in the feet that stone is already on the way you see to recognize the the time that we're living in he witnessed how that the three hebrew children he threw them in the fiery furnace and god delivered them he's a witness so he's not absent of knowing the power of god let me bring it down he sat in services he knew the power of god he knew the working of god but yet here in this moment when the word has gone forth to discern his heart and to let him know this is a condition in your life that i see taking place and instead of repenting he doesn't repent of it notice in verse 32 they shall drive thee this is the word that's spoken to him they shall drive thee from men and thy dwelling shall be with the beast of the field and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and seven times shall pass over thee until thou know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will the same hour was the thing fulfilled upon nebuchadnezzar and he was driven from men and did eat grass as an oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hairs were grown like eagle's feathers and his nails like bird's claws he already this was known this this now is a result of what he was already he was already told that there's a condition that is set up inside your heart oh for the mercy of god that god would come by and would actually let him know there's a condition in your heart that's not right you see that's god's mercy to you and i what that is is the love of god you see the love of god was not there to tell him you're all right but the love of god was there to really deal that this condition if you let it go on it's going to be your destruction it was god's mercy you see this puffing up it's that of a blowing like we said last week lack of a balloon that's blowed up it gets filled with a lot of air that's what pride is pride is a lot of air substance that is nothing but when the winds of the holy ghost go to blowing brother the winds of the holy ghost it does not puff us up it brings change it brings comes down in our lives and it discerns our heart that's why it's so necessary we need the holy ghost to come and take the word and discern our thoughts discern our hearts you say i don't want that i want that i want my heart to be discerned i want my life to be deserved i don't want to know where all my good places are at i know that already but i want to know where my weak places are because i need to know that because i'm sure that what i think is not weak but god said that's weak and it needs to be strengthened in that area and it takes it takes god to come and do it but god will not do it without an invitation and recognition that lord i need you i need you lord think of this here here daniel the very last part of that in verse 27 when he had spoke the dream i want you to notice these words this is before it came to pass this was the year before it happened verse 27 he said wherefore o king let my counsel be acceptable unto thee and break off thy sins by righteousness and that iniquities by showing mercy to the poor if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquility see here's god this is god giving mercy let what is being spoken let it be acceptable unto thee you see when we look at this we see what had already taken place that already in his heart before it was anything that could ever be seen on the outside the spirit of god was dealing with the heart you see before things ever come out here it's it happens down here before you can ever disbelieve the truth you must believe a lie is that right before eve could ever fall and disbelief to the truth she had to accept satan's lie it's always what begins on the inside this is why where we need the word as the word is a living reality that comes and it discerns the very thoughts and intents of the heart and we want to be honest with god the bible said whosoever covereth his sins hideth them he's not blessed but whosoever will confess his sins to him is mercy oh my we want to be say god let me be tender let me tell you something this world is not tender at all the spirit of this world think of the compounding haters of god despisers boasters that's scripture that's a sign of the last days when with truce breakers without natural affection they are despisers of them that are good haters of fathers and mothers that's the spirit that's working out there in this time listen to me it's not that of the people there has already been a letdown before when god's word came and god was speaking to people's hearts god was dealing even with the ministry that was standing in the pulpit at that time and telling them you're letting down on the word and you can't let down on the word and expect word results you can't cater to the very nature of fallen nature of a person all you end up doing is producing there of hollow shells in the pew but it takes the holy ghost to go down on the inside and deal with that inner man and bring conviction to let them know they're a sinner and they need to be set free hallelujah that being a church member won't be good enough on that day but it's got to be one that has been washed in the blood of the lamb amen that's been filled with the holy ghost glory be to god and god provided a way let my counsel he said be acceptable unto thee break off thy sins so this this inward part the bible speaks many places of pride but i want to read just a few places here in proverbs 16 18. now you might sit here and you might say oh brother samuel you're preaching to the unbeliever and to make believer no no i'm preaching to the believer because this word ain't going to change an unbeliever but what it'll do it'll take a life that has been looking like an unbeliever or make-believer and it'll bring a transformation to a believer is that right and it'll take a believer and make him more conscious and more aware that always around them is an enemy that's lurking because even after being born again you still dwell in this body and let me tell you something this first birth that is around us this first birth was a birth that was based on not humility but based on becoming something greater so pride itself is always something that we will deal with and battle with and have to bring in subjection every day of our life it can come in many different ways many different forms it can come sometimes in the most subtle of ways i i've referred to your quote the other day or the other last time we preached and how can i overcome when brother brahman started talking about he said sisters he said you're letting your hair grow long and he's dealing with how he says bringing that out in the scripture he said but he said if you're not careful he said how a spirit he said can try to move in there and try to present itself to you oh my you didn't realize how good you looked in long hair now see having long hair is right according to the word of god but brother rahm says when that spirit moves right around then it begins to change in a manner he says to where you get to feeling a little bit lifted up he said we've got to overcome that isn't it something how the devil he'll take something that is absolutely right in line with god's word but he'll come right around in that and blow it up the bible says pride goeth before destruction in proverbs notice goeth before and a holy spirit before a fall better is it to be of a humble spirit with the lowly than to divide the spoil with the proud destruction the heart of man is haughty and before honor is humility you think of this there's there's been i i just just had seen a a little a little clip and they dealt with five they just dealt with five people of what things that they had spoken against god and one of them you're familiar with is that of the the owner of the titanic they asked him how safe is this ship his response was i'll tell you how safe it is god couldn't even sink this ship he mocked god then there's another one i come across and i i don't know i haven't researched all the way into it but there's a time that where it says marilyn monroe she was on a set for a movie and billy graham went to her and billy graham went to her and began to preach salvation and said you need to turn your life around and what she told him is i don't need that jesus over and over many things you know you hear that of the man who was one of the head and leads of the beatles and he rises up in 1966 and he says christianity will be extinguished how can you say that he said i'm certain it will be he said because the followers of jesus are just too simple we are more popular than him a few years later right in front of his house someone shot him in the head six times you can't mock god and expect to go on what a sad thing what was it what was it that came upon those people what was it it's the same one who inspired the king of tyre the same one we read about in isaiah 14 that inspired babylon they come to such a place to where the enemy had taken over to where satan himself was able to express through their life no man in their right mind would ever say such a thing as that before destruction the heart of a man is haughty and before honor is humility and a man's pride shall bring him low but honor shall uphold the humble in spirit what a contrast between pride and humility here daniel speaks to belshazzar the son of nebuchadnezzar now this is this is after nebuchadnezzar's passing but we find we find a condition that's rising with belted shazza where he himself is rising in pride in his heart and notice notice what what daniel speaks he says o thou king the most high god gave nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom and majesty and glory and honor notice who gave him this god gave him this who was it that blessed america god blessed america when they started out there was a seat at the end of the table as i mentioned to you last week many of the things that were laws and things that were originally set out it was all centered around god remember this this the very land that we're sitting in it was it was that fulfillment of prophecy in revelations 12 there's compound meaning in that scripture but it was that where that had fled from the dragon it moved there remember how the light itself kept moving it jumped across the english channel it moved over into england and then here it comes right across there of the atlantic ocean and comes right into that of america this is that place that god had given that the gospel itself could go forth it was not the purpose was not that the land itself would prosper and become such great things i tell you for some of you that's never been out of the country in certain other places there are many countries that have been around hundreds and hundreds of years a whole lot longer than we have but yet when you go into them it would seem like as though they were just come into existence in the last 50 years or so things can be so antiquated now i'm not talking about a lot of people they've got the millstone got smartphones and everything else now but i'm talking about water electricity just some of the basic things that we take for life to see the advancement the scripture would call it being that of the lamb in revelations 13 but yet here as over time where things begin to get away and things begin to recede to where after a period of time they begin to look at how things have been built up and we've gotten this and we've gotten this but it wasn't america that got guarded it was god's blessings why because they stayed true to the word of god there were men of god who stayed true to the word there were people that stayed true to the word do you realize brother branham picks it up there's a dinner that's held every year or when a president is getting ready to be elected i can't remember the man's name right now brother braham said that would have been the first catholic president he said but the pentecostal church they rose up and began to pray and that man who was nearly elected back in 1920 he said it was the prayers of the pentecostal church that caused that to be withstood in that hour but then he says what about now speaking when kennedy was elected see how things were just had just brought down in such a way it's very parallel you see there's a part about it listen to me friends when god would even deal with israel in deuteronomy 8 and he would let him know when you come into the land you'll build goodly houses your your flocks and your cattle everything will prosper and he says when thou art eaten and full then remember to give thanks unto god do not forget him but remember to give thanks unto god but after a period of time see god knowing that within the part of humanity it can be something to have it can so subtly go to where if you look in the first few years no doubt here they were they were faithful as can be and i'm not talking let me tell you something faithfulness it goes a lot deeper than just coming to church that's one part of it right there but let me tell you something it goes into a faithful life that even when you're not here on monday tuesday wednesday friday and saturday your life is still in the presence of god you're not identified as a christian because you come here to church you're identified as a christian because christ himself lives inside of you the devil's not afraid of anybody but just because they come to this church or any other church but what is it that backs the devil up it's the thunder and power of the holy ghost that's in our life that beats out what humility humility but to think where it would come to such a time to where brother adam would identify when they would pass that measure about taking prayer out of schools brother braham said that was an angry outburst from satan and the woman who was behind it all her statements was as long as we've got an army and a navy we don't need old jehovah and i got brother bram said it he said it's give me jehovah or nothing it's got to be god or nothing but you see there's a tendency this is why look look how brother ryan would address it he talks about even when he said a new church would be built or moving into a new building notice the council that's given he didn't say well it's only certain people that are bothered this way it's to let you and i know there is a part about our life that must be reigned over he said usually when people come into a new church or something you know or something's done maybe it's remodeling or maybe it's something else he said there usually ends up being something about them they they get a little lifted up or something but you see it's to recognize that this part right here it's still unconverted it will not come into the real conversion until the change of the body but in the meantime it must be sensitive to that and heed to the counsel of the word that's what that's my desire i don't want to look at it and say god i've got this all under control no sir i take that admonition of the lord to know that i'm still in this old pest house as a matter of fact the best this life can be compared to is a stinking rotten dump is that right but to thank the mercy of god that would speak to our hearts and warn us of these things you see it's it's odd sometimes you know you've seen it i've seen it you watch how that a person all of a sudden they'll fall on hard times maybe they're having a difficulty on their job and or something's coming up my goodness all of a sudden you start hearing all the prayer requests you start hearing all these things taking place and then they'll start coming to church for a period of time how many times had i prayed over people that god would pray bless them with a job so they could come to midweek service because that came out of their mouth they will be held accountable when god has blessed them with an opportunity to come to the house of god but instead when it gets to a place they start feeling comfortable come on friends it's this flesh it's this flesh this flesh is not yet redeemed that's not to get comfortable well you know everything's all right no it should be within that time always remember it is god that has supplied your needs it is god that has given you favor with your boss it's god that's giving you favor with those around you it's god that's blessed you with understanding it's god that's given you wisdom it's god that's given you skills always honor him by putting him first notice the most high gave him these things verse 19 and for the majesty that he gave him all people's nations languages trembled and feared before him whom he would slow or slay whom he would he would he kept alive whom he would have kept alive whom he would he set up whom he would he put down so here he was giving given a dominion but when his heart was lifted up and his mind hardened in pride he was disposed from his kingly throne and they took his glory from him he was driven from the sons of men his heart was made like the beast and his dwelling was with the wild asses and they fed him with grass like oxen can you imagine that he went from eating on king's dishes to roaning around right out here eating grass he didn't know he was eating grass his heart had been changed here he was a king but he was acting like an animal that's what he thought he was pride pride led him to this behavior you want to know why people are acting the way they are you want to know why pride it's come to such a place of pride to where now the ways of behaviors i mean whatever you want to be if you want to be a dog girl boy whatever you want to be today you can be whatever you want to be are you with me pride pride and pride keeps going with sin it keeps going you see this is why even among the churches i remember years ago when brother richard was back there doing the sunday school in the back room and there was a group of young people that was back there then brother richard had me to come in at that time and he had me to you know to give my testimony i turned around and i asked some of them back then i i looked right at him i said now let me ask you which one of you which one of you would go go to a church and somebody walks out the door and the pastor and the deacons and the ministers they're out there smoking cigarettes which one of you and i called out some of you i called out some of their names i said which one of you would do that which one of you would do that where a man's out here running with another man's wife would you would you go along with that could you have confidence in that absolutely not you couldn't have confidence in it whatsoever there's got to be a life that's lived behind it it's a life that beats for almighty god there's god then that's what the holy spirit produces he does not produce just good people there's a lot of good people out there i know a lot of good people but the holy ghost it brings forth new life new birth new creation it transforms lives where it's no longer people trying to live a good life there has come a change on the inside of them but it all started where our pride had to be dealt with our pride had to be dealt with and we had to yield to a place to where our pride would be surrendered to god and say god i give completely over to you this was his he was his body was wet with the dew of heaven till he knew that the most high god ruled in the kingdom of men and that he appointed over it whosoever he will brown makes this brother brown makes a statement he says this king he said he got exalted in his heart i want you to listen this that just runs in the nature of gentiles that runs in the nature of gentiles to to be as he said get puffed up about something but if you've been regenerated if you've been born of the spirit of god there's another nature on the inside you might still deal with this corner on the outside but he who was on the throne no longer there there's a new king on the inside no longer dealing with the strains of that or subservient to that but there is strains of eternal life strains of predestination that flow out through our life oh i thank god for that don't you now to think of this brother adam would deal with this because when the scripture taught tells us that this this king nebuchadnezzar the bible said his heart was lifted up and his mind was hardened this it means that hardening it means to be arrogant to be arrogant now brother branham he says it like this in the message humble thyself he said the main thing at the bottom of that first quote the main thing is love god and humble yourself with it i want you to watch these words love god and humble yourself with it lord you humble me god says you humble yourself with it you see this this deals with relationship with him that we would keep ourselves little keep ourselves small that's a big task right there that's a big task now he said surely after all these years on the field and around the world and seeing different people i ought to know a little bit about the gate to enter in at if you want to get somewhere with god never let an arrogant spirit ever come around you it didn't mean it won't try but he said don't let it come around you it might come it can come in there to the mind present itself but remember cast it down all right cast it down the ways of brother brahma go into he says don't let no malice come in no matter what anybody does if they are wrong don't you never build a complex against that person you be sweet and kind remember god loved you when you were in sin and if the spirit of god is in you you love the other person when he's wrong see just pray for them and love one another this this whole a whole part when we deal with humility i we're talking about an n word we're talking about an inward condition as we read this about pride this is inwardly this is why it takes the spirit of god to really deal with our lives and deal with our hearts let me just say this to you i don't believe that we've got to wait till we get to the house of god for conviction you say why do you believe that because i'm a witness i i'm a witness to where when i'm listening to the message when i'm reading the scriptures even when i'm walking when i'm when i'm just going about just thinking upon things of god listen this is what the promise said in joshua 1 if we would meditate upon the things of god that shall make that way prosperous and of a good success god knows just keeping him before us god is there to guide and direct us and i believe there's conviction that can strike our heart before you even do wrong much less after wrongs been done can convict you and say god i need your mercy lord i need your strength lord forgive me lord maybe a wrong attitude or wrong thought and you catch it before it allows itself to build a stronghold in your life quickly you catch it and say and cast it down and say that's not like jesus you're a ruler you're made to be a ruler over these things you have authority to capture those thoughts and bring them in subjection but the challenge is because a lot of times it will allied align with that first carnal nature you've got a right you could see it'll align with and this is where the battle comes in the greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world this is why the scripture would go on to say in the book in the book of james i don't have time to read it but it deals with in in our lives let me just read it quickly here james 4 6 it says god resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the humble submit yourselves therefore to god and resist the devil and he will flee from you these are not a humble it's not about looking of a certain way how do i hold my mouth or how do i hold my body that ain't humility humility is a condition of the heart it's humbled unto god humbled unto his word humbled when god brings something to your attention say forgive me lord it's submitting unto god this is a promise that works it doesn't say resist the devil first it says submit yourself unto god this word deals with arranging ourselves like military troops underneath their commander then resist the devil and he'll flee as he goes on to say draw night to god he'll draw nine to you in james 4 10 humble humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up notice in the sight of god that quickly that quickly a heart just coming in humility to almighty god i tell you pride is such a it's it's a horrible thing because what happened with this man nebuchadnezzar he couldn't even remember he wasn't ignorant that it was god who do put this these kingdoms in his hand it was even daniel stood there under the interpretation of the first vision and let him know thou art that king who's the head of gold god hath given this to you it is god taketh down king set of kings up change the seasons change his time he he heard this he wasn't ignorant that he hadn't heard it he had heard it but evidently over a period of time it got to a place his heart he came into a condition think about what we looked at last week with uzziah it wasn't just over time but it's when things got comfortable when he felt strong when he felt like he was in control but it was in that time his heart got lifted up i want you let me just move on here and try to bring this down here into into a close here tonight let's look at the end of this man nebuchadnezzar you see when we look at this there's a lot of ways as the lord just kind of takes it to our heart tonight we can see a lot of a lot of places a lot of types and things within this but i want you to remember what was spoke to him and what the vision declared it declared that the tree is going to be cut down but there was a commandment don't touch the stump and the roots because god was already showing within that there would be a humility a humbling of nebuchadnezzar think about it god could have just wiped him out but the mercy of god would bring him down to a place to where he could look up and god used a circumstance a situation to teach him notice at the end of days i nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven and my understanding returned unto me and i blessed the most high and i praised and honored him that liveth forever whose dominion is an everlasting dominion and his kingdom is from generation to generation it sounds a whole lot different than it did at first you know the condition here where his eyes his eyes were lifted up to heaven and all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing and he doth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth and none can stay his hand or say unto him what doest thou at the same time look at this my reason his mind returned to him he no longer thought of himself then his reasoning had returned to him the spirit that had come upon him there had been a demon a spirit bill ben brings it out a spirit that had come upon him because of this pride but now here his reason his understanding the way that he would look at things now it's coming back but in the right way my reason returned unto me and for the glory of my kingdom mine honor and brightness returned unto me aren't you glad there's things that return unto you aren't you glad when we get we get off in on the wrong thoughts about certain things aren't you glad for the grace of god that's able to cut us down and bring us to the place not snuff our lives out but bring us to a place that there's only one way we can look and that's up and we get to look at him the right way then god says okay now this can return unto you this can return unto you why it's with the full realization it comes from him mine honor and brightness returned unto me my counselors my lord sought that my lord sought unto me and i was established in my kingdom and excellent majesty was added unto me now i nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the king of heaven all whose works are truth and his ways judgment and those that walk in pride he is able to abase i want you to watch how brother braham takes this here of what we just looked at it talks about how we see this king he got exalted in his heart god had to make him eat grass like an ox for several years how his hair growed out like eagle feathers his fingernails like claws of a burden till the king recognized in his heart that he was nothing it was the god of heaven who'd set up who'd set up who he wants to and take down when he wants to and many times we may not have our hair to grow out like eagles feathers our fingernails may not grow out like eagle's claws neither may we eat grass like an ox but sometimes god has to put affliction on us to let us know he's still the ruler of our life and we're only here because he permits us to be here and it's his grace that we are here and we must serve him i'm glad for that aren't you i'm glad for the chastening of the lord i'm glad for correction because there's no doubt about it that throughout this building tonight and not that we would we don't pride in that but thank god at times that when god was dealing with our life and maybe through the cares and things of the world or excuses or other matters we just kind of pushed it back and pushed it back but thank god for his mercy because he promised he said i'll not lose one of you you're my sheep you'll always be my sheep brother tells a story you're familiar with of the of the shepherd and here the shepherd was carrying back that little lamb that had a broken leg and they looked and said what's wrong with that lamb was it getting ready to jump off a cliff and it broke its leg and the shepherd said no he said i broke its leg you broke its leg wow you're a cruel shepherd but he said no he said what it is he says it got to relying on its own it wouldn't mind me no more but because i left it i had to break its leg so i could bring it up close to me and let it know that i love it i care for it that i'm the one that heals his body i'm the one that supplies this life i'm telling you friends thank god for his mercy in our life it's true that not every sickness that comes along every calamity every sickness and calamity it doesn't always deal with there being pride in a person's life are you with me but i'm so thankful that god in his mercy that when there's things that god could see then god could say ah i can see maybe getting a little bit too much you or i would not even be aware of it maybe you've been prayed for healed prayed for healed prayed for healed and then here comes a situation you've got to have a surgery oh lord what's going on lord i don't understand what's going on lord why lord jesus you've healed me before lord lord what's going on and god says i just want to love you a little bit you see god knows what you and i you and i would never consider and look in our life there's not one of us that would step right out and say you know what i've been i'm being real prideful lord i'm being prideful i need you to come down tonight and i need you to whoop me good there ain't not there's not one of us but you let the word start passing over your life i'll tell you not only under the preaching but i'll tell you when i've studied there's things that i look and say oh god there's things that'll stand right out maybe things from the past and other things you know i said god what does it become it becomes discipline guidance correction leadership for even presently and into the future to see god's mercy to our life this is god's desire to keep us in that place that we would not get puffed up is this your desire lord jesus let me just stay simple lord before the word let me just lord god i want to be an open book you evaluate my life lord jesus guide and direct me lord speak to my heart lord let the word let it be a discerner of my life if there's something lord god to be repented of lord jesus i want to repent lord i want everything in my life to be lined up with you it's a daily walk with god this is not a life that we can put on autopilot or cruise control there'll be times you'll have to hit the brakes times you're going to have to make a turn you cannot make a turn going a fast pace there's times you've got to slow down you've got to make that turn you've got to look at certain things that are before you this is where we need the grace of god in our life you see paul himself he spoke in concerning his own life he realized that that messenger of satan that was given to him to buffet him why did he say that came to him lest i be exalted here was a man who had seen more than what peter and the rest of the disciples had saw he saw that pillar of fire met him on the road to damascus i want you to think of it in this terms if he being a prophet messenger and having that message that was regarded as a minister one who would bring that light to the gentiles that same gospel that we proclaim here tonight but yet when paul had asked the lord his eyesight would come and go but them said it never was the same after you saw that pillar of fire it would come and go you know how you read in the scripture paul said you see i wrote to you in large letters he would pray and pray and ask god lord take it from me finally after three times the lord told me paul my grace is sufficient for me and paul come to the understanding let me just stop here with this tonight he came to the understanding that this is permitted and given to me lest i should get exalted above the abundance of revelation that was given to me if he needed that how much more do you and i you and i need that and thank god for his mercy oh i thank god for his mercy don't you why because it keeps us in a place that he can speak to us he can use us when we realize we're nothing without you lord i don't mean we're looking down on ourselves like i ain't no count no no you're going the opposite way now but it's where you recognize the lord i need you i'm nothing without you lord i need your strength lord jesus of all the supernatural that paul could see yet his eyesight would come and go he'd pray he'd get a little better then it would come back after a certain season he'd pray go away it would come back and how many how many that paul could have testimonies where they were delivered and healed of things in their life that god would permit this to come and go be grounded as a messenger of satan to buffet him blow after blow after blow why to keep him in a place to where he was resting completely on god lest i should get exalted let's pray lord jesus lord i i thank you tonight lord for your mercy i thank you father for your word lord you would come to us lord and speak to our hearts upon lord these things lord we're not we're not ignorant lord and it's because of you and lord we're just we're aware that we need you lord jesus lord i pray may you help us lord jesus in the ways lord that you would speak to us may we be sensitive lord to hear your voice and to yield to your voice lord may our hearts lord just be inclined to you oh god i pray lord jesus oh god lord keep lord those spirits arrogant spirits know it all lord as brother branham calls it lord those things that would come around oh god keep it from us keep it from us lord father we're we're nothing lord the understanding and lord what you have given to us lord o god this revelation lord it's come from you lord that father with all of our hearts lord our lives we just want to reverence you lord reverence lord the word of god reverence your presence lord i pray lord jesus may you just lord just taking your word just move lord just move lord through our lives your god as it were like an x-ray lord or an mri let it be an imaging lord that there's anything that's not right oh god let it be shown up lord father that our hearts would be inclined to you the lord not to have any place that's set up but rather lord let everything lord if there's something that's not like you lord [Music] god if it's been a feeling an attitude maybe a grudge maybe lord even where we feel right and feel as the other person's wrong oh god we hear this lord we hear the counsel of the word oh god has spoken to our lives to attend to these things lord may we lord i pray may we move with just such a real humility to know that god you're the one who's in control of our life [Music] god i pray that if there's one here tonight that doesn't know you they're not in that awareness that it's you that's watched over their life oh god lord to even to bring them to this moment lord where they would lord come to a place of surrender lord to you they would lay down their pride lord they would lay their life down and say lord i want you lord jesus would you grant that lord tonight i pray just move lord upon their heart lord if there's a life or a heart o god lord here tonight [Music] lord jesus lord doesn't know you in the power of your resurrection may they just open their heart to you lord i pray that god lord jesus for each one of our lives oh lord may it just be lord god open and yield it to you lord lord surrender o god to your leading lord dear god no matter what abilities no matter lord what we would have may it be in your hands lord every part of our life lord may we god be in full full recognition that lord it's you it's you that reveal it it's you that giveth understanding it's you that wisdom comes from lord may we lord god rely upon you maybe there's lord needs and situations that's before us but may we not be as one who would [Music] try to fix or correct or or take control but maybe just lord say lord i want you to have full control of me you're the one lord when nebuchadnezzar could recognize you're the one when his reason came back to him then everything else began to return granted lord i pray i ask god that you just ministered to every need tonight i know there's lies that's not here lord different ones that they're suffering in their bodies lord the need of healing in need of strength would you just minister to them lord i pray just speak to their hearts oh god minister to their lives lord father god i pray lord when we look to you we we ask lord when needs are brought lord may we consecrate lord all our lives to you lord oh god
