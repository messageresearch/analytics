[44:15] and there's a request that he has and
[44:19] Jesus arose and followed him and so did
[44:24] his disciples and behold a woman which
[44:28] was diseased with an issue of blood
[44:30] twelve years came behind him and touched
[44:34] the hem of His garment for she said
[44:37] within herself if I may but touch His
[44:41] garment I shall behold
[44:44] but Jesus turned him about and when he
[44:47] saw her he said daughter be of good
[44:51] comfort thy faith hath made thee whole
[44:56] and the woman was made whole from that
[44:59] hour and when Jesus came into the rulers

[45:06] people making a noise he said unto them
[45:10] give place for the maid is not dead but
[45:14] sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn
[45:18] but when the people were put forth he

[45:50] thankful to be together here once again

[45:58] I've been here and stood here and yet
[46:01] I've been here in in the services with
[46:04] you since last Sunday but I just so
[46:09] appreciate everything that the Lord has
[46:11] been doing and not just in our myths but
[46:15] how God has been moving among his people
[46:17] and it's not just something that we are
[46:22] witnessing here this is what is taking
[46:25] place around the world
[46:29] it's God it's not man it's God the
[46:34] things that we witnessed even when we
[46:37] were at a youth camp and gathered
[46:39] together there of just the presence of
[46:42] God just moving in such a supernatural
[46:45] way in the midst of those services
[46:48] crossed eyes coming straight under the
[46:52] preaching of the word Amen people
[46:56] hearing in their native language what
[46:59] was being spoken devil's being cast out
[47:04] young people being filled with the Holy
[47:06] Ghost and I just say it to you like this
[47:13] I would just be very very very clear
[47:16] with you the word that was ministered
[47:20] there from the very opening night all
[47:22] the way through and closing among of the
[47:26] young people that was there there was
[47:29] nothing at all that was watered-down
[47:32] it was things that was ministered the
[47:34] same things that you would hear has
[47:37] grown adults and you even wonder you
[47:41] look at that and you say well how that
[47:43] it's it's the Holy Spirit that gives
[47:45] understanding then I think God for this
[47:48] past this past weekend here Thursday we
[47:52] had the service here but the cadre
[47:54] brother Randy and the assembly came over
[47:56] and then we went over there was quite a
[48:00] bit of us were able to go over there on
[48:01] Friday night and it was just such a
[48:03] continuity from Thursday and then right
[48:06] into Friday and just so many different
[48:08] needs I even had a testimony that
[48:11] brother Randy even forwarded to me
[48:12] yesterday just an individual just as
[48:15] they were just coming up to to have
[48:17] prayer because we were each standing up
[48:19] there and they were just bringing and we
[48:20] were praying and as they were coming up
[48:23] for prayer he said I didn't make my
[48:25] request known because when I came to
[48:27] that place I just in my heart I believed
[48:30] that same angel of the Lord that stood
[48:32] by the Prophet was standing there so
[48:36] when I came the presence of God was so
[48:38] strong and said what was in my heart had
[48:40] already been
[48:48] the Lord is so good at me I really just
[48:52] appreciate me amen I love him I want to
[48:55] just there's a thought upon my heart
[48:57] here this morning and you see it there
[48:59] this is what I want to just just to
[49:02] speak on here just a few moments and see
[49:04] how the Lord will just take us and break
[49:06] his word to our hearts it's a very just
[49:09] one word it's a very simple word but
[49:11] it's a very it's a very powerful word
[49:14] and it's a very needed needed needed
[49:18] substance or needed thing in order for
[49:21] things that take place and that's
[49:23] atmosphere you realize that even when we
[49:26] you look at it even across the the
[49:29] planets that we we know was the planets
[49:32] nine planets and you know many of many
[49:35] things are spoken of even in the
[49:37] scriptures but there is one planet that
[49:39] is expressly spoken of and in terms with
[49:44] God in relation to redemption and how
[49:46] that God was actually going to bring and
[49:49] to restore and that's this earth and to
[49:52] think about it that within this earth
[49:54] that you and I live on one of the things
[49:56] that makes this earth habitable and to
[50:00] where it's not a habitable but you know
[50:02] remember to behalf of all others is that
[50:04] there is atmosphere around the earth and
[50:07] the atmosphere itself around the earth
[50:10] yet actually not only it allows life to
[50:14] be but even the atmosphere it is there
[50:17] and you know things that could be coming
[50:19] in to try to bring harm even to this
[50:22] earth because of the atmosphere it will
[50:26] not allow it to bring harm to this earth
[50:30] atmosphere is very important aim and
[50:36] atmosphere as we said it allows life and
[50:39] it also though also that atmosphere it
[50:41] prevents things from even reaching this
[50:44] earth many things that would try to come
[50:47] in to the earth when we look at the
[50:49] meteorites and different things like
[50:51] that as they're even coming in remember
[50:53] many of the things the fire and little
[50:55] thing
[50:55] you'll see it's because the atmosphere
[50:57] itself as it's coming through it
[51:00] actually consume it and it'll burn it up
[51:04] God remember the earth as the earth is a
[51:07] type of God bringing that back in
[51:09] redemption soul is that expressive and
[51:13] what God's desire is for our lives that
[51:16] there is an atmosphere about our life
[51:19] that is an atmosphere of life an
[51:23] atmosphere that when things would want
[51:26] to seek to come there is an atmosphere
[51:29] about our life that when thoughts when
[51:32] temptations when things can come it can
[51:35] come but as it comes to enter in through
[51:38] that atmosphere there is power there
[51:40] that actually is able to burn it up the
[51:46] Bible it sets it in the very opening the
[51:49] the very setting of this in Genesis 1:1
[51:51] the Bible says in the beginning God
[51:53] created the heaven and the earth and the
[51:56] earth was without form and void and the
[52:00] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[52:02] and the Spirit of God moved up on the
[52:07] face of the waters you realize waters
[52:11] waters as also very much of a meaningful
[52:13] type throughout the scripture waters
[52:16] itself and will also Express of a
[52:19] thickness and multitudes of people when
[52:22] you really find a situation that is in
[52:25] chaos it's out of order
[52:27] but there's one that can bring order to
[52:30] chaos and that is the Lord himself and
[52:34] God sends forth his spirit to bring
[52:38] order and to bring things in to a
[52:42] condition that what he has already sown
[52:46] there in the earth by his word that
[52:50] those seeds can come forth so this so
[52:54] this this of the Spirit of God it moved
[52:57] upon the face of the waters and I'll say
[52:59] it just like this in this hour that you
[53:03] and I are living in when there is
[53:05] a congealing of waters there was a
[53:07] congealing of waters when the Lord Jesus
[53:10] walked upon this earth and to think of
[53:13] these waters of thickness and a
[53:14] multitude of people where everything
[53:17] itself would would just seem to be
[53:19] overwhelming but yet God in the midst of
[53:22] this hour by his Spirit would bring a
[53:26] people out of people and he would be a
[53:29] people that would actually be brought to
[53:32] him who in the midst of these waters in
[53:36] the midst of this situation of all
[53:39] confusion and all chaos but yet he comes
[53:42] on the scene and he brings order where
[53:46] there once was chaos what sets all of
[53:52] that in motion it's the Spirit of God
[53:54] moving according to the very desire of
[53:58] God itself you realize that even when we
[54:01] look at it in in in a service like this
[54:04] today you might you might be sitting
[54:07] here in need of healing you might be
[54:09] sitting here in need of deliverance you
[54:11] might be sitting here in need of
[54:13] salvation you might be sitting here in
[54:15] need of the Holy Ghost and to realize
[54:17] that before we can ever receive anything
[54:20] from God there must be an atmosphere
[54:24] that is created that is an atmosphere
[54:27] that will align with what the desire is
[54:30] in your heart and to understand before
[54:33] you could ever have that desire there
[54:36] already was a provision for that desire
[54:40] because me now God moving on the scene
[54:44] he works to bring everything in line so
[54:47] that there is an atmosphere now that we
[54:50] would step into then he can fulfill his
[54:53] word you know you cannot you know what
[54:56] brother Branham would say it many times
[54:57] he said we we cannot get into the last
[55:01] days without getting in the spirit of
[55:03] the last days now there's a capital S
[55:06] spirit meaning that of the Holy Spirit
[55:09] what God has promised by his word for
[55:12] the day in the hour that we live in
[55:14] and there's no way that you and I would
[55:16] know the promises that would even
[55:18] pertain or let me just say it like this
[55:20] we would not be alerted to the
[55:23] fulfillment of these promises because
[55:25] let me just say it to you very clearly
[55:27] there are men that have lived out and
[55:29] have been already that lived all the way
[55:32] down through even within the Scriptures
[55:35] even that have lived down through the
[55:37] ages where they themselves have looked
[55:40] at all of these events that would take
[55:42] place at the end time they would write
[55:44] of it they would express these things
[55:47] sometimes when you read the things they
[55:49] express if you read it and you read in
[55:52] the message you would say my goodness
[55:53] this was like a direct quote in this
[55:56] particular book that should not astonish
[55:58] you because the message in this hour
[56:00] that God has sent is not something new
[56:04] as far as outside of the scriptures but
[56:07] it is new to the ideas and to the
[56:10] thoughts of man because man's thoughts
[56:12] is the traditions of man but what God
[56:15] has done in this hour is not presented a
[56:17] new truth he himself the very person of
[56:21] truth has stepped forth in his fullness
[56:23] and gathered the loose ends of truth
[56:27] that has been scattered down through the
[56:30] ages so it takes the Spirit of God to
[56:33] move upon the promises of God and the
[56:36] people of God that pertain to that day
[56:39] and if not the Spirit of God moving you
[56:42] and I would miss it we would read over
[56:44] it now it wouldn't be that we wouldn't a
[56:46] man it but we would look at it and put
[56:48] it as though it's something that's way
[56:50] out in the future
[56:51] instead of realizing in order for
[56:53] promise to be fulfilled we must first
[56:56] enter into the spirit after all the Holy
[57:00] Spirit that is present to fulfill that
[57:02] promise
[57:05] so atmosphere is very important we have
[57:11] to enter into the right atmosphere and
[57:13] to recognize this when we look at it in
[57:16] the scriptures here we find here that
[57:19] you and I when we see the brooding of
[57:22] the Holy Spirit moving upon the earth
[57:24] here in the beginning it began to make
[57:27] love look how brother madam would
[57:29] describe it
[57:29] the Spirit of God here in Genesis 1
[57:31] would begin to brood and he would make
[57:34] love to the earth it was it was brooding
[57:37] over it and cooing over that of the
[57:40] earth to bring about a change of
[57:42] condition it continued to brood and
[57:44] notice as it was brooding everything
[57:47] began to come forth that was already
[57:50] planted until now God moves into a place
[57:53] here in Genesis 1:26 through 28 where
[57:57] God broods forth now one in his own
[58:01] image in his own likeness I want to read
[58:06] this word to you because it's very
[58:08] important that we look here in the word
[58:11] because remember faith itself can only
[58:14] be based on the Word of God you cannot
[58:17] be healed unless you know it's God's
[58:19] will for you to be healed you must say
[58:22] faith only worships in the temple of
[58:26] God's Word verse 26 and God said let us
[58:31] make man in our image after our likeness
[58:34] to see let us see God unfolding himself
[58:38] not multiple people let us make man in
[58:43] our image singular after our likeness
[58:46] singular and let them have dominion over
[58:51] the fish of the sea over the fowl of the
[58:54] air over the cattle over all the earth
[58:56] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[58:58] upon the earth so God created man in his
[59:01] own image in the image of God created he
[59:04] him male and female created he them and
[59:08] God blessed them and said unto them be
[59:11] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[59:14] earth and
[59:15] subdue it and have dominion who notice
[59:18] once again and have dominion over the
[59:21] fish of the sea over the fowl of the air
[59:24] and over every living thing that moveth
[59:26] upon the earth now remember this is not
[59:29] the physical man who would have the five
[59:32] senses this is dealing with that spirit
[59:36] man that one who is made in God's own
[59:39] image and God's own likeness
[59:42] so God here now notice the Dominion the
[59:45] the multiplying and replenishing it was
[59:48] not that which was was was left to
[59:51] better the physical man but remember it
[59:53] is God's desire that it would be the
[59:56] spiritual man that has the Dominion and
[59:58] truly that is really our victory is when
[1:00:02] the inner man himself has the dominion
[1:00:05] over the outer man you realize that the
[1:00:08] Lord Jesus himself coming into a body
[1:00:11] that he created body in the likeness of
[1:00:14] sinful flesh and now here the very god
[1:00:17] that what took place in genesis now is
[1:00:21] made manifest through the life of the
[1:00:23] Lord Jesus what Adam fell from now we
[1:00:26] see it restored in that of the second
[1:00:29] Adam where here you have a man that is
[1:00:32] in perfect harmony and continuity with
[1:00:35] God well here God is dwelling on the
[1:00:37] inside the image of God is veiled in
[1:00:41] that of the form of a servant and we
[1:00:43] find here that that within it this was
[1:00:46] God's desire you see listen it was never
[1:00:49] remember what Jesus said he said the son
[1:00:51] can do nothing is that right he will he
[1:00:59] was separating that it is not by the
[1:01:02] five senses but it is that inside man
[1:01:06] that that image of God on the inside
[1:01:09] that can only be brought forth by God
[1:01:14] Himself her mother and father cannot
[1:01:16] bring forward this inside man they bring
[1:01:19] forth this inside man it has to be the
[1:01:22] second Adam it has to be the Lord Jesus
[1:01:25] Christ through him by the new birth and
[1:01:28] church can't
[1:01:29] come on somebody nah man cannot do this
[1:01:32] Jesus expressly expressly stated this in
[1:01:36] John one that you and I as sons and
[1:01:38] daughters of God are not born in the
[1:01:40] will of man neither a flesh and neither
[1:01:42] that you know a blood but it is that
[1:01:45] which we are born of God and that's why
[1:01:48] we must be born again so when we are
[1:01:52] born again then now that spiritual image
[1:01:55] on the inside the seed was only the
[1:01:59] potential of what was to be made
[1:02:01] manifest in our life something appear
[1:02:07] when when when you have a seed and you
[1:02:10] plant it in the ground you you are
[1:02:12] expecting there to be a crop that will
[1:02:16] come out of that see when you plant one
[1:02:18] seed you do not get one seed you get
[1:02:21] multiple seeds are you listening that's
[1:02:24] exactly the same way that it comes in
[1:02:27] our line you take a promise of God in
[1:02:29] your life and that promise of God comes
[1:02:31] to fruition by the Holy Spirit you do
[1:02:34] not receive one seed but you actually is
[1:02:37] a multiplying of that promise and you
[1:02:40] eat of the promise and you also sew back
[1:02:43] on what has come from God and moved into
[1:02:46] your life
[1:02:47] see this is God's it since God's whole
[1:02:49] economy it's moving within our lives so
[1:02:53] to see God would desire and and has made
[1:02:56] us to be if I can say a mature creatives
[1:03:00] it is not you and I that can create
[1:03:03] things men can only work man can only
[1:03:05] take things from what has already been
[1:03:08] here and make it but God has ordained
[1:03:11] that we would be or immature creators
[1:03:14] now you know brother branham were gone
[1:03:17] and say it like this he says in the last
[1:03:20] part of divine love he says and when
[1:03:22] divine love is in your heart there's a
[1:03:24] difference in your life and everybody
[1:03:27] knows it you live like a Christian you
[1:03:30] act like a Christian you walk like a
[1:03:32] Christian and your whole system is kind
[1:03:35] to God's violent
[1:03:40] your whole system is timed to God's
[1:03:43] Bible
[1:03:44] now let's look here in James chapter 3
[1:03:47] give me some more monitors here James
[1:03:50] chapter 3 and I want to read let's read
[1:03:54] these verses scripture here I want you
[1:03:59] to catch this there is earthly wisdom
[1:04:04] and there is heavenly wisdom what we
[1:04:10] would turn them as sometimes with
[1:04:12] earthly wisdom we can say wisdom we can
[1:04:15] say knowledge but here we're over here
[1:04:18] for heavenly wisdom we can say that of
[1:04:20] heavenly wisdom understanding that has
[1:04:23] come and we can say a revelation because
[1:04:26] faith is a revelation it comes down to
[1:04:29] faith so when we're looking at these two
[1:04:32] parts let me just simply call it wisdom
[1:04:34] versus faith God had already set forth
[1:04:39] in the beginning that his children would
[1:04:42] be under the atmosphere of the word are
[1:04:46] you with me
[1:04:47] he already set forth they would be under
[1:04:49] the atmosphere of the word but yet there
[1:04:52] are things that God did not unfold on
[1:04:55] how that all of this was going to come
[1:04:59] to pass but Satan he comes through a
[1:05:03] tool through that of the serpent and he
[1:05:06] begins to bring in and try to bring in
[1:05:09] another atmosphere if Eve would have
[1:05:13] stayed with the atmosphere of the word
[1:05:16] it would have quench every fiery dart
[1:05:21] every word that he wanted to quote and
[1:05:24] twist around it would have winch every
[1:05:28] temptation all that came around because
[1:05:31] why there was an atmosphere which
[1:05:33] sometimes we know it to be the law of
[1:05:36] the word the protection that she was in
[1:05:38] she was safe in the tabernacle of God
[1:05:43] she was dwelling there but remember she
[1:05:47] was
[1:05:47] made to go out she went out there was an
[1:05:50] atmosphere I want you to catch this she
[1:05:53] received another word and when she
[1:05:57] received that word in the womb of her
[1:06:00] mind it started everything going and it
[1:06:03] began to create another atmosphere about
[1:06:08] her life that was not an atmosphere
[1:06:10] faith but it was an atmosphere of
[1:06:13] unbelief in God's Word and this is where
[1:06:18] you and I stand every day there is
[1:06:22] battle grounds every day there's times
[1:06:27] where we've lost battles because we
[1:06:30] entertained the wrong thoughts but this
[1:06:35] is where now the Spirit of God it comes
[1:06:38] back it makes you know the restitution
[1:06:40] it brings advocacy there's a restoring
[1:06:43] back it's a turning of our heart and
[1:06:45] what's he doing he's also going to make
[1:06:47] us aware of the strength of the
[1:06:50] atmosphere that we are living in and are
[1:06:53] a part of that this atmosphere if you
[1:06:57] will just trust it not what you feel but
[1:07:00] if you'll trust the atmosphere of the
[1:07:02] word it will quench every fiery guard of
[1:07:06] the enemy every meteorite that he tries
[1:07:09] to send your way and try to make an
[1:07:11] impression or an impact on your life if
[1:07:14] we can just stay in that atmosphere then
[1:07:17] we live in victory this is the battle
[1:07:21] the battle is atmospheres so now look at
[1:07:26] this in James 3 verse 13 because both of
[1:07:29] these wisdom and faith there's an
[1:07:32] atmosphere balance there's an atmosphere
[1:07:34] knowledge itself just knowledge has an
[1:07:37] atmosphere now I want you to look at
[1:07:39] this in verse 13 who is a wise man and
[1:07:42] endued with knowledge among you their
[1:07:46] knowledge itself that we read about here
[1:07:48] is talking about Holy Ghost knowledge
[1:07:51] you said why I just got faith I don't
[1:07:53] need knowledge no you need in order to
[1:07:55] have faith you need knowledge but not
[1:07:57] knowledge just here you must listen you
[1:08:00] must your faith can only rest in the
[1:08:03] Word of God you have to have an
[1:08:06] understanding in the Word of God that
[1:08:08] don't mean you have to be smart it's
[1:08:10] just that this in' that's why there has
[1:08:12] to be word that's ministered that is fit
[1:08:16] for the season and the hour that
[1:08:18] pertains to your life and it pertains to
[1:08:21] the broad the desire that God has for
[1:08:25] our lives let me just drop back and
[1:08:27] preach a moment you see God when he sent
[1:08:29] the message to you and I it is the
[1:08:32] message of his second coming and it is
[1:08:35] announcing not because the people of God
[1:08:38] have been looking for the coming of the
[1:08:40] Lord for 2,000 years they have been
[1:08:42] waiting with anticipation
[1:08:44] but brother the message never come just
[1:08:47] so that we're out here looking for the
[1:08:49] second coming of the Lord but it comes
[1:08:51] with ajust as the atonement does it
[1:08:54] comes there to minister to all of the
[1:08:58] needs that we have in this journey it
[1:09:01] came to minister to our soul in
[1:09:03] ministers to our spirit in ministers to
[1:09:06] our flesh it gives direction in our life
[1:09:09] for how that we are to live and conduct
[1:09:12] ourselves while we are living and
[1:09:14] waiting with expectation in the coming
[1:09:17] of the Lord you say you say brother
[1:09:21] Samuel what are you saying well in a
[1:09:22] nutshell this is what I'm saying this is
[1:09:25] just B let me put a little - this is
[1:09:27] just brother Sanders cliff notes ok
[1:09:29] cliff notes for dummies and I'm the
[1:09:31] biggest one right here it just is simply
[1:09:33] this that man shall not live by
[1:09:35] mysteries alone but by every word of God
[1:09:39] that is revealed in this hour
[1:09:43] you understand God has come to make his
[1:09:47] word known and to direct you and I
[1:09:49] because you know what mysteries how we
[1:09:51] thank God for them we believe in that we
[1:09:54] preach that but you also have to be able
[1:09:56] to put your shoe leather on the ground
[1:09:58] and walk
[1:10:00] you also have to be advised on how to
[1:10:04] fact the devil you also have to be
[1:10:07] advised on all of his cunning ways you
[1:10:09] see Paul having the great revelation
[1:10:12] that he had did not dismiss that Paul
[1:10:14] did not say now you've been Revelator
[1:10:16] you've been shuttle the Spirit of God
[1:10:17] you got everything covered you don't
[1:10:19] need anything at all you don't need no
[1:10:20] more teaching you don't need no more
[1:10:21] instruction quite the contrary
[1:10:23] Paul labored by the Spirit of God to
[1:10:26] give direction to the people of God that
[1:10:29] they might remain in the right
[1:10:31] atmosphere of the word I'm glad that God
[1:10:37] is mindful of that aren't you now notice
[1:10:40] this here it creates an atmosphere now
[1:10:42] James
[1:10:42] 3:13 who is the last man and endued with
[1:10:45] knowledge among you let him show out of
[1:10:48] a good conversation his works with
[1:10:51] meekness of wisdom so he's been endowed
[1:10:55] with understanding let him show out of
[1:10:57] his conduct his behavior this endowment
[1:11:00] with a meekness a gentleness of this
[1:11:04] wisdom see this is what this kind of
[1:11:05] wisdom does but if ye have bitter
[1:11:08] envying and strife where at in your
[1:11:14] hearts so this is the key part of even
[1:11:19] where Satan wants to get to and bring
[1:11:22] about a change in an atmosphere so this
[1:11:25] is where the Spirit of God is dealing
[1:11:27] not you you know let me just say it like
[1:11:28] this you know as a sister you know you
[1:11:30] might sit here and say well you know the
[1:11:32] Bible just said if a man being dude
[1:11:34] remember when it's referring to this of
[1:11:35] man right here it's not just referring
[1:11:37] to that of the male gender but it is
[1:11:41] expressly speaking of mankind it is
[1:11:43] dealing with because on the inside of
[1:11:46] you has has a beloved bride of Jesus
[1:11:48] Christ you know who is veiled inside of
[1:11:51] our heart is what Peter calls the hidden
[1:11:53] man of the heart so in its speaking to
[1:11:57] you and I we realize as the bride of
[1:11:59] Jesus Christ we are the moon that is to
[1:12:01] reflect the Sun so who is to be
[1:12:04] reflected in our life is the man Christ
[1:12:06] Jesus our bridegroom is to be the one
[1:12:09] that's reflected in our life when they
[1:12:12] arrested
[1:12:12] Peter and John and James what did they
[1:12:14] say they said they're ignorant unlearned
[1:12:16] outside man by their speaking but they
[1:12:19] took knowledge they had been with Jesus
[1:12:22] the inner man now had come forth and was
[1:12:26] expressing on the outside so notice but
[1:12:28] if you have bitter envying and strife in
[1:12:31] your hearts glory not and line not
[1:12:35] against the truth now when we look at
[1:12:39] this the Bible let me just let me just
[1:12:41] keep moving here the wisdom this wisdom
[1:12:44] this wisdom notice James is bringing a
[1:12:46] distinction this wisdom descendeth not
[1:12:49] from above but is earthly sensual and
[1:12:52] devilish he's crazy he's he's letting
[1:12:57] this be known now notice for we're in
[1:13:01] being and strife is this is what this
[1:13:04] kind of atmosphere produces in being and
[1:13:08] strife that's jealousy and that of a
[1:13:12] practitioner at one that seeks to
[1:13:15] promote oneself one's idea here's the
[1:13:24] result
[1:13:24] various confusion and every evil work so
[1:13:31] you realize Babylon was a physical
[1:13:34] location Babylon became a spiritual
[1:13:38] manifestation Mystery Babylon but you
[1:13:42] realize that what Babylon itself means
[1:13:45] is Babel it means confusion it's Satan's
[1:13:51] design now what was it Babel confusion
[1:13:53] because God confounded their language
[1:13:56] they didn't understand what one another
[1:13:59] were speaking so they went their
[1:14:00] opposite ways but the Holy Spirit now we
[1:14:04] might speak different languages we might
[1:14:06] speak different tongues you might have a
[1:14:08] hard time understanding me in our
[1:14:10] natural dialect and I might have a hard
[1:14:12] time understanding you but in the Holy
[1:14:14] Spirit we have a perfect understanding
[1:14:18] by the revealed word of this
[1:14:22] of who Jesus Christ is so that's where
[1:14:25] our rest is that we might have you know
[1:14:28] this opinion or I might think this or
[1:14:31] you feel this way but that's not what's
[1:14:33] holding us together what it is that's
[1:14:35] holding us together is that of the
[1:14:37] revelation of Jesus Christ there's a
[1:14:40] greater atmosphere in our life that we
[1:14:42] are living under this atmosphere and
[1:14:45] believing and waiting for God to fulfill
[1:14:49] every promise Oh glory but the wisdom
[1:14:57] now here of James brings a difference
[1:14:59] but the wisdom that is from above is
[1:15:03] first pure then peaceable gentle easy to
[1:15:10] be intreated full of mercy good fruits
[1:15:13] without partiality and without hypocrisy
[1:15:17] if we can receive this what James is
[1:15:21] saying you can be bombarded with
[1:15:24] atmospheres but this is how you discern
[1:15:29] where is this wisdom coming from
[1:15:34] now I know and we're not just talking
[1:15:36] about things of the world but remember
[1:15:38] what James is dealing with here that
[1:15:40] there is envy and strife among the
[1:15:43] people and it's not allowing the Word of
[1:15:46] God to have free course and he's letting
[1:15:49] him know hey it ain't out here in ain't
[1:15:51] your brother it ain't your sister you've
[1:15:53] got to get the remedy down on your heart
[1:15:55] sometimes your heart gets out of sync
[1:15:58] and you've got to plug it up to God's
[1:16:00] great computer and say sink me Lord I'm
[1:16:03] all out of sorts I need an update I need
[1:16:06] a retelling of the Holy Ghost in my life
[1:16:09] Lord matter of fact I pray to God we
[1:16:11] just don't wait til we feel so low until
[1:16:14] we realize we've been entertaining the
[1:16:15] wrong things I pray to God that we
[1:16:18] realize each and every day I need to be
[1:16:21] plugged into the main source I need to
[1:16:24] be checking for updates frequently
[1:16:26] because with those updates it comes
[1:16:29] security fixes because in God there is
[1:16:32] no breaching of God's atmosphere it's
[1:16:35] only when we are not up-to-date and
[1:16:38] living in the atmosphere of God like we
[1:16:41] ought to live so he's bringing this
[1:16:44] discernment they were trying wisdom as
[1:16:47] it's coming in this is the atmosphere
[1:16:48] that it brings Lawrence said both of
[1:16:51] these wisdom and faith create an
[1:16:53] atmosphere he said you go into a church
[1:16:55] he said the pastor snail the pastor done
[1:16:58] I don't believe they don't mean that the
[1:16:59] pastor he don't get out from behind the
[1:17:01] pulpit that's not what he's talking
[1:17:02] about he's talking about stale in that
[1:17:04] it has no life he does not believe in
[1:17:07] the promises of God he does not believe
[1:17:10] that God still heals God still moves
[1:17:11] does not believe in the real baptism of
[1:17:14] the Holy Ghost but he says it'll create
[1:17:16] an atmosphere in that church he said but
[1:17:19] then you go to another assembly and he
[1:17:22] said when you go in there if faith
[1:17:23] itself has been preached that word will
[1:17:26] create an atmosphere you you understand
[1:17:28] the word creates the atmosphere Amen I
[1:17:34] just don't want earthly wisdom you might
[1:17:36] say earthly wisdom you mean you could
[1:17:39] sit in a church let me bring it down
[1:17:40] hold a message church and
[1:17:42] simply wisdom we don't want just wisdom
[1:17:48] like that we desire divine revelation
[1:17:52] and if God has made a promise in his
[1:17:56] word and we can take that promise and
[1:17:58] say Lord I know you're speaking to me I
[1:18:01] know that this is for my life right now
[1:18:03] Lord God let it become real inside of me
[1:18:07] because this knowledge that we're
[1:18:09] talking about it's not like what the
[1:18:11] Greeks say that just because they know
[1:18:14] it up here they know it but we're
[1:18:15] talking about knowledge according to how
[1:18:18] the Jews look at knowledge and the Jews
[1:18:20] do not believe you can say you know
[1:18:22] something until it has absolutely been
[1:18:25] an experience in your life I believe
[1:18:28] that's one of the areas that we fall
[1:18:30] short on so much we look at the word we
[1:18:32] understand oh my I understand this I see
[1:18:35] this but it ought to be that the things
[1:18:37] that God is opening on that knowledge of
[1:18:40] the Holy Ghost it ought to make you and
[1:18:42] I aware of what belongs to us and what
[1:18:46] we in our lives must say Lord let this
[1:18:48] be an experience in my life too many
[1:18:54] times we live below our privileges but
[1:18:59] notice here's the effect of this wisdom
[1:19:01] coming out and the fruit of
[1:19:03] righteousness is sown in peace of them
[1:19:07] that make peace so here there is a
[1:19:10] sowing when this takes place there for
[1:19:12] sowing either way but we want to be that
[1:19:15] of sowing fruits of righteousness
[1:19:16] because within that seed the seed itself
[1:19:20] it has within it the power to transform
[1:19:23] itself or become what so ever is in that
[1:19:26] seed now remember with this wisdom it
[1:19:29] brings peace
[1:19:31] it brings peace it brings sadness even
[1:19:36] in chaos yes because this guy and even
[1:19:39] in the spirit realm can be experiencing
[1:19:42] chaos he can be in being bombarded and
[1:19:45] you let it in there and they call some
[1:19:47] fear can rise and all sorts of things
[1:19:49] but the inside man himself when it's
[1:19:52] been born of the Spirit of God that on
[1:19:54] the inside it knows no fear it knows no
[1:19:58] defeat whatsoever and we can get that
[1:20:01] inside man just allow him to have
[1:20:03] control on the outside he will run
[1:20:06] things out then our flesh would want to
[1:20:09] try to present to us through and by how
[1:20:11] the enemy would anoint us with an
[1:20:13] atmosphere and try to make us calls or
[1:20:15] look at things as though it's more real
[1:20:17] oh this this very thing right here but
[1:20:20] if we can come back to that and say Lord
[1:20:22] but your word is true and they can say
[1:20:24] well look at all this and look at all
[1:20:26] that you can stand like Juna and there
[1:20:28] can be an atmosphere about your life and
[1:20:30] you say this is a nothing but lying
[1:20:33] venez amen this is why you know brother
[1:20:39] man would tell us he said as long as
[1:20:41] says there's a argument an argumentative
[1:20:43] atmosphere there's nothing God can do
[1:20:47] what can do that whether it's a church
[1:20:49] whether it's a home with us on your job
[1:20:50] wherever it's at now remember let's
[1:20:53] apply the word applying the word is it
[1:20:56] hopeless Cup I'm going to pray for it no
[1:20:59] no remember where this is at heart first
[1:21:03] don't you have to understand the Holy
[1:21:06] Spirit brings discernment to discern our
[1:21:09] hearts first you might be wanting to see
[1:21:13] the physical joining you might be
[1:21:15] wanting to have the nice words and
[1:21:17] conversations and enjoying fellowship
[1:21:19] and everything else but unless it is
[1:21:21] down in the heart first this out here
[1:21:24] it'll just stay that way it'll go right
[1:21:26] back to it it's got to be the heart
[1:21:29] itself first that's a line to the Word
[1:21:32] of God on a daughter to restore to you
[1:21:35] any piece that them over this they're
[1:21:39] very ugly acting and causing trouble
[1:21:41] you'll never be able to have a revival
[1:21:43] as long as that kind of an atmosphere is
[1:21:45] around the sometimes it's not only
[1:21:48] things that you see out here in the
[1:21:49] circus set it is then let's be
[1:21:52] scriptural about it we need to go to the
[1:21:54] person and say you know what I've got a
[1:21:55] problem and not saying you're the
[1:21:59] problem but just identify I've got a
[1:22:02] problem you see many times we go to
[1:22:05] identify things but we come with our
[1:22:07] craftsman riches and everything is we've
[1:22:10] already got a diagnose know they need a
[1:22:11] 9/16 and they need now they're gonna
[1:22:13] need a Phillips on this one right here
[1:22:14] they need an adjustment on their
[1:22:16] attitude right here oh yeah I'm gonna
[1:22:17] need that Dewalt I'm gonna need to find
[1:22:19] bits
[1:22:19] I might need a compact driver to get
[1:22:20] this into them hello somebody
[1:22:24] you see we're always diagnosing but
[1:22:27] realize realize before that can ever be
[1:22:30] right down here right down here you see
[1:22:34] you're trying to change it on your own
[1:22:37] you can't change it on your own I can't
[1:22:41] make this a healing service on my own as
[1:22:43] much as I want to see deliverance people
[1:22:46] feel what the Holy Ghost people
[1:22:47] delivered safe every time I minister but
[1:22:50] I cannot make that happen that's up to
[1:22:54] him and up to us together so here you
[1:23:01] see God in His mercy now look at this in
[1:23:04] Colossians chapter 3 let's read this
[1:23:06] here
[1:23:07] verse 12 put on therefore as the elect
[1:23:10] of God holy and beloved boughs of Mercy
[1:23:15] kindness humbleness of mind
[1:23:18] meekness long-suffering you tell me that
[1:23:23] your flesh has this and you know I'm
[1:23:25] going to tell you you're alive now I
[1:23:31] know some of us have a little bit more
[1:23:32] of a maybe a leeway than other people
[1:23:34] have
[1:23:36] hello some of us seem to be maybe a
[1:23:39] little bit morning we're a little bit
[1:23:41] quicker than others
[1:23:42] don't go classifying people based on
[1:23:45] that this is not the classification are
[1:23:50] you understanding me now he said put on
[1:23:53] as the elect of God this word put all
[1:23:58] means to sink into it lets us know
[1:24:03] there's an atmosphere to tap into a
[1:24:06] boasts and I'm born again as the son of
[1:24:09] the son and daughter of God this is the
[1:24:10] access friends you know one thing that
[1:24:13] has become more real to me here over the
[1:24:15] past weeks and months let me just tell
[1:24:19] you great big secret I need a refilling
[1:24:22] of the Holy Ghost every day I have
[1:24:27] realized I have realized the effects of
[1:24:31] being filled and refilled and refilled
[1:24:34] and filled and refilled how what kind of
[1:24:37] effects I've noticed how I look at
[1:24:40] problems I don't look at in the same way
[1:24:43] it don't mean that I put up my eyes and
[1:24:46] say old problems don't exist
[1:24:47] we've got a perfect Church bearing no
[1:24:49] spirits in my church that's a lot there
[1:24:51] is always going to be spirits and things
[1:24:54] that have to be dealt with but it's how
[1:24:58] we're looking at it
[1:25:01] Amen it's how we're looking at
[1:25:03] situations what affects this the
[1:25:06] atmosphere this is where the pudding on
[1:25:11] it isn't just oh yeah I need to be
[1:25:12] forgiven oh let me see oh yeah here's
[1:25:16] yeah there we go f o RG forgiven I need
[1:25:22] to go forgive brother take rest you know
[1:25:23] any I need to go and ain't like that in
[1:25:29] sinking into something it means you got
[1:25:33] to get out of something and get into
[1:25:34] something it ain't gonna be just picking
[1:25:39] up a jacket where I'm gonna pick up
[1:25:41] meekness right now know all these work
[1:25:42] together if Jesus Christ is Savior
[1:25:47] deliver Redeemer everything all together
[1:25:49] then this access brother it has what we
[1:25:52] have need of atmosphere atmosphere
[1:25:59] somebody say atmosphere verse 13 for
[1:26:04] bearing one another
[1:26:06] Oh Lord forgiving one another If any man
[1:26:11] have a quarrel against any even as
[1:26:16] Christ forgave unison told my church
[1:26:18] discipline these scriptures are not
[1:26:21] talking about church discipline this is
[1:26:23] talking about living as sons and
[1:26:25] daughters of God with one another church
[1:26:28] discipline has its own scriptures of how
[1:26:31] forgiveness is extended and restored are
[1:26:36] you with me let's be let's be scripture
[1:26:38] on this and let's stand in the Word of
[1:26:40] God and let's not let confusion try to
[1:26:42] take our minds you see because there's
[1:26:47] gonna be things in ought to me there's
[1:26:48] things that will come up and we ought to
[1:26:50] be able to forgive be able to look past
[1:26:53] what someone has done well I don't agree
[1:26:56] with them well so what do you know their
[1:26:59] heart do you know their heart if any man
[1:27:04] has a quarrel against any I don't I
[1:27:09] don't see Facebook I don't see posted on
[1:27:11] Facebook you know meant all these things
[1:27:14] on Twitter but just don't mention their
[1:27:15] name of course because you're calling
[1:27:16] names that don't say that in my version
[1:27:19] does that say that in yours no because
[1:27:23] that's not of God
[1:27:24] you see that's an atmosphere and you're
[1:27:26] creating an atmosphere and let me just
[1:27:28] say like
[1:27:29] for those of you that will read that
[1:27:31] junk there's an atmosphere that comes
[1:27:33] into your home and then when you side
[1:27:37] with people who side against or you are
[1:27:40] taking in an atmosphere against the word
[1:27:45] you need to stand with the word well I
[1:27:49] don't see this I don't understand this
[1:27:51] Eve didn't see it Eve didn't understand
[1:27:54] it but if she would have stood under the
[1:27:56] word she would have been under the
[1:27:58] atmosphere of the word and that is
[1:28:01] protection if she could have just simply
[1:28:04] told the devil listen the serpent was
[1:28:08] somebody she went to church with y'all
[1:28:11] gonna be able to take this the circle
[1:28:13] was not what are you I never seen you
[1:28:16] before
[1:28:16] who are you no no this was someone she
[1:28:22] had contact with but you see what
[1:28:25] happened here Satan used that he used
[1:28:28] that Satan didn't even care about the
[1:28:31] serpent I hope you hearing me he did not
[1:28:35] care that creation that God had created
[1:28:38] as an upright beast it was only a fool
[1:28:41] that he could use Satan doesn't care if
[1:28:44] he can use your Facebook your Twitter
[1:28:46] your mouth my mouth he don't care he'll
[1:28:49] use it as a to what to create an
[1:28:52] atmosphere menaces will got the
[1:28:57] atmosphere accomplished that I wanted to
[1:28:58] accomplish
[1:29:00] now there's confusion hahaha this is my
[1:29:03] kind of dwelling at a mine at a man I
[1:29:07] don't like confusion oh but notice here
[1:29:13] and above all these things put on
[1:29:19] charity oh my now wait a minute we put
[1:29:22] on all of this right here
[1:29:24] but now above all these things put on
[1:29:28] charity help me understand isn't the
[1:29:32] Holy Ghost the love of God sure God is
[1:29:35] love right the love of God in our life
[1:29:39] but how to have this over the love of
[1:29:42] God in my soul then why is he telling me
[1:29:45] above everything else put on charity
[1:29:48] because it's got to begin on the inside
[1:29:52] in our life before it ever becomes
[1:29:56] manifested as an outward expression it's
[1:30:02] got to be here on the inside before it
[1:30:05] can ever be manifested on the outside
[1:30:08] that's why the dying if there's things
[1:30:10] that you can look at that you're praying
[1:30:12] about in your life relationships hear me
[1:30:14] now that you're praying about listen
[1:30:16] friends don't go trying to repair
[1:30:18] relationships on your own let your heart
[1:30:23] be repaired to God because they listen
[1:30:27] no matter who you are who you are I
[1:30:29] don't care if you're the most spiritual
[1:30:31] person that you think you are when you
[1:30:33] are wronged and somebody says something
[1:30:36] against you I don't care if it's a boss
[1:30:38] I don't care if it's in your house I
[1:30:40] don't care if it's on the job if it's in
[1:30:42] church it doesn't matter your flesh is
[1:30:44] going to stay you know why because
[1:30:48] you're fresh ain't born again your
[1:30:52] spirit ain't born again but it's the
[1:30:55] inside man who is born again when God
[1:31:00] filled you with the Holy Ghost he could
[1:31:02] have gave you your theophany for your
[1:31:04] human spirit he could have changed this
[1:31:06] flesh to a glorified body but he says no
[1:31:09] I'm start with the inside
[1:31:11] I'll get the inside man right and he'll
[1:31:13] take dominion over this little piece of
[1:31:16] earth and I will manifest redemption
[1:31:19] through him by the power of bringing
[1:31:21] this in subjection and obedience to the
[1:31:24] Word of God because the word is the man
[1:31:27] Christ Jesus above all these things put
[1:31:34] on charity though I can tell you what
[1:31:38] it's just putting the devil on the run
[1:31:40] you know because the devil likes to try
[1:31:42] to put these things over on you well if
[1:31:43] you were this and you were this you
[1:31:45] would have this and you would have this
[1:31:47] they know what is
[1:31:48] I'm there I have access to this charity
[1:31:54] but in having access to it I've got to
[1:31:58] put it on and that don't mean put on
[1:32:00] that means put on that means sink in to
[1:32:05] sink in to sink in to so it means you
[1:32:09] got to get in to something atmospheres
[1:32:15] that are battling that are trying to
[1:32:16] pull you here and there but you got to
[1:32:18] sink into that atmosphere how do I get
[1:32:21] into that atmosphere lord I need to
[1:32:23] lover this hole so lord I need to let my
[1:32:25] wife Laura lein in Omaha Lord I need a
[1:32:27] love on it
[1:32:28] and I know you're trying to do that on
[1:32:31] your own but you need to say Lord let my
[1:32:35] heart Lord be right in this situation I
[1:32:38] know what your word says I'm the son of
[1:32:40] God I'm a daughter of God Lord I'm
[1:32:43] asking you to help me oh then you're
[1:32:47] inviting the atmosphere the Spirit of
[1:32:50] God can begin to descend and which is
[1:32:59] the bond of perfectness and let the
[1:33:03] peace of God be the umpire that's what
[1:33:08] this word rule means let it be the
[1:33:10] umpire in your heart well here we go
[1:33:14] this hidden man here he is I'll tell
[1:33:19] your Lord that right there that they
[1:33:21] sent that was an inside corner he had
[1:33:24] caught the right-hand corner of that
[1:33:26] strike zone Lord I didn't you know it
[1:33:29] was a strike I know it was a strike
[1:33:32] thoughts it was a ball not just you know
[1:33:37] that they meant that with me in mind God
[1:33:41] said let it pass
[1:33:42] I know they were striking at me I know
[1:33:47] they were this I know where were that
[1:33:49] but the catcher the pitcher the batter
[1:33:52] you don't have to say and if you want to
[1:33:56] try to interact with the umpire he can
[1:33:59] throw you out out of here
[1:34:03] I ain't kicking you out of the body you
[1:34:08] understand what happens the Gov just
[1:34:10] flutters away the dev just flutters away
[1:34:14] because you're not willing to listen to
[1:34:17] the umpire which the umpire is the
[1:34:21] absolute it's the peace of God it is the
[1:34:26] revelation of Jesus Christ in our hearts
[1:34:31] and there's been times that we've argued
[1:34:35] with the umpire all of us let me just
[1:34:38] make sure nobody hiding up here from the
[1:34:40] back wall all the way out there and if
[1:34:42] somebody's hiding and they're sitting at
[1:34:44] their computer at home it's you too and
[1:34:50] we've had noted the Bible says grieve
[1:34:53] not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you
[1:34:57] are sealed to the day of your Redemption

[1:35:39] father your word is right I was wrong in
[1:35:44] my ideas if it's not Lord God your
[1:35:47] thought it's wrong I don't care how real
[1:35:49] it seems it's wrong
[1:35:52] oh that's when we're standing his sons
[1:35:55] and daughters of God identifying wisdom
[1:35:59] identifying atmospheres let me just try
[1:36:03] to wrap this up here and find a place
[1:36:07] after which you are also called in one
[1:36:10] body and be you thankful let the word of
[1:36:14] Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom
[1:36:25] which has been spoken you remember Jesus
[1:36:28] said in John 15 we want to bear fruit of
[1:36:31] him right
[1:36:31] he said if ye abide in me and my words
[1:36:37] abide in you then ask what you will and
[1:36:44] it shall be done Lord I'd like to have a
[1:36:50] boat with twin cams I'd love to have
[1:36:53] Lord God a package of them expandable
[1:36:56] broads no no no your your your honor

[1:37:01] friends I'm not saying that we don't
[1:37:02] have needs in our life you understand
[1:37:04] what I'm saying what I'm saying is is
[1:37:06] that notice when God deposits is a word
[1:37:09] here we are dwelling in him are our
[1:37:12] desires it is about him we want to see
[1:37:18] more of him we want to see more of his
[1:37:22] life in us sometimes we we allow the
[1:37:24] devil to steal so many things from his
[1:37:27] Lord I want to see more of you I want to
[1:37:28] see more of your mana I want to see more
[1:37:30] of you my life and and you don't we

[1:37:33] ministered pray over and really pray
[1:37:36] over them and really give ourselves you
[1:37:38] know to the Word of God I'm not just
[1:37:39] talking about sitting down and formally
[1:37:41] reading it I'm not just talking about
[1:37:43] just setting
[1:37:44] you know just listening to a message and
[1:37:45] and I'm not just talking about just
[1:37:47] feeling about just just praying just
[1:37:48] little prayers but I mean enter in what
[1:37:51] God is expressing to you and I it's an
[1:37:53] atmosphere of that word I'll tell you
[1:37:56] brother and sister when I leave here in
[1:37:58] these services that atmosphere does not
[1:38:01] leave right here when I'm at this pulpit
[1:38:03] as a matter of fact the atmosphere many
[1:38:05] times then as right here when I'm
[1:38:07] ministering is the same atmosphere that
[1:38:10] is there when God delivers the thought
[1:38:12] on my heart let me just tell you right
[1:38:15] now before this right here would drop in
[1:38:18] every earlier in the week just that
[1:38:20] thought was permeating in my heart on
[1:38:22] atmosphere I said Lord what do you want
[1:38:24] me to speak on here I've got one service
[1:38:26] before brother oil comes in what is it
[1:38:28] then Lord that you would have me to
[1:38:29] speak on because there's other things
[1:38:31] that are just waiting in the docket to
[1:38:33] be exposing but you know what it is it's
[1:38:36] God what do we have need of with in this
[1:38:39] moment in this time in our life what's
[1:38:44] waiting my wait for years I don't know
[1:38:46] that's in his hands let the word of
[1:38:53] Christ dwell in you richly you know if
[1:39:00] this means to dwell it means let it be
[1:39:02] the influence let it be the influence
[1:39:07] you know let it be the atmosphere in our
[1:39:12] life give ourselves to it don't just
[1:39:17] don't just take you and listen to you
[1:39:19] know don't just take in victory here
[1:39:21] this morning and then when you go out of
[1:39:23] here where all my victory may be caught
[1:39:26] there and he's meeting your needs even
[1:39:27] right now and maybe there's things that
[1:39:29] will pray over I don't know God knows
[1:39:30] but this said when you leave out of here
[1:39:33] don't just leave out of here and say oh
[1:39:34] my what victory you're gonna have to
[1:39:37] maintain that victory that victory is
[1:39:40] going to be tested but remember the same
[1:39:43] God that brought it to you is the same
[1:39:45] God that goes with you to see that it's
[1:39:50] kept what do I do if I prayed for here
[1:39:53] today I've got sickness and my body what
[1:39:56] I do live in the atmosphere of the word
[1:39:59] look at the promises of God concerning
[1:40:03] healing it is God's will for you to be
[1:40:06] healed if I was sick in my body I would
[1:40:09] read the promises of God that pertain to
[1:40:12] healing well listen I don't know where
[1:40:15] all of them are located hey you can
[1:40:17] start with Isaiah 53 you can start with
[1:40:22] Isaiah 53 you can start right there
[1:40:25] you can pray over that that will give
[1:40:27] you enough for weeks then you begin you
[1:40:29] begin from there and you watch how the
[1:40:31] Holy Spirit won't even build from there
[1:40:33] through the Book of Psalms my Lord David
[1:40:36] through the Psalms David is being healed
[1:40:38] in his physical body David is being
[1:40:40] healed in his mind David is being healed
[1:40:43] in his spirit even at times when David
[1:40:47] so he would be so troubled he would say
[1:40:50] so take courage in the Lord filled with
[1:40:56] promises of healing healing it's the
[1:41:00] children's bread and it belongs to you
[1:41:03] my brother my sister let it dwell in us
[1:41:07] Rick should live under that hat mysteri
[1:41:10] of the word let's finish this here stop
[1:41:17] teaching and admonishing one another in
[1:41:23] Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs how
[1:41:32] can this how can this be
[1:41:36] because it's got to be a song in here
[1:41:42] you know God gives you songs to sing God
[1:41:48] will give you a song to sing
[1:41:50] that'll pertain to the experience and
[1:41:53] the season you're in now it may not be
[1:41:56] altogether a new song
[1:42:00] but it's a new song on a hue far away
[1:42:07] let's say me that's an old song oh but
[1:42:11] when you have an experience in your life
[1:42:12] that you need to go to Calvary it's a
[1:42:15] new song see you're not singing it under
[1:42:18] old traditions and old forms I know then
[1:42:21] that stanza I know them that's line oh
[1:42:24] it's experience it's not routine this is
[1:42:29] my life this is my need right now
[1:42:37] amen any tries to make me down I mean I
[1:42:48] do but my sins are gone you don't matter
[1:42:51] if you know all the words you're singing
[1:42:53] there's a message in that song where is
[1:42:58] it a pleasant atmosphere going on and
[1:43:04] what is it singing precedes the world B
[1:43:11] port battle before battle they don't
[1:43:13] just walk out brother Dave and say I'll
[1:43:15] tell you what the Sifl or here that's it
[1:43:18] the Lord here does say the Lord it now
[1:43:20] singing singing goes before the world so
[1:43:27] you can see this is victory in our life
[1:43:30] it's creating an atmosphere an
[1:43:35] atmosphere of woosh that's what singing
[1:43:40] is about singing is not about I can hit
[1:43:43] the right note you can hit the right
[1:43:45] note no singing is about we think of all
[1:43:48] that but singing is about us
[1:43:50] worshiping under the revelation of who
[1:43:54] he is to me begin to enter into that
[1:44:03] in our hearts
[1:44:09] my brother Brad I'm walking down through
[1:44:11] Memphis let me just remind you just the
[1:44:15] case he's a white man in Memphis
[1:44:24] I hope I didn't offend nobody cuz y'all
[1:44:26] know me real well but here he is
[1:44:29] you see I've heard stories about Memphis
[1:44:32] and in these stories for white people I
[1:44:35] heard stories from from black people who
[1:44:38] said I wouldn't go down in Memphis now I
[1:44:42] don't know no doubt there's good
[1:44:44] brothers and sisters down in Memphis to
[1:44:45] st. listen friends
[1:44:47] there's rotten things all around there's
[1:44:48] rotten white people there's rotten
[1:44:50] Puerto Ricans
[1:44:51] there's rotten Mexicans there's
[1:44:53] rottenness there's rotten all around but
[1:44:57] God's children
[1:44:58] oh brother and sister and their son they
[1:45:03] don't even know they're God's children
[1:45:06] but you see what happened in a time when
[1:45:10] it was so separate separated segregated
[1:45:13] tensions were so hot Oh God
[1:45:16] are you gonna hear me now tensions were
[1:45:19] high if he would have been thinking in
[1:45:22] his mind he would not have went down
[1:45:25] there one day brother Ram had something
[1:45:26] against against the black people but
[1:45:29] sure as I hold my tensions are high how
[1:45:31] better not be going there how better not
[1:45:32] be doing this but you see he was being
[1:45:35] led by the Spirit of God there was
[1:45:38] another atmosphere as he went down the
[1:45:41] street he was singing one of them one of
[1:45:45] them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[1:45:48] of them you know that song pertains to
[1:45:50] it is sons and daughters of God that
[1:45:53] have been born of that same Pentecostal
[1:45:56] experience that they had in the upper
[1:45:58] room he was singing about the authority
[1:46:01] that he had as a son and daughter of God
[1:46:05] he created an atmosphere and when he got
[1:46:11] there that blessed sister was standing
[1:46:13] there she was right on the gate she was
[1:46:19] already in an atmosphere
[1:46:22] this is the Bible brother she was that I
[1:46:26] am that shooter my man hello
[1:46:32] I am her I'm just asking West God's
[1:46:35] Elijah cuz if I'm that Sunna mine
[1:46:40] there's a little I just sent to me
[1:46:44] whether she was in that atmosphere her
[1:46:47] son had a need in his party it was a
[1:46:50] need in their home and she knew that the
[1:46:53] relationship was not right between him
[1:46:56] and the Lord so you know what she did
[1:46:59] she entered into an atmosphere of prayer
[1:47:03] prayer brought an inspiration that I am
[1:47:08] that you know my woman and she saw a
[1:47:12] vision that Elijah was going to come you
[1:47:20] know what that atmosphere did it had him
[1:47:23] leaning on the fence
[1:47:28] good morning parson how'd you know I was
[1:47:34] a person I saw you coming before God
[1:47:41] already showed me now contrary to our
[1:47:45] thinking to her the atmosphere she was
[1:47:49] in he was finished she once said in his
[1:47:56] hand
[1:47:56] you know God said something his word and
[1:47:59] I read this story you know about
[1:48:00] shippment woman that Norfolk could I
[1:48:03] just didn't you know I and I read this
[1:48:05] other stroke no no I don't know if she I
[1:48:09] don't know if it had been preached
[1:48:10] within weeks I don't know why it was but
[1:48:14] I know I think she was connected with
[1:48:17] that promise and she said this promise
[1:48:20] is me for my situation right now God
[1:48:25] gave me this boy come on somebody
[1:48:29] she lookit hit daddy won the round I
[1:48:31] don't know what happened to him but she
[1:48:33] was not looking at any of the conditions
[1:48:34] maybe he was born out of wedlock maybe
[1:48:36] it was this maybe that now how about
[1:48:38] that faith will not entertain hindrance
[1:48:41] as it was one thing this is my son this
[1:48:46] is my boy and the promise belongs to me
[1:48:50] that God will send His Word and raise my
[1:48:53] child up well it was an atmosphere about
[1:48:58] her life you know what kind of
[1:49:00] atmosphere was an atmosphere of life oh
[1:49:04] no doubt Satan was sending his
[1:49:07] meteorites into her you know you stay
[1:49:11] out here in the cool night air and you
[1:49:12] get that nasaan you you could actually
[1:49:15] get more sick you know and your sinuses
[1:49:17] could flare up and this and that every
[1:49:20] time there meteorites was coming in
[1:49:25] there was an atmosphere satan could say
[1:49:30] then you know who your black paint know
[1:49:32] what may gonna come down here come on
[1:49:35] somebody let's just speak your prayer
[1:49:37] let's just speak your plane but you see
[1:49:40] what there are lives and hearts of God
[1:49:42] touch color in ain't about color we're
[1:49:45] seeing the sons and daughters of God God
[1:49:47] has a bride that's made up of many
[1:49:49] Kindred's nations that comes that's the
[1:49:54] atmosphere of the world I'm telling you
[1:49:57] that's why the rebellion in the world in
[1:49:59] this hour because the atmosphere of the
[1:50:02] revealed world it brings unity it brings
[1:50:06] different nationalities cultures
[1:50:08] ethnicities it brings it together in the
[1:50:11] body of Jesus Christ
[1:50:14] it's a war but blessed be the name of
[1:50:18] the Lord the lamb has prevailed
[1:50:21] [Applause]
[1:50:25] no you howl alone if they would take
[1:50:30] that and put that as a bill sign that
[1:50:34] into place then it would be Jesus said
[1:50:39] all lives matter don't get offended on
[1:50:44] me now but Jesus would say I'm come that
[1:50:47] you might have life and have it more
[1:50:50] abundantly but you see what Satan wants
[1:50:54] to do is bring confusion in the strife
[1:50:59] hatred dissimulation in the emulations
[1:51:02] that Satan's working but the working of
[1:51:06] God brings harmony brings unity brings
[1:51:10] brotherhood sisterhood where was a I've
[1:51:19] been gone from here a long time ago go
[1:51:23] ahead closing have already been gone I
[1:51:28] knew you'd come
[1:51:34] she identifies herself you ever heard of
[1:51:39] me
[1:51:39] nope well now I'm william branham I pray
[1:51:44] for the sick never heard of you see she
[1:51:46] wasn't honoring him by any reputation
[1:51:53] rather this one was not just somebody
[1:51:56] who knew about books and tapes and could
[1:51:58] read this is somebody who knew that God
[1:52:01] still moves she knew that the Holy Ghost
[1:52:08] still moves still walks in scandal he
[1:52:13] walks in fresh you see what kind of
[1:52:16] atmosphere she was in it was an
[1:52:19] atmosphere of life so they go in the
[1:52:23] house they get in the house
[1:52:28] the brand said I've been in King's
[1:52:30] palaces been in many fine places he said
[1:52:36] but I never
[1:52:47] what was it it was a presence of God
[1:52:51] it was the atmosphere that had already
[1:52:55] been created in the home the atmosphere
[1:53:01] that Jesus didn't have to put nobody out
[1:53:04] he could just stem here
[1:53:10] now I'm not going to get into that of
[1:53:11] gyruss as we just won't get to it but
[1:53:13] you see the atmosphere that we live it's
[1:53:19] important
[1:53:22] she began to pray but then said I knew I
[1:53:24] know she talked to him before I could
[1:53:28] tell how she talked to her man
[1:53:30] God don't want fancy talk he just wants
[1:53:33] to hear from you well I have a hope I
[1:53:36] get the text right he just wants to hear
[1:53:38] from you he dislikes hearing from you he
[1:53:43] don't have a gray little bubble when
[1:53:46] your text shows up without an image it's
[1:53:49] your face it pops up that's the one in
[1:53:54] my book I knew I knew they would they
[1:53:58] would come into the manifestation sooner
[1:54:00] or later you all hold on I got to take
[1:54:03] this test right now I've got to respond
[1:54:05] to this right now and it might just be a
[1:54:08] Texas says appreciate you
[1:54:12] I thank you Lord government for your
[1:54:14] mercy thank you Lord God that you would
[1:54:18] even give me an order vision for this
[1:54:20] ditty thank you Lord for providing for
[1:54:23] me you see what it is you're worshiping
[1:54:25] by the revelation of who he is to you
[1:54:29] and it begins to create an atmosphere
[1:54:33] that he can move into you see it's our
[1:54:37] faith in Him that'll create an
[1:54:41] atmosphere but our faith it creates the
[1:54:46] atmosphere that his faith moves down and
[1:54:52] doesn't work and does the work
[1:55:01] you know the end of a story with it some
[1:55:03] of you may not brother branham met that
[1:55:05] boy met him getting on a train parson
[1:55:09] parson he said you remember me no no I
[1:55:13] was that boy
[1:55:18] he was out on some waters two words dark
[1:55:26] dark but as they kept on breaking mama
[1:55:33] didn't like what is it the Spirit of God
[1:55:39] was moving upon the waters atmosphere
[1:55:45] was being changed you had a son of God
[1:55:50] and you had a daughter of God mama don't
[1:55:55] you let the devil try to put you down
[1:55:57] let me tell you something you stand as a
[1:56:00] daughter of God and you're praying right
[1:56:03] there remember as a daughter of God you
[1:56:05] have access with God because the same
[1:56:08] the same man Christ Jesus that is on the
[1:56:12] inside of your husband is the same one
[1:56:14] who's on the inside of you say Lord is
[1:56:21] close let's just close nor help me to
[1:56:24] live in that atmosphere
[1:56:30] to realize you're an amateur creator I'm
[1:56:33] an amateur creator every situation
[1:56:36] there'll be things maybe right now maybe
[1:56:38] right now you need a a change of
[1:56:40] atmosphere and the Holy Spirit's been
[1:56:42] speaking to your heart this morning
[1:56:44] perhaps tomorrow there'll be things were
[1:56:48] tested maybe tomorrow Tuesday but you
[1:56:50] see it's live in that atmosphere that's
[1:56:54] your privilege that's your privilege my
[1:56:58] privilege to live in that atmosphere one
[1:57:01] of the clearest signs you know when
[1:57:04] we're not living where that is one of
[1:57:06] the clearest indicators how many of you
[1:57:08] like indicators that let you know
[1:57:10] because when we start getting a little
[1:57:13] bit of a feeling that just isn't right
[1:57:18] brother Samuel that's my flesh I know I
[1:57:20] know my mind battles me too so so what
[1:57:24] do we do about it that's the time you
[1:57:26] say I need to take a trip so what do you
[1:57:33] do you did get on your garments of
[1:57:35] humility your priestly garments and you
[1:57:39] say Lord there's some fruits that I know
[1:57:42] need to come out of my life I can't make
[1:57:46] it happen but you caused almonds to come
[1:57:51] out of a branch you're the same one who
[1:57:56] brought life inside of me and your life
[1:58:00] coming forth through me know what I'm
[1:58:04] standing here as your son as your
[1:58:07] daughter and I'm gonna stay here in this
[1:58:11] atmosphere I may be IVA let the cares of
[1:58:13] life pull me out of it
[1:58:15] maybe I've let failures things where
[1:58:19] I've let meteorites and meteorites has
[1:58:21] struck
[1:58:22] in my service and I'm just living under
[1:58:27] the impact of meteorites the Lord I'm
[1:58:33] walking back into your presence because
[1:58:39] there's more meteorites it's going to
[1:58:41] come but you are my Savior you're a
[1:58:48] moderate Deemer your mind
[1:58:51] [Music]
[1:59:00] fear you're on and on and on
[1:59:03] he is the spheres around our life so no
[1:59:10] matter where it is that you're at maybe
[1:59:12] in your life you've never moved into
[1:59:14] that place to where that hidden man has
[1:59:16] come down there maybe you've never
[1:59:18] surrendered but you know where I'm at no
[1:59:20] matter where you're at this morning he
[1:59:23] can do for you what you need done in
[1:59:26] your life he can he can bring you
[1:59:30] strength oh no I know you may not be
[1:59:32] able to get get that crater mark out you
[1:59:34] can't get it out the crater mark but
[1:59:37] what you can do is let that crater mark
[1:59:39] that scar become a testimony of God's
[1:59:44] healing power God might take the scar
[1:59:48] upon your life and say see my healing
[1:59:52] power was greater than any scar any
[1:59:55] wound it was greater and he restores the
[2:00:01] atmosphere well what does that mother
[2:00:03] said no faith you approach him by faith
[2:00:05] this is where God calls you
[2:00:12] Lord Jesus you're the same yesterday
[2:00:15] today and forever you've never changed
[2:00:19] your father as we Lord come into this
[2:00:25] moment we are mindful Lord that in our
[2:00:28] lives that this atmosphere is so
[2:00:32] important Lord so many times what I pray
[2:00:37] myself included in this prayer so many
[2:00:41] times the Lord we live below our
[2:00:44] privileges
[2:00:46] there's victories we can see in our life
[2:00:50] father you know what our needs are this
[2:00:54] morning so Lord as you brought your word
[2:01:00] your word you would you would send it
[2:01:03] the Bible says you sent your word to
[2:01:07] heal your people
[2:01:09] healing itself Lord God would begin
[2:01:12] first even recognizing there's healing
[2:01:17] Lord God you come Lord to heal soul heal
[2:01:23] the spirit heal the body but I don't
[2:01:28] know what what the needs are better
[2:01:31] throughout the assembly there's might be
[2:01:32] needs more that some that I could be
[2:01:34] aware of but Lord I'm not aware Lord
[2:01:37] that there can be other needs that could
[2:01:39] be here but father we want to Lord God
[2:01:46] move by faith this morning
[2:01:50] we want to walk into that place
[2:01:55] as we moved from the outer court into
[2:01:59] the inner court
[2:02:01] Lord God speaking to you then we moved
[2:02:09] to that innermost place of rest or maybe
[2:02:15] it's relationships husband wife the
[2:02:19] family maybe it's between Lord families
[2:02:22] maybe it's Lord on the job Lord you know
[2:02:28] but Lord as we come into that place of
[2:02:31] rest we come they're not as beggars we
[2:02:37] come there as sons and daughters of God
[2:02:41] every time Lord we've ever been defeated
[2:02:43] it's when we got out of that every time
[2:02:49] when we got away we got out from under
[2:02:52] living there your God from that of the
[2:02:57] Chicano or daily in our lives as Paul
[2:03:04] said we got to die daily our God we
[2:03:08] repent daily
[2:03:13] or Jesus
[2:03:16] whistles
[2:03:19] Oh God may every Lord atmosphere of
[2:03:23] doubt and unbelief and fear
[2:03:29] Lord Grodd
[2:03:31] I'll take the authority by the Holy
[2:03:34] Ghost in your word under the shed blood
[2:03:37] of the Lamb as a son of God commissioned
[2:03:40] by you I take authority Lord God over
[2:03:45] every unclean spirit over every spirit
[2:03:50] of condemnation fear doubt and unbelief
[2:03:56] [Music]
[2:03:57] Satan you can't remain here any more
[2:04:02] when the children of God had been
[2:04:05] touched by his presence and from their
[2:04:08] heart they're Paul SATA yes Lord move
[2:04:15] Lord move Satan take your hands off in
[2:04:22] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:04:26] you've already been defeated the
[2:04:30] atmosphere in this building it's not the
[2:04:34] atmosphere of a man physical man but
[2:04:39] it's the Holy Ghost the person of Jesus
[2:04:43] Christ the omnipotent God the
[2:04:47] omnipresent one omniscient
[2:04:49] [Music]
[2:04:54] I wonder if we just couldn't say Lord
[2:04:56] raise our hands Lord I want to take a
[2:05:02] trip into the holiest of Holies
[2:05:09] let's say brother said no I've got the
[2:05:12] Holy Ghost set that's not all together
[2:05:13] when I'm talking about but I'm talking
[2:05:16] about coming back in bringing your
[2:05:18] thoughts bringing their of your emotions
[2:05:22] our feelings I'm gonna take it in to the
[2:05:28] Holy stories and I know that what I have
[2:05:33] need of that my god supplies
[2:05:38] and want to sink into that atmosphere
[2:05:40] [Music]
[2:05:44] changing of me
[2:05:46] I want you to think of this as your
[2:05:48] hands are up the prophet of God when he
[2:05:52] would express concerning the final pole
[2:05:55] and final change of his ministry he told
[2:05:59] Leo and Jean he said I want you to write
[2:06:01] this down on a paper and I want you to
[2:06:04] put it up in that office the trailer and
[2:06:07] that is that the final pool the final
[2:06:11] change in the ministry will not be so
[2:06:14] much a change in the ministry as it will
[2:06:17] be a change in me how about it this
[2:06:24] morning
[2:06:25] say Lord
[2:06:29] a change in me a change in me you have
[2:06:33] access to this this morning as a son and
[2:06:36] daughter of God if you don't know the
[2:06:39] Lord all you can know him this morning
[2:06:41] you can surrender your heart to him you
[2:06:46] might have walked in here not knowing
[2:06:47] you're a son and daughter of God but you
[2:06:50] can walk out of here this morning with
[2:06:52] the realization that your sin bare the
[2:06:55] Lord Jesus Christ he's already he's
[2:06:58] already paid the price that you could
[2:07:00] walk out of here free he can feel you
[2:07:05] with that newness of life that
[2:07:07] satisfaction on the inside that she'll
[2:07:10] never find from any of the pleasures of
[2:07:13] the world see God will not take
[2:07:17] altogether there's certain desires that
[2:07:20] could be in your natural life that those
[2:07:22] desires themselves are not desires that
[2:07:25] God would take from you but he'll simply
[2:07:28] put them in the right place
[2:07:32] desire to be married that's not a wrong
[2:07:35] desire sometimes it's turned in a
[2:07:38] worldly not the desire to marry but the
[2:07:40] term lust itself
[2:07:43] God does not removed the desire
[2:07:47] to be married the husband in a while but
[2:07:50] Satan would try to provoke that desire
[2:07:52] and that's what we would know it's lust
[2:07:55] but the holy ghost can move down and put
[2:07:59] that in its right place
[2:08:06] why don't you just let him have his way
[2:08:09] [Music]

[2:14:52] under the shadow of that Menace so in
[2:14:57] order for that to come apart come to
[2:15:01] past we believe that he heals hurts

[2:15:44] that brings an atmosphere well we just
[2:15:49] read here in gyrus none which they have
[2:15:51] time to really get into it was faith
[2:15:54] that brought the atmosphere then God

[2:16:18] matter of fact it's going the opposite
[2:16:19] way cover me when when my faith is gone
[2:16:24] anybody's faith been gone well not mine
[2:16:27] brother Samuel Jobs was but you see
[2:16:34] sometimes when it is the faith itself
[2:16:36] here it's residing in our life what it
[2:16:38] is to get everything connected back
[2:16:40] again cover me when my faith is gone I
[2:16:44] notice my faith your faith my faith is
[2:16:49] different than his faith but his faith
[2:16:55] will operate through our faith so cover

[2:17:04] I need strength right now your word is
[2:17:10] true you see how does faith come VIN
[2:17:12] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by

[2:17:18] word now there might be a song that used
[2:17:21] to start singing in your heart remember
[2:17:23] real songs real songs are based on the
[2:17:30] word in an experience David said thy

[2:18:00] what David said David said I'm gonna
[2:18:02] take all my problems and I'm gonna put
[2:18:05] Jesus above

[2:18:10] Jesus above that I feel hopeless but I
[2:18:15] have hope in him I'm expecting him to
