god bless you welcome back that you just welcome back here you never left us she was still that she was still I know streaming in and everything else at home and we were talking with her in different ones visiting but we're just so glad to have your presence back here may God bless you this morning verse 67 of Luke chapter 1 and his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost and prophesied saying blessed be the Lord God of Israel for he hath visited and redeemed his people and hath raised up and horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David as as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets which have been since the world begin that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us to perform the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember his holy Covenant the oath which he sware to our father Abraham that he would grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life may God bless his word and bless you as you're being seated like to continue reading there and thou child shalt be called the prophet of the highest for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways to give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins through the tender mercy of our God whereby the Dayspring from on high that visited us to give light to them that said in darkness and the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit and was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel I'd like to speak to your begin to speak to you on the heart of God when we look at this and just when you think even in our own lives our own bodies are not natural bodies the heart itself is really at the at the center of everything you know even where when a when a person themselves when through many of much of the research and things that I've even looked at a person themselves can actually be in a place when they put them on the respirator and so forth that's that's not for their heart their heart will continue to go but the respirator would be in order for them so that they would actually be able to have the oxygen and so forth in their lungs but it's the heart is so designed in such a way that it actually is not really a part of the nervous system itself you realize that our body is comprised of many different systems and how that those systems work so intricately together they complement one another yet there is no system that is of such vital importance and of great need as the heart is because without the heart then the cells themselves and all the other organs of the body are not able to function to their full capacity and potential and we know that when a heart itself would begin to shut down then the body itself things begin to the other organs and everything else because everything in that body is depending on that heart it's really just quite a quite an amazing thing when I looked at it and you know as you go back over it and the inspiration of God will direct you into those things to look at and you see how that not only how God has wrote his Bible in the heavens but to see how that God would even have Paul would you know Paul would relay the the warfare of a believer he would relay it by what he saw with the soldier that here he was shackled with and Paul would be able to catch inspiration from that and ride of how that we would be as believers to war and have an Armour an Armour that's given to us by God and to see how that you know it's in another place the gospel is likened to a race but then we find that here within also Paul would like into the body of believers and he would like in the body of believers to that of the natural body and realizing that within it that there is a need within a body for the heart and you know many times you know we hear the phrase sometimes where people say have a heart and we understand that's more than just the blood pump and that that deals with the compassion that deals with looking upon something and really taking taking into consideration some things and so when we we look at this I to me when I see this and the purpose of the heart and we begin to look at this in the heart of God and as we've been dealing with the mercy of God here I find in this in a state that where when the word itself that's been prophesied and we know that it all of this begin this prophecy begin to come forth clear from the time of the the Garden of Eden and here we are in this moment of Scripture we're living this is what all things were pointing to that the Lord Jesus he spoke that in genesis 3:15 that he would give the woman a seed and then he added to that and he he opened that it would come through that of the Abraham's seed and then he further opened that even further and added to it as the Prophet tells us and he revealed that it would be through the the seed of David and so it would come through that of Judah and but the mem tells us at in the church age book he says he added to it he didn't sow what God added did not take away from the original revelation all it did was take what the original revelation was and further bring it into view and when as the Prophet would would let us know there he said the reason God would do that is so that the believers themselves would have something to look forward to so God knows that within that that the word because as believers well why is it that you and I are believers well it's not because we studied our way into this it's not because we'll everything just makes sense it isn't because of that at all because in the reality that God many times in our own lives there are things that are taking place that do not make sense but yet we understand that the very first stage where a person where God would deal with alive he God would deal even with that of bringing where the word would come forth and the person in their mind would say and that's exactly right I need a Savior yes I I need to repent and so forth there's all a beginning stage of that but God's desires for that to drop even deeper yet God would would a give all of this out and the adding and the opening to further clarify his path and you know all the way down through time the believers that are identified the elect of God have always been waiting for the word and the promise to be fulfilled they lived within that word they walked within that word and we and I find that when I look at this here within the Scriptures it's a it's a lot like when Israel was than the day that we're living in Israel when the fulfillment really of the mercy of God that was promised the oath that was given in another place it said the truth of Jacob in another place it said this sure mercies of David all of these things that were spoken in that time Israel had all of these things wrote out of everything that was going to take place and to a believer a believer looks for this word to be made manifest it isn't that you know within it that a believer knows everything but it's just something where a believer is inclined by the leadership of the Spirit of God that's just like the animals that know when it's time to come back home after their departure in the fall they know to start flying again you don't have to send them a telegraph it's something built within them that they they begin to know and it's something that begins to move in the season a time and that's exactly the way it is with us as believers it's things that begin to move upon our lives like many of you you can look at that maybe you were sitting in a you know in a in a cold and formal place and the church and things and and you know but all of a sudden how God they're just something begin to deal with your life it wasn't that you looked down and said well you know they this place doesn't have nothing no but it was something within you said there's got to be more there's got to be more what was that that there wasn't you that was what God placed within you and there was a deep that was calling that only God Himself could satisfy there was a lot of good things around but yet only God can satisfy that part of himself and so it begin to draw you like like the salmon even coming back to its its bedding grounds it begins to draw you back into that place and a believer is looking for the word itself to be fulfilled yet Israel in the midst of this time as I look at this they had all of the word laying out before him they had the law they had the prophets they had the Psalms they had everything as a matter of fact we could put it like this they were much like us they have all of the scriptures if I could say it there was a lot of teaching there was a lever ething laid out but yet within it all what what was missing was they were not ready for the fulfillment of that word they weren't ready yet they had the word but yet they didn't they they weren't ready for it to be fulfilled but they thought they were ready oh my I believe it's all my heart friends that yes we we need to have a positive confession but I believe we need to be careful that our positive confession doesn't become arrogance I believe it needs to be something to where we realize that who were depending on to open the word to us and who were depending on toom oldest and to shape us and to correct us and rebuke us and to lift us up and to mold our lives I believe we need to be conscious of that because a word that has come and been delivered to you and I the word has not just been delivered and that's it of it it's been fulfilled know the word that has been delivered was a prophecy that laid in the word but now when that that has been spoken across this generation it is for a God is raising up a people that will reflect that word that the prophet has spoken in this hour and that's the expectation it is to look for that word and that word becoming material in our life more and more and more until the very of the body that's the expectation of our lives and you know they they weren't they needed a preparation and when I look at this I I I think you know when we go into the scriptures if I can go to a few scriptures here in before this and Luke Warner a few places up when the angels come to Zechariah and verse 13 and he says fear not Zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and shall call his name John and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord not in the sight of man yet many of them in mire you they admired him but they didn't know what this was about now remember even the Lord Jesus could speak to many and say you rejoiced you walked in his light for a season but if they fail to walk on into further light of what that light was pointing to because when this is fulfilled this part of the word remember when this parts being fulfilled it is declaring there's a junction where it's declaring this is what is to be fulfilled next for what there is one standing among you John's ministry was a ministry that not only was in preparation but it was a ministry that could declare he is now here it was an announcement it was a sign and saw within this in the sight of the Lord he shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother and many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God how much you look at this word turn turn it means to turn to through the worship of the true God to calls to return to bring back and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the father's to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord there was a mission there was a hold that had taken hold upon John's life and to see that within here a turn that was to take place I won't want you to think of it here they are reading the then many of the people they knew these things they could quote the prophets they could quote the Psalms they could quote all of the writings they could quote these things but they needed to be turned there had to come a turn to had to come something that would where there would be a turn brought about in their lives so when you think of it the how they are looking at all of this but yet they need to be turned and turned in their hearts you see because what was what God was coming to deal with was a heart condition hallelujah and in order to deal with the heart condition you need more than just an MD you need a cardiologist there right you need someone of a reputation when you're putting your heart into his hands so here he's coming to this would be the objective and this would be the outcome of his ministry is to turn the hearts of the people and to prepare so where where Israel what a contrast to their thinking in this time it when you would have asked them and asked the the great religious of that time in that day and you would ask them all their lawyers all their scribes all their Pharisees and Sadducees if you asked them they would say we're ready we're ready we're ready ready for the Messiah to come we're ready for that but yet they weren't ready there's a difference in being ready and thinking you're ready cuz you see they thought they were ready why did they think they were ready because they knew the word they had all of this in front of them but it takes God to come and to fulfill that word and open the eyes so that one might see and be changed they weren't in condition they were not in condition to receive the Messiah let me put it like this they were not in condition to begin the Commission and in this age where the churches and everything had got to and I you understand what I'm saying I you know I'm not taken away from churches but I how do we look at how the condition that that had come into and God did not send a new Bible in this hour the message never replaced the Bible the messages that which was sealed within the Bible it's the same original message but the church drifted from that message and that message is calling you and I to the true atonement to the true relationship to the true United with the Lord Jesus Christ and the church is the conditions that they were they were in they were in nope no condition to finish up the Great Commission because the urgency this whole space of time is not about works of man yet Satan has made it that way this whole time is about the gathering of the elect of God and then gathering it on that gathering and unto the Lord Jesus Christ and Paul spoke of you know even Paul spoke of rare there was men who had different objectives right Paul spoke of that how that there were some but yet in the midst of it God's Word went on there had to be a fit reception there had to be a message of preparation that would bring the people into a condition to be able to see you realize friends that even in our lives sometimes when we come in here to the house of God we're in no kind of condition to be able to receive sometimes listen sometimes even when we're about things during the week but I want you to think of this God Himself will prove even his mercy at times that you and I are not even in condition and he'll come by and he'll you know what's doing that he's doing that he's leading us that's leadership it's not just teaching us he's showing us how to lead even in our own lives but also and also how did we approach even one another when even one another are not deserving of good graces are you missing me I'm not just talking about the body of Jesus Christ I'm talking about around in our workplace and everywhere else we go and you know sometimes you may have had somebody that you know you you told her what kind of meat you want and man they just snap back and what are you gonna do you say you can either keep going with it or you can just say I'll take this and hey how's your day going Oh same you it's kind of but how do you know that what you speaking expressing that kind some places I've got it to where I go I'll stand there to meat counter in that long meat counter and I'll look just like I'll take my number and wait and I've got some of them they'll come and they know when you know they'll see me when I'm there and all of a sudden you'll see things change on their face I know I'm funny looking but I know it's a lot of times cuz I'll tell some of them when they they've had their walk emolia so why didn't you share with me you know it's things that's like that I you understand what I hope you understand what I'm saying that God that they were in no condition many times we're not in any condition but it's up to it's God Himself moving upon us but you know what God Himself will not create the condition for us but he will bring what's needed if we just surrendered to it it will tenderize us it'll soften us up that he might come battle this word I'm telling you what a godly sir that would come down and he's desiring to fulfill his word in such a way that he'll remove the vilest of attitude he'll remove the violence of that how does he do it by his presence his love oh my little circle right around this building it'll circle right around your heart to bring you into a place to begin to reflect and think and say Lord I need more of you hallelujah oh my the Bible says you know when we look at it in matthew chapter or Malachi 3 it he said behold I send my messenger before my face or he shall prepare the way before me and that word even preparing it so it deals the same word it's a turning and and he said the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the Covenant in whom you delight behold he shall come and saith the Lord of Hosts all of this that was going to take place the word was giving them a direction of the fulfillment and there were hearts and lives who were awaiting on the Messiah they were on their toes waiting you had a Simeon you had a Hanna you had this the remnant was small that was waiting but God was going to have some people that in the darkest of times let me tell you something the darkest of time it doesn't mean so much gloom but theology and everything of man is such darkness and such gloom because it doesn't allow the Rays of God's life to shine through and that does produce a gloom but there's a darkness that's greater than just and then they're not having sunlight it's a darkness where there is a covering and a Anna and and a removing of the power of Almighty God hallelujah the one whom you delight and he shall suddenly come to his temple so his temple so the preparations made the temple will be on earth and God Himself will come and it feels that temple who will feel that temple the messenger of the Covenant Amen who is that the very heart of God himself the Bible has said I think of how that it spoke you know regarding John you know it talks about how every high place will be brought low and how every every a low place will be brought high you talked about how that the mountains would skip like Rams all of these things and yet we know that when you think of even the mountains and things skipping like Rams and how that that would be wrote in the scripture then it would be creation that would be rejoicing because this earth knows it's already had its water baptism in the days of Noah and this earth has been waiting to come back into the control of the sons and daughters of God once again Shiva's getting anxious and so the earth itself when this Advent began to start here when when John stepped on the scene and all of this begin to come oh my the mountains themselves begin to skip like Rams the leaves were clapping their hands yet everybody else could say the leaves are doing like they normally do the mountains I don't see the mountains skipping like rounds but if they can see what was going on in the heart of the earth oh if it could be seen what's going on in the heart of the believer as the time is drawing closer all things were drawing closer hey man it's his fulfillment of his word that creates a condition in our lives here you find John coming forth very familiar passages but here John comes he's preaching in the wilderness of Judea and in verse 2 of Matthew 3 this was what he said repent repent this guy can't be saying what I think you saying repent we have the prophets we have the Psalms we have the law repent if anybody that doesn't need to repent we don't you see you see even right there they were so far removed from the heart of God you say we're gonna say no the heart of God had not come yet careful now the heart of God was already moving upon the earth it had been the heart of God that had announced even all the way down from the Garden of Eden when they walked out of Eden there and they were going on their way and the lambskins were beating against the legs the heart of God came down and spelled out love and said I'll make a way back for you the heart of God has been pressing the whole time and here he comes ministering alert this is the mountains they're gonna skip like Rams these are valleys being brought up repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand what had been they here now the kingdom of heaven here there's going to be in divine issuance down into earth whereby that this kingdom will now move through the hearts of our people and then work to the full reestablishment of the kingdom of Almighty God being set up on this earth verse 3 see it's at hand verse 3 for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make his paths straight so they knew this they knew it by the letter but here is a preparation going on because the way why does it have to be prepared because their hearts were not ready to receive him do you understand you miss disjunction you miss this necessary Junction you miss it this is why there are junctions that are put within the word this was a keystone it was pointing you realize that even they didn't have to go back even after the ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ they didn't have to go back and preach the baptism of John this now had been fulfilled but they did bring along this is the fulfillment of the word when Peter stood there on the day of Pentecost in Acts chapter 2 when he began to speak what did he do he began to take up the word that now has been fulfilled that word which had been spoken and as Peter began to preach that word the Spirit of God picking that word up that was not Peter as a man that was the Holy Ghost himself that was beginning to pull that word together and connect those pieces of what was prophesied that's been fulfilled these things that were spoken now are being made manifest and what you see and you hear of a very manifestation of a promise of Almighty God what did that do it allowed the people that were there in that time they've brought conviction to their heart but it brought out of them a realization that a way is open for me but I can go free I can walk in liberty to what must we do to be saved see the preaching you in Peter spoke it brought them to a realization they needed to be safe and they could be saved the ministry the fulfillment of this word right here was to bring knowledge of salvation that's a fulfillment of this to prepare the way where it's like and where in the Orient this word is taken from where there would be different things in the roadway boulders and everything else it would be like you know coming down lake breeze this morning you know and here you come you know you know your normal timeline I'm just gonna come to church and you find there's boulders in the road you find that there's all kinds of trees that are blown over in the road you say I want to come to church what's gonna take more than a four-wheel drive to get over them boulders ain't gonna plow over see God don't plow over things in our life [Applause] he comes with a message of authority - clearer but we have to receive that message and when we received that message and continue to receive what is it it's God himself by his word through the spirit preparing the pathway for himself that's what the rapture the change of the body it's Christ himself culminating not only in the pathway that he had prepared but all through the journey where he had brought a people to present unto himself so to remove all those things you've got to remove all of that and that's what John's ministry was to remove and you know as I said before you look at anything remove what has to be removed we've got the word what are you talking about John remember Jesus he Jesus he told him he said search the Scriptures these were not people who did know the Scriptures they knew him but he's telling him to search to search means to think to consider think about the time that we're living him think about what the word that's being spoken think about all of these things that's something that for none of us is to take for granted hope you understand what I'm saying when you have been born again I'm not worried I'm not worried then well you know I'll be lost in me and I'm not worried about that but my heart's desire by the new is I want to walk pleasing to him when there's things that he deals with me in my life and says that is not going to go on any longer I want to line up with that word I don't want to make excuses for it I want to line up with it because you know what it is he's not against me he's preparing the way for him to further make himself known in me that's what he's doing and he gives you an idea thority to stand on that word doing me hurt no it may cut though it may look impossible but it's not you fulfilling it but it's us giving ourselves to it because you might you or me you know when God first got a hold of our life but even now there are things that you can look at right now that you might do and deal with and you think my goodness the things that God took out of my life before and what God's done in my life but now you see certain things of family strains that are boulders right you see certain parts of genetic genetic things that would be there looks like logs across the road because nobody in your family has seemingly been able to live above that but let me tell you something you are ordained you are ordained the strains in your family the strains in my family no doubt they're different your strains aren't better than my strains are worse than my strains or whatever more but the one thing about it God through his body is manifesting his power and authority as an overcomer that there will not be one thing not one complex not one family strain they'll not be one thing that this bride is not walking in victory over you have been ordained to walk in victory amen this word comes with power in the forty to do what cast out those things to remove logs that are in the road because you know what happened logs they close things up they might be beautiful but they're not beautiful in the past William we don't want things that crawled up the past because you clogged up the pathway there's a restriction of blood flow verse 5 oh my no that's like a verse 4 and the same John had on a tuxedo whatever garments that they wore but he had an arraignment of camels hair a leather girdle about his loins and his meat was locusts with wild honey you know God has a sense of humor John was not dressing like this to try to make himself humble let's just clear the air real quick on that one you don't have to make yourself humble let the Spirit of God bring the humility in your life that's false that's a false humility but John here he is how God would have this to be we're all of a sudden he's in the desert and then he makes his showing when it's time his six month six months of ministry and he makes his showing at this time in the thick of it that how that the people at that time when they're watching everything take place these great refined men who had to work they're looking at him and I love how brother branham describes it he said here stepped out a man he said the ner hardly took a bath what is six to six months but Rev said he didn't brush his teeth now you young boys know well maybe some of you brothers do but you see it was a conditioned look at this how God allowed this to be it was not a condition that would appeal to the natural senses he was something too whether religious would say you you look how you dressed what does that have to do with it that absolutely means nothing nothing I'm not gonna try to set a new standard but he wouldn't make it wouldn't make a difference if I preached in jeans a little brother Sammy don't worry I'm not gonna start I'll do that on youth meetings but you understand sometimes things can become so of a formality to where we're looking for certain things that's not what we look for what we look for as believers is the Spirit of God to come down and take that word and begin to deal with our life that's who we want to see we want the real preacher to come by this way and preach to you and I we don't want sermons we want the Word of God to come and deal with our life if I've got logs in the way I want him out of the way if I've got boulders and the way I want him out of the way the Bible says they went out to him he was not going to where they were at they had to go out to him remember when Israel sinned in the wilderness God told Moses pick up the tabernacle and pitch it over here and you tell the people stripped themselves of their ornaments and they want to get right those who want to seek the Lord they must leave out of the camp and come to the tabernacle why their camp was polluted so it's showing they had to go out to him he was not a part of their systems this was a calling out I'm not calling out not a uniting with so they were looking for this great advent of the Messiah they were looking for job but what is was going to be this was going to be an anointing of their sister an anointing of their thinking surely when he comes Lord Ram describes it they'll crank the golden handle and down the corridor here here the Messiah will come right down the corridor I don't know about you but there's a lot of things that I've thought wrong and I'm so glad for his mercy that he cleanses and I'm glad that if as I can submit my heart and life to Him he will straighten out all that needs to be straightened out because he didn't call me to straighten everybody else out yeah I got enough right here with this guy I know I don't worry listen I pray for all the brothers and sisters in different ones but I got enough right here maybe putting you all down that's where my loving cares for y'all set a man stronger the first time they went out to him Jerusalem in all Judea and all the region round about Jordan and were baptized of him in Jordan confessing their sins this minute notice it's a ministry and there's confession of sins going on not just walking into a church it's not just coming a coming in and saying but I just move along with it but it's it's looking there's got to be something there must be something that would strike a harder life there's got to be a new beginning God's not going to keep on building on things that are not right i'ma give me an example if you've not been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you've not repented of your sins how do you expect to go any further with God that's the first base that's first base what other saying that people shouldn't do it because you tell them Peter somebody's got to save the word it's up for the word the Spirit of God to bring it to your heart for you to see where are you at and what you need to do God's not gonna rapture anything that has not come through his word Strait is the gate narrow is the way and few there be that find it but then again if I say if you don't feel - well that's up that's up to you I'm nah I can't make anything out of anybody but I can preach the word and it has to be the word that tugs your heart John was not going and gathering people up he was not rounding people up I'm telling you friends in this hour this is not a rounding people up you either want to go on and serve God or you don't you got to make up your mind either you do or you don't because the Church of the Living God we are going on now if you want to come along come along and go on northern mercy verse 7 but when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism he said unto them o generation of vipers John couldn't you have sweetness generation of vipers he's tying them in who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come even though they were not part of the prophecy as far as to receive it and walk in it they could feel something was going on something was getting their attention oh it was an issuance of the heart of God yet they didn't know it it's like a serpent begins to run they begin to burn fire begins to come up they take they take they take flight who has warned you to flee who warned you how could he say who warned them why didn't why didn't jump just say praise be to God the Pharisees are coming down here they're gonna be bad fast it was discernment he can tail friends by the way they were coming in the next verse bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance you realize that fruits must be present even for repentance and after you repent there will be fruits that come from that but they did not have the necessary fruit for repentance here they were coming down there and John could let them know you're not really here for this reason you're not here for the right reason thank not verse 9 look at this discernment think not to say within yourselves we have Abraham to our Father look where they're wrestling we have Abraham to our Father for I say unto you that God is able these stones to raise up children unto Abraham and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast in the fire john was declaring to them the fruit what i'm saying what is here you're not bringing the fruit for the season where your life is now it's at a saint you're out of season it's not the right season this is a season of a fulfillment of the word and you should be bringing forth fruit meat for repentance with Peters faith but the day of Pentecost what happened as the way went forth what did it do the presence of the Lord brought about the necessary fruit that was meet for repentance there was no breaking up here among these people see their whole thing repent why I got a repent they needed a breaking up how many times brother random you said he that phrase and go through it how many times I've heard him say it and then you study there just keeps saying keep looking over and the call that is going forth we need a breaking up we need an old-fashioned cleansing revival we need a break in you said brother Samuel that was looking for the seals to come oh hold on a moment now in recognizing your day in its message 1965 the Prophet at the end of that message he makes a declaration God create in me a revival make me Lord God in a place to receive more of you Lord make me more humble make me more willing Lord in order for there to be a revival a revival is a breaking up and I find the Prophet pray that over and over different words but would pray it over and over I believe that's leadership for you and I am there's a need for a breaking up how that these the individuals where they're at the Pharisees and the people in that time now there were children that were were being turned and they were they were the children were actually the father's the father's were being pointed to the message of the children those that were living at the time the children that would be the children of the promise the children of Abraham all of them were seed of Abraham but not all of them were children seed of Abraham crucified him but the children didn't are you with me there's a difference in seed in children children are those who are of the promise the elect of God his smell was a seed of Abraham are you they were seeds but the children the children are accounted for the promise so how that this ministry was turning the hearts of the fathers to the children this is the fulfillment of the word they needed a breaking up but you know what when they would read these words that we read in our opening text they believed there needed to be something come and removed them from the occupiers they needed to be free of this Roman occupation you see where they were at they were trying to make the world a better place you can't make the world a better place you can see look friends you can see things even from the times I don't even know where it would be at right now in education but even in the times it's things that where things are moving about in people are you know they don't know what's going on they're trying then even within where we're at right here in our place to know how they're trying to do everything in our city our county to do everything they can to control the drug traffic and everything else that's going on they're trying to do everything completely wrapping those things are going on what is it it's a heading up time it's time to be ready they men it's time to be ready and stay ready and live ready I'll tell you right now you live loose you will be left behind I'll tell you that in the name of the Lord you live of all kinds of stuff in your heart and in your life you will be left behind the rapture is not a cleansing it's a cleaning God sent a message to bring the cleansing to you and I right now the Holy Spirit to take this word and clean you and I out the rapture is not the cleansing it's the claiming of the cleansed well I'll be free of this then or I didn't know right now the power of God if you cannot believe in the power of God that will actually bring that deliverance in your life right now how can you believe it for the change of your body I'm telling you you can't God don't want you to walk with the hope so he wants you to walk with an O so not an arrogance but with you can look back and say the same God that gives me grace and strength that has changed my life that berthed is life inside of me that same God will change this body they looked at they needed free from Roman occupation we need again we need to get rid of everybody else around us everybody else is the problem get rid of them you get rid of the Romans we'll be better off that's not true I said that's not true to a believer you can live victorious in the midst of hell God come into the fact Herron Age commended the Pergamon age right there in Satan seen in fact our age when it was the darkest the hardest to be able to work yet God commended him for their work in labor of love Levin said God was showing that in the face of all that in the darkest of time to the how that Satan could not stop the work of God as a matter of fact it was more strengthened during that time tell you friends I don't mean to put nobody down but I've got to preach the word straight here there ain't no time to be looking for sympathy on things in your life God has given if God has given us a word and he has and then it's up to you and I had to reach up and say God Lord your word all that I have need of Lord God what I need Lord is in you Lord Jesus and turn it down in your life though brother shall not keep coming back service after service but yet have you really given yourself to him are you nursing on the promise but you cannot nurse on the promise with all gems in your life art and bitterness and everything else against people you can't do that with them kind of boulders but saying I've got a right that you do but if you're a lamb you'll forfeit it this is where the part of Isaiah 53 he was led as a lamb dumb before her Shearer's it's a need of a breaking up before God can add to you there's breaking up they didn't realize the biggest enemy they had was themselves their biggest enemy was themselves they needed a birth by the way he came showed him what they needed they believed they needed a great general he gave him a baby what was he showing I myself came to the earth in birth so that you might be born again he was showing them this is what the advent was all about but see the simplest of things the overlooked you're made to live victorious friends that's absolute truth don't you let the devil tell you that there's got to be this kind of condition this kind of condition no no it's not that kind of a condition that allows you to live victorious it might you might feel more comfortable but you were born to overcome there are things that can be uncomfortable but as you're taking in of that word and living under the presence of Almighty God God will give you strength to move give you strength to subdue those things you see this here let me just I'm going to kind of take a little bit of a turn here now when we look at this the scriptures have talked about the tender mercies of God and you're familiar with that I've referred to those things but yet you you've read them as Bible readers and here we find in the scriptures right here it says to perform the mercy that was promised when God would these would be expressed in the Old Testament of his tender mercies you find David would write of him you would speak of at the tender mercies but yet the tender mercies were not just they're not just something that was just as we would say a sentimental not just that of a love that just reaches down in a manner and says well I see how you are and I understand that you can never know no no but his tender mercies as a matter of fact the Prophet would describe it like this that when the prophets themselves were sent by God to Israel he said it was the tender mercies because after all tender mercies are the depth of his love his love when the Bible says love covers a multitude of sin it doesn't mean that love makes excuses for sin love deals with sin that's the real covering none makes excuses for it it deals with it sometimes what people call love and not love at all it is it is let me correct them but it's on the spectrum as the Prophet could talk about that love it goes from the uttermost filth to that of agape so then you can look and say my one is being said or done we're on that spectrum is that coming from because when it comes down to it will God does the love of God project itself within that manner so the tender mercies of God when we look at it to even think for his tender mercies to send the prophets to Israel to turn him back that was God's love he didn't want to see him go that way the tender mercies of God that would speak to you and I and call us if the ways that might be stranger or lukewarmness or things that might be creeping in in your life it's the mercies of God the tender mercies of God is the tender mercy of God to call hearts and lives to repentance yes sir it's the tender mercies of God to bring real genuine conviction Israel getting back in their homeland it was the tender hand of Jehovah he would not be classified by just people looking at it in that way it would they would look at him and say oh no that I couldn't tenderness that was harshness but he was the tender hand so this tenderness that we look out here I'm just I'm making a turn here now in Luke and Luke 1 where we were looking for our text the Bible had spoke in verse 78 of Luke 1 through the tender mercy of our God whereby the Dayspring from on high hath visited us to give light to them that said in darkness and the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace the Dayspring that promise that was being looked for the day's spring there had been arising in the ministry of john when this would start here even as this was being prophesied here there is an announcement that day is fixing to dawn well is it isn't announcing a day that's coming the word the water has already prophesied of the day God is not repeating himself like they think he did in Genesis he simply announcing what has been prophesied this is the time let there be light it was announcing the day what day the day of redemption yes here Amen this is the the the the the entering of ray of redemption to the Daystar how did this come through the tender mercy of our God I wonder if we asked the religious men in that time what do you think about John I think he's harsh I think he needs what may have a little bit more manners I'd rather he didn't use such sharp terms like that as Vipers and things like that I mean if he wants to use them that way and feel that way he my dread he wouldn't do it like that but to say to ask them do you think this is the tender mercy oh no not him you see their conception of tender mercy was wrong it's just like our conception of real genuine humility can be wrong too you can meet somebody that can be ever so sweet oh they have such a sweet spirit I've met a lot of people that got nice sweet spirits but you cross someone time all oh brother Samuel there's an allowance for all that really friends what I look for is is not when I see these things where somebody has a nice sweet spirit and they can do this and so forth do that but this is what the Holy Spirit is one within us the Bible says he'll lead and guide us into all truth well if he will lead us then we must be able to be led so if a person cannot be led and be in subjection to the word they do not have it I don't care how sweet it is over the same girl how could that be you tell me how that those virtues could dwell in somebody nature given but yet not be what God accepts that could be ever so temperament ever so much virtue ever so much knowledge and yet it's not even recognized as a building of God through the tender mercy of our God this word tender I begin to look at this and boy things just further exploded yesterday on me I began to look at this and I began to just look over let me just read it here the bowels were regarded by the Hebrews out of this the word tender as the seat of the tenderer affections kindness benevolence Compassion's a heart in which mercy resides so just in case you're wondering where mercy ought to be it ought to be in yet it ought to be in your heart but the next little part that goes along with this right here that this word in the Greek which I don't know how to pronounce this word is also strengthened from the word spleen which is the spleen the spleen in the body the spleen for science lesson Wow y'all ready for a science lesson I'm tell you what we just had a metal lesson right you got people in here ready to be steel workers after Thursday night it's not me it's them we're not gonna be steel workers we just lets us know we're the ones being worked on so notice of how that the spleen itself is an organ in the far left part of the admin abdomen to the left of the stomach the spleen varies in size and shape between people but it's commonly fish shaped purple and about 4 inches long because the spleen is protected by the ribcage you can't easily feel it unless it's abnormally enlarged the spleen plays an important or a multiple supporting roles in the body it acts as a filter for blood as part of the immune system all the red blood cells are recycled in the spleen and platelets and white blood cells are stored there the spleen also helps fight certain kinds of bacteria that cause pneumonia and meningitis so how it works is as the blood enters the spleen the healthy blood cells pass on through the healthy blood cells pass right on through but but damaged and get blood cells get caught in a series of narrow passages and then get broken down so the spleen itself is there to pass on the good blood cells but it's there to correct bad blood cells thank God for a spiritual spleen so the heart of God when we're looking how that the spleen would work in conjunction with the heart because in this passage of scripture says the tender mercies of our God so the tender mercy is referring to that bed that where it's deep seated here within the spleen so what does the spleen in the heart have to do with one another stay with me we understand when we look at this at the heart itself morale brother Brennan would say in countless times in the message and he would talk about he says I used to think that God was angry with me but Jesus loves me I used to think that I'll tell you what to me when I look at that it wasn't a bit of pride about that at all he never said I had it right the whole time that have been pride God couldn't use me I used to think it type that in sometimes I used to think any man what about in you and I can we type it in in ours oh no not my database mine is authenticated yeah it's probably cryptid and everything else - better make sure they don't have no viruses in it you've got it up to date so here Christ being the very heart of God now once you think of this for a moment God's desire has been made known even from the heavens the Bible says in Psalms my team that he has he declared his firmament his work in the heavens they declared his handiwork and it speaks of how men all of those the planets the celestial bodies they're how they're all these bodies are all set forth and yet he says in the midst of it he had put the tabernacle for the Sun and he would speak about that when that Sun itself would be like a bridegroom coming out of a chamber a strong one what was he doing casting forth his light throughout that plane he was letting it be known that his desire was to be the center of it all he's been the center of it all but his desire was more than just to be the center of the songs the center of the profits the center of the Bible he wanted to be the center in you and me that was only a type of what he desired to be in you and me the center in our lives even to see where that he would tell Moses Moses in Exodus 25 when Moses is up there on the mountain he would tell Moses go and tell the people let them make me a sanctuary he didn't say let him make me a tabernacle I hope you're with me now God don't want to just dwell on flesh there had to come a tabernacle that was willing to give his life but he did not ask him to build him a tabernacle he didn't just want to come on the spirit realm he said let him make me a sanctuary that sanctuary is the secret of the Most High it's a sanctuary his dwelling place the heart the soul let them how can they make him a sanctuary because he provides the necessary conditions for the people to walk in it and become a dwelling place God has let this be known there was here the unfolding of this revelation become more clear Israel chose a man after their own choosing but God gave him grace but Saul kept doing what Saul wanted to do and eventually as he kept on intruding into places that he had no business intruding why did he do it he became impatient it showed he could not wait on the word to be fulfilled wait on the word to be fulfilled what does that have to do he couldn't Eve you mean to tell me because he'll in an offer to sacrifice he couldn't wait on the word to be fulfilled because the word is fulfilled in a season by divine order and even in the little thing he for Sukkot little foxes spoiled by it's not the big things we leave undone it's the little thing so here was a man that did not come seeking this position but he was ordained for it he was a man after God's own heart God sought him out just like God is something you and I out just like God would would seek you out this morning that's an older man a young man a young lady all alone God seeking you out for what someone after his own heart that he might commune with and make know what his desires are he could not make known his desires to saw he could press the phone David about building a house and then turn around and tell David David you're not the guy that's going to do it but David would come around in that say chapter ii samuel 7 and say Lord what thou has revealed to me I shall pray for this slide that I there will be a house established that my name will be a seller he took comfort in what the word that was spoken it was not him that would bring it to past but he said it'll be your son he was comforted in the word and he could pray over not become frustrated about it he was a man after God's own heart David oh my he had his flaws just like you and I have our flaws but David was a man after God's own heart Abraham had his flaws but Nehemiah chapter 9 said thou found this Abraham had a faithful heart o Lord what was it was faithful his heart what's God after the heart that was the same way with their Jeremiah Isaiah all the elect nouns are hot he had their heart he didn't demand their heart he he received their heart I want you to look at this for a moment we're talking about David David who could shout about the law of God the long cadenza the long doesn't doesn't offer to your grace but David said that love is sweet Oh God see it's how you look at the word David was able to look at the word knowing that the word was not against him his love for the word the word was working and bringing out in David's life what needed to be brought out glory if David could shout about that lord have mercy what we be doing oh ma look at David here let me read a few places here David says in Psalms 25 verse 6 remember O Lord thy tender mercies and thy loving-kindness for they have been ever evolved remember not the sins of my youth nor my transgressions according to thy mercy remember that many for that goodness sake o Lord watch this David is directing the attention of the Lord how can a man like this direct the attention of God how can David tell god what to remember and what not to remember he's not doing this arrogantly how can he did this what what is this it's because David is connected with the heart of God the heart of God is pulsating it's pulsating and david realizes he's walking in fellowship in step with what god has revealed to him so david could say remember lord that tender mercies but remember not her like how could David say remember not because there was a sacrifice that was before him he was connected to that sacrifice I hope you're with me now David had that authority to believe that you see down through the ages you've heard this maybe for some of you you have it but in all of them down through time not only the prophets but many others it was Christ in them it was Christ indeed it was Christ in Moses it was Christ in on and on it was Christ when the Bible says in Isaiah 53 I don't remember the exact verse but when it says he is despised and rejected not was not will be is despised and rejected Christ has always been despised and rejected in every generation but he's also been accepted it's not Moses let's look here just for a moment let me break over now as a a63 we're here that Isaiah would speak about the restoration time he would talk about the loving I will mention of the loving-kindnesses of the Lord and the praises of the Lord according to all that the Lord had bestowed on us and the great goodness toward the house of Israel which he had bestowed on them according to His mercies and according to the multitude of his loving-kindness for he said surely they are my people children that will not lie so he was their Savior in all their affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his presence save them who's the angel of his presence Christ not to separate people it's Christ the heart of God what was a written promise now that written promise begin to have life pumping through a promise of deliverance out of the bondage in Egypt which was a type of deliverance for us out of bondage and the Spirit of God began to move upon that promise and what is it it's the heart of God it begins to because in the heart of God going forth when the Israel had sinned out there made the golden calf went the way they went but Moses stood in the breach and when God told Moses get out of the way I'm gonna kill every one of them and I'm going to start a new generation with you notice Moses said repent a lot for this turn from this Lord what did Moses put before God his word all the way down through the scriptures you find over and over remember that word Oh Lord to Abraham remember that word Oh Lord remember why this is his world I tell you the coming of this message right now to you and I it is God remembering his word hallelujah he's remember his word he descended in Revelations in one rainbow about his head his mind on the Covenant he had remembered his covenant that he spoke he remembered what he said to you he's remembered with a promise that he has quickened BR he's remembered the healing he's remembered to deliver it he has remembered his word the angel of his presence was there to save them God couldn't cross over Moses cuz he looked in Moses what did he see Christ he saw the cross no wonder the Prophet could stop in the middle of the message presuming and say oh the power of the believer the power of the believer surely he must be talking about shutting the heavens no he's talking about us shutting off things from entering into our lives to whether we're ready to span the breach for one another come on somebody you don't span the breach for somebody else by running somebody else down does it let us be really clear on that one right there hear how that this David is is tied in David would speak in Psalm 51 after what had happened with between him and Bathsheba here's David in Psalms 51 verse 1 have mercy on me O God according to thy loving-kindness according to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions I hope you understanding here David is not communing with a dead word I hope we can see that the heart of God is not a letter it's a person of Christ we're not communing with the letter we're not being built up with doctrines and yet we're powerless if we're without power we've missed it it's not about the doctrines if you have the right if you have been born of the Spirit of God don't worry the bark will be on the tree yes it will the Spirit of God within you he will lead and guide you into all truth but sometimes it's so much weight had been placed upon the doctrine and yet we've got people in our ranks that our doctrines feel listen friends I'm not saying that to be hard I'm saying that that's a report of concern you think even though the falling away that we've had with that people that could rehearse doctrines Mandic could preach doctrine some of them some of them when they preach that in no one the world is ever anyhow sounded like a rabbit running around a tree I'm not saying that disrespectful I'm just telling you the truth now maybe somebody else thought they'd and you know maybe they did something good friends I'm not saying it because I judge other ministries I'm just saying I never could make sense of what in the world they were even trying to get to but you know what it's clear it wouldn't reveal to him but what I'm saying is is that even for a person to know doctor and doctor and doctor and doctor induction doesn't mean it's been revealed when it's been revealed it's a life of Christ inside of you people are gonna know all these Ducks out telling you right now there's quotes I could finish when I was way out in the world I didn't could finish him I could tell you I could quote her that wasn't right though I knew him oh to sit down and challenge somebody on serpents eat yeah even when I was out in the world but my life what kind of life did I live at that time see the life did not match but there's got to be a life on the inside life not a lifestyle a life let me hurry up here brought out David he's awareness that this person to blot out my transgressions to wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin David knew God in this way without even having the new birth that you and I have he knew the power of God to be able to wash not God not as a letter a word but he knew you as a person now once you think of this the heart of God here's the heart of God moving in and the heart of God with the tender mercies of God as we bring those two together it not only comes forth to deal with the heart that would bring us to himself but he's not going to recirculate the same old life he's got to be able to cleanse the life he's got to be able to set you in a three the heart and the spleen coming together this is the tender mercy of God hey man were here himself he was able to come on the scene where an animal sacrifice had no soul in it it could not come back upon the worshipper but Christ Himself came and he made his soul and offering for sin in the shedding of his blood his soul was offered up for our sin so that that life might come back upon you and I bring you an eye into that blood cell I'll tell your brother and sister a blood transfusion it brings a change when the heart of God being connected with the heart of God it brings a change it has the power within it this when this Lord Jesus Christ has the power within it to bring about change in a person's life because inside of that blood cell the things of the world cannot remain the Bible says if you love the world or the things of the world the love of God has never entered into your heart what brothers saying I don't smoke I don't drink if you love fussin if you love sighted if you're a filled with bitterness it shows of that you're okay with that and you've always got an or to stick in there is something wrong with your soul its lungs that need to be cleared out it's boulders that need to be removed amen the heart of God the spleen there the tender mercies what is it doing it's cleansing it will not allow the recirculating of damaged blood cells sin cannot dwell in the blood of Jesus Christ sin cannot reside and dwell in the soul of a believer no sir once it has been quickened there's been that birth that has taken place but cleansing you say oh brother Samuel I have problems with this and I have problems with that listen friends there is one who is greater than wall problems that you have but listen don't make excuses for him well my daddy had this my mama had this oh brother Sam you it's just a little lust it's just a little drink once in a while you need to have a real transfusion Paul brother send you you know it's just a little bit of pornography it's just a little bit of this it's just a little bit of that that's not just a little bit if you're making excuses for there needs to be a transfusion not an adding to God can add to your life there's got to be a transfusion and if there's a call for a transfusion there's got to be one present who can actually bring about the necessary change where he can actually give you his life listen friends a person could live above all of those things right there whatever was mentioned can live above all of that and still not with it the question becomes this morning is he your life is he the center of your life what brother saying I love him I didn't ask you that I said is he the center of your life is he your all you know is your delight to please him or would you rather please the bosses more would you rather display yourself before others or be able to display a heart before God where there is a sincere life that's lived before God listen friends it's not knowing all the chapters all the verses and being able to recite that there's many people know how to understand me that are inhale right now this morning that can recite all those things that's not what it's about you miss the life you miss everything let's be clear on this what they thought they needed they felt wrong what they needed was the visitation that was promised a deliverance of themselves I'm telling you this morning you don't have to live where you've been living you don't have to live there he made a way for you that you could live in walk in victory that it's a life that is reflected through you the it's a pulsation of your heart you realize but right now there's times and maybe you've been sitting here and no doubt mine you know my my pulse maybe it's been up over a hundred here well I preached and then other times you know my pulse will rest at forty seven but then in between those times what is it there's different there's movements that's going on it's a pulsation that's calling blood is pumping even when you're just sitting right there even when you're sleeping blood has been pumping through the body you say what are you saying I'm saying whether you're in church or you're out of church you're a Christian you don't matter where you are at on the job or whatever you're a Christian because why you're connected with the heart of God it's God's heart that's pulsating through you what you do you have access to him my little children I rather do you say not but if you sin we have an advocate with Jesus Christ the righteous what is it connected with the propitiation it's taken in that word here you are receiving that word into your life what's he doing you're taking in that word but Simon I don't feel no different now I I really don't feel I don't feel anything at all no you got to let that blood flow you see what happens is the little heart itself will actually reach over there and it will put the left ventricle will put that blood over into the lungs to get it oxygen oxygenated then it will pull that blood back over and send it out down through your body through the right through the right artery there it'll send it out with oxygen in it it sends it out with nutrients in it you realize it's the blood that carries the nutrients it not only carries the oxygen and the nutrients that are needed to every one of our little cells but in those cells is also another place to where on the outside of it they are actually able to dispensed all of the metallic waste that is in a cell and that blood itself begins to take and pack that metallic waste away what's it doing it's taking it back for cleansing now I'm so glad that we are in contact with the very heart of God amen whereby between our lives there is a flow of that blood to do what will being washed by the water you'll be able to wash to be able to take the nutrients to where it needs to go in my life and be able to take away the waste and then all the cells that are there all it might be a damaged cell somebody said something about you somebody thought something about you somebody - damaged cell you know brother Brahma said you got to watch themselves he said then backslidden cells can start a cancer in the church lord have mercy I'm preaching weeks ahead now but it can start a bat it can start a situation but that's why there's got to be blood flow you've got to identify that cancer call it out for what it is and allow what allow the blood the blood stream it will cleanse this is for you this is for me the heart of God brought in contact with this heart not just when I say contact just to come near but come into him into this blood cell to where it's his life so doing it's circulating the blood this is a living living body it's not a dead it's a living body for he said I am the heart I'm divine and ye are the arteries the veins the capillaries the branches where the mem says what that blood all in the heart of God he said setting in the midst of the church he said when the heart of God goes to pumping the blood of God he said Paul Saints through the Church of the Living God it posses pulsation what is it it's God's heartbeat pulsating moving dealing with our life I need you look at God that pulsation Lord God - where there's things that has the blood goes through out of those cells comes things that passes back through and the spleen is right there - says come on come on bring the waste products here I'll take those waste products I'll recycle them I'll turn them around what are you talking about I'll take dirty laundry and make clean laundry out of it I will give you beauty for Ashes the heart of God Christ he who's there with you and I to move upon our lives you love him just make up in your mind make up in your heart right now I'm not gonna live beneath my privileges brother Samuel I believe I've been born again but make up in your mind I'm making up in my mind I'm not gonna live beneath my privileges Samuel sometimes I feel like I get certain pains or certain this a certain that well you've been eating knowing you eat the wrong things it clogs eat the right things you know unclogging they're right the heart of God and let me tell you something his heart is for you that God would come and speak to our hearts in this way brother Branham addresses it to a group of people in conference with God he said when you sitting there and saying oh brother Branham God can do without me he said oh oh no God can't do without you he came all the way he put his heart in it he didn't come just haphazardly he put his heart and he just didn't put his heart in it his heart all that God was he poured into Christ all the Christ was he poured into the church the heart of God or Jesus I've done Lord I spoke Lord those things that you placed on my heart but father we stand here our lives are touched this morning I I don't know Lord what depth are degreed with it any harder in any life but I pray Lord Jesus may this simplicity Lord of the thoughts itself come forth they we examine ourselves not in doubt but examine our lives examine our walk if we're not walking where we ought to be may we Lord God take and receive from you this morning the tender mercy that would speak to us and call us to the walk of where we're supposed to be walking [Music] or do you know the needs that are here among us Lord I believe with all of my heart Lord your heart Lord is here with us Jesus

something you were going through maybe you've lost the joy of the salvation of the Lord out of your life but you believe this morning you can go back in your mind you say I remember I remember when I had joy if you can remember what you've had then it shows where you are and it shows God's grace is able to take you right back there you have a desire first of all to see where you are and to see where you want to get back to maybe this morning in the word of looking at this year with John you look into it and you say Lord I'm looking at your word but in my heart everything that's around me Lord I realize that even though setting here in services or reading but yet I'm really not turned in the way that I need to be turned I'm not hearing things the way that I I need to hear it turning Lord God or Jesus if there's someone here this morning Lord that does not know you I would not want to let this time go by I don't know Lord sometimes I look across I see different faces sometimes Lord as long as I would have my glasses on and sometimes Lord I I don't know Lord where people are at but I don't say it because of that I say God because it burns on my heart I don't want nobody to miss it Lord father not just someone who would be here but North God I wouldn't want anyone not even if someone Lord that would think the lowest of me I won't want nobody to miss it I wanted to make it more our pray Lord God that this morning Lord Jesus may that word Lord as it's been spoken may it go forth moving upon their hearts Lord and if there's a desire to say I want to go on with the Lord may they look Lord see where they're at and may they yield to you Lord if there's lord habits if there's things in the life Lord God the Lord it seems like it's things and just reoccurring and reoccurring and reoccurring Lord I'm not talking about a trap I'm talking about sin that's just lay there god I pray this morning may they recognize that there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins where sinners plunged beneath this blood lose all their guilty stains met there is a liberating power Lord God your life can move right down Lord in through that life Lord and set them free Liberty to the uttermost granite Lord this morning Lord my heart my hands are up before you lord I don't want Lord God the flow of that blood to be restricted I don't want it to be restricted in me I don't want it to be restricted in this assembly Lord because the Lord what you have delivered to us in this hour is yourself your heart Lord God to think Lord of that bride that you have been building bringing forth down through the ages that bride that as the Prophet could say that you took that rib right up next to Adams heart and that match peace the Lord would come back together the flow of that life Lord flowing through us Lord I pray God cleanse us Lord renew us Lord by the Holy Ghost let the flow of the holy spirit Lord let it just flow the Lord God moving over Lord God as that blood would move Lord into the lungs and become oxygenated Lord and bring Lord that oxygen that is from this atmosphere and bring it into the body Oh God has the Spirit of God brings
