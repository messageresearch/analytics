tonight Heavenly Father Lord we come before you Lord as we stand behind this sacred desk and Lord we approach it with all the reverence that we have dear God realizing God where we stand in the importance of it dear God in the seriousness and soberness of it and we just ask dear God that you'll guide us now through your word Lord help me to yield to you Lord to where you can come and Speak Lord for you have the words Lord that will lift the people up that will encourage them Lord and give instruction we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and to the glory of God Amen if you could turn with me in your Bibles to Luke chap 18 verse 8 I just want to read a portion of that verse nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on Earth you may be seated this reference of Faith here is not to personal faith it is a reference to belief in the whole body of the revealed truth amen 1 Corinthians 1613 it says watch you stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong Stand Fast in the faith 2 Corinthians 135 says examine yourselves whether you be in the faith prove your own selves know you not your own selves how that Jesus Christ is in you except you be reprobates Colossians 1:23 says if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under Heaven whereof I Paul am a minister 2 Timothy 3:1 said this know also in the last days perilous times shall come he speaking about apostasy apostasy is falling away or it is the act of professed Christians who deliberately reject the revealed truth right turn with me if you would to Amos chapter 8 Amos chapter 8 and verse 11 and 12 verse 11 says behold the days come sayeth the Lord that I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of of hearing the words of the Lord and they shall Wander from sea to Sea and from North even to the East and they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it brother bam says in the curtain of time he said just today I was reading the little place of scripture in Amos 811 and he says if that doesn't fit this nation at this time I don't know where it does fit that's right we don't need bread we got plenty of it we got plenty to eat plenty of clothes to wear nice homes to live in and everything but there's a famine for the hearing of the word of God a man won't know what to believe that's right you're all confused one says this one says that one says this and one says something else base your thoughts on thus sayith the Lord God will confirm it we are living in a Time of apostasy yes we're living in a time of a falling away those that have sojourned with us there's many of them that have turned their back on the revealed truth but that shouldn't Shake us because the scripture says that would take place so when we see those things happening we should Stand Fast in the faith amen Hallelujah not wavering and another thing is don't listen to what they have to say don't read what they write they've got this stuff all over the Internet against the message of the hour the revealed truth don't read it that's right because there are spirits that has caused them to write that base brother Ram said base your thoughts on thus saith the [Applause] Lord the voice of God in this last days brother brandham said and God has promised to meet the need of the hour he always does that we need the voice of God today to meet the need of the hour to meet the time we're living in and after he's promised it we can rest assure that he will keep keep his promise that's the confidence that the believer has in his maker that he promised to meet the need and today one reason the church is in the condition it's in is because there's so many voices so many other voices to attract the church from the voice of god Till It's very doubtful that many would hear the voice of God though it spoke right in their midst they perhaps wouldn't even understand it because if would be a foreign thing to them they've got themselves so much centered on the voices of today there are so many voices and if we notice in our scripture reading the voice of God was foreign to them he's talking about during the time of Eli and when Samuel came as a young boy and remember how that the Lord the god visited uh Samuel and spoke to him and remember he went to Eli Eli told him said go back and lay down see if he'll speak to you again and he says the voice of God was foreign to them and it's become that way again today the voice of God there's so many other voices and then if God promised to give us that and if other voices are contrary to the voice of God then it must be the voice of our enemy to confuse us that we would would not understand the voice of God when it spoke you want answers the answers are in the word you want answers for today they're in the message you're not going to go and find them in books in the library you're not going to find them down at your local bookstore the psychologists of today don't have the answers it's good enough for those that are just people that are wanting to do better or live a moral life or whatever they go by those things but we're looking for more than that that's right there's more than just being a good person there's more than just you know just being a good moral person there's more to it than that there's more to just going to church and professing to be a Christian right we've got to not only hear the truth but we've got to let the truth manifest through US amen that's right yes Lord as the times grow darker the light of the Bride grows stronger so many voices in the Earth today that it's absolutely a hard thing because it deadens the voice of the supernatural and hear his voice he says but there's so many voices today that it takes the voice of the Lord away from us now how how does what is it these voices have that if you listen to them they can sound reasonable because what they're relying on is human reasoning and that's how the enemy would like to trap us to get us to approach it through reasoning but keep this in mind what I read he said base your thoughts on thus sayeth the Lord not on reasoning there are those they contest whether the uh what brother brandham talked about happened with the bridge and the lives that were lost and him seeing that vision and that happened there son said all that never happened how do they know were they [Applause] there because because they interviewed a man whose mother was alive and saw it that's true and he was just a boy when it happened so somebody was there and saw it right what about the cloud it was up higher than a cloud could even exist and there was a picture taken of it now you say do you how do you know where the random was caught up in there by faith he said it and I believe him it doesn't have to be scientifically explained because the Supernatural is not scientific the supernatural goes beyond scientific understanding what about John said I was caught up on the Lord's day do they believe that the voice of God in this last days he says there's so many voices so many confused things the people get up and they don't know the word and they say things and maybe it sounds very reasonable he said communism is a reasonable thing everybody the same there's no more capitalists they're all Communists you ever stop and think that that's a false Revival communism is what did he pattern it after Jesus said the two Spirits would be so close he would deceive the elect if possible and everything the devil's got it's a perversion of what God created right sin is righteousness perverted lie is the truth misrepresented adultery is an act that God ordained to us perverted all unbelief is the perversion of belief you have to deny the truth in order to take the perversion see straighten out these voices test them by the word and see if it's truth right I remember years ago there was different ones that would travel around visiting this church visiting that church and we had some of them in our home when I was growing up and they would come around with their version of the message and they would sit and try to convince my dad of their version of the message right but it didn't line up with the word that's right right there was one man that he come across my family's path and later I found out that my associate pastor brother Phil who's actually from Indiana his come across his in his family's path and the man what the man was saying was you don't have to go to church no more we just we'll just gather Fellowship in our home and listen to the tapes we don't need the fivefold ministry no more brother Phil's family his dad followed it brother Phil's a miracle but he was raised around that and come up like he is praise God but when I met him he seemed to be so confused by things but gradually the voice of God straightened out all the [Applause] confusion the proof of his resurrection brother ramam says 2third of the world have never heard about Jesus or the resurrection but brother when when the emus experience come to caas when their eyes were open and they recognized who they were in a few minutes time they traveled down the corridors of time back to Jerusalem lightf footed light-hearted telling people we know our Lord is risen from the dead for we have seen him and we know that he is real hallelujah what is it is the last days God's going to raise men with messages with power with deliverance and with the power of the Gospel to prove that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I believe this has been fulfilled I believe it's being fulfilled he says I know it sounds excitable no wonder we're living in an exciting time we are living in an exciting time it's a perilous time but for the bride of Christ it is a glorious time because we're living in the dime of the coming of the lord we are watching prophecy be fulfilled amen amen glory and you know as Jesus resurrected there was more prophecy fulfilled in th that amount of time than what had been fulfilled all during his ministry there was so much just happened and I believe that we're at that time and I believe that it will it can all just start falling into place and happen so quickly and I believe and it happening so quickly there won't be time for stragglers to turn around and say wait a minute maybe I've been going the wrong way course I don't believe they will anyhow it's a hard thing but those that are deceived were ordained to be deceived but the elect of God cannot be deceived Hallelujah amen it said it would deceive the very elect if possible but it's not possible it just said it would be so close and I believe things that we've saw over just the past recent years of the falling way of people that we can see how that it's so close why because it came right out of our Mist we're living in an exciting time yes we're living in the last day when God through every holy prophet through all the Old Testament through the New Testament has prophesied that in the end time the same things took place in the beginning would happen in the end time and as the Darkness would Fleet away the Gospel Light will shine across the corridors of the earth once more before the coming of the Lord he is risen from the dead he's the same yesterday today and forever Jesus Christ raised from the dead and is living among us I'm so happy for that my heart is thrilled beyond words when we don't have to guess about it amen we're not guessing whether this is true or not it's been Vindicated yes and I'll I'll show you SE the Antichrist he said men come in the anointed of the Holy Spirit they preach everything that's within them and the people walk right away as if nothing ever happened just unconcerned now there's got to be a reason for that and if you'll study this this tells what the reason is do you know the scripture says there would be a time in the last days where there be a famine strike the land not for bread or water but for hearing of the word of the Lord there's not a famine of the word of the Lord but there's a famine for the hearing of the word of the Lord he said that these ministers would preach their hearts out and people would just walk away from it voice of God in the last days he said Moses heard the voice of God he was full of theology he knowed all the ins and outs but it failed and he heard the voice of God and Moses was never the same and no man is never the same you might hear in your ears the voice speaking but when you hear in your heart the voice speaking see then you're hearing you do not see with your eye you look with your eye you see with your heart you see something say I don't see it you mean you don't understand it you do not hear with your ears you hear with your heart many times your ears hear the true voice of God and it falls off you like water off a duck's back but when you really hear you hear with your heart that's where the famine for hearing is they hear with their ears but they don't hear with their heart why brother Rams I often go back to this brother Ram said what was the difference in the woman at the well remember when Jesus went there he said I have a need to go by Samaria and he told that woman her life remember that he said if you know who you were talking to you'd ask me for a drink and I would give you a drink and you'd never thirst again and she said I perceive thou art a prophet she re there was something in her that recognized brother said what was difference between that woman and the priest down at the temple who was calling belah yes sir he said it was she had representation there was something in her that could hear the word of the Lord there was something in her that can hear the voice of God speaking why are you where you're at today because there's something in you that can hear the voice of God lord [Applause] that's where the difference is at do you know your theophany body already [Applause] exists it's not something yet to be created brother Bram said when you hear this message and recognize it to be Eagle food you have heard from your [Applause] theophany this is again the same message the voice of God in the last days he said in spite of these impersonations false voices false prophets all these other things that's Rising rising up Jesus still said in spite of all this if any man will hear my voice and follow me he is the word listen his commission to us today in all these voices which I said it would take hours to bring out all these voices and it's confusing to the people it's a pathetic thing and after all you don't get a second chance you got to take it now you might not get a chance tonight you might get you might not get a chance tomorrow it's now when you hear my voice Harden not your hearts as in the days of the provocation now is the time this is the acceptable time that if any man will hear my voice that goes to show his voice will still be there in the midst of all the chaos he still got a voice voice why his voice will ever remain it said heavens and earth will pass away but my voice shall not pass away his word in the midst of all the chaos his voice is still there and there's still a people that are are hearing that voice there is a people that have shutting their ears to all the voices of today all the other voices I don't care what they've got to say I don't care what their thoughts are I don't care their about their opinions when I get in the pull pit I'm not bringing you my opinion I'm bringing you to the revealed word of God so I don't want to hear their opinions everyone's got opinions I don't have time to waste I'm getting ready to [Applause] leave I've got my thoughts centered on where am I at in the faith I've got my thoughts centered on standing fast I've got my thoughts centered on taking inventory of myself because I want to be ready to go when he comes Hallelujah Lord these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils there's the word they shall speak with new tongues take up serpents that would not harm them if they drink deadly things it would not bother them if they lay their hands on the sick they Shout recover and you watch these things plus all the rest of the scripture put together now that alone will not confirm it not at all that's where Pentecostal get on the wrong road did not Jesus say many will come to me in that day and say Lord have not I done Mighty things in your name have not I prophesied your name have not I done all this in your name and Jesus said depart from me you that work iniquity I never knew you that's right it's to know Christ there's something that changes in your life watch your life and pattern it with the word and see where you're at taking inventory certainly what what is the proof there's been a change and eternal change has took place on the inside something changed us it's not a turning over of a new Leaf it's not trying on a new religion it's not just trying to be a moral person but there's something that's changed what is it that's changed us it's the voice of God that has changed us that's how we know it's the voice of God am brought about a changing us like it did Moses brought about a changing us like it did Joseph yes sir brought about a changing us just like it did John when John heard the voice it changed him they took and throw John out onto the aisle of patmas cuz they couldn't kill any all the ways they tried to kill him that wasn't successful so they throwed him out there in the aisle of patmas and brother brandom said that was exactly where God wanted him at so no matter what gets thrown at you you're going to end up exactly where God wants [Applause] you you know people are afraid to change many times people are afraid to change we we as humans we get so used to something being a certain way we get to be afraid of change but there is a change coming that you don't need to be afraid [Applause] of hallelu we've we've received a change spiritually in our souls turn with me to 1 Corinthians 15 verse starting at verse 51- [Music] 58 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the Trump shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed I'm not afraid of that change amen I'm waiting for that change I like that song I used to sing years ago there's been a change in me amen I'm not the man I used to be I don't go to the places I used to go I don't do the things I used to do why there's been a change brother ROM says there first must be a spiritual Resurrection before you could ever have a natural Resurrection yes sir and I'm saying there first must be a spiritual change before you can have this change for this corruptible must put on incorruption this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall be put on incorruption and this Mortal shall put on in IM mortality then shall be brought to pass as saying it is written death is swallowed up in Victory oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved Brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord 2 Corinthians chapter 3 verse 17 18 now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty you believe that yeah I know you believe it because there's a liberty to preach here yes but we all with open face beholding as in the glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord that's the change that's taking place now in our life Lord sir we're waiting for what I mentioned before about the change of this body what is it that changes it the word of God but it's not through some magical no pain way God always proves his sons he always proves his children he'll put you in situations see what you'll do that's right you say is he really want he knows what you're going to do but he wants to watch it it's like giving a kid a new bike here recently my youngest son who's here with us tonight sitting somewh where he uh there he is that's William on his 15th birthday we bought him a brand new bicycle and when he came out we took it out of the back of the truck he act like he could hardly believe his eyes he was so excited about it I knew he was going to be excited and I knew what he was going to do with it but I still wanted to watch him do it when we took it down out of the truck I wanted to watch him ride that bike I wanted to see him happy with it and I wanted to see what he would do with the big hill we lived on that was a test going down that hill in the gravel and things God will put you he'll allow circumstances right just to see what you'll do not for him to discover what you'll do but for him to watch what you're going to do he knows his children until we reflect his life in every situation and Circumstance no matter how we're treated by others that's that's how long it'll go on and God's not a one-dimensional god he's a multi-dimensional God he can do more than one thing at a time God can take one situation and teach five different people from one situation God can take one happening and affect the lives of many people that's right right he can God can take this person and let them affect a somebody who will in turn affect someone else with what with friends when we gather together here we're drawing strength from one another our faith we link our faith together remember brother Brandon mention said there's such a bank of faith in this place all things are possible I believe that tonight I know you believe I can feel your faith hallah all things work together for the good of them that love the Lord what things all things there's nothing that takes place what God doesn't allow [Music] it and God is allowing this testing this shaking he's allowing this apostasy to run wild why because it's to shake loose everything that can be shook why because we're getting ready to leave [Music] here and only the elect can go Noah preached to everyone that's right but he built the ark to house eight wow not because that was in his own thinking but because that was the instructions of God but he still went on and preached like everyone could be saved because they could it wasn't a something false if they would have believed they could have been saved but God knowed who would and who wouldn't and there's a good old gospel ship that's getting ready to leave amen and I'll tell you what there's only room on it for the elect in Noah's time there was just enough room on the ark for the elect and that's the way it is in this day so God is shaking loose everything that is not the elect of God that's one of the things that they hate too they hate that word election they say oh the elite they don't believe in that Elite Doctrine well I'm sorry the Bible testifies of [Applause] election Paul all quoting what the voice of God said through the old prophets said was it not written that Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated before either boy was born that the election of God might stand sure how can you do away with something that's that clear in the Bible right change you know when I think of that I always think of that story brother Brown tells about that crow that had been caught and been chained up and it could only hop out around so far as where the chain would let it hop he said one day they let It Off the Chain but the crow would only still just hop so far as the chain had allowed him to hop why he didn't know he was free but I'm telling you tonight you know you're free hallelu we've been set free you Lord Jesus Hallelujah and I'll tell you what I love the opportunities that God gives us God gives us opportunities to show love he gives us opportunities to have faith I believe that it was brother Tim puit one time I heard say that sickness is just an opportunity to be healed [Applause] it's an opportunity for Divine Healing and we're promised that amen be not soon shaking the Bible says and we won't be we're living in a great time wonderful time amen hallelujah hallelujah amen God bless you brother same God Amen let's stand amen you love the Lord tonight amen hallelujah amen thank you Lord I tell you thank God for for his voice amen thank God for his voice you know when you look at how that the Lord just just really speaking to our hearts here tonight you know the Bible says he said beloved try every Spirit whether it be of God Amen and when you listen to it you hear things all around things that come even from internally that things are spoken things that can even be they use the quotes of the message to cloak but you know the spirit of God will never back something that's off never the holy spirit will always stay with the word amen and he said I'll bring to remembrance whatsoever I have said amen God always V indicates his word amen so it it's just as God if we thank God because the reality is is that God's voice it'll always stay with the same pattern of the word we don't give preeminence no matter who it comes from it must come and line itself with the word of God is that right because when we look at the message that God has sent to us in this hour it is the voice of God personally to us so when we hear those things it's just like what was spoken here those voices are very strong even that are around right now there's Gatherings going on that you you don't need Ministry anymore if if ministers don't play it in the pullit you're deuses that's error that's error the truth of the of of the reality is is that we've never stopped with brother Brandon being in the pool we preach from the message of the hour Hallelujah we do what we have been commissioned to do by the spirit of almighty God and God is having his way amen we want to be sensitive to his voice we want to see that that word just moving in our lives transforming us amen is God having his wonderful way don't you love him amen just Lord you know it's just like within it all Lord to me I just want to be simple I want to just take it in and I want to live by the word of God of what God has spoken amen this is this is not this is not a Doctrine to us it is him this is Christ it is our life when Noah built the ark that was an expression of what God had revealed to him it was not something he did on the side it was his life so everything that Noah did when Noah had a decision to make it was how is this going to affect the construction of the Ark yes how is that going to affect anything see because what the ark that was Christ the center of the Revelation so it was the center of Noah's life so it gave that's what gave meaning to why did Noah do certain things is because everything came back to how is this going to affect the ark it's the same thing with Moses same thing with each of that's why when this word as it's truly personally revealed to our hearts it's Christ it's the person of Jesus Christ that's what the message is it's the token to us personally and it is our life we're not just looking and talking about the coming of the Lord we're living for the coming of the Lord he is our life all that we do oh oh my may God continue to help us and continue to change us if there's anything at all Lord that needs to be rubbed out rub it out Lord that we are found ready if there's anything that would make me dull of hearing it all rub it out Lord if there's any other voices anything else all around let's just let it be shut
