before your throne Lord in the midst Lord of this service and father we've opened this service Lord with one desire Lord and that's oh God that as we would Lord begin to worship you and thank you Father for your mercies and your goodness for your care Lord Upon Our Lives for your leadership Lord we have we have come here tonight with Lord a praise within our hearts Lord father yet how what a paradox it is Lord that here we can come with a praise in our hearts and sometimes Lord we come with very heavy hearts at the same time with Lord needs and things that Lord that lay before us and dear God may be Lord of even presently Lord pressures and decisions that Lord that we need your leadership [Music] Lord that's what we value more than our own thoughts more than our own opinions Lord in our own thoughts and our own opinions there is no there's no peace but father it's Lord through your word it brings peace into our lives Lord this is why Lord that even you would say in your word time and time again that he that would keep his mind stayed on me I will keep him in a perfect peace Lord would you help us tonight Lord God if there be any minds or any hearts Lord any heaviness Lord that's Among Us father you're here to minister to our needs Lord thank you Lord father may you come Lord tonight and once again like you took that little lad's lunch Lord father you brought forth from there when it was in your hands and Lord we just certainly want to place our lives in your hands we want to place God every word Lord into your hands and ask that God in our being that Lord may we be guided Lord not only to say father to speak the word of God but Lord also anointed to hear it Lord and to receive it so Lord I ask that God that you would be with us now forgive us Lord of our shortcomings father Lord we ask tonight for your mercies Lord to come Among Us Lord for every need that's gathered here Lord we need you father we just invite you to have your perfect will in this service Lord we commit ourselves Lord into your hands now asking it all for your glory in Jesus name amen amen God bless you tonight if you would uh turn with me to job 2 26 I want to go right back into that that portion of the word that we were looking at there before I want to say what a blessing this past weekend was and uh I know the previous week was such a great blessing too with brother Nathan and brother uh Alexander and I certainly didn't get to um thank you the way that I wanted to when we had service here on Friday night but I certainly want to say thank you for your prayers while we were gone that previous week to uh Arizona and uh God gave us strength to be able to navigate through all the meetings and the services and the Lord just he had his way and that's that's what that's what our desire is and I to me it's always a comfort to know there's people back home that's praying for me amen because we we're together in this and um my wife and I we did when I I flew in there we flew in on got in on Tuesday evening evening and there's a few things that I had to kind of make a decision and I had made a decision that I wanted to go down to Tucson uh because there uh I wanted to go in some of those places where brother brandham went and so uh I got to see some of those it was a busy time but it was worth it was worth it so uh we hiked up I got to hike up to Eagle Rock and I get up there and uh my wife and I and it just was such a blessing to me those are it's a precious this time and so uh even within that I told my wife as we had to then make a 5 and 1 half hour trip up to Phoenix and it end up being a long trip unbeknownst to us uh president Trump had come into Phoenix and I thought why is this taken Phoenix is already a big city and they're hard to get around and I thought why is this taking us forever you know forgive me just a little bit of my Humanity because we were just way out and after we get on past it my wife said honey she said I think she said there's president's Trump's having a w in there and I thought oh my no wonder they shut down freeways and but we made it up there and you know I we were a little tired but I said you know it's been worth it I just you know some of those places like that I just I appreciate that God would give us Grace to uh to see them and for me I you know I don't I would share the pictures with you but I'll get preaching on it and there's times that that will come from those places I I sat there and just Gathering inspiration as from Eagle Rock as we were there and you're seeing places that was uncovered and um that was previously hidden and I I just to me it's just it's just a lot that I could say in there but I know God will give us Grace at some time to bring those things out and so I don't mean to keep you standing I just wanted to share my our expressed our gratitude and thanks for your prayers while we were gone and um so we just uh we love you in the Lord and I was so happy to get back home though when we got back home and after the last meeting was over I was ready I told my wife as said I'm ready to go right now I'm ready to go she said we can catch a Redeye flight and you know let's just go you know but uh we also got to see in the lar last night we were there as we drove down to Phoenix and we got to visit with brother and sister walker uh we're there right there in Phoenix now and you probably remember them from when they were here you know he's a podiatrist and things and so we got a chance to fellowship with them uh a little bit later that evening but um anyhow we thank God for his Mercy and man just so thankful for the word of the Lord and how God has ministered to us as his children amen don't you didn't you appreciate brother Homer I mean my goodness for for being 80 years old my my you know I to me brother Homer is an oak tree I just like setting up underneath you know and uh so we just we really enjoyed it was certainly a blessing and a benefit to the church and uh he told me he sent me a text he said now don't you make me look bad on Thursday I said well here's what we'll do I said maybe I can make the baloney sandwich seem as good as the steak dinners but uh uh we just we just have a little bit of fun back and forth but anyhow we just we were we were edified as a as a people and I thank God for that amen job 26 verse one but job answered and said how hast thou help him that is without power and how savest thou the arm that hath no strength and how hast thou counseled him that hath no wisdom and how hast thou plentifully rewarded the thing as it is to whom hast thou uttered words and whose Spirit came from thee amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated also want to remind you of the Fellowship dinner here this coming Sunday brother Aaron did you need me to make any more announcements or anything nothing okay um so those onion sister Caroline I waited all Sunday evening for them brother Ray didn't give you the address my goodness see give me change text now or something no but anyhow um sorry about if there was the confusion but I we just want to look we look forward forward to that just a little time to come together and have fellowship and with one another and uh friends that's very important in the body that's something is very very important and so um we just certainly value that very much and um I like the food that you cook but I'll be honest with you if I did not if it was all gone by the time I got up there I would be happy that we were able to come together and I mean that there's been there's been times when we had at the Depot and you know I had just there was little little things to pick from but my heart was so happy a lot of times that I didn't get a chance to eat till later on that evening but I was I mean you know he got little things here and there and uh but anyhow I I really mean that with all my heart um so I want to just speak on this uh once again tonight Brianna if you'll go ahead and kick it over for me here I want to go ahead and speak on this once again tonight and how the Lord has just um really press this these thoughts here upon our heart on being a help uh to the body and I want to just say it you know really u in this way when we look at it that really um the only way that we can really be a help is is when we're really drawing from the Lord as we should and Satan's desire is always constantly to try to um drag us out and you know hinder us and uh want to get us down and and I'll just say it like this throughout the assembly there's times that we all uh face or are in different uh Seasons sometimes even in our own lives we're in a season as an assembly and then churches go through seasons and then as individuals and so we're not always all I mean can you imagine if the whole assembly if everybody was down at the same time but see God God knows even as we're going through tests and trials and where we're at I that that that's be on my pig grate to figure that out I I don't try to but I just know that God he is Mindful and and it's him that's ministering through the body so it's not it's not us and and I say it in this way because when we're thinking of this of being a help to the body with that question in mind how are you helping the body and you know it's like this that a person that if if you're not drawing strength from the Lord then then we really can't be we have no strength to give out we've got to be drawing there's got to be a source that we're drawing from and that's that's the real key because we can get in our mind that I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that I'm going to be a help here but the reality and I think that's wonderful to have objectives and and everything but I I'll just say it like this that as we stay in God's presence and really that staying in God's presence doesn't mean that us staying locked up in a prayer closet somewhere it just means being in tune and in fellowship with God you can be in Fellowship I I believe in our time and stealing away in prayer but I believe that it where Paul would say praying always so if we're praying always there's no way that you can stay in your prayer closet 24 hours out of the day but we can stay in a state of prayer we and with staying in a state of prayer it it there's a sensitivity that comes to where that God will speak to us God can move to influence and direct our lives and and and lead us and it also helps us to be able as we're there in fellowship with him to be able to look Beyond even our own needs and and the conditions that we're surrounded with that would be one of the admonitions not only that Paul would give but one of the things that Paul said that you would fulfill my joy that you would be likeminded and look not every man on his own things but on the things of others and and I think many times that even when we look at the complexities of life and and physical uh emotional spiritual I mean you know for you and I to stand here tonight the Mount of devils that you have had to fight through to set right here tonight uh it's it's just throughout the week and you know you know the whole purpose within it is that Satan doesn't care how many times that he has witnessed you press right on through that he still he can't understand that but he he will still come and he'll try to hinder because Satan knows the power of the word as it comes upon the hearts and lives of the believer that it can actually give you an eye and it does the strength to actually begin to look beyond our circumstance and to believe God for all things he he he knows that when I say he knows that because he has watched You and I by God's grace in our life that it's just unexplainable how when we've walked into a service and then you leave out of a service and there has been such a supernatural touch from God that maybe the words themselves it wasn't word by word but it was just being in God's presence that has so uh moved within our hearts to look Beyond uh the situations and the conditions that we were in and I'm telling you that God not only has done it once but he'll continue to do that to minister the help that you and I have need of and there's many many many many different ways that help can be ministered to like when we look here in this scripture that word help means to sucur uh it means to help or support one and there's many different ways that we can do that and ways that how that the Holy Spirit would lead us to do it so we always want to be sensitive to the leading of the Holy Spirit and I coming back I guess to a a point within it is that how when I begin to just just meditating on these things I I've been going through you know different messages and just meditating on you know that the seeing the value of of living behind the veil and how that Satan's desire is always just to get us clouded up and I don't believe that that any one of us would just um uh I want to say on purpose look Beyond somebody else's need or just Overlook people I don't believe that that that is something that we would do but I believe sometimes we can become a lack of awareness because of where of where the the situations and things of life to where we sometimes just feel like that you know what I'm doing good enough just to take care of me I mean it's true yeah exactly I mean you know i' I've been in those I feel like yeah I'm just just doing good enough just to take care of me and that Satan's desire is to keep us in that Realm because listen friends the Holy Spirit when it's come it you are ordained to be a vessel that he would Express himself through there's many ways that God will Express himself he will Express and display his life through you you and I we are ordained to be as channels God help us to be aware because that's what eternal life is all about it's it's living for others is that right I I I mean these are things that you know in this age that we're in that if Paul would have to admonish us as Believers and I believe he would write it for this day CU he says as you see those days approaching even the more so what assemble yourselves together knowing of the pressures and the conditions that would be present but it's a time to press beyond that and I'm just going to say it like this that God has not called you and I to become robots but it's to live in his presence and to realize that's the value of everything about our life that puts everything in perspective he is the source listen psalms 27 verse1 is a great key it's the very chapter that the Holy Spirit led the prophet to take for the message the Rapture and it is that the Lord is the strength of my life that that that's it right there don't we we don't want the enemy to try to tell us we need to do this or we need to do that but if I can just stay lined up with him and under his influence then God himself will see that my footsteps are ordered in the right way he will help me to be sensitive that at any time he can drop a word my way he can he can use me as an instrument as a tool that's available for himall now let me just refresh our memory here on this this I want to just this this quote I read last week and or about three weeks ago now but brother BR said I'm so glad to know that he can be found amongst the Brokenhearted in our sorrows he's not one that would leave us he stands by us when all has failed and the last hopes of Earthly reaching has come to its end he is still God and he loves us he was he was the the expressing of God and the prophet said oh how I believe that he Longs for his people to be so Anointed with his spirit that we could go to each other in trials in troubles and give the expression of his sympathy I mean I you know there's sympathy that I can have with someone else or even empathy if I've not been through it but you know notice what's called here is that to give his sympathy to somebody else Lord help me to be that sensitive now I know that sometimes we look at these things like this and think man that's not that powerful and that Dynamic if what you mean is that is something that is not illustrious it's not something that is on on the pull pit it's not something that is a show it's not something that everybody would be signing up as far as to do then yes you're exactly right but you see that's exactly how God works in his body that's why you know years and years ago when we spoke on the gifts many times where when individuals say where are the gifts in the church if they'll really be honest what they're asking for is where is the gift of tongues which is the least of them all is that right it's looking for something that well we need to see something here and yet to think about it that the gifts themselves they operate within every l local body but the difference is they are never to be advertised or to be purported up that I've done this or I've done that because God won't share his glory with nobody as a matter of fact when that little mother when here she was in that in that meeting and she got on her heart to pray for that that that child that that mother had and she just she tried to get away from it tried to get away from it and finally she walked up and she said would you mind if I prayed for your little daughter she said now listen after I pray for her you still keep your prayer card you go right in the line and so here she prayed for her now you know we've referred to this many times she comes on the platform and the angel of the Lord moves down and the prophet said well I see your little girl was sick but but God touched her out there when that sister prayed for her and brother brandom said it just like this he said what it was he said is the compassion of that mother was able to touch God more than if it would have been me hall now nobody would have known that nobody would have known that but God called it out you know I believe God Called It Out for Samuel brownie I believe God called it out for you and I because he will not forget your work and labor of love when there is no desire for any Earthly credit the desire the only thing we want to see I want to see lives better when I go somewhere I want to see lives lifted up I want to see them encouraged is that all right I don't want to see lives torn down if I'm invited to come in and Minister a service I don't want to tear a church up that's not the desire the spirit is is that it would be edified it would be lifted up in Christian love it don't mean that sometimes God won't speak words that might correct us here or there but yet at the same time even when you go into your local supermarket I do not want to leave that worse than when I came in hello I want to be an encouragement to somebody else because our kind words might be the only kind words that they would ever hear you remember years ago when brother Daryl Ward was doing one of our meetings in May and he gave the testimony of how that here was a man and this this wasn't even among I don't believe among even Believers but here was a man and here he was you know homeless and conditions and whatever more and here he was he was sitting right outside of Dunkin Donuts well anyhow I won't make no comment there but he was sitting right outside there uh you know and here he was sitting out there and and someone be to just have a little feeling on their heart and they went over and they actually provided for him uh uh you know something to eat and something to drink he turned around and wrote on the receipt and left it on their table when he left and said thank you for your kindness because today I was ready to take my own life see who would think Donuts Dunkin Donut coffee I mean who would think but it wasn't the donuts it wasn't the coffee are you hearing me it wasn't that it was that expression of kindness I I wonder how deep that went to where he was able to look Beyond and say wait a minute where I think there's no use nothing going on I don't know what had happened in the man's life I don't know what kind of luck that he had fallen on but I know one thing that God laid it upon somebody's heart to do something for him to encourage him amen hallelujah wow how did we get here but notice go to each other in trials and in troubles and give the expression of his sympathy as it pours prise God from our heart see see that fellowship with him is where that enrich comes in our life you know brother Ram describes that human heart he said it's like a a bowl of golden oil called love remember in the Tabernacle in the wilderness they had to replenish that oil you see this is why that there's one feeling with many many ref feelings amen this is why the refilling of the holy spirit this is something that we don't have to wait well I have to wait till the next camp or I have to why to wait you can have a refilling every day of your life and that's really that's the strength that's what helps us that's what keeps us from being prickly that's what helps us to be sensitive and actually have the sympathy that God himself has toward us that when I was when I was lost he found me when I was down and out he picked me up you see sometimes we get away no wonder God would write it over and over in the book of Deuteronomy for them to remember where he brought them from oh God help us as it pours from our hearts that's been born of his Spirit to reflect in the church the love of the Living God you love himen amen now notice you know there's many different ways as I said here moments ago there's many ways to give help right and the ways when we want to give help to someone that is without strength there's many different ways that that that can be done or or one that is without power just no might there's something that's just you know there's a need that's there now remember job is speaking these things because those that have come to him his friends they didn't mean to do job harm they didn't mean to do that I I I don't believe that I I believe they had the best intentions but remember as we looked at there a few weeks ago what it was was missing was discernment they had no discernment as one writer calls it he says these guys were like eye surgeons trying to perform heart surgery they they in other words they had they may have had look some of the things they said were actually word they were word we we've went over that here within the previous years they were words but it actually was not in the right season and it wasn't applied correctly oh I thank God for his mercies in this hour not only did God send you and I a word but the same holy spirit that has sent this message is the same holy spirit that will give you and I the unction of the season and the hour that we're living in I'm many knows you can testify of it that even when we're at right here in 2024 there has been an advancement in the message of the hour We're Not beyond the message of the hour but the message has become more clear Christ has become more real and we are seeing ourselves more clearly than we've ever seen ourselves before what is it there's an advancement hall hallelu hallelujah so with in this this is God God comes in a way to help you and I I I think how God would do it in such a way he would give something to help you and I like brother Ram talked about that man he said that here he comes he said and he walks up to a man who's a roofer and he's nailing down the shingles with a hammer he said now if he comes up to him with that nail gun nail gun and he tells him you don't know nothing get out of the way he said that man probably won't receive it he said but if you'll just say my What a Wonder ful job you're doing no doubt he is doing a good job he's doing it for a living but he says then ask him have you ever seen one of these things right here he said it it might be able to help you he said I'll tell you what I'll do I'll just leave it with you brother BR said see it ain't nothing wrong with the product we have the Holy Ghost he said sometimes it's our presentation of the product we have I tell you listen friends if there's we've got the real Holy Ghost it ought to be a product that we can leave with someone you say what do you mean by that I mean to where that when we leave the presence of one another there ought to be such an atmosphere about our life where the sympathy of God Is So poured down into our life it leaves an impression it may not even be the words that you have said but it can just be the atmosphere and the love and the kindness the substance that people feel from those words BR said see this is all about it's something of an advancement now watch when we look at this here I want to just take just a few moments here tonight and I want to just say to you in this way we want to look at one of the ways of really being a help is words words words now I want you to watch this how brother Bram says this in desperation he just got done preaching the message token said father God our whole life is wrapped in that for it's you and you are our life I tell you if there's one thing to be wrapped in it's him it's this message it's this Revelation let it wrap me up amen because getting wrapped up in him it'll change this caterpillar to a butterfly let me get wrapped up in him let me I don't want my life wrapped up in other things notice he says there is some here Lord that even holds this token that I spoke they have possessed that token and yet they're sick I want to speak tonight on giving them courage to encourage them to take that god-given rights they have a right to defeat the Devil he's already defeated and he's just bluffing them I'm claiming them Father now notice he can't defeat the Devil for them right brother B says you always got to check because if there's not enough Faith to actually caus that to move he said then there won't be faith enough to keep it from returning back is that right so notice what brother Bram is doing he's got confidence in the word Lord help me that I can say something that would encourage them to take their god-given rights oh my notice he says now help me to speak the word you speak through me Lord with a few notes that I got wrote down here and little scriptures wrote out I pray that you'll help me Lord and get in the word and give them faith for the glory of God hallelujah notice help me to speak the word Lord you come and get in the word it isn't we understand it isn't the amount of words that we could say it's just saying the right words I said God help me help us to say the right words is that right help me now you know when we left out of here a few weeks ago and I just begin to think when I got out of here and and um you know I was just thinking on on on something here of within these words and how that words matter and I begin to think about you know of a shot you might think well how in the world does that tie in well I I don't know just how God deals with me but let me just tell you something about this when I was a little guy and I I say that in you know ways that but I could have been little when I was a little guy I seemed like every time I went to the where my mom worked they had the health health department underneath it and every time I went there it seemed like that short little nurse that she might have been about this High it seemed like she always wanted to give me a shot and then it wasn't just your shots for school I mean anytime you were sick I hated shots I would go ask them I'd say look and before I'd even tell them my symptoms even when we moved to another doctor I'd ask them I'd say are you going to give me a shot they didn't know my symptoms then as I got older I got into high school and things and sometimes I'd get sick playing football or whatever more and I'd ask them can I have a shot that changed man that changed i' ask him for a shot I'm going to tell you something that happened to me here oh I don't know it might have been I don't know maybe 10 years ago now I don't know but I had a you know I had a sinus infection and and they were going to give me a a shot of an antibiotic I said yes I've had this same antibiotic many times I would call its name if I wouldn't butcher it but I I've had it and and and and and when I I it's a thick it's like a thick the needle's a little bit bigger I mean to me the needle seem like this but that needle when they came you know with it yes I want I want something to get it started I I've had them do that when I've been doing winter youth Retreats and maybe got sick in Tennessee and they'd give me shots and things like that so I said yeah give me a shot Well the lady goes out of the room and that Tech and she comes back in and you know they go to give you that shot soon as she put that thing in and gave me that shot I hit the ground man pow I thought what in the world has happened I mean I had such pain such pain I did not know at that moment things was flashing through my mind I thought am I going to have to call my wife oh no some of you are probably saying I hope I don't have shots tomorrow but but let me just tell you what happened with it so when I I that lady came back in and then the doctor came back into the room after I talked to her I said I don't know what's going on I said but man I am in so much pain I may have to call my wife to come get me she said I'm sorry she said I forgot to put the numbing agent on the end of that needless to say I've never forgot because now when they going to give me a shot even when I've been down in Tennessee or somewhere else I'll ask them hey you got the numbing agent on it I just ask him because it sent me clear to the ground I'm saying in this way that it was something that I needed but it didn't have the right Administration with it this is why the Bible says speaking the truth in love this is where not just words that matter this is where sometimes that Satan would want to try to even trap us up it's not just saying as far as the right words but it's those words being seasoned with the love of God seasoned with the Holy Spirit and sometimes that requires us to bite our tongue until the appropriate season right is that right sometimes it requires us something sometimes of things that we might see or think we see or whatever more but sometimes sometimes words listen friends we've all been guilty of this we've all been guilty a word that maybe we've taken the wind out of somebody else or we've gotten a response that we didn't think we were going to get and sometimes you know what if we really step back and look at it and say was the right agent applied with the words that were given right oh my so we want words that are in season remember when we look here in the scripture the Bible says a man hath Joy by the answer of his mouth and a word spoken in due season how good is it now remember remember we some weeks ago when we were dealing with David and Abigail remember when David was going up there to take business with naboth naboth had scorned him right but Abigail was moved by the Lord and she came and spoke to him and those words that were spoken in season turned his wrath to a place that he could reflect before you make this action before you make this decision you've got swords on your side you're getting ready to go full steam but let's reflect here a moment because God's going to bring you to the throne he's not going to fail what he said he would do but what you don't want is having regret in your heart amen that was a word spoken in due season it was a good word it turned David's wrath yes it is that right now it would have maybe seemed so unfitting here is Abigail here she is coming to the king and is going to turn his words but sometimes it's the things that we would least expect are the very things if we will take hold of that word it can be the very things that would cause us to think and to consider before we make actions true that's true amen hallelujah now watch this a word spoken in season remember brother BR would tell us like this you know that you know he said any Minister he said you know it's not you that's doing the speaking he said you never preached a sermon in your life it's the Holy Spirit preaching through you I mean it's very simple I mean a man can lay on all sorts of quotes and scriptures and everything else but it takes the inspiration of the Holy Spirit now let me tell you this I believe that it's the inspiration of the holy spirit that has to inspire a man on what to even begin to minister what are the needs and how do I approach this and I'm just going to be honest with you there's ways and there's things that God will lay upon our heart in a certain time that it seems like it does not why would this be dealt with or why would we say this or why would this or God would say stop and pause right here in this series and take this direction it may not make sense to our minds but God by his inspiration knows just what you and I have need of Hallelujah I tell you I've learned when I say I've learned I've learned to just trust him I've learned to follow him I've learned to just rely on him and look that don't mean that everything is easy it don't mean that there ain't battles but I'm telling you when it comes down to it it's God that has a word that's in season think about it this is why the prophet said if I spoke um a Lutheran word over you it would have no effect a Methodist word or a Pentecostal word it would have no effect on you because this is bride time this this is a this is a time that calls for a bright message a revelation straight from the Throne of God that's what it calls for so God knows what you and I have need of in the season that we're in notice job's testimony he said to the men in an earlier chapter I also could speak as you do if your soul were in my soul instead I could Heap up words against you and shake my head at you right cuz you know sometimes what can be the tendency depending on how we're made up is to give lectures well some of us would never be promoted as intellect uals or professors but we know how to give lectures now listen friends don't confuse me there's sometimes where there's things in the right season for things to be ministered you understand what I'm saying there's sometimes a right season and there's things that we learn as we go along of what needs to be ministered to it that moment is just an encouragement and a strength because they're already down where they're at and God will supply the ample time of when not to give the lecture but to give instruction is that right we see the prophet he took that same approach right down through the message now watch what what job said behold but I would strengthen you with my mouth and the moving of my lips should assuage your grief in other words it would cause your grief to be restrained job was a channel he was a true prophet of God and I'm going to say this to you you and I are called to be real channels of God Amen now think about it we don't think about just being a channel does anybody know the name of the lady who cleaned out the barn swept it picked up all the manure and had a meeting but we know the man who end up getting saved wasn't even a great crowd even came to that meeting when you really get to reading about it right there was only a few people one one shaggy-haired boy in cover Halls that walked down there and gave his life to the Lord we know his name Dwight El moody right but what was she she was a channel now she didn't all of a sudden rent Billboards and say hey wait a minute him it's because of me she was a channel and being a channel it allowed God to move with inspiration upon her life to be moved to minister to a need that was present in that community in that life and notice how God would work even where with job that job himself would be a channel not just of the revelation of God to come through in that hour brother Ram would deal with that and I have heard but now I see man you talking about using the word inspiration remember he would tell us job had a way of getting himself out of the way job lived by that inspiration it was inspiration or divine revelation that he had received from God but not only did he have the inspiration with being able to read the heavens not only did he have inspiration into the spiritual things but he was a man that through all of his walk with God he had a life that was inspired to be able to take account of the needs of others Glory because when he's asking these questions from our text he's not asking them as far as to promote himself he's letting them know this is what you should have been about this is what you should have been doing notice in Job chapter 4 it says behold now this is their testimony earlier chapter thou Hast instructed many to job this is what they're saying thou H has strengthened the weak hands thy words have uphold in him that was Fallen what a testimony thy words have up him that was Fallen yet upheld them and you have strengthened the feeble needs in the Amplified verse four means your words have held firm him who was falling Lord want say it like this God help us to have words that cause forward movement am amen you see in the in the army of God Retreat right going backwards that's yeah there's no such thing that's that's not it's just go forward see the way that the word of God goes it goes forward even let me just say it to you like this even when God deals with our heart and we have to repent and there's things that we repent about you know we're not going backward it's actually going forward when the Holy Spirit deals with our hearts maybe if your heart's condemning you and finally you come to a spot and say wait a minute I'm not going to carry this condemnation no longer there is a fountain that's opened in the House of David there is there there is forgiveness there is deliverance and the Bible said if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us you see that's a principle of God's word that promotes going forward amen I want you to think about this my goodness some weeks ago this I got a hold this scripture about turn me around a word fitly spoken Hallelujah is like apples of gold in pictures of silver all you can see is deity in Redemption but the word fitly here this is what really had me turned around the word fitly when you look it up it is the same word that is used to describe the wheels that Ezekiel Saw the wheels that were there when his train filled the temple that Isaiah saw fitly means the will so what is it we want a word that speaks of going forward a word that encourage forward because remember the Bible said wherever they went any of those for anointings where did they go the Bible said when the spirit came into the wheels the wheels were moved and what it say is that these go forward they never go backward the anointing that lays upon the word that's why we're not under that man anointing Pentecost was under the man anoint oting right but through the opening of the word now here comes the eagle anointing upon the Bride of Jesus Christ it's going forward under the anointing and characteristic of the holy spirit in this hour notice it's a word that has an anointing upon it to put the people of God In Motion for Rapture it's a word that is fitly spoken amen and when it's fitly spoken all you will see is deity in redeemed vessels apples of gold and pictures of silver oh glory be to God yeah apples you're the apple of his eye glory be to God now watch this the Bible says the preacher sought to find out acceptable words and that which was written was upright even words of truth right now this is where it comes down to words that would be of a help help me Lord remember even with Paul when he came and they wanted to continue to try to catch him in different ways Paul stood there when they came and here's the Pharisees and Sadducees right here A whole group that's United against him and Paul be begins to speak of his lineage in Israel and he says I am of the Pharisees one who believes in the resurrection of the Dead you know what he did he just halfed that congregation in half half of them that was ready to they were all one big gain to get him but the wisdom of God gave him the wisdom for that moment is that right then even when it came you know to to the Philippian Jailer everything else Paul never called he never took out his Roman passport at any at just any time but by the unction of the Holy Spirit he pulled it out at the right time it wasn't something that like some card you know where he had hidden back he was getting ready to play it no Paul had no thoughts about that but when it came to that God told him and gave him an unction to use that pull that out at that time how are you doing this to me as a Roman citizen see God had a reason for it a purpose so it was the right words in the right season amen and so sometimes the acceptable words remember though remember brother Ram tells us in Christ the mystery he preaches a prisoner before that and he keeps coming back to that story of how that he said that you know that woman that was possessed that suser and how she was going around behind him you know she was announcing that you know these been me men be of God and on and on and Paul said he knew brother said Paul said Paul knew that he had the power to cast that thing out but he said he was such a prisoner that he waited on the leading of the holy spirit is that right so God allowed free advertising for a few days a word spoken at the right time it didn't mean that that wasn't hard upon Paul no more then let me get it down where we're at sometimes there's things that we might feel pressed we might feel op pressed to say maybe it's to family maybe it's to son or daughter maybe it's a husband or wife but this is a real true application God help us to find the acceptable words I mean many of us have lost a loved one we've lost different ones I I don't know why it is you know sometimes you know when we're coming I I don't know I mean a lot of times I just be honest with you I don't know what to say so you know what I don't say nothing see I'm I'm praying for you cuz sometimes we can say some Sometimes some of the things you ever had people come to you and say I know just exactly how you're feeling no you don't no you don't now I don't mean let me let me just clarify that because I've had I've I've got people that I'm associated with that you can actually go to express something like Brother Ray I'm praying for you I I I I I you know there's a little bit I I can't identify exactly where it's at but you know it's just something in my heart about it but I'll be praying for you God I I I can't maybe understand what you're going through but you know sometimes there's been individuals say no you don't no you don't you can't and in the reality of it is sometimes it's been things that you've actually been through but sometimes the words that we're hunting for and looking for and sometimes we feel like we have to say something but I tell you the greatest thing we can ever say is I'm praying for you because you might know exactly what they're going through maybe some sort of a lost loved one and sibling or what you you might know exactly but just say you know what I'm praying for you praying for the family praying for you that God would be merciful to you God help us to find acceptable words but words that also are of truth right brother BR tells us over and over when he preached his first sermon he says this and you must be born again 1961 he says that in convinced and concerned different places he got up remember you most of you remember the story he got up and man he was so emotional all he cried and everything else and at at the end of the service he walked over Dr Davis said that is the most terrible I have ever heard right thank God he was honest with him you know why Dr Davis had experience he said you gave them people a bunch of emotion you never gave them one word he said when I was a lawyer then he went into his own experience he said when I was a lawyer I was arguing cases he said the first case I ever cried he said I got up there he said man I just oh you don't know this Widow you don't know this one and begin to just all that and he said finally the the the the other attorney stood up and said your honor how much more of this nonsense are you going to put up with and the honor just got up and just threw it on out and Dr Davis brought that down he said you know what it was he said that other attorney had spoke to him and said all you were doing was a bunch of emotion you weren't giving any law and this is where listen Dr Davis that right there was a credit to brother brandom's growth because what he told brother brandom is if you if in the only thing that counts is the word you've got to lay the word out you've got to lay the law out you've got to lay because that's the only thing that will produce faith is the word of God right acceptable words at the right time acceptable words notice how Isaiah would say this Lord the Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned that I should know how this is powerful to speak a word in season to him that is weary now notice not just a word but how right how be and he says he wenth more morning by morning he wenth my ear to hear as the Learned Glory God has taught me how Glory how now you know sometimes within that I I know sometimes we no doubt sometimes with all of us maybe I'll just speak it in that way that there's little times of things that we had judged to be insignificant or what would this word mean I don't know I I don't even know how I listen I don't even know how to approach the situation I don't know how to approach one there's phone calls that I've had to make I don't know how to approach that but you know what the first thing the only thing you can do is is just wait on him and listen and just listen and any words of comfort that can be ministered you don't have to come up with some great big flowery words or something that has to well I'm not a minister God you don't have to be a minister right I don't know how to put it all together you don't have to know how to put it all together but you can be a channel that God can work right through to minister to that other life anybody believe this oh yeah hallu I mean I think I just read across some quotes here today brother Ram talking about when he had come to the spot of that nervous breakdown and he calls a man out in the audience brother Gro he said brother Gro and his brother he said when I was nearly beside myself he said they ministered to me during that time night and day he said now he said I was out in the cornfield praying and brother Gro came out there wrapped his arm around me and said Papa God help brother brandham at this time he he help him Lord may you give him strength he's Beyond himself and brother Bram said brother Gro I trust that one of these mornings we'll be able to stand on the other side with our arms around one another how God help me to say the word how I say that as a father I say it as a husband I say it as a pastor and anything else you help me to know how cuz we are privileged in this hour to have the word but it's how how how right the whole message the token brother Bram takes that through the token and it's an application time it's an application hour now watch this God sees little things how many believe God sees little things little things he said he's not quick to forget your work and labor of love God won't Overlook it now watch I want to just read these little simple statements to you because sometimes that's where the devil gets us in a trap of well uh you ain't nothing Well none of us are anything well your words you know what God ain't going to talk you out of encouraging somebody that's right you can just take that to the bank and cash and it won't bounce God will God will never but he's trying to minister to somebody else through you and said do you mind if I borrow your phone for a minute do you m mind if I borrow your mouth for a minute do you mind you know I gave you those hands would you mind if I use them to text something to somebody would you mind if I took a little bit of the resources I gave you to send a card to somebody else would you [Music] mind Little Things brother B says it like this it's been said by our Lord heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away that's how infallible the word of God is no matter how small many times we think just because anything is small that it's not noticeable but Jesus said that even a sparrow Sparrow who was two two of them sold for a fourth of a penny and not one of those birds could fall to the ground without God knowing it God notices little things many times you say I can't do very much the conditions today but just a little kind word to someone an invitation a little testimony a little kind smile or a greeting to a passer by might mean more than you think it does it's little maybe I'm just going to speak freely just as it's coming to me you know it used to be I remember when God got a hold of my life and I know it was this way before he did you know what he used to be where Saints would get together at one another's house oh yeah and now we're lucky if we can all get together on the same Pew all get together at church at the same time you see what s listen friends you see what Satan wants to do is get us isolated in our own little world we become so insular to our own selves that's true and Satan wants to get us so caught up and all we can see is everything that's all around us let me tell you something the strength and how that you allow God to be a channel in your life to minister to somebody else God has ordained for you and I to do that you will find there will be strength and blessing that will come your way God never called you and I to sit in a church as though we're like 50 states sitting Under One Roof but God called us as a body to minister to one another that's right and the church said amen would Satan would like to get us all separated in our own little States and our own little ideas and our own little things come on friends we're always going to we're always going to see differently we're not going to see eye to eye on every single thing but sometimes I don't even believe it's that I think many times we get away from that brotherly love we get away from it no wonder Paul would write to us let Brotherly Love continue is that right but the same I've never been that way we might want to try it the Bible says entertaining strangers yes yes because sometimes we've entertained angels unawares that's good brother Bram said you're looking for God don't worry this ain't in my notes he said you might be looking for God and he said you know what that person he said that's sitting right next to you he said it's godville right in there he said you're looking for God he said and here it is in your neighbor here's God right there the whole time but you know what sometimes listen friends I'm not saying this that we happens willfully we can sometimes just get in a rut in a rut and you know what Co didn't do us no favors either it just worked to to to sort of just kind of just to build those things right there and try to do all of that and try to hinder but I think God give us Grace to be able to sit down and just to minister to one another it's not about sitting down and hey you know what I'm going to come to your house tonight and we're going to solve problems no let's just have Fellowship let's just have Fellowship you know the prophet said in Fellowship is protection my goodness these little things are growing blowing up here aren't they I love this statement remember that remember the little girl brother BR talks about ra waving that flag yeah right it was a Canadian flag she was waving that flag and Prime Min what a prime minister or whomever it was went by and she started crying she started crying the teacher couldn't find her she said he didn't see me I was waving my flag her patriotic part she was waving it he didn't see me right and that little that that teacher went out and got her remember brother Bram tells this oh my went out and got her and ministered to her at that time and notice how the prophet takes it here in this message he said but that's not so with Jesus you might get overlooked by by man but it's not so with Jesus he sees every little move that you make every little kind word that you speak and every little kind deed that you do let me just I'm just going to stop here brother Brandon makes this statement he's praying for for a lady for a sister and the the angel of the Lord has called this this sister out this is out of voice of the sign 1964 and brother Ram says what do you think L sitting next to him a man who is healed with arthritis do you believe too do you believe do you believe God can tell me what your trouble is you're way away from me just believe him now do you believe I've told you the truth then your high blood pressure will go down you believe it no he SP the angel of the Lord has brought his attention to this lady now watch he says you raised your hand up too now he's talking to somebody different you was trying to encourage her so the one that had been called out this one sitting next to her had been trying to encourage her do you believe God can tell me what's well you know what since you've been so nice to help her now God will be nice to help you the angel of the Lord was calling her out and the one sitting next to her was encouraging her Hallelujah and that moved that moved God's heart amen you know but brother Bram says when he saw Adam and Eve walk out of the garden brother Bram said when he saw that Adam was willing to walk out with his wife he said that moved God to to see that expression of Love through human beings it moved him to such a place to say I've got to make a way back Hallelujah it brought him on the scene listen friends I I don't God knows how to apply this to our hearts on Little Words little things we can say it can be little words that maybe can come from me but I listen I'm just telling you this I don't believe God has called me to this church that I'm to be the only source of encouragement I'm only one small part in it and I really mean that one small part but that encouragement that it would so flow that's right through the body a word that is in due season that encourages you for who God sees you to be as a son and daughter of God that words can actually be fitly spoken that's right through your life to one another amen this this is why friends I say that sometimes the little the little things God knows how to help us to apply that in our own life whatever God has he's called you and I to do even in ministering here through the body do you realize sometimes even the special songs that sung and praying over those songs and even when they're sung oh my you know you know what happens there's Devils that are put to flight that's right there was one battle in the book in the time of Israel you realize where Israel didn't even have to go fight they went out and just took up the spoil cuz there were special the Bible says singers anointed to sing praises to the beauty of his Holiness let me tell you you want to be an encouragement and you want encouragement in your life don't allow the enemy to cause you to hang your harp up on a willow tree don't allow the enemy to just look at you and say you're nothing you don't have any position you're a child of God you're a son and daughter of God you've got a purpose you've got a position I don't care you might think it's ever so little but you let God get in what's little right right there's a good way of always thinking about that that Lord I'm nothing without you but don't ever let it keep you from where you're making excuses say God let me just be available to you little things friends little things it's not big things it's little things little things little things it's just that little words sometimes just just even that out of the way just out of the way moment just an out of the way to go and check on somebody else Minister phone call everybody with me yes I know listen I I know we're tired I know we're tired at times I get that even sometimes when I leave out of the office here man I leave out man all I'm just I'm ready to eat I'm ready to eat man I've already had all the coffee I'm coffeed up to here right now I I'm ready I'm ready to eat I've already had my lunch on that I'm ready I'm ready to eat and sometimes you just feel like man I just want to I just want to sit down and just and just rest sometimes I'll leave out and with stste a little bit more when I get home but at any rate I understand there's pressures and things of life but I I want to encourage you don't be value the value that God has placed in you whether as it was mentioned moments ago you're a special singer don't devalue that that's right say God help me amen I know not I know not all of us maybe would be called to that or what but every one of us has our part because it ain't just about special singing It's about also checking on one another amen is that all right calling somebody get somebody on your heart you don't have to send them you know a great you know I I know I know some of y'all are wonderful with words I wish I could be better with words but I know some of you I mean like on my wife when my wife goes to write a text I mean it's just like you know and then sometimes when I go to write a text it's it's just short it's difference God made them male and female it's just true I mean it's just different you know uh but and what I'm trying to say is God knows what we have need of he knows what we have need of doesn't he he knows just how to minister to you and I I'd say Lord you know what and not not don't don't look at it and say I'm you know what I'm going to wait till I get out of this this how I feel in this rut but you know what the very answer to you getting out of the rut you're in can be allowing to become a channel that the Holy Spirit can pour strength into your life and lift you from that condition because you are ordained to minister to the body of Jesus Christ you love him tonight God help us to have a word that's right in season let's just pray anybody else want to be remembered in prayer tonight could we just let's just let's pray for one one another let's just pray there's hands up my hands are up too Lord help us Heavenly Father Lord Jesus you know every single need you know the paths that Lord that we're to walk through Lord father even Lord as you would direct us even in this moment in this season Lord here you would open these things out of job 26 and begin to minister Lord truly I didn't see that Lord until some weeks ago Lord God just a little bit just a few days before I stood here and ministered the first time out of job 26 but you've seen what we need Lord and truly Lord there's no way that we could have seen what we need to see and that it would be applied to our lives if it wasn't you and given us the unction for the season now father I don't believe Lord that you've spoken a word to us in this way that it would just fall and not return and return back to your Void I I don't believe that Lord I believe God that just within My Heart Lord and the hearts of my brothers and sisters here Lord none of us Lord not one of us mean to overlook things Lord we do not mean to walk around Lord as it were unaware but we ask you Lord God for your grace that you would help us to be more more aware help us Lord not to despise Small Things help us Lord to realize it's you unlike that Monarch or whatever it was in Canada he could not see that little girl but father you see every little thing Lord countless Lord testimonies of how it was in job's life Lord I pray that Lord also right now that God you would so tender eyes our hearts Lord if Lord even for words that would would come Lord our way may Lord you help us Lord that even that words that would be expressed to someone else Lord May there be Lord like that when that shot Lord that has it should have been given to me there was a numbing agent should have been there Lord something that would have helped it I'd had that shot i' had that that antibiotic many times but I never had had it like that God help us forgive us Lord when we've given wordsall without really being sweetened within your presence I know that's a trap Lord the enemy wants to get us Lord in those ways sometimes we feel like I've got to say this and I've got to say that and really Lord if we'll just weigh it on out we know that anxiousness is never the leadership of the Holy Spirit but in reality Lord nervousness is quite the difference a person can be nervous and they're not anxious they they could just be nervous here it is there may be something that they're just waiting and looking to you and trusting upon you but anxiousness can Lord be quite the different it becomes something to where there's not really there's like a a turmoil part that's going on and and it becomes like built up out of frustration and Lord God help us I pray may we reside and let off in the pressure in the proper place Lord let the pressure off Lord in you lord your Prophet spoke of how that pressure comes around our lives he said there's no there's no one exempt from it it makes the good act this way it makes the bad act this way makes the rich act this way makes the poor acts this way it makes the people out there act this way way and it also the people in brandham Tabernacle Lord God every one of us I know I'm speaking Lord we're living in a time of such great pressure there's demonic pressure all around Lord Jesus what has been released there in Revelations 9 the darkness that's upon the Earth we we feel it Lord sometimes Lord as we come to the house of God we come into our homes and then come to the house of God and sometimes Lord this is the greatest place where we feel the greatest peace no wonder sometimes individuals will close their eyes in here it's where sometimes the greatest peace where the battles in their mind and everything else are not raging but oh God help us to be sensitive Lord Lord I pray that when I'm down God help my brother help my sister to be sensitive that you can Minister through them to me help me Lord when my brother and my sister's down help me to be sensitive oh God you're the vine we're the branches we want to be just like what your Prophet said so Anointed with your spirit to where we could go to one another in the thickness of Tri trials and tribulations and Minister his sympathy as it pours through us help us Lord to remain channels Lord help us not Lord to get buil up to where the flow gets restricted help us Lord help us Lord forgive us Lord for our slothfulness Lord forgive us Lord for dear God in ways that Lord that maybe just getting caught up Lord with things that Lord it caused us to be unaware help us Lord I pray father that God with the words that we would speak to consider Lord like your Prophet Lord oh God as it comes to my mind right now he spoke and said I must receive what I've lost out there on the field I need that feeling back in my heart again because he said the people are not made out of Sawdust oh God help us Lord he was not standing there and asking you Lord God for some great understanding but he was asking you help me to be a channel that this word that's been open this ministry that's been loosened help me to be a channel that the word of God can flow through help me to be a small little part that that third pool can work through Lord oh God you'll test Us in so many different ways but help us Lord help us to be your servants servants that are delivered to the will of another one God grant it Lord through this building Lord Jesus this is the this is the purchase of your blood now father as our hands have been raised we're asking for your mercy Lord Lord God as it were we're asking you to take these hands take our lives Lord God we want to be real vessels and channels help us father your Prophet would encourage us and say it's through your kind words that this message is spread help us father it may not me Lord God when we speak to somebody else it may not even be the first time we speak to him we get into this Doctrine we get into that Doctrine but it's simply you touching their hearts right to where there's just an atmosphere that's created that like the prophet said they love for you to say something to them right oh God granted let our words be seasoned Lord seasoned and help us to be in the right season Lord father as parents husbands wives Pastor deacons trustees on and on throughout Lord God the
