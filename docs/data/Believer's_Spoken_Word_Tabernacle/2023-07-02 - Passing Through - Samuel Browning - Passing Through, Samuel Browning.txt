name you know what he's done for you and where he's brought you from there's a praise that rises out of our hearts that even in the midst of times that our Darkness David called it the night seasons there's a praise that is not dependent upon how we feel amen amen but it's a praise that's based on knowing whom I have believed and I'm persuaded he is able not I'm able he is able to keep that which I've committed to him against that day amen don't you love him man so good to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen and we just want to turn our hearts to the word of the Lord I'd like to read our text this morning and then we are I have some slides that I'd like to show you from the Youth Camp there just a little bit of a background and then going into my subject this morning so if you'd like to stand with me in Hebrews chapter 11. I just want to say it's so good to see each and every one of you and good to be here with you amen and uh just so thankful knowing that God has things has great things in store for us you believe that amen are you glad to be here this morning amen amen I'm certainly am I want to read out of Hebrews chapter 11. and beginning with verse 8. they're not going to you know they do have it up there but okay so Hebrews 11 verse 8. by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went so even in that obedience is just simply yielding to his voice it's not trying to figure it out not knowing god just told him come to a land that I'll show you and so all Abraham had to do was obey the voice now you think about this in this regards this has to be something greater when we speak of these things this is something greater than just a mortal speaking to a mortal the reasoning of a mind pulling upon the reasoning of another mind this is a supernatural work though Abraham's not in the land Abraham doesn't even know who he is he's never met God yet he's heard of God but it shows the supernatural when God begins to deal with the heart that God begins to draw that life beyond all of their reasonings and of Beyond everything that would seemingly make sense because for Abraham it made no sense to leave the land of UR of chaldees that's where the family business was it made no sense as far as within things of this life but there was a pull that Abraham was receiving from God so when we see this by faith Abraham that faith that even Abraham received at that moment to walk from Ur of khaldi and then even before entering into the land is father's still with him lots still with him but it has still been the working of the supernatural upon his life God draws us and he brings us to himself step by step of the way and so it's not just all of a sudden a supernatural moment it is a supernatural moment when we are born again and completely transformed but I want you to see the supernatural has always been around your life God has never lost sight of you that's why the enemy could never take you whether it was by car accident or whether it was by trying to ensnare you and everything else there's nothing he could do that could stop the for knowledge of God from taking place in your life it's God at work it's supernatural so we can say I obeyed but how could I obey how could you obey if now God did not give us Grace by a supernatural unction so that's where it takes for by Grace not of works that we are saved it's not us it's God has given us Grace and his presence has moved upon us to draw us to a place that's to just obey but I don't know what's going on I can't figure this out but there's something greater something I can't explain verse 9 by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which have foundations whose Builder and maker is gone now that City the brand was very clear about that that City he was looking for is the same one that he had met the king and Priests of that City Melchizedek so he knew that City it's got to be right here very very close through faith also Sarah herself receives strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore spring there even one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embrace them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they might have had an opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better country that is in Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath prepared for them a city by faith when he was tried Abraham offered up Isaac and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I like to if I just just take a few moments I had some different ones that had asked and I just would like if I could just just a few moments to show you some slides here of the the Youth Camp there in uh in Australia that we went to and just to kind of to point that out it was in you know Australia going go to the next line uh you know when you're looking at it to me all I see is this on the map when I got down there I realized one of the brothers come in they one of one of the families they were in through here some of you that were probably more versed than I am on Australia this in here is just it's just desert and it's it's really nobody dwelling there what happened there is the same thing that's happened in the states the Aborigines have been given places out in here like the Native Americans have been given places and places where I was at in Arizona I walked into those places and I looked at them I said this this is Extreme you know but here one of the brothers that I'll show you in a picture in a minute they traveled from Perth and this is very very warm over here it took them to get down to Melbourne and then up here uh it took them five over five hours just to fly to that one side of Australia wow so you know you and you and I kind of have that relation that if you're going to go from let's say Phoenix uh over to Atlanta or up to Detroit you're going to be traveling about four and a half hours so now you may have already had this down but I was not aware of how wide this thing was and you know I said my this is a big place you know actually and then brother Paul started looking it up of what it would be the distance you know in converting you know they still haven't caught up with learning things in miles they still do things in kilometers I just tease them you know I told him over there I said you know you you all need to start driving on the right side of the road you know you've received the message of the hour you've done the greatest right thing there is but now you need some so they put up with me as long as they could then they put me back on a plane but but it was all good so here we were in Brisbane this is where I flew in and it was Queensland Queensland you know from what they'd say over there that is where like considered the Florida of the country and you know and so I praise God that that's the first place I visited uh but it was it was their winter time over there so being that it was Winter it was uh uh you know in the days it would get up to 70 and 70s and then at night it was down into the high 30s and 40s now to me the whole time I was there you'll see me in jackets the whole time because to me it was cold in the 70s it was cold uh that's uh that's how it was for me so when the the sun came out the one day and it came out pretty strong and uh the one sister told me on the way up to because there's a path I would take to go up to the Tabernacle and at night is when I spoke so you know you could only see so far and the one sister said uh brother Samuel today we had to remove a carpet pilot off of the sidewalk that's it so what did you do brother Simon well what I would do the very next night because it was warm that next day I turned took my flashlight on my phone walked up to the service and so you know I I you know first thing I asked him is there any brown snakes out no they're in hibernation well that carpet python was supposed to be in hibernation too but it wasn't so um but in at any rate this is where we were if you go to the next slide it's just something to run through these are uh this is Brother Daniel and sister Cheryl this was the host pastor and um so brother Daniel is just just a tremendous brother and such a burden and a love for the word of God and just some things that God's really um just really moving there with him I believe this was the eighth year they did the Youth Camp brother Paul and sister Esther they're from Perth on the other side they're the ones they really just work hand in hand with uh brother Daniel and sister Cheryl as well as the congregation there but Brother Paul's just a uh just a tremendous brother same with sister Esther then over here here this is um brother Freddie and sister Doreen uh brother Freddie we shared the meetings together he's originally from Cape Town South Africa but he is there he passes a church in Auckland New Zealand and brother Taz his son-in-law is there and so the lady who was taking the picture must have thought this guy didn't need to be in it so go ahead and go on please go ahead so this is just another picture of all of us there uh pretty much after the pressure's been released the meetings are over and so uh there we are all together and go ahead and so I I didn't I was really reluctant about sharing some of these views with you because if I shared some of the views and the places where I stayed on this Camp I've never been at a camp that looked like this sister Cheryl told me when I came up there she said you're gonna have to remember you're here to work he said because it's it's like a resort and I said that's good I'll make sure I don't share that with my church but it was just a you know it wasn't too much this of a morning is what I get up and get my coffee and go out there and stand for a few moments and and see that and it's it's and it it's uh at a Somerset Dam where this Campground have been put up it's a seven-day Adventist ground and brother Daniel and them remember is just young people going there when um they would have family camps and things like that so that grounds they're still renting the really nice setup the young people there I guess some of them have been to other places they call that I mean like the Cadillac of the youth camps and so uh you know I I guess you know when you're looking at it and go ahead and go to the next one the the mountains and things are all around there kind of reminds me almost of appellation the way those those mountains are these are a lot of the the youth that are together some got a little cut off here but this was the the group of Youth uh that had come in for the meeting and they have their Banner the theme of it was Masterpiece God's workmanship and so you'll see mixed through here uh these are majority are from Australia there are a few in here that have come from a few other countries but there are also a lot of African brothers and sisters that live within Australia Perth and Brisbane Sydney Melbourne a lot of them that are you know from different places Zimbabwe and things like that that they have lived there some of them have um they've been there with their families uh well I don't want to say as long as I've been alive but but pretty close to it so uh they've been there go ahead and go so this is just some pictures brother Daniel shared some of these pictures here with me I had others but he shared some of these go ahead and go so that's just kind of another view and just a little bit of a lake right there of the brothers go ahead okay so all right so some of them that came in they came in from New Zealand as well I'm flowing over there okay go ahead and go it's a little bit more all that confetti on the ground was after somebody won a contest so they they had their teams the teams that have the banners here they had a contest they had to a few different things they had to do they had songs that they had to kind of um uh go through and then they had uh they had to take and construct the statue of a perfect man but dealing with it within the the full working in our lives so it's it was really unique and you know among some of the young people you you get some of them and my goodness like it's hardly stopped laughing the one night I preached over there the last night I preached on the thought complete and I just took the scripture it's not good for man to be alone and just dealing with that that whole word alone because that word alone in the Hebrew it is spelled out b-a-d bad and so I didn't catch it when I was preaching him but there was one Young Brother on the front row the brother Daniel spoke about it later I guess that brother hung his head and he was you know catching it in this spiritually but he was like oh yeah it's bad very bad so we you know those are just those are precious moments you know in there you just laugh you know so uh this was this was here all of us together and brother Freddie and sister Doreen and myself and then brother Daniel sister Cheryl and brother Taz go ahead and go on police uh this young man right here brother Elijah uh I'm I I was asked by the Bible Way Christian Academy to present this award Zachary and he are classmates and uh so with with um Elijah I wanted that was the first night I got there well second night and I wanted to meet him at the opening uh moment because Elijah his dad had just passed away from cancer it was in an 18-month battle and yet that young man uh with the award that we presented to him I took with me from the school there and uh he top within grades stayed focused and threw it all in a such a resilience what a wonderful spirit and just a real faith that through it all and you know I I reminded when I saw Elijah and I talked with him and just speaking with him and reminded you know of what how brother Brown talked about the young lady the stats sister where she said I must not have had enough Faith or as my baby would have been raised up when brother Bannon pointed out to her he says oh no he says you have great faith because when God had decided to take your little baby you have remained faithful so I was thinking of that when I looked at with Elijah because you know he and his mom and I just asked you to keep them in prayer because there's a lot of transitions that they're in they're moving actually closer to the church they're in Brisbane uh you know and so and it's also a lot of transition where sister um uh the sister is having to go to work now and all of those processes so an 18-month uh battle and some of the last of it is where you know his mind speech all those things were lost you can't imagine you know you try sometimes the things when you see and you hear whether it's testing trials that take place here in the assembly or things like that you reflect in your own and to me at least I look at this and I think what have I what am I going through what am I going through what have I got to complain about right you know sometimes you look at things like that and you think my goodness I mean my my you know and I just I just so appreciate that young man I wanted to share that with you and ask that you'd keep him in prayer his name's Elijah go ahead and go for me please so this is the setup it's one big Hall this is where they had church we had the services the podiums up there they actually had to put in more chairs when it got down into the Saturday and Sunday you had people traveling up to it and so but just with the youth and then uh some of the older youth that were there uh I think it was about 125 which is not a real big camp but it's good because you get to be very intimate with one another talk to one another and it's almost kind of like the numbers of our youth retreat the brother Paul and brother Berry does so it was very good that was actually the biggest camp that brother Daniel and them have had up to that point go ahead please so you'd see it's kind of the way the setup is here's where you would have the services and then over here you see these tables which that's right over here this picture's a little close-up this is where they would eat and that was the cafeteria and things like that and uh the one one night I was preaching and I I can't remember at what point I was making but you know everything surrounds food and so uh you know I was talking about you know don't you know don't don't try to just give me uh oatmeal there's a desire within that something greater than oatmeal well little did I know that's what they were going to serve every morning so the one brother was in the kitchen from South Africa because I got a taste of their bacon they're baking it's out in Australia I I told him I said somehow we're getting cheated here in America you guys must be taking the good portion of the pigs and shipping the rest to us because that bacon over there oh man if you like bacon that bacon over there it I mean it wouldn't even recognize this bacon and so eating that with some poached eggs and things oh my we get going there right now uh but anyhow you know that's what I was talking about so the brother said how would you like your eggs tomorrow so brother I'll be fine in the morning you don't have to worry about me so this was their eating the eating area so kind of you know for it may do for two two things go ahead and go please okay that's it all right so uh I have a uh yeah you can refer to that in just a minute I'll need that slide here in just a little bit okay for the service but I want to just um take a thought here this morning and uh as I was just getting settled on the the plane there in Brisbane and getting ready to take off to Vancouver and coming back home the Lord just all of a sudden they just dropped the inspiration I'm just waiting and so the inspiration just began to drop and I just started putting down everything uh that the Lord was bringing to me in that moment and I want to speak on a thought from the text we read passing through passing through because when we consider within this here the scripture had said here that they all died in the faith verse 13 and not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embrace them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the Earth and when you consider that you know I I think about that even in myself and you when you've went other places vacation or maybe business or something of travel that place that you're going to is only a destination for a small amount of time you've got things that you are intending to do there there's a purpose for it you just don't go anywhere and say well I'm here you you want to go with the purpose and so whether it's vacation business or whatever it is but that place that you go to is not your destiny but your destiny is is where you come from so as you go there all the places you go along the way every mile marker every post every gas station every stop if you're flying every airport all those things are just little Junctions on the journey they're not the Final Destination sometimes you run into those Junctions and they can you can have great difficulty in certain Junctions maybe it's a certain gas station or a certain airport or certain certain things in life that we come across and we are expecting nothing but a smooth journey and that's what we desire we desire I believe that the Bible would instruct us even in our lives that we would be at peace with all men that Christians Believers we are lovers of Peace that's what we desire why because we have been born of the Prince of Peace he has done for us and brought us settling in our lives that nothing else can do so In This Moment In This time of Journey that we are that we are in we recognize that we are coming through uh moments and Junctions we're just passing through and that's really what this in this whole entirety of this life this life and it's self as it is is not your destiny it's not our destiny it's just a passing through we are passing through this moment every test every trial it's not your destiny it's a junction that we must pass through there are things even things that we see as we pass through this journey there are not all things as we pass through here that are Bleak and dark and dismal but there are things that as we see a contrast night and day light and darkness you'll find things that are of Duty and then you'll find things upon the Earth that are not of beauty whatsoever you'll find all of that we find that as we're passing through but there must come a moment and something in our lives to wear them as we've walked is whether Americans or Puerto Ricans or whatever your nationality or ethnicity or whatever more there must come a junction in our life to where that we meet almighty God and we begin through that reality we realize that though I am here in this shell and I'm here I'm walking in this body but this body as it is through and by that first birth that sexual Earth this is not my destiny it's not my end then here I've I've come I've I've been uh uh come into this life I've come down into here God has permitted all of this because of the Fall we've come this way we didn't ask to come this way but even though we've come this way I want you to remember God's word can never be defeated yeah we might have some snags and Hang-Ups at airports we might have some things that happen let me just give you an example when I'm getting ready to land in Brisbane I get on my phone comes up a message one of your bags has been delayed it will be delivered tomorrow morning so I thought okay I wonder what bag that is I wonder if that's the one with my suits in it or it's the other one with other things in it I don't know because I can't tell by the numbers you know when they give you the the ticket stubs so I land in the airport I find get one of my bags and by the way one of my bags uh you know the those four rollers are nice on those bags one of the whole compartment is snapped off I wanted to I told the one lady I said I don't even use this bag this is usually the bag my wife uses don't try to blame it on her foreign but one of my bags so I come to find out when they they escorted me over to uh the baggage information center and there was somebody waiting on me they had the information they we put a file number through and uh you know they said Mr Browning here we'll you can follow this bag and we'll deliver it to you where you're going to be in Brisbane we'll deliver that and I said well I appreciate it um you know I'm thankful for that and I really didn't want to have to go out and buy you know any sport coats or things like that if I had to preach in jeans I can preach in jeans uh you know we can do that in tennis shoes and I'm sure the young people wouldn't mind that either but you know you you you you when I'm looking for that of what I've packed so I finally you know the next morning I I get a get a get a text even from the lady very nice of her to do that sent me the text let me know it was on the way and then I could track it it was like a FedEx type thing that they delivered it and I got my bag now I will tell you that when I I when that happened I had some people pray I called my wife I call my you know different ones and said hey would you just pray they lost one of my bags and you know I don't I'm not sure because when when they say you know fill this out and this out you may not get it for a week I stood in the airport with a gentleman who had um uh come in from uh he was over in France and he was over there on vacation and his bag didn't come to him until a week later so those types of things happen I mean I you know I don't know of anybody else unless you pack up a bunch of clothes that you don't want no more and you're saying please let the airline lose it I'd love to go shopping right there's times you might like to go shopping but it's not in those kind of situations where you're expecting things to be lined up just like this that's ending called an inconvenience because it just so happens at that time you're not window shopping you're looking for things at your size and it just so happens your size is not on the rack at that time ask me how I know about that so there's hiccups that come there's things that come in the journey but we're expecting smoothness but things happen but it's to keep in mind that we're just passing through there are things such as our luggage getting lost there's sometimes that you know what you can lose your joy there's some times where you can lose different things in your life you can lose of your happiness and it seems like you can lose that thrill but but listen let me tell you something there is one who's greater than any baggage recovery team the same God who gave you that in the beginning threw him by the imparting of his life is the same God who knows right where it's at and he's able to direct us back there greater than any recovery of any baggage system why we're just passing through just passing through so as a stranger and as a pilgrim and we journey in these times and you know uh we go there I I wasn't you know uh trying to figure out do I want to stay there or not I had one young man that was riding with me on the way home and we got out and I don't know how it is these days I try to keep up with different things but you know you get people talking about I'm getting Vibes of this environment what Vibes of what but I didn't say it I'm thinking that you know I'm getting Vibes you know when I was in Australia I think it's really nice and this and that and so forth well that's okay that that's wonderful but you know sometimes it's because everything in this age and I don't just say this everything is so heightened on feelings this feels right or that don't feel right and I don't feel like somebody likes me everything's Vibes and feelings friends I'm not just saying that that is an effect upon this generation where everything that is done is based on feelings my I tell you there's times when you know how it is there's times that I don't feel you don't feel and there's times when there's things that don't feel good but you know what you don't quit a job because I don't feel good these are I'm not getting Good Vibes I'm not getting good feelings I'm not getting forgive me I just those are things when he said that I I was chuckling inside I said oh no but we're pilgrims we're strangers once you recognize Who You Are and the only way you can recognize is who you are is who your father is reveals himself to you and then that begins to break the holds of this world because the Earth doesn't belong to to the enemy the Earth itself remembered the administration that's on there is the world and here when God moves down because remember we are coming heir to this is that right we're coming air to this not to the world we're coming heir to this of the Earth but once we've met God face to face and that's been revealed then this this world itself holds no nothing for you and I sure there's things of of pleasure there's times that we spin with family no doubt as as many will even in the upcoming days but that in itself is not your source of Joy that's not your source of delight there is nothing you could as a Believer ever be able to draw Delight out of this world and be satisfied and betrayed frankly the truth that's why then every Mortal that's why people become drunks that's why people become addicts and so many things why because there is a place inside a man that was made to thirst God put that first in there it's the thirst after God it's a vacant place it's called the soul and there's only one thing that can satisfy that and that's the comforter and once he you've met him then you recognize I'm not of this world can I say it just as brother random said it he said and recognize it he said I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Branham he said Boop that little seed came to life I was born again what was it you see the real birth when you recognize it's a revelation of Jesus Christ breaking upon your life it frees you from the holds and constraints where you can look down your family tree and say it stops right here why because the black line is drawn right here it stops right here you have no claim right here you might try to come into this body by different diseases there might have been things down through time but I'm under another Covenant and I recognize this is not my destiny what Grandpa did Grandma did Mom did Dad did that's not my destiny I'm just passing through Paul would write it like there Peter would write it like this First Peter chapter one verse one he said we're an apostle of Jesus Christ to The Strangers scattered throughout Pontius galatious Cappadocia Asia and Bethany elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be multiplied do you see strangers that are scattered look here we are here we are scattered in Lorraine there's no say scattered throughout Costa Rica scattered throughout Africa scattered what is it scattered you see God does not want everybody to be in a commune are you with me that's why God allowed the adversity to strike the church the early church why because man would have stayed in a communal way is that right we've seen that even rise up even when the the you know in the prophet and the message and different things like that and I've talked to the different ones and brothers those that were a part of that impress God and other things and then you have that in Zion Illinois why it because there's a desire now let me listen to me now there's natural desires God has placed in you and I and the Holy Ghost doesn't strip those natural desires out but what we receive the Holy Ghost is that there might be a reigning authority over those desires just like it's a natural god-given desire for a woman to want to be beautiful but we don't want the enemy handling and interpreting and directing that they we want it under the leadership of almighty God it's a natural desire to be loved and want to be loved that's a natural desire but we do not want that under Satan's rulership we want it under the governance of the Holy Ghost it's a natural desire a man and a woman natural desire but we do not wanted under Satan we want it under the influence of the Holy Spirit and that's what coming in contact with the god of Glory like Abraham did when Abraham met him on the plains of memory Abraham had heard his voice Abraham had been gripped in his life he had walked but now the same voice that spoke to him the same God that showed him step by step now the same God was standing there veiled and revealing himself as the king and high priest of that city of what belonging is in your life and he revealed to him that Abraham you are of the most high God why because your your origin reveals your destiny you see God listen friends faith is not something that's built Loosely of well I felt this no it's God revealing where you come from it's God revealing Who You Are we might have acted like pigs but we were sheep all the time we might have acted like the restaurant but we were Sons and Daughters of God all the time and you need the voice of authority you need Melchizedek to come down your way and say hey you're not of this world [Music] amen it's his voice it's his presence it's him that's Among Us that's what the message of the hour revealed and released and brought Among Us Melchizedek is not a history lesson it's not something on a tape it is the god of Glory right here veiled in a body of believers why wouldn't this is not our destiny we're just passing through even has Abraham was in the land in the land of promise where God told him this is where you're to dwell but Abraham still had Parts in his life that had to be worked out and he had to pass through he had to pass through a separation to lot he had to pass through the Temptation God never forced him to go down to Egypt and tell a lie but they had to pass through there right now you say why did Abraham have to pass through there well I'll tell you the prophet would pick it up in souls in prison and say I would wonder why why this could be and how a man could you know this and why God would include it he said but now I understand he said if we didn't have those examples we would not understand and know the grace of God you see the grace of God is Not based on if I'm not never Iron Crossing every T we believe in living according to the word that's the desire in our heart but it I am not standing here and you're not standing here because of our own goodness I did not put myself on the ground in Brisbane because I could fly the plane I couldn't fly the plane but there was somebody who was qualified who had passed all the tests was able to say even as I overcame you shall overcome also there had to be something that would encourage me to step on and take my seat in the plane something that encouraged me to get on The Old Ship of Science and say I trust him I I can't understand everything there might be some turbulence and some bumps in my drink might get tossed around but I'm just passing through the turbulence is not my destiny [Applause] sometimes sometimes the seat belt sign comes off right now like me those of you that's made long flights like that I make sure I am I'm strategic I want an aisle seat and I want to be close to a bathroom because I know in that bathroom there's a big old space back there I go back there and stand I'll Stand stretch my legs and and everything even sometimes when the seat belt is on because you know if you're by the bathroom they're not going to tell you sit down because they think you got to go to the bathroom but you know you're supposed to stand up and you can get blood clots and stuff on that longer flight you're gonna tell me what are you saying I'm saying that there are times in this journey where we have periods where the seat belt sign can be taken off and the pilot can say the seat belt sign is off what means you can move about the cabin freely but then there comes some hard times and and they can say hey there's a storm on the horizon now there's some things coming the way there's some things heading personally things heading the church hey Buckle out there's turbulence ahead there's times of up there's times of down there's times a buckle times of unbuckle there's times of rest there's times of press but it's all passing through [Music] amen that's why Jesus could say in John 6 38 I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him to send me I think if there's any declaration that should be upon our heart as God I'm not here to do my own will let all of my desires let every decision let it be pulled through the word of almighty God Amen Hallelujah notice Jesus would say in John 13 3 I like this scripture Jesus knowing this is that when they're white what should be Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands now watch what this understanding did and that he was come from God and went to God he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself notice what this Revelation here is coming in preparation for the cross they're at the last supper now has been you know uh the washing of the feet and and you know that that part of it where Jesus is locked in and notice when he knows that he has come from God and going back to God he already he declared that all along he knew them but knowing that everything you see what was he saying he was a recognition that he had Authority not just authority to call Ten Thousand Angels but he had an authority that when situations along the way turbulence would arise turbulence would Arise My Father if it's possible let this turbulence pass from me let this cup pass from me but he knew all things was given into his hands as the Son and Daughter of God As I said to you I think on Thursday night I'm not interested in controlling this Earth out here I will be doing good and well if I can just have a sufficient Grace to control this piece of Earth that I'm in right now that's what the Holy Ghost is for the reflect God through this piece of Earth this Earthen vessel that's trial it's frail and fragile but God has given Grace and knowing that all things are delivered into our hands what should it bring humility reverence to the word of God amen a humility girding ourselves with his presence with his word with the truth humbling ourselves to the word no matter we manner no matter what it is but God but being able to understand friends being able to understand and take that with the will of God that is moved and influenced our lives and changed us to understand we have to subvert our own will many times because let me tell you this guy is always about the easy way ask me ask me if I'd have turned it down if they gave me first class let me tell you something that first class on them long flights like that I had one one time going to London not because I paid for it they bumped me up into it I was like a country boy walking into the city as soon as I walked in there they wanted to take my shoes and hang up my coat can we bring you anything to drink and while the rest of the cattle are being loaded I'm up here in the front and the seat that I'm sitting on is about that wide it's about that thick nice leather you push a button it goes completely across down there's the down comforter oh not just them little itty bitty pillows that are nothing but kleenexes but I'm talking about pillows that actually knew there was a duck or a goose that put feather in them that's what first class and when they give you the menu it isn't choose it's uh this is all that's coming to you get ready so sometimes when we are looking in this part of it there's there that that part that we must go through in and have to move through within those moments and those channels and we we then maybe didn't ask for that but you see there's a lot of things that within it as I was saying this guy will take the easiest way let me just say this to you and and listen to me now this guy still don't like to pray this guy does not jump out of bed and say Let me listen to a tape good preaching now I'm not preaching to Angels I trust I'm preaching to other pilgrims and strangers that's passing through but you see those are moments you've got to pass through and don't allow your flesh to now begin to navigate the course you want to look at that time and say no I'm not buckling down on this I'm not going to make this a habit in my life where all of a sudden now this becomes the new formed habit and new way in my life let's just put the devil in the corner and let's just twist his nose good you don't do the same you know I I think if I really had something in me you know I I'd really be wanting to do that and I'd be doing let me tell you your flesh don't ever want to do it My Flesh don't even want to preach some things not that I don't agree with them and not that I don't like them but some of the times even afterwards and I'm dealing with the effects of it days later but I say it in this way we do it because it's the right thing to do it's God that's leading us to do it listen don't walk by your feelings walk by the leadership of the Holy Spirit and there's times that the devil says buckle up let's just settle down here but you can listen and say that don't sound like the voice of the pilot that don't sound like the voice of the crew that sounds like another voice because my God said go forward and the pillar of fire is moving this is a time to get unbuckled and a time to move on when you buckle up with Jesus it'll never hinder you but when you buckle up with the cares of this world it will bring you down it's almost like when they're bringing them them trees start coming down the aisle multiple it's about like Pablo's dogs time to eat it wouldn't matter what they're throwing out dog treats everybody just been everything and everything and you're just looking at it and I think sometimes we you know you eat more on those things and then you do any other time but you know there's a time you recognize hey here comes the cart what do you do clear the stuff off put your laptop away iPad phone whatever it is book you put it away and get ready for that tree you've got a space about this size it's not a space where you're going to be able to be an elbow eater like you do to everybody else you ain't gonna be able to do that especially if you're in cattle class you're like this all right so you've got to clear things what are you saying by the same you got to set priority what is priority at this moment and that is something every moment in your life you must take account of everything what is priority and there's times friends what's important is feeding on the word of God you'll never get out of here you'll never live in Victory the way you should be and could be and what God desires for you if you keep other things on the tray and say no thank you information you know when I was on that long flight 14 15 hours you know how much water they passed down the walkway goodness it was constant with water of course I'm by the bathrooms Bring It On but I know you know what I knew I knew you better you better keep drinking yeah so I I would tell them they bring in the water bottles come on Cup come on water I mean they're not just walking around I want to say this in a nice way they ain't just walking around just trying to wow we're just going over the top no everything's regulated right they ain't gonna give you one more drop of water than what it is in the budget all right so it ain't like wow this is just excess they've got these things timed out planned out regulations and everything so what is it when they're coming down with the cart get things cleared off when it's time to go to the house of God get things cleared off when it's time to drink let's let's be ready to drink let's get the holder you might have had your phone in that cup holder on the tray get the phone out of the way and make way for the cup to come with the water I know this is very simple but that's what he put on my heart we're passing through Hebrews 12. wherefore seeing we are compassed about we're so brain a clown of witnesses let us who us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us how looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the same went through the turbulences I mean it sat down at the right hand of the of the of God of the Throne of God he went through all the turbulences he went through the Hall of critics he went through all the unpleasant things why because he was just passing through what strengthened him the joy I'm just being that real isn't that right you should have seen the prayer beads come out I believe if people would have had to cut a hole in the airplane floor to get their prayer beads out of their suitcase they would have listened to me now you might say all them bunch of Catholics let me tell you something they made sure they had their pair of beads with them don't look down on them I understand they may not know no better but have you you have god with you have you put God first in everything because when there's situations that come up you're gonna have to call out to God there'll be situations that you're going to need his Saving Grace there'll be situations that fear will try to come in things will make a loud boom pop and you'll be looking for pieces all around but in the midst of that time that's why you got to know that you know that you know that you know that Somebody's gotta hold of me and I'm just passing through unless brother Brian said you know he said the problem we get into he said is Abraham tells that story over and over about a guy you know he was a packing up all kinds of stuff and they were packing up all this stuff to go worship they got all these Little Dream said they brought all this stuff they got put on the camera telling the story they got all their card tables and all this stuff they got it on the camels camels couldn't walk right maybe it's like after your wife does all her packing and you think where's room for me honey you can wear those clothes seven days you look good in them it's all right to smile you see here some things that brother Brown has given a story people sometimes pack up to go on a trip I remember as a young boy sometimes you know what you know I was trying to pack up on a trip even when we made that trip back and forth from the pancake land of Ohio Celina and we traveled up here three and a half four hours and they have the turnpike and everything together I look for stuff to entertain me sometimes that ends I would pack stuff up now I'm not giving a license to get on phones and things now I could probably I can preach a total different sermons on those things I see too much of that where parents passing things off to their kids and phones become pacifiers and they don't even know how to behave themselves in Social settings come on friends oh my brother Samuel you know you're giving me bad vibes that ain't me giving you bad vibes that's the Holy Ghost trying to point you to your duty and your responsibility and remember this is not our destiny stop buckling up on the things of this world and cut loose [Applause] I know sometimes my dad you know who'd have to look around at me of course I was the only my brother was already gone at that time and man sometimes I'd have that back seat filled you know now when I look at our boys and they got their backpacks man they've got things packed in there now I don't pack stuff to keep me entertained I have a special bag that has treats in it so when I get somewhere special treats you know what I'm talking about Brother Ray you got special treats I got special I got some special well we're going to it I got some of them but you see there's certain things we pack along the way and think man I'm gonna take some of this and we'll take some of this and take some of this and the camel goes I can't even move I can't walk the car is like this foreign all these things that you thought were going to be necessary let me just say something to you that there's a lot of things that we pack up and and keep and and listen God's dealing with our lives it's one thing for me to go if I went and told my boys or told somebody else just a general statement and said hey you need to get rid of some stuff yeah I was gonna I'm not gonna make a comment there but it's like saying you know get rid of some stuff a lot of good that's going to do you're going to have to sometimes get down in that bag and start looking at things that are there why because there's not enough room so if you're not going to go through it then we're going to go through it yeah you see I've given you Authority as a son and daughter of God to take the word and evaluate your own life but if you won't do that I love you too much to weigh yourself down and weigh down the rest of the body you and I I'll send some evangelists will send some Ministry and we'll go through the bad together to where the things are pulled up and you realize wait a minute I really don't need that after all wait a minute I really don't need that after all let me tell you something God is still doing that for you and I because there's some things that God is pulling out of our Lives it has nothing to do with pleasure but it's simple crutches that we have rested on when times got hard or situation arose and God comes in his infant and mercy not to condemn us but to open up our lives and say you don't need that you got me you don't need that you got me here you don't need that you got me come on and most importantly I got you yeah but you see that's what turns that's what turns it back you get to you're trying to carry too much of the world brother Ram said it turns you back he said here he said you know that guy said I'm packing up to go to heaven brother REM said I'm not packing up to go to heaven I'm unpacking the Rapture Cut Loose of everything and he quotes that scripture brother said I could see his wife go around and say John what's the matter boy where are you going I'm going to Worship the Lord how do you know you're going well I'm going well you don't even have a compass I know some of you are like Compass what was that what was that that was the thing that was the Archaic Period prior to smartphones and GPS right you haven't even got your ministerial license what in the world is a matter with you will they receive you you're going to Worship the Lord yes take your compass no I don't need it don't need it how are you going to get there well I'll find out on Google no that don't say that the Bible don't say cast your cares upon Google because let me tell you google don't care for you [Music] whether it's Android Apple or whatever more God never put a device and give you a device that should be smarter than you come on Friends AI artist artificial intelligence they cannot create it can only take what's been presented and mimic it are you hearing me that's all that it can do and that's why the reason oh it can do this now why because it has been fed that you understand artificial intelligence will never be able to replace God I know I'm preaching the choir on this one but I'm just trying to tell you that shows your position as the Son and Daughter of God you are an amateur creator you can create an atmosphere in your home and your children aren't little AI robots but they will mimic what they see out of Mama and Daddy they'll come under that atmosphere the creative atmosphere of the Holy Ghost and it'll flow through that home why Cobra just passing through how you gonna get there how follow the Morning Star healing if healing How You Gonna know which step to take next he'll leave me same goddess let me this far he'll Lead Me but it's awful dark and from you yep it's a night season but the same God in the daytime is the same God in the night seasons he'll see me through this night's season anybody know I'm talking about night season when Gloom wants to come up darkness wants to come up oppressive feeling wants to come up but let me just tell you something God is right there the whole time he's present the whole time he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you when there's turbulence when there's not turbulence I have never ever took my eye off of you the same God brother man said let the wise men to Christ by the Stars the same one here in the form of the Holy Ghost to lead you to the to the Christ the New Birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is God's provided way Hallelujah this is why Paul would write to Timothy second Timothy 2 1 be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus notice be strong in the what Grace what does grace do Grace gives to you and I well we have need of grace instructs us Grace is that even what corrects us and Grace is also the accompaniment of God's divine power to bring us into harmony with what he's calling for Grace be strong in it well how can I be strong in it by letting your will my will be lost in his will and be strong in his grace because let me tell you something he that begun the good work Hallelujah he that led you to take this trip take this journey you didn't ask to be on this journey you didn't even know you were part of this journey come on Rebecca you didn't know you were part of this journey but God knew you were a part of it and the same God that has led you each step of the way he'll bring you through every airport he'll bring you through every turbulence he'll bring you through every Junction he'll bring you when the gas hand looks like it's getting low and you can't see no Filling Station anywhere he's the same God that gives a refilling of the Holy Ghost why because he knows we're just passing through hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit that of Faithful Men Who Shall be able to teach others also thou therefore now watch this this admonition here I'm coming coming down here thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ he didn't say become hard that'd be easy in it sometimes we we can't be very easy let me just say this be very easy for us in our Humanity in our spirit to become hard sure with the with the cares and things we've been through things that maybe things been said on your job or things but sure listen friends I'm just going to say a plane as I know how to say it your your spirit and your flesh didn't get the Holy Ghost Paul's talking to Timothy he's admonishing him there's going to be some trials some hard afflictions that'll come your way but here's what here's what I'm encouraging you as a good soldier well what does a soldier do they fight I I never was a soldier as far as in that regard Brother Carlos brother brother you know I think brother Gomez different ones I know you don't wear your dress blues all the time Brother Carlos didn't wear that white hat and that blue uniform with the you know the red stripe and I hope I got it right he didn't wear that all the time matter of fact that was for that was when they did their shows and parades he didn't wear that when it came time to crawl in the mud and shoot but when it came time for that the camouflage was on you know what camouflage does blend in with surroundings you know how we fight we blend with the word of God we blend with the Holy Ghost we blend with the anointing of his presence we blend right in with him and then it's not us but it's Christ in us the hope of glory anything there's times for dress blues and there's times to have your Greens on endure heart as a good soldier of Jesus Christ no man that Warth entangleth himself with the Affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier so Affairs of this life will come but remember who chose you to be a soldier on one day I just went in and enlisted you know I just I walked up to the Altar and accepted the Lord Jesus Christ before the foundation of the world he knew about you you could not have even have a desire matter of fact brother Rama says it in one place and lean not your understanding he said something he said something was drawn you that is he said even not according to your own nature a place this morning I was looking at he said you didn't even have it was not of your natural desire but what is it that which was placed down on the inside that you couldn't explain you couldn't fit in here and you couldn't fit in there and tried to find Comfort here tried to come from the comfort there but you see God never lost sight of his Eagles he knows exactly where they're at he knows all of the scattering he knows all the situations and God himself has come and he is drawn upon our life and how Paul admonishes us don't become involved with the Affairs of this life now you might scratch your head and think how do I not become involved with the Affairs of this life I mean we'd all like to say glory to God I'm going to apply that when it comes to insurance bill not getting involved there buddy car payment not getting involved there buddy medical bill not getting involved there gas is free today buddy not getting involved there but we understand like Paul could write in First Corinthians 7 31 they that use this world you have to use this world you've got means in this world things that you have to take care of I don't care just like me and you things that we don't like doing there's turbulences I don't like going through there's things I don't like God I don't like dealing with there's things I don't you know and same with you I don't think anybody likes bills I don't like anybody likes going through all those things right anybody get a well I don't know I don't get a delight out of going and gassing up the car that's right no sir but Samuel what are you saying I'm saying that we have to use this world there's things but remember don't let the world use you you use the world you use the things that's given but don't let it become your God don't let it become your master you use those things that's needful but don't let it take and begin to use Mastery over your life why because this is not your destiny you're just passing through don't buckle down on those things not using this world as not abusing it because it passed away so don't become involved involved with that's what entanglements mean or caught up don't become wrapped up in this life I know this is very simple it's very very simple but you know it's the simple things if we just do the simple things when I got on that airplane they I don't they could explain everything to me about how the J how the engine works buddy all I want to know is it works the fuel gain all I want to know is we got plenty to go over the Pacific Ocean [Laughter] let me tell you how we made this chicken breast or whatever I don't need to know that you see I don't need to get wrapped up in it sometimes you can get wrapped up into things that are not sinful but it becomes a trap and you become buckled down in areas and you should be able to walk free you were walking free before you did run well what's hindering you Place God first in every decision I believe it ought to be a council in our homes in every decision how is this decision how is it going to impact Us in serving God amen oh God always be there remember there's a Rapture at hand and the prince of God's going to live from this Earth and if you don't value his presence right now it's a sure sign right now you need to move closer you need to move deeper and you need to ask God lord cut everything of this world away from my life if there's desires that I've got that are not like you and are not pleasing to you God I'm not here to put on a show put on a mass but I'm here to call on your Divine Mercy Lord because if there's anywhere I want to be I want to be where you are [Applause] that's why I put the lord always before me he's at my right hand and I shall not be moved that's why I said if what God said listen if What God Says in his word don't matter if it don't matter to you and you don't see the need of it I'm just I'm just giving a little bit of diagnosis here and you don't see uh to have the desire to pass your decision through the word of God then you first need to pass your soul through the word of God you need to pass it through the blood I don't say that to be hard with you on the other side we've been laboring right here I don't labor and preach and pray and every I don't do that that I might be the only one I don't want to be the only one I want to be there with The Ransom of almighty God and what's better than to P than to be right there us being together we won't be our own little group over here we'll be with the ransom that's been all down Through the Ages but God has allowed us to walk together shoulder to shoulder pray for one another fact battles back Devils off pray for the sick the Holy Ghost come we've been right here we have been ordained to finish this mission now I'm almost done can you give me that slide well I really appreciate sister Brianna back there I think she's teaching her daddy a few things go ahead and go to that where uh that one that says Brisbane that right there and it probably a lot of you traveled you've been in airports how many of you hear that term duty-free well duty-free means that you can buy something and you're not gonna pay taxes wherever you buy it this is something right here and this is where that thought it struck me because you know there's sometimes how God will deal with God will deal with me like that and inspiration and and this is what happened to me when I got off the plane in Brisbane oh I didn't have an airport map here but so you just have to bear with me when I got off the airplane I had to go and you know you're going to collect your baggage first of all I got to pass through all the customs and you know all the stuff put your passport in and they scan it and everything's okay you've got your Visa everything's good you're going down you get this little ticket you declared all the stuff that's in your suitcase and this and that you put all that there and you know there was even some things on my declaration list you know they group a lot of things together one of the I think uh number one on there was like I mean some of the stuff was like whoa this is some hard stuff but you know that because medicine was included in that I asked the gentleman that was from Australia beside me had a wonderful older couple sitting beside me I thank God for them when we were going over and I said I got medicine in my bag what did he said he said just err on the safe side he said go ahead and declare it and he said and then you can let him know what it is he said they ain't nothing to it well see I had medicine in there because y'all know I had that kidney stone in the first part were kidney stones first part of May and on my mind I did not want to be in the air and get one in pains my wife had me on some of these other herbs and things like this and things we ain't done no rain dancing but we got we do we got herbs and stuff that we do and I got pain I got I got the pain I kept them in my backpack brother right they're right there all I had to do was of course I said Lord help me but that's why I saw what you know what I had to do I had to I didn't want to go through that line I want to go through that I've been riding for a day but you know what you better do it they they played the same video on that plane over and over and that video it kept letting us know it's better to go ahead and declare it and let somebody else say it's all right thank you that's right that's good four times around on the video wasn't enough brother Sammy had to turn and ask the older gentleman do you think ought to do this [Laughter] thank God for the family of God and for the family of God with God's dealing with their life thank God for the family of life that there's hearts that we can say brother I'm having a difficult time sister I'm having a difficult time and what do they do encourage me go ahead give it to the Lord let God sort it out so I went through that line you know eventually when I had my bags you know the one bag because the other bag weren't there but I went through the line and you know they're bringing me through and they were escort me and I let them know everything you know it was just like they probably that's enough guy but then they walked me on over and took me to another place you know because I had Organics or whatever those the herbs and they took me down through there and so anyhow I get in there and uh then I uh I'm able to uh leave in the airport but you know before I got to my baggage I've never I'm not I've been to a lot of airports International I've been to airports here a lot I mean different different ones and there's airports I won't name them but there's some of them I don't care if I ever go back to them again why they don't have good food they don't have coffee near it it looks like you're just at a processing plant the Samuel food means everything is Comfort buddy it's nice to have some coffee when you've got to wait there in three or four hours or have someplace instead of just walking up and having a sandwich they made in China five years ago here's what I'm saying this was something unique Brother Ray I've never seen this before in my life never go to the slant next slide before when I got off the plane and I scanned my passport Then I then I gave them the first slip of paper not the card that I wrote stuff on and declared but the first slip of paper before Brother Richard I could get to my bags I didn't have an option I had to walk through this duty-free shop and that thing was big it was every bit the size of this building and probably twice as wide you talking about beautiful you went from like the Dark Ages all of a sudden and nice shiny floors and you got all these and it's good smelling things perfume and cologne and you're walking by maple syrup chocolate I mean it and it's just presented just right and you know how they got it angled they got it so that every way you turn it can catch your eye brother Aaron I couldn't go around it you couldn't go around even say I don't want to go through that duty-free shop you had to you had to I had to walk right down through it all and I could either get off here you see their stuff they had all that liquor and everything else they got there go to another slide that's what I'm talking about they had all kinds of candy I couldn't run over on this side then they had maple syrup and other things and this is what struck me I was after my bags I was just passing through there so even when I went to get back on the plane to go home you know what I had to go through before I could ever get to my gate after I cleared security to travel back home you had to walk back through a duty-free shop you can't say oh I'm just not going to go in there I had to if you want to get to your gate and where they release you you had to walk through that area this one just like other shops set up around and what I'm saying is like this right here there's a lot of things in there there's things on that first slide that as far as when it come down then the alcohol and whatever more well I wouldn't have been you know there's nothing that I'm going to go for that but on this other slide that you looked at the next one there now there are some things right there I can get trapped in maple syrup and chocolate and man I mean some you know they had it laid out but Samuel what what are you saying well I'll just tell you like this that there's a lot of things that when I walk through there and we walk through this life there are there are things that you don't get a choice well I'm gonna go around this you've got to walk through some places you've got to walk through temptation but just because you're tempted temptation is not sin what do you do turn your head and keep going I was tempted to buy some maple syrup I was tempted to buy some chocolates sure I was they had some unique KitKat bars there [Laughter] I don't know they didn't have kangaroo in them but I don't know what they had in them but they were unique I didn't see the flavors here in the States you see every why are you saying things are out there to try to draw me in and so here I was I was all packed up and ready to go but if I'd have went through there and I've started buying stuff I'd have been like the other people walking around with a brown bag there were some people by the time they got to the gate they had a cart and I'm thinking where is that going to go where is that going to go because I know where my feet is going and you know where my feet near your chocolate you understand there's only so much room in the overhead compartments you got to put it under your seat I didn't know where to go what happened they wrote it down with duty-free stuff stuff was catching their eyes and appealing to their taste there's a lot of things that can appeal but as Peter could admonish Us in First Peter 2 11 dearly beloved I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lust which war against the soul in other words you see something that's coming down the road don't wait to see if it's a car or a truck get out of the road having your conversation honest among the Gentiles whereas they speak against you as evildoers they may by your good works which they Shall Behold glorify God in the day of visitation let me read this in closing can I read that I'm going to read a quote out of the message communion I'm closer I'll close on this the Bram said almighty God the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who raised him up from the dead and set him at the right hand of the Majesty ever living to make intercessions upon the things that we believed that he did for us and confess it to be so we pray Lord God that tonight that you forgive our sins we want to keep under the blood all times for we don't know just what might happen all things are about wound up we feel Lord that the coming of the Lord is at hand and we're fixing to take a journey and as we think of a journey we might think of suitcases and extra clothing extra shoes but how different from this journey it's not packing up it's unpacking laying aside and then you say Lord go through my baggage maybe there's some things I've got that's extra maybe you've been through the duty-free shop of life you've got caught into traps of things that you say Lord I want to unpack that all it's doing it's slowing me down it's a weight it's hindering me maybe you become involved with things in this life that you realize emotionally sometimes it's not even physically sometimes it's emotionally you have become involved with things that you realize oh I'm just going to Pieces because God never built you to handle those things it's to cast your cares upon Him and let me just say this to you there are some things that you can become involved in that you can't all of a sudden just say I'm not going to be involved in any longer but you can when God deals with your heart say Lord lead me out of this award and teach me Lord give me the wisdom so the next time I'm passing through the duty free shop of life I'll remember I'm not here to count down I don't want things of the world added to me I only wanted things added to the Statue of a perfect man that God desires in my life that's what I want amen anybody join with me and say Lord grant it amen let's go to him in prayer Heavenly Father Lord simple thought as I set their lord on the tarmac that day and that inspiration dropped I didn't know Lord I didn't even know clear up through this morning I've waited on you you know that I didn't know if it'd be for today or for another moment or another time but God even as the morning went on it continued to press and press and press and press having multiple Lord things upon my screen even looking this morning but yet the Press Lord father were passing through Lord and you're mindful you have Lord designated there are stops along this journey just like those carts that would come down the aisle at designated times give us a snack or give us a meal or give us the Lord that of a beverage of choice water pop tea coffee whatever things that Lord that would be given in that moment Lord you know what we have need of father as your children were passing through this world is not my home it's not our home we're just passing through as pilgrims and strangers well I know that Lord when people will ask us where are you from I'm from Lorraine oh really but God we realize that may be appear upon this Earth as far as a physical location that others could be able to identify with but God what is the most important is that Lord that we recognize I've come from God and I'm going back to God Lord that Revelation working in our hearts and our lives gives us strength it gives us strength Lord that even in the moments and times when we might get sidetracked in that duty-free shop God how you'll come down in your grace and remind us hey there's a trip to complete there's a purpose to be served this life this world is not your destiny it's not your home oh God hands throughout this building Lord in my hands lifted with them Father I pray that God that you would forgive us Lord where that we have become entangled and when we have with the Affairs of this life sometimes the Lord it isn't even where we've went certain places or done certain things but God our emotions have become so involved in things that God I know we can't cut that part out of our life but Lord sometimes it's just even within that and God how that Lord that we need your grace to help us Lord to bring healing in our lives forgiveness release of bitterness and resentment Lord father well I know we may not be picking up chocolates and other things like that but sometimes Lord there's things that we've picked up that we need to let go of help us may we take and accept the grace of God that's come by here this morning Lord to lay aside every weight and every sin that does so easily beset us Lord father I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus God for every heart you know behind every hand I pray that God that you would Grant overcoming Grace for every besetting sin may you grant Lord God of that strength and that confidence that Lord as it simply has directed us in your word lay aside every weight Lord God it's under your Authority we don't even have to explain it we don't have to try to Lord but God in your presence where our bag you know the contents of our bad Lord God as I've been there upon the different places some of the places now when you go through security you don't even have to take off your shoes you put your bag right on there they don't even have to take out my laptop and my iPad and everything else leave it all in there because there's certain machines and the way they're able to just scan everything now now Lord forgive me but I'm still a little skeptical because it's something that man made and I know there's some I know there's a blood I know there's a sacrifice Lord that's been offered I know there is the anointing of your person that's right here Among Us that God as we will allow Our Lives to pass through the great scan of the Holy Spirit Lord would you help us if there's things that we've got in our bag that needs to be taken out and I'm sure there is Lord my hands are up with them Lead Me Lord maybe it's things of character maybe it's things Lord God that we've become entrapped with sometimes the Lord is the children of God we do not become entrapped by things that we would look at and say well I'm going to do something bad but things Lord sometimes that are good but sometimes Lord we let our compassion and our reasoning get way out of line the duty free shop would like to pull us that way God may we not compare ourselves with one another I pray may we not try to compare and fit in with this world because Lord this world is going straight to hell I am not going that direction I was headed there in one with landlord but your grace intervened you spoke to my heart and Lord God the hearts of others that are right here and say hey hey hey you're headed the wrong direction you've come from me you've always belonged to me it's time to come home oh God help us Lord help us I pray as your prophet and that quote said Lord keep us under the blood at all times Lord we want to stay in step and in fellowship with you as our heads are about I believe there I believe the grace of God right here among us to be strong in his grace if you've been trapped in something if you've become entangled why don't you just accept the grace of God right now identify what it is yes this is entrap me certain things decisions I never would have made like this before maybe it's where you love the Lord but you realize that there's things that you've just been allowing to be put before God and you feel so empty it's because the rightful position should always be God your family than yourself never put your family ahead of God never put loved ones or others ahead of God put God first and he is the word and if the order ever gets out of line brother Brown would say in an earlier part of the message then he picks that same statement up and how can I overcome that is the pathway to overcoming so if there's anything that you have been entrapped and snared with let the Holy Spirit not only come down and give you the grace to relieve within that but say God let there be a testimony bloom in that area of my life Grant it Lord Jesus granted Lord this morning Hallelujah Heavenly Father we commit Lord this service to you commit the words Lord that have been spoken into your hands May everything that's unlike you Lord may we lord God surrender it to you I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you love him all blessed the Lord O my soul amen if you'd like to stand you know it's always important to know what you're taking on the plane there's things now since 9 11 that you just can't put in a carry-on and take on it's even so specific you walk up with a water bottle in your bag to the security they will ask you you want to stand there and drink it or you want us to throw it away now water you could drink water but one of the I think it was the second time brother Jerry and I went to the Philippines but Jerry had a had a bag that he could take with him on the plane a little personal bagging with a carry-on and then um they started passing that through well brother Jerry had some bigger bottles of hand sanitizer he had some other toiletries that had certain ounces in them that were not travel size so when they got to the end of that security they had all this bundled up and they said you want us to throw it away or do you want to take it and go back out there and try to get it put in your bag now my heart dropped for him because I know he went into all the labors to put that in the bag but you see it wouldn't have been anything wrong if the certain powders and everything like that jail had been in compliance with what was requested so you don't want to add or take away from you want to be right in compliance because the machine's not going to just pass you on and say oh that's that's brother Shane you can have a big bottle of hand sanitizer no no they don't care who you are this right here doesn't fit in you wouldn't believe all the stuff you see in the trash what no brother Jerry he had a choice anybody ever been that condition before at the end of the okay you got a choice you got a choice to say do I want to go back through that whole line again do I want to go out there and then try to have him find my bag and try to put this stuff in the bag that goes under the plane or you just say ain't worth the trouble it might I'll tell you it might it might you might talk about it you might eat your breakfast not even know what you've ate because you're still bothered by that got thrown away come on now we're human right right but it'd be better to not get involved with it it'd be better to let it go and say God give me Grace to get over it and go beyond it because I ain't going back I ain't going back I've already come through security check I've been right in the line with what's been asked I ain't going back I don't want to go back Wayne where you going I want to go to where my ticket says that I'm going my token says I'm going home that's where I'm going you know you might have to throw this way throw that away it ain't worth taking if Something's Gonna Keep Me here it ain't worth it cause I'm just passing through God gives us Grace to evaluate do you want to keep it do you want to keep it see you just don't reach in and yank things out of it you want to keep it I'll say Lord there might be things I want to keep but I know that there is a bomb in Gilead that can Minister even to things that maybe that I felt comfortable with certain ways that we have a family doing things now don't get quiet on me now we all have them and it's not saying one's right one's wrong we're there ain't no family that's the standard the only standard family there is is the family of God but there's certain things about us that we see as the word begins to examine over our lives we might have all of the right ounces of toothpaste all the right answers of all the quotes all the right ounces [Music] but see God wants to go even deeper than that maybe maybe we've got the right answers in their experience with God but then through that God begins to move down in our lives and certain things show up in certain situations where did that come from it was there the whole time but that situation allowed the scan to come up and you to see it oh Lord that's still there yeah what do you want to do with it you want to leave it here Lord where should I take it to you know brother Brian they don't ask anybody they didn't ask my brother they don't ask none of them people hey why don't you take this this trash can no the guys are standing there and usually them guys are strapping oh and they got this and here's they got the nice gloves on I want to be sanitary when they throw your things away and they ask you the question what you want to do well take it or you want me throw it away we're gonna do see that's the same thing this morning what do you want to do you want to take it back home with you or you want to leave it you want to take it with you or by the same I you know there's an overcoming I know but there's always a start there's a decision with everything in your life even in the beginnings of your journey and then throughout your journey there's always a decision and every time you make a step towards God 's making a step towards you so you got to answer what do you want to do with it you want to take it back home or you want to leave it I said Lord I want to leave it with what right now you've dealt with me on not me going through the bag but what you've dealt with me I want to leave it I want to leave it because you know what there's one who's standing there who's got the strength to help me go ahead and meet us world I'm just a passing through my treasures [Music] open and I died [Music] I
