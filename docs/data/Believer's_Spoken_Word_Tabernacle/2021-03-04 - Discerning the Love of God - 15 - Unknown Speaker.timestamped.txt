[40:28] mercy and
[40:30] so grateful that the lord just
[40:33] just helped us to get that straightened
[40:35] out and just continue the different
[40:37] requests and
[40:38] things that you heard mentioned here
[40:40] some of the different needs just
[40:42] continue you know as
[40:43] as always just to keep them before the
[40:45] lord in prayer
[40:48] and sometimes when you maybe don't see
[40:49] someone here
[40:51] you know and i know it's kind of hard in
[40:53] the time that we're in because you don't
[40:54] always know who's here and who is in
[40:56] here
[40:57] but you know when someone comes on your
[40:59] heart just take them to the lord in
[41:00] prayer
[41:01] you don't have to be in your prayer
[41:02] closet if you're just even maybe you're
[41:04] driving down the road just pray
[41:06] for him right then god is mindful amen
[41:09] for each and every need and so
[41:14] let's just look here in the word of the
[41:15] lord in first corinthians chapter 13
[41:18] verse 4.
[41:37] charity suffereth long and is kind
[41:41] charity envieth not charity wanteth not
[41:45] itself
[41:46] and is not puffed up may god bless the
[41:49] reading of the word bless you as you're
[41:50] being seated
[41:54] brother brian maybe just just a little
[41:55] bit here in the morn just turn it down
[41:57] just a little bit i don't know what
[41:59] got out of cater but it's okay nobody's
[42:02] going to blame you for it
[42:05] we want to look here a little bit more
[42:08] as the lord's been taking us on this
[42:10] with
[42:11] the love of god you know when we're
[42:14] we're looking at it and i i think our
[42:17] brother branham was just
[42:18] coming across it here the other day
[42:20] brother branham was looking at you know
[42:22] and mentioning of how that when the
[42:25] spirit of god he says we come into his
[42:27] presence and the lord just begins to
[42:29] just to deal with our lives there's
[42:31] things that sometimes we can begin to
[42:33] see
[42:34] even unbeknown to ourselves and certain
[42:36] things that become to light that
[42:38] we were not even aware of and meaning
[42:41] that it's things that could have taken
[42:43] place
[42:44] uh in our life and things that brother
[42:46] brown talks about mistakes and different
[42:48] things he said we know there's a blood
[42:50] that is present
[42:51] that is able to take care of each one of
[42:54] those you know sometimes the way when
[42:56] when the spirit of god comes in the
[42:57] light in which that we're able to
[42:59] examine it
[43:00] by the spirit of god there's things that
[43:02] god will begin to show up in our lives
[43:04] and it's it's the molding
[43:06] it's the shaping of our character and
[43:08] it's a great it's a great quality of the
[43:10] bride of jesus christ to be able to take
[43:12] the word
[43:13] and to be able to examine our lives and
[43:15] not just be a hearer of it
[43:17] but be a real doer of it and to
[43:19] recognize that you know when we look at
[43:21] it that it's not our own righteousness
[43:23] it's god's righteousness that it is not
[43:26] our perfection
[43:27] it's his perfection of his life in us so
[43:30] our confidence
[43:32] is in that righteousness that perfection
[43:34] of his life
[43:35] inside of us and the desire that we
[43:38] would have
[43:39] as a believer is lord i desire that my
[43:42] life would be
[43:43] pleasing to you if there's anything
[43:45] that's out of line in any way lord
[43:48] help me lord god that it might just be
[43:50] brought in tune or in line you know many
[43:52] times we
[43:53] we can ask god and say well lord we we
[43:56] we just need you to move in this
[43:57] situation or we need you to move right
[43:59] here and it's true we need god to move
[44:02] but you know many of the times even in
[44:04] sometimes in that
[44:05] it's really getting down to we know what
[44:08] the answer is
[44:09] but what's the problem you see because
[44:11] when we're looking at it we're looking
[44:13] and we know that he's the answer but
[44:14] sometimes it's to try to get down to
[44:16] really
[44:17] what's the problem because he'll answer
[44:20] that problem
[44:20] he'll minister to it and sometimes the
[44:23] problem is
[44:24] is just us are you with me
[44:27] so god gives us grace even to be able to
[44:29] overcome
[44:30] even in those things and so when we're
[44:33] looking at this thought of it in
[44:35] in dealing with uh vaunteth not and i
[44:37] want to just
[44:38] just move a little bit more here tonight
[44:41] we probably won't be able to transition
[44:42] to the next part
[44:44] but i want to just move through this
[44:45] tonight on some things
[44:47] because vaunting of oneself is not
[44:50] altogether
[44:50] what sometimes a person would even say
[44:54] but sometimes it comes down to even the
[44:57] very actions and what things are done
[45:00] and the spirit of god remember his soul
[45:02] is so precise
[45:04] that it looks beyond even things that
[45:06] are done outwardly that sometimes those
[45:08] things can seem
[45:10] so innocent and so righteous and even
[45:13] right
[45:13] that yet the spirit of god it's a
[45:15] discerner of the very thoughts
[45:17] and intents of the heart and you know
[45:19] when the word comes there's nothing that
[45:21] can be hid
[45:22] from the word when it comes the bible
[45:24] says all things are
[45:25] are naked and open before him with whom
[45:28] we have to do
[45:29] so the word comes to search our hearts
[45:31] and that's what we want we want the word
[45:33] to search our lives so here we find when
[45:36] the lord jesus here he is
[45:38] as he as he comes here and he's
[45:41] beginning to
[45:42] deal with how the condition of how that
[45:45] a believer
[45:46] and a life should walk before god and he
[45:49] brings out and he draws out the contrast
[45:51] of what
[45:52] that the disciples and the rest of them
[45:55] have seen
[45:55] before them and here's where he takes it
[45:58] in matthew six 6
[45:59] 1 it says take heed that you do not your
[46:02] arms
[46:03] before men to be seen of them
[46:06] otherwise you have no reward of your
[46:08] father
[46:09] which is in heaven therefore when thou
[46:12] doest thine alms do not
[46:13] sound the trumpet before thee as the
[46:16] hypocrites do in the synagogues and in
[46:18] the streets
[46:19] that they may have glory of men barely i
[46:22] say unto you they have the reward so
[46:24] the lord jesus has dealt with it that
[46:27] that the real
[46:28] real reality in an alm itself is is a
[46:30] righteous deed
[46:32] it's helping somebody out it's
[46:33] ministering it's ministering even
[46:35] of that of mercy to one maybe there's a
[46:38] need or or
[46:39] maybe god it isn't all together a
[46:40] financial need that sometimes
[46:42] how god will work and he'll move through
[46:44] the body and
[46:45] as we said before it's a glorious thing
[46:48] to be used of god
[46:49] but we must always remember that it's
[46:52] just like this microphone i'm wearing
[46:53] the microphone can't do
[46:55] nothing it's not the microphone that's
[46:57] given forth the message
[46:58] the microphone is only an instrument and
[47:01] that's all we
[47:02] are we're just an instrument in the hand
[47:04] of god and it's
[47:05] our responsibility to ensure that our
[47:08] life remain
[47:09] as an instrument that he can use at any
[47:12] time
[47:13] and so these are things that god as he
[47:15] would speak there
[47:16] and he would deal with that the one of
[47:18] the things that is he would speak to
[47:20] even those in that time the religious
[47:23] the pharisees
[47:24] they were doing things but they were
[47:26] doing it with the motive
[47:28] to be seen they were doing it then as he
[47:31] says in the next verse
[47:32] to be heard they wanted to let everybody
[47:35] know what they had done
[47:36] you know they had to let everybody know
[47:38] you know when you know the testimony or
[47:41] whatever hey i was the one praying for
[47:42] that
[47:43] and it didn't need to be at all you see
[47:45] that's that's a motive
[47:47] that takes away from the attention of
[47:50] what
[47:50] god is the one who's doing it's god who
[47:54] does it we recognize it's not
[47:56] it's not our prayer it's god moving on
[47:59] our hearts
[47:59] it's god's grace and us to be able to
[48:02] respond to that
[48:03] and to pray for the different needs it's
[48:05] as an entire
[48:06] body and so here we see that
[48:10] jesus as he said let not that left him
[48:13] know what the right hand is doing
[48:17] remember brother branham was asked in a
[48:18] situation regarding in the tax case and
[48:21] they couldn't figure out they say you
[48:23] know they were really coming at him and
[48:25] they said
[48:25] here you come before your group of men
[48:28] and you got nothing but a bunch of yes
[48:30] men
[48:30] and everything else and you didn't even
[48:32] ask the trustee board or whatever if you
[48:34] could take
[48:35] take the money and out of a you know a
[48:38] check and offering that was given and
[48:39] you
[48:40] paid for a widow's mortgage you paid for
[48:43] this and you didn't even ask them
[48:45] brother branham take the scripture and
[48:46] he says to the man he says here's what
[48:49] god's word says
[48:50] let not the left hand know what the
[48:52] right hand is doing
[48:53] you see it's a principle that that the
[48:56] desire is
[48:57] is not to draw attention to ourselves
[49:00] charity does not want to draw attention
[49:03] to the vessel but charity wants to put
[49:06] all attention and glory on him you see
[49:10] god won't share his glory
[49:11] with nobody if a vessel or
[49:14] anybody even a church begins to glory
[49:18] in things god will pull back because
[49:21] it's not the vessel
[49:22] nor the church it's god to receive all
[49:25] the glory
[49:26] so we look at this how that the lord
[49:28] jesus here he would go in and i think
[49:31] that's so
[49:31] fitting of a scripture that the angel of
[49:34] the lord would
[49:34] would speak to the prophet in regards to
[49:37] the third pull that word
[49:39] working in simplicity and humility in
[49:42] the body
[49:43] christ working in his body and he says
[49:45] when thou
[49:46] prayers thou shalt not be as the
[49:48] hypocrites are
[49:49] for they love to pray standing in the
[49:52] synagogues
[49:53] and in the corners of the streets that
[49:55] they may be
[49:56] seen of men barely i say unto you they
[49:59] have their reward
[50:00] i read this and i think of it right now
[50:02] i've got a good buddy a pastor of mine
[50:05] and
[50:05] he's he's he can be kind of funny and he
[50:07] said you know he said there's certain
[50:09] ones
[50:10] you just don't ask to pray over the
[50:11] dinner he said because after they're
[50:13] done he says it's cold he said you want
[50:15] to tell him hey you're going to pray
[50:16] like that you pray at home
[50:20] you just you pray ask god's blessing so
[50:22] we can eat thank god
[50:23] for what's been provided so there's a
[50:26] there's an element of things and i i
[50:28] don't even weigh in
[50:29] and even that that brother was not
[50:31] saying it in the sense that this
[50:32] individual is trying to draw
[50:34] attention to himself but i think we have
[50:36] to understand
[50:37] the things that are even at hand and
[50:39] here when we're praying as as the lord
[50:41] jesus said
[50:42] it's not to be seen but that they that
[50:46] not to be seen amen because they have
[50:48] the reward he says but when you
[50:49] pray enter into thy closet and when thou
[50:53] has shut the
[50:54] door pray to the father which is in
[50:56] secret
[50:57] and thy father which is in secret or
[51:00] seeth in secret
[51:01] shall reward thee openly you see we're
[51:04] not
[51:04] the pharisees they sought honor of one
[51:07] another
[51:08] they sought praise of men they wanted to
[51:11] make sure what they did
[51:12] that everybody knew about it and somehow
[51:15] people would esteem them more righteous
[51:18] and
[51:18] more spiritual and everything but see
[51:20] this is contrary
[51:22] to the very working and nature of
[51:25] almighty god
[51:26] because look how when god when god comes
[51:28] in every age
[51:30] even when they came to the prophet and
[51:32] said why don't you come out here you
[51:33] know the los angeles why don't you come
[51:35] out to these places
[51:36] and wanting him even writing many times
[51:39] large sums of money
[51:41] come stand with us and you'll never have
[51:43] a one in your life you just got to
[51:45] compromise
[51:46] on a few things but remember the
[51:48] response
[51:49] that the spirit of the lord gave through
[51:51] the prophet he said
[51:52] it never has the gospel went to the big
[51:55] nerve centers it goes to the simple
[51:59] it goes to those who are desiring this
[52:02] gospel it's went
[52:03] around the world but it's never went and
[52:06] never
[52:06] intended to go to the nerve centers it
[52:09] has went
[52:10] to the hearts that are hungry and
[52:12] desiring to know god
[52:14] in a real relationship in a real
[52:16] personal way and there's a life
[52:18] to be lived the life of a in a life of a
[52:22] believer
[52:22] is not to be recognized by others
[52:26] but i the praise oh my there's no
[52:28] greater praise that we could have
[52:30] than to get along with god and his
[52:33] presence come into the room
[52:35] i think there's nothing greater you know
[52:37] when they're there
[52:38] and many times whether it's in prayer or
[52:40] just meditation
[52:42] here his presence comes and he begins to
[52:44] reveal
[52:45] things and begins to minister things
[52:47] that's the greatest presence that's the
[52:49] greatest reward it's just to be able to
[52:52] step away
[52:53] from ourselves because listen the time
[52:55] that is spent
[52:56] along with god oh brother and sister
[52:59] there is
[53:00] a reward that is wreath from a life that
[53:02] is spent before god
[53:04] brother graham said many times when it
[53:06] came to those of martin and they would
[53:08] see the miracles and martin's ministry
[53:10] he said many were looking just at what
[53:12] was taking place
[53:13] in martin's ministry but they failed to
[53:16] recognize the sacrificial life
[53:18] that was behind the scenes it takes a
[53:20] sacrificial life
[53:22] with god but it's not something that we
[53:24] put out there of
[53:25] well you know i've listened to three
[53:27] tapes today and you know i've done this
[53:29] and i've done that
[53:31] nobody's interested in all that you've
[53:33] done and you've prayed five hours
[53:35] that's not glorying anybody but you
[53:39] hallelujah there's sometimes where
[53:41] there's certain details
[53:42] that need to be left out are you with me
[53:46] because it isn't bringing any glory to
[53:49] god
[53:49] it's bringing glory to self
[53:53] and believe me you don't have to prove
[53:55] anything to anybody
[53:57] you don't have to prove about your time
[53:59] or anything like that so
[54:00] you just as we stand there we don't want
[54:02] the enemy
[54:03] to draw us out into those places see
[54:06] here's
[54:06] here's here's the pharisees in this time
[54:09] the bible
[54:10] says in matthew 23 verse 5
[54:13] but all their works this is what jesus
[54:15] said all their works
[54:17] they do for to be seen of men
[54:21] they make broad their philanthropies and
[54:24] enlarge the borders
[54:26] of their garments and love the uppermost
[54:29] rooms at feast and the chief seats
[54:32] in the synagogues and greetings in the
[54:34] markings
[54:35] and to be called of men rabbi rabbi
[54:39] this is what they love their whole
[54:41] delight
[54:42] is in position before people it's
[54:46] it's to appear within a certain way and
[54:49] to think of
[54:49] when we look at this their whole works
[54:52] is to be seen amen
[54:53] you know when it speaks here of this of
[54:55] the philanthropies the widening of the
[54:57] garment
[54:57] these were things writings that were of
[55:00] specific
[55:01] scriptures that were written out you
[55:03] remember how david would say you know
[55:05] uh let it be upon my eyes or the
[55:07] frontlets upon my eyes and
[55:08] david would speak of those things in the
[55:10] psalms and here they would take
[55:12] of you know leather straps and little
[55:14] boxes and they would
[55:16] write certain writings and they would
[55:18] have it upon a band it would dangle down
[55:20] also have it around their garment and it
[55:23] would be these things that would dangle
[55:25] down and all of this it was it was to be
[55:29] something that would be
[55:30] and when engaged in prayer was to be
[55:33] held
[55:34] over the left arm and fastened there
[55:36] even to the forehead
[55:37] but notice how jesus said they're
[55:40] enlarging
[55:41] their philanthropies they're enlarging
[55:43] the border of their garments
[55:45] and here here as it makes known they
[55:48] these things were done
[55:49] just to make themselves more conspicuous
[55:53] they wanted themselves to stand out a
[55:55] little bit more
[55:57] you see something that would have been
[55:59] fine would have been
[56:00] writing with scripture who would have
[56:02] been fight but their desire
[56:04] in doing what they did was to kind of
[56:06] set themselves
[56:07] apart from the rest of the people as
[56:10] though that they were more righteous let
[56:12] me tell you something
[56:13] if there's anything that that causes a
[56:16] separation
[56:17] other than the word i'm talking about
[56:19] even a self-righteous attitude
[56:21] it's not of god there's nothing that
[56:25] should work
[56:25] in that way as though i'm gonna set
[56:27] myself up above the people or i'm going
[56:29] to
[56:30] do this or i'm going to show that i'm a
[56:32] little bit more holy or
[56:33] i'm a little bit more righteous but you
[56:35] see if it's knowledge
[56:36] just that knowledge that's that's here
[56:38] of the earth just from that that cometh
[56:40] from the word
[56:41] then brother it'll never bring come with
[56:43] it with real humility
[56:45] but when it is that which god is
[56:47] sovereignly revealed
[56:49] it's something that comes to your heart
[56:51] you recognize
[56:52] it comes with humility it comes with a
[56:55] real mercy and a real grace and you
[56:57] stand there recognizing that it's not me
[57:00] that is that has opened this or showed
[57:03] myself this
[57:04] this is the grace of god
[57:08] you see when paul think of paul when he
[57:11] would come amongst
[57:12] the people look how brother branham
[57:14] would emphasize this
[57:16] the spirit of god would take us to this
[57:18] this place in the scripture
[57:19] over and over here was paul a great man
[57:22] and he's coming to the corinthians and
[57:25] paul would say
[57:26] in this manner i was determined to know
[57:29] nothing among you
[57:30] save jesus christ and him crucified
[57:34] he said it was with you in weakness and
[57:36] fear and great trembling
[57:38] because his desire was that their faith
[57:41] would not stand in
[57:42] him as far as the man but it would be
[57:45] the operation of the holy spirit
[57:48] coming through that word that their
[57:50] faith would stand in the power of
[57:52] almighty god
[57:53] he was a great man he was a man that
[57:56] could speak
[57:56] many different languages here was a man
[57:59] whom god
[58:00] had opened his word to and had given to
[58:04] him and commissioned him
[58:06] to take the word to the gentiles listen
[58:09] paul had paul had an opening that
[58:11] superseded
[58:12] all the rest of the disciples the rest
[58:15] of them knew him by flesh
[58:17] and of course at pentecost they had to
[58:19] have that reality in that experience
[58:21] but paul did not know him in the flesh
[58:24] paul
[58:25] knew him by revelation it was it was
[58:29] the very same god that came and revealed
[58:32] to paul
[58:33] that of the law now here is the
[58:35] fulfillment in jesus christ you see what
[58:38] that revelation did for paul
[58:40] it brought such a rest to paul that paul
[58:42] himself he was not troubled about
[58:44] keeping
[58:45] holy days or keeping this paul could say
[58:48] it's all been met
[58:49] in jesus christ that's the reality of
[58:52] what divine revelation does
[58:54] it brings rest it brings peace
[58:58] it brings strength it brings life and it
[59:00] brings the glory of god
[59:02] that reflects it all back on him that
[59:05] he's the one
[59:06] that has done this all
[59:09] see paul here he was standing in this in
[59:11] this time and paul would come and i
[59:14] just want to refer to a few places here
[59:16] in the scripture and paul as he would
[59:19] come into
[59:20] galatians galatians 6 i believe i
[59:22] included that
[59:23] in galatians 6 verse 12. you remember
[59:25] here's a group of believers
[59:27] galat the the the galatian people and
[59:29] here
[59:30] here you have men that come among them
[59:34] and are wanting to take the these
[59:36] individuals
[59:37] and take them back under the law as
[59:40] though that
[59:41] faith in christ is not enough as though
[59:44] the working of the holy spirit coming
[59:47] that promise as though that that's not
[59:48] enough
[59:49] that you have to do other things on top
[59:52] of it
[59:52] and here the spirit of god it comes to
[59:55] discern that because these
[59:57] men had come and troubled the the
[1:00:00] the church there in galatia and notice
[1:00:02] what the spirit of god
[1:00:04] as it discerns these things it says in
[1:00:06] galatians 6
[1:00:07] 12 as many as desire to make a fair
[1:00:11] show in the flesh they constrain you to
[1:00:14] be
[1:00:14] circumcised only lest they should suffer
[1:00:18] persecution for the cross notice their
[1:00:20] desire
[1:00:22] is to make a show of you in the flesh
[1:00:25] for they neither themselves uh who are
[1:00:28] circumcised keep the law
[1:00:30] but desire to have you circumcised that
[1:00:33] they make glory
[1:00:34] in your flesh so after they pass through
[1:00:38] galatia
[1:00:39] their whole coming i hope you see this
[1:00:41] their whole going to galatia
[1:00:43] had nothing to do with the welfare of
[1:00:47] the people
[1:00:49] their whole coming to galatia was to try
[1:00:52] to draw
[1:00:52] people according to their thoughts or
[1:00:55] their of where they were standing
[1:00:58] still there under the law and hear where
[1:01:00] they're standing they're wanting to draw
[1:01:02] the people there
[1:01:03] and when it's all said and done their
[1:01:05] glory was that people
[1:01:07] that the people would receive
[1:01:09] circumcision in the flesh i'm talking
[1:01:11] about the males
[1:01:12] that they would receive that it was for
[1:01:14] no other purpose it was not for the
[1:01:16] glory of god
[1:01:18] it was about their own agenda
[1:01:22] oh my this is a very serious thing you
[1:01:25] see
[1:01:25] god forbid notice how paul said god
[1:01:28] forbid that
[1:01:28] i should glory saving the cross of our
[1:01:31] lord jesus christ
[1:01:33] by whom the world is crucified unto me
[1:01:35] and i
[1:01:36] unto the world for in christ jesus
[1:01:39] neither circumcision availeth anything
[1:01:42] nor uncircumcision but a new
[1:01:45] creature now jesus says it like this
[1:01:48] he says my doctrine is not mine but his
[1:01:52] that set me
[1:01:52] if any man will do his will he shall
[1:01:55] know of the doctrine whether it is of
[1:01:57] god
[1:01:57] or whether i speak of myself he that
[1:02:00] speaketh of himself
[1:02:02] seeketh his own glory but he that
[1:02:04] seeketh his glory
[1:02:06] that sent him the same is true and no
[1:02:10] unrighteousness is in him
[1:02:14] now when you think how paul
[1:02:18] would have would come would have to come
[1:02:21] within that
[1:02:22] in galatia paul would also
[1:02:25] uh have to set things forth even when it
[1:02:28] would come
[1:02:29] into the church in in corinth and things
[1:02:31] that were taking place
[1:02:33] even among the body paul would address
[1:02:35] certain things in timothy
[1:02:36] you see when god is is trying to work
[1:02:40] there's always that of the satan who
[1:02:42] wants to come
[1:02:43] in in in in as an adversary
[1:02:46] to come and try to disturb the work of
[1:02:49] almighty god
[1:02:50] but you see the thing how paul would
[1:02:53] come
[1:02:54] and he would speak now to uh
[1:02:57] write this in the romans and it applies
[1:02:59] to so many other places
[1:03:00] here in the scripture when paul he could
[1:03:03] say
[1:03:04] in in the corinthians there and i want
[1:03:05] you to think of this
[1:03:07] when paul could write to the corinthians
[1:03:09] and say
[1:03:10] you are the seal of mine apostleship
[1:03:14] he could say your the testimony of
[1:03:17] christ
[1:03:17] is confirmed in you he could go
[1:03:21] on and paul could say in this and
[1:03:24] emphatically
[1:03:25] if an angel from heaven or anyone
[1:03:28] else comes and preaches any other gospel
[1:03:31] unto you
[1:03:32] let him be a curse you see paul was
[1:03:35] paul was putting the absolute authority
[1:03:39] in the revelation of jesus christ and
[1:03:41] paul could stand there
[1:03:43] he wasn't bragging on himself he wasn't
[1:03:46] vaunting
[1:03:46] he was letting the people know what you
[1:03:49] have received
[1:03:50] is the word of god and that's what jesus
[1:03:53] was saying
[1:03:54] if man will do the will of god he'll
[1:03:56] know whether the doctrine is of me
[1:03:59] or it's of my father why because a
[1:04:01] man-made
[1:04:02] doctrine produces man-made children
[1:04:06] but that which comes from god it
[1:04:08] produces god
[1:04:09] because it's not the ingenuity and the
[1:04:12] doctrine of man
[1:04:13] it's god's seed it's god's life it's the
[1:04:17] gospel of jesus christ
[1:04:18] producing itself in the lives of the
[1:04:20] people and paul could have this you see
[1:04:23] there's a need for this there was a need
[1:04:26] for these things even for paul
[1:04:28] to come into a place and say in romans
[1:04:30] 11 verse 13
[1:04:32] for i speak to you gentiles inasmuch as
[1:04:35] i
[1:04:35] am the apostle of the gentiles i magnify
[1:04:39] my office if by any means i may provoke
[1:04:43] to emulation
[1:04:44] them which are uh them which are my
[1:04:47] flesh
[1:04:47] and might save some of them
[1:04:50] paul when he would write of this this
[1:04:53] was an authority
[1:04:54] that he would remind this is an
[1:04:57] authority that god has given me
[1:04:59] but he wasn't walking around as a
[1:05:01] braggart
[1:05:02] it was letting him know this is what god
[1:05:05] has done
[1:05:06] paul wasn't ashamed to acknowledge what
[1:05:09] god has done
[1:05:10] the position that god had placed him in
[1:05:13] and paul said the reason he says even
[1:05:15] within this that i may provoke some
[1:05:17] of my own kindred to emulation that in
[1:05:20] other words
[1:05:21] they would be stirred up to even look
[1:05:24] into the glorious
[1:05:25] revelation that god has given in this
[1:05:28] time you see
[1:05:29] the desire is that others would be
[1:05:31] provoked
[1:05:32] would be stirred to look into the things
[1:05:34] of almighty god
[1:05:36] because it's a great wonderful thing of
[1:05:38] what god has done
[1:05:41] now you find where paul as he would come
[1:05:44] there were men that were coming along
[1:05:47] through there
[1:05:49] false you know they're false apostles
[1:05:52] paul called them false apostles
[1:05:54] false workers deceivers dogs
[1:05:58] paul went on and on and laid it all out
[1:06:01] because they had a they had an objective
[1:06:05] and an agenda that was from hell
[1:06:08] the agenda was is to get people to
[1:06:11] follow them
[1:06:12] brother brown simply put it like this he
[1:06:15] said that spirit of trying to outdo one
[1:06:17] another
[1:06:18] he said it's a spirit of organization
[1:06:21] a spirit that wants to outdo this one or
[1:06:24] out do that one or out do this one
[1:06:25] you know we've seen that in the natural
[1:06:27] you take somebody in the family has a
[1:06:29] wedding that somebody else wants to i'll
[1:06:31] do that with him
[1:06:32] i mean if this one had limos they're
[1:06:34] going to have chariots and it's just out
[1:06:36] trying to outdo one another
[1:06:37] and besides putting themselves to debt
[1:06:39] you know there's a lot of things and
[1:06:41] people can see through all of that
[1:06:43] you know the thing of it is is just that
[1:06:46] that to rest
[1:06:47] in the reality of what god has done in
[1:06:49] our life what he's called us to
[1:06:51] that's that's that's think worthy right
[1:06:53] there thank you lord
[1:06:55] for what you've called me to if god just
[1:06:58] to be what god
[1:06:59] has called you to be that's why paul
[1:07:00] said let every man abide in the same
[1:07:03] calling wherein he was
[1:07:04] called so
[1:07:09] when we see this paul as he's as he
[1:07:12] deals with this here in second
[1:07:13] corinthians 11.
[1:07:15] he speaks to the to the corinthian
[1:07:17] church and he says
[1:07:18] let no man think me as a fool if
[1:07:21] otherwise
[1:07:22] yet as a fool receive me though i may
[1:07:25] boast myself a little that which i speak
[1:07:27] i speak it not after the lord
[1:07:30] but as it were foolishly in this
[1:07:32] confidence of boasting
[1:07:34] seeing that many glory after the flesh
[1:07:37] i will glory also paul goes on within
[1:07:40] this passage of scripture
[1:07:42] and it begins to deal with things
[1:07:44] concerning
[1:07:45] there am i not a hebrew and begins to
[1:07:49] deal with things that has transpired
[1:07:51] and taken place even in his life in that
[1:07:54] of the ministry
[1:07:55] now you would look at it and paul he
[1:07:57] recognizes this
[1:07:58] even in what he set forth to the people
[1:08:01] that
[1:08:01] you know the the foolishness of boasting
[1:08:04] but you see
[1:08:05] there were those who had come around and
[1:08:07] were trying to
[1:08:08] present themselves as though they they
[1:08:11] were somebody
[1:08:12] and you see the reality is is that
[1:08:15] anytime
[1:08:16] somebody has to put themselves as
[1:08:18] somebody
[1:08:19] or try to prove themselves they're
[1:08:21] missing the proof that comes from god
[1:08:23] because a man and himself
[1:08:25] listen friends this is not something
[1:08:27] that a man has to prove to somebody else
[1:08:29] that when when a man is called of god
[1:08:32] and positioned of god
[1:08:33] let me tell you something if that man's
[1:08:35] called there's people
[1:08:37] that'll hear what god has to say through
[1:08:39] that individual
[1:08:40] that man doesn't have to prove anything
[1:08:43] to nobody
[1:08:44] god is our proof that's why god told
[1:08:47] joshua
[1:08:48] this day i will magnify thee
[1:08:51] before the people god let him know i'll
[1:08:54] do the work why
[1:08:55] he wasn't to exalt joshua the man
[1:08:58] but it was that the people would be
[1:09:00] comforted by
[1:09:02] seeing the leadership of the holy spirit
[1:09:05] of the word coming through
[1:09:06] joshua and that's what brings comfort to
[1:09:09] the hearts of the people
[1:09:10] you know you and i there's times that
[1:09:12] you can get discouraged sometimes
[1:09:14] let's just look at it there's things
[1:09:16] sometimes that even
[1:09:17] we can become common to one another but
[1:09:20] when we look and say
[1:09:21] i'm not looking to brother samuel or
[1:09:23] looking to anybody
[1:09:24] else i'm looking to you lord and father
[1:09:27] that you will come and speak to me
[1:09:29] that you'll come minister to my knee and
[1:09:31] when you're able to move into that
[1:09:33] channel and you recognize
[1:09:34] it's not the man it's not brother samuel
[1:09:37] leading us it's the word who is leading
[1:09:40] us
[1:09:41] it's to have confidence in him who is
[1:09:43] the word who's in our midst hallelujah
[1:09:48] this is why when paul
[1:09:50] you know as he would write concerning it
[1:09:52] and he said if there's one thing i'm
[1:09:53] going to glory
[1:09:54] in in that same passage of scripture
[1:09:58] if i must needs glory i will glory of
[1:10:00] the things which concern
[1:10:02] mine infirmities so you know in
[1:10:06] weaknesses
[1:10:07] now i don't think there's anybody here
[1:10:08] that would want to boast of our
[1:10:11] weaknesses
[1:10:12] paul's not boasting of the weaknesses so
[1:10:15] much
[1:10:16] but what paul is glorying in
[1:10:19] is that through the infirmities the
[1:10:22] weaknesses one of that of where paul
[1:10:24] his eyesight would come and go you would
[1:10:28] find where paul would say
[1:10:29] i'm writing with large letters to you
[1:10:32] he would he would speak of those things
[1:10:34] there was infirmities things that that
[1:10:36] was
[1:10:36] encompassed about within himself his
[1:10:40] bodies we're not talking about sin now
[1:10:42] we're talking about that weakness and
[1:10:44] things that would
[1:10:45] show up you see what weaknesses do
[1:10:48] when things come our way and tester
[1:10:51] trials or or situations you know
[1:10:54] and it might been a long time maybe
[1:10:55] since maybe you've never felt
[1:10:57] certain pain maybe you you know you've
[1:10:59] looked at things and said well i don't
[1:11:01] know why
[1:11:01] you know so and so such and in such pain
[1:11:03] or whatever more
[1:11:04] well maybe you've never been to that
[1:11:06] degree of pain
[1:11:08] but you let you let yourself get to that
[1:11:10] degree of pain
[1:11:11] you have more sympathy with somebody
[1:11:13] else when a prayer request comes in
[1:11:15] you'll pray a little bit different than
[1:11:17] what you did before
[1:11:18] you won't be praying with the thought of
[1:11:20] why don't they just take tylenol
[1:11:22] you'll be praying and recognizing lord i
[1:11:25] remember that
[1:11:26] pain that i was in lord jesus father
[1:11:28] will you go
[1:11:29] and minister to them paul said our glory
[1:11:32] and mind infirmities why
[1:11:34] because the infirmities those things
[1:11:37] that it
[1:11:37] showed up or that had brought forth the
[1:11:41] weaknesses
[1:11:42] that were there that had brought him to
[1:11:44] a weakened place
[1:11:45] why would he glory because in that time
[1:11:48] of weakness
[1:11:48] god could be strong this is what paul
[1:11:52] was glorying in paul was not saying
[1:11:54] praise god i got bronchitis praise god i
[1:11:57] got this that's not what it's saying
[1:11:58] paul was recognizing here in a time of
[1:12:01] weakness
[1:12:02] it was a time that god was able to step
[1:12:04] forward
[1:12:05] and paul can recognize you know what it
[1:12:07] does every time in our life
[1:12:09] it makes us aware of our need and our
[1:12:11] dependency
[1:12:12] upon almighty god
[1:12:16] god knows how to keep us trapped down
[1:12:19] not beat down but tap down
[1:12:22] you see this is why when the scripture
[1:12:24] says
[1:12:26] in proverbs 25 verse 14 whoso boasteth
[1:12:30] himself
[1:12:31] of a false gift is like clouds and wind
[1:12:34] without rain
[1:12:37] see the false part is making something
[1:12:40] that it really isn't
[1:12:43] and somebody has to embellish it
[1:12:46] they have to make it something that it's
[1:12:48] not
[1:12:50] let me just say this a true gift
[1:12:53] does not need embellishment
[1:12:57] a true gift doesn't need the recognition
[1:13:00] of
[1:13:00] man is that right it doesn't need
[1:13:04] that it don't need no other glory than
[1:13:07] just the glory of the lord that has come
[1:13:09] to use it there's things you realize
[1:13:12] when you look at even the nine spiritual
[1:13:14] gifts
[1:13:16] all of those things must be checked by
[1:13:18] the word right
[1:13:20] are you hearing me it must be checked by
[1:13:22] the word
[1:13:24] so even within these things that we look
[1:13:26] at it here
[1:13:28] as we look there's things that brother
[1:13:30] brown will give us the examples i've
[1:13:31] seen
[1:13:32] it right here within the assembly of
[1:13:34] things that you're not even aware of
[1:13:36] you don't even know but god has laid
[1:13:38] something on this person's heart
[1:13:40] and this person here here they just may
[1:13:42] be called to encourage somebody else
[1:13:44] perhaps god has used you and you know
[1:13:46] what when it's all said and done
[1:13:48] you're just thankful god thank you that
[1:13:50] the lord that i could be used and nobody
[1:13:52] knows anything about it
[1:13:54] maybe your husband does maybe your wife
[1:13:56] does but other than that
[1:13:57] nobody knows anything about it when the
[1:14:00] woman prayed
[1:14:01] when she was pressed by the spirit of
[1:14:03] god in that service
[1:14:04] to pray for that little baby remember
[1:14:07] she didn't want to do it
[1:14:08] she said well she's that sister she's
[1:14:10] here to you know to
[1:14:12] to go on the platform and brother braham
[1:14:13] is going to pray for it but the spirit
[1:14:15] of god said
[1:14:16] go and let ask her ask to ask the mother
[1:14:19] today if you could pray for her
[1:14:21] and when that woman she went and she
[1:14:23] prayed for that little baby
[1:14:24] when when the woman then came into the
[1:14:27] prayer line the spirit of god
[1:14:29] spoke through the prophet and said
[1:14:30] sister your your baby
[1:14:33] was already healed there was a sister
[1:14:35] out here
[1:14:36] that prayed for they're your child and
[1:14:38] brother man will pick it up and he says
[1:14:40] see what it is
[1:14:41] he said it was a mother that prayed for
[1:14:44] that child
[1:14:44] and she would have way more sympathy for
[1:14:47] that child
[1:14:48] than what i can ever enter into
[1:14:50] [Applause]
[1:14:52] but nobody would have ever known it
[1:14:55] right
[1:14:56] i'm sure that woman didn't put a trumpet
[1:14:59] outside
[1:15:01] champion she didn't set up a table next
[1:15:03] to where the books were at
[1:15:04] and the pictures
[1:15:07] come on now she didn't there was not
[1:15:10] there was not anything about
[1:15:12] nobody would have known anything
[1:15:15] but it just goes to show us how
[1:15:17] sovereignly god can work
[1:15:18] and you know what it shows me it shows
[1:15:21] me that the more
[1:15:22] there are times for testimonies but
[1:15:24] there's times that how god
[1:15:26] tests us to see how are we going to
[1:15:29] handle
[1:15:29] what he's given to us if we handle in a
[1:15:32] way that we've got to tell
[1:15:34] everybody and do this i'm telling you
[1:15:36] god will pull back
[1:15:37] because he will not share his glory with
[1:15:40] no one
[1:15:41] god doesn't want you or me looking to
[1:15:44] anybody
[1:15:44] but him
[1:15:48] amen that's true you see even in this
[1:15:51] here
[1:15:52] the bible says it like this concerning
[1:15:54] even that of the office of the high
[1:15:56] priest
[1:15:56] in hebrews 5 verse 4 no man taketh this
[1:16:00] honor unto himself speaking of becoming
[1:16:02] high priest
[1:16:03] but he that is called of god as was
[1:16:05] aaron
[1:16:06] so also christ glorified
[1:16:09] not himself to be made and high priest
[1:16:14] he did not glorify himself to be made a
[1:16:17] high priest
[1:16:19] but he that said unto him thou art my
[1:16:22] son today
[1:16:23] have i begun thee who gave him his
[1:16:26] position
[1:16:27] the word the word gave him his position
[1:16:31] he did not glorify himself he did not
[1:16:34] take this
[1:16:35] upon himself this was allotted it was
[1:16:38] given to him
[1:16:40] the scriptures are familiar with this
[1:16:42] one a man's gift
[1:16:45] maketh room for him and bringeth him
[1:16:48] before
[1:16:49] great men what does
[1:16:52] a gift but it maketh room
[1:16:55] for him you know simply put
[1:16:59] if the man is to preach more often the
[1:17:02] gift will make room for that
[1:17:07] the gift makes room for what god has
[1:17:09] called it to be
[1:17:11] and the gift itself it'll bring them
[1:17:13] before great men
[1:17:15] it'll bring them it won't be the gift
[1:17:16] that's yielded to god and god brings it
[1:17:19] into position
[1:17:20] as god chooses to use it i mean think
[1:17:23] look at look at brother adams look at
[1:17:25] brother branham's life
[1:17:27] and you think of how within his life
[1:17:30] seventh grade education not even that
[1:17:34] and how that even within brother battle
[1:17:36] he didn't want to be a preacher
[1:17:38] just tell you the truth when you look in
[1:17:39] the brotherhood didn't want to be a
[1:17:41] christian
[1:17:43] are you with me you see this even when
[1:17:45] you have something going the opposite
[1:17:47] way
[1:17:48] you know as we've been looking at it
[1:17:50] took god to deal
[1:17:51] and god to turn that heart and that
[1:17:53] nature
[1:17:54] it took god to really bring about a real
[1:17:57] softening of his heart
[1:17:58] to bring and bring that life to a place
[1:18:00] of surrender
[1:18:01] but it was all a work of almighty god
[1:18:04] brother branham never sought for those
[1:18:06] things he never went for that place
[1:18:08] right there
[1:18:09] it was god who was moving in his life to
[1:18:12] bring him into these places
[1:18:14] did you see just as god worked there
[1:18:17] with the prophet's life
[1:18:18] that's the same way in our life as the
[1:18:20] bride of jesus christ
[1:18:22] this is why even in the revealing of the
[1:18:24] word
[1:18:25] when the prophet speaks to us and he
[1:18:26] says pray for revelation
[1:18:28] what's the motive in praying for
[1:18:30] revelation the real motive is to pray
[1:18:33] and say oh god i just want to be closer
[1:18:36] to you
[1:18:36] lord lord revealing your will lord
[1:18:39] revealing your word
[1:18:40] what a precious reality that is when god
[1:18:44] would speak to our hearts
[1:18:46] it's gone moving in such a simple way
[1:18:49] it's not a desire to vaunt ourselves
[1:18:51] it's a desire that he would be glorified
[1:18:54] because when that word is revealed
[1:18:56] there's a
[1:18:56] supernatural power there's a
[1:18:58] supernatural strength
[1:18:59] that's released through that word that
[1:19:01] our lives take on the very
[1:19:03] image of that word itself
[1:19:07] here you find ram you know in the dreams
[1:19:10] here was
[1:19:11] you know leo and just
[1:19:14] just how said leo in this dream of the
[1:19:18] of the pyramid
[1:19:22] how this this brother he had a dream
[1:19:26] and it was it was about a pyramid and
[1:19:27] brother brown would say it like this
[1:19:29] in in the message greatest battle i
[1:19:31] don't have it there i'm just going to
[1:19:32] refer to it
[1:19:33] he said you thought you'd come up up in
[1:19:36] there talking about
[1:19:37] uh brother leo mercer thought he would
[1:19:39] come up into that pyramid
[1:19:41] pyramid into that place and he said leo
[1:19:44] no man gets up here god has to put a man
[1:19:47] up here
[1:19:48] you climbed every physical realm that
[1:19:51] could be climbed
[1:19:52] said you can't come here leo go back
[1:19:54] down and just tell the people
[1:19:56] that it comes from god i think there's
[1:19:59] no greater privilege
[1:20:01] than to come to the place that god god
[1:20:04] would bring us to
[1:20:05] and it brings us to a place of assurance
[1:20:07] to declare
[1:20:08] that indeed this word is of god
[1:20:13] and you see it isn't the man's word
[1:20:15] having an effect
[1:20:16] it's god's word that has an effect if
[1:20:19] it's staying with that word it brings
[1:20:20] the effect of almighty god
[1:20:22] upon the people and in the lives of the
[1:20:24] people
[1:20:25] what a blessed thing it is just to say
[1:20:28] this is of god
[1:20:30] i tell you that that ought to be such a
[1:20:33] such an encouragement
[1:20:34] it's it's not about that you and i can
[1:20:36] explain things
[1:20:39] it's it's it's what what's greater is is
[1:20:41] that you know from your soul
[1:20:43] it's thus saith the lord
[1:20:46] it's thus saith the lord you know this
[1:20:49] is the word of almighty god
[1:20:53] paul would go on and say it in this
[1:20:56] manner
[1:20:58] and i may just just refer to a few of
[1:20:59] these these places here
[1:21:02] how paul would write speak of this in
[1:21:04] 2nd corinthians 12
[1:21:06] verse 1 it's it is not expedient for me
[1:21:09] doubtless to glory i will come to
[1:21:12] visions
[1:21:13] and revelations of the lord now paul's
[1:21:16] going in
[1:21:16] and you some of this is a familiar
[1:21:18] passage where paul would write of this
[1:21:21] and
[1:21:21] and he would say i knew a man in christ
[1:21:24] above 14 years ago
[1:21:25] whether in the body i cannot tell or
[1:21:27] whether out of the body i cannot tell
[1:21:28] god knoweth
[1:21:29] such a one caught up to the third heaven
[1:21:32] and i knew
[1:21:33] such a man whether in the body or out of
[1:21:35] the body i cannot tell
[1:21:36] god knoweth how that he was caught up
[1:21:39] into paradise
[1:21:40] and heard unspeakable words which is not
[1:21:42] lawful
[1:21:43] for a man to utter of such a one will i
[1:21:47] glory yet of myself i will not glory
[1:21:51] but in mine infirmities for though i
[1:21:54] would
[1:21:54] desire to glory i shall not be a fool
[1:21:58] i want you to look at that we can really
[1:21:59] preach on that paul said though i would
[1:22:02] desire to glory
[1:22:03] there's a part that still remains there
[1:22:05] in the flesh
[1:22:06] and paul was able to catch that and say
[1:22:09] i'm not going to go
[1:22:10] in that direction with this
[1:22:14] because listen remember the scripture
[1:22:16] they that are christ
[1:22:17] have crucified they that are christ
[1:22:20] have crucified the flesh with the
[1:22:23] affections and lust thereof
[1:22:26] it's crucified the enemy can try to come
[1:22:29] but it's crucified it's dead it's to him
[1:22:33] that we live and paul could say though
[1:22:36] he says
[1:22:36] i would desire to glory i shall not be a
[1:22:39] fool
[1:22:40] for i will say the truth but now i
[1:22:42] forbear
[1:22:43] lest any man should think of me above
[1:22:46] that which he seeth me to be
[1:22:48] or that he heareth of me
[1:22:54] remember brother brown in the visions
[1:22:57] the first pull
[1:22:59] second pull and even in the third the
[1:23:01] third pull
[1:23:04] when it comes into that part of even on
[1:23:06] the second pole and this is what comes
[1:23:07] to me right now
[1:23:09] remember here he is he's fishing for
[1:23:11] that rainbow trout
[1:23:13] are you with me god is showing through
[1:23:16] that vision there
[1:23:17] how he brings a son to maturity
[1:23:21] and here he stands in the midst of that
[1:23:23] time and brethren get around him and say
[1:23:25] oh brother branham's a great fisherman
[1:23:27] brother branham's a great fisherman
[1:23:28] oh my he can really catch the fish and
[1:23:31] about that time old brother brandon pull
[1:23:33] the hook
[1:23:34] he pulls it and when he does there's a
[1:23:37] fish
[1:23:38] that just is like the skin over the hook
[1:23:42] and the angel of the lord told him and
[1:23:44] said what did i tell you
[1:23:47] don't listen to those men
[1:23:50] you see the word it was bringing a test
[1:23:53] it was trying
[1:23:54] and let it be known that don't go by the
[1:23:57] other parts
[1:23:58] of a person don't go by what others are
[1:24:00] saying
[1:24:02] we're not looking at what others are
[1:24:03] saying we look to what god says
[1:24:06] you see it's training and god brings us
[1:24:08] into that we don't all of a sudden come
[1:24:10] to that
[1:24:10] my you know here we are born again and
[1:24:12] my we've got everything down patent
[1:24:15] never no mistakes that's why we need the
[1:24:17] blood of jesus christ
[1:24:19] because we do make mistakes there's
[1:24:21] times that we can
[1:24:23] all say and if you don't see it allow
[1:24:25] the spirit of god to show it out
[1:24:26] when we have wanted
[1:24:31] but we have wanted but you see the
[1:24:33] spirit of god when he makes it known to
[1:24:35] us
[1:24:36] it's there to show you and i hey
[1:24:39] this is not a part of that character and
[1:24:42] god's doing it in a
[1:24:43] measure that we could yield ourselves to
[1:24:45] him be molded that our character be
[1:24:48] molded because listen
[1:24:49] in every molding in every situation god
[1:24:52] is preparing us
[1:24:53] for another junction
[1:24:59] oh glory be to god hallelujah i like
[1:25:02] that how paul says
[1:25:03] it's doubtless to me to glory i will
[1:25:05] come to visions and revelations of the
[1:25:07] lord
[1:25:08] you see this would be just like as a
[1:25:10] father of the house the father could say
[1:25:14] it's doubtless that god will come and
[1:25:17] visit
[1:25:19] and he will reveal to me the things
[1:25:22] his will for my home for my for the
[1:25:26] leading
[1:25:26] of the household it's god who gives
[1:25:30] that bleeding that's not bragging
[1:25:33] but it's recognizing lord i need you
[1:25:37] just trying to get here to a place
[1:25:42] just let me just continue to move down
[1:25:44] through here there's a place i want to
[1:25:45] get to
[1:25:48] in many other scriptures but i just want
[1:25:50] to move ahead
[1:25:54] paul could announce to the people who
[1:25:55] were there
[1:25:57] with us in galatia
[1:26:00] timothy and corinthians
[1:26:03] and he could say even as we referred to
[1:26:06] some of those statements before
[1:26:08] it says i'm not behind of the chiefest
[1:26:10] apostles
[1:26:13] paul could make the statement of how
[1:26:15] that even when he came there among some
[1:26:17] they hadn't they had not they didn't
[1:26:19] even know paul
[1:26:21] but when paul came among them and he
[1:26:23] began to speak and begin to minister the
[1:26:26] word
[1:26:27] and share that gospel that god
[1:26:30] had committed to his trust paul said
[1:26:32] they glorified god
[1:26:34] in me the people were able to see
[1:26:39] it was god that was at work even
[1:26:42] remember when they
[1:26:43] there were different ones that because
[1:26:45] of idolatry
[1:26:46] and they could see the working of the
[1:26:48] supernatural but they wanted to make it
[1:26:50] as though paul was a god
[1:26:52] but paul being a man of god he would not
[1:26:55] allow them he says stand up you don't
[1:26:57] don't worship me
[1:26:58] it's god that's doing the work
[1:27:01] so in everything when when paul would
[1:27:04] come in this manner here it was showing
[1:27:06] that declaration this is the work of
[1:27:09] almighty god
[1:27:11] i think of brother branham many
[1:27:12] different places i was just
[1:27:14] looking at this over the time and
[1:27:16] brother branham some of these statements
[1:27:17] that you're you're very familiar with
[1:27:19] when brother branham could declare and
[1:27:21] he would talk about the pool of water of
[1:27:23] bethesda
[1:27:24] when the spirit of god would come and
[1:27:26] move upon that water
[1:27:27] the water couldn't glory in itself it
[1:27:30] was the spirit of god the angel of the
[1:27:32] lord who came and troubled that water
[1:27:35] brother brown would make would declare
[1:27:37] here the spirit of god
[1:27:38] would come down and say i'm just your
[1:27:41] brother but by the grace of god
[1:27:43] when the angel of the lord moves down it
[1:27:45] then becomes the voice of god to you
[1:27:48] if i offended you by saying that forgive
[1:27:51] me
[1:27:51] but i felt that i might have been
[1:27:53] resented but i'm god's voice to you
[1:27:55] he said i say it again that time was
[1:27:58] under inspiration
[1:27:59] i felt bad about it the first time but
[1:28:01] it repeated it
[1:28:03] now he said see i can say nothing in
[1:28:05] myself but what he shows me
[1:28:08] i say it
[1:28:12] now brother i will go on to make the
[1:28:15] statement let me just refer to a few of
[1:28:16] these places
[1:28:17] i think this is very in is this this
[1:28:19] time is this the sign
[1:28:22] of the answers brandon makes this
[1:28:25] statement i've always
[1:28:26] this is a principle you know there's
[1:28:27] things that you can find in the word of
[1:28:29] god and there's things that brother
[1:28:31] branham would say
[1:28:32] it just becomes a principle of
[1:28:33] discernment brother brown would say like
[1:28:36] this he says
[1:28:38] when you see a person that's got the
[1:28:40] answer to everything
[1:28:42] that's contrary to the word
[1:28:46] well they've got the answer that's
[1:28:48] contrary to the word right
[1:28:50] there's many examples brother brahm goes
[1:28:52] through it he says he doesn't tell his
[1:28:53] servants everything
[1:28:54] you've seen that with isaac jacob and
[1:28:57] esau
[1:28:58] there's many times even with that were
[1:29:00] elisha
[1:29:01] coming there in the chamber and the boy
[1:29:03] had passed on even with that of elijah
[1:29:05] they didn't know what to do they were
[1:29:07] just waiting on god
[1:29:08] they didn't know what was going they
[1:29:10] didn't know what to do but god's the one
[1:29:12] who opened it
[1:29:13] and revealed it to his servants so
[1:29:15] there's gone there's times
[1:29:16] that even in that when we where there's
[1:29:19] not an
[1:29:20] answer as far as well i know this is
[1:29:21] what it is or i know that is what it is
[1:29:23] that's contrary to the scripture
[1:29:28] i tell you it'd be greater just for
[1:29:30] somebody to say you know what
[1:29:32] i'll pray about that get back to you
[1:29:36] is that right instead of willy-nilly
[1:29:38] taking all the roads and everything else
[1:29:39] around just to be able to let us know
[1:29:41] you don't know
[1:29:43] just say you know what let's pray about
[1:29:44] that
[1:29:46] is that all right you see god will not
[1:29:49] share
[1:29:50] his glory with no one the brahman even
[1:29:53] talks about you know impressions and
[1:29:54] things that comes up he says
[1:29:57] no matter how impulsating those are he
[1:29:58] says we've got to take them we can't
[1:30:00] always take it as thus saith the lord
[1:30:02] we've got to discern that and check it
[1:30:05] whether it is of
[1:30:06] god or not the brahman says he's always
[1:30:10] protected me because i've waited on him
[1:30:11] i haven't tried to sink
[1:30:13] look at this he's protected me because
[1:30:15] i've waited on him
[1:30:16] i haven't tried to seek popularity or
[1:30:19] vain
[1:30:20] glory of men i've tried my best to live
[1:30:23] humble
[1:30:24] live the kind of life that i think a
[1:30:26] christian should live and i haven't been
[1:30:28] able
[1:30:28] to do that within myself but he has done
[1:30:31] it until this day
[1:30:32] as i say that he is the one that's led
[1:30:35] me
[1:30:37] i think that soul it's so tremendous to
[1:30:40] see
[1:30:41] that even how the spirit of god would
[1:30:44] bring this
[1:30:45] you say brother samuel why are these
[1:30:47] things well
[1:30:49] these are things how the god just just
[1:30:51] has been dealing with my heart over the
[1:30:52] weeks
[1:30:53] and then you begin to look at things and
[1:30:55] this is listen friends
[1:30:56] this is the approach many of you right
[1:30:59] here and on the internet those of you
[1:31:01] that look to me as your pastor
[1:31:02] you know where i stand with the word
[1:31:05] there's things that that sometimes
[1:31:06] that one thing that sometimes can kind
[1:31:08] of get to me if there's things that's
[1:31:10] being used out of line in the word
[1:31:12] and i i like things to be kept in line
[1:31:15] with the word i
[1:31:16] i don't like things to be misrepresented
[1:31:18] i like it to be kept in line with the
[1:31:20] word
[1:31:20] i don't like quotes that get off and try
[1:31:22] to validate things in people's life
[1:31:24] let's keep it right with the word of god
[1:31:27] and the other when and it goes with it i
[1:31:30] don't look for things when it comes to
[1:31:32] here when we're looking at the message i
[1:31:34] don't try to take
[1:31:35] the message and try to say let me just
[1:31:37] try to see where this is at within the
[1:31:39] scripture
[1:31:40] i know this is a scriptural message this
[1:31:43] is a scriptural prophet are you with me
[1:31:47] there might be some things that maybe
[1:31:49] you don't understand
[1:31:50] and maybe you don't see or a person says
[1:31:53] i don't know where this is at in the
[1:31:54] scripture
[1:31:55] if you just be patient it's right there
[1:31:58] in the world
[1:31:59] [Applause]
[1:32:01] but sam you're trying to make brother
[1:32:03] ben no i'm not trying to make him
[1:32:04] something
[1:32:05] god made him the prophet to this age
[1:32:08] are you with me and this is why when we
[1:32:10] look at things
[1:32:11] that's where i take my leaning when
[1:32:13] there's things you know
[1:32:14] when it comes down we're speaking of
[1:32:16] things or whatever more
[1:32:17] there's things are the spirit of god
[1:32:19] it'll bring things right back to my mind
[1:32:21] of things i've heard the prophet say and
[1:32:23] listen friends without this message
[1:32:26] the bible would just be a written letter
[1:32:30] but god sent this word to make it more
[1:32:32] than just a written letter
[1:32:34] a written word it god lifted himself
[1:32:38] up out of history it's not mindset it's
[1:32:41] not the mind
[1:32:43] of william branham these are the
[1:32:45] thoughts of almighty god
[1:32:47] let me tell you something it's a
[1:32:49] dangerous crowd for a person to stand
[1:32:52] upon and say
[1:32:53] that's brother branham's opinion that's
[1:32:55] what brother branham thought
[1:32:56] oh brother brandon probably meant this
[1:32:58] here that's dangerous crown
[1:33:00] you have no business tampering with that
[1:33:03] that's what
[1:33:03] paul was saying here
[1:33:07] paul was not vaunting himself but he was
[1:33:10] reminding them
[1:33:11] this revelation did not come by the will
[1:33:15] of man and neither did god
[1:33:19] entrust it for a man to vaunt himself
[1:33:22] to be able to say well this is a god
[1:33:25] this is not of god
[1:33:26] this is a god that's foolishness
[1:33:30] amen and i'm telling you that's not of
[1:33:32] god
[1:33:34] that is a spirit that's seeking to vaunt
[1:33:37] itself above the revealed word of the
[1:33:40] hour but let me remind you the authority
[1:33:44] of god's word is to be under the word
[1:33:48] the spirit
[1:33:49] that hasn't come through the prophet we
[1:33:51] stand under that word
[1:33:52] and brother through that revelation we
[1:33:55] are a mighty army
[1:33:56] it's not us or speaking it's god who's
[1:33:59] speaking
[1:34:00] it's not us it's changing life god is
[1:34:03] changing
[1:34:04] lives hallelujah
[1:34:08] [Music]
[1:34:10] i mean no qualm about it this message is
[1:34:12] thus saith the lord
[1:34:15] i don't apologize to nobody about that
[1:34:20] i told you some some time ago just a
[1:34:22] couple years ago or whatever
[1:34:24] i realized as an individual called me
[1:34:26] and they're wanting to bring
[1:34:27] questions and this and that and i
[1:34:29] realized this is somebody who's seen
[1:34:31] who's set in meetings
[1:34:33] who's seen it as a boy and there's
[1:34:36] things that you're
[1:34:37] asking and and troubling with and i
[1:34:40] could
[1:34:40] i want i told the individual i said you
[1:34:42] know what brother adam said right here
[1:34:44] you know what brother brown said right
[1:34:45] there and you begin to realize
[1:34:48] wait a minute the things that just to
[1:34:50] mention it
[1:34:51] should have settled it right there it
[1:34:53] shouldn't went any further
[1:34:54] no question whatsoever but because the
[1:34:57] authority
[1:34:58] of the word was lifted it was not heeded
[1:35:01] to
[1:35:04] i'm telling you friends this is why
[1:35:06] brother branham when he makes this
[1:35:07] statement he that is in you
[1:35:10] he says what i'm trying to say he says
[1:35:13] don't never lose your confidence
[1:35:16] don't let don't let satan tell you evil
[1:35:19] about me
[1:35:20] because there's much but you keep that
[1:35:22] confidence cause if you don't
[1:35:24] it won't happen don't look to me as a
[1:35:27] man
[1:35:28] i'm a man i'm full of mistakes but look
[1:35:30] to what i'm saying about him
[1:35:32] it's him he's the one
[1:35:37] that's a whole emphasis of this this
[1:35:40] word
[1:35:42] this revelation this that god has sent
[1:35:44] to you and i
[1:35:46] i'll tell you brother sister there's men
[1:35:48] i hope this
[1:35:49] i'm just going to say it there's men
[1:35:51] there's commentaries
[1:35:53] there's commentaries you can look at
[1:35:55] commentaries i have things within
[1:35:57] different study programs and things like
[1:35:59] that commentaries these are commentaries
[1:36:01] of men
[1:36:01] you can look at certain things and you
[1:36:03] know there are certain things that you
[1:36:04] can read in your scofield bible
[1:36:06] some of those you have a scofield bible
[1:36:08] you'll read certain statements sometimes
[1:36:10] that are read down there and just oh
[1:36:12] this is the exact same statement
[1:36:14] that brother branham he speaks of in
[1:36:16] this is the mess there's a manic eternal
[1:36:18] life you can find many of it you say
[1:36:20] well brother samuel what's the
[1:36:21] difference with that
[1:36:22] because listen those men writing things
[1:36:25] even
[1:36:26] in commentaries they're writing under an
[1:36:29] inspiration
[1:36:30] there was truth that was there but you
[1:36:32] see in this
[1:36:33] hour this is not trying to put things
[1:36:36] together
[1:36:36] it's god that's assembling the truth
[1:36:39] it's god that's putting his stamp upon
[1:36:42] it
[1:36:43] that's why i say with all my heart it's
[1:36:46] good to get into the message
[1:36:48] you need to get into the message brother
[1:36:51] samuel i've got a book
[1:36:52] over here get into the message the
[1:36:55] things that i'm ministering from
[1:36:57] i'm not ministering from a book out
[1:36:59] there i'm preaching from the revelation
[1:37:01] of the word that god has sent in this
[1:37:04] hour
[1:37:05] god has declared this word god has put
[1:37:07] his stamp of approval
[1:37:09] this is his gospel this is his word this
[1:37:12] is his message
[1:37:13] this is the power of transformation
[1:37:15] [Applause]
[1:37:18] amen
[1:37:21] i hope that's all right but if it's not
[1:37:22] you'll have to take that up with the
[1:37:24] lord
[1:37:26] you see these are things
[1:37:29] as paul would write of that let's just
[1:37:32] close
[1:37:34] i think it's very much so
[1:37:37] as i've told you over and over
[1:37:41] i've had things sometimes and i want you
[1:37:44] to understand i'm nothing
[1:37:46] i had things sometimes were sometimes
[1:37:49] you know you come into such
[1:37:50] precarious situations situations that
[1:37:54] didn't ever ask to be in and it feels a
[1:37:56] little funny when you're in it
[1:37:58] and sometimes situations that would be
[1:38:00] brought and
[1:38:01] go to looking at things you know within
[1:38:04] the messaging
[1:38:05] and it's simply to me it is simply to
[1:38:08] put it like this
[1:38:10] as i spoke many expressed many times
[1:38:12] something to to
[1:38:13] to different ones that maybe have come
[1:38:15] in there and how to
[1:38:16] listen many of these i'm speaking have a
[1:38:19] real real good heart they
[1:38:20] really desire to to follow the lord
[1:38:24] and would come and you know ask certain
[1:38:26] questions or ask certain things
[1:38:28] they say brother brown or brother simon
[1:38:30] what did you do i could speak to them
[1:38:32] this is where
[1:38:33] you can look at this in the word right
[1:38:35] here brother branham has taken us
[1:38:38] into the word right here he's given us
[1:38:41] the leadership
[1:38:42] of the holy spirit what god was saying
[1:38:44] in the word right here
[1:38:46] that should end it right there are you
[1:38:48] with me
[1:38:49] that should end it right there it
[1:38:50] shouldn't be well i need to see it here
[1:38:53] i need to see it there i need to see it
[1:38:54] see if
[1:38:56] a heart in humility god can teach a
[1:38:59] heart
[1:38:59] that's humble sometimes you know
[1:39:02] humility is it's just simply saying lord
[1:39:04] i don't understand this
[1:39:08] but will you show me lord will you will
[1:39:11] you open
[1:39:12] your word to me lord amen god didn't ask
[1:39:14] you all right to even try to figure it
[1:39:16] out
[1:39:16] that's not even how that i minister i'll
[1:39:19] say the other brother in a minute we
[1:39:20] don't minister things because we
[1:39:21] understand it here
[1:39:23] it's ministered by revelation
[1:39:26] it's god that comes and places together
[1:39:29] that's why even with things that when we
[1:39:30] look at things
[1:39:31] you see things that are even happening
[1:39:33] in the world right now things that
[1:39:35] even going on and you find at times
[1:39:38] where people are getting carried
[1:39:40] away with that they're getting carried
[1:39:42] away within certain things and
[1:39:44] they're wanting to take on certain
[1:39:45] causes and doing certain things like
[1:39:46] that
[1:39:47] the simple part is if they get in the
[1:39:50] message the message will direct
[1:39:52] and it discerns the spirit that's
[1:39:54] motivating these things
[1:39:56] are you with me it puts it brings it to
[1:39:59] a place
[1:39:59] where not to get caught up with the
[1:40:01] things of the world
[1:40:02] it's not brother branham's opinions on
[1:40:04] things that's god's word and his
[1:40:06] leadership to you and i
[1:40:07] in this hour god knew friends let me
[1:40:09] tell you something god knew
[1:40:10] this time that you and i would be living
[1:40:12] it he knew there'd be traps
[1:40:14] he knew there'd be things that would
[1:40:15] pull upon your emotions
[1:40:18] things that that that the enemy would
[1:40:20] try to pull on your emotions
[1:40:22] and pull you out into various situations
[1:40:25] but god has given a word
[1:40:27] to stabilize us and say i will not
[1:40:29] believe that narrative
[1:40:31] i will stand with the word of almighty
[1:40:34] god
[1:40:34] because this word god has given is there
[1:40:37] to see us all the way through
[1:40:40] hallelujah so if there's any
[1:40:44] anything we're going to glory in we
[1:40:46] glory in god
[1:40:48] it's god who has brought his word to us
[1:40:52] in this hour
[1:40:55] and this word that god has given to our
[1:40:58] hearts
[1:40:59] is a word that comes to lead us
[1:41:02] and direct directors i'm telling you
[1:41:04] brother sister the word has the answers
[1:41:07] there's things when we look at things
[1:41:09] families and husbands and wives and
[1:41:11] children
[1:41:12] the word has the answer it has the
[1:41:16] answer
[1:41:16] we can look to god in prayer
[1:41:20] oh i'm so thankful that that's one
[1:41:23] that's one of the
[1:41:24] many things let's stand how the word it
[1:41:27] brings us into that place of a real
[1:41:31] the leadership of the holy spirit back
[1:41:33] into the church of the living god
[1:41:36] and i just
[1:41:40] with anything at all i just say
[1:41:44] if you're giving yourself to the to the
[1:41:46] message
[1:41:48] oh god bless your heart and give
[1:41:50] yourself to the message
[1:41:52] give yourself to the word listen
[1:41:56] these things that god would lay up on my
[1:42:00] heart
[1:42:00] bring within this bring within this
[1:42:03] manner
[1:42:04] it it don't worry about when you you
[1:42:07] read a message
[1:42:08] or you're listening to a message don't
[1:42:10] don't don't don't
[1:42:12] listen to it with i've got to understand
[1:42:14] all these points
[1:42:15] oh just just put it on just put it on
[1:42:20] just just read
[1:42:23] let me just show you one little thing
[1:42:24] just just to share with you maybe it
[1:42:26] would be a help to you
[1:42:28] as i go through and probably most of you
[1:42:31] go through and you have a
[1:42:33] daily devotional so much of you know the
[1:42:36] scriptures where
[1:42:37] as you read through and do some of that
[1:42:39] because i just i want to read
[1:42:42] there's times of study where the times
[1:42:43] of study just goes and you're
[1:42:45] cross-referencing i'm taking this just
[1:42:46] following the lord and going here and
[1:42:48] going there but then even a part of it
[1:42:52] this year when i started out in the
[1:42:53] first part of january even at the latter
[1:42:55] part of december i just said you know
[1:42:58] one of my one of my favorite one of my
[1:43:00] favorite books
[1:43:01] is the church age book it has everything
[1:43:05] right there contained in it
[1:43:07] so i just i set out and i looked at it
[1:43:09] and the one that brother george when
[1:43:11] brother george took it and he kind of
[1:43:13] did it a little bit and he he broke it
[1:43:15] so that the scriptures aren't right
[1:43:16] there in the paragraph they're broke
[1:43:17] down
[1:43:18] some of you that have the copies of it
[1:43:20] and things like that
[1:43:21] well i think it has what it's 400 and
[1:43:23] 428 pages i believe if i'm not mistaken
[1:43:27] so i took that and i just divided it by
[1:43:29] 365.
[1:43:30] i know in the youth meeting brother
[1:43:32] george mentioned something about it and
[1:43:33] when i told him
[1:43:34] two pages he said no no no we'll see i
[1:43:36] had already divided it
[1:43:38] but but the thing that what i did was i
[1:43:40] said you know
[1:43:42] i'm just going to take this and the book
[1:43:45] brother brian had bought me the copy of
[1:43:46] it some years
[1:43:47] some some years ago the leather-bound
[1:43:49] copy and you can't write in the pages
[1:43:52] it's not like my paper copy my paper
[1:43:54] copy you know how it is you
[1:43:56] highlight here and write notes here just
[1:43:57] like in your bible you're writing notes
[1:43:59] and
[1:44:00] i can't write in it you say well brother
[1:44:02] samuel what's the good thing about that
[1:44:04] because i just read i just take a page
[1:44:07] or two page
[1:44:08] because naturally i'm inclined to just
[1:44:11] study
[1:44:12] there's a part of it i can just start to
[1:44:14] start going and just start studying not
[1:44:15] me but you understand the gift it's
[1:44:17] there and there's i don't want
[1:44:20] i just said lord i just want to read
[1:44:22] just a little bit
[1:44:23] and i've just taken it and just a couple
[1:44:26] pages a day
[1:44:27] there's two pages actually that'll get
[1:44:28] you done with a book well before the end
[1:44:30] of the year
[1:44:31] if you just do a page and a half but
[1:44:34] samuel why would that be
[1:44:36] important well it was important enough
[1:44:38] for him to bring it to my mind
[1:44:41] but i would say this right here there's
[1:44:43] a lot of things that you can get
[1:44:44] brothers and sisters a lot of things
[1:44:46] that you can get that's even out there
[1:44:47] and i'm not altogether saying well
[1:44:49] this devotional or this or that that's
[1:44:51] not what i am saying to you is this
[1:44:53] right here
[1:44:54] make sure you're availing yourself in
[1:44:55] the message of the hour
[1:44:58] because what what god is bringing here
[1:45:00] it's a message
[1:45:02] that that's what positions us in jesus
[1:45:04] christ don't worry about trying to
[1:45:07] figure everything out let god reveal it
[1:45:11] you take a little bit it's not about
[1:45:13] it's not quantity
[1:45:14] it's quality it's quality
[1:45:18] it's not quantity it's quality you can
[1:45:20] just read that brother brown would talk
[1:45:22] about even as you're reading
[1:45:23] the word of god he said you start out he
[1:45:25] said you just read a chapter and you say
[1:45:28] he said and make sure as soon as you
[1:45:29] read that chapter you say
[1:45:31] amen then you read another chapter
[1:45:34] maybe he said before you go to bed you
[1:45:36] read it amen
[1:45:39] just the simplicity within that
[1:45:43] you see god god works with us in this
[1:45:46] time
[1:45:46] this hour you see what the word does it
[1:45:49] calls us
[1:45:50] into a place of real humidity humility
[1:45:53] with god
[1:45:56] to where instead of us we're not walking
[1:45:59] around
[1:46:00] as it records the spirit of this age i'm
[1:46:03] rich
[1:46:04] have need of nothing see they present
[1:46:07] themselves
[1:46:08] within great elaborate things and
[1:46:11] programs and everything and building one
[1:46:13] trying to outdo the next one
[1:46:15] trying to outdo and see all of that in
[1:46:18] itself
[1:46:19] it it's it's it's seeking the wrong
[1:46:22] thing
[1:46:23] it's focused on the wrong thing it's
[1:46:26] like what we read here in the pharisees
[1:46:28] but you see the word of god comes it
[1:46:29] comes to draw you and i
[1:46:32] out of that it draws us out of the glory
[1:46:35] of men the glory of ourselves
[1:46:37] it draws us into a place of his glory
[1:46:40] to where it's no longer either liveth
[1:46:43] but it's christ that liveth
[1:46:44] you see it's where you and i can make
[1:46:46] the statement
[1:46:48] and say
[1:46:52] i can't do this on my own
[1:46:56] listen god doesn't step back that
[1:46:58] invites god
[1:47:00] but when you begin to think as though
[1:47:02] you can do it on your own
[1:47:04] that pushes him away what should i do
[1:47:06] invite him
[1:47:08] even when you're on the way to work of a
[1:47:10] morning invite him lord
[1:47:11] be with me today lord lord guide me
[1:47:14] today but listen you know how many times
[1:47:16] i've done this job
[1:47:17] i know how to do this but lord will you
[1:47:19] guide me today lord
[1:47:21] you give me favor lord it's looking to
[1:47:24] him
[1:47:26] i believe that's the desire in our heart
[1:47:27] real charity real love as it goes forth
[1:47:30] it wants to it works to draw us beyond
[1:47:33] ourselves
