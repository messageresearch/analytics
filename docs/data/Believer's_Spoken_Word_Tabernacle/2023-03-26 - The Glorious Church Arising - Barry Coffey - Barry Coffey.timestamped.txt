[41:04] years ago we would travel up to Albion
[41:06] Pennsylvania and be with brother herb
[41:08] Smith up there and minister in the old
[41:10] days and uh back in the 80s and it was
[41:14] great a Great Fellowship that we had so
[41:16] it's really an honor to be here and be
[41:18] brother Sam's Sister Kim and and all of
[41:20] you and see so many familiar faces and
[41:22] to be able to join in yesterday in the
[41:25] in the meeting and it was a real
[41:27] blessing so we just feel great about
[41:28] being here today and I just trusted
[41:31] what's said over this weekend will be
[41:33] helped to you and edifying because
[41:37] that's uh that's why we've come
[41:39] so let's read in the scripture in
[41:40] Ephesians chapter 5 and we'll read a
[41:43] very familiar passage here just to
[41:45] capture a phrase
[41:47] Ephesians chapter 5 verse 25.
[41:52] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[41:56] also loved the church
[41:58] and gave himself for it
[42:01] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[42:03] with the washing of Water by the word
[42:07] and this is the intent now verse 27 that
[42:11] he might presented to himself a glorious
[42:14] church not having spot or wrinkle or any
[42:19] such thing but that it should be holy
[42:22] and without blemish
[42:24] may God add his Blessing why don't we
[42:26] pray this morning Heavenly Father we
[42:28] counted a grand privileged Lord to be
[42:30] gathered in this house today with your
[42:32] people and trusting Lord that you will
[42:34] just move in on the scene and take
[42:36] complete control father we ask
[42:38] forgiveness for anything that might
[42:40] hinder the moving of the Holy Spirit and
[42:43] pray that your presence Lord would just
[42:45] come and take over father I have notes I
[42:48] have this presentation here today but
[42:50] Lord that's that's really unimportant
[42:53] compared to what you may have to say
[42:56] and Lord you know the needs of the
[42:57] people and I pray that you would just uh
[43:00] just lead me and guide me and father
[43:02] just take complete control of the gifts
[43:05] and talents you put inside me that you
[43:07] might edify and bless your people today
[43:10] Lord you be the minister and you operate
[43:13] the gift I pray in Lord just when we
[43:16] leave here today may we say it's just
[43:17] been good for us to be in the house of
[43:19] the Lord
[43:20] we love you and we thank you Lord I ask
[43:22] the blessing of the presence of God to
[43:24] be with my assembly today Lord and pray
[43:27] that you would be with them and father
[43:29] our families and our loved ones we
[43:31] commit them into your care now in Jesus
[43:33] lovely name we pray
[43:35] amen and all the people of God said
[43:38] you may be seated this morning God bless
[43:40] you
[43:43] um this is us
[43:45] we had a wedding a year ago and uh this
[43:48] was uh this is our family all gathered
[43:51] together and uh my four boys we decided
[43:53] to stick with boys as I told you
[43:56] yesterday and uh these this is the whole
[43:59] family gotten together this is a it was
[44:01] a rare event for us to have a picture
[44:03] like this done and my father-in-law on
[44:06] the very uh right hand side there 96
[44:09] years old and he has preached the gospel
[44:11] longer than I've been alive
[44:13] and uh now just in his August years and
[44:17] this is our whole family and the
[44:19] grandchildren and uh just excited about
[44:21] that I I like to say that I believe that
[44:24] grandchildren are the reward you get for
[44:26] not killing your own
[44:28] foreign
[44:33] now if you don't mind this morning I
[44:34] asked Brother Sam if this would be all
[44:36] right and I'd like to I'd like to just
[44:38] take a little a few minutes this morning
[44:40] to talk about what's happening around
[44:43] the world with vision books and and I
[44:45] know that you you have a great interest
[44:47] but Sam is well known around the world
[44:49] and uh you folks have been very
[44:51] supportive of this work with vision
[44:53] books and I wanted to just give you a
[44:55] visual uh of some of the things that are
[44:59] happening I have pictures here that I
[45:01] wanted to show you and and some of the
[45:03] exciting things that are taking place
[45:05] and I even have a little video clip here
[45:06] that's embedded so hopefully we'll get
[45:08] it with volume and uh I uh we're excited
[45:13] to see what God's doing and this is
[45:14] really an effort to find the last seed
[45:17] because that's what that's what this is
[45:18] about we're just interested in reaching
[45:21] the bride of Christ with the best
[45:22] message that has ever struck the face of
[45:24] the Earth and we're excited to play a
[45:27] small part in that and uh recently we
[45:30] were in Africa and did a documentary
[45:34] there that documentary is available on
[45:36] my website and uh in Hickory Bible
[45:40] tabernacle.org and it tells a story of
[45:42] going into the uh jungle up there in a
[45:45] place called loliondo and I've got a
[45:47] little uh trailer that I'll show you
[45:49] this morning here but brother Branham
[45:50] said in a message a guide don't travel
[45:53] your denominational Roots now he said
[45:55] stay behind the word
[45:58] because you have not passed this way
[46:00] before and the word will lead you across
[46:03] because the word is Christ
[46:05] stay behind the word yes sir stay with
[46:07] that guy don't get in front of it stay
[46:09] behind it let it lead you he said Don't
[46:13] You Lead it
[46:15] and Joshua said now you've never passed
[46:17] this way before he said you know nothing
[46:19] about it so Vision books is a is an
[46:23] answer to a need uh where uh there's
[46:26] nobody nobody was doing large-scale
[46:28] printing in the world anymore of the
[46:30] message and yet the need was great in
[46:32] places where uh villages don't have
[46:35] electricity they don't have internet
[46:36] connection they don't have many people
[46:38] don't have phones or uh they live in mud
[46:40] Huts they didn't have access to the
[46:42] message at all there were many countries
[46:44] that we sent books into where people
[46:46] felt like they had been forgotten by the
[46:49] rest of the world the bride had actually
[46:50] felt like they had been forgotten nobody
[46:53] nobody brought any materials they were
[46:55] they felt like they were disconnected
[46:57] and out of touch and so Vision books
[47:00] exist to meet a need to help provide the
[47:03] materials that are necessary for the
[47:04] bride of Christ to have the word of the
[47:07] hour ministered to them so this is an
[47:10] older man who just got his first book
[47:12] ever it's a church age book printed in
[47:14] Spanish and uh in Nicaragua and he was
[47:17] very excited to have that and somebody
[47:19] took that picture
[47:20] and there are currently needs for
[47:22] millions of books and bibles that uh uh
[47:26] that are necessary and and desired all
[47:28] over the world I had a a gentleman as a
[47:31] pastor in the country of Malawi and he
[47:34] did a little video clip I don't have it
[47:35] here with me but he he made a little
[47:37] video clip and he wanted to thank us for
[47:40] the Bible that he had received and he
[47:43] said that for 10 years he's been a
[47:45] pastor and he preached to his people
[47:47] with his phone
[47:49] and on his phone he had a Bible app and
[47:52] ministered to the people for uh the 10
[47:55] years that he was a pastor but after
[47:57] seven years his phone broke
[47:59] so he had no message material whatsoever
[48:02] and no Bible and preached for another
[48:05] three years after his phone broke didn't
[48:07] have enough money to replace his phone
[48:09] and he said now somebody's given me a
[48:11] Bible in my language and given me the
[48:13] message in my language he was so happy
[48:16] and so excited so he sent me that uh
[48:19] little video clip there just to thank us
[48:22] for that and so uh there are believers
[48:25] like you that are all over the world
[48:27] they look a little bit differently sing
[48:28] a little bit differently but in this
[48:30] case this group here meets under a tree
[48:32] and they moved their chairs as the sun
[48:35] moves across the sky so they're not
[48:36] sitting in the direct sun and they do
[48:38] that until they go home
[48:40] they are people just like us believe
[48:43] just like us and love the message of the
[48:46] hour for sure so basically this is very
[48:49] simple we we use translations that are
[48:51] either on the message Hub or translators
[48:54] that work for us and and Supply
[48:56] translations in various languages we do
[49:00] printing overseas we do it all of it in
[49:03] China and in India and in both of the
[49:06] factories where all of our material is
[49:08] printed they are both the largest Bible
[49:10] printing companies in the world and all
[49:14] major publishing and printing is done
[49:16] now overseas like this and so we found
[49:19] that the quality was very good and the
[49:21] prices were extremely good so that we
[49:24] were able to provide lots of materials
[49:26] in large quantities and we summarized it
[49:29] this way every language
[49:31] Every Nation
[49:33] so we can do every language on Earth and
[49:36] we can do every nation on Earth
[49:38] and it's just been a blessing so I'll
[49:41] show you a little bit of this
[49:42] translations are done from the message
[49:44] Hub and then also from individuals this
[49:47] top pitcher is brother Anwar Javed who
[49:49] lives in Queens New York and he
[49:51] translates in the Urdu language for
[49:52] Pakistan and uh he coordinates all of
[49:56] the distribution of material in Pakistan
[49:58] does a tremendous work he's a great
[50:00] friend below that is the translators in
[50:03] in the Venda language and these are the
[50:05] people who live on the border of South
[50:08] Africa Zimbabwe Mozambique in that area
[50:11] and there's about two million people who
[50:13] live there and speak that language and
[50:15] there's about 30 000 Believers they've
[50:17] never had anything in their language and
[50:19] these are the translators who are doing
[50:20] that and we just recently last week
[50:22] finished the church age book in the
[50:24] Venda language and they're very excited
[50:26] it's on its way now in a boat there's
[50:29] some of the printing operations there
[50:32] and like I say all of it's done in China
[50:34] and India except for Pakistan Pakistan
[50:37] is a Muslim country so we cannot import
[50:39] Christian materials in the Pakistan so
[50:42] we print inside the country and uh it is
[50:45] a wonderful blessing because we have no
[50:47] shipping uh process or anything like
[50:50] that no shipping charges and uh it it
[50:52] goes directly to the people there so
[50:54] they're uh they're working with brother
[50:56] Anwar and get all kinds of uh materials
[50:59] available to them very quickly in the
[51:02] country of Zambia was there a couple of
[51:04] years ago they speak the bemba language
[51:06] and there's about 30 million people who
[51:08] speak bimba and there are again
[51:11] something like 50 000 believers who
[51:13] speak there and this translator had
[51:16] translated all kinds of books and never
[51:18] had anything never had anywhere to send
[51:20] them I never had anywhere to send the
[51:22] translations and then I show up and uh
[51:25] he said well he said I have all these
[51:27] translations already done and he said we
[51:29] have not had books printed and he said
[51:31] about 25 years
[51:32] and any material so we went ahead and
[51:35] did all of these books and there's a
[51:36] bunch more that uh now single sermons
[51:38] that are on the way to those people over
[51:40] there let me tell you they're excited
[51:42] once the books then arrived in in the
[51:44] country and this is something that
[51:45] sovereignly happened uh we we will
[51:48] manage to get them across borders
[51:50] through customs into the hands of the
[51:52] Believers there but then these Believers
[51:54] take these books and bring them to all
[51:56] the neighboring countries and all the
[51:58] areas in a nation where Believers are
[52:01] and we give them out without any uh
[52:05] without any con you know a restriction
[52:07] uh if they're Believers they're entitled
[52:09] to get books uh in in their in their
[52:12] language and it's wonderful to see the
[52:13] ministers uh you know being so excited
[52:16] that they'll take these materials on
[52:18] their own I have pictures of uh
[52:20] Believers taking books in horse on
[52:22] Horseback they'll take them in saddle
[52:24] bags and ride over the mountaintops in
[52:26] Nicaragua and Honduras and places and
[52:28] get them into Venezuela and all kinds of
[52:31] all kinds of Nations that I would never
[52:33] have access to but they know how to do
[52:35] that and it's really exciting so this is
[52:38] Honduras and again this is how it
[52:40] happens the books arrive and then they
[52:42] divide those up and send them around the
[52:44] countries and get them distributed to
[52:47] the Believers there and let me tell you
[52:49] they're excited they're excited in those
[52:51] Nations where now they have all this
[52:55] material available that's our blue truck
[52:56] there and uh it's parked in Malawi and
[53:00] we'll fill that up and go into
[53:01] Mozambique and South Africa and Zimbabwe
[53:04] and Zambia all the southern part of
[53:06] Africa and they deliver books that you
[53:09] see prints there we just did the Hoffman
[53:11] head of Christ and the Rich Young Ruler
[53:13] and did that for all the Believers in in
[53:16] South Africa South America or sorry
[53:17] South Africa and all the southern part
[53:20] of the continent and uh it's it they're
[53:23] just they're just really excited these
[53:26] are Church age books that were sent to
[53:27] Haiti and the the conditions are so
[53:30] dangerous and so bad in T they've had to
[53:33] give them out just sparingly just a
[53:35] little at a time but they were they were
[53:38] very glad to receive books in the French
[53:40] language over there here's some
[53:41] Believers in Pakistan and they are uh
[53:45] like I say they're a nation that is 97
[53:48] Muslim and uh yet the message has been
[53:52] spreading and growing over there and
[53:54] they're really uh really excited and
[53:56] very thankful to be now having uh their
[53:58] own books over there in that language
[54:00] here are believers in Ukraine giving out
[54:02] materials in the Russian language and
[54:04] Believers in South America in the uh
[54:07] they they speak a form of Spanish uh
[54:10] they're called Emira people and they
[54:14] live in three different countries on the
[54:16] western side of South America and Chile
[54:18] and Argentina and so forth over there
[54:21] and uh these are people who most of them
[54:23] live in the mountains they're Believers
[54:25] just spread out all through that area in
[54:29] the north of Africa Nigeria and Ghana in
[54:31] uh in Liberia they speak the Yoruba
[54:36] language over there and these are all
[54:38] messages and church age books that are
[54:40] coming in uh in that in that part of the
[54:42] world so they're very excited about that
[54:44] but this is what's really neat is that
[54:46] now evangelists are able to travel and
[54:49] move around and give new converts books
[54:52] and bibles in their language when they
[54:53] come into the faith and they're
[54:55] witnessing to people they're witnessing
[54:57] to their families and uh excuse me
[54:59] they're traveling around and spreading
[55:01] the message as well so we're seeing a
[55:04] flurry and having reports of all these
[55:07] people being baptized in villages and
[55:09] towns that we never knew existed I mean
[55:11] we never knew there was Believers there
[55:12] and to me that's exciting because that's
[55:15] that's what's supposed to happen and now
[55:17] that they have materials to give out
[55:19] they're able to do that so it's really
[55:21] wonderful and uh in in uh in some of
[55:24] these areas let me tell you it's it's
[55:26] just uh it's just been life-changing for
[55:29] them to now come in contact with uh with
[55:32] believers who are able to supply them
[55:34] with the things that they have need of
[55:35] all right so we went to Tanzania and uh
[55:38] this is hopefully we can do this here
[55:42] um do we have sound are we all right for
[55:44] sound we don't have sound
[55:46] let's put a microphone here because this
[55:48] is this is uh worth listening to this is
[55:51] only a minute and a half okay
[55:54] can I do I'll do this here and this is a
[55:57] this is a little trailer that we did for
[56:00] the documentary and again the
[56:01] documentary is uh available on our
[56:04] website sorry let me go back here
[56:08] and let's play it
[56:10] all of this footage is ours
[56:15] we use drones and other technology here
[56:18] to capture this but this just gives you
[56:20] a sampling of where we went
[56:22] uh on this trip there were 10 of us

[57:12] [Music]
[57:31] that's the trailer
[57:34] keep me

[57:42] website and it tells the story of what
[57:44] happened in oleando and it is a Maasai
[57:46] area it's a messiah Village and there
[57:49] are 60 villages in that little 60 little
[57:52] communities in that area of what's
[57:53] called norangoro and that's where the
[57:56] Serengeti is and all the big animals and
[57:58] all of that and uh to a brother a
[58:01] brother from Arusha the the last church
[58:04] that we saw there went to that area as a
[58:07] worker for the government and witnessed
[58:09] to one of the Messiah people and he
[58:11] embraced the message and then he went
[58:13] and told his people and then they went
[58:15] and told their people and it spread all
[58:18] through that community and now there's
[58:19] 36 people in that uh in that church over
[58:22] there and they're just on fire for God
[58:24] they all live in mud Huts none of them
[58:28] have electricity or Internet or anything
[58:29] like that and most of them just wear a
[58:31] simple blanket that's all they wear and
[58:34] so we had this opportunity to travel
[58:36] there and to minister to them and bring
[58:38] materials in their languages Bibles and
[58:40] so forth and uh let me tell you they
[58:42] were really excited Olivia was one last
[58:45] image and this is a redesign of the
[58:47] Seven Seals book uh you know brother
[58:49] George Smith had done the seven Church
[58:51] ages and did a redesign it's a nicer to
[58:54] read and better paragraphing and so
[58:55] forth and uh we we print that for uh
[58:59] people in many different languages he
[59:01] recently just did the seals book and
[59:04] it's redesigned so it's nicer to read
[59:06] and uh we printed it first in Spanish so
[59:10] these are Spanish books now that are
[59:12] arriving in South America from Mexico
[59:14] City down and also in the U.S here and
[59:18] uh that's that's been done and it's been
[59:21] a great blessing to the people in South
[59:24] America we are wanting to print now
[59:26] hundred thousand copies of these uh
[59:29] English books the English one is done
[59:31] it's at the printers and we want to do a
[59:33] hundred thousand so that we can
[59:35] distribute that in various countries
[59:37] that speak English so this is uh this
[59:40] has been a really great blessing and
[59:42] you'll see those books now arriving in a
[59:44] couple of weeks they'll be coming over
[59:46] here you'll Brothers George will have
[59:48] some we don't have a store we don't have
[59:50] an outlet so sometimes I have some books
[59:53] available to give people and most times
[59:54] I don't but in third world countries
[59:57] it's just a wonderful thing to see
[59:59] Believers here who contribute so that
[1:00:02] everyone in third world countries can
[1:00:04] get them free of charge and it says
[1:00:07] right inside the cover of the book that
[1:00:09] nothing can be sold everything can be
[1:00:11] reproduced and uh just to spread the the
[1:00:14] intent is just simply to spread the
[1:00:16] message of the hour and so that's what
[1:00:19] it's about so thank you for giving me
[1:00:21] just a little opportunity to share that
[1:00:22] with you and there are literally
[1:00:25] thousands and thousands and thousands
[1:00:28] more pictures like that of people around
[1:00:31] the world who are just excited to be
[1:00:32] getting materials now in their own
[1:00:34] language and again it's just an honor to
[1:00:36] be able to play a little part in that
[1:00:38] and your church has as well and Brother
[1:00:40] Sam has it we certainly do appreciate
[1:00:42] that support but let's turn to the word
[1:00:44] if that's all right and uh let's tackle
[1:00:48] a little subject this morning that I
[1:00:49] trust will be a blessing to you and I'm
[1:00:52] going to title this to Glorious church
[1:00:53] so we're going to take that little
[1:00:54] phrase out of verse 27 here in Ephesians
[1:00:57] 5 that he may present it to himself a
[1:01:00] glorious church now you might want to
[1:01:01] keep those lights off if you don't mind
[1:01:03] because we're going to use this screen
[1:01:04] the whole service here and uh I'm going
[1:01:07] to go through some of this quickly
[1:01:09] because some of it's going to be very
[1:01:11] basic here but I want you to catch a
[1:01:13] couple of principles that we'll uh that
[1:01:15] we'll use here now first of all I love
[1:01:17] this little statement in 1957 when
[1:01:20] brother random talks about the promises
[1:01:22] and he's talking about the promise of
[1:01:24] healing here and he says be merciful
[1:01:26] this is his prayer be merciful and heal
[1:01:28] the sick and afflicted for in this thou
[1:01:31] has atone for it calvary and we feel it
[1:01:34] is our personal property and I love the
[1:01:36] way he speaks about the promise here he
[1:01:38] said this this promise that he's made
[1:01:40] the thing that he's done for us he said
[1:01:42] we feel it's ours we feel like God has
[1:01:44] done this for us and and it's okay for
[1:01:47] you to feel that way that God has done
[1:01:48] this for you he died on the cross for
[1:01:50] you right and and by his stripes we are
[1:01:54] healed that's us he's talking about and
[1:01:57] now father May the Holy Spirit take the
[1:01:58] word open the book loose the power of
[1:02:00] the spirit in the word and may it find
[1:02:03] its resting place in each heart
[1:02:05] for we ask it in Jesus name and I think
[1:02:08] that's a good way to approach it this
[1:02:09] morning that no matter what your need is
[1:02:11] God has a way to resolve that need he
[1:02:13] has a way to meet it and we should
[1:02:15] embrace that promise as our own personal
[1:02:18] property and don't be afraid to do that
[1:02:20] because that's why he did it and I
[1:02:22] believe if we don't do that he could say
[1:02:24] to us at the end of the road why didn't
[1:02:26] you embrace it like it was yours I I
[1:02:28] paid I paid the price for it that you
[1:02:30] can have it and it's a shame for us not
[1:02:32] to embrace it like it is ours now I want
[1:02:35] to just drop this in as well and this
[1:02:37] was just on my heart that uh you know in
[1:02:40] in this life and we've talked to parents
[1:02:42] yesterday and we talked a lot about
[1:02:44] family life and the challenges of
[1:02:46] raising a Christian family in a very
[1:02:49] ungodly world
[1:02:50] and there are lots of lots of challenges
[1:02:53] and there will be increasing amounts of
[1:02:55] challenges as we go forward but I
[1:02:57] believe this that God never allows you
[1:02:59] to go into a battle unless he knows
[1:03:01] you're prepared to face that enemy
[1:03:05] when you go into a battle it should let
[1:03:08] you know that there is a victory ahead
[1:03:11] because God does not allow you to go
[1:03:12] into battle unless you're prepared for
[1:03:14] it
[1:03:16] now you'll find in Exodus chapter 13 and
[1:03:18] it came to pass when Pharaoh had let the
[1:03:20] people go that God LED them not through
[1:03:22] the way of the land of the Philistines
[1:03:24] although that was near and
[1:03:26] geographically it is very near I've
[1:03:27] driven that path from Egypt to Israel uh
[1:03:30] in a vehicle and it is quite close to go
[1:03:32] that way but God didn't let them go that
[1:03:35] way because God said less per Adventure
[1:03:38] the people repent when they see war and
[1:03:40] they return to Egypt so in other words
[1:03:42] we're not ready to enter into that
[1:03:44] battle so God brought him around it but
[1:03:46] when God LED but God led the people
[1:03:48] about through the way of the Wilderness
[1:03:50] of the Red Sea the children of Israel
[1:03:52] went up harnessed out of the land of
[1:03:53] Egypt so they went another way God LED
[1:03:56] them another way because they were not
[1:03:58] meant to go into battle so quickly but
[1:04:00] over in Exodus chapter 17 you find then
[1:04:03] came amalek and fought with Israel and
[1:04:05] refered him and Moses said unto Joshua
[1:04:07] choose us out men go out now and fight
[1:04:09] with amalek
[1:04:10] four chapters later God says all right
[1:04:12] these folks now are ready to fight and
[1:04:15] the you know there had been things
[1:04:17] happen between Exodus 13 and exodus 17
[1:04:19] and God says hey we now we have an enemy
[1:04:22] let's fight let's we're not going to go
[1:04:24] around this one we're going to fight it
[1:04:25] and and if God allowed them to go go
[1:04:28] face that enemy there was a way through
[1:04:30] that enemy
[1:04:32] so in the same way some of you may feel
[1:04:34] like well I'm fighting battles that's a
[1:04:36] sign that God sees you're ready to face
[1:04:38] that enemy face to face and so you
[1:04:40] shouldn't be afraid when you have uh
[1:04:42] struggles and you have enemies in your
[1:04:44] life and you have problems and so forth
[1:04:46] hey God would never have allowed that
[1:04:48] unless you were ready to face it and we
[1:04:50] should look for victory as we as we move
[1:04:52] on forward is that okay
[1:04:54] all right now I began to a little study
[1:04:57] at home uh several months ago where I
[1:05:00] was looking at this particular scripture
[1:05:02] for their shall arise false christs and
[1:05:03] false prophets and show great signs and
[1:05:06] wonders in so much that if it were
[1:05:08] possible they shall deceive the very
[1:05:10] elect and I thought wow how close is
[1:05:12] this going to come
[1:05:14] how how how close is this how false is
[1:05:17] this going to be now the best kind of
[1:05:20] Falls if that's if that's a an allowable
[1:05:23] statement the best kind of faults is
[1:05:25] really close to the truth
[1:05:27] it's really deceptive if it's really
[1:05:30] false I mean if it's if it's really
[1:05:32] going to be effective and so therefore I
[1:05:34] was wondering well what what kind of
[1:05:37] qualities do we need to possess what do
[1:05:39] we need to have to have I mean we know
[1:05:41] we had to be born again we know we had
[1:05:42] to be filled with the Holy Spirit right
[1:05:43] we know that but what what kinds of
[1:05:46] things are we going to need to have in
[1:05:48] order to navigate through a season where
[1:05:51] they're going to be false christs false
[1:05:53] prophets signs and wonders everything
[1:05:55] laid out to deceive the elect if
[1:05:57] possible it'll be so close that everyone
[1:06:00] but the elect will struggle with this in
[1:06:02] this season
[1:06:03] and so what is it that we're going to
[1:06:05] need to get through this and I began to
[1:06:07] look at that and as I as I began to
[1:06:09] study the scripture I found that uh you
[1:06:12] know there there are things that God has
[1:06:14] given to us in this age that that no
[1:06:15] other ages had access to
[1:06:17] and I realized well God knew we needed
[1:06:20] what we have in this last day and
[1:06:22] brother random says in the conduct order
[1:06:24] and Doctrine book he says we do have
[1:06:26] today by God's help the perfect
[1:06:29] interpretation of the word
[1:06:32] with Divine vindication
[1:06:34] now we all know what what Vindication is
[1:06:37] Right Vindication is God removing any
[1:06:39] doubt that this is God
[1:06:43] when God removes any doubt that this is
[1:06:45] God that's Divine vindication
[1:06:48] and that's what God did in in sending
[1:06:50] this message isn't that right do you
[1:06:52] believe that God Vindicated this message
[1:06:54] when he sent it he removed any doubt as
[1:06:56] to whether this was God or not truly I
[1:06:58] believe that God sent this message I
[1:07:00] believe that brother Branham was that
[1:07:01] Prophet that fulfilled Malachi 4. he was
[1:07:03] that individual that did that Martin
[1:07:05] Luther said and I've read this in Martin
[1:07:07] Luther's writings where he said he felt
[1:07:09] he was Malachi 4 because he was Leading
[1:07:12] the People out of the Catholic church
[1:07:13] and he felt like my Ministry could be
[1:07:15] that to turn the hearts of the children
[1:07:16] back to the fathers and you know what he
[1:07:18] made a good argument but he wasn't right
[1:07:20] it was almost right but he wasn't right
[1:07:22] because it wasn't a season it wasn't the
[1:07:24] right time for that and even though he
[1:07:26] did a great job at reforming and brought
[1:07:28] a truth to the church there had to be
[1:07:30] someone to come and when he came when
[1:07:32] brother Branham came God Vindicated that
[1:07:34] and said this is that which is spoken in
[1:07:36] the scripture and he removed any doubt
[1:07:38] as to whether this is God or not and and
[1:07:40] that is what we mean by Divine
[1:07:42] Vindication but think about this
[1:07:44] statement here either brother Branham is
[1:07:46] very right or he's very wrong one or the
[1:07:49] other there's no halfway with a
[1:07:51] statement like this there's no sort of
[1:07:54] right
[1:07:55] I mean he's telling us that we have
[1:07:58] by God's grace and God's help the
[1:08:01] perfect interpretation of the word
[1:08:05] so therefore there's nothing nothing
[1:08:07] really that we cannot know and nothing
[1:08:10] that we cannot understand correctly
[1:08:12] because God made that available to us in
[1:08:15] the last day well we know this that
[1:08:17] faith comes by hearing doesn't it and
[1:08:18] hearing by the word of God so therefore
[1:08:20] your faith had to be right you're sorry
[1:08:22] your hearing had to be right in order
[1:08:24] for your faith to be right
[1:08:26] and God decided what we were going to
[1:08:28] hear in this last day and he gave us a
[1:08:30] perfect interpretation of the word
[1:08:32] because we're actually going to leave
[1:08:34] here without death we're going to
[1:08:36] transition from here to the kingdom
[1:08:37] without death do you believe that we're
[1:08:40] going to leave here alive
[1:08:42] and I believe that God knew we needed
[1:08:44] that because that's what it was going to
[1:08:46] take a perfect faith and a you know a
[1:08:49] perfect Deliverance for the people of
[1:08:50] God
[1:08:51] so brother Branham tells us in the
[1:08:53] breach he said that the lamb broke the
[1:08:54] seals and revealed them to his church to
[1:08:57] collect his subjects for his kingdom
[1:09:00] that's the bride page 139 he says I no
[1:09:03] longer call you church I call your bride
[1:09:04] and he said he wants to and this is this
[1:09:07] is what God's actually doing now he
[1:09:08] wants to bring his subjects to him now
[1:09:11] he wants to bring his subjects to him
[1:09:13] now this is no longer moving them from
[1:09:15] one stage to another from one age to
[1:09:18] another from one truth to another this
[1:09:21] is actually we're going to shut this
[1:09:22] down we're going to take the bride home
[1:09:24] we are going to leave here now we're not
[1:09:26] going to reform this world we're not
[1:09:27] going to reform the government uh we're
[1:09:29] not going to we're not going to carry on
[1:09:31] for ages and ages now that's done that's
[1:09:34] over we are going home now
[1:09:36] we are going home now and that's that's
[1:09:38] what this is about you're not being
[1:09:40] conditioned to live here you're being
[1:09:42] conditioned to live here
[1:09:45] and that's biblical because you remember
[1:09:46] before Moses left a scene he taught the
[1:09:49] people how to live in that land while
[1:09:51] they were still in this land
[1:09:54] he gave them principles and truths that
[1:09:56] they needed to apply beginning now so
[1:09:58] that when you get there you'll realize
[1:10:01] hey the same word we live by here that's
[1:10:04] the same word we live by over there if
[1:10:06] you love God over here you'll love them
[1:10:07] over there if you love the things of God
[1:10:10] you over here you'll love them over
[1:10:11] there if you love the people of God over
[1:10:14] here you love them over there
[1:10:16] if you don't like the people of God over
[1:10:17] here you're not going to like him over
[1:10:19] there
[1:10:20] matter of fact you're probably not going
[1:10:21] to get over there to dislike him
[1:10:24] so that's what's happening and then
[1:10:26] brother random says never before in 1963
[1:10:29] never before since the early church was
[1:10:31] the pillar of fire ever among the people
[1:10:33] and never before since the early church
[1:10:35] did they ever see the things that we're
[1:10:37] seeing today
[1:10:38] and this was made possible when God
[1:10:40] opened those seals hey he's either
[1:10:42] really right or he's really wrong one or
[1:10:45] the other and I'm gonna you know I feel
[1:10:47] for those people that bet the firm and
[1:10:49] the fact that brother Brandon was wrong
[1:10:50] and built all kinds of websites and
[1:10:52] propaganda out there that are trying to
[1:10:54] prove that he's wrong when God said no I
[1:10:56] want the whole world to know that is my
[1:10:58] man that is my prophet and this is my
[1:11:01] message and you need to understand this
[1:11:03] is not brother branham's message and
[1:11:05] this is not your message and this is not
[1:11:07] brother Sam's message I got news for you
[1:11:09] this is not even brother Sam's church
[1:11:10] this is God's church he died for this
[1:11:13] church he purchased this church and he's
[1:11:16] going to take this church and that's
[1:11:18] what's happening now he's actually
[1:11:19] taking his subjects to him now
[1:11:22] we're on the way
[1:11:23] so God is now loosening up don't you
[1:11:27] love these definitive statements of
[1:11:29] brother random they're so great he said
[1:11:31] God's loosening up the church everywhere
[1:11:33] getting in order now and got to give it
[1:11:36] rapturing Faith before it can go
[1:11:38] God is actually loosening up the church
[1:11:40] I thank God for that you know you know I
[1:11:43] think about the uh the Jews over in
[1:11:45] Russia and many years you know we were
[1:11:47] unable to uh to to bring the message in
[1:11:50] or to minister over there and Jews were
[1:11:52] not able to get out uh for many many
[1:11:54] years that happened I mean if you were
[1:11:56] if if we were living in Russia and I
[1:11:59] wanted to come to visit brother Sam's
[1:12:01] Church uh I would I would if either
[1:12:03] living in Russia under the Communist
[1:12:05] Regime before the Iron Curtain fell I
[1:12:08] would have to have applied for a Visa in
[1:12:11] order to leave my town to come here and
[1:12:14] that process probably would have taken
[1:12:16] three or four months
[1:12:17] in order for me to go if I wanted to go
[1:12:19] from here to Toledo if I wanted to leave
[1:12:21] this County and go to another County I
[1:12:23] would have had to have a a Visa issued
[1:12:25] by the Russian government and I would
[1:12:27] have had to uh write down where I left
[1:12:30] from where I was going to stay how many
[1:12:32] days I was going to stay there who I was
[1:12:34] going to be with when I went there and
[1:12:37] then the dates that I was going to
[1:12:38] return and that would take months and
[1:12:40] months to get those kinds of Visas so
[1:12:42] they were completely locked down I mean
[1:12:44] they were held tight but God in his
[1:12:46] sovereignty allowed the Iron Curtain to
[1:12:48] fall and the Soviet Union to break up
[1:12:51] so that so that two things could happen
[1:12:53] number one so that the Jews could leave
[1:12:56] and freely go back to Israel in their
[1:12:58] Homeland and also so that the message
[1:13:00] could come in
[1:13:01] and God loosened things up in order for
[1:13:04] that to happen and you know what God is
[1:13:06] still loosening things up God loosened
[1:13:09] us from drugs and from a sinful life God
[1:13:11] loosened us from denominational systems
[1:13:14] God loosened us from the bondage of this
[1:13:16] world and the ties of this world in
[1:13:19] order to set us free so that we can
[1:13:21] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:13:23] and he whom the son sets free is free
[1:13:25] indeed
[1:13:26] so therefore we see what God is doing
[1:13:28] now he's loosening his church because
[1:13:29] he's wanting to take them home with him
[1:13:31] and in order to do that God's given us
[1:13:33] an infallible word he's given us a
[1:13:35] perfect interpretation of the word with
[1:13:37] Divine Vindication hey we're a blessed
[1:13:40] people
[1:13:42] and and we've seen this it's been
[1:13:44] Illustrated Through the Ages here in the
[1:13:46] symbol of a pyramid from the early
[1:13:47] church to the bride age all the way to
[1:13:49] the very end and this is what brother
[1:13:51] Branham said in invisible Union the word
[1:13:53] that fell on the day of Pentecost will
[1:13:55] not work for this day
[1:13:58] that was for Pentecost
[1:14:00] thank God for that word but that's not
[1:14:02] my word that's not my message today this
[1:14:06] is for the bride the going home of the
[1:14:09] Bride this message that God sent is for
[1:14:12] the going home of the Bride do you
[1:14:13] believe that this message is for the
[1:14:15] bride leaving and we've got something
[1:14:18] different the Pentecostals represented
[1:14:20] that again he says but we're in that
[1:14:22] bright age and this is for the going
[1:14:24] home of the Bride so God in every age I
[1:14:27] I like to illustrate it this way you
[1:14:28] know I'm in illustrator uh God God sent
[1:14:31] out the message in every age as a
[1:14:32] reformer here's the message here's the
[1:14:34] here's here's what they have need of in
[1:14:36] that day and God probably watched and
[1:14:38] supervised the distribution of that over
[1:14:40] all the ages there because he was you
[1:14:42] know wanting to reach the elect and then
[1:14:43] in the last of it before the message
[1:14:45] came out God says hey hold on with that
[1:14:48] hold on with that I need to get
[1:14:49] something first before you send that out
[1:14:51] and he takes he takes rapturing faith
[1:14:54] and he says I'm going to pour that no
[1:14:57] other age gets this
[1:14:59] any
[1:15:01] all right let it go
[1:15:05] God reserved that for the last age
[1:15:07] because this is for the going home of
[1:15:09] the Bride
[1:15:10] if God had given that to every any other
[1:15:12] age they would have been raptured
[1:15:14] probably at the end of their time but
[1:15:15] God did not intend for that to happen
[1:15:17] because you needed to be here but in the
[1:15:19] last day God said I'm going to put
[1:15:21] something in that that I've not put in
[1:15:23] any other age and that's going to change
[1:15:24] their bodies that's going to get us out
[1:15:27] of here
[1:15:29] we have a perfect interpretation of the
[1:15:31] word with Divine Vindication we no
[1:15:34] longer see in part
[1:15:36] and that is literally in the Greek it
[1:15:38] means that like a jigsaw puzzle have you
[1:15:41] ever done a puzzle and at the end of it
[1:15:42] there's three or four pieces missing ah
[1:15:45] I mean it's a total failure it's a
[1:15:47] disaster even though you got everything
[1:15:49] else almost right but now that you got
[1:15:51] three or four pieces missing you're like
[1:15:53] hey sweeping aside I mean you know how
[1:15:55] you feel when you get when you do that
[1:15:56] who took these pieces of the puzzle
[1:15:59] right and what a joy it is when you find
[1:16:01] them and you put those last pieces in
[1:16:03] there oh yeah now we got it right now we
[1:16:05] got it done that's exactly what God did
[1:16:07] Through the Ages there were pieces that
[1:16:09] we never had there were parts of it that
[1:16:11] we never understood there were things
[1:16:13] that people probed at and they wondered
[1:16:15] at and they got a lot of it right and
[1:16:17] they wrote different things there and in
[1:16:19] the last day God sent a prophet who put
[1:16:21] all those loose ends together and he
[1:16:23] took a scripture over here and he took
[1:16:25] one over here and he put that together
[1:16:26] and said these go together and he took
[1:16:28] another one here and another one here he
[1:16:30] went back to Psalm 27 and he said uh you
[1:16:33] know in the time of trouble I will hide
[1:16:35] you in my Pavilion and he takes that and
[1:16:37] he brings it over here to first
[1:16:38] Thessalonians chapter four and he puts
[1:16:40] that together and said these relate to
[1:16:42] the Rapture that's what that's about and
[1:16:44] then he goes over here in Matthew 24 and
[1:16:46] he goes over to Revelation chapter 5 6
[1:16:48] and 7 the seals and puts those things
[1:16:50] together he said it's not outside the
[1:16:52] book it's inside the book but you needed
[1:16:54] somebody to put the loose hands together
[1:16:56] and that's what we had in this last day
[1:16:58] and now we can stand back and say we got
[1:17:01] the perfect interpretation of the word
[1:17:03] with Divine Vindication you know why God
[1:17:06] did that because he loved you
[1:17:08] he loves you now
[1:17:12] Joshua said now you're going to see the
[1:17:15] glory of God for their their hung the
[1:17:18] pillar of fire over them but he said
[1:17:20] don't let it get out of sight in this
[1:17:22] part of the journey here crossing the
[1:17:24] Jordan going into the promised land he
[1:17:26] said don't let it get out of sight
[1:17:28] because you've never passed this way
[1:17:29] before and I believe he said there's an
[1:17:32] experience for the church
[1:17:34] he said to you people tonight let's move
[1:17:36] out towards Jordan and God's here
[1:17:39] leading you and that's what's talking to
[1:17:42] your heart and telling it to you is the
[1:17:44] holy spirit so he's signaling to the
[1:17:46] church you are here
[1:17:49] right prophets Orient us
[1:17:52] prophets Orient us you know how it is
[1:17:55] when you go in the mall and the first
[1:17:57] thing that you do is the first thing I
[1:17:58] do
[1:17:59] my wife doesn't need to do this but I
[1:18:01] need to do this when I go in the mall I
[1:18:03] look at that directory and I'm looking
[1:18:05] for the Red Dot
[1:18:07] right everybody know what the Red Dot is
[1:18:09] what does the Red Dot say
[1:18:11] you're here
[1:18:13] and without that without that you could
[1:18:16] be anywhere
[1:18:18] and you don't even know right you don't
[1:18:20] you really don't even know
[1:18:22] but the Red Dot helps us immensely
[1:18:25] because then we know ah if I want to go
[1:18:28] here
[1:18:29] then I I start from here right
[1:18:32] prophets bring the Red Dot
[1:18:35] and they put it on the timeline of God
[1:18:37] and they say you're here
[1:18:39] that's what prophets do
[1:18:41] because otherwise you really don't know
[1:18:42] where you are
[1:18:43] you could be in the Reformation think
[1:18:45] you're in you're thinking you're at the
[1:18:46] end time
[1:18:47] but prophets say we're here
[1:18:50] and he says now we're crossing over and
[1:18:53] he said I can see the people as they
[1:18:54] went marching on the angel took Jordan
[1:18:56] first and he said the angel will of God
[1:18:59] will lead you every step of the way
[1:19:02] what I like about this is what it
[1:19:04] doesn't say it doesn't say William
[1:19:06] Branham will lead you every step of the
[1:19:08] way
[1:19:09] you don't need to hang back and play
[1:19:11] tapes and wait for some plane to come
[1:19:13] across the country with brother Branham
[1:19:15] in it let me tell you I believe we'll
[1:19:16] see brother Branham again on this side
[1:19:18] but I believe it'll be in the
[1:19:19] resurrection
[1:19:21] but he says the angel of God will lead
[1:19:23] you every step of the way now I'll say
[1:19:25] this I say this quite honestly if God
[1:19:27] wanted brother Branham if God wanted
[1:19:29] William Brandon would be standing here
[1:19:30] in the last day to bring the bride
[1:19:32] across brother Branham would be here
[1:19:34] but he's not here because if brother
[1:19:36] Brandon was here we'd all have our eyes
[1:19:38] on him
[1:19:39] but I believe this a greater than
[1:19:40] William Branham is here
[1:19:42] [Applause]
[1:19:42] [Music]
[1:19:45] and God wanted us God wanted us to
[1:19:48] follow him by faith to follow him by
[1:19:50] faith not William Branham God wanted us
[1:19:52] to follow him by faith
[1:19:55] and he says now sometimes you think your
[1:19:57] trials are hard but he said God ain't in
[1:19:59] a hurry you're the one that's in a hurry
[1:20:01] and God let the Hebrew children go right
[1:20:03] in the fiery furnace and he let Daniel
[1:20:05] go right in the Lion's Den before he
[1:20:06] ever came but he said just rise up and
[1:20:09] start walking by faith
[1:20:12] rise up and start walking by faith and I
[1:20:15] I began to think about that and I
[1:20:16] thought well you know we have to have
[1:20:18] whatever it takes that we would not be
[1:20:20] deceived but we also have to have this
[1:20:22] kind of faith that allows us to be able
[1:20:25] to rise up and walk
[1:20:27] and we are following him who is
[1:20:30] invisible
[1:20:31] to a place we've never been
[1:20:34] that takes a that takes quite a measure
[1:20:36] of trust
[1:20:37] if if that's all right to say because
[1:20:40] we're following him we cannot see what
[1:20:42] our natural eye into a place we've never
[1:20:45] been through a channel we've never
[1:20:47] crossed before we've never been raptured
[1:20:49] we never we've never had our bodies
[1:20:51] changed right I mean I can't even lose
[1:20:53] five pounds I mean it's very hard for me
[1:20:55] to change very much at all
[1:20:59] so I want to I want to deal with this
[1:21:02] little subject of Faith here this
[1:21:03] morning just very simply all right
[1:21:05] forgive me for being simple you can put
[1:21:07] your theological guns back in your
[1:21:09] ecclesiastical holsters this morning
[1:21:12] and just follow me here in Exodus
[1:21:14] chapter 4 I found this to be an amazing
[1:21:16] little passage of scripture Moses
[1:21:18] answered and said but behold they won't
[1:21:20] believe me no hearken unto my voice for
[1:21:22] they'll say the Lord has now appeared
[1:21:23] unto thee and you know what this is in a
[1:21:26] way
[1:21:28] this is Moses kind of arguing with God
[1:21:31] I mean I don't mean to be disrespectful
[1:21:33] but God says all right Moses time to go
[1:21:35] down we're going to deliver the children
[1:21:36] of Israel hey hey hold on really
[1:21:39] uh they're not going to believe me
[1:21:43] and I thought Josh
[1:21:45] I thought
[1:21:46] why didn't God strike him dead
[1:21:50] I mean
[1:21:51] it's not a good thing to argue with God
[1:21:53] generally I mean that's not a good
[1:21:55] practice
[1:21:57] generally and he says
[1:22:00] uh no way
[1:22:03] and they were going to say all kinds of
[1:22:04] things they're going to say well the
[1:22:05] Lord didn't send you and who do you
[1:22:07] think you are and all you can't even
[1:22:09] speak right and all the other things
[1:22:11] here and and God says
[1:22:13] because God's conversing with Moses and
[1:22:16] he says what do you got in your hand
[1:22:18] I stick throw it down watch
[1:22:22] what I'll do with the stick
[1:22:24] and Moses throws it down and becomes a
[1:22:26] serpent and whoa that's pretty good
[1:22:30] because you know what God doesn't need
[1:22:31] great things to do great things
[1:22:35] I said God doesn't need great things to
[1:22:37] do great things
[1:22:39] I believe that's why he chose a lot of
[1:22:40] us brother Bill in the last day
[1:22:44] because he doesn't need great things to
[1:22:45] do great things
[1:22:48] and so he says now Moses uh picked that
[1:22:53] up and Moses picked up and now you got
[1:22:55] to watch because you got to pick up a
[1:22:56] snake by the not the working end but the
[1:22:58] other end right you gotta he picks it up
[1:23:00] and it goes back into a stick again whoa
[1:23:03] and you know what God is saying in the
[1:23:05] in the Hebrew language what God has
[1:23:06] actually was trying to say to Moses was
[1:23:08] look Moses I got this
[1:23:12] this this is not you here I got this
[1:23:15] what you need to do is trust me
[1:23:20] I I can take your stick I can turn it
[1:23:22] into this I can I can open up the Red
[1:23:24] Sea I can do I can do all things that
[1:23:26] Moses hasn't even heard of yet
[1:23:28] and God was simply assuring Moses in
[1:23:31] this conversation I got this I got your
[1:23:33] back
[1:23:34] I'm not sending you to do something you
[1:23:36] can't do
[1:23:37] that would defeat the whole purpose
[1:23:39] right but look I made a promise to
[1:23:41] Abraham and I'm here now to bring this
[1:23:42] to pass so this is not really about you
[1:23:45] this is about me using you to fulfill my
[1:23:49] promise to Abraham I made hundreds of
[1:23:52] years ago
[1:23:53] hey trust me buddy
[1:23:55] now I'd like to say this this morning
[1:23:57] and I hope you can hope you'll uh
[1:24:00] Embrace this in the right way
[1:24:03] I believe that faith and the faith we
[1:24:05] need in the last day
[1:24:07] sits on the shoulders of our trust in
[1:24:10] God
[1:24:12] it actually rests on our trusted God
[1:24:16] faith comes by hearing we believe that
[1:24:19] but you know what you'll have faith in
[1:24:21] something more when you trust the person
[1:24:25] who's telling you
[1:24:27] when you trust the source you're going
[1:24:30] to eat more easily have faith in someone
[1:24:32] isn't that right
[1:24:35] so this is that conversation and I'd
[1:24:38] like to summarize that and say this that
[1:24:41] Moses never had a problem with faith in
[1:24:43] God's existence hey he's in the presence
[1:24:45] of God he's seen God all through his
[1:24:48] life he's heard the stories of the
[1:24:50] exploits of God and all that he did up
[1:24:52] to Moses time he he's a he's a person
[1:24:55] who believes in God
[1:24:57] and I would I would venture to say that
[1:24:59] every one of us here today probably have
[1:25:01] a good solid faith in the existence of
[1:25:04] God you believe that God exists right
[1:25:05] that he's real even though we can't see
[1:25:07] him but that God is real I think I don't
[1:25:09] think we'd have any argument there and I
[1:25:11] don't think we need to spend any more
[1:25:12] time on that I think we all believe that
[1:25:14] God exists
[1:25:15] but the kind of faith I believe that God
[1:25:18] is asking us in the last day is can I
[1:25:20] trust him for me
[1:25:24] will God really do that for me
[1:25:27] I hear how God does things for prophets
[1:25:29] and for other people and might be
[1:25:31] Brother Sam you know or whatever else
[1:25:32] but you sitting there in the Pew the
[1:25:34] average person who the believer comes to
[1:25:37] church can can can I really trust him
[1:25:40] that God's going to do this for me
[1:25:43] and that's the debate if you like that's
[1:25:45] the conversation that God is having with
[1:25:47] Moses here as Moses say Lord I believe I
[1:25:50] believe your word I believe you and I
[1:25:52] believe you're real and all of that but
[1:25:53] I mean
[1:25:55] okay
[1:25:56] can I trust you to bring this to pass
[1:25:59] God says yeah you can trust me
[1:26:01] trust me
[1:26:03] some of you are looking at me kind of
[1:26:05] funny but I can handle that
[1:26:07] let's look at this let's develop this
[1:26:09] just a little bit here
[1:26:11] in the Book of Ruth chapter three
[1:26:14] this is a story of how Ruth goes to be
[1:26:17] with Boaz and she spends that night you
[1:26:19] remember sleeping at his feet and when
[1:26:21] she goes back to Naomi she's got her
[1:26:23] veil full of six measures of barley that
[1:26:26] he gave to me and she comes back to Ruth
[1:26:27] or sorry to Naomi and she said this is
[1:26:30] what he told me he'd go down empty to
[1:26:32] thy mother-in-law go back and then Naomi
[1:26:35] said to her sit still my daughter until
[1:26:37] thou know how the matter will fall for
[1:26:40] the man will not be in rest until he
[1:26:42] have finished the thing this day
[1:26:44] in other words there's nothing more now
[1:26:46] we can do
[1:26:47] Ruther there's nothing that you and I
[1:26:50] can do now to to complete this process
[1:26:52] you know what it all depends on Boaz
[1:26:55] we're looking to Boaz we've done
[1:26:56] everything we can do we've done
[1:26:58] everything we know to do and uh We've
[1:27:00] made ourselves available we've fulfilled
[1:27:02] everything we need to do but you know
[1:27:04] what this all rests on Boaz now and you
[1:27:06] know what we're going to do we're going
[1:27:07] to rest in what Boaz has promised to do
[1:27:10] we're going to rest in what Boaz is able
[1:27:12] to do and we're just gonna we're just
[1:27:14] gonna trust it he's gonna do it he's got
[1:27:16] this
[1:27:18] do you understand what I'm saying he's
[1:27:20] Naomi is assuring Ruth here this is not
[1:27:24] necessary now for you to fulfill this
[1:27:27] you can't redeem yourself you cannot uh
[1:27:29] I mean you're not you can't be a kinsman
[1:27:31] redeemer it has to be someone besides us
[1:27:34] and so therefore what you need to do is
[1:27:36] rest and I'm saying this to you this
[1:27:37] morning as the bride of Christ there's
[1:27:39] nothing more we can do to make ourselves
[1:27:41] more eternal there's nothing more that
[1:27:43] we can do to make ourselves more bride
[1:27:45] we are bribed by the choosing of God we
[1:27:48] are bribed by the predestinated plan of
[1:27:50] God he put her name in Lamb's Book of
[1:27:52] Life a long time ago and let me tell you
[1:27:54] something you know what we got to do we
[1:27:56] gotta rest in in God we've got to have
[1:27:58] trust in God that he's actually going to
[1:28:00] bring to pass what he promised me that
[1:28:03] God is actually going to take me across
[1:28:04] that River he's going to take me into
[1:28:06] that place and he's got a body for me
[1:28:08] and he's got a place for me in the lamb
[1:28:11] supper uh over on the other side and you
[1:28:13] know what you got to do bride you can't
[1:28:15] make this happen you can't speed it up
[1:28:17] you can slow it down you just got to
[1:28:19] believe that he's got it he's got your
[1:28:21] back you can trust in that
[1:28:28] does that make sense
[1:28:30] now there's a scripture in Luke chapter
[1:28:31] five brother man refers to this many
[1:28:33] times and it's it's the the scripture
[1:28:35] about putting new wine into Old bottles
[1:28:38] doesn't work
[1:28:39] don't try this at home
[1:28:41] you shouldn't have wine at home anyway
[1:28:43] else the new wine will burst the bottles
[1:28:45] and be spilled in the bottles will
[1:28:47] perish you got to match the right
[1:28:50] can I say this you got to match the
[1:28:51] right Revelation with the right age and
[1:28:53] the right people
[1:28:54] otherwise it's not going to work right
[1:28:57] because that's what wine is it's a
[1:28:59] stimulation new wine must be put into
[1:29:01] new bottles and then both are preserved
[1:29:03] now brother Branham says this about that
[1:29:05] scripture and he's using this as a
[1:29:07] teaching uh lesson here he says now
[1:29:10] people will say our school teaches
[1:29:12] different our denominations say that he
[1:29:14] said that's the old dry cowhide
[1:29:16] so that's inflexible it's dried you put
[1:29:19] something in there with life and you
[1:29:20] know what it's gonna it's gonna break
[1:29:21] that wide open and our teachers and our
[1:29:24] Pastor said these things are finished
[1:29:25] the days of Miracles are over but he
[1:29:27] said if it's a new hide and it's got new
[1:29:30] life it's flexible
[1:29:32] and it gives to the word
[1:29:35] and here it is the spirit
[1:29:37] supports that word
[1:29:41] the spirit of God
[1:29:44] supports the word of God
[1:29:52] the spirit
[1:29:54] doesn't necessarily support your point
[1:29:56] of view
[1:30:01] the spirit doesn't
[1:30:03] support the fact that you've been in the
[1:30:05] church a long time
[1:30:10] some people think well I've been around
[1:30:11] a long time I'm qualified to do this I'm
[1:30:13] qualified to say this I'm qualified to
[1:30:14] preach whatever I want hey how long does
[1:30:17] that take
[1:30:18] to get to that place I don't know about
[1:30:20] you but Sam I got my 44 year pin
[1:30:23] I've been serving the lord 44 years in
[1:30:25] the light of this message does that give
[1:30:26] me right to say whatever I want to or to
[1:30:29] feel like I have some Authority or
[1:30:30] something else
[1:30:31] you know what the spirit supports not my
[1:30:33] seniority the spirit supports the word
[1:30:36] and when you make a stand on the word
[1:30:38] the spirit will support that when your
[1:30:40] pastor obeys the word and makes changes
[1:30:42] in the church it might be like uh you
[1:30:44] know Nails on a chalkboard but the
[1:30:46] spirit will support that
[1:30:49] sometimes you as fathers and mothers
[1:30:50] you'll make changes in your house you
[1:30:52] know in relation to social media or
[1:30:54] whatever else and your kids may look at
[1:30:56] it like rubbing a cat the wrong way ever
[1:30:58] done that
[1:30:59] and you rub a cat the wrong way my
[1:31:02] goodness uh it may not be easy but the
[1:31:04] spirit will support them because the
[1:31:06] spirit supports the word the spirit does
[1:31:08] not support your point of view it
[1:31:10] doesn't support your attitude he doesn't
[1:31:12] support uh you know the amount of money
[1:31:14] that you give he doesn't so he's not
[1:31:16] saying you know what they're not they're
[1:31:18] not completely on the word but they give
[1:31:19] a lot division books so you know what
[1:31:21] I'm going to give them a pass
[1:31:24] how's that going
[1:31:27] I'm dropping these things in here
[1:31:29] because I want you to hold on to them
[1:31:31] the spirit will support the word and and
[1:31:33] he says when they when they come into a
[1:31:35] new bottle when the inspiration comes
[1:31:37] into a new bottle and say well somebody
[1:31:39] got healed the cancer last evening
[1:31:40] people will say well let me see what the
[1:31:42] doctor says and let's wait for a year
[1:31:44] from now and I can't believe it but the
[1:31:46] new hide says hallelujah to the lamb
[1:31:50] you can't put new wine into Old bottles
[1:31:52] there
[1:31:53] so the principle you always have to
[1:31:55] understand you young people that are
[1:31:56] here this the spirit is not going to
[1:31:58] support you trying to find a husband or
[1:32:01] a wife the wrong way there is a right
[1:32:03] way to go about that there's a right way
[1:32:05] for you to worship there's a right way
[1:32:07] for you to play music in the church
[1:32:09] there's a right way for you to conduct
[1:32:11] yourself in life there's a right way for
[1:32:13] you to conduct yourself in your marital
[1:32:15] relations between husband and wife
[1:32:16] there's a right way to do that and when
[1:32:18] you do those things within the confines
[1:32:19] of the word of God the spirit will
[1:32:21] support them he'll bless that but don't
[1:32:23] expect God to bless something that's
[1:32:25] contrary to the word he's just not going
[1:32:27] to do it
[1:32:30] all right now
[1:32:36] let's just take these principles now of
[1:32:39] trust here
[1:32:41] and just apply them Daniel chapter three
[1:32:43] you all know the story of the Three
[1:32:44] Hebrew children
[1:32:46] they said to the king hey we
[1:32:49] we're not we're not careful we're not
[1:32:51] worried that word in the Hebrew for
[1:32:53] careful means worry we're not worried at
[1:32:56] all to give you an answer we have an
[1:32:58] answer as to why we're not bowing to
[1:33:00] this image here even if it is our buddy
[1:33:02] if it be so God whom we serve will
[1:33:04] Deliver Us From The Burning fiery
[1:33:06] furnace and he will deliver us out of
[1:33:07] thine hand but if not be known unto the
[1:33:09] king that we will not serve thy Gods nor
[1:33:11] worship the golden image which thou has
[1:33:14] set up
[1:33:15] so we we really don't know what God is
[1:33:17] going to do here I mean that's in his
[1:33:19] hands we really just trust him but we
[1:33:22] want you to know what we're not going to
[1:33:24] do and that is that we're not going to
[1:33:25] bow to this we're not going to bow to
[1:33:27] this God and we're not going to bow out
[1:33:29] of your system of worship here so we do
[1:33:31] know that but they had no word we at
[1:33:34] least we don't know that they have uh
[1:33:35] any kind of indication that God was
[1:33:38] going to rescue them
[1:33:40] I mean the scene is pretty drastic
[1:33:41] because it says that they heated up the
[1:33:44] fire more and more and even people who
[1:33:46] were standing next to the fire dropped
[1:33:48] over dead because it was so overwhelming
[1:33:50] and God brought those three Hebrew
[1:33:52] children to the edge of impossible
[1:33:57] he brought them to the edge of
[1:33:58] impossible
[1:34:00] where now it was impossible to go
[1:34:02] forward and God said take another step
[1:34:07] is that what happened
[1:34:09] he brought them to the edge of the
[1:34:12] impossible now I mean under normal human
[1:34:15] conditions it's not possible for anybody
[1:34:17] to go any further and God says take
[1:34:19] another step
[1:34:23] and in order to take that step you know
[1:34:25] what they had to do they had to trust
[1:34:26] him
[1:34:27] they had a trust that somehow God was
[1:34:29] going to make this happen and but they
[1:34:31] were resolved in their hearts that if
[1:34:33] God did not do anything they still were
[1:34:35] not going to bow to that and they were
[1:34:36] they were winners either way because if
[1:34:38] God did something great but if God did
[1:34:40] nothing they were still winners because
[1:34:42] they'd be over in glory they never
[1:34:43] compromised at all I believe I believe
[1:34:46] that before this is all over I believe
[1:34:48] that God will bring us down to the edge
[1:34:50] of impossible and then tell the bride
[1:34:53] take another step and trust me I got
[1:34:55] your back trust me I'll see you through
[1:34:58] come on
[1:35:00] 9 11 proved to us that the world can
[1:35:03] change in a day
[1:35:05] and we've had lots of indications since
[1:35:07] then that our world is not very stable
[1:35:09] that there's all kinds of things that
[1:35:10] can happen really quickly and there are
[1:35:12] all kinds of uh you know issues in the
[1:35:15] world that can make it a very dangerous
[1:35:16] place in a very short period of time and
[1:35:18] there's a lot of people not going to
[1:35:19] have a whole lot of time to rethink
[1:35:21] things when all of that happens here and
[1:35:23] I believe when we come down to it there
[1:35:25] will be only one thing to do and that is
[1:35:27] to take that step with God to walk all
[1:35:29] the way because it may not be logical
[1:35:31] and it may not be clear like it's not
[1:35:33] logical to walk into the fiery furnace
[1:35:34] and just you know just keep walking
[1:35:36] that's not logical and it may not be
[1:35:38] logical for the bride to keep walking in
[1:35:40] the time when our bodies are about to be
[1:35:42] changed but I believe that God's not
[1:35:44] afraid to bring us to the edge of
[1:35:45] impossible and then say take another
[1:35:47] step and watch what I do take another
[1:35:50] step little bride take your leather step
[1:35:52] Ruth and just watch what I do for you
[1:35:56] and I believe that's what we're coming
[1:35:57] to and then Nebuchadnezzar spoke and
[1:35:59] said wow he said you've even you've even
[1:36:01] changed the king's word it says as you
[1:36:05] read down through this verse here you've
[1:36:06] even you've actually even changed the
[1:36:07] king's word and he says uh you know this
[1:36:10] this God that you serve is absolutely
[1:36:11] amazing
[1:36:14] um
[1:36:16] let me give you another little example
[1:36:17] here and I I love this where
[1:36:20] in in the book of First Samuel it's a
[1:36:22] story of how the Philistines are all
[1:36:25] encamped in the high place in the
[1:36:26] mountain and Saul and 600 soldiers are
[1:36:29] down in the lower part in the valley and
[1:36:31] they're over here uh you know facing
[1:36:34] that enemy and things are out of
[1:36:35] stalemate nothing no one's going
[1:36:36] nothing's happening no one's going
[1:36:38] anywhere
[1:36:39] and uh Jonathan
[1:36:41] Jonathan looks at this situation
[1:36:44] and uh he says to his armor Bearer by
[1:36:47] the way who I think is really the hero
[1:36:49] of this story he says that armor bear
[1:36:52] hey
[1:36:54] let's go
[1:36:56] let's do something
[1:36:58] and the armor Bearer says
[1:37:00] sure
[1:37:02] and he goes to it he goes with Jonathan
[1:37:06] and they're crawling along they're
[1:37:07] moving along behind the rocks and they
[1:37:09] come to a place where they're looking up
[1:37:10] at the enemy they're looking up at the
[1:37:11] Philistines they're hiding behind big
[1:37:13] rocks back there
[1:37:15] and they're looking up Jonathan says to
[1:37:18] his armor Bearer
[1:37:19] he says tell you what I'm going to do
[1:37:22] I'm gonna jump out behind this Rock I'm
[1:37:25] going to jump out and I'm going to yell
[1:37:27] at them and I'm going to say
[1:37:29] hey Philistines we're down here and if
[1:37:33] they say if they say
[1:37:35] well we're going to come down and kill
[1:37:37] you these are like dogs we're coming
[1:37:39] after you he says and we'll take off
[1:37:41] because that's a sign the Lord's not
[1:37:43] with us but but
[1:37:46] if we jump out and expose ourselves and
[1:37:49] and they say hey come up here you
[1:37:51] Israelites come up here we'll deal with
[1:37:53] you up here he said then the Battle Is
[1:37:56] Ours
[1:37:57] Victory Is Ours okay you know what the
[1:38:00] armor bear says
[1:38:01] sure
[1:38:02] he's a hero I mean he's just he's a
[1:38:04] great guy I'd love to I love doing you
[1:38:06] know I think in heaven I'm going to look
[1:38:08] for him
[1:38:09] and so Jonathan steps out and he says
[1:38:12] hey
[1:38:13] hey you Philistines up there look who it
[1:38:16] is it's us we're right here down below
[1:38:18] you and they look down they said hey
[1:38:20] come up here you Israelite dogs come on
[1:38:23] and we'll finish you off up here now the
[1:38:25] Bible says
[1:38:27] in verse 13 there that Jonathan climbed
[1:38:30] up on his hands and his feet now don't
[1:38:34] try this at home this is not how you win
[1:38:36] a battle brother Bill this is not how
[1:38:38] you this is not good strategy for taking
[1:38:40] the enemy when you're and if I if I
[1:38:42] could get up I'd get down but
[1:38:45] but it takes too long I don't have that
[1:38:47] time
[1:38:49] they're going up the hill on their hands
[1:38:51] and knees and they get to they're
[1:38:53] crawling up and they get to the top of
[1:38:55] the hill and then they stand up
[1:38:57] and you know what happens the Bible goes
[1:38:59] on and tells a story of how that they uh
[1:39:02] you know there was there was a confusion
[1:39:04] that took place and and they started to
[1:39:06] fight one another and then that got so
[1:39:08] loud that more of them started to fight
[1:39:10] one another and then the Israelites down
[1:39:12] here in the valley they looked over with
[1:39:13] their binoculars and they said hey yeah
[1:39:16] and I mean there must be some sort of
[1:39:17] enemy over there and uh you know they
[1:39:19] took off after the Philistines and the
[1:39:21] Philistines took off and the people who
[1:39:23] were hiding in the Rock Soul came out
[1:39:25] and it was one of these big confusing
[1:39:26] scenes there and Jonathan and his his
[1:39:29] armor bear are just kind of standing
[1:39:31] there in the camp and there's nobody
[1:39:32] left they're all gone and it says it
[1:39:35] took them three days to actually gather
[1:39:36] the spoil and bring it back to Israel
[1:39:39] again and the armor Bearer is just
[1:39:40] saying hey yeah well you know what I
[1:39:42] trust you
[1:39:48] it may not be logical
[1:39:51] it it may not be sensible
[1:39:54] but they came to the edge of impossible
[1:39:58] and God said go ahead and take another
[1:40:00] step and he did
[1:40:02] and when when you obey like that
[1:40:06] you watch what God will do
[1:40:09] so one of the characteristics of this
[1:40:11] glorious church is that she's obedient
[1:40:13] as a matter of fact here's what brother
[1:40:15] random says
[1:40:17] what a promise
[1:40:19] he said because of obedience patriarch
[1:40:20] Abraham 1964. what a promise he said
[1:40:23] obedience
[1:40:25] is what God wants
[1:40:28] a big church
[1:40:29] nobody says
[1:40:31] a lot of money
[1:40:32] famous preacher for a pastor
[1:40:35] nope obedience is what God wants what
[1:40:38] does God want from all of us
[1:40:40] he doesn't he doesn't want you to you
[1:40:42] know preach sermons that unscrew the
[1:40:44] Stars he does not want you to have a
[1:40:45] following he does not want you to
[1:40:47] accumulate a lot of wealth or whatever
[1:40:49] else he wants you to just simply be an
[1:40:51] obedient he wants you to have an
[1:40:52] obedient heart it was once said that
[1:40:54] obedience is better than sacrificing to
[1:40:56] obey the Lord is better than any
[1:40:58] sacrifice that you could do
[1:41:01] now a lot of times in reality a lot of
[1:41:03] times we feel like obedience is kind of
[1:41:06] a flat thing I mean it's not really a
[1:41:07] very exciting thing and a matter of fact
[1:41:09] you can think that you're in the slowest
[1:41:10] movement in the world because it may
[1:41:12] seem like nothing's happening
[1:41:14] and I'm here to tell you that's not true
[1:41:16] I believe that God is doing great things
[1:41:19] and I want to illustrate that just in a
[1:41:21] scripture here just as a footnote
[1:41:22] because remember now what God's looking
[1:41:23] for is obedience
[1:41:25] in the time of Esther you remember when
[1:41:27] she was taken back with the with the
[1:41:30] women uh the all the virgins in the land
[1:41:32] so that the king could choose a new
[1:41:34] Queen remember that story right and in
[1:41:38] her company
[1:41:39] looking after these women were just
[1:41:42] eunuchs
[1:41:44] and other women who were there were
[1:41:46] Servants of the king
[1:41:47] in other words there was no men healthy
[1:41:52] normal men allowed back there where
[1:41:54] these women were and they were back
[1:41:57] there for a period of a year
[1:42:00] they were there for a period of a year
[1:42:02] now in Esther 2 we read Esther had not
[1:42:05] showed her people nor her Kindred for
[1:42:08] Mordecai had charged her that she not
[1:42:09] showed that she was a Jew and Mordecai
[1:42:11] walked every day before the court of the
[1:42:13] women's house to know how yesterday
[1:42:15] every day he walked by maybe to get a
[1:42:18] glimpse of her because nobody had access
[1:42:19] to these women nobody could be around
[1:42:22] them at all and he walked by every day
[1:42:24] just to try to maybe see her and wave
[1:42:26] and uh you know hoping maybe he could
[1:42:28] get a glimpse of her and he did that he
[1:42:30] said to know how Esther did and what
[1:42:32] should become of her like what's
[1:42:34] happening there's nothing happening it
[1:42:35] seems like there's nothing happening
[1:42:36] here verse 12 and now when every maid's
[1:42:39] turn was come to go into the king of
[1:42:41] hazarus after that she had been how long
[1:42:44] 12 months
[1:42:48] I love the way scripture takes the
[1:42:51] mystery out of things watch she had been
[1:42:54] back there 12 months
[1:42:55] according to the manner of women
[1:43:00] you know what that means
[1:43:03] is that
[1:43:04] the king required
[1:43:07] that if he was going to have an
[1:43:09] offspring
[1:43:11] it had to be his seed
[1:43:15] and in order to prove that it was his
[1:43:17] seed he's going to isolate this woman
[1:43:20] for a period of 12 months
[1:43:23] to make sure she's not carrying another
[1:43:25] seed
[1:43:27] because within 12 months another man's
[1:43:30] seed is going to manifest itself
[1:43:34] so we're going to let these women stay
[1:43:36] for 12 months
[1:43:38] to make sure they don't have any other
[1:43:41] seed in them
[1:43:45] what is the Bible telling us
[1:43:48] you may think nothing's happening
[1:43:50] you may think well we've been all this
[1:43:52] time since brother Bam's gone and
[1:43:53] nothing's nothing's gone let me tell you
[1:43:55] what's happening God has separated the
[1:43:57] bride
[1:43:59] and if there's another seed in you it's
[1:44:02] going to come out
[1:44:04] it's going to show itself
[1:44:07] before this thing is over before we go
[1:44:10] and join him in the wedding supper if
[1:44:13] there's a Pentecostal seat if there's a
[1:44:15] uh you know a lustful seed if there's
[1:44:17] some other kind of seed that's in you in
[1:44:20] other words you've been dabbling in the
[1:44:22] world or you've been messing over here
[1:44:23] or something else you know what over
[1:44:24] time it's going to come out because
[1:44:26] that's what happens according to the
[1:44:28] manner of women do you understand what
[1:44:30] I'm saying
[1:44:31] if you want to find out whether a
[1:44:32] woman's received another seed let her
[1:44:34] sit for a year and see if anything
[1:44:35] happens and if nothing's happens now
[1:44:37] when she gets married to the king we
[1:44:39] know that the child that comes now has
[1:44:41] got to be the Kings because there's no
[1:44:43] other seed had manifested itself do you
[1:44:45] understand the point so you may sit
[1:44:47] there and think well nothing's happening
[1:44:48] I beg to differ I think A lot's
[1:44:50] happening and for you to be standing
[1:44:52] there after all of these years and just
[1:44:54] I believe the word I love the word I
[1:44:55] believe God sent a profit I believe
[1:44:56] we've got the perfect interpretation I
[1:44:58] believe I just tried to be obedient to
[1:45:00] the word of God and I've stayed right
[1:45:01] here and I've been here uh 20 years 30
[1:45:04] years 40 years 50 years I believe you
[1:45:06] know what that's God saying to the world
[1:45:07] you look at this virgin-born bride of
[1:45:09] Christ they have not received the seed
[1:45:11] of any other system or organization or
[1:45:13] doctrine or teaching or anything else
[1:45:16] they are reserved for me and me alone
[1:45:22] God is doing a great thing in the delay
[1:45:24] in the delay that's where this happens
[1:45:29] you know what God's after he's after
[1:45:31] obedience
[1:45:36] everybody everybody okay with the whole
[1:45:39] subject of obedience
[1:45:40] everybody feel like they're relatively
[1:45:42] obedient
[1:45:44] relatively I'm not saying perfectly I'm
[1:45:47] you know I know you're all being humble
[1:45:51] and you all know when to say amen and
[1:45:52] when not to I get that but
[1:45:57] let's just throw it out to a test
[1:46:00] okay
[1:46:02] there is a story in judges 19 which I'm
[1:46:05] not going to go into because it's one of
[1:46:06] the most heinous stories in all of the
[1:46:08] Bible where a man has a concubine and
[1:46:10] she's taken and and abused and uh
[1:46:14] mutilated and it's a terrible story you
[1:46:17] can you can refer to it when you get
[1:46:19] home and it happens in the Book of
[1:46:21] Judges it was done by people in the book
[1:46:23] in The Tribe of Benjamin right and the
[1:46:27] children of Israel were under orders
[1:46:29] according to God and according to the
[1:46:30] law on Moses that when such a sin
[1:46:33] occurred in the in the land among the
[1:46:35] people they were to get that out they
[1:46:36] were to purge that sin out blessed
[1:46:38] effect the rest of the nation of Israel
[1:46:40] and cut off the blessings of God and so
[1:46:42] they knew that this is what they had to
[1:46:44] do this was the will of God this was
[1:46:45] what God told him to do aren't you glad
[1:46:47] you're not in the Old Testament the
[1:46:48] living by the sword like that I mean
[1:46:51] that's how they dealt with things in the
[1:46:52] church you know they take them out back
[1:46:53] and kill him and then move on right I'm
[1:46:55] kind of glad we're not there
[1:46:58] you should be really glad we're not
[1:47:00] there
[1:47:03] so I want you to I'm going to pick up
[1:47:06] the story now from chapter 20 and all
[1:47:07] the children of Israel went out and the
[1:47:09] congregation was gathered together as
[1:47:10] one man even from Dan in the north to
[1:47:13] Beersheba in the South with the land in
[1:47:15] with the land of Gilead and the and the
[1:47:18] Lord unto the Lord in mizpah so they
[1:47:20] they agreed to gather in the city called
[1:47:22] mizpah and the chief of all the people
[1:47:24] even the tribes of Israel presenting
[1:47:26] themselves
[1:47:27] and the Assembly of God 400
[1:47:32] 000 footmen
[1:47:34] there were four hundred thousand
[1:47:36] soldiers who were gathered now on that
[1:47:38] day
[1:47:39] and the children of Benjamin heard that
[1:47:41] the children of Israel were gone up to
[1:47:42] mizpah
[1:47:44] and then said the children of Israel now
[1:47:47] tell us and they asked this man who his
[1:47:49] concubine was killed they said tell us
[1:47:52] what happened and he tells the story in
[1:47:54] detail here
[1:47:56] now you got a picture of this scene I
[1:47:57] need you to picture it there's four
[1:47:59] almost a half a million soldiers who
[1:48:03] were standing there with swords and
[1:48:04] shields and everything they need in
[1:48:06] order to go to war this is serious
[1:48:08] business
[1:48:10] Judges chapter 20 verse 15 says in the
[1:48:13] children of Benjamin were numbered at
[1:48:15] that time out of their cities 26
[1:48:19] 000 men that Drew the sword besides the
[1:48:21] inhabitants of gilbeah which were
[1:48:23] numbered 700 chosen men so we have 400
[1:48:27] 000 over here and we have 26 700 over
[1:48:30] here that's the way the battle shapes up
[1:48:33] I mean duh this is not this is not
[1:48:36] rocket science here
[1:48:38] four hundred thousand twenty six
[1:48:40] thousand seven hundred
[1:48:41] eleven tribes One Tribe
[1:48:44] these guys are right they're in the will
[1:48:46] of God they're doing what the law says
[1:48:48] and we're going to purge that out of the
[1:48:50] out of the camp lest it defile the the
[1:48:52] whole camp and these people over here
[1:48:55] are being stubborn they're they're being
[1:48:57] defensive about this whole thing because
[1:48:59] they realize wow this you know some of
[1:49:01] our people are going to be persecuted or
[1:49:03] judged for this
[1:49:06] so now again
[1:49:08] this is the way that things are stacked
[1:49:10] up here in this story
[1:49:14] you can
[1:49:16] take your Bible and look at this but
[1:49:18] I've got the key scriptures on the
[1:49:19] screen here which say that on the first
[1:49:23] day
[1:49:24] this is what they did the children of
[1:49:25] Israel arose in verse 18 and they went
[1:49:28] up to the house of God they began their
[1:49:30] battle in church and they asked counsel
[1:49:32] of God and they said which of us shall
[1:49:34] go up first to the battle against the
[1:49:36] children of Benjamin
[1:49:39] and the Lord said Judah shall go up
[1:49:41] first well that's right Judah means
[1:49:43] Worship in the Hebrew language
[1:49:45] so you know what the singers and the
[1:49:47] musicians they go first they prepare
[1:49:49] everybody and they set an atmosphere for
[1:49:51] the battle so this is right and God is
[1:49:53] not saying to them don't go I did not
[1:49:55] send thee he's not saying that he's
[1:49:57] saying here's how I want you to go this
[1:49:58] is the order of the battle
[1:50:01] and he's very specific he says now
[1:50:03] Benjamin uh sorry the the musicians go
[1:50:06] those singers go and then the soldiers
[1:50:09] will go after that this is how I want
[1:50:11] you to go you know
[1:50:15] and the Bible says
[1:50:17] at the end of that day
[1:50:20] the people
[1:50:22] the men of Israel
[1:50:24] encourage themselves
[1:50:26] and set their battle again in array in
[1:50:29] the place where they put themselves in a
[1:50:31] ray the first day
[1:50:34] and the children of Israel went up and
[1:50:36] wept before I'm sorry
[1:50:38] I've missed a screen here the children
[1:50:42] of Israel went up
[1:50:44] and as they
[1:50:45] as they approached these group of
[1:50:49] benjaminites twenty six thousand seven
[1:50:51] hundred four hundred thousand at the end
[1:50:54] of that day
[1:50:55] there were 22 000
[1:50:58] of the Israelites laying dead on the
[1:51:00] battlefield
[1:51:01] it doesn't say that any of the twenty
[1:51:04] six thousand seven hundred died but 22
[1:51:07] 000 died
[1:51:09] of the tribe of Israel over here the
[1:51:11] tribes of Israel the 11 tribes
[1:51:15] and they go home
[1:51:18] and they're looking at each other
[1:51:21] and they're all saying the same thing
[1:51:23] now God sent us
[1:51:26] God sent us
[1:51:29] tell me again what God's looking for in
[1:51:31] US obedience what God's looking for is
[1:51:34] obedience
[1:51:36] God sent us
[1:51:38] the next day
[1:51:40] the people of Israel
[1:51:42] encourage themselves and set their
[1:51:44] battle again in a ray in the place where
[1:51:46] they put themselves in a ray the first
[1:51:47] day they go back on the battlefield now
[1:51:50] the second day and the children of
[1:51:52] Israel went up and wept before the Lord
[1:51:54] until even they spent the whole day in
[1:51:57] prayer and weeping and asked counsel of
[1:52:00] the Lord saying shall I go up to battle
[1:52:02] against the children of Benjamin my
[1:52:04] brother and the Lord said go up against
[1:52:06] them
[1:52:08] are these people in the will of God I'm
[1:52:10] asking you are these people in the will
[1:52:12] of God yes they are
[1:52:15] God sent him the first day God sent him
[1:52:17] the second day it's not unclear God said
[1:52:20] go up against them
[1:52:22] and here they are going up against the
[1:52:24] children of Israel again and they're
[1:52:26] going across the same Battlefield they
[1:52:28] went the day before and they're saying
[1:52:30] ah this is where this is where uh elazar
[1:52:34] died and this is where Abram fell and
[1:52:37] this is where I picked up Joshua and
[1:52:40] picked him up and brought him back to
[1:52:41] the tent
[1:52:42] and they're going across the same
[1:52:44] Battlefield and looking and at the end
[1:52:46] of that day
[1:52:47] the Bible says that there were eighteen
[1:52:49] thousand more that died on the second
[1:52:52] day wait now did God send them yes he
[1:52:55] sent them were they in the will of God
[1:52:56] yes they were in the will of God did
[1:52:58] they have a righteous cause yes they did
[1:53:00] have a righteous cause
[1:53:03] what were they doing they were simply
[1:53:05] obeying God because that's what God told
[1:53:07] them to do but you know what they had to
[1:53:08] do now they had to plan 40 000 funerals
[1:53:13] because they had 20 22 000 and 18 000.
[1:53:17] now they have 40 000 funerals and forty
[1:53:19] thousand widows and a whole bunch of
[1:53:21] Orphans now
[1:53:23] that they had to contend with
[1:53:25] because God sent him in the battle and
[1:53:27] they were obedient
[1:53:29] and the Bible does not record anyone is
[1:53:32] lost over here on the side of twenty six
[1:53:34] thousand seven hundred
[1:53:36] you're getting quiet but I hope you're
[1:53:38] listening
[1:53:41] it's amazing it's really amazing that
[1:53:44] they went back the second day
[1:53:46] I mean it really is amazing that they
[1:53:48] went back at all the second day and
[1:53:50] asked God should we go again and then
[1:53:51] when God says they went
[1:53:55] when God told them to go they actually
[1:53:57] did go
[1:53:58] and they're not doing this insincerely
[1:54:00] folks understand me they're in the
[1:54:02] church all day praying and weeping and
[1:54:04] fasting and looking to God and saying
[1:54:07] should we go Lord direct us order our
[1:54:09] steps here now and and we will do your
[1:54:12] will if you tell us not to go we won't
[1:54:13] go if you tell us to go we will go
[1:54:15] whatever they're in the neutral place
[1:54:16] where they should be and they wait all
[1:54:18] day on God
[1:54:20] and God says go
[1:54:22] go up against them
[1:54:26] but that's not the incredible part
[1:54:28] the incredible part is the third day
[1:54:32] because on the third day
[1:54:34] to me this is one of the most Sam it's
[1:54:36] one of the most fascinating scriptures
[1:54:38] in the Old Testament then all the
[1:54:41] children of Israel and all the people
[1:54:43] went and came up into the house of God
[1:54:45] and wept and sat there before the Lord
[1:54:47] and fasted that day until even and
[1:54:50] offered burnt offerings and peace
[1:54:52] offerings before the Lord and the
[1:54:54] children of Israel inquired of the Lord
[1:54:57] for the Ark of the Covenant was there in
[1:54:59] those days and Phineas the son of
[1:55:02] Eliezer the son of Aaron stood before it
[1:55:04] in those days and said
[1:55:06] shall yet shall I yet again go to battle
[1:55:11] against the children of Benjamin my
[1:55:13] brother or shall we stop here
[1:55:17] think about it
[1:55:21] shall we go the first day yes sir 22 000
[1:55:23] die shall we go to second day yes sir
[1:55:25] eighteen thousand die 18 000 die on the
[1:55:28] field
[1:55:29] and he asks again the third day they're
[1:55:31] going back in there the third day
[1:55:34] I say God give us the spirit of those
[1:55:36] men on the third day
[1:55:39] Lord give us that kind of spirit give us
[1:55:42] that kind of of determination to to do
[1:55:45] the will of God even when it doesn't
[1:55:48] make sense even when it's not logical
[1:55:50] even when it does not I mean who in
[1:55:53] their right mind is going to go back and
[1:55:55] ask God again should we go when we have
[1:55:58] 40 000 funerals to attend next week who
[1:56:01] who in their right mind would go back to
[1:56:03] God but they did because they were the
[1:56:05] people of God and I say something about
[1:56:07] the bride of Christ even when it doesn't
[1:56:09] make sense I say God give us that kind
[1:56:11] of faith that we can and that kind of
[1:56:13] trust that we can trust in God even when
[1:56:16] it doesn't make sense Lord should we go
[1:56:19] again shall we press on shall we go
[1:56:21] forward I will guarantee you that I
[1:56:24] don't believe every step from here to
[1:56:26] the Rapture will make sense but I
[1:56:28] believe it will be because we trust him
[1:56:32] I believe it'll be because we trust him
[1:56:35] and they stood there in the church after
[1:56:37] all day and and by the way they're all
[1:56:40] there I mean the Bible is very clear it
[1:56:43] uses very clear words that all the
[1:56:46] people went up and came to the house of
[1:56:47] God all the children of Israel went up
[1:56:49] there look at the first line all of them
[1:56:51] came there was not a group of them over
[1:56:53] here saying well I don't I don't mean I
[1:56:54] don't believe that Joshua was meant to
[1:56:56] lead us in the first place and I don't
[1:56:57] believe that Moses should have said this
[1:56:59] and I don't think that that's right and
[1:57:01] you know what I never got to play the
[1:57:02] piano and I don't get to sing specials
[1:57:04] and I don't do this and they got murmurs
[1:57:06] there was there was no evidence there
[1:57:07] was no talk of murmurs here they're all
[1:57:09] in church they're all doing the same
[1:57:11] thing they're seeking God in one
[1:57:14] harmonious unit here and they're all
[1:57:16] looking to God to hear what he's going
[1:57:17] to say because what matters is what God
[1:57:19] says not what anybody else says what
[1:57:22] matters is what God says
[1:57:24] and they have enough trust down deep
[1:57:27] that they're going to wait on him to
[1:57:29] hear what he has to say now
[1:57:31] today is a new day today we're going to
[1:57:33] go back to church today we're going to
[1:57:35] ask them again we're going to do because
[1:57:36] you know what we're in the will of God
[1:57:38] we know what's right we're standing for
[1:57:40] a righteous cause we have the word be
[1:57:42] beside us here we don't have God
[1:57:43] discouraging us we have God telling us
[1:57:46] to go and you know what if nothing else
[1:57:48] if nothing else we trust him
[1:57:53] I I never knew it would be like this
[1:57:57] but I trust God
[1:58:03] we never knew we'd have a pandemic
[1:58:06] you know what we all had to do
[1:58:08] besides pastors they had to become
[1:58:10] Ministers of Health
[1:58:11] but we had to trust God for that didn't
[1:58:14] we we never
[1:58:16] tell me what made sense in the days of
[1:58:18] the pandemic
[1:58:19] tell me what was sensible
[1:58:21] no one was making sense
[1:58:24] but you know what to me the bride of
[1:58:27] Christ we're not depending on the
[1:58:29] department of health or a government or
[1:58:31] something and no disrespect I'm not
[1:58:33] being disrespectful here you know I
[1:58:34] thank God for good doctors and all the
[1:58:36] rest of it and now you know all of that
[1:58:38] but you know what during the pandemic I
[1:58:40] believe probably for the bride of Christ
[1:58:42] our trust increased in God and Lord you
[1:58:45] know what the only way we're probably
[1:58:46] really going to get through all of this
[1:58:47] because we don't know what tomorrow
[1:58:48] holds but we trust you
[1:58:51] now when we look back at it that's
[1:58:53] really been our success isn't it that no
[1:58:55] matter what happened no matter what goes
[1:58:56] wrong in our lives no matter what
[1:58:58] happens in in life no matter what life
[1:59:00] brings you and no matter what happens in
[1:59:02] our countries and in other countries of
[1:59:04] the world there's a brine sitting there
[1:59:06] that says this doesn't make sense and it
[1:59:08] sure ain't pretty I mean we got 40 000
[1:59:10] coffins stacked up over here but Lord I
[1:59:13] trust you
[1:59:14] that's a testimony of the Bride that's
[1:59:17] the testimony that's who we are we are a
[1:59:20] people who trust God
[1:59:22] that glorious Church trusts God
[1:59:27] and Phineas stands there and he simply
[1:59:29] says
[1:59:31] shall we go again
[1:59:33] Lord if you say no
[1:59:36] we'll stop here and we'll mourn those
[1:59:38] that are gone but if you say go Lord
[1:59:40] we're going to go and he's standing in
[1:59:43] the center of the church and they fasted
[1:59:44] and prayed and wept all day and you know
[1:59:46] what God says the Lord says go up for
[1:59:49] tomorrow I'll deliver them into your
[1:59:51] hand
[1:59:52] tomorrow the victory is yours tomorrow
[1:59:55] is going to be a different day at the
[1:59:57] end of the day tomorrow is going to be a
[1:59:58] different day but you know what they
[2:00:00] didn't know it would take three days
[2:00:01] they didn't know and it was going to
[2:00:03] take that long they didn't know that
[2:00:04] that's the way that it was going to come
[2:00:06] out they didn't know that 40 000 of
[2:00:08] their comrades would die in the will of
[2:00:09] God they didn't realize all of that was
[2:00:12] going to happen but you know what
[2:00:13] brother Branham tells us this very
[2:00:15] carefully and if you don't take anything
[2:00:17] away from this weekend take this away
[2:00:20] obedience is what God wants
[2:00:23] obedience is better than sacrifice and
[2:00:25] to obey the Lord is better than any
[2:00:27] sacrifice you could do
[2:00:30] you may feel like you want to travel the
[2:00:32] world and be a missionary you want to
[2:00:33] give out books or you want to give money
[2:00:34] or you want to do something else or
[2:00:36] start your own church or whatever else
[2:00:38] listen there's nothing nothing as
[2:00:40] important to God as your heart in
[2:00:42] obedience and in sync with God and
[2:00:44] trusting him for the next day whatever
[2:00:46] you do wherever life takes you and
[2:00:48] whatever the spirit of God indicates
[2:00:50] that you're to do you do it obeying God
[2:00:52] do it trusting God and I'll tell you
[2:00:54] that's how it's going to come out right
[2:00:56] that's what God's looking for in this
[2:00:57] glorious Church he's looking for a
[2:00:59] spirit of obedience and a humble heart
[2:01:01] that he can use he can mold he can
[2:01:04] change
[2:01:07] and that's what God's looking for
[2:01:11] we're not commissioned to figure it all
[2:01:13] out we're not we're not commissioned to
[2:01:16] make all the Mysteries more plain than
[2:01:19] what they are or you know whatever else
[2:01:20] we're not we're not commissioned to come
[2:01:22] up with a new message we're not we're
[2:01:23] not commissioned to make another profit
[2:01:25] rise up here or something else you know
[2:01:27] what we're commissioning to do is to
[2:01:28] believe what God has said is going to
[2:01:30] come to pass we're trusting in that
[2:01:32] we're trusting in that every day that we
[2:01:34] go forward even when it doesn't make
[2:01:36] sense even when God brings us to the
[2:01:38] edge of impossible and says take another
[2:01:40] step go ahead just take another step and
[2:01:42] watch what I do trust me and let me lead
[2:01:44] you here brother Graham said at Abraham
[2:01:47] believed it and that's a believer
[2:01:49] Abraham said Abraham believed it that's
[2:01:53] a believer
[2:01:55] let me say it again Abraham believed it
[2:01:58] that's a believer
[2:02:00] you know what believers do they believe
[2:02:05] that's the best thing they do
[2:02:07] we may not do a whole lot of other
[2:02:09] things well but Abraham believed it
[2:02:11] that's a believer
[2:02:13] May the same faith that Abraham had made
[2:02:15] rest upon us tonight and how are you
[2:02:17] going to do it Lord he never asked the
[2:02:20] question
[2:02:23] Abraham didn't sit there with Sarah and
[2:02:25] say now look how are you feeling and
[2:02:27] let's kind of Google this let's figure
[2:02:29] it out how's God going to do it well
[2:02:30] it's going to be a full moon or whatever
[2:02:32] hey he didn't do that they didn't ask
[2:02:34] they never asked the question how's God
[2:02:36] going to do it they only the thing that
[2:02:37] registered was God said it's going to
[2:02:40] come to pass we are going to heaven
[2:02:42] Isaac and he's going to stand here one
[2:02:43] day and I will tell you what Abraham
[2:02:46] said that's going to happen he didn't
[2:02:48] ask the question he didn't sit there and
[2:02:51] argue with God he just believed it
[2:02:53] because that's what believers do God
[2:02:55] said he would do it and not settle it
[2:02:57] for Abraham are you ready this is coming
[2:03:00] into that third pool
[2:03:04] I don't see anywhere where and I don't
[2:03:06] know I'm not saying that God won't do
[2:03:08] this but I I kind of have a feeling that
[2:03:10] uh we're not going to be people who are
[2:03:12] speaking squirrels into existence and
[2:03:14] speaking things out of existence
[2:03:16] because if we had the power to speak
[2:03:17] people out of existence the church would
[2:03:19] probably be half full and that's not
[2:03:20] what God's after at all that's not what
[2:03:23] he's interested in
[2:03:24] you know what we just believe that it's
[2:03:27] possible
[2:03:28] With God all things are possible Right
[2:03:31] we're coming now to that Perfection
[2:03:34] because the people has to come to this
[2:03:36] in order for the Rapture and and and and
[2:03:37] that's what that's exactly what uh I
[2:03:41] believe is is the if you like that's
[2:03:43] what's happening in the season that
[2:03:45] we're in here now the bride is being
[2:03:47] matured and brought to a place where hey
[2:03:50] God said it we're not asking the
[2:03:52] questions about how God's going to do it
[2:03:54] we're not debating about whether it's
[2:03:56] going to happen this way or that way you
[2:03:58] know what if God said it it's going to
[2:04:00] come to pass because that's what
[2:04:01] believers do
[2:04:03] that's what believers do
[2:04:06] friends obedience
[2:04:09] is what God wants
[2:04:13] obedience is what he's after to obey the
[2:04:15] Lord is better than any sacrifice you
[2:04:19] could do
[2:04:21] foreign
[2:04:33] sorry to have kept you so long I
[2:04:35] I just
[2:04:38] I think about that glorious church this
[2:04:40] glorious church is not going to be the
[2:04:41] most beautiful or the biggest or
[2:04:44] fancy is kind of not in our binocular
[2:04:49] wealthy popular
[2:04:51] no
[2:04:53] but if we're characterized by only one
[2:04:55] thing Let It Be obedience
[2:04:58] where people who trust God we obey God
[2:05:02] we believe that whatever God says that's
[2:05:05] what's going to happen
[2:05:09] we're not going back on that that's
[2:05:11] that's what believers do and we're
[2:05:13] believers do you know that little course
[2:05:15] Falling In Love With Jesus the best
[2:05:17] thing I've ever done falling in love
[2:05:19] with him and just just walking with him

[2:05:23] the King well I mean what a what a
[2:05:25] beautiful place God has brought us to
[2:05:28] like Esther he brought her to a place
[2:05:29] where hey we know the purity of this
[2:05:32] woman we know we know the sanctity of
[2:05:35] this woman here
[2:05:36] we know that if she brings forth a son
[2:05:39] that's going to be a son of the king
[2:05:41] God has brought us to this place where
[2:05:43] hey we're not interested in all kinds of
[2:05:45] other stuff out there we're interested
[2:05:46] in in the word of the king we're
[2:05:48] interested in his Fellowship we're
[2:05:50] interested in his embrace

[2:09:58] heavenly father as we bow our hearts
[2:10:00] before you today Lord
[2:10:02] I just prayed it in every heart to be a
[2:10:04] measure of sincerity Lord just a greater
[2:10:07] dedication to your purpose in this very
[2:10:10] last day Lord I believe you're going to
[2:10:12] have a people that are in line a people
[2:10:15] that are in harmony with you Lord not
[2:10:17] asking a bunch of different questions
[2:10:19] that really don't matter but Lord there
[2:10:21] are people who are willing to obey even
[2:10:23] when it doesn't make sense
[2:10:25] facing the impossible is not a challenge
[2:10:27] for us Lord because with you all things
[2:10:30] are possible and there are no
[2:10:32] Impossibles with God there are no
[2:10:34] incurables with God there's no
[2:10:36] situations Lord that are too great for
[2:10:38] thee and Lord there's no battle we face
[2:10:40] that you have not led us to and so in
[2:10:42] the name of Jesus Christ I commit the
[2:10:44] people now into your hands
[2:10:47] and I ask and pray Lord that you would
[2:10:48] just give us that willingness to obey
[2:10:51] the willingness Lord to walk in harmony
[2:10:53] with you Lord even in the face of danger
[2:10:56] even in the face of disappointments Lord
[2:10:58] in the in the times Lord when we don't
[2:11:01] really fully understand
[2:11:03] Lord I pray you give us a spirit of
[2:11:05] those men on the third day that went
[2:11:07] back to the temple again of themselves
[2:11:09] with a willingness Lord to do whatever
[2:11:11] you told them to do
[2:11:14] father give us that kind of a spirit
[2:11:16] that kind of a willingness to face the
[2:11:18] future it's easy for us to say in our
[2:11:20] church here that we obey and and we
[2:11:23] agree and everything else Lord but when
[2:11:25] it comes down to the real matters of
[2:11:27] life when it comes down to the real
[2:11:29] situations we Face Lord and some of them
[2:11:31] can be very tight and very difficult
[2:11:33] father we want to obey you with all of
[2:11:36] our heart
[2:11:37] even in the not so easy times
[2:11:41] I pray Lord you would take a simple
[2:11:43] thought Lord and may it just drop in the
[2:11:45] hearts of the people that that you truly
[2:11:48] are a God we can trust and faith rests
[2:11:50] on the shoulders of a quiet trust in you
[2:11:53] we depend upon you Lord and ask son that
[2:11:56] you would bless the balance of our time
[2:11:59] here and Lord what is said and done
[2:12:01] today may you anointed Lord and may you
[2:12:03] just minister to our hearts we pray
[2:12:07] we love you and thank you in Jesus name

[2:18:22] [Music]
[2:18:33] hey Glory
[2:18:34] for the favor
[2:18:38] [Music]
[2:18:51] let's jump right to that last verse then
[2:18:54] in Fellowship
[2:18:55] [Music]
[2:19:00] s
[2:19:15] what he says
[2:19:20] where is
[2:19:22] where he's
[2:19:23] [Music]
[2:19:34] always
[2:19:37] [Music]
[2:19:59] amen can you say Amen to the word of the
[2:20:01] Lord
[2:20:03] amen
[2:20:04] what a comfort for the Holy Spirit would
[2:20:06] minister to our lives
[2:20:09] I think that's one thing that God not
[2:20:11] only said it but God manifested that
[2:20:14] even in this hour
[2:20:16] of even in his choosing it has brother
[2:20:19] Berry even started with that God doesn't
[2:20:21] need great things to to do great things
[2:20:25] all God needs is yielded vessels
[2:20:30] that's all he needs yielded vessels and
[2:20:34] vessels that's yielded to his voice
[2:20:37] I think how God made that so clear even
[2:20:39] when it doesn't make sense
[2:20:41] but we trust him
[2:20:43] it's learning to trust him to trust his
[2:20:46] voice not our feelings
[2:20:48] because our feelings will lie to us I
[2:20:51] feel this way I feel that way I feel
[2:20:54] this way this is an age of feelings
[2:20:58] right everybody's got their feeling and
[2:21:00] that's automatically with a feeling what
[2:21:02] that must be the leading of the Lord
[2:21:03] because I feel this way no there might
[2:21:05] be a change in temperature
[2:21:07] might be indigestion
[2:21:09] see every
[2:21:13] must come back to the word of God
[2:21:16] and sometimes it's not that there is a
[2:21:19] scripture that says not to do this or to
[2:21:22] do that sometimes where you have to go
[2:21:24] back to is the very character of Christ
[2:21:28] himself
[2:21:29] and judge it by there looking at our
[2:21:32] motives looking at our objectives and
[2:21:34] you know we look at many things you know
[2:21:37] all of us would alter out this building
[2:21:39] every life there's things that no doubt
[2:21:41] you're praying for asking God for you're
[2:21:44] wanting to see Lord I want to see more
[2:21:46] of you in my life the greatest
[2:21:48] compliment and the greatest thing we can
[2:21:50] do is to obey what he has said do
[2:21:55] there would have never been any fire
[2:21:57] come down on Mount Carmel Elijah was
[2:22:00] God's Prophet but it wasn't going to
[2:22:01] come because he was God's prophet
[2:22:03] that's not why God came
[2:22:06] God came because he had spoke to Elijah
[2:22:09] and when Elijah's everything when it
[2:22:13] came down to it what invited the fire
[2:22:15] was Elijah was able to tell God I have
[2:22:18] done all of this
[2:22:21] according to Thy Word
[2:22:22] Elijah was able to say I was I've obeyed
[2:22:26] by your grace that has let me know how
[2:22:29] to walk and prepare myself so that the
[2:22:33] fire can come
[2:22:34] amen
[2:22:36] see God only comes where he's invited
[2:22:40] and you think one of the greatest
[2:22:42] invitations the greatest thing is
[2:22:45] obedience simple obedience isn't that
[2:22:48] wonderful
[2:22:49] and it's something that goes to see just
[2:22:51] like in a service like here today it
[2:22:53] goes beyond just just right right here
[2:22:55] we see that in each service each moment
[2:22:58] it's that word coming in and it's a
[2:23:00] valuation going on in our life
[2:23:03] is that your desire I I if if I leave
[2:23:06] the word here and that's where it ends
[2:23:08] right here and I walk out of here and I
[2:23:09] say man that was a good service and I
[2:23:11] walk out of here and that's it then I
[2:23:13] have failed to do my part
[2:23:16] because God just didn't want me to come
[2:23:18] here this morning and amend the word of
[2:23:20] God but he wants to be the Amen in me
[2:23:24] and that this word because there's a lot
[2:23:26] of things you know we can we can look at
[2:23:29] ourselves and everything seems pretty
[2:23:31] good
[2:23:32] but if we let the word continue to
[2:23:33] examine Our Lives
[2:23:36] are you with me we let the word continue
[2:23:38] to examine Our Lives say God I just want
[2:23:42] to be more pleasing to you
[2:23:44] if there's anything that's out of line
[2:23:46] let this word just continue to comb
[2:23:48] through my life and God it's that's
[2:23:50] God's molding it's God leading us it's
[2:23:52] God moving and that's his desire
[2:23:55] operating and US responding back to it I
[2:23:57] tell you that is very very precious you
[2:24:00] know what's precious is to have a heart
[2:24:01] that looks back to God and says yea Lord
[2:24:04] because we're living in an age that
[2:24:06] tells God has rejected him I don't need
[2:24:09] you I don't need anything else to do
[2:24:10] with you
[2:24:12] all I need is church
[2:24:14] but the people of God says Lord I need
[2:24:16] you
[2:24:17] I need you Lord without you everything
[2:24:20] else is meaningless
[2:24:22] amen don't you love him this morning
[2:24:25] amen what a what a what a word from the
[2:24:28] Lord and how we just think amen thank
[2:24:30] God for his for the word that has been
[2:24:32] delivered Amen to our hearts this
[2:24:34] morning and I just want to remember the
[2:24:36] service this evening here at five
[2:24:38] o'clock for the youth meeting and invite
[2:24:40] each and every one of you back and
[2:24:42] um I know there'll be others that are
[2:24:44] coming in as well so you know what a
[2:24:46] wonderful day this is a day that um I
[2:24:49] just look at it my wife and I were
[2:24:51] talking about the other day and I said
[2:24:52] you know what it is it's just another
[2:24:54] opportunity to be in the presence of the
[2:24:55] Lord
[2:24:56] man I think that's that's pretty awesome
[2:24:59] another opportunity to be in God's
[2:25:01] presence and I just I so enjoy that the
[2:25:04] presence of the Lord amen so let's just
[2:25:06] bow our hearts in a word of prayer amen
[2:25:09] as we're being dismissed heavenly father
[2:25:11] as we just want to say thank you Lord
[2:25:13] this morning
[2:25:15] oh God your word is so Lord precious
[2:25:18] Lord as David could describe it it is a
[2:25:21] lamp unto my feet and Lord we desire God
[2:25:26] to make footsteps Lord where the light
[2:25:29] has shown
[2:25:30] father you Delight only shows upon the
[2:25:33] steps that we must take presently and
[2:25:36] that we will take those steps presently
[2:25:39] then Lord that same light as it leads us
[2:25:41] step by step by step of the way until we
[2:25:45] stand on the other side
[2:25:47] oh God we want to be
[2:25:50] like as it was described when we think
[2:25:52] of Joshua and Caleb
[2:25:54] Joshua type of the end time leader a
[2:25:57] type of the Holy Spirit and Caleb a type
[2:26:00] of the believer that's staying true to
[2:26:02] the word and we look Lord at what Caleb
[2:26:04] means his name means a dog
[2:26:09] and I think of it oh god of how Lord
[2:26:12] within that the simpleness it wasn't
[2:26:15] just speaking of a gentile but I believe
[2:26:18] it was speaking of the simpleness of
[2:26:20] obedience
[2:26:22] oh God
[2:26:24] help us Lord that in everything Lord
[2:26:26] that God in the even Lord for it's been
[2:26:30] the smallest things that you take
[2:26:33] Delight in Lord
[2:26:34] in the details and we ask oh God that
[2:26:38] Lord just as Esther was being prepared
[2:26:40] in that moment Lord
[2:26:42] oh God May Our Lives Lord in that
[2:26:45] preparation in that moment Lord where
[2:26:47] father all as we read in other writings
[2:26:50] of where Lord all of the stench of where
[2:26:53] they maybe would have come from
[2:26:55] throughout the land was Lord he was
[2:26:57] being also worked out of their pores and
[2:27:00] then oh God that time of purification
[2:27:02] then when Lord all of the myrrh and
[2:27:04] everything was added that God he would
[2:27:06] everything would be just right Lord for
[2:27:09] that moment but how beautiful Lord this
[2:27:11] morning this Lord even that other part
[2:27:14] that you placed in there thank you
[2:27:16] Father for your mercy Lord may we be
[2:27:19] Lord if we the other examples Lord how
[2:27:22] we've ministered on them Lord we've
[2:27:23] heard him spoke on but that today Lord
[2:27:26] in judges 20. Lord I just raised my
[2:27:29] hands Lord God and throughout this
[2:27:30] congregation that's the kind of Lord
[2:27:32] believer I want to be Lord we preached
[2:27:35] on Genesis 22 Lord that that was a
[2:27:37] reoccurring theme Lord in the prophet's
[2:27:40] message many times but Lord that in
[2:27:42] judges 20 as we see that that even when
[2:27:44] it doesn't make sense Israel continued
[2:27:47] to go they were perfectly in the will of
[2:27:49] God 22
[2:27:51] 000 and 18 000 fell but they trusted you
[2:27:54] Lord
[2:27:55] trusted you enough Lord to say
[2:27:59] should we go up again Lord
[2:28:01] oh God that is how we want to be Lord
[2:28:05] is when things don't make sense when
[2:28:08] it's contrary to our feelings or our
[2:28:10] thinking but lord it's under your
[2:28:14] leading and with the word that's our
[2:28:17] desire Lord that's our desire
[2:28:20] help us Lord I believe it's that simple
[2:28:23] as a an example that Lord you spoke here
[2:28:25] that maybe doesn't stand out would not
[2:28:27] have stood out to be ministered on a lot
[2:28:29] within that thought but you pointed it
[2:28:32] out today and letting us see it's these
[2:28:35] things right here that matter the most
[2:28:38] help us Lord I pray
[2:28:40] in the name of Jesus Christ be with your
[2:28:43] people Lord watch over us and bless the
[2:28:46] upcoming service this evening

[2:28:53] amen don't you enjoy that
[2:28:55] I tell you I really really that in
[2:28:58] judges 20 I really really enjoyed that
[2:29:00] it's what I say God that's the kind of
[2:29:01] believer I want to be that's the kind of
[2:29:03] person I want to be
[2:29:05] God bless you amen Shake hand to one
[2:29:07] another five o'clock Amen to see me
