[25:18] [Music]
[25:34] good morning God bless
[25:36] you maybe we could hit the lights we hit
[25:39] the back
[25:51] lights just to follow up with last week
[25:54] uh as we're praying about the concrete
[25:56] project um
[25:59] just going to go over the uh just a
[26:01] brief financial report of January to to
[26:04] current with
[26:06] you um I just wanted to break it down
[26:09] into a very basic necessities so this
[26:13] first um these first numbers that you'll
[26:16] see are what the electric is the gas the
[26:19] insurance the internet water and our
[26:21] sewer which is uh a septic holding
[26:25] system so here's the the total
[26:29] numbers the bottom of each column is
[26:33] what each month is so January is
[26:36] 1,49 February
[26:39] 1,121 and again these are just the very
[26:42] Basic Essentials this is if no
[26:44] emergencies happen this is um I don't
[26:48] even uh include Pest Control the
[26:50] building security what it takes to put
[26:52] songs up this is a so average for the
[26:57] first half of the year years
[27:01] 1,127 this next slide is what's going to
[27:04] be supplementary so it's going to
[27:06] include dep Pest Control it's going to
[27:07] include building security each month the
[27:09] song license General expenses like
[27:12] office cleaning supplies the envelopes
[27:15] when you pay your ties and offerings gas
[27:17] for when they mow if mower breaks down
[27:20] the spring bottle of water and anything
[27:22] other miscellaneous I group that all
[27:24] together the gravel that we poured back
[27:28] back in January on both the entrance
[27:30] ramps the bw2 website the display
[27:34] computer back there that broke down so a
[27:37] new computer that was in February the AC
[27:41] that went out a couple Sundays ago that
[27:43] felt like Costa Rica in
[27:45] here uh couldn't ignore that and then
[27:49] some floor vents and gas water so this
[27:52] is this is supplementary so this is not
[27:55] including the first average that I
[27:57] showed you January 938 February was just
[28:01] an expensive month because of that
[28:03] computer uh
[28:05] march8 146 and so on um so you can see
[28:09] roughly in addition to that
[28:12] 1ish uh for just your basic is another
[28:15] 1,000 for just things that happen you
[28:18] know just like our house sometimes
[28:20] things just need a dress
[28:23] um so just including that again these
[28:26] are both average numbers so about what
[28:28] this
[28:29] church things happen things come up
[28:32] about
[28:34] $2,169 a month is what I came it came
[28:37] out to
[28:38] be
[28:41] so the expenses versus the offerings um
[28:45] as you can see in January the expenses
[28:47] were 2,000 a little over $2,000 the
[28:50] offering was three 49 we're in the
[28:53] positive February we're in the negative
[28:55] due to that
[28:56] computer um um was that an apple Brother
[28:59] s that was probably why it's so
[29:03] expensive I didn't I didn't approve that
[29:07] purchase
[29:08] [Music]
[29:09] so as you can see we're in deposit all

[41:13] 2 I thank Brother Sam for the invitation
[41:16] to come out and uh and Minister here uh
[41:19] today it's been a joy to get to know him
[41:21] over the past uh few years at different
[41:24] youth camps it's been real uh real
[41:26] special and uh my wife and kids wanted
[41:28] to be able to make it as well but yeah
[41:32] we ended the the school year with a bit
[41:34] of a I'll be a little dramatic a bit of
[41:36] a death in the family a dog of 10 years
[41:39] passed away and I really tried to put
[41:42] off the purchase of another dog because
[41:45] these animals they just bind you down
[41:49] and you just uh all of a sudden you're
[41:51] ordering your life's priorities based
[41:52] upon the four
[41:54] legs and um yeah I uh it happened faster
[41:58] than I could uh could keep things uh
[42:00] rained in and we have a uh a puppy named
[42:03] Jack and um Jack's priority Jack's
[42:07] priority was high today so we uh they
[42:10] went to church with my my parents
[42:12] they'll be able to be home a little
[42:13] faster and that's just how it is I'm
[42:16] learning learning where I stand on the
[42:18] totem pole again sometimes but um anyhow
[42:22] are we good here all right
[42:25] let's I don't see how I'm getting Acts
[42:27] chapter 2 um verse 37 and I don't know
[42:32] if a techie can come here and help me
[42:34] get this in presenter mode I can't see
[42:36] it on my screen real well Acts chapter 2
[42:39] and verse
[42:42] 37 now when they heard this they were
[42:45] pricked in their heart and said unto
[42:48] Peter and to the rest of the Apostles
[42:49] men and Brethren what shall we do then
[42:53] Peter said unto them repent and be
[42:56] baptized every one of you in the name of
[42:58] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[43:00] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[43:02] Holy Ghost for the promise unto you and
[43:04] to your children and to all that are far
[43:06] off as many as the Lord Our God shall
[43:09] call all right let's let's just pray
[43:12] Heavenly Father we thank you for this
[43:14] time that we have together Lord here in
[43:16] our Sunday morning this is not the end
[43:18] of the weekend this is the start of a
[43:20] week Lord and father as we have all
[43:22] kinds of things coming up in the week
[43:24] Lord and who knows what uh what what new
[43:27] news we might have received at work or
[43:30] from loved ones during this past week
[43:32] what we what burdens we might be
[43:33] carrying to church today Lord I pray oh
[43:36] father that you would help us just to
[43:37] bring them to you so we can rest father
[43:41] we ask your blessing today in Jesus name
[43:45] amen amen you may be
[43:50] seated perhaps some of you went to the
[43:52] to the Youth Camp uh this week I I don't
[43:55] know but uh think we've got
[43:57] yeah some of us very very good it's
[43:59] always a wonderful thing to come back
[44:01] and be be encouraged with what the Lord
[44:03] has done for us and I know uh the end of
[44:06] a camp was always a tough a tough
[44:09] experience it still is because the post
[44:11] Camp Blues are are a real thing but if
[44:15] you think about it if you've been
[44:15] staying up till midnight or 1:00 five or
[44:18] six days in a row your body is going to
[44:20] say stop after a while and sometimes
[44:23] those those physical messages our bodies
[44:26] start sending to
[44:28] um we can start overs spiritualizing
[44:30] them sometimes and just saying man
[44:32] what's wrong with me no you're just
[44:33] tired just rest and that's all that's
[44:36] all right but uh we want to take a
[44:38] little bit of time today and talk about
[44:41] uh the the theme that the Christian Life
[44:44] the Christian faith is based
[44:47] entirely upon rest and that's just uh
[44:51] that's something that was just I seem
[44:53] like that's a continual um struggle in
[44:56] in in our in our life lives being able
[44:58] to to come to a place where we can rest
[45:01] in the Lord and I could remember years
[45:04] back when I was uh younger it was in a
[45:07] Ser with brother Lonnie and did I hear
[45:10] Brother Crest this morning open in
[45:12] prayer I thought I recognized brother
[45:14] Crest your voice you might remember uh
[45:16] this this slide but uh it was a it was a
[45:20] slide to this of this man making his way
[45:23] across this this fiery River and the
[45:26] first slide he was just kind of holding
[45:28] on barely making he's just you can see
[45:31] the the sweat just dripping off of his
[45:33] off of his off his forehead and know
[45:36] sweaty Palms are not a good thing to
[45:38] have when you're holding on to a chain
[45:40] above a field of lava and that is
[45:43] unfortunately the way many of us um
[45:47] experience the Christian Life we're just
[45:50] trying to hold on for dear life and
[45:53] we're just hoping our strength doesn't
[45:55] give out um that however is not what God
[46:01] has intended and then and then the next
[46:03] picture that came across was the same
[46:05] big uh big huge chain links but in this
[46:08] one the guy was sitting right on the
[46:10] chain link straddling it and he was just
[46:12] being carried over not upon his own
[46:15] strength but upon the strength of the
[46:18] chain and that is what God has for us
[46:22] and I can rest now once again very good
[46:27] very good thank you my dear brother he
[46:30] earns that you should double his
[46:33] salary yeah so we uh we just looked at
[46:37] their text um about the the Holy Ghost
[46:40] is is a gift of God unfortunately like
[46:43] we said this is the spiritual experience
[46:45] many of us unfortunately have God does
[46:48] not intend our spiritual walk to be a
[46:50] cliffhanger experience we'll talk about
[46:53] that today but that's how we often feel
[46:55] we just want to try to we do our best to
[46:57] be good enough to to to show God that
[47:00] we've we've prayed long enough we've
[47:02] fasted long enough we've done ever what
[47:04] whatever long enough so that we can
[47:05] finally be deserving of the baptism of
[47:08] the Holy Spirit that's that's
[47:10] unfortunate the mentality we've gotten
[47:13] God doesn't want us to have a
[47:14] cliffhanger experience he wants us to be
[47:16] able to enjoy the journey and this
[47:19] person here swinging above this great
[47:21] height can rest in the strength of the
[47:25] rigging all right he's resting in the
[47:28] ropes he's resting everything that that
[47:29] is set up and that is a picture of what
[47:31] God intends our walk with him to be not
[47:35] hanging on for dear life I hope I can
[47:37] hang on I hope I have a good day when
[47:39] the Rapture comes that's not the
[47:42] experience that God has intended for us
[47:44] we can rest in what he's done for us now
[47:48] like Brother Sam said I uh um I've got a
[47:51] bit of a a teaching background I'm a
[47:53] principal and teacher at a small
[47:54] Christian School in lmma I'm going to
[47:56] kind of do what I do in class I'm going
[47:58] to present our lesson in a nutshell and
[48:00] first off we want to get here the new
[48:04] birth is
[48:06] simple we try to complicate things the
[48:09] devil tries to complicate things but
[48:11] whenever we read of the Holy Ghost
[48:13] baptism in the book of Acts it is
[48:17] simple people believed God and God
[48:20] filled them with his
[48:22] Spirit period right we like to add all
[48:25] kinds of things to it but God
[48:28] didn't confusion is one of Satan's Chief
[48:33] tools he loves to soak confusion
[48:36] especially about this vital part of our
[48:39] relationship with
[48:41] God next every Christian's individual
[48:45] experience will
[48:48] vary God is not a cookie cutter kind of
[48:51] God who every single Christmas cookie
[48:53] looks the same you know he is a god of
[48:56] variety your experience will be
[48:57] different than my experience will be
[48:59] different from his or her experience God
[49:01] intended it that
[49:04] way furthermore we are going to get in
[49:08] God's way when we try to imitate
[49:11] somebody else's experience we do this so
[49:15] easily and with the best of intentions
[49:17] we're not trying to do something wrong
[49:19] we're we're thinking we're doing
[49:20] something good but we just want need to
[49:23] relax let God be God let him meet us on
[49:27] his own terms and the biggie the new
[49:30] birth doesn't depend on
[49:33] us we didn't even start to seek God
[49:37] first we can only seek him because he
[49:39] sought us first it doesn't depend upon
[49:44] us now um Peter talks about the gift of
[49:48] the Holy Spirit it it is a gift and I
[49:51] like what Jesus says in the Book of Luke
[49:53] he says if you then human beings if
[49:55] being evil
[49:57] you know how to give good gifts unto
[49:59] your
[49:59] children how much more shall your
[50:02] heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to
[50:05] them that ask him so Jesus compares the
[50:09] giftgiving experience we have with mom
[50:11] or dad with Grandma or grandpa with the
[50:13] gift giving experience that we have with
[50:16] God moms and dads especially grandmas
[50:19] and grandpas love giving gifts to
[50:23] grandkids that just uh just they love
[50:26] doing this that's that's a wonderful
[50:27] thing and one thing that if it would if
[50:30] imagine Grandma Grandpa a giftgiving
[50:33] experience that goes like this you've uh
[50:36] you know exactly what uh what uh what
[50:39] what what a young child likes for their
[50:40] birthday and you give it to them they
[50:42] open it up and say oh wow thank you
[50:45] grandma grandpa I love it so much but
[50:47] this is a really expensive gift and they
[50:50] run back to their room and break their
[50:52] piggy bank open because they think I
[50:55] need to pay you back for the gift
[50:58] gift that just kind of ruins the gift of
[51:02] giving experience I won't accept this I
[51:04] need to pay you back for it because this
[51:06] is way too much I'm not deserving of
[51:08] this I I I need to give it back to
[51:11] you that ruins the whole experience you
[51:15] Grand Grandma and Grandpa you do not
[51:17] require your grandkids to work for their
[51:20] Christmas
[51:22] presents they're just your grandkids
[51:24] moms and dads it's the same way
[51:27] and with the holy spirit it's the same
[51:29] way God gives his Spirit to his children
[51:34] who have been born of him and we spoil
[51:37] the experience when we try to work our
[51:40] way into it to be good enough because it
[51:43] is the Father's good pleasure to give us
[51:47] the kingdom he wants to we think we have
[51:50] to work well enough be good enough
[51:52] that's not it at all in fact there's one
[51:55] example in the Bible
[51:57] where someone tried this they tried to
[52:00] where they um they tried to get enough
[52:01] money or whatever for the for for the
[52:03] gift of the Holy Spirit and that didn't
[52:06] go well in the book of Acts um Simon the
[52:10] Sorcerer I think this is in the Samaria
[52:13] he sees that Peter comes and Simon has
[52:15] had his his uh his church he's
[52:17] controlled the people through his
[52:18] teaching and everything and then he sees
[52:21] Peter coming he Peter just lays his
[52:22] hands on the Believers and they receive
[52:24] the Holy Spirit and then and then it's
[52:26] opened up up there Samar and Simon Says
[52:28] man if I could get that I could grow my
[52:33] church like nobody's business so he goes
[52:36] up to Peter afterwards says Peter this
[52:38] is great we can work together here can I
[52:41] get like a franchise where and I and I
[52:43] can and I can pay you I will pay you
[52:46] whatever offering you want I we'll work
[52:48] on commission here so that I can give
[52:51] people this Holy Spirit and Peter says
[52:55] thy money perish with the because you
[52:57] thought the gift of God may be purchased
[52:59] with
[53:00] money now I doubt that very many of us
[53:04] have gone with quite that carnal of a a
[53:07] proposal to the Lord but I could
[53:10] remember at when I was a teenager 15 16
[53:13] years
[53:14] old I had a much more spiritual sounding
[53:17] proposal but I wanted to I thought if I
[53:20] could just pray long enough if I can
[53:22] just fast long enough it's almost like
[53:25] if I could do these things long as it's
[53:26] like twisting God's arm until he finds
[53:28] this Uncle Uncle Uncle fine you've
[53:29] prayed long I'll give you the Holy Ghost
[53:33] now I wasn't offering money I was
[53:36] offering my Works
[53:38] instead even though it sounded so good
[53:42] my intention was so good but I was still
[53:47] injecting myself into the process and
[53:49] finally if God had given the spirit in
[53:50] that way he says man how many hours did
[53:53] you pray I prayed really effective ual
[53:56] fervent prayer of a righteous man avails
[53:58] much look at that prayer then it would
[54:01] based upon my works and not God's grace
[54:05] so whenever we approach God even with
[54:07] the best sounding spiritual sounding
[54:10] Works God says your money perish with
[54:14] you he wants to get us on the complete
[54:17] he wants us to just open our hearts to
[54:19] receive of him not to trade with him and
[54:23] that's something that however it just
[54:25] kind of in since the book of Exodus
[54:28] chapter 19 where the children of Israel
[54:30] said give us something to do in that's
[54:31] kind of ingrained into human nature but
[54:34] our first lesson here today is the holy
[54:36] spirit is a gift the devil loves to
[54:41] confuse us how many of us have wrestled
[54:43] with questions about whether we're
[54:44] filled with the Holy Spirit whether
[54:46] we're saved we've all wrestled with
[54:49] those kinds of questions he loves to
[54:50] confuse us he loves to get us to doubt
[54:54] our experience and he wants to make our
[54:57] Christian experience that that that that
[54:59] Cliffhanger that I was showing
[55:01] us on the other hand God intends for us
[55:04] to have a walk with him a relationship
[55:05] with him that's full of peace and joy
[55:08] now in our study this morning I want to
[55:10] emphasize that the new birth is a
[55:13] supernatural
[55:15] experience hands down Supernatural
[55:17] experience let's keep it that
[55:20] way but if it's a supernatural
[55:24] experience that makes it impossible
[55:26] possible for us to Define what it is and
[55:29] its
[55:30] specifics if it were a natural
[55:32] experience I could explain and say this
[55:34] these are the steps you do it but if
[55:35] it's a supernatural experience it's
[55:38] above my ability to define and explain
[55:42] but we often want to focus on a
[55:44] particular experience I want to have I
[55:47] want to do this in a service I wish I
[55:49] could do if I did this I knew I would
[55:50] have it or if I would just get this
[55:54] Revelation if I got this revelation if
[55:56] you get this Revelation you've got it or
[55:58] if I could just have this level of
[56:01] perfection in my Christian Life I could
[56:02] just overcome these things and I know
[56:04] I'm good enough all those are completely
[56:08] offt Target even though they seem and
[56:10] sound like good things but those good
[56:14] things by pursuing those good things we
[56:17] might actually
[56:18] unintentionally start to seek something
[56:21] else than Christ that's right because as
[56:24] soon as the spirit starts moving into
[56:25] service oh yes
[56:26] it's going to happen now it's going to
[56:27] happen all of us sudden I'm not seeking
[56:29] Christ anymore I'm seeking what's going
[56:30] to happen next but if we could just make
[56:34] Christ Our Central aim that will hit the
[56:38] target every single time and the rest of
[56:40] those things can just fade in the
[56:42] background God can give as he wants when
[56:44] he wants as he wants however he wants or
[56:47] not as he wants he can give us something
[56:49] better but just keep Christ as our
[56:51] Central aim as our Central Target
[56:54] because our works will will always
[56:56] hinder the move of God in their lives if
[56:59] I thinking if I can get enough of X then
[57:01] I'll get the Holy Spirit that's a work
[57:03] there's something of me in that and I
[57:05] don't without realizing it I'm starting
[57:08] to seek God by works instead of faith
[57:11] and when we start to do that when we
[57:13] start to seek God by works instead of
[57:16] faith we start losing our
[57:19] peace when we rest in him ah then we
[57:23] gain our peace back because we can be
[57:25] confident
[57:26] in this very thing that he which began
[57:29] the work will perform it until the day
[57:31] of Jesus
[57:33] Christ he's the author he's the finisher
[57:35] did God start a work in you yes maybe
[57:40] you're disappointed in where you're at
[57:41] in that work that's okay but did God
[57:44] start the work in you yes he will finish
[57:48] it he will no matter where you might be
[57:51] in the journey if you're down here if he
[57:54] started the work he's going to finish it
[57:56] and we can rest in that the Christian
[57:59] Life brother brandom says is built
[58:01] solidly upon
[58:03] rest a Christian's not tossed
[58:06] about now how many of us have been
[58:08] tossed
[58:10] about yes just last week my wife pulled
[58:15] in the driveway and then she's right in
[58:18] front of the garage black smoke starts
[58:20] coming from the hood of our van and she
[58:22] jumps out runs inside her father my
[58:24] father-in-law was and his wife were
[58:26] we're we're we're visiting my in-laws
[58:27] and she's Dad Dad the van's going to
[58:29] blow up it's on fire she was kind of
[58:31] tossed about she text me the van is
[58:33] completely broken I'm starting to get
[58:35] text about my tossed about uh my first
[58:38] calls from mechanic for man sounds like
[58:40] you've got a blown gasket what's that
[58:42] cost couple thousand dollars I'm really
[58:45] tossed about I was strung out last week
[58:49] I really but then the Lord's Grace
[58:52] brought it to another mechanic and he
[58:54] tested everything test everything
[58:56] it was just $130 repair of a little y
[58:59] connection with
[59:00] hoses and then I start I felt really
[59:03] ashamed because God why was I so strung
[59:05] out so yes as Christians our flesh can
[59:08] go up and down and I got really strung
[59:11] out with the kids saw me being so
[59:12] stressed had to back off guys I'm sorry
[59:14] I responded that way let's pray together
[59:16] right now we're going to bring this need
[59:18] to the Lord so can you see the the
[59:20] combination of our
[59:22] Humanity that's just going to stay that
[59:24] way but we can of re it back in and show
[59:28] everybody where we really bring our
[59:29] needs to the Lord and God's faithfulness
[59:32] so yes a Christians not tossed about
[59:34] we've got an anchor he doesn't run from
[59:35] Two and run from place to place doesn't
[59:37] fuss and fume and worry about things a
[59:40] Christian rests it's all over it's all
[59:44] finished for the believer at Calvary I
[59:47] just love uh that's one of my favorite
[59:50] quotes and the entire message who that
[59:52] just brings it back it's resting upon
[59:55] Christ in his work
[59:58] amen so when brother brandom starts to
[1:00:00] talk about in the in the church age book
[1:00:02] about the baptisms of the Holy Spirit
[1:00:05] one of the things he's going to
[1:00:06] emphasize I I'll read a quote to you
[1:00:08] here that the he's emphasizes that the
[1:00:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost is part of
[1:00:14] being born
[1:00:15] again want emphasize here that God is
[1:00:18] Sovereign that means he gets to do
[1:00:20] things the way he wants to do things
[1:00:22] without getting the feedback from us he
[1:00:24] does each meets each individual as he
[1:00:27] chooses and in the church age book
[1:00:29] brother brandom attempts to make himself
[1:00:30] very clear on what the baptis of the
[1:00:33] Holy Ghost is and what it isn't and he
[1:00:37] points his back to the scriptures and
[1:00:38] focuses on the promises that after you
[1:00:40] believe God will baptize with his spirit
[1:00:44] because we believe on him like we read
[1:00:46] in Acts 238 we continue to follow him
[1:00:49] and at some point along the line God
[1:00:52] will fulfill his promise
[1:00:54] amen now one little Wrinkle in this I
[1:00:58] said at some point in time that sentence
[1:01:01] means absolutely nothing to God because
[1:01:03] God is outside of time second Peter says
[1:01:06] a thousand years is a day to God and the
[1:01:08] day is a thousand years to us those are
[1:01:10] very different things but God is outside
[1:01:12] of time so for God for for us for me I
[1:01:16] was 13 years old alter at Camp I had an
[1:01:19] experience with God and then time passes
[1:01:23] and I might have another experience with
[1:01:25] God or I might be going through a dry
[1:01:26] think man looking back to the experience
[1:01:28] I had with God years back that's a human
[1:01:31] way that we refer to it but that's not
[1:01:33] how God sees
[1:01:35] it because when God comes down and
[1:01:37] touches our life for him our experience
[1:01:41] with him begins and it never stops the
[1:01:45] devil wants wants to separate us from
[1:01:48] our experiences the experience of
[1:01:50] something that happened way back years
[1:01:52] ago at the altar that's the time of your
[1:01:55] experience the place of your experience
[1:01:57] it was limited to that
[1:01:59] place and we often will think that way
[1:02:02] cuz that's it's it's it's human but to
[1:02:05] God I am still in that moment I'm still
[1:02:09] I'm in that experience so for God I
[1:02:12] might be I might be repent I might be
[1:02:14] baptized the next week and I I might be
[1:02:16] filled with the Holy Spirit at some
[1:02:18] point a year or two later that's how I
[1:02:20] will refer to it but to God it is all
[1:02:22] the same
[1:02:24] experience we we we we tend to divide
[1:02:27] him up don't do that I've just met the
[1:02:30] Lord I'm going to continue walking with
[1:02:32] him I don't care about the rest really
[1:02:34] doesn't matter if he started the work
[1:02:37] he'll finish it I'm not going to stress
[1:02:39] the specifics I'm continuing to walk
[1:02:41] with God he's going to to handle
[1:02:44] it Satan does all that he can to get us
[1:02:47] to see our experience with God as
[1:02:50] something in the past that's no longer
[1:02:52] part of the
[1:02:53] present that's not correct because God
[1:02:56] will never leave us or forsake
[1:02:59] us so in the smon church age chapter um
[1:03:02] brother bandam says now before we leave
[1:03:04] this subject I want to make myself very
[1:03:07] clear on what the baptism with the Holy
[1:03:10] Ghost is according to the word it's not
[1:03:12] according to me and it's not according
[1:03:14] to you it has to be according to thus at
[1:03:17] the Lord or we are falsely LED amen now
[1:03:21] to begin with you'll notice in my
[1:03:23] meetings when I finished preaching an
[1:03:25] evangelis IC service or some teaching
[1:03:27] message I cast the net and invite a
[1:03:30] response from the people I ask them to
[1:03:33] come forward and receive the Holy Spirit
[1:03:36] how many of us have heard a similar
[1:03:37] invitation probably
[1:03:39] have what do we think at that moment
[1:03:42] that that means let's see what he says
[1:03:46] he says my Pentecostal friends upon
[1:03:48] hearing me say this believe I'm inviting
[1:03:51] people to come forward to be baptized
[1:03:53] with the Holy Ghost because they're
[1:03:54] already born again
[1:03:58] again so when I invite those who are
[1:04:01] spirits filled to come and deal with
[1:04:02] those who've answered the invitation you
[1:04:04] receive the spirit these dear ones surge
[1:04:06] forward and deal with the people in such
[1:04:07] a manner as to encourage them to yield
[1:04:09] to God and believe to speak in
[1:04:12] tongues this has caused a great deal of
[1:04:15] confusion and I want to tell you exactly
[1:04:18] what I mean I mean for The Sinner to
[1:04:21] come forward and be born again which is
[1:04:25] to to be baptized into the body of
[1:04:27] Christ by the Holy
[1:04:29] Ghost once you start that first step
[1:04:33] it's like once the woman conceives it's
[1:04:35] all the rest of it's all going to happen
[1:04:36] the whole package is there it's just a
[1:04:38] matter of time it just started so once
[1:04:41] you come that seed of God's quickened
[1:04:43] within you it's just a matter of time
[1:04:46] you're going to show it all it's all
[1:04:47] going to take place I mean for The
[1:04:50] Sinner to come forward and be born again
[1:04:52] which is to be baptized in the body of
[1:04:54] Christ by the Holy G ghost which is
[1:04:56] exactly what took place at Pentecost
[1:04:58] when the church was launched in other
[1:05:00] words to be born of the spirit is to be
[1:05:03] truly baptized with the Holy Ghost it is
[1:05:07] one and the
[1:05:09] same it's
[1:05:11] simple we like to separate it into
[1:05:13] different
[1:05:14] steps but it's all one in the same
[1:05:18] experience all one in the same
[1:05:20] experience now some of us um I might be
[1:05:23] just me but I'm guessing there are at
[1:05:25] least a couple of of us in here who tend
[1:05:27] to approach god with a bit of a
[1:05:28] checklist mentality that okay God you
[1:05:31] tell me what you want me to do I'll do
[1:05:33] it and then that means you're going to
[1:05:35] do this for me we might not be that
[1:05:38] blatant with it but it's kind of in our
[1:05:40] de in our mental DNA that's kind of the
[1:05:42] thought pattern and um one way I can
[1:05:46] just share that this H that I kind of
[1:05:48] see this the wrongness of this part
[1:05:50] happening is uh years back I was a
[1:05:53] probably 17 years old or so I can
[1:05:56] remember because of which car I drove
[1:05:57] after at that time but I was about 17
[1:05:59] years old after work one evening um went
[1:06:02] over to a to a a friend's house they
[1:06:04] weren't living there yet but there was
[1:06:06] it was almost finished we had the some
[1:06:08] guys we got let's have let's have a
[1:06:10] prayer meeting in uh in John's basement
[1:06:13] so we got together and we just uh it was
[1:06:16] somebody just started praying it was a a
[1:06:20] sovereign M it was a sovereign time of
[1:06:22] prayer where one brother just started
[1:06:25] praying we're just praying along with
[1:06:26] him all of a sudden just he just started
[1:06:29] praying I mean it's like like the holy
[1:06:31] spirit's just making intercession
[1:06:33] through him and this this isn't him
[1:06:34] praying anymore this is God this is
[1:06:36] God's here with us and then he just kind
[1:06:39] of his prayer kind ended in all then it
[1:06:41] seemed like the spirit moved to another
[1:06:43] brother he just started praying and just
[1:06:45] it was just one and just goes on for
[1:06:47] over an hour no just it was just really
[1:06:50] really special time just amazing it's
[1:06:53] just time a moment with God they'll
[1:06:55] never for
[1:06:56] get we loved it and the next week we
[1:06:59] said hey guys let's have another prayer
[1:07:02] meeting so we did and I thought hey you
[1:07:04] know what it went really well last week
[1:07:06] when I asked Brother David to open in
[1:07:09] prayer so Brother David would you open
[1:07:12] in prayer again and the same brother
[1:07:18] prayed then I prayed somebody else
[1:07:20] prayed it was it it was like flat same
[1:07:24] people
[1:07:26] same desire was just flat and I realized
[1:07:29] later that I was almost approaching
[1:07:31] something as Supernatural as as as as
[1:07:34] intimate as a time of prayer with a
[1:07:36] checklist mentality and when I did that
[1:07:39] I like so cheapened the supernatural
[1:07:43] experience so cheapens it so when we
[1:07:46] approach god with a checklist mentality
[1:07:48] we can be doing with the best of
[1:07:50] intentions with the purest of Hearts but
[1:07:53] we're still the devil is leading us to
[1:07:54] put a little bit of
[1:07:55] ourselves into the process and that
[1:07:58] changes the dynamic
[1:08:01] completely completely so um for those of
[1:08:05] us with that that checklist mentality
[1:08:06] because if there's any checklist in the
[1:08:08] Bible anything like a
[1:08:10] checklist repent be baptized you shall
[1:08:13] receive the gift of the Holy Spirit
[1:08:14] that's as close as I can get to finding
[1:08:16] a pretty clear checklist well this quote
[1:08:19] just throws it all out for me the
[1:08:21] apostolic way God had no set rule what
[1:08:25] no set rule acts 238 seems like that to
[1:08:28] me but he says no set rule when the
[1:08:30] heart's hungry he'll give you what
[1:08:33] you're hungering for if you want the
[1:08:35] Holy Ghost it can fall on you right now
[1:08:38] and the classic example from the Bible
[1:08:40] is when Peter is ministering at the
[1:08:43] Gentile cornelius's house and as Peter
[1:08:46] is ministering the Holy Spirit falls
[1:08:48] down upon them and these Gentiles I
[1:08:51] think they started speaking with tongues
[1:08:52] I'm not not I'm not not mistaken on that
[1:08:54] part but it was very to Peter man the
[1:08:56] Holy Ghost has fallen upon them and they
[1:08:57] haven't even been baptized yet they
[1:09:00] broke the rule that God gave God he's
[1:09:03] Sovereign he can always break his own
[1:09:06] rule so so to speak and I just kind of
[1:09:09] thought about that if God hadn't given
[1:09:12] the Holy Ghost to those Gentile
[1:09:14] Believers I wonder if Peter would have
[1:09:16] baptized them Peter was a pretty
[1:09:19] Prejudice guy so when God said when God
[1:09:23] pours out his holy spirit on these
[1:09:25] Gentiles he's saying to Peter these
[1:09:27] folks have my stamp of approval they
[1:09:30] better get yours you better baptize them
[1:09:34] but the point here is that God doesn't
[1:09:35] have the set God is not a checklist kind
[1:09:38] of God when you're hungry he'll give you
[1:09:41] what you ask for and you know what um
[1:09:46] Matthew 5 says even if you're
[1:09:48] hungering you haven't even been your
[1:09:51] hunger hasn't been satisfied yet but the
[1:09:52] very Act of having spiritual hunger
[1:09:55] carries a blessing with it because they
[1:09:57] that hunger and thirst after
[1:09:59] righteousness they shall be filled
[1:10:03] you're blessed just because you're
[1:10:05] Desiring the
[1:10:07] blessing and this testifies to the truth
[1:10:09] that you couldn't have a desire for
[1:10:11] something that didn't
[1:10:14] exist if that desire is there there is
[1:10:16] something there for that to be satisfied
[1:10:19] with that desire speaks of something
[1:10:21] else to come and satisfy it now
[1:10:24] sometimes when we we get to seeking and
[1:10:27] we can be seeking God and we and brother
[1:10:29] Brandon has a message called
[1:10:31] desperations we can get the feeling like
[1:10:34] man I need to I need to get desperate
[1:10:35] before God and there's a little bit of I
[1:10:38] think a confusion that could go on in
[1:10:40] our minds what the word desperate
[1:10:42] means desperate does not mean
[1:10:45] despair because despair is negative I'm
[1:10:49] despairing I have no hope I've got I I
[1:10:51] don't see any way out I am I am
[1:10:53] despairing that's different than being
[1:10:55] desperate when you've got such a strong
[1:10:57] desire that that nothing else can even
[1:11:00] come come close competing with that
[1:11:02] desire so when we are having a desperate
[1:11:06] desire for God it means we've got a
[1:11:07] really strong hunger we don't have to
[1:11:09] get
[1:11:10] despairing because God has promised and
[1:11:12] he will
[1:11:15] fulfill and what I kind of kind of come
[1:11:18] to see Satan's primary tool with many of
[1:11:22] us is confusion
[1:11:26] because I know I had a i my my walk with
[1:11:29] the Lord started um at an altar at a
[1:11:32] youth camp and I was just 13 years old
[1:11:35] started there the few years down the
[1:11:37] road I got to think and and did I really
[1:11:40] experience something there or not was it
[1:11:42] was it what was was it true what I had
[1:11:44] experienced or not and just kind of go
[1:11:46] back and forth and I'm sure we all have
[1:11:48] some um we can identify with that in
[1:11:50] some sense and I remember one one
[1:11:52] evening I was at home and just I think
[1:11:54] it was just my dad and me at home that
[1:11:55] evening and I I was down enough that I
[1:11:58] could even talk to Dad about it for some
[1:11:59] reason as teenagers we' had a hard time
[1:12:01] talking with mom or dad that just kind
[1:12:02] of how it goes um but God our parents uh
[1:12:08] know us better than anybody else they've
[1:12:10] probably prayed for us more than anybody
[1:12:11] else has and that was great just to be
[1:12:13] able to open up to him and he he said
[1:12:16] rap man when you came back from Camp you
[1:12:18] were you were you were a different kid
[1:12:20] you were different and that was a great
[1:12:23] reminder because i' just been
[1:12:25] gotten confused and I'd gotten so
[1:12:29] confused that I wasn't even accessing
[1:12:33] those blessings that God had given me
[1:12:36] confusion robs us of blessings of what
[1:12:40] God has already done for us God had
[1:12:44] already started to work in me but if s
[1:12:47] which is an exclamation point he started
[1:12:50] the work yes but if Satan can bend that
[1:12:53] exclamation point that experience to ack
[1:12:55] question mark did God start the work
[1:12:57] then all of a sudden it's not a blessed
[1:13:01] experience it's a cliffhanger experience
[1:13:04] again and if we're experiencing that
[1:13:06] Cliffhanger experience it means that
[1:13:08] there's something wrong in our thinking
[1:13:09] somewhere that we're that that we're
[1:13:11] buying into a lie of the devil somewhere
[1:13:13] because God is not the author of
[1:13:16] confusion but of Peace So if we're
[1:13:20] having some kind of a cliffhanger
[1:13:21] experience you just relax and rest on
[1:13:24] the links of that Divine chain of Grace
[1:13:26] and he'll carry you through and you'll
[1:13:28] enjoy the ride much better you really
[1:13:32] will but Satan uses confusion about the
[1:13:34] New Birth experience to Rob us of the
[1:13:37] blessings of what God has already done
[1:13:40] for us now when Jesus meets with
[1:13:42] Nicodemus in John chapter 3 he compares
[1:13:46] the Holy Spirit to the wind the wind
[1:13:49] blows where it listeth where it wants to
[1:13:52] and you hear the wind but you don't know
[1:13:54] where it's coming from from where it's
[1:13:56] going and he says that's exactly the way
[1:13:59] the spirit
[1:14:01] moves who can grab the wind you can't
[1:14:04] grab the wind you can hear it coming but
[1:14:08] where's it going you you don't know and
[1:14:10] brother bradam says you don't know where
[1:14:11] the wind comes from where it's been or
[1:14:14] where it's going but you know one thing
[1:14:16] you know where it's going to take you
[1:14:18] he's applying that to the spirit
[1:14:20] wherever it came from it'll take you
[1:14:23] back with it amen that's how he looks at
[1:14:26] the the Holy
[1:14:27] Spirit but the spiritual nature of the
[1:14:31] new birth makes it difficult to pin down
[1:14:34] the particulars because we want to know
[1:14:38] when did our walk with God start when
[1:14:41] did this happen to me there's something
[1:14:43] in us that wants to pin those things
[1:14:45] down um but I'll warn you if it's if
[1:14:48] brother if Jesus is comparing the spirit
[1:14:51] of God to the wind it's going to be hard
[1:14:54] to grab
[1:14:55] those particulars of the experience I
[1:14:57] would say hey just if the spirit's
[1:14:59] moving put your sail up and let that
[1:15:02] wind whever it's coming from it'll take
[1:15:04] you take you with it that's what we want
[1:15:07] I really enjoyed this next statement of
[1:15:09] brother Brandon I don't know the
[1:15:12] mechanics of the Holy
[1:15:14] Ghost but I know it's fell on me I don't
[1:15:17] know the mechanics of it and really what
[1:15:19] I don't care I don't I I don't care how
[1:15:23] my the mechanics find getting my car
[1:15:25] started some people really like that and
[1:15:27] they think that's that enriches their
[1:15:28] lives their experience it might enrich
[1:15:29] their their their pocketbook but I
[1:15:31] really don't care as long as it starts
[1:15:34] and I don't know the mechanics of the
[1:15:35] Holy Ghost but I know it fell on me
[1:15:38] that's the important thing I can't tell
[1:15:39] the mechanics of it but I know the
[1:15:41] blessings of it that's all I care to
[1:15:43] know about is the blessings of the Holy
[1:15:45] Ghost and mechanics he works them that's
[1:15:49] his secret God lets nobody into his
[1:15:52] kitchen think about the uh and and and
[1:15:55] in the book of Exodus or or numbers when
[1:15:57] they're they're given instructions how
[1:15:59] to make the perfume that the priest use
[1:16:02] that was a top secret recipe only the
[1:16:04] priest knew it and you know what it's
[1:16:08] Sovereign we can one thing will happen
[1:16:10] in one service and that's just for that
[1:16:13] service and we can try to imitate at
[1:16:15] another service and and it goes flat
[1:16:18] because it's not our recipe it's his
[1:16:21] recipe that's his
[1:16:23] secret God doesn't doesn't want us to
[1:16:25] seek a particular experience a certain
[1:16:29] Revelation or a particular level of
[1:16:31] perfection he wants us to seek Him and
[1:16:35] when we seek anything else it really
[1:16:38] cheapens The Experience so you think all
[1:16:41] that I am is that there's so much more
[1:16:44] to me than that God says just seek
[1:16:47] me sometimes we can get to analyzing our
[1:16:50] own experience with God like the bark on
[1:16:54] the tree man we just we we zoom in So
[1:16:57] Close how what is my experience with
[1:16:59] Godlike we just zoom in So Close get the
[1:17:01] details you know what scientists
[1:17:04] biologists they probably learn a lot
[1:17:06] people can really enjoy um studying the
[1:17:09] bark on a particular tree but if that's
[1:17:11] all that they see they're going to miss
[1:17:15] the forest for the
[1:17:17] trees and that's what it is like with us
[1:17:20] when we get to look so much examining
[1:17:22] our experience with the best of
[1:17:24] intentions
[1:17:25] that we can actually miss the beauty of
[1:17:28] what God is doing in broader terms in
[1:17:31] our lives and
[1:17:34] further so um we can just let God be
[1:17:41] God I remember years back uh I again I
[1:17:44] was going through a time and this was a
[1:17:46] different time and I was wrestling um am
[1:17:49] I Born of the do I have the new birth am
[1:17:51] I bapti the Holy Ghost all these things
[1:17:54] which kind brother brand says it kind of
[1:17:56] boils down to being the same thing I I
[1:17:58] was wrestling through it and I remember
[1:18:00] talking to to one older brother and he
[1:18:03] asked me the question R do you remember
[1:18:07] when you were
[1:18:09] born you I
[1:18:13] don't I
[1:18:15] don't and he looked at me and says but
[1:18:18] it looks to me like you were born cuz
[1:18:21] you're sitting right here and eating my
[1:18:22] food drinking my drink you were born
[1:18:26] and you can look at this this picture of
[1:18:28] this little baby and is this little baby
[1:18:31] alive well I know it's a picture of a
[1:18:32] baby but there's a picture of a a living
[1:18:35] live
[1:18:36] baby Pink Cheeks happy little smile this
[1:18:39] Baby's smile and things it looks like a
[1:18:41] live baby you know what we want to do is
[1:18:45] said this baby is not alive until we can
[1:18:47] go and find the birth certificate only
[1:18:49] when I find the birth certificate that
[1:18:50] says when it happened where it happened
[1:18:53] who was the doctor there on they're at
[1:18:55] the uh they're at the hospital only then
[1:18:57] if I see the birth certificate will I
[1:18:58] accept that you're alive now a
[1:19:00] government official will rely upon the
[1:19:02] birth certificate even though you're
[1:19:03] standing there personally but no we
[1:19:05] don't have to depend upon the birth
[1:19:07] certificate with all the details Stamped
[1:19:09] Out am I alive I am I am I'm alive do I
[1:19:14] remember do you remember when you were
[1:19:15] born you remember who the the the doctor
[1:19:18] was present you remember that you
[1:19:19] remember what time of day it was no but
[1:19:21] is he born he's shaking is he moving
[1:19:23] around yes he was born which tells me
[1:19:26] Hallelujah that my inability to remember
[1:19:29] the details of my birth does not alter
[1:19:31] alter the fact of your birth it doesn't
[1:19:35] matter it doesn't matter now I can
[1:19:38] remember when I was a young person I was
[1:19:40] at uh we had a we had a youth meeting
[1:19:42] and a bunch of young people in a circle
[1:19:43] there together and Pastor asked a
[1:19:46] question how many of you can remember
[1:19:48] the specific moment when the Lord came
[1:19:51] and filled you with his spirit and a
[1:19:53] couple hands went up I think wow those
[1:19:56] are really those are the real spiritual
[1:19:58] young people those are the the spiritual
[1:19:59] Powerhouse man I wish I had that
[1:20:03] experience you know what 20 25 years
[1:20:06] down the line those particular people
[1:20:08] who could raise their hands so
[1:20:10] confidently I've gone completely off the
[1:20:13] rails completely in the world not
[1:20:15] serving God in any fashion or form
[1:20:18] they're completely
[1:20:20] gone so they might have had or saw a
[1:20:24] particular experience a particular
[1:20:28] Revelation or a particular level of that
[1:20:32] they had detained and kept kept kept a
[1:20:34] certain standard for a long enough time
[1:20:36] yeah I've got it now but you know what
[1:20:38] if you're seeking any of those things
[1:20:39] without seeking on Christ there's no
[1:20:41] keeping power in
[1:20:43] that so even though they they were so
[1:20:46] confident that this was it this might
[1:20:48] have been a time when they experienced a
[1:20:50] certain thing but if it doesn't go deep
[1:20:53] and it's really Christ in you there's
[1:20:55] not the holding power there so if you
[1:20:57] today can't remember the particular
[1:20:59] specifics and that's been a hangout for
[1:21:01] you it's been a hang up for me for a
[1:21:03] while too you don't have to take your
[1:21:05] spiritual pulse do you have a desire for
[1:21:08] God you do then God started something
[1:21:10] because that's not natural and we can
[1:21:13] just rest in what God started and he
[1:21:15] will finish it the rest of the
[1:21:18] way yes sir and let's just take an
[1:21:20] example of this um of this kind of
[1:21:24] experience that brother brandom actually
[1:21:25] actually tells himself he tells about a
[1:21:29] a man who comes um he was a he was a
[1:21:31] businessman and he'd been seeking God
[1:21:34] for years and um he said this he tells
[1:21:38] brother Brandon that his his wife had
[1:21:40] been able to she went to a particular
[1:21:42] camp meeting and she'd gotten the spirit
[1:21:45] and was completely changed and he said
[1:21:48] uh I've been trying to get saved for
[1:21:50] years ever since and what what got him
[1:21:53] going was uh he there was somewhere in a
[1:21:56] restaurant or a bathroom somewhere he's
[1:21:58] all dist tracked is there a way to be
[1:22:00] saved and he picks it up and starts
[1:22:02] reading it and says man and that's kind
[1:22:04] of what started this whole this whole
[1:22:07] thing and he says I've uh I've tried for
[1:22:09] years I've been I've had so many
[1:22:11] experiences I've tried to get saved and
[1:22:12] brother brandom I think I've just
[1:22:15] crossed the
[1:22:16] line where I can't get saved brother
[1:22:19] Brandon and the brother brand say ah I I
[1:22:21] don't know about that and he said but
[1:22:24] look I I went to Billy grah to uh uh to
[1:22:26] Billy Grahams meetings wonderful man of
[1:22:29] God and he made an invitation I raised
[1:22:31] my hand came forward went into the
[1:22:33] inquiry room and was was talked to we
[1:22:36] prayed prayed the sinner's prayer and
[1:22:37] things the people great you're saved
[1:22:40] wonderful but they said I just nothing
[1:22:43] really happened I went on I I went on a
[1:22:46] couple years later I found the Free
[1:22:47] Methodist and they said hey if you just
[1:22:49] get happy enough to shout then you've
[1:22:51] got then you're you're saved he said I
[1:22:53] was there with them for a while and I
[1:22:54] finally got happy enough to shout they
[1:22:56] said yes you've got it brother they said
[1:22:59] it just wasn't wasn't content with it I
[1:23:03] still didn't have a he said I was still
[1:23:04] searching for all that I could and I
[1:23:07] went later to brother uh brother Roberts
[1:23:09] meetings or Oral Roberts and they took
[1:23:10] me back into the room and told me I had
[1:23:12] to speak with tongues and I they prayed
[1:23:15] over me long enough until I finally
[1:23:17] spoke with tongues but you know
[1:23:19] what I still didn't have it I just don't
[1:23:22] know what to do
[1:23:25] and then I was down in Shri Port he said
[1:23:26] at the office of the voice of healing
[1:23:28] and they told me that you were a prophet
[1:23:31] and I should come up here and you'd be
[1:23:32] able to reveal to me when the spirit
[1:23:34] would to come on you what my trouble was
[1:23:38] and I was reading this back in the
[1:23:39] office I had noticed this before imagine
[1:23:42] if someone has sent you to another
[1:23:45] Minister and says my this minister is
[1:23:48] the prophet of God and when the spirit
[1:23:50] comes upon him he'll tell you what you
[1:23:52] should do listen brother Brandon's
[1:23:55] response to that he says brother you
[1:23:57] don't have to be a prophet to do that
[1:24:00] the word of God settles that it doesn't
[1:24:04] need profit man me this man is coming to
[1:24:07] brother Brandon with a setup for brother
[1:24:08] brand to make himself greater and to
[1:24:10] lead the brother off track but he brings
[1:24:12] it right back says you don't need a
[1:24:13] profit for that it's right in your Bible
[1:24:15] I thought that was so so humble and how
[1:24:18] he just points this points the brother
[1:24:20] points us right back to the source not
[1:24:23] to himself because if it had been him
[1:24:25] answering the question the brother's
[1:24:27] Faith would depend on brother brother
[1:24:28] Brandon but he didn't pointed right back
[1:24:30] to the word and look at how he answers
[1:24:32] the brother's question he says my
[1:24:34] brother the only thing you're just
[1:24:40] confused I want to ask you something
[1:24:42] brother Brandon says in these slides the
[1:24:44] green is brother Brandon speaking the
[1:24:46] blue is the brother I want to ask you
[1:24:48] something did you always love the Lord
[1:24:51] Jesus said well I belong to the
[1:24:53] Pentecostal Church church but I just
[1:24:55] went
[1:24:56] there well what happened that you
[1:24:59] changed your mind all at once he says
[1:25:02] one day I was coming in for making a
[1:25:04] sale out in the yard and I happened to
[1:25:05] reach in my pocket and somebody had
[1:25:07] given me a little old
[1:25:10] track and I sat down in the office and
[1:25:13] begin to read this track and the
[1:25:15] awfulest feeling came over me that I
[1:25:18] ought to get right with
[1:25:19] God and I've been searching ever since
[1:25:25] and brother brand I want to ask you
[1:25:26] something when this feeling come over
[1:25:28] you you've never been able to get out of
[1:25:30] it no sir I haven't well that's when you
[1:25:36] received
[1:25:41] Christ I couldn't believe it all that
[1:25:46] time all that what does confusion do it
[1:25:49] robs you of a blessing you already have
[1:25:52] he says that's when you received Christ
[1:25:56] it doesn't mean raising up your hands
[1:25:59] that's all right shouting speaking in
[1:26:01] tongues all the demonstrations that's
[1:26:03] attributes that follows this but first
[1:26:05] just receive
[1:26:06] Christ then brother brandom I've been
[1:26:09] saved all the time sure look do you love
[1:26:13] him with all my heart but one time you
[1:26:16] didn't love him that's right and now you
[1:26:19] love him that's the truth well you had
[1:26:22] him all the time
[1:26:25] and he jumped off the porch and began
[1:26:27] crying holding me in his arms oh god
[1:26:29] I've been a Christian all these
[1:26:32] years you see the thing if it was he
[1:26:35] wasn't straightened out in the
[1:26:38] beginning brother Brandon didn't even
[1:26:41] pray for
[1:26:43] him it was the truth that set him
[1:26:47] free as all it was
[1:26:55] so repentance starting starting
[1:26:58] responding to God that's a part of
[1:27:00] receiving the Holy Spirit as God is
[1:27:03] sanctifying our life that's part of
[1:27:05] receiving the Holy Spirit we don't have
[1:27:07] to separate them into separate pieces
[1:27:09] now I've done this I've done a so B's
[1:27:11] going to come and C's going to come next
[1:27:13] hey sanctification is a lifelong process
[1:27:16] there it that doesn't stop I'm dead um
[1:27:20] but it's just it's it's we don't have to
[1:27:22] separate them the separate parts because
[1:27:24] all one experience so there's no reason
[1:27:27] to worry about where we are in the
[1:27:30] process God started the work right he'll
[1:27:33] see it through and uh you can think
[1:27:35] about that with the birth of a baby hey
[1:27:38] you got water breaking blood spirit but
[1:27:40] you know what it's all part of the
[1:27:42] process mom is not obsessing about
[1:27:44] exactly where I am in the process she
[1:27:45] just wants that baby out that's all that
[1:27:47] it is and once that life is in us we we
[1:27:50] can just rest that life it's going to
[1:27:52] come out it's good it's going to be
[1:27:54] there we can just rest and you know what
[1:27:56] the more that we get stressed in the
[1:27:58] process the longer it takes we just want
[1:28:00] to relax and let God have his way with
[1:28:06] us we must wait on the Holy Spirit till
[1:28:08] it's done something not necessarily
[1:28:10] because we spoke in tongues or because
[1:28:12] we danced or got emotional or shattered
[1:28:14] but until we were changed until
[1:28:16] something actually happened that is the
[1:28:18] biggest thing until we're changed I
[1:28:20] don't care what form it comes in just so
[1:28:22] it happened that's the main thing
[1:28:24] if it's loud if it's not loud I don't
[1:28:26] care if there's running and dancing
[1:28:28] fantastic if there's not that's fine too
[1:28:30] the main thing that I'm changed that's
[1:28:33] the main thing
[1:28:35] amen each Christian's experience can be
[1:28:40] different will be different and that's a
[1:28:44] beautiful
[1:28:45] thing I like this scripture of second
[1:28:47] Corinthians when we measure ourselves by
[1:28:50] ourselves and compare ourselves among
[1:28:52] ourselves we are not one
[1:28:55] eyes so yes it's a very natural thing to
[1:28:57] do that you can look and and I mean I
[1:29:00] how many of us have looked at at the
[1:29:02] testimony of older Christians
[1:29:04] before sometimes very often it could be
[1:29:07] inspiring but I've actually even been
[1:29:09] discouraged by it sometimes it's like
[1:29:12] how will I ever be like them Lord and I
[1:29:15] have a I have a testimony in my Bible
[1:29:17] from July for from 11th July 2001 it's
[1:29:20] still here first I I'm going to a camp
[1:29:23] and says
[1:29:24] the first I want victory in two specific
[1:29:26] areas of my life it says I want to be
[1:29:28] encouraged not discouraged by stronger
[1:29:31] Christians because I would see what
[1:29:33] their likes man I'm nothing like that
[1:29:36] there there must be classes of Believers
[1:29:38] there's first class Believers there's
[1:29:40] Comfort class Believers and I'm
[1:29:41] somewhere in economy class Believers but
[1:29:44] that's that was that was the mentality
[1:29:46] because I was comparing myself with them
[1:29:48] and saying what how could I be like them
[1:29:51] but the song isn't to be like my brother
[1:29:54] to be like my sister on Earth I long to
[1:29:57] be like them that's not the song that's
[1:30:00] not the song to be like
[1:30:03] Jesus that's that's the song um God is a
[1:30:08] god of
[1:30:09] variety he made you in this congregation
[1:30:13] your family each M of your family he
[1:30:14] made you in a variety some men are real
[1:30:17] blusterous we can all think in our minds
[1:30:20] who are the blusterous
[1:30:21] individuals some people are real dog
[1:30:24] atic those come up really fast so that
[1:30:25] black white people my goodness they're
[1:30:27] such IL legalists others are fine others
[1:30:30] are
[1:30:32] kind and you find all kinds of different
[1:30:34] people and all in his
[1:30:37] kingdom he didn't say the blessers and
[1:30:39] dogmatic people were fine and kind but
[1:30:42] they're in his kingdom all the same so
[1:30:45] we we're made in a unique way all of us
[1:30:48] are made differently but um he he talks
[1:30:51] about he says you can look at St Peter
[1:30:53] and judge by Andrew Andrew is this
[1:30:55] prayer Warrior just stayed on his knees
[1:30:57] all the time and Peter is one of those
[1:30:58] fire brands that preached and so forth
[1:31:01] and Paul was more scholarly like like
[1:31:03] the prophet or something and Moses wrote
[1:31:06] the first four books of the Old
[1:31:07] Testament he wrote the Old Testament and
[1:31:09] said and Paul wrote with the New
[1:31:10] Testament and all these are different
[1:31:12] kinds of people you look at the
[1:31:14] disciples how they just kind of graded
[1:31:15] on each other sometimes they're but
[1:31:17] they're all different but all in his
[1:31:20] kingdom I can remember growing up
[1:31:22] standing in the church next to to a
[1:31:24] friend of mine we just be singing Praise
[1:31:26] ra raising their hands praising the Lord
[1:31:28] I'd look over and man it's like he's
[1:31:31] just weeping weeping weeping and I like
[1:31:33] man I squeeze my eyes a little tighter
[1:31:35] just no nothing comes out nothing comes
[1:31:37] out but and for a while long man I
[1:31:40] what's wrong with me but then I I kind
[1:31:43] of got to realize we're just built
[1:31:45] differently I mean if his dad does
[1:31:48] prayer requests he's going to be weeping
[1:31:50] within saying the first couple read the
[1:31:52] first couple words he's just got to real
[1:31:54] s that's the way he's built my dad's
[1:31:56] just is pretty dry and practical that's
[1:31:58] just but neither one is more spiritual
[1:32:00] than the other just have to rest in how
[1:32:03] God made us God is a god of variety and
[1:32:06] our experiences will be customade for
[1:32:10] you don't seek someone else's experience
[1:32:13] just seek God and he will come custom
[1:32:15] made for
[1:32:17] you but you know what um we all looking
[1:32:21] for evidence of some kind we want to
[1:32:23] find what is the evidence what can I pin
[1:32:26] down say this is evidence that God is
[1:32:27] working in my life and this is the only
[1:32:30] thing that uh the biggest thing we have
[1:32:32] to go on John 14:26 alludes to it the
[1:32:36] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[1:32:38] the father will send into my name he
[1:32:40] shall teach you all things and bring all
[1:32:43] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[1:32:47] have said unto you and brother brandom
[1:32:50] says um the evidence is hearing what the
[1:32:54] spirit
[1:32:56] says you can have all kinds of
[1:32:59] experiences but if the holy spirit's
[1:33:01] speaking and you don't have an ear to
[1:33:04] hear
[1:33:04] it you don't have that receiver there
[1:33:07] you can do all that you want but doesn't
[1:33:10] mean you have it then he that hath an
[1:33:12] ear let him hear what the spirit said
[1:33:15] unto the churches the spirit is speaking
[1:33:16] in each Church age only to those who
[1:33:18] have an ear had something to receive it
[1:33:22] the evidence for the brand says is
[1:33:24] hearing what the spirit says the spirit
[1:33:26] is talking yes the spirit is teaching
[1:33:29] that's exactly what Jesus said he would
[1:33:31] do when he came and he says later in the
[1:33:35] smon church age um the evidence of a
[1:33:38] Spirit-filled Christian believer is not
[1:33:40] to produce the truth or produce the word
[1:33:41] or to produce the life but to receive
[1:33:44] the truth receive the word and to
[1:33:47] believe it and to obey
[1:33:50] it so in Matthew 13 we can say okay I
[1:33:54] just have to hear the word believe the
[1:33:57] word receive the word it's it's that
[1:33:59] it's it's that simple let's want to kind
[1:34:02] of there's a little bit of a hangup we
[1:34:03] can get into sometimes there too Matthew
[1:34:06] 13 Jesus is speaking to the disciples
[1:34:08] after he's gone through all kinds
[1:34:10] teaching Parables and a lot of people
[1:34:12] didn't understand the Parables but the
[1:34:14] but Jesus tells the disciples blessed
[1:34:16] are your eyes for they see and your ears
[1:34:19] for they hear and the disciples get
[1:34:21] happy yes we are blessed because we have
[1:34:24] eyes to see and ears to
[1:34:27] hear and you can feel this way too
[1:34:30] sometimes and you've been told by a
[1:34:32] minister you hear brother Brandon
[1:34:33] preaching it that that if you hear the
[1:34:35] word for your day you've got it that
[1:34:38] that's that that that's that's the
[1:34:40] evidence then you can go through the
[1:34:42] what happens then if you're sitting in a
[1:34:44] service and you don't understand what
[1:34:47] the spirit has spoken that particular
[1:34:50] service then you start going were were
[1:34:53] were like this wellow the evidence is
[1:34:55] hearing the truth but I couldn't even
[1:34:57] understand it so where does that leave
[1:34:59] me that's tough so let's see what these
[1:35:03] disciples who were told at the beginning
[1:35:05] of the chapter blessed are your eyes for
[1:35:07] they see and your ears for they hear
[1:35:10] Jesus tells all these Parables about the
[1:35:13] sewer who went forth to sew and Seed by
[1:35:15] the waist all all these different things
[1:35:17] then the multitudes go
[1:35:19] away Jesus sent them away and he went
[1:35:21] into his house and his disciples came to
[1:35:23] him saying hey Jesus would you explain
[1:35:27] the parable to us because we didn't get
[1:35:31] it that first they were like yeah we've
[1:35:34] got blessed eyes but when they don't
[1:35:36] hear it they think man where does it
[1:35:38] leave us now God where does it leave us
[1:35:41] I thought I was blessed if I don't if I
[1:35:42] don't understand Daniel's 70 weeks or
[1:35:45] the mark of the beast or the seventh
[1:35:47] seal is there any hope left for me
[1:35:50] that's where we start going with our
[1:35:52] minds and I want to show us something
[1:35:55] here um and just see what we see here
[1:35:58] and we'll use it as an illustration
[1:36:01] we've got a picture here what do you see
[1:36:03] in the picture what do we see here what
[1:36:06] what the what are some of the first
[1:36:08] things your eyes might fall on brother

[1:37:02] you know there's an elephant there you
[1:37:04] can't let go of the picture until you
[1:37:05] actually see it all right that's what
[1:37:08] Jesus was saying blessed are your eyes
[1:37:10] for they
[1:37:12] see that there is something to be seen
[1:37:15] glory and once you know that there's
[1:37:17] something to be seen you won't let take

[1:38:10] trunk he's got it he's got it wow
[1:38:16] wow blessed are your eyes for you see
[1:38:20] and you can leave a sermon I've I've
[1:38:22] left Services sometimes has been in the
[1:38:24] back as and everybody is just seeming so
[1:38:26] re revelated elevated everything like
[1:38:30] that I'm like in the depths back at the
[1:38:31] back because I don't under I feel like I
[1:38:33] didn't get a single thing about it and
[1:38:36] when that happens the devil just starts
[1:38:38] whispering to you must not have ears to
[1:38:42] hear where does that put you now you can
[1:38:46] go on down that road and everybody's
[1:38:48] praising God and I couldn't even put my
[1:38:50] hands together and then I got to think
[1:38:53] hold on hold up hold up do I believe
[1:38:56] that Jesus died on the cross for
[1:38:58] me I do do I believe I'm I put my faith
[1:39:02] yes I'm saved yes I believe that and all
[1:39:05] of a sudden I started singing again
[1:39:07] praising him again I didn't understand
[1:39:09] everything in that service but I knew
[1:39:10] that he had begun a work in me don't let
[1:39:13] the devil ever take that away from you
[1:39:16] just hold that hold on to that let him
[1:39:18] hold on to you keep praising him for
[1:39:20] that and then you see that there's
[1:39:21] something to see you know there's
[1:39:23] something to hear stay tuned in and this
[1:39:27] brother was slower than even his wife
[1:39:30] but eventually God showed it to him too
[1:39:34] we're all there very
[1:39:37] good all
[1:39:41] there
[1:39:44] sorry don't impersonate somebody else's
[1:39:49] experience and we can try to do that um
[1:39:53] some us might have just done it right
[1:39:54] now by saying yeah I see the elephant we
[1:39:56] might not have how many of us have said
[1:39:58] amen before when we really didn't get it
[1:40:00] either yeah that can happen that can
[1:40:03] happen that can happen don't impersonate
[1:40:06] somebody else's experience because God
[1:40:07] is going to if you're a child of God
[1:40:09] you'll get it in the time that God has
[1:40:11] for you they've got little kids I I I I
[1:40:14] teach I teach at school and you know
[1:40:16] some some five or six year olds are
[1:40:18] ready to start kindergarten right away
[1:40:20] other kids ripen later and they wait a
[1:40:22] year and they're just is just fine
[1:40:24] nothing wrong with them but they're
[1:40:26] individuals we are that way too don't
[1:40:29] impersonate someone else's experience
[1:40:31] now I want to share with you a couple of
[1:40:33] little video clips from um the last day
[1:40:36] of school some years back and we had a
[1:40:37] brother come in and he was did an
[1:40:40] interactive activity he's a dangerous
[1:40:42] brother to ask because he likes to use
[1:40:43] eggs as object lessons and raw
[1:40:48] eggs as object lessons um that little
[1:40:51] kid just love it but he said hey come on
[1:40:54] up here and I will let you crack an egg
[1:40:57] on your head like yeah can I do it can I
[1:41:00] do it yeah so so they do that they
[1:41:02] little kids come up and they just they
[1:41:03] get to hold the egg on and whack and I
[1:41:06] mean everybody got to have a chance and
[1:41:08] I just wanted to take this is a little
[1:41:10] guy this is little Marcus I think he was
[1:41:11] probably first grade when this happened
[1:41:13] here let's just take a look at Marcus
[1:41:20] here there's actually sound on this too
[1:41:23] is there way to get sound on here no
[1:41:24] it's okay but he just let's look at that
[1:41:26] again he just that's wrong way wrong
[1:41:30] way there he goes he's got he's got
[1:41:33] it whack yeah it was it it was great and
[1:41:37] uh he would never be allowed to do this
[1:41:39] at home he could do this at do this at
[1:41:41] school so each one of the seniors got to
[1:41:43] come up and do it and finally U there
[1:41:45] was one senior who absolutely refused to
[1:41:47] do it and she got to nominate somebody
[1:41:49] to take her place and that was me so I
[1:41:52] got to have the experence exp erience
[1:41:53] with the egg myself too and it was a I
[1:41:56] got I got egg on my face as well there
[1:42:00] was one guy uh Levi here who had an
[1:42:03] experience with the egg that was
[1:42:05] matchless nobody could match this
[1:42:08] experience let's just take a look at his
[1:42:09] experience with the egg a
[1:42:12] minute look at it wind up wind
[1:42:16] up that egg it flew all over the place
[1:42:22] cuz he had his hands cassed a certain
[1:42:24] way that nothing could come out through
[1:42:26] his fingers it went it went it went on
[1:42:28] the podium behind it almost got to the
[1:42:30] American flag I mean it was an
[1:42:32] incredible experience and everybody was
[1:42:35] jealous of Levi's experience after that
[1:42:38] because they one of his friends gets up
[1:42:41] yeah that's it was bad one of his
[1:42:43] friends gets up and he's going to go and
[1:42:44] do it afterwards and he gets ready he's
[1:42:46] holding the exact same way and whack but
[1:42:49] it was different it didn't work out the
[1:42:51] way they was Levi and as I was watching
[1:42:54] this man this is really neat because
[1:42:56] every single person will have an
[1:42:59] experience with the egg every single
[1:43:01] person who comes up gets an egg in their
[1:43:03] hands we had a one of our seniors was
[1:43:05] kind of a cautious guy no I wouldn't
[1:43:08] call him timid that's I wouldn't call a
[1:43:10] guy timid but he's just a little
[1:43:11] cautious little reserved and he just
[1:43:12] takes egg and goes whack but he got egg
[1:43:15] on his face still he had an experience
[1:43:17] with the egg that was his own experience
[1:43:20] with the egg every single person had a
[1:43:23] different experience each one of you
[1:43:25] will have a different experience with
[1:43:27] God nobody else will match it you just
[1:43:31] value your own experience because as
[1:43:33] soon as I oh man my with the egg was so
[1:43:36] inferior to his experience hold up and
[1:43:39] here the egg is symbolizing your
[1:43:40] experience with God no experience with
[1:43:43] God is inferior God Almighty creator of
[1:43:46] the universe he comes into your life it
[1:43:49] wants to know you personally comes meets
[1:43:51] you personally if the details of your
[1:43:54] meeting were different than the details
[1:43:55] of of your meeting who cares you still
[1:43:59] had a moment with God so nobody's
[1:44:02] experience is inferior to anybody else's
[1:44:04] experience we can just Rejoice I had an
[1:44:07] experience with God that's amazing it's
[1:44:10] amazing and uh it was uh it was messy
[1:44:13] too but uh it was it was still a great
[1:44:16] thing don't impersonate anybody else's
[1:44:18] experience brother brandom asked the
[1:44:20] question so what's caused the misunder
[1:44:23] understanding what's caused the
[1:44:25] confusion he says the answer is
[1:44:28] experience we've gone by experience and
[1:44:31] not the word away with experience as
[1:44:32] your measuring line there's only one
[1:44:34] Plum line one rod and that is the
[1:44:40] word in the message from that time
[1:44:42] brother Brandon says I believe that a
[1:44:44] man comes to God and everyone has a
[1:44:47] definite experience oh maybe you think
[1:44:49] I'm beside myself but look I don't mean
[1:44:51] an impersonation of an experience
[1:44:53] we've got so much of that today till it
[1:44:55] makes a real Christian sick to look at
[1:44:56] it somebody trying to impersonate
[1:44:58] somebody else God is never made to the
[1:45:01] same he never did and he never will
[1:45:02] God's the god of variety he makes big
[1:45:05] Hills little Hills deserts swamp lands
[1:45:07] what more he's a god of variety don't
[1:45:10] try to impersonate anyone else be what
[1:45:14] you are and what God made
[1:45:16] you so when we try to copy someone
[1:45:20] else's experience we don't mean anything
[1:45:22] better by that but what we're doing is
[1:45:24] we're pushing ourselves into something
[1:45:27] that's a sovereign work of God we're
[1:45:29] humanizing the work of God and our
[1:45:32] well-intended efforts will just only
[1:45:34] frustrate the grace of God Galatians
[1:45:38] Chapter 2 Paul says I'm crucified with
[1:45:40] Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but
[1:45:43] it's Christ who lives in
[1:45:46] me who lives the Christian life you
[1:45:50] don't it's Christ that lives in me the
[1:45:54] life which I know Live In the Flesh I
[1:45:56] live by the faith of the Son of God
[1:45:58] whose faith is it it's not your faith
[1:46:01] faith is a gift of God You Only Live the
[1:46:04] Christian Life by his faith living it
[1:46:06] out through you I live by the faith of
[1:46:09] the Son of God who loved me and gave
[1:46:11] himself for me I do not frustrate the
[1:46:13] grace of God for if righteousness came
[1:46:15] by the law then Christ is dead in vain
[1:46:19] who lives the Christian Life if Christ
[1:46:21] is in the human heart he will certainly
[1:46:23] live his own life for Christ is in you
[1:46:26] when Christ the Holy Spirit comes to
[1:46:28] your heart he is in you with your
[1:46:32] temperament there are some parts of our
[1:46:33] temperament that we would like to
[1:46:36] change but some parts just might be God
[1:46:39] expressing himself a certain way and we
[1:46:41] just need to yield that to
[1:46:44] him he's living his own life through his
[1:46:48] own will through
[1:46:51] you the holy spirit is such a definite
[1:46:53] must in this day because he is the one
[1:46:56] that lives your life you don't live it
[1:47:01] yourself so we just relax rest and let
[1:47:05] him live through
[1:47:07] us the new birth doesn't depend upon us
[1:47:12] but upon the seed of God swn within us
[1:47:15] and the sacrifice sacrifice Christ paid
[1:47:17] for us Acts chapter 13 when the Gentiles
[1:47:20] heard the gospel they were glad and
[1:47:22] glorified the word the
[1:47:23] Lord and as many as were ordained to
[1:47:27] eternal life
[1:47:30] believed ordained to eternal life or the
[1:47:32] foundation of the world that comes
[1:47:34] forever any Works happen they who were
[1:47:38] ordained could believe it's not they
[1:47:41] believed and therefore were ordained but
[1:47:42] no the the work of God depends
[1:47:44] completely upon the seed that is sewn
[1:47:47] within us from before the foundation of
[1:47:49] the word
[1:47:50] world now as we close going to take one
[1:47:53] more example because we've looked at um
[1:47:56] how we can't impersonate somebody else's
[1:47:58] experience we we shouldn't aim for
[1:48:00] particular experience we should just aim
[1:48:01] for Christ we've talked about even the
[1:48:03] how we um the the the truest evidence is
[1:48:07] hearing the word for your day but there
[1:48:09] could be things that we don't quite
[1:48:11] understand when it's being taught but we
[1:48:12] still understand there's something to be
[1:48:13] understood but you can see that there's
[1:48:15] a space there for the devil to se
[1:48:18] confusion and we also talking about a
[1:48:21] certain level of perfection we we
[1:48:22] shouldn't aim for that we just want to
[1:48:24] aim for Christ in each one of those
[1:48:26] areas there's places where the devil can
[1:48:28] SE confusion now I want to talk about
[1:48:30] this area we know a Christian Life needs
[1:48:33] to be a certain level that's how we
[1:48:35] think we want to be like Christ to be
[1:48:37] like
[1:48:38] Jesus and we know when we mess up and
[1:48:41] when we fail when we think we failed man
[1:48:44] I have failed too
[1:48:46] much um I'm uh
[1:48:49] goner and brother brandom takes this uh
[1:48:53] point in the question answers in 1954 he
[1:48:55] says on backsliding I wish somebody
[1:48:59] would ask me
[1:49:00] that because that's a tough topic every
[1:49:04] single day we know the mistakes that we
[1:49:06] make and the devil's going to be
[1:49:08] whispering our ear we're going to be
[1:49:09] putting ourselves outside of God's grace
[1:49:12] pretty quickly because we see our own
[1:49:15] weaknesses he says remember uh you
[1:49:18] backside every single day there's no way
[1:49:20] at all for you to keep out of it wow he
[1:49:24] says that pretty
[1:49:25] plain looking at a picture of a little
[1:49:27] cocko bur here how can I take a cocko
[1:49:29] bur and make a grain of wheat out of it
[1:49:31] it's impossible for me to do it the only
[1:49:34] way it can be is because inside that
[1:49:37] Cocker has been transmitted from a
[1:49:39] Cocker to a germ called wheat life so if
[1:49:41] you were to take that that that Cocker
[1:49:44] just cut it off cut it open and put a
[1:49:46] wheat seed inside and and plant it the
[1:49:49] cocko will be outside that wheat seed
[1:49:51] that wheat seed will just go out and
[1:49:53] explode through there you bury the cocko
[1:49:56] bur it'll produce a grain of wheat if
[1:49:57] it's got grain of wheat inside it
[1:49:59] because there's been that put put in
[1:50:00] there and the life of the Cocker has
[1:50:02] been taken out but the nature of the
[1:50:03] Cocker is still
[1:50:07] sticky and as long as you're in this
[1:50:10] life can we say that together as long as
[1:50:13] you're in this life you're going to be
[1:50:17] sticky I'm going to be sticky we're both
[1:50:19] going to be sticky we're going to have a
[1:50:21] carnal nature that's going to bother you
[1:50:23] bother your wife bother your kids as
[1:50:26] long as you live I don't know if you
[1:50:29] guys you other spouses have conversation
[1:50:31] with with your with your husband or wife
[1:50:33] how long have we been married you know
[1:50:35] this about me and you still do this say
[1:50:37] I'm sorry hun I'm sorry but I I'll work
[1:50:40] on it we're do better but you know what
[1:50:42] as long as we're in this life together
[1:50:44] there's going to be things that just
[1:50:44] kind of go like this that's the
[1:50:46] conversation we have at home from time
[1:50:48] to
[1:50:49] time but the inside of you you're born
[1:50:52] again and when you're raised up you're
[1:50:54] in the likeness of Christ and all the
[1:50:56] sin is gone from you as long as you're
[1:50:59] in this life inside of you so that
[1:51:01] Cocker is dead but in but you've still
[1:51:04] got that nature there but inside of you
[1:51:06] that Cocker's planted wheat is going to
[1:51:09] come forth and brother brandom talks
[1:51:12] about in one message um he had two
[1:51:15] servers he mentions backsliding a little
[1:51:17] bit in both services and he talks about
[1:51:18] one thing that he says he has a weakness
[1:51:20] on and you think man I wish I had that
[1:51:21] weakness that's not such a bad weakness
[1:51:23] to have he said I just joke around too
[1:51:25] much and I I should be a little bit more
[1:51:27] more sober minded sometimes and he says
[1:51:30] as a reminder I think a good thing you
[1:51:32] ought to set on your desk to keep me a
[1:51:34] little more sober minded It's those
[1:51:36] three little monkeys one of them with
[1:51:39] his hands over his eyes See No Evil Hear
[1:51:42] no evil speak no evil if I could just
[1:51:44] have that on my desk and actually do it
[1:51:47] I'd be a lot more spiritual is what he
[1:51:49] says he says just keep your mind pure
[1:51:51] and on Christ
[1:51:53] you can't just say well now if you don't
[1:51:57] watch you'll get yourself over into a
[1:51:59] place and you keep on thinking I can do
[1:52:01] this that's kind of what he's saying
[1:52:03] here if you if you can just with this
[1:52:05] with the help of this little figurine
[1:52:07] I'll work better and not hearing any
[1:52:09] evil seeing any evil speaking I'll just
[1:52:11] work better he says careful just keep
[1:52:13] your mind p on Christ you can't just say
[1:52:15] well now I think he's expressing if you
[1:52:17] just do work hard it'll be all right he
[1:52:19] say no if you don't watch you'll get
[1:52:21] yourself over into a a place if you keep
[1:52:23] on thinking that don't think that don't
[1:52:27] think
[1:52:28] that you can't live so perfect so you
[1:52:31] don't make that mistake now so don't
[1:52:34] think you'll ever get that way because
[1:52:36] you won't you're not sinless and you'll
[1:52:39] certainly get off on their track on this
[1:52:41] side or on that side and I wanted to
[1:52:43] show an example of this just to show how
[1:52:47] how easy it is to make mistakes and how
[1:52:49] secure we can be even when there are
[1:52:51] mistakes and to do this I'm going to
[1:52:53] need a little help as as we're kind of
[1:52:55] closing up
[1:52:56] here could you blow one of these up for
[1:52:58] me yeah blow one of these up too just

[1:54:09] please what is going to happen to this
[1:54:11] balloon or to our brother turn around so
[1:54:14] that they can see a better face than
[1:54:15] mine on the video what's going to happen
[1:54:18] to this brother when he faces the trials
[1:54:20] of life if there's nothing on the side
[1:54:23] to help him out here if the fire alarm
[1:54:24] goes off there's only this fire here
[1:54:26] what's going to
[1:54:30] happen there's no keeping power there he
[1:54:34] can work hard as he wants to but it's
[1:54:35] not going to it's not going to help him
[1:54:37] out we can say hey somebody else say I'm
[1:54:39] better than him because I'm a I'm a
[1:54:41] pastor's kid so maybe maybe he'll be
[1:54:43] better off and uh as this he's worked
[1:54:46] his he's worked his way out he's even
[1:54:48] gotten he's even gotten counseling and
[1:54:51] uh helping all these things he's
[1:54:52] approaching himself with only his own
[1:54:55] strength nothing from God on the inside
[1:54:57] trial comes what's going to happen to
[1:55:00] our
[1:55:01] brother po he's done it's not going to

[1:55:29] this I'm going to give you a
[1:55:31] balloon now we might start thinking

[1:55:38] things so get as much water as you can
[1:55:41] into the
[1:55:42] balloon blow it up this is a tough thing
[1:55:46] I've got two guys working together see
[1:55:47] what you can

[1:55:51] this is tricky
[1:55:52] this is
[1:55:53] tricky wow they're going to work
[1:55:55] together on this so they're going to try
[1:55:58] to get in a good atmosphere getting
[1:56:01] right things things like this and if
[1:56:04] there's an accident I've got a towel
[1:56:05] that's all right you want to get as much
[1:56:08] water in there as possible this is like
[1:56:10] you're going to the right places you're
[1:56:12] uh you're seeing the right uh singing
[1:56:14] the right songs good Godly Christian

[1:56:19] your life in some way they've worked
[1:56:21] together very good very
[1:56:23] good is it going to work for
[1:56:26] them he can blow blow things up pretty
[1:56:29] well very
[1:56:31] good can you get any more water in
[1:56:35] there this is always interesting
[1:56:39] one is there water in
[1:56:42] there let's hear let's he is there a
[1:56:44] little water in
[1:56:46] there there's some water in there we'll
[1:56:49] give it a shot give it a shot and let's
[1:56:51] see
[1:56:53] you want to hold
[1:56:54] [Laughter]
[1:57:00] it I think he just threw you under the
[1:57:03] bus okay so let's see if this goes any
[1:57:15] different hey wow this is working just
[1:57:19] fine but all of a sudden
[1:57:22] I am so sorry brother I am so sorry God
[1:57:26] bless you God bless you very good very
[1:57:30] good thank you thank you guys thank you
[1:57:34] what happened there we're getting as
[1:57:36] much water into our lives much of the
[1:57:38] Holy Spirit much of God's word into our
[1:57:40] lives by being in the right place going
[1:57:43] to youth meetings like that and we're
[1:57:44] getting things into us and getting the
[1:57:46] right things into us do help us to avoid
[1:57:50] problems that other people might have
[1:57:51] that have no knowledge of God
[1:57:53] whatsoever these guys lasted longer but
[1:57:56] there's not enough there to really make
[1:58:00] a sustaining power these guys it was a
[1:58:02] work of the flesh all the way figuring
[1:58:04] out how can I get more water into me
[1:58:06] they blowing water blood and Tien up the
[1:58:09] work of the flesh all the way and their
[1:58:12] work was better than their work but that
[1:58:15] didn't pass the fire test ultimately and
[1:58:18] now we're talking remember about
[1:58:20] backsliding
[1:58:23] okay can I have a volunteer
[1:58:25] here yeah okay
[1:58:28] okay you think it's safe to volunteer
[1:58:35] now that's not every service I get to
[1:58:38] bring a nice water balloon in here so
[1:58:41] brother we are friends we don't throw
[1:58:43] the water balloon at each other we're
[1:58:45] we're good we're good Brothers very good
[1:58:46] okay you just hold this for me just hold
[1:58:48] it up at the top like that yeah very
[1:58:50] good now
[1:58:53] so this is a different what do you
[1:58:56] think's going to happen to this
[1:58:58] one I mean if it pops let's walk a
[1:59:01] little closer to the sisters so in case
[1:59:03] it pops we have a little more very good
[1:59:06] very good we'll just stay right here
[1:59:07] we'll just stay right here yeah that's
[1:59:08] all right yeah this is the
[1:59:10] one let's see what's going to happen to
[1:59:13] this
[1:59:20] balloon I can't hope hold it much
[1:59:23] longer what happened
[1:59:26] absolutely nothing happened nothing
[1:59:30] nothing happened you can see the
[1:59:33] evidence that this person got a little
[1:59:35] too close to the fire you can see that
[1:59:38] they got too close to the fire I mean
[1:59:40] and this is to me is an example of what
[1:59:42] it's like when a holy ghost filled
[1:59:45] believer does something
[1:59:47] wrong I've messed up and you can see
[1:59:50] I've got a scar there
[1:59:52] but God kept me there's no
[2:00:04] way there's no way that the work of the
[2:00:07] flesh could have kept me God kept me and
[2:00:11] you know what I'm kind of embarrassed
[2:00:13] about my scars here I'll I'll I'll I'll
[2:00:16] repent before the Lord I'll get my water
[2:00:18] bottle out here of of of of God's word
[2:00:20] would you open this for me
[2:00:23] yeah get yeah we'll just kind
[2:00:27] of there we good that we're just going
[2:00:29] to we're just going to let God clean
[2:00:31] clean clean me up we're going to do this
[2:00:34] and you can see I need a couple tissues
[2:00:36] here we can see you know what God's
[2:00:39] grace is great I'm getting cleaned up
[2:00:41] I've gotten Too
[2:00:50] Close we've gotten too close to the fire
[2:00:53] I've messed up how many of us have gone
[2:00:56] too far done things that we're just
[2:00:57] completely ashamed I said Lord How Could
[2:01:00] You Lord but you know what are you still
[2:01:03] alive I have a there's that desire for
[2:01:06] God is still pumping there's still life
[2:01:09] there yes thank you Lord and I'm ashamed
[2:01:12] I go forward I Repent before the Lord
[2:01:15] and He I more than I listen to his word
[2:01:17] and he just wipes me clean wipes me
[2:01:20] clean that to me is what this is what
[2:01:23] what it's being talked about
[2:01:26] here grieve not the holy spirit of God
[2:01:29] whereby your sealed unto the day of your
[2:01:31] Redemption what's the difference between
[2:01:33] this nice big water
[2:01:34] balloon this was not a work of man I had
[2:01:37] to get this attached to brother Sam's
[2:01:40] faucet back there and there had to be a
[2:01:42] power much stronger than the power of
[2:01:44] gravity in that bottle I had the holy
[2:01:47] spirit's power through the plum got to
[2:01:49] fill this up that's the difference you
[2:01:52] didn't have enough power to fill up with
[2:01:54] your own power Your Own Strength but
[2:01:55] you're sealed there the work of God
[2:01:57] sealed to the day of your Redemption not
[2:02:00] to the next Revival you weren't sealed
[2:02:02] that's just your emotionally being
[2:02:03] worked up but you're dead your life's
[2:02:05] hid in God through Christ you're sealed
[2:02:07] by the Holy Ghost if you were once
[2:02:09] baptized into that Holy Spirit now you
[2:02:12] can backslide that's true we saw that
[2:02:16] but I'm sealed and it didn't pop you
[2:02:19] can't get away from that seal
[2:02:28] amen and this is what Jude is talking
[2:02:31] about now this one other thing and the
[2:02:34] questions and answers brother Brandon
[2:02:35] says you're saved I'm so glad to know
[2:02:37] that Christ saves us we may backslide we
[2:02:40] may do wrong we all have our ups and
[2:02:43] downs but in your soul as soon as you do
[2:02:46] anything well there's something goes
[2:02:47] wrong in
[2:02:48] you that's the greatest sign there is
[2:02:51] your heart can be grieved by something
[2:02:54] that that you've done
[2:02:57] amen John uh Jude 24 and no unto him
[2:03:01] that is able to keep you from
[2:03:04] falling now we all have ups and downs
[2:03:07] that's part of the Christian Life the
[2:03:09] one who's able to keep you from falling
[2:03:11] and staying in that Fallen State God
[2:03:14] does that he's able to keep us from
[2:03:17] falling and to present us faultless
[2:03:20] before the presence of God of his glory
[2:03:22] with exceeding Joy proverb says a just
[2:03:25] man falls seven times yet Rises up
[2:03:29] again but the wicked will fall into
[2:03:32] Mischief the wicked will fall into
[2:03:35] fallenness but a just man will fall we
[2:03:39] can all say yes I've fallen but by God's
[2:03:41] grace he has made me just he has made me
[2:03:43] righteous so a Christian you almost say
[2:03:46] he falls
[2:03:47] forward because after we've Fallen we
[2:03:50] arise by God's grace strengthened again
[2:03:53] and growing in Grace we don't fall into
[2:03:56] Mischief or further
[2:03:59] fallenness so is the Christian Life that
[2:04:02] Cliffhanger
[2:04:04] experience it's not it's not we could
[2:04:07] even if we make a mistake and get close
[2:04:09] to the fire we're sealed by his Spirit
[2:04:12] within us we are safe and now we can
[2:04:15] just rest in the Holy Ghost he will he
[2:04:20] will keep us he start of the work he
[2:04:23] will finish the work and this person
[2:04:25] there they're not hanging on to anything
[2:04:27] they're completely
[2:04:30] resting in the rigging and we are
[2:04:33] resting in the work of the Holy Spirit
[2:04:36] In Our Lives amen let's
[2:04:43] pray Lord Jesus it's so wonderful father
[2:04:47] to see what you have done for us in the
[2:04:50] power of your work our best attempts
[2:04:54] just pale in comparison to what you have
