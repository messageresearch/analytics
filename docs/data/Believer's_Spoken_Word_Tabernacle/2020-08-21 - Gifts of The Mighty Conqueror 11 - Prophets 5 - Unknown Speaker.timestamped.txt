[37:40] line up lifted hand
[37:44] oh lord jesus heavenly father
[37:50] lord as we've come here lord tonight and
[37:53] gathered in lord this little place that
[37:56] you've given us lord that
[37:58] we could come and meet lord
[38:02] your god to preach and to hear your word
[38:06] lord to see you transform our lives
[38:09] and change us lord dear god
[38:13] we thank you for your mercy
[38:16] lord we are witnesses dear god
[38:20] of the redeeming power of almighty god
[38:24] and lord jesus there's needs that's here
[38:27] tonight lord
[38:28] lord i know perhaps sometimes even when
[38:31] a text is
[38:32] read it might seem like lord that
[38:35] that how is my need going to be met
[38:38] but lord we realize lord god that you
[38:41] are the word lord god you're able to
[38:45] take control
[38:46] and so direct lord god that gift that
[38:50] you place in that life
[38:52] to minister lord to our needs
[38:55] lord we've come here tonight because we
[38:57] want to have a meeting with you
[39:00] you're the one that we want to see it's
[39:03] your garment that we want to touch the
[39:04] hymn of lord god
[39:06] and we pray tonight lord that for every
[39:08] one of these needs
[39:10] there's not one of them lord that's
[39:12] beyond your reach
[39:14] you're the almighty god lord so we just
[39:17] lord tonight just take every one of
[39:19] these needs
[39:20] we place him lord upon the altar of god
[39:23] and lord god we
[39:24] call father lord jesus those things
[39:28] that are not as though they are those
[39:31] things that are
[39:32] as though they are not lord we're
[39:34] looking to you who made the promise
[39:36] lord if we were just looking at the
[39:38] promise lord god
[39:40] well lord god we could be a little shaky
[39:42] but when we're looking to the god who
[39:44] made the promise
[39:46] then lord god we can rest upon you
[39:49] that's what your prophet told us he said
[39:51] abraham was not looking so much at the
[39:53] promise
[39:54] as he was to the god who gave it lord we
[39:57] just ask tonight
[39:58] that may you just come among us in a
[40:00] real special way
[40:02] those that are gathered around lord in
[40:04] their homes and streaming
[40:06] lord many of the different needs father
[40:09] lord we're looking to you
[40:10] lord day by day in our lives lord you're
[40:13] our protection lord
[40:15] we ask that you would just god and
[40:16] direct us lord by your holy spirit now
[40:19] lord
[40:20] in your word we pray in the name of
[40:22] jesus christ
[40:24] amen amen god bless you tonight
[40:28] so good to be back in the house of the
[40:30] lord amen
[40:32] um i want to if we could
[40:35] let's just let's go right into
[40:39] the scripture here into first samuel
[40:41] chapter 3
[40:43] verse 1.
[40:46] and while you're turning there
[40:49] just to remember as we've been
[40:52] looking at here with that on prophets
[40:56] gifts from the mighty conqueror and
[40:59] looking at that from the new testament
[41:02] where
[41:03] god would make clear the apostle paul
[41:07] he has given some apostles
[41:10] some prophets some evangelists some
[41:12] pastors and some teachers
[41:15] and we read here in the scripture in
[41:18] first samuel
[41:19] 3 1. and remember as we're reading this
[41:22] that the word prophet itself
[41:26] it just it it deals with preaching
[41:29] and and under divine inspiration but the
[41:33] difference is is how that god
[41:35] has placed it that truly every prophet
[41:38] or every preacher
[41:39] would be a prophet but to see that when
[41:42] god
[41:43] has ordained that there are major
[41:46] prophets
[41:46] that are to come and they're just not
[41:48] preachers
[41:50] they have the word of the lord
[41:53] for that generation and so
[41:56] we recognize that within that that god
[41:59] would make clear
[42:00] even in this hour that our prophet
[42:03] himself
[42:04] is not just a preacher but it is as the
[42:07] old testament would also say
[42:09] a seer and it would be one who would be
[42:13] given the word of the lord
[42:16] to to interpret that word it's not the
[42:20] man's interpretation
[42:21] it's god's interpretation you might look
[42:24] at it and i don't mean to keep you
[42:26] standing but you might look at it and
[42:28] the thought could say well we have the
[42:30] bible
[42:31] that's the word of the lord that's true
[42:34] israel had the bible they had the
[42:37] written word
[42:38] but what happened they got off track
[42:41] because they didn't have the word of the
[42:42] lord
[42:44] you see it's something that lifts us
[42:46] beyond the interpretation of man and
[42:48] brings us back
[42:49] into contact with god
[42:52] that's why god sends a prophet first
[42:55] samuel chapter three verse one
[42:57] and the child samuel ministered unto the
[42:59] lord before eli
[43:01] and the word of the lord was precious
[43:04] that means it was
[43:06] valued it was prized because
[43:09] of such a rarity when something is
[43:11] something
[43:12] is rare it's precious
[43:15] right it has a great great valuable
[43:17] price on it and look at this
[43:19] it was precious in those days there was
[43:22] no
[43:23] open vision well what's a hope and
[43:27] vision
[43:28] it's when god's word is revealed
[43:31] and god reveals his word to his prophets
[43:36] and when god reveals that word to his
[43:37] prophets there is a people
[43:40] in whom that word is intended for
[43:44] there's a people who's going to receive
[43:45] that word amen god bless you bless the
[43:48] reading of the word as you're being
[43:49] seated tonight
[43:50] i want to just continue with that on how
[43:53] the word of the lord is coming to that
[43:56] of a prophet and we i don't want to
[43:59] review
[44:00] so much even from last week and just
[44:02] trusting whether you were here or not
[44:04] that you're staying in continuity with
[44:06] the services and how that we've been
[44:09] looking at them
[44:10] and how that god even
[44:13] in in this time god would send
[44:16] a prophet according to his word and it
[44:20] would restore us
[44:21] back into back to the word of the lord
[44:24] and we see in genesis 15
[44:25] 1 it says after these things the word of
[44:28] the lord came unto abram in a vision
[44:31] saying notice the word of the lord comes
[44:33] in a vision
[44:35] fear not abram i am thy shield and
[44:38] i exceeding great reward
[44:41] so when god reveals his word remember
[44:44] when the lord jesus was
[44:46] walking here upon earth and here it was
[44:50] the life of the lord jesus was
[44:53] and not only come for redemption
[44:56] god came down and so condescended to
[45:00] understand us but it was also a divine
[45:04] expression
[45:05] of what was lost in the first adam
[45:08] the second adam was coming to restore
[45:12] so redemption is to bring back and it is
[45:16] to restore
[45:17] to what has been fallen from wherein
[45:20] that as brother brown would make it
[45:22] so clear and use these words it is that
[45:26] word image that they fell from
[45:29] which is the image of the living god
[45:32] dwelling
[45:33] behind the image of man
[45:36] so how that the word of the lord would
[45:38] come to abraham by
[45:40] a vision and the scripture goes on to
[45:43] say
[45:44] in first samuel 3 19 and samuel
[45:47] grew and the lord was with him and
[45:50] didn't let none of his words fall to the
[45:52] ground now think of it
[45:53] eli was the priest in that hour but the
[45:56] word didn't come to the priest
[45:59] they had got off the mark and israel was
[46:02] going and going but yet
[46:03] the word of the lord god's mercy god
[46:06] sends a prophet remember
[46:08] a prophet is not only a sign of judgment
[46:10] but the prophet
[46:11] also within that there is a people who
[46:14] find the mercy of almighty god
[46:17] their hearts are touched and are moved
[46:20] in repentance to come back in line with
[46:22] god's word
[46:23] as a matter of fact there is a longing
[46:25] within the heart
[46:26] of the believer to be lined up with the
[46:30] word
[46:30] it's something that the believer can't
[46:32] even explain or even be able to
[46:35] put into words it's something that they
[46:37] can't find ground
[46:38] to stand on but yet maybe they're
[46:40] walking in a church
[46:42] and they're you know thankful for the
[46:43] salvation of the lord but there's a
[46:45] longing in their heart
[46:46] for something more what that is that's a
[46:49] deep that's calling to the deep
[46:51] there's a desire for that seed that god
[46:53] placed on the inside
[46:55] for that to come into expression and
[46:58] there's only one that can bring that
[46:59] into expression
[47:00] and that's the very god himself in whom
[47:03] that seed is from
[47:06] so to find that the word of the lord it
[47:08] will not come to
[47:10] eli but it would come to samuel god
[47:13] had built and prepared samuel to receive
[47:16] the word of the lord
[47:17] and the bible said that he did not let
[47:19] any of his words
[47:21] fall to the ground and all israel from
[47:24] dan
[47:25] even to beersheba knew that samuel was
[47:28] established to be a
[47:30] prophet of the lord now here's the thing
[47:34] they knew that that yet that of the
[47:36] world
[47:38] came among israel and they began to look
[47:41] after other things
[47:43] they wanted a king like the rest of the
[47:46] nations
[47:47] yet they knew you see this is why just
[47:50] knowing that it's the prophet of the
[47:52] lord is not enough
[47:55] it's to where that word is so moved in
[47:57] that heart
[47:58] that it turns the heart to a place that
[48:01] there's
[48:01] no other attraction of the world
[48:05] that holds any interest or any value
[48:08] it's where jesus christ has become the
[48:11] center of that life he becomes the all
[48:14] in
[48:15] all to that life just simply put he
[48:17] everything else
[48:18] you sell out because of jesus christ
[48:25] and the lord appeared again in shiloh
[48:28] for the lord
[48:29] revealed himself to samuel in china by
[48:34] the word of the lord so how does he
[48:36] reveal himself to his prophets
[48:38] by the word of the lord this is not just
[48:41] this is not just some oh i received a
[48:43] visitation
[48:44] you know of of of the spirit of god and
[48:46] this is what he said to
[48:48] me does it dovetail with the word
[48:51] i don't care how inspired it seems how
[48:53] anointed it seems
[48:54] i don't care how it might make your hair
[48:56] stand up on the back of your neck
[48:58] does it dovetail with or hair if it
[49:01] doesn't dovetail with the word it's a
[49:03] lying spirit amen
[49:06] that's where look 400 were anointed
[49:09] standing there
[49:10] before jehoshaphat and ahab 400.
[49:14] the spirit of the if we look at it
[49:16] brother the anointing was
[49:17] thick there that day amen come on now
[49:20] the anointing was fit but here stands
[49:23] one
[49:24] micah he's not popular but he has
[49:27] the word of the lord what he has seen
[49:31] god has let him know and it ties right
[49:34] in
[49:34] with that word that god gave to elijah
[49:37] that announced the oncoming judgment on
[49:40] the house of ahab
[49:42] it dovetails with the word amen
[49:46] so here we find this how that the word
[49:50] of the lord
[49:52] how it comes to the prophet and this is
[49:54] where we were i believe coming to here
[49:56] in the latter time and i just felt led
[49:58] to come back to this point and move
[50:00] forward here
[50:01] tonight because in the time a member of
[50:04] the judges
[50:05] the bible said every man walked or
[50:08] did whatever was right in his own eyes
[50:12] you know god doesn't want nobody just
[50:14] walking in according to whatever's right
[50:16] in their own eyes
[50:19] now they did not they have the law they
[50:21] had the law did not they have
[50:22] the writings of the prophets they did
[50:24] did not they have the songs
[50:26] there wasn't there other things that
[50:28] maybe we could say well they didn't have
[50:30] the songs at that time but you
[50:31] understand
[50:32] did not they have the that of even the
[50:34] writings and different things
[50:36] they did but what they what they were
[50:39] going about was according
[50:40] to their own thinking you know one of
[50:42] the biggest things that sometimes
[50:44] that you hear so much among people and
[50:46] they want to take this
[50:48] and cover their sin and say god
[50:50] understands
[50:51] let me just tell you something that's a
[50:53] lie from the devil
[50:54] he said that in the garden of eden at
[50:57] the very beginning oh god won't do this
[51:00] god won't do this god is a god of
[51:02] judgment he said what he meant and he
[51:04] meant what he said
[51:05] [Applause]
[51:07] if he does not stand on his word to
[51:09] bring judgment how can you accept his
[51:11] word of grace
[51:13] because grace itself is not blinded eyes
[51:16] but grace comes
[51:17] with transforming power to lift you
[51:20] from a condition that you're in into
[51:23] what god is calling you do that's grace
[51:26] [Music]
[51:28] hallelujah but we see that
[51:31] how god's mercy this is god's mercy
[51:34] samuel being sent to them when every man
[51:36] was walking what was right in his own
[51:38] eyes
[51:39] it now moves from a place to where
[51:41] calling them
[51:42] back to the word of the lord and you
[51:44] know what that brings it brings a walk
[51:45] of faith
[51:48] you can't walk by faith unless it's
[51:51] divinely revealed
[51:52] and when it's divinely revealed it's
[51:54] more than what you can explain
[51:56] but it's something that anchors within
[51:58] you you are anchored to
[51:59] it it doesn't mean it doesn't matter if
[52:02] you can explain it or not
[52:03] it's what faith is and it pulsates in
[52:05] your life
[52:06] yes amen amen i heard brother branham
[52:09] say here
[52:09] the here today unveiling of god how did
[52:12] those disciples he said it was faith
[52:14] that was anchored in the heart he said
[52:16] faith is that which even you can't
[52:18] explain
[52:19] but it's so anchored in your heart
[52:22] let me tell you it declares itself
[52:25] notice what jesus would say
[52:27] in john 10 34 he said is it not written
[52:31] in your law
[52:32] that i said you're god's if he called
[52:35] them
[52:35] gods unto whom the word of god
[52:38] came and the scripture cannot be broken
[52:43] say he of him whom the father hath
[52:46] sanctified and sent into the world thou
[52:49] blasphemous
[52:50] because i said i am the son of god you
[52:53] know what the lord jesus is letting him
[52:54] know
[52:55] you talk about prophets but you don't
[52:58] know what prophets are yeah
[53:01] you don't even recognize what they are
[53:03] prophets you call
[53:04] whom the word says whom the word comes
[53:07] to these are sons of god
[53:10] right these are gods meaning they had
[53:13] the word
[53:14] of god it wasn't their word it's god's
[53:16] word
[53:17] and god's word is a creative word god's
[53:21] word
[53:21] is a word of dominion and power and
[53:23] authority and glory
[53:25] amen this is what jesus is declaring you
[53:28] call them
[53:29] gods you see what it was they knew the
[53:31] history
[53:33] but they did not know the god they knew
[53:36] the history knew all about him he went
[53:38] here he did this
[53:38] moses did this moses did that they knew
[53:41] all the pathway
[53:42] of the history of moses but they didn't
[53:44] know the god of moses
[53:46] that's right are you hearing me you see
[53:50] he says if i do not the works of my
[53:52] father
[53:53] believe me not but if i do
[53:57] though you believe me not believe the
[53:58] works that you may know and believe that
[54:01] the father is in me
[54:03] and i in him he's letting them see
[54:06] beyond the veil because you could look
[54:08] at the outside valve
[54:10] look at these people these are the
[54:12] pharisees
[54:13] were individuals that was all about the
[54:16] outside
[54:18] preach somebody sometimes we made the
[54:21] token all about the outside
[54:24] i believe when you've got the token
[54:25] it'll make your dress right
[54:28] it'll make you want to live right it'll
[54:30] clean you up from the inside out
[54:33] come on now but sometimes we got all
[54:35] this on the outside and say
[54:37] my i see this and see that yep they got
[54:39] the token
[54:40] and yet it is not truly applying it in
[54:42] the right way
[54:46] jesus is letting it be known that on
[54:48] whom the word
[54:49] of god come to did any of these prophets
[54:51] ask
[54:52] oh god send the word to me let me be a
[54:55] prophet they didn't want to be a prophet
[54:57] they did not desire that let me just
[54:59] bring it on down as god is bringing a
[55:01] parallel here
[55:01] it was not you and i who was desiring
[55:04] god
[55:05] there was a call on the inside brother
[55:08] it was not you and i calling for the
[55:10] word but the word was calling to the
[55:13] word
[55:13] that was inside of your eye god knew
[55:16] when he said a word
[55:17] in this generation there would be a
[55:20] place that that word
[55:21] would find a resting place
[55:25] yes sir it was a call that was going out
[55:28] it's like they put a tag on one or
[55:31] sometimes they put a tag on those
[55:32] animals they want to trace their
[55:34] whereabouts let me just tell you
[55:35] something
[55:36] you had a seed in you you were a seed of
[55:38] god
[55:39] god never lost sight of you he knew
[55:41] exactly where you are
[55:42] you might have staggered from here
[55:44] staggered from there you might have been
[55:46] heaped up in all kinds of mess
[55:48] but he never lost sight of you amen
[55:52] hallelujah he knew exactly where you
[55:54] were
[55:55] and just like they have those arms that
[55:57] go out and they say oh it's walking up
[55:59] there on the mountain
[56:00] you can't even see it but there is that
[56:02] little ray or invisible wave
[56:04] that goes out and detects there's that
[56:06] mountain lion over there
[56:08] where oh you can't see it it's up there
[56:09] on the mountain walking
[56:11] just as god has sent a word and god
[56:14] sends that word
[56:15] and it detects there is seed in this
[56:17] generation
[56:18] even when you can't even believe that
[56:21] your seed
[56:22] and god would want anything to do with
[56:24] you but the overcoming power
[56:26] of this word brother it defeats it
[56:29] overthrows
[56:30] it casts out what is it it's perfect
[56:33] love
[56:33] god's word is at work to recover
[56:38] to recover
[56:44] when the word is revealed
[56:47] notice whom the word of the lord comes
[56:49] to it said you called them gods
[56:52] they spoke they spoke the word of god
[57:01] and i just think like god it's not going
[57:04] to rain
[57:05] till i call for it
[57:08] who gave him the authority to speak like
[57:10] that god did
[57:12] what gave him the authority the word
[57:14] came to him
[57:15] i have done this at thy word
[57:21] when god drops his word in your heart
[57:24] speak it
[57:26] are you with me speak it you claim it
[57:30] because god is giving that word to be
[57:33] spoken in that hour
[57:34] listen it's not to you to bring it to
[57:36] pass if god gave the way
[57:38] god will bring it to pass
[57:40] [Applause]
[57:42] what takes place in that life then as
[57:45] jesus is
[57:46] letting it be known the works the words
[57:49] begin to come out of that life oh i'm
[57:52] not talking about fruit baskets and
[57:55] serving in soup kitchens and all those
[57:57] other things
[57:58] that might be a wonderful thing to be
[58:00] neighborly but if that's what a soul is
[58:02] resting on that's religion
[58:05] salvation is a birth
[58:09] jesus never said you must serve in the
[58:11] soup kitchen he said you must be born
[58:13] again
[58:16] hallelujah so now here the revelation
[58:19] you see
[58:20] when it when the word is revealed
[58:23] it shows itself that that the word will
[58:26] act
[58:26] itself out through that life and that's
[58:29] what god did
[58:30] through the prophets and god did that
[58:32] through those
[58:33] who heard them now let's turn to ezekiel
[58:36] chapter 2 and let's look at this
[58:38] in ezekiel 1 or if you want to follow on
[58:40] the screen there that's fine
[58:42] and here is ezekiel remember ezekiel is
[58:45] a prophet
[58:46] that is that is going to prophesy
[58:50] during the time when they are in
[58:52] captivity in babylon
[58:54] they've already remembered jeremiah was
[58:56] prophesying beforehand
[58:58] isaiah was but now that they're in
[59:00] captivity look at the mercy of god
[59:02] god is wanting to keep before them this
[59:06] is what got you in here
[59:10] this is why you're here but he also puts
[59:14] before them
[59:15] time and time again the promise that god
[59:18] said i will restore him
[59:22] glory be to god
[59:26] you see the word has a way of letting us
[59:28] know where we are
[59:29] and where we need to be
[59:32] amen that's a real overcoming word that
[59:34] lets us know
[59:36] amen to connect the points you know
[59:38] anybody ever called you you know
[59:40] brother joey or somebody you know
[59:41] somebody would call you say i'm lost for
[59:43] what's the first thing you say
[59:44] where are you at
[59:48] but if on the other end of that phone
[59:49] they say i don't know we got problems
[59:53] right that's evident they're lost but
[59:55] you at least want to say okay now what's
[59:57] a clear landmark what
[59:59] what what's a sign what have you passed
[1:00:01] and what have you
[1:00:02] you started looking for things that
[1:00:04] hopefully will trigger
[1:00:05] in your mind where they're at and
[1:00:08] they're calling you
[1:00:10] because they know you're in the vicinity
[1:00:12] but somehow they got
[1:00:14] off track right right right
[1:00:17] that is the mercy of god for our lives
[1:00:21] spiritually hallelujah i know you're in
[1:00:24] the vicinity but god's grace is to let
[1:00:27] you know
[1:00:28] the pathway home
[1:00:31] ezekiel 2 verse 1 and he said unto me
[1:00:34] son of man this is prophet this is where
[1:00:36] you see
[1:00:37] when son of man it refers to prophet
[1:00:40] stand upon thy feet and i will speak
[1:00:43] unto thee
[1:00:44] and the spirit entered into me when
[1:00:48] he spake unto me and set me upon my feet
[1:00:52] then i heard him that spake unto me
[1:00:55] notice
[1:00:56] the spirit entered when he spake
[1:00:59] jesus said my words are spirit and life
[1:01:02] the bible said in cornelius house why
[1:01:05] peter yet
[1:01:06] spake these words the holy ghost fell
[1:01:08] amen
[1:01:10] we find where paul will lay hands on him
[1:01:12] and the holy ghost come
[1:01:13] here's the thing the holy ghost comes
[1:01:16] according to the word
[1:01:18] amen he will always come to the word
[1:01:21] amen you're going to receive it whether
[1:01:23] you don't have to be standing here
[1:01:25] you're gonna be sitting right there you
[1:01:27] can be right at your house you can be
[1:01:29] right at your home
[1:01:30] you see the promise is certain because
[1:01:33] god
[1:01:34] gave the promise
[1:01:39] oh now i love that my we could just
[1:01:41] spend time on that part of it but let's
[1:01:43] go on
[1:01:44] and he sat unto me verse three son of
[1:01:46] man
[1:01:47] i send thee to the children of israel to
[1:01:50] a rebellious nation that hath rebelled
[1:01:52] against me
[1:01:55] my my my what love hello somebody
[1:02:00] somebody rebelled against you know me or
[1:02:02] you let's just be honest
[1:02:03] our flesh would not be wanting to go to
[1:02:05] him
[1:02:07] well thank goodness brother jerry was
[1:02:08] here and preached that feeling on gopo
[1:02:10] come on somebody
[1:02:13] oh my he said son of man i send thee to
[1:02:16] the children of israel
[1:02:17] to a rebellious nation that hath
[1:02:19] rebelled against me
[1:02:20] they and their fathers have transgressed
[1:02:23] against me
[1:02:24] even unto this very day for they are
[1:02:26] impudent children and stiff-hearted
[1:02:29] i do send thee unto them and thou shalt
[1:02:31] say unto them
[1:02:32] thus saith the lord god and they whether
[1:02:35] they will hear
[1:02:36] or whether they will forbear for their
[1:02:38] rebellious house
[1:02:40] yet shall they know that there hath been
[1:02:42] a prophet among them
[1:02:44] amen now remember later on i believe
[1:02:48] it's ezekiel 33.
[1:02:51] they treated ezekiel like a lovely song
[1:02:55] right son of man towered a lovely song
[1:03:00] it was it was it was no deeper than
[1:03:03] any motion to them but there were some
[1:03:06] people
[1:03:07] that it went beyond the emotion it moved
[1:03:10] into their heart
[1:03:11] it got upon some solid ground it moved
[1:03:14] down into their light now notice
[1:03:16] whether they received it or not god let
[1:03:19] it be known

[1:04:13] be not afraid of their words nor be
[1:04:15] dismayed at their looks
[1:04:17] though they be a rebellious house it's
[1:04:19] not going to be comfortable
[1:04:21] but remember the same god that's given
[1:04:23] him the word is the same god that's
[1:04:25] coming in him

[1:04:44] my words unto them

[1:05:24] minstrel began to play
[1:05:25] the hand of the lord came upon him
[1:05:29] for ezekiel it was the hand of the lord
[1:05:31] that would come upon him and pack him
[1:05:33] from place to place
[1:05:35] it was the spirit of god through peter
[1:05:37] that would call you and i
[1:05:38] let us humble ourselves under the mighty
[1:05:41] hand of god
[1:05:42] that he might exalt thee in due time

[1:07:22] don't eat it you're running without a
[1:07:24] message

[1:08:56] he's a prophet he's eating the word
[1:08:58] right
[1:08:59] and he said unto me son of man cause
[1:09:02] that belly to eat
[1:09:04] and fill thy bowels i enter most parts
[1:09:07] with this roll that i give thee
[1:09:09] then did i eat it and it was in my mouth
[1:09:12] as honey for sweetness
[1:09:13] but remember cause your belly to eat it
[1:09:17] in the mouth it's sweet but when it gets
[1:09:20] down here
[1:09:21] and it starts breaking down has to
[1:09:23] digest where
[1:09:24] now it has to come and to bring that
[1:09:26] life
[1:09:27] in subjection it says cause thy belly to
[1:09:30] eat it
[1:09:33] how many say lord oh and that word as
[1:09:35] it's coming and we're eating in that
[1:09:37] word
[1:09:37] how sweet it is but to say god let me so
[1:09:40] die to myself
[1:09:42] that this word that is my joy i know in
[1:09:44] this word is power
[1:09:46] in this word is victory lord in this
[1:09:48] word is
[1:09:49] character molding and shaping power
[1:09:52] oh god shape my life so that the very
[1:09:56] character of my life will match that of
[1:09:59] the word
[1:10:03] oh my and it was in my mouth as honey
[1:10:05] for sweetness
[1:10:06] he said unto me son of man go get thee
[1:10:09] unto the house of israel
[1:10:11] and speak with my words unto them
[1:10:15] isn't that just like god when the word
[1:10:17] comes god goes and visits his kin folk
[1:10:22] hey when rahab came she wanted to go
[1:10:24] tell her family
[1:10:27] is that right when the world was coming
[1:10:29] to a climax of the end
[1:10:31] abraham was interceding for a lot amen
[1:10:35] is that right god puts that burden
[1:10:38] and that desire there within that life
[1:10:42] notice for thou are not sent to a people
[1:10:44] of a strange
[1:10:46] speech and of a hard language but to the
[1:10:47] house of israel not to many people of a
[1:10:50] strange speech and of a hard language
[1:10:52] whose words thou canst not understand
[1:10:55] surely
[1:10:55] had i sent thee to them they would have
[1:10:58] hearkened unto thee
[1:10:59] there one time it's not time for it to
[1:11:02] go to the gentiles
[1:11:04] god was letting ezekiel know if i sent
[1:11:06] you unto a people
[1:11:08] of a hard language to understand in
[1:11:09] other words your tongues
[1:11:11] it's not the same tongue they would
[1:11:13] receive it
[1:11:14] why wouldn't israel receive it
[1:11:16] rebellious why
[1:11:17] why how could they become rebellious how
[1:11:20] can god classify them
[1:11:21] as rebellious because they knew what was
[1:11:24] right
[1:11:25] and they refused to do it let me tell
[1:11:28] you something
[1:11:28] every time you put off what you know you
[1:11:31] ought to do
[1:11:32] your heart grows harder
[1:11:34] [Music]
[1:11:34] [Applause]
[1:11:37] listen there's nothing that god can't
[1:11:39] break but i'm just telling you right now
[1:11:41] every time you put it off and say
[1:11:43] there'll be another time
[1:11:45] or i can't do this or i can't do that
[1:11:47] you're exactly right
[1:11:49] you can't do a thing but god is greater
[1:11:52] than all of your strengths
[1:11:56] [Applause]
[1:11:57] in weakness he is mighty
[1:12:02] oh god i don't want to be i don't want
[1:12:05] to be a rebellious house
[1:12:09] i want to be sensitive when he's dealing
[1:12:11] with my heart
[1:12:14] amen praise god
[1:12:18] but the house of israel will not hearken
[1:12:20] unto thee for they will not hearken unto
[1:12:22] me
[1:12:22] notice they're not going to receive you
[1:12:25] as my prophet
[1:12:26] because they don't receive me for all
[1:12:29] the house of israel are impotent and
[1:12:31] hard-hearted oh my look at this but i
[1:12:34] have made thee
[1:12:34] thy face strong against their faces
[1:12:38] lotus i have made thy person
[1:12:41] strong against thy persons
[1:12:46] these are some pretty strong people
[1:12:49] remember he just talked about them here
[1:12:51] that they're like scorpions
[1:12:57] maybe you've never done it but i preach
[1:12:59] where people have had critical spirits
[1:13:02] not out there right here where it's come
[1:13:05] from right out of the pews and i had to
[1:13:07] just
[1:13:07] overlook it and say god be merciful
[1:13:10] it's a dangerous thing but you recognize
[1:13:13] it's a dangerous thing to set and notice
[1:13:16] here it was the word was going forth but
[1:13:18] notice what god told him
[1:13:19] you speak the word that i give you how
[1:13:22] could a man
[1:13:23] stand there in the face of all of that
[1:13:26] and deliver that word
[1:13:28] it's because the god who gave the word
[1:13:31] came down and stepped inside of that man
[1:13:34] and spake that word and gave that man
[1:13:37] strength
[1:13:38] through the prevailing power of that
[1:13:40] revelation of the word
[1:13:43] don't you see brother and sister when
[1:13:45] you and i go out on the job or wherever
[1:13:47] we go
[1:13:48] this word this relationship with god
[1:13:51] this anchor in our heart
[1:13:52] this message that god has placed so deep
[1:13:55] in our life
[1:13:56] it ain't separate it ain't something we
[1:13:58] leave in the house and go out to the job
[1:14:00] it's not something we leave on the shelf
[1:14:02] and bake our biscuits
[1:14:03] it is that which every part of our life
[1:14:06] it gives us strength it gives us courage
[1:14:09] it gives us an
[1:14:10] expectation it helps us to face
[1:14:13] day by day because we know who we are
[1:14:17] we know where we've come from and we
[1:14:18] know where we're going
[1:14:23] i have made thy face strong against
[1:14:25] their faces and thy forehead strong
[1:14:27] against their foreheads
[1:14:28] as an adamant harder than flint have i
[1:14:31] made thy forehead
[1:14:34] oh the seal of the living god is a
[1:14:36] powerful thing in it amen
[1:14:38] having the mind of christ the seal in
[1:14:40] their foreheads amen it's a powerful
[1:14:43] seal
[1:14:44] amen to know in whom you have believed
[1:14:47] to know
[1:14:48] that we belong to him and fear them not
[1:14:51] neither be dismayed at their looks
[1:14:53] though they be a rebellious house
[1:14:56] moreover he said unto me son of man all
[1:14:58] my words that i speak unto thee
[1:15:00] receive into thine heart
[1:15:04] and hear with thy words
[1:15:07] and go get thee to them of the captivity
[1:15:09] unto the children of thy people and
[1:15:11] speak unto them and tell them
[1:15:13] thus saith the lord god whether they
[1:15:15] will hear or whether they will forebear
[1:15:18] then the spirit took me up
[1:15:22] amen and i heard behind me a voice of a
[1:15:25] great rushing saying
[1:15:26] blessed be the glory of the lord
[1:15:29] from this place
[1:15:33] from his place you see here is god
[1:15:37] revealing his word to his prophet
[1:15:41] amen here ezekiel has
[1:15:44] went beyond just the writings just a
[1:15:47] letter
[1:15:48] if we can say it like this he went and
[1:15:50] entered into the veil
[1:15:51] into the presence of god he has become
[1:15:54] one
[1:15:55] with the word that is to be delivered
[1:15:58] and given out to the people of god and
[1:16:01] notice from this place
[1:16:03] blessed be the glory of the lord
[1:16:06] from his place the spirit took me up oh
[1:16:11] my
[1:16:11] god the word of god that had come to the
[1:16:15] prophet
[1:16:15] the same spirit of god that delivered
[1:16:18] the word
[1:16:19] that entered into the prophet that same
[1:16:21] spirit
[1:16:22] took him from that place to where he was
[1:16:25] supposed to go
[1:16:26] he was supposed to carry that word there
[1:16:30] unto the children of captivity
[1:16:31] let me preach now that same god that has
[1:16:34] revealed his word
[1:16:36] by his spirit and placed it inside of
[1:16:38] your life
[1:16:39] let me tell you the sons of god are led
[1:16:42] by the spirit of almighty god
[1:16:44] amen it is the spirit of god that is
[1:16:47] packing you
[1:16:48] that is carrying you that has equipped
[1:16:50] you
[1:16:51] that is guiding you that your footsteps
[1:16:54] are ordered
[1:16:54] as possessions
[1:16:56] [Applause]
[1:16:59] hallelujah you say what are you saying
[1:17:01] i'm talking about
[1:17:02] people who are walking with an authority
[1:17:07] [Music]
[1:17:13] oh my mama
[1:17:16] i heard also the noise of the wings of
[1:17:18] the living creatures
[1:17:20] that touched one another and the noise
[1:17:22] of the wheels over against them
[1:17:24] and the noise of a great rushing god's
[1:17:27] letting him know
[1:17:29] you stand for me i got your back
[1:17:34] hallelujah amen we're under that
[1:17:37] anointing
[1:17:38] of the word so the spirit lifted me up
[1:17:42] took me away and i went in bitterness
[1:17:44] and in the heat of my spirit
[1:17:46] you say a bitterness and the heat of my
[1:17:48] spirit he's got to deliver a word
[1:17:51] to a rebellious house that has
[1:17:54] continually hardened their heart
[1:17:57] he can't go and pat him on the back well
[1:18:00] you know you all were pretty good but
[1:18:02] you know that no no he's got to tear it
[1:18:04] on he's got to bring it on down
[1:18:06] as god has given him the word and let
[1:18:08] him know this is where this is what you
[1:18:10] should be
[1:18:11] but you're not right but god's made a
[1:18:14] promise
[1:18:19] see this word was getting them ready to
[1:18:21] get back into the land
[1:18:24] you see we we we we they were put out of
[1:18:28] eden but god sent a word
[1:18:30] amen that brings us back spiritually and
[1:18:32] prepares us
[1:18:33] to come back in the millennium it
[1:18:36] prepares us for that land that in my
[1:18:38] father's house are many mansions
[1:18:40] it prepares us for the millennium it
[1:18:42] prepares us for the future home
[1:18:45] amen so the prophets you know
[1:18:50] they they lived so much that brother
[1:18:51] brown would put it they lived so much in
[1:18:53] the presence of god
[1:18:55] and that he says until they would become
[1:18:59] one with the word
[1:19:01] and then the message is the word itself
[1:19:04] i know i know many of these quotes are
[1:19:06] familiar to you but don't just let them
[1:19:07] be familiar quotes
[1:19:10] they lived so much in that in that word
[1:19:12] till their message
[1:19:13] it was the word itself
[1:19:18] and remember he said thus saith the lord
[1:19:20] when those men
[1:19:21] had those messages from god they become
[1:19:24] so wrapped up
[1:19:25] that their own thinking it might have
[1:19:27] been against their thinking
[1:19:28] they may not have been able to see it
[1:19:30] right but they were speaking the word of
[1:19:33] god
[1:19:34] thus saith the lord amen
[1:19:38] hallelujah that's why once a person says
[1:19:42] well i don't need the message i'll just
[1:19:43] take what the bible says
[1:19:45] you won't know what the bible says
[1:19:47] without the message
[1:19:51] you've got to have the interpretation
[1:19:52] given by the spirit of god
[1:19:54] upon the word of god come on friends
[1:19:58] because if you're just going to take as
[1:19:59] it says by letter it's said to be
[1:20:01] baptized in the name of the father and
[1:20:03] of the son
[1:20:04] and of the holy ghost and peter said to
[1:20:07] repent
[1:20:08] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:20:10] christ for the remission of sins
[1:20:13] you need more than just written letters
[1:20:15] you need the author of the word to come
[1:20:18] down
[1:20:19] and interpret that word
[1:20:20] [Applause]
[1:20:27] i really don't care what people think
[1:20:32] i always like how brother harold
[1:20:33] hildebrand always put it he'd read a
[1:20:35] scripture he said now i'm going to read
[1:20:36] the amplified version
[1:20:38] and read a quote
[1:20:39] [Laughter]
[1:20:41] you know brother harold hildebrand
[1:20:42] brother dave you probably remember
[1:20:43] brother harold
[1:20:44] oh my brother brother will you know he's
[1:20:46] a great herald of the message there
[1:20:48] he really brought that message right
[1:20:50] there into africa amen among i remember
[1:20:52] when brother samson and man they
[1:20:54] they said man when when brother harold
[1:20:56] come it you know it came to a place
[1:20:59] it wasn't just about god sent a prophet
[1:21:00] anymore he said it came to a place he
[1:21:02] said
[1:21:03] now the mysteries begin to come open and
[1:21:06] begin to understand the things
[1:21:08] that god has sent in his word it's not
[1:21:10] uplifting a man but i'll tell you what
[1:21:12] thank god that there was a man that was
[1:21:15] yielded to god
[1:21:16] and he would go there and listen it was
[1:21:18] the same fire
[1:21:19] that god had put there in the heart of
[1:21:21] brother harold that caught fire there
[1:21:24] among them in ghana in other places what
[1:21:27] was it it was the same
[1:21:28] fire that came to the prophet and opened
[1:21:31] the world in this
[1:21:32] hour and interpreted that same pillar of
[1:21:36] fire
[1:21:36] has found its place and a bold and sons
[1:21:40] and daughters of god
[1:21:42] we're not just speakers of the word we
[1:21:45] are written epistles of this very word
[1:21:49] [Applause]
[1:21:54] you know what a written epistle is have
[1:21:55] you ever seen seed packets
[1:21:59] only two of you seen seed packets okay
[1:22:02] more of you seen them now
[1:22:04] little seed packet like this and it will
[1:22:06] say
[1:22:07] on that seed packet that these
[1:22:10] green beans or blue runners or whatever
[1:22:12] they are brother dave will know all the
[1:22:14] terminology on it
[1:22:15] but whatever they are on those seed
[1:22:16] packets when you read that there is a
[1:22:19] picture
[1:22:20] on the front of it of what that bean
[1:22:22] will look like
[1:22:24] when it's coming to manifestation in its
[1:22:26] season
[1:22:30] you don't take a picture of the uh of
[1:22:33] the bean
[1:22:33] when it's in its infancy and put it on
[1:22:36] the picture because
[1:22:38] not many people would buy it but you
[1:22:41] want to
[1:22:42] show the power that's in that seed
[1:22:48] come on somebody so you see when we're
[1:22:51] looking at this
[1:22:52] inside of that you see a picture but
[1:22:54] when you turn it over
[1:22:56] there's writing on the back of the
[1:22:57] packet and the writing on the back of
[1:23:00] the packet
[1:23:00] it tells you what zones they grow in it
[1:23:03] tells you what to be expected
[1:23:05] at this time and what to be expected at
[1:23:08] this time
[1:23:08] the reality is that the seeds that are
[1:23:10] in that packet
[1:23:12] if you can just keep watering them and
[1:23:14] the sunlight
[1:23:15] you put them in good soil they will
[1:23:18] come forth and let me tell you something
[1:23:22] god in this hour and each time he sends
[1:23:25] a message
[1:23:26] in full maturity and full power
[1:23:30] why it takes the full maturity and the
[1:23:33] full power
[1:23:34] to release what's on the inside
[1:23:38] man i feel good
[1:23:43] i ain't having church all by myself i
[1:23:45] know i've got somebody y'all with me
[1:23:49] hallelujah so you see it's that coming
[1:23:53] to maturity
[1:23:54] that's there on the inside notice
[1:23:57] brother brown would say
[1:23:58] like this in trying to do god a service
[1:24:01] notice he said
[1:24:02] god told the prophet eat the scroll
[1:24:05] in the old testament we just read that
[1:24:08] the prophet of the new testament
[1:24:09] he said eat the little book that's to
[1:24:12] you and me
[1:24:14] eat the little book become one
[1:24:17] revelations 10 8-11
[1:24:18] eat the little book you know it didn't
[1:24:21] say he descended with a big book
[1:24:25] he descended with a little book this
[1:24:27] message
[1:24:28] reveals the lamb's book of life
[1:24:31] it reveals those names that are there on
[1:24:34] the latin's book of life
[1:24:36] that's why you look and say why don't it
[1:24:38] settle with others
[1:24:39] why don't you give them that excitement
[1:24:41] why doesn't they get them them hope
[1:24:43] because in his word that is sent to sons
[1:24:46] and daughters of god
[1:24:47] it is the inspiration of the holy ghost
[1:24:50] upon the word to inspire the sons and
[1:24:53] daughters of god in this hour
[1:25:08] remember before ezekiel could ever go
[1:25:10] start speaking it he had to eat it
[1:25:15] amen they had to become one with it
[1:25:21] they became one within in the upper room
[1:25:26] the jesus they walked with
[1:25:29] the one who was veiled behind humanity
[1:25:32] that let them know i'm the same god
[1:25:34] now that same god had come inside of
[1:25:38] them
[1:25:46] and the word they had received it was
[1:25:49] now the
[1:25:50] acts of the holy spirit through their
[1:25:52] lives
[1:25:55] notice he says why why why did he say to
[1:25:58] do that
[1:25:59] that the prophet and the word would be
[1:26:01] one
[1:26:03] that's the ark the word of god
[1:26:09] see the word that is expressed
[1:26:12] is also being expressed from this voice
[1:26:16] not just this voice this voice
[1:26:19] it's the voice of your life not just the
[1:26:22] voice of our mouth
[1:26:24] but the voice of our life this may not
[1:26:27] get a chance to get open
[1:26:29] and proclaim it but this can proclaim it
[1:26:33] our life can stand in a place brother
[1:26:35] and when people say
[1:26:37] ha ha this guy is a whole this guy's a
[1:26:39] holy roller
[1:26:41] well i think you know as my aunt linda
[1:26:43] was you know after god really had got a
[1:26:45] hold of her life and
[1:26:46] and did such a work and revealed this
[1:26:47] word she got called quaker woman and
[1:26:49] everything else you want to make it fun
[1:26:52] but you know what happens
[1:26:53] the seal of god you know what it does it
[1:26:55] calls it to be adamant in the forehead
[1:26:58] harder than flint you're able to stand
[1:27:00] there why
[1:27:02] because there is a strength that's
[1:27:04] behind you you are standing there
[1:27:06] identified with him
[1:27:07] and you're not ashamed of it
[1:27:12] it's glorious to be identified with him
[1:27:16] oh you've lost your mind where where's
[1:27:18] your fun at oh my
[1:27:20] i've got more fun now than i ever had
[1:27:23] i don't get headaches from it and this
[1:27:25] from it and that from it
[1:27:27] man i i have joy sometimes i have a hard
[1:27:30] time sleeping but i have joy
[1:27:34] hallelujah
[1:27:38] this is what jesus said except you eat
[1:27:40] the flesh of the son of man and drink
[1:27:41] his blood
[1:27:43] you have no life in you remember when
[1:27:46] moses came forth
[1:27:48] he came forth veiled
[1:27:53] let me just come down here
[1:27:58] when moses came from out of that pillar
[1:28:00] of fire
[1:28:02] god had called him into there and moses
[1:28:04] had
[1:28:05] the word of god for the people this is a
[1:28:08] prophet of god
[1:28:10] notice a prophet of god is not
[1:28:14] carrying or speaking his own words
[1:28:24] it doesn't mean that the man still
[1:28:26] doesn't have his own thoughts
[1:28:29] but the thoughts of god that come they
[1:28:32] override
[1:28:33] his thoughts john
[1:28:37] identified according to the promise
[1:28:41] when he would see the spirit of god whom
[1:28:44] thou see the spirit of god descended
[1:28:45] this is he
[1:28:47] john went right forth and announced it
[1:28:50] but then john got down there
[1:28:52] in prison and he got his eagle eye
[1:28:54] filmed over
[1:28:57] what was spoken out of john's mouth was
[1:29:00] right on
[1:29:01] but john's thinking about it
[1:29:05] was something that god had
[1:29:08] to come and help his prophet
[1:29:12] hallelujah are you with me because it
[1:29:15] wasn't happening according to how
[1:29:16] he thought it would how he thought it
[1:29:18] should but what did jesus said
[1:29:20] stay around and when you witness what is
[1:29:24] taking place
[1:29:24] then go tell him what you see well
[1:29:28] what were they to tell him it was to
[1:29:30] announce this is the messiah
[1:29:34] let me tell you you and i have found our
[1:29:37] place there
[1:29:38] many times but how that gone and it's
[1:29:41] not just about
[1:29:42] oh you know in your walk as a believer
[1:29:44] but sometimes you might feel
[1:29:45] oh as a housewife or oh as a as a you
[1:29:48] know as a daughter of god or as a son of
[1:29:50] god or i'm not that much or i'm not that
[1:29:52] good i'm not
[1:29:53] and god has to come around and let you
[1:29:56] see
[1:29:58] that he's a living god and what he has
[1:30:00] done in your life
[1:30:02] and the same god that has placed the
[1:30:04] attributes within you
[1:30:06] to do what is to be done he's the one
[1:30:09] who brings them forth
[1:30:11] amen and you know what it's actually a
[1:30:14] blessing man
[1:30:14] just understand me for a moment here
[1:30:16] it's actually a blessing
[1:30:18] that you don't think that your face
[1:30:21] belongs on the front of good
[1:30:22] housekeeping
[1:30:25] because if you thought your face
[1:30:26] belonged on the on the front of good
[1:30:28] housekeeping
[1:30:29] god couldn't work through you god can't
[1:30:33] work through pride
[1:30:34] no it's true right you understand me
[1:30:37] pride is a sinful thing
[1:30:41] the holy spirit had brother jerry deal
[1:30:43] with that on that sunday morning that
[1:30:44] whole way through because a lot of times
[1:30:46] people are looking for sin and
[1:30:47] all this and this and that pride is a
[1:30:49] nasty ugly thing
[1:30:50] yes it is people can have everything
[1:30:53] down to the hill and yet they have so
[1:30:54] much pride
[1:30:57] god can't operate where there's pride
[1:31:01] but you know where god can operate where
[1:31:03] there's lives
[1:31:05] that can just say lord wrap your
[1:31:08] presence in me
[1:31:11] lord as a believer i need you
[1:31:15] i need you to walk inside of me lord
[1:31:18] i need you to manifest my life as a
[1:31:20] believer lord
[1:31:22] i need you lord god is the housewife
[1:31:24] lord i don't have it all together
[1:31:26] i might know this and know that but lord
[1:31:28] help me
[1:31:29] has a husband on their job and different
[1:31:32] things around
[1:31:32] the house if you think you've got it all
[1:31:34] together then he can't work
[1:31:36] you might say god would be so mindful
[1:31:39] and he would care
[1:31:40] about little things like that god cares
[1:31:42] about little things
[1:31:44] god cares about things that he's able to
[1:31:47] tell you
[1:31:47] and let you see his divine care over
[1:31:50] little things because why
[1:31:52] if we can see it over little things then
[1:31:54] we know that he's got the big things
[1:31:56] we're so all the time looking for bigger
[1:31:59] things and god himself
[1:32:00] is making himself known by little things
[1:32:06] but when you get little a lot of little
[1:32:08] things struck together
[1:32:09] you're getting a good fire ready for
[1:32:11] some hot dogs and s'mores and the rest
[1:32:14] because you really can't cook any meat
[1:32:15] over top of a little twig
[1:32:20] i'm not way off base i'm right on track
[1:32:22] still
[1:32:23] many times we'll go and you know zachary
[1:32:25] wants a fire dad let's build a fire
[1:32:26] tonight dad let's build a fire tonight
[1:32:29] so about that time you know he'll come
[1:32:30] out there and we get you know maybe like
[1:32:32] a little twig he runs in the house he's
[1:32:34] going to get a piece of paper
[1:32:35] light that paper up and before i look
[1:32:36] around on the skewer he's got this
[1:32:38] marshmallow i said son
[1:32:40] that paper does not have the heat that's
[1:32:43] needed
[1:32:44] to let that marshmallow go on your
[1:32:46] chocolate in your graham cracker
[1:32:49] but this piece of paper will help the
[1:32:51] twig and the twig will help the next
[1:32:53] twig
[1:32:53] and the next twig and the next twig with
[1:32:56] eventually
[1:32:56] let's get this log caught on fire
[1:32:59] because once there gets enough heat
[1:33:00] then the big things start burning amen
[1:33:04] you see it's in the little things that
[1:33:05] many times where israel was looking back
[1:33:08] they would get off track
[1:33:09] they wanted the great god they wanted
[1:33:12] the mighty god but remember
[1:33:14] the mighty god is brought on the scene
[1:33:17] by simple obedience amen
[1:33:20] it's the little things and you see a
[1:33:22] prophet why he's so overlooked
[1:33:24] is because it looks like why does god
[1:33:26] care about this
[1:33:28] why does god care about how i dress why
[1:33:30] does god care about that
[1:33:31] why does god care about you know how i
[1:33:33] look why does god care about this
[1:33:35] why does god care whether or not you
[1:33:37] know my life is cleaned up
[1:33:38] and free because he cares
[1:33:42] because god's desire is to come
[1:33:45] and to live his life inside of you and
[1:33:50] through you
[1:33:52] to where just as much when a prophet has
[1:33:55] come
[1:33:56] that people would know there's been a
[1:33:58] prophet whether they receive it or not
[1:34:00] and when you go on the workplace when
[1:34:03] you're among your
[1:34:04] family when you're in europe when you're
[1:34:06] in your community
[1:34:07] that they would know a christian lives
[1:34:10] here
[1:34:11] a believer lives here we don't know
[1:34:14] where to place them at because they
[1:34:15] don't say their methodist or
[1:34:16] pentecost store or we don't know where
[1:34:18] to place them but there's one thing
[1:34:20] about it
[1:34:22] they're a christian
[1:34:25] and that's what we want we want that
[1:34:28] word we want to be so one with that word
[1:34:31] that that word would reflect itself out
[1:34:34] through our life i'm talking about in
[1:34:37] such a place to where a person
[1:34:39] can look at your life now you may not
[1:34:40] have all the words because sometimes
[1:34:42] a person thinks they've got to be able
[1:34:43] to string together all the words and
[1:34:45] my i've got to be able to put together
[1:34:47] all the scriptures and all the quotes no
[1:34:48] you don't have to be able to do that all
[1:34:50] we have to be able to do is let jesus
[1:34:53] be first place because after all
[1:34:57] that he's the one that they're going to
[1:34:58] be attracted to
[1:35:00] not if we're able to put it together
[1:35:01] just right or we're able to do this
[1:35:03] that that's not it we want them to be
[1:35:05] attracted to him
[1:35:06] and when they get attracted to him then
[1:35:08] god will give us the words and say
[1:35:10] repent be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:35:12] christ don't worry
[1:35:14] all that'll come right in its place and
[1:35:16] in its season
[1:35:17] oh my well i hope i hope it's made sense
[1:35:21] tonight in some way
[1:35:23] a little bit more clear when this when
[1:35:26] we look at
[1:35:27] what a prophet is a seer he's one who is
[1:35:29] one
[1:35:30] with the word god would give his
[1:35:33] his bible his bible that you and i would
[1:35:36] have
[1:35:36] and people could pack think about how
[1:35:38] many people had packed the bible around
[1:35:40] but god would in this hour according to
[1:35:43] his word
[1:35:43] it was the mercy of god before judgment
[1:35:46] that he would open
[1:35:47] his word and begin to reveal the
[1:35:50] interpretation of that word
[1:35:53] oh my god i'll tell you we ought to be
[1:35:56] the happiest people
[1:35:58] and yet at the same time about being the
[1:35:59] happiest it makes you want to cry
[1:36:02] lord jesus who am i who am i
[1:36:06] that you would come down and reveal
[1:36:08] yourself worthy
[1:36:10] not at all not at all worthy worthy
[1:36:13] there's a lot more people who are worthy
[1:36:17] better people esau was a much better man
[1:36:20] than jacob
[1:36:21] [Music]
[1:36:22] but jacob was god's choice
[1:36:25] clear back from his mind what was that
[1:36:28] choice about
[1:36:29] of how jacob would respond
[1:36:33] and he would have a desire for the
[1:36:35] birthright
[1:36:36] think about this think about it for a
[1:36:38] moment
[1:36:40] when he could have in his mind are you
[1:36:42] listening to me he can have in his mind
[1:36:44] well there ain't no chance for me to get
[1:36:46] it it belongs to esau
[1:36:48] esau is the firstborn there was
[1:36:49] something in him
[1:36:51] even in his unconverted state there was
[1:36:54] something in him
[1:36:55] that he longed for that birthright what
[1:36:57] was that
[1:36:58] it was the seed of god on the inside
[1:37:02] reason he couldn't kill it reasoning
[1:37:05] couldn't stifle it
[1:37:06] why there's a germ of life on the inside
[1:37:11] [Applause]
[1:37:17] and when jacob came there to battle that
[1:37:19] night brother
[1:37:20] there was that time i'm talking about on
[1:37:23] his way to bada
[1:37:24] to to down around when he was on that
[1:37:26] way there
[1:37:27] he met god it didn't change him but he
[1:37:30] knew
[1:37:30] that the god that he was longing for
[1:37:33] that god was alive
[1:37:35] he was real he wasn't just his daddy's
[1:37:38] god
[1:37:39] he was god
[1:37:44] hallelujah
[1:37:47] jacob knew watch over me lord
[1:37:51] and bring me back to this place
[1:37:56] god knew how to let situations arise to
[1:37:58] get him back to this place
[1:38:01] because it was in this place not any
[1:38:04] other place
[1:38:05] in this place that god was going to
[1:38:07] reveal himself
[1:38:08] to jacob god knows just how look just as
[1:38:11] he get
[1:38:12] the israel back into their place just as
[1:38:14] god would get you and i in our place
[1:38:18] you might have started your walk in your
[1:38:20] journey you know in a pentecostal church
[1:38:23] maybe you started in a catholic church
[1:38:25] maybe it's in the charismatic church
[1:38:26] oh brother samuel how could anybody
[1:38:28] start it there if they believe
[1:38:30] on jesus christ
[1:38:35] sure had all sorts of things till about
[1:38:38] their life
[1:38:38] but you see it was not the place that
[1:38:41] god
[1:38:42] had ordained to reveal himself but it's
[1:38:44] part of the journey
[1:38:46] but in that god himself will see to it
[1:38:50] that that life is brought to that
[1:38:52] ordained place
[1:38:54] what place that god himself might reveal
[1:38:57] himself to you and that you might

[1:41:45] idolatry but they're preaching
[1:41:47] the presumptions of man and raising up
[1:41:49] idols

[1:42:23] believe the works
[1:42:25] they testify
[1:42:31] so what are you saying you're going to
[1:42:33] follow somebody

[1:44:27] when i saw your glorious
[1:44:30] life he faced the face with
[1:44:35] [Music]
[1:44:41] not even in my wildest dreams
[1:44:46] did i think i'd see such things
[1:44:50] as the coming of the lord
[1:44:54] the rapture mystery
[1:45:00] i have heard but now i
[1:45:03] see god in simplicity
[1:45:09] the spoken word is the original
[1:45:15] i seed me
[1:45:19] and i just want to thank you all
[1:45:23] for letting me
[1:45:28] what have i done to deserve
[1:45:32] those glories revealed in me
[1:45:38] thank you for that
[1:45:42] when i saw your glorious light
[1:45:47] to face the face with eternal life
[1:46:01] he said the house of israel is a
[1:46:04] rebellious house
[1:46:08] but there was some believers inside of
[1:46:11] there
[1:46:14] and they were going to let go of that
[1:46:17] identity
[1:46:18] i'm not going to be identified as a
[1:46:21] rebellious one
[1:46:23] you see the word was able to so reach
[1:46:25] into their heart there was a
[1:46:27] longing that word as it was going forth
[1:46:31] while they were in captivity
[1:46:32] brother joy it was preparing their
[1:46:35] hearts for the journey back home
[1:46:40] there was some that looked at it and
[1:46:41] said my goodness man
[1:46:43] here we are in this state look what kind
[1:46:46] of a mess we're in
[1:46:48] and we're called a rebellious house but
[1:46:50] the rest of them
[1:46:51] there's something about it it could
[1:46:53] touch their heart
[1:46:55] he said i want to go home i want to go
[1:46:59] home
[1:47:02] you know there were some that aligned
[1:47:03] with the word when jeremiah was there
[1:47:06] when jeremiah was ministering there was
[1:47:08] people who aligned with that word
[1:47:11] they still went into captivity but their
[1:47:14] hearts were prepared
[1:47:15] by receiving the word to return
[1:47:19] now you might not think like that's much
[1:47:21] how many of you ever read in the psalms
[1:47:22] where it says
[1:47:23] and this is a psalm of the sons of korah
[1:47:27] how many of you ever read that these
[1:47:29] were
[1:47:30] these were sons of korah who refused to
[1:47:33] be identified
[1:47:35] with what their daddy did in the past
[1:47:38] they were not going to let their daddy
[1:47:40] as he stood
[1:47:41] against the revealed word of the hour
[1:47:43] that ain't my identity
[1:47:45] they were one with that word are you
[1:47:48] with me
[1:47:49] they overcame the rebellion let me just
[1:47:52] tell you
[1:47:52] each and every one of us that first
[1:47:55] birth
[1:47:56] was a rebellious birth these two
[1:47:59] listen this guy on the outside and that
[1:48:02] spirit that's why we need the holy
[1:48:04] spirit
[1:48:04] to bring these outer two realms in
[1:48:07] subjection
[1:48:08] because these outer two realms would try
[1:48:10] to raise up in rebellion but this is why
[1:48:12] you got to have a greater is he
[1:48:14] that is in you than he that's in the
[1:48:17] world
[1:48:18] what does he do he brings the rebellious
[1:48:20] in subjection
[1:48:23] and this is why on the inside there's
[1:48:25] there's a word and it comes and you can
[1:48:27] say
[1:48:27] oh ouch oh me lord jesus help me
[1:48:31] lord god forgive me lord god let me rise
[1:48:34] why there's a son and daughter of god on
[1:48:37] the inside that says
[1:48:38] i ain't going to be identified with
[1:48:40] rebellion i'm going to be identified
[1:48:42] with the word
[1:48:43] amen that's what a word of the lord does
[1:48:46] it comes to lift you
[1:48:48] above rebellion
[1:48:54] don't you love him aren't you glad that
[1:48:56] there's a word
[1:48:58] that comes to lift you out of the
[1:49:00] identity of just your natural family
[1:49:02] tree
[1:49:02] you might have good genes in your
[1:49:04] background and oh my
[1:49:06] the hannah's oh my what great people

[1:49:29] that's good
[1:49:30] and that's when the tree of life comes
[1:49:33] inside of you
[1:49:34] [Applause]
[1:49:36] you didn't know it you went for a long
[1:49:37] time you didn't know you were part of
[1:49:39] that tree of life
[1:49:42] but then he came who the vine came
[1:49:46] and revealed you're my branch
[1:49:48] [Music]

[1:49:53] bear my fruit
[1:49:54] my image you've tried to unite with so
[1:49:57] many things in life
[1:49:58] but you were ordained to be united with
[1:50:01] me
[1:50:02] [Music]
[1:50:05] we were meant for one another glory be

[1:50:26] rebellion
[1:50:28] i'm going to be identified with the word
[1:50:30] of the lord

[1:50:34] identified with the word
[1:50:39] what's happening the word you're
[1:50:41] receiving it's causing you to stand up
[1:50:44] and the spirit is entering in
[1:50:48] same what god did with ezekiel when god

[1:50:54] it's got to find a resting place
[1:50:57] it's got to find a resting place
[1:51:02] and i believe i'm looking at part of
[1:51:03] that resting place i believe i'm part of
[1:51:05] it
[1:51:07] when god said behold i send you
[1:51:10] right here he sent elijah for me
[1:51:16] why because i'm a son of god
[1:51:19] i needed to know how to get back home
