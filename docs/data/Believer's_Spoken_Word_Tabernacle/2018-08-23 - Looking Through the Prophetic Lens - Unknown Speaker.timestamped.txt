[13:44] let you have your seats
[13:47] blessed is he whose transgression is
[13:50] forgiven whose sin is covered
[13:53] blessed is the man unto whom the lord
[13:56] imputeth not iniquity and whose spirit
[14:00] there is no guile when I kept silence my
[14:03] bones waxed old through my roaring all
[14:06] the day long for day and night thy hand
[14:09] was heavy upon me my moisture is turned
[14:12] into the drought of summer sale on I
[14:16] acknowledged my sin unto thee and mine
[14:19] iniquity have I not hid I said I will
[14:22] confess my transgressions unto the Lord
[14:25] and thou forgave us the iniquity of my
[14:28] sin Sayla
[14:31] he stopped the roaring are you with me
[14:35] he stopped the roaring by confession for
[14:39] this shall everyone that is godly pray
[14:43] unto thee in a time when thou mayst be
[14:47] found aren't you glad you found him he
[14:53] said well now wait a minute both Sam you
[14:54] it was him that found us that's true
[14:57] it's the manifestation of his word that
[15:01] is becomes the lighthouse and it's him
[15:04] finding you aren't you glad aren't you
[15:08] glad there is that place made known to
[15:11] us we didn't find him in a church we
[15:14] found him in his word amen surely in the
[15:18] floods of Great Waters they shall not
[15:21] come 9 to him thou art my hiding place
[15:25] thou shalt preserve me from trouble
[15:29] thou shall compass me about with songs
[15:32] of deliverance sail
[15:35] this is where I want to draw from even

[15:41] thee and teach thee in the way which
[15:43] thou shalt go I will guide thee with
[15:46] mine I be you not as the horse or as the
[15:51] mule which have no understanding whose
[15:54] mouths must be held in with bit and
[15:57] bridle lest they come near unto thee

[16:06] compass him about in that wonderful be
[16:11] glad in the Lord and rejoice ye
[16:15] righteous and shout for joy all ye that
[16:19] are upright in heart a man you love the
[16:23] Lord tonight amen god bless you as
[16:26] you're being seated bless the reading of
[16:28] the word I want to speak to you tonight
[16:34] I know we've been dealing with that
[16:35] thought on the high ground and I just
[16:38] there's a lot of things that I have
[16:40] drawn from some of that but here a few
[16:43] weeks ago it just seemed that the Holy
[16:47] Spirit I was setting there meditating
[16:49] and for me I you know I meditate a lot
[16:54] and something even when I worked and
[16:57] things like that and I I found that that
[17:00] would be a very very very precious thing
[17:02] to meditate on the things of God and and
[17:05] sometimes you know you you you don't
[17:08] even know that the thought you just give
[17:10] yourself to the Word of God and got to
[17:13] begin to speak to you
[17:15] his presence will drop down a matter of
[17:17] fact as I told one of my boys we were
[17:18] talking the other day I said every
[17:20] message I said that I've ever received
[17:22] of God that I've spoke to his people has
[17:25] come through meditation and prayer every
[17:29] message I've I've never got a message
[17:32] where I just sat down on a computer and
[17:33] I just studied studying study no I just
[17:36] many times they'll take take a notepad
[17:38] sometimes I'll just take things and I'm
[17:40] just praying and write in prayer and
[17:43] things will drop and and I know that's
[17:45] no different from really from any other
[17:47] minister
[17:48] I know that and I don't say it for that
[17:49] but sometimes God will press things on
[17:52] our hearts and I really feel in my heart
[17:54] to bring these things to us as an
[17:57] assembly and for us to begin to look
[17:59] into these things we'll just we'll see
[18:03] where we get tonight I'm not going to
[18:04] even try to get to a certain spot we'll
[18:07] just see where he wants us to get to it
[18:09] so we'll just we'll just approach it
[18:11] like that that'll be safe for you but I
[18:16] want to speak on the father at least
[18:17] begin to looking through the prophetic
[18:19] lens looking through the prophetic lens
[18:23] you know it's a it's a great thing to be
[18:26] able to see I think of minute you know I
[18:30] think of when my eyesight started
[18:32] changing myself I was must have been
[18:36] maybe in sixth grade you know and
[18:38] sometimes I had the privilege of sitting
[18:41] towards the front of the class not by
[18:42] choice but I was able to see what was on
[18:45] the board but I remember - I remember of
[18:48] when I was in seventh grade I remember
[18:51] at the time you know starting to squint
[18:54] and I had a buddy by me he would you
[18:57] know I had a teacher that just filled
[18:58] the notes that the talk board every
[19:00] every chalkboard even on the side with
[19:02] notes you know and and and I remember I
[19:05] was set in there and I was about 3/4 of
[19:08] the way back in the room and I was just
[19:09] squinting my eyes I didn't have glasses
[19:11] at the time I didn't know what was going
[19:14] on and you know it went on my seventh
[19:17] grade year and of course I never you
[19:19] know I never mention anything to my mom
[19:21] and dad cuz I didn't know anything was
[19:22] wrong and you know then it got in my
[19:26] eighth grade year when we had moved up
[19:28] here to Sandusky and I remember sitting
[19:31] there in the classroom and and you know
[19:33] I must have said something then to my to
[19:35] my mom and dad about something and then
[19:37] right then they took me back down to
[19:40] where we live drove about three and a
[19:41] half hours because they they had
[19:43] confidence and that eye doctor there we
[19:45] didn't have things established here and
[19:47] I remember you know I didn't want to
[19:49] wear glasses I just wanted to be cool so
[19:51] I don't want to be you know identified
[19:54] four eyes and all these things you know
[19:56] and you know I you know you're at fourth
[19:58] your eighth grade you know ever
[20:00] thing is you know you got the world
[20:02] under control and and I remember going
[20:05] there and I think was dr. tan German is
[20:07] his name and he put different contact
[20:09] lens in my eyes and what I remember is
[20:12] is when I when he put those soft lens in
[20:15] my eyes and I remember looking and I
[20:17] thought my goodness I'm able to read
[20:21] that line down there and and then I
[20:23] remembered when I walked out it's like
[20:26] the whole world itself looked new to me
[20:29] I mean it was something on the way home
[20:32] now mind you this three and a half hour
[20:34] trip we had made this trip for almost
[20:36] seven years and I knew many of the
[20:38] points along the way and Faust story and
[20:41] all the different routes you could take
[20:43] you know to kind of break up the
[20:44] monotony but I remember that day oh it
[20:47] was it was different than those other
[20:49] times because for that time I could see
[20:52] things and I could see it even before we
[20:55] were getting to it I wasn't by color
[20:57] either it was where I can actually see
[20:59] the writing and I could see those things
[21:02] that made it that made a world of
[21:04] difference I felt like I was living in a
[21:06] different world and it was all because
[21:09] that my eyes I had a lens that I could
[21:12] look through that really brought things
[21:15] real to me and I realized what I've been
[21:18] missing you know I never had to ask that
[21:20] neighbor in the class again can I borrow
[21:22] your notebook I never had to do that
[21:24] again I mean I was able to take the
[21:27] notes myself I never had to borrow that
[21:30] again and that's I believe with all my
[21:32] heart that that's God's desire for every
[21:35] one of us that it's not just something
[21:37] where you have to take somebody's word
[21:39] for it but I believe that when you look
[21:42] at that word to have faith in that word
[21:44] and to know that God is real and to know
[21:47] that there is another dimension that's
[21:50] moving right here among us right here
[21:53] tonight to where that you're actually
[21:55] would be able to see things in the way
[21:58] that God would have you to see them and
[22:00] to be able to recognize who you are
[22:02] where we are and where we're going the
[22:06] scriptures are clear that we walk not by
[22:09] sight we walk by faith so we wreck
[22:12] now that faith itself is is that
[22:14] revelation of God so we recognize that
[22:17] revelation itself is not darkness but
[22:20] revelation is lie and if light has come
[22:23] then it is something to be able to show
[22:27] a pathway of how we ought to go and I
[22:30] begin to think of this thought you know
[22:32] there in in verse 8 where it says I will
[22:35] instruct thee and teach the in the way
[22:38] which thou shalt go aren't you glad that
[22:41] the Lord instructs us and teaches us
[22:44] aren't you glad that he just doesn't
[22:46] bring us into the kingdom of God and
[22:48] then he turns us loose and says figure
[22:51] out your own way but he's a faithful
[22:53] father he works with us the relationship
[22:56] grows he teaches us and he instructs us
[22:59] and the whole thing is it's what already
[23:02] is sown and lays within us he already
[23:05] knows the full potential in our life and
[23:09] he's the one that we want to hear
[23:11] because he knows what is there and he's
[23:13] the one that can bring it forth and this
[23:16] is his promise I will guide thee with
[23:19] mine I God doesn't want us as it goes on
[23:24] to say in that verse that we would be as
[23:26] the horse or the mule now many times
[23:28] you'll find in the scripture that a
[23:29] horse itself would you know there is
[23:31] some times where God will use a horse
[23:33] and a comparison in the times of where
[23:36] it would be thoroughbred but yet here in
[23:38] this verse God is letting it be known
[23:39] that I want to be able to lead you by
[23:43] mine I it's not something to where I
[23:46] gotta put a bit in your mouth and to put
[23:49] you know the bridle on has that you
[23:52] don't know where you're going but I want
[23:54] you to know who's leading you who's
[23:57] guiding you and I want you to have that
[23:59] understanding that you are able to look
[24:02] and see beyond just this realm that's
[24:05] right here you're able to walk with a
[24:08] real understanding now you and I both
[24:11] know there's times when you know you can
[24:13] be looking at something whether you're
[24:14] in school your training or whatever more
[24:16] and you can look at it you can almost
[24:18] beat your brains out looking at it but
[24:20] all of a sudden once something drops and
[24:23] you begin to
[24:24] see it you can say or they call a light
[24:26] ball moment or uh-oh moment or aha it's
[24:30] when things that you've been hearing all
[24:32] of a sudden it comes together and it
[24:35] makes sense
[24:36] you've got an understanding and that's
[24:38] exactly what God intends to do that's
[24:40] exactly when God would pour out of his
[24:43] spirit and begin to reveal himself in
[24:46] his word in a generation it's that you
[24:48] and I might walk with an understanding
[24:50] that we understand the time we
[24:52] understand where we're living we're not
[24:54] just church members but we are members
[24:57] of the body of Jesus Christ there is an
[25:01] understanding of who he is an
[25:02] understanding of who we are an
[25:05] understanding of what He desires and
[25:07] once out of our life and I believe what
[25:09] we can agree together tonight I believe
[25:11] you can agree with me God wants more
[25:13] than just the sanctified life
[25:15] God wants a life that's filled up God
[25:17] wants a life that walks in complete
[25:20] obedience to his word and I thank God
[25:24] for every life that'll live above all
[25:26] unclean things of the world but let me
[25:28] tell you something there's much more to
[25:31] Christianity than just living a life
[25:34] that is above and unclean out there
[25:36] there is a life that is put in motion
[25:39] and an action by the Holy Spirit that
[25:42] becomes the very word Express in this
[25:45] hour in this day I look at this thought
[25:51] here how will God be with mine I you
[25:56] know brother branham he preaches a
[25:57] message called God's eye I'm brother
[26:00] Graham he deals with it in there he says
[26:02] you know he said I'm glad that how God
[26:04] placed sit here in his word that we do
[26:07] have a hiding place and here that hiding
[26:09] place is God's great presence we can
[26:14] hide from the things of the world and
[26:17] it's to know that his presence is here
[26:20] and it's ever to guide us and I want you
[26:22] to to think of it we even with the
[26:24] example that I gave you with myself
[26:26] being able to see you know the great
[26:29] high of Jehovah brother Brandon would
[26:31] put it like this he said Jesus looked
[26:34] through his eyes he says a matter of
[26:38] fact he said when Simon came up to him
[26:40] and he remember what Simon who we know
[26:42] called Peter he came up to him he began
[26:46] to reveal to him who his daddy was he
[26:49] identified his name and he identified of
[26:52] what he was to be called Barrett that
[26:55] there's no way that a man could just
[26:58] look at this but it's the eye of God and
[27:00] the Lord Jesus was looking through that
[27:03] eye you know when God became man God was
[27:07] identifying that this eye is pressing
[27:11] upon the earth he he was opening a
[27:13] channel in a realm of which the prophets
[27:17] had tapped into but he was opening this
[27:19] channel that it's not just something
[27:21] that you can tap into once in a while he
[27:24] was there was gonna be a channel will
[27:26] repeat of God a channel that would be
[27:29] open between God and man as a matter of
[27:32] fact when Jacob was there at Bethel he
[27:35] saw a ladder of God and the ladder it
[27:38] was coming from heaven it sat down upon
[27:40] the earth it was a channel and access
[27:43] way that would be opened up that the
[27:45] angels of God were ascending and
[27:48] descending there would be a channel that
[27:50] would be open up were all the veils that
[27:53] had blocked off they had separated the
[27:56] chasm but he himself who stood in the
[28:00] breach and the gap for you and I he sent
[28:03] back the Holy Ghost that you and I might
[28:06] have that ministry in our hearts that
[28:09] removes the chasm and we stand back in
[28:12] the presence of God as sons and
[28:14] daughters of God
[28:16] this channel is opened up and brother
[28:20] Graham goes long to say like this I
[28:21] think it's worthy for us to look at this
[28:23] he talks about how God's eyes have God's
[28:26] eye has been with the prophets through
[28:28] the ages the only way that Noah was able
[28:37] to see the flood that was coming upon
[28:39] the earth would because of the eye of
[28:42] God he saw judgment that was coming but
[28:47] remember before judgment can strike
[28:48] grace is given
[28:50] it was the eye of God whereby that even
[28:56] God would come and minister to Abraham
[29:00] to where Abraham would be able to see
[29:03] what God wanted him to see and it was
[29:06] that same eye of God that abided there
[29:09] to where Sarah herself could actually
[29:12] come to a place as recorded in Hebrews
[29:14] that she would judge him faithful who
[29:17] made the promise it was that same eye of
[29:20] God that day walking in obedience to the
[29:25] word were privileged to live and walk
[29:28] and be guided by that eye and look
[29:30] through that eyelid let me just say like
[29:32] this the fashions of Sodom were very
[29:36] real there were things that were vexing
[29:39] and things that were moving through but
[29:41] you see there was an eye of God that had
[29:44] opened where Abraham stayed separated
[29:47] now fair in the plains and let me tell
[29:49] you something
[29:50] the Prophet said and you can read it in
[29:52] the scripture it wasn't that he had
[29:54] everything easy it wasn't that it was
[29:56] always lush and everything just going on
[29:59] around but sometimes God will let areas
[30:02] that even he's promised to you it might
[30:05] seem dry but let me tell you something
[30:07] you would be better to stay but God has
[30:10] called you to be in his word then they
[30:13] go chasing after anything that's lush
[30:15] it's to stay in God's provided way
[30:18] because God rewards those who stay
[30:21] faithful to him and to his word that's
[30:25] the truth the eye of God the eye of God
[30:29] you see it was down through the prophets
[30:32] it was Moses who looked through that I
[30:33] have God now we could run this the rest
[30:36] of the night hallelujah they were
[30:39] looking through the eye of God his eyes
[30:41] you looked through the eye of God you
[30:43] see these men were not looking for
[30:45] natural eyes whoa thank you Jesus the
[30:50] haze' was standing there one time and
[30:52] Gaza was looking the servant there of
[30:55] Elijah he was looking through these eyes
[30:58] he looked out and he saw the hillsides
[31:01] they were
[31:02] with the Syrian army but Elijah who was
[31:08] looking through the eyes of God he knew
[31:10] what it was that this man needed this
[31:13] man didn't need semen he did me condemn
[31:16] and he needed his eyes open then Elijah
[31:22] stood there with the word in his heart
[31:24] he prayed a prayer of intercession and
[31:27] God moved on the scene and he heard that
[31:30] prayer what was that that was Christ in
[31:33] Elijah's heart that desire to give sight
[31:35] to gazer it's God's desire to stabilize
[31:39] your life it's God's desire to give you
[31:42] sight yes sir and he opened up and he
[31:48] said they're more with us than there are
[31:51] against us it all depends on what you're
[31:54] looking at you see as the Prophet told
[31:57] us God didn't bring the Angels down
[31:59] he said the angels were always there and
[32:03] he said so is it the God that we see
[32:07] here is the God that has always been we
[32:12] said what happened
[32:13] he changed the seeing of his servant Oh
[32:18] aren't you glad for a prophetic lens you
[32:23] understand what I'm talking about it
[32:25] prophetically as I'm talking about the
[32:27] eye of God yes sir
[32:30] when the fan you remember Nathanael was
[32:33] under the tree or Nathaniel's you know
[32:38] here he was Philip went to Guinea when
[32:40] he came in the presence of the Lord
[32:41] Jesus here the Lord Jesus said well you
[32:45] know behold an Israelite in whom there's
[32:47] no guy he said Winston you know me he
[32:51] said I saw you before Philip called you
[32:54] I saw you under that tree let me just
[32:59] stop here for a minute and heavens you
[33:00] believe the Prophet said it like this
[33:03] how many times in the paralyzed and I
[33:05] don't leave those things just for prayer
[33:07] lines but I believe this means something
[33:10] to our hearts as believers when it comes
[33:13] to the promises
[33:14] god to the rapture the Prophet could say
[33:17] to that person
[33:18] he said now surely he said the God if he
[33:22] could tell me something about your past
[33:23] he said surely then that same God that
[33:27] would know something about your past
[33:29] would know your future there's only one
[33:32] who can know standing in the present and
[33:35] know the past and the future and that is
[33:38] he which was which is and which is to
[33:41] come none other than the Lord Jesus
[33:43] Christ here he is standing there and
[33:45] he's discerning the past and he lets it
[33:48] be known the future you see the reality
[33:50] it's recognizing the press and God who's
[33:54] able to discern what was and what is
[33:56] because when you can recognize that he
[33:59] already knows your number he already
[34:02] knows all about you you were chosen in
[34:05] him before the foundation of the world
[34:07] you come from God and you're going back
[34:10] to God
[34:11] hey man what is that that is the eye of
[34:14] God service after service the
[34:20] discernment of the word comes forth to
[34:23] remind us of these things to call hearts
[34:27] to warm our hearts hallelujah that same
[34:31] eye of God was there in John 4 it was a
[34:35] woman he was bound Oh mom you know she
[34:40] had had many but that day in his
[34:45] presence he looked through the eye of
[34:47] God and he was able to see her trouble
[34:50] aren't you glad that God don't do patch
[34:52] up jobs I mean I thank God that they
[34:57] fill holes out here but I hate patches
[34:59] because they're all going to be broke up
[35:01] be careful of the first snowfall freeze
[35:03] and fall be careful you know what I mean
[35:05] now I know it may not be bad so bad here
[35:08] as it is in some other countries where
[35:10] you almost have to have a bulldozer to
[35:11] get out of those roads and things but it
[35:13] gets pretty bad right I mean I know so
[35:15] I've seen some clips about Cleveland and
[35:17] things like that so for those who are in
[35:18] Cleveland be careful but but I have gone
[35:23] there
[35:24] there was a virtue that when I remember
[35:26] the woman
[35:27] who had touched him and said if I can be
[35:29] touched the hem of his garment
[35:30] there is no way that the Lord Jesus felt
[35:32] that touch in a multitude of people who
[35:35] were pulling on him but she it was her
[35:38] faith that touched him there was a
[35:41] channel that was open right there and he
[35:43] responded right back and he ministered
[35:46] right to her need and what she had need
[35:48] of was released right to her through the
[35:53] eye of God it was also him that
[35:59] perceived the thoughts of the Pharisees
[36:01] they were sent in their doubters and
[36:03] everything else come on somebody it's
[36:08] the same eye of God when the Prophet
[36:09] could stand in the platform and say I
[36:11] hear some of you saying Amen but I hear
[36:13] something beneath that that says this
[36:15] ain't nothing but scepticism come on
[36:19] somebody
[36:19] you see it's discernment it's the eye of
[36:22] God it's not coming against the people
[36:25] but it's trying to get them to realize
[36:26] your thoughts on they speak louder in
[36:30] heaven then your words do on earth
[36:33] is that right this is why the Prophet
[36:36] would give me admonition in the seals he
[36:38] said get them lined up you know that's
[36:40] the promise of God's Word
[36:41] Psalms 19 that the meditation of my
[36:44] heart and the words of my mouth would be
[36:46] acceptable in thy sight O God until your
[36:49] God is able to reconcile all those
[36:51] things together God's not God's not
[36:53] interested and you'd being a pretender
[36:55] and I'm going to tell you tonight you
[36:56] don't have to be a pretender you don't
[36:59] have to pretend about any promise these
[37:01] promises belong to you as believers you
[37:06] can just scratch down imagination catch
[37:09] the side reason it ain't about whether
[37:12] you're worthy or not he already provided
[37:15] the way and the eye of God has already
[37:17] said you are worthy I've already paid
[37:21] the price for you there's a divine
[37:23] channel that's open that God Himself
[37:26] speaks to his people through the eye of
[37:29] God to come to the Pool of Bethesda
[37:34] hallelujah the house of the seven seats
[37:37] of mercy he comes to the pool of
[37:40] and here is a man who has been bound in
[37:43] the condition for all these years and
[37:44] here they hai of God directs him you
[37:49] know brother Bram calls this godly
[37:50] compassion because human compassion
[37:53] would have healed everybody in there but
[37:55] you see what you see what's being taught
[37:57] to us these are not just phrases what's
[37:59] being taught to us is the power and
[38:01] authority that comes from the revealed
[38:04] word in our life to harness even our
[38:07] human compassion they have faith within
[38:10] that because our compassion we want to
[38:12] give everyone to give everything to
[38:14] everybody we want to heal everybody we
[38:17] want to see everybody but God is
[38:20] interested he knows who's going to
[38:22] believe his signs who's going to believe
[38:24] his wonders God knows exactly and he's
[38:27] there guiding us in that place by his
[38:30] eye because the sons of God are led by
[38:32] the Spirit of God he saw this man now
[38:38] this man you know he meant his need
[38:40] maybe wasn't as great as somebody else's
[38:42] need but it still was big your needing
[38:45] money sometimes we've had small needs
[38:47] maybe compared to other things but to us
[38:49] it's a big need but when you've got a
[38:51] need I don't care what anybody else
[38:53] thinks it's a big need but you got a big
[38:54] God and a big God made a great big
[38:57] promise that a big God will cut right
[38:58] behind and fulfills that word woo glory
[39:02] this guiding I you know when he came he
[39:06] made no bull Ram tells us that this
[39:08] guiding I was not going to be gone at
[39:11] the going of the Lord Jesus but he was
[39:13] going to send it back to the church is
[39:16] that right John 14 John 15 John 16 he
[39:19] said even when when the Spirit of Truth
[39:21] when he has come he will lead and guide
[39:23] you into all truth
[39:24] she's showing there are things that
[39:27] still the Spirit of Truth is prophetic
[39:29] the Spirit of Truth is not a past it is
[39:32] prophetic it is that which is able and
[39:35] it opens to us a channel of which we
[39:38] would never be able to see outside of
[39:40] him he's sitting back the Holy Ghost so
[39:45] hold brother BAM said I like this back
[39:47] then he sent the Holy Spirit back to the
[39:49] church tonight looks through that same
[39:51] guiding eye that guides his people to
[39:54] all true
[39:54] all of this statement I got to read this
[39:56] he said that same ah that's here tonight
[39:58] will guide us from sickness unto health
[40:01] that shall guide us from our afflictions
[40:04] to the cross that will guide us from
[40:06] affliction to good health that will
[40:08] guide us from a sinful life to a sainted
[40:11] sainted set aside life and God that same
[40:14] eye of God it's here tonight to guide
[40:17] you to whatever you've got a desire for
[40:19] you said I've got to design my heart for
[40:21] healing let me tell you something before
[40:23] you could ever have that desire there
[40:25] already had to be healing there already
[40:28] had to be that there in order for you to
[40:31] desire it but now you're aware that your
[40:34] desire is a promise that has been made
[40:37] with you in mind and all that you have
[40:40] to do is surrender yourself to God if
[40:42] you're sitting here tonight with the
[40:44] sinful eyes the eye of God is here to
[40:47] guide you from a sinful life a life of
[40:50] doubt and unbelief to a life that as a
[40:52] set of side Saint baptized with the Holy
[40:55] Ghost that same eye of God is here
[40:58] tonight whatever the need is that I have
[41:01] God is here tonight hallelujah I want
[41:07] you to listen these statements a prophet
[41:08] makes here he goes on he makes this
[41:11] statement he says lo Jesus said though
[41:14] I'm with you always even to the end and
[41:17] he said we're nearing the end then as
[41:21] Jesus confirmed that guiding I being
[41:25] with him in the days when he revealed
[41:29] himself to the Jews before the ending of
[41:32] that church age for the Jews or that
[41:36] dispensation this was confirmed in his
[41:41] ministry here the eye of God at the
[41:45] closing of the Jewish Church ages come
[41:50] on the Jewish dispensation right he
[41:53] turned from the Jews to the Gentiles is
[41:57] that right but the I've got what was
[41:59] claimed remember I do nothing but what I
[42:02] see the father doing when he said I my
[42:05] father of one
[42:07] he said you seek honor of men he said
[42:10] that I received the honor that coming
[42:12] from My Father
[42:13] he was declaring the eye of God was
[42:17] present and it was being confirmed
[42:20] because whether they could receive the
[42:22] words the works identified that the word
[42:25] was true you're right you know look what
[42:30] he says here he manifested it by looking
[42:33] through the eye of God and he's the same
[42:36] God tonight
[42:39] he still looks through the same AHA
[42:41] because Christ is the same yesterday
[42:43] today and forever he still looks through
[42:47] the hive God as he can with his grace
[42:49] and sanctifying power cleanse us and
[42:52] calls us to be sons and daughters to use
[42:54] us as vines or branches in the vine to
[42:57] still look through the out dog to see
[42:59] what has been and what will be and we
[43:03] will not walk in darkness as long as we
[43:05] look through God's eye yes I will always
[43:09] reflect his spirit here to reflect his
[43:12] word you see that's the only thing that
[43:16] like here tonight you see it's one thing
[43:20] to believe in Calvary and I believe you
[43:23] need to but the hope the whole essence
[43:27] of the ministering of the word is that
[43:31] God would be able to move aside ordained
[43:34] channels that would point you to Calvary
[43:37] to a finished work it points you you see
[43:41] what does that is the eye of God if it
[43:44] was not the eye of God you are not you
[43:47] would not even be stirred in faith but
[43:49] the eye of God coming upon that word it
[43:52] begins to deal with your heart it opens
[43:55] a channel to where you can even begin to
[43:57] think how possibly it's me
[43:59] and it begins to move a little deeper in
[44:01] the service I believe he's talking to me
[44:03] he keeps moving a little deeper I
[44:05] believe it is me he keeps doing what is
[44:07] that it's a channel that's becoming open
[44:10] the eye of God to when you're no longer
[44:13] looking at print
[44:15] you are actually by faith looking in and
[44:18] seeing what God's desire is for you and
[44:21] that desire he has for you is a desire
[44:24] that you have within your heart and your
[44:26] longing to see fulfilled it's all him
[44:34] Alleluia
[44:35] now this is where I wanna I want to dive
[44:40] in a little bit more on this here that
[44:43] he will guide us with his eye and that's
[44:46] a prophetic how that God would make
[44:49] himself known to you and I in the samoan
[44:58] church age brother brems says it like
[44:59] this and I was talking about how that
[45:02] God would set forth every agent talking
[45:06] about every Gentile age because when God
[45:11] when God dealing with the Gentiles
[45:15] notice from the Ministry of the Son of
[45:18] Man one of the things that changes a
[45:23] transition that's made is that in the
[45:27] Ministry of the Son of Man here now the
[45:30] true atonement has come on display and
[45:33] and there's a Ministry of the gospel
[45:36] going forth and God will reveal himself
[45:40] to a messenger or as we look in the Book
[45:45] of Revelations one of the stars in the
[45:47] right hands of God it also one of the
[45:50] seven lamps and revelations five before
[45:53] the throne of God one of the seven
[45:55] spirits it's the same Holy Ghost but but
[45:58] notice this this is where the dividing
[46:01] line comes that God will speak relative
[46:04] to one man in every age as the messenger
[46:07] of that age he's given the authority of
[46:10] the word where the spirit confirms
[46:12] behind it and it has that of a similar
[46:15] tool
[46:16] like that when God would visit that in
[46:18] the Old Testament he would visit Noah he
[46:21] would visit Moses he would visit them
[46:23] but under them we each time remember
[46:26] the Old Testament and the Old Testament
[46:28] prophets there was not ministries that
[46:30] came out under those Old Testament
[46:32] prophets are you with me but now here in
[46:36] the dispensation where the revealing of
[46:39] the son of man notice what comes forth
[46:42] even at his resurrection when he speaks
[46:44] there in matthew 16 he lets him know go
[46:47] you into all the world and preach this
[46:50] gospel is that right and Paul begins by
[46:54] inspiration now to go into there and
[46:57] here you find where Paul setting the
[46:59] church in order Paul begins to bring
[47:02] forth those things that were were there
[47:05] and to be able to declare that ministry
[47:08] and to preach the gospel what I what I'm
[47:10] dealing with
[47:10] here's those five ministerial gifts are
[47:13] you with me you don't find that in the
[47:16] Old Testament but here you find it in
[47:18] the New Testament and it's something
[47:20] that is pressing it's a characteristic
[47:22] to think of how after the revealing of
[47:25] the Son of Man in that day that God
[47:27] would have a min of God that he
[47:29] appointed just like he appointed the
[47:31] messengers and let me just say it like
[47:33] this before you get to putting things
[47:35] too heavy on everybody else you gotta
[47:37] recognize that just as God has a god
[47:40] ordained an appointed messenger for the
[47:42] Aged and God has ministry that will come
[47:45] under that God's got a people that's
[47:48] ordained to hear it and receive it cuz
[47:51] it's all God it's God's way it's God
[47:54] working in humility and here the Prophet
[48:00] now he takes this pattern you know
[48:02] patterns are wonderful things they allow
[48:04] you to predict things you know in every
[48:08] age but I've said like this in every age
[48:10] we have exactly the same pattern where
[48:13] the light comes through some god-given
[48:15] messenger in a certain area and then
[48:18] from that messenger there spreads the
[48:20] light through the Ministry of others who
[48:23] have been faithfully taught now notice
[48:25] this is what he said that that light
[48:28] comes through that god-given minister
[48:30] but then the ministry of others that
[48:33] like is - he is to travel is to travel
[48:36] and spread through let me just say it
[48:38] like this when
[48:39] read these things like this and know
[48:41] them I don't have to read them I can
[48:42] quote this to you but when I look at
[48:45] this right here I don't look at this as
[48:47] an elevation of person I look at this as
[48:50] a responsibility amen the eye of God is
[48:54] here a prophetic lens that we and I
[48:58] would be able to look through and that
[49:00] we come into our inheritance because in
[49:05] many of the cases remember the messenger
[49:08] even when you look at the time of Paul
[49:10] Paul himself was not even living in that
[49:13] first age but yet he was the messenger
[49:15] to it because it was the message that he
[49:19] had proclaimed and it was that message
[49:22] remember that influenced that age to
[49:25] Christ is that right so how did you
[49:28] identify Paul as the messenger it's one
[49:30] who influenced the age to Christ oh ma
[49:35] you see that this is this takes
[49:37] discernment it's recognizing what is
[49:39] influencing to Christ if there's
[49:42] something that's not influencing to
[49:44] Christ get away from it it has got to be
[49:49] influencing to cry this is why the
[49:50] Prophet would preach listen friends
[49:52] under inspiration this is not the boss
[49:54] of a man but he would labor under the
[49:57] message of influence influence of one
[50:00] another it was dealing with remember
[50:02] Isaiah was a man that was called and
[50:05] anointed by God but as long as Isaiah
[50:08] held to the skirt tails of Uzziah God
[50:11] could never use him because he never
[50:13] seen the need of the day but when he got
[50:17] in the temple that day things changed
[50:19] the Prophet said when he came into the
[50:21] temple that day things were different
[50:24] he saw the presence of God he saw the
[50:28] Train of God and brother brems said when
[50:31] Isaiah saw that he recognized the need
[50:34] of the day and when he caught the need
[50:37] of the day he recognized he was not fit
[50:41] to fulfill the need of the day where did
[50:45] he recognize this in God's presence
[50:47] where did Moses recognizing in God's
[50:50] presence when a man
[50:52] it's in God's presence he will recognize
[50:54] his insufficiency I believe us husbands
[50:59] I believe as daddies I believe as mamas
[51:01] I believe as pastors I believe as
[51:03] deacons I believe as trustees I believe
[51:05] that each and every one now batting in
[51:08] the presence of God that we can
[51:10] recognize our littleness and the
[51:12] greatness of the need that we have in
[51:14] him but the Prophet said you dip your
[51:17] zinc your something dip your finger in a
[51:19] bucket and pull it out and try to find
[51:21] the hole you put your finger in you
[51:23] can't our lives ought to be influenced
[51:29] by God himself
[51:34] you know the Bible said provoke one
[51:36] another under love and good works I
[51:38] believe that's what the preaching of the
[51:40] word does as well sometimes they may
[51:42] have to tan our hide that is provoking
[51:44] us unto love and good works you know
[51:47] what I'm saying the preaching of the
[51:48] gospel in about powdered sugar fly and
[51:50] there's some times where God has to get
[51:52] right down and correct us he has to show
[51:55] us where our shortcomings are let me
[51:57] tell you something it is time like Peter
[52:00] said that judgment must begin at the
[52:03] house of Almighty God I don't know about
[52:05] you my flesh might squirm in might shake
[52:09] but there is something within me I want
[52:11] to see more of God I want to see more of
[52:16] God I want to see more of him and I
[52:19] realize it's nobody else's problem it's
[52:22] right here if I can get this guy out of
[52:27] the way those that's been faithfully
[52:37] taught
[52:42] I'm just gonna be honest with you you
[52:46] know I think to my daddy so it was
[52:48] before he ever left I think ten many
[52:50] times I think too many times when he
[52:52] would send her and look right at me with
[52:54] things and it might have been things I
[52:56] ministered and I didn't see all the
[52:57] light on it and he would look right at
[52:59] me and he would he never he never
[53:01] blasted me but he would tell me you need
[53:03] to study more on this you need to read
[53:06] this right here you need to do this let
[53:09] me tell you something hi I think you all
[53:11] might have had it easier than me but
[53:15] there's things that he's taught me even
[53:17] before I started ministry he taught me
[53:19] on what blaze and approaches of how that
[53:21] you even study the word and you look at
[53:23] and I know it's a gift in my life let me
[53:25] tell you something those were not words
[53:27] that were coming from a man called James
[53:29] Browning that was wisdom that had been
[53:31] learned I never forget him telling me he
[53:36] said don't you ever leave the boy don't
[53:38] you ever leave the people hanging in
[53:39] judgment you always bring it around to
[53:42] grace don't you ever do that he said
[53:45] don't you ever to happen let that happen
[53:47] in my pulpit who I think I gotta I think
[53:53] all them spankings I didn't get with
[53:54] leather I got but you see even even with
[54:00] him I hated that Oh sometimes boy it
[54:03] scorched me oh my you not get quiet in
[54:05] the car
[54:05] I'd Pat like some of you I'd get quiet
[54:08] man I got my feelings hurt you know but
[54:12] I realized I needed that training I
[54:15] didn't know what for but I needed that
[54:19] training I'm glad that somebody took
[54:22] time to teach me but you know friends it
[54:25] didn't stop and end with James browning
[54:28] it had to be the same
[54:30] holy girls that revealed it to the
[54:33] Prophet that would reveal it to my heart
[54:37] do you realize we're not preaching
[54:39] things up here by just finding quotes
[54:42] and scriptures it is under the direct
[54:44] inspiration of Almighty God the eye of
[54:48] God open
[54:50] [Applause]
[54:52] faithfully taught and this is just my
[54:55] principle if I don't understand
[54:57] something and I don't see it now
[54:59] understand this there's things that win
[55:01] God it would move upon my heart
[55:03] sometimes I can look at it and say Lord
[55:05] I don't see how you're moving me but
[55:06] I'll be honest with you I really don't
[55:08] understand that right now I need your
[55:10] help but you know what even anytime that
[55:14] God is moving us into something you know
[55:18] he's gonna be right there to open the
[55:20] way God has a sense of humor you know
[55:25] that don't you
[55:29] there's some times that God only gives
[55:31] you a little bit of a phrase to preach
[55:33] from I can get up now you know I'm not
[55:37] just talking like going out other places
[55:38] I'm almost standing right here it was
[55:41] things on Sunday it was just burning out
[55:43] of a free sewing for the supernatural
[55:46] we sent you a little bit of notes of
[55:48] what we could but you know the reality
[55:50] is just what God was evil just flowing
[55:52] out from the throne of God and what I'm
[55:55] trying to say is is that being
[55:56] faithfully taught is being taught by the
[55:58] same Holy Ghost it's not just being able
[56:01] to set at the feet of some individual
[56:04] I'm telling you I think God you know God
[56:06] knows when to let your past cross around
[56:09] some of the other brethren and things
[56:11] like the head and and I thank God that
[56:12] my path even in the past few years for
[56:14] different ones it's crossed and there's
[56:16] certainly inside that they've been able
[56:18] to make known to me about things you
[56:20] know in certain parts and it's been so
[56:22] beneficial to have that understanding
[56:24] and to see that but you know it still it
[56:27] takes the Holy Ghost this statement
[56:35] right here and I've got to start trying
[56:39] to come down get my parachute on here
[56:44] this is an important statement here
[56:48] bloob em says but of course all those
[56:50] who go out don't always learn how
[56:53] necessary it is to speak only what the
[56:57] messenger has spoken
[57:01] now just as he's bringing this to me let
[57:03] me work this phrase a little bit here
[57:06] you see this is aware of how this is my
[57:10] approach when I I look at the word there
[57:13] are things when I go to studying in the
[57:15] scripture and you know now I I told you
[57:17] this I think the other day or order form
[57:18] or there's things when I are reading in
[57:20] the scripture my goodness I say I love
[57:22] my Bible more and more every day and you
[57:24] know when you're reading it there's
[57:25] things I can hear but the brem saying
[57:27] and there's things that the Holy Spirit
[57:28] is connecting it's not by my memory it's
[57:31] like a great picture that's unfolding
[57:33] and I'm standing there and saying oh my
[57:35] dear Jesus thank you Lord and you know
[57:37] it just keeps on unfolding it and things
[57:39] that are being brought together in it
[57:41] and it's him that's doing it it and you
[57:42] look at it like this there are things
[57:44] that I'll say it like this when I look
[57:47] at things within the scripture and in
[57:48] the word you know I recognize the gift
[57:52] that God has sent in this generation it
[57:55] is a prophetic gift and I'm gonna say it
[57:58] like this I know there's things where
[58:00] brother them said it this is my opinion
[58:02] on things but I want you to understand I
[58:04] will give you I will give space and
[58:07] place to his opinion I will look at all
[58:11] those things because what he is seeing
[58:13] there has to be a channel that's open up
[58:16] for him to even see things that he's
[58:19] seen and make statements I don't
[58:24] discount things sorry never have done
[58:25] that I don't do that as a matter of fact
[58:28] when there are things let me just say it
[58:29] like this when there are things that you
[58:31] might look at in the scripture and you
[58:33] can say well I see this in the scripture
[58:35] I see this in the scripture I want to
[58:37] know what didn't Malachi 4 say
[58:39] concerning that I want to know what he
[58:42] said because God did not make you to be
[58:46] an instructor God made you simply to be
[58:49] in submission to that word in this hour
[58:52] you may not see it in the scripture but
[58:55] if you'll just wait on the Lord
[58:58] he shall renew thy strength if you'll
[59:01] just wait on him there is a channel that
[59:05] the Prophet is calling from I could say
[59:10] that even in years pass but I know that
[59:12] to be the truth right now even there's
[59:15] things that can be said here right now
[59:16] that I may not go through the whole
[59:18] thing I may not go through the whole
[59:19] scripture where this is from but where
[59:21] it's at in the message but when you are
[59:23] read within the message not that you
[59:25] remember every single thing but when you
[59:27] are read meaning you are acquainted and
[59:30] becoming more and more acquainted with
[59:33] the person of Christ who is revealed in
[59:37] this word then you will recognize him to
[59:47] recognize and speak only what the
[59:50] messenger has spoken that's important
[59:57] it's important because if not the church
[1:00:00] gets in a lot of trouble yes sir it's to
[1:00:04] stay with that it's not listen let me
[1:00:06] tell you some friends even though people
[1:00:08] on in this hour there's one part I think
[1:00:10] the info base is a good thing but I
[1:00:12] think at the same time heaven they
[1:00:13] infobase some things like a it's made
[1:00:15] people that don't even have a gift in
[1:00:17] their life they've study themselves
[1:00:18] right in holes and knots and everything
[1:00:20] else you know why it's not called to
[1:00:22] divide to write the Word of God they're
[1:00:26] not called to that that is not even
[1:00:28] something in my flesh that is given by
[1:00:30] God Joshua could not do it when he
[1:00:34] wanted to do it
[1:00:35] he was just an instrument of which when
[1:00:38] the inspiration struck it came forth so
[1:00:43] this doesn't remember a gift is not
[1:00:45] prying into things there's a lot of
[1:00:49] things I hate to say it there's a lot of
[1:00:51] stuff that I've seen it's trash on the
[1:00:52] internet and hadn't been stuff that
[1:00:54] slammed brother Brandon I'm not talking
[1:00:56] about that you know that stuff's garbage
[1:00:57] you shouldn't even be around that kind
[1:00:59] of trash because what kind of faith is
[1:01:01] that going to build in your life come on
[1:01:04] friends ain't none of them in their life
[1:01:06] got any vindication
[1:01:08] come on now no vindication in their
[1:01:11] lives but Almighty God the angel the
[1:01:14] Lord never came down once in their life
[1:01:16] and said a man to their life look where
[1:01:21] they're leading people straight to hell
[1:01:24] what is it death and ancora that has
[1:01:27] rose up and the Bible says stay away
[1:01:32] from the tents of those wicked men I
[1:01:38] don't care how good they are I don't
[1:01:40] care if they're sweet as honey if they
[1:01:42] stand against God's Word in this hour
[1:01:44] but reveal truth and His Messenger they
[1:01:47] are no fit to associate with the truth
[1:01:58] it's God's Word remaining faithful to
[1:02:02] his word but I've seen a lot of other
[1:02:04] things where men have posted stuff that
[1:02:06] they had no business posting brother
[1:02:08] Samuel why don't you write him and tell
[1:02:10] him to take it down why to argue I'm not
[1:02:15] what I refuse to waste my time and argue
[1:02:17] with anybody
[1:02:18] I refuse that if a person wants to argue
[1:02:22] over something we're not arguing we are
[1:02:25] not debating we're standing on the word
[1:02:28] I don't have time for that nonsense
[1:02:32] there is a rapture there are people of
[1:02:35] God sheep of God who deserve the
[1:02:38] Ministry of the Holy Spirit that they
[1:02:40] might grow I refuse to do it it's
[1:02:52] important to say only what the messenger
[1:02:54] has spoken
[1:02:56] I know there's a balance to this and I
[1:03:01] need to balance this as I close you see
[1:03:07] there's lives and heart there's people
[1:03:09] to say well you know brother Bram didn't
[1:03:12] preach out of this chapter so you
[1:03:13] shouldn't preach out of that chapter you
[1:03:15] didn't preach out at the brother Ram
[1:03:16] didn't preach out of this chapter
[1:03:17] you shouldn't preach out of this chapter
[1:03:18] see what's being miss missed by what he
[1:03:20] said right here what's being messed
[1:03:23] missed is the unfolding of the character
[1:03:26] of Christ do you realize the whole trail
[1:03:29] of the serpent was exposed this is the
[1:03:34] full book of redemption the Bible the
[1:03:37] Bible he didn't say certain chapters he
[1:03:39] didn't say certain scriptures he said
[1:03:41] the Bible has become a brand-new book to
[1:03:44] us who is it that could open these
[1:03:48] things that things that the Prophet
[1:03:50] himself would have said back there I'll
[1:03:52] tell you he wasn't out of a man it was
[1:03:54] God that spoke right through that
[1:03:56] kentucky voice hello hey man it gives
[1:04:04] understanding to our lives
[1:04:05] we're not forces we're not mules that
[1:04:08] are led about with no understanding but
[1:04:10] the eye of God is present in this hour
[1:04:13] that we might know because the Bible is
[1:04:16] clear we're living in the hour what
[1:04:18] Daniels prophecy that was revealed to
[1:04:21] him as unfolding and he said they that
[1:04:23] know their God shall do great exploits
[1:04:29] [Applause]
[1:04:30] that word exploits means acts of heroism
[1:04:38] mama this is good and there's more
[1:04:46] brother Branham referred because when
[1:04:48] you look at I speak only what the
[1:04:49] messenger spoke I want you to think this
[1:04:52] I'm not gonna get to that tonight so
[1:04:54] we'll just I'll just pop that off I'm
[1:04:58] still gonna cover it but let's just look
[1:04:59] at this and Joshua chapter 1 remember
[1:05:02] what God advised Joshua he told him be
[1:05:05] careful and mindful to observe all the
[1:05:07] law to do according to all that Moses
[1:05:09] okay is that right he admonished him him
[1:05:13] that right there so within this here
[1:05:16] comes Joshua as as he stepping forward
[1:05:20] and remember now Joshua is aware that
[1:05:25] the angel of the Lord is in the camp
[1:05:28] he's aware of that
[1:05:30] he's aware that the angel of the Lord
[1:05:32] did not go when Moses the servant of the
[1:05:36] Lord win because remember it was God who
[1:05:40] said I will send mine angel before thee
[1:05:44] to keep the in the way all right to
[1:05:49] guide the and bring the in through the
[1:05:52] place that I have prepared for thee so
[1:05:56] he was aware that the angel of the Lord
[1:05:58] is still in the camp come on somebody
[1:06:02] so here Joshua goes out and he goes out
[1:06:06] and he begins to meditate and Joshua is
[1:06:08] out here now as it comes around for
[1:06:11] Jericho there is a battle plan that has
[1:06:14] unfolded for Jericho now listen to me
[1:06:16] now you're not going to find that word
[1:06:18] for word within that of the law of Moses
[1:06:22] you're not there's nowhere if Joshua
[1:06:25] came back to the camp and they said
[1:06:26] Joshua you tell us right now
[1:06:28] where did Moses say this about Jericho
[1:06:30] where did Moses say go around seven
[1:06:33] times where did Moses say not the walls
[1:06:35] would fall so you see there's a right
[1:06:40] way to apply this statement what it was
[1:06:43] God told Joshua be fairly acquainted
[1:06:47] with my personal be thoroughly
[1:06:50] acquainted with me because you're gonna
[1:06:53] have needs you're gonna need to be led
[1:06:55] you're gonna need to be God and this
[1:06:58] word will make you know of the
[1:07:00] characteristic and the image as it
[1:07:03] continues to unfold you will see my
[1:07:07] guide you for your life so when he went
[1:07:11] back for the battle-plan of Jericho he
[1:07:13] was staying with the law of Moses he was
[1:07:17] saying what Moses said because you know
[1:07:22] know why Moses has said under authority
[1:07:24] by God I will bring you out of a land
[1:07:26] and I will bring you unto a land and I
[1:07:29] will drive them out why didn't God spell
[1:07:34] it out sometimes he wants you to get to
[1:07:36] where you need to get and then he'll
[1:07:37] open up and let you know what he wants
[1:07:39] you to do when you get there listening
[1:07:46] looking through the prophetic lens I
[1:07:56] just I just feel pressed in my heart
[1:07:59] when these things to begin to bring
[1:08:03] those things to you and looking into
[1:08:06] these things that belong to us our
[1:08:08] promises looking through that prophetic
[1:08:12] eye I believe it's very important that
[1:08:15] we're staying right in step with the
[1:08:17] word now staying in step with the word
[1:08:19] the prophets very clear he said that'll
[1:08:21] mean getting ahead of it he said you let
[1:08:23] the word be ahead of you and then you
[1:08:25] follow behind it always put the word
[1:08:27] first David said I have put the Lord
[1:08:29] always before me put it always before
[1:08:33] him and he'll lead you to the place that
[1:08:35] he has is that right that's a promise
[1:08:39] it meant these are your promises
[1:08:42] whatever that you have need of tonight
[1:08:44] the eye of God has been speaking to our
[1:08:47] hearts he did this right here as him
[1:08:52] taking a servant and moving him out of
[1:08:56] the side and to speak to our hearts upon
[1:08:58] these things that you and I can see I
[1:09:01] can move from here to here
[1:09:04] how do I get from here to here that I've
[1:09:07] God guides you well how do I get from
[1:09:11] here to here it's not a jump it's not a
[1:09:13] job it's a walk and before you can make
[1:09:17] that first step here in your heart you
[1:09:20] surrender there's a step then it deals
[1:09:25] with your heart surrender is a step that
[1:09:27] is a step then it's a step you know what
[1:09:30] he's doing he's guiding you because
[1:09:34] every step you make when you make it by
[1:09:36] faith let me tell you something he
[1:09:38] maketh your feet like Hinds feet yes sir
[1:09:42] so they're dug in not sliding back but
[1:09:46] they're going forward aren't you glad I
[1:10:05] tell you when I look at someone I look
[1:10:07] at many many things you know when I'm
[1:10:10] talking with my boys family you knows
[1:10:15] things that by the grace of God when I'm
[1:10:17] looking at things and we're talking
[1:10:19] going through things I point out things
[1:10:22] I look we look at things in the
[1:10:23] scriptures because there's things that
[1:10:24] pertain to their life and where they're
[1:10:26] at right now maybe something they have
[1:10:28] on their heart and they were there
[1:10:29] talking about it and I can by this by
[1:10:32] the grace of God we can go and look at
[1:10:34] this and say now this situation see this
[1:10:37] here unfolded in the word right here
[1:10:39] this is to minister to you on this
[1:10:41] situation and the Prophet said this here
[1:10:43] regarding this remember brother Branham
[1:10:44] said this year you see where all these
[1:10:46] things is bringing it together it's the
[1:10:48] authority of the word you understand
[1:10:50] it's bringing the authority of the word
[1:10:53] now you can look at that and say what
[1:10:55] bill sent me that's because you've got a
[1:10:57] gift in your life I told you this weeks
[1:10:59] ago I believe that every daddy
[1:11:01] I believe that momma's
[1:11:06] you know how the Lord took us here on
[1:11:08] Sunday it was mothers that were sowing
[1:11:11] seeds
[1:11:11] it was fathers that was sowing seeds and
[1:11:14] I believe with all of my heart he said
[1:11:16] that he would bring all things to our
[1:11:18] remembrance when we had need of it now
[1:11:22] you mean to tell me that that son of my
[1:11:23] woman you know I can't get away from
[1:11:25] that story I can't get away from that
[1:11:27] that black sister in Memphis I cannot
[1:11:29] get away from it a matter of fact I was
[1:11:31] praying about it today and had a spill
[1:11:33] she she just didn't read the Bible like
[1:11:37] a newspaper brother her she read it and
[1:11:40] she said this is me and there was a need
[1:11:44] that arose when her son there were you
[1:11:46] know what that was there had to be
[1:11:48] something she could recall this is what
[1:11:50] I'm trying to tell you there's got to be
[1:11:52] something that's set forth it's not an
[1:11:54] earthly knowledge but how can they know
[1:11:56] if it's not being taught they say how
[1:12:00] can you know the promises that belong to
[1:12:02] you if they're not being taught is that
[1:12:07] right how can you know what to pray for
[1:12:10] faith for it in just things that dropped
[1:12:12] out of osmosis in the Bible that be read
[1:12:15] on Sunday how can they hear except the
[1:12:18] preacher go
[1:12:20] so the promises have got to be made
[1:12:22] known through the people of God and if
[1:12:27] she stood that day
[1:12:28] well my momma she said Lord
[1:12:33] she said eyes that Shunammite woman she
[1:12:38] recognized the need in her home she saw
[1:12:42] it in Scripture hallelujah
[1:12:47] Gloria this one felt bored in Sunday
[1:12:50] school this was word flesh ha ha Gloria
[1:12:54] she said eyes that shooting of my woman
[1:12:57] where's your Elijah
[1:13:00] allelujah she didn't know one thing
[1:13:05] about brother Ronald she didn't know
[1:13:07] anything about him all she knew is that
[1:13:11] she was standing there and there was a
[1:13:13] need and she found her need and found it
[1:13:16] there in the promise and she said where
[1:13:18] is your Elisha you can find yourself in
[1:13:24] the word tonight and you can ask God who
[1:13:27] made the promise to say Lord I'm not one
[1:13:31] in need tonight Lord come to my address
[1:13:39] Jesus I'll open the door let's go inside
[1:13:43] Lord hallelujah
[1:13:47] he loved him tonight grow to be the God
[1:13:51] my feels so good I'm glad
[1:13:56] let me tell you something I didn't say
[1:13:59] nothing to him back there tonight he
[1:14:00] came back here to pray with me as they
[1:14:02] always do he started praying in there I
[1:14:04] don't want you remember when you were
[1:14:05] praying he began to talk about he said
[1:14:08] Lord I just finished today listening to
[1:14:10] a message the eye of God God's eye and
[1:14:16] he began talking about it in prayer I
