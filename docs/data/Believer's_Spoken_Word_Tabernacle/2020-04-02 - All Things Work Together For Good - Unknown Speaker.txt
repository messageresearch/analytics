you just come Lord and just perform your good work speak to our hearts Lord in every place Lord tonight may you come Lord God bring deliverance to the crafted law and pray that God you bring healing Lord by its Lord may you feel with your spirit Lord I'm through give ourselves to name of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you we want to invite you right into the word of the Lord into Romans chapter eight and I'm just gonna read just a few verses of Scripture to get started with your tonight and you want to say it just just a real privilege and an honor to be able to get together and certainly the enemy at first wanted to try to hinder that with the video but we appreciate you hanging on there and we just love you in the Lord and certainly miss each and every one of you but I'm thankful we can have these times together around the word of the Lord for he is our strength and this is where we find our expectation is in him so we want to look just at three verse of scripture here tonight in verse 26 of Romans 8 it says likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose Amen may God bless you as you're being seated I just in looking at the scripture here of verse 28 but within the context of all of Romans 8 just thought really pulsating in my heart here for a few weeks and looking at this scripture just as the Lord just bring it to my attention and these are familiar scriptures that we all know up but you know it's in times where the Holy Spirit II have come and he well just quicken to us in those times as we have need of it and so we look at it in the scripture and I want to just take a little thought on all things work together for good and certainly not that all things are good that's not what the scripture is saying but it works together for our good so in every part of it when we look at it and many times I always look at this scripture and forgive me for my food parallels but I look at it in this way I like you know I love apple crisp but just to have a cup of oats is not Apple crisps neither is just to have a cup of brown sugar or just to have apples but all of those together when you put them together and then you put them under some heat then will come out a finished product but it takes all of the parts working together there's a lot of things that we experience have experienced in our life that we cannot say was good that can be even from drawing from the sense of our own decisions that we have made which were bad decisions but God through His mercy will work as we submit to him to bring forth and move and bring things back into his will and then there are things that even though here we would be in the perfect will of God but there are things that are not good but yet God will take circumstances and takes things and God will use it for his purpose and his glory and so the scriptures are clear here that it's not for everybody that all things work together for the good but the scripture is clear that it's to them that love God so it's to be sure that you love the Lord but the RAM would tell us he said many times people can even get into nervous breakdowns and other things he said because they try to study so much and try to figure out God he said when they aren't you come back to the first principle fall in love with him just yield yourself to him commit yourself to him and go to work everything out God has not entrusted it to you or I to try to work everything out or even to try to make sense of everything of even of all that we have available to us or before us and so everything works together for good to them that love God to them that are called according to his purpose so it is in in very important to have that solid that you love the Lord that the love of God is working in your heart and you when you have the love of God working in your heart and to know with that that God does not give his love or the Holy Spirit God does not give that to them who don't obey Him he gives it to those who do obey Him he gives it to those in whom he for knew who he saw remember the coming of the Holy Spirit is the outworking of redemption that was from the mind of God God already knew even in the conditions that you and I would be in even here tonight and even give you would be setting at home or maybe you're at work or somewhere and listening to the service God knew exactly where you would be and to think that this word that God is given for this night is not by chance it is directed and orchestrated under the very mind of Almighty God you and I are here upon this earth and we are merely the actors a part of a great play that has already been laid out before the foundation of the world we are here only to take and accept the cues from the Holy Spirit just like you know at one time I in a play I wasn't in the play I never liked being in front of people my mind's eye would forget my words so I didn't want to do that so I know God has a sense of humor but I I so I ran the lights I stayed over on the side and I had to look when someone so says this changed this light color and do this and do that and so all of those things I had I changing the lights had to notice cues as much as them as the actors that were coming on the stage they had to be alert to what was being said to know when it was time for them to step on so they were accused everybody was waiting upon cues to come forth to know when their part was to be acted out I'm glad that the one giving the cues is not that of a man but is God God has laid out made clear for you and I in this hour we would be looking at the script in this hour and wondering what's to take place in this hour we could be looking at the script and say I should we pray for America to have a revival but you see the Spirit of God through that of his promised word where he said had behold as send unto you elijah the prophet god notice he inspired that word it's called who gives the cue and here God sends a prophet with eyes that is able to declare the promises of this age to everyone else to many it means nothing to many it was just no more than a man that had a great healing ministry but remember the healing ministry was only the beginning there was a message that was to follow it because any ministry there's many that have healing ministry there are many miracles and things I think even of my dad witnessed you know taking place and things and we know that the bride let me just say to you like this the bride is not the only only place where there are miracles taking place where there's healings but I will say there here it is the only place in Christ Jesus where there is going to be a rapture and man God has sent a message to you and I to come out of the system and remember any healing that continues on healing campaign or whatever it is if it continues in the same old system it might be that of a blessing but you know that it's not God calling his people out so God has made known to you and had by His grace the script the program in this hour and leader said to you that without the Holy Ghost the message itself is no more than to a person and they're trying to look how does this fit with the scripture but remember when the Holy Spirit is come it reveals and unfolds the kingdom of God then your has become quickened to be able to see your day and it's message there then becomes an inspiration upon our lives for you and I to be able to recognize that we are a part of it and this is the program of God God is not here to further the programs our man the programs a man they always fail man can never stand in the prints of God with a man-made program but when it is the program of God and the program of God is none other than the Holy Ghost that is come through and by from the shed blood of the Lamb that is God's program you must be born again then the message becomes a living reality then it becomes a script to you and I it becomes part that we're waiting on the great one to give us the unction and the pulsation of the Holy Spirit this is why the Prophet would teach us and say pay attention to the pulsation of the spirit so we recognize that even in the midst of it - - look here in the scriptures here of how that all things are working together for the good we know that not everything is good we certainly cannot say where we are setting right now that this virus is good there is nothing good about this virus but yet in the midst of it through and by as God remember I want you to keep this in mind if I get to it today tonight or now but I want you to keep it in mind safe and has not pulled a fast one on God at any time remember Satan can only move and work as God permits and remember the question could always it's a question that you know I've had people ask and not people outside it but I've had people you know at times over the years you get around in a conversation and said well why couldn't God have bypassed all of this but remember inside of God were attributes to be expressed you could not have bypassed courting engagement and marriage if you did you did it wrong you can't bypass that and then expect to have children it is all to come through the right the right channels the right pathway and then the attribute that already lays within you when everything comes in its right bedding ground it will actually come forth so we recognize these attributes that God had within him of Savior Redeemer of Shepherd of deliver all a provider every one of these attributes remember there was to be released or to be expressed God did me to tell you this Todd don't want to just tell you about it he wants to express it you don't want to G don't want you and I just to know I'm sure I'm a savior he wants you to know by divine expression in your life I'm a savior to where you have that experience of that Express attribute in your life to say no he's my Savior I once was lost but now I'm found God delights in expressing his attributes but remember from the beginning we see where the fall had taken place Satan come in and through deceit he deceived that of the woman here is Adam standing there and Adam remember the Bible says in the book of Timothy that the man was not deceived but the woman remember the woman was deceived you see it speaks even woman speaks of the church there has to be the man come because it's the man who is the life carrier the man who's the life carrier the seat carrier the name carrier it must be the man part come because he's the one that imparts the life under the church that the church might be a reflection of his own life and he can say she is bone of my bone flesh of my flesh she is me it requires the man part so within it do we find her Adam's step forward in order to redeem to take to take that upon himself but yet God had made provision and said I will make a way back but God even though this had taken place God never had to stop and rethink and say oh my what am I going to do when he asked him what have you done it is not God trying to figure out the situation caught already he already had knowledge of all of this now it's a time for the expression of the attributes that were already laying within him the only thing that the fall did was begin to release the further unfolding of those attributes right there to his children so when we think of it God foreknew the church gone already he already saw the church he foreknew the plan everything was set in order when you and I we have the scriptures but to recognize that the scriptures themselves the Bible tells us that holy men of God spake as they were moved upon by the Holy Spirit we recognize that this of the what we call of the what we have and we declare this is the Bible the holy script is to recognize as Paul would tell Timothy all Scripture is inspired and we recognize that it's the inspiration of God that has come down and God has expressed it where men have been moved by the Spirit of God to pick up their pin and the assembling of this and this is God's mind to be declared and unfolded even to where when the Lord Jesus come the Lord Jesus his mind was not in a place of or what do I do next time oh this prophecies here and oh of the prophet Isaiah said this and the prophet Jeremiah said this and Oh what should I do let me put this together let me put this together oh is this the time should I feel it well I don't know no you know what the Lord Jesus exemplified or showed what a real believer and let me say it clearly he showed what the bride would be at the end time where to have the unfolding of the mysteries of God to have that of the mysteries that which had been sealed up where had been lost but now the loose ends tied together and for the church to be alerted to the oncoming judgment he never entrusted it or left it that we would have to figure it out although we have this quote we have this statement we have this statement tying in with the scriptures but we have the rest and the peace of the Holy Ghost to know he's the one that brought this message together and he's the one that's overseeing the work he is Jehovah Jireh it is him that is supply oh that you and I have meet up when we have need of it for the change of our bodies it'll be there so it's had in mind this is why then you know we're brother Ram could say he's working all things together for the good to them that love him how can you lose you can't lose he said there's no way of losing and he said if the church can just find that place in Christ to recognize he said every child that comes to God there's temptations he said their shadows their spheres but just don't get all tore up about it and he deals with we know that when troubles come I think sometimes we're all too good at this and we should examine but you know there comes a place through the examination in our life there are times that God will people will permit sickness to bring correction to our lives and there are times he does that but there's other times sickness comes and it has nothing to do with correction and so it's us trying to either find out but to understand this here the reason that I believe we can look at this even here tonight I'm talking about solid ground I'm talking of these things here in the scriptures this is ground that we need to be standing on when you're facing these situations and whatever else would come our way we need to have a solemn rest and ground that we are standing on in the Lord to know that we are not losers we are winners we cannot lose in Christ so to recognize that sometimes God will allow sickness or other things to come our way and he does that in order sometimes when it's not for correction sometimes the sickness will come our way God permits it I want you understand it did not happen by chance be even the me just felt like this the coronavirus was not because he was sleeping he said he never slumbers nor sleeps it wasn't because God mr. memo come on somebody god knew about that these are reminders this is not our home that is the result from the fall in the beginning it became a pothole for a sickness disease all unbe everything to enter in but thanks be to God when you and I were without a way to get out of this God came down there was a space between us and God in that loop we would call eternity but yet there was a space within it brother Raman call it like a little Hickey that was in there it was kind of laying down in there but here when God came down and became one of us it was through the man Christ Jesus of whom we had no other mediator but him and through him by the all-sufficient sacrificial death and sending back the Holy Ghost brother what took place in his life were God and man met together heavens and earth hugged and kissed that's the same thing when the Holy Ghost comes upon our life it's that which ties us back in to that rest of God to know there is nothing that cannot lose I am a winner this is our anchor now notice Romans 8:29 let's go a little bit further for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren hallelujah all glory you know we recognize I know these words aren't maybe the most there's some that have problems with these words but I didn't write this but it ain't about they no problem with writing this this is dealing with that God is not running a haphazard program he has come for a purpose the Bible opens up in the book I believe it's in the Book of Luke he all the way through the scripture but just to take this place he had come to save his people from their sin there was his mind remember his covenant he was there is here for a purpose as he was here for redemption and to redeem means to bring back what rightfully belongs to you you see the struggle oh let me preach it the struggle is not with God the struggle is upon us but God through and by the sending forth of his light of his word but clouds of badness that can clutter the thinking from recognizing who you are the amnesia that can go through your life were you wondering am i a part of this I hear about this or the message I've been raised in it or what have you go how am I am I a part of this but you see Y all you have to do is get in his presence and his presence begins to deal with your life what's he doing he's coming to remove the spiritual amnesia that's upon your life that you might remember what remember and recognize who you are and that you are always a son and daughter of God you are always in God's mind what's taking place the inspiration is telling upon that life and God remember that many times I understand many people make an ugly thing out of predestination God don't the scriptures don't the message don't people do they want to put it as though they don't have to do nothing and God's all of a sudden gonna pull - do and God will do this what it says this right here it's just this simple if there's something in your life and you are a part of the program of God then the coming of the Holy Spirit it'll draw you you cannot remain in sin and unbelief rather how could you take a magnet through this building tonight and if there are things that are that are material that is made to come together with that magnet how could you pass that magnet through this building and those pieces not come together unless they're bolted down let me tell you if you're bolted down there's one here tonight that can make known the release to your life Alleluia is not a pass for knowledge and predestination ties in to the new birth it becomes our life our life becomes a reflection of his choosing Oh glory that he might be though we might be what conformed to the image of his dear son what is that it's restoring back to falling image that holy image of God that left him there in the beginning now through the Holy Spirit remember it comes back to quicken that seed that life it raises up the image of the Son of God this is why Paul would say in Galatians 1 when it pleased him who separated me from my mother's womb when he chose to reveal his son in me you see it is not a different life jesus said the works that I do shall you do also you can't put the life of Christ inside of a person and didn't they live lonely that's not the life of Christ but when the life of Christ comes on the inside I'm talking about deeper than the flesh deeper than the spirit I'm talking about a real word birth brother down on the inside that changes that old nature it makes a new creature in Christ Jesus out of you then we're getting to the image of God so here the scripture goes on to say moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified you see these scriptures it's declaring to you and I as the Prophet would take the scripture and he said in God's mind it's a finished work he said in God's mind you're already a finished product I'm named the Bible tells us revelation 13:8 her name was wrote in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world is that right it's God's spoken word it's his thinking and so what is taking place here remember whatever his thoughts are remember words our thoughts Express so God has expressed his word and remember he's not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent I don't care how bleak how dark remember what God said in the beginning he's never had another word he is not gonna take back anyway but he has come to fulfill his word Oh glory be to God after the fall he didn't start speaking new words this was the unfolding of the word of who he is of what he expressed as the Bible takes us there in John 1 he is unfolding his thoughts and this is why but brother Branham would tell us he said this is God's seed materializing it's his word coming down so to think that within this this is why we must have the light of God to flash across our pathway it illuminates our life it begins to illuminate you know you take you in a room of darkness you take where there's darkness surrounds your life and what happens when somebody has a little bit of light you say hey turn that back on you see you mean that light because the light itself in May gives you a little glimmer you recognize not only of all your surroundings but you begin to recognize and realize the darkness and just how dark the dark is when when that light is flashed that light has flashed for that to catch the attention of those whom he foreknew are you with me so this is just say it very clearly we are a finished work in the presence of God but God brings that reflection down into earth God already sees us alright he already glorified but he met but he must bring that reflection of what he has known what he has already declared and seen before there were atoms Stardust or molecule he must bring it down in to be reflected in this earth you see character is molded as all things work together they work together to them that love God to them that are called according to his purpose our character is being molded and God brings every word to pass so we are a part in that word then God must bring every word to pass I want you to think of this for a moment there were many prophecies that were laid out in the time of the coming of the Messiah many prophecies that were laid out and you had that there was an elect group down through the ages that they were offering the lamb with a revelation they couldn't explain everything but there was a real let me just say it like this it wasn't just something that they were doing it was more than them just being good people thank God for good people but it was something more than that their life was so taken by the revelation of that it unfolded in their lives to where you read from Abraham's life Reno's life on and on to where when that revelation came to them what you see is that became their life it gave them life in the midst of the condition and their whole life revolved around that that revelation of Christ in that generation became the center of all things to them and all of their life revolved around it and so notice all of his words has to come to pass all of the words what we're reading here what God has already saw concerning you and I it has to come to pass in the plant think of this now even in the part where you and I are to act out and to play out even here in the end time there were people who were were there think of this now there were people there that remember there had been they had been looking for the first coming out they have been looking for the coming of the Lord the coming of the Messiah and they knew with that they had the promise of Joel to write the outpouring of the Holy Ghost they were looking for that and notice when the disciples even after the crucifixion they themselves did not a firmly catch what was going on even when they were looking at John the Baptist they said why did the scribes and Pharisees say that Elias must come first you see they knew about John they had been around John's ministry but they didn't recognize who John was but you notice the scribes and Pharisees they themselves they knew that same scripture but it was not inspired to them because they could walk right up to John and asked who he was he said I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness he identified himself prepare you the way of the Lord from Isaiah into that of Malachi and even when he identified the word that has been quickened to his life they could not receive it but when Jesus took that moment and it was unfolded it was not flesh and blood unfolding it it was the inspiration of the Holy Spirit that was given as Jesus said it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom it unfolded to them the time that they were living in did they understand all the other parts they did not but when it came time for them to be in a position the Holy Spirit which we know this is not the third person of God hey man it's the same Jesus amen the same God revealed is that right all the way down and to know that he brought everything together when they were walking on the road to Emmaus and said how we thought he was the one we found you know he should have been the Redeemer and and this and that and you see they at that time the scriptures were not tied together for them that's why they were still wandering around sad hearted and down but when he came according to his promise you see before those scriptures could be unfolded that Fairs had to be a fulfilling of the scriptures of the Resurrection and once those scriptures were fulfilled then he could unlock the mystery that they themselves were in darkness amnesia was about their life he could unlock the scriptures and when he unlocked the scriptures it gave direction for their life it gave leadership they were no longer Peter was no longer just let's go fishing it was no longer let's go away from Jerusalem once the scriptures were unlocked they made their way back to Jerusalem why because it was promised there at Jerusalem that he would pour out his spirit and as they were there waiting on the spirit to come amen according to the Word of God everything was being fulfilled in its time even for them in their journey it was a Sabbath day's journey to get back they couldn't get there too early could not get there too late everything God had laid it out even in the fulfillment of the feast that take place the the Feast of the Messiah the feasts that are was in Israel the Feast of the Lord remember they each had their chosen and appointed times it was not up to man to get himself in position it was God who would move upon the heart of the individual and the in vidual would submit and you and come into position when God comes to fulfill his word we cannot fulfill it but let us get in the place by the unction of the Holy Ghost that God can come and fulfill his word well glory be to God now to think he was the promised Jesus told him in Matthew 24 he told him there in Matthew 24 picks it up in Luke picks it up there you know and let them know about the oncoming destruction what's going to hit in Jerusalem pray that your flight be not in the winter they're alerted to this that doesn't take place to 70 AD come on now that's that's already well into the first church age the first church age didn't start till 33 AD are you with me now there's been a lot of things that have even happened like we preached on a few weeks ago the famine struck Indra in Judea and Jerusalem in that time before that encompass 'men of type Titus and the besiegement but remember before Titus could take Jerusalem there had to come forth the sealing angel and to seal according to Ezekiel 9 he had to seal those of God's chosen who themselves we're walking and waiting and looking to the Lord a separated life from the rest of the world you see God moves them into that place I know this is very simple but I believe if we can understand this in this is all in continuity the inspiration it strikes my heart with these scriptures of Romans 8 you say what does that be inspiration is this is the rest of God it is not you and I trying to get in position or trying to put ourselves in position or as brother Branham would tell us don't make yourself odd now we've seen enough of that over the years they don't need to make ourselves odd just be a simple believer that is available to God and waiting on the unction of the Holy Spirit just as much as the Prophet could say in his time he said there been people putting charts together here and charts together and charge together there I'm not against charts but don't let your faith be anchored in a chart you let your faith rest in the workmanship of the Holy Spirit because remember it is the quickening power of God that alerts us andin quickens us to the word in our season what brings every word to pass you know you know listen let make this dramatized a little bit I wonder if there are times where there wasn't different things that they could see and they would say ah you know you know Jesus spoke of this you know Daniel had spoke of these things and they're looking you know as believers you're looking because why as believers they have a comfort in knowing God has spoken through this is that right Jesus when Peter was speaking there before all the Pharisees and Sadducees he said I spoke of Jesus of Nazareth a man whom was confirmed with signs and wonders following which God did through him is that right it was a confirmation of the word that God had given in that hour but to recognize that even when things would take place it was not up to the believers to try to say oh let me see this I wonder if this is what Jesus was saying right here it could have been they looked when maybe they see you know an army or different ones but you see there was the Holy Spirit you see this is why the church is not under the leadership of a man the church is under the leadership of the Holy Spirit is to stay in tune with him this is why God did not pick it her back in a way to say or go ask your pastor if you can listen to this go ask your pastor if you can sing this glass your pastor if you can do this God did not make the pastor to be the Holy Ghost of the Assembly in the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost God has sent forth the Holy Ghost that he might reside in the hearts of his people and that is a real absolute in the heart a real thinking man's filter back to my point bring in his word to pass you see we are part of that world that was spoke we're part of this in time word we have a responsibility the ending of Hebrews 11 they without us should not be made perfect there is a completion there is a fulfillment that is to come forth out of this lady will see an aged word God will bring forth a bride that stands as an overcomer he made a promise in this age to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I overcame and him set down in my father's room you see it's not us trying to make things happen most of you you know me you know me before I was pastor but you know me after I've been pastor you even know might you many of you know my ways you know my approach how many things that you've you've been under the ministry and you also know even the character of how I approach certain things and I never I get where I get leery is when people start trying to put things together that's where I get leery when people start trying to put things together and match this together you say brother Samuel why are you saying that because one thing about it this is what I've always found I've never preached a message that I had to put together I've never had to do that but I can preach a message that he brings together a lot of the things he'll bring together at first when they're bringing it sometimes it'll take me a day or so or whatever more because sometimes the way it comes I can't even see how it's coming together nor how does this plan together what's the fluidity of the thought how does this come together sometimes I can't even understand that it's not just me it's every minister you'll get a thought here you grabbed at fault here and you think well well maybe this is for another time maybe this for another time and so you just leave it yet you're feeling the inspiration for these thoughts right now and yet it seems like well that there ain't nothing else that I'd have to say except read that scripture and say blessed be the name of the Lord let's stand and pray and you feel like Lord but there's something in it that God is wanting to unfold or unpack leadership for our lives at this moment and when all of a sudden the Lord begins to bring that together sometimes he don't even do it before I'm standing up here sometimes they don't come all together til I'm standing right here but that's the way he does it now maybe for you you wouldn't know know about that but you know what God does that for who for me he wants to teach me sometimes that hey I want you to rely completely on me and so I thank God for it even though I'm a nervous wreck in the middle of it but you notice he brings every word to pass man I'm trying to go on here he brings every word to pass think of this here it is time where there's already been a lot of things going on with Mary and Joseph remember what has taken place Joseph is questioning Mary he's questioning what has taken place he annoying it Joseph is such a man where we could preach a whole service on Joseph Joseph Joseph is such a man the Bible would call him an honorable man why was he an honorable man because he didn't go around and run among people and say I don't know what I'm praying about I I just want you to know that this right here you know Mary Mary said since she's expecting and you know I don't know but would you help me pray about this woman he was an honorable man he did not disclose those things that would have hindered or would have called others to look down on Mary preach brother Samuel thank you out there he did not do that he was an honorable man brother Bram would say like this he became her shield are you with me you see this is where we are one another's keeper hey men its we're home I let me go on let me preach so here all of this has taken place and notice all of this a word you would think God fulfilling a word and God would entrust it to this when there's no prophet on the scene God would entrust to a dream he gives Joseph a dream danger the Lord visits him in a dream but you see this is where it comes to be sensitive to the word of the Lord and to recognize that his he gave him the dream we would look at this and say there's nothing smooth about this at all Mary's life looks like it's in jeopardy what's gonna come but you see it's not in jeopardy this is in God's control what looks like were you I would have a nail-biter if we got him left we would be sitting there oh my goodness what's gonna take place but God is working everything out according to his program even to where in that time there would be an economic move that would take place it would not be a stimulus package but taxation would rise there would be gone out through the land there's taxes that need to come do you need to report back to your home birthplace now to thank God would take the instrument of taxation something like this but yet we're there looking at it even Joseph and Mary Joseph now walking along and saying hey Mary you know what I know exactly what's going on let me tell you what's going on Mary let me just tell you like this you know over there in the Book of Jeremiah you know it speaks about being born in Bethlehem he wasn't talking about that because he didn't know it come on now but he knew the word he knew the god of the word but what was it would you rather have known when I know it Noora my said here I know what Jeremiah said that listen the scribes and Pharisees knew what Jeremiah said they even knew where the Messiah was to be born when Herod sent word and said bring me word that I might worship Him remember his counsel said it's in Bethlehem but did it do him any good although they knew where was that scripturally it did not but God was fulfilling his word in the midst of it and his fulfilment of his word he fulfills his word and proves it through believers who believe and can be moved by the unction of the Holy Ghost remember this is a walk of faith Joseph wasn't putting everything together but there's one thing about it Joseph had to know this was supernatural he knew what was taking place as far as within Marik this was supernatural but you see God was moving to get him in position because the promise had to be fulfilled matter of fact I love how I would say it in the word in different places there in the book of Matthew that it might be fulfilled it would go on to say that when it came time for them to leave out of Bethlehem remember here's the Holy Spirit the protection told told Joseph he said get out get a get out of here for Herod is going to send the troops dad to come into with the slaughter get down to Egypt take the mother in the child and get down to Egypt and he says wait there till I tell you wait there until I send you where you see all we can do and we wait on the leg and we wait until the next word comes from God we're found waiting in position until the next word comes think of it Joseph never in his mind neither Mary asked him a year ago ask him a year ago or a year and a half ask him years ago hey did you guys expect to be down in Egypt no ask us did you expect this to take place this quarantine no we didn't expect and see these things like this but you see within it all even though this was hardship Mary was great the Bible says great with child she was ready to be delivered it was not the time to be making this kind of a trip this was very troublesome but God was arranging all the pieces and getting things together let me just tell you this is not the only piece to the puzzle coronavirus is not the only piece to the puzzle it's another piece how many more pieces I don't know but I can tell you this right here I know as I told the family last night I said I can remember from the early years of me growing up and there would be things that would take place I said I can remember I said dad would stand up the inspiration would strike and it would reach out and I said and it would declare these are things that the Prophet it spoke about like you remember one thing you remember very clearly of East and West Germany remember a lot of there was a lot of discussion about Russia and everything else but then when that took place remember the inspiration would strike the hearts of the ministry in that hour I think of what was that 88 87 I don't know somewhere around in there when that happened and it would strike their heart to come back to in time seats high where the Holy Spirit had identified that the borders of the old Roman Empire will be restored that old Roman Empire must be revived and see the Holy Spirit had already spoken it through the mouth of the Prophet but now the same one who spoken was there to quicken it to that of the ministry that was on earth following that saith the Lord and it alerted to the people of the time that we're in but you see the danger sometimes with this is that it alerts and people can become very and then after time and just started waning off again the things will be come again but let me just tell you something the rapture is not going to be a pick-me-up the rapture is a sudden secret going away of those who are waiting with full anticipation their lives are waiting on the fulfillment of that as brother Branham if I can say it this clearly he said the bride in the message rapture will be waiting on that revelation you say brother Samuel that revelation has already come yes and no the revelation has already unfolded for that on the coming of the Lord and the rapture but remember within the unfolding of that it is the quickening power that is released upon the Church of the Living God to make her ready for the coming of the Lord it'll be as the Prophet would say the final quickening unto the rapture we are waiting like Enoch walking with God for the final quickening it won't happen in this assembly then the rest are streaming in oh we got to get this revelation of the rapture you know brother so-and-so is the only one that has it no this is the word of Jehovah Jireh that final quickening will be released around the world at the same time though Simon what are you saying I'm saying just being step with God because when he was down in Egypt the Holy Spirit would come to Joseph and said get out of Egypt Herod's dead gone back to Israel alright so what's he doing he's following the pillar of light you see the Holy Spirit is quickening the prophets words in those times because this they had to get out of Egypt the Bible said that it might be fulfilled as the Lord had spoken by the prophet out of Egypt that called my son it was a compound promise it had to be fulfilled that's why he had to be done in Egypt this is why even when they come into Israel the Holy Spirit lets her know you know when here he hears about ark Elias and Archelaus you know it's raining Joseph becomes fearful remember what I told you on Sunday fears not always a bad thing there's things here right that right there he was afraid to go thither it was when he was afraid her do I belong to the Lord there was no it was his something struck him there was that of a sensitivity just to stop just stop so what think of it Joseph's life had already through the dream if you're not to take Mary unto thee Mary that wife all the way through everything regarding all of this it was all under the leadership of the Holy Spirit fulfilling his word is that right so then here the Holy Spirit comes back God speaks to him in a dream and he tells him go into the going to the parts of Galilee and he goes into Galilee in the Bible said he turns aside into Nazareth that it might be fulfilled he shall be called a Nazarene this is being led by the spirit you see we can see we see what happened in the time of the Lord Jesus people had it all figured out and there's a natural part to us I mean I'm speaking just to a skier I'm talking to the church here and the internet knows right here there's a natural block there's certain things we start looking at even when things like this take place with that of the coronavirus I believe there's all I believe there's a lot of things taking place underneath this piece I believe there's things that we can see taking place as you heard me speak up on Tuesday night in our little time together there when we were chatting and we understand economically where it's breaking things down it has to come into a place to where somebody will step in and pay off the debt well brother Simon I believe that's going to be within the next year why don't you just say I believe that God is going to fulfill his word and I'm a part of that word don't go to putting dates and times and everything else sure when things are taking place we should feel the urgency but not just in times like this not just in times like this you see what I'm saying is not to be alert not for those things not to be looked at we understand those are markers those are indications of things that God has spoke to you and I we're not in darkness light has come into Goshen that we might know who we are we might know where we are and where we are going we're not looking for God to turn around America America has sinned away per day of grace we are looking for the rapture [Applause] God has moved us in position in his word to be able to see that so with this the word it's God who fulfills it down through time when when Jesus come they had it all figured out and remember as they had it all figured out over and over and over and over the Prophet wouldn't be me be very mindful to tell us this even to preach a message before the seals God hiding in simplicity and revealing himself in the same he said he even set in there he would talk about Noah's message in Elijah's message then he brings it around in the message humble that self there in July of 63 he speaks of the working and the out working of the third pole it will be in humanity it will go over the top of many people's heads why because they have not humbled themselves the first humility is and the ultimate the humility to the word that says you must be born again you can know this message back and forth and if you don't come to know Jesus Christ in a personal living reality it's no more than doctrine you can know that back and forth but you've got to know him in the power of his resurrection hey man let me just be very clear right now there's been statements that have floors flown around over the past couple of years and they've come right down there from in a place where many things are gotten from and it comes around in there and they make a statement and say the tapes is the token or the message is the token there's a lot more to be said within that the person can have this message in their hand they can have and walk around they can have the tapes but the token is the revelation of Jesus Christ the baptism of the Holy Ghost outside of that there is no rapture amen God never sent a tape to seal me he sent the Holy Ghost are you with me these are a reality these are things in this hour for you and I have brought a reality to our life that's why when a person could say well you know the message is the token let's expand on that a little bit more let's unpack that so somebody walking around saying I believe the message so you know I must have the token no the beliefs gotta come from your heart not from head you can believe this message as the truth and still not be converted you've got to believe it from the heart not from the head when you believe it from the heart then God seals you with the Holy Ghost you can't never be the same no more mama mama how do we get there this assignment what are you saying I'm saying I'm saying just exactly the words of the prayer letter that went out that accompanied every little prayer cloth I love it brother brems said be simple period be natural period Wow two word sentences be simple period be natural period goes on to say begin to doubt your doubts begin to call those things that you have prayed and asked God for begin to call them your own it's a simplicity being natural being simple but Sammy so what are you saying well hey this is what I'm saying it's not up to you and I to try to make things out of things that aren't there but the Holy Spirit don't have to make things out of it you know to where I got a call brother richer and say brother richer here can you see it can you see it how I'm saying no remember he's God's child I'm God's child when the Holy Spirit wants to alert and show us these things remember is the Spirit of God that anoint our eyes to see it getting us in position this is why now bringing it down to our own life all things work together for the good to them who are called according to him to love the Lord and called according to his purpose to understand every word must come to pass God must fulfill every word and that word here it is resting within our lives the Holy Spirit quickens our lives but remember the scripture would tell us that within remember as it says here we are for therefore known predestinated we are called we are justified that those are justified he has already glorified and the see the finished product the finished product God brings his word to pass it is God fulfilling his word just like the Prophet could say things that ought to be he said God knew when you were going to stagger in that that you know he said that little mission that night who you were called to the altar that was the beginning of your walk with God some of us did not begin your walk with God did not begin in a message church it began in some other place not touching your life some of you watching you may be watching Jesus of Nazareth or the other thing and one another person you know look the peculiarity is how God would deal with the light and bring the life to the awareness I'm the sinner I need God what is it the work of God begins to unfold and it's not going to lead you you can never be content with staying where you were there was a yearning within your life for that to be made real within your heart and God seemed to it that all of these parts were arranged to bring his word to pass and can't any can't and isn't the same God who has watched over his word is he not still watching over his word is he not still here in the place to alert his children to events that are taking place to be able to say hey pay attention here hey look at this here he is in position to bring these things together because the ministry in this hour I said this before the Ministry of Malachi for brother Branham was not reaching when he's talked about do um he talked about Khrushchev and he talked about ah you know Eisenhower brother branham was not playing with somebody's last names brother Branham was not looking after you and in saying okay let me see I can put all this together brother man was not doing that it was the Spirit of God that gave the unction of those men's names and ties it ended Daniel for the sender what are you saying it ought to bring a rest to you and I to know that even when you and I it would seem like we're missing it but remember brother Ram said Oh God let me call their name they're gonna miss it they're gonna miss their healing we would have missed it many times but sometimes God has to come right now and call our name and say hey this is for you what is it God watching over his word and he healed perfect Psalms 138 8 the Lord will perfect that which concerns me remember he brings his word to pass you see what just some of the references we made it was with hardship the scripture the inspiration would speak to Daniel in regards to even the children of Israel returning back to the homeland under that of Cyrus's edik that God had put in place remember God already spoke of Cyrus gave the name in Isaiah called him my servant my shepherd Cyrus wasn't even a believer he never became a believer but he was there alerted to what he had to do oh my I'll tell you tonight think of this if the Holy Spirit can work on a life who's not even a believer how much more of he's dealing with your life how once you surrender to the Lord and say Lord you could use a man that never returned for you but my heart is longing to serve you your honor is longing to serve him there's a God to bring you into that reality of the desire he put within your life you never gave yourself that desire he put that there let him bring his word to pass you see then it's not trying to it's not people trying to fit quotes to cover their life fit fine quotes to cover their unbelief trying to put it together like a picture and you see a cow with its leg coming out its head going out the back everything is it wow what a freak looking thing why it's because it's being arranged by the hands of man by man's intellect but when God arranged it remember when God arranged it you don't have the cow eating out the top of the tree everything is in its right season and position you see a clearer picture God brings his word the best so the Lord will perfect that which concerns me this is why we need trials this is why we need to be tested so our character can be molded what's happening it's God bringing his word to pass you see that with the taxation you see all these things with Joseph and Mary here in the first coming there was a lot of things a lot of pressure and things build up as the time drew nigh there was a lot of pressure and things that build up but God was bringing his word to pass those who were being moved by the Spirit of God they did not know all that was taking place but they were being led and this is where the difference is it did not say the sons it said the sons of God they are led by the Spirit of God are you with me there were many Israel many in Israel who knew the scriptures who knew the prophets prophesy who knew all those things but they could not be led they knew it and they couldn't be led God knows how to hide himself in simplicity you see this is why within our life I'm just going to close here tonight this is why in our life that within our lives right now all things working together for the good where our lives are are likened to that of other of a a plant that is planted david would say that which is planted in the courts of the lord shall flourish and to recognize that when we've been planted in christ jesus everything that we have need of is in us when we have received the Holy Ghost everything brother Branham would bring it right down and said the rapture is in you already but what is it what has to happen there's got to be a drinking in of the water and then as the water a member as the nourishment as it's coming in then what happens then limbs limbs of the apple tree come forth limbs branches whatever then limbs come forth out of those limbs from there would come as you see the different leaves you got to have leaves then from the leaves come blossoms then from those blossoms that you and I stand in May maybe we'll be be inside this year and looking out and say oh what a beautiful apple tree but those blossoms are not the final stage those blossoms are only part of every seed bringing forth after its own kind it's only a stage the next stage is the Apple itself all four stages limbs leaves blossoms apples where did that all come from from that which is planted and it's drinking it's taking in and as it's taking in it's pushing out you see this is why taking in of the Word of God this is why drinking in this is why laying in the presence of God this is why pray this is why seeking the Lord this is why it's needed why it releases what is on the inside of us God is bringing his word to pass and what God has saw that reflection it comes and works its way out in this life is that right I wish I didn't have to stop there but I'm going to stop but I'm just going to stop and stop on that part of it all things our work are working together in heaven were already glorified in the prints of God the RAM said I'm just pushing out to it so what what does that mean in regards even to where we're at right now with the things that we're facing what does that mean to me as a believer what it means is God has ordained you in the part of this word God's going to fulfill and he is fulfilling his word in this hour the question is are you in the word are you in him if you're not in him and you know that your life isn't even not in position let me just tell you don't resist you might look at your life and say you don't know what I've done but remember he did not provide you he provided himself a lamb his eyes are not upon the worshipper his eyes are on the lamb and if there's any Fault in the lamb then you and have a cause to disbelieve you and half God could not even accept you but the Holy Spirit is letting you know you are free let me make that real to your heart that's what the gospel rings out freedom it's caught bringing things in position we did not put ourselves here God has brought us into this position but he didn't drag us he didn't put us in a headlock he didn't pick us up by the shirt collar he wooed us he let us to himself he's drawn us and here in our lives what was he drawing he was not drawing up on that old nature that old nature's rebellious that old nature is not a lamb nature but the Holy Spirit was seeing there's a lamb on the inside there's a lamb beneath that darkness there's a lamb on the inside there remember he is the Lamb of God we are known as the Sheep of God right our names are in the Lamb's Book of Life he said I know my sheep by name and they are known of me and man we will not become a lamb we always were lambs but what had to happen it took the life of the Passover the Lamb of God that I to come and to move and break back the clouds and bring into expression that lamb that was trapped on the inside but where the lamb was trapped on the inside he came and gave me life and in giving life what was it his life for mine what did it do it awakened and he I'm closing and he remember we are ordained to be conformed to the image of the son just as he was the Lamb of God who was led to the slaughter the Bible also said who before her her Shearer's is dumb that same Holy Spirit inside of the life of the believer what does it bring forth it bring forth the Lambs of God that walk in perfect obedience and harmony with the desire to please the Lord all things work together for the good to them who love the Lord and are called according to his purpose sure God has two motors God has to allow circumstances to arrive to shape to mold to home to prepare to put us in positions but we see those things themselves are not good but they're working together for our God even in this when we're looking at this right here I will tell you this I can say this I can say this with all confidence as we come through this weren't gonna come through on the other side stronger than when we came in I could go right down through scripture after scripture after scripture showing the testimony that when things came like this the brides are gonna come out weaker the bride will come out stronger but the stronger remember what it means to be stronger it means she beasts become more dependent on him and less dependent on herself what's she doing her eyes are focused on him who has the key of David the veil is upon his shoulder she's focused remember he is my strength is the strength he's my light he's the strength of my life her focus is upon him not on herself so what does this do in the midst of it it does not call us to look and try to generate funds or things that we don't even have but to do it causes us to rest on him and God is working out more and more in our lives I'm so grateful for that so are confident are confident is that he is bringing his word to past you know what that should do is should take all anxiousness away from your life if you've been anxious remember the Holy Spirit is not condemning you but I will say this right here if you have been anxious of things and well I you know I I need to see this or see that don't don't be anxious because you get anxious you block off the Holy Spirit for him even speaking to you what should I do just rest God God wants you to see he will open your eyes to hasn't he opened your eyes thus far as in he led you this far hasn't he by His grace as in he impart in his life sure won't he see you and I the rest of it sure every step of the way in every junction of time this is why we look to him we can see certain events take place and we look at it we come to a certain spot and say Lord I see there probably there's certain things this or that the Lord you're in control I'm just loving you Lord I'm just loving you I'm glad to be in this love affair this relationship with you Lord Jesus because perfect love casts out all fear you see this is where fear is dismissed but you recognize you are always in his mind and the Holy Spirit come to seek you out and to make it real to your life when we can see that it doesn't matter what all other things take place we know for sure that we are going home we're going back home Egypt is not our home Amen the message never come to call us out and leave us here the message come to call us out and to take us in Redemption is two parts is that right and it begins with coming under the blood right now coming under the blood receiving the Holy Spirit right now and I just I feel like I could just preach all night here's just just things just flowing in my heart right now but I just say to you very clearly sometimes sometimes people are individuals they're so geared up on the part I I need to receive the Holy Ghost I need to receive the holy gold and they make it as though it's something that they themselves have to do it's not what you have to do the Holy Ghost is the gift of God you have to make yourself available you have to want it you have to desire him that's what it has to be and i say to any here or at home if you know you don't have you don't have to say I tried this I tried to do it don't allow the devil to be the spokesman for God's Word don't allow him to be the interpreter of the word for your life look what his interpretation has brought it's brought death he doesn't hold the mystery to your life God holds the mystery to your life it's God who unfolds it so what does it take brother Samuel fall in love with him it's what it takes falling in love with him it's letting go it takes surrendering it takes giving into him it takes being obedient take surrendering to the Lord devil tries to bring such confusion with on those things and it's very very very very simple you say what does it have to be it's your does what is your desire what's your desire what is your desire God puts the desire and the longing and the thirst for life within you because it's through that thirst you pull and it brings you to him only he can satisfy it only he can let's pray father Lord I I just feel just so moved Oh God in my spirit Lord so pressed in my heart and Lord in the same instance of such wrath such peace Lord my heart is his pressed it smooth Lord for those who would not know you in this way Lord that's my heart's desire is that they would know you in the power of your resurrection that God that reality would strike in their hearts in their life and Lord I also and just thinking God of every of the hearts of your children tonight what a rest it brings to us Lord we see that Lord all we've been alerted to the day we're living we we see oh God by your grace there's things Lourdes you were just expressing the other night so thankful Lord God for the evening light the Holy Spirit in this hour that is made the Word of God real to our hearts Lord Jesus to alert us to point us to where we are quicken us for the moment lord I I just I'm so thankful we look back down we see what we're seeing take place we see that Lord there are things that were already sent identified spoken Lord by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of your prophet we see that Lord these are things that he did not speak things outside of the word but it was identifying parts that were within the word but declaring this is the hour this is the time and yet Lord went to declare this is the hour this is the time as it is in your word when I would say the time is at hand it did not mean at that moment but it would mean in the season so Lord as we're looking at the word we're thankful and we're resting we're looking to you oh I'm glad I'm glad Lord that you did not put it that we have to try to figure things out but we have to try to put things together no Lourdes is to be under the leadership of the Holy Spirit your prophet gave us simple a simple message that was more than just the message called visions of William Branham that to me Lord was the divine orchestration of how you work in each of our lives the Prophet at times even when he tried to take that baby and pray for it it was thus saith the Lord that that baby was gonna rise but he had to wait too and everything else got in position that little baby got worse and actually the orders it started going into different fits but Lord he had to wait on you Lord to me that was Holy Spirit that was the counsel of the Holy Spirit to our hearts telling us that this vision is sure not to wait upon you or as the Bible would just encourage us it is good for a man to hope and quietly wait on the Lord is to be in that position in love with you and then Lord when the handkerchief has to be here this person on the bed the glass is here all those parts it'll be in its position at its time and you alert us and like the Prophet was setting there he said oh oh oh you should just sit down now or she just sits he was getting it was an anticipation Lord we can see we see things Lord taking place but I think my dad others had lived even before Lord that I went on they would live they would see things taking place all with anticipation and rightly so we should be under anticipation every church age whipped fell asleep under the anticipation of the coming of the Lord they did not live in their time and say well lady Oh see it hasn't come to pass yet no they lived in anticipation for the coming of the Lord but it's in this time Lord as you would make known this is the time of the fulfillment Oh God let every one of us be found ready Lord if there's one under the sound of my voice it's not ready I pray that God that they quickly would Lord take unto themselves the provision that's been made by the blood of the Lamb they would quickly Lord take it under their bosom and say God change me deliver me may it fall upon their hearts like it did upon Jacob and say God I'm tired of being Jacob change me Lord deliver me lord hello Granite Lord metal holy spirit Lord go to every heart Lord in every life for every one of your children Lord maybe some of them Lord right now you're gone they're out of work we know pressures from this Lord days weeks Lord ask God according to your word you said I've never seen the righteous forsaken for a child of God seat of God beggin bread Lord that's your word and I pray God the Lord is you prove yourself in every situation you prove yourself you unfold yourself and one of your redemptive names or Granite Lord we pray may you just Lord take control may the heart be settled may it look upon that of the word and say indeed I love the Lord he is my life these things all of these things I cast my cares upon him and take all of my worry I give it to him because all things are working together for the good for my good or in the name of Jesus Christ granite Lord for the glory of God may there be

said the believers are on their toes waiting for the fulfillment of the word what word that word that God has revealed in this generation we're on our toes we're looking for the fulfillment recognizing were a part of it I'm a part of him amen well I'm so glad learning to lean on Jesus is that what you're finding more Lord I'm learning to lean with the rest many of the world I know there's you know and I think God different ones that you know you hear the reports of people giving their life to the Lord and repenting think of that I think God for that but you look at what even more and more that's going on the world is becoming more dependent upon the world things are being bailed out in all of these things everything is setting it up for the people because remember it's all about satisfying self but in the midst of this time oh it's I'll tell you this virus it's a horrible thing horrible thing but God is bringing his people through and through the midst of it all
