========================================

wow but it would not just be that of the Lord Jesus this was God announcing it's now God is going to come to his Temple and talking about his his his chosen vessels well Peter would speak to you and I Lively stones that have been cut out in our different making and you know what the stones are all different we're all different in our makeup we're all different in the way that even we look at things that shows our our how we are positioned as the body of Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit never came to do away with our angle of perception the Holy Spirit Come to blend together in a paradox the body of Jesus Christ that is yoked together for one purpose that's the mystery of it all that it's God's Oneness working through different vessels and that's still something I'll just say from me that's still something that I come more and more into the realization of you say brother Sammy what do you say then you're not going to think like me and I'm not going to think like you but oh let his thoughts be my thoughts right because I'm not here to change in I'm not here to change your thoughts you're not here to change my thoughts you see that's what debating that's what all this Strife comes about God's not interested in you sing it my way or me saying no no he himself is the one to be glorified Hallelujah not let us build another Camp let us build another Doctrine let us build more fences the day's offenses are over [Applause] there are you hearing me now defenses are still there if you allow them but if you allow the Holy Spirit to move in your life the spirit of God will raise above every fence to where the fence is no longer in view God doesn't tear fences down the Holy Spirit comes in to raise the standard above the fence oh glory be to God so while notice let us let us make here three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses one for Elijah God said no no no we're not going to come that way we're you got to come and see it my way no no no no no no no no no no more of that well he's fake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and then somehow God's going to answer the question he's not going to debate him God comes and vindicates his word God's not going to debate no Peter Peter you got it wrong no God God is able and this is the same way he does for you and I God comes and our thoughts are changed as he vindicates his word a bright Cloud overshadowed him and behold a voice out of that cloud Glory which said this is what the voice that came out of the cloud said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him yeah God was declaring he was indeed tabernacled and this is the final Authority this then was taking place was the adoption ceremony this in Matthew 17 was prophecy of where the bride stands in this hour to where the body would come to completion and would come under the adoption of the very person of Jesus Christ moving into the body of Believers and God declaring hear ye him because we have no other message to preach the spirit and the bride are saying the same thing who is this saying the same thing the spirit the prophet and the bride are all saying the same thing glory be to God so now this real Mount Transfiguration experience this is where Jesus was glorified before the disciples notice the chapter before is where out of Peter that representation that was in there the whole time spoke out and declared Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God the chapter before so now in the word revelation has come this is the truth this is the way walk you in it this is the path to life now comes Matthew 17 to where now God is declaring them this is the final Authority on the word you see this is why in this age God would reveal himself in his message that he is the amen the amen is the final word the amen is the Soviet the amen is thee that which cannot be argued that which cannot be disputed he is the amen oh my don't you see how wonderful it is that when you as it says on Isaiah will bless yourself in the god of Truth which is the god of the amen what a blessing it is when the word comes your way and you surrender to that word what are you receiving you are receiving the a man of God as the word is coming into your life it is the so be it and nothing can argue or withstand that word and when the baptism of the Holy Ghost has come that seal of the Living God it is the amen upon your life it is God a Manning his own word [Applause] many scriptures we can run with that but we stay here right here this morning because it was the revelation of Matthew 16 that led to the glorification in Matthew 17 in that body of Believers so so we say it in this way this is why brother Brandon would refer to this Mount Transfiguration experience I want to just drop these in here he's asking the Lord here in uh this day the scripture is fulfilled he says we ask you to hide us tonight behind the word blind us to the things of the world and let us see Jesus May there be a mount Transfiguration experience Among Us that we see no man save Jesus only that's my heart's desire man then we see no man but Jesus only to the bride that's who we want to see that's who we long to see that's why we come to the house of God we've not come to see a man we've not come to see a vessel we come to see Jesus Christ and if you can receive it in this way that the word itself as we come to the house of God that's why brother Ram says coming to church doesn't save you it keeps you in Fellowship because that Fellowship is to be between you and God under the blood and so the ministering of the word it's God's love for you and I that if things sometimes could kind of creep and things could go this way and I'm not all together talking about Sin but God's desire is to keep us sensitive that when we are even outside of these walls we realize we are receiving from God true that's right amen yes that's our position that's our Authority as Sons and Daughters of God oh sometimes how we allow the enemy to sell us too short now notice in the Easter seal I'm just laying these in here this is where I'm going it says notice when they looked around speaking in Matthew 17. with all this power upon them they saw Jesus only with all this power this inspiration upon him this is what they saw you see this is the purpose of the Holy Ghost Jesus said when the spirit of Truth is come he will lead and guide you into all truth he will take the things that I have spoken and reveal them unto you he will not bear witness of himself meaning that the spirit of God will never highlight the vessel that he's speaking through but he will continue to exalt the Lord Jesus Christ because in that word is the finishing work of everything you say finishing brother Samuel but you don't know my need but the reality is you're already loosed by the blood of Jesus Christ for what's needed is the reality of freedom you're already loose you're already healed see that's why the preaching of the word is to bring our faith up into a finished work that's why the preaching of the word is to Cast Away evil spirits hindering spirits that we can walk and really receive what God has for us when they looked around with all this power upon them they saw Jesus only and the real True Believer don't care whether he's backing up denomination or nothing he's not looking for their backing he only wants one thing for you to see that glorified Christ a real true Mount Transfiguration experience how many say granted Lord a real true Maps Transfiguration experience all only glorifies Jesus Christ it didn't glorify Moses it didn't glorify Elijah it didn't glorify themselves it don't glorify nothing else but they seem the glorified Christ and any True Believer that's what's in his heart is to glorify Jesus Christ that's what he's trying to get the people to see [Applause] that's all of our desire right oh not not to say if you come join our groups you come do this or that oh no don't do that see God's word which is Christ magnified and the promise the promise fulfilled of this day in this great Resurrection this is what gives us joy to know that we are with him a flesh of his flesh and bone of him Bones what a joy that's the only thing that a real believer cares about foreign is that he would be glorified because him being glorified in our lives through the new birth through that Revelation working in our lives where that change has come what does it do it glorifies the work of Calvary and the resurrection it glorifies the Lord Jesus Christ it takes away all the works and all the isms and all the ideas of man and it exalts Jesus Christ that's God's desire he said if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me now back in our scripture here of Romans 12 verse 2 hear the admonition be not conformed to this world I think of it there is pressure that's all around we could spend a multitude of time that's on that phrase there's pressure all around that desires to cause us to conform right yep true if I can say it and so much and I don't want to get caught in this here because we could just spend a lot of time there are so many things that comes even via messages music right television right all those things that come all the way through there well we got quiet okay this is why we understand Satan's desire you know Satan has a Doctrine he wants to get across Satan Satan his his angels are ministers of Life they're not just preachers but there's a doctrine that Satan is preaching as well his desire is to seduce to tear down to get things all tangled up and to become pressurized and now you know you're right we can say oh I'll tell you I'll never succumb to that I'll never really because when I look at these things still brother Brown tells us the pressure that you and I in this age that we are under is that of a soft Easy Living striving to get to a spot to where oh man I can finally relax instead of realizing that it's not of us just so exerting ourselves to a point of failure but it is placing God first in everything I tell you if we would ask him and ask his leadership ask his counsel instead of presuming many things we'd be in a lot better shape because after all the number one purpose that we are here for is to serve God and to serve God is the Tabernacle deity that's our number one purpose if if outside of that and remember Satan's desire is to send all these other things in to try to get out of us what God desires to place in US you remember Christ the mystery brother Brian said you let your job you let your wife you let your this you let your you let you let you let you let all these other things get it out see God instills into you and I even as the word will come in a service like this and sometimes we just walk out instead of praying about it instead of asking God be it unto me Lord according to Thy Word because the whole law you remember where we started in Jarred in the Kingdom the whole law of the kingdom is governed by ask and you shall receive right but for the same thing he's showing me these things he took him out to the field and said look he upon the field it's white for Harvest pray you to the Lord of harvest that he will send laborers into the vineyard sometimes what it is God Is Not slack fulfilling and doing his part but the slackness comes down in our part will be something we're going to get caught there but it is difficult but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind this is how we are transformed is by the renewing of your mind and Titus 3 verse 3 for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish disobedient deceived serving divers lusts and Pleasures living in Malice and in be hateful and hating one another but after that the kindness and love of God our savior toward man appeared not by works of righteousness which we have done we believe in works of righteousness right I mean when God deals with your heart you start you start you move into the works of righteousness but this this is not come by our works of righteousness so it because in other words it would be us exalting our own efforts right Works themselves is what is to follow faith our faith then becomes demonstrated or manifested by works amen notice not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his Mercy he saved us oh my aren't you glad for the mercy of God bye now notice here it is by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ Our Savior that being justified by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life so he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy spirit it's the it's the same it's the same working it's God through the washing of regeneration it's the Holy Spirit coming out that does what as the holy spirit is being poured out it's there to wash us it's there to come upon that seed in order that the seed May rot and die oh my I just got to preach when he's here like this you realize that when the word is coming in that way that sometimes there's a showdown where people can come in their life and say I don't know about that I don't know if I can give that up and or I've tried this sir I've tried that but what should I do just stand in the washing of Water by the word because the word itself if you'll just submit to it it'll rot away every thought that is against the word the word has the power to break it down it has the power to wash away every thought that is against the word of God just submit to it though you know many times as I said it was standing people say oh no you don't have to do that I don't need to do that I don't but let the word because we are Washed by the Water of the word and that word became blood that he might wash us we're not here under a theological point this morning we're here to be washed with the bleeding word of almighty God has provided the blood that we might be washed from the filth of our life he has provided his blood which the blood of Christ is the spirit of God that has been released I wasn't there when the blood was shed I was in him but the spirit of God Is What comes forth the life that was within that blood cell that life that created blood cell that created that body the blood that brought Mary in condition that same life is now moving throughout the Earth it's sounding the Jubilee trumpet it lets you and I know the atonement has been made you were included in the atonement what do I have to do throw it down throw down sin throw down unbelief throw it down I'll tell you what this washing of regeneration does it takes your mind that you can look at yourself and say how could this be me how could you just stay in this water you hear me Ruth you stay in this field you understand what I'm talking about you stay in the field that Boaz is appearing in and every handful that he drops pick it up because every handful is a handful of purpose you need that all but I want the full thing just abide in the purpose because he is the full thing one handful after another leads to that blue Samuel what should I be captivated with him him him that's what she was captivated with and she still didn't know the full reality when she went back and told Naomi but then Naomi being a type of the Old Testament and Naomi what could she do she could point out this is him that was prophesied this is him that was spoken of and whatsoever he says unto you do it you see the New Testament never did away with the authority of the Old Testament or you hear him in the house it didn't do away with the law it just establishes the law in the place in the heart of the believer where it is intended to be glory be to God in the highest oh my washing oh well the devil tells me why you don't why are you listening to him I'll tell you right now you wouldn't listen to a liar you know you work with something I'm being frank but we talk about this we quote more what the devil says instead of what God's saying well the devil's telling me that what are you doing quoting a liar man he's a liar don't even give him any room in your mind or your spirit take what God has said amen washing of Water by regeneration it's a word that's breaking down you it broke down me it breaks what does it do it breaks down the old Shell that that germ of life on the inside can come forth hmm this is why Jesus could say in Matthew 19 28 that ye which have followed me in the Regeneration in the whole of the new birth you have followed me notice who has been followed we follow him are you hearing me we follow him following him just as he told them you will be placed upon 12 Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel right if you follow me now think about that following him in that of the new birth the Regeneration lifts you above the world it places you in a place of judgment to discern between right and wrong it places you in a place of authority you couldn't do that I couldn't do that he shall set me upon a rock he hath hid me right this was why brother Brandon would go on to say he said you let the holy spirit this out of power transformation you let the Holy Spirit come upon any person that's truly got something down there a healing comes from the inside my I wish I could really preach on that that let that healing come from the spirit that's in you you realize there's healing going on even in your mortal body yes you realize even right here over the years now I'm talking to hearts and lives that have been sealed Away by the spirit of God you know there's healing taking place you say brother Samuel healing yeah God by the washing of Water by the word he's tearing down complexes he's tearing down things that happen to you as a young person he's tearing it down what's happening healing is coming from the inside ain't one that's on the inside of you is the same one that'll make the Desert Blossom like a rose it's the same God that moves in every facet of your life oh my he's the same God that where there is barrenness he's the same God that'll cause water to come flowing through our lives it's healing taking place oh God I wish I could preach on that notice if it's a genuine Spirit anointing the genuine seed it can't do nothing but bear a DOT a son and daughter of God but the genuine Spirit he can come upon a Cocker Barrel seed and the rain can fall upon a Cocker Barrel it'll make it live just the same as it falls upon a wheat and makes it live oh well brother Sammy you know I and then I I might just be a Cocker bro there you go quoting that liar again the same devil that wanted to interpret it to you you say brother Samuel what's the difference I'll tell you what the difference is what's the desire in your heart because a kookaburra don't see the need for a change the Kookaburra is fine being a kookaburra as long as it can have an anointing once in a while but a genuine wheat seed on the inside has a desire for Jesus Christ to be glorified it's a desire to see his word fulfill in our life come on the word is still a discerner oh my this is why Jesus could say in John 6 when his disciples were murmuring you know and they were saying you know and he asked him he said does this offend you and you know everything he said except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have to be a partaker of the word remember when Melchizedek made Abraham he gave him Bread and Wine you got to be a partaker of the Flesh and the blood are you hearing me now yeah you see you got to have both you can't just have one of the other there's got to be both that's what true worshipers are right it's a party he gave to us what is necessary that's what he gave to them on the day of Pentecost was Flesh and Blood his word and his life now notice it is the spirit Jesus said it's a spirit that quickens I want you to say I don't put these up there I just want you to listen to these it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing setting the service and maybe listen to a tape or something you might feel like man I don't feel like I've got nothing that's your flesh I said that's your flesh your flesh come on now it can talk because you're sitting right here well you know and you ain't getting nothing you know you ain't getting nowhere you ain't a mountain to nothing God will never tell you that amen God will never do that you can't show me one place in the scripture that God ever said that as a matter of fact God never discouraged the ten spies from going into the land it was their own unbelief in the love of God are you hearing me now so here the flesh profit is nothing well just as examples come we'll give it brother Brandon tells us in fundamental Foundation of Faith one of the many places he said wow the white Moody was even preaching let alone in his own meetings but he gives an example he said even Dwight Moody won and even Martin Luther he said that they didn't preach Divine Healing he said but showing while they preached the word he said there were lives that were healed while the word was being preached right he said I've sent my word to heal my people hold glory and lives can set them remember brother Brown said here was a woman who was sitting here and here the spirit of God will call her out and say sister you did not think you had enough Faith to be healed he said but you've already been healed see her thoughts about her own faith were wrong God's thoughts were right oh God help us [Applause] God help us God help us to get rid of our own stinking thinking like brother John LaFontaine would call it get end of our own thoughts and receive the thoughts of God the flesh profited nothing the words notice the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life oh my and notice he said but the Bible said there were some who believe not think of it setting under the ministry of the Lord Jesus here in the Messiah and yet there were those who did not believe why they were not ordained are you with me this is why Jesus said no man in that same scripture no man can come unto me except thou except that we're given unto him and my father let me tell you something if you have a draw to the word you are blessed for the same now how can you say that because the scripture said blessed are they who do hunger and first after righteousness for you shall be filled how can you be filled if you don't have a hunger and how could you have a hunger and not be blessed when God spoke to Mary he said blessed art thou among women before she ever received the Angel's message the angel came to announce to her you are blessed among women are you hearing me Church the word comes not to throw you down the word comes to lift up a son and daughter of God that you realize I am coming to the table of the Lord not as a beggar not as a servant not as one who is unworthy I am coming through the call of the blood that voice of the blood of a worthy one who has made me Worthy [Applause] glory be to God what's he doing breaking down traditions of well I got to do this so long I got to do that so long I thought God delivered you out of those roads Hail Marys I thought God delivered you out of them prayer beads oh no I thought God delivered you out of that Pentecostalism I said God did that oh I see what it is now what it is healing has got to come from the inside [Applause] oh my don't you love him but from that time the Bible said many of them said adios from that time the Bible said many walk no more with him when they got down real tight they said can't go this this is this is too much but them said it like this and say message power transformation he said oh he said it just seemed like you know long time ago when Church Life when the prophet had something to say thus saith the Lord the people would move and they stained right with it they moved but now he said it's kind of like I don't like that guy vote him out and oh he said they don't have no understanding no more the people just don't move by the spirit of God anymore God's word is his Spirit oh I love this let's just hone in right here God's word is his spirit and his word comes to his prophet and the prophet is supposed is the word the word is supposed to transform you from what the things of the world are into the image of Sons and Daughters of God so God's word is a spirit and that word is to transform us from the things of the world and into the image of Sons and Daughters of God and I said the word can only come through these prophets as they spoke it had to be compared with a word and showed that it was the word then if you can accept that word it'll transform you if you can accept that word it'll transform you from a son or daughter of the world uh daughter of the world to a son and daughter of God now he said how many in here has had that experience how many years had that experience he said we've had that experience because it was spoke now I want you to hone in here because it was spoke what was spoke the word of God it was believed and the word came forth and fell into the bed of the heart and there it growed right out of it see he said transforming yourself his holy spirit transforms the seed word into his likeness if a pear tree brings forth a pair apple tree and apple things like that his word will bring forth Sons and Daughters of God that's what it's supposed to do so the word of God is is not come forth to give separate Tabernacles the word of God has not come forth to highlight any man highlight any church but the word of God has come forth to highlight Jesus Christ to exalt him and to bring him into the place where he desires in the heart of his children [Music] the same same quote he said one day when the world lay in darkness and Chaos so like like it was in Genesis 1. again notice it was in that same condition again the spirit of God moved upon in the predestinated seed a predestinated seed the predestinated it was transformed it took Isaiah 9 6. Behold a virgin shall conceive so now that light the only way that light could come life could come that would bring a transformation is God had to come in a way that it would pay the price that that life could come back upon the worshiper and bring us back into Fellowship under the blood back into that position back into that place to where our lives are tabernacling deity now the Bible says in John 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men in verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth so it comes from thought to word to flesh that's the pathway that the word travels to become flesh from thought to word to flesh now we understand that you know as we have the Bible and we thank God you know for the lives that the burden became upon the hearts of men like Tyndale and all the rest of them God put that burden there that you and I could have it is that right God knew what we would need in this hour this is why when when the seals themselves have been opened and it's him coming down and it's him that is standing in the midst of his church it is him that is standing in the midst of his bride that's what that seventh seal is it's the coming of the Lord you know there's folds of his coming it's him coming back in to his church that's the quickening power that's the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost he's the one who's in our midst the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ not a Doctrine not another Tabernacle it's him who's in our midst [Music] that's why when brother Brown preaches the seventh seal what's he saved the whole time he is
