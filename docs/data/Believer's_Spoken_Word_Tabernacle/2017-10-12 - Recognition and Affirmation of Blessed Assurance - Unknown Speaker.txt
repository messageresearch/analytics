hallelujah take your Lord Jesus glory to God hallelujah hallelujah oh we are singing our promise amen this is our promise amen you're loving tonight amen let's just turn right into the word in Genesis chapter 28 verse 12 it's so good to be in the house of the Lord tonight and just expecting good things from him anything wonderful to have an expectation it really is it's wonderful to have an expectation verse 12 and let's just read a few verses of war they stop there verse 12 and he dreamed and behold a ladder set upon the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it and behold the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the god of Isaac the land were on thou liest to thee will I give it and to thy seed and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed and behold I am with thee and will keep thee in all places whether thou goest and will bring thee again into this land I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to the earth I want to just go for go into a word of Prayer and I know we have been praying for sister Elizabeth Collins and brother Chuck had just sent me this text here just before coming and this is what brother Chuck had mentioned he says well things could be better they brought in a social worker for the family to talk to us about comfort care but we are still believing but in other words the doctors are giving up hope they did not give us a good report they are saying she is too weak to do a lung transplant she weighs 101 pounds the doctors are not sure what more they can do they are watching her mo hemoglobin levels to see if she is losing any more blood she is a true hero she said she's not done fighting yet please keep praying that the Lord will show his glory through this great vessel of Elizabeth that she is awaiting for his mighty touch amen Lord Jesus Christ is the healer the author and finisher of our faith so I wrote back to brother Chuck and I let him know that even we would have special prayer here tonight how many believes God is not just more than Abel but he's the ever-present God and this is a very very very pressing need that is here and no matter you know we're not disappointed in the doctors we're not disappointed doctors can only do what they can see when we step back from this we recognize that even in the midst of our lives brother venom tells us he says concerning his own life he said when my purpose on earth is finished then I want to go you just didn't say I'm ready he said I want to go because we're here for purpose so knowing this year God is overseeing all of this it was sister Elizabeth's life and so with all of that in mind I make those statements because it we are aware that God is over this whole situation God is over all this situation there is and there is not in any way when we doctors are looking they try all their things they're looking at all that and they can only do what God has given them the ability to tap into but God is greater God is greater God not only can do a lung transplant but God can totally create new life amen God is able to raise levels amen this is the God that we serve the God of paradoxes amen amen so let's let's go before the Lord and a word of Prayer and let's just take it you take it is going to be your wife your your how your husband your loved one your child your mother let's just take it before the throne of God in prayer tonight everyone Heavenly Father Lord God is we come before you tonight Lord you see this great need Lord that is mentioned here but Lord there is

Jesus Christ hallelujah whoa hallelujah or Jesus hallelujah amen glory Oh father you a merciful Lord Oh glory be to God thank you Lord Jesus Oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah amen and we said amen amen god bless you the night as we're being seated I just want to approach the word here tonight and just ask that God would just give us a real Solomon direction by his Spirit I want to I want to speak to you tonight on the thought that I have is recognition and affirmation recognition and affirmation of blessed assurance so we must recognize we must recognize and then we must also affirm what God has said and what we want to look at tonight is blessed assurance certainly we realize that our our salvation is not and has never been up in the air it's it's not something that is conditional in terms of that reliance upon man but I want to draw your attention here tonight as we move into this here in the word of how that we find that God makes known by grace a ladder an access to Jacob and he declares himself the scripture says there in verse 13 that the Lord stood above it and he declared himself that I am the Lord God of Abraham my father as we've been mentioning here for some time I've dealt with this quite extensively in another in another place but this part here I am the Lord God of Abraham that father Abraham in the natural is Jacob's grandfather but God is laying a distinction that Abraham is your father Jacob so it's not making a natural this is not a natural connection here this is a spiritual connection jacob is aware of the covenant aware of these things but now here is a spiritual connection for God to make himself known and I'll say it in this manner that his revelation how God reveals himself he doesn't change when God reveals himself he will reveal more of himself but the revelation of him and who he is is unchanging so it's an unchanging as God is revealing himself to Jacob here it's an unchanging revelation and it's still holding the original promise it's the same unconditional covenant because it's not a covenant that can be done away with the first covenant could be done away with and it was because it was solemnly based just upon what man if man was able to keep his part up so that covenant was dissolved because man was not able to keep his part up so here God sets forth in a foundation this is an unconditional covenant and notice in in verse 7 of Genesis 17 here is God making himself known to Abraham and here is God's God's promise I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee so God is letting it be known to Abraham that this covenant is not going to pass when you pass but this covenant is a covenant that in every generation of thy seed I will establish this covenant that is between you and I I will establish it with thy seed I will be a god unto you and I will also be unto thy seed after thee now we know that this was not just something that was just haphazardly given but yet we find that when this is revealed to Abraham it doesn't cause Abraham to go into a manor of just well God's going to see to it God's going to bring it to the sea but you find that when God reveals and speaks to a person's life they become perseverant in the promise that God has given that's that's the reason God would reveal himself as as as the Prophet tells us and the message absolutely says God revealed himself to Abraham because he knew what Abraham was going to do even when God came to Abraham he says shall I hide that thing which I do seem that Abraham he shall command his household and his children after him so there has to be a word that goes out that is in regards to what this promise but it is solely up to God that God comes on the scene and confirms the promise that is given to every seed for every generation that's something that only God can do so it's like this we can preach the gospel but again it's up to God not one of us can baptize somebody with the Holy Ghost it's up to God to do that that's solemnly but we can baptize here in the tank but we cannot baptized into the body so this is solemnly in God's hands how wonderful that is how wonderful notice he says and I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land where thou art a stranger and all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God and God said unto Abraham thou shalt keep my covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their generations so here an unconditional covenant yet there are conditions that are set forth but the conditions that are that are set forth we know God is requiring that that there would be that covenant sign that God gives to that of Abraham that this covenant sign is to be in the flesh of his see in every generation yet yet we recognize that it's not just having just that sign of circumcision because there were many who had the sign of circumcision even in the days of the Lord Jesus but they failed to recognize their day of visitation you understand what I'm saying there many who had come to a certain Junction in the word but they failed to walk on with the word and the only way you can really come into a proper junction of the word is by revelation it takes divine revelation the Bible said that the righteousness of God is revealed from faith under faith so it must be God that reveals to every person - coming in through justification sanctification into the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then into the fullness of adoption so it must be God so here we find that it's God personally revealing himself as we look here in the word it's God personally revealing himself to the left to the elect to circumcise their heart by his spirit doing what removing that first nature that fleshly nature and setting within them a new nature a different nature and nature of his own life that which is a seed that is quickened and raised up into newness of life this is a sign this is a covenant sign so it's God revealing himself to that of the promised seed every one when God when God communicates this to Abraham remember now our Bible opens up and we begin to read about Abraham in Genesis 12 that's only the writing god always knew Abraham before it was ever in writing he was in God's thoughts you with me so now these thoughts are just beginning to be communicated and means are identified with these thoughts and there the whole time God knew and just like in every seed God knows every Apple every leaf that is there in that seed you don't act one more leaf or one more Apple to that seed everything that it is is in it then and God knew of every seed that he would make himself known to that was not you can see even here by God saying I'm the Lord I'm the Lord God of Abraham the Father God is not speaking of a natural continuity he's speaking of a spiritual revelation that it's not a natural seed it's a spiritual seed oh my so here is God coming coming down to reveal himself spirit us personally to Jacob and let me just go into this here a moment in Galatians chapter 3 the Bible begins to to speak to us even clearly and this as Paul is breaking this apart to Abraham and his seed where the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ so the promise when God is looking and he's declaring this to Abraham he's not talking about a natural seed yet the natural seed is given in type but God's talking about the spiritual seed because God himself he would become one of us and he's talking of that spiritual seed thy seed which is Christ for ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many of us put has have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ for there is neither Jew nor Greek neither is their bond nor free there is neither male nor female for here all one in Christ Jesus and if you be Christ's then are ye Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise so God was not going to reveal himself to every natural seed he wasn't the natural see that God's committed to it's the spiritual seed that which is of himself he will reveal himself and establish his covenant personally just like what we were dealing with a little bit on Sunday every generation has to have their personal visitation every son and daughter of God has to have their personal experience with God every one so God is God is obligating himself oh my because this is not noticed it's just not a condition not a covenant that's based on the strength of Abraham that is not based on Abraham's continuity it is based on God who God had no end he had had no beginning he has no end look how Paul would pick this up again Hebrews chapter 6 verse 13 for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying blessing I will bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee so when God spoke even in the even in the very beginning to Abraham when God spoke this is God swearing by himself this is an oath when God speaks when God's word comes forth it is God it is an oath of God God is committing himself when he speaks directly to Abraham it is God committing himself by his word don't you see when that battle the the RAM was caught in the thicket the RAM here it was it comes a creative Word of God it comes and is caught in the thicket that's the same way when God speaks his word it's God himself that is committing himself and he's committing himself to you and I his cheat his his children he's come how does he do it by his word hey man he's committing himself it's God coming down surely blessing I will bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee in Hebrews 6:15 Paul goes on to say so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise did Abraham have many ups and downs sure the Prophet says it like this and the message look 1963 he said Abraham did not become consumed with the misunderstandings of the promise you see Abraham the Abraham we'll look at Abraham's life you could find a lot of fault and everything else in Abraham's life and Abraham even listened to Sarah in regards to Hagar is that right he listened this is misunderstandings of the promise right I could say that Abraham took a thought and he preached the white horse rider being the Holy Ghost you see misunderstandings of the promise but Abraham did not become consumed with the misunderstandings of the promise and neither are you to be consumed with misunderstandings even in your life is not to be consumed with misunderstandings we don't see things all the way the way we need to see him just reading here even even today or the Prophet was saying of how he said so many times he said God will allow his servants to know things that are here and there he said then other times he won't let us know anything he lets us walk right into troubles why why would God do that so he can make his glory known God knows how how to keep the pride down in our life hmm so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise for men verily swear by the greater and an all for confirmation is to them an end of all strife so a person you know is there I promise you no I promise you no it's like when you go into court they want you to raise the right in there right but how many have lied under oath come on somebody how many of you have made promises and you hadn't kept him brother I promise no I'm not I'm not advocating that I had a brother tell me he said hey brother you said now you're coming to preach for me he said now you're not gonna you're not gonna back out on me he said because you know he said I believe we ought to keep our promises I said brother I do too I said but you know if there's some emergency comes up I'll break you understand I was just glad there what nun came up because I thought it might have you know really troubled that brother but I told my said brother I believe in keeping promises when I've told you I'm gonna be somewhere I said I believe with all my heart when God's laid it on my heart I'm gonna be there sure as the world but how many times have you and I made promises or I'll get to this I'll get to that I'll get to this I'll get to that and what happens to it I promise as the time comes and goes it doesn't get anywhere it's even look friends even in times when the presence of God has moved right down within a service and you and I have now we've been touched by God we have been stirred by God and then we find ourselves getting out right out from under you know coming out of the service and before we know it what we were stirred in our hearts to say Lord I'm more determined Lord I want and we find ourselves within the same condition then that shows the weakness of our promise so it's a lesson to us that it's not for us to make as far as just promises based on that but it would be rather to to acknowledge the weakness of us and the greatness of him and say Lord you who have made known your word you have revealed this you were a drawing of my life help me Lord God I think of how that Israel when the Israel himself when Jacob was changed and he began he comes to an altar and the altar is hello Loa Israel it is that all true it says help me the God who's able to help me live according to my new name amen the God who's able to help me live according to the name of Israel that's what we need that's what we must have amen because we can do a lot of things that we can then we get feeling bad about it but God this is where Paul is drawing this here where in God verse seventeenth willing more abundantly to show under the heirs of promise God wanted you and me to see this sure every generation had God is one of them to see this but God has wanted you and I to see this in this generation this generation I can't speak for another one but I can speak for us in this generation God wants us to know the in humility the immutability of his counsel that when he has promised he surely will perform hallelujah and he can't do it with just giving us just just some work but here he comes down by his living presence I'm telling you friends this is a visitation that God has brought to this generation and the Prophet said my ministry is to declare he is now here him and the presence of God is right here among us and that same presence has not removed it's not taken back but that same presence is here to guide and direct us all the way home he's not left into a man this is he made a promise to himself I will establish my covenant I will bring my children home in rapture he promised himself God more abundantly to show under the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath this word immutability is not to be transposed you don't you don't transpose this it's not to be transferred fixed its unalterable it cannot be altered because it's not based on a man here is not something that was spoken by man it is God who swore by himself you catch what I just said there it's God who swore by himself when God begins to speak that's God swearing by himself they met when he come down here even in the end time what's he doing he's not making a new promise he is affirming to you and I the promise that he already has made and when the open is my seven thunders uttered their voices what is that it's an oath of confirmation it's God signified I have remembered my covenant were you with me when he came down there was a rain more about his head what is it his mind is on his covenant very many speaking according to his covenant he's speaking to his covenant children it's immutability you can't alter this because that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we have a strong consolation who had fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us so he drew you he drew me what we were a part of him so he drew us to a place of refuge they managed it's him that is that place of refuge as it the office estates and here clearly fulfilled in the life of the Lord Jesus to every every into every child of God down through the ages he is that refuge for you and I one who is a culvert in a time of storm one who is a refuge I shall be a man shall be a refuge that man is Christ Jesus he is our refuge we have fled how could we flee because when we may have been looking and we have all these things about our life why is my life like this and why does it seem odd and why does this and why does that you know what that is that's a little seed on the inside before knowledge that's just moving around there but God knows where you were at and God sent forth his word he sent forth a voice to do what to call you out and lead you away from the Babylonian borders and God and conditions of this age he sent a word to lead you out to call you out come out of her my people being knocked our partaker of her deeds advice width us what voice was it his advice of all Madi God hallelujah Omaha and he called you to walk to a place of refuge amen went for it you've still a hold upon the hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which interest into that within the veil whether the forerunner is for us entered even Jesus made a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek an anchor is a precious thing you wonder why a ship is not moving or a boat's not moving it's because there's a connection you can't see the connection you only see the visible reality there's a connection storms and tests they come they Bob it around here Bob it around there but the anchor holds the anchor keeps it was body the flesh the spirit all those things Bob around but the soul is anchored the souls incurred there is an anchor beyond the veil a man and that veil is that veil we're in the Christ Jesus himself as as as entered for you and I it is in him so we see this conditions of an unconditional covenant what's the only condition that God has for an unconditional covenant because everything that we have read and we know of how God is spoke to Abraham I will I will I will I will I will but yet its conditions but not conditions like the conditional covenant the only conditions the only thing that God asked for you and I is to have faith in what what he already has said that's the only thing God asked for you and I have faith so what does faith do faith it brings about yielding and resting in him you with me so here watch how God speaks here let me just take the next little bit here in verse 25 or verse 15 of Genesis 18 God says to Jacob behold I am with thee how precious I am with me and will keep thee in all places whether thou goest and will bring me again into this land for I will not leave me until I have done that which I have spoken to the earth who no wonder David could have a little praise break every once a while and say happy is he whose God is the God of Jacob you with me there's reason because he could see that as far as deserving Jacob didn't deserve it Abraham didn't deserve it and neither do you and I were not here because we deserved it Amen they were not standing here tonight and in the set of soundness of Health or where we're at enjoying but the real a spiritual revelation of God ourselves being natural and being strengthened by Minds being transformed by the renewing of the Holy Ghost we don't deserve that what is it it's God has committed himself to his word he committed himself by speaking his word so here if we noticed in the scripture if we jump to verse 20 of Genesis 28 oh y'all ready you ready Jacob vowed a vow saying if God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on so that I come again to my father's house in peace then shall the Lord be my god so what is Jacob doing here with a vow this is not like you and I you know we think of the term if as though that that that Jacob is making something in a terms of the conditional clause it's not that at all but but in reality of what Jacob is doing here is he is affirming what God has already said in earlier chapters you see it's one thing for Jacob to hear what his daddy told him he can say amen to that but now it's moved beyond that he's no longer just having to take what his daddy said but now he has met God face to face so he's no longer just happening to hear what Dad said but now the God who revealed himself daddy is revealing himself to him and it's no longer something to wear the promises are passed down second handed but the promises are passed and moved very in the first person I will be with thee amen hallelujah so here we're with Jacob when we look at it with the gulls you know in the translation they they lost indeed some of these things here because the language you know and I begin to study this the language is not of uncertainty but it's equivalent to sense or for as much so if I go back and I read that verse of scripture go back up to verse 20 and Jacob vowed a vow saying since God will be with me not if this isn't well I don't know if he's real or not I don't know this is not what this is since God or for as much as God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on it changes it doesn't it it changes it from something of a hope so to way what's he based on faith remember how do we apply the Word of God by faith every promise of God even to that of justification sanctification are you with me to the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the rapture it's appropriated by faith it's what he has already provided and we appropriated in our own lives by faith we recognize the promises for us and we affirm that I am the one as many as the Lord our God shall call we affirm that and what is that we receive blessed assurance personally because you see within this of the scripture when we look at this part here he says as far as God if God is Elohim will be with me there's a lot called Elohim a lot of the gods within the the land Elohim God right first kings 18 what did what did Elijah stand there and say first Kings 18 he said well you come to Mount Carmel and who ever whichever God answers by fire then what let him be the Lord see stepping forward and becoming personal here with me now from glad to become Jehovah let him be personally revealed to you he that answers by fire let him become personal to you glory be to God so here the promises since not if for as much notice I like how it states it Jacob my faith was appropriating and anticipating the fulfillment of the promise there was no question there was no question it was by faith he was not if God but since God will be with me since God was with him he could expect all of these things notice God there in that verse of scripture he God doesn't say anything as far as in the scripture when he made himself known in Jeff in verse 17 of Genesis 18 God didn't say anything about raiment and bread and whatever more that's a given are you with me that's a definite God already listen if God has called you God has ordained you listen God Himself will provide for himself all of your things that you need that's why the Lord Jesus could say he said don't get your mind set on the necessities of this life seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these other things will be added unto you do we have to pray sometimes God provided job God provide Rieman Lord I need food do we have to pray sure we do what we're showing here is that God already has it all taken care of Jacob's just spelling it out right he has needs oh my then that wonderful God God already knows what's your and he knew what your need was be tonight he knew where you've been sitting here tonight and even how you would say it specifically but he already covered it it doesn't matter we can have a multitude of diseases that are sitting in this room tonight even two are just three but yet God has it all covered but by His stripes we are healed I have the Lord that he'll a log on diseases you might say God I need you to move for cancer I need you to move for diabetes I need you to move my blood pressure what I need you to provide a job I need you to provide a house I need you to brah he already is over all of that come on no wonder David could say I've never seen the righteous forsaken never seen a child of God Megan Brennan let's see this was only included this was included it's like everybody put it this simple to you it's like going and asking for a deluxe cheeseburger and then you tell them to put in lettuce and tomato and cheese on it duh that's already included with the deluxe you don't have to tell him I need pickles on it I want mayonnaise on it I want mustard on it I want ketchup on it I want a big ol slice onion on it it's already included with a deluxe you don't have to tell him I want a bacon cheeseburger you know what I like bacon on it gets included you don't order a piece of of apple pie a la mode or whatever it is and say by the way I want that apple pie all along and I want ice cream on there it shows either you don't understand what you're asking for or you're doubting their ability to fulfill everything that is laid out there oh my I'm telling you God has already included everything that you and I have need up sometimes we don't see it we don't hear it right away but we have this assurance I'm living here I'm in this place I'm in this generation and as long as I'm here I am one of his he is committed to his word never seen the righteous forsaken Amen guaranteed by God and verse 15 and accepted by the patriarch as one writer would say like this I've taken up a saying if Elohim will be Jehovah to me then jihad then then then Jehovah will be Elohim to me God will be Jehovah to me and Jehovah will be Elohim to me God will reveal himself to be one who was not agree who is existing with me Jehovah and Jehovah will be what Edel him to me God see that revelation so this is where Jacob is resting he is affirming what God has said watch how God let's just take a little journey here for a few moments Genesis 26 verse 23 and here is isaac and isaac went up from thence to bear sheba he's been digging wells that his father dug and he's been naming them the same names and the Lord appeared unto him the same night and said I am the God of Abraham thy father he's not just a natural it's a spiritual time fear not for I am with thee and will bless thee and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake he was under the blessing because what it wasn't because he was Abraham's bow he was under the blessing because he was the spiritual son of Abraham we're not blessed because were natural progeny of the prophet in this hour we are blessed because we are spiritual sons and daughters that are born of the world that is coming this hour hey man we have been ordained within the wounds of the word and we have stepped fast in this hour it's been a word that has called you around and that word has found its mark within our lives I fear not I'll say that's God's word to every generation it's his word to you and I tonight when God has revealed himself to you and I his word is I'm with me Joshua 1 verse 8 hallelujah let me go to verse 9 just the same time have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed when God writes things here in his word be not afraid neither be thou dismayed there's gonna be times he is afraid there's gonna be times he is dismayed but this is where the word see what the word is doing the weired is giving direction to the word but not so many I'm gonna say hold ya no need to be afraid I don't need to be dismayed the spirit man ain't gonna say that but who's gonna receive this the inner man the inner man then takes that word and stands on it be not afraid be not dismayed what does it do it has an effect upon the rest of the realms be not afraid neither be thou dismayed so where is he gonna draw the strength from from looking into the word that's already gone because the word that's already come is God fulfilling a covenant that he made and made it be known to Abraham it's caught unfolding this covenant and he's letting it be known meditate on it give yourself to it keep yourself in it because what out of here you're gonna draw strength but out of here about spiritual revelation my image is going to be revealed and made known to you you realize friends that just with knowing quotes is not knowing the image of God people can know the scriptures and not know the image of God whatsoever the image of God is not flesh the image of God it's not written the image of God is not letter but the image of God will always project the very harmony and true understanding of what the letter is saying and the only way the image can come is by a spiritual revelation this is how the Lord Jesus walked he was the example of how you and I as sons and daughters are walked he didn't say whatsoever the son here no whatsoever the son Rita nope whatsoever the son see that doeth the father what he seeth the father doing that doeth the son likewise and that same harmony is to exist with our lives and I believe it is cieth what it's to where that the where the understanding is opening up because why he was the first one of this new race he's the first one quickened at the river and that's why the Lord Jesus said except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God so here he was he receives the revelation of God and who God is for God and goes forth in that day what does he do reflect God that's what he could say how long have I been with you in you you don't know me how can we reflect God unless we receive the revelation of God and how can we receive the revelation of God unless we are of God sounds like a family thing dinner to me boom ah be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord by God is with thee whether so ever thou goest in the fitting brother bill this is not mentioned in the middle of the book of Joshua in this fitting it's right in the very beginning it's God letting Joshua know from the onset before you ever step foot in the land this is what I'm saying to you don't fear I am with thee the Lord Jehovah one who is existing with you I'm existing with you my family what is this the comfort its comfort oh my here's a real brave guy by the name of Gideon verse 12 of Genesis 6 here he is he's done heard the prophets message but he goes back out and keeps on throwing you know hiding hiding away throwing you know threshing wheat and he's hiding and the angel of the Lord appeared to him and said unto Him the Lord is with thee thou mighty man of Valor now notice this has he moved from the Prophet now into a place to where the angel of the Lord who directed the Prophet anointed the Prophet who gave the message now the angel of the Lord comes to visit those who the message was intended for and when when Gideon looks at the he does not say this is an angel of the Lord oh this is a great man Gideon talks to him as he would talk to God talk to the guy down with the store selling seed you understand he doesn't hear wasn't like anything not like great like oh my he's talking to him like he talked to anybody else you know God makes himself known in such simplicity you know why God doesn't want to act you don't want acting he wants us to be simple he wants you and I to talk to him because what if this had meant to Gideon if he would have known right away but you see what God does God comes through by way of the word that invokes a question out of Gideon what was it it was a longing that was within Gideon and how did Gideon have that longing he was a part of God and God was longing to express himself the longing that you have within yourself belonging the desire that longing for rapture what is it because God's longing direction when God's longing to heal you it drops notice the Lord is with thee thou mighty man of Valor we know how the Lord had to work on Gideon's life quite a bit God had to deal with Gideon and continued to move with Gideon throughout this is where look at this the Lord is with thee thou mighty man of Valor you know I think you know some years ago but I'm looking at this and preached and I said no doubt Gideon looked around said who's the other fella in the room he sure ain't talking about me he's looking at the biggest chicken there ever was but he's seen an eagle down beneath him chicken feathers it's an eagle down there on the inside the Lord is with thee now notice this God being with him would not leave him in his fear he wouldn't leave him in a place of unsettledness but he said go get your offering go get your yeah what's your gonna offer I'll go and get it put it here on the rock what does he do he's working with him all the way God says go down and I want you to tear down altars that are there in your daddy's place and I understand you're fearful God night and the most important thing is he's doing it whoa don't let the devil try to trick you into clowning for him Rain Man you obey God's Word you don't have to mind the devil at all the devil could have got on his children said if you were a real son of God a real faith you'd do it in daylight but God knew what he wanted to do it at nighttime because they didn't know who threw it down but then there came the response if bail is God he should be able to protect his own altar hallelujah we find that that goes on what was it the Lord is with thee the Lord being with they didn't mean that it's always a shouting time in the Jubilee time the Lord being with you is God committed to his word to bring you from start to finish even through his long suffering his patience him dealing with us it's God working with us all the time whether there's fleeces on the ground and that's this side it's wet her next time on the ground is wet and that's Rob it's God himself that is committed to his word understand you can't compare a desert to a get in and then they can you compare getting in the David they are each coming to maturity you understand if you compare a Gideon to a David you'll say getting her that guy's a little wishy-washy no sir that's not the way it is in God's eye at all it's God bringing maturity within their life it's God's showing the greatness of His grace that will overcome all the complexes Gideon had a lot of complexes in his life but the grace of God is always overriding that God appeared to Mary and let her know her the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women it wasn't just something that she that the Lord just happened to be with her then he was with her the whole time hey man he was watching over her life the whole time no doubt the enemy you know look let's look friends when when when Satan sees that there's a little bit of a you know something to wear that he's kind of drawn maybe there were things that about Mary's life that he's kind of looking at and he knows a virgin's going to conceive so no doubt no doubt how the enemy had everything so tangled to try to Mar life after life after life after life but yet this was where God was protecting and watching over Mary there were certain things that she turned down maybe she wouldn't have thought there was anything Supernatural about her decision at that moment but it was God directing her away from that pathway what was it it was God watching over as God told Jacob not I will be I am worth a now and I will stay with thee God had his hand look at this of how that God speaks in Isaiah 41 fear'd I'm not you're speaking of Israel fear thou not I am with thee be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen thee yea I will help thee yea I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness behold all they that are incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded they shall be as nothing and they stat strive with these Shall Perish thou shalt seek them and thou shall not find them even then that contended with thee they that war against thee shall be as nothing and as a thing of not I'm telling you this this is a promise for you and I even the things that you're contending and fighting right now remember I am received I will give thee strength I will help thee I will I will overcome through you I will manifest my overcoming power I will strengthen you and that thing that you with and contended with I will make known my glory and you shall see there is no more contention for I the LORD have help thee [Applause] for the for how the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand what's that right hand by strength I will hold that strength saying unto thee fear not I will help thee did you catch that saying unto thee what's it mean he's gonna keep saying when he needs to say I will help thee I was up thee fear not I will help thee I don't know about you but I'm glad that he still speaks I'm glad that he still comes by and says fear not I will help thee fear not I'm helping me fear not hang up Andy what's he doing this is way promised I will come and I will say this unto you Hebrews 13:5 let not your conversation be with covetousness and be content with such things as you have this is a battle now don't just think of it as oh yes I'd like to have little other seats and I'd like them to be cooled I'd like them to be heated and look friends sometimes we're in the midst of this let your conversation be without covetousness and we can look up on other lives and think I wish I had it easy like them and what you're saying you're seeing a son and daughter of God and you have no idea what kind of battles they go through let me retract that you do have an idea because you go through the same battles it's just what you're saying is is that one that has been able by God's grace to may come under that maturity and be able to look and direct their focus and attitude away from present circumstances that look very bleak and very dismal but they're able to look what is that that's letting be let all that everything before the side without covering us being content contend with what content with who I am in the Lord and who God has made himself known to me so he said this is where I rest for he has said I will never leave thee nor forsake so that we may boldly say boldly wonder what boldly means boldly don't necessarily mean we're youwere yelling it out boldly speaks of confidence it's a humility in his presence not well I think that the Lord had I you know I really believe God oh I think you helped me that's not affirming that's not affirming if I can put it to you like this he's the high priest of your confession that I think he can I think he will he's still setting and not acting the rare the way the way to bring him in action is to affirm his word by face I am the lord that healeth all thy diseases the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me was directing our attention to him oh my let me just have just a few more moments can I Isaiah 43 verse 1 I'll speak fast you listen fast but now thus saith the Lord that created the old Jacob and he that formed the O Israel fear not for I have redeemed thee I have called me by name thou art mine when thou passer through the waters I will be with thee through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when that walk is through the fire that shall not be burdened neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee I think there's three boys Hebrew boys they told the king we don't know whether God will deliver us from the fire but he will deliver us from you what were they looking the Lord is my help there had to be a promise that they could stand on to even know that God has said I will deliver you from the flame they even happened that you said by the same they said they didn't know that's exactly right it wasn't revealed to them but there is a promise in God's Word what is God letting him be known right here that there is nothing that can take you out without I first have given permission Oh glory be to God I'm talking about an immutable counselor what assignment what should that do it should relieve all fear it should be able you're to take a word and be able to cast out fear so I am THE LORD thy God the Holy One of Israel thy Savior I gave Egypt for thy ransom Ethiopia and save it for thee since that was precious in my sight thou has been honorable I have loved thee therefore will I give men for thee and people for thy life fear not I am with thee I will bring thy seed from the east and gather thee from the west I will say to the north give up and to the south keep not back bring my son's from far and like daughters from the ends of the earth even everyone that is called by my name for I have created him for my glory I have formed him yay I have made him God is committed to calling every one of his children though they may have went to the north though they may went to the south no matter whether at his word will find them wherever they're at I'm telling you this is not only God promising himself to Israel where he had dropped back his children calling him back home but God has called his children in this hour back home God has said to the North give up my sons God has said to the south give up my daughter's God I said to thee give up my son give up my daughters what is his word that's brought an authority and a command let him go [Applause] amen I will bring him back to me I will not leave thee until I have performed what I have spoken unto the earth I'm gonna bring you all the way back home Jacob I'm not talking about just to an earthly home you are in my mind before the foundation of the world and God begins to reveal himself to you and I what is it raises up to us Ferb we recognize I am NOT the son of James and Pat browning I'm a son of God what happens we begin to affirm what God is declaring and what did he say I'll bring you back home I'll bring you back to myself I'll bring you in a body change I will bring maturity in your life while watching over you and every pathway and every little and every little crook and every little place along the way but I will bring you back to myself I'm watching over and guiding and directing your footstep I will bring you that and I will not depart from thee until I have performed it see God I'm not gonna read these but let me refer to him God affirms his promise I read that one earlier in Isaiah God said saying fear not I am with thee God let it be known in the book of Deuteronomy when you go into battle I want you to remember I the Lord him with me he said let them draw near let them draw near as they approach into the battle battle and when you come into the battle let it be declared I am the Lord your God that goes with you to fight you fight for you against your enemies to save you God wanted that said you with me tonight God wanted that said that's where that when God would speak right down through his word sometimes it might come out word for word for word but God is affirming his promise Oh over and over to you and I God brings it this angle God brings that that angle God brings it this angle and God knows exactly when you're in a battle when you're headed to a battle and God knows how to show up and God knows how to affirm his word to you and I how the LORD thy God am with thee when they got discouraged in the time of building the temple and building up that temple they got discouraged and they started talking like the enemy but time has not come this is not the time to build the tabernacle of God where did they get that from they didn't get that from God they didn't get that from them from from the messengers what happened they become discouraged by false accusations I could preach a whole lot on that they become discouraged well you reckon that Satan is the accuser of the brother he wants the accuser and he's there to accuse day and night but has the prophet speaks to you and I and lets us know that our Father is there to declare yes Adam did this yes they were born into this back there is a blood that has spoke for them already hallelujah accusation over with what you don't know I shut up I don't want to hear it because there is nothing there Lord God may we take lessons like that shut up I don't want to hear it you're gonna talk about this one talk about shut up I don't want to hear it because either you're gonna prophesy like Moses oh you're gonna prophesy like Balaam either you're gonna point out the good or you're gonna point out the bad come on somebody and whatever you do determines what spirits you're under you understand we're not talking about pointing out sin Balaam was trying to find fault he was trying to find fault and point out all the weak places and all the hind remotes but notice even with his great determination God said I'll turn your mouth around boy and God what did he come right down to God never revealed himself to Balaam as Ward God never it was never a personal revelation God made known to Balaam not Lord God God he could prophesy he could speak but he never had a relationship with God and even in the midst of that God over all right in the midst of it and he begins to speak of the hollow trees he begins to speak of the great promises all glory be to God it matters what Spirit doesn't it glory be to God hear how a guy stands in this time let's stand hey guy stands in the midst of this time when accusation has come and God directs Hege odd to say you guys are saying that the time that's not coming who said that but see it wasn't something they were so much saying here they were saying it here here so they were saying it this is not the time you could tell by the way they were conducting their lives God God looked at him through hegau and said look at you you got better jobs than you ever had more money in you ever had but you see I won't let you be content with that you put it down on the table I blew on it so that you're making more but yet you have less why why would God do that because God is interested in his purpose being fulfilled and so Hagee eyes speaks to those brothering in verse 13 of hege i wanna i love this i love this scripture then spake Haggai the lord's messenger in the lord's message unto the people saying i and with you say you know solomon mentions because let me just look at this for a moment when God says I am with thee Solomon said let let God be with us as he was with our fathers why it's not just it wasn't just a just that Lord wait we just want your presence but Solomon knew that by the presence of God that it would be God guiding and God directing the people as a matter of fact Solomon said like this that he might incline our arts to walk in his way so what will the Lord God being with them what would he do incline the hearts calls the heart to be tender cause the heart to seek after his way the presence of God is here to transform us and don't be mistaken when I say transformation I'm not just talking about a new birth but the Prophet takes it even a step deeper and he says now that we've been saved now that we've been filled with the Holy Ghost may we receive the transformation by the renewing of the mind of Christ what is that speaking maturity come from birth into full maturity full adoption what's he renewing he's renewing our mind by the Holy Ghost changing us so here is here's the comfort we have I thought of that scripture today if God be for us who can be against us let me say since God is for us who can be against us not if since for as much as God is for us who can be against us being confident of this one thing that he that have begun the good work in you shall perform it until the day of Jesus Christ I will not leave me I'll be with me and I will bring me back I will be with me what a blessed assurance that is laid for us here within our lives in our hearts I say Lord granite granite lon let me let the greatness of that immune ability let it so move and resolve dissolving every doubt dissolving anything that's unlike you Lord let it dissolve everything Lord casting out all fear removing Lord remnants of Samuel or removing remnants Lord God anything that is hindering because your counsel Lord cannot be defeated so Lord I surrender I surrender Lord let it be Lord God what you have spoken Lord not my promise Lord but let your promise be fulfilled Lord God your promise Lord hallelujah let's just pray tonight more Jesus father God we largest sense in our hearts Lord what a renewing Lord what a great consolation Lord you passing right by way here tonight Lord

discouraged but you can think back on him who made the promise he knows just exactly where you're at he knows troubles he knows things that have come along your way but his promise he is faithful to his word to perform it and you can stand up on that word I will perform what I have spoken concerning you glory so you can walk on forward walk on into the body change walking forward in the word of
