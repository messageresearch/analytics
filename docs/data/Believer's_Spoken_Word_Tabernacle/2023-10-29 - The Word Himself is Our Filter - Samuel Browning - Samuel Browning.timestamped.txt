[36:20] week there with um brother Jim shoem
[36:24] mate and the marriage banquet was there
[36:25] on Saturday but we certainly appreciate
[36:27] your prayers and just to see how God
[36:30] just so
[36:31] sovereignly comes in in the services and
[36:34] things to where that afterwards you know
[36:37] you you you understand how that God has
[36:40] moved so precisely for needs and hearts
[36:43] to minister to lives that even recently
[36:46] have just come to the Lord and God just
[36:49] takes a you know a thought and just
[36:51] drops a thought on your heart and begins
[36:53] to minister amen and God cares about us
[36:57] he cares about his children and and so I
[37:00] just I want to say thank you your the
[37:02] prayers the Lord has just there with
[37:04] many different um needs I believe the
[37:06] Lord uh met and so I want to say thank
[37:10] you for your prayers and I didn't get a
[37:12] chance to do that on Thursday I want to
[37:14] mention to you as well that the love
[37:17] offering and we were scheduled to take
[37:19] that on U next Sunday but since I'm not
[37:22] going to be here I want to just wait
[37:25] until the following Sunday if that'd be
[37:27] all right so the deacons are posted on
[37:29] that um I'm not going to go into the
[37:31] depths of the need but it is uh for
[37:33] someone that the deacons um had brought
[37:36] this to my attention that has as a part
[37:38] here of the assembly so I know there's
[37:40] been those that's already wrote and
[37:41] they've already uh um placed it in the
[37:44] box back there or in the baskets you can
[37:47] just write love offering if you feel to
[37:49] do it ahead of time and which some have
[37:52] so we just um ask that you would do that
[37:55] I know that uh you know know we don't
[37:57] have any none of us are rich none of us
[37:59] are wealthy but I know that one thing
[38:01] our our God is sufficient amen and so
[38:05] let's just let's just be in prayer about
[38:07] that as well I want to just ask you as
[38:10] we prepare to read our scripture here
[38:13] this morning I have uh a text here of a
[38:16] few verses I'm going to read and I'm
[38:18] just certainly asking that you would
[38:20] help me and pray that God will just help
[38:23] me to deliver it as he's put on my heart
[38:24] a few weeks ago the Lord just really
[38:27] begin to deal with this subject and I've
[38:29] just been pouring over it here didn't
[38:31] know exactly when we were going to speak
[38:33] it but I want to speak here this morning
[38:35] on a thought the word himself is our
[38:40] filter the word himself is our filter in
[38:44] numbers 19
[38:47] verse1 and the Lord spake unto Moses and
[38:50] unto Aaron
[38:51] saying this is the ordinance of the law
[38:54] which the Lord hath commanded saying
[38:57] Speak unto the children of Israel that
[39:00] they bring thee a red heer without spot
[39:04] wherein is no blemish and upon which
[39:07] never came yoke and ye shall give her
[39:10] unto Eleazar the priest that he may
[39:13] bring her forth without the camp and one
[39:17] shall slay her before his face and
[39:20] elazer the priest shall take of her
[39:22] blood with his finger and sprinkle of
[39:25] her blood directly before the Tabernacle
[39:28] of the congregation seven times and one
[39:32] shall burn the heer in his sight her
[39:36] skin and her flesh and her blood with
[39:40] her dung shall he burn so want you just
[39:42] to focus on that it's to burn the whole
[39:45] hepher not just part of it and not just
[39:48] Parts but the entirety which speaks of
[39:51] the entirety of the
[39:54] word verse 6 and the priest shall take
[39:58] Cedarwood and hisp and Scarlet and cast
[40:02] it into the midst of the burning
[40:05] hepher then the priest shall wash his
[40:07] clothes and he shall bathe his flesh in
[40:09] water and afterward he shall come into
[40:12] the camp and the priest shall be unclean
[40:14] until the evening and he that burneth
[40:17] her shall wash his clothes in water and
[40:20] B his flesh in water and shall be clean
[40:23] until the even and then we want to
[40:24] really draw from verse 9 here and a man
[40:27] that is clean Shall Gather up the ashes
[40:30] of the hepher and lay them without the
[40:34] camp in a clean place and it shall be
[40:37] kept for the
[40:39] congregation of the children of Israel
[40:42] for a water of Separation it is a
[40:45] purification for sin so we want to look
[40:49] at that thought the word
[40:51] himself is our filter may God bless you
[40:54] and bless the reading of the word as
[40:56] your being
[41:01] seated I think as I go through here
[41:03] today and
[41:05] um we uh I'll have some different slides
[41:09] at times that
[41:10] I'll have the brothers have them to pull
[41:13] up at times and
[41:16] um things that in order to give us a a
[41:19] visual and some points to think of in
[41:21] concerning this but I want to just draw
[41:24] your attention and I'm sure that the the
[41:27] title that the Lord has pressed on my
[41:29] heart will will mean very much to you
[41:31] and I I just say it in this way the
[41:33] background we've been looking at with
[41:35] the depths of God's grace we've been
[41:36] looking at humility and uh one of the
[41:39] things that so uh struck my heart when
[41:42] we were looking at these things is you
[41:45] know the holy spirit will start starts
[41:47] taking you and channeling you into
[41:49] certain thoughts uh within the message
[41:52] and so with from the previous uh few few
[41:55] weeks just over and over I can't even
[41:57] tell you how many times uh where the
[42:00] Lord referred me back and then I just
[42:01] have continued to pour through it and
[42:03] that is the message of a thinking man's
[42:05] filter and so I'd encourage you that
[42:07] even after this morning after we're
[42:09] finished here this morning even through
[42:10] the week and through the time uh to go
[42:13] through and to listen to that and it's
[42:16] just just a wonderful message to glean
[42:18] from of what God has given and provided
[42:21] for us and we want to try to tap into
[42:23] that a little bit this morning so I may
[42:25] we'll just see how the Lord will take us
[42:27] but I want to draw your attention to a
[42:28] few places in our text because the Old
[42:32] Testament itself I know that there is in
[42:34] incredible I was talking with um one
[42:37] particular uh brother here some weeks
[42:39] back and he was speaking of one of the
[42:41] relatives in his family who uh a very
[42:44] good Baptist man but you know and even
[42:47] would uh speak and things like that but
[42:49] he said I've I've never went into the
[42:51] Old Testament at all and I I don't you
[42:54] know not not to really read it and I've
[42:56] never preached from it and I I just say
[42:58] it in this way remember when the Holy
[43:01] Spirit would would speak to the prophet
[43:03] when the squirrels uh right there where
[43:06] they were spoken to existence and he was
[43:08] there up Sportsman's Hollow and he saw
[43:10] those rainbows and even where the same
[43:13] thing that was mentioned there where
[43:15] Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new
[43:18] it's God that has laid down in type all
[43:21] the way through the Old Testament now I
[43:23] I will say this in a manner that with
[43:26] without the Holy Spirit uh giving us
[43:28] direction of this there's many men that
[43:30] have went through the Old Testament and
[43:32] pulled out symbols here and there and
[43:34] but you know God has a way of
[43:37] vindicating what is really the truth
[43:39] behind the symbol or behind the act that
[43:42] was done because everything itself is to
[43:45] point to Jesus Christ everything so if
[43:49] there's anything any thought or any
[43:51] symbol that any way takes away from him
[43:56] from being the same then it's not the
[43:58] right thought it's a thought to be laid
[44:01] aside and say Lord I want your thought
[44:04] so we understand that from the Old
[44:05] Testament into the new the Old Testament
[44:07] when we look at it of Old and New
[44:10] Testament is two books it's that of
[44:12] Groom that of bride because here Christ
[44:15] himself come to fulfill the Old
[44:17] Testament and now through his life now
[44:19] comes forth the new testament which is
[44:22] his life in The Believer so we see
[44:25] within the book two book two books old
[44:27] and new it's husband and wife so there's
[44:30] not contradictory but they are
[44:32] complimentary they are one and so when
[44:34] we look here in the book of of numbers
[44:37] uh uh when we see this the Bible I want
[44:40] to just draw your attention to certain
[44:41] points in here before I go any further
[44:44] it says the red heer must be that
[44:47] sacrifice with no spot no blemish you
[44:50] know it can't even have one
[44:54] hair that's off C
[44:58] not even one hair the rabbis when they
[45:01] look for that even as they started years
[45:03] ago there in the 90s and bringing that
[45:05] back into Israel and looking at it in
[45:07] preparation for temple worship there is
[45:10] such a scrutiny upon that sacrifice you
[45:13] would say well why would that be I want
[45:15] you to think about it because God
[45:18] himself never came down with Hit and
[45:20] Miss he fulfilled the entire book are
[45:24] you with me it wouldn't have been enough
[45:25] just to fulfill this prophecy and leave
[45:27] this one undone because it's a
[45:29] fulfillment of the word of God it was
[45:32] God no one Jesus Christ was no less he
[45:36] was all of God it was God made flesh
[45:39] Among Us so the red heph must have no
[45:42] spot or no blemish and has never can
[45:45] never have been yolked it must be an
[45:47] innocent one yolked meaning that it's
[45:49] never been yolked up with anything so it
[45:52] it can't be something that's been used
[45:54] elsewhere but it some something that has
[45:56] never been yolked it speaks of the word
[46:00] of God himself it's not yolked with the
[46:03] denomination it's not yolked with a man
[46:06] God does not take a denominational truth
[46:09] and bring it forth but God himself it's
[46:11] only God bringing him forth himself
[46:13] forth it also must be led forth without
[46:17] the camp it cannot be killed within the
[46:20] camp remember the Bible says in Hebrews
[46:22] that he suffered without the camp and
[46:25] Paul said let us go forth unto him
[46:28] without the camp is that right and that
[46:31] camp that even that you and I look at is
[46:34] the camp that goes beyond just of of
[46:36] denominational thinking which when we
[46:38] think of denominational thinking a
[46:40] person can have denominational thoughts
[46:41] and not even have the particular name of
[46:43] a denomination they've got their own
[46:45] brand and their own thought line to
[46:47] things but so we understanding that it's
[46:49] beyond the reasoning go beyond the
[46:52] reasoning because man can know God he
[46:54] can reason things out you can reason the
[46:57] truth out man can reason out the
[46:59] scripture man can say this is true and
[47:01] that is true and that's true but you got
[47:03] to go beyond that you got to go beyond
[47:05] that because to go beyond that is to go
[47:07] into the camp of the Living God because
[47:10] you see we must go unto him and go into
[47:13] the camp of the Living God the
[47:15] supernatural go beyond our own ideas go
[47:18] beyond our own thoughts that's what the
[47:20] grace of God comes to call us beyond
[47:24] that and all of that red heer is to be
[47:27] burnt with fire not just parts of it but
[47:30] all of it so it's in it's it is speaking
[47:33] of the entirety of the word of God and
[47:37] all of the parts there's many great
[47:38] things that we could bring forth out of
[47:40] there but like when it's placed in with
[47:42] the types of the cedar wood and you know
[47:45] the scarlet and the hissop and the cedar
[47:47] wood speaking of the Cross and Scarlet
[47:49] speaking of Lamb's wool died red and and
[47:52] that of hup speaking of the common faith
[47:54] and brother Ram says that that's the
[47:56] humility which the gospel should always
[47:57] be presented in so it's all of this must
[48:00] be brought together and with that of the
[48:02] heer and the ashes themselves after what
[48:05] has been offered are gathered by a clean
[48:08] man and they're kept in a clean Place
[48:11] mixed with water and used for a water of
[48:14] separation of purification from sin so
[48:18] and I want you to notice this last part
[48:20] which we read in the scripture there it
[48:23] says it in this manner and it shall be
[48:26] kept for the congregation of
[48:30] Israel God has a specific mind a
[48:33] specific people when God has made a
[48:36] propit tuation and a way this is to be
[48:39] kept for the children of Israel let me
[48:43] just say this to you and this morning me
[48:45] and you both God himself knew that you
[48:49] and I would be here in this age he knew
[48:53] there would be a desire in our heart for
[48:57] him and God has provided for you and I a
[49:02] true filter that we might be free of the
[49:06] contaminants of the world the world
[49:09] system the church system from every
[49:12] defilement of sin and everything that's
[49:15] unlike him God has provided this himself
[49:19] for you and
[49:24] I Lord now the Bible says with that in
[49:27] mind the Bible says in Ephesians
[49:29] 5:22 I want you to think of that of how
[49:32] that it's kept wives submit yourselves
[49:35] unto your own husbands as unto the Lord
[49:39] for the husband is the head of the wife
[49:42] even as Christ is the head of the church
[49:45] and he is the savior of the body
[49:49] therefore as the church is subject unto
[49:52] Christ so let the wives be to their
[49:55] their own husbands in everything now I
[49:58] don't want to get off on this here this
[50:00] morning but when we read the word submit
[50:03] and subjection it's not a demand and
[50:07] it's even greater than just
[50:09] obedience it's
[50:11] honor it's where it's an obedience out
[50:14] of love because one could obey even
[50:17] their husband could even obey the word
[50:19] and it not be
[50:21] correct because it must be in love amen
[50:25] it's honor so now verse 25 husbands here
[50:31] this is this is tremendous husbands love
[50:34] your wives even as Christ also loved the
[50:38] church and gave himself for it who is he
[50:43] he's our he's our husband he gave
[50:46] himself for us what was the purpose of
[50:48] his coming his purpose of his coming is
[50:50] to redeem Hallelujah the Bible said the
[50:53] son of man has come to seek and saved
[50:55] that which was lost so at one time it
[50:58] wasn't lost the gospel isn't God coming
[51:01] down and you know somebody here or there
[51:04] is going to feel sorry for him and you
[51:05] know they're you know have a little bit
[51:06] of an emotional move but it's come to
[51:09] claim back what belong to him this is
[51:13] the savior of the body just like when
[51:15] Adam when the fall had taken place and
[51:18] Eve was moved by an anointing of
[51:21] deception Adam himself was not deceived
[51:25] Adam himself saw what was needed in that
[51:29] hour in order to protect her from the
[51:31] wrath of God it must and it would
[51:34] require that seed of himself to be
[51:37] placed within her and he took her unto
[51:40] himself so where Satan had went to bring
[51:43] the distance God here in a type Adam
[51:46] coming down which would be a type of the
[51:48] second Adam and would take a bride unto
[51:51] himself you and I who were unworthy we
[51:56] and ourselves were unfit we were undone
[51:58] we were born in sin shaped in iniquity
[52:01] and come to the world speaking lies but
[52:04] down beneath that darkness in our
[52:08] lives was always a son and daughter of
[52:12] God and in order in order for the wrath
[52:16] of God to pass over in order for the
[52:19] grace of God to come to you and I it
[52:22] must come to where that God can come
[52:24] down and he unites with his bride once
[52:28] again his children in a union by his
[52:31] Spirit living inside of you and
[52:34] I
[52:36] then these two have become
[52:40] one so I think this is very
[52:43] 25 husbands love your wives even as
[52:46] Christ also loved the church and he gave
[52:49] himself for
[52:51] it when I think of this of the filter of
[52:54] the word of God the thought thoughts
[52:56] that ring through my heart is it's made
[52:58] possible by the grace of
[53:00] God grace made this possible why what
[53:04] what was the purpose that he might
[53:06] sanctify it and cleanse it with the
[53:09] washing of Water by the
[53:13] word that he might present it to himself
[53:16] a glorious church not having spot or
[53:20] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[53:23] should be holy and without blemish this
[53:27] is the purpose of him coming the savior
[53:29] of the body that he might give of
[53:32] himself in order to sanctify and cleanse
[53:35] that this this church his body his wife
[53:39] that he chose before the foundation of
[53:41] the world because remember Jesus said
[53:43] you've not chosen me but I have chosen
[53:47] you you could say well I made a decision
[53:50] to serve God but you couldn't make that
[53:52] decision unless God himself there was a
[53:55] decision already made before the
[53:57] foundation of the world the Bible said
[54:00] in Revelations 13:8 the lamb was
[54:02] slain before the foundation of the
[54:06] world and Isaiah when he speaks in
[54:08] Isaiah 53 he's not speaking of and he
[54:12] will and he will but he speaks in past
[54:16] tense that it's it's finished he was
[54:20] despised he was
[54:22] rejected Isaiah was picked up by the
[54:25] spirit of the Living God and he saw the
[54:28] finished work the coming of a redeemer
[54:30] that's why the Sons and Daughters of God
[54:33] shouted for Joy that's why God could
[54:36] take job when job could not understand
[54:38] what was taking place in his life and
[54:41] job was looking all around and God first
[54:43] of all the first place that God would
[54:45] take him to before he ever would begin
[54:48] to unfold to job you're in a process job
[54:51] right now but he first would take him
[54:53] back to the foundation that is sure
[54:56] where were
[54:57] you when the Sons and Daughters of God
[55:00] shouted for
[55:03] Joy
[55:04] Hallelujah so it all speaks of
[55:07] redemption when we read here in numbers
[55:10] 19 it speaks of redemption it's Christ
[55:13] he is that red
[55:16] heer Hallelujah he came down in order to
[55:20] pay the the alls sufficient price for
[55:23] you and I but let me just say this this
[55:25] is where this is where it it becomes
[55:28] different for you and I we're not just
[55:30] looking out on Calvary and saying oh oh
[55:32] how I thank God for a sacrifice but
[55:35] we're recognizing that sacrifice it came
[55:38] to do a real work in my life it came to
[55:41] sanctify me and clean me up it came in
[55:44] order that that life inside of that
[55:46] blood cell might come and bring me into
[55:50] rightful position in the body as the
[55:52] Lamb's
[55:53] wife it's not just a good
[55:58] story this Bible is not a collection of
[56:01] good
[56:02] stories that are somehow fitted to make
[56:05] people feel good or Sunday school
[56:08] eligible this is the book of
[56:11] redemption it's a book of
[56:14] Prophecy hallelujah it's God's mind
[56:17] revealed his will revealed in letter
[56:23] form Hallelujah
[56:27] Bible would
[56:29] say that it was by the grace of God that
[56:31] he would taste death for all
[56:34] men that he who was rich became
[56:39] poor for our
[56:41] sakes for our
[56:44] sakes I want you to think there's a lot
[56:47] of times with
[56:49] filters moving into my point here a lot
[56:53] of various filters No Doubt out with in
[56:55] our mind you can go through a lot of
[56:58] things with that of the
[57:01] filter you know there's every filter
[57:05] itself and uh it always has a specific
[57:09] purpose you have a coffee
[57:11] filter coffee filters
[57:14] for coffee but but
[57:18] why why I mean I love
[57:23] coffee
[57:27] but it's to filter out the
[57:30] grounds and to allow the coffee to pass
[57:35] through the furnace filters that we
[57:40] have they're for a specific
[57:43] purpose they're to allow the
[57:46] air that the unit is drawing through the
[57:49] return to take pull air out of here and
[57:52] whether we need it heated or cooled
[57:55] but the filter is to block
[57:57] out stop unwanted
[58:01] things whether it's allergens or
[58:06] dust so there's purposes there's a
[58:08] reason why you would choose you wouldn't
[58:09] put a coffee filter on the
[58:12] furnace
[58:15] right there's water there's water
[58:17] filters on our
[58:19] refrigerators right sometimes people
[58:22] have water filtration systems on their
[58:25] water coming in their home because it's
[58:27] what they call hard water what do they
[58:30] have to work
[58:31] with but that filter is for a specific
[58:35] reason it's to filter out
[58:38] unwanted things and allow desirable
[58:42] things to pass through
[58:44] it is that right now I'm going to have
[58:49] them here in just a moment I'm going to
[58:50] have them display a few things here
[58:53] you're aware when brother Brandon went
[58:54] through this of a thinking man's
[58:57] filter and uh I just I'm just as the
[59:02] Lord just pressed on my heart with this
[59:03] Bri if you give me that first
[59:08] slide this is this is probably the the
[59:11] only time I think uh here we would have
[59:16] a cigarette displayed in
[59:20] church and believe me I really wrestled
[59:22] with that but you know a couple weeks
[59:24] ago the Lord and I didn't know when it
[59:25] was going to be but he put on my heart
[59:27] for visual cuz sometimes the visual part
[59:29] but you remember when brother Brown
[59:30] talks about he's walking through the
[59:32] woods and he said when he was walking
[59:35] through the woods and i' I've got some
[59:36] things even to say with this here but as
[59:38] he was walking through the woods brother
[59:40] BM says I I happen to look down when
[59:41] he's getting shot at all around and he
[59:44] said I looked down and I seen this
[59:45] cigarette pack and brother BR didn't
[59:46] want to call the name but he says I seen
[59:50] where it was a certain tobacco company
[59:52] and he said' this is what it said a
[59:54] thinking man's filter and a smoking
[59:57] man's
[59:59] taste and brother Bram said I thought if
[1:00:02] a man could think at all he wouldn't
[1:00:07] smoke right now let me just tell you of
[1:00:11] the deception within this brother BR
[1:00:13] points this out and as I've been
[1:00:14] studying on this and looking at this I
[1:00:17] remember growing up as a young boy and I
[1:00:19] remember seeing on the back of you know
[1:00:21] fil and stream and you know you go to
[1:00:22] the barber shops the magazines you news
[1:00:24] and World Report laying around and you'd
[1:00:27] see the marbor man and whatever but when
[1:00:29] I went back into this time frame I saw
[1:00:33] going along with this same thing I saw
[1:00:36] what was presented the kind that your
[1:00:38] doctor
[1:00:40] smokes the kind that your dentist
[1:00:43] approves of actual advertisements like
[1:00:45] this what was it it's to it's a
[1:00:50] deception to cause the alertness to go
[1:00:54] down
[1:00:57] this is
[1:00:58] okay and so then if you go to the next
[1:01:02] go to the next slide for me brother Bram
[1:01:05] said when he read that that slogan and
[1:01:08] I've got a purpose in coming to this as
[1:01:09] we tie it together he said he said the
[1:01:12] slogan he said something seemed to say
[1:01:14] with me maybe go back to the previous
[1:01:15] side some something said to
[1:01:18] me the Sloan's all
[1:01:20] right and brother BR says it came to me
[1:01:24] that deceitfulness in the natural realm
[1:01:27] there in the tobacco is something on the
[1:01:30] order of churches today a
[1:01:34] deceitfulness and he says the whole
[1:01:37] world has become a great deception of
[1:01:40] what is really true and what's
[1:01:46] right I mean the prophet is seeing it in
[1:01:49] seed form
[1:01:51] there what we're seeing is no longer
[1:01:54] seeds we're seeing the fruit of it we're
[1:01:58] seeing and we're living in a day where
[1:02:00] right is called wrong and wrong is
[1:02:03] called
[1:02:04] right we're living in a day and you
[1:02:06] would if you know you and I were looking
[1:02:09] at that you would say well that's
[1:02:11] confusion I want to remind you Babylon
[1:02:15] is
[1:02:16] confusion her religion promotes
[1:02:21] confusion there were those who came out
[1:02:24] out of
[1:02:25] there but they went right back to her
[1:02:29] because the Bible says this had
[1:02:32] daughters
[1:02:33] also and she was full of Blasphemous
[1:02:37] names is that right this is the
[1:02:39] scripture what's Blasphemous name is to
[1:02:43] have a name with no
[1:02:48] life now the deception that's here now
[1:02:52] go to that next slide if you could this
[1:02:54] is where and Visually just to now to
[1:02:57] check in from this because I I I you
[1:02:59] know I I'm probably certain that every
[1:03:01] one of us at some point in time but I
[1:03:02] don't know even for our young kids and I
[1:03:04] hope for our young ones they never never
[1:03:06] have to see this and never know of it
[1:03:09] but to understand where the Holy Spirit
[1:03:11] would direct the prophet within this
[1:03:14] particular thing when he would look at
[1:03:15] that package of where they were
[1:03:17] promoting a filter in that time and they
[1:03:21] were promoting that filter as a way of
[1:03:24] well you know you're not you're not
[1:03:26] getting anything through it you know
[1:03:27] you're able to smoke and it's a whole
[1:03:29] lot less coming through you're not
[1:03:31] getting anything and brother Bram said
[1:03:33] here they've broke this down in the
[1:03:34] World's Fair and and we know this but
[1:03:37] they break it down and yet when they put
[1:03:39] the filter on there it's still why would
[1:03:42] a person smoke because there's a desire
[1:03:46] for
[1:03:47] nicotine right why why don't they take
[1:03:49] this laser pointer and suck on it it
[1:03:52] doesn't have anything I mean they would
[1:03:53] know right you don't you don't you
[1:03:55] wouldn't take the brother B say give
[1:03:56] them a clothes pin they would say what
[1:03:57] that's silly why would I suck on a
[1:03:59] clothes pin because they know the desire
[1:04:02] they have and there's something they
[1:04:05] need in order to satisfy that
[1:04:07] desire and so even with this filter the
[1:04:10] deception and the deceiving part is it's
[1:04:12] still it's still nicotine coming through
[1:04:15] there it's still evil that's coming
[1:04:17] through there it's still all those
[1:04:18] things so so it's not as what it's being
[1:04:22] presented now I want to go in here to
[1:04:25] the next scripture if you keep that
[1:04:26] maybe visually in your mind I want to
[1:04:28] just think here in this in this manner
[1:04:30] God has never put it in the hands of man
[1:04:35] to come up with a
[1:04:37] filter for his soul God has never
[1:04:41] entrusted he's not entrusted you he's
[1:04:43] not entrusted me hey come up with a
[1:04:45] filter try try to make yourself
[1:04:47] acceptable well what you know God has
[1:04:49] never done that you know why because God
[1:04:52] also recognizes that that we even in our
[1:04:55] reasonings we would do everything to the
[1:04:57] best of our reasoning but there would
[1:04:59] still be that which would still pass
[1:05:03] through it would not be sufficient it
[1:05:05] would be one man conferring his judgment
[1:05:09] his thoughts upon another
[1:05:11] man and we're all
[1:05:14] condemned are you with
[1:05:16] me the search was made is there one
[1:05:20] worthy Hallelujah there was no man
[1:05:23] worthy the Bible says in Revelations 5
[1:05:25] they
[1:05:26] searched here stood Moses here stood
[1:05:28] Elijah here stood Jeremiah not one of
[1:05:31] them was
[1:05:32] worthy they were wonderful they were
[1:05:35] prophets of God instruments used in
[1:05:37] their day and their hour but not one of
[1:05:40] them could take the
[1:05:42] book not one of them could do for
[1:05:45] another righteous men holy men but men
[1:05:48] that nonetheless were born in sin shaped
[1:05:51] in
[1:05:52] iniquities but God said I will provide
[1:05:56] for
[1:05:59] myself Hallelujah I will be their
[1:06:03] atonement I will become their
[1:06:06] filter I will become their source of
[1:06:12] Purity that's why reasonings itself will
[1:06:14] never work and it never has worked but
[1:06:17] it's God himself that provides the
[1:06:20] standard and filter for man to be able
[1:06:23] to stand in his his
[1:06:25] presence and I don't know about you but
[1:06:27] I want to stand in his
[1:06:30] presence that's my that's my whole goal
[1:06:33] is to enter the Kingdom of Heaven to
[1:06:35] enter the kingdom of God that's my whole
[1:06:37] goal is to stand there on that
[1:06:40] day the Rapture is what means
[1:06:45] [Applause]
[1:06:47] everything are you hearing me church
[1:06:50] this is what decisions are based on in
[1:06:52] our lives
[1:06:57] amen numbers or Hebrews n look at this
[1:07:00] type that was given Paul picks the type
[1:07:02] and brings it full circle in verse 13 of
[1:07:05] Hebrews 9 if the blood of bulls and
[1:07:07] goats and the ashes of a hepher
[1:07:10] sprinkling the unclean sanctify to the
[1:07:13] purifying of the flesh so when man had
[1:07:16] done wrong when man had sinned God
[1:07:20] provided a
[1:07:21] way through the that of the red hepher
[1:07:25] the ashes thereof to where that the
[1:07:27] ashes with water could be sprinkled upon
[1:07:30] that man now let me just tell you
[1:07:33] something God wasn't going to go and try
[1:07:36] to just Chase everybody down but you see
[1:07:39] you say well brother Samuel isn't it God
[1:07:40] isn't the the goodness and the mercy of
[1:07:42] God following after me let me just tell
[1:07:44] you what it is it's the presence of God
[1:07:47] and if there's something in your heart
[1:07:49] that desires to be right with God it's
[1:07:52] because there is a place where you can
[1:07:54] be right with
[1:07:57] God and it's God he said if I be lifted
[1:08:00] up I will draw all men unto
[1:08:04] me if I be lifted
[1:08:07] up and so the man Desiring to be in
[1:08:10] Fellowship where did man get that
[1:08:12] longing to be in fellowship with God
[1:08:15] that longing came from
[1:08:18] God where is that longing that is within
[1:08:21] you that was in you to long and to
[1:08:23] search for a living God something you
[1:08:25] desired that you couldn't even put your
[1:08:27] finger on it come from God it was God
[1:08:31] drawing upon your life and when God's
[1:08:34] drawing let me say this to you when
[1:08:36] God's drawing upon your life God has the
[1:08:39] remedy he himself is the remedy for
[1:08:41] every sin for every habit for everything
[1:08:44] that is wrong he is the
[1:08:48] answer let me tell you you can visit a
[1:08:50] million and one doctors I believe
[1:08:52] doctors are God's agents but let me just
[1:08:54] tell you something friends we need
[1:08:56] something more when it gets down into
[1:08:58] the spirit realm where there's been
[1:09:00] wounds there's been things that's been
[1:09:02] placed there where there's a need of
[1:09:04] healing there's only one that can bring
[1:09:06] sufficient healing there in your life
[1:09:09] I'm talking about the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:12] he's all that you have need
[1:09:15] of so to s that point up is everything
[1:09:19] when he's drawing up on your life is
[1:09:21] because he already has the answer
[1:09:24] he is the
[1:09:25] answer it's coming and that the ashes
[1:09:29] themselves that that mixed with water
[1:09:31] might be sprinkled upon your life you
[1:09:34] say what is that that's the word and the
[1:09:35] spirit coming together right it's not
[1:09:38] just a it's the water amen the water is
[1:09:40] the spirit the ashes of the word is the
[1:09:43] water and the spirit coming together
[1:09:45] that deals with our life that brings
[1:09:47] conviction in our life I say thank God
[1:09:50] for
[1:09:52] that praise God
[1:09:54] I don't know about you but do you would
[1:09:56] you rather go to a church come to a
[1:09:58] church where everything is padded on the
[1:10:00] back and my everything's real good that
[1:10:02] that might suffice okay down here but if
[1:10:04] there's something within you that really
[1:10:06] is longing for God you will not be
[1:10:11] satisfied because there's a thirst
[1:10:13] there's a hunger for the Living
[1:10:19] God this type could cling to the purif
[1:10:23] of the flesh but it never dealt with a
[1:10:26] desire in
[1:10:27] man it never dealt with what made him do
[1:10:30] it in the first place and never brought
[1:10:33] him into the true relationship and
[1:10:34] fellowship that God intended but notice
[1:10:37] in verse 14 but how much more shall the
[1:10:41] blood of Christ who through the eternal
[1:10:43] spirit offered
[1:10:46] himself without spot to
[1:10:49] God Purge your conscience that's your
[1:10:52] soul from dead Works to serve the Living
[1:10:59] God
[1:11:00] hallelujah called to serve the Living
[1:11:03] God to purge it means to cleanse listen
[1:11:06] not just free from from from from what
[1:11:11] has been done but it's also to take care
[1:11:13] of not just the guilt but the
[1:11:17] problem sir that's what this purging
[1:11:19] does it don't just put away it's not
[1:11:22] just a putting away of the remission of
[1:11:24] sins but it deals with what is it that
[1:11:27] caused it in the first
[1:11:30] place listen friends that's why the
[1:11:32] gospel comes to direct us to look deep
[1:11:35] into our life that's why I believe that
[1:11:38] you know you would not be satisfied I
[1:11:41] remember in my life I was not satisfied
[1:11:44] with just the repetitive repentance of
[1:11:46] the same things over and over and over
[1:11:50] and over it's something because you're
[1:11:52] looking and say I continue you to fall
[1:11:54] to the same
[1:11:56] things I need a
[1:11:58] strength I need something we know what's
[1:12:01] right but I need the life of the
[1:12:04] sacrifice not just to forgive me but I
[1:12:07] need full pardoning Redeeming
[1:12:14] Grace I think you understand friends
[1:12:17] without me having to break things
[1:12:19] down in that
[1:12:21] manner there are things that we have to
[1:12:24] repent of that has nothing to do with a
[1:12:27] new
[1:12:29] birth there's times we have to repent to
[1:12:32] one another there's times we we we're
[1:12:36] constantly Before the Throne of
[1:12:40] God are you hearing me but I'm not
[1:12:43] talking about practicing
[1:12:46] sin is that
[1:12:51] understood now I want you to think of
[1:12:53] this this
[1:12:55] purging God himself provided the
[1:12:59] filter there in the
[1:13:02] beginning and we understand that even in
[1:13:04] the
[1:13:05] hour here where Christ himself stepped
[1:13:10] forward and he provided himself The
[1:13:14] Living
[1:13:15] Word let me say this Peter walked with
[1:13:18] the living
[1:13:20] word he walked with the Living Word but
[1:13:23] Peter he Peter was not able nor the rest
[1:13:26] of the disciples to pass their life
[1:13:29] fully through the filter until that word
[1:13:31] had been offered
[1:13:33] up once the word had been offered up
[1:13:36] once Calvary came once the blood had
[1:13:39] been shed now came forth once Calvary
[1:13:42] came forth what is it it's the burning
[1:13:44] of the red heer now from Calvary comes
[1:13:47] the memorial of that sacrifice and the
[1:13:50] spirit of God the spirit that was Within
[1:13:53] in that blood cell comes to seek out the
[1:13:55] worshippers and call to you and I and
[1:13:58] draw us and woo us back
[1:14:01] together but Peter and them could not
[1:14:03] pass their lives through until the
[1:14:05] sacrifice was offered
[1:14:07] up but when that sacrifice was offered
[1:14:10] up when they stood there that day on the
[1:14:12] day of Pentecost they were not just
[1:14:14] speaking good words these words were
[1:14:19] anointed and quickened by the spirit of
[1:14:21] God inside of them that had quick their
[1:14:23] lives to the
[1:14:25] word the old had passed away and behold
[1:14:28] all things had become
[1:14:30] new the filter was the filter himself
[1:14:34] was on
[1:14:35] display are you understanding me they
[1:14:38] had they had this of the law and of the
[1:14:40] prophets but it could not clean a man's
[1:14:43] Soul that's why I said very clearly the
[1:14:45] title of this message is not is not just
[1:14:47] to say the word is our filter but the
[1:14:50] word himself because the word is a
[1:14:52] person
[1:14:54] yes it's a person of Jesus Christ that
[1:14:57] reveals himself and the meaning that it
[1:14:59] has to you and I we're not just looking
[1:15:01] at him as another oh this is another
[1:15:03] move my this is good but we look from
[1:15:06] within our hearts this is my
[1:15:09] soulmate this is my
[1:15:12] husband how do you know it's love at
[1:15:14] first
[1:15:16] sight I may not be there yet but there's
[1:15:18] something it's become Nothing Else
[1:15:21] Matters right now this word is an
[1:15:23] absolute to my
[1:15:26] life everything else every other Pearl I
[1:15:29] get rid of every other Peril I have
[1:15:31] found the pearl of great price I have
[1:15:34] found that which will change my
[1:15:39] life that's how much it means to
[1:15:43] us I forsake everything
[1:15:46] else eyes for none
[1:15:52] other
[1:15:54] but down Through the
[1:15:55] Ages man be to tamper with this filter
[1:15:59] when it entered into listen when it
[1:16:00] entered into the first age in the
[1:16:02] Ephesian age man had already started to
[1:16:05] tamper with the filter not
[1:16:09] God the spirit of God begin to call out
[1:16:12] but man begin to Tamper because he
[1:16:13] wanted certain people in the
[1:16:16] church you know if they preached in a
[1:16:18] certain way you know your Aristocrats
[1:16:20] and your government and your kings and
[1:16:22] monarchs well they wouldn't want to be
[1:16:23] around it it's just like the enemy would
[1:16:26] like to tell you well if you do this or
[1:16:27] you live this certain way you'll not
[1:16:29] have any friends let me tell you
[1:16:30] something there are no friends in
[1:16:31] hell I'm being very straight there's no
[1:16:34] friends in Hell there's no buddies in
[1:16:36] Hell there's no Clicks in
[1:16:38] [Applause]
[1:16:40] hell it's
[1:16:42] [Music]
[1:16:44] serious it's why it speaks to what is
[1:16:46] the value of your life right now there's
[1:16:49] only one who can stand for you and I let
[1:16:51] me just say this to you on that day
[1:16:54] it'll not be brother Samuel standing for
[1:16:56] you it'll not be brother Samuel saying
[1:16:58] well the Lord they came you know they
[1:17:00] came pretty regular and they might have
[1:17:02] been a good tipay I don't know that but
[1:17:04] I you know whatever it might be it's not
[1:17:06] going to be brother
[1:17:08] Samuel the stand has got to be made
[1:17:12] right
[1:17:13] now that who is standing for you are you
[1:17:16] standing for him have you accepted him
[1:17:20] received his advancement of Grace to
[1:17:22] your life
[1:17:25] see God wants to dismiss all fear down
[1:17:27] here that's what perfect love
[1:17:30] does and let me just say this too hell
[1:17:33] is paved with good
[1:17:36] intentions hell is full of good old
[1:17:41] boys Brother Sam you shouldn't say it
[1:17:43] that's straight oh I
[1:17:45] should I should but I don't say it with
[1:17:47] meanness I say it because the grace of
[1:17:48] God that you would understand you could
[1:17:50] work yourself to death but you cannot
[1:17:53] work yourself into the kingdom of God
[1:17:56] God provided a purification for
[1:17:58] sin God's provided a liberty for
[1:18:03] it you see what God came to deal is with
[1:18:06] the inside part now notice I want I have
[1:18:09] to lay this in this background here that
[1:18:11] man begin to sew it up they begin to
[1:18:14] tamper with this filter you find there
[1:18:17] in the Ephesian age you find it in the
[1:18:19] pergan age s remember every age
[1:18:23] and then it gets to a place where God
[1:18:26] has made a promise I will
[1:18:29] restore who's going to do this I will
[1:18:32] restore saith the Lord God begins to
[1:18:35] raise up
[1:18:37] justification what does it do it's
[1:18:40] filtering out the
[1:18:42] Believers but it's not the complete
[1:18:44] filter then sanctification comes a
[1:18:48] little bit deeper right but it's not the
[1:18:51] complete filter then you have the
[1:18:53] restoration of the gifts in Pentecost
[1:18:55] toza street but it's not the complete
[1:19:00] filter there's an advancement of the
[1:19:02] light but in the evening
[1:19:05] time there shall be
[1:19:08] light in the evening time this is where
[1:19:11] the scripture could say let us be glad
[1:19:14] and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb
[1:19:16] is come and his bride the Lamb's wife
[1:19:20] hath made herself ready this is why the
[1:19:23] scripture would say in Revelations 10:8
[1:19:26] that the mystery when the seventh angel
[1:19:28] would begin to sound that the mystery of
[1:19:31] God should be finished what is the
[1:19:34] mystery of God it's the Holy Ghost In
[1:19:36] You
[1:19:38] amen that's the mystery of God it's
[1:19:41] Christ in you baptizing you into the
[1:19:44] body of Jesus
[1:19:47] Christ hallelujah hallelujah making up
[1:19:50] that of the bride all the way like
[1:19:52] Luther the feet and the
[1:19:54] legs then you have Wesley here the heart
[1:19:57] the chest the Torso then it comes into
[1:20:00] the zuza street the mouth are speaking
[1:20:02] the supernatural comes back among the
[1:20:04] church but then God promised he would
[1:20:06] send
[1:20:08] eyesu and after the eyes have come in
[1:20:10] and enters the intelligence into the
[1:20:14] church the mind of almighty God so what
[1:20:17] is it it's a complete body that is
[1:20:19] standing upon the Earth brought back by
[1:20:23] God himself
[1:20:25] amen the true filter of the word of God
[1:20:29] this is why brother brandham would make
[1:20:31] this
[1:20:32] statement he would refer to the people
[1:20:35] he said I've just finished preaching on
[1:20:37] the Seven
[1:20:38] Seals and brother Bram takes it in there
[1:20:40] with that sick seal because you're
[1:20:42] realizing and aware that that six seal
[1:20:44] is a tribulation seal
[1:20:48] right I I don't want to go into that and
[1:20:51] to preach that that's that's a
[1:20:52] tribulation seal I don't plan on being
[1:20:55] here but I see great parallels in it and
[1:20:58] how God affects and influences our life
[1:21:00] now but under that sick seal it's a
[1:21:03] purging seal it's a purging there'll be
[1:21:07] lives during that time that'll make
[1:21:09] their decision whether to continue with
[1:21:12] denominational systems or
[1:21:15] not there'll be decisions that's made
[1:21:17] that are very important but the bride
[1:21:19] will be
[1:21:20] gone let me just say it like this every
[1:21:22] everything as the prophet said is to be
[1:21:24] purged under that seventh seal and that
[1:21:27] seventh seal it is Christ himself that
[1:21:30] has come among the church I I don't
[1:21:32] believe this terminology loses you or
[1:21:35] bothers you but just to bring it down in
[1:21:36] Simplicity that even when you hear
[1:21:38] Brother brand preaching the seven seal
[1:21:40] message and people are looking and
[1:21:42] saying where's the point where's the
[1:21:43] place where is it what he said he's
[1:21:45] laying it out the whole time it's been
[1:21:48] Christ all
[1:21:50] along that's why in that message that's
[1:21:53] why he's rehearsing the Miracles
[1:21:55] everything that's been done the word
[1:21:57] restoring that's why and people saying
[1:21:59] okay what is it and what is it he's
[1:22:01] declaring what is that I walk on the
[1:22:03] road of
[1:22:05] emus it's been Christ here the whole
[1:22:08] time walking with
[1:22:10] us and it's a time of
[1:22:13] unveiling why because the marriage of
[1:22:16] the Lamb has come and there's a bride on
[1:22:19] the
[1:22:21] scene and takes that call of those seven
[1:22:25] unknown mysterious
[1:22:28] Thunders to awaken
[1:22:31] her so that seven seal is Christ
[1:22:35] [Applause]
[1:22:38] himself Hallelujah the grace that has
[1:22:42] come down Through the Ages now
[1:22:43] presenting himself that I am your
[1:22:46] husband I am your
[1:22:51] lord I've come to satisfy all
[1:22:54] requirements of the
[1:22:56] Kinsman I paid the price for
[1:23:00] Redemption I made a way and now I've
[1:23:03] come to clear every lean against the
[1:23:05] Church of the Living God that the church
[1:23:08] might go in
[1:23:09] [Applause]
[1:23:10] Rapture this is why there had to come a
[1:23:15] purging in the church than Lord and
[1:23:19] that's why the seven seal had to come
[1:23:21] that's why the this message had to come
[1:23:25] that's why this message is not another
[1:23:28] idea of
[1:23:31] man it's not man ruling over man if you
[1:23:35] do this and do this and do this you'll
[1:23:37] be accepted it's the word of God what's
[1:23:40] been lifted up is the word of
[1:23:42] God I want to get to a few things here
[1:23:45] but I want to read this quote my I love
[1:23:48] this out of the seven seal brother brah
[1:23:51] says I thank him for Jesus Christ Christ
[1:23:53] for without sending him for the pritu of
[1:23:56] our sins we'd all be in a muck of sin
[1:23:58] with no hope but by his grace his blood
[1:24:02] cleanses all sin just like the drop of
[1:24:05] ink in a bucket of Clorox you'd never
[1:24:08] find the ink again when our sins are
[1:24:11] confessed it's put in the blood of Jesus
[1:24:13] Christ they'll never be known again God
[1:24:17] forgets them they never ever was done
[1:24:20] and as long as that sacrif I is laying
[1:24:23] therein an atonement for us then that's
[1:24:25] all that's it see we're not Sinners no
[1:24:28] more we're Christians by the grace of
[1:24:32] God remember in our own selves we'd
[1:24:35] probably be just as bad as we ever was
[1:24:38] in our own selves but see the grace of
[1:24:41] God has appeared to us and that's what's
[1:24:44] made us what we are today Christian
[1:24:48] brothers and
[1:24:50] sisters Hallelujah
[1:24:58] I want to say it like
[1:25:00] this brand if you put that other that
[1:25:02] third slide up there and I'm just going
[1:25:04] to refer to a few
[1:25:07] scriptures the Bible says
[1:25:10] that as she puts that up there the word
[1:25:12] is our
[1:25:14] filter in John
[1:25:17] 522 the father judgeth no man but ha
[1:25:20] committed all judgment unto the son
[1:25:23] you see to reject the word himself made
[1:25:27] flesh is to reject
[1:25:31] life that's why friends when people walk
[1:25:34] away from this revealed
[1:25:37] truth everything begins before the
[1:25:40] physical starts it's a falling and
[1:25:43] there's no place to
[1:25:48] stop Brother Sam you're just saying I'm
[1:25:50] not just saying that I could give you
[1:25:51] stories of
[1:25:54] individuals that once had big
[1:25:57] churches but because of the compromise
[1:25:59] on this word now their own family don't
[1:26:02] even go with
[1:26:04] them their own family has went away into
[1:26:07] a Presbyterian
[1:26:09] Church I'm not saying that to put
[1:26:11] anybody down I'm saying friends that
[1:26:14] this word in itself to reject the word
[1:26:17] made flesh is to reject the Living
[1:26:21] God
[1:26:22] the Pharisees the Israel they reverenced
[1:26:27] the law and the prophets but they
[1:26:30] couldn't
[1:26:31] recognize God made
[1:26:35] flesh and they called him
[1:26:40] be so what the point that I'm making
[1:26:43] here is that the word itself remember
[1:26:47] our thought the word himself is our
[1:26:51] filter which the person of Jesus Christ
[1:26:54] is the holy ghost in the form of the
[1:26:57] word he's the provided filter the
[1:26:59] purification of sin for the believer and
[1:27:02] as the entirety of the red hepher was to
[1:27:05] be burnt it speaks of the entirety of
[1:27:08] the word of God coming forth in order to
[1:27:11] bring complete
[1:27:18] cleansing it's a word bride that's going
[1:27:20] in a rapture
[1:27:23] it's not going to be a a bride that oh
[1:27:25] she's got a broken ankle just just one
[1:27:27] little word that you know just wasn't
[1:27:29] able to know it's got to be word on top
[1:27:31] of word line on top of line precept on
[1:27:34] top of precept here little there little
[1:27:37] is that right that's and this is the
[1:27:39] refreshing the rest it's got to be a
[1:27:42] word
[1:27:43] bride this is why Jesus could say man
[1:27:46] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:27:48] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:27:50] mouth of God
[1:27:53] this is why even when we look at the
[1:27:55] Bible in in Revelations 19 it speaks
[1:27:57] where the marriage of the Lamb has come
[1:27:59] and is and the description and how it
[1:28:01] said For unto her is granted to be
[1:28:03] clothed with the fine R fine Vine linen
[1:28:06] which is the righteousness of the Saints
[1:28:08] and it said blessed are they that are
[1:28:10] called to the married supper of the land
[1:28:12] for these are the faithful and true
[1:28:14] sayings of
[1:28:15] God what are you saying brother Samuel
[1:28:17] I'm saying God in this hour took what
[1:28:20] men had cut out and what man said was
[1:28:22] not
[1:28:24] important and God said man shall not
[1:28:26] live by bread alone but by every word of
[1:28:30] God God himself and that's why I say the
[1:28:33] filter of the word we look at this in
[1:28:35] the filter of the word listen friends
[1:28:38] how many denominational standards are
[1:28:41] there
[1:28:43] thousands I think the last the last
[1:28:45] count you could you would have to spend
[1:28:47] almost how
[1:28:50] many it's 3,000 I thought it was 33 at
[1:28:53] one point 33 you could spend days of
[1:28:56] your
[1:28:57] life trying to find what's
[1:29:01] right and no doubt some of you God
[1:29:04] touched your life and maybe you passed
[1:29:06] through one of them but you couldn't
[1:29:07] stay
[1:29:10] there I want you to understand this
[1:29:13] friends I'm not against the people
[1:29:15] listen now brother Bram said I'm not
[1:29:17] against the people I'm against the
[1:29:18] filter the
[1:29:20] system I'm not against the people it's
[1:29:23] the system because the system is
[1:29:29] deception telling the people they're
[1:29:31] okay they're all
[1:29:33] right and when the word of God is
[1:29:36] opened well you know our our our our our
[1:29:39] group of men have have learned that it
[1:29:41] really you know it doesn't matter women
[1:29:43] can have short
[1:29:45] hair that ain't what the Bible
[1:29:47] says well it don't matter you know man
[1:29:50] can look like a that ain't what
[1:29:51] what the Bible
[1:29:53] says but you see look how the enemy
[1:29:56] wants to even take those things and say
[1:29:58] well that's insignificant let me just
[1:30:00] tell you something clothing speaks yes
[1:30:03] when Tamar herself listen to me now I
[1:30:06] could spend a month of Sundays on this
[1:30:08] tamarrow herself when she wanted to get
[1:30:11] the attention of Judah the Bible said
[1:30:14] she put on garments of
[1:30:18] harlotry the clothing sent a signal
[1:30:23] amen when God came down in the garden it
[1:30:27] didn't just well they F fig leaves figs
[1:30:30] are the only plant where there's
[1:30:32] multiple seeds at
[1:30:36] once clothing is a
[1:30:39] sign it's either a sign of
[1:30:42] rebellion or it's a sign of
[1:30:46] obedience brother Samuel don't the heart
[1:30:48] have to I agree the heart has to be
[1:30:50] right I agree and when the Heart Is
[1:30:51] Right everything else will get lined up
[1:30:53] because the control center is in the
[1:30:55] right
[1:30:58] place everywhere in the scripture with
[1:31:02] makeup everywhere in the
[1:31:07] scripture Jezebel did it not to appear
[1:31:09] before
[1:31:12] God I'm saying this for all that's here
[1:31:14] as it's pressed on my heart for even our
[1:31:17] young
[1:31:20] people every time even with makeup and
[1:31:24] hair through the scriptures when God
[1:31:26] wanted to speak concerning Israel in
[1:31:28] Jeremiah in Ezekiel in Isaiah and he
[1:31:31] would call out their Rebellion he said
[1:31:33] cut off your
[1:31:35] hair because it spoke of
[1:31:39] rebellion are you hearing me friends
[1:31:42] yeah I'm not saying these things to
[1:31:43] being indiff this is the word of God and
[1:31:46] if we look at something and say well
[1:31:47] that's just a menial thing it's
[1:31:49] noten it's every word of
[1:31:52] God and if you want God to do something
[1:31:55] in your life brother BR said if you
[1:31:56] won't even let your hair grow if you
[1:31:58] won't even take off the makeup and quit
[1:32:01] wearing the pants how can you expect God
[1:32:03] to give you the Holy
[1:32:06] Ghost you got to me business with God
[1:32:08] the Lamb's wife ha made herself
[1:32:13] ready listen that's not the only words
[1:32:16] in the Bible let me just tell you also
[1:32:18] what the prophet said at the end of a
[1:32:20] thinking man's filter
[1:32:24] he comes to the very latter part of that
[1:32:25] and he said and you men he said because
[1:32:27] I've seen some wearing dresses he said
[1:32:30] where it exposes they're
[1:32:32] underneath who we're getting tight
[1:32:35] now he said right among the Pentecostals
[1:32:38] and everything else he said that's just
[1:32:41] as
[1:32:45] bad my
[1:32:47] goodness hey I I'm a thinking man are
[1:32:52] you thinking man thinking
[1:32:55] woman I'm friends listen I'm not saying
[1:32:57] these things would be hard God knows my
[1:32:59] heart but I'm saying it in a manner that
[1:33:02] hey has called to be the Bride of Jesus
[1:33:04] Christ every word matters but you
[1:33:06] realize listen I've got family right in
[1:33:10] denominational systems that over time
[1:33:13] they never would have put on anything
[1:33:15] but a dress but they're counsel these
[1:33:17] are not just things I read in the
[1:33:20] message but you hear them where they're
[1:33:23] allowed to do certain things they cut
[1:33:25] certain things out and they still
[1:33:27] condone
[1:33:29] worldliness condone The Cutting of hair
[1:33:32] and they lay onto the speaking of
[1:33:33] tongues as the evidence and on and on
[1:33:35] say brother Samuel what is that that's
[1:33:37] called a church
[1:33:38] filter see everyone can claim well the
[1:33:42] word is my filter but is
[1:33:44] it is it right or is it a filter that's
[1:33:49] got a it allows a certain little bit of
[1:33:52] the world to come
[1:33:54] through you wonder why people choose
[1:33:57] certain things they
[1:33:58] choose you know why same way we talked
[1:34:01] about you have a coffee filter for
[1:34:03] coffee furnace an AC filter for furnace
[1:34:07] you wanting to keep certain things out
[1:34:09] and let certain things
[1:34:11] in and the filter where they'll take
[1:34:15] this right here how many are holding
[1:34:16] this
[1:34:17] today but yet with the ideas of man and
[1:34:21] man
[1:34:22] interpretation it's a man-made
[1:34:25] filter not
[1:34:27] producing a bride for Jesus
[1:34:30] Christ but that's where the grace of God
[1:34:33] has come across our pathway and what an
[1:34:36] accountability we
[1:34:37] have are you hearing me because the
[1:34:41] Bible said whosoever adds to the word or
[1:34:43] takes from it their part is taken out of
[1:34:46] the book of
[1:34:47] life now listen there's some things it
[1:34:49] you don't you don't need a prophet
[1:34:51] before it's wrote right here in the
[1:34:52] scriptures is that right it's wrote
[1:34:56] there but it goes to show that that's
[1:34:58] the difference of where a church filter
[1:35:01] because you see a church filter well you
[1:35:04] know it it comes down to where they want
[1:35:07] to take so much of the world but they
[1:35:10] want to satisfy a desire that's still in
[1:35:11] there because let me tell you something
[1:35:13] everything within
[1:35:14] man man wants to
[1:35:18] worship I don't care if he's an atheist
[1:35:20] he wants to worship
[1:35:21] the Infidel he'll worship his family
[1:35:24] worship his car worship His Wife she'll
[1:35:26] worship her husband she'll
[1:35:28] everything because man is meant to
[1:35:31] worship religious in order to satisfy a
[1:35:35] religious part but to think of it even
[1:35:38] when the Pharisees look look even as we
[1:35:40] said that when the Pharisees themselves
[1:35:42] when they came here they with the
[1:35:44] tradition that was around and they were
[1:35:46] trying to approach the Lord Jesus but
[1:35:48] everything was so bound up with
[1:35:50] Traditions they have made made the word
[1:35:51] of God of none
[1:35:54] effect the word could not become
[1:36:00] effective let me tell you friends the
[1:36:02] greatest thing that we can do is not
[1:36:05] just not just to reason with the word
[1:36:07] but give ourselves to
[1:36:11] it I want you to think of this here just
[1:36:14] a moment that Soul
[1:36:16] itself is the most important important
[1:36:19] part of our life Bria go to the last
[1:36:24] slide I I I took this from a there was a
[1:36:28] I have a drawing of this but I went over
[1:36:30] this other one here and I want to just
[1:36:32] take this it's a little hard to read in
[1:36:33] here but this is a this is man as a
[1:36:36] Triune being this is how we're made up
[1:36:39] body these are your five natural senses
[1:36:42] Spirit here's your five spiritual senses
[1:36:44] memory conscience affection imagination
[1:36:46] and reasoning but down in that Soul it's
[1:36:49] Faith or doubt right
[1:36:53] that what God is after is this
[1:36:57] soul to be the control tower all through
[1:37:00] the scripture the soul that sinth it
[1:37:02] shall die Jesus said what will man give
[1:37:04] in exchange for his soul right soul is
[1:37:08] the most important David said my soul
[1:37:11] thirsteth for a living God because this
[1:37:13] is the control tower in
[1:37:15] man this is the place of God's rest
[1:37:20] amen
[1:37:21] when God said let him make me a
[1:37:23] tabernacle there were three courts to
[1:37:25] the Tabernacle right you had the
[1:37:28] Tabernacle of the congregation you had
[1:37:30] the holy place and you had the holiest
[1:37:32] of
[1:37:33] holies God's desire to dwell in the
[1:37:37] midst of man but there must be a
[1:37:40] purification for sin there must be that
[1:37:43] which could deal with that of the sin
[1:37:45] question because remember the Holy
[1:37:47] Spirit everybody with me because
[1:37:50] remember the spirit of God God this is
[1:37:51] where brother Bram could say how a
[1:37:53] person he said here they can come into a
[1:37:55] church and through a church filter a
[1:37:57] church filter says well you felt his
[1:37:59] presence and my you know you ran or you
[1:38:01] dance nothing wrong with running or
[1:38:03] dancing but well you spoke in tongues or
[1:38:05] any of that but listen if it never gets
[1:38:07] down here it's only out here true it's
[1:38:12] only on the spirit and what happens
[1:38:13] there's never a
[1:38:16] change this is why that even gifts a
[1:38:19] person can be so gifted and yet down
[1:38:21] here on the inside it'd be
[1:38:23] dark that's why when the Bible says on
[1:38:26] that day many will come to me and say
[1:38:29] Lord Lord have we not prophesied
[1:38:31] preached in thy name cast out devils and
[1:38:35] he will say depart from me you workers
[1:38:38] of
[1:38:40] iniquity promoting a false
[1:38:43] filter I never even knew you why they
[1:38:47] never had a relationship they were
[1:38:50] anointed but never had a relationship
[1:38:53] with
[1:38:54] God that's why the message of the hour I
[1:38:58] just feel so moved in my heart when I
[1:39:00] thought of with thinking of this and
[1:39:02] meditating on it God for our young
[1:39:04] people for others here we hear of the
[1:39:06] message of the hour you've heard as it's
[1:39:08] been poured over but let me tell you how
[1:39:10] privileged you are to have set before
[1:39:12] you a thinking man's
[1:39:14] filter where God himself has provided
[1:39:17] and kept for you in this generation a
[1:39:20] wicked generation and you hear that
[1:39:22] thought the message of the hour I'll
[1:39:24] tell you what it is it's Christ himself
[1:39:27] being revealed to you as your sin
[1:39:30] offering as your sin barrier as your
[1:39:36] Redeemer it's not just a good
[1:39:40] teaching it's not just good
[1:39:45] Doctrine that's why friends listen
[1:39:47] that's why there's even though I'm not
[1:39:49] throwing off but that's why I'm saying
[1:39:50] it's got to go go deeper than just good
[1:39:52] Doctrine and acknowledging that the
[1:39:53] doctrine is true there's men many that
[1:39:56] have acknowledged the doctrine is true
[1:39:58] now at war against
[1:40:00] it why cuz you got to know him more than
[1:40:03] just in your
[1:40:05] reasoning you can reason now well that's
[1:40:08] true well that makes sense and that's
[1:40:09] logical and that's logical you don't
[1:40:10] know God by Logic you know God by
[1:40:19] Revelation this was why when we look at
[1:40:21] this the Bible says remember a thinking
[1:40:24] man the Bible said a prudent man lookth
[1:40:27] well
[1:40:29] off he sees where he's going not just
[1:40:32] looking here and now for the pleasure
[1:40:34] that's here now you know because like
[1:40:36] brother Bram said that the church will
[1:40:37] allow you to be a member here you're in
[1:40:39] good standing and this and that but a
[1:40:41] prudent man is looking far off what he
[1:40:43] sees and he hides himself he makes
[1:40:46] preparation for what's coming on let me
[1:40:49] tell you friends the things that we see
[1:40:50] see going on in the
[1:40:52] world and I want you to catch this the
[1:40:55] people even of the world there's the
[1:40:57] nervousness people don't realize what's
[1:40:59] taking place even we see this with
[1:41:01] Israel but you know what time after time
[1:41:04] and time again people have become
[1:41:09] numb numb I'm not against that I'm
[1:41:12] saying they become numb I'm saying how
[1:41:14] much for you and I we should not be
[1:41:16] people that are
[1:41:17] numb God I don't want to be lwed to
[1:41:20] sleep you say what do you mean by la la
[1:41:22] to sleep I'm talking about I don't want
[1:41:23] to become so wrapped in the cares of
[1:41:26] life that I'm missing God right Among Us
[1:41:31] I don't want to become so wrapped in my
[1:41:33] own life in my own world to where I
[1:41:36] missing what God is doing and he wants
[1:41:39] to do in my
[1:41:46] life you see when you and I came here in
[1:41:48] this
[1:41:49] world we didn't come with a with a
[1:41:52] Fighting Chance in our
[1:41:57] life as I said
[1:42:00] many some of you may have started in
[1:42:02] another
[1:42:04] place maybe you started in a Catholic
[1:42:07] Church spoke to your heart you realize
[1:42:09] that's the only thing you knew I mean
[1:42:10] hey there's been individuals that had
[1:42:12] their start on Jesus of Jesus of
[1:42:15] Nazareth some individuals that got
[1:42:17] touched on watching a little house in
[1:42:18] the prairie and where the Bible was open
[1:42:19] you oh I can't go listen it's it's about
[1:42:21] what was started it's not about where
[1:42:23] they are at
[1:42:24] now I could call out the minister he's a
[1:42:27] faithful Pastor in this message where
[1:42:28] that happened but started in his life so
[1:42:32] it's not it what matters is is that
[1:42:34] there's something that you couldn't be
[1:42:36] satisfied right I want you to understand
[1:42:39] this I'm not going to tear here
[1:42:40] long there's something within your life
[1:42:43] this is a message that's a call to
[1:42:45] Rapture that's right and you couldn't be
[1:42:48] satisfied there is is there going to be
[1:42:51] lives outside of the Bride that's saved
[1:42:54] yes but not in the
[1:42:56] Rapture I I'm I I think God for his
[1:42:59] grace that spills over onto that but my
[1:43:03] focus what I'm called to is to the
[1:43:06] message of the hour I'm not called
[1:43:08] because I'm better than somebody else
[1:43:10] you're not better than somebody else as
[1:43:13] a matter of fact Esau was a much better
[1:43:16] man than
[1:43:18] Jacob look at the scribes in Pharisees
[1:43:21] compared to uh the
[1:43:23] disciples look at David's band of
[1:43:29] Warriors my goodness a bunch of
[1:43:33] outcasts but you see it's God's looking
[1:43:37] deeper let me just tell you what that
[1:43:39] was in your heart the whole time where
[1:43:42] you couldn't be
[1:43:43] satisfied it was a seed of
[1:43:47] God and I tell you that seed of God it
[1:43:50] was search SE in for the right
[1:43:52] filter it wasn't you brother BR says
[1:43:55] it's that seed in you that was
[1:43:58] drawing but Sam what are you doing I'm
[1:44:00] putting it all in the hands of God
[1:44:04] because it's us responding to the
[1:44:06] quickening power it begin to draw
[1:44:09] through the word and as our lives begin
[1:44:12] to draw through the Living Word who is
[1:44:13] the Living Word it's Christ right Among
[1:44:15] Us a living
[1:44:17] God drawing our lives through that it
[1:44:19] can't draw nothing down into our lives
[1:44:21] but the Holy Ghost we begin to draw you
[1:44:24] draw your life through the word right
[1:44:25] here and listen friends it filters out
[1:44:28] everything of the world it filters out
[1:44:30] every habit draw it through there noce
[1:44:33] just drawing through the word of God
[1:44:35] through Christ giving ourself to
[1:44:37] him are you hearing
[1:44:40] me it's that filter this filter that
[1:44:42] God's provided that God said I'm not
[1:44:45] going to let I'm not going to let my
[1:44:46] bride be
[1:44:47] manhandled I'm not going to let her have
[1:44:49] to wonderer and figure her way out but I
[1:44:52] have kept and reserved for my bride this
[1:44:56] token in the end time I have reserved
[1:45:00] for her the true filter of the word God
[1:45:04] has brought it back into complete
[1:45:07] expression to our lives to where when
[1:45:08] you draw
[1:45:10] your soul through this filter The Living
[1:45:14] Word of God you come out with a holy
[1:45:17] man's taste amen you come out with a
[1:45:19] soul that lines up with every word of
[1:45:22] God you see why because you can't draw
[1:45:25] anything through here other than the
[1:45:27] quickening
[1:45:28] power oh it's in there in the blood
[1:45:32] where all the guilty stains are
[1:45:34] lost it's where every it's where every
[1:45:37] habit meets the Conqueror of it it's
[1:45:40] where every sin question is settled amen
[1:45:43] it's where you're able to walk as a son
[1:45:46] and daughter of
[1:45:48] God because there's a filter that's been
[1:45:50] been provided in this
[1:45:53] hour that no matter how dark and how
[1:45:55] Wicked it is but there's a filter where
[1:45:58] you can filter your life through and
[1:46:00] there's not one word not one word that
[1:46:03] your soul can't say Amen
[1:46:06] to if there's one if there's one thing
[1:46:08] in there where you say well I don't know
[1:46:10] brother Samuel that's just you know I'm
[1:46:11] not sure if that's just really don't
[1:46:13] don't take that friends well this isn't
[1:46:14] really that important that's called
[1:46:16] taking away you can take away from the
[1:46:18] word without taking a scripture out of
[1:46:19] the Bible that's right and you can add
[1:46:23] to it without actually writing another
[1:46:27] one we want to take it as God has given
[1:46:31] it and what does it do it produces a son
[1:46:34] and daughter of God one whose heart and
[1:46:38] mind is stayed on God what am I talking
[1:46:41] about I'm talking about the Living Word
[1:46:43] of God I'm talking about the Holy Ghost
[1:46:47] I'm talking about God himself coming
[1:46:48] down into your life to where you and him
[1:46:53] are no longer Twain but you're one but
[1:46:56] Sam you don't know of you don't know of
[1:46:58] all of my past
[1:47:01] listen the filter of the Living Word is
[1:47:04] more than enough to take care of all of
[1:47:07] your
[1:47:08] past and open to you the victory for the
[1:47:13] future he's more than
[1:47:16] enough his blood is sufficient this word
[1:47:20] I'm telling you to receive that word the
[1:47:23] word is more than enough to do the work
[1:47:25] in your life it'll take care of the
[1:47:28] problem there in the soul and'll bring a
[1:47:30] real birth on the inside friends just
[1:47:33] don't settle for anything out
[1:47:35] here don't settle for anything outside
[1:47:39] of fully completely surrendered to the
[1:47:42] word of
[1:47:43] God you love
[1:47:45] him are you thankful for the word
[1:47:47] himself who is our filter Hallelujah
[1:47:50] amen that he provided for you and I what
[1:47:54] we would have need of he provided for
[1:47:55] you young men he provided for you what
[1:47:58] you would need in this
[1:47:59] hour God provided he provided what I
[1:48:02] would need he provided what we would
[1:48:04] need in our homes as husbands and wives
[1:48:07] for our
[1:48:08] children God's provided in this
[1:48:11] hour and I think just as much as we have
[1:48:14] screens on the windows to keep out the
[1:48:16] bugs and other things God's provided a
[1:48:19] token in this hour
[1:48:20] he said apply the token and keep Satan
[1:48:25] at
[1:48:29] Bay there's an oil on the inside of a
[1:48:32] believer of a dove you know a dove never
[1:48:36] has to take a
[1:48:39] bath because it's got an oil on the
[1:48:42] inside and that oil on the inside it
[1:48:45] comes from the inside out and it cleans
[1:48:48] its feathers amen
[1:48:51] it cleans its feathers comes from the
[1:48:53] inside that oil of the holy spirit in
[1:48:55] the life of a
[1:48:57] Believer if you should happen to be get
[1:48:59] entangled if you get cold there's an oil
[1:49:02] on the inside that comes forth to free
[1:49:05] you there's an oil see your heart on the
[1:49:08] inside that's what makes you look to God
[1:49:11] every moment in your life Lord am I
[1:49:13] being pleasing to you that's what brings
[1:49:16] conviction in your life that's what
[1:49:19] causes you and I to examine Our Lives is
[1:49:22] because it's Christ dwelling on the
[1:49:26] throne the church member doesn't care
[1:49:28] about
[1:49:29] that but as the Bride of Jesus Christ I
[1:49:33] care about what my husband
[1:49:35] thinks I I want to do I want to live the
[1:49:38] way he wants me to live it's listen I'm
[1:49:41] not miserable I'm the H one of the
[1:49:42] happiest man
[1:49:44] alive he changed me he put his life
[1:49:49] within me amen it's not something I have
[1:49:51] to do I don't have to live this way I
[1:49:54] remember trying years and years
[1:49:57] ago I remember how miserable that was
[1:49:59] remember a lot of
[1:50:01] fear but he came amen he
[1:50:05] came well I know I sat in a message
[1:50:08] church I was raised you know here it was
[1:50:10] until I was 19 years old I tried but you
[1:50:13] know one day God there's there's there's
[1:50:16] a time and when I say there's a
[1:50:17] predestinated time I don't want you to
[1:50:19] say well I'll just wait till tomorrow
[1:50:21] you may not have till
[1:50:23] tomorrow if you feel God tugging at your
[1:50:25] heart right here this morning it's is
[1:50:27] the time to surrender all it's a time to
[1:50:31] lay it all down well what would so and
[1:50:33] so think who cares what so and so thinks
[1:50:35] if they're a real believer they'll be
[1:50:36] there like David saying thank you God
[1:50:38] for Your Glory thank you for your glory
[1:50:40] moving down in our
[1:50:42] midst
[1:50:44] Hallelujah but to draw our lives through
[1:50:46] that Living
[1:50:47] Word what it does it brings an absolute
[1:50:51] change in our
[1:50:52] life and it's not just something when
[1:50:54] we're just changed and we become wow
[1:50:56] that's a good citizen that's a good
[1:50:58] person no he's my life he's my all he's
[1:51:03] the reason of decisions that we make why
[1:51:06] we do what we do I'm not just what if
[1:51:08] what if I just as a husband and wife my
[1:51:10] wife and I what if I made decisions that
[1:51:12] was just based on me where would my
[1:51:15] house
[1:51:16] be where would it
[1:51:18] be
[1:51:20] are you hearing
[1:51:22] me but you see this is why the decisions
[1:51:25] that we make when when when Christ has
[1:51:27] been our
[1:51:28] choice we no longer want our
[1:51:31] own we've been
[1:51:34] redeemed we've been redeemed I don't I
[1:51:36] don't want nothing you say what do you
[1:51:38] say I don't want to hold nothing I don't
[1:51:40] want nothing held in my
[1:51:42] life there's nothing nothing that's
[1:51:45] worth in this
[1:51:47] world there's no grudge there's no sin
[1:51:51] there's nothing that's worth it that's I
[1:51:54] don't want anything between him and me
[1:51:58] where does that come from because his
[1:51:59] love like you heard last Sunday the
[1:52:01] unconditional Covenant requires
[1:52:03] unconditional love husbands love your
[1:52:05] wives even as Christ so loved the church
[1:52:07] and gave himself for it we are standing
[1:52:10] here with this Living Word filter of
[1:52:13] himself because he provided
[1:52:15] it he provided it he didn't ask me to
[1:52:19] come up with it he didn't say Samuel you
[1:52:21] try to find out what's right you try to
[1:52:23] find out your way but he came by our way
[1:52:26] Hallelujah and he said my sheep they
[1:52:28] know my voice amen hallelujah begin to
[1:52:32] draw through that
[1:52:34] word change comes in our
[1:52:37] life as we're taking in the word and
[1:52:40] drawing our life the only thing that can
[1:52:42] pass through the word of God the Living
[1:52:44] Word is the Holy Ghost and then you know
[1:52:48] what it does it produces a righteous
[1:52:51] man's
[1:52:53] taste where we
[1:52:55] long for him for
[1:53:00] righteousness and I'd say
[1:53:02] listen let's just let go and let God
[1:53:04] have his
[1:53:05] way I'd say throughout this congregation
[1:53:08] I know in my heart is these things that
[1:53:10] God's LED on and I've been very much in
[1:53:12] prayer with it I in prayer in every
[1:53:14] service but I just was very even more
[1:53:16] nervous within this particular service
[1:53:18] said oh God even as I was leaving out of
[1:53:21] here last night I said 'lord you didn't
[1:53:22] lay this on my
[1:53:24] heart just to give me something because
[1:53:28] there was already a a subject to be
[1:53:30] ministered on but God there's a
[1:53:33] purpose and I believe God has a
[1:53:35] purpose I believe God's interested when
[1:53:38] you looking at the message of the hour
[1:53:40] God's interested so that you can see
[1:53:43] this is the word himself your
[1:53:47] filter and look it's filtering every
[1:53:49] everything through when the Bible says
[1:53:51] repent that's the first question have
[1:53:53] you repented have you received have you
[1:53:56] walked into the water baptism have you
[1:53:58] been baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:54:00] Jesus Christ because it's to pull
[1:54:01] through the

[1:55:01] another service we want to evaluate is
[1:55:05] everything in my life lining up with the

[1:55:12] opportunity maybe there's something
[1:55:14] that's laying in your life that you've
[1:55:15] not made right but as the word is coming
[1:55:17] forth with the spirit it brings
[1:55:20] conviction the ashes the water together
[1:55:24] and it leads you leads you to a place of
[1:55:26] what
[1:55:28] reconciliation it leads you to a place

[1:57:03] filter you could have all gifts and not
[1:57:06] have passed through the
[1:57:07] [Music]
[1:57:09] filter is that the scripture 1
[1:57:11] Corinthians
[1:57:12] 13 without the love of God in your soul
[1:57:14] the Holy
[1:57:16] Ghost that's why the scripture said
[1:57:18] whosoever loveth the are the things of
[1:57:20] the world the love of God and even his
[1:57:21] heart but begin to draw through
[1:57:24] this the things of this world Amen begin
[1:57:28] to
[1:57:29] flee my language
[1:57:32] changed lust fled
[1:57:36] away clothing Things music what was it
[1:57:42] because there was a desire on the inside
[1:57:45] that was longing for
[1:57:47] God and I can't say it enough as the
[1:57:50] prophet said it was that seed on the
[1:57:52] inside that was in you already that
[1:57:55] began to
[1:57:57] draw on the
[1:58:00] filter what was it drawing for the
[1:58:02] quickening power that it
[1:58:04] needed where is that seed at right down
[1:58:07] in
[1:58:09] here it's God's bedding
[1:58:12] ground it's God's
[1:58:14] womb and it was
[1:58:18] drawing how how many can say Lord take
[1:58:22] me through your
[1:58:24] filter take me through your filter
[1:58:28] Lord I stand there as brother BR
