testimony with you um you know how with the Christian walk we always go through just pressures and things but there's sometimes when Satan will lay a a special trap for you I mean a carefully laid trap and uh I had one of those at at work this week and and uh as we heard just a few weeks back at trap isn't meant just for to scare you or something it's meant to destroy you and and that's uh what happened to me this week uh at work just real carefully laid plan and usually they just things just happen real quick you don't even realize it and all of a sudden you're trapped and so I just wanted to share with you I I I know what got me through that trap was not myself uh it was it was the prayers of a a a faithful mother and dad who uh always is praying for me so that's right I I just wanted to share that especially with the young people I know that it can be tough a lot of times it just feels like you have pressures coming from every way and you know but it's such a blessing when you have a Godly mother and dad who who's praying for you because it's going to be those prayers who's going to keep control of the situation when you don't have control of the situation and I I can I could raise my hand and say that's that's the TRU I can say that for for for guarant I I know that day what happened and and it wasn't me or anything I did it was it was the prayers of mom and dad who who kept me through that so I just want to give some encouragement to the young people and then also for for all of us I I just believe we we kind of got marching orders on on Thursday night you brother Samuel said you know we we kind of had marching orders and and and I feel that way too just the time Lord you know if if if we're facing each other that means somebody's backs to the enemy you know and and I just feel it's time for you know for us to to go shoulder to shoulder get the enemy in front of us and just go forward I just feel that in my heart just wanted to to share that and we we just don't know what mind battles or what um traps the Satan might have you know laid for that for for anybody so um I just uh wanted to to share that and just say you know if I've ever wronged anybody or said anything wrong I I truly am sorry and I just ask you to please forgive me and uh I wanted to end with a read a quote here um if I can get my phone open uh so it's from uh brother Samuel had had uh said this or last week of God's WAP gift boy this this just really hit me me said the love of God how God unfolded himself and come at Christmas package was laid and straw the first thing he had was to press against his little head with straw and a dirty piece of swatting cloth wrapped around him the last thing he had was a thorn crown and a dirty rag wrapped over his eyes and hit on the head say if you're a prophet tell us who H you then T to a cross love reaching out we just bow our heads dear Lord Jesus we just come before you in prayer this morning Lord just want to just want to thank you for your kindness Lord love reaching out Lord just it really touched me Lord I just I thank you Lord for what you did on Calvary Lord Lord and just you all pray for for all of us Lord is in these times Lord just i' heard said that the crown of thorns that you wore was for our for our mind battles you had the stripes and the bruises but I I heard the Thorns was for our mind battles and those soldiers they may have thought that they were doing that for entertainment Lord but you had a purpose in it that that crown of Thorns had to stay on it couldn't drop off on the way you still had to go to Pilot's judgment Hall you still had to go down the Via delar Roa Lord and then falling and stuff and you couldn't let that Crown of Thorns fall off so you had them hit your head with the Thorns just to drive it deep to make sure it lasted all the way to Calvary cuz you knew we would have mind battles Lord all the way to the end it's the only thing you wore to the cross I just want to say thank you Lord just help us Lord and I just pray Lord that Lord for these requests the other thing that you did afterwards Lord you went down into the lowest parts of hell it says and you dropped all of our sins there you just left them there and as you ascended back from the lowest parts of hell I believe you looked every single demon in the face and gave them the chance to to say something to try to overcome you so you looked cancer in the face you looked diabetes in the face you looked them all in the face Lord and they had their chance individually and collectively and Lord not a single one could overcome you cuz you are Lord the one that heals all of our diseases Lord and not only physical or but but mental Lord you you you looked suicide in the face you looked at oppression and depression Lord lust and different demons Lord that would also come against US during this last day every single one of them there's just a lion I believe that's roaring in this day Lord just saying in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ let my people go just believe it's that time lord and just Lord there's also one other thing you had to wait for a few moments Lord because you had said in your word that there you was not going to lose one and there was still one up on the cross that you made a promised to a thief that was dying up there and you had said today you'll be with me in Paradise you had to wait for him to draw his last breath so he could go into Paradise so that you could then go up to Satan and say give me the keys and grab the keys of death and hell then go to paradise open the doors say let's go home so Lord we just you didn't lose one then and you're not going to lose one now Lord we just pray Lord for our lost loved ones Lord we know they're coming

been other places too and U but we're just thankful to the Lord for his Mercy amen amen I just want to as we get ready to go into prayer I have a couple prayer cloths here that I want to I'm going to pray over and then Minister while I'm ministering and um we just want to take every one of the other every request I know that that has been given I spoke with um brother Bobby and sister Michelle this morning and uh sister Michelle was just speaking of the pain actually at one point in time thought she was going to have to go to the ER last night and um brother Bobby had just been um up the whole time you know brother Bobby he deals with that that blockage and it comes quite frequently in his in his body and so he was up the whole night and um in a lot of pain and you know sometimes this is I just being just speaking from my heart that CU I know there's others even sitting here that's in pain and I know that you know sometimes there's things that you get woke up with a pain at night and sometimes that's that's what transpires and I think about about it and I look at it and I say Lord this what I'm feeling of discomfort that I have to wait for such a duration of time for that pain to go away wait for the Tylen all to kick in you know but it's in those moments I begin to think about others even more deeply and say Lord what I'm going through is a scratch compared to what they deal with Lord would you just just minister to them amen oh my don't you love the Lord amen probably the enemy in those times he thought man I gave him that pain I thought I was going to discourage him but instead you're looking around and say Lord so and so there brothers so and so sisters so and so Lord what I'm dealing with is a scratch and I really mean that I look at and say it's just a scratch of certain things but God is so good so good so good so good amen I'm just I'm happy to be here this morning aren't you amen God bless you for the Drake sister Rebecca Rebecca God bless you Sister Belinda amen I know theyve battled with some sickness sister Amanda I know you had also good to have you back different ones sister Stephanie I recognize at the end of the service you know how bad it is brother Richard even told me on my way up here on Thursday night and they're very gracious with me the deacons know Contin your repetition God is good yes he is just this is just a wonderful moment amen amen let's just go to him in a word of prayer and any need and request that you have on your heart would you just just make it known to the Lord just keep it upon your heart and let's just go to him in a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord we are so mindful right now that as we are gathered together Lord father brothers and sisters of light precious faith and we're coming to approach the throne of grace that Lord that we would find Lord the help that we are so desperately in need of Lord and we ask that God as we come in the all sufficient name of our Lord Jesus Christ father you said ask to ask anything in my name and I will do it Lord we been instructed in that and we believe that Lord we're Witnesses of it Lord and we're just asking Lord right here this morning as I hold these prayer cloths in my hand Lord and we'll minister with them we pray that God that that same quickening power Not only would go Lord when these are applied to the needs Lord that's been requested Lord but I'm asking Lord that you would come minister to every heart that's here because every need is just as important Lord you don't rank needs you Lord you could have listed all the diseases every need but you showed us that there's not one that's greater than the other we sometimes recognize Lord and hear certain things and the severity of it but you summed it up Lord by just simply saying I'm the Lord that Health all thy diseases it just lets us know what your thought is concerning it Lord and even in your word by his stripes we were healed amen Lord you just let us know that whether it's cancer whether it's a toothache that doesn't make any difference to you Lord You're Still God you're still mindful you're still merciful you care just as deeply Lord God you come Lord to Lord to minister Lord to the Lord youngest child to even to the oldest of us Lord all we all we need do is just touch the hym of your garment so would you help us this morning Lord that we can press Beyond this veil of Flesh go beyond Lord any barriers and this morning oh God lord to receive the very things that we have need of in our lives we ask that you just speak to us Lord in the precious name of Jesus Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you amen thank you musicians I want to go in the scriptures here this morning to 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and uh probably some of you seen the pictures sister Anna's at home and uh she had some real good care say Naomi was right there with her and uh so we just thank the Lord for that and we want to continue to keep her in prayer as well as uh continuing to keep uh brother Bill in prayer here Tuesday has a pet scan and then he uh he's going to leave us for a few weeks and go to Tennessee don't forget your passport I don't know if Tennessee is listed on the third world countryes they not but God is good if my brother hears that I'll know about it I'll just I'll just check and see if he's listening no he's in service right now but I want to I want us just to look at these scriptures these are scriptures as I had some of these as it were just um coming together there on Thursday night but I certainly did not know the direction I was going to take here this morning but just sensing that on Thursday night that I wasn't going to get there and we weren't finished but I want to start in with this and I want us I know a lot of times we quote these this scripture here but I want you to notice the context of it as we go through it in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 verse 8 I want you to notice what's being said we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair now I want you to want you to watch this here Paul is speaking to what is around him but he is speaking when it comes to the second part this is my feelings on it I might be troubled on every side but here's my feeling I'm not distressed so it's balancing when things are around us we are perplexed but I'm not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed now let me read this to you may the Lord bless you as you're having your seats let me read these two scriptures out of the Amplified I want to keep you standing there but let me just read these two scriptures out of the Amplified to kind of even fur further setting in the context Paul said we are hedged in or pressed on every side troubled and oppressed in every way but not cramped or crushed we suffer embarrassments and are perplexed and unable to find a way out but not driven to despair we are pursued which persecuted and hard-driven anybody knows Paul Paul was pursued right Paul Paul was on The Hit List Paul had a whole group that was after him as it states in the book of Acts is that right they they were they were going to kill him but God made a way that that the little boy heard what was going on and came back and Paul said well this is what I want you to do you go and you go tell the Centurion right and so they went and they told the Centurion and then they they took Paul out another way but so Paul was definitely one who you could say he was pursued but he follows it but I'm not deserted to stand alone we are struck down to the ground but never struck out and destroyed so this is what I want to present to you before I continue reading was Paul in himself when he would say such statements as we are troubled on every side yet not distressed was Paul being negative when he spoke we're troubled on every side not all not at all sir he was stating present circumstances but those circumstances are not going to Lord over my feelings this is the balance now notice verse 10 let's go on always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always Del delivered unto death for jesus' sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so in other words as Paul said there's no other way for that character and that life to actually be further developed and expressed through our life than by the breaking down of our will and our Humanity so that Christ might become more visible good PR so the sickness is not against you but the sickness is only permitted by God that through it that through those moments as we are drawing our strength from the Lord that more of him will come on come on display in our life that our character will be further molded so then death worketh in us but life in you now I want you to watch this we having the same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I believed and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of many redown to the glory of God for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day that's the secret of Victory Paul was not being negative when he said the outward man is perishing but he balances it with I'm receiving strength in the necessary part and place of my life in order to live Victorious amidst all of these conditions the inward man is what's being renewed day by day that's true so good that that right there we could preach that not just for when we're dealing with things and issues in our life but to know that every day it's a constant renewal just like in your body when we go to sleep and things like that but let's go on here verse 17 for our light Affliction which now listen if there's anybody that would have author's permission to write like this it's this man cuz I I think it's safe to say no one in here has ever experienced and went through what Paul went through the amount the the perplexities and the things that he went which he describes it in another place of what he went through so for him he's not making light of anyone else's Affliction he didn't say for your light Affliction but but he says our light Affliction this man has got to be looking at something else when he would call it a light Affliction now Paul De said I don't have any Affliction I I don't have none at all no it's a light Affliction that's right so he's not being negative when he's identifying the circumstances that are around him which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding an eternal weight of Glory while we look not at I I love this verse of scripture while we look not at the things which are seen now this whole phrasing while we look not at it deals with where our minds are centered while we look not at the things which are seen you can become so occupied with what we see feel and here all those things are real but none of those things should become the predominating factor of what we're looking at see that's where the spies were were defeated God never told them you you know you went over there you said there's Giants in the land you bunch of negative people there was no problem with that of them saying there were giants in the land God's not asked us to be Liars Pretenders or to ignore Hallelujah but God has asked us just to look at his word sometimes we' become so occupied with these things and ignore the right thing that is actually our Liberty and source of Victory so Paul look where he's at while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal how many know that's a battle it's a battle when you have to look beyond what you feel what you see and what you think is that right this is a battle so Paul is writing it from even from that understanding so when we look at this Paul is not saying that we are to ignore the things that we see or the conditions we find ourselves in but we're looking to a source of strength the Unseen knowing that God is always present now look at this in second Corinthians chapter 6 I'm just trying to set some ground here in 2 Corinthians chapter 6 verse 7 by the word of Truth by the power of God by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left by Honor and dishonor by evil report and good report as deceivers and yet true watch this as unknown and yet known yet well known as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed as sorrowful yet always rejoicing oh my goodness should Paul not have said we're sorrowful he's just stating conditions but what's important is what he looks and how he's approaching those conditions so in other words this was not the end of Paul's Instagram Facebook or SnapChat post all things are sorrowful Emoji upside down sad face that's good that way the young people understand what I'm saying there you as sorrowful yet always rejoicing amen because what where is their defeat in the Army of almighty God yes sir well I know this one passed from this I know this one pass they were not defeated the word of God was not defeated he is still the Lord that Health all thine [Applause] diseases it's where you've got where knowing God personally we don't always know the outcome or the will or this is going to happen this way this is going to happen this way do you have a direct word from God that it's going to come out that way you do not unless he has given you one but you do have the word that says by his stripes I am healed the pathway the journey I don't know the next step but I know he's leading me and I'm going to take his word because he'll show me where I need to put step by step by step by step by step of the way and that's how it is with every part of our walk as a Believer as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making me any rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things all right Romans 8 verse 18 for I reckon Paul's Paul's not a southerner but the word reckon means I think this is how I think I for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compar with the glory which shall be revealed in US never forget when my dad was going through he had his open heart surgery and he was laying in the hospital there in in their and that of the um I can't remember what Vincent hospital I think that's what the name of it is I don't slips in my mind is that what the name of it was okay it's what it was well when they performed I never forget when we came up there the one NE one of the other other days and I came in there and they they had come into the room and my dad's blood pressure was way up and just man things were all Haywire well you know the nurses and everybody else trying to get it together but Dad after they left and they're doing some things he said here's what happened he said this is why that was going on like it was he said he said Satan he said he had begin to come and wanted to talk to me and said you know what your problem is this message you're standing for if you'll just pull back from it I'll let up on you wow you think words can't have an effect listen if Satan's Satan's thoughts coming that way can create that take the contrast God's words are thoughts of Peace so needless to say you know the outcome dad dead rebuked him and he fled and then all of that began to come back down what why do I say that as it comes to me right now because to recognize how many that when sufferings have happen happened they'll turn right away in the midst of suffering when that's the time you need to hold on that's right that's the time to say Lord if I don't feel like I've got a grip that I need then Lord get a grip on me the way it needs to be an anchor to where there's an anchor in the midst of this time so notice Paul said for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us once again is Paul being negative no he's identifying there are sufferings that we are suffering but they're not worthy to be compared Romans 8:31 what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us now it's better to have that word who then what because any what you say well a disease is a what no a disease is a spirit it's a who so this very thing no matter what opposition comes if God be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all [Applause] things now think about it when you read the whole scripture the whole chapter as a Bible reader you know what Paul is saying here what shall we say our our thinking our consideration when we consider that we had not one spec to do with our choosing that it's God that chose us before the foundation of the world it's the holy spirit that has sought us out and even the weaknesses that are about our life that we don't even know how to pray yet the spirit helpeth our infirmities my Lord not only are we chosen our destiny is settled but there is a Divine accompaniment through this life that when I don't even know how to pray don't know what to say but the spirit maketh intercession with groanings that cannot be uttered so what are we going to say to these things I'll tell you what we'll say if God be for us who can be against us so I'd like to continue on that thought what shall we say to these things the message why it had to be Shepherds brother Brown says it like this he says you hear so much today about positive thinking you just put your mind on anything and think positive on it well the devil can do that there's only one thing that rules over all that's God's word if you are thinking contrary to the word forget your thinking how many have ever had to do that no that if Paul was here Paul would have his hands up too right sometimes our God will come around in such Grace and we realize wait a minute I'm thinking contrary to the word sister mey helped brother brandom there in some of those times too as well I can't go into all those examples but notice for get your thinking my think on the word finally brotherr Philippians 4:8 finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are on Facebook no that leaves out Facebook honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report amen if there be any virtue right if there be any praise think on these things well I tell you if we had applied that scripture it' eliminate a lot of junk cuz there's a lot of stuff that absolutely does not satisfy that right there right is that right there's things that are true but yet there's also another part that has to go with it is it honest is it just is it pure is it lovely is it of a good report is there any vert if there has to be virtue in it strength from it amen and something that's praiseworthy then think on it well let's let's think on the word for a few minutes amen Hebrews 3 1 wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus I don't believe Paul was just writing words here but I believe it was inspired by the spirit of almighty God the same spirit of God that inspired the writers to write before and the words and how that they would write I believe it was the same spirit of God that would Inspire the writers of the New Testament even in their choice of words and how that they themselves would Express for our walk with God I I don't believe that this is a message just to look over because how can you consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession and just be something that we skim by we can't he is our all in all everything that we have need of is in him even the answers that we have need of for what's facing us tomorrow we are trusting in his leadership and his guidance we see through the scripture that there were some who went out at different times they went away they felt like they didn't need to pray they didn't need to ask God about this thing and they went out there on their own what happened their water source was not available so they had to come right back to the word which if they would have began right in the beginning they wouldn't have been in that kind of a situation so I certainly believe if there's one thing that we would need to do God help us to consider that means to consider or to to attentively fix one's eyes or mind upon amen a profession and this word profession deals with and for sub subjectively or subject meaning one whom we profess to be ours and objectively it's a profession is the same word confession what one professes or confesses now you know what confess means confess means to say the same thing that's to say the same thing Isaiah 53:4 surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded let's just read this together but he was wounded for ours transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed in the message the principles of Divine Healing now I want you to watch how brother BR approaches this here he says the first thing a person does when they get sick maybe around home you have a few remedies and and things to try never forget how that uh brother brother Dalton would tell this testimony not not brother Elmer D but brother uh uh brother brother Jim Dalton how that he would tell the testimony you know at at the Tabernacle you have all the people that are coming through the prayer line at the Tabernacle across the platform and brother Dalton would tell this testimony of how he had his boy and his boy had a cough and you know he wanted his boy to be prayed for and as he came across the prayer line and he comes there brother Brandon pulls him aside he said now brother Ed he said you realize they sell C medicine down at the store oh brother Samuel that bothers my faith why why how can that be bothering Faith he wanted him yes he wanted his boy didn't want the cough to be no more but brother brandom is not saying that he didn't want to pray for him he prayed for him the little boy was made well but he's also helping brother Dalton to see even beyond that that there are certain things that can come along to assist God is the Healer medicine does not heal us is that right because brother B was referring to because all the definite the lot of the you know the heavy sick cases that were there now certainly I believe anybody has a cough here this morning I believe we lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so did brother Brandon believed that as well he was looking at the severity of the needs and how it was all lined up now watch this the first thing a person does when they get sick maybe around home you have a few remedies and things you try so if I don't think there's anybody here but maybe I don't know so if you're one of those people that feel like that somehow or another if you take Motrin or Tylenol or cough medicine that you've got a weakness of Faith I've just read to you a quote from the prophet of God that blows that out of the sky it's not ignoring faith is not ignoring are you hearing me David didn't walk down there and said we're going to ignore this giant how could he have ignored him and slow that's right faith is not ignoring no amen are you hearing me now now the next thing is maybe you call the doctor oh Lord have mercy that's the sensible thing to do if the doctor can't do no good then you've got a right to go to God that's what you should do call on God and God is the author of circumstance he can do when nothing else can do when man comes to the end on their line God can do aren't you glad you can say Amen to that whole quote oh praise be to God I'm glad we don't have to cherry pick quotes aren't [Laughter] you oh my now if I hurt your feelings put your feelings in way and just go on let's get let's get with it and never forget this this you people laying here sick and needy the right mental attitude toward any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass when you believe and take God at his word say it so believe it so and God will bring it to pass the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass if you're a sinner look how simple this is if you're a sinner confess your sins believe that God saved you and then go testifying of it telling people you're saved it'll work righteousness after a while you'll be a Christian Hebrews 3 And1 Jesus Christ a high priest of our confession he is what we confess him to be and any Redemptive blessing that he died for he's sitting at the right hand of the father tonight to make good anything that you accept in him is there anything too hard for the Lord no nothing is too hard for the Lord amen now this word we think about it because this these phrasings of quote as I go through and looking at this of a right mental attitude it's to look at it correctly so we want to look at the word correctly to realize what God is saying to have the right approach even brother B says when you're com to approach the Lord don't even think you're better than somebody else or that God even owes you anything so to have the right mental attitude is to have the right approach so the attitude itself when we look at what that is that deals with a settled way of thinking or feeling about someone something typically one that is reflected in a person's Behavior that's so good so the right mental attitude will then it moves to become exhibited in our Behavior or shown Even in our Behavior this is what the prophet had just said you take God's word for healing you believe you say you're healed believe you're healed act like you're healed he said here you've repent you confessed your sins you believed you're saved then you continue to testify you're saved it will work righteousness not you will work righteousness but your confession of what he is now think of this here the Bible would say in in in third John chap 1:2 beloved I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy Soul Prosper amen the message condemnation by representation brother Brandon praying saying our heavenly father we bring to you this great line of sick people God just thank many of these in here I trust that every one of them are your children born of the spirit washed in the blood filled with the Holy Ghost ready for the coming and Satan can't get to them that way to make them sin he can't get to them to make them doubt your word is wrong they go ahead and follow it just as to the letter but then he tries to come along and afflict their body because he knows that their bodies still sin but their soul is saved see that's why you never try to perfect this that that's not what you want to perfect the inside is what needs to be perfected and that Perfection that even isn't something that you have to do it's to accept what he has already made available he is our Perfection he's the one that brings that Perfection of life from out of us he's the one that gives us the strength to be able to subdue this body now think of it when he tries to come along and afflict their body because he knows that their bodies still sin but their soul is saved their bodies pardon me I forgot to put this on their bodies got to go back to the dust but their soul goes to God so he tries to afflict that part what he can what does he come to try to afflict what he can do you realize that's why even not only will he try to come to your body but even your human Spirit that's those two Realms are two Realms that are not converted but God's not interested in converting them but God sets forth his spirit in his word in that Soul quickens it and raises up a son and daughter of God like the scripture brother Brian read this morning he hath made us Kings and Priests out of the the same reality from our life we rule over sin the flesh the devil and the world and yet out of the same reality we also are priests that Worship the Lord so even when this guy is sad this guy on the inside has Joy when my spirit is weary but I'm not worshiping from my spirit or my flesh they are just simply instruments like this microphone is or like the tambourine or or these other instruments they are only instruments that allow me to express myself through oh I can already see already we need to say God help us not to allow our instruments to control Our Praise oh my oh my so he tries to afflict that part of what he can but I'm so glad that you included salvation for that body too the ear Earnest of our Resurrection the healing of our bodies and Lord on record today millions of souls millions of bodies that's healed so we know that you're God I love that 2 Corinthians 4 13 let's dive into this this scripture we pull from our text here we having the same Spirit of Faith now what's the spirit of Faith it's God's faith it's the spirit of God we having the same Spirit of Faith now what is Faith well faith is a revelation of the will of God is that right so I have I can have the revelation of the will of God which we should have what is the most important is the new birth it's the will of God for you to be born again it's the will of God for you to live for me to live victorious in this life and yet as I'm walking under that Dominion there are circumstances that can can arise attack my body things can come around that I myself do not have a direct word from at that moment but I have a word from God I've already been given by his stripes we are healed if you recall the prophet when he was speaking of that of Mark Mark 11 if you say to this mountain brother BR remember he said that is always a scripture that stumped me and he said I'd come to a spot to where I just had said that must have been prior to the atonement he said but has I begin to meditate it on on the words of that scripture in the woods that day he said the spirit of God begins to move upon my heart and I said well when they you know that that was just something kind of like what the prophets used to do and he said right then there was an anointing that came and that word struck me on what the prophets used to do what did the prophets do they did not speak according to their own thinking they did not we things it wasn't Isaiah saying how let me let me see how wonderful this could be here let me just say uh Behold a virgin shall conceive no as a matter of fact if God would have let Isaiah know a forehand he probably would never have said it but it is a moment of a word of God that drops down sovereignly you don't pray it down I don't pray it down it is sovereignly given by almighty God now I'm not going to preach on that this morning but it sets a little background here on that spirit that same Spirit of Faith you you already have it it's like many times where individuals will say well I wish I had Faith well listen you do have faith even without the spirit of God in a person's life you still begin with mental faith is that right still taking the word in that's what the prophet was talking about with taking that word and confessing it and then watch he said it will work righteousness it moves from just something that's mental to a real Supernatural Faith but yet in our lives of how that we walk in this present life to understand that we have faith remember the the uh the the little sister the stad cliff sister when she was troubled I've quoted this probably a hundred times from this pull pit but that little sister was so troubled when her baby when God said don't touch it to the prophet it's the hand of the Lord now you know when when she she was troubled like maybe you or I would be troubled with something and even the question that we could even think about in our life was this baby taken because I didn't have enough faith and brother bam turns around he says oh no sister St cff you have great faith I'm glad it was said like that he just didn't say you had Faith but you had great faith because when God decided to take your baby yet you are still standing steadfast and serving him that's great faith so great faith now listen if great faith is only measured by if we can walk out of the Lion's Den walk out away from The Sword then you've got to exclude some in Hebrews 11 cuz not all of them in Hebrews 11 walked out of the Lion's Den some of them said they were also tortured to death oh brother Samuel that's a downer shouldn't be a downer it was God God they were serving the purpose and the will of almighty God see friends we do not want to create our own well this is how it's going to be that's not you God's not asked you to create your own world and try to step into it he's already created a place that you and I can step into as a matter of fact there for a vision to break before us of a perfectly whole person and the prophet said you see yourself there and walk step by step by step until you become that person might be a lot of things along the road right might be a lot of things that that person will have to go through maybe they'll have to go through test maybe they'll have to go through confessing after after time and time again might be a lot of medicine they'll have to take might be different things they'll have to do but you know what it's not one spec less of a mighty Miracle by a mighty God that's right oh Hallelujah we having the same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I believed and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing having this assurance that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you so we have an assurance God is going to deliver us from the circumstance I've got an assurance on that I'm speaking Paul can you tell us how I don't know how can you tell us what's going to come I don't know what's going to come next but I know that as he has raised us up already we who were dead in sin and trespasses I don't know how he's going to do it I don't know what he's going to do I don't need to know the plan I just know The God Who holds my life In His Hands that's my Assurance that's why it's so important in us taking in the word of God brother BR says see he comes back to that throughout the message remember we what I read to you in the opening quote of about that a positive thinking we're not against positive thinking but positive thinking you must think on positive things brother B says positive faith comes from positive a positive Source there's only one positive Source not my idea your idea but God's right this is this is our positive Source this is the word of God where we draw our strength from now think about it our word the word of God brother R would would put it so simple in our lives he would say that sometimes there's things that you know he said maybe he said we're standing in here and we've got doubt in here and the doubt that we have in here he says and yet we're trying to reach out and take a hold of a promise we can't do it that way you know friends listen this is one thing that I am so thankful for more and more over the years as I've studied the message and look at it that the message ain't like putting uh I on a messed up cake you saying what do you mean by that we're not putting icing over man's theology but God has went to the very root of it I don't care what kind of icing you put on it you could have I love buttercream icing Lord have mercy I love that stuff you could put that on the you could put that on maybe a cake that's eaten with mold and everything else you've ruined the frosting God not what this message did are you hearing me now neither it it showed us the pattern neither does God just come and smear things over on our lives that's why the new birth is not a Reformation not a smear over on the outside the new birth begins on the inside is that right that's where real healing takes place is on the inside and he works to the outside so when we can receive the word of God that's the only thing that has life in it now what catches the word it has our spirit catches the word it comes into our mind but it's not our mind that has the power it's the word that has the transforming power in it and we can let that word as the prophet tells us let that word drop all the way on down and then it'll clean out anything that needs to be cleaned out that's my desire that's my desire because we we don't get answers any other way so to think about this without maybe dwelling on that so much here this morning but I want to just this is a quote here that I've sent this a lot of times to many different brothers and different ones that been dealing with different things even in overseas and other places too but I I this came to me as I was praying I didn't have this down but yesterday morning as I was just praying and looking to to the Lord Lord what would you have me to say and as I begin to look over it he brought this quote back to me and I want to read it to you brother B says let us pray and know and lay hands on you anointing you with oil and watch what God will do no matter what the circumstances Jesus said in mark 11:24 he said if Thou shalt say to this mountain be plucked up and cast into the sea and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you say shall come to pass Thou shalt have what you say now brother said let me quote the Lexicon on that the original Greek here's the way it reads if Thou shalt say to this mountain be ye lifted up and thrown into the sea and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said is coming to pass you can have what you say Amen that phrase is a huge phrase amen but this time you mean us to move mountains we have been restored back to where Adam fell from as Sons and Daughters of God and let me just say this to you it's not the physical mountains that I am bothered with it's not physical mountains you're bothered with are you hearing me now it is not physical storm so much that you're bothered with although God may have dropped inspiration on your heart for a need or or something that has come about in your life but then when when I look at the prophet speaking at that snowstorm to me it was not God letting me know Samuel this is what I want you to consecrate yourself for is be ready when snow storms God knew he'd be picking the wrong guy cuz I love snow but what was God saying that there will be storms come in your life that the forecast says you better get out of here quick that the forecast says this is going to happen I see the events woo it's getting cold in here now oh the wind is blowing there are storms that want to arise in your life and God took a prophet to show you and I what the rest of the crop Sons and Daughters of God and where God would bring you and I to is that right there's storms in our life there's things that come up in our life think about this is to me this is a v some of the this is such a powerful statement right here that brother R makes in this quote don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you've said is coming to pass hallelujah it's in that time frame right there is when the devil wants to work when the second miracle that was done in Canaan there was another man not the Roman centurium but a different man accounted in the Book of John he wants the Lord Jesus to come to his house this man wants him to come to his house and the Lord Jesus said I I you know I I can I'm not able he said but let me just let's just let's just send the word and the man retakes that and receives the word so it doesn't come the way he's asking for it he wants Jesus to come to his house but Jesus is unable physically to get there but he says I'm going to send my word because that's who I am Hallelujah and the Bible says that as the man went went on he believed and those in his house come running when as he got near home and he asked them what hour did he begin to amend amend meaning turning for the better he didn't ask him what hour did he get up and go out to the garden and start gardening no what hour did he amend that's why the prophet said if you can only move your finger think you move it then once you move this then you move another one then you move another one then you move another one then you keep going is that right oh but Lord have mercy if it don't all happen at once I I didn't get nothing that ain't the word of God sometimes friends what's happened is as we get defeated in our own thoughts that we have interpreted or placed and then then the enemy wants to come around and said see God don't keep his word I'm telling you right now God keeps his word there's been things I'll just be honest there's been things that didn't happen the way I thought it was going to happen but you know what God fulfilled his word hallelujah Benjamin had a had a growth right there many of you remember it as a as just a real real little baby had a growth we went through prayer line after prayer line that's right nothing wrong with a prayer line to me I I go I would have went through another one well but the same it must have been your faith wasn't right well you know you you question that you look at it because we we read you know you know how it is we can read in the word of God and then Satan has a way of trying to get in there and what what's he trying to do he wants to isolate you as though you're some strange odd bird and it's something weird why it ain't happening to you and he'll lead you out to this one little little private little little secluded spot and then want to drop it on you you must not be a believer all right let's pin him in I'll never forget the one night we were sitting back there my dad was ministering we had already went over to the Cleveland Clinic cuz they were going to do a surgery and remove that remove that that tumor that growth they were going to remove it right there doctor had got up they had to put him asleep cuz he was such a little guy they had to put him asleep so they could do the x-rays and things and here you have your little lifeless honey how old was he two two years old so here he was and I remember just sitting there in that little room where they have you waiting my knees were touching to bed and I'm looking at him there and I'm praying I'm looking to the Lord and the Lord I'll never forget where the Lord spoke to my heart and he just spoke to me simply like this he said it he said in this manner he said you know it's as great a miracle even if it comes through this way it's still me that never has ever left me Hall that's good because all healing comes from God now that's what the prophet has told us and we see it in the scripture right amen even haki used figs maybe that would have been the essential oils of that day even Hezekiah used figs is that right but all healing comes from God but I never forget when Dad was preaching in here my wife we were sitting there and my wife said you know she said honey she said uh she said why don't we go ahead you know cuz scheduled surgery was scheduled they had done all that prep work did a X-rays and stuff like that so why don't we go ahead and have him prayed for and I looked there I said okay okay I had thought about it I said okay let's let's go ahead so I walk up here I'm standing right here was right here and the deacons had come around at that time and I'm standing right here and my dad begins to pray and out of my mouth I'm not praying God to help him through the surgery but what came out of my mouth was thanking God for his healing I didn't make that happen I didn't will that to happen in my heart I was already accepted no less of Faith this must be the Avenue Lord you want us to go Hallelujah hallu but sitting at the dinner table there I think a week later I looked over at the dinner table I said honey I said that that thing's going down ain't it look at I think it's going down she stopped she turned around she said it is it's going down I said praise the lord well his surgery you know was still like a week or a couple weeks out from that right there and here we we contined to look at it that thing went down to where it completely was gone from his body hallu what was that sovereignly given by God it was brother Samuel's nothing it's God sovereignly dropping down and giving a word it wasn't brother Samuel standing here and saying I don't want my boy to go through a surgery Lord you come down and heal him NOP that would have been the wrong approach Lord we don't have time to go through a surgery sorry I understand how pressures and things feel but I don't really think anybody has any time to go through anything right I don't think anybody has any time I don't think anybody says hey you know what I got time for a surgery this coming month I don't think anybody say thinks that but you see it's careful on our approach to the word of God oh my when you say to this mountain be moved and it stands there well it didn't happen oh it did happen oh I love that when you said mountain move may be one little significant grain of sand turned loose out of the hundreds of billions and billions of tons one little grain moved but it's begin to take place hold that faith and watch that mountain [Applause] disappear now I love this part of the quote here Thou shalt say in thine heart disease move from my child disease move from my body in the name of the Lord Jesus and don't doubt right there the good germs take on a new armor and a new weapon and the enemy begins to back up oh the enemy ain't run no he just backing up but let's keep him backing up that's right amen he is defeated because Christ in the drinking of his myrr at Calvary defeated the devil and every one of his powers and he stripped him of everything he had and he's nothing but a bluff and he can go through with it if he can he'll do it Hallelujah Hebrews 4:14 everybody all right seeing then seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God do you understand what that means he's Rose above every principality not did he not only did he conquer the underworld he has conquered both invisible and visible Realms he has ascended above it all Hallelujah that's why Paul could say we're persecuted but looking above that I'm not forsaken cast down but I'm not forgotten am see then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession it means to take a hold of it to seize it not to discard it but to keep it carefully and Faithfully Hebrews 1023 how how do I keep that carefully and Faithfully even watching amen where you would go with it now I don't think I mean I don't think any sister that has white shoes on would have like a white dress and everything else I don't think they're going to be wanting to walk back through those woods I don't think so cuz I can tell you right now as soon as you get off that sidewalk back there right beyond that fire fire pit a little bit you go to sinking you want waiters you want good hunting boots on when you go back there ain't that right brother Joey H it's it's water back there that's no joke but it's what are you saying that you wouldn't take what God has given you which is greater than any outfit of white a word that God would give you in this service and then take it and just get around the wrong company and allow the things to start to take it right out of you you've got to guard what God gives you guard it a word from the Lord guard it Mary heard what the shepherd said and the Bible said she pondered she kept those things in her heart Hebrews 10:23 let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering amen for he this is why this is how this is why and this is how for he is faithful that promised faith without works is dead everybody all right seat belts on we're going to run through some quotes all right bring the lady you believe me with all your heart believe Jesus Christ makes you well right now go thanking God saying Praise You Lord praise you don't never have no negative testimony testify positive Jesus has healed me and I'm well go and you will receive your healing oh oh wait a minute so you mean her PR was not based on that she saw things change right there no go on your way and rejoice and you will receive your healing cuz where does healing start from the inside it starts by a word from the Lord oh they're just working themselves up that's just nothing but fanaticism there is a whole banquet of quotes that I could quote and keep you here for days and you know this as Believers you listen to it on the tape I hope you don't turn the tape over after brother brandom finishes preaching because it's just getting it it's moving in even deeper and there's a lot of nuggets that are dropped in there along the way a lot of real good counsel that's dropped into those moments now notice what he's doing he's instructing this lady I want you to think about it he's not saying when when he's looking at it he's not saying that if lady if you go from here and you continue to take your medicine if you going and do that you're being negative that's not what he's saying he's not saying if you go from here and the next day when you wake up you say my I got a little pain in my back that's not being negative but what you do after that and say but by his stripes I am healed Hallelujah I might feel a little bad right back here but right here I tell you what I buy his straps I'm Healed what is it I'm not having a negative testimony I see the Giants I'm not saying there ain't no Giants there but I'm saying if God be for us who can be against us hallelujah hallelujah that's why sister d a lot of you know brother and sister D you you heard it on tape you remember that they own Brown Supply down there in Lima some of the brothers brother and them retired from their Brown Supply in those places down there that brother Dow you'll hear Brother Ram talk about him on tape and you remember that sister da came through the line and she began to get real sick after going to one of the meetings there at the Tabernacle they were always around where brother Brown was at and she got real sick and all of a sudden brother Brown he saw he saw her getting real sick and brother Tom called up brother Brown he said brother Bram he said Mama's getting awful bad she's getting over sick and brother B said hold on he said hold on minut wait a minute he said just wait a minute he said um he said brother Tommy said ask your mom if she stopped taking her medicine so brother Tom L said mom he said Mama he said did you stop taking your medicine she said well yeah she said I came across the platform and and the Lord spoke through the prophet and said I'm Healed brother Bram said you tell her not to stop taking that medicine but in time her body will bear the testimony of it aren't you glad for that witness oh I I know these things maybe aren't WR but I appreciate them testimonies and that part of balance you say why do you appreciate that because I know how the devil wants to try to wear out God's people and wants to tell you you don't have faith or this or that or the other but God said you [Applause] do all right dive into another one he said now he says you look at your symptom and you look at your Sy you say well look here I was prayed for for a crippled hand my hand ain't ain't no better that's no sign you're not healed that's right God said so that's it no matter what that hand takes place it's what God said yes so my hand still crippled but that that that doesn't take preeminence over what God Said what God Said is What I believe and it's going to bring this in line hallelujah it's what he said it ain't from my hand it's what God Said I accepted it and I'll stay with it that's all he could open up it can open up today tomorrow might be 25 years let your testimony be positive you know funny thing about it is brother Brown would refer to Abraham and he preached on Abraham's life all the way through the message and yet when people begin to testify positive you get classified as a cook the mess all the way through the message oh but brother Samuel Abraham had a word from God he didn't know how and all the points of how it was going to come but he took one word and walked with that word just like you as a child of Abraham by his stripes I'm Healed when the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is mine you take a promise of God with a right mental attitude toward it and you walk as a child of Abraham so when Abraham went and paid the bill remember what the prophet said when they went to the hospital dramatizing it what did Abraham and Sarah what were they called CS nuts this old couple yeah father of Nations how's it coming how's it going for you all how's the registry coming over at uh doubts are us that's good watch this the friends these are simple words but I pray God help us there there's a reason God would bring this to us and give us Direction in this hour every time you get sick when you're prayed for and you go out and get a little sick and you say well I guess I lost my healing then your testimony becomes negative and Jesus can't say no more for you now you hear what he's saying he's not saying that you don't say well you know what my that pain in my back is still there but he's My Healer not that pain in my back I must not got healed I must not got a touch from God and then you know what it didn't work no that's when your testimony becomes negative he's the high priest of your confession sitting there making intercessions on your confession what you believe Brianna go to paragraph 39 please you've got to have your testimony and your confession positive not according to my feelings but according to what he said I tell you it's easier to read it it's easier to sit here and say Amen to it but you know what this is this is equipping you and reminding you of what armor you haveall that your feelings are not you feelings are things that are real that's around you but there's a greater reality amen hallelujah those feelings are just temporal that which is eternal is right there as well you got a choice on what you're going to look at is that right now notice this I I love this quote too everybody all right now healing is not something that you just say well yeah I believe it I believe it now that's all right if that's the best you can do just mentally or just say well yes I I see it I believe it I accept it I love this you see you see God's desire to make a way yeah everybody hearing what I'm saying like God did in the Old Testament he said if you can't bring a lamb bring a turtle dove God's interested I want you to get what you need so I provided so if a person brother Ram says if that's the best that you can do just mentally he never said don't do anything at all he never said that he said if that's the best that you can do just mentally or just say well I see it I believe it I accept it then if you accept it on those basis keep saying it over and over say it out loud say it over and over just keep saying it I'm Healed I'm Healed say it until you actually believe it and when you believe it then it's going to take place boo devil boo devil Hallelujah you're not without hope you're not without a way the devil said that's the best you can do well look out buddy you better put earplugs in cuz I'm going to say it over and over and over and over and over and over and over what kind of playlist you got oh I got a playlist about the promises that Belong To Me Oh They'll shuffle through they'll Loop they'll repeat over and over and over and over and a matter of fact I might put a little step to it might put a little dance to it I'm [Applause] Healed oh brother Samuel that's just emotional workup maybe for you it is but I've see people get excited and expressive at things that absolutely have no life and would criticize the moving of God can I read the rest of the testimony or the quote don't have a negative testimony every time you confess well I still feel bad today now watch that's not the negative part it's this next little clip I guess I you you could finish that so if you well I I you know how are you feeling well I still feel bad but he's my healer what are you going to do I'm just going to set him right out in the edge of my tent and I'm going to watch for him I still I maybe still have the pain but you know what I'm going to watch for him cuz by his stripes I'm Healed see it's when we put the next part on there well I still have I still feel bad I guess you go right straight back in the same rut you was in the beginning there's not a man or woman in here that is baptized with a holy spirit but what would start your confession I believe I've lost the Holy Spirit I believe it's gone from me you'll go right down listen he says you'll never live above your confession Jesus is the high priest of our confession he said any scholar knows profession is confession too now sitting at the right hand of the father to make intercessions upon what our confession he can't do nothing for you until first you confess he's done it I want you to watch as as I'm going through these quotes you understand why even today purposely I haven't dealt with that of Mark of Mark 11 injectivity how the Lord has brought it here and there but this is not talking about when a word is dropped down such as as just speak the word when squirrels were spoken to existence that's sovereignly given but this right here is an access to the promises that we have and we take those promises and we look to the Lord if God gives us a direct word so be it but either way God's going to keep his word because any direct word he's going to give will never take away from the word he's already given hallah is that right it's like we talked about on Thursday we do general orders until specific orders come when you accepted now watch this this is how simple it is I love this now he says now I'm not saved tonight because I get happy and Shout that isn't it I'm not H I'm not saved because the gift of God works through me I'm saved because I have met the conditions that Jesus Christ required from me I'm saved according to the Bible not because I feel like I'm saved right I don't know about you sometimes my feelings are not there feelings but you this this is where we learn to live not by our feelings don't get me wrong I like feelings oh brother Samuel I don't ah you're lying I love to feel the presence of God I love I love that feeling on a mountain top I don't like feelings in the valley I I just don't like them but you know what I've learned that the valley does not have to dictate or allow my feelings to control my life sometimes it's things that we have to press beyond what we don't feel like do the opposite of what you don't feel like well I don't feel like going to church press beyond that because you sure didn't get that thought from God I mean God didn't tell you you just stay home tonight rest in your recliner God didn't tell you that how could he do that he's speaking contrary to his word are you hearing me church sometimes we just have feelings well you know I feel and I feel but look at this I'm not saved because I feel like I'm saved Satan can whip you around the stump on your feelings but he can't when it's thus sayith Lord he can't wait across that that'll defeat him now he says when you believe you were saved sitting in your seat wherever you was you accepted it and begin to confess and tell people you were saved you kept on saying I'm saved the people said watch this there ain't no difference in you but you believe there was and you kept with your confession and after a while it worked righteousness all your neighbors everybody knows you're saved now because you believed it you confessed it what happened what changed you he's the high priest of your confession setting at the right hand of the father making good on what you're confessing Lord I'm just no good he just sits there well what are you doing I can't intercede on that cuz that's not my thoughts that that's not my thoughts concerning you right well Lord I I don't I don't think I'll ever get healed he just sits why that's not his word he's already given his word concerning you and he ain't going to change his mind Glory blessed be the name of the Lord I feel like running Hallelujah now watch this he said it's the same thing about healing so listen if you're sitting here this morning and you're in need of Salvation take what has just been read to you quote after quote I could give you many more it starts with you taking the word and beginning to confess it you say but brother Samuel I still got this sin in my life I've still got that quit looking at your symptoms they are lying vanities look at the word of [Applause] God brush the seaweed back get it out of your mouth and keep on saying he is my savior he is my redeemer he has saved me he is my deliverer he's my chain breaker Hallelujah let the redeemed of the Lord say [Applause] so the Lord that's the same thing it is by healing you accept him as your healer renounce your feelings what's that mean renounce your feelings it means if your feelings was sitting beside you right there you say no longer I ain't saving this seat for you you know what I'm saying you know how your buddies wanting lunch you know you put your milk over here put this over here and you save your seats what you need to do is when symptoms feelings want to say can I sit beside you nope no room for you here no room for feelings here healer renounce your Fe healer always says accept him as your healer renounce your feelings it's not by feelings it's by faith say you're healed believe you're healed act like you're healed associate with those who believe in healing and God will bring you right out to a perfect soundness of health will not fail so you mean to tell me that just like even Brother Carlos when you went through the operation for the cancer that was there in your body you went through with a confession the Lord is my healer there was still a little spot that was there that they did radiation for how many days 36 36 days and through it all the Lord is my healer what was it claiming God's promise standing on God's promised word so he wasn't lying when he said I am healed he wasn't lying yeah I know and yes I got to go through this radiation if that's what listen if God don't want me to go through it then God will stop it I can't control that that's in God's hands remember healing comes in one of four ways it's either like that of the lion where you stand with a boldness on it and God's giving you word or it's an ox we don't like the ox anointing but that's passing to the other side to our healing then there's also the man anointing that's medical Medical Science but there's also the eagle Miracle still God the whole time I can't control that I'll be honest with you I'm just you know I'm just being straight out with you there's many times would love for everything that comes my way it' be an eagle anointing but there's sometimes that God said there's still too much Samuel there and God's got to mold some things out not that I'm bad not that I you're better than me it's just God working on me just like he works on youall but what is it all along taking the promise of God and standing on that promise huj I'm Healed I think of brother Ron Spencer every Monday morning when he has to go and get expected to see if there's any more spots on the skin by a whole team of doctors and then scans that he has to go through over and over but yet through it all you'll see brother Ron stand right there and say I believe tonight I can walk out of this meeting completely whole are you hearing me it's not negative I realize the circumstan are around but in it all I'm not defeated I am not defeated Hallelujah you see sometimes it's us recognizing on how to balance and where we get so entangled in our mind I don't want to have a negative testimony think back to the text that I read you Paul was not negative when he said I'm perplexed but I'm not in despair amen he spoke of the conditions that was surrounding but he declared my feelings are not ruling this situation Paul where's your secret source of strength I'm drawing from The Unseen realm pulling it down into my life amen receiving strength amen would you stand with me I want you to do something here with me I just my there's many many powerful wonderful quotes that there's a lot more you could read but I only grabbed took certain ones I felt like that would help us the Lord pressed on my heart to do and but I want you to think of this when brother Bram he asked you know how many times brother brandham through the meetings would ask individuals and people he would he would let them know he said that you know I'm going to pray a prayer and I want you to repeat it pray it after me and brother Brown would say that and then he would tie that into to like the Roman nobleman speak the word only brother Brown would you know in many different places in the message he would say that and he would you know speak of how he say surely says I I should know what it takes to defeat Satan but he says I want you to repeat ran out of the message the living Jesus Christ he says I want you to pray it and repeat it I'll just repeat it you pray it I think this would be fitting starts out with the next thing almighty God I think it'd be fitting if we do this right here this morning now I'm not just doing this just as a routine I believe right here that God still answers prayer sure does I believe God still answers prayer amen hu can we can we go through this together almighty God God the author of Life Giver of every good gift look down upon me now in Mercy see my sickness and my conditions and Look Into My Heart Lord if there be any unbelief oh God take it from me now for I believe thee help thou my unbelief I am now coming with a sincere heart to accept my healing now make may my faith be sufficient to receive it in Jesus Christ's name I ask it Hallelujah brother Bram says as your heads are bowed and your eyes are closed he says I want you to imagine what Jesus is doing right now the Holy Spirit wooing over you his mercies and power coming into your body right now make making you well the angels of God are hovering around you I believe that's a declaration if there was a sister just one of them where I'm s right here where she was looking at the picture in the hospital she had the picture right there of the pillar of fire taken in the Houston Coliseum and she just began to look at that and begin to think upon the Lord she said brother brandham I can't explain it she said but that same Pillar of Fire came out of that picture and moved right through this room she walked out of there a well woman it's what we're looking at it's what we're looking at I am not going to give symptoms the time of day that's right no sir are you hearing me symptoms are not going to become something to our sure we feel pain we feel these things but it's not going to dictate by God's grace Our Lives you agree with that say Lord by your grace amen listen friends no matter where you're at this morning even for that of what God gave us even about salvation about the promise of the Holy Ghost listen I could have read countless quotes here of the Prophet approaching in that way you must take the word and believe it and I love how he said it he said if you can just take it on that basis then you take it and say it over and over and over say it out loud why would he say say it out loud you realize this is not the intelligence of a man who didn't even have a seventh grade education these things that I'm reading right here right now science has just finding out about in the past years right what when brother would preach of the the the conscience and subconscious and deal with that and tell us it's the guy down here on the inside that runs the ship so why is he saying say it out loud over and over and over why it's not me trying to talk down Satan is trying to get this guy down here to say all right let's pull out of the dock let's go forward Hallelujah we are believers yeah equipped as the army of the Living God we're not defeated we're not Forsaken and let me just say it like this we refuse to let the enemy hijack our body we refuse to allow the enemy to plant terrorist in our body this body sure it's not my inheritance but it is my possession and I'm not going to tolerate No tunnels of Hamas through my possession [Applause] no hijacking here not going to hijack my mind not going to hijack my spirit not going to hijack there my feelings no anybody else with me Hey listen you got something greater here than the mad you got an allseeing eye watching you knows exactly where the enemy might be working but oh what a God that we have on our side if God be for us brother Ryan what do we say to these things if God be for us who can be against us let's just let's just offer a word of prayer we've received what we've already prayed let's just give God thanks can we do that thank you [Applause] Lord hallelujah Heavenly Father we want to say thank you this morning Lord Lord truly we feel like Joshua did that morning he knew that Jericho was the first place to take but he didn't know how it was to be done but he went and he began to meditate away from all the noise and he met the chap the captain of the Lord's host Hallelujah it was when you made yourself known of who you were that Joshua laid down all of his thoughts laid down any idea laid down at all and say what would you have your servant Do Lord Jesus I feel this morning I feel I feel like Lord just like Joshua felt that morning that's not making me or these people anything anything else Lord but I believe you're the same God cuz there's things Lord that we we're just being honest Lord we don't know we know you've given us your word and we're standing on that we may not know Lord what's what comes next or what comes next or here or there but oh I want to say thank you for Lord how that you have spoken to our needs Lord Lord there's needs you know that we're praying about right now but I know that there's even needs right here that are Lord their unknown needs that are upon hearts even hearts Lord that we looking to you oh God in Salvation maybe Lord even some as you brought out in just a few of them quotes right here this morning that there's some Lord that there's been something that had got a hold of them and their confession turned the other way may they take Lord and receive the grace of God that has uncovered the enemy and the lie that he's wanted to whisper to them Lord Lord may they take the truth and receive and stand on that Lord God and confess it Lord may they not look at and say well I don't feel any different I don't may they Lord God take your word because your word is greater than any feelings Lord amen our feelings will lie to us Lord my feelings have lied to me many times Lord your Prophet said when he was a younger Christian how that Lord times he would go by his feelings he said the devil would beat me around around the stump he said and I finally learned to just rest and stand on I have met God's conditions and I'm going to stand on his word Lord I'm thankful I'm thankful you teach us you help us you show us Lord you lift us up when we've fallen down you encourage us I pray father Lord God when we would even leave from this building even beginning right now may Lord in our hearts Lord we just simply just saying Lord remedy any doubt that would be there and just Lord confessing your word may we go forth Lord even from this moment I thank Lord God of brother Bill Lord when he would go through Lord the pet scan on Tuesday his confession will not change I'm Healed by his stripes I'm he heal am for Lord God it's you that's leading and guiding all the way we don't have to fear or wonder or worry always think about Lord God that little that that little sister and that brother Lord who he waited on the end of the bed your Prophet tells it in greatest battle ever fought that all of a sudden he felt that little flutter come in the room and he asked he said since that little flutter the doctor went and began to look for that lump That was supposed to be on his wife he said' I don't even see it I don't see it he said take her up there needs to be another scan done they when they did another scan there was nothing there now Lord to me when I read those things what it what it what it speaks to me is the rest that we have in you we don't have to try to make anything happen work anything up we take you at your word Lord you're the one who is leading us for the scripture has said for the sons of God are led by the spirit of God it's not us leading you Lord It's You leading us so if we keep our eyes on you we'll not miss what you want us to do so Lord help us there's many needs throughout this congregation but I want to say thank you Lord I believe dear God that what we have repeated right here I I don't believe Lord we've just repeated it we've prayed it amen now Lord we go forth from here say it believe it act like it am your

just kind come back up come back up and so we took her to the doctor and they found obstruction in her vow and we got a picture of her it's was just just a little skeleton there so I said when he we I did the surgery and that did good they got the instruction but then there was a great big hernia coming up on that baby's stomach and we back to see him and I said Doctor can can this Heria go away and he said no these kind will not go away he said we have to wait till this baby gets some strength and then we we'll operate on it and I said well doctor we're Christians we're going to have this baby prayed for he just looked at me so we Tu her back to Virginia because just I told you was young CH was looking for a church that believe this message but brother Mitchell that he's was healed on this day the scriptures fulfilled the Lord called him out he was coal Min and had a tumor on his lung and God healed him well he prayed with the baby we took her back to Ohio took her back to the
