[36:16] minister i'm weary and i'm tired after
[36:19] the service and i believe the reason of
[36:21] that is because we just we just want to
[36:23] enter in
[36:24] and we're actually entering in to
[36:26] heavenly places
[36:28] amen these bodies themselves eventually
[36:30] they'll it'll be a catch up here amen
[36:33] it'll catch up with what god's already
[36:35] done on the inside
[36:37] amen so i just want to ask my mom if she
[36:39] would come and just give a testimony of
[36:41] ben can you
[36:44] thank you sir
[36:46] it doesn't matter where you just come on
[36:48] out here they can see you i want me to
[36:49] stand by you
[36:53] god bless you this morning i just had it
[36:55] on my heart to give a testimony of what
[36:57] what god did last week during those
[36:59] services
[37:00] up for weeks i've had so much pain in my
[37:03] uh right hip and all the way down my leg
[37:05] that
[37:06] i couldn't hardly play the piano without
[37:07] spending days afterwards just in so much
[37:09] pain i couldn't even sleep at night
[37:11] so last sunday when they gave a chance
[37:14] for prayer i just kept feeling that
[37:15] nudge and something just kept saying no
[37:17] you'll be all right just stand here and
[37:18] claim it but and i know you can do that
[37:21] too i've done that but for some reason i
[37:23] just felt to go up and i went up and
[37:26] it was prayed for by the brothers and
[37:27] when i went back to my seat sat there
[37:29] and we were still worshiping the lord
[37:31] and all of a sudden something
[37:33] just warm started in my heel and my foot
[37:35] and went all the way up to my hip and
[37:37] every bit of that pain is gone i just
[37:39] want to thank you
[37:42] amen
[37:47] amen
[37:49] amen god is good isn't he
[37:52] amen he's the same he's the same
[37:54] yesterday today and forever
[37:56] amen we just so appreciate him so much
[37:59] and uh i just you know when we look at
[38:02] the services that we had here last week
[38:05] you know
[38:07] you
[38:08] i looked at you know how things how
[38:09] things kind of get
[38:11] started and you i just look at the
[38:13] opening service and then i
[38:15] just kind of looking at the next service
[38:17] and you know
[38:18] there's times i know the needs and
[38:20] there's other times i just sense things
[38:22] in my spirit and you're just praying
[38:25] and i just had just a real resolve as we
[38:27] we do and i believe we should as
[38:29] believers when we come to the house of
[38:31] god we just have an expectation god's
[38:33] going to speak to us
[38:35] god knows about our need like we looked
[38:37] at that on thursday night he's attentive
[38:39] to our needs
[38:41] and and you know no matter what the text
[38:43] that's read sometimes when the text is
[38:45] read right there it just strikes our
[38:47] heart and we say oh my here it is and
[38:49] then there's other times when the text
[38:50] is read and you can say oh i don't know
[38:53] my that
[38:54] where is this going to go but you know
[38:56] it whatever the text is that's read god
[38:59] is in control
[39:01] and there's ways that god you've seen
[39:03] this as believers over the years how god
[39:05] will take a text and god brings that
[39:07] text he'll bring it right down and he
[39:08] ministers right to our needs and god
[39:10] will take a man that's yielded to him
[39:13] and he
[39:14] will cause that man that man will follow
[39:17] him right off of the text write down
[39:19] certain pathways and you know brother
[39:21] brandon said it like this he said
[39:23] people say brother brown why you go down
[39:25] all these other roads he said because
[39:26] everybody i have preached to doesn't
[39:27] live on the highway
[39:29] [Laughter]
[39:31] i like that simplicity because you come
[39:33] to a place and i think that's the
[39:35] greatest thing you know brother bram
[39:36] tells us over and over of what a real
[39:38] true gift is it's to get ourselves out
[39:41] of the way and i believe that that's
[39:43] what really the the gift of the holy
[39:46] spirit does within the life of an
[39:49] individual as well it helps us to be
[39:51] able to get out of the way
[39:53] so that god can do what he's already
[39:55] purposed to do in our life and that's
[39:57] always the biggest battle that's the
[39:59] biggest that's always the challenge and
[40:01] satan throws every sort of hindrance
[40:03] that he can to try to hinder that
[40:05] working in our life but if we can just
[40:07] continue just to yield to the lord and
[40:09] be honest with him say lord i need help
[40:11] right now or maybe i'm feeling this way
[40:14] and just invite him in and allow him
[40:16] just to move within that channel and if
[40:18] there's things that's in the way
[40:20] god is merciful to as we acknowledge
[40:23] that to just help us and give a strength
[40:25] to overcome that and that that would be
[40:27] pushed aside so that the holy spirit can
[40:30] just flow right through our lives
[40:32] i want to just
[40:34] just look into the word here just a few
[40:36] moments
[40:37] this morning
[40:39] and if you could would you just stand
[40:41] with me
[40:49] i just i thought last sunday and i i
[40:52] didn't want to after the service was
[40:54] over it was just
[40:56] one way i felt like i could have just
[40:57] come back and just reiterated some
[40:59] points because i
[41:00] we looked at if you just look at the
[41:01] thought no turning back on sunday you
[41:03] think well yeah it's just no turning
[41:05] back but the holy spirit came down so
[41:07] personally
[41:09] and helped us to see how little things
[41:12] little minute things that we can get
[41:14] caught up in that actually cause our
[41:17] attention to be taken away
[41:20] from where it needs to be
[41:22] and this is an hour if there's an hour
[41:24] we need to be locked in on the lord
[41:26] jesus christ this is the hour
[41:29] it's always been for every believer it
[41:31] was never a time to live loose but this
[41:32] is a time all
[41:34] hell is against this revelation
[41:38] every every demon power has its guns and
[41:42] everything set to try to deter and let
[41:44] me just say this to you
[41:46] don't underestimate the enemy
[41:49] but always try every spirit
[41:52] and evaluate everything that comes
[41:54] across your pathway in your life
[41:56] and look you know sometimes we look at
[41:58] things as evil and we think oh my you
[42:00] know smoking or drinking or these are
[42:03] all this all attributes of unbelief it
[42:05] is terrible it's all attributes of
[42:07] unbelief but evil is anything that
[42:10] hinders spiritual growth
[42:14] that's evil
[42:16] see it totally because remember the word
[42:19] doesn't
[42:20] when jesus came remember he didn't do
[42:22] away with
[42:24] you know where it says uh in in the
[42:26] scripture thou shalt not lust after your
[42:28] neighbor's wife now the word coming in
[42:30] flesh it magnifies and said whosoever
[42:34] looketh upon a woman to lust in her
[42:36] heart so it took away from the actual
[42:38] act to where it got down into the very
[42:40] condition in the heart because that's
[42:41] where things began
[42:43] and that's what that's what calvary
[42:45] that's what redemption came to do is
[42:47] deal with this on the inside so the word
[42:50] coming in our midst it doesn't uh you
[42:53] know just cause things to step back it
[42:55] really gets down to a place for us to
[42:57] evaluate what is evil
[43:00] anything that hinders spiritual growth
[43:03] and i'm not going to preach on that but
[43:05] i just
[43:06] i just think there's so many things that
[43:08] brother daryl was just ministering by
[43:10] the spirit of god things that the enemy
[43:12] would like to try to bring in to try to
[43:14] divide and everything else and i tell
[43:16] you i think we ought to just let
[43:17] everything else go and be
[43:19] single
[43:20] minded single vision single focus
[43:24] because when it all when you know when
[43:25] we get to the other side there ain't
[43:27] going i mean
[43:28] you know it always amazed me in lorraine
[43:30] lorraine you know it's a small city now
[43:32] some of you think it's big but i hate to
[43:34] burst your bubble it's not big it's not
[43:35] a it's not a cleveland it's not a it's
[43:37] not a new york but i always amazed me
[43:40] how the lorraine had even its divisions
[43:42] in the past it had its you know the
[43:44] mexican section the puerto rican section
[43:46] you everybody and it's amazing for a
[43:48] little city they got all these different
[43:50] catholic churches and this is where the
[43:52] puerto ricans go to church and this is
[43:54] where the uh you know the the polocks my
[43:57] there's so many different pollocks
[43:59] everywhere in lorraine you know my
[44:01] goodness you know i mean all these
[44:02] things you know what i'm saying
[44:04] that always amazed me and and that
[44:06] always amazed me in that part but you
[44:08] understand that's not how heaven is
[44:11] going to be
[44:13] it's not going to be a segregated
[44:15] section over here or this over here this
[44:17] over here you see what the holy spirit
[44:19] is doing right now it gathers together
[44:22] the real
[44:24] family of god
[44:26] it's not about it's not about skin color
[44:29] it's not about ethnicity it's not about
[44:31] all it's it's god gathering his word his
[44:34] children back to himself
[44:38] and god remember it's just like a great
[44:40] great bouquet of flowers god has a great
[44:42] bouquet and i'm glad about that
[44:45] really really thankful for that
[44:47] well that was free no charge
[44:50] let's look here in the scriptures here
[44:52] in
[44:54] second corinthians
[44:55] and
[44:56] chapter five
[44:58] and i want to
[45:00] look here at
[45:03] verse 14 and i want to read that we read
[45:05] these scriptures a couple weeks ago when
[45:07] we
[45:08] begin to
[45:10] uh just looking at the living
[45:13] voice of god
[45:14] and we know that the voice of god is
[45:16] alive and the voice of god has been
[45:19] alive
[45:20] and so as we were looking at that of the
[45:23] living voice of god we begin to look at
[45:25] the thought within that of the testimony
[45:29] and so that's what i want to begin to
[45:30] speak to you on this morning this kind
[45:32] of direction i'm going the testimony
[45:36] in verse 14 of second corinthians 5
[45:39] for the love of christ constraineth us
[45:43] because we thus judge that if one died
[45:46] for all then were all
[45:48] dead
[45:49] and that he died for all that they which
[45:52] lived should not henceforth live unto
[45:55] themselves
[45:56] but unto him which died for them and
[46:00] rose again
[46:01] wherefore henceforth know we know man
[46:04] after the flesh
[46:06] yea though we have known christ after
[46:08] the flesh yet now henceforth know we him
[46:11] no more
[46:12] therefore if any man be in christ
[46:16] he is a new creature
[46:19] old things are passed away behold all
[46:21] things are become new
[46:23] and all things are of god who hath
[46:26] reconciled us to himself
[46:29] by jesus christ and hath given to us the
[46:33] ministry
[46:34] of reconciliation so i want you to catch
[46:37] this there's no other reconciliation to
[46:40] god but by jesus christ
[46:44] amen he is the word
[46:47] is the blood
[46:48] it is the life
[46:50] is that right to wit now notice this
[46:53] this same ministry of reconciliation is
[46:55] with this
[46:57] it comes in the same measure the same
[46:59] pattern as verse 19 to wit that god was
[47:02] in
[47:03] christ
[47:04] reconciling the world unto himself
[47:08] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[47:11] and hath committed unto us the word of
[47:14] reconciliation
[47:16] he didn't remember even when the woman
[47:18] who was caught in adultery
[47:20] every one of them came around with
[47:22] stones and ready to stone her jesus just
[47:25] riding in the sand
[47:27] he did not even look up but he just said
[47:30] the one that's without sin let him cast
[47:32] the first stone
[47:35] and immediately stone started falling
[47:36] and started dropping
[47:39] because none of them could stand there
[47:42] in the presence of the word
[47:44] and be able to say well i'm without sin
[47:48] but you see now the lord jesus he turns
[47:51] to the woman and he says
[47:53] woman where are thine accusers you see
[47:55] the first thing that the word comes to
[47:58] do is dismantle
[48:00] all the accusations of the accuser
[48:05] the word comes to deal
[48:08] with the accuser
[48:10] talking about satan he comes to deal
[48:12] with that then he causes her to look
[48:15] around where are they
[48:18] at well there's no man lord he said
[48:21] neither do i condemn thee
[48:24] go and sin
[48:26] no more
[48:28] so now not only the accuser has been
[48:31] dismantled to hold but now he comes to
[48:35] bring a loosening to her life go and sin
[48:38] no more if if the lord jesus allowed
[48:41] those trespasses if he could look at her
[48:44] life and say oh no i i can't i can't
[48:46] touch her life or oh it's just such a
[48:48] terrible life it's such a horrible life
[48:51] but the lord jesus knew what was beneath
[48:54] that life
[48:56] you know what that was that was genesis
[48:58] 1. the earth was dark and void
[49:02] genesis 1 is the story of redemption of
[49:05] a child of god
[49:08] we were we were with darkness covered
[49:10] over our life but down on the inside
[49:13] there was a seed and that's what god
[49:16] came to deal with
[49:19] and bring to himself oh my god
[49:23] and now he has committed unto us the
[49:26] word of reconciliation now then we are
[49:31] ambassadors for christ brother brown
[49:33] would call us delegates
[49:35] as though god did beseech you by us we
[49:39] pray you in christ's dead for he or we
[49:42] pray you in christ dead be ye reconciled
[49:44] to god for he hath made him to be sin
[49:47] for us who knew no sin that we might be
[49:51] made the righteousness of god in him
[49:57] let's pray heavenly father
[49:59] lord jesus
[50:01] we just are so thankful lord for the
[50:03] testimony of god and knowing that lord
[50:06] there's other testimonies of your grace
[50:09] and your working lord we thank you
[50:12] father and lord once again this morning
[50:15] lord we just sensing lord your presence
[50:18] here now lord we just invite you o god
[50:21] that you would have free course here
[50:23] lord in every life and every heart this
[50:25] morning father i pray that god made
[50:29] every lord life lord walk in a real
[50:32] freedom and a liberty and father we take
[50:35] oh god the authority to bind satan and
[50:38] every one of his affliction diseases
[50:41] whether in the physical or the spiritual
[50:44] realm or in the soul that oh god that
[50:46] healing will come lord to every life and
[50:50] every heart lord may you come lord and
[50:52] speak to us this morning in a very
[50:54] personal way we pray in the name of
[50:57] jesus christ amen amen god bless you as
[51:00] you're being seated
[51:04] amen i want to just brothers i don't
[51:06] know if i'm going to need this or not
[51:07] today but i need to go ahead and have it
[51:09] for that for that slide i may need it
[51:15] may god help me not to trip on it
[51:19] if i get a little excited brother school
[51:22] it won't disturb me
[51:27] just don't turn it on now
[51:30] so i want to just deal with this thought
[51:32] just a little bit on
[51:34] the testimony
[51:37] i read this to you last last weekend and
[51:40] if you haven't read or listened to the
[51:42] message what house will you build me i
[51:45] mentioned it to you a few weeks ago it's
[51:47] 27 minutes long it just is so much
[51:51] instruction that's given
[51:53] in that little message
[51:55] of god's desire and the burden
[51:58] that this message find its rightful
[52:01] place
[52:02] in the hearts and lives of the people
[52:04] brother brahms also admonishing the
[52:06] people within uh their time and their
[52:09] dedication to the to the local work that
[52:12] has started right there with brother
[52:14] greene but i want to just break in on
[52:16] this here just to really get to our
[52:18] point
[52:20] brother branham you know he's noticing a
[52:21] condition i want to just read over this
[52:23] once again he said i know that each one
[52:25] of you if you feel like i do
[52:27] i'm so hungry to see the spirit of god
[52:30] moving i just can't hardly stand it
[52:32] some experiences i just had up in the
[52:34] mountain just to feel that once again
[52:37] that something that when i was first
[52:39] saved was so glorious to my heart and we
[52:43] can come into a place and we can sit and
[52:46] and see it among us that we are drying
[52:49] as we sit here in the desert i get among
[52:51] my brethren they talk with me and i talk
[52:53] with them always in a little way of
[52:55] watching and filling out there with the
[52:57] spirit as it was to see just the
[53:00] condition of that brother to see what's
[53:02] wrong
[53:03] i begin to fill us all reclining
[53:07] and getting away from the spirit
[53:09] it's become too natural a thing to us
[53:11] now
[53:12] to me i believe that this is more than
[53:14] just just of words that's being said i
[53:17] believe that this is a reflection
[53:20] of something that we should really
[53:21] reflect in our life not just today
[53:24] but ongoing every day
[53:26] it should be something that we'd because
[53:28] not to just take anything for granted
[53:31] because it's very easy for the things
[53:33] and the cares of life to encroach and to
[53:36] come about and to try to take away and
[53:39] begin to extract this from our lives and
[53:44] so this is why we need a continual
[53:46] renewing
[53:48] this is why we need a continual
[53:51] refilling of the holy ghost
[53:53] brother branham would put it like this
[53:54] he says when you feel yourself getting a
[53:57] little relaxed he said it's time to
[54:00] tighten up the buckle he said and ask
[54:03] god for a refilling of the holy ghost
[54:08] so i just believe this is where in our
[54:10] lives of how that we we're to really
[54:12] live we must worship in the spirit where
[54:15] the spirit of god not only our message
[54:18] should be the flame of the hour
[54:20] it should be the flame in our
[54:23] hearts
[54:24] it's got to be in our hearts or we can't
[54:28] rightly present it to the people the
[54:30] spirit has to pack the message itself he
[54:35] says i'm trusting and believing in every
[54:37] one of you to be a real
[54:39] christian now let me just let me just go
[54:42] brothers if you'll give me that give me
[54:43] that um
[54:45] uh the the overhead there just a moment
[54:47] here and let me just
[54:48] i'm gonna bring us back here just for a
[54:50] moment we're dealing with how that in
[54:52] this part and i want you to think of how
[54:54] when brother bradman says
[54:56] that
[54:57] this this message being the flame of the
[55:00] hour it must be the flame in our
[55:03] hearts
[55:04] or we can't rightly present it to others
[55:09] so we recognize that a presentation it's
[55:12] more than just what we say
[55:15] but it's got to be a presentation of
[55:18] life
[55:20] that's what this that's what the life
[55:23] and the token of the lord jesus christ
[55:25] does it brings to our life the real
[55:28] testimony of jesus christ and then our
[55:31] life becomes a disclosed testimony that
[55:36] i in every action that we do it is
[55:38] testifying to something
[55:41] everything that we do is a testimony and
[55:45] so
[55:45] god's desire when we look at how that
[55:48] this is here how god had given this to
[55:52] moses this burden you see that every one
[55:55] of us that are sitting here today
[55:58] are a three-room house
[56:00] we are body we are spirit and we are
[56:04] soul
[56:06] three is perfection it's perfected in
[56:08] threes
[56:09] and so you find that how god here when
[56:13] we look at this and we were looking at
[56:14] this the last time
[56:16] on these three courts and this is just
[56:18] this this here now just moving to a
[56:21] snapshot or a side view
[56:23] of of that tabernacle there to break
[56:26] that down and as we looked at that here
[56:28] uh the the week here before and we were
[56:31] dealing with it this being the body on
[56:34] the outside
[56:35] the body to where
[56:37] how you know that a life can here come
[56:40] and hear the word of god
[56:42] and the repent of their sins they hear
[56:44] the word they're enjoying the word but
[56:47] they're still
[56:48] sin still the nature is still in the
[56:51] life
[56:52] yet they're hearing the word hey how can
[56:54] you come to god without hearing the word
[56:58] you've got to hear the word the bible
[57:00] said when the truth itself has to be
[57:02] sounded out i think paul
[57:05] rehearses this in in romans 10 i believe
[57:07] it is where he says that whosoever shall
[57:10] call upon the name of the lord shall be
[57:12] saved he says how shall they call upon
[57:15] him whom they have not heard and how
[57:19] shall they hear without a preacher
[57:23] is that right you see this is why
[57:26] that he says then how shall they preach
[57:28] unless they be sent so the real ministry
[57:32] the real god calling let me just say
[57:33] this i'm not discrediting any other
[57:36] preacher or minister or in their
[57:38] organizations but i'm speaking right now
[57:40] and have to declare the real ministry of
[57:43] redemption is to call a life into a
[57:47] place of a union with jesus christ to
[57:50] where our life is changed it's more than
[57:53] just getting people to a church because
[57:56] people can come to a church and they can
[57:58] sit in a church you say a message church
[58:01] yes even a message church and they can
[58:04] sit in the outer court eat the word eat
[58:07] the manna and go back out and there's
[58:09] not a change in their life the same
[58:11] things continue repeating over and over
[58:14] why they've only come to the first court
[58:19] there's got to be a moving into this
[58:22] place to where the message the flame it
[58:26] moves into our heart it's got to go
[58:28] deeper than just this in the spirit
[58:30] realm because the spirit realm itself
[58:33] now it's entering into a place of
[58:36] consecration to where now how how the
[58:39] spirit of god is moved to sanctify that
[58:41] life right there in that spirit realm
[58:44] remember they had the lampstands those
[58:47] lights that are in there brother bram
[58:49] says right in there he said you'll find
[58:50] people they'll come to this place and
[58:53] they've just come far enough to have
[58:55] enough knowledge of the word that they
[58:57] can argue and debate and fuss and
[59:00] everything else but that's not the
[59:02] objective of the word of god the word
[59:06] never come to make us smarter never came
[59:09] to make us better it never came to make
[59:11] us intellectual god's not interested in
[59:14] our natural smarts if the objective of
[59:17] the word is to become a is to be alive
[59:20] and it would discern the very intents
[59:23] and thoughts of our heart and draw us
[59:25] into a place of relationship
[59:28] back here in that innermost part of our
[59:31] life to where god now sets down and
[59:34] resides in our life
[59:37] let me say this this out here
[59:40] this right here this is where brother
[59:42] branham could make the statement in
[59:44] these two courts out here that you can
[59:46] have the baptism of the holy ghost every
[59:49] day and every hour of your life and
[59:52] still be lost and go to hell
[59:54] because where it matters that holy ghost
[59:57] it's got to come in here to where it
[1:00:00] raises up a new man or a new woman on
[1:00:03] the inside
[1:00:08] hallelujah don't let that scare you
[1:00:10] enter right into that these are
[1:00:12] statements throughout the message don't
[1:00:14] let that scare you at all because the
[1:00:16] holy spirit coming here it must come to
[1:00:19] a place to where it's more than just we
[1:00:22] enjoy the word or more than where we're
[1:00:25] just out here in fellowship with the
[1:00:27] saints and maya go to this church and
[1:00:29] might go here and might feel so good but
[1:00:32] the same life continues out there that's
[1:00:34] not the objective of the gospel the
[1:00:37] gospel has come to bring a
[1:00:39] transformation in our life the weather
[1:00:42] you're here in church right here you're
[1:00:45] outside on friday on saturday or monday
[1:00:48] on tuesday and on wednesday you are a
[1:00:51] reflection of the presence of almighty
[1:00:54] god because your victory isn't that
[1:00:57] you're around brother samuel your
[1:00:59] victory isn't around well i'm around
[1:01:01] other believers your victory is i have
[1:01:04] met the lord jesus christ and i have
[1:01:07] received that victory on the inside and
[1:01:10] brother that victory can never be
[1:01:12] defeated it's never been defeated he
[1:01:15] triumphed over every prince power every
[1:01:18] devil every demon he rose up on that
[1:01:20] easter morning
[1:01:24] hallelujah
[1:01:25] you see now
[1:01:27] as we look at this here brothers go
[1:01:30] take that off if you don't mind for a
[1:01:32] moment
[1:01:33] thank you
[1:01:34] now i want to just refer to a few places
[1:01:36] here
[1:01:37] in acts chapter 7
[1:01:41] and i'm just for sake of time just let
[1:01:43] me
[1:01:44] reference here i don't want to skip
[1:01:45] around i don't want to there's times to
[1:01:47] preach evangelistic words just
[1:01:50] i don't want to do that
[1:01:52] i want to just i want to lay i want to
[1:01:54] lay these things in as god
[1:01:56] has laid them in
[1:01:58] you see here the burden
[1:02:00] in acts 7
[1:02:02] stephen picks this up he's
[1:02:04] announcing to them to those pharisees
[1:02:08] and here think of it here they are he's
[1:02:11] announcing to them
[1:02:13] the word that was prophesied
[1:02:16] stephen preached the word that hasn't
[1:02:19] has been fulfilled he reached back in
[1:02:22] there and pulled out the shadows and
[1:02:24] tights he brought it down to show
[1:02:28] that this was god's mind
[1:02:31] to come in flesh pay the price of
[1:02:35] redemption that then his own life could
[1:02:38] come back in and not just anoint us and
[1:02:42] leave and anoint us and leave but that
[1:02:44] he might come and abide
[1:02:48] in that place
[1:02:51] now you see when the word comes and
[1:02:52] deals with it
[1:02:54] when he is speaking to these people they
[1:02:56] got mad they were religious people they
[1:02:59] got mad the bible says they gnashed on
[1:03:02] him with their teeth
[1:03:06] what gnashes dogs nash
[1:03:10] come on now let's not mince words they
[1:03:12] gnashed on him because the word brought
[1:03:14] them to a showdown the word was exposing
[1:03:18] their phony religious forms and how that
[1:03:22] they had all this on the outside but
[1:03:24] they were full of dead men's vote you
[1:03:26] know what it was the same ministry that
[1:03:28] was there in the lord jesus that could
[1:03:31] charge him on the inside and said your
[1:03:33] heart's not right you do everything for
[1:03:36] a show everything is lighted up on the
[1:03:38] outside but inside you are full of dead
[1:03:41] men's bones this same holy ghost
[1:03:44] the same lord jesus now speaking through
[1:03:47] stephen was calling them out
[1:03:51] let me tell you what the best thing they
[1:03:52] could have done was said you know what
[1:03:54] as the word was dealing with their life
[1:03:56] and exposing their life the greatest
[1:03:58] thing they could have done is said lord
[1:04:00] have mercy on me
[1:04:01] lord have mercy on me instead of trying
[1:04:03] to take their position
[1:04:05] the greatest thing they could have done
[1:04:06] is said lord have mercy on me
[1:04:10] because the bible tells us like this
[1:04:12] none of them could withstand
[1:04:14] that of the presence of god that was
[1:04:16] moving through stephen
[1:04:18] the bible even said his face
[1:04:21] his countenance shone like that of an
[1:04:23] angel
[1:04:25] remember we looked at it two weeks ago
[1:04:26] when moses came off the mountain his
[1:04:28] face shone
[1:04:30] is that right he had received from god
[1:04:33] the word and here his face was was a
[1:04:37] glow with the glory of god here stephen
[1:04:40] was stephen wasn't carrying around two
[1:04:42] tables of stone it was now the living
[1:04:46] god the living word on the inside of
[1:04:48] stephen and that same shekinah glory
[1:04:51] that always the pillar fire always
[1:04:54] accompanies the word that same pillar of
[1:04:56] fire was right there with stephen and
[1:04:59] they the bible says that his countenance
[1:05:03] it's shown like that of an angel and
[1:05:06] they could not withstand the presence of
[1:05:09] god
[1:05:12] let me tell you something that's why it
[1:05:14] takes more than just flesh
[1:05:16] because this flesh would crumble this
[1:05:18] natural birth would crumble
[1:05:20] but that spiritual birth on the inside
[1:05:22] hey listen we might as well preach while
[1:05:23] we're here brother branham is standing
[1:05:25] right beside his daughter right beside
[1:05:27] his wife and here they go on the lord
[1:05:29] takes them on home and remember how the
[1:05:31] enemy he said he came right up next to
[1:05:33] me started saying all these things and
[1:05:35] brother brahma says even in his spirit
[1:05:37] he was agreeing with him he said the
[1:05:39] things that he was saying but he says i
[1:05:42] was about ready to say if that's how
[1:05:44] he's going to be talking about god he
[1:05:47] said that i'm not going to serve him but
[1:05:49] he said something rose up on the inside
[1:05:54] always said if that new birth hadn't
[1:05:56] been there that typos hadn't been there
[1:05:59] you know what that shows that there is
[1:06:01] one thing our flesh is defeatable our
[1:06:03] spirit is defeatable but the word cannot
[1:06:07] be defeated
[1:06:11] i'm talking about the word down on the
[1:06:13] inside of our soul
[1:06:16] destined trials can come and you feel
[1:06:18] like you're at your as the psalmist says
[1:06:20] at your wit's end
[1:06:23] but there's an anchor on the inside
[1:06:27] that holds you in the midst of the storm
[1:06:32] oh my
[1:06:35] i want you to catch how
[1:06:37] this was made known
[1:06:39] there in acts 7
[1:06:41] and stephen reaches back and he pulls
[1:06:43] out of isaiah 66.
[1:06:46] it speaks of how
[1:06:48] that you know moses built that
[1:06:50] tabernacle verse 46
[1:06:52] he goes on to say about david david had
[1:06:54] the desire who put that desire in david
[1:06:57] god did
[1:06:59] david didn't know he was the man for
[1:07:00] that he didn't even know that but when
[1:07:02] god revealed it
[1:07:03] it set motion in david's life
[1:07:06] is that right who found favor before god
[1:07:09] and desired to find a tabernacle for the
[1:07:11] god of jacob but solomon built him a
[1:07:13] house howbeit the most high dwelleth not
[1:07:16] in temples made with hands as saith the
[1:07:19] prophet heaven is my throne and earth is
[1:07:22] my footstool what house will ye build me
[1:07:25] saith the lord or what is the place of
[1:07:27] my wrath
[1:07:28] rest hath not my hand made all these
[1:07:31] things
[1:07:32] in the ephesian church age brother
[1:07:33] braham said man was created for god
[1:07:37] man was to be the temple of god the
[1:07:40] place of god's rest the holy spirit was
[1:07:42] man the temple
[1:07:44] in second corinthians 6 and verse 16
[1:07:48] as it would speak here and we recognize
[1:07:51] paul would pick this up what agreement
[1:07:53] hath the temple of god with idols for ye
[1:07:55] are the temple of the living god as god
[1:07:58] has said i will dwell in them walk in
[1:08:00] them i will be their god and they shall
[1:08:03] be my
[1:08:05] people
[1:08:06] wherefore come out from among them and
[1:08:08] be you separate saith the lord and touch
[1:08:10] not the unclean thing and i will receive
[1:08:13] you you see what the word does the word
[1:08:16] calls for separation and consecration
[1:08:21] see as we move through those courts
[1:08:24] from the outer court to the inner court
[1:08:26] it moving in a time of consecration
[1:08:32] this is where it moves us in a time of
[1:08:36] consecration matter of fact the holy
[1:08:38] place itself that second chord that's a
[1:08:41] real place of consecration right there
[1:08:44] that place not coming into that of
[1:08:47] consecration it then it leads us into a
[1:08:52] life of consecration
[1:08:55] did you hear me
[1:08:56] from a place of consecration to a life
[1:08:59] of consecration
[1:09:02] that's what the working of the holy
[1:09:04] spirit does in our life it calls us from
[1:09:07] separate and to consecrate ourselves
[1:09:10] unto god let me just say this if you
[1:09:12] don't separate and consecrate you'll get
[1:09:14] no further with god
[1:09:17] and i don't care how long you've been
[1:09:18] sitting here i don't care how long if
[1:09:20] you don't consecrate your life to god
[1:09:22] you'll get no further
[1:09:25] and it ain't like you've got a
[1:09:26] placeholder or a place marker you either
[1:09:28] go forward or you're going backward
[1:09:32] preach brother samuel thank you i will
[1:09:34] you're not going to stay the same you're
[1:09:37] either going forward or you're going
[1:09:39] backward
[1:09:40] that's what they call backsliding
[1:09:44] come on now
[1:09:45] you see this is where we want we want to
[1:09:47] continue to move forward in the things
[1:09:50] of god there are things that god is
[1:09:52] dealing with even in our life right now
[1:09:54] to deal with a greater consecration in
[1:09:57] our life little things that need to be
[1:09:59] straightened up you say oh brother
[1:10:01] samuel god don't care about little
[1:10:02] things really
[1:10:04] the bible says in the book of zechariah
[1:10:07] that this would be a day that people
[1:10:09] would despise small things brother
[1:10:12] branham would pick it up there and
[1:10:13] question answers on the seals and he
[1:10:15] said people look at all this other about
[1:10:17] cutting hair and this and that all
[1:10:19] that's not all necessary and you know
[1:10:21] being in the house of god brother brown
[1:10:22] goes into that he says but he said
[1:10:25] remember if you can't obey it in the
[1:10:27] little things god will never reveal it
[1:10:31] in the other things
[1:10:34] you see because whatever god reveals he
[1:10:36] reveals
[1:10:38] are you hearing me what he reveals he
[1:10:40] reveals
[1:10:41] god doesn't reveal something here and
[1:10:43] then it's like sealed up right here oh
[1:10:45] no no god hiding
[1:10:48] in simplicity right
[1:10:50] and revealing himself
[1:10:53] through the same
[1:10:54] so the revelation to well i've got the
[1:10:56] revelation but but you don't see it in
[1:10:58] my life no the revelation it flows
[1:11:01] through our life to conduct our lives
[1:11:06] this is not a church fire this is holy
[1:11:08] ghost fire
[1:11:10] [Applause]
[1:11:11] [Laughter]
[1:11:12] glory be to god in the highest
[1:11:15] oh my notice this come out from among
[1:11:18] them and be you separate saith the lord
[1:11:20] and touch not the unclean thing and i
[1:11:22] will receive you see god will deal with
[1:11:24] the life as they're coming in get rid of
[1:11:26] this get rid of that stop doing this
[1:11:29] stop doing that god ain't trying to pick
[1:11:31] on anybody god's desire is to come and
[1:11:34] dwell on the inside of you and listen
[1:11:37] god is not going to habitate with a
[1:11:39] sinful nature
[1:11:42] it's got to be a life that's cleaned up
[1:11:45] and made ready and consecrated for him
[1:11:52] we
[1:11:55] oh my
[1:11:56] i will be a father unto you and you
[1:11:58] shall be my sons and daughters saith the
[1:12:00] lord
[1:12:01] almighty now i want you to catch how
[1:12:05] moses
[1:12:06] he built this tabernacle from the
[1:12:08] heavenly pattern is that right
[1:12:10] then he was caught up
[1:12:12] and god revealed to him
[1:12:16] his desire
[1:12:18] of the tabernacle which was was the type
[1:12:21] of god's desire now to come back and
[1:12:24] redemption and come and dwell in man
[1:12:28] god revealed this to moses this was not
[1:12:31] an earthly vision
[1:12:33] moses didn't get this from egypt
[1:12:36] but he was caught up and god revealed to
[1:12:39] him the heavenly pattern
[1:12:42] i hope you're hearing me
[1:12:43] the material was already on earth
[1:12:47] brother branham said in marriage of the
[1:12:49] lamb i think brother darrell quoted last
[1:12:50] week in 1962 we have the material on
[1:12:54] earth now
[1:12:56] to make the bride ready what was being
[1:12:58] received there in sabino canyon the
[1:13:01] pattern was revealed back into the
[1:13:05] holiest of holies
[1:13:08] oh my so it's a pattern because if god
[1:13:10] didn't bring down there's not more holy
[1:13:12] ghost it's the same holy ghost that now
[1:13:14] has always been here the god that always
[1:13:17] was now that same god the veil is taken
[1:13:20] off of him
[1:13:21] is that right that's what the whole
[1:13:23] ministry of brother branham this is the
[1:13:25] ministry brother and sister one of the
[1:13:27] parts is to declare when you see the
[1:13:30] healings taking place the discernment
[1:13:32] that was to announce this same jesus is
[1:13:36] alive and well
[1:13:39] that's what brother brahma could say the
[1:13:41] purpose of my ministry is to announce he
[1:13:44] is now here
[1:13:47] deserving of spirit 1960 he said that's
[1:13:50] what all hell is against is the
[1:13:52] spiritual revelation that christ is here
[1:13:56] right now
[1:14:01] hallelujah
[1:14:04] oh my so
[1:14:05] solomon you know he solomon built
[1:14:08] the the the the the tabernacle solomon
[1:14:11] took by the same pattern that god gave
[1:14:14] moses and by the spirit
[1:14:17] he built that tabernacle we read about
[1:14:20] but i want you to notice this was only a
[1:14:22] type
[1:14:23] of the true tabernacle
[1:14:25] it was only a type
[1:14:27] because
[1:14:29] when this true tabernacle was pitched
[1:14:32] you could look the bible says in isaiah
[1:14:34] 53 there was no beauty that we should
[1:14:37] desire him
[1:14:39] let me just say it and i'm not saying
[1:14:41] this to be funny or that jesus would
[1:14:43] have not been on a gq magazine
[1:14:46] just to put it in perspective
[1:14:49] that when he stood before the pharisees
[1:14:51] they looked at him and said
[1:14:53] you're not a man more than 50 years old
[1:14:55] he wasn't but a few days over 30 years
[1:14:58] old
[1:15:00] he looked older because of the burden
[1:15:03] and hound that he had come through that
[1:15:05] of the woman yet it was a creation of
[1:15:06] god are you with me
[1:15:08] god coming down and god pitched that
[1:15:11] tabernacle mary didn't pitch that
[1:15:13] tabernacle
[1:15:15] god borrowed the womb this is the
[1:15:17] creation of god this is god creating
[1:15:21] himself a part of his own creation
[1:15:25] come on now
[1:15:27] how did god come down and god supplied
[1:15:30] both egg and sperm it was god himself
[1:15:33] that created a body for himself to come
[1:15:36] and dwell in you know what god was
[1:15:38] showing this is my pattern my pattern is
[1:15:42] that my children who are the word will
[1:15:44] be borne of the word
[1:15:47] amen i'll bring them back to myself
[1:15:49] they'll hear the call of my voice my
[1:15:52] sheep know my voice
[1:15:54] amen and a stranger they'll not follow
[1:15:59] this is why think back to what brother
[1:16:01] jerry preached here the very first
[1:16:02] service when he was here in july the
[1:16:04] favor of god quit wondering oh you know
[1:16:07] i've got god's favor i'm asking you as
[1:16:09] god spoke to you
[1:16:12] if god has spoken to you what should i
[1:16:14] do brother samuel i'll tell you what i'd
[1:16:16] do i'd start throwing wood in that fire
[1:16:21] come on now
[1:16:22] i'd get that fire blazing so hard what
[1:16:25] would i do i'd lay in that word i'd a
[1:16:28] man that word i'd get myself in that
[1:16:30] word because god has spoke to me let me
[1:16:33] tell you what god's speaking to you does
[1:16:35] it silences every other voice of doubt
[1:16:38] for god has spoken who can but prophesy
[1:16:42] i tell you what you need to do is yield
[1:16:45] to the voice of god
[1:16:47] [Applause]
[1:16:49] don't just walk out of church
[1:16:52] man praise god i got god's favor and
[1:16:54] then here it is
[1:16:56] it looks like
[1:16:57] i hope it's all right
[1:16:59] my wife you know i tell you them
[1:17:01] mosquitoes have been horrible this year
[1:17:04] i like setting out at night
[1:17:08] about the third round of coffee of the
[1:17:10] day
[1:17:11] i like setting out at night
[1:17:13] but their mosquitoes have been about all
[1:17:15] i can take
[1:17:16] what'd you do sip and swat because i
[1:17:19] want to sit outside
[1:17:20] my wife she said honey she said i bought
[1:17:22] you some of these little citronella
[1:17:24] things that can be put out there them
[1:17:25] things were teacups
[1:17:28] you know them little tea lights
[1:17:32] i mean that mosquitoes was coming by
[1:17:34] them and getting warmed and coming over
[1:17:35] and biting me
[1:17:41] a little cold i gotta warm my wings now
[1:17:43] i'm ready
[1:17:47] so
[1:17:48] you see them little them little little
[1:17:50] tea lights them little things on there
[1:17:53] i mean we could have had them all around
[1:17:54] the patio them things weren't doing a
[1:17:56] bit of good
[1:17:59] i don't know but eventually you know we
[1:18:01] had got one of these others that we
[1:18:03] found you know on just a simple one made
[1:18:05] by i think off or something like that
[1:18:06] and put it on there but my point is is
[1:18:08] that that itself had bigger flames
[1:18:11] you don't want to if you're in here and
[1:18:13] you've got a little tea light don't walk
[1:18:16] out of here and say well i'll tell you
[1:18:17] what glory to god i got a little tea
[1:18:18] light how about trading in the tea life
[1:18:21] how about laying in the word and saying
[1:18:23] we're going to get this fire going so
[1:18:25] hot buddy it will cause the irradiating
[1:18:29] of the smoke it'll keep away every one
[1:18:32] of the foul spirits and demons of doubt
[1:18:35] what should i do i bury myself in the
[1:18:38] things of almighty god
[1:18:41] media friends the reason that we get
[1:18:44] down so much is because we forsake our
[1:18:46] own mercies brother samuel there's time
[1:18:48] i'm just off the notes and we're going
[1:18:50] to go
[1:18:51] there's times brother samuel that i feel
[1:18:53] down or i don't feel like this or i
[1:18:55] don't feel like that join the party
[1:18:58] there's many times all throughout that
[1:19:00] we don't feel like but what must i do
[1:19:03] well brother samuel i don't feel like
[1:19:04] i'm getting anything when i put that
[1:19:06] message on put it on anyhow
[1:19:10] play it anyhow put it on in the car pray
[1:19:14] anyhow i feel like my prayers are going
[1:19:16] up and bouncing off the ceiling let them
[1:19:18] bounce off the ceiling they're not
[1:19:20] bouncing off the ceiling do it anyhow
[1:19:23] you say what are y'all what am i doing
[1:19:25] you're standing there with a real
[1:19:27] testimony that though i don't feel it
[1:19:29] though i don't see anything but i know
[1:19:32] this word has an effect on my life
[1:19:38] i'm talking about living inside of the
[1:19:40] interval
[1:19:46] my my mind you see god
[1:19:48] god told them
[1:19:50] let them make me a sanctuary that i may
[1:19:52] dwell among them
[1:19:54] he told them in exodus 25 9
[1:19:56] i want you to do it according to the
[1:19:58] pattern now i know i'm moving a little
[1:19:59] quick here according to all the pattern
[1:20:01] that i show you
[1:20:03] now the very first thing when god asked
[1:20:05] them
[1:20:06] i want to let them make me a sanctuary
[1:20:09] god said i'm there to do it after the
[1:20:11] pattern that i show them
[1:20:14] now what if you'd had somebody in there
[1:20:16] that said
[1:20:18] i think this would look better like this
[1:20:24] what would happen
[1:20:26] he wouldn't have come
[1:20:28] because when he came
[1:20:30] when the tabernacle was finished when he
[1:20:32] came that was him declaring the
[1:20:35] revelation that was given
[1:20:37] has now come into manifestation
[1:20:39] according to my pattern
[1:20:42] that's the same way the holy ghost comes
[1:20:44] in a life it's coming according to the
[1:20:46] pattern of the word but you see if man
[1:20:47] alters that word
[1:20:49] well all you got to do is just just
[1:20:51] believe that jesus christ was the son of
[1:20:53] god
[1:20:55] but that life
[1:20:56] in him came to dismantle the hold of the
[1:21:00] enemy
[1:21:01] that's part of the truth but that ain't
[1:21:03] all the truth
[1:21:05] is that right
[1:21:06] amen that's like getting a piece of
[1:21:08] apple pie and you eat the first one so
[1:21:09] you can get to the second one you know
[1:21:11] and you get you you eat that first one
[1:21:13] you know well there's more where that
[1:21:14] come from
[1:21:16] is that right
[1:21:18] i know that's a little carnal but it'll
[1:21:19] get the point across
[1:21:21] but i want you to notice what god begin
[1:21:22] with first on this tabernacle
[1:21:25] the very next verse they shall make an
[1:21:27] ark
[1:21:29] god never dealt with
[1:21:32] all the outside parts
[1:21:35] well they need to
[1:21:37] do this on the outside the white abyss
[1:21:39] and need to have you know the the wood
[1:21:41] on the outside you know dipped on the
[1:21:43] bottom in the in the braze and you know
[1:21:44] for walking the brazen judgment of god
[1:21:47] and
[1:21:48] god didn't work on the outside first
[1:21:50] god was letting them know
[1:21:52] it's got to start on the principle part
[1:21:56] the inside
[1:21:58] that's what the holy spirit comes to
[1:22:00] deal with
[1:22:02] the inside
[1:22:03] you see friends this is why we can get
[1:22:05] the outside right
[1:22:07] where everything on the outside man whoo
[1:22:10] glory to god they're a message believer
[1:22:13] that can be conformity
[1:22:16] are you hearing me
[1:22:18] that can be conformity oh they know
[1:22:20] everything right down to the line
[1:22:22] remember
[1:22:23] inside of that holy place
[1:22:25] this is where when the holy ghost don't
[1:22:27] get all the way down to the inside and
[1:22:29] bring about a change this is where you
[1:22:31] find critical spirits
[1:22:33] preach somebody
[1:22:35] unstable people
[1:22:37] i'm going to preach
[1:22:39] it gets to the inside arguing doctrine
[1:22:41] when i disagree with you and i disagree
[1:22:42] and everything drawn fences why they've
[1:22:44] never went deep enough to be born again
[1:22:48] that's why the token hear me now hear me
[1:22:51] clear that's why the token is just more
[1:22:53] than you got the right kind of dress on
[1:22:56] are you hearing me if you get the holy
[1:22:58] ghost on the inside it'll show on the
[1:23:01] outside
[1:23:03] but you can have everything right on the
[1:23:05] outside and still be unconverted on the
[1:23:09] inside
[1:23:10] [Applause]
[1:23:11] you might fool a lot of people
[1:23:14] but god will let situations come up
[1:23:17] listen god don't do that to shame nobody
[1:23:20] there's things that god allows to come
[1:23:22] up well i look at as it's the mercy of
[1:23:24] god so that that person can recognize i
[1:23:27] haven't went deep enough i need a deeper
[1:23:30] walk with jesus christ
[1:23:33] but if you don't heed to the spirit you
[1:23:35] can stand right there in the seven
[1:23:36] golden candlesticks and make every
[1:23:39] excuse in the book of why you can't live
[1:23:41] an overcoming life why i can't do this
[1:23:43] and i can't do that god will never
[1:23:46] accept our excuses but god will accept
[1:23:49] if we can say lord i need to go deeper
[1:23:51] lord jesus take me deeper lord and i'll
[1:23:54] tell you right now as a child of god i
[1:23:57] want to go deeper i want to go deeper in
[1:24:00] him i want to be more like him
[1:24:09] this testimony
[1:24:13] i said i wasn't going to preach like
[1:24:15] evangelistic but i'll tell you that
[1:24:16] motor's kicking today
[1:24:20] i actually prefer the other gear
[1:24:22] but remember the ark
[1:24:24] god told moses the testimony that i give
[1:24:27] you
[1:24:28] this i want you to put it in the ark all
[1:24:31] the commandments
[1:24:32] i want you to put it inside
[1:24:35] of this ark so it now becomes the ark of
[1:24:38] the testimony
[1:24:39] this is where the heart of an individual
[1:24:42] see that little part the bible says in
[1:24:45] the book of proverbs as a man thinketh
[1:24:46] in his heart so is he
[1:24:49] is that right
[1:24:50] the little part brother branson remember
[1:24:52] he said science was criticizing us said
[1:24:54] oh you know uh there's you know that
[1:24:56] scripture is all wrong
[1:24:58] a man thinketh in his heart but brahm
[1:25:00] said he said now science has found out
[1:25:02] there's a little space right there in
[1:25:03] the heart a little a little part where
[1:25:05] there's nothing that's right there he
[1:25:07] said that's the soul
[1:25:09] you see the soul is the nature
[1:25:12] if the nature never gets changed
[1:25:15] dandelions keep growing back
[1:25:19] because the root of the problem is that
[1:25:22] sin nature
[1:25:24] are you with me now this is why god
[1:25:28] works from the inside
[1:25:30] out in our life
[1:25:32] so i want you to look at this here just
[1:25:34] for a moment because see whatever's on
[1:25:36] the inside will reflect itself on the
[1:25:39] outside um
[1:25:40] i don't know who's back there right now
[1:25:41] running them slides but can you go me
[1:25:44] knock me knock me back into the slide
[1:25:45] here just for a moment click it back
[1:25:47] this uh that tabernacle sorry
[1:25:51] i want you to look at this here to get
[1:25:52] my glasses on
[1:25:56] you see this right here
[1:25:58] i want you to look at this
[1:26:00] you see these colors right here
[1:26:03] that right there
[1:26:04] is leads into the holy place
[1:26:07] now i don't have here on my screen but
[1:26:08] the veil that leads into the whole list
[1:26:10] of holies it has the same colors this
[1:26:13] has the same colors
[1:26:16] you know what all them colors are they
[1:26:17] are colors all four colors that
[1:26:20] represent christ
[1:26:23] the foreign living creatures they
[1:26:25] represent the life the nature of jesus
[1:26:28] christ
[1:26:29] the holy ghost are you hearing me this
[1:26:31] is why that this is why
[1:26:33] that that when the holy ghost remember
[1:26:35] he comes and he descends here into the
[1:26:38] most holy place what does it do it
[1:26:40] reflects itself
[1:26:42] from the inside to the outside that's
[1:26:45] what the seal or the token of the
[1:26:48] baptism of the holy ghost does it ain't
[1:26:50] just something where somebody can look
[1:26:52] at you and you say well i'm a christian
[1:26:53] i'm a christian yeah i really am i'm a
[1:26:55] real message believer but you see
[1:26:57] there's a presence that accompanies your
[1:26:59] life it not only reflects itself in the
[1:27:02] way we conduct ourselves in the way that
[1:27:04] we dress but it reflects itself in the
[1:27:07] faithfulness of the faithful one who has
[1:27:10] come to make us faithful amen
[1:27:13] are you hearing me
[1:27:16] it must reflect itself so it's gotten
[1:27:18] there if something's being shown on the
[1:27:21] outside that's different from the inside
[1:27:23] we do not handle and say well that's
[1:27:26] just my flesh that's an excuse
[1:27:29] that's been used as an excuse too many
[1:27:32] times
[1:27:33] it's true we've got to bring that
[1:27:34] outside man in subjection but many times
[1:27:37] that has been an excuse for an
[1:27:40] unconverted life
[1:27:43] come on now i'm going to preach
[1:27:45] brother brown will take romans 7 and
[1:27:46] he'll deal with romans 7. he'll deal
[1:27:48] with it in a manner to where you have
[1:27:50] those that are converted and how you
[1:27:52] know how it is we're just preaching
[1:27:53] moments ago you deal with times there's
[1:27:56] a battle at times to pray there's a
[1:27:58] battle at times to read there's a battle
[1:28:00] at times to come to the house of god
[1:28:02] and things are always convenient
[1:28:04] remember brother rahm talked about that
[1:28:06] oh his stroke got a little scratchy and
[1:28:08] he said the flesh told me just call up
[1:28:10] brother neville and say brother neville
[1:28:12] i can't do it tonight but brother
[1:28:14] branham said i will not do that i gave
[1:28:17] him my word that i was going to preach
[1:28:19] tonight i'm going to be there
[1:28:23] let me just tell you something that's
[1:28:25] what this message produces
[1:28:28] [Applause]
[1:28:30] that's what this message produces
[1:28:32] this message is not a knife cutting and
[1:28:35] slicing up here and you're like
[1:28:36] wow what a demonstration wow that's a
[1:28:38] sharp knife no it produces the same
[1:28:41] sharpness in our life
[1:28:43] this ain't no gimmick where it's cutting
[1:28:45] up here and man the power of god that
[1:28:47] isn't it's not a gimmick where all of a
[1:28:49] sudden then you buy the knives after the
[1:28:51] demonstration and they won't even cut
[1:28:53] the fuzz off a peach
[1:28:55] come on now you know what i'm talking
[1:28:57] about oh by these knives right over here
[1:28:59] everybody just step right up make room
[1:29:01] right up here we're going to let you
[1:29:03] we're going to demonstrate these knives
[1:29:05] and you get the knives and you wonder
[1:29:06] did i get the fisher price set or did i
[1:29:09] get the same manufacturer they got let
[1:29:11] me tell you something the holy ghost
[1:29:13] that does the ministering right here and
[1:29:15] reflects it is the same holy ghost that
[1:29:18] moves down into your life he'll come
[1:29:20] with the same sharpness same authority
[1:29:22] same power same glory
[1:29:29] oh my brother brian
[1:29:31] kick me back to the just take that off
[1:29:33] please
[1:29:36] here and i want you to notice what david
[1:29:37] said in psalms 86 11. everybody all
[1:29:39] right
[1:29:42] now if you're saying
[1:29:43] i'm all right it's all right it does
[1:29:45] good
[1:29:46] psalm 86 11 teach me thy way oh lord now
[1:29:50] this is david i will walk in thy truth
[1:29:53] unite my heart to fear thy name
[1:29:57] this is david remember david speaking
[1:30:00] unto the spirit of christ
[1:30:02] this is a prophetic
[1:30:04] a request a desire
[1:30:08] this could not happen in the days of
[1:30:10] david
[1:30:12] just like the other messianic psalms
[1:30:14] it couldn't happen in the days of it but
[1:30:16] it was the spirit of christ showing
[1:30:18] that there would be a people that would
[1:30:20] come in line with the same holy spirit
[1:30:23] that spoke through david
[1:30:25] that in this hour would come under the
[1:30:27] unction to be united with jesus christ
[1:30:31] is that right
[1:30:32] and now how god would have the prophet
[1:30:35] picks this up in the message uniting
[1:30:37] time and sign to show now is the time
[1:30:40] now is the season for the bride herself
[1:30:43] is standing on her feet now for her to
[1:30:45] be united with jesus christ notice unite
[1:30:49] my heart
[1:30:51] to fear thy name not not my mind
[1:30:55] not my body
[1:30:57] my heart amen
[1:30:59] to do what fear thy name what's fear
[1:31:01] reverence
[1:31:02] this is not fear of oh i wonder who's
[1:31:05] watching me
[1:31:07] no this is re fear the fear of the lord
[1:31:09] the bible said is clean
[1:31:11] amen all right
[1:31:13] amen i mean this isn't the fake stuff
[1:31:15] these guys riding around with no fear
[1:31:18] yeah right
[1:31:20] yeah right
[1:31:23] i mean anybody tells you from a police
[1:31:25] officer or whatever more they'll tell
[1:31:26] you at times when they go into certain
[1:31:28] things like that there's an adrenaline
[1:31:29] that kicks in
[1:31:32] to help them and keep them during that
[1:31:33] time it is a way that god has made even
[1:31:36] in the body
[1:31:37] are you hearing me
[1:31:39] so you you recognize some of that part
[1:31:41] right there
[1:31:41] so when we look at this the fear of the
[1:31:43] lord is clean it's not a slavish fear
[1:31:46] but but david said unite my heart to
[1:31:48] fear thy name to reverence thy name in
[1:31:51] psalms 119 11 thy word have i hid in
[1:31:54] mine heart that i might not sin against
[1:31:58] thee
[1:31:59] now i want you i want to remind you
[1:32:01] david here was in a time remember he
[1:32:04] could say take not thou
[1:32:06] uh holy spirit from me
[1:32:08] because
[1:32:10] david did not and could not experience
[1:32:14] the new birth
[1:32:16] because there had to come the
[1:32:19] perpetuation of calvary
[1:32:22] the bible said he shall make his soul an
[1:32:24] offering for sin
[1:32:26] so david could hide the word into his
[1:32:28] heart we don't do this and we don't do
[1:32:30] that and david loved the word david said
[1:32:32] i love the word i love the law it's like
[1:32:34] honey in my mouth he loved it
[1:32:36] but you see even though david had hid
[1:32:38] the word in his heart it didn't keep him
[1:32:41] from an adulterous spirit getting a hold
[1:32:42] of him
[1:32:44] are you going to preach with me now
[1:32:46] they said you couldn't you can't look at
[1:32:47] and say well my you know david hall he
[1:32:50] must not love the lord no he loved the
[1:32:51] lord brother bram tells us in that outer
[1:32:53] court just in the body a person can love
[1:32:56] god you say how can that be possible
[1:32:59] because it's filial love
[1:33:03] agape love comes
[1:33:06] with the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:33:09] a person can love god love the things
[1:33:11] about god that's why a person can my
[1:33:14] love you know and this is why sometimes
[1:33:15] people get around the message and the
[1:33:17] reason that they really like the message
[1:33:18] it's not revealed to them but they just
[1:33:20] look at it it's like it's oh boy it's
[1:33:22] something that's really after that roman
[1:33:24] catholic church and man it really
[1:33:25] exposes the government
[1:33:27] those were the kind of people
[1:33:29] unless god changes them they wore the
[1:33:31] tie-dye shirts and the flip-flops back
[1:33:34] in the 60s
[1:33:36] are you hearing me
[1:33:38] they were hippies there they're hippies
[1:33:39] here
[1:33:41] brother sam you preaching straight it's
[1:33:42] because they never got a converted
[1:33:45] nature that's why people can take the
[1:33:48] scriptures and take the message and try
[1:33:50] to validate their own sinful life
[1:33:57] come on now but you can't make the word
[1:33:59] validate a sinful life
[1:34:03] people have their pet peeve quotes and
[1:34:05] everything else but it's time to take
[1:34:07] all the word of god and if there's a
[1:34:09] part that takes off our hide the bride
[1:34:11] of jesus christ raises up and says amen
[1:34:15] to the word of god
[1:34:17] because it's in every word that's going
[1:34:19] to get us out of here at the end of the
[1:34:21] book in revelations 22
[1:34:23] john was commissioned by the angel that
[1:34:26] was revealing it still it not it's a
[1:34:29] time to speak these things out and
[1:34:31] whosoever takes away from this word or
[1:34:33] adds to it his part will be taken out of
[1:34:36] the book of life
[1:34:41] this is why it's very important here
[1:34:43] and i don't believe i'm talking to
[1:34:44] people this morning
[1:34:46] that want to go around and make excuses
[1:34:48] and put blame on everybody else well if
[1:34:50] so and so didn't do this i wouldn't act
[1:34:52] like this the reality is you act like
[1:34:54] that because there's something inside of
[1:34:56] you
[1:34:59] the problem is you're still blaming
[1:35:01] everybody else
[1:35:03] come on friends
[1:35:04] see this is where people can rest right
[1:35:06] in that spirit realm and brother brown
[1:35:08] says it in the message images of christ
[1:35:10] he said you hear somebody always making
[1:35:12] a lot of noise he said that's a sick
[1:35:14] person
[1:35:15] come on images of christ they're always
[1:35:17] making a lot of noise chatter about this
[1:35:19] talking about that going around behind
[1:35:21] this one's back going around that that's
[1:35:23] a spiritually sick person you know what
[1:35:25] the problem is they need the baptism of
[1:35:27] the holy ghost
[1:35:29] preach brother samuel i think i will
[1:35:32] these are exact quotes right here but
[1:35:34] you see when it comes to it oh brother
[1:35:36] samuel me or listen this is what i would
[1:35:38] do i would do and i'll tell you how i do
[1:35:40] i want to look in that word and when i
[1:35:42] see something not lining up with that
[1:35:44] word it smites my heart
[1:35:48] god help me to line up to that lord
[1:35:50] forgive me why because that is the
[1:35:53] caliber of the bride of jesus christ
[1:35:56] we're not here to make exceptions we're
[1:35:58] not here to give satan any room or any
[1:36:01] place we want to be testimonies of the
[1:36:05] fire of almighty god
[1:36:11] psalm 16 11.
[1:36:13] look what david said prophesying thou
[1:36:16] wilt this is a resurrection psalm
[1:36:19] this is a psalm speaking of the
[1:36:21] resurrection the suffering and
[1:36:22] resurrection of the lord jesus christ
[1:36:24] thou wilt
[1:36:26] show me the path of life
[1:36:29] it might be gloomy but in the evening
[1:36:31] time
[1:36:32] there shall be light
[1:36:35] in the evening time
[1:36:36] the path to glory you shall surely find
[1:36:40] in thy presence is fullness of joy
[1:36:43] at thy right hand there are pleasures
[1:36:45] forevermore
[1:36:48] now let me just let me just bring this
[1:36:49] down here
[1:36:51] and
[1:36:57] in hebrews 10 i read this closing out
[1:36:59] last time to you and i just
[1:37:01] i want to refer to this here
[1:37:04] they want to get us to to a certain spot
[1:37:08] and i do just just just just even in our
[1:37:11] in your heart right now say lord help me
[1:37:12] to really be attentive right here
[1:37:15] just to lay this lay this part in
[1:37:17] god declared all the way from in
[1:37:19] jeremiah this was spoke in ezekiel this
[1:37:22] was spoke and here paul reaches back
[1:37:26] by the spirit of god and picks up
[1:37:28] and announces
[1:37:30] what has taken place for you and i
[1:37:33] for by one offering hebrews 10 14 he
[1:37:36] hath perfected forever them
[1:37:39] that are sanctified
[1:37:42] this
[1:37:43] offering
[1:37:45] the offering was the perfect
[1:37:48] supreme sacrifice
[1:37:51] that then through that sacrifice and the
[1:37:54] dealing of the holy spirit to bring us
[1:37:56] into that place
[1:37:58] of union with him
[1:38:00] to where united in our hearts
[1:38:04] is perfected forever
[1:38:07] there's no going back
[1:38:10] there's no going back
[1:38:12] wherefore the holy ghost also is a
[1:38:13] witness to us for after that he had said
[1:38:16] this is the covenant that i will make
[1:38:18] with them after those days saith the
[1:38:20] lord i will put my laws into their minds
[1:38:22] and
[1:38:23] into their hearts and in their minds
[1:38:25] will i write them praise the lord
[1:38:28] hey there used to be different things in
[1:38:30] your heart
[1:38:32] and in my heart
[1:38:34] right right and and it came out
[1:38:37] that's why brother baby talking about
[1:38:38] his children and come follow me there he
[1:38:40] said or any he said you can take any he
[1:38:42] said the good children he said
[1:38:43] whatever's in him he said i don't care
[1:38:44] if you put them in a remote wilderness
[1:38:45] whatever zen is going to come out
[1:38:47] whether you put them in a high school
[1:38:48] here or you put them out there
[1:38:49] whatever's in i'm going to come out
[1:38:51] is that right
[1:38:53] because really
[1:38:55] really really it's who we are when
[1:38:56] nobody else is watching amen
[1:38:59] are you with me
[1:39:01] oh my oh my my mama i will put my laws
[1:39:04] into their hearts and in their minds
[1:39:06] will i write them well remember
[1:39:09] remember in ezekiel 36 i'm kind of
[1:39:11] moving around a little bit but remember
[1:39:12] in ezekiel 36 sister roseanne are you
[1:39:14] controlling that can you move down to
[1:39:16] ezekiel 36 it's down there a bit but if
[1:39:18] you can get down there i'd greatly
[1:39:20] appreciate that
[1:39:28] yeah there we go
[1:39:30] a new heart also will i give you and a
[1:39:32] new spirit will i put within you
[1:39:35] wow
[1:39:37] well i need a new heart sure you did
[1:39:40] sure we did
[1:39:42] and we need we needed a new heart and a
[1:39:43] new spirit because what we had we
[1:39:45] couldn't even get along with ourselves
[1:39:46] much less anybody else or god
[1:39:49] you understand what i'm saying you could
[1:39:51] set but then when god begins to deal
[1:39:53] with the heart a new heart and new
[1:39:55] spirit this is where many times where
[1:39:57] people stop with a new heart and a new
[1:40:00] spirit a new way of thinking they begin
[1:40:02] to look at the word the word looks
[1:40:04] simple man i like this i enjoy this and
[1:40:06] they've repented and maybe they've won
[1:40:08] they walked on in you know the water
[1:40:09] baptism and there's come a
[1:40:10] sanctification about their life and my
[1:40:13] goodness they're they're looking and say
[1:40:14] man i don't have the same you know
[1:40:17] these desires and things that i used to
[1:40:18] have i don't have that no more but
[1:40:20] remember there is a further
[1:40:23] work of the holy ghost
[1:40:25] all of that was a process that he might
[1:40:28] come and indwell our life
[1:40:33] so there's got to come about a change he
[1:40:35] said i'll give you a new heart i'll give
[1:40:37] you a new spirit
[1:40:39] and i will take away glory be to god the
[1:40:42] stony heart out of your flesh and i'll
[1:40:44] give you a heart of flesh
[1:40:46] you know why because god when he wrote
[1:40:48] those commandments he wrote them on
[1:40:50] tables of stone
[1:40:52] but nobody can ever live them on tables
[1:40:54] of stone
[1:40:56] but it had to come by the work of the
[1:40:59] holy ghost that could draw you and i
[1:41:01] into a place to where you might have set
[1:41:04] you might have lived your life for so
[1:41:06] many years and the holy spirit begins to
[1:41:08] deal with your heart bring conviction to
[1:41:10] your life begin to show your life where
[1:41:13] would you be and it begins to deal with
[1:41:15] your heart this is who i made you to be
[1:41:18] and that's why you can't feel
[1:41:19] comfortable in the world anymore why
[1:41:22] because the holy spirit is desiring to
[1:41:25] reconcile you
[1:41:27] to himself
[1:41:32] he got to do he's got to dismantle that
[1:41:33] stony heart
[1:41:35] that's a supernatural work are you
[1:41:37] hearing me
[1:41:38] that's a supernatural word that's a work
[1:41:40] of the holy ghost making way for the
[1:41:43] holy ghost himself
[1:41:46] hallelujah
[1:41:47] and i look at this
[1:41:49] and i will put my spirit
[1:41:52] within you
[1:41:54] and cause you
[1:41:56] to walk in my
[1:41:58] statutes and shall keep my judgments
[1:42:02] and do them
[1:42:05] this is exactly
[1:42:07] what was being spoken of right up here
[1:42:10] in the in the bible in hebrews 10 we are
[1:42:12] reading
[1:42:13] where god said i will write my laws
[1:42:16] in your heart and in your mind and verse
[1:42:19] 17 and hebrews 10 17 and their sins and
[1:42:22] iniquities will i remember no more now
[1:42:24] where remission of these is there's no
[1:42:26] more offering for sin
[1:42:33] because
[1:42:34] the debt not only has the debt been paid
[1:42:37] but it's been made real to you
[1:42:42] that old nature has has died
[1:42:45] and there's a new man on the inside
[1:42:48] now but samuel are you are you saying
[1:42:50] that we don't still have to repent oh no
[1:42:52] we we die daily
[1:42:55] you understand me we die daily
[1:42:58] it's daily bringing this outside man
[1:43:01] into subjection
[1:43:03] to the what's on the inside
[1:43:06] can i have a few more moments thank you
[1:43:08] thank you
[1:43:12] second corinthians 3 17
[1:43:18] now the lord is that spirit look at this
[1:43:20] word
[1:43:21] and where the spirit of the lord is
[1:43:25] there is what
[1:43:29] now i don't only believe
[1:43:31] that that's to be in the house of god
[1:43:33] but this scripture is speaking deeper
[1:43:35] than just being inside of these walls
[1:43:38] we believe in a liberty to worship god
[1:43:42] a liberty the holy spirit the preaching
[1:43:44] of the word brings liberty but brother
[1:43:47] we're talking about more than just
[1:43:49] dancing and shouting we're talking about
[1:43:52] it means a liberty that you can live a
[1:43:56] free life in jesus christ
[1:44:00] [Applause]
[1:44:02] where where the inside where the flame
[1:44:06] of the message in our heart where
[1:44:09] that spirit is the spirit of the lord is
[1:44:12] there is liberty
[1:44:13] amen
[1:44:14] not tithe no longer amen
[1:44:17] amen
[1:44:18] glory be to god and we all with open
[1:44:21] face beholding is in a glass the glory
[1:44:22] of the lord are changed
[1:44:25] into the same image from glory to glory
[1:44:27] even as by the spirit of the lord
[1:44:30] we're still being changed
[1:44:32] is that right i mean you know
[1:44:36] it's like like paul i mean paul he was
[1:44:38] the smallest one still is
[1:44:40] paul when he was born he was small
[1:44:43] okay
[1:44:44] but baby just like you and i were babies
[1:44:48] i know it's hard to believe i was ever
[1:44:49] that small but i was
[1:44:50] but you know what
[1:44:52] i started eating
[1:44:55] 30
[1:44:57] and you know what i got sent to school
[1:45:00] college everything else come along that
[1:45:03] was all part of my growing up
[1:45:07] but i had to be born before i could ever
[1:45:09] mature
[1:45:10] you understand me you're not born fully
[1:45:13] mature
[1:45:15] but when you are born again of the
[1:45:16] spirit of god then you live in the
[1:45:19] presence of the king you're living under
[1:45:21] his presence that can ripen this word
[1:45:26] and make it alive and quicken your life
[1:45:32] i'll tell you that requires some
[1:45:33] sacrifice don't it
[1:45:36] it's liberty he had made me free let me
[1:45:38] go through a couple scriptures here in
[1:45:40] romans 8 2.
[1:45:41] now don't remember i said just say god
[1:45:43] help me stay with this
[1:45:46] for the law of the spirit of life in
[1:45:48] christ jesus hath
[1:45:50] made
[1:45:51] me free from the law of sin and death
[1:45:54] see it's a new creation
[1:45:56] if john 8 36 if the son therefore shall
[1:45:59] make you free you shall be free indeed
[1:46:04] revelations 21 5 and he that set up on
[1:46:06] the throne said behold i make all things
[1:46:11] new
[1:46:12] galatians 6 15 for in christ jesus
[1:46:15] neither circumcision availeth anything
[1:46:17] nor uncircumcision but a new
[1:46:20] creature
[1:46:22] ephesians 2 10
[1:46:25] for we are his workmanship created in
[1:46:28] christ jesus you catch that
[1:46:30] we are his workmanship
[1:46:34] created in christ jesus
[1:46:36] unto good works which god hath before
[1:46:39] ordained that we should walk in them
[1:46:44] some of you you've heard me give this
[1:46:46] example a lot i've never seen one of
[1:46:48] them seed packets they got at lowe's or
[1:46:49] home depot or menards you don't talk
[1:46:51] about them seed packets you buy them
[1:46:52] dandelions or tomato seeds or whatever
[1:46:54] on the back of them
[1:46:56] they tell you what zones they grow in
[1:46:58] they also have all these words
[1:47:01] and sometimes they'll even give pictures
[1:47:02] i like when they get pictures
[1:47:04] because because before that you're just
[1:47:05] looking at words you're thinking
[1:47:09] well because it don't look like what you
[1:47:10] see out here right away
[1:47:12] are you hearing me you know when you get
[1:47:14] to looking at it it's coming up you keep
[1:47:15] looking at that picture there yeah
[1:47:18] it don't look like that yet but i trust
[1:47:19] there's a right seeds inside of here how
[1:47:22] do you know if you got the right seeds
[1:47:24] in that packet
[1:47:25] because when you plant them
[1:47:28] all the words
[1:47:30] are made manifest
[1:47:31] in the expression of that life
[1:47:36] you just plant them you water them and
[1:47:38] what happens the words that was wrote
[1:47:40] there on that packet they begin to
[1:47:42] declare themselves that's the same way
[1:47:45] it is inside of a child of god inside
[1:47:48] was that seed of god god already wrote
[1:47:52] everything there in that seed but when
[1:47:54] the holy ghost comes brother what does
[1:47:57] it do it releases that seed that was
[1:48:00] dead the writings that was already there
[1:48:03] ordained for this age it begins to
[1:48:06] release it
[1:48:11] and her life reflects
[1:48:13] what is in the writing
[1:48:17] you see
[1:48:19] like this like this the church here some
[1:48:21] of you
[1:48:22] are aware of this some of you are not
[1:48:25] we first moved in this building
[1:48:27] thank god it was god blessed us with
[1:48:28] this building
[1:48:29] there's things that you know we were
[1:48:30] able to come in here and we were able to
[1:48:32] start having services
[1:48:33] but
[1:48:35] there was some carpet that was in here
[1:48:39] didn't need to be replaced man
[1:48:42] and there was some
[1:48:45] lights i won't call them what i think
[1:48:46] they were but
[1:48:48] there were lights in here
[1:48:51] they needed to be replaced i'm gonna
[1:48:52] talk about the ones we had in here
[1:48:53] before we just replaced these
[1:48:55] there were some things
[1:48:58] painting remember how it was some of the
[1:49:00] painting and things
[1:49:01] how the rooms everything it wasn't like
[1:49:03] it was out there
[1:49:04] brothers just did a phenomenal job with
[1:49:06] that and with this too
[1:49:10] i didn't need every moment we'd stop and
[1:49:11] give him a hand clap
[1:49:14] but you know what that was
[1:49:16] when they came in here and they put on
[1:49:17] all them coats of paint and they did all
[1:49:19] them white trim and put them in the
[1:49:21] white doors and even when they put in
[1:49:23] these lights and all the and put in put
[1:49:25] in new carpet got pads on the pew so i
[1:49:28] could preach longer
[1:49:34] it helps
[1:49:35] maybe we need something for the lumbar
[1:49:37] support you know
[1:49:39] but here's what i'm going to tell you
[1:49:41] that didn't change this building
[1:49:45] it didn't change it at all
[1:49:47] it was just a renewing
[1:49:49] we gave it what you call
[1:49:51] a facelift
[1:49:54] but you see god doesn't come
[1:49:58] in the new birth to give us a facelift
[1:50:02] god don't look and say you know they
[1:50:03] need a change of carpet that's what it
[1:50:05] is no
[1:50:06] we need more than a change of carpet
[1:50:09] we needed more than a change of lights
[1:50:12] we needed more than just a change like
[1:50:14] i'm gonna you know five steps to a
[1:50:15] better me we needed more
[1:50:18] we didn't need that
[1:50:20] we needed
[1:50:21] a change
[1:50:23] that's what the new birth is it brings a
[1:50:26] change on the inside it's a new
[1:50:30] creation
[1:50:31] [Music]
[1:50:33] this is why as a young person or anybody
[1:50:35] else you can drive i'm gonna trying to
[1:50:37] live this and brother samuel it's so
[1:50:39] hard
[1:50:40] it's because
[1:50:42] down here on the inside thank god i mean
[1:50:44] there'll be a lot of things that will
[1:50:45] save you from even as you give yourself
[1:50:47] to the word but remember what that
[1:50:49] consecration is about say god
[1:50:52] kill this old nature inside of me
[1:50:56] kill this whole nature because god
[1:50:59] won't move into a house where somebody's
[1:51:00] living already
[1:51:04] it's got to be dead and then then the
[1:51:06] spirit of god all these scriptures we
[1:51:07] just read right here it's a creation of
[1:51:10] god
[1:51:12] then you know what's inside of you
[1:51:13] the word of reconciliation
[1:51:16] you know what's inside of you
[1:51:18] words
[1:51:19] that was in the book
[1:51:21] are you with me
[1:51:22] then you know what's inside of you
[1:51:24] the same holy ghost the lamb now holding
[1:51:27] the book in your life
[1:51:28] are you with me
[1:51:30] the same spirit of god moving in your
[1:51:32] life and declaring himself to be alive
[1:51:36] and well
[1:51:38] now i realize
[1:51:40] let me just bring this down here
[1:51:42] i know i've been saying that a lot and
[1:51:44] you might think man this guy must be a
[1:51:45] rookie plane driver
[1:51:51] but you see let me just let me bring it
[1:51:53] on down here
[1:51:54] because sometimes we can look up here
[1:51:56] and we say my goodness
[1:51:58] yes and we're looking at everything way
[1:52:00] out here and well i
[1:52:01] you know yeah i i believe there's a
[1:52:04] change on the inside i i believe that i
[1:52:06] i i witnessed that in my life the
[1:52:08] desires are gone and the lord he's the
[1:52:11] love of my life
[1:52:13] well then it it'll show itself on the
[1:52:16] outside
[1:52:18] are you hearing me
[1:52:20] this is why when the scripture says
[1:52:23] in romans
[1:52:25] the gentiles we didn't even have the law
[1:52:27] we didn't have the law we didn't know
[1:52:29] thou shalt not doubt we didn't know that
[1:52:32] but here the holy ghost comes
[1:52:35] and when he moves into our life now the
[1:52:37] scripture says
[1:52:39] that gentiles which don't have the law
[1:52:42] do by nature
[1:52:44] the things contained in the law
[1:52:47] showing that the indwelling the writing
[1:52:50] of this
[1:52:52] is the new birth
[1:52:55] it's where the living word the person of
[1:52:57] jesus christ
[1:52:58] comes down
[1:53:00] on the inside
[1:53:02] you see this is why
[1:53:04] let me just let me let me read this and
[1:53:06] i am i'm closing
[1:53:08] who is this melchizedek
[1:53:11] when this body
[1:53:13] receives the spirit of god the immortal
[1:53:16] life inside of you it throws this body
[1:53:20] in subjection to god
[1:53:23] he that's born of god does not commit
[1:53:25] sin it means practice
[1:53:27] he cannot sin
[1:53:28] because there there is therefore now no
[1:53:30] condemnation to them that's in christ
[1:53:32] jesus they walk not after the flesh but
[1:53:33] after the spirit there you are that
[1:53:35] throws your body
[1:53:37] subject
[1:53:38] you don't have to say oh if i could just
[1:53:40] quit drinking if i could just just get
[1:53:42] in christ
[1:53:43] and it's all gone because your body is
[1:53:46] subject to the spirit it's no more
[1:53:48] subject to the things of the world
[1:53:50] they're dead
[1:53:51] they are dead your sins are buried in
[1:53:53] baptism and you're a new creation christ
[1:53:56] and your body becoming subject to the
[1:53:58] spirit try to live a right kind of life
[1:54:01] see it what is it i will put my spirit
[1:54:04] inside of you
[1:54:06] and i will cause you
[1:54:08] to keep
[1:54:10] my statutes amen my judgments
[1:54:15] in the hebrew man says like you women
[1:54:16] claiming you got the holy ghost
[1:54:19] and going out here and wearing shorts
[1:54:20] and things how could you do it you see
[1:54:22] because he's the spirit of truth he
[1:54:24] won't go against his word
[1:54:27] come on now this is the bible
[1:54:29] it's an abomination for a woman to put
[1:54:31] on any garment that pertains to a man
[1:54:33] that's scripture
[1:54:35] paul said let her be clothed in modest
[1:54:37] apparel modest the very word modest in
[1:54:39] your bible means free flowing
[1:54:42] not clingy
[1:54:48] that's the bible
[1:54:51] oh brother samuel i'm wearing a dress
[1:54:53] it'll not show every form
[1:54:56] [Music]
[1:54:58] see the holy ghost on the inside will
[1:55:00] line up with that word oh brother sam
[1:55:02] you're trying to make this do's and
[1:55:03] don'ts if you've got the inside goods
[1:55:06] that wants to line with the spirit of
[1:55:09] almighty god
[1:55:10] are you hearing me
[1:55:12] modest apparel is free flowing garments
[1:55:17] and that also goes for the men that want
[1:55:18] to wear them britches that are all
[1:55:21] skin-tight
[1:55:24] nothing but a bunch of homosexuals that
[1:55:26] design them things
[1:55:28] you know what they like their clothes so
[1:55:29] good they want to see them on you
[1:55:33] preach brother samuel
[1:55:36] well this is all free anyhow
[1:55:39] like you women claiming you got the holy
[1:55:41] ghost and going out here wearing shorts
[1:55:42] and things how could you do it how could
[1:55:45] the spirit of god in you ever let you do
[1:55:47] such a thing as that it just can't be
[1:55:50] soul
[1:55:51] certainly it can't be he's not a filthy
[1:55:54] spirit he's a holy spirit the holy
[1:55:57] spirit won't let you look at filthy
[1:55:59] stuff on the internet
[1:56:01] preach brother samuel he won't let you
[1:56:03] look at those things like that
[1:56:05] i'm going to preach it
[1:56:08] the holy ghost does not produce an up
[1:56:10] and down and in and out life
[1:56:12] the holy ghost produces a sanctified
[1:56:15] life that's rooted in the things of god
[1:56:18] and it declares itself nobody should
[1:56:21] have to ask if you're a christian
[1:56:24] your neighbor ought to know you're a
[1:56:25] christian
[1:56:26] nobody should wonder in this
[1:56:28] congregation if you really are on fire
[1:56:30] for god you ought to declare itself in
[1:56:32] your life
[1:56:35] don't worry that fire you don't think
[1:56:37] it'll do it's a consuming fire it'll
[1:56:39] burn up sin it'll burn up unbelief but
[1:56:41] it'll set you on fire down on the inside
[1:56:43] brother to where no test or trial can
[1:56:46] ever blow out that holy fire
[1:56:48] [Applause]
[1:56:49] come on now
[1:56:51] then when you become subject to that
[1:56:53] spirit it throws your whole being
[1:56:56] subject to the spirit remember
[1:56:58] whatever's on the inside reflects itself
[1:57:00] to the outside
[1:57:02] is that right
[1:57:05] and that spirit is nothing in the world
[1:57:08] but this seed word
[1:57:10] made manifest or quickened
[1:57:13] hallelujah made a life remember what
[1:57:15] he's talking about remember we talked
[1:57:16] about the holy ghost
[1:57:18] look out here
[1:57:21] on dirt you let water come on dirt weeds
[1:57:24] will come up right right you can't look
[1:57:26] down there and say well why isn't there
[1:57:27] any wheat coming up did you plant wheat
[1:57:29] there
[1:57:30] if you didn't plant wheat fair the rain
[1:57:32] ain't going to release no wheat because
[1:57:34] there ain't no wheat there but if
[1:57:36] there's wheat there when you let the
[1:57:37] rain come in the sun it'll bring up the
[1:57:39] wheat that's why when you get in the
[1:57:41] presence of god it takes the presence of
[1:57:44] god to draw out that seed on the inside
[1:57:47] what's the holy spirit wanting to do
[1:57:49] he's wanting to anoint more than a flesh
[1:57:52] than a spirit he's wanting to anoint his
[1:57:55] word
[1:57:58] because when he anoints his word
[1:58:00] then that word is made manifest
[1:58:03] it throws the body see the body becomes
[1:58:05] subject
[1:58:08] i mean my hand don't tell my brain hey
[1:58:10] this is what i want you to do it don't
[1:58:11] my intelligence tells my hand pick this
[1:58:13] up i got a need right here pick this up
[1:58:16] see what's ever in here reflects itself
[1:58:21] oh my and when the bible said don't do
[1:58:23] this that body quickly turns to it
[1:58:25] there's no question
[1:58:27] aren't you glad you got on the inside
[1:58:29] that will agree
[1:58:31] with a
[1:58:32] correction when it deals with your life
[1:58:35] aren't you glad there's something on the
[1:58:36] inside you know what that is it's an
[1:58:38] amen
[1:58:40] so be it soviet amen lord amen to the
[1:58:43] word of god
[1:58:46] oh my i'll tell you what
[1:58:49] when the holy ghost he comes he brings
[1:58:51] conviction but oh what grace comes that
[1:58:53] we might line up with it
[1:58:55] oh brother bram said what is it it's the
[1:58:57] earnest
[1:58:58] of the resurrection this body
[1:59:01] will be raised up again because it's
[1:59:03] already started
[1:59:04] it was once subject to sin and mire and
[1:59:07] corruption and now it's got the earnest
[1:59:10] it's turned
[1:59:11] heavenly
[1:59:12] that's the earnest
[1:59:14] you're going in the rapture
[1:59:16] that's
[1:59:18] the earnest
[1:59:20] that's the token
[1:59:22] that's the seal that's the testimony
[1:59:25] and then what does that testimony what
[1:59:27] does the testimony do inside of us
[1:59:31] it gives us a testimony
[1:59:34] see then everything that we do or say
[1:59:37] it's a testimony
[1:59:40] this is why
[1:59:41] it's not us trying to prop up one
[1:59:43] another's
[1:59:45] you know our life is what our testimony
[1:59:47] is
[1:59:51] our life is what our testimony is
[1:59:54] it's not what we say
[1:59:56] it's what our life declares
[1:59:59] i'll tell you right here today if if my
[2:00:01] life wasn't declaring it
[2:00:03] i'd wanna
[2:00:04] desire to be the line up with that lord
[2:00:06] i want the inside man right
[2:00:09] lord let the holy ghost go down to the
[2:00:11] inside i want it right on the inside
[2:00:15] hi brother samuel how do we get there
[2:00:17] look i've got
[2:00:18] no doubt people be streaming and even
[2:00:20] sitting right here we first repent
[2:00:24] but we don't go through these things
[2:00:25] just to go through them
[2:00:27] come on now
[2:00:30] we repent and we're baptized in the name
[2:00:32] of jesus christ for the remission of our
[2:00:33] sins then you receive the gift of the
[2:00:36] holy ghost
[2:00:39] when the gift of the holy ghost has come
[2:00:41] that brings a new creation
[2:00:45] it brings a change on the inside now let
[2:00:47] me just let me drop this in here too as
[2:00:49] well
[2:00:51] every moment and every day of our life
[2:00:53] as a believer there's no greater desire
[2:00:55] we have
[2:00:57] than that he would be glorified
[2:01:00] and displayed in our life
[2:01:01] [Music]
[2:01:03] and if there's something in our life
[2:01:05] that's hindering that if there's
[2:01:07] something that's crowding that out
[2:01:09] that's where as a believer we start
[2:01:11] taking inventory and saying wait a
[2:01:12] minute there's stuff coming in the
[2:01:14] temple
[2:01:15] that don't need to be here
[2:01:17] and i want to remind you
[2:01:19] sweet jesus came in the temple one day
[2:01:22] but he had platted ropes
[2:01:24] and sweet jesus came in and cleaned
[2:01:26] house
[2:01:28] are you with me the bible said he had
[2:01:30] eyes filled with anger
[2:01:33] anger at who
[2:01:34] at the condition that was on the inside
[2:01:37] to clean out those things
[2:01:40] that were hindering the temple
[2:01:42] from being used and declared
[2:01:45] how it should be
[2:01:46] it's meant to be a house of prayer a
[2:01:50] house of consecration

[2:01:56] christ

[2:08:43] regarding the things in the word
[2:08:46] there's a desire on the inside that says
[2:08:48] amen lord
[2:08:50] soviet in my life
[2:08:52] [Music]
[2:08:54] o granite lord

[2:09:04] midst of tests of trials
[2:09:07] and tribulation there's an anchor that
[2:09:09] holds us lord

[2:10:31] them
[2:10:33] god granted let the fire of god

[2:10:48] that as they grow
[2:10:50] they've got to continue to eat they've
[2:10:51] got to feed their experience

[2:23:07] between my lord
[2:23:11] [Music]
[2:23:18] [Music]
[2:23:22] a mystery
[2:23:23] never becomes clear
[2:23:26] without
[2:23:28] supernatural teaching
[2:23:31] is that right
[2:23:32] that's a direct quote out of the message
[2:23:36] it never becomes clear without
[2:23:38] supernatural teaching
[2:23:40] it takes the holy ghost to come
[2:23:42] and he quickens he inspires that word to
[2:23:44] our heart
[2:23:45] over and over
[2:23:47] and over again
[2:23:49] there's things that god shows in our
[2:23:51] life you know there's sometimes there's
[2:23:52] things
[2:23:55] that you just don't even realize the
[2:23:57] importance sometimes of it there's
[2:23:58] certain things that we have done around
[2:24:00] our house or even on our automobiles
[2:24:03] like when you take your automobile and
[2:24:04] you go have the oil changed they rotate
[2:24:06] the tires you don't think nothing about
[2:24:08] it thirty dollar fifty dollar job thing
[2:24:10] well it's time to go get it done
[2:24:12] but you know by doing those things like
[2:24:14] that
[2:24:15] it prevents
[2:24:17] other things down the line
[2:24:20] it actually will cause that thing to run
[2:24:22] longer now sometimes
[2:24:25] i remember when i was just a young guy
[2:24:27] real young still am but i remember you
[2:24:30] know what brother richard i
[2:24:31] i'm looking at this is how much i'm
[2:24:33] making four dollars and 25 cents an hour
[2:24:35] i got to pay that to have an oil changed
[2:24:39] you know what it was brother brian i
[2:24:40] didn't understand everything that went
[2:24:42] with it i did it i did it i'm glad i did
[2:24:45] it but i didn't understand everything
[2:24:47] that went with it but you know what for
[2:24:49] the erin it caught a lot of things
[2:24:51] sometimes they could say hey you were
[2:24:52] low on transmission fluid if you hadn't
[2:24:54] brought that in here at that time your
[2:24:56] transmission would have burned up and
[2:24:58] that would've been thousands of dollars
[2:25:00] you see just in checkups it kept major
[2:25:03] things at bay
[2:25:04] listen to me now that's what staying in
[2:25:06] the presence of god does that's what
[2:25:08] when we look at it that's what staying
[2:25:10] in prayer does that's what coming to the
[2:25:11] house of god does are you hearing me
[2:25:13] these are little these are checkups in
[2:25:15] the presence of god
[2:25:17] and as we grow older
[2:25:18] in the lord you begin to realize more
[2:25:20] and more of the value of it
[2:25:23] if it hadn't been for the lord my god
[2:25:25] just came just like that see we begin to
[2:25:27] see those things
[2:25:28] that are very important
[2:25:31] may god help every one of us
[2:25:34] that our lives
[2:25:36] be a real reflection of him in every way
[2:25:40] if there's times in your life look when
[2:25:42] there's been that of the new birth
[2:25:44] there's times you have to have a
[2:25:45] renewing right sometimes you get a new
[2:25:47] couch set or you paint you change the
[2:25:48] paint colors say hey you know what we
[2:25:50] need to change colors around here you
[2:25:51] don't change
[2:25:52] you don't go get born again after you've
[2:25:54] been born again you with me
[2:25:56] sometimes you just need a refreshing
[2:25:58] a renewing
[2:26:01] is that right
[2:26:02] and those times of refreshing and
[2:26:04] renewing here comes the love of god oh
[2:26:06] my you know everything she started gotta
[2:26:08] loot start to get a little sticky about
[2:26:09] stuff you know like
[2:26:10] [Music]
[2:26:12] someone so looked at me this way
[2:26:14] they said something like this but you
[2:26:16] find when you get
[2:26:17] another renewing and a refreshing of the
[2:26:19] holy ghost
[2:26:21] oh the love of god it just has a way of
[2:26:23] taking
[2:26:24] those spiny prickers on a cactus
