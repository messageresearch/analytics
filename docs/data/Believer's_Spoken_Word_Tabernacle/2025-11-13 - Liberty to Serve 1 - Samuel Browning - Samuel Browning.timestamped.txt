[32:57] gathered together here tonight and so
[33:00] good to be back home. And we certainly
[33:03] appreciate your prayers for us while we
[33:05] were gone. And especially with
[33:08] everything that was going on with the um
[33:11] flights or what could have been. And um
[33:15] uh so we just thank God for his mercy. I
[33:18] I think it was some of the smoothest
[33:20] that we had.
[33:23] And uh so we are just thankful to God
[33:26] for his mercy and I certainly appreciate
[33:30] your prayers. Um I certainly uh could
[33:34] feel the prayers. We we arrived there
[33:37] and um had just a little bit of time to
[33:39] try to get our feet underneath us there
[33:41] because of the time difference. Three
[33:44] hours different. And so when it's nine
[33:46] o'clock there, it's midnight. This is
[33:48] I'm ready for bed.
[33:51] So, um, we had four four services there
[33:55] in a row and, um, God was so gracious to
[33:58] us. And I'm not going to keep you
[33:59] standing. I may just touch on that just
[34:01] a little bit here. But, um, I want to
[34:04] just say thank you for your prayers
[34:05] because God certainly gave us the
[34:07] strength and, um, it was just such a
[34:10] blessing. uh brother John and the
[34:12] brother John Andes and the congregation
[34:13] there certainly asked that we would just
[34:16] convey their greetings and thanks to you
[34:20] [music] and so uh I said I would do that
[34:24] and uh so we just certainly love the
[34:27] Lord and Amen. Let's just go to the Lord
[34:30] in a word of prayer tonight as we
[34:32] prepare to
[34:34] just get into the word.
[34:37] Heavenly Father,
[34:39] Lord, how thankful we are
[34:42] for your mercies once again. Thank you
[34:45] Lord for giving us another opportunity
[34:49] Lord
[34:50] Father where we could just come and
[34:53] Lord God to present ourselves Lord to
[34:56] you
[34:57] Lord to fellowship around the word of
[35:00] God
[35:02] Lord knowing that
[35:04] your word Lord it has life within it
[35:07] Father
[35:08] and so Lord we just ask [music] that you
[35:11] would just come and Lord just just speak
[35:16] to our hearts tonight.
[35:18] May the life itself Lord just travel
[35:20] through the body. May you minister,
[35:23] Lord, to each of our needs that's
[35:26] gathered here. Lord, I just reserve
[35:30] myself Lord to you. [music] Ask that you
[35:33] would lead completely, Father. Lord,
[35:36] forgive us of our sins and our
[35:38] shortcomings.
[35:39] May your grace just move upon us, Lord,
[35:42] here tonight. Help us that we can see
[35:44] you. We can recognize you. Help us,
[35:48] Lord, to see, Father, the application of
[35:52] the word in our own lives, Lord, in a
[35:54] personal way, God. May our hearts and
[35:57] our lives just be ever so edified and
[36:00] encouraged because you have come, Lord.
[36:03] And, Father, just refreshed in your
[36:06] presence. And Father, with a desire just
[36:10] moving in our hearts that we want to
[36:12] just serve you better, Lord, we want to
[36:15] be closer to you, Lord. I pray that you
[36:18] would help us tonight, Lord. Be with the
[36:21] Lord, the different needs, Lord, that
[36:23] was read across this pull pit already,
[36:25] [music] the unspoken request, the needs
[36:28] upon the hearts of your children. Lord,
[36:30] may you just minister, Lord, to each one
[36:33] of our needs tonight. We commit
[36:35] ourselves into your hands, Father, in
[36:38] the name of Jesus Christ.
[36:40] Amen. And amen.
[36:43] Amen.
[36:46] Amen. As we turn into the word. Thank
[36:49] you, musicians.
[36:52] I want to um read here a very familiar
[36:55] passage of scripture to us.
[36:59] And um [clears throat] just to take a
[37:02] thought from here and here how Paul is
[37:06] just really expressing of the very
[37:10] character and life of the c of life of
[37:13] Christ knowing what would be in the
[37:17] possession of the believers and what we
[37:20] uh would be called to. In other words,
[37:22] there would be an effect of this life.
[37:25] Paul said in verse one of Philippians 2,
[37:28] "If there be any consolation in Christ,
[37:31] if any comfort of love, if any
[37:33] fellowship of the spirit, and if any
[37:35] bows and mercies fulfill you, my joy,
[37:40] that you be likeminded,
[37:42] having the same love, being of one
[37:46] accord and of one mind, and let nothing
[37:50] be done through strife or vain glory.
[37:55] But in loneliness of mind, let each
[37:58] esteem other better than themselves, and
[38:02] look not every man on his own things,
[38:05] but every man also
[38:08] on the things of others.
[38:11] Verse five, let this mind be in you
[38:16] which was also in Christ Jesus, who
[38:19] being in the form of God, thought it not
[38:22] robbery to be equal with God, but made
[38:26] himself of no reputation,
[38:29] and took upon him the form of a servant,
[38:33] and was made in the likeness of men. And
[38:36] being found in fashion as a man, he
[38:38] humbled himself, and became obedient
[38:41] unto death, even the death of the cross.
[38:46] Wherefore God also hath highly exalted
[38:51] him, and given him a name which is above
[38:54] every name, that at the name of Jesus
[38:57] every knee should bow, of things in
[39:00] heaven, things in earth, and things
[39:03] under the earth, and that every tongue
[39:05] should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[39:09] to the glory of God the Father. Amen.
[39:13] God bless you as you're being seated.
[39:16] I'd like to speak here tonight on this
[39:22] thought and um just trusting as we go
[39:25] along that it will uh be conveyed as it
[39:29] um uh was so just pressed on my heart
[39:33] and um to know the liberty to serve and
[39:38] how we are so thankful to God for real
[39:42] true liberty that the gospel has brought
[39:46] that the Holy Spirit has brought to our
[39:47] lives and that real liberty when we look
[39:50] at that word it means to be as one ought
[39:55] to be and we're thankful for God's mercy
[39:58] of what God has done in our lives and he
[40:00] has brought us to a real liberty to
[40:03] where that we can really serve his
[40:06] purpose and his will and we certainly
[40:09] become aware and mindful of the of
[40:13] really of the spiritual things as
[40:15] brother Brandham would say it in one
[40:16] place when we have been born again of
[40:19] the spirit of God. He says you then have
[40:21] become a candidate for association with
[40:25] the angelic beings to where that they
[40:28] will bring and deliver to our hearts the
[40:31] very things that we have need of and God
[40:34] would speak to our lives and and truly
[40:36] within our lives. remember brother
[40:38] Brandham would take uh a familiar um
[40:42] statement well I'll say a statement that
[40:44] where he was told to pick up his pen and
[40:46] write and we're we're as message
[40:48] believers we would be very uh familiar
[40:49] with this where it would speak here is
[40:52] the secret and it's dealing with how
[40:54] that the life is in the seed and then
[40:57] into the place where the seed is
[40:59] quickened when life comes upon it
[41:02] because that's that was the purpose of
[41:04] the Holy Spirit coming is to make
[41:07] redemption real and to bring real
[41:09] liberty into the heart and life of the
[41:13] believer. And brother Bam would write
[41:15] that or under the influence of the Holy
[41:17] Spirit that the secret is this that the
[41:20] bride has the mind of Christ and she
[41:23] knows what he wants done with the word
[41:27] and she does it in his name. She has
[41:29] thus sayaith the Lord. And I when we
[41:31] look at that quote, I I I believe that
[41:34] when we're seeing this in the message
[41:36] that the message when the God's life
[41:39] within us, it's a life that has come uh
[41:42] God's life to change our lives. And
[41:45] there's an application that comes into
[41:48] our life for each and every day. The the
[41:51] message, we understand this that it's
[41:54] not um doctrines yet. God restored true
[41:59] doctrines, but we could have all the
[42:02] doctrines just right and we could miss
[42:04] the life. That's right.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; And so the most important thing is is if
[42:09] we have the life, it will bring us to
[42:11] the doctrine be the right doctrine and
[42:14] the right understanding that we need
[42:16] because the Bible said when he the
[42:18] spirit of truth has come, he will lead
[42:20] and guide us into all truth. And the
[42:23] prophet said that's one of the true
[42:25] signs and evidence and rising of the
[42:27] sun. He said is how when the spirit of
[42:29] God has come into your life, it will
[42:31] direct you on into the word. It never
[42:34] takes you away but it's directing you on
[42:35] into the word. And we recognize being
[42:38] directed on into the word is not just
[42:40] you know being able to lay things in
[42:42] order but when we are recognizing that
[42:45] the word is the very person of Jesus
[42:48] Christ it's God. It's Melzdc who who is
[42:52] among us. All of these things through
[42:54] the scripture. And so we just don't see
[42:57] just u of of theology or or what or just
[43:01] truth as far as a letter because truth
[43:04] is a person. And so what what the
[43:07] message has come to bring us in contact
[43:09] with and a real union is with the person
[43:12] of Jesus Christ. And so it's to bring
[43:15] forth it's it's uniting with that
[43:19] character of life because that's the the
[43:21] only way that that that same character
[43:24] can be reproduced as it was in the body
[43:28] of the Lord Jesus is if that same spirit
[43:31] be inside of us. And that spirit inside
[43:34] of us when it comes upon the seed that
[43:36] is already there. Then that seed itself
[43:39] as it would as it will yield and the
[43:42] spirit of God moving in our life it
[43:45] begins to manifest if if I can say it in
[43:47] this way just like every bit of the
[43:50] apples and leaves are in one seed that's
[43:54] the same way within our life everything
[43:56] and all that we are to be as a part of
[43:59] that word it already lays within that
[44:01] seed
[44:03] &gt;&gt; there's a statement that I really love
[44:05] where it says that you know we can count
[44:07] the seed seeds in an apple. But only God
[44:10] can count the apples in a seed.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; And so God already knows what lays
[44:15] inside of you and I when we consider the
[44:18] virtues as we Peter would speak of those
[44:20] things. Those virtues are already laying
[44:23] there in that seed. And it takes the
[44:25] Holy Spirit to begin to quicken that
[44:27] word to our life. And remember the
[44:29] restoring of this relationship in the
[44:32] fullness brings us back to St. John 5:19
[44:36] that the son can do nothing but what he
[44:39] seeth the father doing that doeth the
[44:42] son likewise. So God is is moving a
[44:46] people. You and I are being moved by the
[44:50] eye of God. The in other words the
[44:52] vision or the revelation of the word is
[44:55] what has to break upon our lives.
[44:57] There's there's things that we can um be
[45:00] able to even set down and um many times
[45:03] I've realized this even sometimes even
[45:05] in counseling or even sitting with a
[45:07] person and just trying to find just just
[45:10] the leading of the Lord because there's
[45:12] many things that can be said but yet if
[45:14] if it's not the right timing and what is
[45:17] actually going to be said is truth but
[45:19] if it's not the right timing it'll never
[45:22] be received but because it it has to be
[45:26] seen mean in that way. And so God and
[45:29] that's it's not about and that's why I
[45:31] said it's not not about make it see it
[45:33] my way or whatever and it's just God God
[45:36] has a way of doing it friends. He had
[45:38] you know there's things that I' I've
[45:39] marveled over the years where God will
[45:41] take a text and take a service and God
[45:44] will bring things and bring things out
[45:46] in a service and you'll have where it'll
[45:49] so speak to a life. I was speaking there
[45:52] on the the Sunday night service and just
[45:54] begin to get into some strains there um
[45:57] in that service and dealing with you
[45:59] know rejection and dealing with
[46:01] accusations and dealing with those types
[46:03] of things that we all uh must come
[46:06] through as Joseph did. And here an
[46:10] individual met me in the foyer and I had
[46:12] went back to um you know greet the
[46:15] brothers. I was standing back there
[46:16] greeting all the saints as they were
[46:18] going out and then I went back to thank
[46:20] the audio and video people for them
[46:22] tolerating and putting up with me and
[46:24] and through things you know and uh and
[46:27] so as I'm back there then one brother he
[46:29] stops me when we get on the foyer and he
[46:32] said you know he said the Holy Spirit
[46:34] just began to bring such conviction he
[46:36] said to my heart about bitterness and he
[46:39] said what it is he said I had become
[46:41] bitter he said toward an individual
[46:43] because he said it seemed seemed like
[46:45] they just walked past me a couple times
[46:47] and didn't shake my hand. He said, "But
[46:48] I" He said, "When that word was coming
[46:50] forth, I said, God, if you'll give me
[46:53] the opportunity as soon as this service
[46:56] is over, I'm going to go make that thing
[46:58] right because I don't want to be a
[46:59] hindrance in the service."
[47:01] And so
[47:02] &gt;&gt; I I say I say that for this regard is
[47:05] that it takes God to show you and I
[47:10] &gt;&gt; and that's why that your walk with God
[47:13] is not the walk of you resting on a man.
[47:17] It's your resting on God.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; It's God revealing himself. And this is
[47:21] where that we want to be in our lives is
[47:23] say, "Lord, show me how to to to apply
[47:27] the word because we're living in the age
[47:30] of application, the token, the life, the
[47:32] very the very person of Jesus Christ.
[47:35] We're living in that hour and it's such
[47:37] a crucial time even in our lives because
[47:39] we realize how we could go by our own
[47:43] feelings and we have and man, we've been
[47:45] wrong and that's where we get in our own
[47:47] trouble." But when we can just pause and
[47:50] no matter we might think that I've got
[47:52] to get this or you know press this in
[47:55] but when we can just wait on the Lord oh
[47:58] my the Bible says wait on the Lord and
[48:01] be of good courage and he will
[48:03] strengthen your heart. God will give us
[48:05] the wisdom that we need even how to
[48:08] apply the word that is in season to our
[48:11] situation. And so even the waiting is
[48:14] God molding us and shaping us as the
[48:17] children of God because patience is
[48:20] being worked out within our lives. And
[48:22] so when I look at this thought here on
[48:25] the liberty to serve the scripture, I
[48:28] want to just take just a portion from
[48:30] where we read and it says, "But he made
[48:32] of himself of no reputation and took
[48:36] upon him the form or the visage what
[48:39] would be seen to others as the form of a
[48:43] servant, and was made in the likeness of
[48:46] men. And being found in fashion as a
[48:50] man, he humbled himself. So just to be
[48:53] fashioned as a man was not enough
[48:56] humility.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; But being found fashioned as a man
[49:00] because as the prophet would say it over
[49:01] and over, he says this was humiliation
[49:05] to think the God of glory
[49:08] &gt;&gt; who who had who had even the atoms and
[49:10] the molecules, the dust created, the
[49:12] angels, everything. And now God stepping
[49:15] down and taking on himself a part of his
[49:19] own creation where God would become one
[49:23] one of you and I. It would not seem
[49:25] fitting that, you know, to think of the
[49:28] King of Kings, not just a king because
[49:30] we could even dwell there for a moment,
[49:32] but the King of Kings would lay aside
[49:36] all of his kingly garments and dawn upon
[49:40] himself uh a body made in the likeness
[49:43] of sinful flesh like you and I. And the
[49:47] whole purpose of that was for
[49:49] redemption. And I know that's very
[49:51] common terms to us, but when Jesus was
[49:54] here, he just did not uh come. He just
[49:58] didn't step forward, you know, as a
[50:00] fully grown man and then that's it. But
[50:03] he he came through every stage of life
[50:08] and he could have he you know he
[50:10] couldn't have just come and just stepped
[50:12] out like he did uh and met Abraham
[50:15] because he had to come through the woman
[50:18] where the fall had taken place in order
[50:21] to be able to be our perfect sacrifice
[50:24] and to undo what was done in the fall.
[50:27] So everything was for a purpose and yet
[50:30] even within it he was purposed for
[50:33] redemption. But even in them even in his
[50:37] whole journey he he he did all that he
[50:40] did in order that he might understand us
[50:43] in order that he might be the right kind
[50:45] of a mediator that he might be a
[50:48] faithful and merciful high priest. I I'm
[50:50] so thankful that when you and I can go
[50:52] to him he doesn't go and say, "Well, I
[50:54] don't know. I I can't relate to what
[50:56] you're going through. I I don't
[50:57] understand that temptation. But as a
[50:59] matter of fact, he he possessed the gate
[51:02] of all the enemies. He he withtood in
[51:05] every one of the three ways that John
[51:07] describes that temptation can come. He
[51:09] possessed the gates of the enemy. He had
[51:12] his own personal temptations. Satan so
[51:15] uh personally attacked him just like he
[51:19] personally attacks you and I. And he and
[51:22] he attacks you even within your
[51:24] position. He attacks you. You know, even
[51:26] as we come in moments of weakness, he
[51:29] attacked the Lord Jesus in a time of
[51:31] weakness when he was of of of of a
[51:33] hunger and showing that how that
[51:35] temptation will come even in those
[51:38] moments of weakness. We are tempted in
[51:41] many ways. But to understand this when
[51:43] we look at the scripture he took upon
[51:45] him the form of a servant and being
[51:48] found in fashion as a man he humbled
[51:52] himself the whole life and ministry of
[51:55] the Lord Jesus of God come down was a
[51:58] life of humility.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; That's true
[52:00] &gt;&gt; all the way. There was not just a
[52:02] certain day or time where it kicked in
[52:04] but it was continual humility. Yes, it
[52:08] was.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; And it was it was humbling even in the
[52:11] humbling of himself to the needs of
[52:14] others. Even humbling himself when
[52:17] others were distraught and all tore
[52:20] apart, he himself humbled himself to
[52:23] minister to the needs in that situation
[52:26] in order that they might receive what
[52:29] they had need of.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; So even their discouragements, it it did
[52:35] not cause HIM TO DRAW BACK. He he
[52:37] ministered. He humbled himself and and
[52:40] to minister to those needs. Even the man
[52:43] the pool salom. We could go on and on.
[52:45] There's many many needs that we the Lord
[52:47] Jesus minister to that we do not even
[52:51] have record that these individuals
[52:54] continued to serve the Lord.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; We don't have anything about the the
[52:59] widow of Naine, her son. We have
[53:01] nothing. We we don't have did she go on
[53:03] to serve the Lord? Did she walk on in
[53:05] the light OF THE TRUTH? WE DON'T KNOW.
[53:07] BUT JESUS DID NOT CONFINE HUMBLING
[53:10] HIMSELF to minister to a need based on
[53:14] whether or not someone was going to
[53:17] continue on.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE HAVE RECORDED IN
[53:22] THE scriptures of the Roman centurion
[53:25] who recognized the position of the Lord
[53:28] Jesus. He recognized who he was. He is
[53:31] able to relate and recognize he's a man
[53:34] of authority like I am. So if if I speak
[53:37] and those underneath me carry it out,
[53:39] then he likewise if he all he needs to
[53:42] do is speak and my servant will be
[53:43] healed. REMEMBER HE JUST SAID JUST JUST
[53:46] SPEAK THE WORD. I I DON'T EVEN NEED YOU
[53:48] TO COME TO my house.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS SO COMMENDS him for his faith.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; There you go. BECAUSE HIS FAITH WAS IN
[53:58] recognizing that the word is sufficient.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Right?
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Gyrus said, "COME LAY YOUR HANDS ON MY
[54:07] DAUGHTER." NOW, I LISTEN, LET ME JUST
[54:09] tell you something right now. I I don't
[54:11] believe that we we need to put ourselves
[54:13] to try to be more spiritual and say,
[54:15] "Well, I'm just going to be like the
[54:16] Roman centurion, JUST SPEAK THE WORD."
[54:18] THERE MIGHT BE TIMES AND needs that
[54:21] you're going to need someone to come and
[54:23] pray for you because the scripture does
[54:25] say lay hands on the sick.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; It does say WHEN YOU'RE SICK, CALL for
[54:29] the elders of the church,
[54:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[54:32] &gt;&gt; So, we can't WE CAN'T DO AWAY WITH THIS.
[54:34] AND NEITHER DOES GOD WANT US TO BRING
[54:36] OURSELVES UP TO A PLACE OR SOMEHOW,
[54:38] WELL, I don't need this and I DON'T NEED
[54:40] THIS. NO, GOD HAS A WAY OF WORKING IN
[54:43] OUR LIFE TO EVEN TO CAUSE THE
[54:46] SURROUNDING CONDITIONS TO BRING ABOUT a
[54:49] recognition of humility,
[54:51] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[54:53] &gt;&gt; FOR US TO humble ourselves just like uh
[54:56] in coming into that place and in
[54:59] humility and maybe we say, "Well, I I'm
[55:01] not going to go that way. I'm not going
[55:03] to go the route of the doctor. I'm not
[55:04] going to go that route." And then
[55:06] finally as it comes around, that's the
[55:08] very route that God will take us. And
[55:10] because the doctors never healed
[55:12] anybody,
[55:13] &gt;&gt; all healing comes from God.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; But you see what it is, it's our and and
[55:18] I want to say this and and and just to
[55:20] give me the the liberty to SAY IT, IT'S
[55:23] MANY times our own pride that gets in
[55:24] the way that we place a a certain
[55:27] testimony of healing up here where
[55:30] nobody needed surgery and then we place
[55:32] the one down here of surgery. Let me
[55:34] just tell you the prophet under THE HOLY
[55:36] SPIRIT PUT THEM on equal ground. And
[55:38] right over here in Erie, Pennsylvania,
[55:40] he said God performs miracles through
[55:44] surgeries.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; So this the MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, it was
[55:51] working. You see, it's the character OF
[55:54] CHRIST THAT'S BEING REVEALED. THAT'S WHY
[55:56] THE PROPHET could say even clear back in
[55:58] the message all things there. I believe
[56:00] it's in 62. And he's pointing ahead to
[56:03] the opening of the seals. AND HE SAYS,
[56:05] "OH, WHEN we get into the opening of
[56:07] those seals, it will be the revealing of
[56:11] the very character of Jesus Christ."
[56:14] THIS IS WHY THE prophet when he he he
[56:17] reminds us of this in come follow me in
[56:20] 6063 June June of 63. And he also will
[56:24] say it again. He says that when the
[56:27] coming of this ministry will not be so
[56:31] much a change in the ministry as it will
[56:35] be a change in the man.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; So the ministry OF THE THIRD POOL WAS
[56:41] NOT A CHANGE OF MINISTRY. IT WAS A
[56:44] CHANGE OF THE MAN.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; GOD CHANGING THE MAN TO FIT THE
[56:49] MINISTRY. AMEN.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; SEE, THAT'S THE WHOLE THING THAT THAT
[56:53] THAT'S WHAT GOD'S WORKING ON IS TO
[56:55] BECAUSE WITH THE UNION OF A BRIDE IN
[56:58] CHRIST, WHAT A union is to be, ONLY GOD
[57:01] CAN CAN take and and and take two and
[57:04] say 1 + 1 EQUALS ONE. IN ORDER FOR THAT
[57:08] TO HAPPEN, even when you look
[57:09] mathematically, THERE HAS TO BE A
[57:11] POSITIVE and a negative for there to be
[57:14] one remaining. AND SO A GOD and a and a
[57:17] people so coming together to where it
[57:20] would be able to be identified THAT SHE
[57:23] IS BONE OF HIS BONE, FLESH OF HIS flesh
[57:25] and the prophet said she is him.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; SO IT'S HIS CHARACTER, it's his life.
[57:33] And so this is why that even when we
[57:36] look at look look at the scripture to
[57:39] know what we have BEEN CALLED TO THE
[57:41] PROPHET WILL TAKE THIS portion of
[57:43] scripture and he'll preach it in
[57:45] unveiling of God mighty God unveiled
[57:47] before us and all the way through the
[57:50] identification messages also identified
[57:52] with Christ BECAUSE TO BE IDENTIFIED
[57:56] JUST LIKE ALL OF THOSE WHO have lived
[57:59] before all the true elect believers they
[58:02] were identified by the word of God that
[58:05] God gave in that hour. AND HOW WERE THEY
[58:08] identified with it? By their submission
[58:11] to the word and allowing the word to
[58:14] have preeminence in their life. The word
[58:16] was there to identify that they were
[58:19] believers.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; That's the same way it is within you and
[58:22] I. It's it's the ability that God has
[58:26] placed within you and I to be able to
[58:28] see him. The prophet says it like this
[58:30] in spiritual food and due season. He
[58:32] said there the gift in me and it's the
[58:34] gift in you. And he said as the word is
[58:36] COMING HE SAID THAT OPENS up a secret
[58:39] channel right there. And he said what's
[58:41] happening is there's a feeding that's
[58:44] going on in that time. While others it
[58:46] can just go right over. But there's a
[58:48] channel that's opening and there's a
[58:50] feeding that's taking place. THAT THAT'S
[58:53] WHY WHEN we're looking at the word we're
[58:55] not just we're not just HEARING A WORD.
[58:57] WE'RE NOT JUST WE'RE NOT LIKE IT WAS
[58:59] LIKE was was recorded in the Sardisian
[59:02] age where the prophet said that time
[59:03] under Luther not Luther but men who came
[59:06] under that brother Ram said in the
[59:08] church age book he said there was enough
[59:10] truth in that in that age for for for
[59:13] for there to set forth a millennium but
[59:15] men he said begin to take the truth and
[59:19] study it in order to debate it instead
[59:23] of living it. SO THEY THEY THEY CAME IN
[59:26] CONTACT WITH TRUTH, BUT THEY NEVER GOT
[59:28] UNDER THE ANOINTING OF THE person of
[59:30] truth.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; SEE, THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT WITH THIS
[59:34] MESSAGE THAT IT'S NOT JUST ENOUGH TO
[59:37] KNOW THE MESSAGE, BUT TO COME UNDER THE
[59:39] ANOINTING OF THE MESSAGE BECAUSE THE
[59:41] MESSAGE is the anointing and the word is
[59:44] THE ANOINTING. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
[59:46] THE QUICKENING POWER, THE HOLY SPIRIT.
[59:49] BECAUSE WHEN WE GET UNDER THAT
[59:50] ANOINTING, THEN WE'RE GOING TO SEE
[59:52] THINGS THE WAY GOD WANTS US TO SEE IT.
[59:54] AND there's being a real examining in
[59:56] our life and a reflection of Jesus
[59:58] Christ.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; So notice he humbled himself and became
[1:00:03] obedient unto death. Even the death of
[1:00:06] the cross he became.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Remember he the Bible says that he he he
[1:00:14] in Hebrews 5:7 that he was heard in that
[1:00:17] he feared.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; HE KNEW WHAT AWAITED HIM. THAT WAS NOT A
[1:00:21] PLAY on words. He the Bible SAYS IN JOHN
[1:00:25] 12, "MY SOUL IS TROUBLED."
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T THAT HE WOULD BE LOST. HE KNEW
[1:00:29] WHAT AWAITED HIM. AND HE ALSO KNEW THE
[1:00:31] PURPOSE HE WAS CALLED TO.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT? He would say that
[1:00:36] through THE SCRIPTURES. BUT TO NOTICE TO
[1:00:38] BECOME OBEDIENT unto death. Here he is
[1:00:41] even in the garden of Gethsemane
[1:00:44] wrestling it out.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Showing remember I I love how the
[1:00:48] scripture goes on in Hebrews 5 to say
[1:00:51] that he learned obedience
[1:00:55] by the things that HE SUFFERED.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OBEDIENCE HAS A PRICE.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; YES, IT DOES. OBEDIENCE IS NOT JUST
[1:01:03] SOMETHING THAT'S A GIVEN. YOU KNOW, AND
[1:01:06] YOU UNDERSTAND AS A CHILD OF GOD THAT
[1:01:09] OUR BIGGEST BATTLE IS WITH OURSELVES.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; It's with OUR OWN WILL.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID HE WAS
[1:01:16] CONTENDING WITH HIMSELF. GOD SO
[1:01:19] SUBJECTED HIMSELF TO BECOME ONE OF US TO
[1:01:22] WHERE HERE THE LORD JESUS COULD SAY,
[1:01:24] "NEVERTHELESS, NOT MY WILL, THY WILL BE
[1:01:26] DONE." AMEN.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; GOD WOULD SO SUBJECT TO WHERE HE WOULD
[1:01:30] BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND YOU AND I AND BE
[1:01:33] able to minister TO YOU AND I. LET ME
[1:01:35] JUST say this friends. IF THE LORD JESUS
[1:01:38] HAD TO PRAY EARNESTLY AND IT WAS FOR
[1:01:40] THREE TIMES AND THE BIBLE SAYS IT BECAME
[1:01:44] OBEDIENT UNTO DEATH, THEN HOW MUCH MORE
[1:01:47] THE SPIRIT OF GOD DEALING WITH YOU and
[1:01:49] your your LIFE AND MY LIFE. IT MIGHT
[1:01:51] TAKE THIS SERVICE, ANOTHER SERVICE,
[1:01:53] ANOTHER SERVICE. IT MIGHT TAKE A WHOLE
[1:01:55] COLLECTION OF SERVICES TOGETHER, BUT
[1:01:57] WHAT'S HAPPENING IS GOD IS BRINGING
[1:02:00] ABOUT IN our life AN OBEDIENCE AND A
[1:02:03] DYING TO SELF.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; AND SOMETIMES WE CAN GET FRUSTRATED IN
[1:02:08] THE MIX CUZ WE DON'T SEE IT SEEM LIKE
[1:02:10] IT'S KICKING IN or it's WORKING FAST
[1:02:12] ENOUGH AND WE FEEL LIKE, WELL, I got the
[1:02:14] same battle. I GOT THE SAME ISSUE. BUT
[1:02:16] DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE WORD of God.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; THE WORD OF GOD IS WORKING IN THAT HOUR.
[1:02:22] AND REMEMBER when he prayed and there
[1:02:24] were angels that came and ministered to
[1:02:27] him AFTER IT WAS ALL FINISHED.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; AND GOD KNOWS, LISTEN, IT'S NOT
[1:02:32] SOMETHING, WELL, IT'S JUST EASY. NO,
[1:02:34] WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THERE'S MANY
[1:02:37] THINGS THAT ARE DIFFICULT AND IT ISN'T
[1:02:39] THAT WE DON'T WANT TO PLEASE THE LORD,
[1:02:42] BUT WHERE THE THINGS THAT ARE THE MOST
[1:02:44] DIFFICULT IN OUR LIVES IS WHEN IT COMES
[1:02:46] TO THE MOLDING of our character. YEAH,
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE REAL CHALLENGE RIGHT THERE.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; THOSE ARE THE AREAS THAT THE SCRIBES AND
[1:02:55] PHARISEES WANTED TO SUBJUGATE AND AND
[1:02:58] AND AND you know, just kind of like give
[1:03:00] themselves an excuse. Well, WHO IS MY
[1:03:02] NEIGHBOR? THEY WANTED TO JUSTIFY
[1:03:04] THEMSELVES BECAUSE THAT IS DIFFICULT
[1:03:07] WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO THE CHARACTER OF
[1:03:10] CHRIST BECAUSE A CHARACTER IS NOT a
[1:03:12] gift.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is the gift of God.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. The character is a victory.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; That is so good.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; So God is taking this in this life right
[1:03:26] now to mold us and prepare us for that
[1:03:30] which is to come.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; And so this is this servant is one who
[1:03:34] will give himself up to another's will.
[1:03:36] Gives himself up to another's will.
[1:03:38] those whose service is used by Christ in
[1:03:41] extending and advancing his cause among
[1:03:45] men devoted to another to the disregard
[1:03:49] of one's own interest.
[1:03:52] I want to say he made a way that you and
[1:03:55] I could come fully to this
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; because you could study very deeply
[1:04:01] among the prophets. Not one of them came
[1:04:04] [clears throat] to this place.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yet each of them were
[1:04:07] displaying a part of him. That's no
[1:04:10] disregard. They did not have they did
[1:04:13] not have access to the indwelling of the
[1:04:17] Holy Spirit of the new birth that you
[1:04:19] and I have. It would come on them. It
[1:04:21] would leave come and it would leave. But
[1:04:24] now THROUGH CHRIST, HE'S THE FIRST OF
[1:04:28] THIS NEW CREATION.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. REMEMBER ON WHOM THOU SEETH
[1:04:32] THE SPIRIT DESCEND AND remain
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; the same is he.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE CREATION OF
[1:04:40] GOD.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. So then we come to this here
[1:04:46] in in the book of Matthew, a familiar
[1:04:48] scripture. And knowing that how that the
[1:04:50] Lord Jesus would so surrender his life,
[1:04:54] the prophet said he surrendered his
[1:04:56] natural parts. He surrendered his
[1:04:58] thinking. He surrendered his own cares.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; I do only that which
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; pleases the father.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; He even had a he had the he had the
[1:05:09] right and I want you just to listen this
[1:05:11] for a moment. Very familiar parts. The
[1:05:14] prophet would say he takes the scripture
[1:05:16] I sanctify myself for thy sake. He had a
[1:05:19] right to have a home a right to be
[1:05:22] married a right to good clothes but he
[1:05:25] sanctified himself or rather forfeited.
[1:05:28] HE FORFEITED HIS RIGHTS.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; He could have come down corridors of
[1:05:33] glory, fully statured man, Allan an
[1:05:36] angelic band, but he sanctified himself.
[1:05:39] Many, many, many other places he said
[1:05:41] that we could go, but he he did this
[1:05:43] because HE WAS TRAINING NOT ONLY IN
[1:05:46] REDEMPTION, but he was training those
[1:05:48] that was going to follow him. Yeah, it's
[1:05:50] so good.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; And this is where when the scripture
[1:05:54] we're familiar with this passage where
[1:05:56] after the uh sons of thunder and you
[1:05:59] know their mother had asked you know
[1:06:01] grant that one will set on the left and
[1:06:02] one on the right and you know then this
[1:06:04] caused some contention among the the
[1:06:07] disciples there and man it got it got
[1:06:09] things heated well you know who's going
[1:06:11] to be the greatest and I'm going to be
[1:06:13] the greatest and all it all that did was
[1:06:16] expose that human nature that was there.
[1:06:20] The same way when they were waiting in
[1:06:22] the upper room, it exposed human nature
[1:06:25] with trying to place something in or put
[1:06:30] something in place instead of waiting on
[1:06:32] God. Remember they had all the
[1:06:34] qualifications who will take the place
[1:06:36] of Judas and they laid Peter Peter laid
[1:06:39] these different qualifica. It must be
[1:06:41] this and it must be that and it must be
[1:06:43] that. AND HERE IT COMES INTO a man by
[1:06:46] the name of Mias. YOU DON'T READ ONE
[1:06:48] TIME.
[1:06:50] IN the scripture where God ever used
[1:06:51] that man.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; NOW, I'M NOT SAYING that he didn't use
[1:06:55] Matias in SOME WAY, BUT HE WASN'T
[1:06:57] ACCORDING TO WHAT THEY WERE THINKING.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; GOD ALREADY KNEW PAUL IS GOING TO FIT IN
[1:07:03] THAT PLACE
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; AS MY APOSTLE.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; GOD ALREADY KNEW THAT.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE, EVEN IN THAT, YOU CAN SEE
[1:07:11] GOD OVERLOOKING THE HUMANITY. SO, DON'T
[1:07:14] LOOK DOWN ON PETER. GOD HAS OVERLOOKED
[1:07:17] OUR HUMANITY. THERE'S MANY THINGS THAT
[1:07:19] WE THOUGHT THIS WILL GO HERE AND THIS
[1:07:21] WILL GO HERE. BUT GOD OVERLOOKS THE
[1:07:25] HUMANITY AND HE JUST SIMPLY REVEALS HIS
[1:07:28] WORD. AND WHEN HIS WORD IS REVEALED JUST
[1:07:31] AS A MAGNET WILL RESPOND TO ANOTHER, YOU
[1:07:35] ARE ORDAINED to respond to this word.
[1:07:40] [applause and cheering]
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; It really takes it out of our hands,
[1:07:44] don't it? It puts the grace of God so
[1:07:46] high and lifted up.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; And this is where when the when when the
[1:07:50] Lord Jesus he established even even on
[1:07:54] his expression and being here even as
[1:07:57] the son of man came not to be ministered
[1:08:00] unto but to minister it's to serve and
[1:08:03] to give his life a ransom for many. SO
[1:08:08] WE COULD ALSO LOOK at the life of the
[1:08:10] Lord Jesus as he would even express
[1:08:13] about the lily and the lily is really a
[1:08:17] PUBLIC SERVANT. THE PROPHET would would
[1:08:19] take would go through examples in the
[1:08:22] message and speak of how that the gift
[1:08:24] within his life even you remember when
[1:08:26] he was laying there on the uh the road
[1:08:29] in um right outside of Amarillo and I
[1:08:32] brother Jeremy took me right by the
[1:08:33] hospital where he was at when he passed
[1:08:35] where brother Brandham had passed and
[1:08:36] and but he's laying out there on the
[1:08:38] road remember he he he he asked Billy
[1:08:42] put my hand on mama
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; right amen
[1:08:48] THE GIFT WAS NOT FOR HIMSELF.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; It was not for himself. AND THIS IS WHY
[1:08:53] THAT BROTHER BRANDON WOULD TALK ABOUT he
[1:08:55] said that it's the benefit of the gift
[1:08:58] is for you. I am a public servant.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; It's not about me. HE AND EVEN SAID IT
[1:09:04] BROTHER BRAND WILL SAY IT COUNTLESS
[1:09:05] TIMES. HE SAYS there's things that even
[1:09:07] he'll say this in many places of the
[1:09:09] message. One of them is even in kinsman
[1:09:11] redeemer where if somebody says brother
[1:09:13] Brandham I guess you know before
[1:09:14] anything happens you know all about it.
[1:09:16] And brother Brandham says, "No, no, no,
[1:09:18] no, no. The gift is not for me. I can't
[1:09:20] use it for myself. You're the one that
[1:09:22] gets the benefit, not me. I'M JUST A
[1:09:25] PUBLIC SERVANT OF God to you."
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; That's good. And brother Ramy
[1:09:31] establishes why that even where a
[1:09:33] minister will study and he's praying and
[1:09:36] he's waiting ON GOD TO TRY TO find that
[1:09:40] leading of the Lord for for the PEOPLE
[1:09:43] BECAUSE THERE'S THERE'S MANY WONDERFUL
[1:09:45] things that could be spoken. There's
[1:09:47] many wonderful things, friends. We're
[1:09:49] we're not in any shortage. It's finding
[1:09:51] the mind of the Lord.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; And just sharing a little bit and maybe
[1:09:55] I'll share it just in this regards. I if
[1:09:58] if anybody would have asked me on Sunday
[1:10:00] morning walking in there to uh the the
[1:10:03] assembly up there to brother John's and
[1:10:04] I've had it happen to me a few time a
[1:10:07] few some times usually a lot of times
[1:10:09] even when I'm out but I've had it happen
[1:10:10] here but I I I I was ready to go. I I
[1:10:14] thought my you know this this whole
[1:10:16] channel is really inspired and so forth.
[1:10:18] And then just a moment in the office and
[1:10:23] there was a brother that come in and we
[1:10:24] were talking and shook his hand and
[1:10:26] began to just just greet him and so
[1:10:28] forth. And then you know brother John
[1:10:31] had wanted me to come out when he was
[1:10:33] just kind of you know going over the
[1:10:34] fourth year anniversary of the people
[1:10:36] and we were going to pray over brother
[1:10:37] Steve Clar on before he depart to India
[1:10:40] and and we're and I'm standing back
[1:10:42] there and I'm saying oh god where do I
[1:10:45] even go this morning because it was like
[1:10:47] everything that was so inspired it just
[1:10:49] I knew I knew I could I could I could
[1:10:51] force it but it won't it won't go
[1:10:53] nowhere.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; It it'll be it'll be like an airplane
[1:10:56] with a blunt end a paper airplane. it is
[1:10:58] it'll just nose dive.
[1:11:00] You say, "How do you know that?" Done it
[1:11:02] before.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Start out in one way and but God
[1:11:06] prepares us and works with our lives and
[1:11:08] and teaches us and and so as I was
[1:11:11] standing back there and I was just was
[1:11:12] waiting. I was praying and the Holy
[1:11:14] Spirit just spoke to my heart and said,
[1:11:16] "Follow me."
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; I don't know where I was going. I had no
[1:11:20] idea. So, I just opened up and I began
[1:11:22] to read uh Job chapter 23 again. And the
[1:11:26] very first few first first few verses of
[1:11:28] of of the scripture is where it begin to
[1:11:31] inspire my heart. If I can have just a
[1:11:34] moment with him,
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; if I can find him in that moment in that
[1:11:38] service, how the Lord just moved within
[1:11:43] such a marvelous way to where there were
[1:11:46] lives setting there that here there even
[1:11:49] comes a young man that DOESN'T KNOW ONE
[1:11:51] THING ABOUT serving the Lord. And even
[1:11:54] in the midst of the service, he goes
[1:11:56] out. Brother Steve actually goes out. I
[1:11:58] don't even know about it and he and he
[1:12:01] prays with that young man. They get down
[1:12:02] in the parking lot while the service is
[1:12:05] going on BECAUSE HE SAID, "THAT'S
[1:12:06] OVERWHELMING, isn't it?" And he said,
[1:12:08] "Yes." And all of THESE HAD JUST COME
[1:12:10] ROUGH ROUGH SOME ROUGH BACKGROUNDS AND
[1:12:12] THINGS. BUT GOD JUST DIDN'T DEAL WITH
[1:12:14] THAT SITUATION. THERE WERE MANY
[1:12:16] DIFFERENT THINGS. AND I WANT TO SAY
[1:12:18] THANK GOD FOR HIS GRACE THAT GOD BE SO
[1:12:21] MINDFUL. THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. AND WE
[1:12:24] MUST HAVE THAT AS A MINISTER. THERE'S
[1:12:26] MANY WONDERFUL THINGS THAT WE CAN
[1:12:28] MINISTER, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S
[1:12:30] ABOUT.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ABOUT PREACHING A SERMON.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; AND EVEN WHEN GOD'S GIVEN NOTES WITHIN
[1:12:37] THINGS, IT'S STILL IT'S NOT ABOUT TRYING
[1:12:39] TO PREACH SOMETHING AND JUST TO PREACH A
[1:12:41] SERMON. IT'S ABOUT WHAT ARE THE NEEDS OF
[1:12:44] THE PEOPLE, LORD?
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; What are the needs of THE PEOPLE?
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; AND I THANK GOD FOR HIS GRACE. SOMETIMES
[1:12:51] GOD HAS to take us through moldings and
[1:12:54] training and TEACHING JUST FOR MOMENTS
[1:12:56] LIKE THIS. AND LISTEN, WE WE LEARN
[1:12:59] THROUGH THE TRAININGS THAT GOD BRINGS US
[1:13:01] THROUGH JUST FOR MOMENTS LIKE THAT, JUST
[1:13:04] TO RELY UPON HIM, JUST to rest upon him.
[1:13:07] And so as a public servant, you know,
[1:13:10] you you JUST YOU GIVE YOURSELF OUT. AND
[1:13:12] I DON'T WANT TO JUST CONFINE THAT TO THE
[1:13:14] LORD JESUS. I DON'T WANT TO CONFINE THAT
[1:13:16] TO JUST A MINISTER BUT I WANT TO BRING
[1:13:18] IT DOWN TO YOU BECAUSE THE PROPHET takes
[1:13:21] you and me in the message how can
[1:13:23] overcome and he expresses that our lives
[1:13:26] are liies.
[1:13:28] We were born underneath the mud and gunk
[1:13:31] and in the pond. But God quickening,
[1:13:34] quickening, quickening, quickening, has
[1:13:35] raised us up. AND THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF
[1:13:37] RAISING IT up is so that life
[1:13:42] might be given.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; To others,
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; so that it would be an expression
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; to others.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; That's the whole purpose of of your
[1:13:51] life. And don't ever underestimate your
[1:13:54] influence.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; And it isn't that you always have to be
[1:13:57] saying something. you. True. There's
[1:13:58] times to say things, but your life,
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; it speaks.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; It speaks.
[1:14:06] And so within this liberty,
[1:14:09] I want to just take this this scripture
[1:14:11] here just for a moment
[1:14:13] and notice how Paul writes this in the
[1:14:16] book of Galatians. He says, "For
[1:14:18] brethren, ye have been called unto
[1:14:21] liberty.
[1:14:23] only use not liberty for an occasion to
[1:14:28] the flesh, but by love serve one
[1:14:33] another.
[1:14:34] For all the law is fulfilled in one
[1:14:36] word. Even in this, thou shalt love thy
[1:14:39] neighbor
[1:14:40] as thyself.
[1:14:43] But if you bite and devour one another,
[1:14:45] take heed that you be not consumed
[1:14:49] one of another.
[1:14:51] And then Paul gives the remedy. Walk in
[1:14:54] the spirit and you shall not fulfill the
[1:14:56] lust of THE FLESH. NOTICE PAUL never
[1:14:58] never gave them a false expectation to
[1:15:01] say, "Well, you're no longer going to
[1:15:03] have the lust of the flesh." He said,
[1:15:05] "Walk in the spirit and THE LUST OR
[1:15:09] DESIRES OF THE FLESH are brought
[1:15:13] subject."
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND NOT JUST BROUGHT SUBJECT but
[1:15:18] you receive not only strength but
[1:15:21] there's A VISION OF CHRIST AND A
[1:15:23] FELLOWSHIP THAT YOU HAVE WITH HIM THAT
[1:15:27] AFFECTS when you come out because you
[1:15:30] really don't come out of the holies of
[1:15:31] holies but there's an effect of the do
[1:15:35] of his presence of the aroma of being in
[1:15:38] his presence of being in and just in
[1:15:41] PRAYER JUST JUST THE TIMES OF MEDITATION
[1:15:44] remember prayer Pray is not the position
[1:15:45] of your body.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; It's the connection of your heart with
[1:15:48] God.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; You can pray just as well with setting
[1:15:52] up many times as I'm out with just as I
[1:15:54] was here within this time in Washington.
[1:15:56] I'm I'm out early in the morning. I just
[1:15:58] I take off. I don't want to disturb my
[1:16:00] wife. So I'm out real early, go out and
[1:16:02] get a coffee and I go out and sit. I'll
[1:16:04] find somewhere to sit and pray and
[1:16:06] because I could sit right there and and
[1:16:08] just the presence of God and just
[1:16:10] praying about the meetings, praying
[1:16:11] about needs back here, praying about
[1:16:12] things. I I give you that example to
[1:16:14] show you that JUST TO ENCOURAGE YOU.
[1:16:16] DON'T LIMIT prayer to a POSITION OR TO
[1:16:19] EVEN WELL IN MY CLOSET. CLOSET IS NOT
[1:16:22] NECESSARILY JUST A CLOSET. YOU CAN HAVE
[1:16:25] A CLOSET. THAT'S FINE. YOU HAVE A PLACE
[1:16:27] YOU GET AWAY. I UNDERSTAND THAT. But let
[1:16:29] me just say it to you like this.
[1:16:31] Anywhere in any place where you can get
[1:16:33] away and alone with God.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, to be shut in with God.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Is that right? SO NOTICE PAUL IS IS
[1:16:42] GIVING US this is the victory of it. So
[1:16:44] if if WE'RE UNDER THE THOUGHT OR THE
[1:16:46] pretense of I'm going to get to a place
[1:16:49] where I'll never have these battles. No,
[1:16:51] the the battles will become more uh more
[1:16:54] apparent as as the based on where our
[1:16:58] fellowship is at with the Lord.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Now I want TO REMIND YOU, YOU COULD
[1:17:04] SPEND AN hour in prayer and not spend
[1:17:06] any time in prayer.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? BECAUSE IT'S NOT A
[1:17:10] TRADITION.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SPEND AN HOUR IN THE BIBLE AND
[1:17:14] NOT SPEND any time in the Bible.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SPEND AN hour listening to the
[1:17:18] message and not be any time in it.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, what is that?" IT'S
[1:17:22] ABOUT, "LORD, CONDITION MY HEART, LORD."
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THIS IS NOT ABOUT ANYTHING OF
[1:17:29] DUTY. IT'S ABOUT CONDITIONING OUR HEART
[1:17:31] THAT WHEN NO MATTER from reading the
[1:17:33] word, listening to THE MESSAGE IN TIMES
[1:17:35] OF PRAYER, THERE SHOULD BE AN EFFECT OF
[1:17:38] SWEETNESS AND RELEASE THAT THAT COMES
[1:17:41] UPON OUR LIFE TO WHERE WE RELEASE THE
[1:17:44] CARES AND THE BURDENS THAT WE'RE
[1:17:46] CARRYING, THE FEELINGS AND ALL OF THOSE
[1:17:48] things that want to weigh us down AND
[1:17:50] HINDER US FROM BEING A REAL SERVANT
[1:17:53] BEFORE GOD AND TO ONE ANOTHER. WE WANT
[1:17:56] TO BE ABLE to lay our burdens there.
[1:18:01] And I realize sometimes that's very
[1:18:02] difficult.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah. There's times where even as
[1:18:07] we've been in prayer and time the way
[1:18:10] that you know you have segments and
[1:18:12] things of time because not everyone has
[1:18:14] maybe a privilege or opportunity. We all
[1:18:15] have have different things of schedules
[1:18:17] and things that we have to do and tasks
[1:18:19] and so forth, meetings, appointments,
[1:18:21] things and whatever more. But yet within
[1:18:23] it all, what what is very very very
[1:18:25] important is always always placing your
[1:18:29] heart before God and examining your
[1:18:32] heart and letting and being real with
[1:18:34] that. Then Lord, Lord, remedy my heart.
[1:18:37] Lord, take anything contrary. Don't
[1:18:39] just, you know, we just don't want to,
[1:18:40] like I said, say what is the right thing
[1:18:42] because it's the right thing to say.
[1:18:44] God's not interested in that. HE SAW
[1:18:46] THAT with the Pharisees. He saw that
[1:18:49] with the Sadducees. God doesn't want
[1:18:51] religion. He wants our heart. SO EVEN IF
[1:18:54] OUR HEART IS NOT IN THE RIGHT PLACE, IF
[1:18:56] WE can at least SUBMIT IT TO GOD AND BE
[1:18:59] HONEST WITH GOD, IT MAY HAVE ONLY BEEN
[1:19:01] JUST A FEW MOMENTS, BUT WATCH WHAT WILL
[1:19:04] TAKE PLACE IN YOUR LIFE AS YOU DEPOSIT
[1:19:07] YOUR HEART INTO HIS HAND AND SAY, "GOD,
[1:19:10] YOU TOOK A LITTLE LAD'S LUNCH AND YOU
[1:19:12] MULTIPLIED IT. LORD, I GIVE YOU MY
[1:19:14] HEART. I DON'T WANT THIS FEELING IN MY
[1:19:16] HEART. I DON'T WANT THIS IN MY SPIRIT."
[1:19:18] AND YOU SUBMIT IT TO HIM AND WATCH what
[1:19:21] will take place. Hallelujah.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Bham takes that thought and
[1:19:25] says, "You do that in this service." And
[1:19:28] he said, "You watch as you will submit
[1:19:29] your heart in this service." He said,
[1:19:31] "You'll watch by the time just a few
[1:19:33] moments down the road, you'll find the
[1:19:35] Holy Spirit right in your life." G.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE THAT'S THE PRIVILEGE WE HAVE
[1:19:40] TO place it into God's hands.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; So, there's a liberty that we have to
[1:19:46] serve. And I I want to say it in that
[1:19:48] way, a liberty to serve because the
[1:19:51] scripture here says that we looked at
[1:19:54] brethren, you've been called to liberty.
[1:19:57] HOW MANY ARE thankful we've been called
[1:19:59] to liberty?
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; WE'VE BEEN CALLED TO WHAT is real true
[1:20:04] freedom and liberty in Jesus Christ.
[1:20:09] Who has brought that about? The blood of
[1:20:11] Jesus Christ has been shed for our sins
[1:20:15] AND THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS BROUGHT THAT
[1:20:19] REALITY to where there IS A LIBERTY.
[1:20:22] WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT WALKING WITH OUR
[1:20:24] HEAD OVER OUR shoulder wondering am I
[1:20:27] GOING TO BE TAKEN BACK INTO THAT THERE'S
[1:20:30] A LIBERTY. OUR DESIRE HAS BEEN CHANGED.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT THAT WE JUST DON'T WANT TO DO
[1:20:36] THE THINGS OF THE world anymore. BUT
[1:20:38] WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS COME, OUR
[1:20:40] DESIRE IS TO PLEASE HIM.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID IN THE
[1:20:45] MESSAGE, ONENESS. HE SAID, I'M CONVINCED
[1:20:49] THAT MANY OF US JUST RECEIVE ENOUGH OF
[1:20:52] THE HOLY SPIRIT TO WE DON'T WANT TO
[1:20:54] SMOKE. WE DON'T want to this. We don't.
[1:20:56] He said, as a MATTER OF FACT, WE DON'T
[1:20:57] WANT TO DO NOTHING.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, BUT GOD WANTS TO FILL EVERY
[1:21:02] FIBER.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; SEE, NOT JUST TO TAKE THE WANT OUT.
[1:21:06] THAT'S SANCTIFICATION. BUT WHERE THE
[1:21:08] DESIRE IS CHANGED AND TO WHERE THE HE'S
[1:21:12] I WANT TO JUST PLEASE HIM. THAT'S MY
[1:21:14] HEART'S DESIRE.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; AND TO PLEASE HIM, YES, WE'LL HAVE TO
[1:21:17] WRESTLE OUT OUR WILL BECAUSE IT WILL
[1:21:20] CALL UPON US SUBMITTING OUR CHARACTER
[1:21:23] BECAUSE WE AS HIM ARE LAMBS AS he was
[1:21:27] the lamb. We are lambs of God
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; and we are led
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; to the slaughter. Amen.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Always bearing about in the body the
[1:21:39] dying of the Lord Jesus that the life of
[1:21:42] the Lord Jesus might be made manifest.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; That is so good.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE BEEN BROUGHT UNTO LIBERTY ONLY.
[1:21:48] Use not liberty
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; for an occasion to the flesh, but by
[1:21:53] love serve one another. So I want to
[1:21:56] just I want to say it in this way.
[1:21:59] LIBERTY TO SERVE AND POSE THE QUESTION
[1:22:01] TO YOU. Can and is it possible liberty
[1:22:05] that we have to be used in the wrong
[1:22:08] way?
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Now I'm pulling this from scripture. Now
[1:22:12] let me just give you a little bit here.
[1:22:14] WE RECOGNIZE THAT GOD DOESN'T make us do
[1:22:18] nothing.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; It's not by works.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Come on. That that we have done.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; IT'S BY THE SOVEREIGN GRACE OF GOD.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN. CUZ YOU COULD SIT HERE AND have
[1:22:32] works either that are missed OR THINGS
[1:22:34] THAT HAVE BEEN DONE THAT YOU COULD SIT
[1:22:36] HERE AND BATTLE IN YOUR MIND. BUT WHEN
[1:22:39] YOU RECOGNIZE THAT YOUR WORKS, NO MATTER
[1:22:42] WHICH WAY THEY WHICH WAY IT WOULD GO,
[1:22:44] EVEN IN YOUR FAILURES, LET ME NARROW IT
[1:22:46] DOWN TO THAT OF YOUR MISTAKES, THAT DOES
[1:22:48] NOT TAKE AWAY THE GRACE OF GOD BECAUSE
[1:22:51] THE GRACE OF GOD BY THE HOLY SPIRIT SAYS
[1:22:54] HE IS YOUR PROPITUATION.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YEAH.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHY YOU NEEDED AN ADVOCATE.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; THAT'S GOOD.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST DID NOT COME TO MAKE YOU
[1:23:05] A PERFECT PERSON. IT DID NOT COME TO
[1:23:08] MAKE YOU A SINLESS PERSON. BUT WHAT IT
[1:23:10] DID, IT CAME TO REDEEM YOU AND RAISE UP
[1:23:13] THAT ON THE INSIDE THAT SAYS, "I ONLY
[1:23:17] WANT TO PLEASE GOD." HALLELUJAH.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; IT'S THAT ON THE INSIDE THAT WILL CAUSE
[1:23:22] YOU TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORD ABOVE YOUR
[1:23:24] OWN FEELINGS AND SAID, "THY WORD
[1:23:26] [screaming] IS RIGHT." [cheering]
[1:23:30] IT'S THAT ON THE INSIDE, LIKE THE
[1:23:32] PROPHET SAID, THAT WHEN YOU'VE DONE
[1:23:33] WRONG IN THE ADOPTION SERIES, HE SAID IT
[1:23:36] WOULDN'T MATTER IF YOU HAD TO STAND
[1:23:37] BEFORE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
[1:23:39] STATES AND SAY, "I'M [screaming] WRONG."
[1:23:41] YOU DO IT.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE RIGHT AND
[1:23:46] PLEASING WITH GOD.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT SERVING HIM UNDER THE THREAT
[1:23:51] OF A BROWN LOOKING DOWN AND AND THEN NO,
[1:23:55] THAT'S NOT HOW YOU'RE SERVING HIM. OH, I
[1:23:57] BETTER DO THIS IF I DON'T DO THIS.
[1:23:58] YOU'RE NOT SERVING HIM THAT WAY.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Samuel, that creates
[1:24:03] looseness. No. I think the meaning we're
[1:24:06] wanting to say here is it brings liberty
[1:24:10] to the sons of God.
[1:24:12] Looseness is lasciviousness
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; WHERE THEY PREACH GRACE with no no
[1:24:20] change being produced.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; That's lasciviousness.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; That's loose religion.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; BUT THE REAL GRACE OF GOD COMES TO SAY
[1:24:29] YOU'RE NOT WORTHY. YOU CAN NEVER BE
[1:24:31] WORTHY. BUT I AM YOUR WORTHINESS.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO WAY THAT YOU COULD EVER
[1:24:38] ATTAIN IT. BUT MY BLOOD HAS MADE A WAY.
[1:24:41] YOU WERE ALWAYS [screaming] MINE. AND
[1:24:43] THE HOLY SPIRIT COMES AS THE GRACE OF
[1:24:45] GOD TO LET YOU KNOW THIS IS WHAT BELONGS
[1:24:48] TO YOU. THIS IS WHAT SATAN WANTED TO ROB
[1:24:51] FROM YOU. BUT YOU'RE A SON AND DAUGHTER
[1:24:52] OF GOD.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S HE DOING? Ministering liberty.
[1:24:59] [cheering]
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; So it's a liberty to serve. Amen.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; And that liberty, as I mentioned, is it
[1:25:14] possible that liberty could be used or
[1:25:20] not used or used in the wrong way
[1:25:25] because just just stay with me now.
[1:25:27] Don't don't tune me out. Stay with me.
[1:25:30] Brother Brandham makes a statement
[1:25:31] because Paul's not the only one who
[1:25:33] makes a statement like this. Peter does.
[1:25:34] And I'll get to it in a minute.
[1:25:37] Paul, brother Brandham makes this
[1:25:39] statement and he lets us know. He says,
[1:25:42] "You're you're saved by God's grace."
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; The things that you do, like he said,
[1:25:48] you're not saved by your clothes.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; That's not the end of the quote.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; That's not the end of that quote. HE'S
[1:25:56] LETTING US KNOW. HE SAID, "IF THAT WAS
[1:25:58] THE CASE, GOD HAS SENT DOWN some
[1:25:59] patterns."
[1:26:03] But you see what happens is
[1:26:06] you do in appreciation.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Your works are not trying to merit. It's
[1:26:12] out of appreciation.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; So they're not it's not it's not it's
[1:26:16] not well, you know, it's got to be this.
[1:26:18] YOU DO IT OUT OF APPRECIATION. AND
[1:26:20] THAT'S WHY WE are saved by the grace of
[1:26:22] God.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; No wonder, brother Bannon, when he
[1:26:25] preaches the message of grace, he said,
[1:26:26] "Oh, how the devil hates this message of
[1:26:29] grace." He said, "If there's one thing
[1:26:31] I've been gotten after so much, it's
[1:26:33] preaching grace."
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. That's what this message
[1:26:39] is. Grace. Grace.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. UNTO A PEOPLE
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; THAT GOD HAS COME DOWN TO SEAL OFF, TO
[1:26:47] CAP, AND TO DRAW UP INTO HIM IN ALL
[1:26:50] THINGS.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:53] AMEN.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said, "If I never preach
[1:26:56] another sermon in my life, live 150
[1:26:59] years, I'm still saved."
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; I'M SAVED BECAUSE IT'S GOD'S GRACE THAT
[1:27:03] SAVED ME.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Paul even talked about, you know, HOW
[1:27:08] EVEN HIMSELF PREACHING THE GOSPEL, he
[1:27:11] said, "I I don't have anything to glory.
[1:27:13] Necessity is laid upon me. Woe in me if
[1:27:15] I don't preach."
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; But if I do this thing willingly, I have
[1:27:18] a reward if I do it willingly.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Right? That's a key,
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; if I do it willingly.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; PAUL COULD HAVE KEPT on running,
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; A man can RUN AND RUN AND RUN FROM WHAT
[1:27:30] GOD IS CALLING HIM TO DO. AND GOD WILL
[1:27:32] ALLOW THE MAN TO RUN. YOU SAY, "WHY
[1:27:35] WOULD GOD DO THAT?" CUZ HE WANTS
[1:27:36] SUBMISSION,
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; because you know why? Anything that God
[1:27:43] ask of you and I to do, it's got to be
[1:27:45] from the heart.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; That's good. So God allow this and allow
[1:27:50] that and this and this and this because
[1:27:52] he he's he's going TO GET IT TO A PLACE
[1:27:55] to where we we submit. And if Paul said
[1:27:57] if I do it willingly I have a reward but
[1:28:00] if I against my will a dispensation of
[1:28:03] the gospel is committed to me. SO PAUL
[1:28:05] IS DOING it willingly to preach the
[1:28:07] gospel.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:28:10] But Paul wasn't even consulted
[1:28:13] about whether a dispensation of the
[1:28:17] gospel would be laid on him. He wasn't
[1:28:20] consulted. Paul, how do you feel about
[1:28:21] going among the Gentiles? He wasn't
[1:28:23] consulted. Paul, how do you feel about
[1:28:25] being a light to the Gentiles? How do
[1:28:28] you feel, Paul? He wasn't consulted.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; This was a man who was a Pharisee of the
[1:28:34] Pharisees.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Okay. this wasn't THE HE WAS SERIOUS IN
[1:28:40] WHAT HE BELIEVED
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD TOOK THAT AND CHANNELED IT AND
[1:28:44] PAUL WILLINGLY PREACHED THE GOSPEL BUT
[1:28:47] WHAT WAS HE DID NOT HE HE DIDN'T DESIRE
[1:28:51] THAT BURDEN to a dispensation of the
[1:28:54] gospel to be committed to him this is
[1:28:56] why that brother Brandham would pick
[1:28:58] this up over and over perfect strength
[1:29:00] in other places and it's very true
[1:29:03] when you see individuals vying for
[1:29:07] positions.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; That's a sign it's not fit for it.
[1:29:14] Because if you see that you're fit for
[1:29:16] it, you're actually unfit.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; That's why a person says, "Well, I could
[1:29:23] make a good this or I could make a good
[1:29:24] this." No.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; You You love them. You appreciate them,
[1:29:28] BUT THERE NEEDS BECAUSE WHY? IT'S GOT TO
[1:29:30] BE FROM THE HEART. AMEN.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOT TO BE FROM THE HEART WHERE A
[1:29:33] PERSON IS NOT RELYING UPON THEIR OWN
[1:29:36] ABILITY,
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; EVEN AS GOD WILL TAKE A MINISTER that
[1:29:41] could be very young and very youthful
[1:29:43] AND SO FORTH. BUT GOD HAS TO TEMPER THAT
[1:29:45] MAN AND WORK WITH THAT MAN AND HE'LL
[1:29:47] WORK THROUGHOUT THE TIMES BRINGING HIM
[1:29:50] TO A PLACE OF CONTINUAL SUBMISSION.
[1:29:52] That's why brother Bram says God has a
[1:29:55] hard time using anyone that'll stay
[1:29:57] humble
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; because you know why they get to looking
[1:30:02] at what's been done and fail to
[1:30:04] recognize you're no more than the wrench
[1:30:08] or the screwdriver. It's whose hand
[1:30:10] you're in
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; and who has the ability behind it.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; See, that's the key within every one of
[1:30:16] our lives. Even when IT COMES TO
[1:30:18] HUSBAND, WIFE, FATHER, MOTHER. YES,
[1:30:21] THOSE ATTRIBUTES ARE IN OUR LIFE, BUT
[1:30:23] BUT IT'S NOT MEANT FOR US TO TAKE THEM
[1:30:26] AND TRY TO TRY TO SOMEHOW MASTER THAT.
[1:30:29] BUT IT'S meant for us to yield ourselves
[1:30:31] into God's hands.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; You say, "What creates that yielding?"
[1:30:36] His love.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; The grace of God being projected. Right?
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; If I do this willingly,
[1:30:45] Brother Ram says, you know, he says in
[1:30:47] the thinking man's filter, he said, I'd
[1:30:49] like to sit out there in the
[1:30:50] congregation and just listen to somebody
[1:30:52] else preach. How much easier it would be
[1:30:55] on me. Now, he makes this statement in
[1:30:57] thinking man's filter, paragraph 187,
[1:31:00] one, two, three, four, five. One, two,
[1:31:04] three, four, five, five times. How easy
[1:31:07] it would be on me. It would be easier
[1:31:09] for me to do that. It would be easier
[1:31:10] for me to do that. IT WOULD BE EASIER
[1:31:12] FIVE TIMES
[1:31:15] BECAUSE THIS MESSAGE, YOU KNOW, we so
[1:31:18] appreciate the message that God has
[1:31:20] delivered to us, but think about
[1:31:24] everything that had to be done.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; In order for you and I TO RECEIVE THE
[1:31:30] BENEFIT OF THIS,
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; it it he knew. REMEMBER WHEN BROTHER
[1:31:34] BRANDHAM EVEN STANDING THERE PREACHING
[1:31:36] THE SEALS AND HE TURNS OFF think well
[1:31:38] where they think the one's been turned
[1:31:39] off but it keeps going somewhere I've
[1:31:42] been there and looked at where those
[1:31:43] recorders and how that would have been
[1:31:44] set up and you hear him he's turned it
[1:31:46] off but it ain't turned off and remember
[1:31:47] what he says I know I'll lose many of
[1:31:50] friends from this
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; right
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; is that right
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; many many because of what BECAUSE OF
[1:31:56] WHAT THE TRUTH THAT HE WAS STANDING ON
[1:31:59] BECAUSE THIS MESSAGE THE MESSAGE IS NOT
[1:32:02] POPULAR
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE message is Christ.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD REVEALED. IT'S GOD NOW BROUGHT
[1:32:10] PRESENT TENSE. IT'S COMFORTABLE TO
[1:32:12] BELIEVE IN A JESUS 2,000 YEARS AGO.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; THERE YOU GO.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; IT'S EVEN COMFORTABLE TO BELIEVE IN A
[1:32:20] JESUS WHO CAN COME AND HEAL IN THE
[1:32:22] HOSPITAL. BUT NOW, LET'S BRING THAT
[1:32:24] JESUS CUZ THERE'S MORE ATTRIBUTES
[1:32:26] BESIDES JUST HEALER. LET'S BRING IT DOWN
[1:32:28] FOR WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT. AND THAT WAS
[1:32:31] THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE LIFE ETERNAL AND TO
[1:32:34] CHANGE YOUR LIFE.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; THEN THAT'S WHERE YOU SEE, DO THEY
[1:32:39] REALLY WANT JESUS?
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Now listen, some they're not ordained.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; And you're not going to make anybody.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; So you that's not serving them either.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; What must I do? Shine the light in
[1:32:57] humility.
[1:33:00] wait for opportunities.
[1:33:02] Brother Brandman says it like this in
[1:33:03] here. He said, "If you love your wife,
[1:33:06] you want to do something for her." He
[1:33:08] said, "It's like a man that you see and
[1:33:10] you tell John, John, let's go fishing."
[1:33:11] Because he likes fishing. He said, "You
[1:33:13] talk to him about the weather, talk to
[1:33:15] him about THE FISH, AND THEN YOU WAIT,
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; for God to open that door."
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; I wish I had more time.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; You say you do next Thursday,
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; but I got to wait till next Thursday.
[1:33:29] BUT WAITING FOR GOD TO OPEN THAT DOOR
[1:33:31] DOES NOT MEAN CALLING FOR THE SWAT TEAM.
[1:33:34] And let's get it down, boys.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you
[1:33:42] with liberty to serve, are you willing,
[1:33:46] if that man is open, that person is
[1:33:49] open, are you willing to labor with them
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; and talk about fish? Sure.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; When you see their heart and building a
[1:33:58] relationship
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; where their heart is becoming tender
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; and just waiting on God and praying for
[1:34:06] him, don't be anxious.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to stop here tonight.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; I know, man. I didn't even get to where
[1:34:23] I was at.
[1:34:25] I know that's how I feel. And now I got
[1:34:27] to go to sleep on this.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; There's still that thought. Is it
[1:34:33] possible that as Paul wrote in Galatians
[1:34:36] 5, the liberty that we've been called to
[1:34:39] and the liberty that we have, is it
[1:34:41] possible that we could use liberty for
[1:34:44] an occasion to the flesh? To take the
[1:34:47] the genuine liberty of the Holy Spirit
[1:34:50] that God has given us in our hearts and
[1:34:52] use it for an occasion to
[1:34:54] Brother Brham said, "If I never preach
[1:34:56] again, I'm still saved.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; If I don't do nothing, I'm still going
[1:35:03] to make it.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; I don't have to put up with this. I
[1:35:09] don't have to.
[1:35:12] Is it possible that liberty could be
[1:35:16] used for an occasion to the flesh?"
[1:35:22] It's nice and quiet.
[1:35:27] I say, "God,
[1:35:29] mold me, Lord.
[1:35:32] Mold me. Shape me." Musicians come.
[1:35:34] Musicians come. Paul come.
[1:35:37] We want the Lord to continue to mold us
[1:35:40] and to shape us. And what a what a
[1:35:42] character that friends this message that
[1:35:46] God has revealed to you and I
[1:35:50] bringing us to a place that where we can
[1:35:51] see
[1:35:54] in the life of the prophet. I think
[1:35:57] as I've got a I've got a few different
[1:35:59] books
[1:36:01] at the house and then
[1:36:04] even it was TL Osborne.
[1:36:09] I've got the whole thing that T.
[1:36:12] Osborne, you would have access to it
[1:36:14] too. TL Osborne speaks
[1:36:18] at brother Brandham's memorial service
[1:36:21] and the statements that he makes
[1:36:24] when you read through it you would
[1:36:25] wonder it would seem as though TL
[1:36:27] Osborne
[1:36:29] seen it
[1:36:32] and yet he didn't see the message
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; because you you realize
[1:36:38] where he end up going and even how TL
[1:36:41] Osborne just started to present those
[1:36:43] things you know brother got a little off
[1:36:45] here and there, but not in that memorial
[1:36:47] service. But in that memorial service,
[1:36:48] there's a statement that even that he
[1:36:50] makes that we had forgot
[1:36:54] what the Jesus of the Bible was like.
[1:36:57] And God came through the prophet through
[1:37:00] William Brham and helped us to remember
[1:37:03] to see what Jesus was like.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; It's not lifting up and and TL Osborne
[1:37:09] will go through there in all fairness.
[1:37:10] He said, "I'm not exalting the man." But
[1:37:12] he he just goes through all the things
[1:37:13] that he saw and the examples. And what I
[1:37:16] what what he covers within there. It's
[1:37:19] not just the miracles because I I I look
[1:37:21] at one part of the miracles, but the
[1:37:23] things that TL Osborne is even is even
[1:37:25] pointing out is what's what's very
[1:37:26] important is the character.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; This message, it's the character of
[1:37:32] Christ being revealed
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; and producing a character in the bride.
[1:37:38] Remember in choosing of a bride, the
[1:37:40] prophet said, "What a man chooses for
[1:37:43] his future home tells what's in his
[1:37:46] heart."
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; And what is everything boils down to is
[1:37:52] character. And you know, remember
[1:37:54] brother Bram says regarding Rebecca,
[1:37:57] Brother Bram says it like this. He says,
[1:38:00] if he says, "If I can just get that
[1:38:03] bride to stand still, I can just find a
[1:38:06] character like Eleazar found Rebecca. A
[1:38:09] character that was willing to listen."
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Rebecca was willing to be dressed. She
[1:38:16] was willing to to listen. She was
[1:38:18] willing to submit. So, our character,
[1:38:20] remember, it's a victory, not a gift.
[1:38:23] Our character is being molded and shaped
[1:38:26] by the life that we have within us. And
[1:38:31] God is calling us. He's calling us
[1:38:34] higher. There's things that you you
[1:38:36] won't see or know about in your life as
[1:38:40] far as many times we can look and and
[1:38:43] and we say, "M, I'm pretty good right
[1:38:45] now. It seems like with patience or this
[1:38:47] or that."
[1:38:49] And God, it's not that we haven't come
[1:38:51] to a certain place, but you have to
[1:38:53] understand that you just don't come to a
[1:38:55] place even with patience. Well, I've got
[1:38:56] all this and I'm ready to move on to
[1:38:58] this. When the prophet says when he's
[1:39:01] dealing with that and he says, now don't
[1:39:02] try to add that. In other words, there's
[1:39:06] got to be a completion of our patience.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; And remember, brother Ram says, "And is
[1:39:11] your life worthy of the gospel 1963?" He
[1:39:13] says, you know, he says, "Your patience
[1:39:15] kind of starts out like this." I don't
[1:39:17] know how he looked, but I can just
[1:39:18] imagine. He said, "It starts out like
[1:39:19] this." He said, "Then it grows to this
[1:39:21] right here. Your patience grows, your
[1:39:24] faith grows,
[1:39:26] your love grows." That's all scriptural,
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; And how does it grow? Is it just
[1:39:34] something that just it just well
[1:39:36] overnight, man, I woke up and man, not
[1:39:38] only is there a Cherry Danish, but I've
[1:39:40] grown in love? No.
[1:39:43] It comes through dying.
[1:39:47] And so what Satan wants to point out and
[1:39:50] say, "You're not very far along.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Look at this. You've not made this very
[1:39:54] much. You look at look at See, what
[1:39:56] Satan's trying to do is to get you
[1:39:57] looking at
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; your weakness."
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; And what God's trying to get you to do
[1:40:02] is surrender it.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; That is so
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; And that's how that's that's how God is
[1:40:08] working in our life because there's a
[1:40:10] growing that's this is why the prophet
[1:40:12] as he said on the wings of a snow white
[1:40:15] dove, he's in prayer.
[1:40:17] I don't think anybody here would
[1:40:19] question the faith that was resting in
[1:40:22] the heart of the prophet. But one of the
[1:40:24] very last messages that he preaches
[1:40:26] before being taken home,
[1:40:29] he says, "Lord, you that came down
[1:40:33] right there in Sabino Canyon, what
[1:40:36] you've done, Lord, where those seven
[1:40:38] angels came, that sword, I saw that
[1:40:41] place, sword rock, where that sword came
[1:40:43] in my hand." He said, "This this this
[1:40:47] has led me to a faith I never had
[1:40:52] before."
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; You see, led me,
[1:40:57] led me. This is why Brother Brian,
[1:41:00] Brother Brandham says in and uh I know
[1:41:03] you think I thought you was closing
[1:41:07] recognizing your day in this message. I
[1:41:08] love the prayer at the end. I just sang
[1:41:10] as it would come to me. Brother Bram at
[1:41:13] the very end of recognizing your day in
[1:41:15] this message, he said, "Oh, I wouldn't
[1:41:16] trade this sweet, sweet feeling for
[1:41:18] nothing."
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; And then he begins to pray. He says,
[1:41:20] "God,
[1:41:23] creating me a revival." Notice, "Create
[1:41:26] in me a revival.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, create in me what's lacking in my
[1:41:31] life." 65. Lord, create in me. Lord,
[1:41:36] make there to create a hunger. Lord,
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; create that thirst. Lord, make me to be
[1:41:42] more humbler, more willing.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; HE'S ASKING GOD TO DO THAT BECAUSE YOU
[1:41:49] AND I CAN DO THAT. WE THIS IS WHERE WE
[1:41:51] COME TO IN OUR WALK WITH GOD TO REALIZE,
[1:41:54] YES, I AM A new creation, but what is to
[1:41:56] come forth of my life must be his life
[1:41:59] coming and energizing that word. It must
[1:42:01] be a create creation of the word
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; because God won't share his glory with
[1:42:06] no one. So you and I step back AND SAY,
[1:42:08] "LORD, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DID IT, BUT
[1:42:10] you've done it."
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; I I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M STANDING HERE,
[1:42:14] BUT IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU, LORD.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; MY WILL, LORD GOD, EVEN YOUR GRACE THAT
[1:42:21] WAS GIVEN to me to submit my will to
[1:42:23] you, Lord. I DON'T KNOW HOW. I DON'T
[1:42:25] UNDERSTAND IT, BUT I KNOW YOU'VE DONE IT
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; because I'm seeing the evidence, Lord.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; And I'm seeing the evidence as it's
[1:42:31] being even in my life and my heart.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him?
[1:42:35] What grace
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; what grace
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; that God has given to us. A liberty. A
[1:42:41] liberty to walk in.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Could we just stand? And Paul, you
[1:42:48] got something on your heart?
[1:42:50] You got a song? Amen. Hallelujah. Thank
[1:42:54] you, Lord Jesus.
[1:42:56] Amen.
[1:42:59] Oh yes. Wonderful. Thank you, Lord. Oh,
[1:43:03] the more [singing] that I [music]
[1:43:05] surrender,
[1:43:09] the lighter [singing]

[1:43:16] Lord.

[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. with our hearts lifted up
[1:43:26] more [music and singing]

[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; and every day I live
[1:43:40] Lord [music and singing] I love you more
