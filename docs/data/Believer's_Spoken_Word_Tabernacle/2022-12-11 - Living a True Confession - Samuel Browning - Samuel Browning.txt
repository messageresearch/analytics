tell us that as we come together he said it's more of the pillar of Fire coming together and we know that it's just it's unlimited of what God will do I believe he's here to do for us aren't you I believe that I I don't believe we come to church to fulfill a Duty or just to say well I've done this part but we've come here to have a meeting with him Manning to think about it is is that he's come here to have a meeting with us thank you Jesus amen you know he's he's turned out in this age he's been put out he's been put out of lives he's been put out of the church they don't want nothing to do with him there's a people on Earth that can speak to him and say Lord you can rest your head in my lap yes you can find satisfaction in my bosom Lord amen you know why because it's his life it's a people that desires to please him and to serve him Amen in that wonderful oh they're just our delighters in the Lord we're just so thankful to be gathered together here this morning and the God has permitted that and I think the first time that sister Amelia is here yeah Amen brother brother Brian and sister Gracie uh their little one and we're just thinking of that and I thought you know I was just thinking of it in a manner you know we have uh they always talk about Amelia Earhart the first woman in flight and I thought right here's you'll be one flying in a rapture amen God is so good isn't he so good and so we just thank the Lord for that just want to uh remind you or mention to you here brother Wayne Lawson will be ministering for us next Sunday and so we just want to come expect him for that and I think he's got a more of a reason to come here so I I found out he was going to be here and he's not coming in here without speaking and then we just we just certainly just um just appreciate brother Wayne appreciate his friendship and the ministering of the words and we're blessed by that amen we're blessed by all of God's gifts that God has placed in the body and God did it that way on purpose God's done it that way on purpose it's just like as God the ministry that that comes right in here it's all necessary all every gift is necessary for our lives God knows that and so we just thank God for that we we just want to turn our attention to the word of the Lord and so good to see different ones Ryan Rachel God bless you it's good to see you amen and uh if there's somebody else I've missed amen here this morning will you forgive me but God bless you it's so good to be together we want to look in the Bible in Mark chapter 11 and maybe as you turn there thank you musicians amen we just want to turn there and then we'll prepare to read and maybe before we read I'd just like to offer a word of prayer and try to let you get there let's just power hits in the word of prayer if we could let's just uh just invite him he's here and let's just invite him just to have his ways that's what your desire is or just have your way Heavenly Father Lord as we bow our Lord our heads Lord oh God unto the dust of the Earth but Lord our hearts are humble Lord in reverence o God in your presence Lord father we could think of nothing greater that could be Lord then that you would come by our way and you would speak to us Lord father you see Lord even those things that you've laid Lord on my heart and Lord even in those times Lord when the inspiration is just moving for these moments Lord but God we need you Lord here Lord I'm asking that you would help me that I can step aside that Lord the same one Lord that you would give Lord of that same inspiration to each one of us and something that's always so special Lord is when you come Lord you break the bread that we recognize that it's you Lord and father that's our desire Lord may you help us the Lord as we were just steal away Lord in these few moments Lord that you would speak to each of our hearts to every need that's gathered here this morning in a very personal way Lord we just desire to hide behind the cross Lord and that Lord in everything you would have the preeminence Lord may you just take control now Lord we pray we love you and we thank you now Lord in Jesus precious name Amen in Mark chapter 11 and verse 12. is where I'd like to begin reading there portion of the scripture it says and on the morrow when they were come from Bethany he was hungry and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves he came it happily he might find anything thereon and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet Jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of thee Hereafter forever and his disciples heard it I wonder you know they already thought Jesus was crazy right not the disciples but everybody else around right but the disciples are here and he speaks to it what's he speaking to he's speaking to the life that's in that tree no man eat fruit of thee Hereafter forever and his disciples heard it and in the morning as they pass by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots I want you to think the word spoke to the life and the life itself had to give way because there was a greater Authority and it dried up from the roots right to the source of life because Roots is where the life is Peter calling to remember and saith unto him Master behold the Fig Tree which thou cursed is withered away Jesus answering said unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what things so ever ye desire When you pray believe that you receive them you shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses how powerful how powerful amen let's just a man look to the Lord and as you're being seated just as some things that we were speaking just a few weeks ago and we've been dealing with thought of the power of the word of God and when you think about it brother Brown would refer to this many different times and I'll give you my title here in just a moment but brother Branham would would speak about that of even a lie detector test and we recognize that this if we can say it in this way brother Brown would speak to us and we know a human was not made to lie that's why a lie detector actually works and we know there's been things where you say well it didn't work in this situation and that but let's just bear with this thought just a moment Abram said lying is a deceitful hard evil thing I'd rather have a drunkard with me any day than a liar you see this is a great age of lying and lying itself the biggest lie there ever was told had 99 truth in it right so lying isn't just you know flat out a you know a flat out lie you know but it's but it is it's all considered it all comes under that and so we know that even as we see in the age that we're living in it's a it is the most deceitful age that's ever been that's upon the face of the Earth it's a challenging moment because of things that people uh would not want to receive as things being a lie whether it's politics religion whatever there's so many fronts all around us of such deception right but in the midst of this time of deception the truth himself I want you to catch that the truth himself because the truth is not a Doctrine the truth is the person of Jesus Christ he said I am the truth the life and the way brother Brown said your body was not made to lie no matter how sinful you are you're still a fallen Son of God and the most sinful person in this city today God didn't intend you to be sinful he wanted you to be a son or a daughter of his and you're made up in his own makeup but sin has caused you to do that and no matter how much you try to impersonate and try to make a lie seem right he said they've got an instrument that'll prove it's wrong you can tell it with all the Innocence you want to but it's still register negative because there's a subconscious down in the human human being and that subconscious knows the truth so no matter what we say out here the subconscience knows that it's a lie and that's why it will register off now notice where brother Branham is going here he says if a man or a woman could ever get their thoughts and their testimony and their lives so lined up with God there's a three important parts it's not just not speaking about these thoughts up here but the scripture says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so it's thinking about those and getting those thoughts that from the heart lined up with their testimony what is actually being expressed and then the life going with it so the thought on the inside the testimony that's coming out and the life that's being lived that all of that could be lined up with God until the channel of the Holy Spirit would be perfectly one with god oh he said what would take place is that your desire amen that's our desire if the man and the woman could ever get lined up where with freedom from their hearts with Faith from their innermost now think of it because Faith itself is based on forgiveness that's why Jesus would say if you have ought when you're praying and you know you have ought there's something that you have ought you might have a right with that with someone else but you must forgive them right you have to forgive now don't get I don't want to get off and teach on this but forgiveness and Reconciliation are two different things forgiveness leads to reconciliation right so forgiveness isn't well you know I can't get together for coffee with them or you know I can't go over to their house that has nothing to do with forgiveness forgiveness is where you release it in your heart and you hold nothing against that person and you leave it in the hands of God for God to bring the reconciliation are you with me so forgiveness don't don't allow the enemy to put it over your head that well you know you're not really you're not reconciled so you're really not forgiven but forgiveness itself will lead to reconciliation the same work that God does within our lives as well many people brother Brown said they come to the altar to be prayed for and they have intellectual Faith they confess their sins and they join a church by intellectual Faith they believe it in their heart or in their mind rather he says they believe it and they believe it because they've heard it just I I'm just just dragging my feet here they believe it because they know it's the best policy let me just say this we don't believe a message simply because we know well it's the best one out there well you know it's the truest one out there that's not it that's still not reaching down to where God desires us to be because you can believe and say well I believe everything boy this is the truth while these doctrines are standing out well this is good but it that's not what God is looking for what's not looking for for that that it's the best policy he said that's not what God looks at he don't look at your intellectual Faith he looks on the heart on the inside and when it comes from the inside of your heart all things are possible then look what he says your confession in other words what you say it meets up with your life your life speaks so loud as your confession does but when your confession says says one thing and your life lives another something's wrong somewhere that's what I want to speak this morning on living a True Confession Hallelujah even after we spoke a few weeks ago just moving back home and this burdensome just dropping so heavily on my heart because they're not the confession what we say our life must project because we're not judged on what we say we're judged on what is expressed through our life because when we to stand there on that day we are where we give an account is God said you said you were a believer you said you believed this message but you never came and actually surrendered your life and became a partaker of it and your life spoke contrary of it because let me say this to you your children will not follow your confession your children will follow your life the Bible didn't say teach up a child it said train them so what you do shows them what you think of Jesus Christ everything now it's not just children whether they're small whether they're grown our neighbors Associates it's our life that is projected Sinners and publicans never came to Jesus in Luke 15 which he was highly ridiculed and accused about they did not come to him because Jesus was a feel-good society are you hearing me we're talking about people that that that their lives were in shambles and they knew it but there was a drawing power in the life of the Lord Jesus and they were drawn to that life Hallelujah let me just say this I don't believe we're drawn here to to assemble because of a feel good quite the contrary the word comes down and it cuts and deals with our life and you know what that is that's the love of God it's not the satanic way that Satan has wanted to make it out there that oh the love of God is just you know you just come as you are and God just accepts you the way you are that's a lie you can come but you can't stay the Way You Are why are what's drawing you because there's a life there's a choice you can't even explain it that's why Jesus said if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me you're not drawn to a church a church cannot change you you can change your ideas for a while your thoughts for a while you're Doctrine for a while but that's not real change because all it takes is a matter of time and something to come along and change your thoughts gotta be something deeper than my thoughts it must be his thoughts coming to the inside is there something wrong somewhere he says that's because you have an intellectual faith and not a Faith from the heart you see it's more than talking the message it's more than knowing the lingo it's more than knowing cliches oh it's more than knowing scripture it's to know him you cannot know him and remain the same Jesus said through David if I can say it that way let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh God that's why brother Branham would tell us over and over and over and over he said your thoughts in heaven are louder than your words on Earth when it goes into the seventh seal he speaks to us and he says for those that are saying one thing and doing something different he said you better stop that why because it's the seriousness of the hour that it's not just because I say it you know we're living in that kind of a society well it's just because I say it or I ignore it all right this all right that that's that's even that's even wrong on the church world it's just not that it's got to be something that's deeper than that it's a life that's lived a heart that beats for almighty God amen because God is looking upon the heart not just the words we say I mean think about it when when a catastrophe has taken place I mean when 9 11 take place everybody became Christians oh suddenly everybody's born again right and then you realize you know which is not a surprise they're not born again because the whole pretense of them surrendering or supposed surrendering it was all out of a fear of oh man this this might be the end but it never was a surrender and that's why people doing go right back to the way they're going oh I wish I had words to express it so I asked the question is before I start continuing to minister here because the thought living a True Confession and so a question is I would continue to minister does your life the expression of it does it match your confession in other words is your life a poster child of the message come on somebody amen is it you say what do you mean I mean it's an example of what this message produces Oh Glory Mark 11 12. on the morrow let me reread this on tomorrow just a couple verses when they come from Bethany he was hungry Jesus was hungry he was Desiring substance and in verse 3 verse 13 he saw a fig tree afar off having leaves you know what I find incredible the very thing that was used to cover up sin in a religious cloak was fig leaves and he comes and he sees a fig tree because we're in religions are covering [Applause] right we could have our favorite quotes our favorite scriptures and it can cover over but there's got to be a greater covering that comes in your life to where it no matter what quote is read it no matter what scripture is read your life has come under the blood and you are in tune with Jesus Christ it doesn't matter the preaching can't get too hard it can't get too straight because you're in love with Jesus Christ and there is an amen on the inside to the word of God amen a fig tree he saw this fig tree having leaves and he came if he might find something there on now think of it he saw the leaves he's coming to find something on it and when he came he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet now this is known it'd just be like right now you know you don't expect to go out there and pick apples off the apple tree right you don't expect that you know it's not the time for apples and Jesus knowing even knowing that knowing it it's not the time for figs but he sees the leaves that are on the tree they're not withered up leaves they are leaves that are expressing fruit should be present are you hearing me now there are leaves that are expressing there should be fruit present in other words let me bring it on down that if we say that we're a Believer there should be fruit that is present yes and the message hidden life brother Brown takes this one of the few places through the message of how God would lead the prophet in and bringing this this part out for you and I that takes place in Mark 11 he said Jesus came to the tree to look for fruit on it and it had everything but fruit and he said that's what's the matter with our churches today we got everything but fruit we can shout we can speak in tongues we can argue the scriptures we can teach our theology but when it comes to fruit bearing the tree is very lean so what's what's it coming against it's because the leaves themselves even though it's not the time of figs but the leaves are bearing false witness because when he comes there's no fruit that's there Jesus is moved Jesus does not moved by the leaves it's by the fruit even faith in the new heaven the new Earth it's the kings that come to take leaves off the tree for the healing of the nation leaves speak of Fellowship right and so there must be of that testimony when we we can be in fellowship with brothers and sisters and that is wonderful Fellowship in a church even coming and accepting the Lord Jesus Christ as our Lord and savior and being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ we now are in fellowship with the Believers but there it has to be a deeper fellowship and that is a fellowship under the blood of Jesus Christ to where our lives bear his fruit his life and that fruit is love the love of God rooted in our lives and the joy of the Lord is my strength in other words circumstances of Life do not dictate your walk with God oh brother Samuel if I hadn't had this heard trial look at it like this God in His Grace has let you know what you said oh if this hadn't happened I wouldn't have wound back out in the world what God is letting you know is there is something stronger than intellectual faith there is a strength that you can be founded on the Rock to where when the winds come when the storms come when it blows and rains and hails and snows there is an acre that will hold you [Applause] your anchor is not another man your anchor is not another woman if you're anchors your husband what happens when he fails there goes your anchor and where your anchor goes you will go also receive it as the grace of God to let you and I know hey I need to go deeper yeah man I don't think anybody wants to set spiraling in confusion I don't like I don't like to be confused I don't know about you I don't I don't like to be confused about things I like to be clear I think everybody else does too right I mean I'm the kind of guy if I got to do a plumbing project around America call somebody else I mean well you know or or doing something you know you want to make sure of it right some things you know you do there's not so many things the second second chance right right hooking things up in your house you better be sure right I want to be sure and this is a time to really be sure this is a time to really be sure it's a time of great preparation so to think of how that God would deal with that life and that in that in that that was in that tree because when you consider that even when Aaron's raw think about Aaron's Rod it was dead dead as long as it was out here it was dead it did not matter how predestinated it was it was dead and when it came into the first Veil it still was dead but it had to come in that way right just like you have to come to God right there's no other door there's no other name right you have to come through repentance then you enter into the second Veil it was still dead where the candle where the candle sticks but you see what the candlesticks are doing they are reflecting The Shining Light upon that of the labor and it points you and it's directing you into the holy place that's where real Victory is are you with me because now once that Rod came into the holiest of holies Aaron's rod it budded it blossomed and it bore almonds you understand what I'm saying it's impossible to be in the holiest of holies to be in Christ to be a believer that is filled with the Holy Ghost and not bearing fruit it's impossible but the same thing then what are you saying I'm saying what Veil are you in them what Veil are you in you might have come through the first Veil Glory I'll Rejoice with you but keep going you might have come to the second Veil we're sanctification the word sets your mind on holiness but keep going keep going don't get content move to where there is Union kitchen is fellowship living we eat living room is fellowship the bedroom is where New Life comes that's the whole list of holy God's desire is to see his own life Fruit reproduced in our lives look at look at John 15. Jesus said abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except she abide in me amen I am divine you are the branches and he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing through verse 7 if ye abide in me and my words abide in you now what are his words his thoughts in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God see this is the power of the word if that is that that is really if we are captured with that and it moves in our life then you recognize you are a son or daughter of God in Authority in your life in your walk with God when things arise in your home things arise on the job things arise in the church there is an authority if ye abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will [Applause] in other words you become a spokesman of the word and it's not you it's not your thoughts it's God's thoughts because it's God's thoughts that come to materialization and that's God's desire for his children that's what the Lord Jesus Through the Redemptive work is to bring you and I back into that place that's why in this hour we're not looking for something to come now is the time of the manifestation of the sons of God not just a Son of God that was manifested in the ministry of Malachi 4 God showed that of the Son of God come into full adoption right and it wasn't just on a mountain he spoke to the wind I'm gonna preach now I got criticized for this it wasn't just on the mountain it wasn't just demonstrated right there before hundreds of people that same life was reproduced in his home yeah yeah true are you with me that's why it ain't good enough just to have well Miracles and this is before everybody else it's how are you at home because how you are at home and when nobody else is watching is how you really are whoo think the pastor got back in town notice here is my father glorified right how that you bear much fruit not that you have a lot of leaves not that they're we believe in shouting don't we I believe in that I believe in Shelton I'm believing running I believe in I believe in being expressed I believe in turning loose yeah I believe in that I believe that the word itself will produce that now there may be some that don't there might be some as I told you before I preached the places that maybe they don't run maybe they don't jump up and shout that's okay but as long as the anointing of the word is there right but you see the danger is sometimes where people get in they get to leaning towards their favorite way that they feel is more spiritual and they'll pull it this way or they'll pull it that way there's a middle of the road what are you saying by the same now I'm saying that you know what let us just keep our eyes on Jesus and you know what if you're one that cries will you cry if you're one that shouts you'll Shout so many times I wonder you know we can read quotes in the message but I wonder if we're coming to the house of God are we coming here to monitor somebody else's shout or lack of shout we're here for the wrong purpose we are not here well let me see if so and so is growing you're not here for that you are not their measuring stick God didn't give you that God the word is coming forth to measure up pneumonia you might be looking at the wrong thing and it'll take you right away you keep your eyes on Jesus look hey unto Jesus the author and the finish of the faith because what you might be looking at may not even be a left seed and you're expecting elect results oh amen brother Samuel how do I know serve God that's how we know serve God that's how I've Got Confidence in this word this message will produce itself in the lives of its people are you with me that's why we don't pull struggle push I was thinking how it said this isn't the message of the three pushers it's the three pulls Romans 7 verse 1. I don't have that scripture there but let's look here Romans 7 verse 1 I'd like to read seven verse chapter seven one through six no you're not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how did the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath and husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she's loosed from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she'd be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she's no adulteress though she be married to another man so the only thing that would relieve that of the woman from adultery is her living husband is dead are you with me now verse six now let me go verse 4 verse four wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead now notice Paul bringing this application into the spiritual Realm wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God what an hour that we're living in this scripture that was the admonition of the Believers down through the ages to be United with the word that God was sending in that hour in the day of Pentecost they were United with him who was the word right they were wooed to that place to be United with him this admonition has been down Through the Ages but it was written in Prophecy for this hour because in this hour you see back in the day of Pentecost was not the Fulfillment of Revelations 19. are you hearing me now it was not the marriage of the lamb now Revelations 19 it was the prophecy the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made her self ready she had been adorned in the fine linen which is the righteousness of the Saints so it's a prophecy of this hour verse 5 for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now he says we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held so we were held remember we were dead in sin and trespasses we were in bondage by our first husband by First Union which you didn't have a choice of that it was a shotgun wedding when you came here somebody maybe don't know about that somebody may feel like you're getting a shotgun wedding but anyhow that's beside the point you didn't have a choice when you came here of did you want to be married to that first Adam that first nature a man born of a woman is a few days old and full of trouble said under inspiration who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean you see God don't clean up that first nature God don't say the problem is I got to clean this guy up no because he still natured that way no matter how much you clean him up his nature is the same we were dead in that but now that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the wholeness of the letter now notice right brother random places that's here in invisible Union of the bride of Christ he says it was nature as we were associated with death your first husband had the rule over you that first Adam that first nature it had to rule over you right it was by now listen to this it was your Nature by natural birth natural you love the world because you are the world and part of the world your desires was by nature to love the world which you're part of you're a part of Nature and that's your natural thing that's the reason you have to be born again look at the Simplicity you have to separate you have to die to that first husband can't just divorce him because he's still a living husband right can just divorce him he'll come back because you're still under his Rule and if you are still married to him he's alive and professing to be married to Jesus Christ you're an adulteress it's not true you have to separate you have to die to that first husband you can't live with it you just can't say well I'll divorce him and hang him up here till the occasion no sir no writing of divorcement in other words I ain't going to have nothing more to do with you I ain't gonna do this and I'm going to stop this and I'm going to quit it's got to go deeper than the writing of divorcement because he's still alive he dies the nature of the world has to die every Speck of him has to die God will never and he does not Unite with that first nature that first nature is that first husband and God will not Unite with us with that first husband still alive that first nature every Speck of him has to die that's why brother Brahm said not even a toe can be out from underneath the blood but Simon what are you saying I'm saying don't make excuses for your toe being out get it under the blood oh brother Samuel that's hard let me tell you what'll be hard when you show up here one of these mornings and nobody's here that's what'll be hard and you'll think oh brother Samuel that's hard no it's God's grace coming to you and I because God's desire is to get us ready he wants to project his life to you well brother Samuel you know I read and I pray those are all wonderful things but that's no substitute for the Holy Ghost except you abide in me and my word abide in you let me tell you something there's Baptists that can snow you under there's Pentecostals that can outdo you with praying and devotional and everything else they can snow you under they love God according to all that has been known to them they love him in that way but this is a greater hour the message itself is calling for a deeper relationship and if there's a deep pulling in your heart there's a deeper walk with God for every one of us every Speck of him has to die you have to be reunited again with another nature he said when were you you were separated from that Union by a spiritual death your desire now watch this your natural desire is to cut your hair so if you still like to cut your hair that speaks of a desire of worldliness Steel in the heart aren't you glad for an MRI if you're having pain somewhere you're having discomfort somewhere you want to know right yeah right you want to know you just don't want to walk around pop and leave an Advil you know what because they ain't taking care of it so you need to have an MRI and figure out what in the world's going on right so we can get down to the symptoms or get down to the root instead of stressing the symptoms right I believe that's why it's more than just many times and over the same I need a refilling of the Holy Ghost sometimes I don't think it's a refilling that we need I think it's a genuine feeling that we really need I think we really need to meet God first you understand what I'm saying many times I've prayed with many young people oh brother Samuel this has come back around in my life and this has come back around and you realize where they're looking at well I just need a real refilling of the Holy Ghost no that still has you bound you're still in bondage with that thing now God doesn't leave one Speck of your life in bondage he sets you free oh brother Samuel that's harsh it might upset their faith let me tell you something if your faith is in position in the word of God it's not correct and it will never produce a Victorious Life truth Might Sting but it'll set you free your natural desire is to cut your hair your natural desire is to wear shorts paint your face your natural desire is to be intellectual smart man know something better than the other oh wow so that's that's sin as well too may not smoke may not drink maybe all that I'm a good clean guy but having a natural desire to assert yourself Above the Rest of the brethren oh they need to come to me for my understanding on these things that's a natural desire sin notice in souls are in prison now what a message if you haven't listened to souls in prison in a while go listen a message brother Brandon clearly it's continuing laying this out of that first birth and he goes he says he never let his body see corruption neither did he leave his soul in hell but he raised him up on the third day and he's Alive forevermore and we will have a body like his own glorious body that's why we're baptized in his name that we might come forth in his name in his death in his resurrection that Rise Again testifying to the world that we have new life that the old man is dead so why are we baptized because God has dealt with our heart the Bible said repent and repentance isn't feeling sorry for where you're at Oh Me Oh My My life is like this one that ain't repentance that's worldly sorrow God won't come to that it's God repentance is where you realize I need God I need God and repentance is a change of mind where you're no longer heading that way but I'm heading this way it's with a balance towards sin not making excuses for it my daddy was like this my mama was like this if so and so hadn't done this if this hadn't happened it's not making excuses for it it's turning from it and when we're baptized this is why when I baptize somebody I want to know where you're standing the same you shouldn't Turn Me by I'm not saying I'll turn anybody away but I want you to understand this ain't just Roman Catholicism were you walking in because you made a boo-boo in life and all of a sudden now I'm going to walk back in here and I feel good that ain't what it's about now I can't straighten that out of anybody's life but the reality of this is right here that we are being we are taking upon his name you are declaring when you walk into the water of baptism that I am identified with My Sacrifice I am testified to this whole congregation and to the rest of the world that I am a new creation I no longer want anything to do with the world that's what it really means and God comes and Honors that faith the Bible says we buried that first nature that first nature is gone and now we're the nature of him he lives in US and we don't do our own will we do his will we don't think our own thoughts the mind is what thinks you see that's why it takes something greater than even your upbringing it takes something greater than you're raisin there's got to come a power on the inside that brings a change there's got to come a power that is able to move in your life to give you victory over you come on now for your own will well you know this is just how I am well if you've got the spirit of Christ in you you've got greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world and that first worldly birth you don't want to make excuses for it your temperament you don't want to make excuses for it you want to let the Holy Ghost reign in your life come on now the sins I used to do I do them no more glory be to God the mind that was in Christ Jesus then is what's in that's in what's when every believer that's the soul and that's what we're speaking of in the message of token brother said you must be born again he said now look he said when Jesus said you must be born again how many knows that term has it's thrown away I mean it's thrown around like like water in a restaurant right it just throw it around we want water okay Water free it just throw it around and they've so cheapened what a real birth is right we just had to we just had another birth of God Terry's here it'll be another one coming here and in so many weeks or months I don't know exactly where that's at but you know you think of these things when a birth comes it's a new life it's a new life that has come forth is that right so with that we recognize that brother Ram says that it don't mean to jump up and down at the altar that don't mean to walk back there and shake hands with the pastor that don't mean all this foolishness that we've seen done it don't mean putting your name on a book it means Death to Your First being and life to the second being let me just say this if the characteristics that's on display in your life is still your surname you need a change come on now oh but my mom and daddy did this but your mom and daddy may not win all the way come on now Mom and Dad is not the measuring stick you in Christ it's you and Christ come on now the Holy Spirit produces a rugged life for Jesus Christ oh brother Samuel I don't believe you ought to be stressed out really I I find it I find I marble at the things that we will expend ourselves for and go to lengths to do and when it comes to Simply coming to the house of God oh we're just we'll just I've got this backache or I've got this legging now listen I'm not making light of anything the way it gets quiet in here it gets quiet that's all right lets me know drop it down into gear and preach it but to you you examine the words coming right now examine your life do you press yourself for others hangs and then when it comes to coming to the house of God oh brother Samuel I just catch it on the internet oh really show me in the scripture where it says for if you forsake not to stream together you understand what covet's done it's caused a lot of laxness it's brought along a virus a spiritual virus in the Church of the Living God pastors back in town it's brought about oh bless God I wouldn't get that vaccine bless God this and this and this and this but you better make sure you get this vaccine you better make sure you get this one this one was not man-made this one has come from on high this one stood in the face of time oh brother Samuel I can receive and be just a good a Christian at home that's a lie the prophet of God told us that you cannot be just a good a Christian outside of church as you can be inside a church but look what's happened we've become message surfing Christians oh no we wouldn't have cable we won't surf that but we'll surf the Internet for preachers who are we dealing with our first nature oh oh it means this is what it means it means Death to Your First being and life to the second being it means that the blood has been applied and you're identified by the life of Jesus Christ because if the Vine puts forth another Branch now notice the vine puts forth another branch a life that has already been identified alive and Christ comes down through that life what he has reserved for himself that life then by the quickening power to project his life through that Branch it's his branch it's no longer the branch of the world it's no longer the branch it's God producing his own life through his own branch James 1 21. I'm coming down here wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness now this is God's admonition to his children to lay this aside get rid of all uncleanliness and the rampant this is what the Amplified says ran the rampant outgrowth of wickedness so it's separating it's dying I love this this scripture and receive the meek with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls brother Brown takes this in the message and if you haven't listened the message word made flesh India trip preaching 54. it's just an absolute masterpiece LeBron is talking about when a man is converted and here is he begins to talk about a brother who has come to him and the brother has expressed to brother Branham that he is I've been trying to get saved for years and I want you to hear what he says he says I've been trying to get saved for years I've been trying to get the spirit and I can't but brim says you're trying to get saved he said yeah I said I'm trying to get saved he said brother Brown I believe I crossed the line where you can't get saved everybody I'm saying well I don't know about that then a man begins to proceed of how he's went to Billy Graham's meetings and they told him you know raise your hand and accept the Lord Jesus Christ and you confess that you're saved and they told him you're saved he said but nothing happened to me now I want you to keep these in mind nothing happened to me he said I went to the Free Methodist people and I had said I had to get happy enough to shout he said I I shouted but I still didn't have it I went to Brother Robert's meetings and he said they told me I had to speak with tongues or I didn't have it so he said I spoke with tongues but brother Branham I still ain't got it and he said now what they did Brother Brown they told me down in Shreveport at the voice the voice of healing they told me you were a prophet and they told me I need to come here because you'd be able to reveal to me when the spirit come on you what is my trouble now how many know that that's what the ministry of Malachi for this word even here this morning brother Brian says what I catch in my meetings is what has fallen off from Oral Roberts and from the rest of them why they couldn't get their healings why they couldn't get Deliverance because there was things sealed down in their life that needed to be cleared out the Holy Spirit won't come on top it it's got to be cleared out and God would come God's mercy in this generation to open and to reveal those things now here's this man is he has been told to come to brother Branham because brother Brown will be able to tell you and help you to determine what your trouble is and here's what brother Brown said brother Brown told him he said brother you don't need a prophet to do that the word of God settles it he said you don't need prophecy he said my brother the only thing of it is you're just confused we could preach on misunderstandings and confusion right here you'll see as I read on right here probably most of you read this before already you'll find how powerful confusion can be but oh how liberating when confusion is released the only thing you're just confused I want to ask you something now just just think of this did you always love the Lord Jesus now watch his response brother Brian asked him a question did you always love the Lord Jesus well I belong to the Presbyterian Church I just went there did you catch what brother Ram asked him did you always love the Lord Jesus no I went to a message Church that doesn't mean we love the Lord Jesus see a person can be in love with God in their intellect they're in love with the concept of God they're in love but that's only in the spirit Realm it's got to come down to Agape in the soul that's what the holy spirit is to where we really love God because you can love him with your spirit and in your mind and if something don't agree with you oh there'll still be sin coming out it'll still be things coming out in the life now watch which I says this did you always love the Lord Jesus well I belong to the Presbyterian Church I just went there so maybe if you're someone here this morning that's just went to believe your spoken word Tabernacle well you know I knew brother brownie if you just went and you really don't love him now let's watch because I know a lot of times we'll say we love him now let's watch well I want to ask you what happened what taken place that changed your mind all at once he said well my wife she went down to the Pentecostals and she got into the spirit and she come back man she was happy I said what'd you think about it did you criticize it oh that's a that's another point right there what'd you think about it did you criticize said no he said here's what I thought how'd you see how it lasts it went on she seemed to have it he said one day I was coming in from making a cell in the yard and I reached in my pocket and somebody gave me a little old tract I sat down in the office and I began to read that track and the awfullest feeling come over me that I ought to get right with God he said since then I've been searching ever since you see what happened conviction conviction or how I thank God for conviction I thank God in this hour because you want to know one sign of judgment is at hand convictions leaving the preaching of the word can go on and be ministered and be preached and God demonstrating God manifesting himself and lives just walk right on the same way it's a sign judgment is at hand that's where we're at he said I want to ask you something when this feeling come over you you've never been able to get out of it you've never been able to get out of it no sir I haven't well that's when you receive Christ it doesn't mean raising your hands speaking in tongues shouting that's all right but that's attributes of Christ after he come in to receive Christ is to receive the person Christ Jesus receive him is life shouting speaking in tongues demonstrations all those attributes will follow but first is to receive Christ brother Bradley said then you mean I've been saved the whole time brother REM said do you love him notice what the question comes back to do you love him with all my heart one time you didn't love him that's right and now you love him that's the truth well you had him the whole time he jumped off the porch and began crying and holding me in his arms he said oh god I've been a Christian all these years you see the thing of it was he wasn't straightened out in the beginning now this wasn't something this man was making up you understand he did he he did not he was not settled where on the word of God his experience nothing could take that away from him even his confusion could not dismantle his experience this man is not saying well I was confused and that's why I was still going out in the world and looking at this and doing that and I was still doing that you know I was confused nope because when the seal has come that's what came on this man he had a genuine experience confusion was hindering him from being an open available channel that was walking in full Authority that's what confusion will do that's why the word comes to bring Clarity in our lives that's why it comes to where we're pointed to the Holy Ghost with the real clear true evidence because it's not just saying well you've got to receive it you've got to receive it while the word's coming forth it doesn't line up with the scripture that happened in Acts 10 but also Paul laid his hands upon them it doesn't even have to be inside of a church what it has to be is is you have to meet Jesus Christ it's more than just having a knowledge of the word this message never came to produce a religious life Baptists have that and can snow us under any day it's true this should not come to produce a religious life a religious work the G listen the Pharisees and Sadducees what did Brother Graham tell us they had more fruits of the spirit he said they can outshine it come on now Christian Science he said could outdo it is that right but you see there's a difference here in that word in that life that's lived into the word let me let me just get to this place here he said notice he said that human being can be changed from a pig to a lamb because he's got a soul made in the image of God well his thoughts change the company says this his thoughts change something does it for him as a man thinketh in his heart Christ the Creator come to him in a still form and created his own Spirit took the man's nature away to love dancing and the world and carrying on over the same I just got a little bit discouraged if the nature of the world is still there you'll go back to it and the discouragement oh if this hadn't happened oh brother Samuel long years ago it if the nature is still there you'll gravitate toward the things your nature to have a riding of the enforcement that's right it's got to be dead to love dancing the world and carrying on now you know we could put like a whole lot of other things in there I think back to it when God got a hold of my life there probably wasn't they're probably and I've told my boys this I said they're probably wanting nobody else where the problem was because you know they didn't have such stuff as that fantasy football and everything else that goes on nowadays but I mean as far as known guys that played football knowing stats being involved with all that and being able to talk that and and you know I enjoyed it I enjoyed it but you know one thing that happened to me when God got a hold of my life I didn't have to do that as a matter of fact my life went like on a blank slate where I didn't know who won the Super Bowl I didn't know who was in what bowl I only knew I had cereal in mind oh brother Simon oh what's happening you see it isn't just that it steal things of the world many times we classify and look what he does Satan puts it as oh the world is drinking oh the world is smoking all the world is running around the world's looking at things on the internet the world and it puts it all out there and what you want to do he wants to leave it so that we feel secure surely God but you see the world is the world if you're still looking for through the world for your satisfying portion if it's still what satisfies you if it's still what calms you if it's still what you run to you need to really evaluate your life and you need to look and say Lord have I really went all the way come on friends don't be quiet on me this is real evaluation time you may not you may not like it but remember it's not it's not meanness it's not uh you know the brother Samuel's upset it's God in his Mercy to you and I to speak to us in our lives in our walk with God I would rather know right now like that black brother said he said I want I don't want no trouble when I come down to the river and from that time notice it took away the nature to love dance in the world and carrying on and from that time he just laid it aside and was hungering after God aha laid aside the things of the world and another sign hungers after God hungers after God longs to please the Lord it's his Delight this is this is why the man was searching on and on and on this man I have no doubt I know and sometimes we get to the other side no doubt we'll meet him oh my and to think about it how it was for you how it is for me how when God breaks back confusion and you can really see the clarity of it this man Not only was the things of the world gone but it was hungering after God you see there's a lie there's a thing where God will clean up a life and a life can be changed as far as the desires and the things of the world but it's also got to come to where it's a hungering after God it's the first thing after God that's why I've said when you look at certain things like things can get right in the way right in the way of coming to the house of God and you might think brother Samuel you harp on this you harp on that is it me or is it God is it me or is it God because there how many times there's too many quotes there's too many statements in the word of God oh but the brand tells us if you've got the love of God in your heart you can't wait for those Church doors to open to get in there and fellowship with your brothers and sisters so CNN about well I can get it all on the internet you know I don't need nobody that's called selfishness but you see it's more than that oh but at the same I know people can come to church and but don't let that be an excuse what about you right are you hungering after more of God are you hungering after more of God or are you just satisfied where you're at are you content where you at or do you want more of God I know there's circumstances that come up I know I know situations that come under then God will bring an evaluation that we can know right really where we are oh my God was in him the whole time think about it he has to become it has to become a thought before it can become a word and that word is expressed and it will be materialized let's let's just bow our heads we can't finish here as our hands are bowed think about this the ram said we're Christians by faith through grace of God we are Christians God In His Infinite Mercy called us to be reconciled to him through his son Christ Jesus and that settles it not what we've done but what he done he changed my soul from the things of the world unto the things of God from horse races and gambling and adultery and lying and stealing he changed my soul he changed my thoughts now my thoughts have become so real to the become words in my lips they materialize and I'm a Christian it made me a different person that's what made you you see it's receiving it in our heart the Bible said that man believeth with a heart first but bran said I believe it in my heart that I'm a Christian because I've accepted the Lord Jesus Christ if I don't cry if I don't move if I don't do a thing in my heart first I believe that Christ died for me in my stead I accepted as a Christian I believe it as a Christian then it's in my heart then I express it in a word I'm a Christian and then I start walking as a Christian talking as a Christian Living as a Christian being as a Christian and by my fruits I'm recognized by the world as a Christian I'd say here this morning if it don't have that that life and that testimony it's not lined up why don't you invite God to line it up for you say Lord I'm trying I'm tired of trying to connect dots I'm tired of trying to line it up and I know I need Lord everything my thoughts testimony and my life to be lined up God bless you bless your hands maybe there's lives that you know within that you can look at it and you know there's been a change but you see certain things as coming in and the hungering after the things of God there's things that's starting that's starting to get pushed aside pushed aside pushed aside you say Lord I want a renewing Lord I want to renew him I want my life to be so lined up because the words that you would have the thoughts to drop down into my life to be expressed and when I express them I'm not expressing my own thoughts I'm a Christian I'm expressing your thoughts when problems arise in the home problems arise in the job I want to be Lord so separate help me to lose my own will my own thoughts my own opinions oh God both of my hands are up Lord Jesus help me Lord to lose more Lose Myself Lord granted Lord I pray oh Father help us Lord this morning dear God you are so merciful to us Lord to speak to our hearts speak to our lives thank you Father Lord you see Lord the request Lord your God that's something Lord that it's between you and your children those you speaking Lord to our hearts now Lord may you just I pray move for every one of those needs Lord move for the Lord the hands Lord the desire Lord that is behind it let them know Lord God for those Lord that Desiring said Lord line everything up line up Let My Lord my words let the Lord thoughts the testimony of the life let it be lined up Lord oh God may I pray this morning Lord it just Lord It's the Simplicity of surrendering it's that's what's so simple Lord I think when they called your Prophet when he actually asked for somebody in New in Albuquerque New Mexico to come and instruct the people their lord in April of 63 and somebody come instruct them on how to receive the Holy Ghost he finally stepped back up to the platform himself and he spoke Lord such words of simplicity he said when you are willing to fully surrender he will fully come in Lord God you've never complicated your word but Lord you in Simplicity come to make it so real to us Lord may you just move I pray for each need Lord there's hearts and lives that's here Lord that we desire to be closer to you Lord father may we lord God as your children Lord evaluating Lord in our own lives looking and reflecting oh God Lord help me help me to die to my will help me to die to my own opinions Lord that's where the Holy Spirit comes to equip us the Lord that we can reign over that in our lives it can be a battle when things Lord would come our way but greater is he that's in US than he that's in the world that life the indwelling of that life to bring this outer man in subjection Lord sometimes it's not even what we would say or I'm entitled to do this or are attempted to this no Jesus was tempted in all points such as we are he was even tempted to have a wrong feeling toward the Pharisees tempted to have wrong thoughts he was tempted your Prophet goes through that Lord at deity of Jesus Christ and on down Lord how we need you Lord you give us strength Lord Jesus that every thought might be brought subject to The Obedience of Christ granted Lord we pray father may you just move marvelously Lord for your children in the name of Jesus Christ that we be fruit bearing Christians Lord in Jesus name amen amen don't you love him I mean let's stand this morning Hallelujah amen let's just invite him just to water water in that word just to receive it down in our lives just to water it I want to be more more like him make me more like these foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Jesus make me more like these oh give me a heart that is [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh Jesus made me more bloody [Music] oh Jesus name make me more like me oh just give me a heart that is [Music] [Applause] [Music] and I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love yes love and loved you there's just no no more love for I could never ever [Applause] [Music] turn your eyes Upon Jesus oh the Supreme sacrifice Hallelujah in his Wonder ful o he that bore our shame amen [Applause] [Music] of his glory angry if you've fallen in a trap if there's things that you know every one of us we have to overcome is that right there's an overcoming there's things you have to overcome there's things I have to overcome Pastor can't do it for us Prophet can't do it for us but God equips us to overcome he equips us to overcome you might look and say this trap this situation don't get focused on that Turn Your Eyes Upon him and be like David say Lord teach my hands how to fight this woman because my way of trying to fight and it's not working and you know the whole thing about it is God's saying let me who is in you fight this battle you can't do it but me in you I will overcome through you so the Trap is not what we're looking at let's look unto Jesus their strength like I was quoting the other night but the RAM talks about a boat he said you take a boat that don't have a motor on the back of it all you got is paddle power right you get hung up in something or you got's paddle power but if that boat has got an engine attached to it if it gets stuck somewhere it's got a throttle power that can get it out and that's what real faith is you might get stuck sometimes but there's a throttle power there's a power on the inside amen there's a power on the inside there's a part within your life to say there ain't nothing to go back to there's no world to go back to I don't want to go back to the world I want to serve God I want to go on with God what is it you're reaching is starting up that throttle power I've got hung up here a little bit maybe I've got in a trap something that appeals and you're drawn to but thanks be to God there's a throttle power I said there's a throttle power there is one in the ship that's greater than the ship as Jesus said there is one standing in the temple that's greater than the temple there is one standing in your life in my life that's greater than this Temple it's greater than all the efforts of Samuel Browning it's Jesus Christ and if I can just yield to that word say Amen Lord Lord take me there then what was a trap you'll stand as a testimony God gave me Grace to overcome in this area of my life what was something that was all it was a it was hard but God gave me Grace you know what it is it's fruit I said it's fruit he who overcame is manifesting his overcoming strength through your life what do I do well as a branch a branch can't do anything on its own a branch just receives the life from the Vine I think the greatest thing we do is say Lord make me more like you help me to die more to myself more to my will more to my opinions because it's Samuel's opinions it's got Samuel in trouble it's Samuel's will that's got Samuel Samuel in trouble yep it's not been nobody else it's been it's right this guy right here right yeah you're right Bill Sanchez nothing for me but for you that's right every one of us right every one of us help me Lord help me to die more to myself amen help me to die more show me Lord show me show me Teach Me Lord I want to grow closer to you I want to grow closer I don't believe anybody's standing here this morning or sitting here I don't believe anybody says oh I want to get further from God nobody nobody we come here because we want to we want to draw closer to God
