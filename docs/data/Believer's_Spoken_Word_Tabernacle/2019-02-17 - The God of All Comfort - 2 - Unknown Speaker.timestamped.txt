[33:31] the musicians just asked for the Lord
[33:36] that his he would just guide us this
[33:38] morning through his word second
[33:44] Corinthians chapter one
[33:59] and we begin at verse 3 blessed be God
[34:05] even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[34:08] the father of mercies and the God of all
[34:12] comfort who comforted us in all our
[34:17] tribulation that we may be able to
[34:21] comfort them which are in any trouble by
[34:26] the comfort wherewith we ourselves are
[34:30] comforted of God or as the sufferings of
[34:34] Christ abound in us so our consolation
[34:39] also aboundeth by Christ so notice this
[34:44] scripture here for as the sufferings of
[34:46] Christ abound or grow greater in us so
[34:52] our consolation also aboundeth grows
[34:56] greater by Christ and whether we be
[35:00] afflicted it is for your consolation and
[35:04] salvation which is effectual in the
[35:07] enduring of the same sufferings which we
[35:10] also suffer or whether we be comforted
[35:13] it is for your consolation and salvation
[35:16] and our hope of you is steadfast knowing
[35:21] that as ye are partakers of the
[35:24] sufferings so shall you be also of the
[35:28] consolation I think that's a very
[35:31] important verse that there a very
[35:32] important statement at the end as you're
[35:35] partakers of the sufferings so shall you
[35:39] be also of the consolation let's just
[35:43] bow our heads in a word of Prayer
[35:48] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we are
[35:52] mindful Lord that we are standing here
[35:56] Lord in your presence we're mindful Lord
[36:01] of our littleness mindful Lord of our
[36:07] insufficiency within ourselves Lord God
[36:10] for the task Lord that lays before
[36:13] father not only as Speaker but is here
[36:17] as well Lord were very much aware that
[36:22] it's going to take an operation of the
[36:24] Holy Ghost that you would come and
[36:27] that's the Lord where we want to yield
[36:31] the notes of our lives we want to yield
[36:34] to you Lord that you would just come in
[36:37] a very special and personal way and
[36:41] minister to the needs of your people
[36:44] Lord as we've gathered here O God in the
[36:47] precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[36:49] the father that you would just search
[36:52] our hearts and Lord may you deepen Lord
[36:57] in our lives oh god the love of God I
[37:01] pray father may you just take a hold of
[37:05] every heart if there's one who doesn't
[37:07] know you Lord as the comforter would you
[37:10] just move Lord upon that heart today and
[37:14] draw them to the place of refuge or God
[37:18] where Lord the pressure lord can be let
[37:22] off Lord where they can come to that
[37:24] rest and I pray God for each and every
[37:27] one Lord you know our needs Lord and may
[37:30] you come and encourage us break the
[37:33] bread of life to us Lord as we have need
[37:36] of it I pray in the name of Jesus Christ
[37:39] amen
[37:40] god bless yous your being seated I want
[37:45] to just the Lord will just help us here
[37:49] I'd like to just speak here just
[37:53] continuing to thought the God of all
[37:55] comfort from where we were in last week
[37:59] and I want to just kind of go back and
[38:02] set a little bit of a direction of where
[38:04] we're going to lay further in here this
[38:09] morning just as I just fill up on my
[38:11] heart just not be able to get away from
[38:13] different things when we left out of the
[38:16] pulpit last week and then all the way
[38:18] through Sunday and then Monday and so I
[38:21] just want to just bring this and lay it
[38:24] back in as Paul is
[38:26] is letting it be known to us that it it
[38:29] is the God of all comfort the father of
[38:32] our Lord Jesus Christ the father of
[38:33] mercies and at verse 4 as he said who
[38:36] comforted us in all our tribulation you
[38:42] know it would be nothing for God to
[38:47] totally take away the tribulation but
[38:51] yet God Himself gives to us something
[38:55] greater than just taking away the
[38:57] tribulation I know that's a big
[38:59] statement there I know that's a big
[39:02] statement and I don't say that loosely I
[39:05] don't say it without a meaning to it but
[39:08] yet God grants to us something that's
[39:11] more lasting and that's more that's more
[39:17] precious to us than what it would be if
[39:20] he just simply removed every tribulation
[39:23] that was about our life or even that he
[39:26] himself would prevent all of those
[39:29] tribulations and hardships he gives
[39:32] something so much greater and that is he
[39:34] gives us his comfort and that in itself
[39:39] is not something that in our minds our
[39:41] finite minds that we are able to grasp
[39:44] in our minds it is something that God
[39:47] makes real to us by an experience that
[39:50] words themselves can not even be brought
[39:53] together to utter that but you know
[39:56] there's nothing that can ever take the
[39:58] place of an experience there's nothing
[40:02] that can take the place of an experience
[40:04] of things that you have went through or
[40:07] I have went through nothing can take
[40:09] that away as a matter of fact with those
[40:11] experiences there is a coupling of a
[40:14] great deal of understanding that comes
[40:17] from the comfort of the Lord as he would
[40:20] move through upon our lives such as when
[40:23] you think back brother Branham mentioned
[40:25] about the mother when she saw that baby
[40:27] in the meeting and it wasn't that she
[40:30] just saw the baby but remember the Holy
[40:32] Spirit dealt with her heart and she went
[40:35] and she prayed for that baby under the
[40:37] unction and
[40:38] rection of the holy spirit Milliband
[40:40] tells us like this he says that the
[40:42] compassion of that mother is said it
[40:45] would have went much far beyond anywhere
[40:48] that I could have got to and it wasn't
[40:51] that brother Ben didn't have compassion
[40:52] he would have had compassion upon that
[40:55] baby just as you know I believe that any
[40:58] within humanity and I know that's a big
[41:01] statement in today's world because there
[41:03] is such a place that we find the effects
[41:06] in this hour where Paul said that there
[41:09] is a lacking or without natural
[41:13] affection so things that were just
[41:16] natural affection there's a lacking
[41:18] there and we we see how all of those
[41:20] things it wasn't something that just
[41:22] come up overnight but there's been an
[41:24] eroding over time but yet when we come
[41:27] to it the comfort itself
[41:29] Paul is expressing here that the comfort
[41:31] that we have received of the Lord then
[41:35] through that same measure we are able to
[41:38] extend that same comfort to others so it
[41:43] wasn't the comfort of Paul but it would
[41:46] be the comfort of the Lord and you know
[41:49] it's one thing of how that God will use
[41:52] us and work through us within our lives
[41:54] but I believe that every one of us here
[41:57] just don't want to say words we desire
[42:00] that Lord let it be that the whatever
[42:03] words would come forth let it be that it
[42:07] would be from a heart of love that what
[42:10] it would be is more than the words that
[42:12] are said but it's the love of which it
[42:14] the origin because it's that that'll
[42:17] actually change the atmosphere because
[42:20] the words themselves remember there's to
[42:22] be a motivation words will create an
[42:24] atmosphere words can create a positive
[42:27] or negative atmosphere and we want that
[42:29] when we look back to see how that in the
[42:32] beginning when God spoke the Bible says
[42:34] then the Spirit of God went out and
[42:37] began to brood over the earth so we know
[42:39] that if we're in our hearts and our
[42:41] desire is let our words be reserved unto
[42:45] God that it might be the love of God
[42:48] that will move out and take a hold in a
[42:50] situation
[42:51] and it may not be and many times and
[42:53] this is just my personal witness and I
[42:55] believe there's others here it is and
[42:57] sometimes that necessarily there's been
[42:59] anything that's come out of your mouth
[43:01] that's been profound anything that would
[43:04] cause you know people to say WOW but it
[43:07] might it's just what is actually behind
[43:10] it because it is the very creator
[43:13] himself the god the father of all
[43:15] mercies that can reach out and touch
[43:18] that heart or that life and minister to
[43:21] them so it is not us in ourselves doing
[43:24] it but it is Christ himself moving
[43:27] through the conduit of our lives and so
[43:30] when I go back to this quote here I
[43:31] think it's a very powerful statement
[43:33] that brother Bentham makes here and he
[43:35] says I'm so glad to know that he can be
[43:37] found among the brokenhearted in our
[43:40] sorrows he's not one that would leave us
[43:42] he stands bias when all has failed and
[43:45] the last hopes of earthly reaching has
[43:48] come to its end he is still God and He
[43:50] loves us he was six he was the
[43:52] expressing of God and he says oh how I
[43:55] believe that he longs for his spirit his
[43:58] people to be so anointed with his spirit
[44:02] that we could go to each other in trials
[44:06] and in troubles how many want to be so
[44:10] you and so anointed like this now I'll
[44:13] tell you one all through the building we
[44:14] would raise our hands if if there had
[44:16] been how many want to be anointed to
[44:18] walk on water boy every hand would have
[44:19] went up right away but you see the
[44:22] Prophet is directing us to this he said
[44:24] that we would be so anointed with his
[44:28] spirit that we could go to each other in
[44:31] trials and troubles and give the
[44:34] expression of his sympathy his sympathy
[44:43] not ours his sympathy and he says as it
[44:47] pours from our hearts that's been born
[44:51] of his spirit to reflect in the church
[44:54] the love of the Living God and I look at
[44:58] in the scriptures you know you think of
[45:01] how that when God Himself become
[45:04] of us he's so subjected himself the
[45:07] Bible records how that Paul will pick
[45:10] this up and in many ways give all angles
[45:13] in the book of Hebrews of how that he
[45:16] himself being a faithful and merciful
[45:18] high priest in things pertaining unto
[45:21] God and we find it in the scriptures to
[45:23] where that the Lord Jesus himself he was
[45:26] indeed moved with compassion we find
[45:29] that there were many times he went into
[45:31] situations and you know then carnal mind
[45:34] could not understand how did he not go
[45:36] there in the pool of siloam
[45:38] and he'll everybody step over different
[45:40] ones it wasn't that he didn't have
[45:43] sympathy the Prophet tells us he had
[45:45] sympathy for everybody who was laying
[45:47] around that pool but he went with a
[45:51] godly compassion to those to that which
[45:54] he was directed to in a very personal
[45:57] manner and here this man we know that he
[45:59] was healed of the Lord he couldn't get
[46:01] to the pool but yet how God came to him
[46:03] and ministered to his needs and to see
[46:06] how that the Lord Jesus has experienced
[46:09] in in this in his corporal body when he
[46:12] was here the Bible says that he is a
[46:15] high priest that can be touched by the
[46:17] feeling of our infirmities it speaks
[46:20] that these things because he was in all
[46:23] points tempted tested tried such as we
[46:26] are yet without sin so to recognize that
[46:29] even by the feeling of our infirmities
[46:31] that even the weaknesses and how that
[46:34] things would be about in our life he is
[46:37] actually moved and touched by our
[46:39] infirmities now I know it's not popular
[46:42] for us when we want to look at it as
[46:44] though to say well I have no infirmities
[46:46] but yet there's no there's a very fine
[46:48] balance on how our confession works the
[46:51] Prophet tells us this and how can
[46:53] overcome he said many people that have
[46:55] cancer will say I do not have cancer he
[46:58] said but the truth of the matter is you
[47:00] do have cancer he said but within it
[47:03] there you need to recognize that God
[47:06] within you is greater than that cancer
[47:09] he said ignoring it will never make it
[47:12] go away but you see at the same time
[47:14] it's not running around and saying I
[47:16] have cancer
[47:17] claiming the box of rattlesnakes it's
[47:20] recognizing this is what has been said
[47:22] but God is greater than this
[47:25] circumstance I always remember whatever
[47:27] it is you're dealing with it's always
[47:29] that God is above that he is the
[47:32] Almighty God Jesus Christ
[47:34] is above that there is no situation no
[47:37] test route what's whatever more that is
[47:39] greater than him we put all things under
[47:42] him so then to think of how that he can
[47:45] be touched or the word be affected with
[47:49] the same feeling to sympathize with one
[47:52] you watch how that this this very life
[47:54] that was projected here in the life of
[47:57] the Lord Jesus when he would walk upon
[47:59] this earth remember there were times and
[48:01] I've said this to you over the weeks
[48:03] where he would look upon the multitudes
[48:05] and he's seen that they were hungry and
[48:08] yet within the midst to think of where
[48:10] his purpose was set he did not look upon
[48:13] that and say that's menial I don't need
[48:15] to pay attention to that whatsoever as a
[48:17] matter of fact God seen that was
[48:19] important so much that he would burden
[48:21] the early church to wear it so that the
[48:23] ministry would not be pulled in many
[48:25] directions that were deacons in place
[48:28] within the church in order to minister
[48:30] to the needs of the people I I tell you
[48:33] that's the great compassion and
[48:34] nurturing of Almighty God aren't you
[48:36] glad for that how that God sees our
[48:38] needs and God just didn't say not that's
[48:40] trivial you you don't need to bother
[48:42] with that but God enjoys in to minister
[48:45] and make himself known to our needs the
[48:47] Bible says he looked upon him with
[48:49] compassion and then and in one place it
[48:51] says he healed all of the sick that they
[48:54] brought to him you everything itself
[48:56] comes down to God's will and many times
[48:58] you know who I'll just say all the time
[49:00] there's no way that we can figure out
[49:03] God's will if somebody goes around and
[49:05] telling you but during a test or trial
[49:07] and they know why this is the will of
[49:09] God or this or that they're lying to you
[49:10] because the real reality of it is you
[49:13] don't know what is going to be the
[49:14] outcome of that test or trial but you do
[49:16] have this promise when he's done I'll
[49:19] come forth pure as gold whatever it is
[49:21] that he's trying to iron out in my life
[49:23] he knows and this has been permitted
[49:26] order that Christ Himself might come
[49:28] further in display in my life so when we
[49:31] look at this watch how but here now the
[49:34] Lord Jesus himself he has ascended up
[49:37] and as he as the sacrifice already been
[49:39] presented he's made himself known to his
[49:41] disciples and now after their of the
[49:44] forty days here he is ascended there to
[49:46] the right hand of God the throne of God
[49:48] here now in a mediatorial work now as
[49:51] the true atonement he's going now to
[49:53] release the very spirit the life now
[49:55] into the Church of the Living God now
[49:58] remember whatever that life was that was
[50:00] manifested in the Lord Jesus Christ when
[50:03] that life itself moves inside of the
[50:06] heart of the Church of the Living God it
[50:08] will not act any different but it will
[50:10] actually manifest the same attributes
[50:13] that was manifested in the Lord Jesus
[50:15] Christ because remember you and I are
[50:18] that of the bride of Jesus Christ that
[50:20] which was taken out of his side and that
[50:22] his life itself would come to dwell
[50:25] inside of us our DNA the real spiritual
[50:28] DNA should not be any different but
[50:30] rather the characteristics of the Lord
[50:32] Jesus Christ are raised up within our
[50:35] life so as he himself was one who could
[50:38] be moved with compassion here then there
[50:40] must be that of his body that can
[50:43] actually be moved with that same
[50:45] compassion by the same Spirit of God
[50:47] now notice here here is Peter in them
[50:49] coming two or three days after that of
[50:51] the day of Pentecost and the Bible says
[50:54] in Hebrews 3:1 Peter and John went up
[50:56] together into the temple at the hour
[50:58] prayer being the ninth hour and a
[51:00] certain man lame from his mother's womb
[51:03] was carried whom they laid at the gate
[51:06] of the temple which is called beautiful
[51:07] to ask alms of them that entered into
[51:10] the temple who's seeing Peter and John
[51:14] about to go into the temple asked Holmes
[51:16] now this is a very peculiar phrase who's
[51:19] saying Peter and John brother ram takes
[51:20] it in the message without money or prize
[51:22] he said there was something different
[51:24] about Peter and John he said there was a
[51:27] holy blush about their face he said here
[51:31] you find there was a young man by the
[51:32] name of John he said he had a holy blush
[51:35] about his face there was something of a
[51:37] joy that was
[51:39] beyond you and I've seen people happy
[51:40] and I think we are happy at times when
[51:42] you go to the store how are you or
[51:44] you're waiting on a restaurant you're
[51:45] happy when they're happy right and if
[51:48] they're not you want to try to make
[51:49] their day a little bit better but you
[51:51] see this was something much deeper than
[51:53] just happiness this was a joy that
[51:56] resonated within their heart that
[51:58] actually was a changing of their
[52:00] countenance there was a presence about
[52:03] them that actually would take a hold of
[52:05] this man who had set by the gate called
[52:07] beautiful little did he know it that he
[52:10] this was his last day of ever being lame
[52:13] he didn't know he didn't realize this
[52:15] was going to be his last day but now
[52:17] here is coming a representation a
[52:19] reflection of the present office of the
[52:21] high priest and now look look at the
[52:24] Bible says in verse 4 and Peter
[52:26] fastening his eyes upon him with John
[52:30] said look on us this is also a marvel
[52:35] it's a marvel because Peter and them are
[52:39] on a mission they're on a mission to go
[52:42] pray but they're able to be so in tune
[52:47] but they just didn't step right over or
[52:50] walk right by but neither is this and I
[52:52] hope you understand me neither is this
[52:55] Peter and John willing something to be
[52:58] so they are moved under the unction of
[53:02] the Holy Ghost but you see they're open
[53:04] for his leading it's not where God's got
[53:08] a problem God's gonna work on them and
[53:10] you know get them all primed but you
[53:12] know they themselves are vessel
[53:14] sanctified vessels that are set aside
[53:16] for his working however he wants to use
[53:19] me when he wants to use me I may never
[53:21] have been used like this before but I am
[53:23] his vessel and however he wants to use
[53:26] me when he wants to use me let me just
[53:28] be in condition but he doesn't have to
[53:31] work on this and work on this to get me
[53:33] in condition let me just be yielded at
[53:36] that moment
[53:37] so Peter fastens or fixes his eyes or
[53:41] looks into the situation he fastening
[53:45] his eyes upon him but John said look on
[53:47] us and he gave heed unto them
[53:50] expecting to receive something of them
[53:52] now what was he expecting to receive
[53:54] money oh but there was something much
[53:57] more than money coming his way that
[53:59] money would have faded it would have it
[54:01] would have a movement there was
[54:02] something greater but you see what's
[54:04] important there had to be an expectation
[54:07] or glory then Peter said silver and gold
[54:11] have I none but such as I have give IV
[54:15] in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[54:18] rise up and walk and he took him by the
[54:21] hand and lifted him up and immediately
[54:23] his feet and ankle bones received
[54:26] strength he leaping stood and walked and
[54:30] entered with them into the temple
[54:32] walking and leaping and praising God so
[54:34] when we look at this here brother
[54:36] Brandon would put it like this here in
[54:38] the message he says you know he said
[54:40] what had taken place he said here is
[54:42] Peter letting him know I can't help you
[54:45] to buy any crutches silver and gold have
[54:47] I none but such as I have he said he had
[54:50] been to buy from him that had to honey
[54:53] and the joys of the line of salvation he
[54:56] had just come two or three days before
[54:58] that from pinnacles where something had
[55:01] happened and that young man sprung with
[55:03] a great big a man to it and looked into
[55:06] his face he said what happened that
[55:09] chain of sympathy the compassion of him
[55:13] that had said I had compassion on the
[55:16] sick that same spirit had taken place in
[55:20] the old fisherman's heart and he said as
[55:23] far as money I don't have any but I want
[55:25] a God that will take its place a million
[55:28] times such as I have Peter himself was a
[55:31] conduit that the sympathy of the high
[55:34] priest could actually be poured out upon
[55:37] the need of this man he was not what
[55:40] Peter and John will baby just were set
[55:42] aside they were waiting on God they just
[55:45] were simply going about their life they
[55:47] clocked in to work that day were not
[55:49] even had any plans that I'm gonna walk
[55:51] over this man I know he's been having
[55:52] trouble in his life know if they just
[55:54] talked into work and then you know the
[55:56] unction came they just had presented
[55:59] themselves as available to Almighty God
[56:03] of this evenin line when you think of it
[56:05] in terms of how that the Prophet would
[56:07] deal with it when it come to the bull
[56:09] when they come to the bees you know
[56:11] brother Ram talks about he said normally
[56:13] when it would come to that of the bees
[56:15] he said that I usually would have
[56:17] started fighting at them and running
[56:23] don't raise your hand how many used to
[56:25] buy wall spray notes heard by the Samuel
[56:31] I believe that quote you better be
[56:33] obedient to the Lord you better not try
[56:35] to take things in your own hands brother
[56:38] Branham was not taking this in his own
[56:40] hands notice where it starts it's not
[56:43] him willing something to be done but
[56:47] here's the situation arises and brother
[56:50] brems says what takes place he said I
[56:52] know it seems childish he said but
[56:54] instead of being afraid
[56:56] I thought those poor little creatures I
[56:58] disturbed you and instead of hating them
[57:01] there was a sympathy in my heart for
[57:04] them oh I wish I could have that all the
[57:08] time if it would I'd be a different
[57:11] person
[57:13] amen Lord that it would be all the time
[57:18] but you realize what is it that still
[57:20] gets in the way us us but you see by
[57:26] God's help with all of these things
[57:28] things that we were looking at even of
[57:30] last week where Paul would speak to the
[57:32] Church of the Living God and speak to us
[57:34] about being tender-hearted if it was so
[57:36] automatic what would Paul take time
[57:38] expressing those things to our life if
[57:40] it was something so automatic then why
[57:43] would Paul take time in Colossians 3
[57:45] Philippians and other places why would
[57:47] he have to express that will better Sam
[57:49] you know the church is made up of three
[57:50] kinds of believers I know that but it's
[57:52] also to acknowledge you and I that
[57:55] Berry's that aspect to encourage us to
[57:57] yield to the presence of God as he could
[58:00] say put on therefore as the holy elect
[58:05] beloved of God bowels of mercy and that
[58:07] word means put on it means to sink into
[58:10] the garment is there if you've been
[58:12] enshrouded with the Holy Ghost born of
[58:14] the Spirit of God the glory
[58:16] is already there all the coloration
[58:18] that's to come out of the seed that now
[58:20] the seed life has come upon it it's all
[58:23] there what has to happen it's us
[58:25] yielding and I'm glad that God helps us
[58:29] aren't you he helps us as he sees what
[58:32] the depth of the need is in our life no
[58:34] wonder that Peter coming out of this
[58:36] particular point and not only this time
[58:39] where he's there at the gate called
[58:41] beautiful but how the love of God was so
[58:43] permeating in his life that Peter could
[58:45] write first Peter 4:7 but the end of all
[58:48] things is at hand be you therefore sober
[58:50] and watch unto prayer now watch this
[58:53] here is the way to make yourself
[58:55] available be sober keeping your mind
[58:58] your focus keeping your attentiveness
[59:00] don't be all scattered with the cares of
[59:03] life and watch unto prayer and above all
[59:08] things have fervent charity not just
[59:12] charity but this word fervent means that
[59:14] which is stretched out have fervent
[59:18] charity among yourself for charity shall
[59:21] cover the multitude of sins let me read
[59:25] this quote again that brother Neville is
[59:27] in prayer here where Billy Bam's asked
[59:29] him to pray before the service and his
[59:30] brother man brother Neville's praying
[59:32] father the great problems and trials of
[59:34] tomorrow will see nothing as long as
[59:37] we're able to hold by hand and walk
[59:40] through with thee they will seem as
[59:44] nothing as long as we're able to hold
[59:46] the hand and walk through with E Levin
[59:49] says truly Lord he says we pray Lord
[59:52] that now would give us a deep-seated
[59:56] compassion one for the other knowing
[59:59] that whilst one is in the deepness of
[1:00:02] trial and the hardness of testing that
[1:00:05] we to one of these days shall go through
[1:00:08] like circumstances God give us the
[1:00:13] spirit of Jesus in us till we feel for
[1:00:17] each other enough until there will be
[1:00:19] unity between us until we can serve thee
[1:00:22] together give us the Spirit of the Lord
[1:00:25] Jesus till we can actually feel for one
[1:00:28] another
[1:00:29] you know brotherman tells us in the
[1:00:30] message divine love he says you can pray
[1:00:32] for the sinner all you want to pray for
[1:00:34] him he said but if you don't make
[1:00:36] contact and try to win favor with them
[1:00:38] he said you'll never do him any good
[1:00:40] prayer is wonderful it's wonderful to
[1:00:43] pray but he says you must also be that
[1:00:46] point of contact amen
[1:00:50] it has to be that way you know so God
[1:00:53] God knows how to humble you and I he
[1:00:55] knows how to put us in peculiar
[1:00:56] situations that will actually break down
[1:00:58] our comfort zone glory Alleluia now
[1:01:03] think of this looking at this when we
[1:01:06] look at it some of the statements that
[1:01:07] we've read and even where Paul would
[1:01:10] would mention here that the God of all
[1:01:12] comfort where he is comforted us in our
[1:01:14] tribulations that by that same comfort
[1:01:17] we might be able to comfort you now when
[1:01:20] you think of this here Paul himself were
[1:01:22] a person to be able to extend comfort
[1:01:26] they must have been able to actually
[1:01:28] receive the comfort in the midst of that
[1:01:31] time to help them and guide them and
[1:01:34] bring them through the whole test the
[1:01:36] trial weren't in the tribulation they
[1:01:38] had to be able to receive it and then
[1:01:40] coming through it then they themselves
[1:01:42] can actually reflect that now you know
[1:01:45] there's things that no doubt throughout
[1:01:47] this assembly that you know there's
[1:01:49] things that maybe you've went through
[1:01:50] nobody else's went through and be like
[1:01:53] you know you trying to stand in my shoes
[1:01:54] you might be able to have a little bit
[1:01:57] of a thought well I know this about a
[1:01:58] pastor but you don't know those things
[1:02:00] by reading neither could I know your job
[1:02:02] or what you do by reading even though
[1:02:04] that I'm there that you know with my
[1:02:05] wife I still do not none understand
[1:02:07] fully everything that she goes through
[1:02:10] she deals with sometimes with emotions
[1:02:12] and the pressures and everything else I
[1:02:14] don't always understand that but I do
[1:02:16] have the word of the Lord that says give
[1:02:18] honor unto her as unto the weaker vessel
[1:02:20] I don't necessarily need to understand
[1:02:23] it but there are times that not within
[1:02:25] sympathy but empathy being able to enter
[1:02:27] in and pray for her not knowing what is
[1:02:30] going on and just simply being able to
[1:02:33] hear to listen and to enter in and so
[1:02:36] when you think of this there are things
[1:02:37] that are so personal to our life there
[1:02:40] are tests there are trials there are
[1:02:42] things that you have gone through then
[1:02:44] maybe myself I've never gone through
[1:02:46] there are things that you've gone
[1:02:48] through and likewise vice versa but that
[1:02:50] steel does not take it away from us
[1:02:52] having a real godly sympathy as a matter
[1:02:56] of fact brother Branham when many would
[1:02:57] come across the platform he said I can
[1:02:59] never help those people unless I myself
[1:03:02] am able to have a feeling for them or in
[1:03:05] another place enter into a fellowship of
[1:03:08] their sufferings now that may take a
[1:03:11] little bit on the platform in order for
[1:03:13] that to take place remember said that's
[1:03:15] why I cannot do that just moving along
[1:03:17] line for me he says this is the way that
[1:03:20] I have to do it so when you look at it
[1:03:22] there are things no doubt cases that
[1:03:24] come right across the platform that
[1:03:27] brother Branham himself personally had
[1:03:29] never experienced certain things like
[1:03:31] you watch where brother BAM will deal
[1:03:33] with situations with nervousness and
[1:03:35] he'll be able to so relate to those
[1:03:38] within nervousness even within
[1:03:40] circumstances that would take place
[1:03:41] throughout the world and when things
[1:03:44] would happen even among people who were
[1:03:46] not church people yet brother Branham
[1:03:48] would have prayer for him right over the
[1:03:50] platform and say I know how it feels you
[1:03:52] remember when John F Kennedy was killed
[1:03:54] you find brother around stopping the
[1:03:56] service and he begins to pray for
[1:03:58] Jacqueline Kennedy all my a beautiful
[1:04:00] prayer but he's entering in with a heart
[1:04:02] of sympathies not condoning the sinful
[1:04:05] life and whatever more but it's entering
[1:04:07] in with sympathy for the situation and I
[1:04:11] look at this that there are things that
[1:04:13] are so personal to our lives things that
[1:04:16] you personally could go through than to
[1:04:18] tell you the truth I and myself may not
[1:04:21] ever be able to fully relate to it
[1:04:23] although I could have sympathy in terms
[1:04:25] of that which would come from the great
[1:04:27] high priests but yet you take somebody
[1:04:30] else that's had that exact experience in
[1:04:32] a certain way and you watch the flow of
[1:04:35] the sympathy from the great high priests
[1:04:38] brother he knows how to get in there and
[1:04:40] be able to pray and minister to that
[1:04:43] need so he comes a little bit more
[1:04:45] direct we has the Church of the Living
[1:04:47] God should have sympathy we should have
[1:04:50] being so anointed with the Spirit of God
[1:04:52] so we could have that feeling to be able
[1:04:54] to go to
[1:04:55] one another but watch this in the
[1:04:57] messageworks is faith express but the
[1:04:59] rams you know speaking regarding a
[1:05:01] brother who's passed on he said one of
[1:05:03] our great precious brothers so dear to
[1:05:05] us he just crossed over in the land and
[1:05:07] everytime I come to this platform
[1:05:10] I guess I'll think of brother Lyle I
[1:05:12] looked over last night and I seen little
[1:05:15] Judy sitting over there and my heart was
[1:05:18] just pounding now I wonder how many of
[1:05:22] everybody else was setting him that
[1:05:24] service that their heart wasn't pounding
[1:05:26] now you see it wasn't that they were
[1:05:28] insensitive there there might have been
[1:05:30] people who were insensitive maybe there
[1:05:32] were people who were just so caught up
[1:05:34] with the cares of life that they just
[1:05:36] could kind of overlook this but then
[1:05:38] again this was something that has
[1:05:40] happened a little time it wasn't
[1:05:41] something that just freshly or recently
[1:05:43] had happened but yet it was nonetheless
[1:05:45] and when brother Branham would catch the
[1:05:47] eye or be able to look there at sister
[1:05:49] Judy he said my heart was just pounding
[1:05:51] I was thinking of how she felt and I
[1:05:57] know when Dad died see now here's the
[1:05:59] experience I know when Dad died he says
[1:06:03] but we only have to go through those
[1:06:06] schools of sufferings to know how the
[1:06:10] other fellow feels now nobody signs up
[1:06:14] for these AP courses in schools of
[1:06:16] suffering matter of fact we don't even
[1:06:19] signed up for the pre-k but you seen
[1:06:23] Claud knows it's schools it's testings
[1:06:25] it's trying's it's we're gone molds and
[1:06:28] makes us it's him working in our life
[1:06:31] and then how that God would come around
[1:06:32] and work in our life it serves to
[1:06:35] minister to someone else
[1:06:37] who's in need brother Brent goes on and
[1:06:41] then Jesus came in called and he's
[1:06:42] talked about you know with death when it
[1:06:44] took place there in the home of Lazarus
[1:06:46] and his sisters he said what a sad
[1:06:48] little hole many of us tonight knows how
[1:06:50] to sympathize with that home when death
[1:06:53] has struck our home and you never know
[1:06:55] what it is until you have to go through
[1:06:58] it once brother Brandon coming along and
[1:07:00] God's power to transform he said we want
[1:07:02] to pray for brother Dimas and sister
[1:07:04] Rose remember they've had an awful heart
[1:07:06] hit in their life in the last he says
[1:07:08] it's father
[1:07:09] his sister now in these last year's but
[1:07:11] you know it's been less than 10 months
[1:07:14] sister Edna also he says so I know how
[1:07:17] to sympathize with brother Dimas I had a
[1:07:20] father brother wife and baby to go with
[1:07:24] in a few days apart so I know how he
[1:07:26] feels this morning he says you only know
[1:07:30] when you stand in them shoes and that's
[1:07:33] when you know how to sympathize blue
[1:07:36] bream is not taking sympathy from the
[1:07:38] rest of the congregation he's simply
[1:07:41] putting it down but there are experience
[1:07:43] through schools of suffering that then
[1:07:46] through that the Holy Spirit the great
[1:07:48] high priests will work in our life to
[1:07:50] pour out that sympathy to be able to
[1:07:53] pray for it in a manner of such a
[1:07:55] greater feeling than what you or I could
[1:07:58] ever reach to now you say brother Samuel
[1:08:00] that has to be the Holy Ghost indeed and
[1:08:02] as the Holy Spirit would come right
[1:08:04] behind those experiences and he takes
[1:08:06] that and you find yourself as brother
[1:08:08] Brent says going beyond the realm of
[1:08:10] reasoning and then you find yourself out
[1:08:13] in a realm where it is love being
[1:08:16] projected where you're entering into the
[1:08:18] feeling of that person so when we think
[1:08:21] of this here you know brother branham
[1:08:23] himself I when I look at this and these
[1:08:25] just some of these statements here that
[1:08:27] I read to you right now in order for
[1:08:28] brother Branham to even stand there on
[1:08:30] the platform to even for him to take
[1:08:33] knowledge and consideration it had to be
[1:08:36] that he himself had been a recipient of
[1:08:40] the sympathy of Almighty God he himself
[1:08:43] would have to be a recipient of the very
[1:08:46] comfort of God you say what are you
[1:08:47] saying by the Samuel because just
[1:08:49] because that something comes along in
[1:08:52] our life does not mean that necessarily
[1:08:54] that a person is actually going to
[1:08:56] receive the comfort of God you and I
[1:08:58] both know there's people you work with
[1:09:00] sometimes people you go to church with
[1:09:02] there's things that they've experienced
[1:09:04] that through the experience instead of
[1:09:06] them actually having an experience where
[1:09:09] they receive comfort and now being able
[1:09:11] to minister it instead its bitterness
[1:09:14] they actually resent what happened but
[1:09:19] you see if they belong to God God's able
[1:09:23] to help him he's able to help him and
[1:09:26] bring him around oh yeah he is faithful
[1:09:29] to do that now and think of this within
[1:09:33] it here there has to be a submission
[1:09:34] look what Paul would say here and let's
[1:09:37] just draw on this for the next few
[1:09:38] moments in Philippians 3 verse 10 that I
[1:09:41] may know him now one day Paul didn't
[1:09:45] knowing Paul knew II Paul knew him not
[1:09:49] by the letter he knew him by personal
[1:09:52] experience but you see Paul recognized
[1:09:55] that oneness itself is a continual
[1:09:58] blending forth of that oneness from the
[1:10:01] soul by divine nature to where his life
[1:10:03] itself is so permeating and flowing
[1:10:06] through our life this is his request
[1:10:08] that I may know him and the power of his
[1:10:12] resurrection he did no resurrection
[1:10:16] power did he not he did but notice the
[1:10:19] request that I may know him and the
[1:10:21] power of his resurrection and the
[1:10:24] Fellowship of his sufferings not just
[1:10:28] his sufferings but the Fellowship of her
[1:10:31] being made conformable unto his death
[1:10:37] think of this within the scripture how
[1:10:40] that Paul would express this brother
[1:10:43] Bram says it like this and I know my
[1:10:45] Redeemer liveth he said we you know we
[1:10:48] thank you for all spraying thank you for
[1:10:51] all who've made the decision long ago
[1:10:53] and have experienced a new life and
[1:10:55] stood on the sacred stands we're here to
[1:10:59] rejoice this morning with them in the
[1:11:01] hopes of the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:11:03] when we too will fellowship with him in
[1:11:06] his resurrection as we fellowship in his
[1:11:10] suffering now you and I are very much
[1:11:12] aware tribulation comes in many forms
[1:11:18] there so there's one form that
[1:11:21] tribulation comes in that every child of
[1:11:24] God will experience and that's
[1:11:26] persecution
[1:11:28] you'll experience persecution even in
[1:11:30] the initial stage of your walk even when
[1:11:33] you've not been born again when you
[1:11:35] begin to confess I got saved the Lord
[1:11:37] touched my life you will start to
[1:11:39] receive persecution because of what you
[1:11:42] are choosing and who you are choosing to
[1:11:45] identify with you see that's the thing
[1:11:47] that gift captures many people's minds
[1:11:49] and they begin to look at will I be able
[1:11:51] to do this or will I be able to do that
[1:11:53] will I be able to stand up to this I'll
[1:11:54] tell you what when you allow him to
[1:11:56] sweep down in your life you'll find that
[1:11:58] there's one on the inside that'll give
[1:12:00] you the grace to be able to stand when
[1:12:03] you consider listen now even when you
[1:12:05] consider that who it is that you're
[1:12:07] approaching is the very creator himself
[1:12:09] the Living God that you yourself would
[1:12:12] submit and be drawn to him in a love
[1:12:16] affair and you look and get a real look
[1:12:18] at him brother the things of this world
[1:12:20] it's not how can I overcome this how can
[1:12:23] I get beyond this but you yourself are
[1:12:25] so overcome by the look of the Lord
[1:12:28] Jesus in in your life that those things
[1:12:31] themselves fade and the things continue
[1:12:34] to fade I'll tell you right here this
[1:12:35] morning you and me continue to fade so
[1:12:38] when we look at this here how
[1:12:40] tribulation it will come persecution
[1:12:43] there's sickness all of these things for
[1:12:45] before for example within these bodies
[1:12:48] right here these bodies are still
[1:12:49] subject to sin I'm not talking about a
[1:12:52] sinful nature I'm talking about sickness
[1:12:54] can come you can be prayed for and God
[1:12:57] deliver you and then you'll get sick
[1:12:58] again
[1:12:59] and we recognize the bodies themselves
[1:13:01] they age but yet within it when new life
[1:13:04] has moved in there is a life on the
[1:13:07] inside that witnesses in the midst of it
[1:13:09] and through that life being there it
[1:13:12] actually will close us to submit our
[1:13:15] characters to be molded by the very Lamb
[1:13:19] of God Himself working in our life now
[1:13:22] remember he will never drag us lay his
[1:13:24] hands on us he doesn't work in
[1:13:26] threatening he wants us to submit to his
[1:13:30] working I'm glad that every once in a
[1:13:34] while he knows how to give the right
[1:13:35] type of anesthesia Coahoma he knows
[1:13:40] exactly what kind of things
[1:13:41] amidst to drop our way to just calls us
[1:13:44] to to rest and to and to just be an ease
[1:13:46] within him so when we look at this you
[1:13:49] know you think of it that how that Paul
[1:13:51] himself would speak this in second
[1:13:53] Corinthians four I just referred to it
[1:13:55] he speaks of how that we are troubled on
[1:13:58] every side everything that is going on
[1:14:00] that is around this Paul would speak
[1:14:02] about how we feel he would speak about
[1:14:04] were perplexed but we're not in despair
[1:14:06] were persecuted but we're not forsaken
[1:14:08] we're cast down but we're not destroyed
[1:14:10] but he goes on to tell that we are
[1:14:12] always bearing about in the body the
[1:14:15] dying of the Lord Jesus that the life
[1:14:17] also might be made manifest in our body
[1:14:20] that's what we desire right we want his
[1:14:23] life to be reflected in our life that's
[1:14:26] the desire from within our hearts now
[1:14:28] when we think of this thought if I just
[1:14:30] let me work with this year for a few
[1:14:32] moments in that particular verse of
[1:14:34] scripture that I may know him and the
[1:14:37] power of his resurrection and just look
[1:14:39] at the thought just for a moment and the
[1:14:41] power of his resurrection in 2nd
[1:14:44] Corinthians chapter 1 verse 8 here is
[1:14:46] Paul relaying this to the Corinthian
[1:14:49] church this is just the very next verse
[1:14:50] what would take place after we opening
[1:14:53] our test he said for we would not
[1:14:55] brethren have you ignorant of our
[1:14:57] trouble which came to us in Asia that we
[1:15:01] were pressed out of measure above
[1:15:04] strength in so much that we despaired
[1:15:08] even of life now it wasn't that they
[1:15:14] hated life that's not what despair even
[1:15:16] though it's the same word that I
[1:15:17] referred to here earlier but it's where
[1:15:19] that within the end of it there there is
[1:15:22] without without God stepping in I mean
[1:15:25] this looks like this is it now think of
[1:15:28] it Paul goes on to relay these things he
[1:15:31] would comfort the Thessalonica Church he
[1:15:34] would comfort the Ephesian Church
[1:15:35] because think of how that the church is
[1:15:37] within that time they themselves it's
[1:15:39] obvious that when Paul himself would be
[1:15:41] afflicted you know it would it would for
[1:15:43] him bring him into prayer but Paul could
[1:15:44] sensed a little bit of a nervousness and
[1:15:46] Paul would bring it back to and say hey
[1:15:48] this suffering of tribulation don't
[1:15:50] worry about
[1:15:50] I would that you would not be anxious
[1:15:52] with this because how that God himself
[1:15:54] has spoken concerning it and Paul would
[1:15:57] speak even to the Corinthian church and
[1:15:59] let her know you know how we apostles
[1:16:01] were appointed unto death now to think
[1:16:03] of that you're appointed unto death you
[1:16:05] just don't know when it's going to come
[1:16:07] will you realize this morning you are I
[1:16:10] don't have the guarantee of even walking
[1:16:13] out this door that isn't to scare us
[1:16:17] it's just we we do not have the say so
[1:16:20] of how long that we live upon this earth
[1:16:23] that's in the hands of Almighty God in
[1:16:26] the book of Job that says that he holds
[1:16:28] and determines our ins it's not in us
[1:16:32] but notice Paul himself is letting it be
[1:16:35] known that in this time right here we
[1:16:37] even despaired even life but we have the
[1:16:40] sentence of death in ourselves that we
[1:16:43] should not trust in ourselves and might
[1:16:48] I say that you and I have that same
[1:16:50] sentence of death if we try to trust in
[1:16:52] ourselves but what did Paul say but in
[1:16:55] God which raises the dead it was gonna
[1:17:00] take God to move on this situation if
[1:17:04] Paul and them were to walk out alive so
[1:17:10] the sentence of death there had to be a
[1:17:12] resolve within it that's this scripture
[1:17:15] relates that calling them were able to
[1:17:18] come to a resolve and looking to God and
[1:17:21] know the Lord if this is the end this
[1:17:23] will be the end but there no doubt
[1:17:25] remember faith will always find the
[1:17:28] perfect will of God
[1:17:29] you with me somebody can look like
[1:17:31] they're on death's door from crossing
[1:17:33] over that don't mean oh my they must be
[1:17:35] a gonna go ahead and pass but yet that
[1:17:37] don't mean that it might be that it may
[1:17:39] not be God's will but God will turn
[1:17:41] right back around if it's not his will
[1:17:42] he will raise them right out I don't
[1:17:44] care how far gone they could have even
[1:17:46] have coated but yet God Himself will
[1:17:49] move if it's not their time to go Omaha
[1:17:54] so now for think of this here who
[1:17:57] delivered us from so great a death and
[1:18:00] death deliver
[1:18:03] we trust that he will yet deliver us Wow
[1:18:09] he delivered us from a great death and
[1:18:13] we're trusting he's going to keep on
[1:18:15] delivering us Paul knew hey we're going
[1:18:18] to be in situations we're going to need
[1:18:20] his deliverance you're also helping
[1:18:24] together by prayer for us that for the
[1:18:26] gift bestowed upon us by the means of
[1:18:28] many persons thinks may be given by many
[1:18:30] on our behalf now to think of this
[1:18:33] within our lives human nature is
[1:18:36] survival
[1:18:38] human nature is survival when things
[1:18:41] would come our way our quick reaction
[1:18:44] would be to move and to do what fly you
[1:18:46] know it's it's run to get out of it to
[1:18:48] get out of the situation it's human
[1:18:51] nature within this but to think here is
[1:18:53] Paul in them they're not able to run
[1:18:56] anywhere but yet they have a place of
[1:18:58] refuge right where they're at in
[1:19:00] captivity the Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:19:02] ministry comfort and grace to them if
[1:19:05] you permit me to say it this way no
[1:19:07] doubt the anesthesia of the love of God
[1:19:09] is moving down oh my there you're
[1:19:12] talking about into anxiety pills it was
[1:19:15] moving down by the comfort of Almighty
[1:19:17] God for palling them to be able to stand
[1:19:20] within this do you understand this is
[1:19:22] not the natural DNA of a man it's not
[1:19:27] our natural DNA this has to be something
[1:19:32] and one who is greater in us in the
[1:19:36] midst of this time
[1:19:37] no wonder Peter could say that the
[1:19:40] trying of your faith is more precious
[1:19:43] than gold that it might be found to the
[1:19:46] praise and honor and glory of the Lord
[1:19:49] Jesus Christ now tell your truthfully
[1:19:51] sometimes we need the power of the
[1:19:53] Resurrection to operate to bring us out
[1:19:56] of despair sometimes we've been in
[1:19:59] despair and we need the power of the
[1:20:01] Resurrection not just in coming to
[1:20:03] change my body or raise it up if I go by
[1:20:05] the way of the grave there are times
[1:20:07] coming out of a test or trial and just
[1:20:09] to put it frankly every test or trial
[1:20:11] that we come through it's the power of
[1:20:13] the resurrection
[1:20:14] working in our life because before the
[1:20:17] Lord Jesus himself could ever be raised
[1:20:20] from the grave and we look at that
[1:20:21] triumph in Easter morning let me remind
[1:20:24] you he had to submit himself on to death
[1:20:28] I I find it a marvel in the scriptures
[1:20:30] in Philippians of how they Paul moved by
[1:20:32] the unction the Holy Ghost would say and
[1:20:34] he being found in fashion as a man who
[1:20:38] MA here is God Himself being found in
[1:20:41] fashion as a man and yet he was able to
[1:20:44] submit himself it wasn't easy
[1:20:47] the Prophet tells us he sprayed strong
[1:20:49] prayers contending with himself who do
[1:20:54] you contend with yourself he contended
[1:20:59] with himself he did not say oh boy the
[1:21:02] cross he prayed three times let it pass
[1:21:03] from me the Bible says in the book of
[1:21:06] Hebrews that he endured it for the joy
[1:21:09] that was set before him that which was
[1:21:13] afterwards there's Rhian door but it
[1:21:16] ain't him because with all glory to God
[1:21:18] this trial now we endure by his comfort
[1:21:21] his grace ministering to us to help us
[1:21:24] through it so we need that in times that
[1:21:27] the Lord would help us in despair
[1:21:28] because sometimes going right through
[1:21:29] the midst of a trial we can get down we
[1:21:33] can get discouraged I know sometimes we
[1:21:36] can try our best I'm gonna put on the
[1:21:38] right attitude I'm gonna be and we've
[1:21:39] gotten you know the quotes we got the
[1:21:40] scriptures going I'm gonna do this and
[1:21:42] I'm gonna it's you trying it's me trying
[1:21:45] but I know what should we do at that
[1:21:48] time just why don't you just worship Him
[1:21:50] a little bit just just worship him and
[1:21:53] invite him when we're trying to do it
[1:21:57] we're keeping him at bay but remember it
[1:21:59] must be his comfort invite him that he
[1:22:04] himself will comfort you in the midst of
[1:22:06] that time now thank you of this here we
[1:22:08] need that because you know there's many
[1:22:10] times we feel like we've got all we can
[1:22:12] do you're at the end it's like the woman
[1:22:17] she spent all her living on all the
[1:22:19] doctors she was at her end but then when
[1:22:23] she got when she was at her in that's
[1:22:26] when Jesus said I'll take that case
[1:22:29] it didn't mean that everything that was
[1:22:31] done all she shouldn't spend money she's
[1:22:33] a no he allowed her to go through all of
[1:22:36] that that he might manifest his care do
[1:22:40] you realize if she had been bettered by
[1:22:43] the circumstance she would have never
[1:22:45] been able to receive from him she would
[1:22:49] have been so bitter that what she needed
[1:22:51] her bitterness from going through the
[1:22:53] circumstance would have closed her off
[1:22:57] god help us we need that resurrection
[1:23:03] power to move in our heart we needed to
[1:23:06] move in our hearts as wives as husbands
[1:23:10] resurrection power we need that
[1:23:13] resurrection power to deliver us when
[1:23:16] bloom wants to set in when despair wants
[1:23:19] to set in when oppressive thoughts wants
[1:23:22] to set in
[1:23:22] we need a matter of a station of that
[1:23:25] resurrection power remember before he
[1:23:34] could be raised he had to submit what I
[1:23:39] want that resurrection pop you have to
[1:23:41] submit everything has been bought on
[1:23:44] submission submission is recognizing him
[1:23:47] to be the greater one he's gone so many
[1:23:53] times the Scriptures quoted resist the
[1:23:55] devil here free from you a key phrase is
[1:23:57] missed submit yourselves therefore to
[1:24:02] God
[1:24:03] that's the first thing cement means
[1:24:07] voluntarily placing yourself your life
[1:24:11] under him then resist the devil because
[1:24:14] it isn't your power my power it's God's
[1:24:18] power
[1:24:20] Goodrem said he don't have to obey me
[1:24:23] he said Satan you don't have to obey me
[1:24:25] but you have to obey the voice of the
[1:24:28] one I represent
[1:24:31] hallelu girl repeater God
[1:24:35] now watch Paul here in this second
[1:24:38] Corinthians let's keep moving through
[1:24:39] the scriptures here a little bit on this
[1:24:40] let you're very familiar with this point
[1:24:42] in the scripture here is Paul he's
[1:24:45] speaking about the things that he
[1:24:46] himself has been going through in verse
[1:24:48] 7 as 2nd Corinthians 12 and lest I
[1:24:51] should get exalted above measure through
[1:24:53] the abundance of the revelations there
[1:24:55] was given to me a thorn in the flesh the
[1:24:58] messenger of Satan to buff at me let's
[1:25:00] just clear this up you've heard him say
[1:25:01] many times but let's just clear it out
[1:25:03] this was not sin Paul was not saying oh
[1:25:08] I got a problem with Lawson that no
[1:25:10] that's not what this is this was not sin
[1:25:17] he said to me a thorn in the flesh the
[1:25:21] messenger of Satan to buff at me lest I
[1:25:25] should be exalted above measure what
[1:25:27] understanding he's recognizing this has
[1:25:32] come to keep me no not always dragging
[1:25:38] around but to where that God can use him
[1:25:42] he's realized this
[1:25:44] it's needful Paul realizes there's still
[1:25:47] that part in the first birth of pride
[1:25:50] that can raise up I need this but you
[1:25:56] see this was not Paul's understanding
[1:25:59] this was the understanding of the Lord
[1:26:01] given to Paul you think about what rest
[1:26:05] this brought to Paul then for this one
[1:26:08] thing I besought the Lord thrice that it
[1:26:12] might depart from me and he sent unto me
[1:26:16] my grace is sufficient for thee for my
[1:26:18] strength is made perfect in weakness
[1:26:20] most gladly therefore I will rather
[1:26:25] glory in my infirmities I may say help
[1:26:28] me Lord I'll raise both of my hands help
[1:26:33] me Lord
[1:26:33] Lou the same you same there and no
[1:26:35] there's been there's been times but you
[1:26:37] know where it's not every time it's just
[1:26:39] when I say I need
[1:26:41] more of this I need this degree I need
[1:26:45] to come into this degree but notice now
[1:26:48] notice Paul brings this Paul brings this
[1:26:51] from not just the situation where his
[1:26:54] sight because after God had made himself
[1:26:56] known to to Paul there on the road to
[1:26:58] Damascus remember his eyes were
[1:27:00] constantly affected his eyesight would
[1:27:02] come and go he would pray and then think
[1:27:05] about the first time that Paul prayed
[1:27:06] now Paul listen Paul this was a man who
[1:27:09] had miracles that accompanied his
[1:27:11] ministry is that right there were blind
[1:27:14] people that were that were healed eyes
[1:27:15] that came about there were Devils casts
[1:27:17] on all of this within his ministry and
[1:27:20] yet Paul himself when this would have
[1:27:22] flicked his eyes he besought the Lord he
[1:27:24] asked God for deliverance Lord heal me
[1:27:27] of this and you know what the Lord came
[1:27:29] by and He healed him but then it came
[1:27:32] again and Paul prayed again Lord deliver
[1:27:36] me now Paul was praying like you and I
[1:27:38] would pray in that Lord deliver me in
[1:27:41] the sense that it'll never ever bother
[1:27:43] me again and there are things that that
[1:27:46] deliverance comes in that way that there
[1:27:48] are things that will never ever bother
[1:27:50] us again
[1:27:51] where God will so completely heal our
[1:27:54] body to where that affliction will never
[1:27:57] stick its head up again
[1:27:59] I'm Thomas Lee I'm talking about with us
[1:28:01] walking in the right crowd with the
[1:28:03] right profession staying under you know
[1:28:05] in fellowship with believers but I'm
[1:28:06] saying that if even if we do all of that
[1:28:08] there are times when there are
[1:28:10] infirmities there are weaknesses there
[1:28:12] are things then all of a sudden you
[1:28:13] might go for a year two years or
[1:28:15] whatever more and then here this thing
[1:28:17] comes on again and you're praying oh
[1:28:19] lord god lord give me strength over this
[1:28:21] Lord heal me Lord of this Lord help me
[1:28:23] with this Lord God and yet then God will
[1:28:26] move right in at that time it may not
[1:28:28] come in the same timeframe as it did
[1:28:29] before but then here what it might come
[1:28:32] again you see what Paul is God is
[1:28:34] teaching Paul is that Paul himself for
[1:28:37] this condition now you can't make this
[1:28:39] up I can't make this up I can't tell you
[1:28:42] this for your life and you can't tell me
[1:28:44] this from my life nobody could tell Paul
[1:28:46] this this was not some of them went up
[1:28:47] to Paul and said hey Paul by the way you
[1:28:49] know that condition you got your body I
[1:28:51] just think that God is gonna let that
[1:28:52] come and go because it's just gonna keep
[1:28:54] you
[1:28:54] Oh hehe Paul wouldn't received it like
[1:28:56] that Paul had to receive this from God
[1:28:59] so it just goes to show we don't have to
[1:29:01] make this up Paul wasn't drumming this
[1:29:03] up Paul was not doing that at all but
[1:29:05] Paul recognized as God helped him do you
[1:29:08] realize the help of God ministered to
[1:29:11] him so that Paul was not praying in a
[1:29:14] manner of deliverance of that this will
[1:29:16] never bother me again but he realized as
[1:29:19] God ministered to him that through the
[1:29:21] midst of it glory me in the midst of it
[1:29:25] that God's grace is sufficient to carry
[1:29:27] me through Paul could realize it's gonna
[1:29:30] come and it's gonna go
[1:29:31] did it not weaken it did it would weaken
[1:29:34] his flesh think about when things have
[1:29:37] come around your way you know it's funny
[1:29:39] when we get far removed from pain and
[1:29:40] whatever more sometimes we we kind of
[1:29:43] forget you know certain things you know
[1:29:45] it's like in the summer when you kind of
[1:29:46] forget how it was to feel sick and then
[1:29:51] one of the chicken Pig flus or whatever
[1:29:53] more comes around your way and then you
[1:29:55] remember oh wow I forgot this of how
[1:29:58] this feels
[1:30:02] God helps us remember those certain
[1:30:04] things so that we're able to really
[1:30:08] stand with sympathy for one another
[1:30:14] you realize brother Graham tells us here
[1:30:16] on the platform here's a woman that has
[1:30:18] stigmatized stigmatism in her eyes and
[1:30:21] brother brems says it's because you're
[1:30:22] nervous sister he said I know there's
[1:30:24] not many people that sever simplifies
[1:30:26] with you as a matter of fact many people
[1:30:27] just told you to get beside yourself wow
[1:30:30] that's real sympathy in it we were gonna
[1:30:34] face this thing know that and that's
[1:30:36] ignorance it never did and one bit of
[1:30:38] good for her but what did it
[1:30:41] sympathy God moved behind that need it
[1:30:46] lost why here's one standing right here
[1:30:48] that knew what nervousness was how many
[1:30:51] times you read brother Branham praying
[1:30:52] on the on the platform people with
[1:30:53] nervousness and he says God I'm standing
[1:30:56] here right now Lord God with myself with
[1:30:57] nervousness shaking ready to run off
[1:31:00] this platform but Lord would you touch
[1:31:03] my sister
[1:31:06] so Paul he's able here to glory and his
[1:31:10] infirmities not didn't mean that Paul
[1:31:12] walked around let's let's let's look at
[1:31:14] this here he didn't mean that Paul would
[1:31:16] walk around and say praise God I got an
[1:31:18] eye problem can I testify I got bad
[1:31:21] eyesight no that's not what this is Paul
[1:31:24] says I will glory in other words I will
[1:31:28] glorify God even when this comes upon my
[1:31:32] life where my praise where everything is
[1:31:35] directed is to God Lord your faithful
[1:31:38] Paul you need help getting up the step
[1:31:40] but God's good Lord you're faithful
[1:31:47] these were not empty statements he was
[1:31:49] glorifying God well this next one's a
[1:31:54] big statement therefore I take pleasure
[1:31:57] in infirmities help me Lord
[1:32:03] in reproaches in necessities in
[1:32:07] persecutions in distress is for Christ's
[1:32:11] sake for when I am weak then I am strong
[1:32:15] it shouldn't be no Marvel brother Graham
[1:32:18] tells us in the church age book he said
[1:32:20] we need the Lord to teach us how to be
[1:32:25] christ-like in suffering how can he
[1:32:28] teach us if we don't go to school all
[1:32:32] the way you can teach us how to be
[1:32:33] christ-like when suffering we got to go
[1:32:35] to schools of suffering now I know some
[1:32:40] of you you take different courses than
[1:32:42] me and I take different courses from you
[1:32:43] but God knows what courses are named
[1:32:45] I need maybe I need the remedial math
[1:32:48] maybe you're in trigonometry right now
[1:32:49] you pray for me because maybe you're in
[1:32:51] remedial english and i'm an AP right now
[1:32:55] come on friends cuz there ain't none of
[1:32:58] you all on AP including me so it's a
[1:33:06] submission to the very testing of
[1:33:10] all-mighty God you know because human
[1:33:12] nature is where many times we're looking
[1:33:15] and how to get out of things
[1:33:19] and we're not downplaying that we're
[1:33:22] talking that's human nature to look how
[1:33:25] to get out of it God is taking Paul as
[1:33:29] he's revealed personally nopal Paul's
[1:33:31] focus then is not in that manner to
[1:33:34] where it would be completely deliverance
[1:33:36] in that way what does that do it
[1:33:38] actually brings a stability and a
[1:33:40] settling within Paul
[1:33:42] so Paul realizes hey there ain't nothing
[1:33:44] in my life there ain't nothing holding
[1:33:45] got back from completely touching my
[1:33:47] eyes to where this will never come back
[1:33:49] but it actually removes that a place
[1:33:52] that Satan would be able to come and
[1:33:54] poke at him and say he don't love you he
[1:33:56] don't care for you like that other
[1:33:57] brother did or this or and that it
[1:33:59] actually removes that so this
[1:34:00] understanding it removes it to where
[1:34:03] that Paul is able to glory in the Lord
[1:34:05] now watch this as Paul could go on to
[1:34:07] express here in second Timothy chapter 3
[1:34:09] he goes on and he talks about in verse
[1:34:12] 11 the persecutions and afflictions
[1:34:14] he's calling these things - Timothy's
[1:34:16] attention all of those things that I
[1:34:18] came unto me at Antioch Iconium and
[1:34:20] Lystra what persecutions I endured but
[1:34:25] out of them all the Lord delivered me
[1:34:30] now that delivered me did not mean they
[1:34:32] went away it just simply means he was
[1:34:37] delivered and he lived to tell of God's
[1:34:40] comfort it was a witness and an
[1:34:44] encouragement even to these believers
[1:34:47] now think of this here when then when
[1:34:48] Paul would come from one city the next
[1:34:50] how did you get here well um they let me
[1:34:53] down in the basket
[1:34:54] oh yeah this is your Paul you the
[1:35:02] ministry were Devils are cast out and
[1:35:05] the sick is healed and you say you let
[1:35:08] down in a basket yeah tell us how that
[1:35:14] happened well I was fasting and I was
[1:35:16] praying no penny what the scripture says
[1:35:18] Paul learned it from somebody coming and
[1:35:20] telling him come on now
[1:35:25] they're laying in wait for you so Paul
[1:35:29] was look at look at this humility Paul
[1:35:31] was not in a place with less gun I'm the
[1:35:33] messenger of the house I'll take control
[1:35:35] of this city ah that was not it he
[1:35:39] submitted himself in that way to be let
[1:35:44] down by a basket how'd you get delivered
[1:35:49] now I'm sure in that service mile there
[1:35:51] were testimonies you know how God
[1:35:53] delivered people blinded eyes were open
[1:35:55] and such pumping can you tell us it's
[1:35:58] good to see here tonight Paul tell us
[1:35:59] how tell us how God delivered you well I
[1:36:02] heard they were had a garrison around
[1:36:04] the city of Damascus and some of the
[1:36:06] brothers you know we're talking to me
[1:36:07] about it and and and we just you know we
[1:36:09] decided to that night they're gonna let
[1:36:11] me down by the side of the wall but
[1:36:12] praise God God delivered me don't you
[1:36:17] see this is where friends I don't care
[1:36:19] look listen to me now very carefully it
[1:36:21] might be that God has moved and a
[1:36:23] miracle has taken place in your life
[1:36:25] where maybe you didn't have to go
[1:36:27] through a surgery you didn't have to go
[1:36:29] through something like that and then
[1:36:30] there might be another brother or sister
[1:36:32] that's had to pass right under the knife
[1:36:33] it might be for the exact same thing let
[1:36:36] me just tell you this
[1:36:37] there's not one greater than the other
[1:36:39] it still is the Lord that has delivered
[1:36:42] you don't ever be ashamed of the
[1:36:47] deliverance of the Lord and don't ever
[1:36:50] try to put it in a box to where it be
[1:36:52] more glorious if it's this way I asked
[1:36:55] you the question would it have been more
[1:36:57] glorious for God to change Abraham and
[1:37:00] Sarah and not make them wait 25 years or
[1:37:02] was it more glorious that after 25 years
[1:37:06] the baby came as a matter of fact
[1:37:09] brother BAM tells us and believe in then
[1:37:11] believe us now this he says it takes
[1:37:13] greater faith to believe God by taking a
[1:37:16] promise he said then it does for a
[1:37:18] miracle to take place because why you
[1:37:23] take the promise and the devil is going
[1:37:24] to try you on that promise you've got a
[1:37:27] span of time and you're confessing that
[1:37:29] promise maybe you're afraid for right
[1:37:31] here and all of a sudden the power of
[1:37:33] God has moved through your life you
[1:37:34] don't mean you may not live back
[1:37:36] to your seat but you might win back to
[1:37:38] your seat but you know right there
[1:37:39] within your heart the power of the
[1:37:41] Resurrection has struck and lifted that
[1:37:44] promise to you personally and you say
[1:37:46] praise God
[1:37:47] I'm delivered and still walking back
[1:37:50] with a limp on your leg but you see it's
[1:37:52] already risen in your heart you've
[1:37:55] already been delivered in your heart
[1:37:56] it's over yeah all that live godly in
[1:38:05] Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution
[1:38:08] this will buy many people don't want to
[1:38:11] live for the Lord they don't want to
[1:38:13] suffer persecution it's okay when
[1:38:16] they're around Christian people but when
[1:38:18] they get out from around Christian
[1:38:20] people and they get around their buddies
[1:38:21] and whatever more they go right back to
[1:38:23] the same way you know why they do not
[1:38:25] have a power within them to actually
[1:38:28] hold them Association is not good enough
[1:38:33] but this is what accompanies those who
[1:38:36] live godly in christ jesus persecution
[1:38:41] now there's not one of us sticking our
[1:38:43] hands I'm saying I'll take a dose I'll
[1:38:45] take some persecution yeah then none of
[1:38:49] us will be that foolish but yet we know
[1:38:52] as Peter would express to us by the
[1:38:54] Spirit of God rejoice Oh Lord
[1:38:58] you mean I've got to be told to rejoice
[1:39:00] you mean that's not just something to
[1:39:01] just automatic you know what he's
[1:39:06] speaking to sons and daughters of God
[1:39:08] the Spirit of God moving on our life
[1:39:11] removes the amnesia that I am a son and
[1:39:14] daughter of God but the word come and
[1:39:16] forth reminds you and I you have a
[1:39:18] jurisdiction over your own self the
[1:39:22] authority we can consent to that yield
[1:39:25] to it submit to it then it comes forth
[1:39:27] to minister in our lives
[1:39:31] notice this second Timothy 4 I'm coming
[1:39:34] down 2nd Timothy 4 I need a long runway
[1:39:37] but I'm coming 2nd Timothy 4 verse 17
[1:39:40] notwithstanding here Paul here he is at
[1:39:43] the latter part the departure in his
[1:39:45] life notwithstanding the Lord stood with
[1:39:48] me and
[1:39:49] Trenton me that by me the preaching
[1:39:52] might be fully known and that all the
[1:39:55] Gentiles might hear and I was delivered
[1:39:59] out of the mouth of the line not just
[1:40:04] the presence the mouth I was rescued did
[1:40:10] God come down and take the line away no
[1:40:12] he just brought him through and the Lord
[1:40:15] shall deliver me from every evil work
[1:40:18] and will preserve me unto his heavenly
[1:40:21] kingdom to whom be glory for ever and
[1:40:23] ever so you see as God moved as he was
[1:40:27] moving here in the early church it was
[1:40:29] not them drawing attention to themselves
[1:40:31] but it was the very life of Christ on
[1:40:34] display in their life that actually it
[1:40:37] was drawing that II the evil spirits
[1:40:39] drawing Satan to where Satan was so
[1:40:42] stirred up at the working and the
[1:40:44] reflection there of what was going on
[1:40:46] their life do you realize brother Ram
[1:40:47] tells us he said on the day of Pentecost
[1:40:49] when they were filled with the Spirit of
[1:40:51] God he said Satan never even got out of
[1:40:52] his bed that morning but after gate
[1:40:55] called beautiful he said that's when
[1:40:58] Satan got up sentencing huh
[1:40:59] why it's a life being reflected and
[1:41:03] going forth that's what got Satan upset
[1:41:08] so when that life is being reflected
[1:41:10] can't you see while he tries to stifle
[1:41:12] why he tries to keep back why tries to
[1:41:14] busy so many other things around us I'll
[1:41:17] tell you just as we said moments ago you
[1:41:18] take something that God has dealt with
[1:41:20] your heart on it and you might say well
[1:41:22] I'm not all the way there yet but if you
[1:41:23] can stand on that and say I'm recognize
[1:41:25] that's God's Word and you stand on that
[1:41:27] watch God come and be a defense and back
[1:41:30] up because you're standing on the word
[1:41:33] and as more the word comes you keep
[1:41:35] taking that word you keep standing on
[1:41:37] that word and you watch that the Lord
[1:41:39] continues to mount the defense within
[1:41:42] your life mm-hmm girl repeater God so
[1:41:46] here remember its Jobe would say he put
[1:41:48] strengthen us think about even how that
[1:41:50] here was Peter you know Peter didn't
[1:41:52] know when they put Peter in jail that
[1:41:54] time James was killed but the Bible
[1:42:00] tells us prayer was being made
[1:42:02] for Peter continually Peter and James
[1:42:05] but to look at it here James his life
[1:42:08] God goes ahead and brings him on home
[1:42:11] and here is Peter and Peter the Bible
[1:42:16] says that the angel the Lord in acts 12
[1:42:19] the angel of the Lord comes in to Peter
[1:42:22] and says stand up put your garment on
[1:42:25] gird yourself it's time to go now here
[1:42:29] they were they were praying and Peter it
[1:42:33] says it like this in verse 11 when Peter
[1:42:36] was come to himself oh I'll think of
[1:42:39] that Peter didn't know what was going on
[1:42:47] well that Peter was having to pinch
[1:42:49] himself the Bible said when he came to
[1:42:53] himself now I know of a surety that the
[1:42:58] Lord hath sent his angel and hath
[1:43:00] delivered me out of the hand of Herod
[1:43:02] and from all the expectation of the
[1:43:04] people of the Jews they were ready to
[1:43:08] kill him but God said I'm not done with
[1:43:10] him yet you realize who Peter gives the
[1:43:14] glory to God hath sent his angel the
[1:43:19] governor and everybody else of the land
[1:43:21] will never have went down to the sale of
[1:43:24] where he was they would give orders for
[1:43:25] other people to go down but God Himself
[1:43:28] came down to where Peter was that same
[1:43:32] God that came down to where Peter was is
[1:43:35] the same God
[1:43:36] that comes down to where you and I are
[1:43:38] at that same God comes right down in the
[1:43:42] power of his resurrection when we've
[1:43:44] been in despair in the midst of the
[1:43:46] tribulation in the midst of the trial
[1:43:48] that same God the age of the Lord comes
[1:43:52] down as we've submitted ourselves to him
[1:43:54] and asking him lord help my attitude
[1:43:57] Lord help me in the midst of this Lord I
[1:43:59] want to give you glory I want to give
[1:44:01] you praise it's inviting his presence to
[1:44:06] deliver us you see this is why you can
[1:44:10] see that we need help because human
[1:44:13] nature is always too
[1:44:16] look for a way out human nature is
[1:44:20] always to tell somebody well ok you got
[1:44:22] this problem here he's reading that's a
[1:44:24] problem see it's because it just isn't
[1:44:25] it that's anybody can do that
[1:44:29] there are times for that but we're so
[1:44:31] interested in trying to get things out
[1:44:34] there's a part of human nature get out
[1:44:36] of trouble here get out of this here oh
[1:44:37] Lord I can't wait til I get done with
[1:44:39] the tribulation I can't wait til I get
[1:44:41] done with the test
[1:44:42] don't miss the comfort of the Lord you
[1:44:48] see through the midst of it it's God
[1:44:50] taking self away from us to realize
[1:44:54] first of all he knows what he's doing
[1:44:59] this is for his glory not mine and
[1:45:03] whatever and however that this would
[1:45:05] choose to be if if it is if it ever
[1:45:07] comes out to be a blessing to be a help
[1:45:10] to somebody else in his body then so be
[1:45:13] it Lord but where it starts with it's
[1:45:16] for his glory no wonder that David could
[1:45:20] say in a very familiar reading of
[1:45:22] Scripture it's a funny how that this
[1:45:25] scripture is what is wrote on the back
[1:45:27] of cards of funeral homes
[1:45:29] it's a scripture that's wrote over and
[1:45:32] over many times we hear it when we have
[1:45:34] funerals but the Lord is my shepherd and
[1:45:39] I shall not want see how this is
[1:45:43] personal now this is personal between us
[1:45:46] and the Lord
[1:45:48] he's my shepherd well if he's my
[1:45:51] shepherd that means I'm his sheep I
[1:45:55] shall not want he maketh me to lie down
[1:46:01] in green pastures does not he give us
[1:46:06] solitude rest and peace he does just
[1:46:09] like he did in the early church at times
[1:46:11] they would have rest he leadeth me
[1:46:14] beside the still waters so that I can
[1:46:16] look and I can see the reflection in the
[1:46:22] waters he leads me there he wants me to
[1:46:26] see myself
[1:46:28] in him look at this verse he restoreth
[1:46:36] my soul he does this who my shepherd it
[1:46:48] doesn't it isn't that I need to get born
[1:46:49] again and again and again again no
[1:46:51] that's not what this is he restoreth my
[1:46:53] soul when distress when things have come
[1:46:59] and persecutions or sickness or whatever
[1:47:01] the tester trial whatever form that it
[1:47:04] is but yet here he comes and he restores
[1:47:07] my soul
[1:47:10] ranging all of these parts around me he
[1:47:16] leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
[1:47:18] for his name's sake yea though I walk
[1:47:23] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:47:26] death I will fear no evil for thou art
[1:47:29] with me thy rod and thy staff they
[1:47:32] comfort me I thought this was a funeral
[1:47:40] song it is you and I need to die more to
[1:47:43] ourselves let the shepherd lead us not
[1:47:48] help me to submit to the test and to the
[1:47:51] trials because without submission
[1:47:53] there'll be no resurrection but in order
[1:47:58] for there to be resurrection there's got
[1:47:59] to be submission all under Paul could
[1:48:02] say that through the Fellowship of his
[1:48:04] sufferings then I would be made
[1:48:07] conformable unto his death
[1:48:12] this is his working I said it's his
[1:48:16] working
[1:48:17] it's him bringing it about in our lives
[1:48:21] not forcefully not forcefully he knows
[1:48:25] just like he knows how to correct me or
[1:48:28] correct you in trials trials ain't
[1:48:30] always correction it helps to dissolve
[1:48:33] by the acids all things that are not him
[1:48:40] that the picture of him might come forth
[1:48:44] tests and trials are like dark rooms
[1:48:48] they're like dark rooms where there is a
[1:48:51] picture to come forth but through the
[1:48:54] time it's moving away in that image
[1:48:58] begins to come forth you know brother
[1:49:01] Branham compared that to 1964 the
[1:49:04] translation of the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:49:07] it's the life being developed in us and
[1:49:13] he told us that sticky carnal nature
[1:49:16] will bother you until this new life has
[1:49:21] been fully developed within us but I say
[1:49:28] this morning greater is He that is in me
[1:49:34] he's leading me and you in paths of
[1:49:38] righteousness for his name's sake what a
[1:49:43] path to righteousness where faith is
[1:49:45] required to say I trust you lord
[1:49:48] that's righteousness i trust you lord i
[1:49:51] don't know what salgo i don't know what
[1:49:54] it all has been i trust you you're in
[1:49:57] control Lord as our Shepherd now
[1:50:04] prepares the table before me in the
[1:50:08] presence of mine enemies thou anointest
[1:50:11] my head with oil my cup runneth over
[1:50:18] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:50:24] me all the days of my life and I will
[1:50:29] dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[1:50:33] let me read this in closing Psalms 138
[1:50:38] though the Lord be high yet hath you
[1:50:43] respect unto the lowly but the proud he
[1:50:47] knoweth the far though I walk in the
[1:50:50] midst of trouble
[1:50:51] thou wilt revive me thou shalt stretch
[1:50:56] forth thine hand against the wrath of
[1:50:58] mine enemies
[1:50:59] and thy right hand shall save me
[1:51:02] isaiah 57:15 for thus saith the high and
[1:51:06] lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose
[1:51:09] name is holy i'd dwell in the high and
[1:51:13] holy place and with him also that is of
[1:51:17] a contrite and humble spirit to revive
[1:51:22] the spirit of the humble and to revive
[1:51:27] the heart of the contrite ones aren't
[1:51:32] you glad he knows how only he can do
[1:51:38] that but there every test and every
[1:51:40] trial that you've come through maybe
[1:51:43] there's some right now no doubt all of
[1:51:45] us can look back there's something you
[1:51:47] can say I I don't think I really
[1:51:49] received a benefit that I maybe should
[1:51:51] have received but I think with all of us
[1:51:53] right now we could stand here or sit or
[1:51:56] within our hearts stand and say lord
[1:51:59] help me Lord not just saying help me in
[1:52:04] terms of you know Lord I've you know
[1:52:08] I've failed in this but Lord I know that
[1:52:10] you're able to help me Lord to where I
[1:52:14] can glory in my infirmities it doesn't
[1:52:16] mean you'll be skipping into church now
[1:52:18] it doesn't mean we're that's not who are
[1:52:20] talking about it's to wear that steel
[1:52:23] within your heart there is glory and
[1:52:26] praise to him you might be going through
[1:52:29] the greatest time of your life but your
[1:52:32] face or your body is so broad in line by
[1:52:35] the Spirit of God where people would
[1:52:38] never know that you're going through it
[1:52:42] but yet within there's a meeting with
[1:52:46] you in the Lord don't remember here I
[1:52:50] said I was closing and I am but this is
[1:52:55] why Paul said that he would glory in his
[1:52:57] infirmities
[1:52:59] that the power of Christ may rest upon
[1:53:04] me and that phrase the power of Christ
[1:53:08] is his tent his presence God has Church
[1:53:16] he comes down and has a meeting with us
[1:53:21] in the midst of our infirmities he's
[1:53:25] right there with us he pitches his tent
[1:53:28] now think about it he could pinch his
[1:53:30] tent a lot of places but glory he'll
[1:53:35] pitch his tent his presence his
[1:53:39] presidency won't he don't cut away the
[1:53:42] tribulation they don't cut away the
[1:53:43] trial but it gives us strength it gives
[1:53:47] us grace it gives us comfort I'd say
[1:53:52] this more if you don't know the Lord
[1:53:53] what an opportunity to know one who's a
[1:53:58] friend that'll stick closer than a
[1:54:00] brother that you can know him in that
[1:54:04] way to know him in a personal
[1:54:07] relationship not by a story but he's a
[1:54:11] person he's the author of life and this
[1:54:17] morning you can know him that way
[1:54:18] and even within our lives here this
[1:54:22] morning we can say Lord consecrate me
[1:54:26] I don't want bitterness coming out of my
[1:54:30] life for the tests the trials there
[1:54:33] might be experiences that you've been
[1:54:35] through in your life in the past maybe
[1:54:37] there's still bitterness that's there
[1:54:38] why don't you just allow the Holy Spirit
[1:54:40] to say cleanse me Lord take away that
[1:54:44] bitterness that resentment that Lord I
[1:54:48] want to be a channel that can come
[1:54:51] through brother Samuel can he do that by
[1:54:53] the power of his resurrection he sure
[1:54:55] can
[1:54:55] he's more than able
[1:54:57] if you believe you put that before him
[1:55:00] this morning he's more than able let's
[1:55:03] pray Lord Jesus father the words Lord
[1:55:11] it's Lord God you've laid upon our
[1:55:13] hearts help us or Jesus Lord we love you
[1:55:21] I believed your God that our hearts we
[1:55:27] desire to serve you better Lord or Jesus
[1:55:34] in your presence here this morning
[1:55:39] there's many needs Lord as always when
[1:55:43] we gathered together
[1:55:44] there's needs on the level Lord God of
[1:55:47] being that Lord were a soul that really
[1:55:50] needs to be touched
[1:55:53] Lord God and father they would desire I
[1:55:58] want to know him not just know about him
[1:56:01] I want to know him Lord would you
[1:56:05] minister to that hand that would lift up
[1:56:08] in your presence say I want to know him
[1:56:13] minister to them Lord even deeper as
[1:56:16] they've raised in submission to
[1:56:20] recognize Lord not to me but to
[1:56:23] recognize in honor that your presence is
[1:56:26] dealing with their life I wonder would
[1:56:30] there be one here this morning that
[1:56:32] you'd be willing to be honest before the
[1:56:34] Lord in that maybe your life you haven't
[1:56:36] turned your life over to the Lord but
[1:56:38] you just would want to but I love that
[1:56:41] that hands say pray from me the Lord is
[1:56:43] dealing with my life god bless you
[1:56:48] god bless you
[1:56:52] Heavenly Father
[1:56:56] you see Lord got each and every hand
[1:56:58] Lord
[1:57:00] you see most importantly the hearts
[1:57:02] that's behind it
[1:57:06] Lord God I pray that you administer to
[1:57:08] them your salvation Lord God what God as
[1:57:15] they've willingly raised that hand Lord
[1:57:16] and you would come to stand behind them
[1:57:19] Lord because they're standing on your
[1:57:22] word you always stand with your word
[1:57:29] order here this morning I don't know
[1:57:33] Lord but perhaps through this
[1:57:35] congregation undoubtedly there's hearts
[1:57:39] right now that they're asking their
[1:57:43] desires Lord restore my soul maybe
[1:57:49] through the midst of tests and trials
[1:57:51] where they've come through and Lord not
[1:57:55] just even of something present but even
[1:57:57] from this moment forward Lord from our
[1:58:02] hearts we can recognize the value of
[1:58:06] submission help us the Lord not to try
[1:58:12] even though it's part of the human
[1:58:14] nature Lord God we're we're all we're
[1:58:16] trying to get out of trials trying to
[1:58:18] get out of tests but sometimes we find
[1:58:22] things or God we're here we are we're
[1:58:26] praying we're giving you glory and then
[1:58:30] Lord God in a moment things can come
[1:58:34] around our way and we think my when's
[1:58:36] this gonna end this is when this is so
[1:58:40] long and we get weary
[1:58:44] but then Lord you'll come along it might
[1:58:49] be via text phone call email ran out
[1:58:53] here in the lobby it might be Lord God a
[1:58:56] brother's sister dropping us a card or
[1:58:58] coming by our way it might be Lord God
[1:59:00] of our spouse ministering to us I've
[1:59:05] witnessed it so many times
[1:59:07] Lord it just encourages me and it don't
[1:59:11] take away the test or the trial but it
[1:59:14] removes that weariness that part to
[1:59:16] where I can look to you and say Lord
[1:59:19] that's true you're in control or I pray
[1:59:25] this morning as we we look back over the
[1:59:28] tests and trials and even presently
[1:59:31] right now Lord God our desire is that
[1:59:37] you pitch your tent your tent would be
[1:59:41] pitched upon our lives your presence
[1:59:45] Lord help us Lord God help us may we
[1:59:51] mature more and more and Lord we know
[1:59:56] that maturity isn't that we know more
[1:59:58] maturity is more submission it's greater
[2:00:02] trust greater humility greater
[2:00:06] realization that's not odd that liveth
[2:00:08] but Christ that liveth in me
[2:00:15] anybody want to be remembered in prayer
[2:00:19] that would be your request Lord help me
[2:00:23] Lord help me to submit now men it'd be
[2:00:26] sensitive or Jesus
[2:00:35] behind the hands Lord we lift him up
[2:00:38] before you
[2:00:41] or this is our desire we're asking you
[2:00:45] in order to help us grant to us Lord
[2:00:51] grant to us Lord that we might be more
[2:00:55] submissive Lloyd help us lord I pray or
[2:01:03] God to be able to glory in our
[2:01:06] infirmities Lord to be able to worship
[2:01:09] you to be able to be an encouragement to
[2:01:12] one another Lord the Lord we can receive
[2:01:16] of that comfort Lord Father may your
[2:01:20] cleansing flow if there be any
[2:01:23] bitterness any resentment Lord we pray
[2:01:26] Heavenly Father but by the washing of
[2:01:29] water by the word let it just be cleanse
