grateful to god for his mercy that god is stabilizing his people in the midst of this hour amen aren't you amen oh i'm so grateful to god for his mercy we're receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved amen and we see that we're living in we're living in a time right now you know and we see that all around us i want to say it's so good to see each and every one of you and some are not here perhaps probably still streaming and we just want to greet each and every one of you and just ask that the same lord jesus that is here with us knowing that he will be right there those that are gathered together amen in his name i want to say we want to welcome brother shane and sister lily [Applause] your smile is a little different brother shane got wider brighter and god bless you all we certainly love you and we're so thankful for god's mercy amen well we want to just turn our attention to the things of the lord i want to also say that um here this this week we just got my outlaws or my in-laws moved up here so brother tommy and sister linda are they're here with us i still i probably need to enforce that social distancing even after all this is over with maybe i can still pull that card out once in a while you know we certainly i certainly love them and i really appreciate them and couldn't ask for her for better in-laws and i really appreciate them and appreciate their sacrifice all these years and driving back and forth and um i just know it was the lord that kept kept his hand on him and uh so i really we just so appreciate that and their labor and each and every one we're just glad to be here i want to make an announcement we when we had split uh the groups up um we we did that and just to try to look at everything and see how it would be because everything was was certainly it's been a lot different for all of us um but as i mentioned in the beginning the the focus that we had we were able to handle in the sanctuary um with our our church and that we were still able to handle it even if we had everybody come but just one of those things we just wanted to do um here over these two weeks and just to see where everything was and i really felt like after thursday night we could go ahead and and open it and so we still have i want you to understand we we still with this thursday and everything else it just everything just full resuming full congregation but we still have all of the things that we still have to be mindful of the protocols and things like that if um and we just want i want you to be mindful of that there's still things that we have in place just because we're able to because of the size of our assembly and and the building others would not perhaps be able to do that um and so i know there's some strong language that came out on friday with admonishing you know let's get the churches open and um but um we just looking at these things and uh so i want you just to be mindful of it when we're when we're doing everything and you know we're not i just say it like this i don't want we don't i don't want anybody being a policeman around here and saying you you were within you were at five foot you were in five feet five inches of me you need to be a six foot we that right there we we understand that's those are things we're trying to do everything we can with the social distancing and you know and and we do everything that we can do but we're here for one purpose we're here for one purpose these little things i know it's a little bit some we've got things where we had to look and see can we get everybody and get them spaced and we had to do all that and we can do it but we had to and and and just to say it like this i know some of this right now it would be a little bit uncomfortable some of you are able to maintain or you have your seat it wasn't because you got preference over anybody else it just we're just trying to position things you know the way things are and so um you know just try to to bear and i won't just say just with us but just with one another we're in this together these are these are definitely uh different times for us but we want to just with one another just try to work with one another you may not end up with your seat and your favorite seed and your but i'm sure that it's just we're thankful to be in the house of god and so i believe we can overlook that and and so just we want to just make that that known and lord willing then this coming thursday we'll just as we have here this morning just um open it up and so that that people could could be able to come and we want to look into the word of the lord and and before we do let's just have a word of prayer we we just want to invite him amen into this service this morning i believe his presence he's already here with us heavenly father lord we are are so thankful lord for this opportunity that you've given us lord our hearts lord are our just lord so so thrilled to be able lord to come back together lord once again lord these are are different times for us lord we never could have imagined some of these things like this but lord you're still the same god and so lord we just lord our eyes we look to you this morning and we just ask that god that your your presence would just move among us lord those that are streaming even in home god i pray that lord is one unit together may your lord holy spirit just come and just take the word and just speak to our hearts lord i i just give myself to you lord that you might come and have full liberty here as a congregation lord i give this congregation to you lord that god you might just move lord in every life and every heart oh god may our faith lord may faith just be moved lord raising in you we pray lord we love you and we thank you now we commit this service lord and all that you will do we want to go ahead and give you thanks father we ask that lord you would have your way now in the name of jesus christ amen amen i want to just if we could open up our bibles to second kings chapter 6 i we led off there last week and i just want to begin there this morning and we'll see where the lord will take us in this and i want to continue that thought we were looking at last sunday stability in the midst of instability second kings chapter six verse eight the bible says then the king of syria ward against israel and took counsel with his servants saying in such a such a place shall be my camp and the man of god sent unto the king of israel saying beware that thou pass not such a place for thither the syrians are come down i want you to think of this here very small little details but i want you to think of it the man of god here he was in israel but the same god he was right there hearing everything that the king of syria was doing and he revealed it to the man of god and look what god did the man of god spoke and said beware beware get yourself in position here and they got themselves in position look what the scripture says in verse 10 and the king of israel sent to the place which the man of god told him and warned him of and saved himself there not once nor twice therefore the heart of the king of syria was sore troubled for this thing and he called his servants and said unto them will you not show me which of us is for the king of israel he thought he had he thought he had a watchdog or a leaker on the inside he wanted to who who's who's leaking this you know how they always put it out there this one spoke on you know on you know unidentified source you know in public if i get the word right anonymity or whatever how they pronounce it i mean it's like somebody they want to just leak something and here look what he look what he just look what he says he's asking who who show me which one of us is for the king of israel and one of his servants said none my lord o king but elisha the prophet that is in israel telleth the king of israel the words that thou speakest in thy bed chamber not not just around your war table but what's going on in your bed chamber he speaks these words out you know what he was saying there's no way no place that you can go to that would be so secret and so private that god don't know aren't you glad that we're under his protection amen god bless you as you're being seated this morning oh my so when we look at this here in the scripture uh we certainly i believe we certainly can agree we are and not just something that we've come to of unstable times or instability but it really begins to show itself and i want you to think of this here we've looked at we've heard the message of what god has sent us and we understand that that message was to bring us to a living reality that god is still the same god he's present that message has also posted us the prophetic message has posted you and i to what is taking place what is going on i'll tell you this right here when you as you listen to the message i've never ceased this brother joy over the years it's as though you would think brother branham had just preached that morning by looking at the conditions you're seeing you know why because it's a prophetic eye the scripture said it's the eye of god and the eye of god is christ this is god lifts up that seer to be able to look through that eye of christ that it would post you and i of the things that are taking place the things that we see all around us we that is not anything where we would be where trouble would not come around we see through the scripture it has been promised our prophesied that trouble would be all around wars and rumors of war all of these things that we see instability when a prophet would speak those things i often wondered and when he stood there and he would speak in this world is falling apart again i wondered how many of them would look at him and think what is he talking about because he would identify the things that was taking place and yet what it was is that he's identifying the seeds that were there at that time many could look and think my goodness you know we've got a strong nation we've got this but yet it was identifying the seeds because remember when israel themselves got away from god and remember when they got away from god then it just everything else let loose israel was not a strong nation because of all of everything that they could do in their goodness but their strength came from the lord that was the secret of their strength as a matter of fact his presence is called the strength of israel and to think the same way here with america it's the same way it's been through all of the gentile powers it was not those powers that were strong in themselves they had boundaries prophetically that were set they couldn't go past those boundaries and all of that god had it laid out in time of all of those four kingdoms coming down and we see where you and i are at in this time think of the fourth kingdom now of where is upon this earth and that is that of rome and we see the mixture of clay and iron they will not mix together it speaks of a fragile condition it speaks of instability it's all come all the way on down and we see it right now remember even in the time where the when the prophet was standing here the spirit of god would begin to identify because look within man man craves security man craves peace he craves what we would say good news man craves safety and to think of it with even that when these things would be developed you know united nations and and this organization and this organization and we find all of that was supposed to to actually purport peace and and try to give you know rest but we realize there's none of those things that's given rest as a matter of fact there's all it's never even settled nor calmed the troubling why it is of man they're saying that'll actually bring peace upon this earth and that is when christ himself comes back and we enter into a millennium reign that's the only time there's ever going to be peace upon this earth until that time peace itself is what reigns in the heart of the believer it's not based on the peace of where things are at in the stock market or where is this one at or where is this one at and you know it's our peace is not rest within that our peace comes from the lord the lord jesus told us in john 16 33 he said be of good cheer for i've overcome the world he said in the world you will have tribulation but in me you will have peace so here within israel they are faced with a very a situation where syria is trying to come at them and trying to to you know to surprise them and i want you to catch this here the secret of their victory was they had a prophet in the land of that israel the secret of their victory to whom god would reveal himself god literally uncovered the tactics of the enemy let me just tell you this right now those things if israel did us on that and see the word of the lord coming to pass and the enemy being exposed every time you know if they took it to where it was just like a hog underneath the tree and the apples are dropping and they just scarf up the hall or the apples instead of looking up and saying who's supplying these apples you see israel had to recognize it's the god he is watching over israel god has placed a man here that he will speak through and though the enemy thinks he's got a surprise attack the enemy thinks he's got an advantage but he doesn't have an advantage over god the enemy he can have an advantage over this flesh but he does not have an advantage over the living god oh my and if we are on the side of the lord then brother the scripture said if god be for us who can be against us this is a promise that belongs to us brother these are not just words these are times to draw upon the promises of god oh my it would reveal to the king of israel so that he could get in the right position it did no good as we see here in the scripture as much as what could be spoken if the king of israel didn't believe it and act on it it did no good the word of god will never do anybody any good by just them hearing it you've got to act upon the word that requires faith now to think how the king of israel would move within this time and it would actually where the syrians were trying to make a surprise attack he would catch them and it would be the syrians that would be surprised let me just say it to you like this there's nothing that takes god by surprise now let's be honest there's many things that take us by surprise oh yeah if we're truly honest oftentimes troubles arise and the direction from which it arises can take us by surprise but not god i said but not god this is the reason that we must have a true connection with the living god to know that he is god and that he is ever present now i want you to look at a few scriptures here in psalms 46 verse 1. god is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof salah there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of god the holy place of the tabernacles of the most high god is in her midst she shall not be moved god shall help her and that right on right early the scripture goes on right here the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge now the scripture here as it goes on in second king six and he said here is where the king of syria said go and spy where he is i want to know where this prophet's at then i may send and fetch him and he was told him saying behold he is in dothan now i want you to think of this we we just seen this in the scripture which you're no doubt familiar with god had revealed move that the syrian army had been making before they could ever get there it was already revealed and the people were prepared and in position to meet the enemy's advance what put the people in position there was a prophet of god in israel there was a contact and the people of god were under that word brother amen that same god now think about this now that same god look at how that this opens in this time the same god was with him that had revealed every move made by the king of syria but this time it was different this was going to be a surprise but you see god was going to actually display his presence now i won't ask you but how many of you me included have been in times and situations that things took us by surprise we absolutely took it by take it by surprise now if we're honest if we're not trying to you know say oh i knew that was coming you know i had this little thought i had if we'll just be honest and say you know what this just blindsided me it caught me by surprise but you see in the midst of that time as a believer our faith is not anchored in us having control of everything but our faith is anchored in the one who has control of us and he has control of every situation that is around us now notice therefore sent heed the king of syria horses and chariots and a great host and they came by night and compassed the city about now as i mentioned last week a great host he didn't just send one man hey you're only coming after one man you could maybe send one man or two men but it shows you the threat the enemy perceived this threat he wasn't sending the whole host out after you know a part of the army he sent the whole host he gathered everything let me just say it to you like this he put all of his military budget into a place to where he would be able to remove the prophet of god from in the midst of israel and that's what satan has been trying to do that is exactly what satan would love nothing more to do than to try to kill the influence that god has brought through and by the prophet messenger in this hour brother this is why it must be a personal revelation that these are not the thoughts of man it's not man's ideas amen this is a promise of god that has been spoken in this hour to an ordained people who would have ears to hear [Applause] as soon as you get them away from the prophet you got them as soon as you get into reasoning got them come on friends you see the king of syria he seen this was such a threat that's where the devil sees a threat he gets them away from this message they have no eyes come on this is the holy ghost the isab that is sent in this hour they become blind to the promises of god they become blind to the image of god they cannot see jesus christ for who he really is and they never can ever see themselves he wanted to destroy the confidence but notice our strength it's not in numbers our abilities our swords our knowledge our understanding our strength is in the lord i'm telling you in times and situations and this is just this is just a minor thing that we've been going through i'm not making a lot of it but i'm telling you it's a minor thing it's a time in this hour to be sure enough where is our anchor at we can talk about faith when everything's good but what is it when situations are taking place that requires faith amen may god help us amen he is the strength of our life these scriptures mean so much that man shall not live by bread alone shall we have to work shall we have to eat naturally but that's not man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god that's where a man he finds his resource his strength is from the word of the lord brother that's a real strength that's a real courage it comes from him oh my israel had victory they had victory because they had a prophet of the lord in their land and they believed him and do no good to have him if you don't believe him they believed he was god's spokesman and it put them in position now think of this the bible goes on and when the servant of the man of god was risen early and gone forth behold a host compassed the city both with horses and chariots and his servant said unto him alas my master how shall we do he answered fear not that's the greatest answer that we can receive and that'll always be the answer that comes from the lord is fear not because he can't say anything to us if we're fearful but one word from him fear not he could have never spoke to mary of the promise that was for her if he first she was troubled in her mind and he said fear not he's got to get her settled down it wasn't mary wasn't a believer but he had to get her settled down oh my notice fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them and elisha prayed and said lord i pray thee open his eyes that he might see elisha was the prophet of god but he could not open gahesa's eyes but he didn't know the one that opened his eyes elisha did know the one that opened his eyes and he knew that god was no respecter person he knew what he was doing mind his own business plowing there in his family's fields but the spirit of god came by through that of the prophet elijah and the mantle was placed upon him and moved over and elisha began to follow in the footsteps of elijah he would pour water upon his hands he knew what he was for that to take a hold of his life to where everything else it became secondary brother he cut up the plow he chopped up the hold out everything because of a hole that had come upon his life he had not even received that of the power of the spirit yet but it had moved upon his life and he knew that was for me oh glory to god if anyone here this morning that has not been born of the spirit of god when you sense him dealing with your life remember god is not playing games that is the map that he would move around your life open his eyes oh my hallelujah that's my prayer and the lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots round about elisha now you think about this in the beginning i mean because it would have been all natural for hazel what he's sitting there looking at you're not going to tell him he ain't seeing what he's seeing hearing what he's hearing you're going to tell him he's seeing it he's hearing it but you see how god made a man in the beginning god did not make flesh man first that was the house that the man created in his own image in his own likeness and we must keep in mind that this house was created not to make contact with god this house itself was not made to contact god but that man that god made first in his image in his likeness after his kind remember it was to that man that he gave jurisdiction he gave authority over the animal life all of that all the rest was under that jurisdiction that leadership that headship so here we find that when satan as he studied it the thing that satan did is he came to eve now he has to move her from relying upon the supernatural he's got to move her away from relying upon what god has actually made her so he has to be able to pull her into a place to where she will actually be moved by her senses her feelings her mind her reasoning he's got to pull her into that realm if he can move her into that realm to where she lives by reasoning she walks by her feelings and her senses he's got her whipped right there and let's just be honest anytime the enemy can work and pull us into our reasoning our imagination our conscience or any of those things now remember god gave us those gates but we got to rule over them god has never given the five senses neither did he give the five spiritual senses for man to be led by but god supplied faith that would be the supersense or the sixth sense whereby man would actually be brought into contact with god into that of the unseen realm so how that satan would work on that and he still tries to do the same thing here yet within our lives this is why that we cannot walk by our intellect we can't walk by our intellect this is why that there is must come that of the new birth where we receive a renewing of our mind being renewed in the spirit of our mind that our spiritual eyes would actually become open you realize that a person can actually see 20 20 with their natural eyes and yet they'll be blind they can't even see what's in front of them think of this later on in this passage right here elisha walks out and he comes to the syrian army and he says who are you looking for they said we're looking for that prophet of god and elijah said come with me i'll show you exactly where he's at he was standing right in front of them brother they could have had his breath and everything else all over him but they didn't see him they were blind to it but all of a sudden when they came there in the host in the midst of israel then god opened their eyes god opened them that they could see that the very one that they were looking for think of it one man was leading a whole host one man the same man that they were after oh glory to god you talk about a man with confidence that can know that those swords and chariots and they were all around him they were sworn to get him but he had such confidence in the lord god oh brother he was stabilized in the midst of unstable times he was stable because we do not see the kingdom of god with these eyes it comes without observation it comes without that it's our heart it's having our heart the eyes of our heart anointed here's what jesus would say in john 14 18 i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you we're not like orphans when the holy ghost has come we're not like orphans now i've got a little bit of a dry cough but don't nobody get nervous i got my nice cough drop here i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you see me so the world will not see him but you see him because i live you shall live also and at that day you shall know that i am in my father and ye and me and i in you oh that's what's really important is that we would see him second corinthians 4 17 for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not don't let these just be words while we look not at the things which are seen you know what that means we're not focusing on what we see abraham every day he woke up he saw the frailty of his humanity i don't know if when he got up he had to do stretches for his lower back or not but every day maybe he started out with a crook oh my sir that tempur-pedic just ain't what it used to be oh it said i'll tell you well praise god we're going to have that baby abraham when you're going to straighten out well after i get morning coffee i might be able to straighten out and walk straight but you see he never focused this was right here this was not something he had to log into this was not a website this was not a news update it was all around him but he chose not to focus on it hallelujah in the words of the prophet he focused out unbelief focused out so if you focus that out it shows you must be focusing on something else [Applause] he chose to focus on the promise of god but at the things which are not seen that's what we look at that's a that's a paradox in it how can you focus and look on something you can't see but i can see it even though it's invisible i can see it for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal brother brown was in a meeting in canada and remember there was a tv salesman out there he found out he didn't know brother brown's name but he found out that he was with that branham outfit and he began to question you know in a manner of what do you think about this and what do you think about that and so the man spoke to brother branham and he said it like this when brother branham was asking him what did you think about what happened with that boy that got up out of the out of the wheelchair what did you think about that with that man and here's what the guy said ah that's nothing but psychology that's no i can't believe none of that what was it he was standing face to face but he couldn't see it face to face with a vessel that god had used just the night before so the man makes a statement and he says anything that cannot be scientifically proven then i think there's nothing to it you see this is the age we're living in the god listen to me now these got to be more than just quotes the god of this evil age is scientific knowledge and the prophet would say like this satan has been exalted to the throne of worship in man knowledge understanding has become the god that's bowed to but i believe i'm looking at some hebrew children whether you're here or you're in the unseen audience i believe i've got so there's someone there's some hebrew children that says i ain't buying bound to the god of science i'm not bound to bowing to scientific knowledge because this i cannot be stable upon those things i know i'm talking to i know there's so many that i said right here maybe we ought to just open up a medical school here because there's many of right here in this congregation from from a doctor back there to nurses that take care of things right here but you understand even with having all that understanding when you go to approach anything you're asking the lord to open your understanding brother scott when you go to perform a surgery an operation or to look at a patient those of you the rest of you out there in the nursing homes in different places you're asking god for understanding at least i hope you are i hope you're not trusting in your abilities because if you aren't make sure you tell me where you're working so i make sure i don't we don't send nobody there we want to trust in the lord i don't care how many abilities you think you've got we are trusting in the lord we're not trusting in our knowledge lean not to thine own understanding trust in the lord at all times wow and brother branham you know kind of makes a little bit of a southern expression he said you know mom he said that's my you know grand grandma always said you give a cow enough rope and it'll hang itself and this is an awful big statement oh my i don't know over the weeks i just listened to this and again and again he said now look he said i don't want to be different with you but the things that can be scientifically proven is not real it's only the things that's not scientifically proven it's real so now we're separating between that of the tangible earth and then that of the supernatural i'm god and i change not but the world passes away is that right things temporal things that maybe you labored for and maybe you planted a you planted a beautiful plant you know out out in your yard and then now you know you're just going to hope you fertilized it right and you've got everything set up around it you're hoping that you've got the green thumb that something's happened about it that it actually makes it and survives and it might do good this year maybe they're going to do good next year at the lord terry's and then finally the next year something else comes along maybe a bug a parasite or some little mite gets upon it and it actually begins to take away from it and you think man what's going on you have invested in that but yet look at it it comes to a place that it wilts it dies but that's not so with god neither is it with your christian walk with god these things that we see these are temporal and they're perishable i mean look even even the ideas of man i mean what they used to put in the medical books if somebody got an infection drain them they didn't mourn drain many of them they killed them i don't have to ask brother scott i know better they don't they do not they do not still have that kind of stuff in medical books it might be part of history but they've learned from it but god is infinite god is infinite this is our resting place now think about this these are things brother brown would say we put so much emphasis and so much concern about the natural things and so little about this oh my now here's the scripture let me just look at a few scriptures for we walk by faith and not by sight our lives walk means to be regulated or occupied by faith you can't see faith you can't see love come on now you can't see personality all you see is manifestations of that come on these are the things life love personality the prophet pauline said these are things that are real but you can't go down to the store and buy them we walk by faith and not by sight many times listen to me give you an example the doctor can say they can look and say well you've got cancer there's no recovery for you brother branham picked it up to the holy spirit he said we can look and it says on the x-ray cancer they're right you got cancer but he said when god speaks and when god says but by my stripes you are healed he said then we forsake the flesh and walk after the this is where as a believer we have to walk in that place of discerning now let me just say like this i'm not going to come up here i think it's a traffic light up here i'm not going to come up to this traffic light and it's red and say you know what you think i ought to turn left here right now duh it's a red light are you with me now when it turns green it might be that all that the voice of god would say hold on a moment even though my eyes say go but god could give a warning because there might be somebody who's not paying attention god could give a warning in that way you understand what i'm saying so it just doesn't mean oh this is a red light i'm going to obey this as soon as the green light we're pulling out of it no it still comes to a place as a believer we are walking under his influence hebrews 11 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him by faith look at this noah being warned of god of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith we look not at the things that are seen but the things that are unseen noah builds a boat under inspiration from god a lot of other boats in that time but there was only one god constructed the other part of it is he didn't build it in a harbor that had the shipbuilders scratching their heads too they thought oh this man he's a prophet he's building it out here on dry land what he didn't understand it was not noah's job to get the boat to the water the water would come to the boat hallelujah amen our our commission is to stand on this word and god will see us through noah received a word from god you couldn't have looked it up in the dictionary webster did not even have rain in the dictionary it never rained then the earth was watered from the fountains of the deep so imagine rain what's this thing rain you're talking about he didn't just talk about it he preached about it inspiration came noah no doubt got up at times on his phone let's just bring it here as it was in the days of noah he got up and there were notifications going off proven no rain in the skies what does he do does he walk by the headline or does he walk by the revelation in his heart he's got a choice to make god is not going to make that choice for him he's got a choice so noah probably says clear the other day the next day he gets up and here comes this maybe this outlet he's subscribed to maybe they've always had balanced reporting and here they come with a headline and they come across they come across this time and here they come again it is proven by this scientist right here that there is no water up there so-called prophet says there is water up there in the sky and though it's gonna rain and this whole earth is going to be flooded i want you to understand they had there was a that was such a scientific civilization so much so the spirit of god would identify this time that we're living in as that time you understand there's nothing wrong with science but when science becomes first and god is second there's a problem science should never be ahead of god because if there wasn't no god there wouldn't be no science [Laughter] hallelujah now to think of this everything that came around i imagine noah probably said you know what i'm going to change the notifications on my phone brother aaron probably what he did is said i'm no longer going to be subscribed to this you know i think i'm going to do i am going to bring up the revelation that god gave to me when i wake up in the morning i'm going to have that come across as a notification thou art righteous thou art loved thou art beloved noah hallelujah i have seen the righteous he began to focus on those things and the rest of the world could look and know and say you're crazy you know why because there's nothing he could do to prove they could ask him give me a drop of this ring you're talking about i can't but pretty soon if there's going to be more than one drop for you he wasn't saying it arrogantly but he realized you see what it was to the rest of the world and they looked at it and said what is he talking about but look what it did for noah it stabilized him in the midst of that time where judgment was impending upon the world but yet noah was in contact with that which was more real than everything he could see around him he was in contact with the unseen realm brother that revelation it so grounded him [Applause] oh god remember remember who he was dealing with was not just people that was just out here and you know sons of ham no these were sons of seth that were coming up around him as well sons of seth now notice this these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on earth what did that they came in contact with the unseen realm hebrews 11 27 by faith he forsook egypt talking about moses not fearing the wrath of the king now think of it he not only fled away from him but then when god god takes a hold of moses he tells him now go back no doubt his head was on the one on the wanted posters he had fled as a coward but god turns around and says now i want you to go back but he's going back for a purpose that the lead of people out he endured these are big words he endured as seeing him who is invisible you know what that says there was a lot of things he faced that he had to come through not before he met god but after he met god he had to endure a lot of things and the way that he faced them was because he had a connection with the invisible god it stabilized moses when pharaoh said i ain't letting them go every time remember how the word would come and pharaoh with it all of a sudden you know he would get under a religious anointing oh please moses pray take this away we'll we'll serve you we'll let them go we'll do this and about that time soon as god would lift it then what would happen pharaoh would move right back into being pharaoh that spirit was still there and here he would come right again it what was it it was opposition against the word of god it was not flesh the flesh of moses against the flesh of pharaoh these were two spiritual powers that were at force and at hand not flesh and blood but there was an anchor look how brother braham says this here in the message looking at the unseen when a man once catches that vision of the invisible god and knows that he's always present there is something that stabilizes that man's thinking aren't you glad it don't do away with our thinking but it stabilizes it our thinking could want to go this way but there's a stabilizer there's something that stabilizes that man's thinking it stabilizes his actions and in the time of distress and trouble it'll still make him look upward and above the things that are happening around him because he's looking at the unseen yet by promise stabilize it will make him look up he can look all around he can see things feel things things thoughts can come in his mind but the stabilizer oh my thank god for the stabilizer think about it when the prophet was standing there and remember how satan came up with his little baby his little girl god was going to take home his little sharon rose remember when the enemy came up to him and said look what you've done you went and prayed for the sick you went when you've been tired he laid out everything and remember and brother branham said i was about ready to say if that's the way it's going to be he said but at that time that thai post that new birth spoke out at the time oh glory be to god i'm thankful for the new birth i'm thankful for the seal that is the stabilizer if not for the stabilizer we would be bobbing all over the waves thank god for the stabilizer now you know like i talked to you last last week preached to you about the stabilizer's been put on the ship remember with those stabilizers they've got them that are fixed and then they've got those that they're actually automatically controlled you don't even know what's going on they've got those that work with like a bilge pump and things like that that actually can take that actually take care of so that when that ship is there upon the ocean that ship is not rolling from side to side that would be very uncomfortable first of all be very uncomfortable be on a cruise ship myself i think but anyhow it'd be very uncomfortable if you're sitting there and you've got maybe a lobster you're getting ready to cut into and all of a sudden you're up like this and your lobster's down here and then all of a sudden you're trying to eat right here it'd be very hard listen to me it'd be very hard to try to focus on the things of god if our life was not stable how could we focus on those things we would be looking for other things we would be saying hey man when in the world they're going to get this ship stable hey when's this going to happen and the captain radio radio's down and says let me tell you i got the greatest gown board this guy is working on it right now and this is what he said he said to replace this pump with this pump and this and that and then we'll have it up ready in a little bit and all of a sudden then we're sitting there we're rocking back and forth back and forth all of a sudden now the captain comes over and says uh check check check this guy right here says this has exceeded his knowledge and understanding he actually says we don't need to replace the pump we actually got to go over here and we got to take care of something in the hall and then after suddenly we're like oh my glad they have some experts here and the ship is still going back and forth back and forth and all of a sudden the captain gets on and says hey wait a minute here uh you know what we've just learned a little bit more here there's something else that's up front it's not a pump it's not something here it's this on up here about that time you would be looking at and saying wait a minute there seems to be no hope in this ship being stabilized that's why you want to get out of the ship a man and get in the ship of god manship is all based on his knowledge and understanding and we'll do this and we've got this expert and this will happen and this happened oh no that that's not going to work now we take that back we need to correct this but being in the ship of god it'll stabilize this is why the prophet if you don't mind me reading it to you look what he has said this is identified to us the stabilizers has been put on the ship well i'm glad for that aren't you i i wouldn't want to be here in this ship without stabilizers i've been out there fishing with brother dave junior and brother brother dave they've taken me out there fishing and i'm one of the first times here a few years ago it's been a while since i've been out there on the lake and they say hey you might need you know you think you might need to take one of these pills i don't know what they're called but one of them pills you know make you sleepy and everything else and you know so you don't get motion sickness i said you know i've been up i only got to sleep a couple hours let me just take one so i kind of sat in the back of the boat that day and it was already some waves i i mean that was going on you know and by the time i sat in the back of the boat we had we had a good time but i just sit there and you know just saw my you know i was about halfway out of it the second day it went out the very next day they said hey you want to take on them again i said no i don't want to take one i said i really i've never had to take one of those things before so i'm going to try to get out here and not take one now you know what it was if i would have taken one of those things it was to try to settle the sickness i hope you're listening to me it was to try to take take something and try to settle so that i could be calm that was out there but don't want to think about it friends even in this spiritual hour that we're in we don't want no something to calm us down we don't want to take something to calm us down we want to be settled in jesus christ you understand i'm not against medicine i hope you understand what i was saying on that but notice there's great fearful waves that are out here before us but we know just beyond that wave yonder we're nearing the shore look where the focus is taken from from the fearful waves to the shore just beyond that we're nearing the shore we're nearing the storm just stay stable just stay in the word stay with god no matter how you feel what anything else stay right with the word when you see all these great big old clouds around us and storms coming and atomic bombs and everything else they're talking about but our stabilizer is right straight in the world god said it would be here and we'll crest every one of them i'm reading from the prophet that is in the land of the bride amen oh we'll go right over the top of them yes indeed they can't sink us they can't drown us you can put us in the grave will come out again what's he talking he's talking about something that's deeper than our flesh because the enemy can come if he gets permission to attack our flesh but there's one thing he can't tamper with and that's the seal and he can't take our life until god permits him to do so and when god has permitted that remember death becomes our servant to pull us into the presence of god you put us in the grave we'll come out again that's all there is to it there ain't no way in the world to keep it down there we'll crest every one of them because our great chief captain is calling at the other side i want to focus on his voice don't you here stands gaza he's actually standing in a pretty good place he's walking with the prophet of god he's his servant but the difference is it wasn't just good enough to be close to the prophet of god because that didn't stabilize him but iran was in the right place to be stabilized you see what it was that caused gahey's trouble his fear was what he was looking at what he was looking at was causing his fear just as much as the peace that elisha had was coming from what he knew was there see it depends on what you're looking at hallelujah dehazel was looking at what was saint now you weren't going to talk him out of it but joe you would never you've never been a reason him out of it now he's not now you realize here there is you realize the scripture says that the angel of the lord encampeth around them the fear you had it was going to take more than just words because the prophet tells us gaza knew that scripture too but he said geheza only knew it as a church member he did not know it in the way that elisha knew it elisha knew it now remember elisha didn't see those angels he didn't see him but his confidence was in the god who he knew and had made the promise here's a surprise my goodness it'd be like waking up on monday morning and something happens and you think man we just had a wonderful time in the house of god my we just had a wonderful sunday and then all of a sudden these things begin to take place over the week and you think my goodness where in the world is all this coming from it's a surprise but it didn't take god by surprise i tell you the way that all these events have transpired it's taken us by surprise there's not one that had all this figured out i know there's a lot of guys that out there you'll see their posts on youtube and i predicted this and i predicted this and i you know always when somebody looks back on something it's always 20 20. but nobody predicted this nobody had saw that these different things were coming about within this manner and in this way but we do know it isn't that we need to know the details we know that trouble sometimes we are in we are living in these times in these hours now think about it dehaze his instability was because what he was looking at let me just tell it to you right now whatever you look at will either bring stability or instability what you focus on will bring anxiety or peace what you focus on will either bring faith or to bring doubt what you focus on will cause an atmosphere to be created you either have courage or you'll have worry and worry is not part of the kingdom of god but you see god didn't bring those angels down they were there already he just had to change the seeing of his servant when he could change the seeing of his servant and hazel's eyes would come open elisha was no more stabilized be after than he was before but gaza became stabilized afterwards i don't know about you but there's been many situations that we can come in contact with and we don't know exactly lord what do we do god doesn't tell us everything look at this example right here god would tell them here comes the syrian army here comes the syrian army here comes the syrian army and then this comes about what are they going to do what if elisha listen to me what if elisha would have said oh my goodness i wonder if i've done something i wonder if something's wrong in my life i wonder if something's out of step because god didn't tell me and here they come around me like this no his confidence was not because god had told him this point this point this point you see faith is being built in the living god that he's the ever present god not that i have to know what's going on know what he's doing or know that i don't have to know that he's an ever-present help in the time of trouble glory be to god look at this the angels of the lord encamp to wrap thou around about them that fear him and deliver them that's for you and me when the great has come which always does then gahesa being just a lukewarm church member he had not seen what elijah had seen and elijah was used to walking by faith and he was looking at the unseen all the time what a testimony how many say lord help that to be my testimony i want to look at the unseen all the time amen and he knew that god had said in the psalms the angels of god are encamped about those who fear him that was enough for elijah oh glory think of this i want you just to think of this and consider this the bible speaks that where we are dwelling in the body of jesus christ in the book of hebrews chapter 12 that there is an innumerable company of angels that in numeral means cannot be counted let me just tell you they're not just here in this building there's not open spaces hope you don't bother you these angels aren't wearing masks these angels aren't social distancing they're filling every place in this room they're not just here they don't just they're not just right here when we're here the angels of god are encamped about your life when you walk into walmart target or wherever you go you're not alone first of all he said i'll never leave you nor forsake you but the other part about it is is that you've got a host the host of angels is all around oh may god help us to be more connected with that unseen realm to walk under that influence of the unseen rail because what these eyes can see what these ears can hear brother if we allow that to be the focus it brings instability think of how the scripture would say in psalms 91 9 because thou hast made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways remember there were those plagues in time of egypt that god after about the third one came along that's when god started saying i'm going to make a difference this plague would come next one i'm going to make a difference that my plague would come i'm going to make a difference god made the difference for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot against a stone accompanied about with the angels of god what a stability i don't know about you when i read back over this this is something i'm aware of it's something we are aware of you realize brother branham i think brother brown was asked questions like in the he would he would tell us a question that he was put before him in the message be certain of god and somebody asked him brother branham aren't you afraid to go to the platform at night aren't you afraid that maybe that the angel of the lord won't be there and you're facing them demons and that diseases he said no i'm not afraid at all he said because my confidence is he promised he promised he would be there hallelujah there was a confidence it wasn't that he always seen him there the confidence was the word he knew that he was present think about how brother branham when he talked about going down to the down to the platform there in the houston coliseum when he walked down there remember what he said he said the angels lined the aisles brother walked right down to the state sister meaty brother ram talks about hundreds of ushers were there sister meaty when they have her you know talking to her on the testimony she said there wasn't that many ushers there she said what it was he was looking into an unseen realm the angels of god were right there as he walked down to the platform brother that was not just for the prophet of god elijah said there are more with us then there are against us [Applause] hallelujah we're not alone even if you should dash your foot against the stone even if you should stumble oh my to think the angels of god are there to bear you up to encourage you you're on this ladder brother brother braham said you are stuck between god and christ [Laughter] we're on this ladder and angels are there all day like the song said all day all night angels watching over me my lord glory be to god does that mean that well you know elisha was not walking around you know and just you know arrogantly that's not what elisha was doing that's not what it does for us as believers it stabilizes us it stabilizes us may god help us let's just we'll just settle down here there's more i would whole lot more i want to preach on but there when we look at these things and what we see around us it depends on what we look at is what will dominate us now you might look at things and say this is true it's a law it's really hard to find a lot of truth out there are you with me it's really hard but those 10 spies that went over there and they surveyed the land when they talked about them giants that wasn't a headline it was to them are you with me they looked at that and what they saw that wasn't imagination that wasn't something that all of a sudden somebody came back the next day and said you know what they really weren't about eight and nine foot or they were almost more or less about like five eight i think we just were kind of looking at it the wrong way no what what they were they were giants what they were looking at was real but caleb and joshua was looking at the unseen and i want you to watch kangalup and joshua looking at the unseen it stabilized him the others they looked at what they could see and it brought fear i tell you friends there's enough things all around here that for you if you focus on it it can bring fear it can bring instability it can bring anxiety it can bring a lot and listen i'm not just talking about what has been taking place i'm talking about all across the board i often wonder after this thing right here will things ever settle back in among people right will you ever be able to cough in a store again will you ever be able to sneeze will you ever be able to you know get closer yeah i really i wonder that because think of what's happened so much right now the person coughs a person's needs a person there's a person and you might as well be honest with enough if you you dwell on it enough your flesh can get to looking at that oh my goodness but this is where we want to be in contact with the unseen realm when we walk out our door when we go to the different places we want to be under that influence lord help me lord watch over me lord protect me hey listen as many times as i can drive a certain place on the roadway i don't just take it for granted the lord help me maybe i'm coming over here to the church lord will you watch over me today even when i'm getting ready to go into my job and no matter how many times i had taught division or fractions i asked god lord help me today help the children lord that they would be able to have understanding help me to be able to relay the concept help me to be sensitive to this lord it's not just taking things for granted but it's asking for his leadership to live under the influence of the unseen realm let me just say this to you if you've not ever come in contact with that to where your life has been completely overtaken by the unseen realm where you've completely surrendered your life god will not come down and do it for you you've got to surrender but once you surrender to him and you let him become the lord of your life you're in contact with an unseen realm it stabilizes you it doesn't matter what friends will say then it doesn't matter what family says it doesn't matter what anybody else would say you're stable it stabilizes you this is stability in the midst of instability let's just stop here oh
