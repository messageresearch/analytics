morning Lord as you always were that Lord we stand as Believers to not only as believing it and confessing that Lord I pray that God that you'll move in just a very special way Among Us we give ourselves to you For Your Glory in Jesus name amen and amen amen if you return with me to Ephesians 3 I want to certainly just be as I said just greet all the mothers here God bless our sisters and I want to remind you here we have brother Daniel of foray from Ghana he's no stranger to us he's a good friend and he'll be with us here this coming Thursday and then Sunday and then even in the preparation for the meetings there in Memorial Day and I'm certainly looking forward to what God has in store and um you know with everything that goes into it you know in everything we do for the kingdom of God there's always an investment and every time when even we have meetings and so forth there's a great investment that goes into that to be able to to have that and you know when we as we have the meetings I just say it in this way I don't have them just for me but we have them for a body and it's it's a blessing God in times the reason we would have even those moments of special meetings those are moments and times and I ask you and just request that just to be in prayer for those services that God come by our way and do something special for us Lord God's just that kind of a God I know I know friends I'm not putting God into a bottle of special meetings and the only way you know God is by special meetings no special meetings are special times there's special moments there's things that God will do very specially for us and you know there's expectation and I would say my what God is able to do when we have an expectation and I tell you whatever the need might be there's requests upon your heart and I'd say God just just grant a real outpouring of the holy spirit amen where lives are touched and hearts are filled and immense sicknesses is just just removed from the body that's the kind of God we serve and we are so thankful that we have these Privileges and opportunities and to be a part of that and um I certainly am going to ask for your gracious because even when we get into the month of June and the first part of July even for myself it's going to be even busier with some different meetings and things and I'll speak of that as it comes on for myself and but I certainly covet your prayers and and it's just good to be here today and it's good to be in the house of the Lord and Ephesians chapter 3 and verse 8. unto me Who Am less than the least of All Saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hidden God who created All Things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God Brothers just turn me down just a hair in my monitors please I want you to notice the purpose of this in verse 10 to the intent the purpose that now unto the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God God's a god of variety he's got a great he's got a great variety just like the variety of trees and variety of grasses on and on God's got a great variety in verse 11. according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him amen I I want to read here a quote before I let you be seated if that'd be all right very short but out of the message Paradox and brother Branham will speak of this in a few different places in the message actually in fundamental Foundation of Faith he takes the whole message on it and he says here towards the end somehow or another the Holy Spirit has made its way down into their hearts and as they're telling them you are not here just to eat and drink and to sleep and to get up and work and then to go back eat and drink and sleep again you're here to be Sons and Daughters of God he's not saying we don't sleep we don't eat we don't work but that's not the first purpose that we're here for we're here to be Sons and Daughters of God in each of those things you are here to take your position and place in Christ so I'd like to just speak here if the Lord would help us this morning on living out God's purpose living out God's purpose God bless you as you're being seated I want to say Brother Ray welcome back God bless you God bless you it's good to have you back amen my Aunt Linda it's been a it's good to have her here with us as well and for the Ryan sister Rachel I know they've dealt with some things there in the family and uh brother Ryan we're praying for you all for that the Lord just Comforts your hearts there uh you heard the report of my father-in-law and we just thank God that uh this morning I certainly appreciate your prayers that his um the appetite and that's what we were praying for even this morning as it was praying this morning sometimes you know medicines and other things can really affect you in different ways especially when you're not used to taking them and you know we could look at it and say well just get those medications out of his system and so forth then sometimes there's things that we do have to get out of our system but then there's other parts of it you know where there's a need for certain things to be there and to help and I just said this morning I said God you're still God it doesn't matter where that's at and then the report that we got that what he had ate and was it a full breakfast he ate this morning to drink through the three orange juice things and I mean and so that's as uh this is really good from what from what he has been because he just hasn't had any appetite and just been able to really keep the things down so we just certainly thank God for amen for your prayers and we just want to continue to remember each one in prayer um as we look at this here this morning I I want to just you know I thought of this and I'm looking at this thought and many of those things and some of the people here are individuals young people or maybe middle age now I guess they should say and maybe older you refer when you would read certain books in school and you had to be tested over those books and I don't mean to bring back bad memories you know I but um there's such a thing you know sometimes we would go and say hey let's go get the cliff notes on that book and it was a little yellow book with black stripes and you found the title and you realize you did that to kind of cut to the chase young people covered your ears you you kind of did that to kind of cut to the Chase and all those things now you know it it could help you you know to a to to in a certain extent and things like that but it was to try to summarize and try to make things very simple that might have been a book that was really thick and it would try to summarize it and just simplify even through each of the chapters and so if I could say it like this this morning I pray that God would come the Holy Spirit would come in such a way this would be a cliff note service a service to where the Holy Spirit could take something that when we read these scriptures here in Ephesians 3 and it can seem the wording and the words and it can seem uh so so uh great and overwhelming but there's really God's a god of Simplicity there's words that are said in the way the men those who were moved by the spirit of God when they wrote and they chose certain words they were led by the spirit of God to choose certain words to describe those things and it was God's thoughts that they were coming in tune with and they can write it on paper which they did under his inspiration but it takes the same inspiration that gave it to them that wrote it here to come and lift it out of there and and make it real and what it is it becomes Jesus Christ on display and so when we begin to see this here as we open with that statement that there's things that we have to attend to here in life but it comes down to the very first part and first principle is that God has intended that we would be as Sons and Daughters of God that no matter what capacity we have to work we have to sleep we have to go through all that but that it is a son of son or daughter of God that is on display and operating in whatever that vocation is and that's some of the things in Simplicity that we want to deal with on living out the purpose of God because uh when we look at this we're here to be instruments of his just like this microphone this microphone could have been sent to uh you know some college for lectures to be given it just so it just happened to be this microphone came here this microphone if we decided to sell it on Facebook Marketplace well somebody else could take it and they would use it maybe for other means and you know to sing worldly songs and other things it's just an instrument it doesn't have any mind of its own it can only it can only uh uh uh be used according to what is behind it and we are to we are here to be instruments of his how many know in the scripture where Jesus said I'm Divine you're the branches and to recognize that he says and without me you can do nothing even sometimes the things that we can think and feel like well I'm supposed to be able to do this I should be able to do this and I should and sometimes we can look at even the things that are very natural in life and we can begin to look at just the scope of Earthly things and and feel as though and the thought well you know I can take care of this this is on an Earthly scale but yet to recognize that Lord whatever it is wherever I am whatever job the family you've given me husband and wife so forth and Etc that God we I need you behind me directing me that I might serve the purpose according to your mind and that's where that's the greatest thing that we can have as the Bride of Jesus Christ as a matter of fact that's one of the great characteristics of the Bride of Jesus Christ when the scripture says in Revelations 19 to think of it it says let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb am not the marriage of the lion yet the lion himself has stepped forward with the late claim he's a king that's calling for his Queen but yet what the attribute that is displayed through the life of the Bride is that of the Lamb so she has a lamb nature what is that one that can be led one that is yield one that's willing to be shaved down in mold and and so that's that's the grace of God that is given to you and I in this hour as a matter of fact brother Brandon would say it like this and if God be with us we're Beyond these Miracles he said Lord in his prayer at the end if there's anything that's been accomplished then through our lives it's because your Grace has come and overrode our rebellion in order to fulfill your will now you look at our lives you say well I'm not rebellious I've been I've been born again of the spirit of God no but we recognize that there are things that God has to bring us to that sometimes we look at ourselves and say me me Lord and man you know sometimes it's I don't feel like it or I don't but God in his grace he comes and he overrides and the way that God overrides Rebellion is not with more law or Commandments because that'll breed further Rebellion but God comes with his love which is his word his presence and he lifts us to a place that we can recognize it's not you going to be doing it it's me I just need to borrow your body and oh may God help us to come into that and rest and relax that's the part where Paul said that through the confidence and the boldness by the faith of him that moves in us so I want to just say we're all instruments we're not all the same and neither do uh all the instruments serve the same purpose but we are here for an intended purpose and that's what that's why the scripture said you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done and if we can take that scripture and if you abide in me and my words abide in you to recognize that whatever the purpose is that God has called us to God has given his word in this generation that that purpose might be fulfilled and no matter what obstacle you come up against the word is more than enough to take you through the word will and cannot be defeated so the word taking the word and just speaking to that situation let the word be our comfort and I want to just in in one way just really put a true perspective here this morning because when we would speak about the Eternal purpose of God sometimes and with all of us we can get in our minds about certain things and even even after God God has got a hold of our life and certain ways that he's called us and placed us sometimes we can get to looking at one another we can get to looking at others and we can get to to seeing things and even in our own mind begin to entertain thoughts of how things should be without sir I should be this way or so and so should be this way and when we start dwelling on that right there that's the very moment that we're actually the flow the way God wants to use us we begin to restrict the flow of the spirit of God operating through our lives we're here to be instruments we don't get to choose whether we're a big screwdriver small screwdriver little Hammer big hammer Sledgehammer we don't get to choose that that's all been in God's choosing before the foundation of the world but if we can just find that purpose and yield to it and say Lord this is what you called me to I I'm certain I have a faith in this now Lord I just want to submit and give myself to you that you can fulfill your purpose through my life you say what is that that's an eternal God fulfilling an eternal purpose here in time man so I want to just read a few scriptures here to put a true perspective on some things that we can deal with in First Corinthians 7 17 remember this is the cliff notes version in First Corinthians 7 17 as God has distributed to every man as the Lord hath called everyone so let him walk and so ordain I in all churches is any man called being circumcised let him not become uncircumcised is any called in uncircumcision let him not be circumcised circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of The Commandments of god notice what Paul is putting things where the focus and what's important circumcision as far as in the flesh served as a sign of the abrahamic Covenant that God would then it would move into that of the spirit where Paul said we are circumcised with that which is not of the hands wherein that is the circumcision of the heart where the world the old nature is cut away from our lives and so Paul is here think of where they're standing now because there's there's you know parts around the church at that time and Paul is letting him know that none of that matters but what matters is the keeping of The Commandments of God in other words is keeping the word of God let every man this is a tremendous scripture let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called Art Thou called being a servant care not for it but if thou mayest be made free use it rather so in other words Paul's saying if you're a servant don't look upon and say well I really can't serve God uh the way that if I was a free man no God called you being a servant then remember don't care for it don't become occupied with I'm a servant serve The God Who has called you if you're a free man then Paula says now your freedom that Liberty have to go here to go there in there use it suppose dealing with those that are looking onward in a way of oh if I could just be here or if I could just do this or if I could just do that boy I'd be a better Christian oh if I could just be here or if I could just do there or if I could just live here or if I could just do this oh if I could just do this but where God has called you grow where God has called you that's good are you hearing me see it's Satan's duty to try to get us looking far off to all this Utopia out here all this over here and remember God doesn't make any mistakes are you with me this is why you'll hear Brother random through the message of the hour you will hear him even in the statements questions and answers and on and on when different ones would be asking should we leave our churches should we do this should we do that and what did he say he said you go back to your church and you be on fire for God and it always brought it back down to this one part that brother Brandon would deal with in it because you see when God has really touched a heart and a life in that deep of a way they're not going to be able to settle for anything less than the full word of God right because when the spirit of Truth has come he will lead and guide you into all truth not a Creed not a Dogma it's him that I met it's him that I love it's him that I want to know more it's him not not a church it's him and that's why the covenant could be that you see this is how the message of the Hour come not to bring a control over our lives you should live here you should go there you should do this but the message of the hour came that there might be a real personal relationship between God and his people between you and God that God will direct your life so the decisions that are being made in your life you make them by the absolute of Hallelujah that's why I don't believe his ministers should be telling anybody move here move there or do anything like that because why you become a person's absolute and God never intended a pastor nor any other minister to be the Holy Ghost for you the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost he said he would lead and guide us that's God's per you realize that's God's desire it's just to lead you and guide you personally that's his Delight he loves to talk to you he loves to that dealing with your life and leading you and directing you personally why so that with whatever decision you make in life you choose to take this job you choose to do this there's got to be an absolute in your life when you're tested on that decision that you know I've met God and God led me down this pathway yeah because we're tested Daniel was tested when the will of God was made known and Daniel was tested and he purposed in his heart we're going to serve God and the devil made him prove it that's why faith is so important Revelation is so important and knowing the purpose of God because we will be tested my verse 22 for he that is called in the Lord being a servant is the Lord's free man likewise also he that is called being free is Christ's servant I'm going to tell you these scriptures were very liberating for some brothers and sisters very liberating ye are bought with the price be not Servants of men verse 24 Brethren let every man wherein he is called there abide with God so the spirit of God comes to call us from a life of unbelief to a Faith Life is that right from a life of unbelief to a Faith Life it calls us out of the world and bringing us into Christ that's why Paul could say the gospel in whom you first trusted when the gospel was sounded out you first trusted you believed you see even the gospel being preached the Holy Spirit coming and dealing with the life what is happening within that life where they would begin to turn from the things of the world they would begin to turn even turning away from the world and turning to the things of God in a real repentance what is it that would do that it would be Faith how does faith come by hearing the word of God there's no other way for Faith to come is that right so then it's Faith being based on a true source and then from that that very place right there then it's Faith that's operating to call us out of unbelief into a faith life now I want you to take this in for the true perspective here brother random makes a statement in spoken words Original Seed and I want you to notice our brother Adam is dealing with this on the seat of Abraham because remember that the Seed of Abraham uh Paul would write in Galatians 3 that we when we have been baptized in to Christ Jesus that's talking about Holy Ghost spirit induction we have put on Christ he said then we take on Abraham's seed Not seeds but seed and Abraham's seed is Christ is that right now let's read let me read this quote and here I want you to catch this perspective because sometimes it's the thoughts about things remember even with Elijah James would feel pressed by the spirit of God even though it's wrote in the Old Testament as far as to be able to see Elijah in all these ups and downs and everything but James would be moved by the spirit of God to write that a man subject to like passion such as we are you say why would that be why would that be necessary to remind you and I that Elijah he was a mortal In the Flesh he had the battles he had the times he needed to get under the uh to go to the juniper tree he needed to be refreshed God had Angels there to nurse him to feed him to brush his brow back he had the pressures of the day and God would allow that for you and I had to see that that within that part of humanity there was something greater there than that of the humanity in other words it's not us looking back and say oh if I could just be like Elijah you don't want to be like Elijah you want to be like God was how God was preeminent in the life of Elijah is that right that's why you don't want to be like somebody else if anything at all intrigues or stirs up your life it's not the DNA of that person it's Christ in that life that is challenging and calling to our life that is he's preeminent there let him be preeminent in your life Jesus was the Seed of Abraham fleshly speaking a predestinated seat of Abraham and when the spirit fell on him what kind of a life did he bring he brought a Faith Life what kind of a life now watch this you mean he's going to be a Sojourner like Abraham that's where people get so mixed up today they try to think that a man of God has to do this and follow this and do that oh mercy no let me just say this very clearly if Jesus here this morning was in a Corporal body he would not be wearing a Palestinian robe he'd be wearing a suit like the one he gave me or a shirt tie whatever you know I'm quoting many quotes from the message he what would he would be wearing he would be present and according to his word is that right so now so now it's dealing with our thoughts and and people looking at things of oh so it's a fake life so he's got to be a Sojourner like Abraham so maybe I need to go sell everything and go to Cabela's and go in debt and buy a bunch of tents and walk around no no you can be that a matter of fact can take you further from God because and then what you say well well how can that take me further from God because you've got to know the purpose of God and what God has called you to that was all a type and an example because in this life as Abraham was a Sojourner we are sojourners pilgrims and strangers in this life once we've been born of the spirit of God we can say this world is not my home I'm just a Sojourner what's a Sojourner it's one who is coming to the full promise in my father's house are many mansions right Dwelling Places see often he's right there we're on our way now how was Christ The Seed of Abraham not so much in his body because Isaac the seat of Isaac finally fell it died it backslid and hybrid too he said but the faith Seed of Abraham that he believed God's word regardless of what the circumstances was that's the faith see regardless of the circumstances so whatever the calling is regardless of the circumstances he says all that I feel like shouting the faith Seed of Abraham what was it not Abraham's body but Abraham's Faith Abraham's faith in the word of God no matter what come he called anything contrary to it as though it wasn't there it was a faith seed so when we see this it's God himself that's actually he's operating his life through the predestinated seed of promises I I've used this example many times before but it's just like if I had my cell phone up here there's only one way or let me just use this belt pack here there's only one way that this right here can come across through the system there's got to be not only the same uh brand but it's got to be on the same channel and that has to all be set up and let me say this you and I were set up already before the foundation of the world on the channel and frequency of this hour that's why no other message previously could have had an effect on you but it is the inspiration of this hour the Holy Spirit God revealing his word that has an effect on you and I and what is it it is that of God's life uniting with himself and what it what does it bring forth a new creation just as you need sperm and egg to bring forth the seed was there as the pre-prepared betting ground and God's own life comes in and it quickens and it raises up a new man a son and daughter of God on the inside and then it is God expressing himself through every individual life that's the sovereignty of God it's God living out through you and I his own purpose and it's him no matter what vocation or whatever we were in life it's God calls us to serve his purpose and this is why when we think of that in the scriptures we read there in First Corinthians 7 20 and 24 a lot of times we can get into the thought and I I just say we and and we can still deal with these things sometimes but sometimes we have this what we call a perfect scenario and you know everything's just got this has got to be the perfect her you know and we I I I'm not able to do this if this doesn't happen or this doesn't take place or you know like those who were servants or I really can't serve God the way I need to and you know I'm going to have to be free let me just say this to you there was a little woman who was taken captive by the Syrian Army and she was down there in naaman's house and let me tell you something you think there weren't days that she wasn't down you think there wasn't days that she didn't long for her Homeland you think there wasn't days that she said oh if I could only get let me just bring it to our time a family reunion if I could just see the family well if I could just get back into the Homeland God that's where your blessings are that's where you promised but little did she know that she was there because there was going to be one by the name of Naaman in whose house she would be in and he would be suffering with the leprous condition well was she a gentile oh my and here in the midst of that time think about it when that kid got news and everything he tried everything to take care of his leprosy but she made a declaration there is a God in Israel there's a prophet there who hears from God there's one whom God can speak to she was a testimony not in a place she chose to be in if she would have been given the choice before the foundation the world do you want to serve my purpose of course being of that of a child of God and Alexi she would say sure Lord I want to serve your purpose well this is where you're going to serve my purpose you're going to be a testimony and a light in the house of a Syrian one who will come against my people your people time and time again but I'm going to put you as a light there and it might only be for one little thing that I'm asking you to do but it is for a purpose what are you saying brother Samuel what if that little lady had stood there and said well I really can't serve God all the p's and q's aren't lined up just right everything's just not perfect you know but when all this gets better and I get back in the Homeland be on fire for God no she was there she had to pray through she had to look to God she had a connection with God now let me tell you something she had a strength and a Joy about her life you say brother Samuel how can you say that because there was a testimony even in the midst of that time for her to declare God is still God and there is a God that can minister to your need how do you know that God don't have you in that department on that job and with this one or that one how do you know that your time being right there is not for just a word of testimony and a witness to one do not despise where God has you or look for a perfect scenario [Applause] Paul just instructed him where we read just surrender to the Lord who's called you and abide in your calling let him use you in whatever capacity that God's called you and don't spend your time trying to be like somebody else are you hearing me but where God has placed you and neither don't be comfortable or complacent where God has placed you but say God how might you use me what would you have me to do brother Ram would sound like this and kind of get the picture he said in in classic Spirits I love this quote he said give me a preacher give me a Christian give me a housewife that's a Christian give me a farmer or a factory worker that'll put God first in everything and I'll show you a man will be successful in the spite of all the devil can put on him because he seeks God first notice all the vacations give me a preacher give me a housewife give me a farmer a factory worker one better Christian and I'll put God first I'll show you in regardless of all the devil can put on them they will come out on top because they put God first so the vocation well I'm just a farmer no put God first let God be let God live through you as a farmer all right whatever that God has intended to do as a housewife let God live through you as a housewife now look at this here in Romans 8 28 we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose how many know that everything's not good but it'll work for the good right even even our our bad decisions if we'll if we'll just mind the Lord and say Lord now you help me Lord I want to learn from this I want to grow from this God will make it work to our good now that don't mean that all of a sudden bad decisions we made that God's going to come around with the big eraser and say hey man let me spoil you a little bit and just take all that no that doesn't mean that but he will give you Grace and he will teach you he will guide you through that so that you and I come out of there and say you know what I got in a place I started trusting on the horses and Chariots of Egypt I started leaning on the arm of Flesh I started leaning on my reasoning facing this situation come on now I I know I'm not the only one who builds Bridges there's a lot of people in here a good build Bridge Builders is that right and sometimes listen those are parts of things that are even in our temperament and our makeup and that's why the spirit of God many times standing on the platform would be identified with different ones who were there and say your whole problem your life has been your makeup well did God strip the makeup the temperament out of the person no but it's recognizing you're letting the enemy Get The Best of You by taking that and work against you but God made you that way and it's going to take you surrendering that to God instead of looking at Building Bridges say God I'm going to look at your word Lord I'm going to take your word and I'm going to take it in my life I'm going to quote that word confess that word I don't care whether I feel like it or not whether I feel anything come my way or not I am going to stand on your word [Music] yes Hallelujah [Music] I just got done speaking to young people the way the Lord took it on Friday night and I told him we're talking about habits and establishing good habits of walking through things in a message and we've been dealing with some of those things from the previous time and we're talking we've just you know we just talk in our Bible study and we're there and I said you realize there's many times I said every day is not a pie eaten day I like apple pie but every day is not an apple pie day some days it's a flower day sugar day it's an ingredient day you know what I'm saying now you know I don't really get all over over the top on ingredient days but when the pie is there that's what I'm talking about but that's the same way it is with our life as a Christian what are we going to do on ingredient days because if you don't give yourself to God on the ingredient days that are not the who glory to God this and great no what are you going to do when it's ingredient days because you need ingredients to make the pie I wish I could preach that come on you see that's a true perspective as well in our life sometimes we get to look at one another and we can look at one another and think man they're always on the Mountaintop that's not true let me go and tell you for everybody here that is not the truth that's not a true perspective of a Christian life but our Christian Life is one that's filled with mountains it's filled with valleys but what makes the difference and will help us through is the same God that guides you if you'll just let him that even when you're in a valley don't just let the valley overwhelm you but make a declaration I'm going to praise God in the valley I am going to have the devil confused he's going to think I'm on a Mountaintop but I'm gonna praise him in the valley like I'm on the Mountaintop everybody has valleys everybody's got mountain tops dear Lord we'd love to live on Mountain Transfiguration every day of the week but as soon as Jesus got down off of Mount Transfiguration at the bottom of the hill there was problems right Abraham came down from Mount Moriah a little bit after that Sarah died is that right thank God for Mountaintop experiences but we can't live on the mountains well let's go for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren more of whom he did predestinate them he also he justified in whom he justified them he also glorified so we are made for a purpose everything around us them pews they were made for a purpose to have a place to sit right the church all this was here it was made it's a purpose that we might have a place to come and worship write our house our house was made with a purpose for what for us to live in the automobile it wasn't just a bunch of guys saying I wonder if we can get a bunch of metal together and you know whip something up no it was with the purpose okay and it wasn't just all together to rip you off it was with the purpose then you might be able to drive from one point to the next so everything's with a purpose even when it comes to the fingernail for those of you that got them on your fingers the fingernail itself very interesting not going to take a lot of time on it but if you didn't have fingernails you'd have a hard time turning pages and believe it or not your fingernails have a sensitivity in them where nerves are connected there that's a different time so everything in itself I mean the food the food that was raised it was grown for a purpose for what not decorations but to eat it right I mean apples were not made to eat by themselves apples were made tea with brown sugar and oats the same I dislike them you need to come on up higher in Revelation all right the tree was made for a purpose right you're going to buy a tree for your house you select the tree based on your need because that tree already has built in there's a purpose even in how that that that it is brought forth whether it's one that can dwell you know in in swamping Marshy areas do you want a shade tree fruit on and on there's a purpose behind it and that's why God did not make you and I and just see if he could do it did not bring you this far just to see if he could do it brother Ben said he just didn't make you just to be a human being you are ordained to be a silent daughter of God what are you saying I'm saying deity being expressed through Humanity what God was in Christ Christ has now come into the believer it's the same Jesus the same yesterday and forever the same deity on this play the same life the same quality inside of you and I we're here for a specific purpose no matter how little you are how unimportant you think you are we're here for a purpose that is not a pep talk that's a reality what are you saying don't get caught up in what you're calling just be focused on the god who's called you and say Lord what would you have me do let my life become a life that's filled with real Vision like it says in the book of of Ephesians 1 Paul prayed for this that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him can I just say something here this is not a One-Shot deal what do you say I'm saying that the Revelation continues to be unfolded I'm saying that God continues to unfold himself even through our tests and our trials and God permits the oppositions to come our way that brings you and I to the realization it's not me that's doing it now I have it's not me that's been doing it it's been God now here's a situation that God just wants to remind you and I it's me the whole time I'm your Waymaker I'm the one to take you through and God uses those times to let you and I know I've never abandoned you I've never left you but what you might think is too great I've ordained you for this purpose just yield to me preaching I don't mind telling you that verse 17 we need that as parents I don't mind telling you I need it as a pastor I need it as a husband but God continued to unfold in our lives but the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you might know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints I want to know I want to know God let the eyes of my understanding you you say what do you mean I'm saying that we continue to grow in Christ I'm not the same that I was even a year ago I can tell you that there's a lot of lessons I've learned there's a lot of things that God has already has brought me through a lot of things I've learned even from when I first started pastoring let alone as a Daddy has a husband there's a lot of things I've learned and guess what I'm still learning I don't have a PhD yet in any of those categories as a matter of fact I've just walked across the kindergarten stage and got my certificate and I'm ready to start oh brother Sammy you're just funding with us no I'm not funning with you because you know why the Bible says grow and Grace is that right the Bible also says at the very concluding verse of where it talks about that these bodies shall be changed in a moment in twinkling of an eye the final verse says that you would be abounding in the work of the Lord that there is continual growth and quickening by the spirit of God until we leave here I'll tell you what I'm not interested in advancements in the natural world I'm interested in an advancement out of here are you hearing me now I'm not interested listen friends Joseph never tried to placade or tried to play on his boss Joseph didn't do that Joseph was just simply being Joseph there in the prison he had his times of weeping at his times of crying he had his times I don't understand God gave me this this dream as a 17 year old boy and here I am standing here and what is taking place I don't know what's going on but Joseph by God's grace was able to yield himself to where in the midst of the prison the Bible could say the Lord was with him not because Joseph yielded but the Lord was with him and helped him to yield beyond all his sorrow Beyond everything do you realize that when Joseph himself finally got married and had a child the very first child that he had called Manasseh said the Lord hath caused me to forget all of that in the past oh my I tell you talking about the power of forgiveness it comes through and by the sea life of Jesus Christ moving into our lives Joseph he had a vision of what God had wanted to do now I just I'll just say it in this way that there's a man God desires that we be people of vision not of this not not of this worth not of this Earth but when we look beyond the visible and look into the Unseen to where that there's a purpose that we are moved by in life because the whole the Bible tells us the whole conclusion what we're here for is to fear God and to keep his Commandments that's the whole purpose that we're here is to serve God when it all comes down and said and done and we can stand before a casket I don't care how good a person's been thank God for good people but it ain't been good to put you on the other side well I know they love Jesus really sometimes those are things that people can say and they never have a life that matches it I'm sorry we got to be genuine and true you say why because the truth is the truth if you love him you will keep his Commandments that's the word of God John 14 John 16 if you don't love him it shows now you can love him here but here's where you got to love him you can love him here and it'll fade but when it gets down here that's the love of God that's where no devil can ever overthrow that that's the prevailing power of almighty God you see the purpose that we're here for Stay With Me Now the purpose that you and I are here let me read this out of spoken words Original Seed brother answer our heavenly father you said in your word if I be lifted up from the earth I will draw all men unto me and that is our purpose in life is to lift up before a dying generation of people that Jesus Christ is still the Son of God the savior of the world oh my brother REM says here and just once more he raised you as an example that he might place his power in you to show forth his glory that's what we're here for Ephesians 1 as it talks about this I just have to skip some of this but out of Ephesians 1 where it speaks our calling that we have been blessed with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places according out they had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love are you still with me we're going to get to us a cliff known here in a minute having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself it's not adoption like we think of it out there today this is a placement we were always Sons and Daughters of God a real child of God here this morning that's something that's real then we were always a son and daughter of God God come and Drew us to himself when we're to be to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he have made us accepted in the Beloved now God positionally placing the church brother Brian says the church positionally before the foundation of the world when God in his labor pain was bringing forth bringing forth you knowing what you would do he positionally placed you into his own body to be a housewife did I read that right that don't seem like maybe a real spiritual part but God positionally placed you into his own body to be a housewife to be a farmer to be a preacher to be a prophet to be this or be that he placed you positionly so if we look at that correctly it doesn't matter housewife farmer preacher prophet it's all placed in the body God's God a purpose Joshua remember Joshua was not there deciding well I think I like this tribe a lot better you know they bring me a little bit more treats and things like that no no Joshua divided according to the inspiration that God had in his mind for every one of those tribes of Israel even what Jacob had prophesied under inspiration they were Place positioned yet to this day placed exactly where they are to be according to the characteristic of their name and God placed them there not to think of it when they would get into those places it was not it was not something that you know would be let's say foreign but God had ordained that Ephraim would be here Judah would be here and on and on God ordained that and the only thing they had to do was yield to that inspiration and go take what belonged to him now just because it was given to him did not mean everything was cleared out they had to go in and take what God gave to them and let me say this to you that even when it comes down into our life when the Holy Ghost has come remember the land of promise is not the Millennium the land of promise the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the land of overcoming it's overcoming what is it that overcomes the world he that's born of God and this is that which overcometh the world even our faith so there is overcoming that has to be done Caleb had some overcoming in his land is that right you said brother Samuel what are you saying I'm saying that even as God has placed a person as a housewife there's overcoming there sometimes the overcoming is trying to compare ourselves to somebody else and can I just say this you may not like me but I'm going to say it anyhow don't compare yourself to some demo magazine either that's robed by somewhere only person of something else and I'm going to be the latest this and I'm going to be the God has already given us his word oh brother Samuel an email yes it is in there it's in there explicitly wrote out in Titus in Timothy all the way through in Corinthians and there are examples with all of the sisters all the way down through the Old Testament it's there but you see what Satan's desire is to do is to get in and try to interpret what a position should be and that's what's caused all the confusion and the mess the way it is right now in the world it was prophesied to come but we're living in a time where the Bible said they would be lovers of themselves more than lovers of God Lover's a pleasure right they love themselves but to thank God has positionally placed Us in in his body now I want you to think of it in this way uh in first First Peter chapter 3 verse 1. notice Paul is writing this here I want you to think of this here just for a moment likewise you wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be one by the conversation of the wise that word conversation isn't words come on friends this is character and conduct not the words over and over brother Rams asked the questions throughout when there's not a believing spouse and people you have men ask it you have women ask it a a bountiful mouth in all the questions and answers good question it's a good point it's something that it's something that is the church and people to be able to see and to understand you would have those that would say Hey you know I I I'm married and you know my spouse's not a Believer should I just go ahead and get divorced and go on and marry somebody else no the Bible said that if the unbelieving be pleased to dwell with you dwell with them they might never be saved but if there's any hope it's going to be because of your life being surrendered to God and you being a testimony of the joy of the Lord of what it means to serve God let him be one by the conversation brother bam used the word be salty but you see how Satan could also trap people into a place perfect scenarios in order for me to be what God wants me to be and to do this I need to divorce this one and I need to remarry this one there's no grounds for that sorry [Music] there's no grounds for those types of things I know there's been where there's certain things I won't even go into that where there's been things where people have little things of loopholes and one of them and there's no grounds for that friends when we look at these very things when it comes down to it looking for perfect scenarios on things oh well you know I'm in this situation and I really can't serve God who said you can't serve God maybe the situation that you're in is not a situation that you can look at now and say I wouldn't have made this decision before but right now say you know what I'm not going to let this situation keep me back from giving everything and all that I am to God because man's not calling me God's calling me and that's what I'm yielded to and that's why brother random could give I think it's beautiful when he could give the admonition to different ones and say hey look do they even take it right from the scripture don't seek to go this way or that way just be a real example what was he giving them a true perspective that you can be an effectual Christian and if you want to be a witness and a light maybe God has called you to be a witness and a light right there maybe not Ecuador maybe next door oldie but a goodie verse 2 while they behold your Chase Comfort conversation coupled with reverence who's adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plating the hair and wearing of gold or putting on of apparel so it's just nothing that's put on on the outside but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God a great price for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands oh Lord that certainly won't fit into society will it even a Sarah will be obey do well and are not afraid with any amazement likewise your husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as under the weaker vessel and the brothers said as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered you're pulling that from The Book of Malachi when they came to the altar God said you've been fussing in your home go back and straighten that up then come back to the altar that's cliff notes for what was said I know you know I thought about there was actually some other thoughts and just how God LED it I was going to speak on one of the thoughts anointed mothers of the scripture but begin to look at this and just how the Holy Spirit lining this up from things has been over some time sister meedy she made a maybe she made a statement when brother bill came home the one time and remember Joseph had a little boy you know he she was going to tan his hide for something you know he did and and you know brother Brandon was able to see that you know not that it may not have deserved it or needed it brother Brown wasn't given him a a pass within it but you know there's a lot of things going on at the time and I'd say it like this sister Rebecca Branham even tells in a testimony of where there was some friction between her and her mom that had come up and brother Branham called Rebecca into the office she just a young teenager and he began to go through with her and tell her your mom was coming into a season of life and so you may not understand what's taking place but he walked through all of that sister Rebecca gives that testimony I think it's about a 45-50 minute clip on there and where she was coming into menopause now think about what brother Brown did Brother Bram could have taken that and he could have told Rebecca now he he did tell her to respect her mother he walked her through but I hope you understand what I'm saying he opened the eyes of her understanding are you hearing me now we're talking about a father he could have just came right out six shooters on tap and we're going to blast them but he gave the eyes of understanding now here she's coming in there's no doubt this is during those times as well too the pressure is on and remember when she made a statement to brother Brandon brother brand was you know just trying to tell her don't I don't think you need to we need to do that right now and her statement to him was well you ought to be here to care for him right and you know she came down because the Holy Spirit did not like that is that right and brother Bram said oh God no no no and what came up on her was a tumor cancerous tumor now I want you to think of this brother Brown's in prayer right before a meeting and I want to read this to you and I want I want you to the perspective is how God looks at the purpose that we serve and especially when we look at it when even as the sisters the housewives right now as you'd think of this and you look look at this says Lord she didn't mean to do that that morning Lord not one time has she ever said one word about me going in the meetings and staying months or whatever it was not one time has she ever opened her mouth about it she has always sent my clothes to the cleaners washed my shirts and had everything ready to go in the meeting then she wonders how she can serve God then she wonders how she can serve god brother Graham says you women as you serve your husband you serve God course you know friends I when I get to looking at certain things let me just go on I could go into some certain areas now but every one of us are born for a purpose we're all born for a purpose and you look at certain things there was an article that um a little thing from from about a year ago year and a half maybe two years ago now where they had interviewed some different women there out of sin and CNN had done it I know don't tune me out because I said CNN but but in any hate in any rate the things that they interviewed and talk to these women and I read this write-up where all of them had decided they didn't want kids I don't want kids and the way that when everything comes down to if I can give you a cliff notes of that right there it come down with it it's going to hinder my lifestyle because now we got to think about kids instead of us me and my partner who's proven to be my husband we don't have to think about kids we just think about us we want to travel here we go here we do this we do that then you have others that well I deal with a lot of anxiety I deal with this and you know I don't on and on through that article there's things that are synonymous common underlier fear and selfishness and let me tell you something fear will always come in that way God has ordained these principles in his word what has happened in there where did that come from are you hearing me now where did that come from that those thoughts can be made you know when you look at statistics people's thinking on motherhood changed in the 1950s I know I'm talking about I've done a lot of research on this Statistics even changes even with a lot of things being done I want to ask you how did that come about it came about because the church got away from the word you see if one position is vacated then it has an effect on other positions because one is the church what's the what's the duty of the church is the church to be a society of clubs is it to be a place that we just We Gather to have a good time what's the purpose of the Church of the Living God is to lift out the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of the Church of the Living God is that there would be lives that are birthed into the kingdom of almighty God real motherhood that's the objective of the Church of the Living God but when they rejected Christ they rejected the mail they rejected his oversight with the word and said we will take it and do it our own way look at the effect that it has even to what we see going on in society today how sad that is and you know what brother Brown says when motherhood is broken the backbone of the nation is gone and that's been gone a whole long time ago a whole long time ago see it's where Society has come in and wanted to condition and I'm saying this for a point friends do you realize how blessed you are to be under the message of the hour to have a heart that that what does it do call you back to a rightful inheritance in Jesus Christ do you realize sisters how blessed you are because the world does not give you your rightful place it wants to strip you down put you out and have you prostitute your body out there and everything else and demoralize but the Gospel of Jesus Christ dresses you up and presents you as a real Trophy and a lady of God that's what the gospel really does but this world is a world that pushes my rights me too E2 YouTube that's that's the world we're not of the world we're not of the world that's what God has given us a message to call us out of this mess he gave us a message to call us out of the mass that's here and bring us back into our inheritance and it doesn't listen to me it doesn't mean that there's not challenges sometimes the challenges and the overcoming of God's grace is where you have to be willing we have to be willing to look face to face in the mirror and allow the spirit of God to comb through our lives and say God am I hindering You by complexes by past hurts from fulfilling the beauty you've called me to do God has a right example is everybody okay God's got a right example and God has set that right example it's just like if you take like a woman and she's been raised in a home where her mama trampled on Daddy and cut daddy down and did everything else it will take the grace of God in her life to realize that's not a true image that God never intended for me to be that way are you hearing me it'll be the same way if a boy was raised in a home and Daddy trampled on Mama it'll take God's grace in his life to realize he may not physically do anything but to realize wait a minute we're in this together submitting ourselves to one another in the fear of God whoa it's talking about positionally placed in Christ see God never gives us scriptures to use for our own just for our own own selfish motives it'll never work the word is meant to work in position and in season is that right whoo so we're all born for a purpose how many have heard this story about the little wash woman she got a burden on her heart and think about a wash woman I wonder how many times she complained about being a wash woman I'm quoting but I'm just gonna I'm gonna paraphrase it here she was she got on her heart God put something on her heart to do something for him and she rented out now I don't know how big it was Livery stable I don't think it was an Airbnb that had a nice pool in the background this was a livery stable this is history she rented that stable out and she cleaned that thing up brought benches in there and they invited a preacher to come in and preach a Revival right there and here was a boy with long hair comes right to the front that night and gives his life to God you'll know his name Dwight Moody she got a burden on her heart maybe that's the only thing that she ever was to do but the main thing is she served God and she was so in touch with God to when God said go get a livery stable probably like you and I she probably would have said Livery stable I don't even ride horses and go clean it up clean it up it's enough cleaning all the rest of these houses that I clean but I live very stable I gotta pick up horse manure and everything else and Matt that no Lord but you see friends listen her flesh was no different than your flesh or my flesh but what it comes down is to yielding to the spirit of God what a blessing it is to be in tune with his leading and follow what he has for us to do and that's why brother Adam says don't despise where God has you but serve the purpose that he has you therefore I want you to think about it let me read this quote out of out of the message influence but the brand says it's unscriptural for you or I to impersonate anyone else and that's why I say it like this I appreciate examples Titus talked about the Elder Brothers being an example to the youngers of how to be talked about the older women how to be an example to the younger women I think that's important friends we've talked about I really want to fulfill the word of God well how can we fulfill the seven seal and not fulfill that oh boy we're getting tight now aren't we but see what we're doing is we're wanting to skip God has called us and you know what I'll tell you just like I told my boy as I said I trust that the mistakes I've made you use them as stepping stones and I said when you start getting to certain Junctions in your life we'll have some more talks because I'll have some things that I want to share with you even in those times why I want I want their home I want it to be better I want them to start higher why should they make the same mistakes or have to go through the night we under we all have mistakes to make right but my desire is not for that it's that that our lives would grow would start in a higher place so I'm thinking in like this right here you know sometimes sister you can look at somebody else and say oh if I could just be like sister so and so young person middle-aged person something and you know it's not just the young people sometimes you look to another one well if I could just be like that and they look like the perfect example and this is what a housewife is to be and this and this and this and this and this listen God never called you to measure Yourself by somebody else he called you to measure Yourself by the word let every man abide in the calling wherein he was called man who a listen I don't expect my wife to be my mama I don't expect that I don't expect you to do everything like my mama did it or whatever more God gave me Grace to move beyond that a long time ago but we are all individual and neither does she expect me to be you know like her daddy or or anybody else or whatever more there's things we learned this is why the Bible I don't know I'm just going on this this is why the Bible said let a man leave father and mother let him cleave to his wife in other words God has brought that Union together and there should be a culture that is developed in that Union there is a uniting and a blending of two are you hearing me and you know what there's going to be some differences but that's part of the position we're in judah's inheritance didn't look like ephraims ephraims didn't look like nefertile it didn't look like them but they each had their inheritance is that right everyone positioned so I'm saying like this don't try to be like somebody else if there can be encouragements you can take from one another but you realize you can get in your own mind of what a of what a Christian is or what a housewife is and you can create an image that you or nobody else can ever live up to and you know what you walk around defeated are you hearing me abide where God has placed you be what you are and be a good one fulfill your purpose so others can see you if you're a housewife be a real one if you're a husband be genuine if you're a deacon be genuine there you go Deacons just wonder if you just want to get at them and if you're a dealer a preacher whatever you are your arm wants this church being like another church God don't want me as a pastor being like another Pastor every church is sovereign your home is Sovereign you have an opportunity to get in contact with God and the leadership of the Holy Spirit coming down in your home Hallelujah that's God's grace and don't let anything stand in the way of that purpose brother Brown when he talks about Moses talks about Moses life who did Brother Brown always give credit to well support helped him out a whole lot I could go on that angle but I want to run on that one today his mother the Bible tells us those scriptures we read last week that Moses even from the begins right there in verse 23 by faith Moses see that Revelation was already working it was in their heart he's here for a specific purpose God revealed it to him right it's like when the angel of the Lord came to Samson's mother and when his mother went and told Daddy Daddy said ask him to come again why that we may know how to order the child's footsteps oh my god's got a purpose and Lord I don't want us I don't want to Fumble stumble Bumble this up I want the angel of the Lord who brought and gave us this child I'm asking for your wisdom because you know what the purpose is you have for us so as as a Manoa said ask him to come again well you know with Mo with Moses mother go to the next scripture for me by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter he still wasn't born again yet go to the next scripture choosing rather to suffer Affliction from the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season still wasn't born again yet next scripture is steaming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect under the recompense of the Roar still wasn't born again yet he refused he chose and he esteemed tell me who had the effect on his life you realize what a blessing it is as a mother when brother Brown would bring those dedications and he'd say and I said we don't believe in women preachers but you are the Fifth Gospel he said well you can be telling them Bible stories well I'm not a preacher we'll tell them the Bible story read them a Bible story brother Brown said do that rather than having them learning tap dancing classes of things that will take them further from God right brother got kids nowadays to know more about Davy Crockett than they know about Jesus Christ right so when I I look at within this right here I asked the question because it struck my heart I was when I was I was talking with the young people on Friday evening and uh just the way the words had come out and we were looking at it and I asked the question to them I said how do you think Moses mother was here she was in the house of pharaoh she wasn't in Goshen she was in the house of pharaoh you think that was a perfect scenario to be teaching the promises of God no I won a perfect scenario at all but you know what that was where God had placed her and she taught him the things of God not just teaching him but I asked this question to the young people because I realize these young people God Terry's they're going to be young men young women on and out and getting married and I said let me ask you a question how do you think Moses Moses Mom and Dad handle things you think they were passive about the message or you think they were intentional how do you think they were passive or intentional okay and you that's something that you have to interpret you have to look at and see that you know if we're passive we can things can be kind of manipulated and cut all around it would have never had this effect this is a young man that don't even have the Holy Ghost yet doesn't even have the Holy Spirit had never met God yet but the impact of an intentional and bringing God near had an impact on his life that when things got hard that God had skin on he could refuse certain things choose certain things esteem listen friends I'm not saying every child or whatever everything's going to be perfect and man everything but I am saying this right here what a blessing and a responsibility that as parents that we have and I say God bless you to the mothers and the sisters that would take that of the word of God and laying in and just standing right there and reminding and lifting up the promises of almighty God you say I don't think it's going to do any good it did with Moses it affected choices he eventually made and eventually that same Faith led him to the path of obedience direct quote it led him to a face-to-face meeting with God if they've got to go some way show them the way right just don't let them out there on their own Point them in the right way the Bible said bring up a child and the way it should go and when it grows old it'll not depart I say what a blessing what an opportunity what a blessing it is to be able to stand in position be able to hold the message of the hour and be able to Proclaim that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I say God for every parent in here every grandparent every one of us and listen even if you don't got kids say God let me be effectual if I'm an older brother let me look up some of these young ones and be a factual Lord and be an example to them and do what the scripture has asked me to do all right glory be to God oh brother Samuel I don't got time for that well let me tell you something I think if God's word has asked for it and what a responsibility what a blessing it is I'd say that we should make time for God's word above everything else I said God help us God help us the message has positionally placed us and has let us know like me sister meaty said what can I do for God and here she was serving the purpose of God sending his clothes to the cleaners cooking the meals you sisters know that that even haven't come into that place of sister media I can't even imagine many times I I think about it I try to think about it in life and knowing just what she had to endure but you know what God called her to it it didn't mean it was easy are you hearing me God called her to it but it didn't mean it was easy just because God has called you to something does not mean it's easy but he will give you Grace and strength to fulfill what he's called you to do and when you feel like you can't make another step that's where you go to him and say Lord help me Lord right here if it got a little passive with things say God forgive me let me be intentional God first God first every decision we make every decision Let It Be how is this going to affect my walk with God our family with God that's the kind of lives we want to live intentional and positionally placed in Christ you see it takes Christ to bring forth what a real mother is it takes Christ to bring forth a real father that being in the land is where we're baptized into the Holy Ghost our purpose is to display Jesus Christ through a manifold body it's him it's God being displayed through a housewife God being displayed through a mother through a sister through a father through a husband it's God on discipline let me just say it to you like this it's ordinary purposes being fulfilled through extraordinary means ordinary purposes being fulfilled through extraordinary means it's Christ in you the hope of glory so don't despise where God has you don't look or if I could just be here if I could just do this or if I do what God has called you to do can I give one more example uh I don't want to go too much into this today but I think it'd be good to say it here there was a brother in the Tabernacle brother Brown comes to the pulpit and brother Bram talked to he he calls his brother out and he says brother he said you've been kind of struggling with what you've been trying to do some other things and here and there he said but he said if you can see it what God's called you to do is to sing he said now if you'll just yield to that God will use you he said I believe that's your purpose to me it's a powerful statement those little statements like those those are things of nuggets I put in a script bag for years and look back over those things you know why it didn't mean that that brother didn't battle one wonder if he battled the thought sometimes of am I singing too much but you see what it is God let him know this is your purpose every one of us have a purpose where instruments to be used by God and let me tell you this when you're not letting yourself be used by God and yielding to God in the right way you'll never have the victory that you need to have in your life even having the Holy Spirit God intends to use you and to operate through you are you hearing me let's pray Lord Jesus Lord I trust them oh God just the simplicity that Lord you would give to us in looking at these things to realize you don't want us to be like somebody else we don't have to be big something little something Lord the perfect scenario is truly just being yielded to you yielded to your voice a faith life that's what the Holy Spirit comes to produce and bring forth from every seed of God every bit of leaf every bit of apples everything that's in that seed or that comes out is already in it it's the spirit of God that comes to release it the father I pray here this morning that God for every one of the needs and for different ones through the body maybe there's been Lord thoughts because we all at times the Lord your Prophet even battled with that fought when he walked out of Oral Roberts facilities he looked at it but Lord I must not be able to be trusted by you but you told him look up I'm your portion it was in that moment that he yielded and said Thank You Lord he didn't live the rest of his days comparing himself to Oral Roberts or Billy Graham as a matter of fact Lord your Prophet would even say in three kinds of Believers he said God has placed you as a housewife he said and you would say I'm just a housewife but God has placed you just as he has evangelists prophets teachers on and on and on and on God I pray this morning maybe there's a mother that's here a father and Lord here they are as a father a mother and maybe Lord they've been and are being faithful Lord in that purpose may they not miss the main purpose and that's Lord to be born again to be surrendered Lord to you but their life might be filled with deity because the lord it's then that we really become positionally placed in Christ and then those attributes father mother all of those attributes farmer factory worker lawyer whatever it is it comes out of our life but it's Christ on display as a factory worker Christ on display as a housewife Christ on display as a farmer Christ on display Lord father I pray God may you just continue to give Grace the even the oppositions that come up Lord in our land of inheritance I pray that God that with each one Lord may they look to you Lord for what you have ordained for their lives we can Lord take examples we can take encouragement from one another that you don't want us to spend our time trying to be like somebody else but God may we give of the strength we have in yielding ourselves to you Lord I pray God you know everything about our lives and the purpose that you have us here for nor do we want to serve it we want to serve it well father I pray that you would forgive us Lord God I pray throughout this congregation this morning father may as we see the value and the privilege Lord that God as you have given to us children I thank the lord of the mothers as they sat here and Fathers as well but Lord if this being Mother's Day and how that opportunity Lord to be able Lord just to lay in the word of God just to express that Lord just to be their lord to nurture in the things of God through the hard times through the tough times through the teenage times Lord and as your Prophet told us in the beginning of indictment we must suffer through those moments Within God I believe we are called to be Overcomers so whatever opposition that is present may you Lord God I pray as we look to you give the grace that's needed Lord father you're a God who restores your God lord who mends what's torn who heals what's broken I pray fathers we just give ourselves to you and under this glorious message of the hour Lord that has been Lord God an imparting of our inheritance brings to light our position in Christ Lord help us father help each and every one of us Lord no matter the vocation no matter the calling Lord may we just Lord God of just surrendering our hearts and our lives to you that whatever capacity it is if it's like that little wash woman that what she did at that time was yield herself and here came a man by the name of Dwight Moody Lord oh God help us Lord I pray we love you and we thank you Father in Jesus precious name amen I tell you I always believe it be in order in anything we do I'll share with you just some things that I pray I pray and ask God to help me to be a better pastor and what I mean by better is Teach Me Lord give me the wisdom that I need in this season as a father I pray there's been a lot of situations as a father that I didn't know exactly how to deal with it might have things where how I felt like dealing with it but I've looked to God In Prayer have you been perfect no not been perfect so throw out that perfect scenario but I've learned and I'm still learning as a husband I've asked God help me to be a better husband Teach Me Lord teach me your ways help me Lord to be more sensitive help me in this season and this time as things change Lord help me in each of these moments now I'll tell you I know there's young people in here and I've said this throughout God's got a purpose and God's got a plan for your life God has all of this laid out as a purpose if you just let him lead you and guide you you might be going to college school career and you might have all these things but let me just tell you something don't ever make plans that Jesus can't interrupt say God above all things I want your will let me just tell you something I think everybody here parents would probably agree with me parents would probably say I'm in agreeing with that save yourself some loan money save yourself save your father and mother save some of that I know sometimes we had to go through saying things in our life but I'll tell you this if you'll just ask God lord what do you want me to be I believe God's got doctors I know he does God's got lawyers I know that's hard to believe that's a paradox I got some buddies and a lawyers pastors but see it's God operating through many different vocations and I just say like this remember if you can find that purpose that God has you for brother Brown says you save yourself a whole lot of trouble and God too just find that place and the other thing about it is you can save yourself some money too I know that kind of like got everybody's attention at the moment but I I say it in this way friends listen God's interested about everything of your life let him unpack and unfold through your life when God met Abraham there on the planes he unfolded to Abraham who he was he said Blessed Be Abram of the most high God and what you're going to need for this journey I'm given to you Bread and Wine on the day of Pentecost he gave us Bread and Wine he gave us what was needed for the journey didn't mean there weren't going to be some challenges and some oppositions things when we had my wife and I were having children and things I hope that's okay Paul firstborn AKA guinea pig we had this guy he was born in June and we had him bundled up like he was going to catch a cold it might have been some other source of influence on that one but we took him into the doctor and you know the doctor looked at us and we said he's getting like it looked like a little rash on his legs and things like that you know what the doctor turned the doctor came in there not only did we have him bundled up like that we had all the blankets we probably would have had a down blanket we'd have had that on then too the doctor said take this he took that whole zip up thing and left him in his ones he said that's all he needs right now it's it's it's summertime it's 80 some degrees out here you're going to burn this boy up you know what we learned a lot we kept on learning the time Benjamin came along we kept on learning by the time Zachary came along cruise control no listen I mean what are you saying uh here's what I'm trying to tell you that even where God has placed you factory worker farmer husband wife father mother grandfather on and on there's always going to be challenges that's why sometimes I kind of just smile a little bit when all the yeah we've got everything down you know as parents and ain't had one kid what do you do you smile God bless you God bless you oh it's a blessing I love my children it's a blessing even at the times that where I've had to ask God lord what do I do here and in moments and situations where I know I didn't have the answer right there at that moment but I know he did God help me God help us God deal with the heart God Minister here God speak to hear you see there's overcoming in your position let me tell you something God is proving his word through your life as a housewife he's proving his word through your life as a factory worker he's proving his word through your life as a deacon whatever the occupation father or mother God's proving his word through your life you know what God is saying this is what a real father is I said brother Sammy you don't know all the mistakes and everything else look we're not focusing on all the mistakes it's the grace that's come now walk in it you can't go any further if you live in your past take the grace and walk forward in it are you hearing me that's what the grace of God come to do lift up God's grace in your life because how do you know that through your life there are things that God can work through to share to somebody else that can be of a help to somebody else along the way let me tell you something your experiences even your failures and even your mistakes don't throw Autumn up and throw them in the trash can say God it's all working for my good and through that right there God can work through your life to help somebody else you believe that say I'm going to go on with the Lord I I'm going on with the Lord Jesus I'm going to be intentional in my walk with God every day Lord let me be intentional let me Lord be effectual I don't want to be a know-it-all but I want to be looking to you Jesus I want to be looking to you every step of the way no matter how many years I've been married no how many of the father and mother no matter how long I serve God I want to be looking to you
