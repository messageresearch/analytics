[36:11] thankful for the opportunity to come
[36:13] this morning for the sim kind of called
[36:16] last minute and asked us to come and we
[36:19] didn't know for sure if we'd be able to
[36:22] come because I knew it's just a loretta
[36:23] wasn't able to drive and and I don't
[36:26] drive that good anymore
[36:28] I Drive good it's just that I somebody
[36:31] said I had bedroom eyes they keep going
[36:37] closed and when they go close I like to
[36:42] sleep so driving is not a real good
[36:46] thing for me if it's a long distance
[36:47] anyways but we're certainly happy to be
[36:49] here and brother Kinsel act it was so
[36:51] gracious this morning from our
[36:53] assemblies a guitar players there a
[36:55] musician's been there for well since
[36:58] almost at the beginning of the church in
[36:59] many many years now and for the kids a
[37:01] good buddy of mine and so I called him
[37:03] there are texts and rather and said hey
[37:04] would you like to go with me
[37:07] he text me back and said okey-dokey I
[37:11] had heard that term in a long time but
[37:13] years old as us okie-dokie work so so
[37:17] okey-dokey here we are but we're happy
[37:20] to be here III called brother Sam right
[37:24] let him call me yesterday and talk with
[37:26] him a little bit not really wanting to
[37:29] get into any of his territory for the
[37:32] New Year's and for Christmas and things
[37:34] of that nature I didn't know exactly
[37:35] which direction to go this morning but
[37:37] God had laid on my heart once he had
[37:40] called and asked us or text us and asked
[37:42] us to come the Lord kind of been dealing
[37:44] with me to speak this morning a little
[37:47] different thought and not really
[37:51] preached but maybe just a little
[37:53] admonishment a little teaching that
[37:56] we've done at home we've done it for a
[37:59] couple years in a row I think we've been
[38:02] able to speak they're on it in in that
[38:05] is then they're simply on setting goals
[38:07] in our life setting goals in our life so
[38:14] with your permission and I already have
[38:16] his it's not on no I don't wanna work
[38:47] okey-dokey we will
[39:06] okey-dokey I don't matter it's something
[39:15] what's easier on you are you sure
[39:25] perhaps if you let me this morning I'll
[39:27] just share some things from from my
[39:29] heart I've done it with a home church
[39:31] there in at home with with brother
[39:33] Paul's group the last couple years and
[39:36] our family for I don't know how many
[39:38] years or just more than I could even
[39:40] account right now but we have always
[39:42] tried to have around New Year's a
[39:46] goal-setting session with our family
[39:50] where we'd all get together and come
[39:52] together and we we'd write down our
[39:53] goals for the coming year and and for
[39:57] short-term for long-term spiritual goals
[40:00] and natural goals and health goals and
[40:02] financial goals and just goals goals
[40:04] goals you would just write them down and
[40:06] it's always been a blessing because that
[40:09] they're coming when the next year comes
[40:11] we'd get our piece of paper out if we
[40:13] can find him I never could find mine but
[40:16] we'd get our piece of paper out and we
[40:17] would go through the list of what we
[40:19] wrote down and and what we saw come to
[40:23] pass what God has helped us bring the
[40:25] past that year and it's astonishing some
[40:28] of the things I'll share some of those
[40:29] things with you when we come down to the
[40:31] end of this so I thought maybe this
[40:33] morning if it's okay with everyone we'll
[40:35] just take a little time well it'll be
[40:38] relaxed I won't be preaching so is there
[40:42] any visitors or anybody visiting this
[40:44] morning or are you all any I'm not gonna
[40:47] want to barish I just want to know if

[44:31] to do is what sorry son that's how he
[44:37] gets by now I know but Sam's younger
[44:39] than I am he's got good eyesight so and
[44:42] but this this ain't all up there I wish
[44:45] I would have had time to do that
[44:47] I wrote this out the other day while I
[44:48] was trying to get some thoughts together
[44:51] here so one more time father bless this
[44:54] meeting in Jesus name Amen
[44:57] god bless you you may be seated so I
[45:00] want to speak a little bit on goal
[45:01] setting today if you don't mind and like
[45:02] I said we our family has done this for a
[45:04] number a number of years and I want to
[45:08] just take the time it hopefully won't be
[45:11] very long but what I want to do is just
[45:14] share some things that I feel are
[45:17] principles of life or important things
[45:19] enough to to do the right things in life
[45:23] I know the LaFontaine family is not
[45:26] anything special as far as being any
[45:30] different than anybody else God has
[45:32] blessed us God is
[45:33] with us through the years I'm very
[45:36] thankful to have my children serving the
[45:37] Lord and I and I say this without any
[45:40] reservation it's nothing that mummy and
[45:42] I did it's it's totally His grace that
[45:45] has allowed us to be able to do that I'm
[45:48] glad our grandchildren are all in the
[45:50] church and serving the Lord of the best
[45:52] of their ability and now I got two
[45:54] great-grandchildren who are also who are
[45:57] also potential believers and are also
[46:01] gonna be tremendous even though the last
[46:06] names van Wyk they're gonna be
[46:07] tremendous it's okey dokey so that's the
[46:12] phrase for the day can you just
[46:13] coin that phrase got it back into my
[46:16] memory from eons of time as a goal
[46:18] alright so this will be a little
[46:21] difficult more difficult than what I
[46:23] thought too to be able to read this so
[46:25] you just bear with me no but we know
[46:27] that we know that life is not easy life
[46:33] can can sometimes dish up some pretty
[46:35] tough things and it's not always easy to
[46:39] be positive it's not always easy to just
[46:41] stay on top of things it's not always
[46:43] easy to to be happy when you're facing
[46:46] some of the trials and tests and some of
[46:49] the things that we go through in life
[46:50] you can offer some pretty some pretty
[46:53] rough
[46:54] territories and pretty rough things to
[46:56] do and even though we we you know we'll
[46:59] face sometimes situations and troubles
[47:02] and problems and things of that nature
[47:04] we always try to encourage people to to
[47:10] stay positive to keep the right attitude
[47:13] we're talking about it in the office
[47:14] with brother bill back there there's
[47:16] things that we can always complain about
[47:18] all of us there's always going to be
[47:21] something in our life that's not going
[47:22] to go the way we want it to go there's
[47:25] going to be situations and things arise
[47:27] that are gonna be trials and tests and
[47:29] in in in mountains or whatever you want
[47:32] to call it you say to this mountain
[47:33] there's always going to be things that
[47:35] are going to be hard for us at times to
[47:37] adapt to but we've got to try to keep a
[47:41] positive attitude other random said
[47:45] this little bride is never negative
[47:49] she's always positive brother if you're
[47:53] gonna light up here you were so sweet
[47:55] but I don't need it I'll get by with if
[47:58] it's gonna be a big problem you got you
[48:02] it's okey dokey we do things strange
[48:07] when I come around here so I remember I
[48:09] remember one time I forget where it was
[48:11] now I kept going to a church and their
[48:14] platform wasn't this high but it was I
[48:15] it was a huge step for me and didn't
[48:18] have a railing and they didn't have a
[48:19] step and I'd have to every Sunday I go
[48:22] they have to step up or win tonight and
[48:23] so I kept saying you know what I need I
[48:26] need a step down here guys I need a step
[48:28] down so and then I said because I doll
[48:30] just have to lean over on the piano it
[48:32] get up there like this and it was
[48:33] awkward so finally after years of saying
[48:37] I need I need so you never give up you
[48:39] always express your needs the brother
[48:43] him or his daughter I don't know who it
[48:45] was
[48:46] Oh give him a hand he just left every
[48:49] night oh my goodness my goodness had him
[48:58] up snowing I'm only kidding thank you
[49:02] brother
[49:02] I appreciate that so they got a step and
[49:05] and then they put a railing up there and
[49:07] and I don't go back there very much
[49:09] anymore because I don't travel that much
[49:11] anymore but they did do it and now what
[49:14] can I say this is so this beats putting
[49:17] the spotlight up there really because
[49:18] the only thing is it takes room up if
[49:21] brother Sam's got a big bunch of notes
[49:23] and stuff so but anyways so when we look
[49:27] at when we look at these things now as
[49:30] we try to zero in on a thought here for
[49:32] a little bit today when we face these
[49:35] things we want to try to encourage
[49:37] ourselves and in anybody else our
[49:40] honesty to stay positive when brother
[49:42] man that made that statement this little
[49:43] bride is never negative she's always
[49:45] positive I thought whoa how do you do
[49:47] that well it's it takes work it takes
[49:53] sacrifice it takes it takes being on top
[49:57] of your thoughts
[49:58] what are your thoughts come from when
[50:03] you're going through trials and tests
[50:04] and tribulations what is your thought
[50:08] header where's it at why me Lord or
[50:11] thank you Lord for an opportunity to
[50:13] serve you today that Lord whatever comes
[50:15] my way I know you're going to help me
[50:16] through it because he's the same
[50:18] yesterday today and forever and what
[50:20] he's done for others he'll do for me hey
[50:22] man
[50:23] because he's no respecter of person so
[50:26] it's not what's what our name is it's
[50:28] who we are as far as our relationship
[50:30] with the Lord Jesus Christ it has to
[50:34] stay the same so this little bride is
[50:36] never negative
[50:37] she's always positive no matter what
[50:41] we're going through and let me just say
[50:44] it like this no matter what the battle
[50:46] is no matter what the mountains are that
[50:49] we're facing there's a god that has the
[50:53] answer for us to every situation to
[50:56] every problem to every need that we're
[51:01] facing so it's not always easy to be
[51:08] positive but it's always beneficial
[51:12] because if you get under the
[51:15] circumstances they can weight you down
[51:18] pretty bad they can take away your joy
[51:22] they can take it away here happiness
[51:23] take away the the blessings that God has
[51:26] in store for you so we want to always
[51:29] try to keep a good attitude for the
[51:33] things of life and the circumstances of
[51:36] life and even though even though we mess
[51:38] up by everything that we make mistakes
[51:43] sometimes we say things we shouldn't say
[51:47] sometimes the pressure gets so great
[51:49] that things come out of our mouths that
[51:51] we were and you know what you can't you
[51:53] can't just reach back up and put them
[51:55] back in they're gone they're out there
[51:57] all we can do is repent later Lord sir
[51:59] I'm sorry Lord forgive me or if we've
[52:01] offended somebody ask your forgiveness
[52:04] because that's a good thing to do hello
[52:06] that's a good thing to do to be able to
[52:08] do things
[52:10] that way so as we're looking at this
[52:13] this morning and I know I was probably
[52:16] about 14 years old when I have an uncle
[52:20] I had an uncle he's gone now his name
[52:23] was Jim my Uncle Jim he was my mother's
[52:26] brother he came to me when I was about
[52:28] 14 years old just a young person and he
[52:32] looked at me one day and he said he said
[52:33] what are your goals for your life about
[52:37] 14 years old I'm just I'm just a kid I'm
[52:39] playing ball I'm enjoying life I've got
[52:42] all of my friends I had given my hearts
[52:45] of the Lord and an alter my life turned
[52:49] around I love the Lord with all my heart
[52:52] but here's my uncle standing in front of
[52:55] me saying what are your goals why
[52:57] immediately he responded with heavens my
[52:59] goal good answer right I thought so
[53:04] but he didn't he won the Christian he
[53:08] said no no I'm not that's not a goal
[53:10] that's not what I'm talking about it I
[53:11] didn't have a clue I had never had
[53:14] anybody asked me that question what are
[53:16] your goals and I was really dumbfounded
[53:20] when he said I I just said no no heavens
[53:23] Michael that's my I don't want anything
[53:25] else and I just want to go to heaven I
[53:28] didn't realize there would be like 70 65
[53:33] years in between then and now that I
[53:39] mean I'm still I'm in heavenly places at
[53:43] times not all the time but there's times
[53:47] that I've been heavenly places but but
[53:48] I'm not I'm not to that place yet where
[53:52] I'm what I would call in heaven so in
[53:58] the meantime he's saying what are your
[54:00] goals not not talking about heaven I'm
[54:03] talking about what are your goals here
[54:06] for you in this life well I didn't have
[54:15] any who at 14 has goals
[54:21] I want to be a professional baseball
[54:22] player because my grandfather was I
[54:25] wanted to be a good Christian because I
[54:33] believe that's what I was called to be
[54:37] but I didn't know what the future I
[54:39] didn't had any idea
[54:41] that's why immediately when I graduate
[54:43] from high school I went I went into the
[54:45] Air Force because I had no direction in
[54:48] my life no goals nothing said I guess I
[54:52] was just gonna I didn't know you know
[54:58] what it's gonna do so it was a challenge
[54:59] it was something different then what
[55:04] I've learned then later on in life I
[55:08] learned that if we don't set goals or
[55:14] set things down in our life that we want
[55:17] to accomplish then it becomes very
[55:21] difficult to really accomplish anything
[55:24] or go anywhere in life to make it ahead
[55:31] as we call we need things to look
[55:35] forward to without which life can become
[55:42] very hard and very miserable very
[55:46] mundane now as a believer we know
[55:50] heavens are our home and that's a good
[55:53] goal that's a good answer but it's 2019
[55:59] almost and we're not there yet we
[56:04] thought I thought I come up in this
[56:07] thing for a few years I thought 1977 was
[56:11] gonna be it when John Paul was born in
[56:15] 1966 I said he'll never go to school he
[56:22] did he graduate it took some college
[56:28] courses semester to
[56:32] he's 52 years old now my son who wasn't
[56:39] ever going to go to school is 52 years
[56:48] 1973 come around I knew a family you
[56:51] would know some of you if I called her
[56:53] name so I won't call her name but in
[56:56] 1973 they got rid of their rakes their
[56:58] holes their lawnmowers and everything
[57:00] because the calendar stopped in 77
[57:03] that's what somebody said wasn't gonna
[57:05] be anything past then so you count back
[57:08] three and a half years for the rapture
[57:11] the tribulation so we're gonna get out
[57:14] of here in 73 so they mmm got rid of
[57:17] this guy when visited them hardly had a
[57:19] chair set on outside I said what are you
[57:23] doing said well we're the raptures
[57:24] taking place
[57:25] we're getting out of here that was great
[57:28] I went back and visited them next year
[57:30] or two new whole new rake new lawn horse
[57:34] it didn't happen
[57:37] no they didn't do that because they
[57:39] wanted to be weirder abroad to be
[57:40] straight they did it because they really
[57:41] believed and it wanted to get out of
[57:43] here I want to get out of here I
[57:46] remember I was at an altar in 1977 I was
[57:49] at an altar on December the 31st on New
[57:52] Year's Eve at midnight and I was praying
[57:54] Lord Lord 77 the calendar said Lord get
[57:58] me out I'm still here you're still here
[58:05] we've got to deal with life we've got to
[58:08] live with it I believe we're going I
[58:11] believe it's going to happen I believe
[58:12] the time is coming but until it does
[58:14] we've got to deal with the here and now
[58:17] we've got to live a victorious life in
[58:22] this present world and what I went on to
[58:29] learn in life is that successful people
[58:34] set goals
[58:38] they do I didn't know that at the time I
[58:41] I had no idea that the things would be
[58:45] that headed and that that tough in life
[58:49] but now I realize it and I learned
[58:53] through these years that we must have
[58:56] the right attitude about things and we
[59:00] must be able to set goals and thoughts
[59:05] of our important things that we need to
[59:09] deal with now and in a near future in
[59:13] this life so I'd like to speak a little
[59:16] bit this okay am i doing okay everything
[59:21] okey dokey okay I'd like to speak just a
[59:24] little bit about about some of these
[59:26] things that I've you know encountered
[59:28] through the years and some thoughts and
[59:30] suggestions if I can do that to put down
[59:33] and so that's what I want to do this
[59:34] morning is just be able to do that and
[59:36] some of the things that were that I
[59:38] would call keys or that helped make us
[59:40] successful and happy and in this life he
[59:44] said in the text here and I were that we
[59:46] read in his word he said we need to
[59:49] speak to the mountain young man right
[59:53] here read it we need to speak to the
[59:58] mountain and my question to you this
[1:00:00] morning is what mountain
[1:00:01] are you facing this morning what
[1:00:05] mountain is standing before you
[1:00:06] personally this morning that looks like
[1:00:09] an insurmountable mountain it's so high
[1:00:15] in your life that there's just no way in
[1:00:17] your thoughts or mind that you're ever
[1:00:19] going to get over it it's so big and
[1:00:22] wide that you don't think you could ever
[1:00:23] get around it and it's so deep and so
[1:00:27] low down that you're never gonna be able
[1:00:29] to dig underneath it
[1:00:31] my question is what mountain or
[1:00:34] mountains are you facing this morning
[1:00:40] because we all have them in our lives
[1:00:47] from time to time something standing
[1:00:56] there and a problem a situation
[1:01:01] financial health-wise and it's standing
[1:01:06] in front of us and it's looking at us in
[1:01:08] the face and saying you're not gonna get
[1:01:12] past here and we look at in our human
[1:01:19] frailty and it looks like it may be
[1:01:24] right well I'm here to tell you this
[1:01:28] morning not only are we going to get
[1:01:32] past it not around it not a above it not
[1:01:38] under it not even just past it to where
[1:01:42] we look back and say there it is that's
[1:01:46] not what I'm looking at I don't want to
[1:01:48] just get past my problem I want it to be
[1:01:50] gone I want to speak like he said to the
[1:01:55] mountain and have it removed gone so
[1:02:06] that when I look around I can't find it
[1:02:08] anymore
[1:02:08] it's not there not just get over it or
[1:02:13] under around her or past it I want it
[1:02:16] gone because he said ye shall speak to
[1:02:23] the mountain
[1:02:27] these are removed and you're gonna have
[1:02:35] whatsoever you ask I don't know about
[1:02:40] you that's hard to come to comprehend
[1:02:43] but I believe it it ain't always easy it
[1:02:52] ain't always what it's cracked up to be
[1:02:58] sometimes because those mountains of
[1:03:02] cancer those mountains of health
[1:03:06] problems
[1:03:07] those mountains of finances those
[1:03:10] mountains of family problems
[1:03:13] those mountains of spiritual walks can
[1:03:18] get pretty high pretty big but they're
[1:03:22] not higher and they're not bigger than
[1:03:24] my God is and he said this too shall
[1:03:31] pass
[1:03:34] glory to God I'm not gonna preach I'm
[1:03:40] just talkin is it okay so we've got to
[1:03:47] learn to believe that we have the power
[1:03:56] over those mountains that God has placed
[1:04:06] within us the answer and the solutions
[1:04:15] to overcome those things remember the
[1:04:20] promise in every age was to him that
[1:04:23] overcometh
[1:04:28] not just get around it I just put it off
[1:04:35] and not just but overcome it amen
[1:04:43] so I'm talking with you this morning and
[1:04:49] I'm and I want to talk about these
[1:04:53] problems in these mountains that's in
[1:04:58] your life standing in your face pointing
[1:04:59] its finger at you and saying you're not
[1:05:05] gonna get around here it's discouraging
[1:05:09] you but I'm here to tell you this
[1:05:13] morning you can't overcome it you can
[1:05:19] rise above it you can speak to it and
[1:05:22] move it because in you is creative power
[1:05:28] as a believer to speak to that mountain
[1:05:37] I know a prophet one time that said you
[1:05:42] have the power to speak a world into
[1:05:45] existence and to go live on it you said
[1:05:51] in every believer is that power no the
[1:05:56] thing is I don't need to go live on I
[1:05:58] don't need to live in another world I
[1:05:59] live in this world but you have the same
[1:06:03] power the power that can speak a world
[1:06:05] into existence can speak a mountain out
[1:06:08] of existence and he's gonna do it for
[1:06:14] whoever you are no matter how young you
[1:06:20] are no matter how weak you may feel how
[1:06:23] insignificant you may feel I'm here to
[1:06:26] tell you this morning God is still God
[1:06:30] and he's still in the throne he's still
[1:06:32] able to speak through you
[1:06:41] and perform flat-out miracles every once
[1:06:51] in a while in my life I get the faith
[1:06:58] raised in my heart to believe for those
[1:07:01] things I'm praying it'll stay all the
[1:07:06] time but every once in a while I'll
[1:07:07] reach that plateau of faith in my life
[1:07:09] when I speak and I need God to do
[1:07:13] something and he comes on the scene he
[1:07:20] does it whether it's the weather or a
[1:07:26] situation or need my family's a brother
[1:07:33] a sister somewhere the church every once
[1:07:40] in a while I can get to that place that
[1:07:43] there's enough faith in my heart that I
[1:07:44] can speak with that confidence God I
[1:07:47] need you to do this I want this to
[1:07:52] happen Lord let it happen father in
[1:07:55] Jesus name because I want everything
[1:07:58] according to the will of God not in my
[1:08:00] will it's not what I can do it's what he
[1:08:03] can do and I've seen him come time after
[1:08:09] time when I get to those places and I've
[1:08:12] seen him do it
[1:08:13] I mean miracle after miracle I've
[1:08:16] watched him perform it and I have
[1:08:19] perfect confidence this morning that he
[1:08:23] is more than able to do what he said he
[1:08:30] would do you say you speak to it you say
[1:08:36] it's going to be gone you have goals you
[1:08:40] said you got to speak them and set them
[1:08:44] into existence
[1:08:46] let it be Lord this is what I want
[1:08:50] father I want this to happen your mind
[1:09:01] is a master computer if we really knew
[1:09:08] the truth about our minds we only use a
[1:09:11] small portion of them science will tell
[1:09:15] you there's so many things up here that
[1:09:17] never get touched in our life because we
[1:09:20] just don't realize what we've got
[1:09:22] setting up here
[1:09:22] I remember when computers first came out
[1:09:25] they would take up a city block or more
[1:09:29] remember that people giant things and
[1:09:32] they'd feed cards into them and
[1:09:33] information into him but you're mine now
[1:09:35] God has placed within you a master
[1:09:38] computer but it's like other computers
[1:09:42] out here all the way from the city block
[1:09:47] long to the little iPad little Lou
[1:09:49] iPhone to the human mind
[1:09:55] it can only your computer can only deal
[1:10:00] with the information that's been
[1:10:03] downloaded onto it whether it's an app
[1:10:08] or whether it's from Apple and they did
[1:10:11] it to begin with and they put all this
[1:10:12] what you put into it is what you get out
[1:10:14] of it hello and it's the same with your
[1:10:20] mind you download things into that on a
[1:10:26] daily basis sometimes sometimes on an
[1:10:29] hourly basis and what you put in is what
[1:10:32] you get out if you if you download a
[1:10:34] bunch of negative stuff in there you're
[1:10:35] going to get a bunch of negativity out
[1:10:38] hello this is not rocket science if you
[1:10:43] download positive things in there
[1:10:44] chances are you're going to get positive
[1:10:46] things out of there but it's what you
[1:10:48] put in and no deposit no return you've
[1:10:54] heard that before
[1:10:58] so you've got this master computer in
[1:11:03] your mind and let me let me just help
[1:11:07] you a little bit when you download
[1:11:11] things like I can't
[1:11:16] that's impossible for me to do it'll
[1:11:21] never work I've known people who have
[1:11:25] tried it and I've never seen anybody be
[1:11:29] able to do it so I know it ain't gonna
[1:11:32] work and you're downloading all the time
[1:11:36] you're saying those things because death
[1:11:39] and life are in the power of the tongue
[1:11:41] so a proverb says what you speak is what
[1:11:44] you get whoa that changes things so here
[1:11:52] you are your your downloading your
[1:11:55] computer can't impossible won't ain't
[1:11:58] can't work never work not for me and
[1:12:02] your computer goes and it shuts down
[1:12:10] it's just out so no matter what you're
[1:12:15] trying to get now you've told it it
[1:12:17] ain't gonna work but lord I need this to
[1:12:21] happen and this to happen but your
[1:12:22] computer says nothing here to work with
[1:12:29] but by the same token if you put the
[1:12:33] right things in I remember one time our
[1:12:38] house was on fire
[1:12:40] we came home with Church on a Wednesday
[1:12:42] night came in the house turned all the
[1:12:44] lights on went in the living room then
[1:12:46] all of a sudden we we smell smoke
[1:12:48] I loved it and it was coming up the
[1:12:50] stairs to the basement our basement had
[1:12:53] a fire in it that the firemen found out
[1:12:56] from the light switch he went down
[1:12:57] through the wall in a car basement fire
[1:12:58] and I didn't know whether we called the
[1:13:03] neighbor they called the fire department
[1:13:04] or we're new new to the place we don't
[1:13:06] need to live there a few months and and
[1:13:08] so we were rendered - so all I call I
[1:13:10] all I knew to do is pray fire is one of
[1:13:13] the worst things you can deal with
[1:13:14] because there's not a whole lot you can
[1:13:16] do with it unless you're a fireman and
[1:13:17] know what to do
[1:13:18] and they say wants you if you got a fire
[1:13:21] you don't want to open windows and doors
[1:13:22] well we painting because we had just
[1:13:24] bought a we didn't buck leave we bought
[1:13:27] a mixing board we had a concert in three
[1:13:30] days and we had all of our equipment in
[1:13:32] the bedroom so I told the kids get mom
[1:13:35] and dad get mom and again and Sharon and
[1:13:37] any I got a house and go get the
[1:13:39] equipment in the bedroom under the bed
[1:13:41] was a they start pulling equipment I'll
[1:13:43] drink hell and I go around I'm gonna
[1:13:45] they say don't if you got a fire don't
[1:13:47] over like keep the window in the
[1:13:49] basement I got the little hose I wait
[1:13:54] for the fire I don't hear the fire track
[1:13:56] and I know better to do that so finally
[1:14:00] I realized I said I this thing to work
[1:14:01] so I stood back there and I just simply
[1:14:03] said god I don't know how you're going
[1:14:06] to do it but you need to put this fire
[1:14:09] out within three minutes four minutes
[1:14:14] the fire department showed up but the
[1:14:17] fire was out before they got there
[1:14:23] you know what he did something that he
[1:14:27] can't do
[1:14:29] he caused one of the one of the seams in
[1:14:33] the pipe that had been what do they do
[1:14:37] when they what soldered and that's not
[1:14:42] supposed to give somehow the heat of
[1:14:45] that fire melted that solder and it
[1:14:47] broke the pipe in in the water spewed
[1:14:49] out and put the fire out he can do
[1:14:58] whatever he wants to do I don't know how
[1:15:05] you gonna do a little bit somehow you
[1:15:06] need to put this fire out he's come and
[1:15:14] said what you do what you do I prayed I
[1:15:17] I don't know what you shouldn't cook the
[1:15:19] window in and now you tell me God can do
[1:15:26] it but your master computer when you put
[1:15:31] the right things in there I can I will I
[1:15:36] am going to do this I want this to
[1:15:41] happen Lord and I want it to happen this
[1:15:43] way and scholars school people teachers
[1:15:48] tell us it's better if you write things
[1:15:50] down because it helps you remember
[1:15:53] better and it's got a stronger positive
[1:15:55] attitude so when you compute things into
[1:16:00] that computer I can I will it's going to
[1:16:03] work I know it's going to happen I
[1:16:04] believe it's going to happen that
[1:16:06] computer of yours wakes out it boots up
[1:16:09] brutal okey dokey and it goes to work to
[1:16:19] find ways to make it happen
[1:16:25] it does all of a sudden thoughts start
[1:16:29] coming to you I could have been standing
[1:16:32] in here forever you know what it never
[1:16:36] worked
[1:16:38] but the thought came to me speak the
[1:16:42] word and I did it it worked sometimes
[1:16:49] it's much to my amazement Lord going to
[1:16:55] a preacher revival one time I was
[1:16:57] driving in snow that was so treacherous
[1:16:59] we shouldn't man or beast shouldn't have
[1:17:01] been out there and it was gonna cancel
[1:17:03] the whole meeting just not even started
[1:17:05] yet and I said god caused the snow storm
[1:17:09] to stop in Jesus name I pulled off the
[1:17:13] road and I sent there a few minutes and
[1:17:18] it quit it had been predicted he was
[1:17:24] appearing in our it been predicted to
[1:17:26] come from how long what's going to
[1:17:29] bother Johnson's sometimes it surprises
[1:17:36] me sometimes I forget that I've asked
[1:17:41] and things happen and I I said wait a
[1:17:43] minute
[1:17:44] I asked for this and here it is because
[1:17:53] I dared to be different I dared to trust
[1:17:56] him I dared to believe him I dared to
[1:17:58] have confidence that God would hear my
[1:18:02] prayers and be able to do it because I
[1:18:07] spoke the word and it came to pass you
[1:18:13] say well you you you you can't do that
[1:18:18] that's impossible
[1:18:19] no one's ever done that before let me
[1:18:20] let me just say excuse me I'm not no one
[1:18:26] I'm not anyone I'm a child of God I'm a
[1:18:32] believer I'm Holy Ghost field I have the
[1:18:37] power in the name of Jesus I've got the
[1:18:44] power in the name of the Lord though
[1:18:51] Satan rages I forgot the words I will
[1:18:57] not be defeated I've got the power in
[1:19:05] the name of the law and we forget that
[1:19:13] because it's hard to remember that when
[1:19:16] the mountains standing here looking down
[1:19:19] on you I don't know the story like I
[1:19:26] should has been so long but it was one
[1:19:28] of the church age messengers that got
[1:19:32] woke up in the middle of night with a
[1:19:34] bad presence in his room and I remember
[1:19:38] as a young Christian I used to have
[1:19:40] times like that things were startled me
[1:19:42] and wake me and I'd have battles with
[1:19:43] Satan and somebody remember who it is I
[1:19:48] can't remember which messenger it was
[1:19:50] but he was startled he woke up and Satan
[1:19:52] was sitting down at the end of his bed
[1:19:54] and he looked at him you said oh it's
[1:19:58] just you he turned over and went back to
[1:19:59] sleep
[1:20:01] yeah it means that we've got the power
[1:20:08] over anything he wants to try can you
[1:20:16] believe it I can it will I do believe
[1:20:22] hmm it can only compute what you put
[1:20:27] into a church now when I look that word
[1:20:33] Mountain you should say to
[1:20:36] to the mountain when I looked at that
[1:20:39] word mountain in in in in the Greek one
[1:20:42] of the one of the definitions in the
[1:20:44] Greek was robinia ribbon is Rab bi n IE
[1:20:50] Rubini
[1:20:51] and it means to remove mountains and
[1:20:59] it's okay it's okay to go around it it's
[1:21:03] okay to go over it's okay to dig under
[1:21:06] it but I'd rather remove it I'd rather
[1:21:12] the thing be gone not not look back say
[1:21:14] ho you know I came through that and
[1:21:16] inspect it no I don't even want a part
[1:21:19] of my life I don't want part of my
[1:21:21] memory I want it gone so we speak to
[1:21:27] those mountains God has delivered you
[1:21:34] and even though you're a human being and
[1:21:36] you got problems Church troubles
[1:21:38] troubles but you're also the child of
[1:21:42] God and you have the power I'm here to
[1:21:47] tell you this morning

[1:21:54] to speak those things out of existence
[1:22:03] as a matter of fact one of the
[1:22:05] definitions Mountain one of them said to
[1:22:09] accomplish the most difficult stupendous

[1:26:39] that day ye shall receive that word
[1:26:43] receive means to hold on to to take
[1:26:45] possession of and to take upon oneself
[1:26:50] to possess it so when my Uncle Jim said
[1:26:55] butch cuz that's my nickname you know
[1:26:58] that they're butch what's your goals you
[1:27:03] just wiped me out but you know what I
[1:27:04] found out through the years I found out
[1:27:08] successful people our goal setters they
[1:27:14] make plans they dream up ideas they ask
[1:27:19] their employees and their think tanks
[1:27:20] and what do you think what do we want to
[1:27:25] be a year from now and they'll have
[1:27:27] meetings together with their leadership
[1:27:29] and they'll meet on a continuous basis
[1:27:33] through the year and they'll have these
[1:27:36] these sessions where they'll solve
[1:27:40] problems some of them deal with
[1:27:42] situations but they'll dream they'll
[1:27:46] have goals and they'll set their goals
[1:27:48] this is where we want to be one year
[1:27:49] from now this is where we want to be ten
[1:27:51] years from now this is where we want to
[1:27:52] be 20 years from now this is what I'm
[1:27:54] saying this is my vision and without a
[1:27:58] vision people perish you've got to have
[1:28:02] a vision so you can step into vision and
[1:28:04] step into the vision and step into the
[1:28:05] vision and see God do those things and
[1:28:09] when he does it gets exciting you get
[1:28:12] you get really excited and you get built
[1:28:15] up and it'll give you confidence that he
[1:28:19] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:28:23] I think it's one of other berry coffees
[1:28:27] Suns at works works for the White House
[1:28:30] he doesn't work in the White House but
[1:28:32] he's got a he is in there a lot but they
[1:28:35] got a little building right beside the
[1:28:36] White House and they have a they have a
[1:28:37] think a think tank I guess is were they
[1:28:41] they have a group of guys get together
[1:28:44] and they're constantly problem-solving
[1:28:47] the things that are going on in the
[1:28:49] world situations and things and they're
[1:28:50] constantly in their everyday and and and
[1:28:53] and they're figuring out answers to
[1:28:55] problems and they're figuring out
[1:28:56] solution and they're figuring out ideas
[1:28:58] and what are we gonna do with this and
[1:29:00] how what about this list list and you
[1:29:02] know present that to the president
[1:29:04] on a daily basis or a weekly basis I
[1:29:07] don't know and they'll they'll present
[1:29:08] their ideas and their solutions and her
[1:29:10] thoughts but it's progressive you got to
[1:29:13] have something moving in your life to
[1:29:16] keep you vibrated and keep you alive and
[1:29:18] keep you moving and keep you motivated
[1:29:20] it keeps it going the same of the church
[1:29:22] without a vision it'll perish that's why
[1:29:26] I go to church as our family goes they
[1:29:27] go and sing at churches and some of
[1:29:29] these older churches all there is as old
[1:29:31] people and because they got no vision
[1:29:33] all the young people have left or
[1:29:36] growing up and and out there anymore
[1:29:38] they're not they're not coming in there
[1:29:39] because they're there's no dreaming
[1:29:41] there's no goals there's no future
[1:29:44] don't let that happen in your life in
[1:29:47] your family in your church dream
[1:29:49] think big remember that's the first book
[1:29:54] I ever read
[1:29:54] when I joined Amway mmm that dirty word
[1:29:58] called anyway well I didn't just join it
[1:30:02] once I joined it about four times
[1:30:03] through the years I think one time I
[1:30:06] didn't know it was that way and I joined
[1:30:07] kids but but anyways the first book I
[1:30:10] ever read was the magic of thinking big
[1:30:15] but you know what it opened my eyes
[1:30:19] horizon it opened my mind to think in
[1:30:24] ways I had never thought before and I
[1:30:28] applied some of those principles and
[1:30:30] then I read the Zig Ziglar book I'll see
[1:30:33] you at the top
[1:30:35] and I was sitting down here in the
[1:30:37] bottom saying you're gonna see me up
[1:30:38] there Zeke but I learned to dream I
[1:30:45] learned to believe I learned that if we
[1:30:50] don't plan for it if we don't dream for
[1:30:58] it if we don't set goals for it then
[1:31:01] there's a real good chance we'll never
[1:31:04] get it because if you got nothing
[1:31:12] planned then nothing comes from it
[1:31:17] unless Satan gets into the fix you've
[1:31:23] got to have direction you got to know
[1:31:26] where you want to be and what you want
[1:31:29] because there's too many outside voices
[1:31:32] it's not going to keep you going
[1:31:35] there's five things and I'm gonna
[1:31:37] mention these and then I'm gonna wind it
[1:31:39] down to close here very soon there's
[1:31:42] five little things in life that I've
[1:31:44] found that we need and this is just mean
[1:31:49] I was talking from my heart to you the
[1:31:52] number one thing I think we need is to
[1:31:54] have we teach the young people when they
[1:32:00] go to camp we have four years you need
[1:32:02] to feed your experience number one God
[1:32:06] has done something for you in your life
[1:32:08] and he's blessed you ities he's maybe
[1:32:10] you went to a camp and gave your heart
[1:32:12] to the Lord maybe God has given you the
[1:32:14] Holy Ghost maybe something but you've
[1:32:16] got to feed that experience you got to
[1:32:19] keep it fresh and keep it going read
[1:32:21] your Bible every day we've heard that
[1:32:23] before and pray we need to to do what
[1:32:27] God said let me give you a verse of
[1:32:28] scriptures you want to turn with me over
[1:32:29] to I think it's over in 1st Corinthians
[1:32:33] 11:3 at 16 and I'm gonna read from verse
[1:32:37] 15
[1:32:38] first Corinthians 16 15 and I love this
[1:32:42] I love this scripture here
[1:32:44] but we got to have some kind of
[1:32:48] experience that we're working on or
[1:32:50] feeding
[1:32:52] first Corinthians 16 15 I beseech you
[1:32:55] brethren you know the house of stephanas
[1:33:00] that it is the firstfruits of a kea and
[1:33:04] that they have addicted themselves to
[1:33:10] the ministry of the saints
[1:33:13] they have addicted themselves we always
[1:33:18] think of an addiction as a bad thing but
[1:33:21] here's a good addition they've addicted
[1:33:25] himself to the Ministry of the Saints
[1:33:26] and in verse 16 he goes on to say that
[1:33:28] ye submit yourselves unto such and to
[1:33:35] every one that believeth with us help us
[1:33:37] with us and labour us so we want you to
[1:33:41] do this he wants you to do this Paul
[1:33:44] said
[1:33:45] to addictive feed your experience we
[1:33:52] need to do that when we come to church
[1:33:53] we walk out the door we hear a Gospel
[1:33:55] message which is the the breath of God
[1:33:58] the life of God speaking to us we walk
[1:33:59] out the door we don't want to forget it
[1:34:02] we don't want to let it go
[1:34:04] talked about everything else in the
[1:34:05] weather and everything else we want to
[1:34:07] remember that and we want to feed on
[1:34:09] that want to dick tower selves to it
[1:34:11] because it's it's the Word of Life that
[1:34:13] we're talking about the second thing I
[1:34:16] think we need to do is we need to have
[1:34:18] the right attitude toward things because
[1:34:20] the wrong attitude breeds a negativity
[1:34:23] the right attitude brings positiveness
[1:34:26] in the message called the principles of
[1:34:29] divine healing the Prophet makes this
[1:34:33] statement he said the right mental
[1:34:35] attitude toward any divine promise we'll
[1:34:38] bring it to pass
[1:34:41] he goes on to say if you're a sinner
[1:34:44] confess your sin and believe and after a
[1:34:50] while you'll be a Christian why cuz you
[1:34:57] believe you see it ain't that simple yes
[1:35:03] it is because how many has never heard
[1:35:08] the statement you are what you eat if
[1:35:13] you eat junk food you become junk eat
[1:35:18] healthy you become healthy hey Jay right
[1:35:22] where you are what you think the
[1:35:27] computer as a man thinketh so is e hello
[1:35:36] so we are what we think as well so we
[1:35:39] want to think the right things we want
[1:35:41] to have the right attitude toward things
[1:35:49] because I'm talking about Jesus Christ
[1:35:51] is a high priest of our confession he is
[1:35:55] what we confess him to be in other words
[1:36:02] God is only as big as you will let him
[1:36:04] be come on now
[1:36:09] he is only as powerful as you were
[1:36:13] letting me because as a man thinketh in
[1:36:19] his heart so is he
[1:36:24] we know with us we can't do those things
[1:36:28] but with God all things are possible
[1:36:31] nothing can stop him and you need to
[1:36:34] know that that's who you're serving
[1:36:38] another another message called who is
[1:36:42] God it was preached right here over here
[1:36:43] in Cleveland he said god I love this
[1:36:47] quote God will make your body obey your
[1:36:52] confession oh do I love that quote I
[1:37:00] love it like you don't know how I love
[1:37:02] it when I found that quote I was sharing
[1:37:06] at one time and Billy Paul we were
[1:37:07] talking I was Billy Paul Branham he says
[1:37:09] he said I love that that's my favorite
[1:37:11] quote the other people told me that I
[1:37:13] said fine too now your God will make
[1:37:19] your body obey your confession and my
[1:37:24] confession is and I've said it for years
[1:37:26] I only weigh 175 pounds when I left
[1:37:34] Arkansas and moved back here to Ohio 15
[1:37:39] 18 years ago now I don't remember when I
[1:37:42] left there but the bill I weighed 300
[1:37:45] plus pounds
[1:37:46] I weighed myself two days ago I weighed
[1:37:51] 226 pounds that's over 70 pounds I've
[1:37:57] lost in the last 15 years and you know
[1:38:02] why because I keep saying I only weigh
[1:38:05] 175 pounds I've lost over 30 pounds in
[1:38:11] the last four to five months you see
[1:38:17] look John that all you got to do brother
[1:38:22] can keep say I mean how you how you
[1:38:23] doing hey that's what you have to do the
[1:38:28] loss I had to have a lot of willpower I
[1:38:33] had to convince myself that those things
[1:38:36] probably don't taste good anyways
[1:38:38] although they're drooling with sugar hey
[1:38:47] he gets sick enough
[1:38:53] God will make your body obey your
[1:38:56] confession and I want to go on record
[1:38:59] here this morning again I want to go on
[1:39:03] record again I'm healed of prostate
[1:39:08] cancer totally completely healed of
[1:39:12] prostate cancer because he said with his
[1:39:18] stripes we were healed he said it in the
[1:39:21] Old Testament and Peter said in a New
[1:39:23] Testament by His stripes we were here
[1:39:28] said in the Old Testament I stripes you
[1:39:31] are healed New Testament by straights we
[1:39:33] were healed and I believe that though
[1:39:35] I've got symptoms though I have a doctor
[1:39:39] standing in telling me this is happening
[1:39:42] and this is happening and this is where
[1:39:43] you're at in your PSA is this and I'm
[1:39:45] healed
[1:39:46] I stand here confessing it with
[1:39:49] everything inside of me by the in the
[1:39:51] name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth I'm
[1:39:53] healed a prostate cancer and I believe
[1:39:59] it with everything inside of me all
[1:40:04] these symptoms nothing but Lyon vanities
[1:40:08] and this too shall pass
[1:40:16] if you thought I look good at 300 pounds
[1:40:19] just wait I would when I graduated from
[1:40:28] high school I weighed 255 pounds
[1:40:30] 155 not 55 lord have mercy 155 pounds I
[1:40:36] went in the Air Force two years in the
[1:40:39] Air Force when I got to the Air Force I
[1:40:41] weighed 175 pounds two years after I got
[1:40:46] out of the Air Force I got I got married
[1:40:48] to sister Loretta I got I weighed 200
[1:40:50] pounds when I got married so I'm going
[1:40:51] from 155 175 200 pounds
[1:40:56] after marriage I don't know what
[1:40:59] happened I do too I do too sister
[1:41:04] Loretta came from a family she had eight
[1:41:05] brothers and two sisters
[1:41:07] we're 11 children in the family and two
[1:41:09] adults when she cooked she cooked for
[1:41:13] all those people when we got married two
[1:41:17] of us she cooked for all those people my
[1:41:22] mother was very conservative
[1:41:24] she said cleaning up your plates I don't
[1:41:27] want any leftovers so I'm looking at the
[1:41:31] first meal sister Loretta fixed for us
[1:41:33] mac and cheese this bowl two of us to
[1:41:43] this day it's hard for me to eat mac and
[1:41:45] cheese we ate it for one week we had it
[1:41:48] for two weeks but that's my story and
[1:41:53] I'm sticking to it
[1:41:57] by His grace by His grace in a message
[1:42:09] called manifestation of the Spirit
[1:42:11] preached over here in Toledo he said he
[1:42:17] can do nothing until you confess it
[1:42:22] first so you're not gonna have any goals
[1:42:28] or any accomplishments until you speak
[1:42:30] it if you don't confess it then you're
[1:42:36] not gonna possess it my theory if you
[1:42:44] don't confess it good chances are you're
[1:42:46] not going to possess it you've got to
[1:42:49] speak the word learn to speak the word
[1:42:53] don't be afraid of speaking the word and
[1:42:55] if you want to get a little more
[1:42:57] confidence with it write it down write
[1:43:01] it down if it's weight loss stick it on
[1:43:05] the fridge door I weigh 175 pounds and
[1:43:13] all this good stuff in here
[1:43:15] probably don't taste good anyways I have
[1:43:22] to confess I get weak sometimes but then
[1:43:28] I remember sugar feeds cancer and that's
[1:43:34] in the equation too well I guess I can
[1:43:39] only have a little bit of sugar how bad
[1:43:43] do you want it how bad do you want your
[1:43:47] goals how bad you want your dreams learn
[1:43:49] to write them down learn to keep me
[1:43:51] going I'm gonna end here a real world
[1:43:53] quick you know you getting something out
[1:43:54] of this now you said if you confess me
[1:43:57] before men this is what he said now
[1:44:00] manifestation of the Spirit you confess
[1:44:04] me before men I'll confess you before my
[1:44:07] father what you say down here I have
[1:44:11] done for you that's what I say the
[1:44:14] father that I have done for you
[1:44:17] what you say down here in other words
[1:44:20] that I've done for you I'll say it to
[1:44:23] the Father up there if you say down here
[1:44:26] I'm saved
[1:44:28] he says up there he's saved I'm healed
[1:44:34] he's healed
[1:44:37] I'm delivered he's delivered I got big
[1:44:40] trick
[1:44:41] he's got victory I'm going to heaven
[1:44:43] he's going to him I'm in the breath he's
[1:44:44] in the ride what you say down here I'll
[1:44:47] say up there the power of the spoken
[1:44:51] word hey you got to keep it going Church
[1:45:02] number three thing I think we need to do
[1:45:04] is check our motive constantly well
[1:45:08] Branham said it in a message called
[1:45:09] power transformation 1965 he said always
[1:45:12] check your motive and objective and see
[1:45:15] if it's according to the Word of God if
[1:45:17] it isn't leave it alone
[1:45:24] your motive in your objective what have
[1:45:30] you have the right motive but your
[1:45:33] objectives wrong what if you got the
[1:45:38] right objective but it's not according
[1:45:40] to the word those things don't work
[1:45:44] check your motive
[1:45:45] check your objective and make sure it's
[1:45:49] in line with the word the fourth thing I
[1:45:54] want to mention that I think is a great
[1:45:56] thing to adapt to is learn to speak and
[1:45:59] use your authority you possess the power
[1:46:04] of the spoken word
[1:46:10] the prophet of God said we are living a
[1:46:13] thousand or thousands of mile below our
[1:46:16] privileges
[1:46:17] everybody thought about the brains never
[1:46:19] even hardly ever used most of it it's
[1:46:22] the same with our faith we live so far
[1:46:26] below our privileges because we don't
[1:46:28] exercise what God has given us come on
[1:46:32] now you know what's the truth Church
[1:46:36] ever-present water from the rock he said
[1:46:38] and Jeff he said you have the power to
[1:46:41] create a world and go live on it that's
[1:46:49] why I like to see our young people go to
[1:46:50] camps and stay around I taught my I
[1:46:54] taught my kids growing up I said you
[1:46:55] stay around positive people positive
[1:46:58] people will help you
[1:46:59] negative people will hurt you you got a
[1:47:02] neck of it attitude you it'll hurt you
[1:47:03] it hurts your friends it'll hurt your
[1:47:05] church can even destroy you and your
[1:47:09] friends and your church the last thing I
[1:47:14] want to mention here and this part of it
[1:47:15] is you need to be create your own
[1:47:19] atmosphere as they did an act to you in
[1:47:22] the upper room and that must fear for
[1:47:26] birth that's what we do here
[1:47:27] we're walking them indoors we create an
[1:47:30] atmosphere we do that with our song
[1:47:32] service we do that with our worship
[1:47:33] what are we creating an atmosphere so
[1:47:36] that when the word comes they'll be such
[1:47:40] an atmosphere here that births can come
[1:47:42] forth from it it's all about atmosphere
[1:47:47] when it comes to hatching a chicken out
[1:47:49] they said well you got to set a chicken
[1:47:51] under the hen if it's going to hand out
[1:47:53] no you don't you just got to have the
[1:47:54] right atmosphere the right light the
[1:47:56] right heat right sensitivity we walk
[1:48:01] through them doors back there our whole
[1:48:02] purpose our whole attitude are holding I
[1:48:04] ought to be creating an atmosphere so
[1:48:07] somebody can step into it and find a new
[1:48:09] birth
[1:48:10] find divine healing find deliverance fun
[1:48:14] victory find joy find happiness so that
[1:48:19] when you go out you don't go out the
[1:48:21] same way you came in
[1:48:23] hey man I hope you got something out of
[1:48:27] this today I hope you got something out
[1:48:31] of it today Church now I'm gonna give
[1:48:34] you about three keys before we end this
[1:48:38] I'm gonna give you about three what I
[1:48:42] call keys to our family our family la
[1:48:44] Fontaine's and these are things that
[1:48:51] that we adopted through the years three
[1:48:55] major keys that I think has helped our
[1:48:58] family stay together by the grace of God
[1:49:04] it's only him because we have our
[1:49:06] problems
[1:49:07] we're not perfect we're not a hundred
[1:49:11] percent where we should be all the time
[1:49:13] we have problems but we've learned to
[1:49:17] deal with them we've learned to sit down
[1:49:18] we learn to talk about them key number
[1:49:23] one to our family into what I think
[1:49:25] would be helpful key number one is that
[1:49:30] we had family devotions just about every
[1:49:35] night except for Wednesday nights when
[1:49:38] there was church then and a lot of times
[1:49:40] on Sunday when we had to services but
[1:49:43] five four to five nights for sure strong
[1:49:46] every week we would have family
[1:49:49] devotions would call them DeVos I
[1:49:53] remember going through the house many
[1:49:56] times saying time for DeVos time for
[1:49:58] DeVos I had to yell upstairs and
[1:50:00] downstairs and everybody knew the family
[1:50:03] knew when it comes time for devotions it
[1:50:05] was time to drop everything we're doing
[1:50:06] we usually did it about an hour before
[1:50:08] bedtime
[1:50:09] every night we'd come into the living
[1:50:12] room
[1:50:12] bring our Bibles and we sit down and
[1:50:15] we'd read a scripture now devotions to a
[1:50:19] lot of people mean different things I
[1:50:21] didn't put a tape on all the Prophet and
[1:50:24] let the kids fall asleep on the couch
[1:50:25] listening to it
[1:50:26] I didn't think that would be productive
[1:50:29] I didn't preach my Sunday sermon to him
[1:50:31] hoping that they'd get saved before I
[1:50:34] got to church we would read a scripture
[1:50:37] maybe a chapter every night and I'd have
[1:50:44] different people read I did I read mama
[1:50:47] read Paul reg here in red
[1:50:48] Isaac read Sheree couldn't read she
[1:50:52] wouldn't even ear in some of the early
[1:50:53] days but we would read the scripture and
[1:50:57] then we'd sit around and we'd talk about
[1:50:58] a little bit and then we'd take prayer
[1:51:03] requests who has a pervert quest tonight
[1:51:05] we've got something going to pray for
[1:51:07] and in each individual night different
[1:51:10] ones would pray or those requests and
[1:51:13] then many times we'd sit around and
[1:51:17] either talk about the scriptures that we
[1:51:19] read or or just talk sitting in a
[1:51:23] controlled atmosphere living room
[1:51:24] talking about things in life and what
[1:51:27] happened to stay in just our lives and I
[1:51:31] saw the Holy Spirit just settled our
[1:51:33] home down when we went off to bed there
[1:51:35] was peace in the house it was a
[1:51:38] wonderful thing that was the first thing
[1:51:42] we did I learned that from a quote that
[1:51:47] brother Branham said he was talking
[1:51:48] about chaos in the home and he said he
[1:51:51] made a statement he said are you ready
[1:51:53] are you ready to put the family altar
[1:51:55] back in your home buddy that hit me like
[1:51:59] a ton of bricks
[1:52:01] you know one of the hardest things to do
[1:52:03] is pray with your family don't you ever
[1:52:06] notice that before but especially if
[1:52:08] it's just you and Mom or you and one
[1:52:11] child or something but it's so
[1:52:13] productive it's so needed second key
[1:52:18] that I want to mention and I'm closing
[1:52:19] with these keys by the way I'll give you
[1:52:21] a few testimonies mean I'll close second
[1:52:25] thing that we adopted and I adopted this
[1:52:27] from a man who was my boss his name was
[1:52:30] mr. Taggart man he owned he owned the
[1:52:33] gas station a large gas station in Ann
[1:52:36] Arbor Taggart shell and every Monday
[1:52:40] night mr. Tager would have a gripe
[1:52:44] session for his employees at his house
[1:52:46] and all the employees would go to his
[1:52:49] house on Monday nights I learned this
[1:52:52] from him and one guy would stay at the
[1:52:55] station and keep the station running or
[1:52:57] two and on that in that grape session we
[1:53:01] were everyone would talk about what
[1:53:03] bothered them that week where things
[1:53:06] were where things went well what things
[1:53:07] didn't go well any suggestions we had or
[1:53:10] ideas we had how we can improve things
[1:53:12] and we get everything out talked about
[1:53:14] and it was worked for a good atmosphere
[1:53:15] and I thought you know what I'm gonna do
[1:53:18] that in my home so every Monday night in
[1:53:22] my home I adopted from mr. Taggart
[1:53:26] a great session that's what I called it
[1:53:30] Monday night gripe sessions what we did
[1:53:34] was we establish this rule though all
[1:53:37] through the week and weekend nobody
[1:53:42] could argue with anybody nobody could
[1:53:46] fight with anybody we had to save it for
[1:53:51] the grape session it did two things
[1:53:56] number one it brought it to a controlled
[1:53:59] atmosphere so there wasn't a bunch of
[1:54:00] nonsense going on
[1:54:02] number too many times I saw hearts
[1:54:06] touched lives turned around and
[1:54:10] confessions and apologies made
[1:54:13] but most of the time I saw this now what
[1:54:18] was it you were started to argue about I
[1:54:21] don't remember
[1:54:23] cuz it wasn't worth remember but mother
[1:54:27] had another rule she put with that she
[1:54:31] had the jar rule mother came from a home
[1:54:37] there was a little bit eight brothers
[1:54:42] different I don't want you feeling sorry
[1:54:45] for her because I had eight
[1:54:46] brother-in-law's I had to treat her
[1:54:50] right okay mother had a jar she set out
[1:54:53] in that house she said I don't want
[1:54:56] anybody arguing with anybody take it to
[1:55:00] the grape session if I hear it you got
[1:55:04] to put twenty-five cents in the jar I
[1:55:07] don't know how many times that jar
[1:55:09] filled up I don't know what happened to
[1:55:10] that jar my wife could be a rich woman
[1:55:14] right now and I wouldn't even know it
[1:55:19] but you know what Billie worked it was a
[1:55:23] wonderful thing and we'd I'd seen times
[1:55:25] we'd hug and fast I I'm sorry I didn't
[1:55:28] know that hurts you now the person that
[1:55:30] had the most things to say when we
[1:55:32] started that was Ike he was like four
[1:55:36] years old we started in a feel for time
[1:55:37] full-time in he's a doubt pal he hit me
[1:55:41] and I didn't and in cells all night
[1:55:46] it'll be all right now he's a fine young
[1:55:50] man got a wonderful family I tell you
[1:55:52] his kids are just unbelievable and
[1:55:54] they're unbelievable but it worked I'm
[1:55:57] not trying you have to do these things
[1:55:58] I'm not telling you that be good to have
[1:56:00] devotions but this worked for us I'm
[1:56:04] just telling you what worked for our
[1:56:05] family the third and last thing that I
[1:56:07] want to mention on this is we had every
[1:56:11] New Year's Eve ever January we had what
[1:56:15] I call dream night what we call dream
[1:56:19] night and we we still have it
[1:56:21] I learned this like I said from Amway
[1:56:24] all the leadership would get together
[1:56:25] and have a meal on New Year's Eve and
[1:56:28] they have dream night we'd set our goals
[1:56:30] for the year and for the month and so we
[1:56:32] did that where we set our goals and
[1:56:34] establish our goals long term short term
[1:56:37] spiritual goals natural goals physical
[1:56:41] goals financial goals whatever we wander
[1:56:43] right down
[1:56:44] everyone in the family from from the
[1:56:47] least to the to the oldest it started
[1:56:51] with Ike back then and then share he
[1:56:52] come along and she started in up to and
[1:56:54] we would write down our goals and put
[1:56:58] them on a piece of paper and put them
[1:57:00] away for the year we will go around the
[1:57:03] room a lot of times and say what's your
[1:57:05] goal and we'd read our goals from each
[1:57:06] other because we wanted each other know
[1:57:08] what we're praying about what our desire
[1:57:10] was
[1:57:12] the Bible said like I said in Proverbs
[1:57:14] 29:18 where there's no vision the people
[1:57:18] perish and I remember I brought first
[1:57:24] year I did this back home until Edel
[1:57:26] there for the church
[1:57:28] I brought little Stevie up Stevie's 12
[1:57:32] years old now going on 21 and you know
[1:57:36] that is so I brought him up front of the
[1:57:39] church and I said Stevie I want you to
[1:57:40] take this imaginary gun he's a good
[1:57:47] hunter and I said now when I tell you to
[1:57:51] Stevie I want you to aim back here and I
[1:57:53] want you to hit the bullseye I said okay
[1:57:58] he said okay he's going along with me I
[1:58:01] said all right Stevie I said go ahead
[1:58:04] hit the bullseye knee raise that gun I
[1:58:06] said what are you doing he said you told
[1:58:09] me hit the bullseye I said but where's
[1:58:12] the bullseye he said I don't know I said
[1:58:18] how you gonna hit it if you don't know
[1:58:20] if you don't have a target you don't
[1:58:24] have anything to hit if you don't have a
[1:58:27] goal you don't have anywhere to go so
[1:58:33] it's important that you learn to set
[1:58:39] goals
[1:58:44] and that's my sermon for the day however
[1:58:50] I'd like to read a few goals that our
[1:58:53] family has had through the years I'll
[1:58:56] start with my daughter Sharon remember
[1:59:04] where she put four different things
[1:59:06] these are some of the goals that Sharon
[1:59:09] has had through the years one of the
[1:59:12] first ones I remember she remembers well
[1:59:14] was when she was 12 years old we were
[1:59:17] writing out our goals that night food
[1:59:18] for dream night and one of her goals
[1:59:21] that she put down she was she was seven
[1:59:23] years old I'm sorry she was seven years
[1:59:25] old she wrote this down
[1:59:29] I want a little redheaded sister
[1:59:40] I immediately rebuked her said that's
[1:59:45] not a goal that's just wishful thinking
[1:59:50] but she kept it on paper when she was 12
[1:59:59] on October the 25th 1979 Cheri was born
[2:00:05] a little redheaded caboose these are
[2:00:14] some of her other dreams and let me just
[2:00:16] say this on the onset so I don't have to
[2:00:18] say it every time all of these things
[2:00:20] have been met by our family for our
[2:00:23] family
[2:00:24] she had a desire to record a solo album
[2:00:27] she wrote it at age 12 she recorded it
[2:00:30] at age 14 a solo album by Carrie Sharon
[2:00:35] she wanted to start a newspaper for
[2:00:37] young people call it youthquake news it
[2:00:40] happened but you wanted to start some
[2:00:44] Sunday school programs for the church
[2:00:46] see now it does kids days and whatever
[2:00:49] else she want to have a baby get to on
[2:00:56] ever own music studio even wrote down
[2:00:59] what you want to call it fountain Music
[2:01:01] Academy it came to pass
[2:01:04] wanna have a grand piano I remember
[2:01:06] seeing at least two or three in her
[2:01:07] house before at one time and the new
[2:01:11] mission work twice now they've been to
[2:01:14] the phillipines once they've been doing
[2:01:15] some Bob way
[2:01:17] in a new and Wilma I remember Paul's
[2:01:21] Paul's for a long time said I my dream
[2:01:24] is to go to Arizona for the special
[2:01:26] meeting sometime
[2:01:27] and I remember Paulie did I didn't have
[2:01:30] two dimes to rub together to give him I
[2:01:33] wanted him to school so bad but I said
[2:01:35] Paul you just got to pray you got to
[2:01:37] believe you got to pray you got to
[2:01:39] believe and so they the day come for the
[2:01:40] meetings to start there was no way for
[2:01:42] him to go he just looked at me and said
[2:01:45] well dad he said I guess God doesn't
[2:01:47] want me to go I said I don't know you
[2:01:48] just keep praying that was a dream goal
[2:01:53] that day when he went to school I went
[2:01:58] to the mailbox in the mailbox I can't
[2:02:02] remember the exact funds but I believe
[2:02:04] it was a thousand dollar check from a
[2:02:07] minister I didn't even know who wrote
[2:02:12] and said brother John I felt led to send
[2:02:15] this to you people love your ministry
[2:02:17] all over and we appreciate you and I
[2:02:20] always try to pay some extra ties the
[2:02:22] end of the year this is an offering for
[2:02:25] you I went to the bank I cashed the
[2:02:29] check I went to the triple-a I got the
[2:02:32] ticket
[2:02:34] he came home that night I said come here
[2:02:37] Paul and I handed in a ticket for his
[2:02:41] flight to Arizona
[2:02:42] he missed the first service that night
[2:02:47] the next day he flew out to the meeting
[2:02:51] because he dreamed it was a desire of
[2:02:55] his heart whatsoever things you desire
[2:02:58] when you pray believe that you receive
[2:03:00] them and you shall have them these are
[2:03:06] some other things
[2:03:08] Paul said he had a desire to be singing
[2:03:11] a group a desire to buy a car as first
[2:03:14] car he bought was a Volvo
[2:03:15] hmm you ought to read the Bible all the
[2:03:19] way through he doesn't anyone to listen
[2:03:20] to every message and sermon that was
[2:03:25] available in I think he's done that
[2:03:28] Isaac on the other hand he was a real
[2:03:31] dreamer he wanted to travel and play
[2:03:33] with a group he's done that on different
[2:03:36] occasions with our family with a group
[2:03:39] called the tackett's he's even he's even
[2:03:43] gotten as far as playing the grand piano
[2:03:47] on the Grand Ole Opry stage for a group
[2:03:50] while they were singing said oh he said
[2:03:56] I mind his ire dad he wrote it down he
[2:03:58] said I want to record an album project
[2:04:01] and I want to I want to play all the
[2:04:05] instruments on it and record it
[2:04:13] you know what cost for studios recording
[2:04:16] Oh another thing he said I'd like to
[2:04:22] have a studio in my god he did and he
[2:04:26] recorded and he played all the
[2:04:28] instruments and it was good it was it
[2:04:33] wasn't just okey-dokey it was good all
[2:04:37] right back then now back then now though
[2:04:41] I'm going way back when he was young you
[2:04:42] wanted to gain weight I think it's
[2:04:45] always trying to be different than the
[2:04:46] rest of the world well all the world
[2:04:48] wants to lose weight he want to get now
[2:04:49] he wants to lose it he gained it and now
[2:04:52] he wants to lose it when sherry came
[2:04:56] along these are some of her goals and
[2:04:58] let me say they've all came to pass
[2:05:00] maybe except that tall dark handsome guy
[2:05:04] with she said I want to travel and sing
[2:05:12] with the group she went with the Arnolds
[2:05:15] on the road four years in a row saying
[2:05:17] with all the major groups that are in
[2:05:18] gospel music just about every one of
[2:05:20] them she wrote down one year she wanted
[2:05:23] to go to Paris she went she said I want
[2:05:26] to sing on stage at a Bill Gaither
[2:05:30] Homecoming not asking much this little
[2:05:38] kid of mine redheaded caboose
[2:05:41] so we pack up as a family we go all the
[2:05:44] way to Tulsa Oklahoma as the Arnold's
[2:05:47] the group she was singing with it's on
[2:05:48] stage for the homecoming that night
[2:05:50] singing on a Bill Gaither stage I got
[2:05:52] pictures of her ever give her this year
[2:05:54] of her with with all the leading people
[2:05:56] sitting around singing on the stage and
[2:05:59] she came down off the stage and she I
[2:06:00] said well what's next sherry she said I
[2:06:04] want to be on a homecoming video
[2:06:08] so before that concert was over that
[2:06:10] night Bill Gaither had come to the
[2:06:13] Arnold's and said I want you guys on the
[2:06:14] next taping so they went to the next
[2:06:17] tape and they sang on it and she was on
[2:06:19] she's on to other videos not singing but
[2:06:21] she's in the audience I'm to other
[2:06:23] videos and singing with the homecoming
[2:06:25] artists that ain't nothing to us you
[2:06:29] know people that don't sing I'm a
[2:06:32] crooner but it was everything to that
[2:06:34] little girl when she wrote those dreams
[2:06:38] down those goals down and God answer
[2:06:39] done you don't think that gave her
[2:06:41] confidence she said I'd like to have my
[2:06:45] own apartment she wrote these things
[2:06:46] down I'd like to buy my own car I'd like
[2:06:49] to do a solo project
[2:06:50] Jeff Easter produced it for her I'd like
[2:06:53] to do a Christmas CD she's got a
[2:06:56] wonderful Christmas CD out and the
[2:06:59] burger produced her second CD that was
[2:07:02] out and then Henry came into our family
[2:07:06] oh Henry
[2:07:13] first time he ever came to a dream night
[2:07:15] with our family when chairman Sheeran
[2:07:18] got married first time he wrote down
[2:07:21] these things I would like to record some
[2:07:25] of my songs that I've written that year
[2:07:33] the CD the tape influenced the first
[2:07:38] influenced album came out that year with
[2:07:41] just the kids on it this real
[2:07:45] one of the dreams he's had through the
[2:07:47] years is I want to have a house in the
[2:07:48] country he's got a beautiful house in
[2:07:50] the country now I don't have any car
[2:07:53] payments if you know Henry he'll drive a
[2:07:56] rattletrap put baling wire on it and do
[2:08:01] everything you can but you don't know
[2:08:02] car payments you don't have enough house
[2:08:05] payments he said I want to be debt-free
[2:08:11] he went to the bank here a while to go
[2:08:14] to get see how his credit was cuz him
[2:08:16] and his daughter and his wife are gonna
[2:08:17] start buying and flipping homes that's
[2:08:19] 30 days higher now stop working for
[2:08:21] everybody else and work for themselves
[2:08:23] so he goes to the bank he's not had
[2:08:25] credit and empty number of years he's
[2:08:28] never got anything no credit established
[2:08:32] so he goes to the bank and finds out
[2:08:35] he's got a better credit rating than I
[2:08:38] do then Paul does in all of us go figure
[2:08:44] the last thing he said on his list that
[2:08:47] I knew of anyways I don't know what he
[2:08:48] wrote last year and here before said I'd
[2:08:50] like to have a tailor guitar I guess
[2:08:52] that's a real nice guitar tailor mom
[2:08:56] well he's had two of them my first one
[2:08:59] he had for years 15 years broke and now
[2:09:03] they told him said we'll we'll replace
[2:09:05] it we'll replace it free we'll give it
[2:09:08] or if you want to upgrade we'll give you
[2:09:10] an upgrade and you just pay the
[2:09:11] difference
[2:09:13] well he wanted an upgrade when the dust
[2:09:16] settled they fixed it said take it back
[2:09:18] doesn't work it didn't work so they come
[2:09:21] back and he said I want this upgrade
[2:09:22] well before he got to the store to buy
[2:09:25] the upgrade and pay the difference
[2:09:27] somebody anonymous had slipped a check
[2:09:30] to Sharon and said whatever the upgrade
[2:09:32] cost here's the check pay for it then
[2:09:36] Sharon and Vanessa bought a little
[2:09:38] attachment you put on it that amplifies
[2:09:41] it so it's got no cords to it and he's
[2:09:47] good I wanted to go full-time in the
[2:09:52] ministry I wrote that down the years we
