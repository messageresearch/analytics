it's good to have you here amen just trust you just feel at home in the presence of the lord and i also want to remind you just to be very prayerful in the meetings that we have coming up here two weekends from from this weekend here on memorial day weekend brother andrew glover the lord willing will be ministry and we want you just to be very prayerful and i'm asking you as a congregation uh when we have when god has meetings that he places and when he places things on our heart that's for you that's for you it's for all of us we want to anything that we we receive from god is going to need to be an investment when we invest in these things through prayer and being here in the services to really draw because let me just say this to you the things of this life are typical they will flee away not just at the time of the rapture there's things right now that maybe this past week was your bulk trash you set some stuff out that at one time meant a lot to you or maybe you drop some stuff off it good will salvation army one time it meant a lot to you it's temple but the things of god are eternal amen these are the things and the times in this hour that we receive strength from el shaddai he's he just knows exactly what you and i have need of you know it's a very purposeful a very purposeful time and i believe every time that we come to the house of god i think what god has brought us through even in this past year it brings us to a reality of not to take one moment for granted amen not one moment for granted i was praying this morning not only praying and received different texts and things like that from india and other places just different ones requesting prayer and i thought lord here on one side we're there going through this just just sweeping through there then i thought lord here we have just right up to the north of us here a country and you'd never it never imagined because it's supposed to be a free democratic society but instead where they are standing against churches and closing them down we're not ignorant of satan's devices this is why we we must have eyes to see beyond all these things that's taking place and not get caught up in the things of this earth there's an agenda that's taking place are you with me i'm not being political right now not at all if that's what you're thinking you're way off board i'm not at all i'm saying right now when you see such things that are taking place there are brothers and sisters that would give their front teeth to be in the house of god there in canada they don't have a choice i say for everything that we have we've got to stand with different ones down through the ages of the hebrew children with those who were there in the time of the outpouring of the holy ghost there in pentecost we've got to stand there and stand with them as overcomers if we're going to stand there we have to stand as overcomers they never had it easy no i feel like i'm preaching already and i ain't even in my subject they didn't have it easy they had to persevere they had to go through many different circumstances and persevere but what was them that what was it that motivated them through all of that the love of god that was in their heart see the love of god will always places us in a place to say lord i trust you even when i don't understand it i trust you and i'm looking to you may we make every opportunity may we make it count every moment but we give everything that we've got we're in the final moments of this race we're here it's not we're arriving we've arrived we're at that time we're at a moment where it's time to give everything you've got amen there's been a pacing that's been going on now it's time to really the finish line is in sight it's time to run through the finish line god is faithful amen he sees us through he's seen us through and he'll see us through his faith i don't amen if i even need to preach nothing god is good amen let's just let's just stand if we could and let's just look to the look to the author here this morning we just want to invite him he's here and we just want to invite him personally to us our seat to where we are to our needs he knows exactly what we have need of and that's what you come here you didn't come here to hear me you've come to hear from him that's what you've come for i trust that's what you've come for we need to hear from god amen we need to hear from you heavenly father lord how we we thank you for your mercy once again this morning lord as the scriptures would be expressed lord that god your faithfulness your mercies they are new every morning lord we're thankful god for the privilege that we have thankful for the opportunity lord oh god we just lord are so so confident you're in control we just ask right now lord in this moment that lord jesus as you're here we just want to invite you lord god that you had come lord to our seat you would come to where we're at lord you would come minister to the needs in our lives lord your god has studied meditating lord just things lord throughout the time and just waiting on you i'm counting on you lord who gave the direction lord lord that you'll just come and you'll just speak your word to our hearts may you come and just break the bread lord minister to lives in a very personal way heal those that are sick lord oh god may the lord be lord a saving lord of souls may your spirit lord just be poured out god into hungry vessels father we just invite you this morning lord have your way in this service now in the name of jesus christ amen and amen amen amen let's turn in john chapter 19 verse 30. you're saying i so enjoyed that special mr beckham that's awesome that was just great i really enjoyed those words amen enjoyed the anointing that was with me [Music] amen i'm assuming you you wrote that song you didn't write it well you sang it like you really enjoyed that john 19 verse 30 when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the goals may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i want to just continue with looking at this thought and there's just so many different points within it but that of the finisher and i'm sure that many of you here just like myself sometimes there's things that we've started on our own house projects and other things and they're still there they haven't been finished they've been starving sometimes there's things that we get in and we underestimate the job we get to looking at it sometimes we finished it but we've underestimated the time it's going to take well this is only going to be a few hours or this is just going to be a few days then there's some unexpected things that happen in between all of that that we didn't account for that causes us to sometimes if i can say this get frustrated because it wasn't in our plans we didn't plan for this we didn't plan for them to be out of these screws we didn't plan you know what i'm saying but that's not so with god and to remember that our lives is not our own work it's his work so when we consider this of of the finish here as we break into this this view on calvary where now the very life is leaving the body and here he utters out the very words to declare it is finished what work that he was commissioned and given to do to declare god to declare his righteousness to declare his loving kindness to pay the very price that was needed in order for redemption now when it was uttered out it is finished the price has been paid but now what what what where here in this earthly realm those words are uttered out and there's many even of his closest disciples that they didn't understand it they didn't know what was taking place but even after here where they find the euro here of the body and hear the expiring there on the cross where from a life that was fully surrendered but he went on accomplishing his work now he descends into into hell itself and he descends in there bearing the load the weight the guilt of the sin of the world every sin that would ever be every attribute he bore the sin the all of it into the very lowest parts of hell you see what he's doing he's taking it back to who it belongs to because sin my mind does not belong to the believer sin does not belong to a son and daughter of god sin belongs back on the one who in the beginning brought all of this about who was a perverter so now he's he's taking it right back to where it belongs there's a conquering that's going on down there beyond the earthly realms beyond what the disciples and the rest of them are even aware of what's taking place and i want to say it to you like this that when we think of and we express the coming of the lord this has been uh that which has been looked for all the way through the old testament it's been prophesied of the coming of the lord think of where the disciples would ask the lord jesus is it at this time that you will restore the kingdom unto israel but you see what was not known in that time is there was going to be a gentile dispensation that god was going to take a people for his namesake although it was hidden types yet things were also expressed very vividly in the old testament but you see god has a way of making things that he's expressed become vivid or become clear and that is only at that appointed time and to who it is that it's given to understand at that moment so it's not if we can say it like this it's not given for you and i nor do we have to press our way or to try to pry into anything all we have to do is yield to god i always think of you know as it's been said it's not the three pushes it's the three pulls so if there's a pull then what it requires is just a yielding in our lives it's god who draws us unto himself so the coming of the lord which is an event that has been unfolding even right down to the present hour that we're living in and i want to just just say it in this manner peter would pick it up in first peter verse 1 or chapter 1 and verse 18 and here peter is speaking to the jews that have been scattered about as strangers into among gentile lambs and he says for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers see they were keeping the law they were offering the sacrifices all that god had given them to do at the time but remember the law could make nothing perfect so he's letting them know there was something greater nothing of of silver and gold that that was given that was corruptable but your redemption here it is purchased now as he goes on by the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot so you know what he's letting him know this is sure this is sure there's things that are corruptable but this is incorruptible who verily look at this verse here who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you he's bringing it down the manifestation of that lamb now offering up his life it was done with you in mind this was before the foundation of the world amen it's all an unfolding of things that are taking place here who by him do believe in god that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in god in revelations 13 8 here here it picks up regarding that worship that this is an end time scripture an end time scripture is speaking of that worship to that beast that image of the beast and it speaks here and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world that's what i want to focus on this was already this was something that already took place in the mind of god what we just read about here even in john 19 30 it was a part of that plan being unfolded but the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world before there was an atom molecule before there was ever an angel the lamb was slain from the foundation of the world samuel what are you saying that redemption is sure it was already finished before there was ever even a beginning hallelujah isaiah himself when you would read of this you know when you find in isaiah 53 hear isaiah being a prophet and a prophet himself is caught up that was god has placed in his life he's caught up into that realm of the word you see there's a realm that's much greater than the realm that you and i walk in we walk in this timeline matter and all of this around here but there's another realm that's much greater and isaiah is caught up into this this realm he's caught into the realm of the word where when you read in isaiah 53 you read it he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him you know you can read through isaiah it's not wrong writ as though it's a future tense it's wrote as a past tense happening because in god's mind the lamb was slain it was all settled right there in the mind of god it was god's thoughts and so now it's a plan of god that's being unfolded even in this very moment in our midst in our lives oh my no wonder jesus could say blessed are your ears that hear and your eyes that see i tell you for every believer that's lived down through the ages they can declare that in their age but let me say this to you how much greater in the hour we're living in we're living in a time where it's a finishing up of this work of redemption it's a closing hour we're seeing that moment this is what the prophets themselves were waiting on when they were caught up and they would express these things as in the book of isaiah jeremiah on and on yet they would come back down the word was spoken and their lives would be lived and go on for hundreds and and hundreds of years before many things would just start taking place and happening but you and i are not living in the hour where promises are being made this is not the hour of promises being made this is the hour of the god who made the promises coming to fulfill them [Applause] this is where we're at hallelujah isaiah was transported up in that realm of the word what isaiah caught he was in tune to be able to hear what god already said you see a prophet is not uttering his own thoughts he's caught up into the thoughts of god and it's god's thoughts that are being uttered out are you with me so when we see this here let me just say it to you like this and and that be he purposed god himself before there was ever a man he already had a plan before there was anybody lost he already had a cross this is it's already it's tied up that's right god came according to the word he'll never come outside of his word he'll always work according to that here in luke 24 where you find the disciples they're walking along and hear the bible let's just pick into let's just move into this conversation in verse 25 and he steps out and he says to them all fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken so he's letting them know first of all there's things that has been spoken that you've been slow to believe right they believed a lot of things but there's other things you've been slow to believe ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning in moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself i find this to be in this in this portion of scripture how brother branham would take this in christ the mystery and he's he's bringing this out to us and he's talking you know he's declaring in this message of why i've done what i've done all the days here at the tabernacle why the message that i stood to stood for and preached and proclaimed all these decisions and he says now he says what i want to do is he reads this in luke 24 and he says now i'm going to take the entire bible for my text because we're living in a time of the finish but i want you to catch some things here that's very personal brother brown tells us how that jesus he steps out as we read here and he steps out and begins to converse with them now when he comes to them they're sad they're weeping they're discouraged and they don't know what's taking place but there is word that's already been spoken it's been fulfilled and they didn't know it's been fulfilled they didn't even realize what was taking place but here they are in this moment walking with sadness brother braham says it like this he says and they were going along and they looked upon the account of his death and how they seen him suffer for what they had thought was of no value at all i wonder how many times in our lives remember things that we start and then things that are finished i wonder how many times that even in the life's journey in god working in our lives i wonder how many times that we've looked at tests or trials or happenings and we've looked at things to maybe be well this is no value at all but god has been working the whole time he's a god that even when they themselves thought this is of no value what they didn't recognize the greatest event besides that of where god and man were joined together there at the river jordan but now on the on calvary the price has been paid and been offered up they were not even aware of that great event this is a fulfillment of the word they were not even aware of the great event i hope you're hearing me they were not even aware of the great event at that moment that they were actually a part of they had no idea that what they thought was of no value was a great event that this very thing taking place of the price of redemption and now his resurrection it would lead to the outpouring of the holy ghost and it continues on it leads you and i into a place of the body change of the rapture it leads on to the millennium it leads on to the future hope it keeps on going amen and yet many things that were taking place this is why when paul would write many times if we step back and bring it into our own lives that many of the times that we are not even aware or not even thinking in this way but the tests and trials that come our way they are foreordained of almighty god when peter could stand there in the book of acts he let him know that that you have taken the prince of life and with wicked hands have crucified him but he said i want you to know he was delivered unto you by the determinate counsel of the almighty god amen that even this that was taking place that thing was no value at all god was working his plan was being fulfilled let me just tell you something god's word it cannot be stopped amen and the tests and trials that god in his infinite wisdom allows to come our way they've got a purpose many times in a test and trial god as it comes to you and i our humanity pulls back but that's the time when the god part on the inside will stand in the midst of that hour even when you don't feel like or think you've got enough faith but it's not based on your thoughts about things greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world [Applause] it's not your faith that's overcoming the world it's god's faith inside of you that's overcoming the world you might look around and wonder how am i still standing it's because there's one who stood for you and now the same one is [Applause] [Music] paul said the dying of the lord jesus in our body that his life might be made manifest in our own life let me just say this to you that doesn't mean whereas intestinal trials that we take sicknesses and we just take them and we here we are we just you know line ourselves up like a velcro target and say go ahead devil just keep on attacking it on me but it's it's a time to where you realize tests and trials come but we're standing there upon the word and know what god has declared by his stripes i'm already healed i don't care what we feel like that has nothing to do with the word of god amen we stand on god's word regardless this is what god has said and then the devil wants to hand you something hand it right back to it you don't have to take it or accept it you can hand it right back to you amen [Music] hello glory be to god let me i gotta move on here but there are things that come up i'm sure when we look at these situations that take place even in the fulfillment of the word god laying out the prophecy of his word there are things that in some of these instances that that may be with some of these believers they wouldn't they wouldn't have chosen the pathway joseph wouldn't have been chosen to throw be thrown in a pit right he wasn't chosen all these years to be away from his father that wasn't his choosing it was god's plan i'm not going to preach on that this morning but wonder how many times that joseph lay there in prison thinking what value is this but god was working on joseph and god then was going to work on the other end god is arranging everything perfectly to where when joseph could stand there at that moment he could say what you meant for evil he never tried to hide it never tried to mince words with him but he let him know that's what you meant for evil but god meant it for good god was in control all along when you threw me in the pit god was there when i was sold to the ishmaelite bandits god was there women put me there in the prison god was there when i was in potiphar's house god was there are you hearing me god was with him i wonder how many times he felt like god was with him sure there's a lot of times he didn't feel like god was with him but joseph had come to this realization that through it all god has done it for a purpose the bible says for prayer for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost so all of the all of the acts as we've looked at the acts even there were those who would speak the word there were words that were spoken as isaiah would express that word as we looked at last week behold a virgin shall conceive caught beyond his own senses and to for a word to be uttered like this but it wasn't isaiah's word it was god's word it's god that came on the scene to fulfill it at the appointed time but in the lives of other believers they didn't speak but their lives spoke it was the same holy spirit that would pick up the prophets and they would speak as they were moved by god that same holy spirit is the same one who moved upon rebecca it's the same holy spirit that moved upon esther it's the same holy spirit that moved upon tamar it's the same holy spirit that moved upon rehab it's the same holy spirit that though they did not speak prophecy but their lives spoke prophecy of an end-time people of a bride that would come to maturity it was prophecy that was going forth out of their lives the acts of the believer declares this and you know they fulfilled their part they fulfilled it and they fulfilled it by the inspiration of the holy spirit that come to him i want you to look at this here is elijah speaking to job in the midst of job's times of tests and trials now remember all the all the older men have been there and elihu had uh given them honor and now here you know all that conversation and where it's when but here's where elijah steps forward and he expresses to job i said days should speak multitude of years should teach wisdom but there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the almighty giveth them understanding now there's times it's true that wisdom it cometh with age even the bible will talk about the whorehead the gray hair and things like that for those that have it it would speak of that about the times of wisdom but you know as well as i do there are people older how do i say this they ain't got to lick more wisdom than nothing right right you're with me yeah i mean it's like you know they're they're they're still you know well let me just move on from that so it isn't necessarily that age itself speaks of wisdom this is what ella who is standing around and he's watching this and he recognizes it's not that of age that's actually helping job but now the spirit of god see god is mindful even of job going through his test and his trial job doesn't know what's taking place he doesn't know what's happening job doesn't he's not aware what's taking place and how's this going to come out you see he knows by being a prophet there's got to be an outworking there's a purpose he's trying to find that but you see god has hid it from him but now the inspiration of the almighty and now it's going to speak to job it's god who gives inspiration and i'm telling you this here it's god that gives you and i inspiration and understanding it's his inspiration that gives peace to our lives it's his inspiration that gives direction and guidance and leadership he goes on and says the spirit of god hath made me and the breath the inspiration of the almighty hath given me life let me just say this you are ordained and anointed to finish ordained and anointed to finish god already saw him as a finished work hallelujah where they have walked when the bible speaks of the old testament saints they walked through deserts the bible says wandered in sheepskins clothed here they were as outcasts of the world but yet the world wasn't even worthy of them they lived out their purpose their life under the inspiration of almighty god i hope you understand what i'm saying i'm not talking about inspiration where you've got a good feeling and you walk out and and it's no and here people just continue on i'm talking about the inspiration that sets our lives in motion it's where god himself comes down and it's god now who begins to express his word through our lives it's what is already there and inspiration comes upon that word look at this in hebrews 1. god who at sundried times and in diverse manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets half in these last days spoken unto us by his son the word whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high so what was uttered it is finished the conquering went on then he ascends up there seated at the right hand and we understand he sat down in the throne with the father is that right now here's a corporal body there on the throne yeah are you with me because jesus is not an iron boy he's not a second person it's not he's not you know an old man with a hand out here and here the sun climbs up on that right hand signifies power and authority yeah amen amen so with that power and authority there's nothing that has been able to stop god's program from coming forward and there's nothing going to stop it from being fulfilled are you with me the devil all through the old testament he wanted to try to hinder that he tried to get at him wanted to stone the prophets wanted to take them out but what the dumb devil didn't realize is you can kill this body but you can't kill the life and when when god was finished with this vessel this one on earth then god called them home they might have been taken out of the earth in a way that would seem very ear uh disrespect and things like that but god was calling them home their lives had been their purpose had been fulfilled the expression whether they spoke it here or they lived that out here it had been fulfilled and god called them home after their part had been served and the devil couldn't stop it man he could not stop it he wanted to stratus he came at it in every way and you know what he knows he can't stop it but that doesn't keep him from trying he'd like to make you think that he can stop you [Applause] i said he'd like to make you think that but it's not you it's not you it's god if it would have been up to me or you we'd have gave up a long time ago but god cannot be stopped [Applause] he upholded upholds all things by the word of his power amen i know science can have all of this and you know they got this and well this is spinning here in this planet here and this star here and this here and this here and this here but all the figurings out is not what holds it in place it's god you want to put your law of physics and everything else my point is is that who was the one who said it and then just happen to allow a canary brain to tap into it come on now just a few scriptures here just just pressed on my heart to read these i don't have these up there but i'm just going to read them here it speaks in psalms 37 the arms of the wicked shall be broken but the lord upholdeth the righteous amen the lord knoweth the days of the upright and their inheritance shall be forever they shall not be ashamed in the evil time and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied psalms 37 23 the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he delighteth in his ways though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand what are you saying brother samuel that we are upheld with the word of his power it's god that's holding everything right where it needs to be there's not one thing that can even make an encroachment or anything at all it's held right there by the word of his power our lives are upheld by the word of his power glory be to god in the highest think of this this word i want you to think of this here as we read on in this scripture and thou lord hebrews 1 10 and thou lord in the beginning has laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the works of thine hands they shall perish but thou remainest and they all shall wax old as doth a garment and as a vesture shout thou fold them up and they shall be changed but thou art the same and thy years shall not fail a lot of things can change everything here upon the face of this earth when fallen the when sin entered the fall came then death sets in is that right fear sets in where animals and hiding and all those things now becomes prey and predatory is that right before that time it was not praying predator amen are you with me well just to show you in the in the millennium when it says the lion will lay down by the lamb the lion is not going to have them big old teeth it will eat straw amen that's scripture hey listen if that line he got his teeth yanked out that changed i'm talking about the line that are laid down in the millennium hey look god took the bite out of our lives too you might as well preach with me he took the bite out of some of some of our lives is that right amen and brought a real peace into our life because we were so we couldn't even get along with ourselves much less with anybody else amen are you with me it's not it's not not a miracle he'll bring that change about he's brought a change in our nature the same god and rather change in our nature it will bring a change to the atoms of these bodies is that right though the earth and how the world itself growing old and notice like a garment a garment is something that's on the outside is the outer covering but what remains the same is thou o lord amen his word cannot change that's who he is amen amen it cannot be changed think about from where we're coming hear from the mind of god where here god here was the word it cannot change even after god has spoken it he didn't speak something different from himself he was only expressing the thoughts of himself notice matthew chapter 5 verse 17 think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets i am not come to destroy but to fulfill for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled i want you to think of this just for a moment jesus went deeper than just words all right amen the word had to be fulfilled is that right but in order for the word to be fulfilled he brings it into a jot and tunnel which is an accent mark i don't know about you but when i was teaching school i had to learn with some of the names i had to learn accent marks yeah and you know what i had i butchered some things up i'd write it out right there write it out so i'd have to so i know how to say that particular name or whatever sometimes it went into difficult names it's just that's just the things that were accent marks they meant to express this or express that or do this you see what god is saying here is that even the expression of that word which it must in order to be fulfilled it must be expressed according to his thought so even that expression of it the way of just that little accent mark in order for that to be expressed it takes god who gave the word coming on the scene and into our lives to express that word because the word cannot be changed the word cannot be altered the word is to be fulfilled and to hear god comes on the scene to fulfill that word to express that word and it's the inspiration of almighty god coming in the manifestation of his word that's what brings a real son and daughter of god out in our life it now it's no longer it's not just a word but now it's an expressed word it's got the accent on it it's got the real expression of what was in god's thinking amen now when you look at this here think back to in genesis 1 because when we look at even in our life and keeping that thought in mind of the finisher you often in genesis 1 and the very first verse in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth period brown will pick that up and he points this out to us in the message power transformation and he points out to us of god's objective that he's had to bring this to pass he said many people have taken these first chapters of genesis and they are saying as though god is repeating himself but he said in actuality when god spoke it it was finished now listen to me now it was spoken when god said let there be light and there wasn't any light there wasn't nothing yet but his word was declared true amen are you with me now his word was declared there wasn't a light the old world was still floating in the darkness covered over with water but you see he had spoke his word then that's what he was speaking brother goes on to speak about how it goes in genesis 1 26 when god formed man in his own image in his own likeness in the image of god maybe him male and female he said see he was he was making man he just spoke the word and he goes on to say now maybe he said it was hundreds of years after that and there was still no man to till the soil but he says see god had spoke the word and then the word had to take place when god said something he said let there be he says there might have been hundreds of years before it ever came to pass but it had to come to pass it couldn't fail it was what was once now in god's mind has now been expressed it's been spoken amen amen and when god speaks it this is where as his children we can rest upon his word to know that what god has said he won't take it back i don't care what kind of conditions arise are you hearing me i don't care what situations arise in this world it doesn't matter god doesn't alter his word [Applause] he doesn't have to alter it and say oops i should have accounted for this i didn't know this was going to come up i didn't know this was going to come up he's not an oops god because an oops god is not a god there's no oops about him what he saw and from there in eternity he laid out everything and he got all the bases covered god's already spoke his word there's no going back on it amen amen hallelujah oh my brother adam says it like this right after this he says god is going to have a church i don't care how many dark ages we go through and whatever more he's going to have a church without spot or wrinkle whether we are part of it or not because he's already said it it's going to happen it's going to be there there's nothing can stop it there's not enough devil-inspired websites to turn around a son and daughter of god there's not enough demons in hell that can stop this word from being fulfilled god has spoken it and god is on the scene to fulfill it and bring it to pass he's got believers that'll stand on that word live sing drown swim whatever they'll stand on that word hallelujah i don't care how many decages in your life you've got to go through amen satan thought he had the church snuffed out in the dark ages he snuck in there he snuck in there and we find out that starting out in that ephesian age sneaks in there and wants to lead them away from a real true acts to experience of the baptism of the holy ghost instead of just mental exception will you believe on the lord jesus christ let me tell you something the devil believes it that's right well i believe this message is the truth the devil believes that all right i believe serpent see the serpent himself believes serpents see it yeah yeah amen it's these theologians that are all messed up out here come on it's evil spirits the bible said seducing spirits teaching doctrines of devils i'm going to preach now that trinitarian baptism is from the pits of hell it was inspired by the devil himself to try to break down that oneness and the unity of god because if you get it split into three person then you can kind of mess with the word does he keep all of his word what god says he keeps [Music] he don't need somebody else to keep it for him he keeps it himself [Applause] hallelujah glory be to god so here it doesn't matter all that takes place it's got to be there amen the bible says it like this in genesis 2. maybe i just kind of read this here the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and god blessed the seventh day and saint about it because then in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made he already spoke it but now over the time this time used in this sense as far as a measure for you and i to understand over thousands of years but god's word could not be altered amen now when it came to a time of now where the word that's been spoken it's coming time of a manifestation god enters into his rest it's finished the seventh speaks of a time of completion it's a time of rest this is why the seventh seal to us as believers it's the time of relaxing it's a time of resting it's a time of entering into him where all the promises lay here the fall takes place let me just read this here i'm trying just to get us to a certain place here this morning in hebrews 4 3 paul picks up on this rest and he's picking it bringing it now there was a spiritual part to this for we which have believed do enter into his rest as he said as i have sworn in my wrath they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world when were they finished before the foundation of the earth is the correct word before there was adam stardust or molecule samuel what he's saying the word itself is eternal amen it cannot be altered what was in god's mind it was finished amen before it was ever spoken because what was spoken was just that same word that plan now that has been expressed and now has been unfolded amen down through the time although the works were finished think of this as the fall had come god is brought out of his rest on that seventh day he's brought out of that this is where we go back into that time of the millennium god moves out god is drawn out of that to come out of that seventh day to come and now begin to unfold redemption for his lost children it's going back to that seventh day amen we're going back to that seventh day but remember what god as he's brought out of that rest it's not something then that god now has to come up with a i gotta come up with a new plan no this circumstances that took place allowed the attributes of himself the word now allows him to be expressed it's just like in your life my life we were in need of salvation he expresses the attribute of savior amen we were in need of redemption he expresses the attribute of redeemer in need of deliverance he expresses the attribute of delivery in need of a shepherd he expresses the attribute of shepherd in need of healing he expresses the attribute of healer this is all he is everything he's got it all covered that no matter what situation you go through you say my here's where everything started but you realize you're start there's only a moment that maybe you came to an altar or at a pew or wherever you're at and there was a start that was made there but that was only a reflection of what was already in his mind amen god already saw where your heart would be surrendered god knew the conditions that would come about god knew all of that he knew each of those moments god knew exactly when everything would come to that place as you're yielding to his spirit to where now the quickening comes on the inside and the new birth comes forth in your life god has all of that pre-planned it's all been arranged it wasn't the spot was holy it was a holy god that came and met you and i right there where did he meet us he met us in his word gestures could change our lives were all scarred up or whatever more but down beneath that vesture there was a word that god had sold where did that come from it came from the eternal amen amen nothing could alter it amen man i wish i could preach right now the devil no dog tried to twist up your granddaddy and grandma and everything else but he couldn't stop because every one of that even in the natural has this one has got to come with this one this one with this one it's got to come according to that way and god knew that you would be here why even your hair color your eye color your stature every bit of that god seem to it that all those details would be put in place the same god that saw to those details made a way that you would be able to recognize him in this hour and receive him he sow his word in you though this festure gets old this gesture gets weak this vesture gets sick but the inside man is alive and is renewed [Music] we were trapped there's no way out but god came made out let's yes lord let me just close with this our identity as we said it was in him before the foundation of the world we read the scripture in the opening the lamb slain before the foundation of the world when job was going through the tests and trials and the height of everything remember job oh he said with the day that they had somebody had never bought the report a man child was born he was depressed he was down he didn't even have fan friends and family even they turned their backs on him god permitted that yes god was permitted that here was a man that didn't have the holy ghost like you and i are privileged to have it but he still was the seed of god and god proved to you and i this is where james could write by inspiration have you read of the patience of job right the endurance of job it wasn't job the natural man it was god in job and so here in the clone in this moment when god comes down after elohim allah who comes down sacrifice now it allows god to speak to him god now asks him a question where were you when i laid the foundations of the earth that's pretty powerful see brother samuel what do you mean i'm talking that before you or i even had an opportunity to choose before doing good or even before any test or any trial before any mistake before anything god's taking him back before all of this trial took place and god lets him know because if he can let him see get him getting tied in back there then he knows i'm going back amen amen so he asked him a question where were you when i laid the foundations of these amen declare if you've got understanding who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who has stretched the line of them where upon are the foundations they're a fastened or who laid the cornerstone thereof when the morning stars sing together and all the sons of god shouted for joy sons of god shouting for joy before the foundation of the world i may not be too smart but i know one thing when you're shouting for joy you are you are shouting at a victory it's something that's going for you right here this is where now the sons of god shouting for joy brother branham takes it up in the very opening statement of the message the serpent seed he says this was the time where the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and the sons of god saw their salvation they saw the security of it and they shouted for joy that's why we can enjoy it right now we were there [Applause] that's one of all the pleasures of life you thought you enjoyed a lot of things in this life but it left you empty but when he comes when he ministers to your life when you meet him personally that's when real joy it's not a joy that any man can take from you no man can take this joy from you this is a joy that comes from god it's placed in the heart of the believer i know in whom i have believed i persuaded that he's able to keep that which i've committed unto him against that day amen you're not going to fail the word is what is anointing our life are you hearing me cast aside your thoughts lay them down you're anointed and ordained not to fail enter into that assurance enter into that reality if it's got clouded with the things of life if you feel like you know i feel like i've got so clouded with the things of life well just reach out to him and say lord jesus forgive me lord and renew not to be a renewing lord in my life he'll come he'll come and bring a renewal in your heart he'll bring a fresh joy in your heart where you can say lord restore unto me the joy of thy salvation you don't need to be saved again you don't even feel with the holy ghost again you can have a refilling but you as a believer have a right to say god restore to me the joy of my salvation maybe the things around you have wanted to pull it out of you but you've got to write as a son and daughter of god lord i want to make a withdrawal on the job [Applause] hallelujah we've got everything in the world to look forward to amen i know there's a lot of things that's down it's negative and if you listen to this or you listen to that sure anybody could be down at that are you with me but this is where as believers we've heard a certain sound our ears are tuned in it's looking unto jesus the author and the finisher of our faith it's not me keeping me it's god keeping me hallelujah he's a finisher if you don't have that reality this morning god can give you that reality you can say lord just make it real lord in my heart you can say lord jesus i want that reality that it's finished it's over [Applause] that same god is here he came to encourage you encourage me right here this morning he's the finisher he's not one who starts on the bathroom and starts on the plumbing and then realizes he's got himself way over his head he's not one who's dependent on whether home depot has the putty to put around the pipes when he comes to do he has all that's needed to do it man he ain't never run out and he ain't never gonna run out hallelujah the holy ghost is just as real just as sure healing is just as real and just as sure deliverance is just as real and just as sure god ain't pulling back at this age ladies ain't causing god to step back and neither are his sons and daughters stepping back in this age as a matter of fact we're stepping forward we're going on with the lord jesus amen we're stronger now than we were a year ago [Applause] we're stronger now the church ain't weaker the church is stronger [Applause] hallelujah why because god is the strong one in the midst of us [Applause] amen we've got a right to have joy amen hallelujah oh i'm not talking about working something up i'm talking about a real joy there's something down in your soul you know you didn't put there it's something that's real discouragements of life and other things have come your way but it cannot take that away from that work of god that's there in your life that's a god you can draw on that this morning brother samuel i really don't feel like that this morning this is a time of sacrifice it's the time to say lord you're my healer it's a time to say lord you're my joy brother said me i feel so weak i'd say lord you're my strength let the weak say i am strong let the redeemed of the lord say so i don't know i have god has never failed and ain't gonna fail he's not gonna start now he'll never fail he's a finisher hallelujah cancer tried to take you sister rita but god says not now [Applause] thank you my lord amen there's others of you sitting right here should i try i'm gonna take you but god said not now god is in control of this [Music] hallelujah amen i'd say right now while we're here in the sweetness of his presence it's a real precious time to go ahead and claim the promise that you have needed amen if you're in need of jehovah refer right now let him reveal himself and unfold himself i'm your healer if your need of peace let him unfold himself as i am your peace hallelujah glory be to god

hearts that like that on luke 24 that got there walking along and some things lord that we'll just say lord that maybe they don't say that there's no value in it but they don't see the vow like that

god hundreds of dollars he received because it was a collector's edition the last account of that stamp being sold millions of dollars but for him all he could see was an ice cream cone in it [Music] but it was worth so much more i pray lord right here this morning lord we might enjoy the company of one another we might enjoy the friendship of one another we might enjoy lord as we come and said

boy i barely made it no we're overcomers we're overcomers showing there'll be opposition there'll be situations there'll be things but those are only opportunities for the overcomer to manifest himself in overcoming grace in our life that you recognize that if it hadn't been for him your hands are already given up [Music] but you're in god's hands your life is not in your hands it's in god's hands amen what sister bethany's saying here earlier my hands are on hallelujah because that's all that's what real grace does real grace let you and i know this is his work the only thing that god wants me to do is you just you he'll do it he'll fulfill it all i have to do is heal you just yielding obeying his word just amen amen lord whether i see it feel it or where to understand it amen that's your word amen so be it just yield to it and let god perform he doesn't need doesn't need our strength he doesn't need he doesn't even need any of our abilities he just needs surrender and he does it say god let that be more of a realization help me to yield more help me to be more surrendered it's one thing to say boy i feel like i'm really surrendered but say god help me to surrender more help me to yield more help me lord help me and then when we stand there that day this is what we'll say praise god praise god [Music] is [Music] is [Music] amen let's just bow our heads and be
