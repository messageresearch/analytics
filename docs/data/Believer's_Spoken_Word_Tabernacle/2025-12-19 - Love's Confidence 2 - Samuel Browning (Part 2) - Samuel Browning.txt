TRANSCRIPT
========================================
It don't matter situations going on, their job. You know, sometimes the only time you hear or see from people is when their life is turned upside down. AND THE ONLY TIME THEY WANT PRAYER, the only TIME THEY WANT GOD IS WHEN THEY WANT GOD TO REPAIR the mess. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME? NOW, I BELIEVE IN REACHING OUT TO LIVES AND HEARTS, BUT I I ALSO WANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT FRIENDS, GOD IS MORE THAN JUST SITTING AROUND AND JUST SIMPLY WANTING TO PATCH THINGS up and then send US ON BACK. GOD WANTS US TO SERVE HIM, but to think his love is so great that he would answer prayer and do things even for people that won't serve him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They want to be healed. &gt;&gt; They want his blessings, but they don't want him. &gt;&gt; And yet, God would even pour out OF HIS BLESSINGS. GOD WOULD EVEN GIVE TO THEM EVEN UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCRIPTURE AND GIVE THEM UNDERSTANDING. BUT THEY don't want him &gt;&gt; because they don't want him to be in control of their life. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; They don't want him. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; But who wouldn't want this love? &gt;&gt; Who wouldn't who wouldn't want this? This is not about dos and don'ts. It's about God's divine love being revealed to us. But I I got confidence in this way. If they can ever see it in that right light, they'll realize that God's more than a handme- God's more than a bread line. God's more than that. They'll recognize that who he is. HE IS THE DEPARTER and deliverer of their sins. He's more THAN A PATCHWORK QUILT. HE WILL TOTALLY TAKE YOUR LIFE AND ABSOLUTELY CHANGE IT AND PUT A POWER ON THE INSIDE THAT'LL RAISE THAT LIFE UP from a life that's lived down here in sin. That is the power when the reality of Jesus Christ can strike A HEART. YOU SEE, THIS IS WHY THAT EVEN SOMETIMES WITH PEOPLE WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE MESSAGE, all they see is dos and don'ts. All they see is, well, I can do this and we better NOT DO THIS. YOU'RE NOT SEEING THE PICTURE. AND I REALIZE THAT JUST SAYING THAT DOESN'T GET YOU TO SEE IT. BUT TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE TO SEE GOD AND HE'S THE ONE THAT WILL CLEAN UP YOUR LIFE. THE VERY GOD THAT CAME DOWN AND BECAME ONE OF US WITH THAT SAME BLOOD THAT WAS SHED IN ORDER TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR SIN DEBT. HE DON'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE TONIGHT THAN THAN HE DID BACK THEN. HIS LOVE IS THE SAME. BUT WHAT IT HAS TO DO IS COME TO THAT PART THAT HIS LOVE PERMEATES BEYOND EVERY BIT OF our reasoning, &gt;&gt; our imagination, &gt;&gt; our thoughts about it &gt;&gt; and receive his thoughts. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord &gt;&gt; because it's not dos and don'ts. &gt;&gt; It's m you've missed it. It's not I don't care how how it's been represented. It's not dos and don'ts. It's Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a love of God being revealed &gt;&gt; to our lives. &gt;&gt; So this is God's desire within our hearts is that Paul would would speak this to be rooted and grounded in love. that there would be such a a confidence &gt;&gt; that would be had within our life. &gt;&gt; Does God mind questions? Not at all. &gt;&gt; God don't mind questions. God don't mind at times that where when we would come to him, Lord, I I don't understand this, Lord. I I don't see. He doesn't mind questions. He doesn't mind us even looking and coming to him and saying, Lord, would you help me? Help me to see &gt;&gt; how I need to see it. Lord, would you would you make yourself real to me? As a matter of fact, that's very complimentary of him because it shows there's an element of faith that's really starting to work. If we can even ask him and have a confidence that when we ask him, I know many times we say there's no such thing as a dumb question. But let's just be honest. Sometimes with questions we've had, we felt pretty dumb in asking them. &gt;&gt; Is that right? And sometimes we've just pulled back from it. But let me tell you, in the presence OF GOD, BEFORE GOD, YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL DUMB. You don't have to FEEL PUT OUT. ASK GOD. YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST SIMPLE IN THIS WAY of a person that could even hear this AND SAY, "LORD, HELP ME TO SEE IT IN THE RIGHT WAY. HELP ME THAT I'm not seeing you as a lawgiver, but I can see you as the fulfillment of the law and the RIGHTEOUSNESS THAT IN MY LIFE THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU DESIRE TO BE IS THE ATONEMENT in my life." God desires to make himself so real cuz what what does it do? It has an effect a governing effect upon our lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To know to perceive the love of Christ which passes knowledge. So it's not something that we we can explain. You cannot explain it. But it is something that is so real &gt;&gt; that is right there in the midst of our life. You say, "How do you know?" Well, you watch. You watch how the way that you live. &gt;&gt; Watch how your life is conducted. You know, like brother Rab says, who's on the control tower of your heart by the desires that's in your heart. &gt;&gt; So when we look at this this faith, God's desire to bring confidence within our hearts as believers. So perfect faith and this is a familiar statement. Perfect faith is a master of all circumstances. Brother Brandon would say it it masters no matter what it is, it'll master it. It'll when you believe anything, do anything, you got faith in what you're doing. And no matter what the circumstance is, that don't have one thing to do with it. It masters that circumstance. A room full of sickness and the Lord's revealed that a certain thing is going to happen, you just speak it and go home. Don't you don't ask any questions. It's all right. You just keep going. It masters all circumstances if you do this and so and so's going to do that. It's already got it mastered. Faith believes that God will work it out. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW HOW HE'S GOING TO DO IT, BUT HE'LL DO IT ANYHOW. It masters all circumstances. &gt;&gt; And faith and love is relation. Because you can't have faith unless you got love. Because your faith is in a God who is the very essence of love. And faith and love works together. That's what the Bible tells us. Faith workketh by love. &gt;&gt; And so, as we were looking at that LAST WEEK, YOU CAN'T HAVE the the right kind of faith without the divine love of God. &gt;&gt; Could a person have faith to move mountains? Yes. But that's not the faith that God's that God's speaking of. The faith this faith that is can only be produced by that of of the love of God dwelling in our life that it governs every circumstance. Now I read a few statements in there that were even before where brother Ram says you walk into a room of sickness and the Lord reveals this and reveals this and this be over here and this be over here. But I want you to remember, I'm not I didn't put the quote in here, but brother Ram goes into the same message, perfect faith, and he says, "Now," he says, "now these things have taken place by a vision from an angel of the Lord." And then he takes his Bible and he holds it up and he says, "But this right here," he says, is greater than ANY VISION BECAUSE THIS IS THE WORD OF GOD. AND HE SAYS, "THIS IS WHAT GOD WANTS YOU and I to take from." Remember, I think it was brother Collins asked Brother Brandham the one time, "Brother Brandham, would you pray and ask God to let me see a vision?" HE SAID, "BROTHER, LET ME TELL YOU, EVERY time that you open the Bible, you see a vision." &gt;&gt; SO, SO WHAT IS IT THAT IT WAS COMING BACK TO IS GOD WOULD lead us by his word. So, that there's THERE'S THINGS THAT COME UP WITHIN our life that we're not always going to see things and so and so had a dream and this and that. Of course, it all to BE PROVEN OUT. BUT YOU KNOW, THERE'S THINGS WITHIN OUR LIFE THAT AS SITUATIONS ARISE THAT FAITH BY the divine love of God will actually bring confidence to actually take a HOLD AND SAY, "I don't know how God's going to do this, but I know God's going to work it out. THERE'S NO DOUBT. I'VE GOT things right now that I know that the Lord has spoke TO MY HEART. I DON'T KNOW HOW HE'S GOING TO WORK IT OUT. MATTER OF FACT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. I DON'T SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. BUT THERE ARE PROMISES THAT I AM HANGING ON TO TONIGHT. AND LET ME JUST TELL YOU ABOUT THE HANGING ON TO THEM THAT NO MATTER EVEN WHEN I COULD FIND MYSELF OF REASONING WANTING TO MAYBE SAY BUT BUT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT WILL NOT ALLOW that to take place. I I don't know, maybe I'm I don't think I'm odd or strange, but I find myself just sitting around and my wife and I would talk about different things and and looking at that and I thought, my lord, of how there is something it cannot be overthrown within our hearts, OUR LIVES. I DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S going to look. THERE'S THINGS I'M PRAYING ABOUT. I DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO BE, BUT I KNOW THAT GOD IS GOING TO WORK it all the way out. &gt;&gt; You see, it's when we would know everything, then that's longer faith. BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW, THEN IT NO LONGER FAITH. BUT FAITH IS that evidence and is a substance of things not seen. Yet it's seen in the terms of that God has made himself known or revealed himself to you in regards to a situation. But love will actually create that confidence to move forward in that life. So watch how that when you know this love and faith and it doesn't matter how circumstances come you know brother random he would talk about even a young couple he says you know you take a young man and a young ladies and you put them you know far apart but their hearts begin to meet as beat as one and yet they're not husband and wife BUT THEIR LOVE BINDS them together and they have confidence in one another and he says and if you really love one another you know that this girl loves you and she knows that you love her. YOU'VE GOT CONFIDENCE OR A FAITH in one another if you got faith in one another. And if you don't, he said, "You better not marry her." And then he says, "NOW YOU'VE GOT TO have faith and you'll separate them," talking about that man and woman, "and put one extreme south and one extreme north. They're still that love beats for one another." No matter where they're at, they're just as true to one another as they can be because they love one another. And if you love the Lord, not just TRYING TO DODGE HELL, BUT if you love the Lord, THEN YOU CAN HAVE FAITH IN GOD. SEE, if you love him. So, we're not we're not this is not about dodging hell. If if IT'S ABOUT DODGING HELL, THEN THE PERSON'S very unstable already in their walk. &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible said a double-minded man, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; unstable in all HIS WAYS. &gt;&gt; IN ALL his ways. I always think of the story brother Tim Puit told when he was here and he talked about how that man ran out of gas on a country road and he saw this light up in his house up there. Well, I better go on up there. I ran out of gas. He he started walking AND THE MORE HE STARTED WALKING FINALLY he said them people don't know me from nothing. They're going when I get up there, they're probably going to think, "Who's this crazy man coming off the road like like he wants gas? He probably wants something else. He's probably here to, you know, to do us harm. HE'LL PROBABLY" AND HE KEPT ON ENTERTAINING THEM THOUGHTS AND THINKING ABOUT IT THE WHOLE TIME. AND FINALLY, you know, you'd have to just imagine Brother Tim telling it. And brother Tim, you know, standing right here and he said, "Finally," he said, he said, "the man got up to the door, you know, and all this still going on. He rang the doorbell or knocked on the door. And when they open the OPENED THE DOOR, HE SAID, "GUESS, KEEP YOUR OLD GAS. I DON'T WANT IT ANYHOW." HE TALKED HIMSELF OUT OF THE HELP THAT WAS THERE FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS HELP FOR HIM. BUT IT SHOWS A DOUBLE-MINDED MAN IS UNSTABLE IN ALL HIS WAYS. GOD DOESN'T WANT US TO BE UNSTABLE. GOD COMES TO MAKE HIS WORD SO REAL THAT WE CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE IN HIM. &gt;&gt; NOT IN YOURSELF, IN HIM. &gt;&gt; MY NOT JUST TRYING TO DODGE HELL, but if you love the Lord, then you have faith in God if you love him. NOW, NOTICE THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT, THE VERY THE VERY FIRST PRODUCT is love. Right? &gt;&gt; If you notice how really how three of these are within there, it's inward, outward, and then character. Love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith. But that love, but the fruit is love. There's there's a love. Now, Brother Brandon would take an example in perfect faith. He picks it up also in uh standing in the gap. They're just some weeks apart. And he talks about the relationship because that's what faith and love is. It's husbands and husband and wife. And he's talking about this this of a of a young lady that was there in Louisville. And I just want to read this to you. And he says, you know, she'd been a qu Christian for many years, but her husband, they had just, you know, she had just fallen in love with this man. He had been a Christian a couple years. And so they got married and they loved and had confidence in one another and got married. And so the woman said to the man, "Hubby, it must be hard on you. You're just a young Christian. You've had so much to go through. Drinking is what it was. You've had so much to go through with. I know you're bound to be tempted awfully hard." So I want you to know one thing. If you happen to fall, if you happen to fall into temptation and is overcome, don't stay away from home. You come on back. You come right here because I'm going to be right here waiting for you. I'M GOING TO HELP YOU PRAY through again until you get victory. I'M GOING TO STAY WITH YOU BECAUSE WHEN I MARRIED YOU, I married you because I loved you. AND NO MATTER WHAT YOU ARE, I STILL LOVE YOU. I there's a lot that that I could speak and preach from within there, but I think of what an expression AND THAT WAS FELIO LOVE, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT AN EXPRESSION THAT AS SHE'S SAYING, I DIDN'T I didn't I didn't marry you BASED ON HOW GOOD YOU WERE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THE MARRIAGE WAS BASED ON LOVE. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; This is WHAT THIS IS WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT. AND IF YOU IF YOU HAPPEN YOU COULD BE TEMPTED and we we know that temptation's not sin heeding it is but to understand that within this of of of of the temptation and things coming. I I think that the one point IN HERE IS DON'T STAY AWAY FROM HOME. LOOK WHAT THE LOVE OF GOD CALLED OUT. THE LOVE OF GOD YOU KNOW WAS SOMETHING THAT CALLED OUT AND SAID NO MATTER IF YOU FAIL COME ON BACK HOME. WHY? THERE'S SOMEBODY WHO LOVES YOU AT HOME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT THE REVEALING OF CHRIST IS TO BE IN OUR HEARTS, IN OUR ASSEMBLY. COME ON BACK. YOU MIGHT SAY, "WELL, THIS ONE'S FALLEN AND THIS ONE'S FALLEN." I DON'T CARE IF THEY FELL ON THEIR FACE 70 TIMES. GET UP. THERE'S A 71ST TIME. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME, FRIENDS? AMEN. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES WE LOOK AT THINGS AND YOU WANT TO DEFINE THIS AND DEFINE THAT AND DEFINE THAT AND WE FORGET HOW GOD HAS BROUGHT US ALONG. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? &gt;&gt; I KNOW GOD MAY NOT HAVE HAD TO BRING US ALONG AND HE was 53 TIMES PICKING US UP. BUT GOD MIGHT HAVE FILLED US, CONVERTED US, AND THEN HE HAD TO BRING US TO THE PLACE TO SAY, "HEY, I want to use your temple. &gt;&gt; Do you mind loaning it to me? &gt;&gt; Do you mind if I could use it? Do you mind if I use it?" and you're not so wrapped up in this. SEE, SOMETIMES IT'S DIFFERENT OF HOW THAT GOD HAS TO work and deal and GET A PERSON'S ATTENTION. BUT, YOU KNOW, GOD GOD HAS A WAY. AND THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART, IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW LONG, WELL, WELL, THIS PERSON WENT ASTRAY, YOU KNOW, 10 10 years and and you know, they've been up and down and UP AND DOWN. BUT THERE IS THE SAME GRACE THAT BROUGHT STABILITY TO YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME, FRIENDS? IT WASN'T YOUR GOODNESS. IT WASN'T HOW LONG YOU SAT IN THE MESSAGE, CHURCH. OH, I WAS UNDER THE RIGHT MINISTRY. IT'S BECAUSE THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST THROUGH THE WORD STABILIZED YOU WITH A CONFIDENCE TO SEE WHAT HE'S DONE FOR YOU AND YOU BELIEVED it &gt;&gt; and IT HAD AN EFFECT ON YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; IT REMOVED IT REMOVED A SLAVE LIKE MENTALITY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Brother Sam, you believe that? Yeah, I believe that. There's examples setting all around this church. Absolutely. I believe that that God's GRACE IS GREATER. BUT NOTICE THIS MAN, this is what was expressed by his wife. If you Oh, come on back. &gt;&gt; Now, of course, there's a way to come back. &gt;&gt; I won't deal with that, but there's a way. I won't deal with that tonight, but there's a way to come back, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I mean, you you you want to come back the right way so you can get what you need to get. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Now you see within it you know that's why you don't just come back and say well you know I just had an old weakness of the flesh and you know we just now that's not the right that's not repentance &gt;&gt; repentance is the way back &gt;&gt; and repentance is more than I'm sorry it's a sorrowful heart &gt;&gt; that will lead to a humble life &gt;&gt; in all things &gt;&gt; now this man's response. This is what I want you to watch. What here? A few days after it, he was eating his lunch with fellows down in the boiler room and he was telling them, "How could a man do anything wrong when somebody loves you like that?" &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; How could you do anything wrong when somebody loves you like that? Brother Bram says, "There you are. How could you trespass that confidence?" Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says you multiply that by a billion and then you'll get some idea what the love of God is. When you could think of what he did for you in the light of the scripture, not some emotion, but in the light of facts, then there's something happens in you. The new birth comes and he says, when we were sinners, now let's just just think of this. When we were sinners, alienated without God, it doesn't matter if you were in a message church or outside of a message church, we were all born sinners, &gt;&gt; right? Doesn't matter if you had all the taxs in a row on the Sunday school chart. You were a sinner. &gt;&gt; Didn't matter if you could finish quotes or brother Brandham. I could. Didn't matter. I was still a sinner. I needed a conversion. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? A change of nature. So when we were sinners, alienated without God in the world in that muck of mud, as I talked ABOUT THIS MORNING, GOD COME TO US. THINK ABOUT THAT. YOU DIDN'T FIND GOD, &gt;&gt; GOD FOUND YOU. &gt;&gt; I KNOW THIS IS SIMPLE. IT'S A THEME ALL THE WAY THROUGH. BUT IT'S THE VERY VERY PART OF UNDERSTANDING GOD'S LOVE THAT IT WAS NOT YOU THAT FOUND GOD. GOD CAME DOWN WHERE YOU WERE. GOD CAME DOWN AND ADORNED HIMSELF IN HUMILIATION &gt;&gt; BY BECOMING ONE OF US. &gt;&gt; WHY DID HE DO THAT? HIS LOVE FOR US. &gt;&gt; AMEN. DON'T JUST LEAVE HIS LOVE FOR THERE AT CALVARY. THERE IS THE ULTIMATE OF THAT. BUT for him to even come down and adorn a garment of humiliation that he would experience what it is to have a headache. &gt;&gt; I know it's simple except when we got one. that he would experience frustrations &gt;&gt; and to know what it was to be frustrated &gt;&gt; and then be able to empty that out so that would not become the motivator of why he was or was not doing something. He experienced tempted in all points such as we are. Why did he do that? That he might understand us. Because see, after Calvary, he would ascend right back up and send back the Holy Ghost that he might be a faithful and merciful high priest and the right kind of a mediator. So when you and I would go to him and say, "Lord, I'm tempted in this awful bad. Lord, the feeling I've got a feeling like this, maybe it's this wrong feeling against a brother, against a sister, or there's Lord this in the home. Lord God, help me, Lord. &gt;&gt; I need your strength, Lord. I because you know what? He knows how it feels. HE UNDERSTANDS TEMPTATION. HE UNDERSTANDS HOW IT FEELS. HE UNDERSTANDS HOW IT FEELS TO BE MISUNDERSTOOD. HE UNDERSTANDS HOW IT FEELS TO BE REJECTED. HE UNDERSTANDS HOW IT FEELS TO BE DESPISED. HE UNDERSTANDS. &gt;&gt; He understands what it is to be tempted. He understands what it is to turn his head. He understands, as the prophet said, he was tempted with drinking. He was TEMPTED WITH WOMEN. HE EVEN UNDERSTANDS WHAT IT'S LIKE for pride to want to come and take a hold and to display yourself before your brethren. Cast yourself down OFF OF THIS TEMPLE. HE UNDERSTANDS THAT. He allowed himself to be subjected &gt;&gt; in the humiliation &gt;&gt; of the likeness of sinful flesh &gt;&gt; that he might understand you and I. So when we would sit down in the living room of God's revealed word and begin to speak to him, he does not take it a threat when we say, "Lord, help me. Lord, I'm tempted." He doesn't say, "How could you be? How could this?" No, he doesn't. He's right there to minister to us what we have need of. &gt;&gt; You know what that does every time? You know what that does? It builds confidence. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It builds confidence in our life. God sought you. You never sought God. No man can come to me except the father draws him. God came down in that muck what you were and sought you out and brought you out. &gt;&gt; I always think about the woman at the well, too. You know, &gt;&gt; I mean, he came right where she was. &gt;&gt; He didn't tell her, "If you want me to touch your life, come on down to the synagogue. Make sure you put on disguise because I don't want nobody know that who I'm affiliating with. &gt;&gt; He knew what was beneath that darkness. &gt;&gt; He w He wasn't ashamed. Hallelujah. Oh, he wasn't he wasn't petting her sin, but he wasn't ashamed of that daughter of God down on THE INSIDE. ALL SHE NEEDED WAS A LITTLE BIT OF attention in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Ain't that what happened to you and I? It was a little bit of attention in the presence OF ALMIGHTY GOD. &gt;&gt; GLORY BE TO GOD. YOU SAY, "BROTHER SAMUEL, WHY DID HE GO DOWN INTO HER LIFE AND SAY, YOU KNOW, AND AND she comes forth and says about her husband and the one THAT SHE'S LIVING WITH, THAT WAS ALL TO GET AWAY ALL PRETENSE, TO GET AWAY ALL THE CONFESSION, TO GET RIGHT DOWN TO WHERE IT NEEDED TO BE." GOD LEADS US INTO THE PLACE THE BIBLE SAID, "THE GOODNESS OF GOD LEADS US TO REPENTANCE." IT'S WHY SO THAT GOD THEN CAN BEGIN TO MOVE DOWN and work within our life. There was nothing that was hidden &gt;&gt; from him. &gt;&gt; She knew it and her life was open before him. &gt;&gt; So good. &gt;&gt; Back that last quote that ought to create a perfect love. What should that he came down in the muck you were in? Oh, it may not have been prostitution. It may not have been like the woman at the well, but every one of us where we were at in our situation, in our needs, in our sin, it might have been right down in your reasoning. It might have been right in your mind all twisted around, but God came right down to where you were. &gt;&gt; He sought you out. He sought me out. That ought to create a perfect love. Look what you was and LOOK WHAT YOU ARE. WHAT DID THAT? CAN I JUST PAUSE HERE A MOMENT? Look what you were. Oh, brother Samuel, I I I I'm not what I OUGHT TO BE. I'M ASKING YOU, LOOK WHAT YOU WERE &gt;&gt; AND LOOK WHAT YOU ARE NOW. &gt;&gt; QUIT LOOKING WAY ON DOWN THE ROAD. RECOGNIZE THAT THE GOD WHO CAME TO SEEK YOU OUT, HE'S ALREADY STARTED A CHANGE IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND YOU'LL NOT GET ANY FURTHER WITHOUT RECOGNIZING THAT GOD HAS EVEN BEGUN THAT CHANGE IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Somebody that loves you. Can't you have faith in what he's promised you and real love will create a confidence in his word. &gt;&gt; He caught me when I was nothing. I'm still nothing but I'm in his hand. HE CAUGHT ME AND HE LOVED ME WHEN I was unlovable. He loved you when you was unlovable, but he changed you. And just like THE COLORED SISTER SAID THAT TIME IN her testimony, "I'm not what I ought to be, NOT WHAT I WANT TO BE, THEN I'm not, but then I'm not what I used to be." &gt;&gt; She knowed she had come somewhere. &gt;&gt; Something &gt;&gt; had happened. &gt;&gt; And then the prophet picks it up and says, "Won't your love reach back to him?" &gt;&gt; And there's a love affair. No matter what the situation is, its circumstances is governed by this love that creates faith. That God loves you and you love God and you love one another and that brings the faith. &gt;&gt; Then it can't keep from bringing out just exactly what God promised it would do. See this dwelling in our lives and that reality it brings then the confidence in the promises of God. The confidence to even to press on &gt;&gt; confidence that &gt;&gt; be honest. We all have loved ones we're praying for. &gt;&gt; We'll have different ones that we've got on our hearts. You got children, &gt;&gt; have a spouse. But see this right here to see what God has done for you and how he sought you out. &gt;&gt; I know sometimes it it you know sometimes it maybe could help us if we see a little glimmer, but I'm going to tell you faith itself doesn't need a glimmer. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; it might look like things are going the opposite way. That's right. &gt;&gt; It might seem like the more you pray that things are getting worse. &gt;&gt; Good preacher. &gt;&gt; But don't stop praying. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Because let me tell you, the same thing that turned your heart around and your life around is the same thing that'll turn your children's heart. &gt;&gt; It's the same thing that'll turn your spouse's heart. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; You have the same kind of confidence for what God has done in your life. Just like even when it comes to sickness and things. Oh, I mean my, you know, we would all love to have where something would come forth as a vision and my I would love to be able to see this and I would love to be able to know this. somebody speak a word over me and I would we we would there's many of those things that we could say I would like to do that or I would like to have where I don't have to go through that surgery or I have to go through this man I would love for it to happen this way but sometimes it beg it begs the question why would we love for it to happen that way is that about God or about us &gt;&gt; and what I mean is it's not just about pride but it's also something about is it about I don't feel like going through that. I don't want to go through that. I mean, nobody nobody I don't think anybody does. I don't I don't think anybody ever said, "Hey, I really want to go through a surgery. If they do, they need their brain baptized &gt;&gt; because nobody wants to go through that, right?" But, you know, there's things about that even in the human element and all those things that we say, "God, help me, Lord. I I need I need I need your strength. I I need Lord, what is it that you would have me to do?" And you're praying about it. You're looking to the Lord. And here you are. You just continue on in your walk with God. And daily you're walking with God. You're you're continuing. Here you are staying right in the presence of God. And through it all, you don't have maybe a direct answer. You go ahead and set the date for that surgery and how everything's going along. What what is absolutely taking place, faith &gt;&gt; is mastering &gt;&gt; the circumstances of life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So that you don't walk paralyzed. Oh, I just need a word from the Lord. If God would just give me a vision. If God would just give me this, if God would just do me this, if God would just Brother God didn't even do that for brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I got a lot of quotes on that. I could read that to you. &gt;&gt; It caused people to think that. But brother Brandham says, "I have to work out and find God's will just like &gt;&gt; you do." &gt;&gt; Right? And he also goes on to say in the revelation series, he said, "Many times we make decisions that we think are the greatest mistake and it turns out that it's right the will of God that's been worked out the whole time." &gt;&gt; Now, don't anybody take that and twist that one now. But notice, let me let me let me let me get to this place here within this. Paul would write and say, &gt;&gt; "Cast not away, therefore, your confidence, &gt;&gt; which hath great recompense of reward. For you have need of patience after you've done the will of God, that you might receive the promise. For yet a little while, and he that he that will come will come, and will not tarry." Now the just shall live by faith, but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them who draw back unto predition, but of them that believe to the saving of the soul. You know, Satan Satan loves to come and try to break confidence &gt;&gt; in the word of God. There's a quote I want to I want to leave you with. I'm just I don't have it here, but I want to refer refer it refer you to it. In the revelation of Jesus Christ, the prophet tells us how Satan's desire is to break that confidence and to work to destroy all the way until the time he's cast into the lake of fire. And he has many different ways that he can do that. Some of the ways that he'll do that is to try to point out to you, well, I thought you felt it was going to happen like this. Oh, I thought so and so said this would happen and it didn't happen. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I thought I thought, you know, I I thought God cared about you. I thought he loved you. Remember like he told the prophet, I thought he cared for you and he'll work and he'll try to break confidence within the word of God. I want to just say it in this way that when God through all of the examples, it doesn't matter like the prophet when he spoke about that confidence, he said it didn't matter. He said, "If I prayed for 10,000 tonight and every one of them died in the morning," he said, "I'd be right back on the platform &gt;&gt; praying tomorrow night." &gt;&gt; Are you with me? You know why? Because it's not a life that's lived just based on outcomes. &gt;&gt; It's a life that's lived based on confidence in God's word. &gt;&gt; See, this is where what God come to do is bring our confidence in the word of God. So that no matter what takes place and no matter where we're standing, we have the promise, you'll never be ashamed. &gt;&gt; You'll never be ashamed for standing &gt;&gt; on God's word. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's stand together. You'll never never be ashamed. Let me read just a just a couple scriptures here. Peter said it's contained in the scriptures. He's pulling from Isaiah. Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, elect and precious, and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded or ashamed. Psalms 37, the Lord knoweth the days of the upright, and their inheritance shall be forever. They shall not be ashamed in the evil time, &gt;&gt; right? and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied. Peter said, "If any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God on this behalf." Paul would write, "According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life or by death." As a believer standing on God's word, we can never be ashamed. Right. &gt;&gt; God God sees to that. We're standing on his word, standing in his word. You'll never be confounded. &gt;&gt; You know what that means? That means that even when you don't have an answer, but you're standing right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It wouldn't matter like it was in the days of Noah. They they shot the moon and proved there wasn't any moisture up there. You wouldn't be ashamed. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; Because it's not about what you can explain. That's right. That's right. Come on. &gt;&gt; It's about what you know. &gt;&gt; That love of Christ, &gt;&gt; the love of God in your heart. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't matter how much that they could try to explain it away, it doesn't matter. What about what about what about standing right here someone as we're praying and looking for healing and let's say as we're praying for healing and God takes them on home, they've been healed. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; They've been healed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But it just wasn't how we were expecting it. &gt;&gt; Let me ask you this, &gt;&gt; Brother Brown. I'm standing right there coming right past I went I went right past that area where that black where that black squirrel jumped out. Walked right past that. Traversed right by right right by that as it was going down over to Eagle Rock there in Arizona a year ago. And right where that would have jumped out seen one of them chulo c cactuses right there and how that how that is seen and was able to see that. And now I want you to think when brother Brandham walked off of there wings of a snow white dove is where he tells it. How does he say that? That healing did he say, "Oh, it's going to come a day from now or two days from now." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When he had come off of that mountain that was in Arizona, he preaches Wings of a Snow White Dove down in Shreveport. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "It's over. &gt;&gt; It's over. &gt;&gt; I want you to think about it. He never received his healing until he stepped on the other side. But he was healed. &gt;&gt; He was healed. &gt;&gt; You know why? Never be ashamed. &gt;&gt; Never be ashamed. &gt;&gt; You think Brother Ram's ashamed over there? No, he wasn't ashamed. When God has made When God has made known his word, you can stand on his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, the devil will try to make you feel small. Well, look at it. You're You're claiming your children. Look at the direction they're going. Never be ashamed. God's word is still true. &gt;&gt; Believe on the Lord, and thou in thy house shall be saved. They and their offspring shall be there with them. &gt;&gt; Brother Samuel, HOW FOOLISH WOULD I LOOK walking around and quoting the word of God? I wouldn't worry about looking foolish. I would walk around and quote God's word. I would quote that promise. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS? EVERY TIME YOU COME BACK AND the enemy wants to TRY TO BRING DOUBT, JUST SAY, "STICK AROUND. I'VE GOT A TESTIMONY service for you." BECAUSE WITH ALL THEM SCRIPTURES, GUESS WHAT? I AM A product of somebody that was praying for me. AND WHAT GOD DID FOR ME, HE'S GOING TO DO FOR THEM. Will never be ashamed. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; No matter what the enemy would try to show, our love reaches right back and says, "I don't know how he's GOING TO DO IT. I DON'T KNOW HOW HE'S GOING TO TURN THEM AROUND. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO TO GET THEIR ATTENTION. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S WHAT HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO DO, but I know the same God and what he did for me. He'll do it for my daughter. He'll do it for my son. Do it for my children. He'll do it for THIS LOVED ONE. WHATEVER THAT IT TAKES, LORD, to turn their lives around, you know them, Lord. &gt;&gt; Before you ever gave them to me and I had them, held them in my arms and walked with them AND EVERYTHING ELSE, YOU already knew him, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you see, this is why you can have a confidence cuz you knew it was a supernatural experience that turned your life around. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was something that was schooled into you. when somebody somebody taught you or reasoned you into but you just know I'm different. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm not I'm not not what I used to be. &gt;&gt; What did that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The revelation that somebody loves you. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Oh my. Love produces a confidence, don't it? &gt;&gt; That I don't have to know. It just it governs the circumstance. I don't have to know how this is going to work out, but I just know that God's got it in control. &gt;&gt; I don't know how this is going to take place, but I know God's got it in control. Don't you love him, friends? &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; it's not a shot in the dark. It's reality. &gt;&gt; This is This is faith. &gt;&gt; Faith doesn't need to know how. &gt;&gt; Faith says God will do it. Amen. As &gt;&gt; a matter of fact, brother Bam says in the message, look, he said that thought of how is God's business. &gt;&gt; It's not yours. &gt;&gt; It's God's business. &gt;&gt; But just believe his word. Say, "Lord, I believe it. &gt;&gt; I believe it. Lord, let it let it sink down so in my heart &gt;&gt; to where it affects even all of the actions in my life." Let's pray. Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; I know, Lord, and we're standing here tonight, there are are needs, Lord, that are on our hearts, needs among us. There's, Lord, needs that are being that have been in prayer. I pray, Father, just a a word of encouragement. and Lord God for not only Lord those needs that are being prayed for but maybe there's hearts Lord that Father just need a a deeper work in their life and they can realize and see they can have Lord that that's something Lord to pray for and say Lord that's what I want I want that love affair I want that relationship Lord all I'm seeing I see dos and don'ts if I do this, if I don't, but let me just see you, Lord. I I want to see you. I I want to know you in a personal way, Lord Jesus. I pray, Father, may you just take your word, move in every one of our hearts, Lord, according to the needs that's in our lives. Our desire, Lord, is Father, I believe, God, there's a there's even a deepening in our lives, a deepening of the love of God. Lord, I I believe in the work and what you've done in my heart and my life and how you changed my nature. But I know there's a depth, a greater depth. Lord, help us, Lord. I pray. May we Lord Jesus taking every request, taking every single need, Lord, we place it before your throne. May the heart, Lord, in simplicity tonight, look up and say, God, I want to be I want that scripture to be my scripture. We have seen and do testify that God has sent the son to be the savior. &gt;&gt; We have known and believe the love that God hath for us. I want that to be my scripture. Lord God, may that be the reality. May they see you, Lord. May you minister, I pray, Lord, to every heart. And may they just, Lord, an encouragement, Lord, to keep pressing on Lord &gt;&gt; to keep, Lord, just looking to you and trusting you in the midst of every one of these situations, these needs.
