it's a trying time out there for the world but I believe we have standing living witnesses that God's still alive and on the throne amen praise the Lord I I believe we have I believe we have the greatest young people on the face of the Earth that believe this message and follow this message and that's what believing this message will produce is the greatest young people to walk on the earth I believe that with all my heart and I believe we should be proud of our young people I believe we should be thankful for them there's a lot of other places you could be tonight Ben but you're here serving the lord amen I believe God God recognizes our our commitment to him and you might not feel you know that you're worthy of anything and you might not feel that you're you know looked upon fairly by anybody but God sees you God sees you standing for his word in this age and I believe he's mindful of everything in our in our heart I would just maybe tonight as they're playing this that maybe you have something on your heart tonight that you just have you been battling with or be a question or maybe you want a Vindication of of something in your life whatever it might be maybe just just raise your hand as we we ask the Lord and don't just ask but believe that he's going to come by and minister to that need and there's parents in here or listening in your kids are here why don't you pray with us tonight that the Lord will come and meet their need father we love you Lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy and our life Lord the word that you've given us in this age

service for you Lord these musicians in their hands father I pray that you bless them in a mighty way Lord in Jesus name may you open your word to us we pray amen amen thank you for the music and if you have your Bibles turn to the Book of Genesis first chapter you know Paul I don't know why everywhere jackets up here we just take them off all right Genesis the first chapter we could probably read this one by heart but in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters in 26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image all right God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God saw everything in the 31st verse and God saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good somebody say very good so God looked upon everything that he had spent time creating and he said it was very good amen may God bless his word he may be seated tonight so for a few moments tonight we want to talk about Power in the Blood and the word of your testimony there's power in the blood and Power in the word of your testimony amen so we see here in Genesis we kind of come into this picture where Moses has has uh transcribed the what God's told him has happened in the beginning in Moses is Penning God's thoughts down and and and and God tells Moses like this and start it and in the beginning God created and so God spent this and you know there's there's there's this debate in uh in in the society about how old the world is and how old the Earth that we're standing on is and some say that it took 50 50 million years to create you know this world and all the stars to spin and and everything and I just I I don't dispute with them I think that could be the truth because in this part of God's creation there is no time there was no time in the Garden of Eden there was no time during this part of creation there was things spinning things happening things going on but as for man there was no time so all this was was revolving around and I believe God had this in his mind that he was thinking of of an earth right you know he's thinking of a that I'm going to create something and there's going to be a light for that and he he thinks of a son and a son comes out and however it came out whether it was a a spark off of of him or a a a bang or whatever happened but the sun is in existence out of God's creative power he spoke it and there was light right so the first thing we see here is it wasn't light is not the first thing that happened but God's speaking is the first thing that happened the first thing is God spoke it so there's power in the spoken word to create a light so the light was not the first thing to come but God's voice was the first thing to ever be in creation right and God God spoke this into creation and the Sun goes into orbit and and he and he speaks uh about a a little blue uh Circle that would be hanging in the middle of a black space and and there we have this globe that we're on right so just just bear with me for a moment I'm not teaching a class on on what is that even called astrology astronomy but God speaks these things into creation because that's what he's seen in his mind so he's speaking out what he's seen in his mind and and there there becomes a a tangible evidence of what God's thinking and he speaks out in the beginning there's light right and the Sun comes into existence and the earth goes around it now now science tells us that that the the calcium and the iron and the deposits in the Earth would take millions and millions and possibly billions of years to come into existence and I think that really excites me it gets me pretty fired up to think that God would spend 50 billion years creating a thing a circle in the middle of Darkness that would have calcium and iron and and all the deposits it would take to have a sustainable life in just the right distance from the Sun and the right gravitational pull from the Moon and he would spend millions of years creating this this vessel in the middle of Darkness but that's not even the main focal point of his creation so if he spent 50 million years creating the Earth that we stand on how much time did he spend been creating the focus of what would be on the earth this is just somewhere we spent 70 or 80 or 100 years and if he spent 50 million years wrote it designing this place that we would just walk on for a few months how much time did he spend thinking about you how much time and effort and creative power did he put into when he thought about his attributes this is just something that we're walking on is something that we're standing on but his actual thought expressed is you tonight I believe that there's more to us than we recognize I believe there's more going on behind our lives than we realize God thought so much of you that he spoke you into existence and not just threw you out here into the chaos of the world but he designed something so specific a way of Escape for you that you could come back to him so he cast his thoughts out right into creation knowing that they would return for his thoughts do not return to him void but they always complete the circle they always complete the pattern right so to get our text out of this we'll turn to the Book of Revelations the seventh chapter and there was war in heaven and Michael and his angels fought against the dragon the dragon fought it and his angels and prevailed not I love that scripture that's why the devil hates the Book of Revelations because it says right there and he prevailed not right so you're you're battling a defeated enemy he's already defeated we're just waiting for the defeat to develop so if we're waiting for the defeat to develop we're also witnessing the victory develop right we're witnessing the victory of this scripture developed so it's not so much that just Satan was defeated but we came out Victorious right and the Great Dragon and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which to see with the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they some we say they they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their somebody say there their testimony they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony now the word of Our Testimony is is an interesting thing brother Ben because it's not how we start now we look at Abraham's life and we look at how Abraham's Journey started out and and he was just a regular guy in a regular City having a regular job going to regular school there was no so what we would seem a supernatural you know and a lot of times as as young people were Believers and we've heard of the supernatural moves of God and we're looking for brother Paula a a light a gold beam to light up our path that we could walk on that Golden Road like a yellow brick road you know well Abraham didn't have that he was just a regular old guy going to his regular old job but inside of Abraham was a thought from God a seed that God put inside Abraham but Abraham didn't know it he was just going to work he was just you know having the same old in and outs and maybe some young people haven't got that far down the road but it doesn't get any better you just get up and you do the same thing without the Eternal work of God in your life there really is no point to this but with the Eternal seed in your life you're aware that this is just something that we have to do in this life but this is not who we are there's another me inside here that is crying for something greater and I believe we all have that in common here tonight that there's something inside of us that is reaching out for something greater than where we're at right now and I could say that confidently tonight to know that you all everyone that walked inside this door myself included can live higher than where we're living now can live in a better place than where we're living now can have more faith than what we have now and I believe that's why we come because we hunger and thirsteth after righteousness and the promises that we shall be filled right so this is this is Abraham's Abraham's life and he's just going through life and but all of a sudden one day he wakes up and maybe he doesn't feel different it doesn't you know the the sun's spinning exactly in the same place and everything looks exactly the same but God calls Abraham by name and tells him it's time to come out and go and and walk and take a walk with him right I would I would I would wonder if how many of us have heard that call right we're just going through life we're just going to school we're we're in our in and outs of days but there's something on the inside of us and at the appointed time God calls that seed and says it's time for this for this seed to be quick into my word and he calls us out by name and then we're not just a normal guy going to work or a normal guy going to school anymore or a normal sister working at a cafe somewhere but we're a a vessel of God that has an elect seed inside of us a thought of God and all of a sudden our name is written a whole testimony Abraham and we look at Abraham how he started out as an idol worshiper he started out as a as just a heathen a regular old Babylonian uh just a just a regular old guy on the Earth but it's not how you start that matters it's how you finish so when they write about Abraham's testimony they would say in Romans for what saith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness and he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God now you would think as a young person that Abraham's life he must have had he must have been without blame or without fault to have this great testimony written over his life but you know Abraham laughed at the promise of God before Sarah did Abraham laughed at God's promise before Sarah did he doubted the Lord's word but yet when his testimony is written about him it doesn't say that Abraham laughed at the promise of God it said Abraham was found faithful in every promise and stagger not but was strong in faith so it doesn't matter how you start it matters how you finish and you might feel like you've started out on the wrong track and you've made commitments to God and you've gone back on them or you've you've made an effort to get closer to God and you find yourself back in this scene but it doesn't matter how you start out it matters what you do from this moment on Abraham stagger nodded Promises of God through unbelief but was found faithful and what is the requirement of the church when he comes back to Rapture of a body out of this age will he find faith when he comes so it's not mattering how you're starting out this walk it matters what you do from this moment on how you're going to finish it now God did not call us to be starters God called us to be finishers God didn't call us to start into an age she called us to finish in age God didn't call us to start a Reformation of a word god called us to finish the restoration of his word in this age now this is a big responsibility for our young people to take onto their shoulders but God put you here because he knew you could handle the load brother Brown said the Holy Ghost knows the load you can handle and that's why you're here so don't think it odd that you're here in this age but God had thoughts of you and he placed you in this age and you're performing his word exactly how he thought of it remember it's not how you start he would say but watch carefully now and see this before there ever was a speck of Stardust before God was God and God is an object of adoration and no one was there to worship him so he was at that time only potentially God and he was known only as an eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind you see where you really began was not on such a such street or in such and such hospital or born to such and such parents the bride was already in the mind of God yes she was she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of God they are Eternal are they not the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God eternal are the thoughts of God Eternal let's establish this down now amen yes yes God never had a thought that's going to have an end but the thoughts of God are Eternal right so you want to drive that point home write that down somebody the thoughts of God are eternal if you can see this now you've all agreed yes right if you can see this you will see many things so we've already said yes to this so now we have the promise we see that so now we can see many things God is unchangeable in both Essence and behavior we have studied that and proven that already God is infinite in his ability so therefore he as God must be omniscient if he is omniscient then he is he is not he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add his knowledge then he is not omniscient the best way we could say is that sometime he will be but that is not scriptural he is omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts let me say all all his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is God thus the thoughts of God are Eternal and they are real some we say they are real they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up in which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real and eternal and part of God already real so take this like this if I'm trying to describe to you uh what it's like to eat a Chick-fil-A and I say you know if you know if you get if you get the the four piece chicken strip and sometimes the the strips are a little shorter and sometimes they're a little longer but you still get four strips and I'm trying to describe this texture to you and I'm trying to portray that with my with my best description and sometimes you don't have the words explain to me how Chick-fil-A sauce tastes well it's a little bit like this a little bit smoky it's a little bit it's hard to describe right but in your best vocabulary you try to explain that but then the only way to really tell somebody what you're what you're doing with it is to bring them a number uh uh a four piece chicken strip with a Chick-fil-A sauce and then they can now have what you're explaining to them right so in the mind of God there's these thoughts right and many of you have your own thoughts going on you're thinking I wish this was over because now I'm hungry and Chick-fil-A is closed on Sunday anyway so there's no reason to be in a hurry and you're thinking that that all these different thoughts and this brother over here is probably snowboarding somewhere and this guy over here has probably got school tomorrow oh summer so you're probably you know thinking about how late you're gonna sleep in tomorrow and road is probably thinking about volleyball and you know we all have thoughts going on in our mind but we have a present tense to us that's here I hope and so we block out those other thoughts because there's a main thought in Focus right let me say that God has lots of thoughts going on in his mind he had thoughts about an earth and a world and a sun and all these things but those are those side thoughts that were in his mind but the main focus point of his thought is you you are the main thought of God so God is trying to describe in his scripture what it will be like when the bride comes into full view right with us the Believers at the end time coming to full view well I could just announce us tonight that we're here this is the full view of the word of God it doesn't it doesn't maybe look glorious in the outside world but it's glorious in the eyes of God the Youth of today in this message under her messenger is exactly how God's solid in his mind and he said they will overcome by my blood and the word of their testimony they will stagger not at the promises that I have given them to unbelief but they will be found faithful in every promise I want to encourage us tonight that we're not wandering out there wandering in circles but we're walking in the perfect plan of God that he has for our life he had thoughts of us he had thoughts of of people coming into this part of the world in this time in this age and here we are I want to just announced to the devil tonight here I am those thoughts of God that said you would be defeated the victory part of that prophecy here I am and they cast him into the Lake of Fire you know how they did that they didn't give him anything to work with well I would say young people locked the devil up in your mind tonight don't give him anything to work with when he comes against you says well you know you're not going to make it or you're not going to have enough Faith don't give him anything to work with don't give him any room for that don't the scripture says don't give room to the devil don't give him room in your mind to think well uh you know what it's a great word it's a promise Tower but I don't know if it's for me let me just say it is for you this message is for you this Rapture is for you there's catching away of a bride body is for you you didn't just get born into this had a chance you didn't come out of the world and this had a chance but God thought of you and at an intersection in your life he called you by name and you might not recognize that now young person but you've been called by name to come to this intersection in life that God could deal with your heart and he could say now it's time come follow me lay down all the things of the world lay down the weights and so easily beset you and come follow me that was the beginning of Abraham's Journey but there was a promise at the end of it so the Devil comes to us and he thinks well you know you doubted the word there and you doubted you you know you're not sure about this and you had a question and so I had a question I had a question about the message or I had a question about the prophet or I had a question about Jesus Christ or I had a question about this or that and the devil will try to come down on you and say well see you're not really elected you questioned it no I don't read that anywhere in the scripture I read where Abraham staggered not even though his his actual Earthly Journey looks something like this and he went there and he went here and he went over there and he thought about this and but when it was written of him of his testimony it said he was found perfect in the word of God if we have it maybe we can put it up there for Psalms 139 brother this is a familiar scripture I think every you should have this written down somewhere where they can read in the room for thou has possessed my Reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous how that works and that my soul knoweth it right well my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the Earth Thine Eyes did see my sustenance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are thy thoughts unto me oh God how great is the sum of them if I should count them they are more in number than the sand when I am awake I am still with thee so I think well those are a lot of complicated words can I read this out of the Amplified version for you for you formed my innermost parts you knit me together in my mother's womb I will give thanks and praise to you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made wonderful are your works and my soul knows it very well my frame was not hidden from you when I was being formed in secret and intricately and skillfully formed as if embroidered with many colors in the depths of the Earth your eyes have seen my unformed substance so the faith eyes of God the thought of God in his mind your eyes have seen me before I was formed and in your book were all written the days that were appointed for me when as yet there was not one of them even taking a shape so God saw today before there was ever a year to 2023 before there ever was uh uh uh uh where are we Sheffield Ohio before there ever was a a tabernacle and pews and for your mama and daddy ever were or your grandpa and grandma ever were God saw this and already had this thought in his mind right before it ever taken shape how precious also are your thoughts to me oh God how vast is the sum of them and if I could count them they would outnumber the sand when I awake I am still with you so God has thought so intricately about us in this age and it's like if I can put it like this it's like an artist having something in his mind that he's he's God I'm not artistic I can't hardly draw I can't draw a stick figure brother I just you know but in my mind I can see something you know I can see a shadowing I could see that but brother Shane I try to write that out and it looks what were you trying to draw I'm not a good Pictionary partner but in my mind I can see it I can see what I would like to draw I could see what I would like to portray but I just can't get my hands and all the coordination to to match what I see in my mind but God's an artist God's the greatest artist that there ever was and he sees something within his mind and it's like it's like an artist trying to express like we think of a a van Gogh and he sees this woman and he sees it in his mind and he's he's gonna he's gonna paint it like he sees it in his mind and and it's Gotta It's gotta come to that perfect capture of what he's trying to describe to you now the best way for me to taste Chick-fil-A is for him to bring it to me and I have a visual I have a tangible thing right so Van Gogh could try to describe to you what he's he sees in this woman in this deep look in her eyes and it looks just like this but the best way for an artist to get that expression out of himself is to paint it and so he paints this picture called Mona Lisa and it has this captivation within its eyes and it seems to it seems to stare at you like a living a living creation because he's painted it in such a way that it captured what was the thought of him so you see God is the greatest artist that there ever was so you might think well if I was going to make the Mona Lisa I would make her look like you know I'd have her have you know you know bleach blonde hair and I would have her with you know this way and she'd have lipstick and makeup and this and that and you see how today they would have drawn her that way but he didn't think well I'm just going to draw the most beautiful woman that I can think of I'm going to draw the one I see in my mind I'm going to draw the one that I see exactly the way I want it to look I see exactly the expression on her face I see her eyes I see I see the way that she looks around the room when you walk to and you know if you ever get a good picture you ever seen a good picture and the eyes seem to follow you across the room and no matter where you go they're there because he's captured the essence of his thought he's he's captured his thought down and he's put it on and you know and and and they can tell a counterfeit by the stroke Direction and every picture is so intricately this artist's work and he's he's painted it just the way and and they can actually look at the stroke direction of this picture and they can tell whether it's fake or whether it's real because the artist has a signature way of the way he designs this painting and the way he makes it this expression of his thought and so somebody could come and our technology could paint this Mona Lisa picture for some reason I see it over here on this wall but he's he's painting this but he there's no way he can match the exact replication of what Van Gogh is painted because it was in Van Gogh's mind so you can look at the expression of it but you could never match it because you don't have the inspiration of where it came from the inspiration of where it came from was in the mind of the artist all right so now we're on track right so the devil's telling you that you're an impersonation of this and you should just walk away and you should just leave this alone and you're just pretending to get along with this until you turn 18 or maybe there's an elder in here an adult back there we're just impersonating this because we're scared to go to hell and we don't really know if it's for us but there's a certain design about you the inspiration in the mind of God has drawn you like he has seen you in his mind for he is the great artist and he has painted this picture of you and you are the exact thought of God and no impersonation can come along and try to match that because it didn't come from the same inspiration and there might be a you in the mirror that you see but that you in the mirror is not you but there's another you inside of there that God Drew in his mind he saw the thought and he expressed it in this age and he said I'm gonna draw Paul and he's gonna look like this is going to have these abilities he's going to have a smile that captures the room and I laugh that everybody gets in with I'm going to design Paul that he could be an element that'll be used as a gift of mine in this age to bring people to me and he portrays this attribute out into the Earth and this Paul that we see here is not actually Paul but there's another design on the inside of there that God saw before the foundation of the world and that thought was called Paul Browning and he said in my age at the end of time I'll need a young people rise up that will be able to not have walked with the prophet maybe never seen a miracle in your life maybe never witness the almighty hand of God appear in a room and ride on the wall maybe some of us have but I doubt whether many of us have but I'll think of thoughts that will be able to take me at my word and he began to paint and God knows what he's doing he knows how to get the result that he's wanting he's not an artist like I am where I would like to get this result but I just can't do it but God is the Divine artist and he begins to take things that you think that there would never be Beauty in and he begins to go to work on it you would think there'd never be Beauty in a woman called Rahab but the great artist begins to go to work there and he begins to work on her and he begins to call her by name and he begins to send under her a message right to her home and what was once uh something that you would never find beauty in there becomes an eternal value to it that cannot be reproduced or replaced because God thought of her in his mind they could have just went in and marched and taken down Jericho anytime they want but God had a Rahab there in his mind and I like this because I've never felt more in tune with Rahab than I do today because she was a gentile and this promise and this promised seed was to go over and to conquer and they could take that City Anytime they wanted but they could not because God had a Rahab inside Jericho and first Rahab had to have the message come to her so she could get on the boat and be saved if I could say it like that so she could get in the in the message and be saved so there was nothing beautiful about about rahabs you know seemingly her apartment wasn't great but there was an eternal value in there and God sent somebody right to that because that's the value he's looking for now what is the value of your soul you think well I'm just you know I'm just here I'm so-and-so said what's your dad's name Jesse so I'm just Jessie's son and and you know I'm just here on this Earth and this is but there's a greater value to you than that there's a greater value than whatever Earthly possessions you have or you hope to have or the career in mind that you have there's a greater value in there because God thought of it and it's Eternal value now remember we all agreed everybody agreed your your commitment with me that God's thoughts are eternal okay God's thoughts are still Eternal when they're expressed God's thoughts still don't have an end even after their Express so now you're here as a thought of God but you are still Eternal now you're here in this body but you're still an eternal thought of God and I would say it like this God can take something that seemingly would have no value to the outside world I give the brother some slides brother show me that block of marble there's a block of marble here and you would think how how could we make something pretty out of this or beautiful out of this and and you think about your your own life you think well I failed and uh I've I've made mistakes and I've fallen short you think how can God make something beautiful out of my life but then you begin to look at the the mind of the artist do we not have it it's okay there's a beautiful scenery okay here we go is there anything beautiful about that it just looks like hard work to me looks like a lot of a lot of the packing to do I'm thinking about dollies and cranes and how we're going to get that moved but you see God looks looks at something like that and he doesn't see it for the face value he sees it for what he knows is already on the inside of it because he knows as the great artist what he's put on the inside of it we can see the next picture brother not that one now that came from that block now how did Michelangelo look at that granted and see that brother Shana just baffles because I'm not an artist I I just can't I can't see that but he could see this this block of granite and he could go to work with his chisel and his hammer and I don't know what it took 30 years and he sees a Moses and I'm gonna have Moses is going to be holding the Commandments and I see this in my mind but the only way to get this expressed out is to make it I've got to have a slab of granite and I've got to make this expression that I have in my mind and I've got to form it and I've got to work it and I'm gonna spend time on it now if we could have a better light it's better up here so you see the the the the detail intricately in there and you see this I read this one time this tendon in Moses's arm because his pinky over here see his pinky on the tablet is moved that pinky is the pinky that moves that tendon so if your hand was in that position that's exactly how your forearm would look you see the attention to detail that Michelangelo would put into this statue because he's the artist and he's seen this expression in his mind and he's so he wants a detail just perfectly now if Michelangelo an artist out there somewhere that probably didn't even know God or have a relationship with God but just wanted to make a statue of Moses now if an Earthly artist could have that attention to detail how much more the great artist in your life has paid attention to every detail that you are every thought that you've had every concern in your mind every complex that you deal with every fear you have the great artist has focused in on your life and he's aware of every detail because he made you exactly like he saw you in his mind he's the great artist he's the great artist that is coming he's created a beautiful bouquet of his artworks he's created a beautiful a slogan for his Works in this age this is Michelangelo's advertisement to the world of his what he thought Moses would look like right now I remember I remember driving down the road in Arizona and driving down uh from Tucson to Phoenix and on the side of the road there there's nothing to see it's just flattened you think Ohio's flat but that section of road is beyond flat there's nothing to do on that road but look around there's a billboard there on the side of the road and it says Divine Healing question mark this is 10 15 years ago I'm old it caught my attention Divine Healing and it just said William branham.org at the bottom I thought about that message but the Brandon preached we was driving along and he said there was billboard after billboard after billboard or just you know smut and advertisements and all the things of the world he said he got across this billboard and it just said hungry and it caught his attention because it was he was hungry there was an advertisement that grasped his attention and somebody thought of this advertisement to grasp the attention of people and they they create it in their mind an artist or what do they call them a marketing marketing somebody help me marketing something and and that marketing agent or whatever he is whatever his official job title is thinks of these ad slogans and he puts them on billboards now he spends all this time and all this money and all this effort and all this energy and he puts this giant billboard out there on the side of the road and he's made it exactly like he was and you know what brother Samuel sometimes we have to go into some inner cities somewhere or even on the other side of the world and you know what happens is this beautiful artwork that somebody has put out there somebody never fails sneaks in there and Graffitis over the top of this beautiful artwork you imagine if you were to go to the Louvre and you found the Mona Lisa and had graffiti over it and somebody has snuck in there not to steal it but to pain over the top of it and we see these train cars that were made and they go by and you guys live here in the hitting the Rust Belt you know and you see the Train the trains go by and you see the graffiti art going by and the graffiti and the graffiti well the guy that made that train never intended it for had to have big bubble words on the side of it but he intended it for the original message that was in there but somebody has stuck in and graffitied over the top of the original message that's underneath that now the message is still underneath on that billboard the original expression of that artist is still there but it's covered up with graffiti let me say to you tonight young person that there's an original expression of you that's in the mind of God and you're still that way in his mind if I could say it like this God took a perfect picture of you before there was sin before there was depression before there was anxiety before there was fear before there was a longing in your heart before there was any disappointments in your life God took a perfect picture of you and that's the way he sees you but what has happened is somebody has snuck in in the middle of the night and begin to Graffiti over your life and begin to say your name is depressed or your name is fearful or your name is not Overcomer or your name is uh just didn't have enough or your name is never gonna make it you see and the devil has come in and he's engraved over the top of the original message you see that's why we fight this in this age that the message is still the supreme authority because somebody has graffitied over the top of what really God's Prophet came to say and begin to apply their own paint over the top of the original message but they're still an original message under there we've just got to wash away the graffiti now the interesting thing about this is as those paintings are made with oil it's an oil type paint that they put down there and then somebody with the latex water-based paint has come over and sprayed over the top of that but that oil paint cannot be just washed away that oil paint cannot be wiped away with that water paint if you get enough of alcohol you get that rag a little bit hot that water-based paint will begin to come off so you see there's a real you under there under this under this this false accusation the accuser of our Brethren has accused us day and night before God spray painting over our lives to say you're this is the label you're going to wear well I think the Devil is a label maker he wants to label the church and call us holy rollers or call us up man followers or profit worshipers or he wants to label the church I don't care what the devil labels me his labels are not permanent like I say like that the label that the devil would put on the church is not the way God sees the church but God sees you as he thought of you in his mind and no matter what the devil would write over you there's still an original you there does that make sense so as as we go we can say it like this there's a canvas of our life and that canvas can read the word of Our Testimony and that word might say you might have walked in that door and that word tonight would say complexed fearful ashamed it says thirsty gone too far but that's not the original message that's not who you are there's another you underneath that there's another word of testimony under there am I making sense Church there's another Mark that's been made there there's another part of your testimony ye are our epistle written in our hearts known in red of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart so if I could say break it down Paul's words here brother Ben you have a table a billboard on the inside of your heart that ink cannot touch how would you ever tattoo on the inside of your heart but there's a place there for a word to be written there that an ink pen cannot touch and the ink pen cannot access that but it's an advertisement a billboard that only one person can get to that place in your heart so the devil might have put tattoos over the top of your chest and you might have a tattoo here I'll pray young people don't but if the devil got you and you do it doesn't mean you're not saved or you're not going to make it or you're not worthy but there's another Mark that was already there before that tattoo ever came and that Mark was put there before the foundation of the world by the almighty God and he didn't just write it with ink but he wrote it in blood so now we see that it's by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony they shall overcome now I asked the church tonight who wants to be an overcomer who wants to overcome the devil on every opposition that he's given you in your life every fear he's planted in your mind every lie he's ever told you we will overcome him why because we have the blood of the lamb and the Word of Our Testimony so I would say tonight take your canvas and wash it you might have come in here and said I'm never I'm not bright material I'm never going to make it this just isn't for me but wash that off wash that canvas off and say I'm not going to take what the devil put on me but I'm gonna clean my slate tonight by the blood of the Lamb I'm washing away what the devil put on me I'm washing away at the LIE the devil has told me my whole life that I would not make it or I would not achieve this whoever told you that let me just ask the young folks in here tonight who told you that you would not make a rapture does your parents ever tell you that no did your pastor ever tell you that no did God ever tell you that no so we know where it came from it's a lie it's a bluff of the devil it's a lie let me just say that the prophet of our age had to go through the same battle right he comes out of that vision and there's a demon in his room and it says you don't have the power over me and many of us would think brother what would you think if a demon came in your room and it spoke to you and said you don't have the power over me if we don't know where we stand then we'd back up in the corner and we'd be afraid and we'd be fearful because that's that's a that's a fourth dimensional being speaking to us and it puts us in fear in check and even it happened to the prophet and he said he got he got back and he said devil you see he was calling brother Bama Bluff and that's what he was so the devil is saying that you're not going to make the Rapture because he's not going to make the Rapture the devil is telling you that you don't have enough Faith because he didn't have enough Faith the devil is telling you that you're unworthy unrighteous Unholy because he's unworthy unrighteous Unholy the devil is telling you that you're never going to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost the way that you want it because he's never received the baptism the Holy Ghost the way that he wants it you see he's he's a bluff and he's accusing us of his own sin and trying to paint that label over our life but we never did it in the first place the devil painted that over your life the devil told you that was going to be the end of your story The Devil told you that no no man from the pulpit ever told you that you're not gonna have enough to make it but we're here to encourage the faith of the people to say you're going to make it friend there's enough room at the cross for you there's enough blood amen so what the devil turned on you you turned right back on him and brother random rose up in faith and he said devil you're a bluff and you're an offense to me get thee behind me and you see the Devil Went you see he's got no power he's got no Power in the Blood because he has not applied the token well he can't that devil has told you you can't do it he can't do it recognize where it's coming from God did not come down in this age is this all right brother Samuel can I have some Liberty with this God did not come down in this age and keep a man away from alcohol and smoking and keep his life pure and and keep him away from all the influences of the world and use them in a mighty way and give him three pulls and give him signs in his life and come visit him over over the river and commission him to fulfill the work of John the Baptist for the coming bride to come to go through all that brother Ben can you imagine God go through all that to save a man to preach a message to tell me that I'm not going to make it what do we read when we read the message do we read judgment and condemnation fear do we read accusation do we read that there's just there's just we're just not going to make it there's no way we could ever make it is that what we read when we read the message brother Ray that's not what I read when I read the message you know what I read I read the message of Grace that I was The Sinner unworthy and should not be here where I am today but God rich and mercy came to where I am and I read that it's Grace Grace Grace to our age brother Branham is Elijah to the age but he's also zerubbabel crying Grace Grace Grace Grace it's the message message of grace to the church so wash off your sign that said guilty and unforgivable and write Grace over the top of it it's all Grace it's God's grace and God God has inscribed Grace on the table of your heart before there was a sin remember I will say it like this God beat that lying Spirit to you that lying Spirit that's bothered you it was he started my Old Testament prophets that lying Spirit but I'm gonna bring it down home the lying spirit that you battle with your entire life God beat that Spirit to you there's something underneath the label let me just say this you remember brother Samuel do you ever have a whole set of them read books the red books I was I was I kind of got in the ministry too late and I missed the window for the red books my dad had a set of red books and this was before everybody had the computer and the table and this was back in the folio days and you had to know a guy who knew a guy that had a computer to go search the message right the kids were blessed we are blessed in this age you see what's happened is it's not you don't have to rely on me just saying the quotes that I want to say but you can go read it for yourself you can go rightly divide the words yourself and read what the prophet actually said not just the parts I want you to hear before your time but that's what we had to endure but we're blessed and so there was this red book for the shame it was the seventh seal book my dad's one of my dad's favorite books duct taped you know just man he read that thing back and forth back and forth noted it all up you know well one day it went missing one day was gone I think it was probably two years it was missing went over to another brother's house in another state and we're visiting there having lunch brother's got a bookshelf and he's got all the red volumes my dad goes over there oh I was looking for a quote the other day do you mind if I read your seven sealed book and without even waiting for the guy to say yes he grabs it off the shelf and he starts flipping through it I said man that's a good note man you made a note right Ryan made a note you you you man you got you highlighted the same parts that I highlighted I'm beginning to get a little weird in the room I was just a little kid but I could feel that it got a little weird in the room my dad says this looks just like my handwriting there's a flip to the book this is my handwriting flips to the front of the book sure enough it says this brother's name right there in the book but there's a little peeling on the label it says this brother's name right on this book he said I'm sure that's my handwriting I'm sure those are my notes so he begins to peel back the label and that brother had put a label of his name right over the top of my dad's name and they're friends I mean they keep in touch regular bases back then or so you think but the devil's not your friend the devil's not your buddy that was my dad's book that somebody just came and put their name right over the top of it you imagine somebody just taking your your Milwaukee battery on a job site and you've got your name engraved on there and somebody come write their name and Sharpie right over it but you know if they take the battery out and on the inside of that on the inside of the thing you took the time to engrave your name there so there was a name there before the thief got a hold of it and there's a name on you before depression got a hold of you and there's a name on you before a live Spirit got a hold of you there's a name on you before defeat got a hold of you there's a name on the church before the devil got a hold of you and wanted to paint you as a Holy Roller or a Pentecostal or a wildfire I don't care what label you put on me there's already a label on me by God Almighty he said I'm worthy he said I'm chosen he said I'm elected he sent him the apple of his eye he says I'm Without Blame without spot without wrinkle that's what I read when I read the message I don't read condemnation I don't read fear I don't read remorse I don't read regret I read victory I read Victory and they overcame by the blood of the Lamb washing their slate clean washing their clean now brother Ben if we don't dip in that house up and dip it in that blood and wash it over our door posts it ain't gonna do no good we've got a clean slate tonight come under the Fountain of the water of repentance and you have a clean slate tonight whatever you've been through whatever you've done thought or said it don't matter because there's still breath in your lungs so you have the same right to repentance that there ever was even from when you were a child the same innocence to come under the repentance of God's blood and say I'm sorry well now you have a clean slate what are you going to do with it if David or Joshua excuse me if Joshua would have just left that bucket of blood in there and you thought God provided this blood sacrifice for us and the Death Angel is going to come here but I don't feel like going outside and applying it I don't want to be identified with this blood that Death Angel would have come right in his house and taken his life and any other firstborn's life in that room but Joshua didn't think that Joshua thought there's a bucket of blood here I've got some simple Faith here I'm going to dip it in this blood and I'm gonna go out and I'm going to wash the dark post I'm gonna wash it over here wash it over here you know if you ever paint it there's a hard time to stop you just want to finish the whole wall I believe Joshua just took that and he kept dipping it in there and he kept dipping it in there you know what it never ran out every time he dipped it in there there was more blood and he dipped it again and there was more blood I think Joshua's whole house was red by the time he was done because he wanted to be sure that the death angel knew he was one of the few and I think we should be so short tonight that nobody would have to ask us what we believe or who we are or what we think about this message called Christ but it would be so thoroughly identified across our life Lord let your blood paint me tonight and you have a word to write on the table of your heart there's a word there a name above every other name written on the table of your heart and it's written there by Blood now when John saw his name written in the Lamb's Book of Life it wasn't so much that John just saw his name there I thought Glory Hallelujah I'm gonna make it but John had a revelation to know that when he saw his name revealed in the book it was attached to every promise that was in that book hey baby oh his benefits John thought of that all his benefits so it's not so much that it gets me excited well this brother's trying to work me up well I've seen my name revealed so I'm pretty worked up I realize that God came to me in this age and he's called me by name and he's called me out of denomination and he's called me out of the fear of the world and he set me in a higher place not to cast me down but to receive me into his kingdom so yes I'm pretty worked up and I'm not trying to work you up but I'm trying to get you where I'm at come up higher John recognize that your name has already been written in the last book of life before the graffiti ever got there before the mistake ever got there before the defeat ever got there before the depressive Spirit ever attacks your mind your name was already there it cannot be erased removed you can't run from it you can't shake it because God thought of you you're the expression of the great artist the artist has expressed his thoughts Anna Marie and she would come in the end age I have a thought Samuel he would come in the end age have a thought Brian and he would come in the end of age now who are we to go back to the great artists and say I don't like the way you made me I don't like how you gave me this or you made me short or you made me white or you made me brown or you made me how were we to go to complain to the great artist we're in the picture it's pretty good we're in the picture we have a seat at the table who are we to go and complain to the great the great king who's invited us to this banquet and he spread out everything that he owns and he spread out this great table further than you can see and you're gonna sit down you're gonna say well Chick-fil-A is better I know Chick-fil-A guys believe that's what we'll be eating there it'll be better than that but who are we to say can you imagine if I go to this this is just brother what's your name Jonathan I go to Jonathan's house tonight and we eat dinner and Jonathan's out of the kindness of his heart is invited me to eat dinner and I show up to his house and I say well I wish you would have made this Jonathan probably wouldn't invite me back well I really like my potatoes like this well Jonathan's probably not invited me back wouldn't that be really rude wouldn't that be pretty arrogant of me to go to his house and expect something different than what he's provided for me to think that I know better than him what I need well how arrogant is it of us to go complain to God that he made us the way he saw us in his mind informed us exactly the way he wanted us with the inabilities that we have with the abilities that we have with the complexes that we carry with the Mind battles that we fought and I said we say we wish you you wouldn't have made us like this but God designs you exactly as he thought of you in his mind and he said I need a perfect little piece that'll fit right in there and he thought of you and you came into existence and there you are the perfect picture of what God saw in his mind now this picture takes some time if I can say it like this I have all these quotes but for time's sake the photographer takes a picture is there any photographers in the room no I'm not either okay so this this photographer takes a picture or Brother Ray now we live in the days of instant right we see that picture immediately on our phone no I don't like it let's take another one I just can't get it to look good brother Ray take another one you see we live in the day of instant but when the word was written it wasn't instant age so God took a perfect picture of this service of you in your struggle and your inability and your questions in your mind and he's taking a picture of this but ma'am said before the foundation of the world he took a perfect picture of you now perfect doesn't just go to anything perfect only applies to when it meets the requirement of the artist's mind and God takes this perfect picture of you but it's got to develop you know they used to take the picture and I don't know if any young people probably don't know what I'm talking about you know what I'm talking about they take a picture in the dark room okay so they used to take a picture and it would have an image magnetized on it and they would have to develop it in a dark room right and in that dark room it began to come out now the photographer is the only one who knows what the picture looks like because he's the one who snapped the shot and he snapped this picture but it takes time to develop the results of that picture now there's people outside the door waiting I want to see my picture I want to I want to see my wedding picture back in the old black and white days you know take a picture be weeks before they developed the photo and you'd be wondering where's my picture at he's developing it in the dark room and begins to come in it begins to have a little image to it because they have a little structure around it I can see brother Ray's wearing a blue shirt and the picture begins to develop as I have taken it and so you're coming into the development of the original picture of the perfect picture now maybe maybe you don't understand what I'm saying because the dark room thing I didn't take this into account talking to people that wouldn't know the smartphones how photography works you know what I'm talking about okay I got one so they lay this down in this dark room and while this is going on there's no seemingly results taking place it's just laying in this water in times going on and they apply a little light and they apply a little more dark and they apply a little light and they begin to wash it in this water and they shake it take it out and hold it up to the light yeah it's developing nice put it back in the water but all this time the photographer knows what the picture looks like he knows exactly what he has snapped a photo of and he's just waiting for it to come to manifestation God took a perfect picture of you before there ever was a trial in your life before you ever had a mind battle Gideon God took a picture of you of exactly what you would look like in total Victory and he snapped that picture now it takes some time for that development to come in and that's this age that we're living in and this this battles that we're going through it's the development of God's perfect picture in our life but God has you perfected in his mind and that development is coming out in this age we are coming to the finalization of all things the pictures are developed I'm looking at the pictures I'm looking at the very sister I'm looking at a thought of God I'm looking at the mind of God expressed in this age that God thought of you so much that he spoke you into existence before the foundation of the world and he called you by name and developed you exactly like he saw you in his mind you are the thought of God look at your neighbor and say I'm an expressed thought of God I'm an Express thought of God you didn't have a neighbor Express thought of God has never made a mistake God has never misplaced a thought now you all agreed it committed with me on this journey that all of God's thoughts are eternal so if you are a thought of God and I believe that you are and you've got to believe that you are that you're the expressed attribute of God you will never have an end there will never be an end to Jonathan there will never be an answer Benjamin why because you're a thought of God in the thoughts of God can have no end so I say it's time to rip off the label of defeat and of Despair enough I don't have enough faith and I'm confused in this age tear that label off tonight young person and put what God said about you God said I know the thoughts that I dig towards you and they are thoughts of peace thoughts of Victory thoughts of overcoming power thoughts of Holy Ghost possession thoughts of overcoming every enemy anytime anywhere those are the thoughts that I think towards you I think it's time we wear the label that God put on us wash it with the blood of the Lamb tonight say I'm writing a new name I'm writing a new label here I'm writing victory over mine brother what are you gonna write over yours Victory right Victory right over right over where there was defeat when he came in he's riding victory tonight right over that word why because God has made us free and if he's made us free we are free indeed so why would we walk out defeated why would we walk out now to bring this to a close here when the artist is done he looks back at his work I like it it's very good I like what I've done very good work yeah yeah it's the exact expression of what I had in my mind I imagine that artist he's poured himself into that he's poured all that he was into that creation and he's he's taking the time and just look at that tendon we saw and he's he's formed that you know how much that must have taken to form that he looks at this how I saw it in my mind you know the last thing that artist does he signs it signs his name to it he signs his name right there I'm so pleased with what I've created I'm gonna sign my name oh I'm gonna sign my name right there I'm gonna sign it it's my perfect creation it's exactly the way that I saw it in my mind I'm gonna seal it I'm gonna put my signature on it the God doesn't just sign his name to anything but he only signs his name to that which he is well pleased this is my son Zachary I'm well pleased I'm gonna sign him adoption the signing of a name this is my son Chase I'm well pleased I'm gonna sign him and God begins to say it's a finished work it's finished it's finished it's finished the art piece that I see in my mind I don't think that we should be ashamed of how God created us Brother Ray we shouldn't be ashamed of how God made us but he was so confident in us that he signed his name I made you this way Sister Kim I made you this way I'm gonna sign my name I'm putting my reputation on the line and you know why he can put his reputation on the line because he made every part of you with Elijah he made you exactly the way you are and then he signed and said it's sealed delivered go on he's not looking back why would we man if you come play something why would we why would we look back at God's creation of us and think that we can perfect it somehow let me just say sisters God Made You More Beautiful in his mind than Vanity Fair or then Sephora could ever imagine there's no makeup in the world that could improve what God saw in his mind God formed you exactly the way he wants you you were fearfully and wonderfully made with that word fearfully translated back to the Greek is beautifully you were beautifully and wonderfully made by the craftsmanship of God's hand why would we try to change what God already put his approval on young man you don't need to fit in with the world you don't need to try to fit in with your friends at school God made you exactly the way you are you cannot perfect what God's already perfected the only thing you'll do is put graffiti over the top of it but you know friends some of these older brothers didn't hear older sisters can testify you can try to perfect what God's already created in his mind and all you do is you're covering it up with graffiti [Music] let some elders and hear witness tonight his blood is able to wash away every bit of graffiti we've put on our life every bit of graffiti we've allowed some man or some woman to give us a complex some some some something way back with a ray maybe when you were just eight or nine years old a complex come into your life that some man put there God's blood is able to wash away even if it's been there for years and years and years God's blood is able to wash it away we've got to apply the token to our life and say I'm starting with a clean slate tonight I'm starting with a clean board let my billboard be washed clean I'm not going to be an advertisement for the devil anymore brother you like sports you know you know who LeBron James is sponsored by Nike you know who Cristiano Ronaldo sponsored by Nike you know who Tiger Woods is sponsored by Nike you know what Nike means victory now LeBron James is not allowed to wear a Reebok shirt right he's sponsored by Nike that means Nike has provided all of his Provisions in life to the tune of I think 200 million dollars they gave him to be their spot he's they're giving him free stuff and 200 million dollars so that he would wear their label because they know he's going to produce victory now LeBron James has signed a contract with Nike that he's not allowed to wear any other brand he's not allowed to wear Reebok or Fila or And1 or Adidas or he's not allowed to wear anything else he's only allowed to wear Nike brother bam told us that Christ has come and sponsored you he's come and made the provisions for you he's come and gave you everything that you need let me say that once you have signed the contract to take on the sponsorship of Christ you are not entitled to where anybody else's brand you are not able to wear anybody else's shirt or anybody else's word you have sold out to the sponsorship of Jesus Christ and his word is only Victory his word is only Overcomer his word is only freed and forgiven his word is only gonna make it Rapture material his word only says yes you are not allowed to come in here and wear defeat on your shirt you're not allowed to come in here and where I'm not going to make it I'm depressed I'm anxious I'm gonna have a panic attack you're not allowed to wear that on your shirt you're only allowed to wear Victory you're only allowed to where I'm free free free LeBron James is contractually bound he can't wear anybody else's label for the shame he can only wear Nikes so friends if you haven't signed up for the sponsorship tonight where are you there's a there's a God here there's the Holy Ghost here he's not lesser than God we're not trinitarians the Holy Ghost is not less than God himself but the Holy Ghost is here tonight and he's got a contract here for you to sign I'll sponsor you the rest of your life and even on into eternity I've engraved you there I've been I've been grooming you I've been training you I've prepared you I've put in you everything that you're going to need to overcome in this age you just need to sign the document and when you sign the document old ones testify with me when you sign the document he is always faithful he is always provided he has always come through he has always made a way it's God that God that's provided to build money it's got to give you food when you were hungry it's God that heals you when you were sick it's God that gave you the courage to keep on keeping on it's God that you're here tonight he's never let us down he's still Jehovah Jireh our provider we're sponsored by Jehovah Nissi Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Rapha his sponsorship is on the table of my heart I cannot wear another name foreign [Applause] there and engraved it on the table of my heart I can't wear another name [Applause] delivered forgiven you did it in the first place you've never questioned me you've never doubted me I never saw it all I saw was the blood [Music] [Applause] we should give him thanks tonight let me just ask you don't hold anything back from praising him tonight he's come down and delivered him and set you free he sponsored you if you haven't signed it sign it tonight and if you've already signed it you've got much to be thankful for ever [Music] keep foreign [Music] [Music] oh he knows that falls [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh what a promise he calls us his own for she calls me his heart he'll never leave you [Music] oh no matter where I go [Music] and he knows my name [Music] and he sees each tear that falls and I have a savior [Music] oh he born [Music] to set me free [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] every thought Hallelujah for when he says [Music] she knows my Hallelujah the signals you know God didn't just sign his name anywhere but he only signed it where he would be confident that it would return back to him that you would make the right decision at the right time in your life he put his name there because he knew the choice you would make in your life that you would run back to him because that's where you came from so he signed you and he said at the appointed time they'll make the right decision for I have already chosen them and put my name upon the table of their heart so God knows where you're at tonight he knows exactly where you're at he only did that because he had the confidence in you he put his name on the three Hebrew children because he knew they had what it took to Not Bow their knee before any Idol to Not Bow their knee behind any man appointed God they would not bow to none other than the word and the word itself and he put his name upon them brother Shane he just cast him out there rotor to say hey fend for yourself but they went into the hottest place that there ever was let me say laodicea is the hottest age that there's ever been in this thing called time and you're right in the middle of it right now you're at the hottest part of the hottest age but God was so confident in you the scripture says having all confidence so confident in you that he sent you here anyway [Music] think about that sis he sent you here anyway because he knew the choice you would follow him [Music] he knew that you say I don't care what the world thinks I don't care what my mom dad think I don't care what my brother's sister think I don't care what the person next to me thinks I only care what God thinks about me I only care what Christ has already written on the table of my heart and you know what happened to them [Music] the air turned on LeBron said there's a man in here that can turn on the air and he says that same man was there with them children in that fire and that air turned on he said they didn't feel a wave of heat they didn't feel a bit of smoke they didn't feel a little bit of Despair they weren't anxious they weren't nervous they weren't beside themselves because they witnessed the Fourth Man in the fire with him let me say it doesn't just stand for the children of Israel back then but that Fourth Man is still here in the church today he's still here in the middle of the fire and let me say what happens when somebody steps on fire you ever stepped on a coal of Fire you feel it you ever step in a coal of fire you feel that under your feet and you know that you're standing on something you should not be standing on but they rejoiced on that coal of fire they rejoiced standing there on the sacrificial altar because they knew the sacrifice had already been met and they were already free they were already home they were already rejoicing well there's a man in here tonight that could turn it on David said Thy word is a light up to my path in Atlanta to my feet you know what that means I know where I'm going my past lighted friends I'm not despair Why Should I Worry why should I be despair I have a father he knows my name he knows where I've he knows everything about me what I thought in my mind what I've questioned what I've and you know what he sees the blood somebody say they somebody say we we overcame the Dragon by the blood of the lamb and the word of Our Testimony let me say that the word of Our Testimony is none other than overcoming power none other than Holy Ghost none other than Grace none other than Mercy we're not going to make it with anything less but we've got to say what he said about us I think it's time we lay down what mama said about you what Dad said about you what the pastor said about you what your old Pastor said about you and say what God has already said about you lay down what you've said about you and let God do the speaking for you but the blood speaking better things than we would speak for ourself let the blood do the talking tonight Hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and he came to set me free [Music] and he knows my name and he knows my everything [Applause] [Music] [Applause] yes he knows my name and he knows who's my everything and he sees [Music] when I call oh yes he hears me when I call Hallelujah the empty and broken [Music] I came back to him [Music] [Music] but he did not despair he started over again and our bless the day he is away and it's over to [Music] fashions I am today and it's all because Jesus sing this last verse if you'd like prayer tonight we'd certainly be happy to pray with you brother Ronnie would we would love love to pray with you I believe God is mindful tonight God has spoke so perfectly and so tenderly and so specifically amen you know that dark room at one point in time I had a privilege I took a class in photography back when I was in high school and it was an actual room you went in and it you could not turn on any lights matter of fact you know sometimes with teenagers we different ones would see so and so go in and the instructors over there and they'd want to kind of come and maybe try to open the door and I'll tell you you got in trouble because the uh the film was expensive and it was you know they kind of made it old school for us so we had to go through and like brother Ronnie said you dipped it in this solution you know like the buckets that were you or the tubs we use for communion foot washing young people you know we're talking about them for foot washing it's like tubs like that but they're a little bit shallower you dip it in there take it out Bring it dip it over here rinse it hold it up then you dip it back in here you got to keep doing that then eventually you clip it up then you got to leave class only 50 minutes long you come back the next day and you trust you're going to see something you you can't wait to see a woman here's a product but it's like how the Lord was bringing that through brother Ronnie the greatest thing about you and I is being able to recognize God in our lives and to recognize God has something of his image that he wants to bring out of your life and he might have to take it through this and he brings it but he's the one at work because he already knows what's going to come forth I know even the young people maybe don't remember I thought when brother Ronnie was talking about I always think about when brother Grant talks about that Polaroid I can't hear the picture I was thinking about Polaroid and Polaroid was like a big thing for us brother Nathaniel am I too old for you on that one you remember Polaroid do you remember that man I thought that was cool you you didn't have to wait on the on the on the the photo you just spit out you take the picture [Music] but it was gray when it spit you would lay it on a table and you had to wait but you could sit there and look at that Polaroid picture and you can start oh I'm starting to see what's your name oh I'm starting to see Gabriel's head wow you see God already took the picture God's not surprised God's like there they are coming forth there they are coming forth they're beginning to my word they're saying yes though the spirit is saying yes and they're starting to say yes and it's coming forth and oh I'm seeing myself I'm it's developing the prince of God moving encouraging us strengthening us it's God developing his thoughts in you and me aren't you I'm just glad to be a part of the picture I don't care if I'm the guy when they take one of them pictures I don't care if I'm the guy clear at the back and you know you can barely see my head and I got to stand on my tiptoes to be I don't care I'm in the picture I don't matter I'm in the picture amen and I mean I'm in the picture amen you're in the picture you're in the picture as we

slate and now take the blood apply the blood apply the word you watch the word it'll just continue to change your life see it's already started a change because it's all it's see it changes your thoughts you realize many times the things sometimes we wonder why thoughts come thoughts are spirits and things that we have to evaluate is is even after you come out of a meeting like this there's things that you you need to put right away and say Lord there's things that I don't want to give any more time to that would hinder you're working in my life I don't want to open myself up to anything else I want to open myself to you God you've come and spoke to me tonight he's the one that's dismissed right here tonight he's dismissed thoughts and he's given you the authority to dismiss those thoughts of what you think about yourself you can say well I know the person I see in the mirror but God knows as was spoke tonight what's in you he knows what he put in you and the authority of his word his living presence has given you a confidence tonight to be able to put that behind you now at this moment apply that word apply the blood even as you go forth out of this this service in this meeting just keep walking on with the Lord go forward you know there's no sound of retreat you keep going forward I think tonight there's things if there's a service to come back to I God put it to me and I don't to me it's profound to me when I say things are simple it's because God made them simple it that this is this is a great big thought but God has come down and God has made this simple tonight to where that we can you can take this with you and if there's one thing brother Ronnie said there's a scripture we are to have on your uh refrigerator that's where I go a lot on the mirror or wherever you go Psalms 139 I know the thoughts I think concerning you maybe you need to write that on the back of your phone maybe you need to you know don't don't cover up your rearview mirror but maybe you need to put the little bit of Peace on that on that part of it right there maybe you need to put it on where the blind spots are at on your car I know the thoughts that I think concerning you thoughts of peace that bring you to an expected end oh my I tell you it's a living God right Among Us that's bringing certainty in our lives in an hour of uncertainty it's his presence coming that brings certainty don't you love him amen how many you can say right here Lord I'm more determined I'm more determined God help me give me Lord let me have the patience as it's developing everything in my life God's got it all you know it's just like many times like that seed that God put in you it's like a suitcase when you get somewhere every one of us have been somewhere you've been at youth camps or whatever more and you have to pack up to go home and you got to make sure you take all your clothes home because mom's gonna be asking about them but you wonder how did Mom pack this suitcase how it's in there that's the same way in your life God has everything done to that seed and God begins to unzip that and he begins to take things out of your life and don't worry he has an outfit for every occasion God has every thing just in its right season just let him unfold him let him unpack it his grace is sufficient don't you love him I just want I want to keep looking at the picture I want to as I'm staring at the picture you say what's the picture it's the message of the hour and as I'm looking at that I start looking at it I'm seeing me I'm seeing me more clearly I'm seeing me oh my more clearly more clearly so when a thought comes and you put on a message and you feel like I didn't get nothing that's not true because God's word is taking effect upon your life as you just give yourself to the Lord God develops his thoughts in your life amen brother Ronnie thank you for yielding to the Lord tonight thank you and I I can say that I thoroughly I thoroughly was blessed tonight thoroughly was blessed maybe I should have had a seat belt on back there but I was thoroughly blessed God is so good isn't he God is so good amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer amen we
