uh you know many I don't know if I shared this with you but uh you know to me when I see the you know the young people those because everybody has a talents this maybe our maybe our talent isn't playing or you know singing I mean and when it comes to playing I'm just glad somebody can play that's not that's beyond me but uh just like when it comes to computers if I run into a snag I've got a little bit better with it but if I run into something my brother-in-law knows he's getting a call right now I just I just need to be able to get my study program my bible program is working and that's I'm just that's I'm good right there you know but um I just am so thankful you know and I don't know if I'd mentioned this to you or not but you know when you you see during the youth meetings you see all of them up here playing well they uh they used to did I tell this already I don't know if I did or not but when they used to we actually have videos of it when they would come over and they would come over and uh visit well they had their own little church in our basement and so they would have services and they all were playing instruments and of course you know they really weren't playing instruments but they were and uh they were having church and I don't remember who was the preacher and Ben was oh Ben was the preacher and I don't remember who got converted every service you know but uh it just uh you know to me I I sat back there many times and I just look at the things you know with uh even when we have the youth meetings and I see that and I think man that went from our basement to to hear so I just I really appreciate you know to me uh every young person that my I I just uh I I think it's just tremendous to serve the Lord I really do and I to me I've said that in our youth meeting there uh these young people and uh I I just so to me I think I say my you guys are Beyond where I was at and I really appreciate where their their stand is at and in the midst of this age and I tell you if they ever need our encouragement and our that a boy this is the hour amen and that's that's what I want to be found doing I want to be like David that's by the edge of the battle saying come on we can do it we can do it we can do it amen so I didn't mean to hold you all up here long enough and embarrass you and I appreciate brother Jonathan he's had a rough way to go on that today cuz we had to some things had to get fixed on there but we appreciate brother Jonathan you always stepping in there always appreciate that amen and of course my my mother-in-law how do you like that I even called you that I tease her I love her I tell you couldn't ask for a better mother-in-law she's the best mother-in-law I've got brother Ricardo amen well we can just hand our roses all around but we've got to move into the uh move on into the ministry of the word but it's so good to see different ones of you I know that are back and man it's good to be it's good to feel good isn't it yes it is I tell you some different ones that we've battled sickness and so may God bless you uh let the musicians uh be seated um also I want to as we're turning to the scriptures Colossians chapter 3 and you pray for my wife she's going to be running these slides here today I told her I told her last night I said if you need me to create if I would wanted me to create a a a PowerPoint or something like that I can do that uh it just takes a whole lot more time but I don't know if you know it this program here the way brother Bryant brother Bryan actually took the program and he has wrote a back part to it to where all I have to do is I space my notes I just copy put them there and it totally orders the whole thing on slides so brother Brian has just painstakingly I drop it and it goes clear into the cloud comes right into that computer so I tell you I really love my brother-in-law I really miss him I really do brother Brian is just he and sister Sue and their family my goodness we're not even going to get in the word today amen we love you Colossians chapter 3 verse 1 and I'm going to read just few four verses of scripture and then we'll then we'll let you be seated if you then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sth on the right hand of God set your affection on things above not on things on the earth I want you to notice there's a measure of this of responsibility that comes to you and I as children of God oh yes when the New Birth has come even when God dealing with your life before the depth of that has moved in in our life it's already him drawing us to him in a love affair then when it steps in on the inside now the love of God is what is taken preeminence in our life but it's just like in even in a natural marriage you can't let things die are you with me I got a little quiet quiet there brother bradam you'll hear him say it over and over he says never let that honeymoon cease if he says never let it do it then it means there's a possibility it can happen so that's the same thing within our walk with God now once you're sealed you're sealed but let me just say this right here when we stand there on that day and and if you're sealed with the spirit of God you're not going to come to the white Throne judgment but every one of us will have to appear before the Judgment seat of Christ and give a account for the Deeds Done in this body and for when God would say why not why weren't you why wasn't this a priority why didn't this happen so I'm not after rewards I just want more of him if if I have if there's nothing that at the end of it but me just to be able to say I've given my life entirely for his glory that's it'll be worth it all amen verse three for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God when Christ who is our life I love that shall appear then shall ye also appear with him brother Bram takes this thought in invisible Union of the bride of Christ and I just want you to just listen to this thought and he's telling letting the people know the direction of this of that message and he says this is to the church the body of Christ that we're trying to lead to deeper thoughts and higher objectives believing that the coming of the Lord Jesus is at hand and he goes on there in that statement and he says I'm not looking for Revival in our generation I'm looking for the coming of the Lord in our generation that's why brother brandham could say he says they'll never never be anything greater than this he said some are looking for something super duper he said you're looking for the wrong thing yes sir is that right God gives one gift that gift to a generation and so now if we put this in perspective with Revival that doesn't mean there's no move of God what it means what the prophet is saying here is is that there's not going to be a national Revival we're not going to be going oh this city oh this this college this is having a Revival no remember what real Revival is Revival isn't a isn't a gathering isn't an emotional workup Revival is a call back to the word that's true Revival that's so true Revival is not emotion right true Revival is where the love of God burning in hearts and where the trash and everything of the world that's taking place gets washed out yeah that's that's for Revival So within this he says I'm not looking for a Revival in our generation he's not as far as for the church world the church world is not going to have a Revival sometimes there can be things that looks like great moves but a re a real Revival is getting back to God fully back to the word abely is that right Israel could pack around the Scrolls but they didn't have the word of the Lord is that right but when the word of the Lord come then it brings you back to the word so to have this of a of a Revival didn't say we couldn't individually have Revival I believe we ought to as a matter of fact the prophet said stay in Revival and he says like this keep life in you stay in the spirit of Revival Hallelujah and let me just say this to you the bride's Revival is not something that just started a year ago two years ago or three years ago the bride's Revival is around the word and when the seals were taken off that's when the bride's Revival begin so the bride's Revival is not chasing after sign chasing after a Wonder chasing up no though the bride's Revival is an inward reality between Christ and his people are you hearing me I could give a go a number of quotes on that but I'm just saying this is where we're at and it's that's what's taking place and this is what we're looking for the coming of the Lord and I'm not just looking for oh I I you know I'm I'm just looking for my loved ones I am but if I'm looking for that then I'm looking for him in the decision I need to make for tomorrow I'm looking for the coming of the Lord why I want his Blessing and his leadership in every step of the way yes sir because I want everything to lead into the coming of the Lord I'm looking for his coming in this service I want him to come in this service I want him to come and fill lives and change hearts and heal the sick I'm looking for the coming of the lord we are people that are looking for the coming of the Lord amen God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I want to speak here at just a few moments and I know when I say that you probably say yeah right but I want to speak a few moments here on uh we'll see how far we get uh but I'd like to speak on changing priorities and forsaking excuses in uh Colossians CH 3:1 I read from there but I'd like to read it from the Amplified version it says if then you have been raised with Christ to a new life and thus sharing his resurrection from the dead aim at notice these words this is what that means when it says seek after it's aim at and seek the rich Eternal Treasures that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God in verse two it says and set your minds and keep them set on what is above that's when when it says set your affections that's what it's referring to set your minds on on set them and keep them set on what is above the higher things and not on the things that on are on the earth I don't have to tell you that you know even as you could set here in a service you could be battled to keep your thoughts here that's it doesn't matter who you are it doesn't matter even how say as I'm stand here and ministering and Satan can come he he he comes and attacks me the same way as I'm standing here preaching uh so we know it's a battle and this is something that when we see to keep our minds you see uh the spirit of God comes and he brings Deliverance in our life to lift us to where that uh the Bible will say we are seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so there is a raising up from where we have been and to show that there's been a raising up you can look back in your life and say I'm no longer the same That I Used to Be the things of this world I no longer I I no longer do this I no longer love this my love is to Christ and Christ alone you've raised above the things of the earth now within that remember within our lives as Sons and Daughters of God I I know many times we are looking and think of this in terms of even as the spirit of adoption the holy ghost coming to produce full sunship that God is entrusting little by little to you and I to see how we handle little things like for example when you see when we hear about the prophet speaking to the storm it was not something that he was handed that test right away but there were other things that went little by little as testing grounds Proving Grounds preparing him for that moment and that's the same way it is with our lives God is testing and is proving now let me just say our submission to his voice no more than you could take your child and put their coat on them the Holy Spirit remember he's a gentleman he will not force us to grow up right he will not on our own but it is something that we in our lives out of love must grow up into him in all things and this is why with the scripture as it says right here set your minds and keep them on what is above as I said just moments ago there is the battle the Battlegrounds is constantly in your mind but I want to say this you don't have to live occupied with the things of the world there is a there is a way it's just like this this platform right here it's a space we could so fill this space till not one more thing could get on here pretty close to it now now we could so feel that um like maybe you could feel your pantry and you feel your pantry and you're finally like huh where' I put it let's get a shelf for the basement let's get a shelf for outside see your mind is a No Man's Land you decide what you're going to fill it with you're the one who decide now to me this is where my heart's just that little simple reality I want my mind you say brother Samuel our soul needs to be filled I know that I believe my soul is filled but I want my mind filled with [Music] God because the things you think on create an atmosphere around you is that right now I want you to think of this as we look at this on changing priorities and forsaking excuses brother bam says in the unwelcome Christ remember the the here as he's he's dealing with this of where Jesus was invited to the home of Simon the Pharisee but when they got there they just let him stand there brother Bram says we have other things too that we think more important my brother my sister the most important thing in your life is to entertain Jesus Christ and we believe that right now watch how the prophet places this is how we entertain him the most important thing in any life is to entertain Jesus Christ properly in first place in your worship first place in your life first place in Everything Jesus Christ deserves that place so as our husband it's us running every decision through him not because we're afraid of him not because I'm afraid I'm going to hell I just want to so please him I don't want to do anything that's going to take away from him I don't want anything that's going to extract his presence from my lifej that's what I value more than anything else is his presence it's him it's his word watch how brother Bram says this but if you don't he'll take second place he'll go down in the basement with you if you're ashamed of him when you're out among the people and then you go down in the basement so nobody will see you he'll still come that ought to make you love him above everything in the world why the Jesus Jesus himself he's a gentleman if you give him third place he'll take it if you give him fourth place he'll take it and let me just tell you let me just tell you something right now Jesus don't play shaming games you understand what I'm talking about where you're guilted into something guilted into getting somebody a gift shamed into calling somebody oh my come on now don't sit there you know what I'm talking about we've had things like that that Jesus doesn't do that he doesn't use his word to shame you because you know why right it'll continue to happen he wants you to love him he wants us to love him and sometimes the things that even that we don't even understand the value of but when we obey his voice the the value of that begins to be effectual in our lives because there's nothing greater than obedience obedience is better than any sacrifice we could do that's why Paul said though you could speak with tongue of men and angels though you understand all Mysteries though we give all my all of my goods to feed the poor and have not charity a Heart of Love in obedience to God to his word everything else means nothing now Ephesians 5 and verse1 15 watch how Paul would give direction I'm so thankful to the word of God aren't you I'm thankful I'm thankful for the whole for the light of God upon his word in this hour that we're looking and we see the word of God as our absolute amen I'm thankful to God for that verse 15 see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise let me just remind you this is the Ephesian church this is the church one of this is the church where brother Bram never had to you know talk about how gifts are to operate put gifts in order but listen what Paul did deal with as he did also in colossia each one of those churches had their own individual problems because every church has strengths and weaknesses so when we're looking at this this is that Ephesian uh the Ephesian Church remember this is the church that where some of the depth of of where that we were and our choosing it was in Christ before the foundation of the world but you recognize God himself does not leave us to guess or to wonder but he brings leadership to our lives of how in the midst of all this then we are to conduct our lives and he says you're to walk circumspectly that means diligently that means carefully that means observing and mindful of every step that you're taking you see the spirit of God his desire and this works in our life as Believers as we grow in him every step we make we want to be sure that we're stepping in a bloody footprint of the son of man we want to be sure I don't want to just you know hastily and just do something and say well you know there's forgiveness there's something that moves deeper that I want to be in Step I don't want to have to retract and go back I'm thankful for God's grace to do that but I I don't want to waste time on on that time is too precious it moments if you consider think about this God might have purposed you for this day to be a witness to someone you've never even seen that's why it's important that every single step of the way Lord I want to be in your presence I want to be in that place that Lord that your life can just radiate through me my verse 16 notice what he says Redeeming the time because the days are evil I won't ask you to raise your hands but probably throughout this congregation there is some things that you could be able to look at and say I'd like to get some time back oh yes true and I'm talking not necessarily of going back into the past we we can listen we can all set here as well wishers let me just tell you something a trap of the enemy is to get you trapped looking back in your past of something that you can never go back and change but what you can do is accept God's grace for this moment and he will take the sting and the hurt and all the condemnation and the torment that the devil has tried to bring on your life for past decisions that's what the Lord Jesus will do for youall Hallelujah we want to redeem the time now you know Redemption requires a sacrifice over our lives and seeing even at moments and times in our life when seasons and times where things can become very busy let let me give you an example with the young people at times whether it's been at Retreats camps or right there in the living room they go through Seasons sometimes where you'll find a week of testing and uh I'm talking about school test and and then even when they're uh going to to college and my sometimes it just seems like that the rain is just pouring down but this is the thing that I've mentioned even during that time this is what I found this is what what where I found in my own walk with God and that was it's not always altto together the quantity of time it's the quality that's so good is that right Paul said I would rather speak a few words and they understand than a whole bunch that's so it's not so much quality so we're geared to think quality is approval numbers are approval that we're geared in that way why that comes from that first birth are you hearing me that's good this church that I'm reading for they only had 12 members that's exactly right now what I'm saying is is that in that of redeeming the time this is what I told the young people I said look there's times I said where you take rest of the brid tree what 3 hours 36 minutes h i put that in the tape deck that's when we had cassette tapes if you need to know what that is we'll tell you about that later but I would put that in the tape deck now going back and forth from school studying doing test and all that but that would be my tape time that would be my time outside of other times that maybe I would get here and there at home but the what I'm trying to say is is that sometimes Satan wants to shingly so fill everything to where you've got to step back and realize I'm in a season right now but if what Lord what time what time in this season I want you to be the Lord of it all I want you to be the influence of it all so show me Lord the times in here that I can redeem instead of saying oh I'm so overwhelmed oh this is so much help me to take that Lord God cuz it's my strength it's my shot in the arm Redeeming the time sometimes you you can become anxious when you think about all that has to be done in a short amount of time is that right so we can just take these practical parts to step back and say Lord show me Lord like I said with that message ah took me a couple weeks to get through it in the car brother Samu it took you a couple weeks listen friends it's not about I said this moments ago it's not about quantity amen you could listen let me just say this to you I'm listening to the message constantly but you could listen to the message five straight messages and and if you've not really been able to give yourself to it if you're just doing it out of quantity I believe there's things that we receive while we're hearing the word that many times we're not even aware what's taking place I believe that the Bible said scripture brother Samuel good kingdom of God cometh without observation there's things that God has is done for you right while the words coming forth that all you look back and say thank you Lord thank you now to redeem the time it means to recover from the power of another to Ransom or to buy off now that's what he did that's what the Lord Jesus did for us in bringing us to himself now watch how this applies to us to buy up for oneself for one's use to make wise and sacred use of every opportunity Unity for doing good so that Zeal and wello are as it were the purchase money by which we make the time our own that's so that's so good that's so good can I just say I'm just going to preach as this is coming I'm not going to tell you what to do and what not to do but I'm going to say this to you it's things sometimes that you don't need to well I'm going to binge one way and I'm not going to do anything I'm going to cut everybody off and I'm just going to get in my closet and I'm going to do this no listen you need to ask God teach me how to live in Victory In the Heat of the battle sometimes we need a reset are you hear me sometimes we need to come aside but you need to ask God Teach Me How To Live In the Heat of the battle when the arrows are flying when everything's around me Teach Me Lord teach My Hands to War amen verse 17 wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is that's very important the will of the Lord God's will is to be born again right amen and to grow up in him into all things that's why we want to seek his will in all things the Bible goes on to say in in Ephesians 5:18 watch these NexTrip scriptures be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the spirit speaking to yourselves this is what's appropriate speaking to yourselves in Psalms hymns spiritual songs singing making Mel in your heart to the Lord giving thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ brother Samuel you don't know my circumstance I can't give thanks about my circumstance I didn't say that neither did the word it says giving thanks that I'm in my right mind though everything is breaking loose all around thank you Lord for your protection thank you Lord that there is a hope within that I know that my redeemer liveth giving thanks to the Lord in all things Hallelujah notice the effect of it notice the effect of being filled with the spirit of God that's why the the prophet said he said I'm convinced in the message Oneness he said we have just been filled enough we don't drink no more we don't smoke no more we don't do this no more he said matter of fact we don't want to do anything he said but God wants to fill every fiber of our being he wants to feel our thinking he wants to so feel Our Lives to where our words have become his words amen I say God help us fill every fiber Lord fill every channel Lord if there's any channel where there's any AOS Terrace hiding out flood it Lord with your presence oh God flood them out of there Lord God flood it out to a place that's Revival flood it out Lord Oh Brother we've got more water present than what they have in the ocean to flood those tunnels we've got more than a pump to put them in there the Holy Spirit himself is the life of God we're not just in ankle deep water we're not just in Waist Deep Water but the promise of this hour is this water has become life to you and I we are swimming in it as it said in Ezekiel we're not waiting in the promises of God we are bathing and our lives are consumed with his presence Hallelujah we have a choice though we can become drunken with the cares of this life true the effect of this is it submits oneself ourselves one to another this is why we come down into this here this is why we want to just be very mindful of the time and where we're standing um Kim if you'll go to spiritual food and do season there I want to read that quote almost called her honey that's Paul when Paul was little he would go around behind her when I wasn't around and in the middle of sisters everybody he honey honey honey we were laughing about that the other night but noce spiritual food and due season like Elisha of old Elijah if God be God then serve him aren't you glad that God what he did for them on Mount Carmel he does the same thing for you and I he not only has done it but in every situation that we put before him he'll declare his will there's things that we can try to make his will no fire comes no fire comes but when we just do it according to his word not according to any of our Impressions not according to feelings right but when it's according to his will you say Brother Sam how do I how do I know that what I'm doing is according to his will well first of all there won't be anything in the word to contradict it and you examine your motive and your desire behind it and I can tell you this if you're anxious about it let it alone because the spirit of God is not an anxious Spirit that's yes sir even when it says to move in haste that's not anxiousness it means with the confidence God is directing this amen notice and if Jesus is the center of all things to the Christian then I think we ought to let loose of everything else and cleave to him remember he is the center he's the North Star he is the ultimate he is the absolute and if he's the North Star there's only one thing that will point to that North Star that's your compass that you're selling with and the compass that I'm trying to sell with is the word trying you to sell with is the word have you to sell with and the word always points to him so if internally remember when the spirit of Truth is come he will lead and guide you into all truth he will take that which is of mine and reveal it unto you that's what the holy spirit is he is the compass he is the word inside of you and I and that is the strength of the believer is the word inside of you it's not a l it's the person of Jesus Christ it's the quickening power that has brought that seed to life and your life is a reflection of his life and then that Compass what's it always pointing to the North Star right now you can take that compass and walk over here but if that Compass is only going to point to the North Star you might get pointed in a wrong direction are you hearing me you or me might get pointed in a wrong direction and not necessarily with our feet it might be your attitude it might be your priorities might be things you're deliberating on but the compass on the inside if you'll pay heed to that and just consider the compass not your feelings but consider the compass because the compass will always direct you to the work and everything that God has for you in life even the natural things will not take away from the revelation of Jesus Christ it'll only highlight his care his love his glory his Mercy for your life amen it never anything even in the natural does not diminish Jesus Christ when we're walking in step with him this is why in First Peter 4:1 watch how Peter says this you know Peter Peter wrote a lot under inspir oparation of how the Believers were to conduct themselves even in the last days and with battles and pressure and everything going on watch how he says this for as much then as Christ ha suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered In the Flesh hath ceased from sin this same mind what was this mind let this mind that was in Christ amen be in you also what is is the mind of Christ that's the privilege oh I think how brother Bram says it in the message he says oh to think the privilege we have as Believers to enter into the mind of Christ am the privilege that when situations or decisions I'm glad I'm glad that it's not just me my wife family sitting at the table but I'm glad he's at the head of the table hallelujah amen I'm glad and he's not just sitting there as a picture I want to know what he wants I want to know what he wants is that how you feel I want to know how he wants I want him to be glorified yes I don't want to presume we we should we should that's what the grace of God comes to do Deliver Us from presuming venturing without Authority that's what God's grace in this hour comes to do we're walking in God's will at this moment sir let me go on to be armed with that that he that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of men but to the will of God notice how this verse is written it almost sounds like there's been a disembodiment but yet there's not but what's happened is as the quickening power has come you have been raised up into Heavenly places your thinking is Heavenly amen your thoughts everything there moving about your life is about him listen that even takes place when God lifts and you experience when you repented of your sins and you experience that where the load is lifted off of all your past sin listen it only goes deeper as he sanctifies and then he relieves the condemnation by any connection with him who influenced you to do it in the first place hallelujah amen and here you walk in this Veil same Veil same Veil but on the inside you're a new creation that's what the Holy Ghost comes to do it does not reform us it does not come down and give us five steps to a better you let me just tell you there's not a better you than the you that was in the mind of godall you can wash it up clean it up everything else but it's still a sinner there's only one thing and that is die and be born again die to your thinking die to your thoughts die to your own ideas die to your will and be born again brother Samuel what are you saying change your priorities amen yes and in his presence if you'll just allow him he'll dismantle every excuse and every excuse that seems to stand there and vaunt itself against you no matter where you're at in your life in his presence he'll dismantle it are you hearing me this is not uh psyche of the mind I'm talking in the presence of God where there's authority to dismantle every hold to deal with every Spirit to deal with things that's haunted in that life to deal with things that you can look at and say I know what God's done for me but Lord I Need Your Grace for this moment there is Grace to deal with that Hallelujah to take on that same mind to be busy about this is what it means now let me just get in here to this message the influence of another I want you just to listen to this here it says you take a family of people that will start going to church and God will heal that heal that little family he will bless them and give them the holy spirit in their life the little children will pray around the table they'll pray before they go to bed mother and father will join hands and pray I want you to watch this statement and as long as they continue like that they'll stay a family right so right here we've just received what is a definition of a family a family is not just a male and a female and kids right husband and a wife and kids that's it's more than that remember family is not of the world that's why organizations that have come on even in these last days have sworn to the destruction of the traditional family oh I could call those organizations out I've got their I've got their mission statements right here that's and some of these things were people just getting sucked into and marching along with they don't realize you know why it's a spirit of this age that's right that's right Satan wanting to direct people to the wrong things is that right now within this part of it here notice a family God himself God is a family he is a family God is one but in him were attributes in him just like you were in your father I was in my father father even the scripture said Levi paid tithes to MDC he was in the loin of Abraham and God reckon it to him how did he reckon it to him he could see he's of the same DNA when I make myself known to him he will act just like Abraham act when MDC reveals himself among his children his children give him preeminence you want this you want that you want this I'll not take a sho latchet I'm not here in this world to serve myself I'm here to serve his purpose that's what Abraham was declaring when lady o see and all the kings and all the riches and all the spoils want to try to take his attention isn't it incredible all of that was taking place all around but he was locked in on MDC hallelujah oh brother brother Samuel I have hdhd whatever they call that well let me just tell you you might you might deal with certain things in the natural but make sure you're not dealing with it spiritually get locked into his presence right there it'll settle you it'll calm you it'll guide you it'll direct you it will release the virtue you have need of for this moment and each day of your life and as long as they continue like that they'll stay a family so what so if they don't stay like that what happens well they can still be family as far as what's that definition but it's not a family the way that God thinks of it so this part of it that I just read it's where God brought that family restores it heals that family Brokenness is restore all of that an't that wonderful first thing you know they didn't have nothing an old junk car maybe riding around in or maybe walking finally they'll get a good car and a Better Home and the first thing you know then they want to to to get to what they call the world calls a better class to associate with they move into a different neighborhood and in there they find out they become influenced by the wrong influence I'm sure some of you have probably found this out too there are certain stores you can go in you know when you there's certain things as you get older like my boys they tease me or Dad's shoes I said what till you get my age of got teres you'll find out the shoes you wear and you stand on you better they're they got to be comfortable I said even my dress shoes I I get dress shoes that I can stand on for hours not that I plan on preaching for hours but I I could walk I'm telling you the the they're more comfortable to me than than tennis shoes but even some of the tennis anyhow how do we get off on that but my point is this you can go into certain places and you go in there and you feel like woo country boy in the city you know you you want to straighten up your yalls and say have you all in the gray Pon you know you you get around and maybe you don't feel that way but sometime it was like the first time that they brought me on the first class they you know they graduated me to first class and I walk in there and they say can I take your jacket my jacket I know I'm used to cattle class my jacket yeah and here's your slippers sir here's your menu you need anything you want right now here's your newspaper here's this here's that man you can get used to that kind of Life I'll be ready to fly anywhere like that but you know you come into some of those places like that and uh you know you feel you feel like how did I get here right you feel you feel out class but notice what the prophet is saying listen friends this is why Spirits out there are very real don't ever ever feel like well I'm around the message and I've got the message and I know this oh brother samel I would never do that but you see sometimes we'll say I would never say that but if we walk otherwise in a careless manner we're saying that is is why we've got to walk circumspectly notice they'll become influenced by the wrong influence you must always watch this admonition stay where the kingdom of God is and where the glory of God is pouring out amen stay where you can be spiritually fed day and night he says then the first thing you know separations come in the home worldliness and they get lifted up now notice what he's saying when he's saying stay where the kingdom of God is where the glory of the Lord is pouring out and stay where you can be spiritually fed day and night this is speaking I want you to understand now from what brother Bram has just said in this quote he's not saying anything about having a better car I mean listen I'm grateful to have a better car I I remember when Kim when my wife when I first got married I remember where the transmission in my in the car you go to you go to press gas at this green light and it would catch and go I remember you know we had that it was a hand me- down but I'm glad I was glad for I hand me down we had my dad let me use his truck you know we called that the Kahuna that big old you remember that big old brown truck my dad had we have that and my wife took some spins you know with you driving in the snow with that thing yeah I appreciate I I'm thankful I'm thankful to I I am I'm thankful to the Lord for for it so brother BR the the listen the word of God is not teaching us oh that it's wrong to have a better car or if you have a better house but what it's saying is is that don't allow those to become the priorities if our focus is on God God will give us what we can handle let me tell you something I would rather be in God's will I believe we Fellowship on this I would rather be on in God's will that means peace in my mind and not have to worry can I make this bill meet this bill meet this bill I would rather be in his will and not have things like that on my mind that's right that's right that's just that that that's me and I believe that's scriptural but I'm not I'm just telling you I don't want nothing when I sit down and here I am waiting and I'm looking to the Lord to receive and Lord what would you have for your people I don't want to have to weed through stuff when I'm praying about things I don't want to have to weed through stuff I'd rather not have anything and I think you can read into that than to be worried in my mind oh oh my so we want to stay that means our our heart remember set your mind and then seeking after those things let me just try to get us to a place here this morning I want you to think of this quote when we read this these are things Satan does not make moves just right out as to notice it he comes in slowly that that's that's how he came in in that first stage just slowly brother BR says he makes a move has so not to be detected he don't want to be detected let me tell you something you or I are not able to detect Satan's working on our own accord that's that's why we need the discernment of the Holy Spirit by the word so don't feel like oh I should be this no no Lord you're my husband you Lord I'm looking to you you're my guide amen Lord you know you you you you can see the things that's coming that I'm not even aware of and you also see the things that I might think oh this is a this is a lamb but on the inside it's it's a lion right so everything that we do decisions you know is to be prayerfully well brother Samuel this is simple I know it is but you know to be pray forly it's kind of like with the one individual he was asked to go pastor a church and he told his wife he said you go pack the bags while I pray we're going to see if it's God's will but you pack while I'm praying yeah yeah but prayerfully now brother Samuel if I'm seeking God's will that's the value that even even even in the car that I buy even in the home even in Little Things yes we want to seek his will I desire his approval now I'm just going to tell you you know right now now right now don't call me as your pastor and say Brother Sam is it all right for me to buy a car because I'm not going to tell you I'm not your master I'm not your boss I'm your pastor there can be questions I'll ask you but there are not questions and I need answers for there's questions that you have to be able to answer right right many of you know that there's questions I've asked you in office I told you I I don't want the answer I'm just asking you these questions and then you need to talk about them because we need that now prayerfully sometimes when we're praying about God's will is this all right hope so but you know sometimes we're praying about something oh yeah man this is this is this is real good this is real good well that don't mean to stop praying right you pray even more you know why because God even knows the change that's coming in your life of the decision you're praying about and the more that you pray about it it's God going to condition your heart for that moment are you hearing me his will when we're praying many times about his will my I need to try to get to a place here hallelujah this is why when the prophet says in the saman church age you think of the scripture you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done brother BR said no True Believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and Alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of God how many knows the scripture said for a lack of knowledge my people perish that's right it's God speaking to our lives and not just to know it but Lord I want to adhere to it with all my heart I want my life to be so given to it let me just try to to bring this here uh to a to a to a certain place here this morning think of this and I want you to think back to the to the scripture that we read in our opening text text and maybe we'll pull from this in our opening text where the scripture said set your mind if you're risen with Christ then seek those things that be above uh that of Christ where he set it at the right hand of God I want you to think about what's at the right hand of God in Psalms 1611 David said in thy presence is fullness of joy and at thy right hand there are pleasures ever more there's no pleasure of the world that can compare to this if you feel that way then you've never experienced the pleasure of the Lord in that of his realities that's so good and that's what you need you need to let that be the priority Lord that's what I want to be a priority I'm listen when I'm talking about this here I'm not just talking about friends just coming to church and we just come to church and we just fulfill a Duty neither is this talking about we come to church and my my goodness wasn't that a tremendous song it's got to go deeper it's got to go deeper to where our lives are being changed our will is being dissolved in his presence because listen anointing can come and anointing does come but what matters you do not live by anointing God I can't get to that this morning you do not live by that and the Holy Ghost is not fed by it he's fed by the word of God and if you really understand what the anointing is the anointing is the person of Jesus Christ it is the word himself amen amen and it leads us to a place of submission are you hearing me it doesn't lead us to a place of you know listen friends I you know I I could speak on this with emotion I'm an emotional guy but that's how God has made me up but it's not just emotion it's got to come deep it's got to come to the place to where our will is surrendered to his will not just enough to get under it like the jump rope and we we're jumping in the jump rope and and then after that's over we're done it's got to go deeper we have to change our priorities oh my Psalms 110 ver1 the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou at my right hand and until I make thine enemies thy foot stol when you're seeking after him the things let me just try to wrap this up I got one more quote I'm going to read and I'll stop you realize what this is saying as you're seeking of that which is above and where Satan is one to always try to take your mind and pull you down right he try to get you down looking at your faults looking at your failures looking at your job looking at you this and listen you have to pay attention to things right but listen as you keep your eyes on him he will bring and give you leadership in all of these things right here yes you see he you see God's not a distraction he's the attraction anything outside of him is a distraction that's right it's taking away is that right that's why the prophet said the Revelation that God wants to bring out in your life he said you let so many other things get it out of you you see how powerful that is that it shows it it's it's it's entered in but then other things come along and it's just like it just starts knocking it Knocking it out of us you you know how it is when you start out to do something you know maybe sisters start out to uh do something and all of a sudden here comes a thought oh yeah I better go do that isn't it incredible when you get down to pray oh you need to go do this you need to go do that hey why don't you go sit in the corner and when I'm done you can remind me of all the things else I need to do you know what I'm saying you know what I'm saying it's a truth you get down on your knees and all of a sudden you're start oh you know what I forgot this oh isn't it amazing how we remember at that time well brother Samuel what is that that's are important things I I agree but it's also things that where Satan will use little things that are seemingly harmless to destroy us from his presence cuz this is what happens in his presence and let me leave you here is in his presence he will dismantle every enemy every tongue every word every accusation every excuse everything he will make it bow amen at his feet and if you didn't know it you are his feet as the prophet stood there when that Maniac came across remember he challenged yes and the Holy Spirit took his Challenge and said you will fall across my feet tonight the feet of the holy spirit that night was a size whatever William brandom and let me just say this to you that what took place in Oregon you're facing Spirits every day you're facing things every day that wants to try to work on you wants to try to work at me and pull Upon Our Minds pull and get us away just like God could deal with the heart and that mind starts moving towards that of yes Lord yes Lord I I need you Lord I want to surrender my life to you and all of a sudden here come a thought to try to turn your mind another way then you get outside of church here comes another thought this is why it is the best to act upon the word while God is dealing with it say amen and surrender your all and watch him make every enemy bow at your feet every excuse be dismantled every argument every reasoning every tongue that's been raised in judgment against you no weapon shall prosper against [Applause] [Music] you Hallelujah this is the is the realities of seeking after him let me tell you something your answer your answer can drop at any time at anywhere it can drop right here it can drop while you're driving it can drop while you're working it can drop while you're in the bed it can drop while you're kneeling because why your connection is not just a church connection or an affiliation you are connected with him seated in Heavenly places hallelujah hallelujah you've got a backstage pass you've got access no wonder the Song of Solomon said oh my D let me see thy countenance yeah in the secret of thy stairs My Love She Knows the hidden passages she knows the secret channels into his presence she knows what it is to capture his presence what is is to capture the king and hold him captive is when our heart says Glory yes my Lord yes it holds the king captive prise the Lord oh my you love him let me close upon this part of it here we just out of the message of shamed brother Brown's referring to the condition that was out in Arizona with where the people had followed him out there and they had no church to go to and brother Bram would see remember he talked aled about this quite extensively saw spiritual life drying up even among the people that followed him out there they were the you know the kids were outside riding their bikes and things on Sunday and they no place to go and uh and so brother Bram he he talks about it all the way all the way around of that period of time from 64 65 and he's talking about it and now you know that was a burden I've spoke on that to you here brother Bram expresses that in what house were you me that was a burden to have a place an assembly to go now watch how brother Bram makes this statement here and I want you to think about that seeking our mindset on Christ brother Bram says and you stay under the spirit of God he's talking about the spiritual dryness there he says you stay under the spirit of God and your life becomes sweet tender like water brings this grass and soft buds well what happens if you don't stay under it you start to die right and when you start to die remember the cactus the pricklies on the crack Cactus they're actually leaves but when there is lack of water it becomes prickly but under the presence of God this is why he says You must stay did you hear we must stay under the spirit of God so this isn't just something hey you're born of the spirit of God no more no worries just go on retirement collect 401K collect this collect that your spiritual retirement just wait on the no we have to stay because as we listen as we're born again we start out as a baby we've got to grow and grow and grow we we we we learn how to walk we start learning how to talk like they were telling me last week that some point I made in service they were telling me they said you should have heard what the reason people were laughing they said what MIA said at that time I said some about shaking my hand afterward and she laughed out Hey listen all y'all that have babies I love to hear them babies anyhow that's a different story let them praise the Lord right amen well that's a different story we I don't want to get off on that but but I I want to just say it like this this is why it's important to grow grow right I I want to be sweet cuz I tell you what I can't stand myself when I'm not oh brother Samuel you mean there's yeah yeah yeah yeah I tender you know what tender means flexible able to bend to move with the presence of God not my way or the highway tender that's right flexible sweet like water brings grass and soft buds that's these trees would be Cactus them leaves would just wind up and make stickery that's the way it is when you get dry around the church everybody is sticking one another you're sticking me I'm sticking you stick post post post you see you got to half look at this listen listen now let me I'm closing I know you said said it but I want let this is very important you've got to have what kind of waters soft soft Waters I love good torrential torrential downpours I love that I I I believe there should be torrential Dr down downpours at times in the house of God I believe that according to how however God sees fit but I'll tell you this right here torrential drown downpours will run off are you hearing me it'll run off but you take a nice soft rain it'll soak into that ground when it gets down into the summertime and it rains man I look outside I said Lord please let it be soft let it be soft why cuz I like how my draas look when they get watered and that means I don't got to water them that means my grass gets watered soft water so you see it's the soft water I'm let's stand it's the soft Waters of rain that soften you up listen now don't don't tune me out it softens you up this is what soft water does it softens us up you realize there's times the reason that there's times where there's things no doubt that we can miss things is because we don't allow the spirit of God to soften us up and you know what happens is it becomes runoff and then after it becomes runoff are you listening watch how the enemy he'll turn around and he's got a quote for you and the enemy will say now you know what that is there is a quote in spiritual food in spoken words Original Seed and it says that if this water just runs off your back like a duck you're not a seed that can absorb it he's quoting a quote but he's misapplying it yeah that's good and if you allow him he's trying to take that quote and distract you how do I know because when God takes a hold of his word he don't condemn you he'll convict you Hallelujah condemnation puts you in a jail and you can't get out but conviction will say hey this is where we're missing the mark but come on let's go let's go that's what conviction it'll lead you in Repentance it'll get you on the right way that's what real conviction does that's what the word of God comes to do it comes to bring healing in our lives and soft rain soft rain you know sometimes when it's soft you just man it's so pleasant to hear that soft rain and absorbs into our life sometimes we we just want come on brother Samuel drop it down come on Lord I Lord I've only got so much time drop down the Toral and it just feels good but afterwards where are we right remember the rain is the holy spirit right I I don't want to put the rain schedule on my schedule the Bible said his eyes are upon this land and care for it God knows what has to be brought out of our life in this season he knows just the right amount of rain for this season that we're in what Feast we're in he knows just the right amount of rain and we want to say Lord let my life be an absorption amen if I've got things Lord in me and my mind and I'm sitting here and just be honest with him don't don't don't be under condemnation be honest with him this is a moment to be honest with him and allow the soft rain just to come down and say Lord I got a little distracted my mind's got off on a little things I got over here but Lord I want to just you know I just want to take in this soft rain just soften me Lord soften my will to your will soften my will to your will let's pray father thank you for your mercies this morning Lord Lord we need your grace in this hour we need your leadership and I believe believe that Lord you have given us Lord of your spirit you've given us lord of the leadership that we have need [Music] of Lord through all of it here this morning everything Lord as you've spoke to our hearts May there be a resolve that God has moved not by just not by just sitting here in this building but a resolve would move into hearts and lives to say Lord I want to change priorities I want your priorities the priority of this word that's what I want my life that's what I want my whole life to govern around is the priority of entertaining Jesus Christ first place in my worship because my worship is not just when I rais my hands not just when I'm singing a certain song but my worship is my daily living Lord as your Prophet told us we can worship you by just going up to the person at the store and saying isn't it a beautiful day the Lord has given us that's worship father in all things may we put you first as James would write to us under inspiration and say of all the plans that you have but allow room for divine Interruption if it be the Lord's will oh God help us in this hour we we're living in a moment we're living in an hour where Lord we have to be mindful of every step that we're making not walk fearfully but walking with our eyes on you and when there's decisions that we have to make Lord we want to be under your influence Lord any life or any heart you know where each of us are at I'm asking this morning Lord as your grace Lord has spoke to our hearts to lead us out of places that Lord that maybe as we read in that quote where that family started out you healed that family and then all of a sudden Lord they other things other influences moved in I pray here this morning God as your influence or your presence Lord has moved down May there be Wills made hearts to recognize I'm not being influenced by the right Source I'm not chasing after the right thing I'm not putting the right priorities I'm putting so many other things and and and and when I have time for God or when whenever Time Lord but Lord we don't want to be as the prophet told us in that message too busy too busy to pray too busy to go to the house of God too busy cuz we in that Lord where we are too busy but help us help us to redeem the time Lord in every area of our life Lord from the school from a school child Lord to the college to Lord those in the job to every one of us Lord in family life all those things we want your leadership Lord help us father I pray Lord May there be hearts and lives this morning that if they've never come to a place of surrender never come to that place of repentance with you to where they've really repented of their wrong and walking into the Waters of baptism Lord never received yet Lord the spirit of God may that be the number one priority of their life may they let loose of everything else and say God I want you to be the priority because every everything else in my life you know how to order it I want you to be the Lord of all maybe he's come into your life and youve he's standing on a welcome mat but he wants to go through every door of your life maybe it's the door of Pride that's the first door that he comes into he works on that door of Pride and I'm afraid what so and so will say I don't want to do this or I don't want to give up this style I just just let him come in if you just say Lord come into this room give me the strength that I need Lord and take Lord everything out of this room any anything thatall is influencing me in the wrong way let him go through every door every room of your house just say come in Jesus take control of every area be the influence in every room in our home Lord be the influence of every channel of every part of my life Lord granted father we pray Lord we we take your word word we take your leadership this morning to act upon the word we don't want anything to get this out of us Lord we want to move Lord we love you father this morning in the name of Jesus Christ
