uh brother joshu and sister Sharon back with us and um let's just uh we want to continue to keep brother um Shane and sister Lily and prayer and uh so I was a exciting news this morning early and uh so I said we would just uh be praying for them as well and the Lord just give him just a real a real good delivery there and um so I know brother Sean's kind of anxious I I went by there on the way in I said you're excited aren't you you know I don't know if you know it or not brother Sean's probably already got him a car built and everything else you know but uh that's exciting and so we are very excited for them and um just good to be here this morning in his presence and we just want to invite the Lord just to take control here in the remaining part of the service he's here and we certainly need him amen God knows your need Ben turn these down a little bit more this just too loud please um God knows our needs so personally and um how many you believe that that you know many times it's like when I have we were preaching and um I don't know I've got too much something there too much here there's too much somewhere um we were preaching on that here just the other day of um of Hope and that has been a very uh been a very dear subject to me here over the past uh few months and um I I think of that of um when we we look at it of what an expectation that God gives to us I look how many times we walk into a service and not all the time but sometimes we come into a place and we're looking and saying Lord I just need a word from you I really don't even know what to even to say or to tell you or to ask or the correct petition but you know what I have need of you know you remember that little boy that brother brandom always tells that story and you've heard me referred to it many times about as he just put up ab c d cuz he didn't know what to say brother Bram goes into that story and he says what it was he said that little boy was being raised in a step home he was being abused situations that were taking place that he had no idea how to even pray about and so he said I'm just going to give him the ABCs cuz he knows what's on my heart and I believe God when we come into times like this God knows what we have need of and there's a hope Paul writes of in Romans 8 I've got an expectation that God you know I need a word from you and we certainly need a word from him amen so let's just go to him and a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for these moments that you give to us Lord that where we are Lord able and afforded together together Lord it certainly is according to your promise your word that you have you gave to us Lord you said if two or three would a lord would be gathered together in your name you'd be in our midst Lord Lord there's one desire that we have it's more than just having a couple people three people 10 people Lord it could be a thousand people but God what's important is to be gathered together in your your name that Lord our hearts Lord are with one one mind and one Accord with one desire and that's you Lord and Lord I believe that that's where our hearts have gathered here this morning there's one purpose that we have Lord and that's to see you Lord amen father if there Lord is anything Lord to be drawn from this service it'll have to come from you father and Lord we're asking that may you just move in a very special and personal way Lord to every heart Lord the things that you've placed on My Heart Lord that have not been able to get away from Lord I ask that you would just Lord help me to step aside Lord though I have those things that you have inspired to my heart and would bring back to my mind Lord God I'm depending on that inspiration Lord there's a thought Lord oh God that Lord you desire to expressed to us and Lord we're asking God for Lord the Holy Spirit to come and anoint our hearts oh God bring us Lord I pray father into that place Lord of a of a Unity God of a place that we can see and hear from you Lord and our needs can be met Lord and where doubts are settled Lord and questions are answered oh God and where lives oh God are brought into Fellowship Lord and full Fellowship may you just Lord have your way this morning Lord I pray that God that you would just now Lord take control Lord of every situation we lift up special prayer Lord for sister Lily this morning Lord God for

God lord May the peace of almighty God lord just so surrounding Lord and encompassing Lord I pray that God that every step of the way Lord may it be a smooth Lord delivery I pray oh God may your hand

this morning Lord granted Lord May you bless Lord this time to them I pray father Lord we love you and we thank you Lord and how grateful we are to be gathered here together Lord so good to see different ones Lord Brother Bobby and sister Chrissy Lord and oh God different ones Lord that been battling Lord with sickness Lord and I think of brother Dave Crest this morning Lord and ask that you'll just continue to strengthen him Lord in his body oh God and Lord Jesus for sister Shirley Lord may you continue to comfort her Lord as they returned Lord from the funeral Lord of her brother yesterday Lord I pray that God you would just minister to her as well Lord granted Lord we pray and Lord for sister Wilma that you would just continue to give strength to our sister Lord we thank you Lord for your touch Lord in her body oh God and Lord we just love you and we thank you Lord in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen let's amen God bless you musicians uh if we could let's turn to Ruth chapter 2 thank you no no I'm good thank you let's just go right into to uh verse 11 of Ruth chapter 2 and I want to just get right down into verse 14 but let's start here and um and the scripture says and Boaz answered and said unto her it hath been fully it have fully been showed to me all that thou has done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband and how thou Hast left thy father and thy mother and the land of thy Nativity and art come unto a people which thou knowest not hitherto the Lord recompense thy Work and a full reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel under whose wings Thou Art come to trust then she said let me find favor in thy sight my lord for thou Hast comforted me me for thou H has spoken friendly unto thine handmade though I be not like unto one of thine handmaids look at this grace that comes to her and Boaz says unto her at Meal Time Come Thou hither pise God and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar this a vinegar would be a a real moment of refreshing when lab in and toiling and throughout the field it's one of those Customs even in the East sometimes they would mix a little bit of wine with the vinegar sometimes they'll take the water and the vinegar but it's it's meant among the Reapers that when they would come it would bring a refreshing so he's inviting her to a refreshing dip that morsel in the vinegar and she sat beside the Reapers and he reached her parched corn and she did eat and was sufficed and left amen may the Lord bless you and bless the reading of the words you're being seated I want to come back to a a quote out of the message Redeemer and Redemption where we had started looking at this part and uh I think this morning I'll probably be able we'll see to finish at least this verse of it but I want to read this quote here where brother Bram draws this and you know there's so many little nuggets and things that are pointed out on the holy spirit will just take a hold of them for us and just really amplify them brother brah says when it comes the midday and you get tired come over and sit down under the tree and take the morsel of bread and dip right in with the rest of them brother Bram says I like that that's fellow ship get right around under the shade tree oh he says don't you love to get under there and just dip right in with the rest of them now I want to speak here this morning on Fellowship you find that this is a message that in that particular word you'll find it titled many many different places through the message Fellowship by Redemption Fellowship fellowship with God on and on the prophet will preach it many times and you realize that in reality that God it's God's desire to have fellowship with you and I God's desire is by no means for us just to be members of a church or that we would somehow be affiliated with something or just Associated but God's desire is fellowship that we would have fellowship with him and then in turn by having Fellowship in him then we can actually have the right kind of fellowship with one another and so this this is something to where that Ruth herself is invited into this Fellowship now when we think of it what a what a Grace that's been given where she can come and sit down under the trees I think it's fitting how the prophet would place it because in many of these accounts like this with the Reapers it would be almost as though they would be in some sort of a shelter or they would ride of it of a booth something to where that they would be able to come in out of the Heat and the toil of the day and you're aware that when you look through the scriptures many times with leaves itself it will speak of Fellowship leaves that even would be upon the tree would speak of Fellowship this is one of the things that the enemy eventually ate away among the Church of the Living God he started with to remove brotherly love and then went on to remove Divine Fellowship but it's always been God's desire to have fellowship with his children if you think clear back to how that when we recognized in the in the very beginning or before the beginning the scripture tells us that the sons of God shouted for joy and we recognize that that was all about whereas sons of God even in that time would catch a glimpse of our Salvation through the blood of the Lamb that there would be a bringing back and a Redemption God himself desired to have fellowship with his children but there had to come forth a a bedding ground that which which God could actually actually make himself known to his children and have that kind of Fellowship it it's kind of like when if you think about it in this terms like I think of our three boys right here though there could move upon my heart to desire to be a father and yet though they were there the whole time but yet there had to come a beding ground and there had to come a time that in order that we could have fellowship or they would become manifested and then we could have fellowship and that's exactly the way that God does when he brings forth his children God by his Spirit by his word he brings forth his children that you and I might have a real fellowship with him now you know you can't have Fellowship unless you've got things that are in common you've got to have things in common you know birds of a feather flock together this is why that Paul would write you know some of the very first writings of the word Fellowship falls in the New Testament you'll find it once in the Old Testament but this word fellowship and as we speak of it is something that appears and comes first in the New Testament not many not many times is it written of even in the New Testament but it would always refer to not only that of the body but how that the believer would be in fellowship with almighty God and we know that there are things that you know sometimes we can talk to one another and there's people that we have that are wonderful friends and Associates but you just don't have a lot in common with them you know they're good people sometimes you know individuals you know that we can talk with listen even setting in the body of Christ we can have certain things that when we would get outside of talking of the word maybe we don't have a lot in common and then there's sometimes that we find among others that my there's certain things that we do have in common that that's all the differences that would be among us or differences that we would like in our preferences and so forth and the Holy Spirit doesn't take that away but there's one thing that the spirit of God does do is he works to bring uh each and every one of us into a fellowship with him and then through that fellowship with him then we can have real fellowship with one another and so when the prophet is speaking of this here with Ruth of how that she has been invited to this place and what a wonderful thing it is to be able to come into fellowship and set under the table I think that's wonderful don't you I think it's wonderful that God gives us an opportunity to be able to come and to Fellowship together with one another what a privilege that is that God has given us I thank God that he's given us a place that we can come to a building and that we can come and gather and more than just a building but to have that Revelation that would move in our hearts to come to a place to say Lord I'm coming to hear from you I'm coming together with my brothers and sisters of like Precious faith and Lord I'm looking to hear from you now watch how this is written in Fellowship here in 1 John chapter 1 I believe this with all my heart notice this which was from the beginning which we have heard and which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye Also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ and these things write we unto you that your joy may be full now no noce this desire of what John himself would write of what God has made known this life what we saw tabernacled this same deity in the body of Jesus Christ not only have we handled it but we ourselves have become Witnesses by the resurrection by the quickening power of the same life that dwelt there that now has made a reality in our hearts that we're not just called as though to say well you're a Son of God but the spirit of God comes to make that a living reality within our hearts that indeed you and I are the children of God so in other words it's not something that you have to go and ask somebody else about but it's something that God wants to do personally for you and God wants to make that so real and of course it will come and God will build on that you you know more as you feed on the word you find yourself the strength and the maturity the stability it just becomes more real but God himself is the one who first gives that divine revelation that's what the real New Birth is it's a revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally it's where there becomes a settling and where that sin the desire of sin is gone from your life there's no there's no desire whatever that it could be there in your life or what was is no longer there what has done that the Lord Jesus Christ the same one that rose on that Easter morning now because the blood cell was open that life has come and brought you into Fellowship now notice the spirit here that is working we find this all the way in the Book of Revelations we find it all the way through the New Testament we even find in in God's heart when you read in the Old Testament where God will speak of sacrifices he'll speak of ignorance in the camp and those things and God will make known that these sacrifices they are also things that will be accepted by strangers God knowing even then that there would be those as those who came in to the economy of God in Israel your rahab's your Ruth like we're writing on that they were not in themselves Jews but they were strangers this is what Ruth has said before but God in His Grace has already made provision because God already knew even that the Jews would reject they would not accept the Messiah but remember that was in the plan and mind of God because you and I were in God's mind all along it was God's desire to have a bride all along a bride that he would choose one that would would be a part of him one that he could express himself through and to see this desire to me when I look at this in the scripture how John says that we also may have fellowship with us now this was not something of just let's just you know let's all get together underneath this banner and you know we have something that we associate on you know there's many things you can associate around but you see the real Fellowship of the believer is not about an association of ideas the real Fellowship of a Believer is a fellowship under the shed blood of the Lamb you you say what are you saying that sometimes that that there can be things within Fellowship that there can be groupings and groups will come together under a certain identity a certain strain a certain belief but you know that's not what God intended God intended that the fellowship would be under the shed blood that though there might be differences though there are certain things like brother Ram talks about Jack Moore he said there's not a better friend that I have he said then Jack Moore he said but if we sat down he said there's things that were a million miles apart on but we still have love and fellowship for one another now I think that's exactly what the Holy Spirit produces in our life so notice this Fellowship it's not about just fellowshipping with us but John is letting it be known this is where our fellowship is drawn from we truly verse three our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ we are walking in step with that word so this this Spirit it produces is a True Fellowship on an individual level which when that moves down and that contact of a reality that would strike in our hearts what does it produce in our life it produces a longing for a lost brother a lost sister it even puts a burden in our hearts for someone who has gone astray there is a desire why because through and by the real Spirit of redemption the Holy Spirit it brings us into co-partners in Redemption with the Lord Jesus Christ and so we have that same desire notice how Paul or John would write this in continuing this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth so you see a person that could say I've got fellowship with God now remember we're not is talking this scripture is not talking about just someone who gets down and they pray prayer is a prayer is a time of Fellowship but remember Fellowship itself is not a one-way Street the prophet would say it over and over in the communion messages he said real communion is fellowship it's not where we're doing all the talking but it's where we are doing a majority of listening and so when we recognize this Fellowship it's things that we have in common so if a person would say now sometimes you know individuals you know a person that doesn't understand the truth maybe they're a taught that when you walk into a church you shake a hands or you recite a Creed well you know you're in Fellowship but you know that's not the fellowship that John's talking about right here this Fellowship itself is where there has come a Divine Union and the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed has removed every bit of sin and the Very desire of sin nature itself that's the power of the blood of Jesus Christ so if a person would say I have fellowship with God they're actually saying that I hear from God God is my father and that life is working in me if the life within will not punctuate every word with an amen or express it with an amen then it is not in full Fellowship yet it might be in Fellowship among a body of believers but it's not come into the full Fellowship that God intended whereby that his life is living out through our lives watch this but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another now notice how this how this comes about if we walk in the light as he's in the light we have Fellowship one with another so how does real Fellowship come even Fellowship among every one of us you realize that when a person first comes into a assembly a church and I I thank God that there are lives and hearts and testimonies that even I've received the meetings and then even prior to the meetings of things of how the atmosphere that God would bring and have Among Us I think if God in his Mercy that would be an atmosphere where lives would come up that even I'm talking about him before the meetings would come up a minister would say what a wonderful atmosphere that is in the church right there an atmosphere where it's at Liberty to worship and a and an atmosphere of Love listen let me tell you something if that can be when when we and ourselves may not even be aware of it what what is it and what will it be when we can say God let everything let every bit of indifference or if there's anything in my life when the spirit of God can bring us into such a place to be so mindful even more than what we would be I'm telling you friends it's hard to to tell what will be done do you realize the prophet said that when the Church of the Living God would be taken into such a place in Divine love he said they won't even have to lay hands but the sick will be healed I believe in laying on hands but he's talking about to such a place when the love of God comes so deep in our life that we lose sense of our own selves we lose sight of self and our focus is on him and one another that's real Fellowship right there so notice this is how we would have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin notice in the message what is the Holy Ghost now brother brandham when he's when he goes in to speak this brother brandham is coming off of some meetings and you know he's preached on it over and over and there's many times within at a church and assembly there many things that we have to revisit and go back over and you notice brother BR is returning back to the Tabernacle and he's burdened even as he's coming back to it he's even announcing it when he's out in other places he said I'm heading back to the Tabernacle for a real time of Consecration and as he says that we come back to this time of consecration he said because I'm seeing things are you hearing me he says I'm seeing things in the Tabernacle he said where I see real good people he said I mean they're fine people real good he said but you know he says there's just something lacking there're good people fine people people but he says what's lacking is is there needs to be a deeper experience and so the prophet would come under the burden and he would preach these series The Holy Ghost series what is the Holy Ghost what's it given for how do I know when I got it of course that one's not recorded and then questions and answers on the Holy Ghost and yet the one the third one that wasn't recorded that's all the way through the message that's all the way through but we know notice what brother brand would say here we are trying to bring our people into a better fellowship with Christ that's our purpose that's the whole goal is to bring our people into a better fellowship with Christ now were were the people not in fellowship with one another they were the people were in fellowship with one another but yet God laying the burden upon the prophet's heart for the church there to see that there was a need for a better Fellowship let me tell you friends I believe that's exactly what would burn in the heart of any real man of God and any believer it would burn in our hearts to want to see a better Fellowship he would want to see Lord God as we would pray for one another you know if Paul would even say we're praying for your Perfection you know there was a man by the name of epais he he wasn't known to preach meetings or anything like that but epap epais was such a man that he would pray Paul recognizes this he prayed for the church he prayed for the needs he saw the shortcomings he saw the things that was lacking and he did the greatest thing he could do and that was pray for the needs that he saw do you realize the moment you get away from real prayer is the moment you get away from expectation that's what brings expectation is prayer getting Before the Throne of God well I don't see nothing happening I don't see anything going wrong but you see when we get Before the Throne of God God has made you and I in a place to be able to intercede for one another and the needs that we see around us now watch this in Ephesians chapter 3 verse 8 unto me watch how Paul writes this on this Fellowship Who Am less than the least of All Saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which was from the beginning of of the world hath been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ now notice what Paul is writing about his purpose the burden upon his heart remember Paul's Ministry was a Ministry to the Gentiles he would be given the light and illumination of divine revelation and Paul in his life would go forth and remember that men that Darkness would be turned away from light and that the Gentiles themselves would receive their call Paul that according to the mystery that God had hid all the whole time what is that mystery it's the mystery of God's own life that God himself would take a people and to think about it Paul would come not just with words but he came with the unction of the holy spirit because friends it'll take words it's God's not here to try to convince people God's not here to try to convince you or try to convince me you say what do you mean if you are persuaded by one you can be persuaded by somebody else God is not here that you would be conformed to the message but God's desire is that your life would be transformed that the spirit of God would so resonate on the inside to recognize who it is that's speaking to you and to recognize oh my test let's go over to the handheld man we're having a Time pray for I don't stutter I hate these [Laughter] lollipops gave me one the one time at brother Sean's meeing I said y'all just going to pray for I said Put it on a stand first and I'll preach with it on the stand CU if not I'll stutter a lot but you know think of this in this manner that this Fellowship this participation of God what God has desired and what he has called you and I to God's the one who makes it real he makes it clear to you and I lets us know that your life down here it's not about this life it's about that life that is to come that you're you're more than just a human being walking around or just you know a son and daughter of so and so but you're a son and daughter of God and you're not just become a son and daughter of God you always were a son and daughter of God you see God begins to let you know of who you really are that was the purpose Paul could say of the ministry that you might have Fellowship wi the mystery your participation your part in this mystery now I want you to think of it he says to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord Lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him now I want you to think of this in this manner as as the word would go forth and as the word has went forth down through every age it's God's desire to have Fellowship that Fellowship that he had clear back in the Garden of Eden we know what came in it was sin that came in that broke that Fellowship that God had with man and God's desire has been that man would come back into that place to bring man back into a place of Fellowship not just so much the where that God would talk face to face with man but the where that you in your life me in my life would actually be assembled as a part of the House of Prayer to actually be a tabernacle a dwelling place that God himself would dwell in you realize the prophet said and why Christ speak he said Jesus goes to church every single day he said he goes to Church in his people and he worships there oh my the Lord is listen he's living in the midst of his people he's living in hearts that he has redeemed he shed his own blood and his life has come into but to think of this Fellowship that even when a person whether it was an Israelite whether it was one who would be coming into the camp there was always things that God gave as a provision that would actually signify and speak of their acceptance or the acceptance of their faith and their Fellowship among the people watch how the prophet says this in what is the Holy Ghost he said any child that refused circumcision in the Old Testament which was a foreshadow of the Holy Ghost was cut off from amongst the people he could not have fellowship with the rest of the congregation if he refused to be circumcised now he says that pattern is today a person that would refuse to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost can have no Fellowship among those that has the Holy Ghost you just can't do it you have to be of a nature now notice if when you think of this even when a person would come in let's say a person comes right in the door and here they'll come in the door and my just you know appreciate is the greeting you know and coming in and fellowshipping you know around and you know maybe here's they'll come in and they'll be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they recognize wait a minute I need to repent of my sin the spirit of God bring conviction to their life and then here they are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ taking upon his identity now what does that bring them they are now in Fellowship among the local body of Believers but they have not been brought into the fellowship as far as into the body of Jesus Christ remember when brother Ram's nephew and the things was going on as a young man and brother Bram had to go down and correct that and some things and things that he had he had done and brother Ram goes down there and and his and and you know brother Ram is talking to him and said hey hey there's some things you know that's taking place that's wrong you know you're an Irishman you're a German and these things are taking place and you know these things aren't right here with your son that was his nephew and brother Brandon was standing there and as he's talking the father speaks up and says but my son he's come to the altar he's accepted Christ he's been baptized and the prophet said nothing wrong with that whatsoever he said that's true he has been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he's taking his identity among the Believers he said but until he is converted and fully regenerated he'll never be over to able to overcome those complexes in his life no matter how much mentally he tries to do it he's got to have a full work of redemption so I think it's wonderful let me just say this to you I think it's wonderful it ought to be something friends that that there should be hearts and lives that would feel a welcoming maybe there's something that they wouldn't get right away maybe it's weeks I don't know how long I I'm not here to run anybody away but I will say this I thank God if people can come and they can sense the love of God maybe they don't even know what it is but there's a welcoming Spirit that's here it's something that's peaceful it's a reality that's pointing them more than just trying to get them their names on a book or get them to to a church or get them to recite a Creed but something begins to move within their heart that hey this is something this is a living God that has a real interest in my soul hey this is not just something where we carry a Bible but it's a reality where the Bible is actually preached where the Holy Ghost is actually loosed Among Us and the spirit of God comes and he works in our life listen we want that kind of a fellowship but we don't want to stop there because just to stop there it's only a matter of time it's only a matter of time we can associate around my what a love listen friends I don't think there's a better group of people boy y'all quiet y y'all think there's a better group than yourselves I don't think there's a better group of people than the Bride of Jesus Christ oh yeah we got we got our shortcomings we we got our mistakes and our flaws we're not perfect people we got a perfect sacrifice a perfect blood that we've been made perfect through and by that sinless offering but to think about it to be able to come and fellowship tell me why it is I trust it's this way why is it that bosses or different ones or people would seek you out and desire to have you had desire you know certain things within the company well you say well brother Samuel that don't happen to Christians I beg to differ with you Joseph well Joseph himself God was with with him and God gave him favor come on friends sometimes the things that we look at and call persecution it's God wanting to mold and shape our character not pray things away but it's actually God wanting to help us to die more to ourselves because we needed to be mold and made into his own image that's sir is that right yes sir so when understand this that there's got to come something that goes deeper it's got to be something that sure thank God we walk into the Waters of baptism but if we refuse the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't need that I don't need that life I'm good as I am then we are refusing fellowship with almighty God and God will not God will not accept that and it actually will show in our life you know what you receive it'll show in your life what you reject it'll show in your life think of this the prophet says it like this he said my mother used to say birds of a feather flock together it's an old proverb but it's true you don't see doves and crows fellowshipping their diets are different their habits are different their desires are different now I've watched this many times over the years you know with preaching youth meetings and things I've watched how you can gather maybe 400 young people together and you know first of all when they get there you know they know certain ones and certain ones in their little Gatherings and so forth but you can just watch sometimes and understand me it's not the people but you'll watch certain things will start to congregate together you'll watch those who maybe don't want to be as serious and they're not there to be as serious God still works in those things to get a hold of their lives I've witnessed that but you'll watch certain things of how things will somehow get together you tell me how that happens it's because there's Spirits that's there and just a much just as much as the holy spirit will draw a group of people together and then there's lives I I don't know you know this talking on the spiritual level that's a that's a little too much for me you know I need something to talk a little bit of spiritual but I need them to talk a lot about gangs or about sports or about this I I need more of that I feel more comfortable but I I think it ought to be that when we're seeking out friends and fellowship we want somebody that they would be Christ in their life that would challenge in my life to live a little bit deeper the Bible said Iron sharpeneth Iron it ought to be something within our life that we fight against those Spirits I don't want to be mediocre I want to go on with God amen now notice this we don't see doves and crows cuz we can't doves and crows can't eat the same thing so what happens the diet itself actually becomes a display of whether there's real fellowship or a lack of Fellowship think about the Hebrew children when the Hebrew children themselves when they refused to go into the land of promise they made their own choice is that right when they made their own choice the 10 spies and here the evidence came back and they made their choice they refused fellowship with God and when they refused that fellowship with God they walked for 40 years they walked around the same Mountain for 40 years let me tell you something friends if you don't accept God's provision you'll be left to wandering in the same spot over and over and over it don't matter how long you come to a message church it's about getting fully into Jesus Christ it's about his life changing you and when there's a life that's been changed on the inside and there's full Fellowship that everybody knows not because of how you carry your Bible not because of what you can quote not because of everything you can say but the life you live on a daily basis tells the fellowship that you have hallu see it's just like this lady oan age the lady oan age that we're in they claimed to have fellowship with God they claim to be in fellowship with him we're rich have need of nothing but you notice to be in Fellowship there's only one place of fellowship and that's under the blood is that right there's only one place of Fellowship it's not just not coming to a church it's getting under the blood that's what the real message of the hour that's listen that has been the call down through every age is come and get under the blood why because the blood itself listen this blood is not the Blood of Mary it was not the blood of Joseph this Blood was the blood of Christ it was not a polluted blood are you hearing me it was a blood the Bible it was God's own blood God created that blood cell for to do what to pay the price for you and I that when that blood would be shed that that life on the inside could come back on the worshipper and bring us into a place of fellowship with God amen where we stand as redeemed Sons and Daughters of God with the reality of the Holy Spirit burning in our hearts and our life expresses a fellowship with God but we look in this age that we're living in in this age of Lady OA they claim to have True Fellowship claim to be under the word of God they claim that there's you know oh we're there but yet they're not able to take every word of God and say Amen to it right right right now you know it'd be one thing for you and I and it all begins to be able to say Amen to every word of God but it takes something within that Soul that's able to stand there because the holy spirit is not a separate person from God it's not something separate from the word but the Holy Spirit itself is the word himself so how can the spirit of God dwell in a heart and out of that heart come a nail against the word how can there come a rejection against the word of God it's not the true Holy Spirit are you hearing me now you might have had the Holy Spirit on your spirit you might have spoken tongues you might have prophesied you could have done all those things but if that genuine Holy Spirit doesn't get down to where it needs to be listen friends you can do all of these things and still not be regenerated in the soul when there is a regeneration in the soul then it becomes a redeem means son and daughter of God is that right how The Prophet by the spirit of God labored on that in this hour where the Pentecostals running under the baptism of the Holy Spirit but they were not they were not willing to submit and then call to mind of what God was calling them to into a full Fellowship oh friends I'm afraid sometimes that that gets right around our message that we'll hold back on something of well you know I've seen this and I've seen this and and and you know this was revealed to me and and bless God I've got this gift that's the same thing that the Pentecostals done you see what it has to come back to the prophet said in the prisoner of Jesus Christ he said don't ever judge your life by how many gifts you have by all the Miracles in your life he said you judge your life by the fruits of the spirit and what is coming out of your life that's what we need to rest on rest on the word not a gift not a sensation we need to rest on the word word of God brother Samuel do you believe in Sensations I do do you believe in feelings I do but at the end of the day that is not what I'm resting on because when Sensations are gone feelings are gone there's got to be an anchor that's there with the word of God that I know in whom I have believed and my soul punctuates the word of God with an amen that's why we don't want just a baptism on our spirit you say why though that'll make you religious yeah indifferent but you want a real genuine birth that brings you into fellowship with God I want you to think of this full Fellowship think of this in 1 Corinthians 12 verse 12 for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have all have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many my what Ruth has been invited to what has been extended to her to come at meal time and have Fellowship now she would have Fellowship among the Believers that's true but the first part of it was to have Fellowship to feed upon the word of God now you know as we read this scripture here that for by one Spirit are we baptized into one body you know Lord willing here in a few moments brother t i we will baptize uh Sister Barbara and sister angelene desired to be re-baptized you realize of of the many that that that have been baptized or would would be baptized you know we can we can put them down into the water been many that we can put in water but oh my prayer was always Lord you place them in the body where they need to be Lord because only the spirit of God can baptize a life into the body I want you to think of this one time you know I was baptizing brother Andrew Glover and myself we were into the last meeting at byc and we were baptized and they had us doing it in a hor horse trough and man I'll tell you my back gave out on me brother Andrew pulled his hamstring and of course brother Lindsay McGrady said look at these two young guys he said injured baptizing you know and here we were standing over the side and brother Lindsay had to take cold you know and brother Andrew had to preach that night I I had ended that morning but you know as we were standing there I never forget you you know and and you know brother Lindsay and they're there watching you know and one time you know had this one little this young lady and you know you're you're putting them down in that horse trough and there's only so much room and you know we put them down in there and there was just you know brother Lindsay came said hey hey he said hey hey this this one girl did y all baptized there was one little spot on her forehead or her nose or something was sticking up and so forth so we went over and talked to her and all those things but I I say it for this regards that you know what that maybe as a person is baptizing you in water as much as we want to make sure that you are submerged because why that speaks of a death it speaks of a death and then raising out of there is speaking of an open testimony that I am no longer the same person I am going a different pathway I am a new person now you see when Jesus Christ himself when he comes to baptize the life into his own presence into his own life you don't have to worry about him leaving a finger out leaving a no go out leaving a spot of the forehead he gets everything submerged our life goes into a full submersion in Jesus Christ to where we come out and we are not the same people as we were before we are a new creation in Christ Jesus and then we're in a real fellowship with almighty God and the Lord Jesus Christ oh my look how the prophet says it like this I love this this about sent me in a spin yesterday out of Fellowship by Redemption brother says when God has borne you a new by the Holy Ghost he can only look upon you as a perfect work CZ he did it himself yes sir I had a spell with that one yesterday oh yeah glory amen amen he can't condemn you for you are his workmanship oh he said I feel like shouting like a Methodist think of it you are God's workmanship he did it by how Sovereign Grace not because you jumped not because you went to church not because you turned a new page but because God by his Mercy brought you into Christ and the fellowship and looks upon you as a perfect work of his own why because I bought him I present him into the blood and there is nothing wrong with my work you are God's workmanship Hallelujah you're not the workmanship of a church you're not the workmanship of a man you are the workmanship of almighty God it's God that has called you and I into this Fellowship that is so good now notice this here in the scriptures of when this Fellowship oh my what Fellowship that the the the disciples had with the Lord Jesus what Fellowship they had walking all of those those years there with him those those three some years that they had what times of Fellowship that they had what testimonies that they would have but yet you know what they did not have the perfect Fellowship that God was requiring they slept where he slept they ate fish that was miraculously caught they saw the Miracles they were part of it God would even use them yeah is that right God even used them where there was committed unto them the ministry and they went out two by two but yet they didn't not have the fellowship that God intended for him to have well how could that be because the sacrifice had not been offered yet and the life within there had not returned back into the worshipper so now here they come to to the day of Pentecost and this is where the spirit of God now coming and dividing itself and coming upon those 120 that were there in that upper room and what did they do as soon as the spirit of God had brought them into full Fellowship they were so settled in their position as Sons and Daughters of God that reality had struck their heart it was not just something they had saw and been an eyewitness to but they themselves had an experience in their own life listen friends it wasn't just the feeling of the pillar of fire they had an experience where it witnessed in their heart that they were no longer the same they had now can you imagine what how Peter felt that Peter had been delivered from where he was even before the grace that had called him after he had walked away and said I don't know him I don't know him I I don't know who you're talking about I ain't never been associated with that man and he began to say things that he shouldn't have said but notice the grace of God Called to Peter and not only called to him but now that same Grace had brought him into a place to where he was willing to prostrate his own love life surrender his own will just as the sacrifice had and the same life that was in that sacrifice came back in him and he had a witness that he had passed from Death unto life let me tell you something Peter didn't have to look over his shoulder and say man I hope I don't act like Peter used to act he had received an inoculation in his heart brother what had he done he had been circumcised from what he was he was in Fellowship yes and I'll tell you how much Fellowship he was in he became the spokesman when he began to speak the convicting power of the Holy Ghost be to move upon that audience and they said what must we do to be saved he said repent is that right and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the same Fellowship the gift of the Holy ghost I want you to think of this because Satan himself oh my how Satan he hates Fellowship he hates Unity you know even the demons don't get along you know brother Ram tells us that that's why you have these wars because every Spirit that's over a nation you say is is that true remember that Satan took Jesus up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world he said they're mine right if you Bow Down and Worship me you can have them we know that Daniel when Daniel was praying remember there was the Prince of Persia it wasn't a physical man it was a demon that was over that province is that right so how that these Spirits even in their position they will argue and they will debate and they will fuss and they will get upside upset this is how those Wars and everything else of course we know that it's all under the control of almighty God but notice within this this is one of the first places you'll find this word Fellowship mentioned in Acts chap 2 verse 42 it says they continued steadfastly in the apost Doctrine and fellowship and in Breaking of bread and in prayers now this is what receiving of the word had done in their life now when I'm talking about receiving the word I'm talking about receiving the spirit of God this is the very first time that it's me they continued in Fellowship not just in prayers not just in breaking a bread but in Fellowship they were in fellowship with God first of all and because of that Fellowship with God is what allowed them to have the right kind of fellowship with one another you see friends that's the right Source even when you look at this among your families you can say well you know I'm I'm the daddy or I'm the mom I'm the husband I'm the wife and you can look at it in that way but you got to remember who gave you that office and that attribute God gave you that office God gave you that attribute and the only way you'll ever be able to rightfully fulfill that attribute is you have to be in fellowship with the source of him who is the Fountain of all of those attributes staying in that place that God let me be the husband that you would have me to be Lord help me to understand as you pray over things regarding your wife and you're praying Lord help me to understand help me Lord to minister things that you see weaknesses and need and vice versa the wife to the husband even as you pray over your children and and you're praying and you're interceding on that behalf now I want you to think of this Fellowship the prophet says it like this and I will restore in 1957 he said the first thing that Pentecost produced was Brotherly Love Now I want you to look at these words carefully the first thing it produced was brotherly love it tore down the middle wall of partitions and made a Brotherhood so it was not these people making a Brotherhood it was was not these people making themselves this is what was produced out of Pentecost you see that's why that you and I cannot produce the love of God it takes the love of God in our soul and it takes surrendering to the love of God and I'll tell you what just as the prophet would say it over and over and over through the message he would say it in many different angles same way though same things we need more of the love of God we need a continual baptism with the love of God I want more of the love of God I want more of it to take over more of Samuel I see too much Samuel I want to see more of him notice he says it made a Brotherhood to such a way that they had everything in common in the Bible days of Brotherhood and Paul spoke of this Brotherhood and he gave all the gifts of the Pentecostal Church as he said in 1 Corinthians 13 though I speak with tongues as men and angels and have not this love which brings the Brotherhood I am nothing and though I have knowledge to understand all the mysteries of God I am still nothing without love the love of the Brethren now what you reckon you reckon this is just the love of the Brethren that agree with me no is that what the Brotherhood is that's called a click that's called a clan that's good that's what that's called that's not a Brotherhood because a real listen where the spirit of God would create such a Brotherhood we could be able to stand and disagree and still be able to stand as brothers is that right oh brother Samuel oh my let me just go on here for a little bit Jesus said this will all men know that you're my disciples when you have love one one for the other Pentecost had that I'm speaking of Pentecost meaning the first group of the Apostles and the disciples they had that Brotherly Love they wasn't greedy watch this they sold everything they had for the furthering of the church notice what Pentecost produced was a Brotherly Love It produced in their life where it no longer was about self it was about the furthering of the Church of the Living God it was not about me and my and well I tell you what what what what can you give my family no it wasn't about that it was about they had such come in such a contact with one who had so done such a work in their life that they did not deserve it they were unlovable but the grace of God came down and made them lovable and had birthed such a reality of the love of God in their hearts it was no longer a life about self let me tell you that is the Apex of where God is bringing a church in this hour to where we become so delivered of our own self our own ideas our own opinions or you say will we have them yes but we will have the grace of God to say that doesn't matter when it comes to the body of Jesus Christ that's what this Capstone Ministry brings us to Hallelujah notice this is why Paul would write let Brotherly Love continue I love that scripture let let it continue notice it's entrusted to you and I let that same Brotherly Love let let it continue don't stifle it let it continue let it abound let it increase let it move in our life but remember brother B says here that first church he said there was a fellow that came in by the name of a Palmer worm and when he begin to eat on that vine of Brotherly Love he cut the very sap line of it because it don't make a difference how smart we are how much we think we know or how much we want to be different from somebody else as long as that brotherly feeling isn't among us we're fighting a losing battle amen as long as that brotherly feeling is not among us now we've been preaching on this with feeding and recognizing how God would direct us on that you realize that when you look through the old test through the New Testament and you realize that every Church even through the New Testament had its strengths had its weaknesses just like every Church yeah every church has its strengths and weaknesses you remember that how when you look at with the Corinthian Church well they were they had been you know really gifted you were a really gifted group of people they had I mean many gifts among them great understandings but yet there was a lacking because Paul would point out everything they were doing it was under the pressure to do something to edify self and not the rest of the body when you come together I've got to speak in tongues I've got to do this and I've got to do this and I've got there's a lot of things weaknesses but let me just say this to you don't look down on the Corinthian Church because remember every church has strengths and weaknesses and if it had not been for the weaknesses in that church we wouldn't have the teaching that we have on gifts is that right we wouldn't have that so what did God do God took where was weaknesses and he led them to feed upon those things you take for example even when it comes to the galatian church the galatian church wow they you know they they themselves had weaknesses the weaknesses being moved you know being fickle and being you know back and forth and and looking you know being moved over to this place that's the kind of people they were but you think of how that God even chose them of being those of the GS but God by his grace would bring them to a place of such a foundation in his economy remember they were moved over to legalism and going back judaizers had come down there and Men Paul called them false Brethren had got in among them and things like that then you take the Ephesian Church my everybody looks and says glory to God the Ephesian church but remember the Ephesian Church oh my they wer in such heavenlies they didn't even know how to live an Earthly life they didn't know how to you know when it come down to conducting and you know working with husband and wife and how to love one another how to really live a domestic life and all of those things that hey this is why Paul would bring them over there's a battle that you have to battle through each and every day it's a battle for Heavenly places so every one of them had strengths and weaknesses in their own life or in their own church now I want you to notice how Paul writes this here in 1 Corinthians chap 1 and verse 9 Paul said God is faithful by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ Our Lord aren't you glad God is faithful God is faithful God is faithful to oversee his church and to work within our lives but notice in 1 Corinthians the vers next verse in verse 10 Paul said I beseech you breth by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment for it hath been declared unto you my my brethren by them which are of the House of Khloe that there are contentions among you now he says every one of you some of you will say I'm of Paul one say I'm of Apollos one says I'm of sephus I of Christ but is Christ divided was Paul crucified for you or were you baptized in the name of Paul now notice these contentions had come among a body of Believers to do what to try to pull them away from a real true Fellowship now let me tell you something this arguing could not have been there if they were drawing from the right Source now let me explain that you say brother Samy you're saying that these there were there were Believers whoever was caught in this they weren't genuine believers they weren't really sealed Believers that's not what I'm saying at all if you remember Paul says even throughout the Book of Corinthians he said when I wanted to feed you with meat meaning that they could have been fed with meat but because of certain things that they had not matured in and grown over he says you're in need of milk aren't you glad that God don't shove meat down your throat but God will come and Minister milk where you and I need milk simple sincere truths to minister to us why we'll get from milk to meat but you see the whole purpose is is that we would grow in him and this is why remember how it was when you were younger and you fight for the for the seat next to the door Ma you wanted that seat next to the door or maybe you called shotgun when you went with Mama to the store man you were getting that seat up front all the rest of the siblings were getting back there and my would run there and maybe if you got the door the same time you'd be sitting there and you'd open the door no I got here first and I got here first and here you are you know you're you're going along with it and maybe you know you grew up a little bit and you're 15 years old and you're still calling shotgun and and you're out running the 5year olds to get there you know to the seat and and finally you get to a spot in life you're like I don't care if I got a ride in the trunk I'm going with Mom anyhow you say what happened maturing amen you realize the certain things that used to matter that we made matter that we made matter that we made matter right it really don't matter that's right it really don't matter and we realized good Lord I had such vexation of spirit over calling shotgun I sweated so much I did all this and even after I'd get the front seat I could tell my siblings look where I'm at look where I'm at M I'm up here next to Mama and they could say oh you you cheated you ran I did not stop saying that I you see what happens is you grow above indifferences listen friends that's what the Capstone does it's drawing us up beyond our own self you know what that does it draws us even above our own excuses that's what really becomes the culprit it draws us above all of that remember we are always Sons and Daughters of God we want to shout when Oh Glory to God I'm called a son of daughter of God but in a trial in a test I'm a son and daughter of God when things are not going my way I'm a son I'm a daughter of God is that right that's always the trajectory don't ever let the enemy call you back down well this is how I was raised and this is what happened to me younger no I'm going to stand there with The True Confession cuz he's the Apostle and high priest of my confession I'm not going to live and just use my natural birth when it's convenient for me and then claim a spiritual birth in another time I'm going to hang on to what the the spirit of God has revealed to me as a son and daughter of God you love him yes sir oh my that is good my my we're just going to have to stop here when Paul would write this in other words speak the same thing that doesn't mean we send out a track and then everybody reads it and we memorize it it's not what he's saying no but Paul is calling them back to what the real reality what you need to be looking at that Christ himself the word is our absolute now don't doubt these these individuals no doubt maybe they had maybe they had an affinity with Paul let's just say it like that they had an affinity with Peter they had Affinity with different ones and maybe then through that affinity and different things they had let just those different es get in and those opinions and they had allowed the opinions to be more than the Brotherhood they had allowed their opinions to separate them they were sitting in the same church as it were but they were as divided as divided could be why it was a lack of Fellowship you see because we can't be in fellowship with God as we ought to be and be out of fellowship with one another are you hearing me you you you can't be in fellowship with God and say I don't like this brother listen friends you might say brother Samuel are you saying that we may not that that I don't have that in my soul I I I'm not saying that but what I am saying this right here the only way that you can have the right kind of feeling towards one another is to have fellowship with him and stay in fellowship with him let me tell you one of the great miracles about brother brandom's life brother Billy Paul in a book I have at home that he was asked the question in an interview what's the greatest miracle in brother bram's life he saw many they said the greatest Miracle I'd have to say he says I could not tell his friends from his enemies amen wow you say is that scripture look when Jesus and Judas that's good is that right yes sir when they sat around the Last Supper there was no inclination that had ever been given I seen Jesus look at him a little funny I seen Jesus walk by him I seen Jesus give him the eye I seen him glare no no remember don't fall back on your flesh now that's right don't fall back on that if you've got a birth on the inside you've got a strength on the inside that I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me yes sir I tell you it ought to be the prayer of things oh I'll tell you what of all those Miracles like that of all the Miracles could be done I tell you when I read it in that way like that I said God let that be the testimony in my life like the testimony was with the Lord Jesus where you couldn't tell that Judas was the one matter of fact all the rest of them questioned themselves and said am I the one is it I that's good am I the one see there was nothing that could give anything away brother Samuel what what will produce that the Holy Ghost amen you see it's the right source of Fellowship amen and when we have the right source of Fellowship it produces in our life what's needed thank you Lord than you Lord this is why brother brm says he says what happened in the beginning when Adam and Eve separated from fellowship by disbelieving one word of God I want you to think how powerful that is disbelieving just one word of God and then after doing that it brought separation said brother Samuel how simple could that be of when the Holy Spirit is speaking to your heart and dealing with your life the Holy Spirit would love for you to say that's just brother Samuel that's just a man let me just tell you friends if the male itself speaks to your life don't look at the messenger just accept the male and say Lord I'm going to say Amen to the word of God I'm going to over ride where my flesh wants to get in the way my flesh wants to rise up remember Ruth it ha been shown how you have left the land of your Nativity don't go back to it don't look back to it but keep going where God has called you to when they separated from it it allowed sin it allowed malice it allowed allowed Envy Strife all these things to enter in because why the prophet said when they got away from Divine love when they got away from Divine Love Now Divine love didn't get away from them they got away from it say Brother Sam how simple is that well just one step away from the word of God just just neglect even neglect in our life and fellowshipping with him you know he wants to fellowship with you he wants to have Fellowship yes and listen friends please don't misunderstand me but sometimes a person could pray for two hours and not have a lick of Fellowship because they'll never they never get beyond the things of of themselves but it's really entering into God it's really saying Lord you say how would you say that because if you come out of prayer and you feel the same way the same things are there you you didn't get off of the earth that that's where we have to press anybody hear me that's where we have to press in this day that we're living in we have to press Lord I don't want to come out of here this time with you Lord I I want to be changed I want to be strengthened Lord I want to come into that place brother B says you know how we know that we get to that place is when we are no longer complaining about maybe someone that we're bringing Before the Throne but now we're actually standing in and interceding for them that Lord they didn't mean to do that that's not my brother that's not my sister he said that's when we're getting Before the Throne of God In Prayer I believe God's called us to that Fellowship don't you sir oh my that's a real Brotherhood yes sir and listen friends that's what we want to contend for with all of our hearts we want to contend for it that God would be preeminent in each of Our Lives among our hearts amen let that Fellowship let it so rain in our life may we draw from that source of True Fellowship let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord as we just we thank you for your mercies Lord once again this morning Lord we thank you Father for your presence Lord and how that you would come Lord among us what a very very simple thought and even the things Lord that you've dealt with my heart for some time and Lord just looking that upon these things Lord God father I thank you for your mercy I thank you Lord that the spirit of God lord calling out Lord to hearts and to lives Lord even aresh Lord to lives that maybe Lord they've come Lord God gathered in Lord among the assembly and I'm thankful Lord that there is De God a welcoming Spirit Lord a welcoming dear God of the Holy Spirit I than Lord that as it was in the time lord when the Pharisees nobody wanted to be around them nobody did but I read Lord in the scriptures where it talks about how the publicans the Sinners and Luke 15 they come and they gathered around you there was a reason because there was life there was life Lord God it was not someone or something looking down on them but it was life that was calling him there was a call that was going Lord we thank you for that may that be Lord God I pray the call that comes out of our life no matter how far that Lord someone may feel that they've gone how lost that they might feel maybe Lord of how many times that they have failed you they've tried but I pray God May the spirit of God like John would write the fellowship that you might have this fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Christ Jesus Lord God as the spirit of God calls out the lives and hearts Lord might have Lord that Fellowship I pray that Lord if there's one here this morning that doesn't know you Lord in that way maybe Lord they've known you in a church maybe they've known you Lord in just in a way that's been up and down they felt your presence oh yeah maybe even things Lord that you've allowed them to do under that anointing but God they've never come into that place of a real fellowship with you a real spiritual death to self dying to self and being born of the spirit of God what I pray this morning may that Lord God I pray have been the reality that's placed before him Lord would speak to their hearts Lord God to let them know there is a place where no matter Lord how great the sin is no matter Lord the life that's been lived there's a place there's a place that can take care of sin it can take care of sin nature there's a place Lord and that place is under the shed blood of the Lamb Lord God when we walk in one way and we walk out a changed person Lord Lord to draw from that fountain that we might walk in a fellowship with you and having that fellowship with one another Lord to realize that I can't say that I love you and then I hate my brother I just read Lord where your Prophet said this week he said one of the greatest evidences I know that I've passed from Death unto life is even when my brethren that disagree with me over this message that I'm bringing I still love them oh Lord Jesus I pray God give us more of that love Lord may we sink deeper and deeper into the love of God granted lord it's more of you Lord that we need or to draw from that source of real Fellowship oh God that it works throughout the body I thank Lord of how the prophet would express it and humble thyself he said when the church had first started there on Athan pin of how that Lord and and even prior to that when they were gathering up there in that that little building was Uptown in Jeffersonville people would come around and they would so amused how do you get people to love like this how Lord your Prophet had such a simple answer he never said that we have seminars we have great teachings he said we preach the gospel we preach the love of God the Holy Spirit oh Lord it wasn't at times just like even among us as your children you're faithful that's what the scripture I read here God is faithful to see us through he who called us into Fellowship will see us through it isn't Lord that at times that we haven't been corrected and won't need to be corrected but we want to grow up into you in all things Lord we want to grow past indifferences Lord we want to grow past Lord to where that our opinions mean something we want to grow past our own ideas we want to grow past that Lord not that we might not still have our own thoughts or opinions but when it comes to to the body of Jesus Christ no matter what I think and no matter what I feel the body of Jesus Christ is greater than me the gro of Jesus Christ is more than my opinion my idea Grant it Lord May the spirit of God Lord God moving Among Us that produces that Brotherhood I pray Lord if there's any Lord any Lord that's got a little cold a little indifferent Lord may I pray God your spirit just moving even right now Lord just to move upon those cold places Lord May the spirit of God the great love of God just moving down lord and to warm every area of our life Lord God we need you Lord we're here as your sheep father and Lord like Ruth oh my no doubt Lord God as she was so thankful to come into that Fellowship that Fellowship Lord together around the table little did she know that what would start at the table would continue on into full Fellowship Lord Jesus help us Lord we want to be more

again but you know it's one of those things that I would as brother Bram would recommend to the to others as well he said if there's any question then you go ahead and be re-baptized you never want there to be any question in your mind I can remember how it was in my life you know young 13 years old when I was baptized but when God really got a hold of my life when I was 19 years old it just meant something different it was something I knew that what what God was doing and where he brought me to and you know and that's the thing that we've we've always stood upon that if there's any anything at all that you feel to do or you want to clear out then hey there's nothing wrong with that whatsoever so we just want to just pray and join in prayer together with our sister and and may

years of of [Music] old I started an a journey I was very happy and excited I always pray to God to continue leading my way and have mercy on me I started the journey very well but because Satan doesn't want to see a child of God happy then he did all he could to take me back down I arrived here to America I came with my auntie I started Living a miserable [Music] life I got on point to which to die because I asked myself what is happening in my life God never promised a child of his to suffer [Music] I started Living a bad life until I felt like I am not deserved to call the child of God sometimes it gets on point to pray I feel like I can't cuz I don't have strength anytime I try to kneel down I feel I'm Stu [Music] somewhere but one day I was listening to a message Simon of brother William Mario Bram he was preaching about forgiveness and he gave an example of a person that he was in prison he was about to die they sentenced him to death but the governor stood up and told him you are free you are free to go but he could not believe because he was already ready he know that I'm going to die he never believed him and he asked him how is that possible that I'm about to live and be free brother brandham said no matter what no matter how is your sin but if you can accept the pardon you are free no matter what you have done in your life prostitution drinking [Music] lies but once we accept them for to be forgived you are free to go let give me strength I pray to God I ask God please give me just last chance give me last chance so I can stand again on my feet today I am here I left the message I knew brother Bram said there is no relationship between a Believer and unbeliever I knew it but I ran from the face of Lord and wanted to do my [Music] way but today I am here I prayed so hard on point I feel like I don't even deserve to pray cuz even though I pray God will never forgive me he will never forgive me cuz all I have done in my life I knew the truth and I ran from it I decid to get baptized in those Sabbath days the time I was there and I want to be baptized in that church again I had the voice in my heart telling me you deny me like Peter did you knew the truth and now you deny me you're going to be baptized in three names I started crying I asked myself what can I do I had no options not until one day I was sleeping in the night I dream that terrible dream this message my brother brothers and sisters we should not take it for granted I had that dream I were going back in Africa to see my parents then I arrived somewhere I could not pass I saw a white man standing in front of me when I want to pass you going my way you cannot go when I tried to go this said stand in my way you're not going anywhere then I saw a lamb white lamb another white man climbing on the sitting on that [Music] lamb and then I asked myself I asked him why you guys don't want me to pass I want to go they say you're not going anywhere after that I found myself on Cemetery fire started coming from in the Cemetary I could not find my way myself I started burning there but I saw a picture of brother Bram coming from up to down I saw him [Music] and then I said brother Bram why are you coming [Music] down after that he [Music] said this is the last day this is the end of the world and then I started moving I met with my two brother Brothers back in Africa in our church they asked me sister where are you going I told them I'm going back home I asked them did you see sister mapenzi that is my friend sister since in childhood we were baptized together then they told me since morning they're looking for her she's not to be found her parents are crying they don't know where to find her they were coming from the CH they going home and they went there they left me alone and that day I saw this W turned into fire I was very scared it was a scary moment then I came out from my dream in that day I deci said no matter what no matter how I have sinned I will
