week in it you didn't feel this presence this week then you come together with brothers and sisters of light freshest faith it just Lynn Lynn depart and you'll end your part and here the presence of God just comes down let me tell you something he didn't come down just for them he came down for you amen that's why God works through a mini membered body amen amen so we just thank God for His mercy this morning oh my what a wonderful atmosphere wonderful atmosphere we have some needs and requests that we want to take before the Lord I'm just gonna ask you to join with me to prayer cloths here I'm gonna pray over one is for a need a little little child there the classroom for sister Maria works and the little boy sister Maria it's a little boy right my sister Maria sister Maria it's a little boy right it's a little this young man his mother had spoke to sister Maria yes its difficulty sleeping find him just laying in the bed at night his eyes wide open 3 o'clock in the morning I believe God cares I believe that then the other need is the Richard sister Maria's granddaughter Liliana God knows the whole inner workings within that need you know the doctors they're searching they're looking and you know she's been admitted there and they're looking at doing tests but we just want to come together and what we believe we know him to be the same yesterday today and forever he knows the need in the condition that's there and he's more than able to meet that need we just want to take these requests on to the throne of God there's also another need yesterday throughout the day I got a text real early in the morning about 4:30 in the morning some of you had prayer meeting remember from the church there in Connecticut there was a sister that had went in last last Thursday not this Thursday and she you know it had high blood pressure she was pregnant in the situation that was taking place retaining water I don't know the medical term but some of you would would know that and they had to take the baby at 27 weeks and deliver it and the couple the family when I got the text yesterday morning they were called to the hospital and you know when it delivered that young the lungs themselves are not fully developed like they should be sometimes you as doctors and medical staff you realize sometimes that they will give if they know something is early on and they're going on they'll give a shot that'll start working to develop those lungs even while the baby is in the womb that didn't take place and there's a lot of logistics with it but in all things then we're praying and looking at this throughout the day I get a text yesterday evening and then on the phone last night the little baby went on home and so you know us you're just sometimes you well you don't have words you don't have words to say you just you just express your love and I just want you to pray with me and continue to help its brother Daniel and sister Grace there was their their names just was so heavy on my heart us you know I I've never been there my wife and I had a miscarriage once but never had where it was a baby that had come forth and so maybe maybe there's some that are standing here that I'm unaware of that you have been there or maybe I just forget about it but but we can enter in on behalf of them that God would just comfort this sometimes you go through things like that and know within the family there's been multiple miscarriages and you know things can begin to look at why why me Lord that's a logical question but you know within the midst of that time God he cares there's things that we cannot you cannot understand we're not able to explain that when you look at God's sovereignty you can take God's sovereignty throughout the scriptures and you'll witness sometimes his sovereignty who will permit lives to walk into a fiery furnace and then other times he'll keep lives out of it that's God's sovereignty we don't try to explain that and as I've said over and over with things sometimes they come come about we never get over it but God gives us grace to get through it and I said it like this last night when I was talking with the deacon that was their brother and I said you know I think of what David said when that little boy said you know here was a boy said this was conceived and under the wrong manner said but yet look at God's grace to that child that child went right into the presence of God David lifted himself up off of the ground and he says after it had passed and he says they cannot come to where I am but I can go to where it is and you know let's just pray that God will just give that comfort he's a comforter isn't he let's just pray it's a you know those of you are standing as a mother this morning you know that God can use your prayer this morning to reach to that need as you would enter a new father you'll be able to enter in on behalf of that on behalf of these other two needs that we're gonna pray over let's just pray together Lord Jesus father you are the same yesterday today and forever and you are our comforter Lord you Lord supply every need Lord you give grace Lord all gone that is needed in each moment and the strength that's needed Lord we stand here this morning Lord for brother Daniel and sister grace Lord though they would be states away Lord just some nine hours away but father you're omnipresent Lord you're the omnipotent God the omniscient one knowing all things Lord and dear God I just pray that father than you would just comfort them Lord in the midst of this time Lord Oh God come from brother Daniel Lord God as a father and as a husband Lord and sister grace Lord in the family Lord we just ask God that you were just ministered to them Lord by your sweet Holy Spirit Lord you're a comfort Lord you're a comfort Lord and Lord we just ask that you'll just minister to them Lord let them know your God your love just as you move through the local body their Lord and brothers and sisters Lord would be sending text and Ed greetings and just as they walk up the Lord and express their love and this time Lord God the Lord that's the greatest expression Lord God that can be done in this moment Lord because father you'll bring everything Lord God around Lord you'll bring everything together we just pray for them Lord this morning Lord we lift up Lord these needs that Lord I hold prayer cloths for Lord O God we pray father for that little boy in Lord car then Lord laying there at night Lord with his lives wide open Lord oh god I pray that father that Lord God is this prayer cloth Lord is applied by faith Lord we are not st. Paul but you are still Jesus Lord you're still to save God and Lord we just ask the Lord the Holy Ghost would just accompany Lord O God is the prayer cloth is laid upon Lilliana Lord I pray that God the Lord Jesus our prayers Lord as we're just coming together Lord God is one great incense of offering Lord to be offered up the Lord on this behalf Lord according to your word Lord for you said of two or three agree as touching any one thing Lord that I'll do it Lord ask the father anything in my name and I'll do it Lord we're asking in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then Lord God that you would move Lord God upon this situation lord o god o lord we're not smart Lord we don't know Lord God the medical term but even if we did that would not help us Lord but Lord we're looking to you Lord God you're the Great Physician Lord you're the one Lord God and we're asking Lord to come on the scene Lord God and that you would perform your word Lord God on behalf of your children Lord God has a faith Lord to reach out Lord God and present these needs Lord before the throne of God I pray the Lord that you'll just come Lord God may your sweet Holy Spirit Lord God just move Lord God upon your word Lord God and father upon these lives Lord we pray Oh granted Lord for your glory Lord we love you Lord we're so thankful Lord that we can come to you Lord were needy people and before Lord we

stairs Lord thank you God that you would invite us Lord God and how then Lord we're here in the house Lord thank you for moving in our hearts O God for every petition lord thank you for stabilizing Lord our sites or God upon the promise Lord thank you Lord God o Lord for our hearts Lord being established in you Lord that when the winds Lord would begin to blow Oh God we're thankful that we find a place Lord under the shadow of that week's Oh God we love you Lord this morning Lord we just ask the Lord for every other need that's gathered here Lord there's many needs among us Lord will not come here this morning to be seen we've come to hear from you Lord we've come Lord to yield Lord God our lives Lord that you might move among us in a special way Lord you know every need that's gathered here Lord and now I just ask the Lord you'll direct Lord God the thoughts that you've laid upon my heart Lord o God help me just to be just as an instrument Lord but you can express what needs to be expressed this morning Lord and may God you find Lord in our hearts hearts that are open and receptive Lord to receive from you Lord o Lord we love you this morning Lord may you just come Lord and have your way in a special way we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen god bless you just want to remind you is returning in the scriptures here if you could go to salve for Samuel 13 with me please just want to remind you be a prayer-meeting again this coming Tuesday evening there'll be no service this coming Thursday in preparation for the meetings let's just be in prayer amen for the services I've heard the prayer requests already that's went up and you know when we have meetings that are set aside that's like this we don't do this to take up time we don't do it to take up time but we we set aside a time just to be able to be gathered together with a special purpose in mind I believe any every time we come to the house of God there is we come here with expectation we come together in these times of special meetings and I think how brother Branham expressed it and mighty God unveiled before us we come together and we putting our licks of fire together and there are needs that law in this in this moment there will be special needs that God will come on the scene and you'll meet those needs I believe that I'm expecting that with all my heart that God will direct the ministering of the word direct the services however that he wants to take it and it'll be a very special very special time within our lives because of him and we want to give ourselves to the Lord even in prayer throughout the week and being here in the services of the Lord you make every effort to be here because remember these services they're there they're for you they're for me they're for us as an assembly sure we'll have visitors and I know there's visitors already coming from other places but remember we're coming together here to receive from the Lord when the very first thing before they ever walked out of Egypt and a deliverance it was already made known when the Moses was told by God to tell them we want to go out in a three day's journey and offer feast unto the Lord and you see that very thing they were set aside for that purpose and even fail hardened himself and would not and said I will not allow you to go out and worship you know Satan knows exactly when we go through different things in our life he knows when these types of things come about when meetings are set brother and sister this is a time to really just be consecrated to God that God would just come among us and move and all of everything that can be about our lives God is able through that ministering of the word through his presence coming at that time he's able to relieve oppression he's able to relieve bondage you believe that he's able to fill with the Holy Ghost he knew all of that this morning that's true but you take three services times where we're just focused in just consecrate it in if I had my way we would have three services like that every week but I did whatever we can do within that but it let's set let's let our hearts be set aside within that and let go on let's just invite him to come on the scene make every effort to be here I've heard the announcements about helping out and so forth let's just tell you last year when when I witnessed you know we were not able to get in the building right away you remember when that happened last year and then you know it really was something even as brother bill testified you know within and he said I you know finally when everybody got there they opened the building and you just see everybody just pitching in and I'll tell you why it was a wonderful time you would have never known and if you showed up a few moments late and after all the table was laid out beautifully in the food and all those things you'd have never known it's just like we walked out of the service some of you were there you you were there waiting outside you had your green beans in your hands and you know everything else and so forth and you know you were waiting and and here I'll come out and we can't get a hold of the lady we can't get ahold of her the place isn't opened I said oh my well let's find a pastor but you know God moved on it you know just something I don't know how we're gonna do it but I know it's the enemy fighting the enemy fighting and so you know we just we're just so thankful to the Lord and I just appreciate each and every one of you and well let's let's read because I can stand here and talk to you let's read here let's do for sake of time just go to verse 11 for Samuel 13 11 and here is Samuel speaking to Saul what hast thou done and Saul said because I saw that the people were scattered from me and that thou camest not within the days appointed and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at McMath may God bless you as you're being seated bless His Word and let me just keep on reading here just a few scriptures therefore said I the Philistines will come down upon me to Gilgo and I have not made supplication unto the Lord I forced myself therefore and offered a burnt offering now you'll notice just in that that phrase I forced myself anytime where it's us forcing ourselves itself sometimes you can this can be gather and I want you to understand this here sometimes pressure itself can come just when someone could say to you well you know they want you to do something and so here they'll maybe give you a scripture or they'll give you this and they want you to do it and you know it's just like sometimes you can have the the pressure and things like this where people say well if you really have love in your heart if you had love in your heart this is what you'd be doing I'm just saying to you in this in this manner God's Word is always true but God never intended for us just to simply do his word or to somewhat seem to do it without our heart in it before the word can ever take effect it must be our heart that's in that word and that's why within things sometimes there could be pressures of trying to arrange things and get things together but you see it's just like this as I was just speaking you know when we look at healing and you look at healings sometimes and I'm just speaking some in a place where just ministering and just spoke on healing and you know sometimes when there can be even divisions and other things that are taking place or you know even within a family or within a church or whatever more you know the one of the first signs of healing is things that it takes place where your heart longs for healing that's that's where it has to be healing has to long from within the heart when God the Bible says concerning this when Israel is restored and when Israel comes comes to that of the Lord to know the Lord and to know him in the true atonement the Bible says in the Book of Isaiah that when he comes Envy will be removed it speaks of how that God stirs their heart up and their heart begins to look for him the Bible says in the Book of Ezekiel concerning that of Israel he says I'll take that which is two sticks and I'll make it one stick you see why will that be because the application of Jeremiah 29:19 when you shall seek me with all your heart then I shall be found of you so God brings healing from that of the inside first so I say to this this morning if you have a desire and a longing for healing and a desire just as I gave that example in the word when you have a desire for it then you are in a place that God is able to move to bring that to pass otherwise it becomes us forcing ourselves let me just say this very clearly we don't want to do something simply because it's just well this is what it says do we want to go according to the word and submit our hearts to him but that's how we go according to the word is submit our heart to him and we can look at things and say Lord remedy my heart let everything within my spirit let it all be lined up to match what the conditions are called for in the promise you see God word sovereignly as we were looking at this last week God saw moved in a place to where he felt the pressure and he began to look around him instead of just saying this is what God told me to do and what God told me to do he said he would meet me here and I'm just going to stay here but instead Saul took the pressures and through reasoning he actually before he ever moved to offer up the burnt offering which was not his place it was not his position he already was being moved to that in his heart through reasoning fear and all and all of that works together with doubt and worry all of those things come together and he was being moved within that place instead of standing on the word of God think of when God spoke to Abraham wouldn't this just let's just kind of finishing this point here with meeting God and his promise think of how God spoke to Abraham each time and he told Abraham come out to a land I'll show you Abraham had to journey out in order for God to show him he had to meet him in the word that God had spoken then you think of it as we would you know move forward here so many years to where here is here is Isaac fifteen years after after coming forth here he is as a 15 year old young man packing the wood up the mountain and to think of how that Abraham at that time was asked by God go and offer up Isaac not only the only Son go offer him up and I and Abraham went according to the commandment of the Lord not questioning anything that's a paradox let me say this to you it's the same way of a paradox in your life and in my life and that is God's working it was not Abraham that brought himself to that place it was God by His grace moving in Abraham's life Abraham had to repent a lot Abraham had to make things right Abraham had to you know focus even beyond the misunderstandings of the promise but yet within it all this is the paradox Abraham's faith grew to the place that God could see what laid in Abraham all it takes is a maturing of that faith and God matured that faith in Abraham to where Abraham could stand there on Mount Moriah and offer up their Isaac and he was ready to draw back the hand and remember even to that very moment but here the age of the Lord would speak in that moment and say Abraham stay thy hand for in this I'll know that thou lovest me and thou fearest me how that God met Abraham right there in the promise of the word you see this is where it comes that with whatever that God has spoke to our heart sometimes when God speaks to our heart in the service it may be things that we don't feel or seem like maybe it's just so spiritual but yet it's something that has spoke to our hearts let your heart be loosed to that and just obey it and you watch God come on the scene you know the Bible says where we were reading last week in in the Book of Numbers their numbers 29 and it speaks of how that they were given charge is there to that of the Levites and each one had their charge and you know and I the word that I think I was searching for last week is how it was words that they were there were different ones in the Levites who were Porter's or keepers and some had to tend to the fine flour some had to tend to the vessels but all of them had their post of duty and their responsibility if one let down it would affect the supernatural working of Almighty God the Bible says right down through that in numbers 29 where we looked at it last week it speaks of the commandment of the Lord but to realize that the supernatural it does not work outside of the commandment of the Lord but the supernatural works in conjunction in unity with the commandment of the Lord you know the Bible says that he gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey Him the Bible is very clear that God he loves obedience and just simple obedience just simply take him at his word and we stand on that and just doing our part doing our part has an assembly each and every one of us as we come together each and every one of us here maintaining our position but God has called us to then within that right there there's times of some things as we'll look at it here in just a few moments that sometimes there's things that are being done that if we're not careful we don't give the value to what God has purposed in our life and we begin to look and we're looking at the supernatural and failed to recognize that commandment itself following his word is what invites him to come on the scene you see when we consider the Gov promises that God has fulfilled in this our brother branham you know would make a statement you know any ease dealing with this in the Topeka Kansas series and he says that many other times but he's dealing with the people that they might recognize the presence of God and brother Branham was letting him know he said before I called the prayer line he said I'm gonna call the prayer line he said but before I do that he said I want to make sure he said there are seeds that are sown so that you know exactly what to expect and then how when you go forth from here so that you're healing it stays with you so he's bringing this out here within that time that how that you know within it the word itself being sown and as we'll live under that word then that invites the supernatural to come on the scene now be honest with you many times and with all of us we would like to see that of the supernatural we love the supernatural we love how that God moves but you see God will only move through him by his word well we're not interested in a work of and that's not what the bride is is about we enjoy we love the moving of the Holy Ghost we enjoy how the Holy Spirit moves but remember he moves the spirit itself is the current that moves through the conduit of the word so where the word is preached then the Holy Spirit can come behind it is that right so now when we when we would look at this here within the word and I want to continue on that this morning as we look at Romans 12 on maintaining your position and when we look at this that although there were charges that were given to each one of them within Israel just as there are charges that are given and responsibilities for each and every one of us it is very very important that we do not allow or try to take as it were a gift or an attribute of talent whatever God has placed there within our life and tried to operate it on our own strength it must be God to operate it to bring it forth to his glory it doesn't matter you know well what it would be it has to be that it's surrendered to him you know I think about it it's the glory of God for him to manifest himself through the housewife in her position in Christ and every family office in every ministerial office and every member of the body of Jesus Christ now I want you to watch this here in verse 1 we ended here last week but I want to pick up here in verse 1 and Paul said I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service now nobody can do that but you nobody can do this but me brethren by the mercies of God you see God's mercy grants to us what's needed in order for us to be able to take that apply it to our lives that we might present our bodies acceptable unto Him how holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service you realize that this even when we look at the Levitical priesthood each one of them this was the duty and responsibility that they would keep themselves in a place that God would be at liberty to come down and to use them according to what he had appointed them to just because they were appointed to this office or to this position or they had this it didn't mean that it was just something that it was just going to take place but rather within that to value it and to make yourself available that God Himself can come down and use the gift and you please and use that attribute that he's placed within your life now look out look out verse 2 goes on it says and be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God amen that that speaks in verse two of the expression of that word in our lives that's the expression of the word in our lives look in verse three here now here we get down into service for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think Paul knows that's a problem the Spirit of God knows that's a problem not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think how could that be how could that get to a place it can come to a place if we begin to look at the things that things maybe that we're seeing things that we're looking at things that maybe we don't have difficulties but we see it in in some other thing and if we begin to look at that and look at it in a manner as though it's something that we have done and we find ourselves beginning to become elevated and it's not God elevating us it's us elevating ourselves but every man and here's how Paul deals with it let every man not think more highly of himself than he ought to think but to think soberly my so the contrast if you're not you're thinking more highly of yourself you're intoxicated on something you're thinking too much about you but let every man think soberly according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith it's God that had dealt a measure of faith it is not you that dealt it to yourself let me say this everything that God by His grace has allowed you to see it is truly because of his grace it is something that when we look at it but when we look at friends with revelation revelation itself and this is something that is not new to us but real true revelation does not make us puffed up that's what knowledge does revelation brings humility because we recognize it's our little nough sits God's greatness if it wasn't for him we wouldn't see what we see and that revelation breaks within our heart see how it all works together so that here then we stand to present ourselves as a living sacrifice unto God look in verse 4 for as many have members for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and every one members one of another having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith so apologist wrote about the different measures of faith then he's dealing with that of the proportions of faith the same thing it let us operate according to what God has ordained and chose for our lives God listen now God he had he had chose Saul to be king remember that he wouldn't remember when everything itself is falling away from Saul God reminded him through Samuel when that was called what's thou not little in 9 own eyes but you see Saul got away from littleness in his own eyes slowly and yet it wasn't something that Saul was somewhat announcing but Saul got away from the position that God was had there anointed him for now listen to me he was anointed as king of Israel he was anointed but ninny in the midst of a situation this was a testing and a trying time for Saul that under pressure was Saul gonna stay with the word or word he succumbed to pressure pressure is not what brings and invites God as far as us succumbing to that that does not invite God on the scene to fulfill his word and to think of how that within where Paul would let this be mentioned you know as Saul stood as a king Saul was a blessing as he could stand as a king but when Saul intruded and stepped over into that and tried to occupy the office of a prophet he was out of the will of God I don't care how light the sacrifice looked I don't care how orderly and look he was out of the will of God he was out of position and God was not responsible this is live being in the will of God it ought to be the very a goal that we seek for it ought to be what we labor for and in France this is where that was prayer itself it comes in within it Lord let me stay in the center of your will not just letting it be something while I'm a believer you know the footsteps of the righteous are ordered and God's just going to open this there God doesn't work through a haphazard attitude it's got to be something where you are purpose in your life and purposed in my life Lord I want to be in your will and sometimes friends when we look at being in God's will it is in something then we're always waiting for God to come and say get out there I've already told you about it that isn't it at all because there ain't no reward in that but there being in God's will if you look at the first part of this scripture that we're reading it is simply to make sure that we are ready as vessels to be used of God let us be vessels that he can use they're reporters and keepers that had to make sure the vessel snuff dishes whatever was that had to be ready to be used when it was needed let me tell you something God desires within every life that it's ready to be used when he's ready to use it so being in the will of God many times we're looking for things without making preparation for God's will to move in let me give you another example God the Bible says he spoke to Noah and he warned Noah of an impending judgment God made known his will judgment is going to fall prepare an art for the saving of the house if Noah would not have prepared an ark his family would have perished but you see when God spoke to him it raised faith in the voice of God of what God had commissioned and Noah had hard times there's times where he did not know how to turn that corner those clams II didn't know how to approach that child there's times he didn't know how to move in that household there's times he did not know what to do but he knew God had commissioned him to prepare an art so the Prophet said Noah himself he said he was building a miracle preparing for a miracle and he said the Church of the Living God is a living miracle preparing for a miracle you see it's walking in that word and doing what God said do I wonder I wonder where that were there days where Noah did not feel the rushing mighty wind where he didn't feel the presence of God but he kept on pounding away he kept laying in kept putting the pitch forward he kept doing it why because God said I have granted you mercy preparing art and the me tell you something I can say this we on the shadow of a doubt when that rain began to fall and then all of a sudden when that art began to take loose brother you think you talking about a day of Thanksgiving I don't that one moment that Noah was thinking God thank you Lord for the strength day by day to carry on when I didn't feel like it lord thank you Lord God that you gave me the strength Lord by your word what was Noah doing the same thing Abraham did and the same thing you do and the same thing I do we nurse from the strength of El Shaddai I so it's us being yielded in God's hands I don't know what to move I don't know where to do this so I don't know whether don't fret we've all been there friends I hope you're with me this morning we've all been there all of us what do i do do I do this or do I do that do I do this or do it you know and we don't know what to do not I don't know what to do many times I stand and and you know Here I am I I don't know what direction land what do you want me to Prince how do you want me to approach this how do you want me to handle this how do you want me to do this I wait on him that's the same thing you do it doesn't happen too often here but it has happened just even a few weeks ago I have services here that are studied out no here's to series here's to going what do I do I wanted to come this morning and finish out on Thursdays message on Sarah's visitation oh my I just said Lord what but you know what God knows what we need sometimes you're waiting and waiting and just looking there in the last moment and like Paul you're a saying to go do I go this way and you just test the waters and just wait for God to move and God to direct in that situation I'm time saying this to you as one believer to another he is faithful I don't care if it comes down to the last moment he has proved that in his word over and over he's faithful to his word when you stand on his word he'll meet you there you're not defeated you're not defeated no sane man I don't you're not defeated it's not about feelings you hear times you got to cast them down you got to cast them down because that'll try to hinder you being yielded the enemy will try to say all sorts of things because if he can get you rattled then you're not yielded I know it ain't very deep but I just I just want to follow him notice the scripture here in verse 6 having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us problem where their prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith God even shows within this scripture there's varying degrees within gifts there's varying degrees that's why the Bible said this is why Paul would speak to the Corinthian Corinthians and a bad problem of comparing people to people they had a bad problem of either comparing themselves to one another I both said they that do that our fools because you're comparing your flesh to another flesh it's not about the flesh it's the density of Christ inside that flesh its proportion of faith God has many gifts many talents and then even in all of our lives even as husbands every husband is not the same every wife is not the same every father is not the same every mother's not the same you know it's like a last week when it just drops in my heart within it sometimes we're we're defeated if we get into our imagination and get to looking at somebody else l don't want you to be like nobody else I hope you understand me God don't want you to be like brother branham when you carry your Bible in a certain way and you know brother Branham was always this and brother brother God don't once God don't want you to be like brother Samuel he don't want you to be like brother so-and-so and sister he don't want you well I want to be a wife like so-and-so God don't want you looking at nobody else to sit there and say I want to be like that but rather say Lord how you use her and it seems Lord she's just so yielded to you help me to be yielded to you for what you have ordained from me because God has put talents in your life we're living in the hour do not despise small things small things brought together bring a big fire hallelujah I know maybe polish and snuff dishes you know if I'm polishing the snuff this maybe you know nobody sees that but let me tell you something if I don't polish the snuff dishes that are committed to me that I'm hindering the rest of the body I've got a party if if my duty is to make fine flour I might say oh my I want to be the one you know that's cutting the neck up on the lamb there I'd like to be the one that has the blood or or the one that sent me you know if I just do the fine flower it's something that's made available that God can come on the scene I know it's behind the scenes it's things that are not seen but after all this is not a public show he that heíd of himself in secret and pray unto God that all scripture Matthew sit where it's speaking of that of the operation of the third pole of the operation of the word is where that people are relieved from people and it's about pleasing God completely that's who you're to please that's who I'm to please and as you hide yourself away nobody see you cleanest enough dishes nobody hear about the fine flour but when it's needed it'll be there God said he that hide of himself away yeah and I will reward him openly it's a simplicity of us presenting ourselves within the word I say the simplicity because as Paul addressed even in that earlier part right there the battle is us getting over ourselves the battle is us not taking a complex well I want to be used like so-and-so just be used how God wants you to be used brother BAM standing at Oral Roberts place here he is standing here looking around they got machines open in the letters open him up and you know empty him out and on and on and man seeing the marble and everything else brother Bram said I thought of my little trailer he said I wouldn't know boy nobody seen my office and he said I got to thinking you could finish the quote for me Lord maybe it's because you don't trust me you know what I'm talking about you can get to looking at other situation let me tell you something friends let me tell you it's a church don't you get your eyes on the outside of somebody else you keep your eyes on Jesus Christ you keep your eyes on Jesus Christ if you get your eyes on somebody else somebody else becomes your Holy Ghost somebody else becomes your leadership our leadership is by the Holy Spirit coming through the word that's our source of comfort but he says to him look up see what he was looking at was was affecting him maybe I'm not as good maybe I'm not as they're saying maybe I'm not as that but the Holy Spirit said look up I am your portion this is why the Bible says in Christ who is our life he said he who is our life set if you be risen with Christ set your affections on things above brother man would say it like this in the message he would say who can taking who can who can who taking thought can add one cubit to his stature now he says you can't make your hair black or white you are what you are by the grace of God God had did this not what you done when you try to make yourself something different I'd like to make myself a Billy Graham but it wouldn't do me no good I'd like to make myself a brother Mitchell stand up and preach like that or ern Baxter don't do no good I must be william branham look at this next part I've often thought about brother Roberts and those who pray for this day I've often thought about it same thing you have often thought about and I have often thought about things you know because everything when brother Branham was looking at this with Oral Roberts listen to me brother Branham knew one thing about it that you catch him one thing he is continuing to grow and to learn and his whole part is he wants to make sure that within that that God is fully using him to the full potential that's why he dealt with in the beginning of works was faith Express and he talked about he said when I started out as a young man he said you know he said I was swimming and by the time you got done you were he said but after a while you you learn how to make them strokes he said if you're not learning something's wrong you see with the gift and what God that's placed in your life family office ministerial gift every one of us our part in the body it ought to be there in the whole crowd it ought to be the opening and the land that the Spirit is moving in our life it ought to be where it's creating more of the yielding of self submitting self to the will of God for the glory of God not out I want to be the fine flower guy I want to be the snuff this guy I want to know just let me be God what you want me to be after all brother Branham would point people that you don't even know and I don't even know but how many times that we hear God moving there as we're listening to the message and brother banner would pull back a curtain and say it's because they have laid on their face day and night praying and then he would point back to back home and he would admonish the people it was just something he said pray for me when I go overseas but it's your prayers I'll tell you this right here every time when I stand there at a place if God wants me to go and help somewhere for the minister I'm counting on your prayers when you say 'mother Samuel I'm praying for you and I ask you to pray for me because I'm counting on those prayers because I don't know many times what God wants me to even minister sometimes I'm waiting there Lord what do you want for these people Lord can I just be honest with you years and years ago that has scared me to death but now by His grace I could look at a situation I say this for the girl glory of God and you could ask me what are you going to preach I can tell you I don't know some of you been with me in different times but the same in what direction you think you're good I don't know but I know this if he let me he'll meet me sometimes just come right at the last moment it had been something way way out there but how did God will bring her wrong in unction of something there and it'll just drop but you know what it's just being that do you think of how that the Prophet it came to such a place to where there he was standing in Sabino Canyon and the sword came down in his hand and he was commissioned go back and open the seven seals and he goes back to minister he preaches God hiding and rear hiding and simplicity revealing himself the same he preaches the breech and he stands her in the breech he said I don't know no more what the first silliest then nothing standing here tonight but you know what it was God promise I'll meet you there [Applause] if we'll follow his commandment it will invite the supernatural then next morning when brother Branham was standing along a certain line he said I was about ready to make a mistake but he came in the room you see standing in obedience it invites the angel of the Lord to come many times we want the angel of the Lord then we'll obey I know it's simple but I'm just saying it's just like this they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that's God's Word the Bible says repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's God's promise the been said I've often thought about brother Roberts those who pray for the sick the way they did the way they did how these brethren go out and pray for a great host there's no kickbacks if they didn't pray for this one or that one but I can't be all Roberts God made oil Roberts what he is I have to be William Brennan and all Roberts can't be William Brennan so we are what we are by the grace of God so it's all set together in the church for the perfecting of the church the working together of the good for those who love God and I'm gonna tell you the gift and all that what's in your life it's for my benefit how you yield yourself to the Lord I benefit from it we benefit from the yielding as one another are yielded we benefit benefit from gifts that are yielded attributes that are yielded we benefit yeah somebody sings a song hey listen anything that's done in the Church of the Living God ought to be done for the edification of the body and then the Bible says in Ephesians if they believe it's Ephesians 5 it talks of how Ephesians 5 Ephesians 4 how did the body itself it maketh to the edifying of itself in love how does the body edify itself by receiving that edification into its life you know somebody can tell you they appreciate you but it depends on how you take it the word can come but it depends on how you take it well I'll you know how they they divide you're saying that and they didn't you listen you can hear all the criticism you can hear all the negativity but you need to also understand God has people that'll speak to your heart that'll encourage you that'll bless you that will encourage your walk with the Lord you say blessed God I don't need that you're lying you do need it if you just let go for a little bit and realize it with him that we all need encouragement one from another and that means even when you don't feel like encouraging somebody else a sacrifice is not a sacrifice unless it's a sacrifice there's sometimes you got to go out of your way and other times get out of your way Paul goes on to say or ministry let us wait on our ministry remember how many would tell brother brother branham now that we've received the Holy Ghost should we go ahead and go to school and learn how the preach and we should we look to receive gifts brother Graham said don't you do that you get yourself right out of the land out of the will of God stay before God if God wants you to do something he equips you to do what he's called you to do and believe me whatever he calls you to do you won't feel adequate but it's not your equipping he equips you let us wait on our ministry how many times through the scripture how many times you hear brother REM say now you know he says what I'm waiting on I'm waiting on him [Music] I believe there's times we need to wait more sometimes we have situations that are in your home you need to wait more as a husband sometimes you need to wait more as a dad wait more see part of the waiting is to make yourself more available if you're waiting turns to bitterness and resentment you're pushing him away I've been praying and God even answered I've been looking to God you see what it is God can't come on that attitude I can't move that way it takes a submissiveness to him in order for him to move let us wait on our ministry how do we wait how do you wait the Bible says waited pray wait on the Lord and he shall strengthen thine heart the Bible says in the book I believe it's a Book of Lamentations it is glory for a man to wait and go hope with an expectation that is coming to wait on the Lord and he shall renew that strength this is God's promise let us wait on our ministry or he that teacheth on teaching or he that exhorteth on exhortation he that giveth let him do it with simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that showeth mercy with cheerfulness let Samuel you mean if God and moves upon my heart to go show mercy that's a part sure it's a part sure it's apart it's to maintain that position of what God has equipped and called us to do how many times as you know brother brems say I'm waiting on him you know the Bible tells us that how can they go preach the gospel except they be sent he's alright Peter would even speak to it I'm not going to read it that Peter would even speak and express that how that now he would express that the gospel is preached with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven so the Holy Spirit delivering that word in acts 13 the Bible talks about there were certain prophets and acts 13 1 certain prophets there in the in the church prophets and teachers and it goes through their names and the Bible says in verse 2 as they ministered to the Lord and fasted they were ministering to the Lord stay faithful and what God has called you to do I'm just gonna say this sometimes we get to looking at God's will and we look at it in the wrong way talk to him do digital's there some months ago you know there was a an individual I had come in contact with and they said well you know I don't know what God wants me to do with my life and you know I've went to college here and I've done this but you know I'm just I'm just praying right now I don't know what God wants me to do I said so what are you doing are you doing something right now are you going to school well no I'm just waiting on God to show me let me tell you from a personal testimony you know you need to get in school so what you need to do is present yourself and ask God to come and meet you sometimes we're waiting on God to push us into things God does not delight in pushing us see part of maturity this is part of maturity maturity is a well I could explain this and I can explain this and I can explain that there's times where people can explain all sorts of things but they've never matured in the ABCs of the gospel that's what's important that's what makes the word live you can know all the mystery but it's a hat those ABCs in your life always believe Christ but presents yourself and what's for God to show don't sin and don't do nothing you sisters sometimes you don't know what to make for dinner so what do you do do you just sit down and say well I'm just gonna wait huh I don't know what to do no you know what you do you started getting out cookbooks you start pulling out old recipes you start visiting some places that are familiar to you and about that time here with whatever the condition of the day is maybe it's a day you're all frazzled and all of a sudden it just drops this be a great day for casserole you gotta breathe got to be presenting yourself now listen those are simple natural examples but listen friends God can't do nothing if we don't present ourselves for us waiting it's us presenting ourselves but it's not presenting ourselves saying Lord I'll do this but that other I'm doing that ain't doing that Lord if you'll just let me be this I'll do it I'll serve you but that other no Lord I'm called for this over here and I know I can really be a benefit you miss words I know I can be a benefit the reality I is a hindrance you don't need nobody nobody needs a title to do anything you don't need a table well I don't seem specials that often I don't you don't need a title to do that just to be a surrendered vessel to God here's what they did in verse 2 they ministered to the Lord stayed before him in his presence and fasted boy when's the last time that's been done and the Holy Ghost said separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work there and to have called them and when they had fasted and prayed notice and when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them they sent them away verse 4 look how God looks at this so they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost if anybody else just looking at it they say ah that was just man sending a man out nope that was people who were waiting on God and the body yielded themselves and after God said separate me Paul and Barnabas they continued praying and fasting and they laid their hands on them and sent them away and the Bible says the Holy Ghost sent them forth it was God working through the body in the midst of that time first Peter chapter four Bible says as every man hath received the gift even so Minister the same one to another as stewards of the manifold grace of God that word manifold is variegated variegated is anything multiple multiple colors multiple its manifold its variegated God the Holy Spirit listen to me the Holy Spirit it baptizes us into one body and I'll say like this you act like a Christian you talk like a Christian and you behave yourself like a Christian that's what the Holy Ghost does in the house of God I'm not just talking about these walls but the other thing the Holy Ghost will do is it will manifest itself according to the gift and the measure that's been given in the life for it to minister through your life what a brother brems said I can't have a place like well Robert so I ain't gonna do it I'm gonna do it now does they gonna help out at all winds are not blowing but that means seeds falling sometimes you got a plant seed in order for the rain to come you see it all not matter whether you sing every service or not it all not matter whether you pray every service or not you don't not matter any of those things you might say but say me this is all elementary this should all be well I'm just Bob just obeying him and I'm just letting you know that whether you do or whether you don't your part is just as vital in this service you're praying in this service as you sit there and you pray even as the word is coming forth how do you know that it's not your prayer as your setting they're submitting your heart that allow the Holy Spirit to move on other needs in the Assembly or do we just look at it and say Lord I'm here about me we've got to maintain our position do what God has called us to do God might have you know there might be somebody administrating them then they only Minister maybe like once or twice a year but if they'll do that faithfully God will bless them there's people right here sitting right here brothers and sisters in this church that don't have any title of a position but you know what they don't need one they haven't let it hinder them they've operated for the body when God has moved on their heart to this they did it they are obedient to the Lord I say God bless you sometime titles only make heads bigger I'm sorry I'm so simple but it's just the truth verse 11 if any man speak let him speak as the Oracles of God if any Minister let him do it has the ability with God giveth that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ to whom be praised and Dominion for ever and ever Bertram goes into talking about a gift he said a gift it's not something you take and use it but a gift he said is what surrendered to God I tell you even with natural attributes in our life gifts and talents as a husband as a wife as a father as a mother it needs to be surrendered in God's hands I said it needs to be surrendered in God's hands walking under the leadership of the Holy Ghost not trying to perform things on our own but letting God sewing the word and inviting God to come on the scene sometimes we want to see things happen we all do there's certain change we want to see let us not be conformed to the world and go back and say I don't see it the way I want it so what glory is that where is faith that was in that where is service at within that a gift is not something that's taken and that's where it's manipulated with hands so many times I've said this years and years ago even before I was pastoring you know so many times the word and the phrase nickel ad anism it is used my it's used and everything every time that it's used it's um many times it's used in a manner of well a pastor controlling this in the past and I'm not saying there hadn't been situations been like that but this is why I look at friends the word itself you've got to be careful then it doesn't become as I've said before reverse Nick and lady anism where the congregation wants to control the pastor where people want to control what's going on that's the spirit of Nicolini anism sometimes you don't look at well how did that come in how did that white horse rider come in he come in innocently but this is a power prayer and fasting just like everybody that comes here hey they might come here and visit and I think of it like what brother Dan days ago he said you come here and you may not believe as we believe but we'll let you borrow our rules for the weekend I believe in Liberty of the Holy Ghost and so the brother that came here some months ago I told him I'm off as I said I'm gonna tell you why right now we believe in worship and we believe in the word and you obey the Lord we believe in it not wet blankets here we believe in that you'd be obedient to God you let God lead you and you preach the word we'll be right there with you sometimes you go to different churches and every church is sovereign my goodness you know I'm over there you know times when I've went well well not only when I was in Africa I'm down went down to South Carolina and the young people were down there with him they said we thought she was gonna get hit that's come off the black people run up to the platform praise God I mean almost right in the platform with me little if I come off the platform I'm surrounded they're just swinging the fit praise God Here I am preacher and right through not just sitting down they're everywhere they're rejoicing in the Lord there's some zippers service is different than this one are different than that one what do you know fit right in with them cuz I didn't have a problem where I had a problem with staying in that office back there I want to be out there on the floor with them every Church is sovereign that's why when you go anywhere you don't go anywhere and try to take this church as though it's a pattern and put it on some other church you'll hinder that service and you're hidden or God even speaking to you if they've got an hour and a half song service you clap your hands and get right in there and enjoy it if they take up paths and offering three times in one service you be right in there you understand what I'm saying it's things it's like that that that doesn't matter what matters is his presence him the word the Prophet was clear when you choose a church you choose it based on the word and the moving of the Holy Ghost that's how you choose a church boy a gift is not something that you put in your hand and try to operate but you get yourself out of the way sometimes that's that's the whole battle brother and that's the whole battle lord help me get out of the way you know many times you spend more time in prayer I'm telling you from experience god help me get out of the way help me get out of the way help me get out of the way the heart and learn everything Lord let it be clear let it be set aside help me get out of the way like a little wood goes this is the guy it's my enemy he's the one that gets in the way brother Brent would say many times thinks he can do something about it that's what a ministry said he don't preach what he wants to preach tell me you know what I'm talking about even as a father as a mother as a husband as a grand grandpa grandma sometimes there's things you're getting ready to say something and you well here's a battle going on do you know what it is the holy ghost reigning in that tongue it's ain't a moment it's ancient moment they're sitting the time but maybe what you're getting ready to say is the truth but it just hadn't been sweetened the Bible says speak the truth in love you know how it is when you you put your hand in the cookie dough I know it's not politically correct it's got raw egg it's still good you put it in there and you pull it out and say this means more vanilla in it sometimes before we start baking the cookies we need to check the ingredients we're putting in them before we start trying to do things we need to do some no Lord needs to be some more loves in here I'm not I'm not ready I'm not right for them this part right here no if this isn't just right right I need some more more humility right here Lord you'll never be wrong doing that because let me tell you something it in that you're waiting in that time for God to kick you you're making yourself available that it be right in season right in time God operates gifts at various degrees and various times and and so for I'd say I understand God for all the gifts he's put in the body I thank God for the body of Jesus Christ I really do I just all my ministry or gifts I'd love seeing the body operate that's the desires the body would operate my my my my I hope you understand what I'm saying I understand that I'm your pastor I understand we we maintain our positions we don't overstep bound but I also appreciate how you can take the unction of the Holy Ghost and you don't have to ask me can I fold up chairs but Samuel can I get the communion buckets you see a need and do it hey you just see some and move and do it but same you cannot call brother so-and-so I've seen that they weren't in church column you don't have to call me up and ask permission hope this alright if it's not it's free in hell you don't have to ask me that just be obedient to the Lord God lays on your heart to pray for somebody go pray for them you obey the Lord Amen if it's something you feel like you need to you know just to run by me and I'll pray with you while you go pray for them God uses the body amen that's why the Lord comes forth the word comes forth moving in our hearts in our life it stirs that reality up and it's God working through a mini membered body that ought to be the request when God moves on our heart like Paul when he met him face to face he said Lord what would you have me do what do you want me to do Lord what's my part Lord I'm coming down you okay all right brother Joey let's come down here how many times really Bramblett tell us we make the statement I can't take your place and you can't take mine but you'll be your best you do your best with what God has called you to do brother Brown would tell us and this in the message greatest battle ever fought because you know maintaining our position is making sure we fully follow the Lord with what God has called us to do you see but the random makes a statement when you think of it the Stars the planets all of this working in a harmony it works in a harmony it works together brother brems says in greatest our fall he said of that great heavenly host like that has to keep its place to make everything in order what about the disorder of the earthly hosts how when one gets out of order how it throws the whole thing out of cater the whole program of God is upset when one member gets out of order we should continually to strive to keep the order of the Spirit amen help me Jesus when you strive for anything it isn't because it's just coming you've got to give yourself to that give yourself to that that right there to maintain the order of the spirit see maintaining the order of the Spirit is that we maintain our position our position if Jupiter tries to fix Saturn's position Jupiter is out of position trying to fix Center so you're trying to bring Saturn in position and Jupiter's out if one star gets out of the constellation trying to help another one out it fails to give the right sign it's got to maintain its position it can't look and say well I'm just a star in the Little Dipper I want to be in the Big Dipper it has to stay in its position and if it stays in its position it stands there is a light there's a sign that's about its life there's a harmony that's there and it blends together so there is a picture there in the sky and a matter of fact remember brother Ram sells us he wrote the first Bible in the heavens by stars beings being in position so we should continually strive to keep the order of the Spirit no time said I would to God this morning that we could bring this to a real healing service you catch this I would to God we could bring this to a real healing service oh no you mean brother Branham didn't pack the healing service in his briefcase no you mean that day real healing service depended on the entire body that was gathered there yep yep I would hope we would bring this to a real healing service that we could keep this group that we have gathered under the roof this morning in such a harmony that the Holy Spirit would place every member of the body that's here this morning in such harmony till there would be such a spontaneous healing of soul and body if we'll just hold our positions who's the one that does the positioning the Holy Ghost but it will be focused on him if we'll be focused on him he's the one that positions he's the one that places he's the one that delivers he's the one that fills what the Holy Ghost he's the one that heals the sick it has to be him if we want to see that done then let us do what others have done and pray and fast and just make ourself available what I do clean the snuffer dishes make sure the fine flowers ready to go make sure that utensils are clean and ready to be used make sure that your life is a conduit that when the Holy Ghost begins to flow through the service make sure that you're tapped in to the source that he can just flow right through there's not a hang-up there's not a short there's not a grounded wire but you are part of the circuitry of Almighty God you have laid yourself aside during the week and during the day and here you are as wires you are submitted to God that the current of the Holy Ghost could flow in a service and I say this to you this morning I know that we come here many times and there's times that you come that you are coming and you are pressing beyond your feelings let me say this to you just to make sure let's say Lord you stand upon that word you've been feeding on as you've been praying you've been giving yourself to God sometimes the presence that maybe you haven't felt all week it was to test your faith do you still believe he is the ever-present I am with you always and here you've been standing on that word and it's like you come into Mount Moriah you come here and you presented yourself and now here comes the surge of the Holy Ghost sometimes it's the behind-the-scenes things you see it's not what what gets done here what happens here is a result of behind-the-scenes that's where Pentecost failed I know I'm going a little bit but I do see the runway in sight Pentecost they this is where listen to me now this is where the Spirit of God would direct the Prophet and bring the balance where he talked about working the music up y'all gonna preach with me now right if you're not I'm going to anyhow this is where he would bring that and work in the music up what were they doing they were doing it without a consecrated life they were trying to simulate another or we've got to have this it's got to happen like this it's got to do this it's got to do that let me tell you something being happening in the Lord and worshipping and clapping your hands and the music itself moving and people getting excited is not working up in emotion that's of God there might be people who get under their emotion and that's all they get it under the motion but I believe with all my heart I've come here and I believe there's others and you come here this morning as well too we come to enter in we come to worship the Lord we come to give ourselves and they enter in in worship they enter in tibetan through the as the song has been sung these ain't just salt these are words that speak to our life I tell you right now we can shout just as much on it is well with my soul as can't nobody do me like Jesus we know in whom we have believed we are persuaded that he is able hallelujah we praise him with understanding when we watch them we wash up with understanding we know in whom we have believed he's the joy of our life whether this message this revelation it brings joy in our lives he don't bring sourness and this contentment if it's self you got a hold of the wrong grapes the grapes I got a hold of us fully right these grapes packed within them real wide real stimulation hey man it's real joy hello load times it's the behind the scenes you know when you go to see a performance some of you been to see a performance and you go to see it now my that was that was wonderful times you go to see people sing and it's wonderful leaders bring it down to little Fontaine's you think they just get up on the stage and wing it no they practice but they do use themselves to the Lord they take it serious but you see you don't see all the behind the scenes you don't see all the times where they start on the verse say not nothing to stop Ike you're off Paul you're off Sharon you're off Sherri you and Luna you don't see all of that but all that has to be worked out and you and I sit there for the two hours say glory to God getting this wonderful hitting this tremendous woo I tell you it's like a dinner you enjoy that dinner don't happen on its own sometimes the wife is cooking that dinner first as she first has to get over herself of even lacking the confidence and the ability to cook it I know this is simple but you can put this in your dinner bucket need it it help you listen Francis is about the word working out in our life Amen that the word be unhindered this is where the Bible goes on let me just read these scriptures and I see the runway it's coming wives submit yourselves unto your own husband's as is fitting the Lord husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the Lord father's provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged I don't have there's not sufficient time to dwell on those scriptures here this morning but these things here when you look at how that God would speak through Paul in regards to these things it's important but the baton tells us I believe it's Christianity verse idolatry he said people seen the miracles in Martin's ministry he said but the one thing that the people did not see is all the time that Martin spent in prayer sometimes we're looking at things even in the service listen as you stand even within this has a father and a mother let me bring this down there's a father and a mother as a husband and wife as a child young person however you want to you stand within your position and you maintain that sometimes many times it's not easy because of things that we want to try to make happen but it's not up to us to try to make it happen but if these things I just read right here this is one of many places in the scripture these are things behind the scenes that nobody else sees in your house you know with me now I know you're hoping but I wish you'd seen that runway sooner now I see it I see it these are things that we see behind closed doors and let me tell you something when you give yourself to it God honors that you remember what Peter said when the Lord Jesus asked him he said you love me Lord you know I love you you love me yeah Lauren you know what I already said that I love you you love me yeah Lord you know I love you he said then feed my sheep and my lands see it was something he was calling for love that real love to him it bring would bring Peter beyond self when you're converted then you strengthen your brother he would bring him beyond self not just a sheep but the Lambs also so sometimes as a father sometimes as a husband sometimes there's a mom as a wife there's things that you do and you don't feel very spiritual doing that yet it's the Word of God sometimes it's it's it's difficult and you you stand there upon God's Word but look look as you stand on that word that invites God to come on the same I know how it is child the teenager and the my I remember how it was you know when my parents didn't know anything and I knew everything I remember that somehow I lost everything I thought I knew I've been there but then within that it brings you into those places where fathers be not angry lest they be discouraged sure there's some wrong being done but let's also prop up the right it's with a husband that that treatment the Bible says be not bitter against the what it shows there could be things which you could be bitter oh my mind lord help me and wives could be bitter against the husband but there's only one thing that'll calm bitter waters recognize the tree that's in your midst [Applause] cut down that tree what is the cutting down the tree laying down of self that's what Calvary was he sweetened the waters of Marah for us you have the power the authority for your life to be a conduit that can take an atmosphere in the home and change that but don't try to force yourself I'm trying to do this and I don't see this changing and I don't see this just let your heart be there God is faithful to his word he will meet you there the wheels are out I see the stripes on the pavement can I read you these two little places some be afraid if I read why a little bit we don't have church on Thursday I'm we're trying to get that's what they'll be doing to you on Friday because you've been working on Monday I believe that brother Williams served God's purpose in life a real father and I see his darling companion mrs. Williams sitting here a real husband that's one of God's purposes a father one of God's purposes and he was German ties to God by the Holy Spirit God's main purpose what's important you got the main purpose and if you've got the main purpose then he'll help you fulfill all the other purposes Lord I never walked this way before just follow him hmm sometimes sisters what God has even called you to do brothers the care one another I want you to look at this and the unfailing realities of God the emember one's sister methi when brother Branham came in that time and little Joseph was having his little situation and remember the BAM said oh no don't don't don't don't don't do that and sister media said easy for you to say you're not here all the time brothers kind of like you coming out of the office are you coming home from work she's been there all day long juggling things when brother branham entered in for prayer for sister methi in this quote he said father she didn't mean that he said she's iron my clothes she's fixed my dinners she sent me out to the rest of the public Lord she didn't mean it see what he was doing he was bringing before the Lord she's kept her command the commandments she stood upon this right here and look what happened that didn't go unnoticed the Prophet that was called out of his heart it brought it back he's not quick to forget your work in labor of love I wonder how many times sister methi she didn't feel spiritual ironing those shirts ironing those trousers cooking them meals but you know what she was doing it as unto the Lord and even though sister meaty was not on the platform was not standing right there by his side on the platform many times was back home in another place and while he was overseas or in another she was a part of that ministry she did her little part I wonder how many said in the audience in five my brother brems shirt sure it looks nice and pressed my that sister mean he did it's not the focus and if it was somebody's focus they're wrong but I can tell you that wasn't even the focus you see sometimes the snuffer dishes and everything else is not the focus but all of that was put in place so the brother brand could give himself more to the Lord and be used of God and I'm telling you even though there's sometimes there's things that you can do and I can do where you don't feel spiritual we don't feel the presence of God within it but if it's God's Word and God's called you to it you maintain your position and you watch God he comes on the scene to fulfill his word you love him that's the main purpose be Germa ties with the holy ghost and in him maintain your position we'll just stop here let's just pray they would like to be remembered in prayer this morning god bless you would you remember me let's pray Lord Jesus you know our needs Lord Father through your word that you would speak to our hearts Lord sometimes the Lord we know that there are there's Corrections there's alignments there's seed that needs to be sown Lord and you know it Lord you see it and then Lord is that is yielded into you into your hands we give ourselves to it then Lord that invites you to come to work to move in our lives Lord I pray this morning Lord I've been lengthy this morning Lord I had him standing earlier and speaking and talking of some things and Lord but I pray that Lord the thought of maintaining our position and the Lord as you've expressed these things through your word Lord there never is an ending Lord we just could keep going and going but I'm asking Lord that for every hand that's lifted up for every heart Lord that's opening your God if it's not opened me may it just be open to you Laure if there's one that doesn't know you your god in the power of your resurrection Lord may they just Lord God turn loose to you right now and I pray Lord goddess you would place them in the body I pray like wise Lord that God within this service Lord their God within services to follow may we Lord God strive to keep the order of the Spirit Lord as you've taken us many times it's that which is behind the scenes where people are praying giving themselves to you lord I know that's happening but we want to be more fervent Lord all of us we want to be more fervent you want to be more sincere because Lord you're the one that makes that word alive to us in US and through us and we just Lord we want to be as vessels that are yielded presented Lord - you're working - you're leading lord help us help us your God that we may lose such sight of ourselves and mail-order our focus be so inclined be so given to you I pray God that you Lord just grant of your mercy and grace today if their Lord in any area were Lord we've been slack your God from my self as a pastor forgive me Lord his husband's his wives as father's as mother's Lord we just don't we look diligently we just don't hear these things we look diligently to know Lord we have responsibilities your god fathers and mothers across this building grandparents Lord husbands and wives children Lord father help each and everyone Lord maintain to maintain their position Lord to do what you have called us to do help us Lord to you yield and lend of our hearts help us just to be content and just just yielded and satisfied Lord with the calling you've placed on our lives Lord you don't want us all to be the same you don't want us all to sing the same you don't want us all to preach the same you don't want one mother to be like another mother and one father to be like another father or husband or wife that's it's not what you're after but Lord within every life every life as its surrendered to you Lord may our lives be likened unto that the tree when Israel came to the waters of Marah they were looking around oh my oh my they were drinking on that hold why is this water bitter you know the Bible says concerning that of a husband said let him draw water out of his own fountain Lord Jesus I pray that God may we recognize the answer is standing in our midst help us Lord bus Lord God to submit to the Word of God that the life then Lord God that you who comes to perform the word and Lord that you come and perform it Lord Jesus forgive us of our slothful misaligned forgive us Lord of where we've let down for Lord even as the word comes forth and is broken to our hearts we see where we are and we can see where we need to be Father as your prophet would say we study on those parts and he said from where we are connected to where we need to be Lord we're looking to you the Holy Spirit is we would submit our lives laying down our will God that you might have your way Lord you know every need you know every situation your God I pray that you'll have your way this morning may we stand as faithful soldiers and our post ready Lord God and that command ready Lord as you would speak to us to be moved by the unction of the Holy Ghost Granite Lord may you feel Lord every heart with the Holy Ghost feel those this Lord that are filled Lord with the refilling may our hearts Lord be prepared direct us Lord Jesus may we Lord take the value from what you have called us to do and give ourselves to it Lord as we hide away in prayer we give ourselves Lord Jesus to you and Lord just taking up and ministering to those needs Lord it invites you to come on the scene in
