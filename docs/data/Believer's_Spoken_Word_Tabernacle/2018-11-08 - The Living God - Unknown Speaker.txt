Christ father we ask it for your glory in the name of Jesus Christ amen be glorified Lord amen you have your Bibles if you'll turn with me to Exodus chapter three your love him amen appreciate the Lord the services this past weekend am I so good verse one read just a few verses and then we'll let you have your seats now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in the father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of God even to Horeb and the angel of the Lord appeared unto Him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed that's a miracle that's a miracle how could this bush be on fire and yet it's not consumed and Moses said watch the response here and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt God knows how to get his people's attention maybe somebody else we could have walked by there and said wow there must be some reflection on this mountain and just kept going but it was that appointed time God moved on the scene and it held an attraction for Moses and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said Moses Moses and he said here are mine and he said draw not nigh either put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground moreover he said I am the God of thy father the God of Abraham the god of Isaac and the God of Jacob and Moses hid his face where he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their crime by reason of their taskmasters I know their sorrows I wonder let me pause for a moment I wonder how they might have felt under the taskmasters and then the oppression that was growing greater and greater I wonder if the devil would have been trying to whisper to them God forgot about you God forgot about his promise because you know that old slewfoot you know the devil he's always there to try to speak words of doubt but God hasn't forgot you he hasn't forgot his promise glory be to God and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of the land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and they amma rights and the perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites now therefore behold the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them come now therefore and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou may us bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt may God bless you bless his word as you're being seated wants you to notice there in the scripture I have come down but I'm sending thee notice here is God coming in the form of a man in verse 11 the Bible goes on to say Moses said unto God Who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt you know it's something about it that Moses we're were very much aware that Moses had heard of the promise of a deliverer he had actually been told of the peculiarity of his birth and Moses we know and understand that in his own strength he had tried to act upon what he knew to be God's Word but yet it would not be by Moses strength Moses would simply be a vessel that the Living God would come and manifest himself through so you see God works in such a way to bring us into places as he did Moses to where Moses in his self sees his weakness is insufficient sees his inability and by doing that you know we would look at that and we would think well that would that would be the wrong way to go about it but not no it's not it's a way that God has to move among our lives that we can see that elv our own selves we can do nothing and here is Moses standing here with a great question Who am I what has been spoken to be done Who am I you know this very statement right here is actually inviting God to make his plan known to Moses you see it's one of those things if you think about it when you look at magnets and all of these things and magnets and how there's certain metals that are actually magnetized there's properties that will actually go to a magnet you also realize that there's certain times that you can take certain metals and things like this even magnets and you can bang them around in such a way to where that the strength of the pool is not as great as it ought to be but get all of the little ions or whatever you want to call them or steal there all the north and south they're still there but what has to happen is there has to be a magnet that is completely lined up in full strength for it to move across that material and begin to line the parts in there so that the strength itself can actually move and be magnetized it was already here within Moses life but now notice how will God make himself known to Moses Moses has already known the written word he's already read it he memorized it he knows it but that in itself is not the way that God has chosen to make himself known though he is the word but God desires to make himself known because when he is made known then our confidence in what he has already said rises to where it needs to be that he might be able to fulfill his word through you and I now think about it if it wasn't listen as Moses is an electron of God why did God with when we look at it how that God come on the scene why wasn't it just enough for Moses to have the word because the word by itself apart from the Spirit of God God who gave the word was powerless but when God came there who gave that word then you have the God who spoke it that's there to vindicate it manifest it and bring it to pass then you have where Moses is not resting upon letters and upon words but he's resting in the very person of the Lord God and to see how that God would move on the scene and Moses invites him in at this time let's go on and look at this in verse 12 he said certainly I will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee when thou has brought forth the people out of Egypt you shall serve God upon this mountain and Moses said unto God behold when I come unto the children of Israel and I saying to them the god of your fathers have sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall I say unto them how does Moses know this because believers want to know his name believers want to know his name because his name is who he is it's a characteristic it's the very manifestation of the same God and so here it is Moses what's this here is Moses under living right here in the presence of God he's standing all right O's about at the instant moot that's right Moses himself standing in the presence of God he's standing in a place where God is making himself known as the Living God this is not something that Moses is going to have to rely back on his mama or somebody else but he is meeting God personally and that's God's Way that's God's order it's still the same right here tonight in every generation God meets you and me personally so when we see it how that God has moved in this manner Moses as the presence of God moving upon Moses life Moses asks what shall I tell them thy name is now you know watch how God goes on to say this and God said unto Moses I am that I am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel I am hath sent me unto you and God said moreover unto Moses thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel the Lord God of your father's the God of Abraham the god of Isaac and the God of Jacob hath sent me unto you and this is my name forever and this is my memorial unto all generations he was always the I am he is still the I am tonight he's not the I was it's nothing I will be he is the I am the I am is he that was it's he that is and he that shall come Dory back same table that knows where you're at tonight he knows where you been and he knows what your destiny is that is the Living God the manifestation of God's name so ma what's what he says and he'll go and gather the elders of Israel together and say unto them the Lord God of your father's the God of Abraham of Isaac and of Jacob appeared unto me saying I surely visited you and seen one is done for you seen what has done to you and Egypt and I have said I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites Hittites amirite parasites Hivites and Jebusites onto a land flowing with milk and honey and they shall hearken to thy voice thou shalt come now and the elders of Israel under the king of Egypt and ye shall say unto Him the Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us and now let us go we beseech thee three days journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God and I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go no not by a mighty hand are you with me God has given him the word he said you shall unite there Israel together you and the elders and go stand in the presence of Pharaoh and tell him let us go we want to go three days journey and God turns turns around and he lets Moses know you will not be let go no not by a mighty hand it could have been a mighty army that could have been Moses could have been heading a mighty army men that were ever so trained but he wasn't heading a my team our army Moses himself was only serving in the great army of God and this situation he's letting Moses know and the people that this situation by Pharaoh saying you can't leave here you can't get over that you can't be free of this God is letting it be no this is an opportunity for me to manifest my glory to my people in the midst of Egypt oma and I will stretch out my hand that's the mighty hand right there and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof and after that he will let you go so you see signs and wonders and miracles are necessary it's a way that God has of making himself known that he is the Living God because if it's just the word and the word is here and it's not manifest you could doubt that but when the God whom gave this word is made manifest then it's no longer word it's become light and then you have faith in the God who gave the word that's what matters friends it isn't that you understand every word and that's it's important that you recognize his presence and that it is he that is speaking unto you and that you obey from your heart what he is saying dude oh ma what's how Moses goes on here Moses himself you know you see the Spirit of Christ moving within Moses life Moses has never said at this point oh that's enough that's enough we won't need that Lord we won't need miracles signs and wonders because your people they know the quotes I mean they know the paragraphs they know chapters Lord they've memorized them in Sunday school they can quote them that ain't what they needed that ain't what they needed they didn't need memorization they knew the promise what they needed was the God who made the promise to step in to the promise and the promise become flesh now watch this this is where here Moses is asking and Moses answered and said unto Him but behold they will not believe me nor Horkan know hearken unto my voice for they will say the LORD hath not appeared unto thee and the Lord said unto him what is that in thine hand he said a rod he can he said cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and Moses fled from before it here was a Rob that he had been getting back been caring he had been hurting sheep on the backside of the desert but notice here Moses himself is seeing this bush that is on fire and yet it's not consumed now the same God the voice has spoke out of that bush and it has called him by name it's called him into a place of humility it's called him into a place that he recognizes that I alone am not able to do this it's called him to a place that he would ask that God would manifest his name it's called to a place that he would actually ask God Lord that there be signs that would back up what I'm saying and that the Lord hath appeared unto me do you realize that the people of God would have had a right to question if there have been no signs are you with me better had the right to question who are you o the Lord's appeared unto you what if the Lord's appeared unto you and made himself known unto you then we ought to be able to see him come on friends if he's alive and well we ought to be able to see him you see people are not wanting just a Bible people are not warning just a quote book they are not warning just quotes and tapes they want to see the Living God on display glory be to God and this is what Moses was asking for I ask you who was this that was asking for this it was that predestinated ordained elected part that seed that was down on the inside that was longing like David said that deep call it to the deep at the noise of that water spot Oh David said I long to see God manifest himself as he has in the sanctuary I long to see that Living God on display you see that's the hearts of the believers I want to see him who you see that rod notice that rod itself before Moses could ever see miracles he had to obey he asked him to look at what do you got in your hand Lord this is just some rod this is just a rod he said cast it down you see God's not interested in you supplying something but God will take what you already have if it's just submitted to him the glory of God can move in and it will raise something that is dead to life could it be the God it will be something that is living that you can put your hand on it'll be something that is alive that then becomes a judgment rock of God in your hand you realize what this is it is the deity of Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ the deity is the life it's the characteristic it's the real manifestation that backs up that this indeed is the Lord Jesus Christ because it's the same life the same works the same signs who and the Lord said unto Moses put forth thine hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and it became a rod in and that what that they may believe I thought they are believers they are but you see believers want to see God believers love to see God once it's just not enough for him they love God they love to see him and by the way if you and I are a part of him as Moses was and as the covenant children were a part of him what's going to bring that God part out of your life it'll take the Living God it takes a living God coming on the scene to bring out that part that he's already sown in our life come on now that they may believe that the Lord God of our fathers the God of Abraham the god of Isaac the God of Jacob hath appeared unto thee now I hope you listen now God is not in any way interjecting here and saying wow they just sort of believe the word come on somebody they don't need signs and wonders no more they just thought to believe the word nope mister opportunities for God to make himself known that he's still the same come on friends we don't want DNA reports from paper we want that same manifestation of the same DNA in this world to make himself real and alive in our midst Oh glory be to God watch this and the Lord said furthermore unto him putting out on hand into my bosom he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was leprous as snow he put his hand into the bosom again and he put it he put it in there again and plucked it out of his bosom and behold it was turned again as his other flesh glory see the heart of man the conscience of man sinned but how that God would come on the scene and God Himself moving on the scene who an actual bring about a change in a person's life you see this is a great miracle glory be to God and it came to pass if they will not believe thee neither hearken to the voice of the first sign but they will believe the voice of the latter sign and it shall come to pass if they will not believe also these two signs neither harken unto thy voice well it didn't say write them off it said that thou shall take of the water of the river and poured upon the dry land and the water which they'll take us out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land now I'm gonna tell you it really don't matter if you was a believer in the first pool or you became a believer at the manifestation of the second pool the pools themselves work together come on somebody or a believer under the third pool you are not a believer under the third pool and reject the first and second cuz the first and second is still in manifestation glory be to God notices here God's interested in getting his people to believe this is God's interest and notice there is a voice there is a message but remember in order to get the people's attention God just does not send a message but God Himself comes down and he manifests himself by signs miracles and wonders now listen to me channy's and jam berries were right there they could produce some of the same miracles some of the same signs some of the same wonders but the difference with Janice and cameras and Moses they did not have the power to take away those plagues that were brought let me tell you something all the miracles and everything it can be reproduced but let me tell you something the voice of God standing there and signs and wonders are done what does that voice do it points you and I to the promise of God it does not leave us in a comfort zone of and unbelief but it points us to the living promise of the Living God it doesn't leave us in bondage it doesn't leave us in Egypt it just doesn't get us to the wilderness it packs us all the way across the Jordan I love this brother diamond said he here when God Moses had said Lord show me your glory and then put this one up there he said show me your glory and I'll go hi brother BAM says I like to see a little that's the kind of glory don't you always says show me your glory Lord now what is your glory Lord Moses had the stick in his hand hand into the bosom pulled it out leprosy puts it back and it's changed now notice blue grama says he's seen God's glory what is God's glory then miracles signs wonders and divine healing show me your glory Lord glory when he was ready to deliver his people Oh Baha here came Moses and the Holy Ghost showing signs wonders and divine healing there in the midst of Egypt - God's covenant people listen to me those signs and wonders one for Egypt those signs and wonders were for God's covenant people they would have to believe let me tell you something think about it over and over how many times you heard the Prophet saying will this help you to believe you know God is interested in helping you to believe when you look at yourself and say I don't feel like I've got enough faith you cast that thought out right now because you might have just a little bit of faith but right here in this building tonight there are believers whose faith might be a little greater and we're sitting here United as a body of believers tonight and the faith of God can begin to move right through this assembly and a charge of God can move as you're entertaining the promises of God in your life you can walk out of here not a divine miracle of God you can walk out of here tonight a sign in a wonder of God's manifestation by his healing power by its delivering power tonight you can walk out of here that same way oh my you say how do you know that because I am a witness of it you can't preach nothing you're not a witness of you can't tell nobody you're not a witness something you're not a witness of you yourself must be a partaker first but if somebody's already been there I've been there I was once a sinner I was once lost but I've been found a God who called me a God who cleanse me Saint to find me and filled me with the Holy Ghost and placed me here in the land I'm telling you it was not by my works it was not by my effort it was by the choosing of God and God came down and began to manifest himself to me and let me know it's more than quotes boy it's more than just reciting verses boy you've got to know me in a personal way you've got to know the God who can deliver you from sin but God who can claims you have ever filthy habit that God who can set your feet in the land of promise I'll tell you what the Lord this lesson this last verse I read God will do anything he'll do everything to help his people believe I wonder how many times we need to read a row people off because they didn't believe well I talked to them maybe that's all you did was talk to him maybe you should have kept your mouth silent and just lived a life a little more come on somebody it's always better to live a sermon than preach one it's better to show them a life that has actually been changed it's better to be a miracle that they themselves can witness and see you know a miracle you can't explain a miracle a miracle is a phenomenal a super natural happening a paradox if you can explain your new birth I doubt it I said if you can explain your new birth I doubt it our prayer let me just to challenge us and put this down among us as an assembly our prayer should be for the Lord God to make himself so real among us I just read to you a statement right here where the Prophet said I like to see his glory don't you oh ma it ought to be to where when those doors when people walk in those doors conviction sets in by the presence of God and ain't going to happen by just looseness it ain't gonna happen in a happenstance it isn't gonna happen would say what if their intellect of God it'll happen no there's got to be some people who are intentional some people who's met God face-to-face some people who love to seek God show up who loves to see God save souls change souls fill them with the Holy Ghost it's gotta be people who love to see his healing power it's gotta be people who long when they come to the house of God they're not interested if a quote is finished right or if this verse is finished just right they're interested in the Lord God showing up and making himself real because your faith is not to stand in the in passing words of man's wisdom your faith is to be established in the power of God that ought to be his presence upon our hearts such conviction when people would walk through these doors I wonder when they walk through those doors do they hear a lot of nonsense in that vestibule do they hear a lot of political trash do they hear a lot of mumbo-jumbo that ought not be going on out there I'm telling you you set out there and you talk and everything else you are not ready for the house of God you are not ready for the promises of God y'all gonna get quiet on me you get quiet on me I'm gonna preach harder it's absolutely the truth my question is why are we coming to the house of God are we coming to see one another or are we coming to have a meeting with God do we God to show up or is it just about I'm here Lord I want him to show up I want the Living God to come on the scene take some preparation for a person to say we believe the message we don't need signs and wonders you're a make believer you're an unbeliever because you don't believe he's still performed signs and wonders I don't think you know this same God if you don't think that's necessary what about your children what about Souls and lives that are here that don't know him they might hear the message but friends they people need to meet the Living God face to face my children they hear the voice of a prophet they hear it talked about we talk of these things with them but I cannot be very experienced for them they've gotta meet that same Living God on the same sacred sands that changes their life and kills that old nature and raise this up a real son of God on the inside oh we don't need signs and wonders anymore you unbeliever we need signs and wonders because everywhere chief is there is signs and wonders don't you dare be a wait wet blanket we need God we need the Living God right here one let me read to you what the Prophet said in perfect faith he says oh my faith is based on forgiveness as we said in the morning trying to get the church into the place to where we could really see apostolic times moving among us that's what we all hunger and it's just laying right at the door we see it but we want to see more of it we wanted such a flow that it'll be a help to us us flow out to others Oh Lord this means it's not about me it's about him and his body it's about him making himself no it's about being in love with him and wanting to see him show up brother M says remember Jesus he never used his power for himself he used it for others that's what it was sent for so you see when you don't pray you're living for yourself when you don't submit yourself to God you're living for yourself Oh everything I've got such a busy week that's about you but what about a sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ maybe there's a need right here that would come into service by the Samuels Thursday not you see a different God on Thursday night it's the power any less on Thursday night I don't think so I said it just as much for Thursday nights as I do for Sunday's now in that study of time how much time is it given oh I don't know hours weeks and things that can go all together for a preparation for one service I do not make a difference when it's a Thursday night or a Sunday night because you know what he doesn't make a difference so my expectation it's no different if it's Thursday night or it's Sunday night if it's important for me to be in the house of God on Sunday it's important to me to be in the house of God on Thursday glory be to God think about Elijah on Mount Carmel how did it turn the people's hearts was a just word or was it the Living God who gave a Living Word and came down and vindicated it and turned the people's hearts see it was God making himself known what about Rahab here she is in a land a land in a heathen country heathen nations right there dwelling in that city but she heard his fame she heard about the Living God now I want you to notice what she said she said we know that God Himself he of heaven is also God in earth she said well we have heard what I have heard right here is that it's just not something of word only but I have heard that God is among human I have heard that God has swift Kings he has overthrown battles he has opened obstacles and opposition's along the way that's what I have heard about him you know what she was hearing she was hearing the name of the Living cloth the I am and arose something up within her to say I want to know that I am Jesus himself standing here he said if I do not the works of my father believe me not but if I do though you believe me not believe the works that you may know and believe that the father is in me and I in him he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my father John 6 57 as the living father has sent me and I lived by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me in John 20:21 jesus now at the resurrection he says peace be unto you to the disciples as my father hath sent me even so send I you the father who sent him went in him this ought to be the desire now I'm gonna tell you right now he don't do good it's not enough just to have the tapes and the books and your home and the Bible you need to live in God well I believe that God I believe the Living God was manifest in the prophets ministry that was only a type of the Living God wanting to manifest himself in your life don't you dare put God back there as an idol it's a living God hey man our young people and people have become here to this assembly they don't need words they need to meet the Living God face to face we tell you something friends people can be so schooled within this message they can debate it that can tell you all the doctrines but they don't know one thing about living God they know about the doctrines can talk about him can set things all right but yet they don't know him in a personal way it's not something to wear the love of God has actually moved into their life where they're living by the presence of God notice here in the scriptures this is God's Way you know he dude God does something he don't ever stop the Bible says in mark 16 verse 19 after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God here's the Ascension after his resurrection here's his ascension now he's been received he's ascended up on high and he sins back the promise of the Father and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following acts 4:32 and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul that's a key ingredient in him neither said they any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things in common and with great power gave the Apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all there was no printed Bible at this time the Gospels were not printed they did not hand tracts out to him come on somebody they don't need tracts they need to live in God come on friends Jesus never said go and pass out tracts he said go and preach the gospel now I know that Devils tried to replace that it's not just handing out Bibles go and preach the gospel there's got to be living witnesses that know about the power of God how can they hear how can they know if they haven't heard how can they hear except there be a preacher and how can there be a preacher unless he's sent Omaha you see they were following the same pattern because the pattern giver was on the inside of them Acts chapter one here the Bible says thy former treatise have I made Oh falafel Asst of all that Jesus began both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the Holy Ghost had given Commandments unto the Apostles whom he had chosen to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs I'm asking you was that necessary it sure was he picked up a gloomy church on the road these are people that he had called out people that had walked away from the tax collection and everything else about their life but when things were not happening and going the way that they had it figured out they got all gloomy because it looked like here in jail we we thought this was it we thought this was the perfect Oasis we thought this was just right you know what it was it was their thinking was nothing wrong with the word was nothing wrong with God it was with their thinking but God is faithful because remember God can only prove his word by believers and remember it takes the Living God coming on the scene to cause faith to rise now remember here not only you say they need the Holy Ghost but before that they can receive the Holy Ghost and go and wait for it they've got to recognize that there let the redemption has come that there has been a ransom that has been paid and there it can be a release of that life that redemptive work of the Holy Ghost back down into the earth they've got to believe this they've got to believe it so you know what he does he takes forty days yeah he instructs him but he shows many infallible proofs the same things he did already now why didn't he if they were believers why didn't he say not you already see me do it you can't believe me yeah you're not a believer it's funny how the devil likes to supply quotes and scriptures you say because when you go talking about signs and wonders that old slick tongue devil will try to sneak up on a scripture a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign your misplace in the word devil that is a misplaced scripture they seek for a sign they're seeking for proof shows proof shows proof shows proof but the reality is they are not believers signs and wonders follow then that believe and when God makes himself known to believers it gets their attention God didn't send this message without signs and wonders if it came without signs and wonders that ain't God's message then you might have a right to call it a man's message but this ain't a man's message this is God's message come on somebody this message belongs to us this message was not just something that was said that we gather around and we pay homage to we're up paying homage to letters we are prostrating ourselves before the Living God and that living caught projecting his life inside of us and we are living images of the Living God he showed himself alive by identifying himself by the same things he did before you know sometimes you wonder why things happen in your home huh why does sickness come why does this come opportunities for God to make himself known you see what it is a testimony is not something that can be given you can't download it it's not on the App Store a testimony itself is personally between you God God drawing you personally to him he draws you to the water Samara he draws you to every step along the way what's he doing he's bringing you to himself and he and being assembled together with them verse four he commanded them to wait for the promise of the father which you've heard of me for John truly baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days since notice the voice behind these signs it was not a voice of you're all right it was a voice of said you need to get the Holy Ghost you need to be baptized with the Holy Ghost you need to be born again you see what this voice was when Moses went down to Egypt he did not come down there just saying oh you're the Blessed covenant people oh you're a wonderful covenant people you're predestinated and elected but he came down there with a message that would call them out and to bring them into their homeland notice Peter I a raise us up here you men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also know let me move on here let me move down the Bible goes on to say in verse 42 of Acts 2 they continued steadfastly in the Apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers and fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles now I want you to notice this not everybody was an apostle but you know what there were some who were praying for the apostles there were some who were fasting and praying for the Apostles because you know why they were part of the body it wasn't about what I got to be the one to lay my hands on them blessed God it's got to be my way no it wasn't about their well you see what they had so lost so lost sight of themselves it was about the advancement of the body so if their duty wants to pray remember like brother Ram talks to sister she carrion but grandma prayed I fasted brother BAM I still can't cast out Devils he said sis that was not for you to do that's he said your part is to pray and fast for those that God has set in the body to do it all glory be to God I'll tell your friends God's got a place and a part for each and every one in the body I don't care if my part is just to pray if my part is just to pray and stand behind it God let me do my part Lord God this is what was manifest when nobody mattered about anybody else huh glory be to God Omaha notice here let me go home in the Sardis in church age you all right notice he says the confirming of the Pentecostal church that's the confirming mark 16 God confirms himself alive as a miracle working God in the church speaking in tongues still believe that you may not speak in them here but you might be coming to prayer closet come on friends I still believe in the manifestation right here in this assembly I believe that God is still God I believe in it when I'm in my prayer closet ooh yes sir speaking in tongues interpreting of tongues and doing the same things they did at the beginning now you watch this you watch how the devil get all tightened up oh he's trying to take us back to all sorts of Pentecostalism no I'm not I'm preaching what the word says I'm preaching what the word says now if you don't want none of this inheritance you can stay on the other side of Jordan but these promises belong to me and God is still God I'll quote the same words to the Prophet he said I can show you where God put it in the church you show me where he took it out of the church but you see there's been a lot of editing from the Bible to where the people no longer know the Bible oh they know it's quotes but let me tell you something if the quotes don't put you back into the word to where your Bible is becoming alive to you and where will you read every verse of the Bible you can see Jesus Christ you might want to check up on what you're doing my brother and sister because the real reality of this message it will make this Bible become a life to you you see what the problem is a lot of times people are quoting quotes but they ain't lining it up with the word and they got their own ideas about what brother Branham says you said Moses anyhow you know it's an idea watch how it binds them up you know either bind them up or loosen them let me tell you something if your own ideas if it's your own idea it'll bind you up like an old pot apple it don't make you so sour it'll make you cantankerous it'll make you to where you can't get along with nobody but when it's God's thoughts behind it brother you recognize the mercy and the power and the glory and the grace of God you've got a feeling for somebody else that may not see it like you see it but the glory of God has moved down in your life a good litmus test is ask somebody what you got do they want it not us the message of the hour really you might have it but does it have you does the God whose Senate have you that's my question you know friends there's a lot of things so that a lot of preachers that cannot quote me they can go out all that country there okay the thing that I'm interested in is knowing God in a personal way and that living God's showing up and changing lives let me tell you something a person I know all the doctrines be able to put in lace everything all together and be as dead as a doornail because it takes a living clot to come on the scene and make that word alive and real God does not want just a bunch of people who are knowledge and puffed up with pride but God wants to make himself known in power and humility to wear hearts themselves are humbled in his presence who acts 8 for let's look at this this same pattern therefore they were scattered abroad and when everywhere preaching the word then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ unto them and the people with one Accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake hearing and seeing the miracles which he did he's still the same God tonight it's been witnessed right here in this assembly it's been witnessed in other places he's still the same God let me tell you something there's times that God shows up and God has healed many people and people will consent right here and say I wonder where gods at gods are right here there's testimonies all the way around this assembly come on somebody you know what it is your eyes are looking for him in your own way but if you can just say lord help me humble my heart don't let me put on these things that you got to come in a certain way but lord I want you to make yourself known I'm a believer you know how to get my attention you know how to raise my faith the Lord God will you just make yourself known and you watch him come on the scene he's done it by way of his word as well the same Holy Spirit coming and the word being delivered let me tell you something if it was just a Ministry of word only of reap reaching this and preaching this and there was no effect of the power God and signs and wonders being done you'd have a right to question but there is signs and wonders that are being done let me tell you something if in your home you're not a sign and Wonder and there are not signs and wonders and miracles in your home your your children got a right to question you come on somebody hoping to Samuel that's time let me tell you something they need to see the Living God need to see him in action well I'll bring him to a meeting I'll get him to a youth meeting I'll get them to a camp I'll get them to church how about you bring God on the scene how about you be Jesus to them how about you be the one that stirs up their heart how about you be the one to wear their hardest touch to prostrate before his presence well I'll tell him a Bible story how about tucking away mama how about tucking away daddy how about praying into the power of God falls in that home this is they gave heed because they heard and seen the miracles which were done for unclean spirits crying with loud voice came out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with palsies and that word lame were healed and there was great joy in that city now watch this here's a man by the name of Simon in the same city he had used sorcery and bewitched the people of Samaria given out that himself with some great one that's a sorcerer elevate himself when you feel like as though that you have everything that's a spirit of sorcery cast that thing down to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power of God and to him they had regard because that of a long time he had bewitched them with sorcerers you think Satan in real didn't say this man just had words he bewitched them with sorcery demonic spirits you understand the holy ghost travels by the word demons travel by words that's why you got to be careful what you say you got to be careful once you're around that's why the Prophet would tell us over and over after you're prayed for don't you go out there and associate with unbelievers you associated with people who believe in God like you - why would I want to be prayed for and gonna get around a bunch of people who's doubters that don't even know the power of God I want to be in fellowship with people who know that God is called people who are there to encourage me people who are there to lift up the name of Jesus these demon powers were at work but I love this when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and women what happened chains fell off they'd seen they'd seen not just heard they seen miracles they'd seen people who were bound that could not be free there was no power no mighty hand no psychologist no doctor that could do anything for him and they witnessed people who were bound with the policy had the shakes they witnessed the power of God move on the scene and set them free they witnessed the healing power of God what if they were believers when Philip preached they to just come ah that slit tongue devil trying to take away the deity of Jesus Christ he's still the same God amen let me remind you as those that walked in that little room there in the third pool when they walked into that little room let me remind you the pillar fire that was with the Prophet he said left me and went to that room God goes to is word the word has been delivered and the pillar of fire is with the word hello somebody and as they walked into that little room bound on crutches coming in on quartz they come out the other side perfectly healed what is that it speaks of that perfect healing of the soul it speaks that God is still God he still heals those of infirmities he still cast out devils he still heals those that are sick he's still the same God tonight and Simon himself believed also wow this guy who had been preaching a demonic message sorcery he was baptized and continued with Philip got dealt with even the ringleader and wondered beholding the miracles and signs which are done the miracles and the signs shut Satan up all the brother Samuel they had not been filled with the Holy Ghost yet you cut this out there had never been no filling of the Holy Ghost this was needed to raise their faith to know that there was a living God hope of the saying I want my children to be filled with the Holy Ghost do they know what it's all about can they look at your life and know what it's all about come on somebody preach with me brother Samuel preach with me can they look at your life and know what it's all about that's what matters that's what counts it's that they would know that same God and they said I want to know that same God but daddy knows I want to know the same God that mama knows if you're down and out in the moly grabs you have a right to be happy shame on you you have nothing to be down about as a son and daughter of God you have everything in the world to look forward to to think about what he's done and what he's bringing to you come on friends many times if people can look they listen to our complaining and no doubt maybe you don't do it on the job maybe you don't do it here but you're doing your home you think your children on anything to do and all you do is complain that ain't nothing about the living dog they don't want nothing to do with that whatsoever they don't want nothing to do with just somebody who can be happy and somebody just say ho glory to God they want to see the power of God that's moving and living behind your life it ain't enough that the pastor has it it's you've got to have it you've got to let it be manifest in your life maybe you've left things in your life take it out of you maybe you've let your job maybe you've let Satan get up on you and say well we really don't need that we just believe the word but there's something that rises up only inside of you and says that's right I'm a believer and signs and wonders follow them that believe I believe in that Lord God I want to invite you Lord God has an unseen guest to work in unexpected ways unexpected times can I go on good watch this acts 13 here they were Barnabas Simon those of Niger Simon that was called Niger Lucius of Cyrene my name which had brought up with Herod the Tetrarch and Saul as they ministered to the Lord and fasted the Holy Ghost said you see God still talks and people of God still believe in fasting I believe in fasting don't you ha ha brother Samuel the bridegroom has come or we don't have to fast anymore another misplaced scripture seyton robbing you of what God has given you the bridegroom not only had already come the bridegroom was in them and they were fasting you know how they were fasting they were fasting and setting themselves aside for him that's how serious they were about serving God oh and here he said separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work I've called him and when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on him they sent him away so they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost so you mean it wasn't those brothers who sent him forth no was the Holy Ghost they were instruments then recognized the leading of the Holy Ghost and just extended their hands and prayed and showing we're standing with what God has already shown is that right now notice this here and they were there at Salamis they preached the Word of God in the synagogue's of the Jews and they also had John - their minister and when they had gone through the Isle of pathos they found a certain sorcery a false prophet oh so sorcerers are false prophets hello somebody sorcerers are false prophets a Jew whose name was Bar Jesus to Betty 1 identified with Jesus which was with the deputy of the country Sergius Paulus a prudent man who called for Barnabas and Saul and desired to hear the word of God but in limas the sorcerer for so is his name high interpretations withstood them seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith don't you see what Satan was trying to do he was trying to get between the deputy and Paul and Barnabas who were packing the Word of Life he wanted to get between him now watch what happened and saw filled with the Holy Ghost he set his eyes on him he was discernment he realized this hindrance this opposition ain't nothing but the devil come on friends as children of God I believe that we need to have discernment we need to recognize if there are things that's coming between us and God we need to call it for what it is we need to talk stop making excuses we need to stop around the devil just to shove everything in our pathway we need to come back to recognizing that we got one purpose there ought to be one motive and one objective while we're here in this life and that's to serve the Living God and that he would be glorified in our lives filled with the Holy Ghost he set his eyes on him he said o fool of sucked ility and all mischief thou child of the devil who he didn't play did he thou enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord and now behold the hand of the Lord is upon thee and thou shalt be blind not seeing the Sun for a season and immediately there fell on him amidst a darkness and he went about seeking Sun to lead him by the hand been the deputy when he saw what was done believed being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord do you realize what he saw he saw the doctrine of the Lord he believed one opened him what he saw God do God knows how to get to people this guy thought he had it shut off not know anyone shut off from God reaching it said to me reading the next one let me just refer to him here you find Paul walking through the city there is a woman who's bound with an evil spirit matter of fact she's possessed they've used her in divination what Devil's speaking through her and here she is watch this The Devil's recognized who Paul and Barnabas were they walked around saying these men teach us the way of salvation those Devils look at this Paul and Barnabas had not even said anything to him but the very presence and dedication glory of their walk before God it caused even the devil's to testify of who they were and who they represented Oh friends it ought to be when we walk in the workplace when we walk in the grocery store were out among our family and other places it ought to be that demons tremble that demons know the reputation that is behind the life that's being lived not handing quotes to the devil but you're the manifestation of the quote hello notice what he said I command thee here she was many days with him and Paul looked around and said to the spirit I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her and he came out the same hour notice the key words the same hour maybe not the same minute maybe it was 1520 but the word had been spoken Satan had already been assured the power of God had been manifest to take authority over that devil and in the same hour she was dead have heard now you think Omaha the whole city is going to say wow but no they threw him in jail but it's right where God wanted him lord have mercy we just came through one sickness and not right where God wanted them and now here they are in jail but you see what it is there's a jailer down there that belongs to God and that jailer would not know about this unless Paul and Silas were down there and even though Paul and Silas were in the jail no doubt when they came in there or what are you in here for what did checking in for how these are sedition these are guys you know rebel rousers and everything else you know just put them away in the cell down there you know we're gonna we've already agreed we're gonna you know we've already whipped him and things like that just just put him on down there okay he wrote it on down he had already seen a lot of guys that were nuts come on people who were rebel rousers but little did he know God had them there for him and God was going to do something so special for him and his household and that he would have an effect on the rest of that city God shook the very foundations of that prison Paul and Silas begin to testify and to praise God and the Bible says that there came up and earthquake let me ask you something who else do you know that can bring about an earthquake and can control walls and control situations where there wasn't no lives lost but where everybody in there that had shackles on them their shackles was broke away let me tell you something there's only one person that can do that and that's the Living God coming on the scene oh my that same God can move rock for here tonight he can break down walls he can loosen shackles he can remove bars and doors where you've been walled in that Saint God can move a ride right where you're sitting why would he do that to raise your faith that's why I do it lord have mercy on and on we could go the Bible says in another place in acts 19 Paul laboured one we're in one place for two years teaching the Word of God and the Bible says special miracles were wrought by his hands why so that the people might believe believe in who believe in God believe hogan-sama but by believing itself that's not enough but it is a necessary start how can you seek after something that you don't know to be real the only way you can see can look and you yield and desire the Holy Ghost you got to know that God is real and you got to know that he means you you got to know that you're included you say how do I know that by the Lord God moving and dealing with your heart speaking to your heart things that you know that men do not know but you know it's a living God discerning your heart calling out thoughts that you've had calling out these things what is that that ain't God trying to embarrass you he's letting you know that he knows your cries that you've cried what you prayed about what you've longed for you realize what that is that's opportunities for him to show up on and on we could go through the scriptures here of even where they came into such a place where there were men who took it upon themselves as Exorcist to call on the name of Jesus and they wanted to call upon the name of Jesus but them demon spirit said I know Paul and I know Jesus but who are you and when that was done remember the evil spirits that was on the demon possessed man it jumped upon them they went out of the house naked but remember there that here the Bible says that the name of the Lord Jesus Christ was magnified before the people and the Word of God prevailed and grew mightily God is still God God started this Exodus with signs wonders and miracles and he still signs wonders miracles I believe I'm talking to people tonight that know him I believe I'm talking to people tonight that have that same burning and yearning in my heart to see more of him to see more of him have a hunger in our hearts Lord I want to see more of you I want to see him I believe this right now tonight that the word that God has given to be spoken here tonight you know there was something else that I had already had studied out for tonight and the Spirit of God turned things right around today and pushed everything back and brought this right out here today I'm telling you God as a longtime God he did not do this today just for me to give you a message not for me just to read scriptures but God is interested in confirming his word with signs and wonders following you got a need in your life tonight he's here you can receive what you have need of tonight if you feel that you don't got enough faith I'll say hi I don't feel like I got enough faith to receive it don't you even entertain that thought you lay that down and you say I'm here with believers I am here in the presence of God I am here we're believers are gathered he said wherever two or three good Lord there's more than two or three here tonight it only takes two or three that are gathered together in his name in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established it only takes some believers to get together as a matter of fact it only takes you to believe and God will step on the scene you might say my problem is so big my situation is so big the doctors have wrote this off brother Samuel I've prayed and I've sought for the Holy Ghost first of all let me tell you every promise of God is yay hey man if you suck for the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is for you who could give you that longing unless caught put it in you that would desire that law our Holy Ghost how could you want it the evening of your body there's a need there's a calling there's a healer there's a God who delivers there's a God who sets free anybody believe in me tonight anybody believe he's still the same God how many understand with me tonight how many stand tonight and say I believe that I'm a believer I'm a believer tonight that he's still the same God I believe that he's still the same God and I got a need in my life tonight Lord God I want you to make yourself real to me lord over the Senate he's already made himself real to me but do you want to make him more real to you you know how I love to see your glory I love to see your glory over saying I've been prayed for I've went through prayer lines I've done this and I've done that but let me ask you something isn't he worth one more time you're out here in this hour and this time has the Lord God showing up you let him come by this time and say Lord I don't care I don't care about my feelings I cast down my thoughts I doubt my doubts and Lord God I believe your word let me tell you something if you can just say to the Lord tonight lord help my unbelief Lord God help me Lord help my faith to rise to that level why don't you ask him tonight that God let my faith rise to the level that you can come down and meet my
