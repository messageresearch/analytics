[26:56] in a special way so good to see each and
[26:58] every one of you amen we just love you
[27:00] and it's just a special time that God
[27:03] affords us to be able to come together
[27:04] to you like this
[27:07] you know a lot of times if sometimes I
[27:10] find terms that the young people they it
[27:13] catches hold with them
[27:15] you know
[27:16] God is just such a personal God
[27:19] and it's just as personal
[27:22] even more so than the ringtone on your
[27:25] phone
[27:27] you've got ringtones for text you've got
[27:29] ringtones for calls and sometimes even
[27:32] as special ones depending on who it is
[27:34] it's calling you
[27:35] now some of you are looking before but
[27:37] young people know what I'm talking about
[27:39] but you see God is just that personal
[27:42] and he's just that personal that as you
[27:45] would just respond to what he has and
[27:47] what he's saying to you
[27:49] when Isaiah came in the temple that day
[27:51] he recognized he was in the presence of
[27:53] God
[27:54] and all and the greatest thing he could
[27:55] do is say here I am
[27:59] and God came and began to minister to
[28:02] the need that was in Isaiah's life
[28:04] and we all have needs here tonight right
[28:07] I believe we're all here with that
[28:09] purpose and I believe God's desire is to
[28:11] speak to us he's here to do for you
[28:13] tonight just welcome him just invite him
[28:15] right to your Pew most importantly just
[28:17] invite him right to your heart and say
[28:19] Lord just move through every area of my
[28:21] life take the light of the word and just
[28:24] move through every area of my life I'm
[28:26] sure that every one of us could say if
[28:28] there's something in my life Lord
[28:30] that's hindering I want it out of the
[28:33] way
[28:34] because I want a Clear Channel that the
[28:37] Holy Spirit can move through and operate
[28:39] and move in my life in a deeper way
[28:41] let's just invite him that way
[28:44] just let him come in a personal way he's
[28:46] here to do for us tonight
[28:48] so as we just
[28:50] turn the service over let's sing that
[28:52] again
[28:53] I want to live the way he wants me to
[28:55] live

[30:10] to be in the house of the Lord tonight
[30:12] and uh it's an honor to be among you
[30:14] again and I really have appreciated the
[30:17] um the time uh that I've spent here it's
[30:21] been a real blessing Brother Sam Sister
[30:23] Kim been so accommodating and uh
[30:26] receptive you know like uh hospitable
[30:29] and and it's just been a blessing I've
[30:32] gained about 10 pounds and uh
[30:35] I mean it's just uh it's just been
[30:38] wonderful just the fellowship and and
[30:40] the time together so uh we go we leave
[30:43] with with good memories just uh honored
[30:45] to have my wife with me on this trip and
[30:47] and uh good to see old friends and faces
[30:51] here that we've known for a number of
[30:52] years so uh we just trust that something
[30:54] that said tonight now uh would be a
[30:57] blessing and I I will tell you this that
[30:59] uh through the week I was just kind of
[31:01] wrestling about this service tonight I
[31:04] wasn't wrestling about any of the others
[31:05] but I was just wrestling about this
[31:06] service tonight and uh we were we had
[31:10] lunch today and and I I was thinking
[31:13] about the service again and then we went
[31:14] to the best ice cream place
[31:18] in North America
[31:21] and we're just sitting there and Sister
[31:22] Kim was sharing a little bit of a
[31:24] testimony and uh it was it was almost
[31:27] like and I I don't have uh many
[31:30] experiences like this but it was just
[31:31] like the Holy Spirit just registered
[31:33] something in my heart and said that's it
[31:35] and so I just I just felt uh this is the
[31:39] direction that he would have us to go
[31:40] tonight
[31:41] so if you don't mind while you're
[31:43] standing let's take your Bibles and get
[31:44] let's go to Romans

[32:01] and uh
[32:06] let's see if we can get this up here
[32:10] yeah okay good
[32:12] so we're going to title this tonight
[32:14] feeling all alone
[32:17] feeling all alone
[32:20] Romans chapter 8 and hold your Bible
[32:22] because we're going to come back to this
[32:24] a little bit later on Paul writes
[32:27] and we know
[32:28] we know
[32:30] all things work together for good to
[32:33] them that love God
[32:34] to them who are the called according to
[32:37] his purpose
[32:39] Heavenly Father we ask your blessing now

[32:43] can read it we can talk about it we can
[32:46] Minister it but Lord only you can

[32:59] complete control Lord take my spirit in
[33:01] every Spirit under your control for the

[33:28] well it's great to see the young people
[33:29] coming out here I gotta ask how many of
[33:33] you are here from Pennsylvania let's see
[33:36] your hands look at that
[33:38] someone said brother Matt Leitner was in
[33:40] the building is Matt here
[33:42] he's here somewhere
[33:44] is he he will be all right
[33:48] I hadn't seen brother Mann for a long
[33:50] time great to have brother and Nathaniel
[33:52] here and uh just each and every one and
[33:55] uh may the Lord help us well let's just
[33:57] jump right in is that all right and uh
[33:59] we uh just want to talk a little bit
[34:01] about the age we live in and some of the
[34:03] corresponding pressures that uh that
[34:05] exist in our time here and I did a
[34:08] little series at home uh called living
[34:12] above your cares and I was really
[34:16] um I had actually ministered on that
[34:17] subject many many years ago and then I I
[34:20] came back to it again a little while ago
[34:23] and you know with with a little bit more
[34:25] I guess a little bit more experience a
[34:27] little bit more perspective and uh I was
[34:30] just amazed at how timely that was not
[34:33] only for the people in my own assembly
[34:34] but for the people uh around many people
[34:37] around who uh were were thankful for the
[34:41] Insight that was was given through the
[34:43] statements of a prophet in this last day
[34:46] how many are glad we had a Prophet come
[34:47] in this last day
[34:48] and Through the Bible and how God makes
[34:51] things open up in a certain season and
[34:53] we're thankful for that we have a a
[34:55] wonderful assembly back home and there
[34:57] are folks that really love the Lord and
[34:59] I'd love to minister to them and uh
[35:02] they're they're just special people but
[35:04] you know what I find that uh people it
[35:08] isn't our fault uh but God made us all
[35:10] human
[35:11] and we all have stresses and we all have
[35:13] the questions and we all have sometimes
[35:16] we have Forks in the road that
[35:19] um you know make things a little bit
[35:20] unclear and and so we'll wrestle at
[35:22] times or seasons in our life with
[35:24] decisions and uh God knows that and I I
[35:27] want to I want to underscore that for
[35:28] you that no matter where you are God
[35:31] knows where that is and he knows what
[35:32] that feels like he's able to be touched
[35:35] by the the infirmities that we have
[35:38] they're not foreign to him he
[35:40] understands how we feel he understands
[35:42] what it feels like to be alone and to be
[35:44] betrayed and to be criticized and uh to
[35:47] be persecuted and be lied about he
[35:49] understands all of that
[35:50] so it is not a thing that you can go
[35:52] through that that he can't relate to and
[35:54] that's that's a wonderful thing and he
[35:56] left us promises and he left us uh you
[35:59] know great consolation through his word
[36:01] uh that even though you may feel all
[36:04] alone you really are never all alone
[36:06] and and that's that's a great thing now
[36:08] it's an easy thing to say that but it's
[36:10] another thing to really angle let that
[36:11] anchor in your heart so that you can you
[36:14] can take that with you in some of the
[36:15] difficult valleys that you go through
[36:18] and so uh I just want to say this and
[36:20] and maybe there's there's someone here
[36:22] tonight that uh you know may benefit
[36:23] from this and I I trust that'll be the
[36:26] case so uh let's take a let's take a
[36:28] look here and uh a couple of
[36:31] introductory statements here brother
[36:32] Branham says now we're facing two
[36:34] scriptures uh in contrast
[36:37] and in this Shalom message he's
[36:39] referring back to the book of Isaiah
[36:41] chapter 61 and he's and it says in there
[36:43] arise and shine for the uh for your
[36:45] light Has Come For the Glory of God has
[36:47] come upon the Earth he said the light is
[36:49] here and and that's that's the first
[36:51] thing and then the second thing he said
[36:53] the next verse says but gross darkness
[36:55] is upon the people darkness is upon the
[36:57] Earth and gross darkness is upon the
[36:58] people
[36:59] and he said so we have a contrast here
[37:02] and the world is in one of the most
[37:03] chaotic times of Darkness that it ever
[37:06] stood in and yet it's standing and again
[37:08] the Most Blessed light that's ever shown
[37:12] what a paradox
[37:13] we have the greatest light by the
[37:15] greatest message we had the greatest
[37:17] understanding of the word of God as we
[37:18] said this morning that God's given us a
[37:21] perfect interpretation of the word of
[37:23] God
[37:23] and that's either really true it's
[37:25] really false I'm going to say it's
[37:27] really true I believe it's really true
[37:29] and he's given us that blessed light
[37:31] that that is greater than any other
[37:32] light of any other age but it's also a
[37:35] chaotic time of Darkness a great time of
[37:38] Darkness where there's a lot of
[37:39] Confusion And there's a lot of different
[37:41] opinions and there's a lot of access to
[37:43] everything in our age we have access to
[37:45] everything all the time isn't that right
[37:47] and and it's it can be really confusing
[37:49] because when you go uh when you try to
[37:51] find an answer and the way we all find
[37:53] an answer all the time is we
[37:55] Google that's exactly right
[37:57] and we want to know something that's
[37:59] where we go it's our first first uh
[38:00] resource right no matter where you are
[38:02] just about it's kind of a habit we just
[38:04] jump on and we Google things and find
[38:06] out not always a healthy habit but that
[38:08] is what we do and when we do that you'll
[38:11] find a a multitude of opinions about
[38:15] everything
[38:16] about everything
[38:18] and studies show this and then studies
[38:20] will show the opposite
[38:22] and studies will show that studies show
[38:24] that there really isn't any real clear
[38:26] answer on this
[38:28] and and it can be really chaotic but in
[38:30] a more serious sense uh there are there
[38:33] are things you have to Wade through to
[38:35] make sure you know where you're standing
[38:37] and to know what you believe
[38:39] because there are lots of different
[38:40] opinions
[38:41] brother Branham said this is be the way
[38:43] that it is but I will tell you something
[38:45] God never left us here without an answer
[38:48] to the problems that the age will throw
[38:50] with us
[38:51] God never leaves you in a place where
[38:53] there isn't an answer for the troubles
[38:55] that we face right we believe that and
[38:58] then again he says Ah got to turn it on
[39:01] who knew
[39:04] it wasn't meant for you brother Branham
[39:06] says to have peace here in this in this
[39:09] earth it was never meant for you to have
[39:12] peace here if you did you'd get
[39:14] accustomed to this world
[39:17] I mean you wouldn't want to leave right
[39:19] things would be pretty good God don't
[39:21] want you to be accustomized to this
[39:24] world he wants you to rest in him and
[39:28] come to him then and then you'll have
[39:30] peace
[39:32] God it was not meant for you to have
[39:34] peace here
[39:37] that doesn't that doesn't take a long
[39:39] time for us to agree with that's really
[39:42] true
[39:43] now I found this this scripture back
[39:45] here in Psalm 42 and verse 6 and David
[39:47] writes these words here he says oh my
[39:49] God my soul is cast down within me and
[39:52] therefore will I remember thee from the
[39:54] land of Jordan and of the hermanites and
[39:56] from the hill mizar
[39:58] and I looked at that and I wondered
[40:00] about what David was actually saying he
[40:03] said my soul is cast down Within Me I'm
[40:05] not asking for a show of hands but I'm
[40:07] sure a lot of us have times where
[40:09] Seasons where we're downcast we feel
[40:12] we're unsure we're maybe we're insecure
[40:15] about things and maybe we're uh we're
[40:17] thinking well things haven't come out
[40:19] the way that we thought they would
[40:20] and uh you know I'm 16 and I'm not
[40:23] married yet been a bridesmaids
[40:25] bridesmaid twice and I had not married
[40:27] yet you know Lord uh hello
[40:30] and and there are times when things
[40:32] happen to us that we don't always
[40:33] understand and there will be things that
[40:35] happen to you in life that you don't
[40:36] always understand there'll be things
[40:38] that happen in life that you don't have
[40:39] an answer for and there will be things
[40:41] that happen in your life that your
[40:43] pastor won't have an answer for
[40:45] there are things that will happen in
[40:47] life that you'll have to hang on until
[40:49] God makes that plane in your life that
[40:51] God makes that helps you understand what
[40:53] what's happened in your life and it's in
[40:55] times like that that your faith is going
[40:56] to have to hold you when your
[40:58] understanding doesn't
[41:01] there are things that are going to
[41:03] happen in in your life that you don't
[41:04] understand and it's then you're going to
[41:06] have to hang on by faith and not by
[41:07] understanding
[41:10] and so David says my soul is cast down
[41:13] within me and therefore will I remember
[41:15] thee from the land of Jordan and this is
[41:18] the he's referring here to the journey
[41:20] of the children of Israel on in the days
[41:22] of Moses he said I remember the from
[41:24] back there when when the children of
[41:26] Israel were in were across Jordan they
[41:28] were on the other side and they were in
[41:30] the land of the herminites and this is
[41:32] from Mount Hermon that's what he's
[41:34] referring to Mount Hermon Mount Hermon
[41:36] is in Jordan it's not in Israel and in
[41:39] in in the the hill mizar he's referring
[41:41] to locations that are outside the
[41:44] boundary of the land of Israel and David
[41:46] said I remember thee from then and the
[41:48] things that you did and back in those
[41:50] days in those particular locations God
[41:53] brought great victories for the children
[41:55] of Israel even though they weren't in
[41:57] the land they were outside the land but
[41:58] God did great things for them and David
[42:00] is saying that he said Lord I I feel bad
[42:03] my soul is cast down within me but I
[42:06] remember how you stood for the children
[42:07] of Israel back there outside the lamb
[42:10] and you helped us win great victories
[42:12] back then and I realized that Lord if
[42:14] you can help them outside the land what
[42:16] can you do inside the land
[42:19] and and to a to a Jew now the land is
[42:22] their inheritance isn't it it's their
[42:24] Promised Land the the actual physical
[42:26] land is and God said to Abraham look
[42:28] around and count the uh the the the the
[42:31] sand on the seashore that's your land
[42:33] that's your possessions your inheritance
[42:35] and for a Christian now our our land is
[42:38] not a physical land it's not it's not
[42:40] this building or it's not uh this town
[42:43] our land is the word of God the revealed
[42:45] word of the god that's our inheritance
[42:46] and and so David is saying that my if
[42:49] God can help people when they're outside
[42:51] what could God do for those that are on
[42:54] the inside
[42:55] and you know that tells me that uh you
[42:57] know there are times when uh in our
[42:59] lives and we can different circumstances
[43:01] can happen and we might feel like we're
[43:03] outside of the reach of God or you may
[43:06] have loved ones that are outside of the
[43:07] reach of God you remember this verse
[43:09] here and realize that even if a person
[43:11] strayed away and they're not where they
[43:13] should be they're not within the
[43:15] boundaries of where uh they should be
[43:16] God is still able to help them out there
[43:18] in the same way that he can help them in
[43:21] here
[43:21] and the minute where life takes you no
[43:23] matter where life drags you God can help
[43:25] you no matter where you are you just
[43:27] need to look up to him and remember him
[43:29] especially in those Seasons where we
[43:31] feel cast down yeah
[43:33] brother bam said in the breach he said
[43:35] for we know the whole creation groaned
[43:37] and travaileth in pain together until
[43:39] now he said Nature's groaning we're
[43:41] groaning everything is groaning because
[43:43] we realize there's something that's not
[43:45] right you know why because the whole
[43:47] earth is going back to its origin
[43:50] the whole earth is going back to uh to
[43:52] to the way things are and scientists
[43:55] will call it global warming and they'll
[43:57] call it all kinds of different things uh
[43:59] they'll try to get you not to eat
[44:00] McDonald's burgers with styrofoam
[44:02] containers because that's going to
[44:04] destroy the world I think it's going to
[44:06] take a little bit more than McDonald's
[44:07] containers to destroy the world the food
[44:09] will destroy the world not the
[44:11] containers and brother Graham said you
[44:14] know everything is groaning and and we
[44:16] realize in our heart we realize
[44:17] something's not right no matter how good
[44:20] you have it you realize there's
[44:21] something in you that's not settled that
[44:24] there's something more that that you
[44:25] want to you want to move on to the next
[44:28] thing that God has and brother bam says
[44:30] the only way we can do it has grown for
[44:32] it because that groaning comes from
[44:34] somewhere it is a calling to another
[44:37] kingdom that you really belong in and
[44:39] it's not this Kingdom it's that one like
[44:42] I said this morning you're not being
[44:43] conditioned to live here forever God is
[44:45] not God is not making a way for us to
[44:47] live in this world in this body forever
[44:49] because no matter how good you have it
[44:51] no matter how good you live you're still
[44:52] going to die
[44:54] God is conditioning us to live in
[44:56] another kingdom in another place right
[44:57] he's conditioning us to live uh where we
[45:00] where we belong where we actually belong
[45:02] and he already has a body for us over
[45:03] there but in this life and in this world
[45:06] we groan how many would agree we we
[45:08] Nature's groaning we're groaning
[45:10] everything is groaning and so in the in
[45:13] the path of life there are many attacks
[45:16] Satan will come at us physically there
[45:18] are physical things that happen to us
[45:20] there are mental stresses and mental
[45:23] diseases that people uh that people face
[45:27] and there is spiritual warfare that
[45:29] rages in a realm you don't always see
[45:32] but there are stresses there are fears
[45:34] uh there's nervousness uh there are
[45:37] things that happening in the spiritual
[45:38] realm and brother Branham helped us to
[45:40] uh acknowledge the fact that those those
[45:43] battles actually do rage I remember
[45:45] listening to brother Branham and he said
[45:47] he said see I don't know if you can hear
[45:48] it he said but that one demon is
[45:50] screaming at another one over here I
[45:52] went back and listened to those sermons
[45:53] very carefully and there was nothing you
[45:56] could hear in the natural
[45:57] there was no sounds of screaming in the
[45:59] natural but he's not in the natural per
[46:02] se he's caught between dimensions and
[46:04] he's he's hearing this thing that's
[46:06] going on and my goodness I don't doubt
[46:08] at all but that could be going on here
[46:10] tonight and we may not even realize it
[46:12] but you could be feeling some sort of
[46:13] pressure or some sort of influence in
[46:15] your life and those things are real how
[46:17] many would agree those things are real
[46:19] in the same way that if you have a
[46:21] broken leg you've really feel something
[46:23] if you go through a season where uh you
[46:28] know you have a fear in your life or you
[46:30] maybe you've experienced anxiety or
[46:32] maybe you worry about things you know
[46:34] what that's just as real as a broken leg
[46:38] and you know what I'd like to say this
[46:41] I'm of the school of thought I believe
[46:43] that my God can heal all of our diseases
[46:48] God has not limited himself just to
[46:51] fixing physical things
[46:54] he can heal arthritis he can heal
[46:56] diabetes he can heal heart problems he
[46:58] can do all of that but God can heal your
[47:00] broken heart
[47:02] God can heal God can pour oil upon a
[47:04] troubled mind
[47:06] God is able to calm your anxious fears I
[47:09] believe that I I believe that tonight
[47:10] because I I believe that he knows what
[47:13] you're going through no matter what it
[47:15] is that you're going through
[47:17] and this is not this is I'm not talking
[47:19] about psychology here or anything like
[47:21] that I'm talking about our healer who
[47:23] still lives today and is able to heal
[47:25] today the same as he ever could
[47:28] I said he's still a Healer tonight the
[47:30] same as he ever was
[47:34] and I believe there are many things that
[47:36] the people of God need especially in a
[47:38] world that's falling apart like brother
[47:40] Branham just described everything is
[47:42] groaning everything is changing
[47:43] everything is turning it's all going
[47:46] back to the way uh that it was meant to
[47:48] be and and I believe that God knows that
[47:50] the people who are in in the position
[47:52] we're called to be in which is the bride
[47:54] of Christ we're caught between those two
[47:57] Dimensions we're becoming caught between
[47:59] this life and the eternal because
[48:01] actually you're citizens of two kingdoms
[48:03] right
[48:04] you have a passport you can see in a one
[48:06] you can't see
[48:07] right and and we are actually citizens
[48:11] of two different kingdoms
[48:12] and and you're you're living you're
[48:14] living for one and you're living in one
[48:19] you're living in one you're living for
[48:20] one
[48:22] and so therefore you have two different
[48:23] kinds of pulls in your life and let me
[48:26] tell you sometimes that can be stressful
[48:27] brother manham says now there are times
[48:30] and things that happen
[48:32] that changes the whole course of your
[48:34] life
[48:35] there are times in your life and things
[48:37] that happen in your life that changes
[48:39] the course of your life we know that
[48:40] we're all aware you remember when
[48:42] brother Branham lost his daughter and
[48:44] his wife
[48:45] remember that I mean that changed him
[48:46] that that that changed him uh in a great
[48:49] way he never forgot that he that was an
[48:52] experience he carried with him all the
[48:54] way through and you remember when she
[48:55] was laying on the bed in the hospital
[48:57] and brother Brandon walked in and woke
[48:58] her up and she said bill you know why
[49:01] I'm going
[49:02] I thought oh my you know and and he he
[49:06] was the one who had listened to his
[49:07] mother-in-law and he's out there on the
[49:09] river trying to start the motor like
[49:10] that and she says bill you know why I'm
[49:12] going oh I'll tell you what that
[49:14] something like that would change a
[49:15] person's life
[49:16] there are people I know who have gone
[49:18] through car accidents and they've gone
[49:20] through uh calamities in their in their
[49:22] life they've gone through accidents that
[49:24] they never prayed for and never expected
[49:25] but all of a sudden life is different
[49:27] and certain things take place a long
[49:29] life's journey that changes the whole
[49:31] course of life for us and they're not
[49:33] always negative things uh you remember
[49:35] how Moses met got at the burning bush
[49:38] that changed everything didn't it
[49:40] I mean there was there was nothing the
[49:43] same for Moses after that when when he
[49:45] met God at The Burning Bush brother Matt
[49:47] God bless you good to have you here
[49:48] today they said you were coming
[49:51] and brother Branham says in Watchmen
[49:52] what of the night there is none of us
[49:54] that are immune from troubles
[49:57] there is none of us everybody say none
[50:00] of us
[50:01] none of us are immune from troubles
[50:04] in other words you're all vulnerable to
[50:05] the attacks of Satan there but I'm glad
[50:08] we have a resource but we're all immune
[50:11] we're sorry we're none of us are immune
[50:13] from the troubles that come and God has
[50:15] not promised to excuse us from all
[50:17] sickness but it is written that his
[50:19] strength is sufficient
[50:21] Christians get sick
[50:23] Christian cars break down
[50:27] Christian checks bounce
[50:29] right and you know what they bounce just
[50:31] as high as Pagan chicks
[50:34] they do
[50:36] Christians die
[50:39] my mom was a believer
[50:41] and she loved the Lord with all of her
[50:43] heart raised the Catholic all of her
[50:45] life and finally left the Catholic
[50:47] Church the Catholic Church
[50:49] and uh when she was 66 years old no she
[50:53] was 77 years old my dad died at 66 she
[50:55] was 77 and when she was 77 she had a
[50:58] pain always a healthy relatively healthy
[51:01] all of her life some of the Palmer's
[51:03] remember Sister coffee and and uh you
[51:07] know a healthy person all of her life
[51:09] you know just a spry ready to go all of
[51:12] a sudden one morning she woke up had a
[51:13] pain and discomfort
[51:15] and went to the doctor it got a little
[51:17] bit worse she went to the doctor after a
[51:18] couple of days and he took a look at her
[51:20] and they said we need to do a couple
[51:22] more tests I ran some more tests came in
[51:24] and sat her down in the in the office in
[51:26] the hospital in the ER and they said Mrs
[51:28] Coffey we need to tell you that you have
[51:31] pancreatic cancer
[51:33] and we are not going to treat you
[51:34] generally when they find pancreatic
[51:37] cancer it's often too advanced for them
[51:39] to do anything about it and they said to
[51:41] her we have no treatment for you at all
[51:43] we are giving you two months to live
[51:46] I mean this was a great shock to her
[51:49] because she uh she had no idea and you
[51:52] know just living her life just like you
[51:54] and I and uh carrying on and they said
[51:56] to her you have two months to live
[51:59] we my wife and I we went up and and we
[52:02] were with her for that uh period of that
[52:04] last two months and I would sit on the
[52:06] bed and I'd I I'd say to her you know
[52:09] just me and her be sitting there and I'd
[52:10] read her by read her Bible for her which
[52:13] I have her Bible and I'd say what do you
[52:15] want to hear and she'd say turn to the
[52:17] book of Philippians and I I'd open up to
[52:19] the book of Philippians I'd read chapter
[52:21] after chapter she just loved to hear it
[52:22] just lay there and listen to the word
[52:24] and I asked her one night I said Mom
[52:26] what does it feel like as a as a as a
[52:29] person just as a a you know an ordinary
[52:32] person who's living their life and then
[52:34] all of a sudden the doctor says you got
[52:35] two months to live tell me what that
[52:38] feels like
[52:39] what went through your mind when he said
[52:42] those words to You and she said nothing
[52:46] nothing went through my mind she said I
[52:48] wasn't afraid I wasn't nervous she said
[52:51] to me nothing changed she said this is
[52:55] what I've lived for
[52:56] I have lived to go back to Heaven she
[52:59] said I've lived to go back to my right
[53:01] body she said I've lived to go back and
[53:03] join those saints that have gone on the
[53:05] other side and she said I have no fear
[53:07] she said if I'm Healed I'll stay and if
[53:09] she says I I pass away she said I'm a
[53:12] I'm a citizen of another kingdom Where I
[53:14] Belong over there she said this holds no
[53:16] fear for me
[53:18] and I thought Lord I said to myself Lord
[53:20] Give Me That kind of a an attitude in
[53:23] the in in the valley like she's going
[53:25] through God has not promised to excuse
[53:27] us from sickness but it is written that
[53:30] his strength is sufficient how many
[53:31] believe that as a matter of fact many
[53:33] are the afflictions of the righteous
[53:36] but the Lord delivereths out of them all
[53:38] and he will never put so much upon us
[53:40] but what he will give us Grace to bear
[53:42] so we have that consolation
[53:45] he'll never give us so much that that it
[53:47] would be too great but what he will give
[53:49] us is Grace to Bear now I pastored in
[53:52] Ohio here for 16 years as I said this
[53:54] morning and some of the folks are here
[53:55] that were in that church and uh
[53:57] delighted to have him here tonight and I
[53:59] remember and you may not remember but
[54:01] I'm going to tell you this that we had a
[54:03] small church and and you know just uh uh
[54:06] small income in that church and I wasn't
[54:08] working I was trying to do things full
[54:09] time and uh I I man things were tight
[54:13] things were tight
[54:15] and uh you know I I just I prayed often
[54:18] and I just said Lord you know I you sent
[54:21] me here this is what your will is and I
[54:23] know that and I'm just leaning upon you
[54:26] and I'm just trusting you and I often
[54:27] prayed that prayer and uh just looked to
[54:30] him and one day I went to the mailbox
[54:32] and um I opened it up and there was a
[54:35] letter from Lee Vale brother Lee Vale
[54:37] and I didn't know brother veiled very
[54:39] well I had met him but I didn't know him
[54:41] really well but here was a letter from
[54:43] brother Lee Vale and I opened it up it
[54:45] was a letter and there was a check there
[54:46] for two thousand three hundred and
[54:48] eleven dollars and 50 cents I remember
[54:51] the amount
[54:52] two thousand three hundred and eleven
[54:54] dollars and fifty cents and I I looked
[54:58] at that and I read the letter brother
[55:00] Vale said he said in every small
[55:02] congregation you always need at least
[55:05] two more tithe pairs
[55:07] to make it work
[55:09] and he said so if you take the average
[55:10] salary and as brother Vale would do take
[55:13] the average salary of a person living in
[55:15] Ohio and have them pay tithes weekly
[55:18] multiply that by two and have it go out
[55:20] about three months this is the amount of
[55:22] money that should come into your church
[55:23] if you had two more time fares
[55:26] and then on then on the bottom I mean
[55:29] this is exactly what we had need of
[55:31] right at that moment there and and then
[55:33] on the bottom he said God never gives us
[55:35] more than we can bear but he comes real
[55:38] close sometimes
[55:42] and I I just said Thank You Lord thank
[55:45] you for for thinking about me here and
[55:47] and God never puts too much on us but
[55:49] he'll always give us Grace to bear and
[55:51] we have that consolation you know that
[55:53] you're not going through anything that
[55:55] God doesn't know about that you're not
[55:56] going through anything that God doesn't
[55:58] know about he knows all of your
[56:00] struggles and he knows all of the cares
[56:02] that you have and he has he has you in
[56:04] mind he has you on his heart and you
[56:06] know what he always has an answer for
[56:08] the things that we go through do you
[56:09] believe that tonight
[56:10] all right well let's let's just dig into
[56:13] that just a little bit is that all right
[56:14] let me give you some examples here and I
[56:16] think there these are really good ones
[56:18] they're some of my favorites here so uh
[56:19] let's talk about Elijah for a minute and
[56:22] and you know the scripture back here in
[56:24] First Kings chapter 19 after Mount
[56:26] Carmel and Elijah runs down the hill and
[56:28] he's gone with his servant the Bible
[56:30] says that that that he arose and he went
[56:33] for his life and he came to Beersheba
[56:35] which belonged to Judah and he left his
[56:37] servant there so he's by him he's him
[56:39] and his servant are Jezebel is pursuing
[56:42] him and she's got the power
[56:45] she's got the power to destroy him if
[56:47] she could catch him but she just can't
[56:49] capture and he's he's in the wilderness
[56:53] and then he goes to a certain distance
[56:55] and then leaves his servant there and
[56:57] you know what now he's all alone
[57:00] now this is a prophet so you think well
[57:02] brother Barry I've you know I've been
[57:04] going through something here hey this is
[57:05] a prophet now okay now watch watch how
[57:08] the Bible describes this situation here
[57:10] but he himself won today's Journey Into
[57:12] the Wilderness and he came and sat down
[57:14] under a juniper tree and he requested
[57:18] this was his prayer request he requested
[57:21] himself that he might die
[57:26] Lord I have a prayer request I'd like to
[57:30] die
[57:31] if that's all right
[57:33] who's taking up the prayer requests here
[57:35] I'd like to put that up in the Pulpit
[57:36] I'd like to die
[57:42] and he says
[57:44] it's enough
[57:46] I just don't think I can take any more
[57:50] I'd like to die I don't know if you've
[57:52] ever been there
[57:55] but he said I'd like to die oh Lord
[57:58] take away my life
[58:01] for I'm not better than my father's
[58:04] and he lay and slept under the juniper
[58:06] tree
[58:08] imagine as you're prophet of God
[58:11] I mean this is not this is not one of
[58:14] his servants this is a prophet of God
[58:15] who's there a man that's got that kind
[58:18] of communion with God and he's
[58:19] underneath the tree and he's just saying
[58:21] Lord if you don't mind I'd like to
[58:24] submit this request I'd like to die
[58:26] now brother man he says about this
[58:28] situation he says now don't be hard on
[58:31] Elijah he said I find myself under the
[58:33] juniper tree many times he says as a
[58:36] matter of fact I'm under there now and
[58:38] he describes that in detail in one in
[58:40] another sermon
[58:42] but he says now as he lay underneath to
[58:44] sleep in the juniper tree behold an
[58:46] angel touched him and said arise and eat
[58:49] now I'm just let's look at a statement
[58:52] here brother Brandon makes it in Elijah
[58:54] who was trying with a heart in him of
[58:57] God he was trying with all of his heart
[58:59] trying to show the people that God was
[59:01] still god well that was up among Carmel
[59:03] right and whoever whoever whichever
[59:05] altar God answers with fire that'll be
[59:07] the god we'll serve but I mean man what
[59:10] a state the country was in when all of
[59:12] the people are having to decide is God
[59:14] real or not
[59:16] I mean a lot of them are not sure
[59:18] whether bail is God or Jehovah is God
[59:20] they're not really sure imagine now
[59:22] living in a time like that when they're
[59:24] when the people are not clear about
[59:26] whether God is God or not
[59:28] and God answers God answers with fire
[59:30] God answered supernaturally and cleared
[59:33] up the question very carefully but
[59:34] Elijah now is is moving out into the
[59:37] Wilderness that anointing is lifting off
[59:38] him and he said it had backfired on him
[59:41] and he ran into Wilderness when he heard
[59:42] it when Jezebel was after him and he
[59:44] laid under the juniper tree to find
[59:46] consolation and he sent his servant away
[59:49] and left him and guess what from this
[59:51] point on in the story he's all alone
[59:56] and now brother Rana fills in the brush
[59:58] Strokes for us
[1:00:00] now he tells us here what really happens
[1:00:04] let me paraphrase it for you you'll find
[1:00:06] it here in Watchman or sorry what hear
[1:00:08] us now Elijah but don't read it don't
[1:00:10] read it let me tell you what what this
[1:00:12] quote says
[1:00:13] brother random looks down or Sorry God
[1:00:16] looks down at Elijah who's laying on the
[1:00:19] ground he's laying underneath this tree
[1:00:21] he's writing out prayer requests I'd
[1:00:23] like to die I'd like to die
[1:00:27] and he's laying down
[1:00:30] and he's he's he he to him there's no
[1:00:33] future there's
[1:00:34] there's nothing really worth living for
[1:00:38] right so he lays down
[1:00:41] and he closes his eyes
[1:00:45] lay down
[1:00:47] no right there on the chair is fine
[1:00:54] every good service needs a dummy I mean
[1:00:56] a volunteer so
[1:00:58] sorry did I say should I never said that
[1:01:03] so now this is what God does all right
[1:01:06] now if if you have later you can read
[1:01:08] the quote but this is what God does just
[1:01:09] relax okay
[1:01:13] God calls all the angels and he says hey
[1:01:15] hey get all the Angels line them up here
[1:01:17] and they want them all in a straight
[1:01:18] line if you don't mind and when you come
[1:01:21] and get in a straight line of Joel to
[1:01:22] hold your hands out like that he says to
[1:01:24] the angels hold your hands on like that
[1:01:28] and when they're all standing there God
[1:01:30] walks down through the line
[1:01:32] and picks the angel
[1:01:35] with the softest hands
[1:01:39] that's what he's looking for he's
[1:01:41] looking for the angel but the softest
[1:01:42] hands and he says
[1:01:45] now look I want you to come on with me
[1:01:49] and don't you scare him
[1:01:52] but I want you to walk over
[1:01:54] and just stroke his brow
[1:01:58] and I want you to go into the kitchen
[1:02:01] and cook them up something
[1:02:03] and put all the vitamins you got in
[1:02:05] there
[1:02:06] I want you to bring it to them
[1:02:09] now I think that's really great but you
[1:02:11] know what I think is greater
[1:02:13] is what brother Branham doesn't say
[1:02:16] and what God doesn't do what God doesn't
[1:02:18] do is say to him hey hey buddy you're in
[1:02:21] the message
[1:02:23] you know what you're a Believer hello
[1:02:26] you're a prophet you're not supposed to
[1:02:29] be down you're not supposed to feel bad
[1:02:31] you've got all the promises in the world
[1:02:33] they're all yours why don't you snap out
[1:02:36] of this do you realize how I've got to
[1:02:39] kind of make up something to tell
[1:02:41] everybody else to say that Elijah
[1:02:43] doesn't feel good
[1:02:45] you loser why don't you get back on your
[1:02:48] feet you're a Believer after all
[1:02:52] hello
[1:02:54] he doesn't do that
[1:02:56] God does not make him feel bad for
[1:02:59] feeling bad
[1:03:06] it ain't no fun to feel bad but God's
[1:03:08] not making him feel bad because he feels
[1:03:10] bad you know what God does God has a
[1:03:12] remedy for this situation and the remedy
[1:03:15] is not is not being aggressive and it's
[1:03:18] not shame and it's not more
[1:03:20] embarrassment here it's not him trying
[1:03:22] to push through something he's not able
[1:03:24] to push through God says I want you
[1:03:26] angel you got you with the softest hands
[1:03:28] go in the kitchen and if you don't mind
[1:03:30] make him up some biscuits and pour
[1:03:33] vitamins in there give them the good
[1:03:35] stuff give them the stuff that nobody
[1:03:37] else gets very easily and I want you to
[1:03:39] bring that to him and they laid it down
[1:03:42] and if you read the story they laid it
[1:03:44] down next to Elijah and they just went
[1:03:46] like this and they gently just woke him
[1:03:48] up and the Bible says that he woke up
[1:03:50] and he ate those biscuits and then he he
[1:03:53] was refreshed and he drank the water
[1:03:55] that was there and then he laid down
[1:03:57] again
[1:03:58] foreign
[1:03:59] for 40 days he lays down for 40 days
[1:04:02] again
[1:04:03] brother Bram said there's a lot of
[1:04:05] doctors that like to know what was in
[1:04:06] those cakes
[1:04:09] he said there's a lot of doctors that
[1:04:11] would love to know that because whatever
[1:04:13] it was it gave Elijah just enough space
[1:04:16] to kind of get back on his feet again
[1:04:18] and to begin to walk and to begin to
[1:04:21] kind of gather things together but you
[1:04:23] know what God never made him feel bad
[1:04:25] for feeling that way and I I'm just so
[1:04:27] thankful for that because I know as a
[1:04:29] human being we we're we're bound to find
[1:04:32] times in the valley that you know what
[1:04:34] you don't want to be there you're not
[1:04:36] praying Lord send me through hard times
[1:04:38] and Lord just break my spirit and Lord
[1:04:41] it just put me flat on my back lord may
[1:04:44] bring me to the place where I can make
[1:04:46] prayer requests that I'd like to die we
[1:04:48] don't get up in the morning and pray for
[1:04:50] that do we we pray for protection we
[1:04:52] pray for God's leadership we pray to be
[1:04:54] you know strong and we pray to be full
[1:04:56] of joy because the joy of the Lord is
[1:04:58] your strength and we pray that way and
[1:05:00] we want it to be that way we pray in
[1:05:01] that way for our children and for our
[1:05:03] church if you're a pastor but you know
[1:05:05] what life happens
[1:05:06] and life is not always straight and flat
[1:05:08] and predictable even if you're
[1:05:10] predestinated life sometimes will throw
[1:05:12] things at you that you're not expecting
[1:05:14] but I will tell you this that all things
[1:05:16] work together for good to them that love
[1:05:18] God
[1:05:19] and here he is he's saying this
[1:05:21] soft-handed Angel went over and
[1:05:22] ministered to him and then brother
[1:05:24] banham throws this sentence in here I
[1:05:26] believe for me and you and he says
[1:05:28] remember if you've done your best he
[1:05:30] said God still got those angels in order
[1:05:33] he loves you just the same as he did
[1:05:36] Elijah
[1:05:38] [Music]
[1:05:42] thank you
[1:05:48] don't feel bad for feeling bad
[1:05:52] don't make a determination in your
[1:05:54] hearts you're going to stay there
[1:05:58] and don't get on Facebook and tell the
[1:06:00] world hey this is how I feel so
[1:06:02] everybody will Pity Me
[1:06:06] should I understand that
[1:06:09] oh
[1:06:14] but no matter what you go through I'm
[1:06:16] here to tell you tonight God loves you
[1:06:17] the same as he did Elijah
[1:06:19] I feel like getting up there buddy
[1:06:22] God reaches out of hand
[1:06:26] to those that really need that that hand
[1:06:29] reached out
[1:06:31] can I go a little further
[1:06:33] ladies a stranger brother brand says in
[1:06:35] the prayer line I don't know you we're
[1:06:37] strangers but I notice you have a phobia
[1:06:40] of he said something about the winter
[1:06:42] time
[1:06:43] and and when winter time comes you get
[1:06:45] scared and it makes you all upset and it
[1:06:47] makes you constipated he said you can't
[1:06:49] eat right that's true
[1:06:51] he said I cursed that devil in the name
[1:06:53] of Jesus Christ go home and I won't
[1:06:55] bother you no more it's left you
[1:06:58] so in other words here what he's helping
[1:07:00] us to understand is that people can
[1:07:02] actually have a physical manifestation
[1:07:05] of a fear or a stress that's going on
[1:07:08] somewhere else
[1:07:10] you understand
[1:07:11] there's a connection and sometimes it
[1:07:15] takes God to figure out that connection
[1:07:16] because a doctor and bless their hearts
[1:07:20] and you know when you say bless your
[1:07:21] heart you can say whatever you want to
[1:07:23] after that
[1:07:24] bless their hearts a good doctor is
[1:07:27] going to look at that symptom and try to
[1:07:29] deal with that but you know what he's
[1:07:31] dealing with the wrong affecting that
[1:07:33] person now here's again brother Branham
[1:07:36] says in he's actually here
[1:07:38] in Cleveland Ohio
[1:07:40] he says you have a few troubles inward
[1:07:43] troubles and I see what's wrong he said
[1:07:45] you tried everything to get well
[1:07:48] been the doctors it's a nerve condition
[1:07:51] and nothing you take nothing can help
[1:07:54] you he said you've been given up the
[1:07:57] doctors have kind of you know
[1:08:00] but Jesus will help you now
[1:08:03] he said you want to be healthy
[1:08:06] have all that weary gloomy crazy feeling
[1:08:09] like you're losing your mind
[1:08:11] he said you want to be healthy you don't
[1:08:12] want to have all that now that started
[1:08:15] he said on the prostate
[1:08:18] who knew
[1:08:21] who knew he's taken all kinds of things
[1:08:23] for nervous problems and that's not
[1:08:25] where it began at all but really what
[1:08:28] it's doing he said it's a demon it
[1:08:29] haunts you and you have no peace at all
[1:08:31] and day and night it's after you seems
[1:08:34] like you just get gloomy feelings in
[1:08:35] there weary don't sleep nervous getting
[1:08:38] up at night down through your life
[1:08:40] you've had trouble
[1:08:42] when you were a little boy with knee
[1:08:45] pants on I believe it was a dog that
[1:08:47] chased you and you ran up onto a porch
[1:08:49] and who would know that but God Alone
[1:08:52] how marvelous he said how marvelous you
[1:08:56] know why because now we've tracked it
[1:08:58] back to the cause of the problem and
[1:09:01] when you know the cause of the problem
[1:09:02] Hey listen that's about half the battle
[1:09:04] when we know how to pray we know how to
[1:09:07] deal with that
[1:09:08] and he said now I'm going to ask God to
[1:09:10] leave you to let it leave you and while
[1:09:12] I'm praying you say I love this
[1:09:15] I love this from Brother Graham tells us
[1:09:17] how to pray
[1:09:18] I mean that takes the mystery out of
[1:09:21] what you should say in a situation like
[1:09:22] this right and he tells the man he said
[1:09:24] you say this in your heart Jesus I
[1:09:26] believe with all my heart and now I
[1:09:28] commit myself to you and I believe the
[1:09:29] prayer of faith is going to save me now
[1:09:31] that's what he told him to pray you know
[1:09:34] I'd be willing to say that if you you
[1:09:35] prayed that in your situation if you
[1:09:37] prayed that in your condition that would
[1:09:39] probably be okay with God too
[1:09:41] you don't need to have a long
[1:09:42] theological prayer oh god of Heaven thou
[1:09:45] who has created us heavens and the Earth
[1:09:46] hey God already knows that
[1:09:49] you just need to tell him I believe it
[1:09:51] on my heart and I believe the prayer
[1:09:53] Faith's going to save the sick
[1:09:55] you just be real and just talk to God
[1:09:57] and just let God deal with this because
[1:10:00] you know what God is the one who
[1:10:01] uncovered the cause he's the one who's
[1:10:02] got the solution as well he said let's
[1:10:04] pray bow our heads together and he
[1:10:07] speaks to that spirit and so forth
[1:10:09] without demon tormenting his life in the
[1:10:11] name of Jesus come out and he says it's
[1:10:13] gone you're free go out of here
[1:10:15] testifying he said you feel all right
[1:10:17] fine wonderful he said go out there
[1:10:20] happy rejoicing testifying and he said
[1:10:22] telling people that God healed you
[1:10:24] forget you were ever nervous and 30 days
[1:10:28] from now you'll be a different man God
[1:10:29] bless you my brother
[1:10:31] you know what he doesn't say he doesn't
[1:10:34] say my goodness you are a Christian
[1:10:36] you're a Believer you're hearing a
[1:10:38] prayer line Christians don't get sad
[1:10:40] Christians don't get nervous Christians
[1:10:42] can he doesn't do that he doesn't make
[1:10:44] them feel bad because he feels bad he
[1:10:46] goes all the way relying on the Holy
[1:10:49] Spirit to find the cause and then deals
[1:10:51] out and brings it all the way forward
[1:10:56] you look at how God dealt with Elijah
[1:10:58] you look how a prophet in this age dealt
[1:11:00] with people that came in the prayer line
[1:11:01] over and over and over again sister he
[1:11:05] says you have trouble inward trouble
[1:11:07] it's a nervous condition and you feel
[1:11:09] like you're going to lose your mind and
[1:11:11] it works on you worst time is in the
[1:11:12] evening because light has a lot to do
[1:11:15] with this and he says sometimes you just
[1:11:17] go sit in a chair and you're doing
[1:11:19] something when you're praying too and I
[1:11:21] believe you were washing dishes and you
[1:11:22] were praying and when you heard about
[1:11:24] the meeting you prayed and then you got
[1:11:25] a card and you came tonight and the card
[1:11:28] was called now watch what he says he
[1:11:29] says now you believe that God will hear
[1:11:31] my prayer he said ask God and do you
[1:11:33] believe that if I would tell you if if I
[1:11:36] would tell you that it left you you
[1:11:38] would know that I told you the truth in
[1:11:39] other words you're going to know when
[1:11:40] this is gone you're going to know when
[1:11:42] this heaviness or this darkness that
[1:11:44] blankets you is actually gone and he
[1:11:46] said and everything seems like a phobia
[1:11:48] that's a Greek word for fear everything
[1:11:51] he said seems like you're nervous about
[1:11:53] everything you're nervous about your
[1:11:54] kids you're nervous about how your
[1:11:55] husband drives well I mean most women
[1:11:57] are that phobia is very common that sure
[1:12:00] is
[1:12:01] you're nervous about your health you're
[1:12:03] nervous about the times you're nervous
[1:12:04] about whether you're going to make it
[1:12:05] you're with all of that and it isn't
[1:12:07] normal to be that fearful isn't normal
[1:12:11] you're wanting hey this is not Dr Dobson
[1:12:14] now
[1:12:15] is that all right
[1:12:18] there's a prophet now 20th century
[1:12:20] prophet and he's saying I'm only saying
[1:12:22] what the tape say
[1:12:24] he said you're wanting to get well and
[1:12:25] I'm going to ask Jesus how to he said
[1:12:27] now to heal you and I believe he will do
[1:12:30] it and he said you've had quite a
[1:12:32] struggle in life and I don't have to say
[1:12:34] it in other words he's he's avoiding
[1:12:36] saying something to this woman in public
[1:12:38] care he said because this is alive here
[1:12:40] this is this is being recorded so he
[1:12:43] said I I don't have to say it and I
[1:12:45] don't want to say it here in front of
[1:12:46] you if he said you know what I'm
[1:12:47] speaking of so there's things that are
[1:12:49] going on here and he prays for this
[1:12:51] woman and he comes down he said foul
[1:12:53] Spirits have tried to put Pride upon her
[1:12:55] who knew
[1:12:57] who knew this is where this is where
[1:13:00] this is coming from and he said but Thou
[1:13:02] Art here to remove this curse of the
[1:13:04] enemy he said help me God in this Duel
[1:13:06] of faith and and then he he continues to
[1:13:08] pray and then he says I was just trying
[1:13:11] to get her in the right mental attitude
[1:13:14] she wouldn't have to be prayed for I was
[1:13:16] just trying to get her in that right
[1:13:17] mental attitude she wouldn't have to be
[1:13:19] prayed for because the right mental
[1:13:21] attitude towards any promise of God will
[1:13:23] bring it to pass
[1:13:26] so in other words here he is trying to
[1:13:28] move this woman into a position of faith
[1:13:30] and he's trying to bring her up to a
[1:13:32] level where now he can he can the Holy
[1:13:34] Spirit can uncover that and give her the
[1:13:36] solution give her the Deliverance that
[1:13:37] she needs here but there's obviously
[1:13:39] some complex things that are going on
[1:13:40] here that he doesn't really describe to
[1:13:42] us but there are things that are
[1:13:43] happening and he's he's being very
[1:13:46] gentle really with her he's not shaming
[1:13:48] her in public
[1:13:50] he's not shaming her in front of the
[1:13:52] church are you hearing me tonight
[1:13:54] he's he's he's gently dealing with this
[1:13:58] woman here and the pride and the issues
[1:14:00] that are there let me tell you saying to
[1:14:02] God I I would just say this very very
[1:14:05] gently here diplomatically here as much
[1:14:07] as I can I I know that in a congregation
[1:14:10] this size there's probably some people
[1:14:11] that are going through things that they
[1:14:13] wish they weren't going through
[1:14:16] and I I don't know your history I don't
[1:14:17] know all your histories I don't know
[1:14:18] what what's happening in your household
[1:14:20] but I I know this that one of the worst
[1:14:22] things I could do is just to Simply say
[1:14:24] to you snap out of it because if you
[1:14:27] could snap out of it you probably would
[1:14:29] have done that a long time before this
[1:14:30] service
[1:14:32] and if you get if you could untie the
[1:14:34] knots and you could make things all
[1:14:36] level and peaceful in your household and
[1:14:38] have shalom in the home you'd probably
[1:14:40] would have done that a long time ago but
[1:14:42] there are times when you just need to
[1:14:44] see the supernatural moving of God and
[1:14:47] you need to just appeal to him and say
[1:14:49] Lord I I'm praying to prayer of faith
[1:14:51] and I'm just expecting tonight and
[1:14:52] trusting in you
[1:14:54] and and and there are some times where
[1:14:56] listen there are some times where we do
[1:14:58] not have the right mental attitude and
[1:15:00] sometimes it takes maybe a sermon like
[1:15:02] this or something at this weekend like
[1:15:03] this and helps us to realize we can
[1:15:06] trust him we can have confidence in him
[1:15:09] we can rest in his promises and and we
[1:15:12] can have faith in God and and that's
[1:15:14] what brother that's exactly what brother
[1:15:15] Bam's trying to do here in this
[1:15:17] situation
[1:15:21] hahaha
[1:15:24] now brother bam said now you're looking
[1:15:26] this way as we talk and he said now do
[1:15:28] you believe the Bible is true he's again
[1:15:30] he's in a prayer line now your trouble
[1:15:31] he said you've had an accident now watch
[1:15:33] this I I think this is amazing what he
[1:15:36] sees here in this man's life
[1:15:38] he said your trouble he said you've had
[1:15:40] an accident and in that accident in your
[1:15:43] factory you were gassed with carbon
[1:15:45] monoxide gas
[1:15:47] and it poisoned you in your liver and
[1:15:50] you've had trouble with that
[1:15:52] and you had trouble with your stomach
[1:15:55] and had trouble with your heart and the
[1:15:57] man says right
[1:15:59] and it's made you so nervous until you
[1:16:01] built yourself in a complex
[1:16:04] but your poor
[1:16:06] and you got to go back to work
[1:16:09] so there's no workman's compensation
[1:16:10] back then and there's no safety
[1:16:13] standards in the in the factory so that
[1:16:15] he's got a harmful chemical that's
[1:16:16] affecting his liver who knew right
[1:16:19] and he's got nowhere to turn but he also
[1:16:22] has no money so he's got to go back to
[1:16:23] work but he said you're afraid to go
[1:16:25] back to work afraid of the carbon
[1:16:27] monoxide gas
[1:16:29] uh hello how can you blame the guy
[1:16:34] right see where he's at he didn't wake
[1:16:36] up and say Lord send carbon monoxide gas
[1:16:39] today he didn't do that he's a victim of
[1:16:42] circumstances that he did not cause I
[1:16:45] mean this is not something he brought
[1:16:46] down on himself now there are some
[1:16:48] things that happen that you brought down
[1:16:49] on yourself
[1:16:50] right there are some things that we do
[1:16:52] that bring trouble into our lives we
[1:16:54] know that's true but we also know that
[1:16:56] there are situations in our life we did
[1:16:58] not cause
[1:16:59] we did not bring them into our lives but
[1:17:01] they're there anyway because you know
[1:17:03] why you have an enemy and you have an
[1:17:05] enemy that works overtime studying you
[1:17:07] even when you're asleep to try to do
[1:17:09] whatever he can to do whatever he can to
[1:17:11] make your life miserable and to get you
[1:17:13] to doubt the promises of God and to turn
[1:17:16] your trust away from him and that enemy
[1:17:18] works over time in doing that and here's
[1:17:20] this man he's thought it all out he's
[1:17:22] he's faced with a situation here he's
[1:17:25] got a hungry family he's got to go back
[1:17:26] to work he's he's got these problems
[1:17:29] physically in major organs here and
[1:17:31] brother bam says you're afraid to go
[1:17:33] back to work afraid of the carbon
[1:17:34] monoxide gas but he said it's going to
[1:17:37] be all right remember if he'll tell me
[1:17:39] who you are will you accept it and go
[1:17:41] back and be of good cheer he said your
[1:17:43] name is Mr Wagner go back on your road
[1:17:45] it's over
[1:17:52] I got news for you tonight he's the same
[1:17:55] yesterday today and forever
[1:17:59] God don't want you to be sad you know
[1:18:02] what temper does he said that's one of
[1:18:04] the awfullest things there is because
[1:18:05] about 60 percent of the cause of all
[1:18:07] sickness is temper
[1:18:09] and God does not want you to be sad God
[1:18:11] does not want you to be stressed so
[1:18:13] here's a good question what do we do
[1:18:17] if you're in this place tonight what do
[1:18:19] you do what are our remedies what can we
[1:18:23] apply
[1:18:24] in order to deal with the pressures of
[1:18:27] Life the situations we find ourselves in
[1:18:29] we don't have brother Brown to go to
[1:18:32] right
[1:18:33] we can't go to Jeffersonville and knock
[1:18:35] on his door we can't be like Naaman the
[1:18:37] leper who came to the prophet and asked
[1:18:40] for an answer we we don't have a place
[1:18:42] to go like that we don't have a place to
[1:18:44] go like that but we do have a place to
[1:18:46] turn
[1:18:47] let me give you a couple of places to
[1:18:49] turn is that all right are we okay the
[1:18:52] rest of this service now tonight we're
[1:18:53] going to deal with a couple of things we
[1:18:54] can do number one you can let off the
[1:18:56] pressure
[1:18:58] because worrying really doesn't help
[1:18:59] very much
[1:19:01] he said now you say
[1:19:03] well I wonder brother Branham he said
[1:19:06] don't wonder let off the pressure commit
[1:19:08] your case to God and go on as if it was
[1:19:11] all over
[1:19:13] don't build up pressure it lets off
[1:19:15] pressure when you do that when you give
[1:19:17] it to the right one and you know God's
[1:19:18] got it when you lay it at his feet you
[1:19:20] know he's heard it you can walk away now
[1:19:22] let's let's do it this way all right
[1:19:24] hello there
[1:19:25] let's say let's say that I got a problem
[1:19:28] with my watch
[1:19:30] okay and I can't fix it I've tried but I
[1:19:34] can't fix it and since I bought this
[1:19:36] watch in another country I can't really
[1:19:37] go back and and you know give it to the
[1:19:40] guy who I bought it from so
[1:19:42] I got to bring to the repairman right so
[1:19:44] you're the watch repairman and I give it
[1:19:47] to him now what do I do

[1:19:59] now you hand me the tools you have some
[1:20:01] of the tools I'll have some of the tools
[1:20:02] do we do that

[1:20:06] repairman
[1:20:07] no you know what we do we say hey my
[1:20:09] watch is broken how much is going to
[1:20:10] cost well five bucks yeah because your
[1:20:12] brother Barry four bucks okay Hey listen
[1:20:14] I'll be back in a couple of days and you
[1:20:16] know what you do you walk away
[1:20:18] [Applause]
[1:20:23] God bless you my brother you're a
[1:20:26] blessing even despite what people say
[1:20:28] about you I think you're a blessing
[1:20:31] I don't need to stick around and Coach
[1:20:33] God or assist God in how he's going to
[1:20:35] fix the problem
[1:20:36] yeah
[1:20:37] I don't need to do that you know what
[1:20:39] God knows how to repair every problem
[1:20:40] you bring to him you don't need to hang
[1:20:42] around and say how's it going how's it
[1:20:44] going how's it going how's it going hey
[1:20:45] let God do his job let God Work It Out
[1:20:48] he'll work it out he knows what he's
[1:20:50] doing
[1:20:53] oh you say I'm Soul I'm so worried
[1:20:57] brother random I just don't know hey he
[1:20:59] said let off the pressure cast your
[1:21:01] cares on him for he cares for you don't
[1:21:04] you worry about your cares that's his
[1:21:07] business
[1:21:09] when you give it to God that's his
[1:21:11] business
[1:21:12] not your business anymore
[1:21:16] the devil likes to work on you and
[1:21:18] oppress you he said that's a trick of
[1:21:20] the devil to oppress you but when the
[1:21:22] Christian knows he's legal rights he can
[1:21:23] quote God's word and say I'll never
[1:21:25] leave thee nor forsake thee that takes
[1:21:27] all the oppression away and the clouds
[1:21:30] begin to clear back I think that's
[1:21:31] wonderful we all know Psalm 91 right and
[1:21:35] he that abideth in the dwelleth in the
[1:21:36] secret of the most high shall abide in
[1:21:39] the shadow of the almighty and I will
[1:21:41] say of the Lord this is what David says
[1:21:42] I will say of the Lord he's my refuge
[1:21:44] and my Fortress my God in him will I
[1:21:47] trust and surely he will Deliver Me From
[1:21:49] The Snare which is a trap of the Fowler
[1:21:53] who's a center of traps and from the
[1:21:56] overwhelming pestilence and the noise
[1:21:58] and the all the commotion around me he
[1:22:01] will deliver me from that he will
[1:22:04] deliver me from the trap he'll deliver
[1:22:05] me from the center of traps he'll
[1:22:07] deliver me from all the commotion that
[1:22:09] that Center of traps tries to put in my
[1:22:12] pathway
[1:22:13] do you believe that tonight
[1:22:15] I will say of the Lord he's my refuge
[1:22:17] you better you better uh write that
[1:22:19] verse down put it on your fridge that's
[1:22:21] the most popular door in our house is
[1:22:22] the fridge and put it on that on that
[1:22:24] door and remind yourself that I will put
[1:22:27] my trust in him because he is my refuge
[1:22:30] and he's my Fortress he's my defense
[1:22:33] brother Graham said cry for your needs
[1:22:35] that's God's provided away didn't Jesus
[1:22:37] explain it when he uh when he said the
[1:22:39] unjust judge and the woman came and
[1:22:41] prayed day and night Martin Luther said
[1:22:43] uh this about that verse he said what
[1:22:46] you need to do is take the Canon of
[1:22:48] prayer and aim it at the Gates of Heaven
[1:22:50] and keep firing until somebody opens it
[1:22:52] up
[1:22:54] that's what you need to do
[1:22:56] and brother bam said you don't just kind
[1:22:58] of say well Lord how about this and then
[1:23:00] walk away he said no he said you want to
[1:23:02] keep presenting that in faith before God
[1:23:04] until you know God's got it and then you
[1:23:06] can have confidence
[1:23:10] let's go back to Psalm 91 that's the
[1:23:12] first thing you want to do you want to
[1:23:13] make sure you cast your cares upon Him
[1:23:14] and let off the pressure number two you
[1:23:17] want to remind yourself that God loves
[1:23:18] you and he's not forsaking you
[1:23:21] he cares about you
[1:23:23] Psalm 91 again
[1:23:25] this is now God responding and speaking
[1:23:28] to David thou shall tread upon the line
[1:23:29] and the adder and the Young Lion and the
[1:23:31] dragon thou shall trample under your
[1:23:33] feet because he has set his love upon me
[1:23:36] therefore will I deliver him because
[1:23:39] you're in the message
[1:23:41] because you're in this church because
[1:23:44] you went to Jeffersonville and got a
[1:23:45] handful of dirt
[1:23:46] no because you shook brother bram's hand
[1:23:48] no that's not it
[1:23:50] because he has set his love upon me I
[1:23:53] don't know why God loves me but he loves
[1:23:55] me and I'm amazed that he loves me I'm
[1:23:57] absolutely amazed that he loves me but
[1:23:59] he does he loves me and because he loves
[1:24:01] me therefore will I deliver him and
[1:24:04] that's the promise it's not because I
[1:24:06] get it all right it's not because I say
[1:24:07] all the right things it's that because I
[1:24:09] don't make any mistakes I do make
[1:24:11] mistakes every one of us makes mistakes
[1:24:13] here but that's not what God's looking
[1:24:14] at God does not look at your faults and
[1:24:17] failures God looks at your name on the
[1:24:19] Lamb's Book of Life and he said I set my
[1:24:21] love upon him therefore will I deliver
[1:24:22] him I'll set him on high because I know
[1:24:25] his name
[1:24:26] man
[1:24:27] bro I love the way brother bam says this
[1:24:29] there is a real power of the holy spirit
[1:24:31] that delivers delivers the sufferer from
[1:24:35] his suffering
[1:24:37] there is a real do you believe that
[1:24:39] there's a real power of the Holy Spirit

[1:25:14] believer and believe the word and then

[1:25:26] oh we might as well do this is that all
[1:25:28] right everybody okay
[1:25:31] if you need a drink come on up I got a
[1:25:33] bottle of water here you can we can
[1:25:35] share that
[1:25:37] in your Bible Mark chapter 35 uh sorry
[1:25:41] Mark 4 35 38 it tells the story of all
[1:25:44] these Miracles and great things that
[1:25:46] happen in Israel in the days of Jesus
[1:25:48] many were brought to him that were
[1:25:50] healed the Pharisees contested to him he
[1:25:52] won the argument I mean it was just
[1:25:53] amazing there's all kinds of Miracles
[1:25:55] Supernatural things this is one of those
[1:25:57] chapters where it says that Jesus healed
[1:25:59] them all they all came but all manner of
[1:26:00] diseases and he healed them all
[1:26:03] and then he says to his disciples he
[1:26:05] said hey let's let's let's get in the
[1:26:08] boat let's go across that was not
[1:26:10] uncommon because this is where this
[1:26:11] happened I've been there we're going to
[1:26:12] Israel Lord willing in November if you
[1:26:14] want to go let me know and Jesus gets in
[1:26:17] the boat with the disciples and they
[1:26:18] launch out Under the Sea of Galilee and
[1:26:20] they move
[1:26:21] gently across the lake gently enough
[1:26:23] that Jesus falls asleep on the pillow
[1:26:26] and
[1:26:27] the disciples are rolling the boat and
[1:26:30] all of a sudden
[1:26:31] you know the winds come up and the the
[1:26:34] The Tempest Rises and Jesus is sound
[1:26:39] asleep in the back of the boat
[1:26:41] not worried at all
[1:26:43] I mean they're frantic they're they're
[1:26:45] panicking and uh Jesus is not worried at
[1:26:48] all oh I'll tell you what I just as a
[1:26:50] footnote I'd love to have the kind of a
[1:26:52] spirit that didn't fear in the middle of
[1:26:54] a storm
[1:26:56] I just I just like to have that
[1:27:00] and so they wake him up and they say hey
[1:27:01] Master uh do you don't you care that we
[1:27:04] perish and Jesus says hey hey you have
[1:27:06] little faith and he stands up on the
[1:27:07] brow of the boat and he speaks to it and
[1:27:09] as if they couldn't see anything greater
[1:27:11] than what they just saw on the other
[1:27:12] side of the lake now they're looking who
[1:27:15] is this man that speaks to the storm
[1:27:19] and so they get off on the other side
[1:27:21] and they walk and lo and behold are in
[1:27:22] the land of the gadarenes
[1:27:25] you go walk up the hill
[1:27:27] everybody except Jesus starts to slow
[1:27:30] down
[1:27:31] whoa
[1:27:32] we know where we are
[1:27:34] this is a place where there ain't no
[1:27:36] towns
[1:27:37] this is a place where
[1:27:39] there's no hotels
[1:27:42] this is the place where that guy lives
[1:27:45] yeah this is a place you don't wander
[1:27:47] into at night
[1:27:49] and everybody's slowing down except
[1:27:51] Jesus and all of a sudden he comes on
[1:27:54] this man as if they hadn't seen
[1:27:55] everything I mean as if they hadn't seen
[1:27:56] great Supernatural things he Encounters
[1:27:59] this man and you know the story
[1:28:02] Mark chapter 5 and and as you read
[1:28:05] through that chapter it says that this
[1:28:08] demon now the Demon's Legion speak to
[1:28:10] Jesus and they have this
[1:28:12] conversation going back and forth and
[1:28:14] and they cry out to him and say what
[1:28:16] does that'll do to do with us and so
[1:28:18] forth they cast them out and they said
[1:28:19] let us go on the swine and they go into
[1:28:21] swine they run down the hill and they
[1:28:23] all die the people of the Town come out
[1:28:24] and say hey that's our job that's our
[1:28:26] livelihood and they're actually trying
[1:28:28] to run them out imagine now the
[1:28:30] disciples looking at this and thinking
[1:28:31] wow another great miracle and they want
[1:28:33] to run Jesus out they want to kick us
[1:28:35] out I mean who knew and
[1:28:39] so the Bible says then
[1:28:45] in Mark chapter 5
[1:28:47] and I'd like to I'd like to read it for
[1:28:49] you if that's all right Mark chapter
[1:28:51] five if you have your Bible I've spoiled
[1:28:53] you by putting everything on the screen
[1:28:54] here
[1:28:56] let's do this on the old-fashioned way
[1:28:59] Mark chapter 5 verse 15.
[1:29:08] and they came to Jesus and see him that
[1:29:11] was possessed with the Devil the people
[1:29:12] in the town hear about this and they run
[1:29:15] out there they're not in this place
[1:29:16] because nobody was in this place the sky
[1:29:18] was in this place and so they come out
[1:29:20] of the town and they run up to the scene
[1:29:22] and they're looking at this and they
[1:29:23] recognize that's the man who was crazy
[1:29:25] and you know where he is
[1:29:28] they see him that was possessed with the
[1:29:30] devil and had the legion sitting and
[1:29:33] clothed and in his right mind
[1:29:38] and they were afraid
[1:29:42] and they saw and then they they that saw
[1:29:46] told them how it befell on him and he
[1:29:48] was possessed with the devil and also
[1:29:49] concerning the swine they're telling the
[1:29:51] story here and they began to pray him to
[1:29:53] deliver uh deliver uh depart sorry out
[1:29:56] of their coasts and when he was coming
[1:29:58] to the ship he that had been possessed
[1:30:00] with the devil prayed that he might go
[1:30:01] with him this man when the people of the
[1:30:04] town I want you to notice now when the
[1:30:06] people of the Town come out they look
[1:30:07] around and here's this man dressed now
[1:30:09] normally he looks like a Believer and I
[1:30:12] mean he's acting
[1:30:14] normal and you know what he's doing is
[1:30:15] sitting at the feet of Jesus
[1:30:20] now I'd just like to say that and say
[1:30:22] this about that scripture verse that
[1:30:24] story that story tells us a lot of
[1:30:26] things but one of the things that I get
[1:30:27] from it is that
[1:30:29] you you in in the in the execution of
[1:30:32] the Gospel in in the way that Jesus
[1:30:34] lived his life he did two things here
[1:30:36] one was he did the supernatural
[1:30:39] extraordinary thing of casting the demon
[1:30:42] out of this person and bringing
[1:30:44] Deliverance to a man who could not
[1:30:46] deliver himself
[1:30:47] he was completely Bound by these demons
[1:30:50] and he could not rescue himself he could
[1:30:52] not he could not live a normal life and
[1:30:55] and Jesus did that and freed that man
[1:30:58] absolutely freed that man and let him go
[1:31:00] and those demons were gone in another
[1:31:02] place and and now he's not going to have
[1:31:04] to worry about them anymore he's free
[1:31:06] thank God he's free he's set free
[1:31:08] and that's the Supernatural part that
[1:31:11] God can do and I believe that God can
[1:31:13] still do that today
[1:31:14] but I believe this also that a real
[1:31:17] encounter with God will bring you to the
[1:31:19] feet of Jesus
[1:31:24] I say
[1:31:25] we need both
[1:31:27] you can't just say we're going to have
[1:31:29] the supernatural demon casting out kind
[1:31:32] of religion and that's it you know what
[1:31:35] when a person really gets delivered you
[1:31:37] know what they want to do they want to
[1:31:38] hang around with Jesus they want to hang
[1:31:40] they want to go wherever he goes they
[1:31:42] want to hey are you leaving I'm leaving
[1:31:43] too and where where are you going I'm
[1:31:45] going to go with you I don't want to be
[1:31:46] I don't want to be back here I want to
[1:31:47] be with you and and he was determined to
[1:31:50] go now with the Savior and to deliver
[1:31:52] that's what he was determined to do
[1:31:53] because that's what believers do they
[1:31:55] follow they follow him because sons of
[1:31:58] God are led by the spirit of God isn't
[1:31:59] that right so hey don't go somewhere me
[1:32:01] not go I want to go
[1:32:03] and Jesus said to him Hey listen don't
[1:32:05] follow me go back and tell your family
[1:32:07] and friends what happened to you and I
[1:32:09] believe the reason he said that was
[1:32:11] because the glory comes and following me
[1:32:13] comes after Calvary not before
[1:32:16] after Calvary after all of this is done
[1:32:19] then you can follow me and tell the
[1:32:21] world and go into all the world and
[1:32:22] preach the gospel but before the cross
[1:32:25] I've got to humble myself to all of this
[1:32:27] and die so there's no glory before the
[1:32:29] cross there's glory after the cross
[1:32:32] okay so stay here
[1:32:34] the other guy says all right if I have
[1:32:37] to I'll stay here so he says I'm going
[1:32:39] to go tell my father and so he goes back
[1:32:41] home and tells his father
[1:32:44] you can't have one side of this
[1:32:47] without the other side
[1:32:49] there's a place for deliverance
[1:32:52] there's a place for teaching
[1:32:56] there's a place for uh the supernatural
[1:32:59] phenomena
[1:33:01] but you know what it isn't just that
[1:33:04] and it isn't just teaching
[1:33:06] it's not this is not intellectualism
[1:33:10] this is not who's the smartest and can
[1:33:13] retain the most this is not what this is
[1:33:15] about this is about having a meeting
[1:33:17] with Jesus and learning all you can from
[1:33:20] Jesus
[1:33:21] does that make sense
[1:33:23] that's what I see in this Parable right
[1:33:25] here all right
[1:33:27] number three
[1:33:29] this is probably the most important
[1:33:30] thing I'm going to give you here
[1:33:33] Paul deals with this subject directly on
[1:33:35] and he says be careful for nothing in
[1:33:38] the Greek that language means the word
[1:33:41] careful means worry
[1:33:43] worry about nothing
[1:33:46] enough everybody say it nothing
[1:33:49] say it again nothing
[1:33:54] it's like sitting in a rocking chair and
[1:33:55] rocking all day you can work at it and
[1:33:57] put a lot of energy into it but you're
[1:33:59] not going to get anywhere
[1:34:02] he says be careful for nothing but and I
[1:34:06] love this this is what he says here's
[1:34:08] here's how we're going to do it instead
[1:34:09] of worrying and putting our energy into
[1:34:11] that we're going to do this in
[1:34:14] everything everybody say everything
[1:34:16] everything say it again everything by
[1:34:20] prayer
[1:34:21] by supplication
[1:34:23] supplication means asking
[1:34:27] and
[1:34:28] Thanksgiving
[1:34:30] see the three words there but by
[1:34:32] everything by prayer supplication and
[1:34:35] Thanksgiving let your requests be made
[1:34:37] known unto God
[1:34:38] so here's what you do when you have
[1:34:40] something that would cause ordinarily
[1:34:42] cause worry in your life then what you
[1:34:44] need to do is take that and by prayer
[1:34:46] and by asking God and asking God in the
[1:34:48] right way and with Thanksgiving let your
[1:34:50] requests be made known unto God you
[1:34:52] don't need to put it on Facebook you
[1:34:54] don't need to tell everybody about it
[1:34:55] bring it to God is that all right bring
[1:34:58] it to God and bring it to God in the
[1:34:59] right way with prayer supplication and
[1:35:01] don't forget the Thanksgiving
[1:35:04] and verse 7 and the peace of God which
[1:35:08] passes all understanding
[1:35:10] shall keep your hearts and Minds through
[1:35:13] Christ Jesus
[1:35:14] oh I love this verse it gets me excited
[1:35:17] the peace of God which passes all
[1:35:20] understanding shall keep that word keep
[1:35:23] there is a military term it is
[1:35:27] and it means to guard or Protect by a
[1:35:30] military guard either to prevent hostile
[1:35:32] Invasion or to keep the inhabitants in
[1:35:34] the city safe and to keep them from
[1:35:36] flight this is what this means here in
[1:35:39] other words when the peace of God moves
[1:35:42] in when you bring your request to God in
[1:35:43] the right way and you you the peace of
[1:35:45] God Moves In which is beyond our
[1:35:47] understanding because we really don't
[1:35:48] know how God's going to do this because
[1:35:50] we don't have an answer and we don't
[1:35:52] know anybody else who has an answer but
[1:35:53] somehow or another we believe God does
[1:35:55] have an answer and even though we don't
[1:35:56] understand it we're just going to trust
[1:35:58] that God does have an answer indeed but
[1:36:00] the peace of God is actually going to
[1:36:03] keep your heart it doesn't say that
[1:36:06] you're going to keep your heart and mind
[1:36:07] it doesn't say that the pastor is going
[1:36:09] to keep your heart and mind it doesn't
[1:36:10] even say that the whole church is going
[1:36:11] to Rally around you and keep your heart
[1:36:13] and mind God said I'll do this
[1:36:16] he said I'll keep your heart and mind
[1:36:18] and that military term there it means to
[1:36:20] build a Garrison it means to build a
[1:36:22] wall Protect by a military guard when
[1:36:25] the Cavalry moved out west in the old
[1:36:27] days you know what the first thing they
[1:36:29] did was when they're out in Indian
[1:36:30] Territory remember what they did they
[1:36:32] built a
[1:36:33] Fort a fort is a Garrison it is a
[1:36:36] defense against enemies that come in and
[1:36:39] it's against anybody wandering away and
[1:36:41] horses wandering away so we have
[1:36:43] protection when we have a fort I I want
[1:36:45] to reiterate again the holy spirit's not
[1:36:47] asking you to build a fort he's not
[1:36:50] asking you to defend yourself he's not
[1:36:52] asking you to build your defenses and
[1:36:53] make them really strong he's not asking
[1:36:55] you to build the best for it and then
[1:36:57] expand on it he's not doing that at all
[1:36:58] he said when you give it to me right
[1:37:00] I'll build a Ford I will surround you
[1:37:03] and I will keep your heart and mind
[1:37:05] through Christ Jesus
[1:37:08] he's making you that promise that he's
[1:37:10] going to do this
[1:37:12] wow
[1:37:14] in other words you kind of don't have to
[1:37:16] do anything that's right you don't have
[1:37:17] to do anything
[1:37:19] but don't forget the Thanksgiving
[1:37:21] you remember when Nehemiah was building
[1:37:23] the wall at the end of the book of
[1:37:25] Nehemiah it says and at the dedication
[1:37:27] of the wall of Jerusalem
[1:37:30] this is at the time now when it's all
[1:37:31] built the windows and doors are all in
[1:37:33] everything is set and they're going to
[1:37:34] dedicate that back to God this is what
[1:37:36] he does they sought the Levites out of
[1:37:39] all the places in Israel that's what it
[1:37:41] means all the places to bring them to
[1:37:43] Jerusalem to keep the dedication with
[1:37:45] gladness both with thanksgivings and
[1:37:48] seeings and singings
[1:37:50] with symbols sultries and harps verse 31
[1:37:52] and I brought up the princes of Judah
[1:37:54] upon the wall and appointed two great
[1:37:56] companies of them that give thanks one
[1:37:58] on the right hand side one on the
[1:38:00] left-hand side verse 40. so the two
[1:38:02] companies of them that gave thanks in
[1:38:04] the house of God and I and half of the
[1:38:06] rulers that were with me so in other
[1:38:07] words if we're going to have a
[1:38:08] dedication if we're going to have
[1:38:10] something related to walls we're going
[1:38:11] to have people that give thanks so he
[1:38:13] had all these two companies of Levites
[1:38:15] come in and they spread out along the
[1:38:17] wall and you know what they said thank
[1:38:20] you Lord for saving my soul
[1:38:23] and we give thanks and they they spent
[1:38:26] their whole time just thanking God thank
[1:38:28] you Lord for what you've done thank you
[1:38:30] for Nehemiah thank you for Ezra thank
[1:38:32] you Lord for restoring Jerusalem thank
[1:38:34] you Lord for setting us free from
[1:38:35] Babylon thank you for bringing us here
[1:38:38] and they just gave thanks gave thanks
[1:38:39] gave thanks that's all they did was just
[1:38:41] give thanks and Paul is saying and you
[1:38:44] need to take your requests make it known
[1:38:45] unto God with prayer supplication and
[1:38:49] Thanksgiving
[1:38:51] don't forget
[1:38:53] for Thanksgiving
[1:38:56] because
[1:38:57] if we understand it right
[1:38:59] Our God's already got an answer even
[1:39:01] before you go to them
[1:39:03] before you're able to mouth the prayers
[1:39:05] God's got an answer for you do you
[1:39:06] believe that and you ought to go to God
[1:39:08] and say Lord if thou not you should not
[1:39:11] go to God and say if thou can'tst
[1:39:13] you should say Lord
[1:39:15] I thank you for what you're going to do
[1:39:17] in this situation I don't know I'm not
[1:39:20] sure how you're going to get us out of
[1:39:21] this I'm not sure Lord how I could ever
[1:39:23] get back on the rails again
[1:39:25] but I'm thanking you because I know you
[1:39:27] can
[1:39:28] and I'm going to trust in you and I I'm
[1:39:30] going to put my my my whole trust in you
[1:39:34] Peter says we are kept by the power of
[1:39:36] God through faith under salvation ready
[1:39:38] to be revealed in the last day who are
[1:39:40] we kept by not your self-discipline
[1:39:43] not your perfect Stellar record
[1:39:47] not your works but we are kept by the
[1:39:49] power of God
[1:39:55] brother man I'm speaking to another lady
[1:39:57] he says now nervousness is a horrible
[1:39:58] thing keeps you torn up all the time
[1:40:01] because he said of course you were born
[1:40:03] nervous
[1:40:06] who are you going to blame in this case
[1:40:11] who do you want to lay the blame on for
[1:40:14] this sister
[1:40:15] it's born that way
[1:40:16] I'm just telling you what a prophet said
[1:40:19] how can we say to this sister you you
[1:40:21] probably are not born again because
[1:40:22] you're nervous you know what I Was Born
[1:40:25] This Way
[1:40:27] all your life you've been nervous I see
[1:40:30] you as a schoolgirl nervous and nothing
[1:40:32] can help it
[1:40:34] everybody says get next to yourself but
[1:40:36] that doesn't do any good
[1:40:38] and he said there's something that
[1:40:39] frightens you but Jesus Christ is here
[1:40:41] to take it away from you
[1:40:42] and any praise for her and he he asked
[1:40:45] God's Deliverance for her and then he
[1:40:47] says now I love what he says here he
[1:40:49] says now don't fear young lady
[1:40:51] do as I tell you will you do as I tell
[1:40:54] you now he says when you come up here
[1:40:55] there's a dark shadow around you but
[1:40:57] it's gone now you can't help that comes
[1:40:59] to you but look now that unclean
[1:41:02] spirit's gone from you
[1:41:03] and he walks in dry places
[1:41:06] he will try to return again
[1:41:09] but you just take my word as God's
[1:41:11] prophet
[1:41:12] don't you never here's here's what he
[1:41:14] says to her
[1:41:15] don't you never have a frown in your
[1:41:17] face
[1:41:18] sing all day long
[1:41:20] praise God and no matter what you no
[1:41:22] matter what you feel or what takes place
[1:41:25] it'll leave you
[1:41:27] and it won't come near you no more
[1:41:29] go and do that and believe with all your
[1:41:31] heart
[1:41:34] that's not complicated
[1:41:39] don't ever have a frown on your face
[1:41:41] sing all day praise God no matter how
[1:41:43] you feel what takes place and it'll
[1:41:45] leave you and it won't come no more
[1:41:48] you know what we need to do we need to
[1:41:49] spread our wings and Rise Up
[1:41:52] like bumblebees
[1:41:56] really
[1:42:00] you thought I was going to say Eagles
[1:42:02] all of you thought I was going to say
[1:42:03] Eagles I knew that I led you down the
[1:42:05] Garden Path I knew you thought I was
[1:42:07] going to say that
[1:42:09] where's Emma Emma can tell you the story
[1:42:11] here I did it in devotions and her
[1:42:13] online school
[1:42:15] it was an amazing
[1:42:18] physical truth about bumblebees I don't
[1:42:21] know if you're aware of it
[1:42:22] they can't fly
[1:42:25] aerodynamically their wings are way too
[1:42:27] small for their fat little bodies
[1:42:29] especially when they load up they load
[1:42:32] up with nectar they can't fly it is
[1:42:35] physically aerodynamically
[1:42:38] scientifically impossible for them to
[1:42:41] fly there are you can go online there
[1:42:43] are lots of studies that prove that
[1:42:45] bumblebees can't fly you can't flap fast
[1:42:48] enough you can flap often enough in
[1:42:50] order to to make a Bumblebee's body fly
[1:42:53] it they're just it's it doesn't work it
[1:42:56] just don't work
[1:42:57] I mean that's science and I'm not I'm
[1:42:59] not here to argue with that I mean
[1:43:01] that's true they've measured they've
[1:43:02] weighed they've done all the things they
[1:43:03] do they can't fly
[1:43:05] but you know what amazingly there's
[1:43:07] another thing about bumblebees that's
[1:43:09] really important here and that is that
[1:43:11] bumblebees can't read
[1:43:14] so they can't read the reports that are
[1:43:17] written about them that say they can fly
[1:43:18] so you know what they do they just go
[1:43:20] ahead and fly
[1:43:23] that's an amazing thing
[1:43:27] oh
[1:43:31] I mean it's a good read they could
[1:43:33] probably debate it right but they can't
[1:43:35] read so you know what all the reports in
[1:43:37] the world don't matter they just go
[1:43:38] ahead and do do what God made them to do
[1:43:40] they just spread their wings and fly and
[1:43:42] somehow or another it works don't let
[1:43:43] the devil tell you you can't fly don't
[1:43:46] let the devil tell you you can't lift
[1:43:47] off if you you just do what God tells
[1:43:50] you to do
[1:43:52] you just spread your wings and do what
[1:43:55] God told you to do God will get you
[1:43:58] there God knows exactly how to get you
[1:43:59] there
[1:44:00] don't worry about all the intellectuals
[1:44:02] that say well this is not going to
[1:44:03] happen that's not going to happen hey
[1:44:05] God knows exactly how to get you to
[1:44:07] where you need to be
[1:44:11] number four therefore I say unto you
[1:44:13] this is what Jesus said take no thought
[1:44:17] look at the birds of the air and look at
[1:44:19] they don't clothe themselves they don't
[1:44:20] feed themselves you know but but
[1:44:22] somebody's watching over them
[1:44:24] and they're only Birds
[1:44:27] and he said it's therefore I say unto
[1:44:28] you take no thought for your life
[1:44:30] and that word there means worry don't
[1:44:32] you fret about your life and what you
[1:44:34] shall eat and what you shall drink and
[1:44:36] not sure and and nor yet for your body
[1:44:38] what you shall put on is not the life
[1:44:40] more than the meat and the body the
[1:44:42] raiment behold the fowls of the air and
[1:44:43] so forth and are ye not much better than
[1:44:46] they which of You by taking thought can
[1:44:48] add one Cuba to a stature a cubitis from
[1:44:51] here this knuckle to your elbow
[1:44:53] and Jesus which one of you can go like
[1:44:55] and think hard enough and add yourself
[1:44:57] this much height some of you short
[1:44:59] people are saying I've tried some of you
[1:45:01] have tall people are saying I should
[1:45:03] have tried a little less
[1:45:05] but there's some in other words Jesus is
[1:45:07] saying there's some things you can't do
[1:45:10] and and when you come to those things
[1:45:11] you've got to leave them to God and and
[1:45:14] why take you thought for Raymond and
[1:45:15] consider the lilies of the field here he
[1:45:17] says you know what I'll tell you what in
[1:45:19] other words he's given us a great big
[1:45:21] good list of priorities here don't worry
[1:45:24] about this
[1:45:25] worry about this
[1:45:27] and you know what the thing he wants us
[1:45:29] to focus on
[1:45:31] seek first the kingdom of God and his
[1:45:33] righteousness
[1:45:34] and all these things will be added onto
[1:45:37] you put your energy into the right thing
[1:45:39] not the wrong thing don't don't take no
[1:45:42] thought for your life rather seek first
[1:45:45] the kingdom of God make that your
[1:45:46] priority make that the first thing and
[1:45:48] then you watch you watch what God does
[1:45:50] because it's not your business to worry
[1:45:53] about that's God's business when you
[1:45:54] give it to God and you drop your watch
[1:45:56] at the repair shop let me tell you it's
[1:45:58] God's business and he'll take care of it
[1:46:00] then and you really don't need to worry
[1:46:02] about it at all you need to be like the
[1:46:03] pilot who had the plane
[1:46:08] you still think I'm going towards Eagles
[1:46:10] don't you
[1:46:13] let me tell you a little story
[1:46:16] back in World War II
[1:46:19] the Germans kind of had the edge on the
[1:46:21] British for air defenses then they knew
[1:46:23] they both sides knew that air air power
[1:46:26] was going to tip the battle
[1:46:28] if you know anything about history this
[1:46:30] was a big big deal at the end of the war
[1:46:32] and the Germans were bombing London and
[1:46:36] all of the chaos and the death and the
[1:46:39] trouble that was caused by that it was a
[1:46:40] terrible thing and the British then put
[1:46:43] a lot of energy and money and time and
[1:46:45] brains into the development of certain
[1:46:48] planes that would be fast they could
[1:46:50] carry a pretty good sized payload they
[1:46:52] could get in get out quick and the
[1:46:54] pilots wouldn't have to ditch
[1:46:56] in the journey so they came up with this
[1:46:58] plane which was a very strategic piece
[1:47:01] of uh Machinery in the war is called a
[1:47:03] Spitfire
[1:47:05] and now they've developed other types of
[1:47:07] planes along this line and of course
[1:47:08] they have a more sophisticated type of
[1:47:11] plane now but this is a picture of a
[1:47:13] pilot who was doing a model or a uh a
[1:47:16] dry run of that plane they would make a
[1:47:18] prototype just the bare bones like
[1:47:22] steering wheel seat uh all the gears and
[1:47:26] pipes and fly-by-wire stuff everything
[1:47:28] was all exposed and and they would just
[1:47:31] bring it up and bring it down bring it
[1:47:32] up bring it down they wanted to see how
[1:47:34] it handled do we need more pitch more
[1:47:36] yaw more speed more height more oxygen
[1:47:40] whatever else and they test pilots who
[1:47:41] are crazy people they they were doing
[1:47:44] this with this plane this Pilot's up in
[1:47:46] the air and he's looking around at the
[1:47:49] plane he's sitting in his seat and he's
[1:47:51] looking around making sure everything's
[1:47:52] working okay that's his job he's looking
[1:47:54] around and watching the plane
[1:47:57] do you believe this story is going to
[1:47:59] make sense
[1:48:02] it's
[1:48:02] hang out hang on
[1:48:05] and the Pilots looking around he's
[1:48:07] flying away and he looks back and he
[1:48:08] sees
[1:48:10] a rat
[1:48:13] you didn't think I was going to say that
[1:48:15] he sees a wreck
[1:48:17] and the rat which is what rats do he's
[1:48:20] chewing on a cable
[1:48:22] the cable happens to be a hydraulic
[1:48:24] cable full of hydraulic fluid
[1:48:27] if the rat gets through the cable you
[1:48:29] know what's going to happen he's going
[1:48:31] to lose hydraulic fluid and he's not
[1:48:33] going to be able to steer the plane it's
[1:48:34] certain death for him
[1:48:37] and in an instant he's got to make a
[1:48:39] decision because he can't get out of the
[1:48:41] chair and go back and catch the rat the
[1:48:43] rat will run away and he'd be chasing
[1:48:45] the rat around the plane I mean he can't
[1:48:47] do that and he because he doesn't have
[1:48:50] autopilot on the plane so he's he sees
[1:48:52] the rat the rat is just you know very
[1:48:56] peacefully chewing on this
[1:48:58] pipe
[1:49:01] he's got to make a decision you know
[1:49:03] what he does this is a true story you
[1:49:05] know what he does he reaches over he
[1:49:07] takes his mask his oxygen mask and he
[1:49:09] puts it on and he takes the plane and he
[1:49:11] goes like this he goes High
[1:49:14] as he goes High the oxygen Thins
[1:49:19] he's looking back at the rat he's going
[1:49:21] straight up and the plane is not made to
[1:49:24] do that as far as he knows but he's
[1:49:26] going straight up it's getting colder
[1:49:28] and colder the oxygen is Getting Thinner
[1:49:30] and thinner and he looks back at that
[1:49:31] rat and he just goes
[1:49:34] foreign
[1:49:39] he had to make that decision fast
[1:49:43] what I'm telling you tonight is that
[1:49:46] when you get into a spot
[1:49:48] go high don't go low
[1:49:51] Gohan
[1:49:58] don't you worry about coming down here
[1:50:00] and trying to figure everything out and
[1:50:01] all that hey there are times when you
[1:50:03] don't have any other choice but to go
[1:50:05] high go high go quickly keep going until
[1:50:08] you reach that place where God actually
[1:50:11] does something
[1:50:12] there are many times we get into trouble
[1:50:14] because we're going low because we're
[1:50:16] not at the right place God wants us to
[1:50:18] be and when you find yourself in a spot
[1:50:20] like that don't think about it just go
[1:50:22] high go to God go to him and reach out
[1:50:24] to him and and and give that request to
[1:50:27] him with Thanksgiving and say Lord I'm
[1:50:29] coming to you you are my only hope you
[1:50:31] are my refuge and my strength here and
[1:50:33] I'm going to come to you
[1:50:35] [Applause]
[1:50:36] come to him and watch what he does come
[1:50:38] to him and throw your trust throw all of
[1:50:41] your cares upon him because he cares for
[1:50:43] you
[1:50:44] he was wounded for our transgressions
[1:50:47] and he was bruised for our iniquity and
[1:50:49] the chastisement of our peace is upon
[1:50:51] him by stripes we are healed
[1:50:56] amen how many believe this that he heals
[1:50:58] the Brokenhearted
[1:51:00] and he binds up their wounds their
[1:51:02] wounds are not physical their wounds are
[1:51:03] not stitchable their wounds are not
[1:51:05] removable like a doctor will take out
[1:51:07] bad tissue but somebody with a broken
[1:51:09] heart
[1:51:10] still needs healing
[1:51:13] somebody who has been betrayed somebody
[1:51:15] who has been mischaracterized and
[1:51:17] criticized let me tell you they know
[1:51:19] what a broken heart feels like some of
[1:51:21] you are not not all of you but some of
[1:51:23] you are not in your head because maybe
[1:51:24] you've experienced that I'm here to tell
[1:51:26] you tonight you're not alone if you have
[1:51:27] a broken heart God knows how to heal a
[1:51:29] broken heart
[1:51:33] and you need to understand and remember
[1:51:36] that you are not alone
[1:51:40] Somebody's Watching Over You
[1:51:42] somebody cares about you
[1:51:46] so does Delta Airlines
[1:51:50] I'm really throwing you guys for a loop
[1:51:52] here you didn't think I was going to say
[1:51:54] that
[1:51:57] appreciate your honesty
[1:52:01] I can always trust a man with a bow tie
[1:52:03] foreign
[1:52:08] let me tell you the story because
[1:52:10] sometimes you think you know you're all
[1:52:12] alone sometimes you think you're on your
[1:52:13] own and I mean those feelings very often
[1:52:16] are very real
[1:52:19] sometimes there are things that they
[1:52:21] happen not because you caused it but
[1:52:23] it's just that's where you are I feel
[1:52:25] like nobody cares
[1:52:27] I remember one time my wife and I were
[1:52:29] flying on Delta Airlines Delta Airlines
[1:52:31] treats me pretty good
[1:52:33] now I treat Delta Airlines pretty good
[1:52:35] too
[1:52:37] but they look after me and and uh I fly
[1:52:41] a lot with them and have Bunches of
[1:52:42] miles with them and and uh you know they
[1:52:46] uh they give me the the upgrades and the
[1:52:51] status and that kind of thing and I mean
[1:52:52] they just give it to me because I fly a
[1:52:54] lot and I do a lot of work in different
[1:52:55] parts of the world and I'm thankful for
[1:52:58] that you know because they've uh they've
[1:53:00] been been a help lots of times in tough
[1:53:03] situations and I appreciate that
[1:53:05] one day my wife and I were flying we're
[1:53:07] going somewhere we're going from Roanoke
[1:53:08] to Atlanta and then Atlanta overseas
[1:53:11] and uh we we knew we had a tight
[1:53:14] connection
[1:53:15] and uh all of a sudden someone sometimes
[1:53:18] the worst words you can hear on a plane
[1:53:20] are well folks
[1:53:22] when the pilot comes on and he says well
[1:53:24] folks
[1:53:27] he says we got a delay delays in Atlanta
[1:53:29] it's not here he says we got a problem
[1:53:31] and he says it's going to make us run
[1:53:32] kind of tight and he says but we're
[1:53:35] going to take off sins they give us
[1:53:36] clearance so just hang on and the time
[1:53:39] is clicking ticking ticking ticking and
[1:53:41] I'm looking at this and saying oh man
[1:53:44] we've got to make that connection
[1:53:45] because we're gonna be we're not going
[1:53:46] to make it overseas and the meetings and
[1:53:48] all the other things that were going to
[1:53:49] happen right you know it's all if you're
[1:53:51] late on the first one it's pretty bad if
[1:53:53] you're late on the last one is a
[1:53:54] different thing but if you're late in
[1:53:55] the first one it's a bad thing because
[1:53:56] everything's effective it's like it's
[1:53:57] called dominoes
[1:53:59] and so we're we're I'm looking at this
[1:54:01] I'm looking at my app and I'm seeing
[1:54:03] because normally when you're going to be
[1:54:05] late they say they come on the app in
[1:54:07] you know on themselves and they say we
[1:54:10] know Mr Coffee you're going to be
[1:54:11] delayed they'll they'll do that they'll
[1:54:13] say we know you're going to be delayed
[1:54:14] we have you booked on another flight
[1:54:16] don't worry when you get to the airport
[1:54:17] go to this gate instead of that gate
[1:54:19] they'll tell me that on my app is neat
[1:54:23] and I don't have to call them when you
[1:54:25] know fuss and complain I just they'll do
[1:54:27] that that's automatic so nothing shows
[1:54:29] up on my app
[1:54:31] nothing
[1:54:33] so we're late by the time we get to
[1:54:36] Atlanta and we touch down
[1:54:39] we have physically
[1:54:42] two or three minutes to make this
[1:54:44] connection okay
[1:54:46] they ain't no way
[1:54:48] ain't no way
[1:54:50] my wife says to me hey we can't run I
[1:54:52] said well
[1:54:53] even if we did
[1:54:57] even if we did run honey
[1:54:59] we got to take a train we got to go to
[1:55:01] another terminal there's six different
[1:55:03] stops on the train in Atlanta so you
[1:55:05] know uh there ain't no way there ain't
[1:55:08] no way
[1:55:10] and nothing's showing up on my app I
[1:55:13] told the stewardess I said hey
[1:55:15] uh we got a really super tight
[1:55:17] connection and she said well you can get
[1:55:19] off the plane first you know to try to
[1:55:20] do it I said but we only got two or
[1:55:22] three minutes we ain't gonna be able to
[1:55:23] do it
[1:55:25] and she said well the only thing I know
[1:55:27] to do is just go for it
[1:55:28] foreign
[1:55:31] now I'm a Type A okay
[1:55:35] what's so funny about that
[1:55:38] you relate you're a type A you're a type
[1:55:40] A plus that's what you are
[1:55:42] and a type a means that I almost quit
[1:55:45] school in grade two because they took
[1:55:46] recess you know I mean I I'm just I'm a
[1:55:48] busy guy I got lots to do and uh you
[1:55:50] know you can relate to this and so I'm I
[1:55:53] got my hands on my bags I got my hand
[1:55:55] one hand on my bag one hand on my wife
[1:55:57] and I'm saying all right honey when they
[1:55:58] open that door we're gone
[1:56:00] you just close your eyes and start to
[1:56:02] pray you pray I'll run I'll drag you
[1:56:05] through the airport now I'm I'm cocked
[1:56:07] and ready I mean I'm
[1:56:09] I don't want to I hate missing flights
[1:56:10] and I so I'm just you know
[1:56:16] there wasn't nobody in front of me there
[1:56:18] ain't nobody in front of me because I I
[1:56:20] work my way to the right by that door
[1:56:23] but a bill you've traveled you know how
[1:56:25] that is and you're
[1:56:26] out of my way
[1:56:30] and I go through the door she opens up
[1:56:32] that door gone like this and I'm I'm out
[1:56:35] in the uh on the gangway and I'm walking
[1:56:37] we're turning the corner to go up the
[1:56:39] Chute and go up to the main terminal
[1:56:41] there and there's a woman standing there
[1:56:44] she's a stately woman
[1:56:47] she's got

[2:26:34] Hallelujah
[2:26:36] amen how many just testify and say Lord
[2:26:40] you spoke to my heart tonight
[2:26:43] Hallelujah
[2:26:46] oh my if there's one thing for sure that
[2:26:49] you know even after we we depart from
[2:26:52] this this building tonight the presence
[2:26:54] from one another I want you to know
[2:26:58] that he's not left you
[2:27:02] tomorrow morning you might not feel the
[2:27:05] same way but your feeling has nothing to
[2:27:07] do with what God has spoke to you and
[2:27:11] what he's done in your life right here I
[2:27:14] tell you
[2:27:15] not only did God come and minister to
[2:27:19] the needs in our lives and show us just
[2:27:22] how much he cared just a little softer
[2:27:23] brother just a little softer just how
[2:27:25] much that he cares
[2:27:28] about every single need
[2:27:30] in our lives
[2:27:32] that to me is
[2:27:34] when I consider the expanse of this
[2:27:36] message
[2:27:37] and how that God
[2:27:40] took time and it wasn't that those were
[2:27:43] insignificant things I personally
[2:27:45] believe
[2:27:47] that God had those things recorded for
[2:27:51] you and I
[2:27:53] to know that we would stand here tonight
[2:27:55] and we would need to be reminded and to
[2:27:58] hear those things
[2:28:00] God came down not only in the ministry
[2:28:02] of the Prophet but as he came right here
[2:28:05] tonight and let that be known God is not
[2:28:08] a God who runs down his people
[2:28:13] that's not what that's not what he comes
[2:28:15] to do we're under a quickening power it
[2:28:18] comes to lift us it comes to Lift Us
[2:28:22] and I tell you I
[2:28:25] how much that God cares about us and I
[2:28:28] say for you as young people God knew you
[2:28:30] was going to be here even in this age
[2:28:32] God knew all the pressures all the
[2:28:33] situations and I think it's I think it's
[2:28:36] very fitting
[2:28:37] to understand
[2:28:39] that don't let the devil isolate you
[2:28:41] ever put you in a corner of well I felt
[2:28:43] this way I should have never felt this
[2:28:44] way God made that so clear tonight
[2:28:48] just like that door was open before we
[2:28:51] just dismissed the devil because that's
[2:28:52] not true
[2:28:54] we're still here we're in this flesh we
[2:28:57] walk but the thing that's different
[2:28:58] right now is you've been equipped
[2:29:00] tonight you've been equipped
[2:29:03] you've been equipped on all of those
[2:29:06] things and what to do even as we leave
[2:29:09] from this place tonight
[2:29:11] and listen
[2:29:12] [Music]
[2:29:14] I don't believe that shamgar thought
[2:29:17] how is this oxco going to do this I
[2:29:19] don't believe that I don't believe that
[2:29:22] Samson thought how is this Jawbone going
[2:29:24] to do this he didn't think it
[2:29:26] inspiration struck and he picked it up
[2:29:28] and he used it God has showed you
[2:29:31] tonight all of us tonight the ox code
[2:29:33] the Jawbone of the ass he showed us and
[2:29:36] we can take that and pick it up under
[2:29:38] the authority
[2:29:39] [Music]
[2:29:40] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:29:43] and you're his child
[2:29:45] cares about you
[2:29:47] won't you loving tonight
