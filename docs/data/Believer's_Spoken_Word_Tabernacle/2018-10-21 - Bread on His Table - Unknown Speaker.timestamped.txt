[37:15] praise the Lord God bless you good to
[37:17] see each one today we just appreciate
[37:19] always being here with the Saints of
[37:21] like precious faith and just always
[37:23] warms our hearts to be with you all and
[37:25] we just appreciate the grace of God with
[37:28] your pastor in the church here and we
[37:31] just pray the Lord continue to
[37:32] strengthen and establish and sell you
[37:34] and and everything in Christ Jesus amen
[37:36] if you have your Bibles this morning we
[37:38] look at the Book of Joshua and in the
[37:41] fifth chapter here and we just pray the
[37:44] Lord have his way I pray something would
[37:46] be said that might be a blessing of
[37:49] course to his children that's why we
[37:51] come here amen well that's why I can't
[37:54] praise the Lord I don't know why the
[37:56] devil came he likes to come around
[37:57] Church too for some reason but he always
[37:59] seemed to get beat up when he comes to
[38:00] church I think he learned his lesson
[38:02] you know people come here with trials
[38:04] and struggles and things it's like man
[38:06] why the devil even show up man you know
[38:08] we just know what's gonna happen to him
[38:10] hey man you believe that I can even awe
[38:13] somebody there's somebody somebody's got
[38:15] something they need overcome today is
[38:16] that right we were called to become over
[38:18] comers I believe we're over comers today
[38:20] but I believe this is the place amen in
[38:22] Christ Jesus we can have overcoming Josh
[38:25] for the fifth chapter of course Joshua's
[38:27] just brought the children Israel from
[38:28] Egypt into the Promised Land here and
[38:30] they've been recirc amazed according to
[38:33] the commandment of God that He gave
[38:36] originally to Abraham and that's coming
[38:38] down here the ninth verse this morning
[38:39] in Joshua chapter 5 the Bible says this
[38:42] and the Lord said unto Joshua this day
[38:45] have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt
[38:48] from off you wherefore the name of the
[38:51] place is called Gilgal unto this day of
[38:53] course the name gilga means a rolling
[38:55] back or a rolling away so there is a
[38:56] reproach that was on them when they come
[38:59] out of Egypt but I want you to that
[39:01] reproach and this promised land has
[39:02] rolled away there's no more reproach or
[39:04] shame being identified with the children
[39:07] of Israel a man the reproach they had
[39:09] the uncircumcised was taken away at this
[39:12] place a man
[39:13] so back here in the tenth verse and the
[39:16] children of Israel encamped in Gilgal
[39:18] and kept the Passover on the fourteenth
[39:21] day of the month even in the plains of
[39:24] Jericho verse 11 they did eat of the old
[39:27] corn of the land on the morrow after the
[39:29] Passover unleavened cakes in parched
[39:32] corn in the self-same day and the manna
[39:34] ceased on the morrow after they had
[39:36] eaten of the old corn of the land
[39:38] neither had the children of Israel manna
[39:40] anymore but they did eat of the fruit of
[39:42] the land of Canaan that year let's just
[39:44] bow our heads for a word of prayer this
[39:46] morning
[39:46] gracious Heavenly Father we are so
[39:49] grateful to be here as I was already
[39:51] just testifying with this group of
[39:54] people that are your children your
[39:55] beloved bride father what a what a
[39:58] privilege Lord to stand before them on I
[40:01] think of the prophets of old how many
[40:03] times they would stand in the face of
[40:04] those that did not believe the word of
[40:06] the Lord had come and they were
[40:07] persecuted and afflicted and and caught
[40:10] all manner of evil things falsely for
[40:12] your name's sake and Lord even unto this
[40:14] day with your children with us as
[40:16] believers it happens but I'm thankful
[40:18] for a place like this we can gather
[40:21] together and there's an agreeable spirit
[40:23] with the things of God that your
[40:25] children could worship under the shed
[40:26] blood of Jesus Christ in the unity of
[40:29] the spirit Lord on a man-made unity or a
[40:32] program but something that you have you
[40:34] have given to us by your grace that we
[40:37] could be knit together and loved knowing
[40:39] that every joint would supply father I
[40:41] pray now you'd anoint not just me as a
[40:43] minister but your children the people
[40:45] that have gathered here to give them
[40:47] eyes to see and ears to hear and hearts
[40:50] to receive that what you have for them
[40:52] follow me all darkness and sickness and
[40:55] affliction and all the powers of the
[40:57] King of Hell may they be broken all
[40:59] right now in this place for I believe
[41:01] the anointing still breaks every yoke I
[41:03] believe the power that is still greater
[41:05] than the power of Satan I believe you've
[41:07] not changed but you were the same and
[41:09] you've given us victory in power and
[41:11] dominion over the powers of darkness and
[41:14] over over every enemy and today Lord
[41:17] every footstep that we can take my faith
[41:19] in this promised land is a possession to
[41:22] us that you've given to your children
[41:25] heritance maybe great glorying on an
[41:27] hour miss father may be pleased to move
[41:29] in to dwell in our mets probably give
[41:31] you the praising glory for it we commit
[41:33] this service our hearts our lives
[41:35] everything that is said and done now
[41:37] into your loving hands is a loving and
[41:39] faithful creator and we ask these things
[41:41] in the mighty name our Lord and Savior
[41:43] Jesus Christ
[41:44] and the bride said Amen god bless you
[41:47] seated today taking a thought here this
[41:49] morning Bread on his table might not
[41:52] sound like it ties in the scripture
[41:53] directly but I'll bring it around here
[41:55] by the grace of God in just a few
[41:56] minutes I won't talk about bread on his
[41:57] table amen you'll notice that after the
[41:59] past I'll really begin to take the
[42:01] corner of the land on the self-same day
[42:02] and they begin to eat of the old corner
[42:04] of the land so we look at this the
[42:06] children visitor they've taken their
[42:07] flight from the land of Egypt and their
[42:09] Exodus in the wilderness and I want you
[42:11] to consider that for the space of 40
[42:13] years God had supernaturally sustained
[42:15] this people he give them a smitten Rock
[42:18] in the wilderness and it wasn't just a
[42:20] little I love I'll but the bread talks
[42:21] about that you get that artist he
[42:22] painting that and you got the little
[42:24] sprinkler coming out there he forgot
[42:25] that I don't know put the hose away for
[42:26] the winter and he's got this little
[42:27] thing just leaking off there but he said
[42:29] no it was a great big gush it was enough
[42:31] to water two million men besides their
[42:33] women and children and all their their
[42:34] cattle and everything else they had with
[42:36] them and so they had a smitten rock that
[42:38] provided for man and man that fell in
[42:40] quail and God had done all these things
[42:41] you know when one of them got sick
[42:43] brother band said that Moses had a chest
[42:45] that he could go to doctor Moses he said
[42:48] let's look in this chest what's in there
[42:49] he said maybe there's some pot Lissa's
[42:51] or some medicine I don't you know maybe
[42:52] people were some sort of a Tylenol or
[42:54] something like that but he said he only
[42:56] had one thing in that chest I'm the Lord
[42:58] that healeth thee
[42:59] he said that was all Moses had and that
[43:01] was all they needed and really that's
[43:03] all we need today I'm the Lord that
[43:05] healeth thee amen
[43:06] he said I give you all your diseases I
[43:08] believe that word all means all without
[43:10] exception praise the Lord I believe he's
[43:12] still a healer today you think even
[43:14] their shoes that they wore didn't wear
[43:16] out by the space of 40 years of tales
[43:19] that'd be nice hey man I go through
[43:20] she's all the time Amen well it's true
[43:23] retired there's something else our tires
[43:24] would be even better well that's the
[43:26] whole sermon there hey man but for the
[43:28] space of 40 years they travel and even
[43:30] the shoes that were out in their clothes
[43:31] and so worth it's incredible to think
[43:33] about the grace of God that was
[43:35] sustained
[43:36] naturally speaking in this environment
[43:38] for 40 years and for 40 years straight
[43:40] God was faithful every day there's water
[43:43] every day
[43:44] yeah except of course the man is fall in
[43:46] six days and you gather twice as much on
[43:48] the seventh day but listen you could you
[43:50] can set your clock by the program of God
[43:53] God never missed today God never said oh
[43:56] I don't have enough water for the day
[43:57] you have to come back next week we've
[43:59] got a rash in this we're gonna be
[44:01] careful with this you could gather as
[44:03] much as you needed you'd have none left
[44:04] over if you gather sparingly you had
[44:06] enough God provided for them
[44:08] supernaturally and I think about what a
[44:11] great thing it was and what I want you
[44:12] to understand today is as great as that
[44:15] was it's just a means to an end
[44:17] hey man now we'll just have follow where
[44:20] I'm going with this God was doing all
[44:21] these things supernaturally we can look
[44:23] at what God has done through the Bible
[44:25] and through church changes and what God
[44:26] has done we can look at the miracles and
[44:28] the martyrdoms and the things that God
[44:30] has done and we think God for them but I
[44:32] want you to understand there are means
[44:33] to an end God was trying to bring them
[44:35] somewhere God wouldn't want to just
[44:37] leave them in the wilderness and provide
[44:39] for them that way he wanted to give them
[44:41] something better so God says this is
[44:44] great what I've done here but what I'm
[44:45] taking is something better than that
[44:47] it's great to know that you have a hope
[44:50] of life after death but I'm gonna take
[44:51] you to a body change I'm gonna take you
[44:53] to full adoption I'm gonna take you to a
[44:55] place where all the promises are
[44:57] possible all the promises are you a man
[45:00] Oh hallelujah somebody God was taking
[45:03] them to a goal the goal was not the man
[45:04] in the wilderness now for some of them
[45:06] that's as far as they went and they died
[45:09] in the world is having the blessing of
[45:10] God woman having these things yet they
[45:12] died in the waters but things out
[45:14] another generation rose up and God said
[45:17] this is a people that are gonna go into
[45:18] the land when another generation
[45:20] forsaken the blessings of God there's
[45:22] two people I think not for a Joshua the
[45:24] Moses the Bible said or Joshua and Caleb
[45:26] rather the Bible said they had a
[45:28] different spirit about them and God
[45:30] would take them in another Joshua
[45:31] commissioned into the promised land that
[45:34] was the goal of God was to take them not
[45:36] just into the land but to position them
[45:39] in a dwelling in the land
[45:41] listen esagrill the ministry of
[45:43] of the gospel of Jesus Christ it's not
[45:46] just a bless you but it's to take you
[45:48] somewhere where there's rest
[45:50] now listen Joshua gave them a rest but
[45:54] the Bible tells us in Hebrews that was
[45:55] not the rest of God that he wanted to
[45:57] give his people there remained a rest I
[45:59] believe it's what we have today and the
[46:01] Holy Ghost God has given a rest to his
[46:04] people place we don't don't worry about
[46:06] I'm not gonna make it I can't survive
[46:08] can I be a Christian in the darkness of
[46:11] land is here when people are falling
[46:13] away and they've got their eyes on every
[46:15] kind of distraction and every kind of
[46:17] vice and sin yet for the Christian there
[46:20] is rest but Christians don't have to
[46:22] fuss and fight with his brother and
[46:24] sister just to make in the kingdom I
[46:26] know some people out there dot every I
[46:28] and cross every teen if you don't see it
[46:30] that way then draw your right out of the
[46:31] circle but I praise God for a message
[46:33] that draws you right back in says you
[46:36] know I can love you you can be my
[46:37] brother my sister anyway hallelujah I'm
[46:40] not worried about it I don't have to
[46:41] make it I've already made it in Christ
[46:47] you look at brother Brandon preaching
[46:49] them out of this when they enter in the
[46:50] promise and he talks about earlier in
[46:52] the message many times he types it as
[46:53] the Millennium he talks about it being
[46:55] the Millennium but later when he comes
[46:56] around and preaches adoptions of course
[46:58] he makes the point this could not be a
[46:59] type of the millennium cuz there's so
[47:01] Wars and Fighting's there is this the
[47:04] type of the Holy Ghost a man
[47:06] he says ours is not a holy land but the
[47:08] Holy Ghost amen amen
[47:13] what does it make the change because
[47:14] there's a battle being fought in the
[47:16] land a man listen is a Christian you've
[47:18] still got battles ifs about trials but
[47:21] the difference is now you've got victory
[47:23] to go ahead once you used to live in
[47:25] defeat and heartache and distress and
[47:28] worry now you have a victory
[47:30] you didn't win on your own but God give
[47:33] me the land
[47:35] hallelujah somebody but I've been
[47:37] talking about this in paradox division
[47:39] he sees he says it's about three o'clock
[47:41] in the morning I suppose that I've
[47:42] gotten up and looked at where in front
[47:44] me I was coming down to the Jordan
[47:46] looked like it was standing on the map
[47:47] of Palestine you're probably familiar
[47:49] with this he says I was coming down to
[47:51] Jordan it seemed like I could hear the
[47:53] song I'm going down to Jordan something
[47:55] was singing it
[47:56] and then I drew near the river I look
[47:57] back and see what your way I had come it
[48:00] was two-thirds of the way there to the
[48:02] Jordan he says and I looked across durin
[48:05] said oh praise God just on the other
[48:07] side is where all the promises lay every
[48:12] promise lays where he says in the
[48:13] promised land now I want to ask you
[48:15] where does every promise lay for the
[48:17] Christian well the Bible tell you the
[48:19] second Corinthians the 1st chapter all
[48:20] the promises of God there yay
[48:22] and there Amen we're in Christ listen
[48:26] there yes look God's not making
[48:28] decisions about his promises today for
[48:30] those that are in Christ I hope somebody
[48:32] gets that today hey man he's already
[48:34] said yes and he's already say day man
[48:37] his own promises if you're in Christ
[48:39] I've ever talked about this but I give
[48:42] these credit card offers all the time
[48:43] the mail they're usually junk and then
[48:45] they said you've been pre-approved for
[48:46] $8,000 credible I'm the $8,000 credit
[48:49] that be all right I don't know who they
[48:51] pre-approval musta got the wrong mailbox
[48:52] but they'll tell you them pre-approved
[48:54] for a certain amount of credits Emma
[48:56] listen you've been pre-approved for the
[48:58] kingdom of God and then gums
[49:01] pre-approved you said I've made promises
[49:03] I've laid out divine promises and divine
[49:06] fats whereby you might be a partaker of
[49:08] the divine nature and if you are in
[49:11] Christ he has already said yes and they
[49:14] learn to every promise in this Bible
[49:16] listen that's why you can sing every
[49:19] promise in the book is mine
[49:20] not because you were smart enough not
[49:23] because you lived all right not because
[49:24] you come from the right kind of a family
[49:26] but because you're in Christ we're all
[49:28] the promises way well helping out
[49:31] somebody if all the promises are there
[49:34] then what are you worried about what are
[49:35] you fussing about honey man you've
[49:37] already had victory over your enemy
[49:40] listen everything you have need of amen
[49:42] brother Brent says everything that need
[49:43] of for your earthly journey is in you
[49:46] right now if you have the Holy Ghost he
[49:47] says even the rapture listen that means
[49:51] what I really need today listen it's not
[49:53] about me or some other man you can draw
[49:56] from the breasts in one oh sorry all
[49:58] right now
[49:59] the word of faith it's 9u it's in your
[50:02] mouth
[50:03] it's in your heart if you can speak to
[50:05] your rock you can have what you need oh
[50:09] yeah listen I think it's important to
[50:14] know where we're at today listen it
[50:16] would be presumptuous to say that ever
[50:18] promised in the book is mine unless you
[50:20] knew where you were act and then listen
[50:22] if you're in the wilderness it doesn't
[50:24] belong to you but if you're in the
[50:26] promise if you're in Christ if you're a
[50:29] part of that scene of Abraham who is
[50:31] Christ every promise in the book is mine
[50:36] levan says it's the adoption messages
[50:38] watch how he addresses this time I
[50:41] pawned book of Ephesians he says this is
[50:43] not to the unbelievers this is to the
[50:45] church
[50:46] it's called to the called out ones the
[50:48] sanctified and call out that are in
[50:50] Christ Jesus now you want to know how we
[50:53] get him to Christ Jesus is if you turn
[50:55] the first Corinthians 12 itself or by
[50:56] one spirits
[50:57] we're all baptized into one body how
[51:00] baptized by the Holy Ghost not water
[51:03] baptism uses you Church of Christ people
[51:05] but by one Capital spirit by one spirit
[51:08] not by one handshake not my one letter
[51:11] but or by one spring but by one spirit
[51:14] we've all been baptized into one body
[51:16] our possession let me see my possession
[51:21] our possession and then the land that
[51:25] God gave us to live in the Holy Ghost
[51:28] just to get Canaan to the Jews he gave
[51:31] us the Holy Spirit by one spirit all
[51:34] baptized into one body sister you get it
[51:36] and he's talking to the spiritual
[51:38] Canaanites Israel the spiritual Israel
[51:41] who has possessed the land he says
[51:46] aren't you glad you've come out of Egypt
[51:47] garlic I'm glad I don't smell like Egypt
[51:49] anymore him and I used to look like in
[51:51] the world talk like the world act like
[51:53] the world but God brought me out
[51:55] thank God some people still wanna listen
[51:57] something will still go back to Egypt
[51:59] that's what they did in the wilderness
[52:00] their hearts never left they physically
[52:03] left but their hearts never left
[52:05] he's if they wanted to go back over
[52:06] there enough graves in Egypt for us to
[52:09] me Barry that's all I can think about
[52:10] was dying because that's all I had to
[52:12] look forward to because people got a
[52:15] possession somewhere we don't look like
[52:17] death we don't talk like death we're
[52:19] carriers of life we ought to be caring
[52:24] about and brag but by death all the time
[52:26] we've got resurrection we've got a
[52:29] possession he said aren't you glad
[52:32] you're out of the wilderness well I am
[52:34] yeah I know some people are still no
[52:36] bonus that's all I preach to a man
[52:38] waiting for God well tell you what
[52:40] looked like the prophets end the third
[52:42] axis that when they were in the Loess
[52:43] they were waiting on God brother Bram
[52:46] said and God was waiting on them
[52:48] notice the mindset of them in the limits
[52:50] they're waiting for God to do something
[52:52] and miss it God is waiting on them I
[52:55] believe a movers on for the bride
[52:57] that's thus saith the Lord we've had a
[53:00] Moses we've had a Joshua Commission tell
[53:02] us don't linger over here in the
[53:04] wilderness go and take the land but God
[53:08] wants his people to dispossessed every
[53:10] inhabitant of spiritual Kingdom every
[53:13] devil and every Prince of pine every
[53:15] power is under your feet and the God of
[53:19] peace shall put Satan under your feet
[53:23] listen he ordained your feet to do it a
[53:28] man no I tell you what my feet I walk
[53:31] around every now and then I get sore
[53:32] feet and I rub my feet and I think man
[53:34] it's it's so hard to walk but just think
[53:36] these same feet that I suffer with today
[53:39] they're gonna be changed one day they
[53:40] sent feet right now have power and
[53:44] they're not the physical body but every
[53:46] footstep as a possession you say what do
[53:49] you mean by that
[53:50] listen every footstep you might not
[53:53] think this is some great thing today say
[53:54] we're just gonna have another church
[53:55] service we're just gonna get together
[53:57] once again you shown up today it's
[54:00] supernatural
[54:00] you believe in God one more day is
[54:03] supernatural because the supernatural
[54:05] God lives inside the supernatural people
[54:08] and they're very footsteps they're
[54:10] ordered up the Lord the fish stuff for
[54:14] normal body you might look normal to the
[54:16] world but there's nothing normal about
[54:18] him now some of us already look less
[54:21] normal than the others people probably
[54:24] wouldn't say I'm normal
[54:25] that's alright you know it's the nuts
[54:27] that hold all the young together they
[54:28] say hi Alysa there's something different
[54:31] about you you've been ordained to take a
[54:33] land hey man he says this aren't you
[54:38] glad you're how the lunar so remember
[54:39] they had to eat manna angels food out of
[54:42] heaven until they crossed over the land
[54:44] and when they crossed over the land the
[54:45] manna ceased to fall they were fully
[54:49] matured than and they eat the old corn
[54:51] of the land's out now you're not babies
[54:54] anymore
[54:55] well hallelujah that's the truth you
[54:59] know you're not designed to sincere milk
[55:01] of the gospel you don't be babied and
[55:03] padded and persuaded to come to church
[55:05] you know it amuses me how you preach the
[55:11] fire you preach about church attends to
[55:12] people that show up to church it wasn't
[55:14] even here the ones that aren't there you
[55:17] know I'm saying like you show up on a
[55:19] mid-weight guy man we need to show up to
[55:20] church more and the people say Amen that
[55:22] showed up a man but that's mature
[55:26] Christians you don't have to pick you
[55:27] don't have to tell him to pray you don't
[55:29] have to tell them to read the Bible you
[55:31] left on the serve God you ain't got a
[55:32] Pamela bat and force them through a pop
[55:34] I know some people rollercoaster
[55:36] Christians and you've always got to make
[55:37] them do everything God don't want us to
[55:39] be that way that wants just to show up
[55:42] and grow up and do a job because we're
[55:44] something wrong you guys listen we've
[55:47] got we've got a tuner over us and what
[55:49] kind of report does he have about our
[55:51] lives this morning is he saying my my
[55:54] daughter my son's been faithful they've
[55:56] kept the word of promise they've held
[55:57] fast to their confession they're walking
[56:00] in the promised land or is he got
[56:02] sagging a baby him I got trimmed the
[56:04] same way they got the same hang-ups I
[56:05] did 30 years ago
[56:06] they haven't overcome the same thing
[56:08] they didn't walk around the same
[56:09] mountain for 40 years
[56:10] what kind of a testament is God how
[56:13] about us this morning
[56:15] well holiday yes truth any haha he says
[56:18] you're not for persuading to come to
[56:19] church now that you're really fully
[56:21] matured Christians you're ready strong
[56:23] meats now you're ready to come into
[56:25] something he said you're ready to
[56:27] understand something that's deep in a
[56:29] rich he says we'll get into it directly
[56:31] he says it's been hidden since the
[56:33] foundation of the world he said now
[56:36] you've come into this I'm addressing
[56:37] this he says to you not to those who've
[56:40] just left Egypt not to those who are
[56:42] still in the journey but to those who
[56:44] are in the promised land that has
[56:47] received the promise and he asked the
[56:50] question how many's received the promise
[56:52] of the Holy Ghost he says aren't you
[56:55] glad you're in the land now how eating
[56:57] the old corn eating the strong things of
[56:59] God and you've got a clearer
[57:01] understanding your spiritual Minds own
[57:04] unmodeled up he said you know exactly
[57:07] who he is you know exactly what he is
[57:09] you know exactly where you're going you
[57:12] know exactly all about it you're know in
[57:15] the whom you have believed and persuaded
[57:18] he is able to keep that which you've
[57:20] committed to him against the day he says
[57:22] that's the one Paul is talking to a man
[57:26] praise the Lord
[57:27] listen to how much just I want you to
[57:29] notice now what he's saying is he says
[57:31] you ready to understand something he
[57:33] says that how many's received the
[57:34] promises you've got a clearer
[57:35] understanding
[57:35] notice I'm where the RAM keeps talking
[57:37] about this say men in other words when
[57:40] you come into the promise that there's
[57:41] an there's an understanding that
[57:43] accompanies that that you didn't have in
[57:45] the wilderness and what is it it's an
[57:47] understanding of position that's what
[57:50] they didn't know the loaners that they
[57:51] learned in the land when they come in
[57:53] under a Joshua Commission god buy them
[57:56] out to Joshua by the inspiration of God
[57:59] now listen they didn't lay out in this
[58:00] land ahead of time and take photos you
[58:02] know they'd send a drone out and survey
[58:04] the land say well we're gonna cut this
[58:06] part up here and I want this mountain
[58:07] here and I want this that know God by
[58:09] inspiration when they come into the land
[58:12] they need understanding this is where
[58:14] Ephraim is gonna be and this is where my
[58:16] Nass is gonna be and this is where Judah
[58:18] is gonna be now they could choose if
[58:19] they want to stand the other side of the
[58:20] river and live off manna
[58:22] but there was no matter their hey man
[58:25] the manna ceased whether they went in or
[58:26] not praise the Lord somebody listen you
[58:29] couldn't just leave out so the promise
[58:30] and say well we're gonna have a smitten
[58:32] rock we're gonna have God's not doing
[58:34] that his chilling have gone into a land
[58:36] this should have entered into something
[58:39] else
[58:39] praise the Lord and we're entering
[58:41] there's an understanding of a position
[58:43] or an inheritance that comes with that
[58:46] brother Ram says emphasis here sets us
[58:48] like Joshua positions as you notice Josh
[58:51] Oh after crossing over the land and
[58:53] taking the land then he divided the land
[58:56] he from here Manasseh here and this one
[58:58] GAD here Benjamin here he divided the
[59:00] land notice he says this is burns in our
[59:03] hearts every one of these Hebrew mothers
[59:05] giving birth to those children she spoke
[59:08] of the very place in her labor pains
[59:11] think about that her very prophetic
[59:13] groanings were in labor the very labor
[59:16] pains the very trials and persecutions
[59:17] that a church is gone there spoke of who
[59:20] they where it spoke of their anointing
[59:23] in their age they didn't know at the
[59:25] time so Joshua took him into and they
[59:27] man and that would be positioning the
[59:30] land notice the positioning in the
[59:31] Promised Land is what we're talking
[59:33] about you think about what we've had in
[59:34] this day we've had a messenger come
[59:36] under a Joshua Commission and his
[59:39] position not just us but each other
[59:41] church age
[59:42] listen Wesley didn't know his own age
[59:44] Luther didn't know zone age but under
[59:46] this entering into a promise under this
[59:49] adopts in tomorrow's endtime seed sign
[59:52] when they come in the promised land I
[59:54] want you to notice it was the harvest
[59:55] time because the corn was on the wheat
[59:57] was on the stock already it was a time
[59:59] of the harvest and when they entered
[1:00:01] into the land that's when Joshua
[1:00:03] positions that he says this was for
[1:00:05] their age and this is for their age but
[1:00:07] we've got something else we've come not
[1:00:09] just until later to see in condition but
[1:00:12] we've risen above the hats into a word
[1:00:14] age where every promise in the book is
[1:00:16] ours
[1:00:17] like a spark that's lit off of something
[1:00:19] you can have what you ask if you cannot
[1:00:22] believe all things are possible
[1:00:25] [Music]
[1:00:27] [Applause]
[1:00:29] listen what limited them in their day
[1:00:31] their understanding they didn't
[1:00:34] understand what was all fully theirs but
[1:00:37] the understanding brings the positioning
[1:00:39] when you understand what belongs you you
[1:00:42] can go walk out you know how to get back
[1:00:43] you know where it's at you know where it
[1:00:45] starts like a priest last time you got a
[1:00:46] landmark you know where it starts you
[1:00:49] know where it stops you know exactly all
[1:00:51] about it the confusion is gone
[1:00:53] notice the Devils the awesome confusion
[1:00:56] God's not the author of confusion but of
[1:00:58] peace well hallelujah
[1:01:01] that's the truth God is not the author
[1:01:03] listen if you're walking on confusion if
[1:01:05] you don't know your rights just today
[1:01:07] you're in a righteous tomorrow they're
[1:01:08] got two souls that I got one am i up am
[1:01:10] i down whatever other kind of nonsense
[1:01:12] is he come back in a cloud or horse what
[1:01:14] the the confusion see says when the
[1:01:16] dissolve our doubts comes in you're not
[1:01:19] walking around in confusion you've got
[1:01:21] peace because he's the Prince of Peace
[1:01:23] amen oh yeah I'm high supernaturally
[1:01:28] they were positioned amen the book of
[1:01:29] Hebrews tells us in the seventh chapter
[1:01:30] taught my Melchizedek he says look how
[1:01:34] consider how great this man was on whom
[1:01:36] even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth
[1:01:38] of the Spoils and barely they they're
[1:01:40] the sons of Levi he received the office
[1:01:42] of appreciate they have a commandment to
[1:01:45] take tithes of the people according to
[1:01:46] law that is of their brethren though
[1:01:49] they come out of the loins of Abraham
[1:01:50] but he whose descent is not counted from
[1:01:53] them receiveth receive tithes of Abraham
[1:01:55] and blessed him that had the promises
[1:01:58] hey man and without all contradiction
[1:02:00] the lasas blessed of the better here men
[1:02:03] that die receive tithes but there he
[1:02:05] receiveth them of whom and his witness
[1:02:08] that he liveth and as I may so say Levi
[1:02:11] also who received tithes paid tithes in
[1:02:14] Abraham for he was yet in the loins of
[1:02:17] his father would look as anak met him
[1:02:19] him and I believe I talked about this
[1:02:20] liver the last time for you that were
[1:02:21] here a man but notice what brother Ram
[1:02:23] says he says let's look at the Hebrews
[1:02:25] the seventh chapter the Bible says milk
[1:02:27] hesitant Abraham returning from the
[1:02:30] slaughter of the kingdom blessed him it
[1:02:32] said now Levi he's talking about paying
[1:02:34] ties and Levi had an order from the Lord
[1:02:36] to receive ties from his brethren and
[1:02:38] Levi who received ties paint
[1:02:41] Tai's he was hit in the loins of Abraham
[1:02:43] when he met Melchizedek Abraham was his
[1:02:46] great-grandfather Abraham begat Isaac
[1:02:48] Isaac begat Jacob Jacob begat Levi Levi
[1:02:51] father grandfather great-grandfather
[1:02:53] while Levi was in the loins of Abraham
[1:02:55] the Bible said he paid tithes to
[1:02:58] Melchizedek
[1:03:00] he says hallelujah because I look
[1:03:02] excited about something there says don't
[1:03:04] let nobody tell you that any kind of a
[1:03:06] move in the world can ever interfere
[1:03:09] with God's great she's moving right
[1:03:13] on there ain't a devil or enough Devils
[1:03:16] can interfere with this program listen
[1:03:19] when you're in the lowest you're subject
[1:03:21] to the elements and the conditions of
[1:03:24] the Ronis but if this promised land that
[1:03:26] don't affect you anymore the trials can
[1:03:30] come and sickness can come persecutions
[1:03:32] can come but nothing can take you out of
[1:03:34] the hand of God when you realize you're
[1:03:36] already in his hand we have a
[1:03:39] recognition that God has he has you in
[1:03:41] his hand and there's not one that can
[1:03:43] pluck you from his hand that brings the
[1:03:46] rest amen - no there's nothing can stop
[1:03:48] you you come from God and you're going
[1:03:51] back to God amen
[1:03:55] I says now the Bible didn't say
[1:03:58] potentially he paint it think about that
[1:04:00] now the Bible said he paid tithes when
[1:04:02] he was in his great-grandfather's loins
[1:04:03] glory he says that's my Lord and then
[1:04:07] listen he didn't just potentially are
[1:04:08] sort of doing a shadow or it looked like
[1:04:11] he did he really didn't pay ties the
[1:04:13] Bible said the Bible credits him with
[1:04:15] the righteous of doing that in his
[1:04:17] father Abraham and listen if you died
[1:04:19] was Christ at Calvary I don't look
[1:04:22] that's just a nice finger speech or just
[1:04:24] a nice poetic philosophy I believe you
[1:04:26] really did die with him at Calvary if
[1:04:29] you're part of that Word of God if
[1:04:30] you're part of that same spirit when he
[1:04:32] died you literally died with him but
[1:04:36] when he rose praise God do you literally
[1:04:38] rose up with them on the third day
[1:04:40] you're literally right now
[1:04:43] Justice of God in Christ Jesus not
[1:04:46] potentially not a hope so not maybe you
[1:04:49] are the righteousness of God in Christ
[1:04:52] Jesus
[1:04:53] old things are passed away all things
[1:04:55] are new and they're all of God now
[1:05:02] listen if you rose up with him on the
[1:05:04] third day then you can't die and then
[1:05:08] you can't die you don't already died
[1:05:10] once you might not remember it but you
[1:05:12] were there when they crucified my Lord
[1:05:14] when they put the captivity captive on
[1:05:22] high they cried out when they asked who
[1:05:26] is this King of glory
[1:05:27] he said open up here everlasting gates
[1:05:30] who is this King of glory
[1:05:32] the Lord of hosts he is the king of
[1:05:34] glory you who were dead in sins and
[1:05:39] trespasses yet he hath quickened he's
[1:05:44] revived you like I said last time - give
[1:05:46] me an exorcist he let's breathe
[1:05:48] something into your life
[1:05:50] I'm not waiting for a revival this is my
[1:05:52] reliable this is my promise Kenan is my
[1:05:56] destination I've got nowhere else to go
[1:05:58] I'm not looking to go back to Egypt I'm
[1:06:00] not looking to go over to Babylon I'm
[1:06:03] not looking to go over to some other
[1:06:04] place amen I've come to my promise the
[1:06:10] vehm talking about this
[1:06:11] Levi's paying tithes he says if he says
[1:06:13] how aren't you people to live by think
[1:06:16] about that he says if your sins are
[1:06:18] visited to the children what about your
[1:06:21] blessings I'll tell you what I'd rather
[1:06:24] talk about my blessings in my sins it's
[1:06:28] true hey man listen leave you can throw
[1:06:30] the Christian books for a day and
[1:06:31] they've got all kinds of books on
[1:06:32] generational curses and and how to
[1:06:34] overcome this and how to overcome that
[1:06:35] and well you had you had such and such
[1:06:37] and your family 14 generations ago so
[1:06:40] that's why you've got this condition
[1:06:41] they've got all kinds of things to talk
[1:06:43] about that I'm thinking I don't I don't
[1:06:45] need that I'm one generation removed
[1:06:47] away from Almighty God I'm a new
[1:06:49] creature in Christ that's not who I am
[1:06:52] and if God listen if instead of cursing
[1:06:55] and insane nests and things would come
[1:06:57] on people because of things are their
[1:06:59] great-grandfather or their
[1:07:00] great-great-grandfather who did what
[1:07:02] about the blessings on the life of a
[1:07:05] believer
[1:07:05] listen maybe you've got children or
[1:07:08] loved ones today and they're out in the
[1:07:09] world their hearts so maybe they're away
[1:07:11] from God and you might be wondering
[1:07:12] yourself today how can i how will they
[1:07:15] ever overcome how can God never we gonna
[1:07:17] hold her life what can I do about
[1:07:19] listening God if you were visit the
[1:07:21] cursings upon the people that were
[1:07:23] disobedient how much more will he visit
[1:07:25] the blessing upon his people he's made a
[1:07:28] promise in his Bible that you would be
[1:07:30] in a promised land with your offspring
[1:07:32] he's given you a token a promise you can
[1:07:35] believe it doesn't matter what kind of
[1:07:37] Darkness they're in or what kind of
[1:07:39] condition my god is more than able this
[1:07:43] is if you can bring you out of Egypt
[1:07:45] surely he can reach out to the lowness
[1:07:46] the wireless for such for some of you
[1:07:49] know somewhere you were adopters and
[1:07:51] whoremongers and vile and filthy but yet
[1:07:54] God save you and you've been washed by
[1:07:57] the washing of the water up the word
[1:07:59] [Applause]
[1:08:01] praise the Lord
[1:08:04] that's what we do we focus on the bad
[1:08:06] well I did this I did that yeah but God
[1:08:08] did this and God did that oh but I've
[1:08:12] got this my past but before that God
[1:08:14] said something about you before that God
[1:08:16] saw something about you he's telling you
[1:08:18] holy he saw your righteous he saw you
[1:08:21] accepted in the beloved but he saw your
[1:08:25] downfalls he saw your weaknesses he saw
[1:08:28] your mistakes and he loved you anyhow
[1:08:29] before you knew about him before you did
[1:08:32] him before you got disappointed in
[1:08:34] yourself for doing it he knew all about
[1:08:36] me loved you anyway
[1:08:37] he said I'm in a provision I've given
[1:08:39] you a place of promise where it's
[1:08:41] settled and all the reproaches rolled
[1:08:44] away hey man I believe that old man's
[1:08:49] dead you ought to bury him hey man I
[1:08:52] believe he's dead you got to bear him
[1:08:53] and not dig him back up every three days
[1:08:55] and try and preach another funeral to on
[1:08:57] repent for the same old thing over and
[1:08:59] over again put him in the ground and
[1:09:00] leave him there
[1:09:01] put me to believe him there
[1:09:03] we are new creatures in Christ Jesus my
[1:09:08] lie to think about the promises that God
[1:09:12] had waiting for them in this land
[1:09:13] what do you wanted to do with them and
[1:09:15] yet there was a people that didn't want
[1:09:17] to walk into the land why is it because
[1:09:20] they become accustom to a certain kind
[1:09:23] of life a man they become accustomed to
[1:09:27] just well this is all the better I can
[1:09:29] get this is all the more God can do for
[1:09:31] me this is I'm just gonna have to live
[1:09:33] in this condition for the rest of my
[1:09:35] life and they become they become
[1:09:37] complacent they resigned themselves this
[1:09:40] idea that this is all God can do for me
[1:09:42] this this is good enough
[1:09:43] hey man think about that now if we're
[1:09:48] not careful we'll do the same thing well
[1:09:50] I think God he did something for me 30
[1:09:52] years ago I thank God for it too
[1:09:53] but where are you at today did you stop
[1:09:56] somewhere did you move on with God amen
[1:09:59] praise the Lord I'm on praise the Lord
[1:10:05] you think about this now to enter into
[1:10:08] the Promised Land why was it so
[1:10:10] important because as I talked about a
[1:10:12] little bit last time because it was not
[1:10:13] just your possession it was your
[1:10:15] brother's possession was your sister's
[1:10:17] possession and then for us to enter the
[1:10:20] promised land it's not just you it's
[1:10:22] just me that that's what the devil tries
[1:10:24] to do to us I mean you watch the church
[1:10:26] and God says we went to church and he's
[1:10:28] blessing the people what does the devil
[1:10:30] try to do we try to come in and sow the
[1:10:32] seed of discord why because he knows if
[1:10:35] he can if it can divide you that you're
[1:10:37] not you you're not as blessed is when
[1:10:39] you come together
[1:10:40] you look even the two and a half tribes
[1:10:41] didn't want to enter into the Promised
[1:10:43] Land and Josh who made him go in anyway
[1:10:45] and possess the land with their brothers
[1:10:48] so that there won't be discouraged they
[1:10:50] had a job to do a man nyaah
[1:10:53] listen we we've had like I said we've
[1:10:56] had so many great testimonies throughout
[1:10:58] history what God has done for his people
[1:11:00] but in this age we have a recognition
[1:11:02] we've been positioning man I think God
[1:11:04] forward you back there but listen we've
[1:11:06] come to something better than just manna
[1:11:08] hey man praise the Lord you look at the
[1:11:12] word man that something's what is
[1:11:13] Nathan salad didn't know what God was
[1:11:15] doing but we've come into an
[1:11:17] understanding hey man we've crossed into
[1:11:19] a place for that original seed that had
[1:11:22] been lying in the gravel hung when
[1:11:23] Abraham had walked there that seed was
[1:11:25] in the seed that was in a seed that was
[1:11:27] in a seat somewhere and that same life
[1:11:29] was there now on the stop ready for
[1:11:32] harvest amen ha ha ha so here this
[1:11:36] generation of people comes in and what
[1:11:38] happens they get circumcised that's the
[1:11:39] first thing Joshua does it brings him in
[1:11:41] the promisin and he circumcised them
[1:11:44] with the same circumcision they had back
[1:11:46] with Abraham the same life and they came
[1:11:49] through that was the same life amen
[1:11:50] I believe brothers and sisters that God
[1:11:53] has given us something in this day I
[1:11:55] believe we can have the same Holy Ghost
[1:11:56] but they have them the day of Pentecost
[1:11:58] we'd have to sell for a handshake or a
[1:12:00] sprinkle somewhere we're gonna have
[1:12:02] power we have authority we get on the
[1:12:05] bus you the gospel of Christ let me get
[1:12:08] back there and even better cuz you've
[1:12:10] got an understanding that accompanies
[1:12:12] that amen
[1:12:13] well prison listen I I'm tired of people
[1:12:16] tell me I can't have what somebody used
[1:12:17] to have well that was just for the
[1:12:19] Apostles well that was just for brother
[1:12:21] songs huh or that was just for certain
[1:12:22] there I'm tired of hearing the devil
[1:12:24] trying to keep me out of my promised
[1:12:26] land God said it's fine
[1:12:28] you can put giants there you can put
[1:12:30] walled cities there it don't matter to
[1:12:32] God
[1:12:33] it all falls before the power God the
[1:12:36] captain the host of the army of the Lord
[1:12:38] has come down to lead us to victory look
[1:12:42] he didn't come to lead you back to
[1:12:43] Jordan to retreat you ain't give me the
[1:12:46] power to back up on Devil's or to cave
[1:12:48] into sickness or to give up and defeat
[1:12:50] he gave me the power to cast out sin and
[1:12:53] sickness and darkness and then what we
[1:12:57] need today is a stronger wishbone and
[1:12:59] get a backbone in her says I believe
[1:13:01] every word of God I don't care what
[1:13:03] anybody say about it the promise is for
[1:13:05] me it's for the children it's for all in
[1:13:08] our far off it's for my church it's for
[1:13:11] my kids it's for my wife it's for my
[1:13:14] husband I can have the power and the
[1:13:16] blessing of God
[1:13:18] God set your message so you would
[1:13:21] understand that belongs do you look you
[1:13:24] don't belong to everybody but to you
[1:13:26] that I understand you even have crossed
[1:13:28] over here and your understandings on
[1:13:29] muddled up it's for you mama listen I'm
[1:13:36] not ashamed of the gospel Christ I
[1:13:38] believe God did a thing a certain time
[1:13:41] for the RAM said if God ever did a thing
[1:13:43] for a man ever at one time he's
[1:13:44] obligated to do the same thing for
[1:13:47] anybody who come on the same basis cuz
[1:13:49] he's not a respecter of persons and man
[1:13:52] I believe that hey man listen now we do
[1:13:54] I believe that I'm feeling on that I
[1:13:55] come in the land and I sticks on that
[1:13:58] corner I say I'm gonna make this into
[1:14:00] something I'm hungry
[1:14:02] I've had we've had manna free agent I've
[1:14:04] got something even better I've got the
[1:14:06] unfailing body word of the son of man
[1:14:09] listen a man's words of failure a man
[1:14:12] that man is good for a day but this
[1:14:14] comes this is the true brand that cometh
[1:14:17] down from heaven jesus said your
[1:14:19] father's ate manna in the wilderness and
[1:14:21] they died but I am the true bread which
[1:14:24] descended from heaven and if a man would
[1:14:26] eat this bread he'll never hungry again
[1:14:29] oh praise God I believe in him so
[1:14:33] satisfied in Christ I believe he could
[1:14:35] draw from the wells of Bethlehem Oh
[1:14:37] Holly you can draw from the fountain of
[1:14:40] grace and never thirst again I believe
[1:14:43] there's something somewhere that
[1:14:44] satisfies the searching soul it'll
[1:14:48] satisfy not from one revival to the next
[1:14:50] not from one church means when that's
[1:14:51] it'll seal to the day of the redemption
[1:14:55] we're immature Christian and then
[1:14:58] Christian when nobody's around
[1:15:00] nobody has to make him serve God you can
[1:15:02] be a Daniel in the middle of Babylon
[1:15:04] with no pastor to pat you on the back
[1:15:06] and no Deaton in the back here up and
[1:15:08] make you go to church and you'll still
[1:15:10] serve God you'll still praise God Who am
[1:15:15] I I believe we've got a fountain open
[1:15:17] hey man there was a fountain open in the
[1:15:20] house of David that day at Calvary and
[1:15:22] the water blood flowed from his side
[1:15:25] whoa
[1:15:27] does those that are a search that they
[1:15:29] could come and drink hey man you think
[1:15:32] about that they coming in the promised
[1:15:34] son again
[1:15:34] there was Wells in that promise land
[1:15:35] that Jacob had dug hundreds of years
[1:15:38] before Jacob what type of grace for the
[1:15:40] RAM said dwells a lot of haven't done
[1:15:42] that's what the woman's the well John
[1:15:44] said before came to him as a well that
[1:15:46] Jacob had dog hey man
[1:15:48] said well our Father said okay drink
[1:15:50] from it our Father Jacob dug this well
[1:15:52] where our fathers say worship here and
[1:15:54] that you say worship here they said
[1:15:56] listen there's another fountain there's
[1:15:58] another pump that that was good for a
[1:16:00] day that was good for a season like that
[1:16:02] man up but there's one here and if you
[1:16:05] knew who he was on my some of you off
[1:16:08] you knew who's here right now look it's
[1:16:10] not me it's not you Jesus is here if you
[1:16:14] really recognize who is here you and
[1:16:16] asked for a drink and you would never
[1:16:17] searched again if your lot of fussing
[1:16:21] and fighting and being depressed and all
[1:16:23] kinds of nonsense that tries to drag you
[1:16:25] down huh listen I'm not up here to beat
[1:16:27] you up then you got enough against you
[1:16:29] as it is all the devils and hell are out
[1:16:31] against this bride but you brought a
[1:16:32] place to stand you've got a place of
[1:16:35] strength where the gates of hell can't
[1:16:37] even prevail against you I got to push
[1:16:42] you down the devil do that just fine I
[1:16:43] was oh but if I could just encourage
[1:16:45] somebody that you know huh you're going
[1:16:47] through something God has brought you to
[1:16:49] somewhere well you can drink and you can

[1:17:20] this and why a little Bethlehem he says
[1:17:23] is you can only live in the natural by
[1:17:25] dead substance something had to die so
[1:17:29] that you can live natural he said how
[1:17:31] much more did something have to die so
[1:17:32] you can live eternally he said Christ
[1:17:34] died that we might live eternally
[1:17:36] and he become the house of God's eternal
[1:17:38] life bread that we cats freshly every
[1:17:42] hour of the day coming down from God out
[1:17:44] of heaven the form of the holy spirit
[1:17:47] feeds our hungry souls as we sit
[1:17:49] together in heavenly places he says he
[1:17:52] is our Bethlehem then all true believing
[1:17:55] sons of God are born in Bethlehem with
[1:17:58] him notice the position again a man
[1:18:01] you're if you were son of God or your
[1:18:04] daughter God you're born in Bethlehem
[1:18:05] with him he says if Christ had become
[1:18:08] the bread of life to be born in
[1:18:10] Bethlehem which is life's bread house
[1:18:12] then every one of true believers in
[1:18:14] Christ is born in Christ they're born in
[1:18:17] God's Bethlehem what is better than the
[1:18:19] house of God's bread amen

[1:18:39] bread eat and live forever I've been
[1:18:44] told my position inheritance this
[1:18:46] morning I want you think about little
[1:18:47] Bethlehem why little Bethlehem it's the
[1:18:50] house of God's bread God set up this
[1:18:53] portion from an ass and Ephraim and way
[1:18:55] up here in Judah which had nothing to do
[1:18:57] with priesthood not from Levites but
[1:18:59] we're appearing to you there's a little
[1:19:00] town up there and God ordained it to
[1:19:02] being the tribe of Judah a little
[1:19:04] Bethlehem you can look at how Purim
[1:19:06] talks about you can read the history of
[1:19:08] life it's the center of agriculture they
[1:19:10] all come from miles it could feed the
[1:19:12] whole region it could feed the whole
[1:19:14] nation from Bethlehem there was so much
[1:19:16] Brad there it was more than what Judah
[1:19:18] needed it was enough to feed everybody
[1:19:22] hey man there was an abundance of grace
[1:19:25] that supplied to them from the house of
[1:19:28] little Judah of little Bethlehem hey man
[1:19:30] and what you think about this little
[1:19:31] Bethlehem because there's something
[1:19:33] special about this remember christ is
[1:19:35] born in Bethlehem a man there was a man
[1:19:37] in him either one but the Bible tells us
[1:19:39] by the name of Boas you know about the
[1:19:41] house and he he lived in Bethlehem and
[1:19:44] bible tells us about this man Boaz in
[1:19:47] Bethlehem listen there was a seed inside
[1:19:49] of this man that was waiting to be
[1:19:51] expressed to be born in Bethlehem and
[1:19:54] God took a little girl by the name of
[1:19:56] Ruth her her mommy Naomi was needing
[1:19:59] somebody to feed her her sons had died
[1:20:01] and her husband had died and all
[1:20:03] she had was little rooster take care of

[1:20:43] of all kinds of homes kinds of walks of
[1:20:46] life he'd come out of affliction of
[1:20:48] maybe abuse even and maybe death in the
[1:20:50] family and heartache and you wonder why
[1:20:53] did I have to go through these things
[1:20:55] why did I have to suffer with this one
[1:20:57] why did I come a certain kind of a
[1:20:59] family why did I go through certain
[1:21:01] things in my life but listen God was
[1:21:03] trying to bring to a place the tender
[1:21:05] hand of Jehovah was trying to lead you
[1:21:07] down to Bethlehem because that's the
[1:21:09] only place but the son and daughter of
[1:21:11] God can be born as a little Bethlehem
[1:21:13] and he'll use your trials and they use
[1:21:16] afflictions these heartaches here
[1:21:18] disappointments use your own mind
[1:21:21] battles but the devil's tried to purpose
[1:21:23] against you to destroy you
[1:21:25] God will use them for good God will you
[1:21:28] lead you down to Bethlehem through
[1:21:31] afflictions through trials to bring you
[1:21:34] to a bow eyes cuz it's there in
[1:21:38] Bethlehem Boaz is waiting to bring forth
[1:21:41] the promised son Oh hallelujah you think
[1:21:45] about Christ himself his parents said
[1:21:47] his adoptive parents who say that way
[1:21:49] they lived in they live in Nazareth but
[1:21:52] a decree went out throughout all the
[1:21:53] earth
[1:21:54] if the people should be taxed listen
[1:21:56] dollars and take your taxes and using
[1:21:58] the benefit take your taxes and bless
[1:22:01] she said how's that gonna happen well
[1:22:04] didn't you think about a profit line VRS
[1:22:07] we're gonna go through tax trouble

[1:22:11] his own sake or for an example for you
[1:22:13] look God is able to take your trials and
[1:22:16] even your mistakes
[1:22:17] and use them for his blind we can either
[1:22:21] get disappointed and we can get a
[1:22:22] scourge and we can look at ourselves and
[1:22:24] throw up our hands and give up or we can
[1:22:26] say you know what God is greater than my
[1:22:28] past love is greater than my mistakes
[1:22:31] God is greater than my family history
[1:22:33] and sickness and what doctors say and
[1:22:36] what bankers saying what teachers say
[1:22:38] and what even though the preachers say
[1:22:40] Amen God is greater than all that God
[1:22:43] can take me to Bethlehem why do the
[1:22:50] taxation go through all the earth to
[1:22:52] bring a promised son to Bethlehem why do
[1:22:57] you go through things because God has
[1:22:58] brought you somewhere you you want to
[1:23:01] plant it all on your own your own heart
[1:23:03] devises your own ways but the Lord
[1:23:05] directs your steps and you might not

[1:24:29] right listen he's the true bread from
[1:24:31] heaven is that right my my I want you to
[1:24:35] think about this for a second I want to
[1:24:36] come to something here a man because
[1:24:38] this this is the thing God has a purpose
[1:24:40] like I said in this if you are part of
[1:24:42] that original Word of God or that seed
[1:24:45] the Bible says this in Isaiah 55 says
[1:24:47] first the rain comes down and the snow
[1:24:49] from heaven and returns not feather but
[1:24:52] it waters the earth and makes it bring
[1:24:54] forth and bud
[1:24:56] they be give seed to the sower and bread
[1:24:58] to the eater so shall my word be that
[1:25:01] goeth forth out of my mouth something
[1:25:03] about you now he's not saying man he's
[1:25:07] not just talking out the words on the
[1:25:08] page here he's talking about you
[1:25:09] amen it shall not return unto me void
[1:25:12] but it shall accomplish I believe right
[1:25:15] now this morning it shall accomplish
[1:25:17] that which I please and it shall prosper
[1:25:20] and the thing we run to I said it listen
[1:25:23] if God has placed a purpose in your life
[1:25:25] it's got to come to pass and then don't
[1:25:29] look at the discouragement don't look at
[1:25:31] the trial look at the purpose of God
[1:25:34] looking where you come from and what you
[1:25:36] spin you can recognize I'm not what I
[1:25:38] used to be I'm not where I come from God
[1:25:41] has brought me into a goodly land a land
[1:25:43] that flows with milk and honey yeah you
[1:25:47] might have to rise up and fight every
[1:25:48] night yeah there might be Giants but God
[1:25:50] has given you the promise this is a land
[1:25:53] that flows with milk and honey this is a
[1:25:56] place it's worth it
[1:25:58] listen it's worth every fight it's worth
[1:26:02] every trial but if God is in you it's
[1:26:05] him that worketh in you too willing to
[1:26:07] do his good pleasure
[1:26:08] it shall not go forth mine look I've
[1:26:12] been saving lose you got it you up
[1:26:14] out of the mire sin they'll let you fall
[1:26:17] he's not gonna let one word follow the
[1:26:19] ground Omaha
[1:26:22] he shall accomplish in your life and in
[1:26:25] your home and in your work what pleases
[1:26:28] him its seed to the sower and it's bread
[1:26:36] to the eater hey man you think about
[1:26:39] Jesus is on his own life his own
[1:26:40] ministry he says I'm the true bread that
[1:26:42] comes from heaven in the in the Last
[1:26:44] Supper with his disciples he takes the
[1:26:46] bread he breaks the bread his brother
[1:26:48] races this is my body take eat this
[1:26:50] bread is my body the bread is speaking
[1:26:52] of his body or the manifestation of the
[1:26:56] seed or the life that was on the inside
[1:26:58] amen what is the brightness of
[1:27:00] manifestation or the fruition of what
[1:27:04] was on the what was on the original life
[1:27:05] of that tree or that seed or that
[1:27:07] harvest amen amen jesus said himself
[1:27:09] talking about his life and Saint John
[1:27:12] the twelfth chapter says except a
[1:27:13] quarter we die and go into the ground it
[1:27:16] abides alone but let now look you can't
[1:27:19] make bread out of just water but if you
[1:27:21] ever put that in the ground you get
[1:27:22] across you can make bread out of the
[1:27:24] house Amen somebody hallelujah he said
[1:27:27] it'll bring forth much fruit if it goes
[1:27:29] in the ground and dies the life that was
[1:27:31] in Christ goes into the ground it dies
[1:27:35] he raised up again and when he raises up
[1:27:37] again you raised with him now there's a
[1:27:40] purpose that's what I'm trying to come
[1:27:41] to this we talked about the scene of God
[1:27:43] the word of God here life the harvest
[1:27:46] time a man you can look in Matthew
[1:27:47] chapter 13 the parable of the seed sower
[1:27:50] the son of man told a good seed and the
[1:27:52] wicked sowed an evil seed is that right
[1:27:55] but the purpose of the song of the seed
[1:27:57] well it's not just the harvest amen
[1:28:00] praise the Lord listen the purpose of
[1:28:02] the man in the war was not just to
[1:28:03] survive off the manna there was
[1:28:05] something more beyond that they had to
[1:28:07] come into a promise and possess the land
[1:28:09] and live off the land
[1:28:11] we talk about a harvest time and a wave
[1:28:14] sheep in a ministry of a prophet I think
[1:28:16] God for those things but many times we
[1:28:18] stop there and acknowledging that and we
[1:28:20] missed there's one more step that were
[1:28:22] missing which is that the Angels go in
[1:28:25] jesus said in matthew 13 what are the
[1:28:27] angels they're the Reapers the angels go
[1:28:29] in at the harvest and they gather the
[1:28:31] wheat into his bed and his garner is
[1:28:35] that right why then it might become
[1:28:37] Bread on his table listen you don't want
[1:28:41] to just leave it on oh my god you know
[1:28:44] I've been overseas I've been overseas
[1:28:46] and I look at that I've been in the
[1:28:48] heart of the voice of God now Ivory
[1:28:49] Coast they got a whole warehouse full of
[1:28:51] books just waiting to be delivered to

[1:29:10] table having something to eat knowing
[1:29:12] that same God that same Jesus performs
[1:29:15] the same sign breaks that same bread of
[1:29:17] life to have that amen

[1:29:23] got sitting around with that spiritual
[1:29:25] food store that but if we're not careful
[1:29:29] we'll leave it sit on the vine outside
[1:29:30] and we'll starve to death when there's
[1:29:33] food right there
[1:29:34] Amen somebody got since the Reapers he
[1:29:37] says the angels for the harvest cuz he
[1:29:39] doesn't want to just leave it on a page
[1:29:41] somewhere he don't want to leave our
[1:29:43] device somewhere he wants it to be
[1:29:45] manifest in you what was the bread of
[1:29:49] life it was a manifestation of Christ in
[1:29:51] his body what is it in you it's a
[1:29:54] manifestation of Christ in your life you
[1:29:58] say what do you mean listen he wants to
[1:30:01] take you from just having a seed to be
[1:30:03] embedded on his table he wants to change
[1:30:06] your vile body into a glorious body
[1:30:08] lacking into his own bread he wants you
[1:30:11] to possess his own likeness his own
[1:30:13] fullness of his attributes a man not
[1:30:16] just to look at it and their knowledge
[1:30:17] but to take it and possess it and either

[1:37:36] rude that's the nature Ruth to rest in
[1:37:40] the field of bars not go from field to
[1:37:42] field to denomination the idea the
[1:37:44] philosophy tossed to and fro by every
[1:37:47] wind of doctrine now she's found the
[1:37:49] place of rest I'm satisfied but see some
[1:37:51] people who just never satisfied that's
[1:37:54] why they can't sit in their pasture
[1:37:55] that's why I can't go the same church

[1:38:32] something that you can come to you're
[1:38:33] not looking for something but you've
[1:38:36] come to a place we're not ever learning

[1:39:11] listen they can't live with themselves
[1:39:13] how are you gonna cope with them amen
[1:39:15] you've got to come to something like

[1:39:35] don't believe we should be that type of
[1:39:36] people hey man I've seen it so many
[1:39:38] times people do begin to pull away and
[1:39:40] if we're not careful we push them away I

[1:39:47] somebody how they bring get help a man

[1:40:04] how the shuck is pulling away from the
[1:40:06] weight is but the wheat has to lay in
[1:40:09] the presence of the Sun why is this
[1:40:12] happening that we has to lay in the
[1:40:13] presence of the Sun to ripen I believe
[1:40:16] brother Graham mentioned 7 times the
[1:40:18] message I believe I have to go back to
[1:40:19] count again but he meant to sometimes
[1:40:21] laying in the presence of the Sun amen
[1:40:23] he says it has to stay in the presence
[1:40:26] of the Sun they meant to ripen that's
[1:40:28] what we're here for friend stay in the
[1:40:30] presence of the Sun watch I says it
[1:40:33] still our little group of people here
[1:40:34] till becomes so right to Christ
[1:40:37] it becomes bread on his table that's the
[1:40:41] goal amen why are we ripening in the
[1:40:43] presence on to become bread on his table
[1:40:45] he says that's what I want to do amen
[1:40:50] everyone talks about this in questions
[1:40:52] answers every one more quote here a man
[1:40:54] he says it's in question answers 1964
[1:40:57] he's talking about the Book of Daniel
[1:40:58] this is the Bible said that when Daniel
[1:41:00] when he wrote the he calls the first
[1:41:01] book of Revelation Daniel
[1:41:03] he says we noticed the vision he come to
[1:41:05] the ancient of time whose hair was white
[1:41:07] as wool he's how many remember reading
[1:41:09] that he says I he and did you notice
[1:41:12] John and revelation came to the same
[1:41:14] thing revelation one he stood there his
[1:41:16] hair was as white as wool his feet in
[1:41:19] the way it looked ancient of time
[1:41:21] ancient of time has had no time the
[1:41:23] eternal one and he came as now watch the
[1:41:27] saints come to the earth and the books
[1:41:29] were opened and another book was opened
[1:41:32] which was the book of life one luck they
[1:41:35] came to the judgment and he came and
[1:41:37] with him came ten thousands time ten
[1:41:40] thousands is that right so who's that
[1:41:42] comes with him he says ministering to
[1:41:44] him the bride the queen and king he says
[1:41:49] who is the little Queen in your home
[1:41:50] she ministers food to you is that right
[1:41:53] he says when she ministers to you that's
[1:41:56] what the bride and I think this is
[1:41:58] profoundly a man that's what the bride
[1:42:00] ministers to Christ the word man shall
[1:42:05] not live by bread alone but every word
[1:42:07] see she ministers the word to the king
[1:42:11] manifesting his promised word in the age
[1:42:14] she's living in and he says Amen he said
[1:42:17] I said something that he didn't get it
[1:42:18] he says notice oh my that was a good one
[1:42:21] I thought was pretty good too so good I
[1:42:23] thought preached the whole message about
[1:42:24] it amen notice we talked about him
[1:42:28] ministering to us but who is ministering
[1:42:30] to him the bride how does she miss her
[1:42:33] him she misses the word of the age by
[1:42:36] manifesting it that's how she ministered
[1:42:38] to him Narns me ministering to you
[1:42:40] you're ministering to me the body
[1:42:42] ministering to one another becomes
[1:42:44] bright on his table the manifestation of
[1:42:47] it that's what he's looking for in other
[1:42:50] words what can I do for Christ become
[1:42:52] Bread on his table hey he says this my
[1:42:57] ministering lineage the word notice she
[1:43:00] came and ten thousands time ten
[1:43:02] thousands came and the judgment was set
[1:43:05] in the book open to the other book was
[1:43:06] opened which is the book of life and
[1:43:09] there was a judge who was this that come
[1:43:11] the bride which did not have to come
[1:43:14] the judgment listen he's not taking you
[1:43:17] to judgment he's taking him to
[1:43:18] Brotherhood's table he wants you to come
[1:43:20] and put this right on the table he wants
[1:43:22] the life of Christ in you to be manifest
[1:43:25] that's how you serve Him you present
[1:43:27] yourself a living sacrifice back to him
[1:43:30] look God don't bless you used to bless

[1:44:14] today is that right God has not changed
[1:44:17] his nature or his character a man I
[1:44:20] believe that God wants something for us

[1:45:42] done
[1:45:43] God is still faithful I may have felt
[1:45:47] God I may have made mistakes but the God
[1:45:49] that I serve the God that you suck he's
[1:45:52] greater than those things he's not
[1:45:55] willing to let you just have another
[1:45:57] service because I made a mistake because
[1:45:59] you made a mistake he's willing to say

[1:54:06] we desired everybody just show the same
[1:54:08] diligence there's a full assurance of
[1:54:10] hope until the end that you'd be not
[1:54:12] slothful but followers of them who
[1:54:16] through faith and patience inherit the
[1:54:19] promises of the musicians the song
[1:54:21] leader comes forward

[1:54:40] it in the field for you you don't even
[1:54:43] have to grow it listen if you're hungry
[1:54:46] today it's not because there's no food
[1:54:49] around a man human boys is filled and
[1:54:53] you're starving to death it's not
[1:54:55] because there's not any food around us
[1:54:56] because you want me nowhere and pick it
[1:54:57] up
[1:55:00] hey man what's your busy complaining
[1:55:04] arguing and being ungrateful and
[1:55:07] unthankful unless what's right in front
[1:55:09] of our nose all the while he's just
[1:55:13] trying to catch our attention oh I want
[1:55:16] to change our sorrow into bliss all
[1:55:19] wanting to give us take away that spirit
[1:55:22] of heaviness and give us a garment a
[1:55:24] phrase everything laying right there oh
[1:55:28] whoa well wander from from all kinds of
[1:55:32] things people in the world they're going
[1:55:33] from one gimmick to another trying to
[1:55:35] find peace trying to find some
[1:55:39] Christians many times Warner from field
[1:55:42] to field well listen he's given us Bread
[1:55:46] on his table he wants you to be that
[1:55:49] bread he says look don't wander don't
[1:55:54] wander from afield my purpose my message
[1:55:56] listen I believe in this message
[1:55:58] it's eagles food I believe this message
[1:56:02] is Christ I'm not looking for it he's
[1:56:06] not out in the desert or the bedchamber
[1:56:08] some secret place the kingdom of God's
[1:56:10] here you can recognize it right now
[1:56:14] everything you have Needham's the bow
[1:56:18] our heads for a word of Prayer Lord I'm
[1:56:23] afraid this thought today
[1:56:26] maybe a little broke up kind of a
[1:56:29] thought I pray somehow that you would
[1:56:30] buy your inspirations he saw the pieces
[1:56:33] together for someone Lord in their life
[1:56:36] and they might be able to draw strength
[1:56:39] from it today more that's somewhere our
[1:56:45] wandering is with seats maybe there's
[1:56:48] one here today maybe they come to church
[1:56:50] every Sunday maybe they've been faithful
[1:56:52] to come to this building but in their
[1:56:55] heart they're still just wandering
[1:56:57] maybe unsettled maybe the cares of life
[1:57:00] today just left them in a place though
[1:57:05] they're surrounded by brothers and
[1:57:07] sisters yeah they're all alone they feel
[1:57:12] like they're isolated the devil has
[1:57:14] gotten them into a place where they feel
[1:57:17] like no one cares about him there's no
[1:57:20] no one that cares for them but just
[1:57:24] beset by trials burdens weigh them down
[1:57:27] the flesh and life seems so cruel than
[1:57:31] hard maybe oh but if they just lift up
[1:57:34] their eyes for just a moment
[1:57:36] lord I believe they'd see that great
[1:57:38] kinsman but I believe they see you stand
[1:57:41] in the doorway beckoning to them come
[1:57:46] home come into this field don't wander
