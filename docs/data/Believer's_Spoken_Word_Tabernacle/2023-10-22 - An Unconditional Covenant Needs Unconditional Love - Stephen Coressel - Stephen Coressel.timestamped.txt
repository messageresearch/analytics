[34:54] season as we were driving up here Lord
[34:56] it it was just nice to see the leaves
[34:58] and so forth brother B taught us when
[35:00] his mom was dying trying to comfort her
[35:02] his sister saying when is things most
[35:05] pretty is in their death precious in the
[35:08] sight of the lord of the death of their
[35:09] Saints and Lord as I came up here it was
[35:12] just a nice drive and it was just oh
[35:14] Lord just just a wonderful Sunday to
[35:16] come in the house of God to Worship You
[35:18] Lord Lord God it's so much beautiful
[35:21] when we die to ourselves and allow the
[35:24] resurrected Christ to live inside of us
[35:26] oh God
[35:27] Lord Jesus no doubt we all have
[35:29] testimonies we all have different
[35:30] stories of how we ended up here but Lord
[35:33] we ended up in the same place in The
[35:36] Bride of Jesus Christ in your in your
[35:39] bride Lord God destined for these last
[35:41] days Lord God and now we're here
[35:44] gathered under that mighty name of our
[35:46] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and we pray
[35:48] now God according to your grace and your
[35:51] mercy may you take this time and speak
[35:53] to our hearts Lord we commit ourselves
[35:55] unto you as unto a faithful Creator
[35:58] we're trusting and believing now in the
[35:59] name of thy son our Lord and Savior
[36:01] Jesus Christ the bride say together amen
[36:04] God bless you you may be
[36:10] seated I'm going to give you my title
[36:12] and then we'll get into a little bit and
[36:15] it's I really struggle with the title
[36:17] but then I really like this so I'm just
[36:19] going to go with it anyways I'm going to
[36:21] call it an unconditional Covenant needs
[36:24] unconditional love an unconditional
[36:28] Covenant needs unconditional love and
[36:32] how I kind of came up to this it's
[36:33] actually kind of interesting it's
[36:34] actually from a testimony um I just
[36:37] heard this week I uh took a young couple
[36:39] out to dinner last Sunday and so forth
[36:41] and we got to talking and and um he
[36:44] shared with me how he came back and so
[36:46] forth and he says something that was so
[36:48] intriguing to me it just got me thinking
[36:49] over and over and over again about it
[36:52] and you know it's amazing sometimes we
[36:54] forget we we look at these Bibles
[36:56] stories and we're so appreciative of
[36:58] these Bible stories and these Bible
[36:59] stories can teach us lessons and things
[37:01] like that but we have to remember that
[37:03] we have stories too amen remember the
[37:06] the book of Acts doesn't have amen at
[37:08] the end do you know why because there
[37:10] was more book of Acts to
[37:14] write and so I like using our examples
[37:18] and showing that through our lives we're
[37:20] expressing the word as well we're
[37:23] expecting expressing Christ through our
[37:25] lives yeah so as I was sitting down with
[37:28] this young couple um I started talking
[37:30] to I said listen how'd you come back
[37:32] this this young man uh um you know he
[37:34] was kind of out in the world but kind of
[37:36] not he was going to a different church
[37:37] and so forth he was just trying to
[37:39] discover himself and and so forth like
[37:41] that we all have different walks and we
[37:43] all different things that we need to go
[37:44] through amen and he met this girl and so
[37:47] forth at this other church this girl
[37:49] knew nothing about the message this boy
[37:50] was raising the message and he knew some
[37:52] things about and so forth like that and
[37:55] so and so they started talking and he
[37:56] end up going into a relationship with
[37:58] this girl and everything like that and
[38:01] when he's finally start feeling the pull
[38:02] to come back and so forth cuz he knew
[38:04] what was right he knew what was correct
[38:08] um this girl didn't know anything about
[38:09] this stuff amen and so when she first
[38:12] discovering this she was kind of getting
[38:14] Shell Shocked you know what I mean and
[38:16] and that's fair you know what I mean I
[38:18] mean she didn't know anything about it
[38:20] she didn't hear about this stuff as far
[38:22] as she was concerned she was serving the
[38:24] lord the best she knew amen amen but
[38:28] what what intrigued me about their story
[38:30] what was so amazing about it was was his
[38:33] attitude towards her the entire time as
[38:36] she was coming along and now they both
[38:37] go to our church and she's just much as
[38:39] much believer as you and I are amen
[38:43] right straight out of the world
[38:45] Amen and I but I loved his attitude
[38:48] towards it amen he told me he said
[38:50] listen brother Stephen I never doubted I
[38:54] never doubted because I knew what was in
[38:56] inside of her and I loved her he said I
[38:59] loved her and I knew she was going to be
[39:02] okay so she was wearing pants or
[39:05] something like that didn't bother him
[39:06] one bit and I got to thinking really
[39:09] that didn't bother you at all he said
[39:11] not one bit I knew she was going to be
[39:13] okay I just knew and it didn't change
[39:17] what she was doing didn't change how he
[39:20] felt about her I don't ain't that
[39:23] something and as I kept thinking about
[39:26] it and thinking about it I got to
[39:28] thinking you know that's what really
[39:30] changes
[39:32] us is that kind of unconditional
[39:36] love amen that see what he did was he
[39:39] had an unconditional Covenant with this
[39:42] girl that he just met out of the world
[39:44] Amen plucked her right out but she he
[39:47] had enough faith in her and that's what
[39:50] changed her life ain't that something
[39:53] amen as we think about this
[39:55] unconditional Covenant do you know what
[39:57] that means
[40:00] unconditional actually brother's going
[40:02] to tell you it's that first quote in 65
[40:04] I heard you Roan don't worry I want to
[40:06] let you know he had a covenant with AB
[40:09] Adam the first man on earth and that
[40:11] Covenant was on conditions if you do so
[40:14] and so I'll do so and so Adam would have
[40:16] had something to do in order to keep the
[40:18] Covenant alive before God keep that in
[40:20] mind he had to do something to keep it
[40:22] alive so that means if he didn't do it
[40:25] it was dead
[40:27] amen he had to walk in God's way keep
[40:30] all of his word not breaking one word
[40:33] boy that seems
[40:35] tough it is tough do you know Israel
[40:39] went through 4,000 years of History to
[40:42] prove to you how hard that is remember
[40:47] Israel blindness in part happened to
[40:49] Israel right uh we know that uh uh the
[40:52] Paul taught us that the law came to
[40:54] teach us what was right and wrong to
[40:55] teach us us that we were in this
[40:57] condition and he sent those Israelite
[41:00] people through all of that history just
[41:02] to tell you you can't do it amen not a
[41:06] matter of work can make it into heaven
[41:10] amen he couldn't break one word if you
[41:13] broke one word it was all off woo that
[41:16] sounds oh that doesn't sound
[41:19] good aren't you glad he doesn't stop
[41:21] talking though that paragraph 30 but
[41:24] then he made another Covenant amen and
[41:28] that was with Abraham this Covenant was
[41:31] not on
[41:33] conditions amen but was unconditionally
[41:36] God gave the Covenant to Abraham no
[41:38] strings tie do it at
[41:41] all unconditional not I will I have I
[41:44] have already done
[41:46] it amen see that's that's what
[41:49] unconditional mean it means the opposite
[41:52] of
[41:54] conditions so what's the opposite of
[41:57] conditions it means no
[42:01] [Applause]
[42:04] conditions God spent thousands of years
[42:08] trying to rip conditions away from us
[42:10] and we keep adding them
[42:13] on Amen oh I'm not worried oh I can't do
[42:16] it and things like that what does an
[42:18] unconditional Covenant need it needs
[42:21] unconditional
[42:24] love do you understand if God gave you
[42:26] an unconditional Covenant that means he
[42:29] loves you
[42:33] unconditionally that's how much he loves
[42:35] you hearing is love not that we love God
[42:40] but that's how much God loved you that
[42:42] he took no conditions on the promise he
[42:45] made to you glory to
[42:49] God oh I feel like shouting amen when we
[42:52] sit here all depressed and tired
[42:54] thinking we can't make it we got to put
[42:57] it back into our hearts that there's no
[42:59] condition to This
[43:02] [Applause]
[43:05] Promise he never told Abraham
[43:08] if he told him I
[43:12] have he never told you if he told you I
[43:23] have who glory to God hallelujah
[43:26] aren't you so thankful for that that's
[43:29] what we want to talk about this morning
[43:32] this Covenant that we're talking about
[43:33] is
[43:35] unconditional but in order to receive an
[43:38] unconditional Covenant you have to be
[43:41] able to receive unconditional
[43:44] love it's so contrary to us too ain't
[43:47] it so contrary to human nature brother
[43:51] Bram says that in case you're
[43:53] wondering we always got to put something
[43:55] on it
[43:57] we always got to put a price tag on
[43:59] things
[44:01] amen think about it like this let's say
[44:04] you do one wrong
[44:06] thing okay let's say you did one wrong
[44:09] thing and you go to the Altar and say
[44:11] Lord I did one wrong thing for the next
[44:14] two weeks I won't do anything wrong
[44:19] anymore do you think those two weeks
[44:23] would get rid of that one wrong thing
[44:27] do you think all a sudden it just
[44:28] evaporates into the sky now because you
[44:30] were so
[44:31] good that it erased that bad thing you
[44:36] did of course not amen of course you
[44:40] don't do that
[44:42] amen so you see sometimes we're putting
[44:45] price tags on things that God's been
[44:48] ripping price tags off he's been he's
[44:51] been sending he's been a clearance uh
[44:54] he's been sending a clearance through
[44:55] the store
[44:57] amen there ain't no price tag on this
[44:59] it's if you want it you can have
[45:04] it you see why we're talking about this
[45:07] it's more than just knowing it's
[45:09] unconditional it's you when you pray
[45:11] it's you when you act it's you when you
[45:13] talk that you understand that the
[45:15] Covenant is
[45:18] unconditional spending so much time on
[45:20] your sins you know what I mean just
[45:22] wallowing in your sins and wallowing in
[45:24] the pain and and oh I just fail all the
[45:27] time you're wasting your time doing
[45:30] that do you understand that you are
[45:32] wasting your
[45:37] time oh I wish we stopped wasting our
[45:39] time you know what I mean redeem the
[45:42] time for the days are evil amen it's
[45:44] time to redeem our
[45:46] time you're not going to make it because
[45:49] you're better than the other person in
[45:50] the Pew this
[45:51] morning you're not going to make it
[45:53] because you are oh yeah you s in the
[45:55] same pew see and you make it a church
[45:57] every single time you're not going to
[45:58] make it because of
[46:00] that you're going to make it cuz Jesus
[46:03] saved you from your
[46:08] sins you're going to make it because of
[46:10] Jesus Amen I like that a little bit
[46:11] better amen oh that's when you start
[46:14] really understanding what it means to be
[46:16] a Christian amen I'm going to tell you
[46:18] something that's what's going to change
[46:20] you unconditional love has the power to
[46:24] change you

[46:37] different amen when you have
[46:39] unconditional love one to another for
[46:41] God is
[46:42] love and if he put no conditions on you
[46:46] how are you putting conditions on others
[46:49] well here we are I hope I get called
[46:50] next time amen here we are anyhow amen
[46:54] did you know if you you received
[46:56] unconditional love one of the evidences
[46:58] of doing that is extending it to
[47:03] others in the Lord's Prayer Amen in
[47:06] Matthew the Bible tells us forgive us
[47:09] our debts as we forgive those that are
[47:13] indebted to
[47:14] us brother b stand in perfect faith
[47:17] faith is based on
[47:19] forgiveness amen you can't believe you
[47:22] are forgiven unless you have the ability
[47:25] to extend it to somebody
[47:28] else preach it brother Steven well we're

[48:03] on forgiveness if you can't forgive you
[48:07] can't

[48:23] that's all that's doing amen aren't you
[48:26] scared people are going to do whatever
[48:27] they want nope not at all no amen you
[48:29] know why the Bible says the grace of God
[48:31] teaches us to an ey
[48:32] unrighteousness but you know what also
[48:34] the Bible says the Bible say Godly
[48:35] sorrow leadth thee to
[48:38] repentance it doesn't say
[48:42] Deliverance is Deliverance good
[48:45] absolutely is Deliverance needed
[48:47] absolutely does God give Deliverance
[48:49] 100% but you know you're still going to
[48:51] mess
[48:54] up
[48:56] if you if you could ever live your life
[48:58] without messing up why did God have to
[49:00] bring you an unconditional
[49:02] Covenant do you see think about it like
[49:05] this okay you look do you know why it's
[49:07] so hard for you to believe in
[49:08] unconditional Covenant you're always
[49:09] thinking what does God get out of
[49:12] it you're thinking oh it only benefits
[49:15] me how does it benefit God what do you
[49:16] mean how it benefits God what does God
[49:18] want then God wants you to know
[49:22] him and in order for God for you to know
[49:26] that he'll love you despite it
[49:28] all despite any condition he's still
[49:31] going to love you in order for you to
[49:33] understand that he put you in this
[49:35] situation right now so you can know him
[49:39] in the fullness of
[49:44] it that is Bible in case you're
[49:46] wondering and I'm going to scroll down
[49:48] it's in uh it's in Romans
[49:50] 5 watch this Romans 5:1 the scripture
[49:54] reads therefore being justified by faith
[49:57] do you hear that therefore being
[49:59] justified by what fath faith faith in
[50:02] who you nope mine's well you're wasting
[50:04] your time with
[50:05] that remember when Jesus cursed the Fig
[50:08] Tree they came by and said boy Jesus
[50:10] that went really quick what' he say oh

[50:14] every Sunday morning pay your ties and

[50:19] you couldn't curse fig
[50:20] tree did you oh that was actually pretty
[50:23] good wasn't it that's a lot deeper than
[50:25] even I
[50:26] realized amen he didn't say act like me
[50:29] he didn't say he didn't say like you
[50:30] know what I mean like oh it's just
[50:32] because I'm farther than you what did he
[50:34] say he said have faith in God that's
[50:38] right not in yourself that's right amen
[50:42] have faith in God and you could say to
[50:45] the tree be thou plucked up amen didn't
[50:48] mention anything you
[50:50] did just told you to have faith in God
[50:54] therefore being being justified by faith
[50:57] we have peace with God through our Lord
[51:00] Jesus Christ verse Two by whom we are
[51:04] also we have access by faith into his

[51:41] smoked he said I don't know if I can get
[51:42] baptized I still smoke he said quit

[51:51] quit looking at
[51:53] himself how you guys doing today huh
[51:57] spend some of us spend too much time in
[51:59] the mirror don't we amen looking at

[52:38] the Covenant is unconditional when he
[52:41] said it's unconditional did you know he
[52:43] meant
[52:45] that and why is it unconditional God's
[52:48] trying to show you something which is in
[52:50] this scripture here verse Two by whom

[52:54] grace wherein we stand and rejoice in

[54:54] amen
[54:56] he's never left you nor forsaken
[54:59] you amen he he never he never
[55:04] has there's no price tag on this that's
[55:07] right he paid the debt in full amen
[55:10] hallelujah quit putting a price tag on
[55:12] something he stroke it off said
[55:14] clearance it's all free this morning
[55:18] Hallelujah man this is better than five
[55:20] below amen glory to God and you get some
[55:23] pretty neat stuff there can't you amen
[55:25] but this story ain't got that's all free
[55:27] I pay for it by my blood amen you can
[55:29] walk right in the story as if you own
[55:31] the place amen the Bible says approach
[55:34] the throne of grace boldly amen you can
[55:36] walk in you can drive right up to the
[55:38] door as if you own the place amen and
[55:40] you can just get whatever you
[55:42] want there's no conditions on this
[55:48] Covenant glory to God why did he do it
[55:52] verse three Romans
[55:54] 5:3 not only so but we glory in
[55:56] tribulations also knowing that
[55:58] tribulation worketh patience patience
[56:01] experience and experience hope and hope
[56:03] making not ashamed because the love of
[56:05] God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
[56:07] Holy Ghost which is given to us do you
[56:10] understand an unconditional Covenant
[56:13] needs unconditional
[56:16] love if there was no unconditional love
[56:19] then there can't be an unconditional
[56:21] Covenant isn't that something that's
[56:23] just so neat ain't it just think about
[56:25] that for a second amen how could God put
[56:28] think about it without unconditional
[56:30] love what would God get out of it
[56:32] then he would get nothing out of it see
[56:34] and that's what you struggle with
[56:36] sometimes like I said before you're
[56:37] wondering what does God really get out
[56:38] of unconditional Covenant do you know he
[56:40] actually get something out of it you
[56:42] know what it is the Bible says in
[56:44] Hebrews 12 for the joy set before his
[56:46] face he just he endured the cross
[56:48] despising the shame what was the joy
[56:50] what we so happy about what was he going
[56:51] to get out of the
[56:53] deal Hallelujah glory to
[56:56] God wait you were that much to
[56:59] him you were that much to him hallu and
[57:03] he needed you to understand just how
[57:05] much he loved
[57:07] [Applause]
[57:08] you he needed you to understand it amen
[57:14] and in order for you to understand his
[57:16] unconditional love towards you glory to
[57:18] God he sent you an unconditional
[57:22] covenant What does covenant mean it
[57:25] means Testament what does testament mean
[57:26] it means a promise it all means the same
[57:28] thing amen it's a promise and attached
[57:31] to this promise is no strings
[57:37] attached and what does God get out of it
[57:39] you know how much he loves
[57:44] you here he's going to say it right here
[57:46] for you we're going to get to it don't
[57:49] worry I want to read verse five again
[57:51] cuz I was so good amen and hope make it
[57:53] not ashamed because the love of God is
[57:55] shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
[57:58] Ghost which is given unto us for when we
[58:01] were yet without Strength In Due Time
[58:04] Christ died for the
[58:06] ungodly he died for the ungodly ungodly
[58:09] we were not godly people were we and yet
[58:12] even in that situation he still chose to
[58:15] die for
[58:17] you it's the greatest love story ever
[58:19] told
[58:20] amen glory to God I say
[58:23] hallelujah and he sent back the Holy
[58:26] Ghost so what the love of God is now
[58:28] shed abroad in
[58:30] [Applause]
[58:33] you so he did get something out of
[58:36] this he's actually benefiting from
[58:39] loving you you remember something this
[58:42] amen love is extremely
[58:45] subjective amen we all love different
[58:47] things you know I got girls at home and
[58:49] so forth like that I got a family sure I
[58:51] can love you but I don't love you like
[58:52] my family why it's Rel relationship
[58:55] based it's subject based and things like
[58:57] that and other people look at this book
[58:58] and go that's a god of
[59:01] love those are pretty funny accent I
[59:03] didn't mean to do that that's a god of
[59:05] love matter of fact I'll give you a
[59:08] little uh you know um Oprah riff me I
[59:11] don't mean I don't mean to mention
[59:12] celebrities and so forth but you know
[59:14] she she was actually raised in a Baptist
[59:16] Church in Chicago matter of fact her mom
[59:19] wanted to name her orpa from The Book of
[59:21] Ruth but she misspelled it and mixed the
[59:24] p and the H so that's why she's named
[59:26] Oprah renfrey okay and she said one time
[59:31] the reason why she doesn't believe in
[59:32] God anymore because she was reading her
[59:34] Bible and she found out God could be
[59:36] jealous and she's like wait a minute God
[59:38] could be jealous well wait a minute I'm
[59:41] can get jealous and she attached
[59:43] humanality or like that kind of a
[59:45] thinking how could God be like me
[59:48] hallelujah how could a God be like me
[59:51] and that's what took her away she read
[59:53] the same book you did right amen and
[59:57] she's thinking how could that be the god
[59:59] that loves how could that be somebody
[1:00:02] that loves me I'm insignificant he can
[1:00:04] be I'm looking at him as being so much
[1:00:06] greater and like this false image of God
[1:00:09] the Bible talks about Frost Christ
[1:00:11] another gospel amen that's good but when
[1:00:15] you read it what's happening the Holy
[1:00:17] Ghost is showing you something and
[1:00:19] what's the Holy Ghost showing you how
[1:00:21] much he loves you oh I say he in this
[1:00:25] love not that we love God but God loved
[1:00:28] us
[1:00:30] amen that's the whole point of
[1:00:33] [Music]
[1:00:35] it oh hallelujah oh I tell you what
[1:00:38] that's when you really start getting
[1:00:39] some victory in your life when you start
[1:00:42] believing in an unconditional love in
[1:00:44] your
[1:00:50] life oh my goodness see it's so anti us
[1:00:54] is isn't it this flesh this flesh wants
[1:00:57] to do something remember kades barer
[1:00:59] brother mam told us that was the
[1:01:01] greatest failure the Israelite people
[1:01:03] had is when they wanted to attach a
[1:01:05] price tag to
[1:01:08] Grace he said Grace took them out of
[1:01:10] everything Grace gave him a prophet
[1:01:12] Grace took him out of Egypt Grace split
[1:01:14] the Red Sea Grace fed him Grace took
[1:01:16] everything Grace Grace Grace Grace
[1:01:18] Grace but then they added a price tag to
[1:01:21] it amen and that's what was their big is
[1:01:25] failure amen you know what church I say
[1:01:28] we start believing in an unconditional
[1:01:33] love here he's going to say it right
[1:01:35] here for you I really want to get to the
[1:01:37] end of this because I want to tell you I
[1:01:38] ain't making anything up amen it's right
[1:01:41] here don't wor he's going to say it for
[1:01:42] us
[1:01:44] amen verse six for when we were yet
[1:01:48] without Strength In Due Time Christ died
[1:01:50] for the
[1:01:52] ungodly for scarcely for a righteous man
[1:01:55] one will die yet pre- adventure for a
[1:01:58] good man some would even Dare To Die see
[1:02:00] you could believe something like that
[1:02:02] somebody was an okay kind of
[1:02:05] guy you know what I mean somebody was
[1:02:07] just
[1:02:08] average you know what I mean people
[1:02:09] would probably die for him some you will
[1:02:12] probably die for somebody who you know
[1:02:14] took care of their bill one day helped
[1:02:17] them out or something like that somebody
[1:02:19] would probably die for some of these why
[1:02:21] cuz it's treating it like a
[1:02:23] favor hey amen so that's what he's
[1:02:25] saying right here oh sure for a good man
[1:02:28] who did me good one time I'd probably
[1:02:30] die for him he was good to me and I like
[1:02:33] you know I like him a little bit amen so
[1:02:36] that's what he's saying right here for
[1:02:39] scarcely a righteous man one would die
[1:02:41] yet pre- Aventure for a good man someone
[1:02:42] even Dare To Die verse eight but God
[1:02:45] commanded his love towards us so what is
[1:02:48] God trying to do trying to convey to you
[1:02:51] what his love extent is amen oh brother
[1:02:56] stepen though why do I have to go
[1:02:57] through all this maybe because God's
[1:02:58] trying to show you his love towards
[1:03:01] you are you going to believe it or
[1:03:04] not oh but brother Stephen I've been
[1:03:06] dealing with this besetting sin for
[1:03:07] years yeah you probably have so have
[1:03:10] I amen we all got problems I was tell
[1:03:14] brother over here it's a nice thing I
[1:03:16] say where there's people there's
[1:03:22] problems people love drama too Heen just
[1:03:26] being real with you for a second all
[1:03:28] right people love that stuff don't think
[1:03:30] we're immune to it either all right
[1:03:32] right listen I've been around church
[1:03:34] folk way too long for you to trick me
[1:03:35] all
[1:03:37] right I know I know that's true okay
[1:03:43] amen I'm GNA get in trouble I hope
[1:03:45] brother Samuel calls me
[1:03:49] again where there's people there's
[1:03:51] problems guess what church you're going
[1:03:53] to have problems
[1:03:55] they ain't going to go away anytime
[1:03:57] soon they're probably going to get a
[1:03:59] little worse as we keep going on Church
[1:04:01] said amen they probably are going to get
[1:04:03] a little
[1:04:04] worse so you see even in this condition
[1:04:07] though God had somehow prove to you just
[1:04:09] how much he loved you then and how he's
[1:04:11] going to do it if you put a price tag on
[1:04:12] it then how far does his love go right
[1:04:16] does he only love you when you were
[1:04:20] good think about it how would you know
[1:04:23] if if if that was the case how would you
[1:04:25] know how far his love went amen how
[1:04:29] would you know unless you did something
[1:04:32] wrong how would you know right here but
[1:04:36] God
[1:04:37] commanded his love towards us in that
[1:04:40] while we were yet
[1:04:42] sinners Christ died for
[1:04:46] us oh I say hallelujah and I said Thank
[1:04:49] You
[1:04:52] Jesus Paul one time said I'm the
[1:04:54] chiefest of
[1:04:56] Sinners amen and you know what I kind of
[1:04:58] know what he's talking
[1:05:00] about I feel like that sometimes too can
[1:05:03] you say
[1:05:05] Amen sometimes you feel like the worst
[1:05:08] failure I've been there
[1:05:11] amen you you wonder yourself sometimes
[1:05:14] and you go how did I do this again you
[1:05:16] know what I mean you ever you ever been
[1:05:18] like that and listen it ain't just the
[1:05:20] bad stuff like smoking and drinking I'm
[1:05:22] not even talking about it anymore and
[1:05:24] tell you know how sometimes we waste
[1:05:25] time oh I'm going to go preach I hope
[1:05:27] you don't mind amen but you know like
[1:05:30] Social Media stuff and things like that
[1:05:32] it can be such a
[1:05:33] whirlpool and you just drown right into
[1:05:35] it right amen and you go I was on an
[1:05:39] hour of it somehow you wonder yourself
[1:05:41] how did I go it's almost like you enter
[1:05:43] an eternity on your phone how does that
[1:05:46] happen said brother Stephen what are you
[1:05:48] talking about I'm preaching from
[1:05:50] experience I do it too amen I get a I
[1:05:54] get a thought and I look up YouTube
[1:05:56] documentaries on
[1:05:57] it and then guess what YouTube's got to
[1:06:00] let me know hey if you like that you
[1:06:01] like this those stupid algorithms don't
[1:06:04] you hate them then you like that then
[1:06:07] you watch that you watch that all a you
[1:06:09] go where did all the time
[1:06:12] go you know what I mean and you didn't
[1:06:14] even pray that day you know what I mean
[1:06:17] and your heart just breaks a little bit
[1:06:19] and then you start
[1:06:21] spiraling well well I didn't pray what
[1:06:24] point of trying
[1:06:28] now but God commanded his love towards
[1:06:34] [Applause]
[1:06:35] us even think about it he died for you
[1:06:39] before you were even worried about
[1:06:41] it think about it why you know why you
[1:06:44] warpool like that and why you get
[1:06:45] depressed and then you don't even pray
[1:06:47] anymore because you're like I didn't
[1:06:48] pray this time what's the point of even
[1:06:50] asking you know why you end up in there
[1:06:53] is because you you do care about what's
[1:06:56] happening oh and see Satan's such a
[1:07:00] Slicker get you to think there's no
[1:07:02] point in trying might as well not even
[1:07:03] go to church that Sunday morning you
[1:07:05] know how bad I
[1:07:06] was listen I know this stuff is real yes
[1:07:09] sir that Devil is a Slicker and you know
[1:07:12] why you're down in that warpool though
[1:07:13] it's because you actually do care
[1:07:14] otherwise it wouldn't affect
[1:07:17] you listen before I got saved I listen I
[1:07:20] got saved when I was 23 years old okay
[1:07:23] before I was saved I cuss like a sailor
[1:07:25] of course I did that's what the world
[1:07:27] did so I did it all the
[1:07:29] time but guess what when I got saved
[1:07:32] though and I wanted to do it right guess
[1:07:33] what I still cuss
[1:07:36] sometimes I still did for a little bit
[1:07:38] there I still cussed there was one
[1:07:40] difference though I heard it every
[1:07:44] time I heard it every time I did
[1:07:48] it and I and and I started caring about
[1:07:51] me
[1:07:52] cussing now you see so then what did it
[1:07:55] do it made me want to overcome it can I
[1:07:58] say this then have you begun in the
[1:08:00] spirit are you now made perfect in the
[1:08:02] flesh tell me when that doesn't change
[1:08:04] in your
[1:08:05] life oh you sit there you go I failed
[1:08:08] today there's no point in trying what
[1:08:09] happened no you have to understand you
[1:08:12] are loved
[1:08:15] unconditionally despite all your faults
[1:08:18] you hearing me
[1:08:19] Church despite what you think about
[1:08:22] yourself God thinks differently about
[1:08:27] you and you need to start believing
[1:08:29] Romans 5A God commanded his love to you
[1:08:32] in that before you even cared about it
[1:08:35] he died for
[1:08:36] [Applause]
[1:08:40] you oh Hallelujah I say thank you
[1:08:43] Jesus praise the Lord
[1:08:47] God now you have to say you don't even
[1:08:50] have to you don't even have to guess
[1:08:51] about
[1:08:52] it even before you cared about it he
[1:08:56] died for you anyways and now that you do
[1:08:58] care about it you think he's going to
[1:09:00] stop loving you all of a sudden you know
[1:09:02] what I mean did his unconditional
[1:09:04] Covenant just change for you now all of
[1:09:05] a sudden even before you knew it even
[1:09:08] before you cared he still died for you
[1:09:11] anyways hallu Hallelujah you know you
[1:09:14] know uh Jesus one time said you know we
[1:09:16] got you know we got sheep here
[1:09:18] referencing Israel he said but I got
[1:09:19] another flock waiting for me and I
[1:09:22] butchered a little bit you go look up
[1:09:24] for yourself amen he said I got another
[1:09:26] flock waiting for me you know who that
[1:09:27] other flock was you and
[1:09:30] me he was thinking of us there too you
[1:09:33] are just as a real in God's thought and
[1:09:35] you think he all a sudden you know God
[1:09:37] can't learn a thing new oh praise the
[1:09:39] Lord
[1:09:40] Jesus you know God can't come up with a
[1:09:43] new
[1:09:45] thought so you know when he thought of
[1:09:48] you when he said I have another sheep my
[1:09:52] sheep hear my voice
[1:09:54] who heard the voice I know I
[1:09:59] did amen and so when he thought of you a
[1:10:01] sheep did you know he can't change his
[1:10:02] mind about you
[1:10:06] Hallelujah why don't you stop thinking
[1:10:08] your thoughts start thinking God's
[1:10:11] thoughts I think that's a better idea
[1:10:13] don't you
[1:10:14] think brother B in the church St book
[1:10:17] our thoughts aren't like God's thoughts
[1:10:18] you know he said that you know he said
[1:10:21] our thoughts are not like God's thoughts
[1:10:23] why do we spend so much time on our
[1:10:24] thoughts then you know what I mean
[1:10:26] brother we waste so much time in our
[1:10:28] thinking don't we waste so much time in
[1:10:30] our thoughts and we have these thoughts
[1:10:33] and then we start believing them and you
[1:10:34] go what what did I
[1:10:36] do how did I know more about it than
[1:10:41] this how did you know more about it than
[1:10:44] this
[1:10:46] did there's a brother there's a person
[1:10:49] one time said the Bible's more than just
[1:10:52] true it's actually pretty cool way of
[1:10:54] saying it I love this thought so much he
[1:10:56] said the Bible is more than just the
[1:10:58] truth he said it's the precondition for
[1:11:00] truth what does that mean it means this
[1:11:04] uh you know this day and age we got
[1:11:05] crazy people out there nowadays who
[1:11:07] can't even figure out which bathroom
[1:11:08] they go in you know what I
[1:11:10] mean and let's say you get those two
[1:11:13] people in the in the same room and I
[1:11:15] think you know what I think boys can
[1:11:16] become girls and girls can become boys
[1:11:18] and they're sitting across from each
[1:11:20] other one person says you know I think
[1:11:22] boys can become girls and girls can
[1:11:23] become become boys and the other person
[1:11:25] says you know what I think you're right
[1:11:26] I think boys can become girls and girls
[1:11:28] can become boys and they look at each
[1:11:30] other and they agree with each other and
[1:11:32] then they walk away who's to say they're
[1:11:35] wrong who's to say they're wrong they
[1:11:38] disagreed with each other didn't they
[1:11:41] they just looked at each other and said
[1:11:42] you know I think that's a good idea I
[1:11:43] think that's a good idea they agreed
[1:11:44] with each other boom they're right how
[1:11:46] do we know they're
[1:11:47] wrong it's because you know more about
[1:11:49] it than them well maybe you do maybe you
[1:11:52] don't but this says something
[1:11:55] different this said they're not there's
[1:11:58] a
[1:12:00] distinction you know how that perversion
[1:12:02] came I'm going to tell you something
[1:12:03] listen Church there's a reason why you
[1:12:04] sisters wear
[1:12:06] skirts there's a reason why you sisters
[1:12:08] are called to be
[1:12:10] ladies we thought they thought during
[1:12:12] the 20s it was just oppression upon you
[1:12:15] they thought in the 20s that that what
[1:12:17] with the suffrage movement and what
[1:12:19] started this whole thing about women can
[1:12:21] be you know work in the workforce like
[1:12:22] men and and then cut their hair and wear
[1:12:25] like garments like men and so forth they
[1:12:27] thought the reason why they were in that
[1:12:29] condition was because they were being
[1:12:30] oppressed and so they wanted be like men
[1:12:33] and now look what we have
[1:12:34] today they don't know which bathroom to
[1:12:36] go in now they're saying you can be
[1:12:39] gender fluid and all this garbage where
[1:12:40] did it come from that Spirit started
[1:12:43] from somewhere there's a reason why
[1:12:45] brother Brandon preached it there's a
[1:12:47] reason why we preach a clothline
[1:12:49] religion you hear me Church listen I
[1:12:52] could care less about getting getting
[1:12:53] all social up with the world and so like
[1:12:56] that we don't spend time with the world
[1:12:57] we preach the gospel and brother bham
[1:12:59] said if you ain't preaching a clothline
[1:13:00] religion you ain't preaching the gospel
[1:13:04] why was it so important cuz look what
[1:13:06] they have in the world
[1:13:09] now
[1:13:11] amen oh my look at the perversion we
[1:13:13] have and so forth like that where did it
[1:13:15] come from it's when people got out of
[1:13:18] their
[1:13:19] position amen and that's why brother
[1:13:21] Bram had a preacher can you say
[1:13:24] amen that's why it's okay for a man to
[1:13:27] be a man and a woman to be a
[1:13:32] woman this is more than just
[1:13:36] right this is the precondition for you
[1:13:39] to be
[1:13:41] right amen how do I know I'm right it's
[1:13:44] because this said it before you
[1:13:48] did how was I right when I told you
[1:13:51] about unconditional love it's because
[1:13:53] Hebrews 5'8 was written before I said
[1:13:58] it when I said it then you read it
[1:14:01] that's the precondition of what I just
[1:14:04] said and brother Brandon said when you
[1:14:06] put the word upon your mouth is the same
[1:14:08] as deity
[1:14:10] speaking glory to God and
[1:14:14] Hallelujah this is the precondition for
[1:14:18] deity
[1:14:20] amen and it's the same thing with you
[1:14:24] when you put the word upon your mouth
[1:14:27] and that said you could say it then stop
[1:14:30] thinking your
[1:14:32] thoughts and start believing what he
[1:14:35] said
[1:14:36] [Applause]
[1:14:38] amen who I say praise the Lord
[1:14:40] hallelujah I'm having a good time in the
[1:14:42] house of the Lord
[1:14:45] [Applause]
[1:14:46] amen God wanted you to have an
[1:14:49] unconditional Covenant and the reason
[1:14:52] why is so you could understand his
[1:14:56] unconditional love watch what brother
[1:14:59] Bram
[1:15:00] said I'm going to that quote and
[1:15:02] identify Masterpiece of God paragraph 69

[1:16:26] see the love of God after man had fallen
[1:16:29] and deliberately opened the door to the
[1:16:31] enemy and come in and Mar him and set
[1:16:34] death to him still God was not willing
[1:16:36] this to be defeated still God was not
[1:16:39] willing to be defeated he came down and
[1:16:41] started all over again he was going to
[1:16:44] make that man
[1:16:45] again he put Adam on a covenant do this
[1:16:48] and not this this and not that touch not
[1:16:52] handle not taste not but we find out

[1:17:01] unconditional
[1:17:03] Covenant oh I tell you what that's how
[1:17:06] he started him on an
[1:17:09] unconditional Covenant do you know the
[1:17:12] things that happened to Abraham was not
[1:17:14] for him alone did you know that you know

[1:18:40] got to thinking I just read in the
[1:18:42] scripture that the second death will not
[1:18:43] hurt
[1:18:44] me and I got to thinking one night this
[1:18:47] is about 2:30 in the morning I work

[1:19:03] excited that night I started running up
[1:19:06] and down that weld shop right by my
[1:19:09] machine just shouting praising the Lord

[1:24:31] it's not even the big
[1:24:32] things you know what I mean it's
[1:24:34] sometimes it's just the cares of Life
[1:24:36] get in the
[1:24:36] way you know what I mean God help us can
[1:24:40] you say can you say amen God commended
[1:24:43] his love towards
[1:24:45] us and that while we were yet
[1:24:48] sinners Christ died for the
[1:24:51] ungodly
[1:24:53] ain't that a great scripture oo I hope
[1:24:56] we think about that throughout this week
[1:24:57] amen you remember put that in your heart
[1:24:59] amen when you're struggling God
[1:25:02] commended his love towards
[1:25:05] me even before I cared he
[1:25:08] did oh
[1:25:10] Hallelujah I hope you can I hope I hope
[1:25:13] you can feel the sermon heart this
[1:25:15] morning that that this unconditional
[1:25:18] Covenant it was God does get something
[1:25:21] out of it you're you're not wasting
[1:25:23] God's time believing in an unconditional
[1:25:24] Covenant you see you make it so like
[1:25:28] it's it's it's your human nature that's
[1:25:30] getting in the way of believing it it's
[1:25:32] your human nature that wants to put a
[1:25:34] price tag on things it's getting in the
[1:25:36] way of you really entering into this
[1:25:39] thought that you are going to make it in
[1:25:41] a Rapture not on anything you've done
[1:25:46] amen but because he commanded his love
[1:25:50] towards
[1:25:51] you and that's why you're going to make
[1:25:54] that's why you're making it
[1:25:55] now that's why you're going to make it
[1:25:57] 10 minutes from now 20 minutes from now
[1:26:00] that's why even when you don't pray
[1:26:01] sometimes you're still going to make
[1:26:04] itall even when you're failing God don't
[1:26:07] worry God ain't failing you God
[1:26:09] commanded his love towards
[1:26:12] you that's why we're talking about this
[1:26:14] to get this really in our heart can you
[1:26:17] see the love of
[1:26:21] God I'm so sorry to keep jumping on you
[1:26:23] guys back there identify Masterpiece
[1:26:26] again I want to go to paragraph
[1:26:30] 71 but we find out when he started again
[1:26:34] he started with Abraham and Abraham he
[1:26:36] started him an unconditional covenant
[1:26:39] not if you will I have I've already done
[1:26:42] it I've blessed you and you and your
[1:26:45] seed do we got an Abraham seed in here
[1:26:48] you know you are right in case you're
[1:26:51] wondering it remember this is the
[1:26:53] precondition of Truth before I said it
[1:26:55] did you know in Galatians 3:16 and 29 it
[1:26:58] already called you Abraham seed so
[1:27:01] before I called you Abraham seed before
[1:27:03] I said it this already said it about
[1:27:06] you amen so you didn't just become
[1:27:08] Abraham SE because I said it just now
[1:27:10] that's right you were already that
[1:27:13] before you heard it just now this is the
[1:27:15] precondition of
[1:27:18] Truth Lord so you are you are Abraham's
[1:27:22] seed
[1:27:24] amen not if you will I have I've already
[1:27:28] done it I blessed you in your seed and
[1:27:30] so forth after you it was an
[1:27:32] unconditional Covenant he started with
[1:27:35] Abraham you know what if you forgive me
[1:27:37] who praise the Lord I just feel good
[1:27:39] this morning amen I keep looking at that
[1:27:41] clock getting a little nervous but then
[1:27:43] I look at my notes and I get excited
[1:27:45] again I love you guys so much amen this
[1:27:48] is great amen you love the Lord amen you
[1:27:51] love the Lord
[1:27:58] I'm going to read one more quote and
[1:27:59] we'll be done this morning but I want to
[1:28:01] read this quote and it's kind of a long
[1:28:02] one amen it's an unconditional Covenant
[1:28:04] that God made with his with his people
[1:28:06] in 54 brother back
[1:28:08] there paragraph 174 but if you got the
[1:28:12] Holy Ghost you're God's child you're
[1:28:15] Abraham's seed you got an unconditional
[1:28:18] Covenant Written In Your Heart by God
[1:28:20] Almighty self who can't take it back oo
[1:28:24] I say thank you Jesus he can't take it
[1:28:26] back he can't take me back Sorry Lord
[1:28:29] amen Here I Am Lord I'm just giving you
[1:28:31] all can I give you a little suggestion
[1:28:33] don't hide from
[1:28:34] God you're bad at
[1:28:40] it do you know how bad you at hiding
[1:28:42] from God guess what nobody can amen you
[1:28:45] can't really hide from God you might be
[1:28:47] able to hide from me might be able to
[1:28:49] hide from Mommy and Daddy might be able
[1:28:51] to hide from the Pastor you ain't hiding
[1:28:53] from
[1:28:54] God so when you go to God don't hold
[1:28:57] your baggage in your back bring all your
[1:28:59] baggage with
[1:29:01] you cast all your care upon him for he
[1:29:05] carth for
[1:29:07] [Applause]
[1:29:08] you you know what I mean you you know
[1:29:11] what I mean I think you know what I mean
[1:29:12] amen spend too much time giving God your
[1:29:16] religion you're wasting your time bring
[1:29:19] your baggage you got problems you know I
[1:29:21] have person one time told me if you're
[1:29:23] having trouble with a brother in a
[1:29:24] church or a sister in a church you know
[1:29:25] what he told me to do I said it's kind
[1:29:27] of hard to love him and he said fake it
[1:29:29] till you make
[1:29:33] it can I give him my opinion about that
[1:29:35] I think that's some of the worst advice
[1:29:37] you could ever give
[1:29:39] anybody do you know
[1:29:41] why and and it's because God never faked
[1:29:44] it till he made
[1:29:45] it I'm not saying ain't going to be hard
[1:29:48] sometimes what I'm saying is though you
[1:29:49] got to be real with God cuz you ain't
[1:29:51] hiding from God anyways he knows you
[1:29:52] ain't actually liking that person so
[1:29:55] tell God about it tell God you know use

[1:31:39] work I'm talking about when you're deal
[1:31:41] dealing with the unbelievers I'm talking
[1:31:43] about real life that's when you're going
[1:31:45] to need this right
[1:31:47] here
[1:31:49] amen okay Lord have mercy I'm going to
[1:31:51] really try to get through this
[1:31:54] quote who can't take it back amen he
[1:31:56] sore that he would do it Hallelujah he
[1:31:58] sings Every promise in the every promise
[1:32:01] in the Bible is mine every chapter every
[1:32:03] verse every line I am trusting in his
[1:32:06] love
[1:32:07] divine every promise in the book is
[1:32:11] mine God's children
[1:32:14] unconditionally you don't deserve your
[1:32:16] healing tonight ain't that something to
[1:32:19] say I love how brother Bron breaks into
[1:32:22] this this is such this is real right
[1:32:24] here I oh man something about how he
[1:32:25] says it sometimes can you say Amen that
[1:32:28] man was a prophet of God Amen the way he
[1:32:31] say things sometimes my goodness he hits
[1:32:33] you right to your
[1:32:34] core don't forget to hear his voice can
[1:32:37] you say Amen Church make sure you get in
[1:32:39] those tapes sometimes you're going to
[1:32:40] need it amen God sent you a meage behold
[1:32:42] I send you Elijah the prophet before the
[1:32:44] coming of the great and Dreadful day the
[1:32:45] Lord uh listen he didn't send
[1:32:48] me I had somebody asked me that one time
[1:32:52] say What's the difference between you
[1:32:53] saying it and brother bandam saying it I
[1:32:55] said' that's easy I'm not Malachi
[1:32:59] 4 what what are you talking about he
[1:33:01] said behold I send you Elijah the
[1:33:02] prophet that's William Brandon that's
[1:33:03] Malachai 4 he fulfilled I didn't fulfill
[1:33:06] that scripture amen I'm just quoting
[1:33:08] what he said that's my position in the
[1:33:11] right hand of him that sits upon the
[1:33:12] throne with Seven Stars it's not seven
[1:33:15] plus
[1:33:20] you
[1:33:22] listen it's okay to have a prophet
[1:33:24] listen he ain't Jesus don't worry about
[1:33:25] it we're not praising him you know he
[1:33:27] needed Jesus just as much as we needed
[1:33:29] Jesus he even said
[1:33:31] that look he's even going to say it
[1:33:33] right here now I think about it he does
[1:33:34] say something in this quote that's
[1:33:35] pretty good he said God's children
[1:33:38] unconditionally you don't deserve your
[1:33:39] healing tonight there's not a one of us
[1:33:42] in here deserves to even hear the gospel
[1:33:45] there's not a one of you deserves the
[1:33:47] grace of Jesus Christ my my my none of
[1:33:51] us we're all together well I guess that
[1:33:54] includes brother brandom amen but God by
[1:33:57] Grace has did it
[1:33:59] anyhow thank you Jesus even when we
[1:34:01] didn't deserve it he did it
[1:34:04] anyhow that's right there's none of us
[1:34:06] of you deserve your healing every one of
[1:34:08] you ought to die me
[1:34:11] too all of us we're not deserving to
[1:34:13] live on the earth that's right we're not
[1:34:15] deserve we're not deserving to look on
[1:34:17] God's creation ver paragraph 176 but God
[1:34:21] has promised us and he cannot
[1:34:24] lie he swore that he would do it healing
[1:34:28] belongs to us
[1:34:30] amen salvation belongs to us amen the
[1:34:34] Holy Ghost belongs to us Heaven belongs
[1:34:37] to us now we're the sons of God now
[1:34:41] we're sitting in Heavenly places in
[1:34:42] Christ Jesus there's nothing that can
[1:34:45] harm
[1:34:46] us ain't that something you didn't
[1:34:48] deserve it but he did it
[1:34:50] anyhow
[1:34:53] oh my that makes me feel I think I said
[1:34:55] it a while back that makes me feel like
[1:34:57] a million bucks

[1:37:37] a little insight into this okay he said
[1:37:40] Stephen you ain't
[1:37:43] stupid he said Stephen you're not
[1:37:46] dumb why don't you go in there put your
[1:37:49] head in the game and do it
[1:37:52] and I said I don't know Dad I don't know
[1:37:54] I don't know if I can do it or not he's
[1:37:56] like Stephen of course you can do it you
[1:37:58] got two hands and a brain
[1:38:00] right get in there and go get it done I
[1:38:04] got off the phone with my dad you know
[1:38:06] what I
[1:38:07] said I ain't dumb am
[1:38:10] [Laughter]
[1:38:14] I and I went back to work and I started
[1:38:17] working in those air meters my whole
[1:38:19] attitude changed
[1:38:22] all the anxiety and guess what I fix
[1:38:24] some air meters that
[1:38:26] [Laughter]
[1:38:28] day now I said that to tell you this if
[1:38:31] my Earthly father could change my
[1:38:34] attitude what about your heavenly
[1:38:36] father's
[1:38:42] words I'll end with this as I call the
[1:38:44] musicians up let me end with
[1:38:47] this what are those words you see you
[1:38:50] see why a lot of times we get
[1:38:52] depressed do you see why time sometimes
[1:38:55] we just get bummed out sad do you see
[1:38:58] why it happens sometimes it's not
[1:39:00] because of the
[1:39:02] situation it's not because of the
[1:39:04] situation you're in you hearing me
[1:39:06] church I hope you're hearing me it's not
[1:39:08] because of that why are you getting down
[1:39:09] and I'm saying sometimes I know there's
[1:39:11] remember the Bible even says there is a
[1:39:12] time to be
[1:39:14] sad so it's okay to be sad sometimes but
[1:39:17] a lot of times why we get depressed and
[1:39:18] listen there's a difference between
[1:39:20] sadness and depression
[1:39:22] oh you you go pray about that at home
[1:39:23] amen that's a whole sermon amen we're
[1:39:26] not going to say for another couple
[1:39:27] hours I won't do that to you but that's
[1:39:29] a pretty good thought amen you go take
[1:39:30] that home and pray there is a difference
[1:39:32] between sadness and
[1:39:34] depression why are you getting depressed
[1:39:36] all the time
[1:39:38] anxiety nervousness why does it happen
[1:39:41] it's not because of your situation
[1:39:44] right is that you have forgotten what he
[1:39:49] said Peter said said stir your minds by
[1:39:53] the way of remembrance remembering what
[1:39:56] what he
[1:40:00] said God commanded his love towards
[1:40:04] us in that while we were yet
[1:40:08] sinners Christ died for
[1:40:11] us can you can you put yourself in the
[1:40:14] word this morning Christ died for me
[1:40:18] while I was yet a sinner
[1:40:21] Christ looked at me and called me a
[1:40:25] joy remember this church and I got a
[1:40:28] whole I got another sermon on this when
[1:40:31] he was in that Garden in consent me you
[1:40:33] remember Jesus didn't want to go to
[1:40:35] Calvary right that's
[1:40:38] right you remember this Jesus was a man
[1:40:40] just like you and me the only difference
[1:40:43] he was the fullness of the godhead
[1:40:44] bodily in him but did you know he had
[1:40:46] the same nerve endings as you I mean
[1:40:48] look look at your hands you say how your
[1:40:50] hands have five fingers on each hand did
[1:40:52] you know Jesus's hands had five fingers
[1:40:53] on him
[1:40:55] too you know he had five toes on each
[1:40:58] foot you know he had two
[1:40:59] legs he was just like
[1:41:02] you and when he started praying in that
[1:41:04] Garden the Bible says he started
[1:41:05] sweating blood and what did he pray for
[1:41:09] he prayed for the cup to pass from him
[1:41:12] yes
[1:41:12] sir he prayed for the opposite of God's
[1:41:19] will but held them there think about it
[1:41:23] all of God's Jesus's human
[1:41:26] emotions wanted to separate from
[1:41:29] Calvary but something kept him
[1:41:33] there what kept him there I'll let you
[1:41:37] know remember this said it before me I
[1:41:39] can tell you what kept him there it's in
[1:41:41] Hebrews 12 1 and
[1:41:44] 2 the Bible says for the joy set before
[1:41:47] his faceall he endured the cross
[1:41:51] despising the
[1:41:55] shame what held him there it wasn't his
[1:41:59] feelings it was you that held him
[1:42:02] there oh can I just say something that's
[1:42:06] why we can worship him this
[1:42:10] morning God commanded think about it
[1:42:13] what you held him there in all your
[1:42:17] sins in all your faults
[1:42:21] all your mistakes he still called you a
[1:42:27] joy that's how much you were
[1:42:31] worth

[2:09:17] Lord
[2:09:19] oh Lord Jesus thank you Lord for this
[2:09:21] time in your Holy Ghost oh God you spoke
[2:09:24] so beautifully to us this morning
[2:09:28] lord lord it's amazes to me how you can
[2:09:31] use the broken up words or or flesh of
[2:09:35] this this it's just so amazes
[2:09:37] me how the ministry of your word works
[2:09:42] sometimes using this body of
[2:09:45] clay using these words sometimes these m
[2:09:48] messed up
[2:09:49] words but Lord there's something special
[2:09:51] about it God that we can all feel in our
[2:09:53] hearts Lord be myself included Lord I
[2:09:56] want to thank you God this morning for
[2:09:59] your unconditional love Lord I looked
[2:10:01] when I read that quote I I felt like I
[2:10:03] was saying about myself I don't deserve
[2:10:05] healing Lord I didn't deserve any of
[2:10:10] this Lord I even feel like I don't even
[2:10:12] deserve these people or or people to
[2:10:14] listen to me I don't deserve it Lord but
[2:10:17] you did it any how God and no doubt we
[2:10:21] can all look at our own personal lives
[2:10:23] and we go Lord I didn't deserve you to
[2:10:25] take away that fault but you did it
[2:10:28] anyhow I deserved to reap what I sowed
[2:10:31] but you didn't do it
[2:10:33] anyhow and Lord God I want to receive
[2:10:36] that into my heart this morning Lord
[2:10:39] God I want to walk it talk it think it

[2:10:47] towards me God proved his love towards
[2:10:50] me I don't have to work for it anymore
[2:10:52] but I can just receive it into myself oh

[2:11:03] times all alone by myself I will
[2:11:07] remember that I'm never truly
[2:11:09] [Music]
[2:11:12] alone but God commended his love towards
[2:11:15] me unconditional love
[2:11:18] and I am now a partaker of an
