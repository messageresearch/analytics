[35:34] how many is happy in the lord this
[35:35] morning
[35:37] amen
[35:39] it's a good day to be a christian amen
[35:41] praise the lord i don't know if
[35:43] maybe some of you don't know me but i'm
[35:45] just brother ronnie he's gonna have my
[35:46] wife with me i don't know where she's at
[35:48] somewhere in here blending in but
[35:52] amen
[35:55] praise the lord
[35:57] i just got a text from
[35:58] brother samuel who said greet the church
[36:00] for him
[36:01] it's kind of opposite usually it's me
[36:04] greeting
[36:05] sending greetings to him to greet his
[36:07] church
[36:09] but praise the lord so we're praying
[36:11] that the lord used him mightily where
[36:12] he's at and
[36:14] that
[36:15] maybe that last soul would be there to
[36:16] hear the quickening of the word amen and
[36:18] we could be caught up we might see him
[36:20] sooner than we think
[36:22] amen if you have your bibles this
[36:24] morning turn to the book of luke
[36:28] the fourth chapter
[36:46] i forgot my
[36:48] glasses off to squint to read the
[36:50] scripture but i think i can enlarge the
[36:52] song after that
[36:56] and the 17th verse and there was
[36:58] delivered unto him
[37:00] the book of the prophet isaias and when
[37:02] he had opened the book he found the
[37:04] place where it was written
[37:06] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[37:08] because he hath anointed me to preach
[37:10] the gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[37:13] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[37:15] deliverance to the captives and
[37:17] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[37:20] at liberty them that are bruised
[37:22] to preach the acceptable year of the
[37:24] lord
[37:25] and then he closed the book
[37:27] and he gave it again to the minister and
[37:29] sat down
[37:30] and the eyes of all of them that were in
[37:32] the synagogue were fastened on him
[37:34] and he began to say unto them this day
[37:37] is this scripture fulfilled
[37:40] in your ears
[37:41] father we thank you lord for this
[37:43] opportunity just to open your word this
[37:45] morning lord we just ask that you would
[37:47] lord just anoint it so father that it
[37:50] would be a fresh manna to our to our
[37:52] ears and our hearts this morning lord we
[37:54] just ask that the lord your quickening
[37:56] power would come and just activate that
[37:58] that seed inside of us father that we
[38:00] could
[38:01] just have communion with you this

[38:23] hearts and you would just
[38:24] lord allow us to step aside of this
[38:27] temporal age that we're in lord and just
[38:28] step into eternity for just a moment

[38:50] amen amen you may be seated
[38:53] uh just a few minutes today i just want
[38:56] to talk about inspired by his presence
[38:59] and so when you're walking in the word
[39:00] and there's those moments in your in
[39:02] your walk where sometimes you're just
[39:04] walking but then you get inspired that
[39:06] you're at the right the right place at
[39:08] the right time and you're doing the
[39:09] right thing in the right season and the
[39:12] right word and everything just lines up
[39:14] correctly i believe the bride's coming
[39:16] into that phase of of the walk where
[39:18] we're realizing that we're walking in
[39:20] step with the word and we're becoming
[39:23] inspired that that it's not just a word
[39:25] a fable or just a story but it's a
[39:28] living reality of what we're walking
[39:30] through it's a manifested word in this
[39:33] hour and i know that those are those are
[39:35] key phrases that we hear all throughout
[39:37] the the message and all throughout the
[39:39] the preachers have been preaching it for
[39:41] 20 or 30 years the manifested sons of
[39:43] god and the son of man ministry and all
[39:46] these key phrases but i believe we're
[39:48] walking in step with those promises that
[39:51] were promised to come but now
[39:53] there's something different in the air
[39:54] now there's a season of victory that we
[39:56] can see that that we're just over the
[39:59] next hill i believe there's there's
[40:00] victory there and i think the bride and
[40:02] whole is realizing
[40:04] that this promise is not for another day
[40:07] we're not waiting for something else to
[40:09] come we're not waiting for another
[40:10] revival or another messenger or another
[40:13] age but we are at the final age we have
[40:17] heard the final word we are the final
[40:19] voice in the final age to to finish the
[40:22] work which he started
[40:24] i believe we're all all in agreement
[40:26] there that we're not waiting for
[40:28] something i don't think that we're we're
[40:30] looking ahead for if just this could
[40:32] come i remember growing up in the church
[40:34] as a kid you'd always think ahead well
[40:36] one day
[40:37] this is gonna happen one day there's
[40:39] gonna be a bride's revival or one day
[40:41] and that was so maybe 25 years ago but
[40:44] that time has come and i believe we're
[40:46] walking in the bride's revival i believe
[40:48] this is what what we're seeing today
[40:50] this is the revival of the bride
[40:53] it'll be a short quick work it's
[40:55] promised that it would come and it would
[40:56] activate hearts and there would be uh
[40:59] the the the divine healing restored to
[41:02] the church and the gifts restored to the
[41:03] church and and the word being preached
[41:06] in purity back to the church that's how
[41:09] it restores our hearts back to the faith
[41:11] of our fathers
[41:12] is when the word is restored and so
[41:14] jesus himself
[41:16] had to recognize that he was walking in
[41:18] the perfect will of his father when he
[41:20] was taken up on the mountain and he was
[41:22] tempted by the devil and he was tempted
[41:24] in the three temptations and we could
[41:26] preach a while on that but i think we
[41:27] probably all
[41:29] know know where that that that that
[41:31] ended up it is also written
[41:33] it is also written so he knew that the
[41:35] only way he could defeat him was by the
[41:37] word so that we may use that as an
[41:39] example of how we defeat him is by the
[41:42] word and so jesus taken up there on the
[41:44] mountain he he recognizes that he's
[41:46] walking in the perfect step
[41:49] of the will of god and he walks
[41:51] immediately down to the temple he has
[41:53] the scribe he hat takes this the scribes
[41:55] from the from the preacher and he opens
[41:57] up to the book of isaiah and he finds
[41:59] himself where he's at currently
[42:02] in the word now he could have turned to
[42:04] psalms and he could have read my bones
[42:06] they stare at me that's that's him but
[42:08] that's not where he was at that time
[42:11] so he could have identified himself in
[42:13] the word but he had to identify himself
[42:15] in the exact day that he was walking in
[42:19] so he opens the scripture and he shows
[42:21] this is where i'm at right now this day
[42:24] is this scripture fulfilled in your ears
[42:27] this day and so he closes the book he
[42:30] hands it back to him but then again we
[42:31] find that book open in the book of
[42:33] revelations right it's in the hand of
[42:35] the angel and it's an open book it's no
[42:38] longer closed and we know that he didn't
[42:40] finish that entire scripture if you go
[42:42] back to isaiah 61 as where he was
[42:45] reading from the spirit of the lord god
[42:46] is upon me because the lord hath
[42:48] anointed me to preach good tidings into
[42:50] the meek he has sent me to bind up the
[42:52] brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the
[42:54] captives and the opening of the prison
[42:56] to them that are bound
[42:58] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[43:00] lord
[43:01] and the day of vengeance of our god to
[43:03] comfort all that mourn
[43:06] now i i think as a child i remember
[43:09] reading the rest of that scripture well
[43:10] he didn't finish it because that's a
[43:12] scary scripture the vengeance of the day
[43:13] of our god but actually if you take that
[43:15] word vengeance back in the greek it
[43:18] means vindicated
[43:20] it it translates right back to
[43:22] vindicated and if you take vindicated
[43:24] back and look it up in the dictionary it
[43:25] means to set free so he's following the
[43:27] same context to set free them that are
[43:30] bound
[43:31] that's what the word does it's not to
[43:33] it's not to establish one man over
[43:35] people or or to build a kingdom over
[43:38] here or to build it a a creed over there
[43:41] but it's to set free them that are bound
[43:43] you know in the scripture here he talks
[43:45] about uh uh bringing liberty to them
[43:47] that are bruised
[43:49] you know a lot of times in church we can
[43:51] we can get bruised
[43:53] a lot of times in ministry we can get
[43:55] bruised you can get hurt as just a
[43:57] church member going to church and get
[43:58] bruised no doubt if we've been
[44:00] if we've been in church any amount of
[44:02] time we wouldn't have to pass the mic to
[44:03] ask that everybody in here has been hurt
[44:05] at some point we've been we've been
[44:07] damaged we've been we've been we've been
[44:09] sore we've been afraid we've been and
[44:11] you know what's what's funny about a
[44:12] bruise is if you get a bruise on you
[44:14] know i've had a bruise in my rib and and
[44:16] just by by human nature you begin to
[44:19] protect that
[44:20] and and you'll walk and you'll walk kind
[44:22] of different and you you you have your
[44:24] arm over that bruise because it hurts
[44:26] and it may be the ruse has disappeared
[44:28] for months and months and maybe years
[44:30] but you still protect that
[44:32] you know and so we've built up a complex
[44:34] maybe around that bruise that we've
[44:36] suffered and it was a real hurt and it
[44:38] was a real thing and you know but it's
[44:40] changed the way that we walk it's
[44:42] changed the way that we enter into
[44:43] service it's changed the way that we
[44:45] that we receive from the lord and we
[44:47] begin to cover ourselves
[44:50] where we've been bruised
[44:53] but this day
[44:54] this scripture is fulfilled that he set
[44:57] liberty to them that are bruised that we
[44:59] can walk freely that we don't have to
[45:01] protect that we don't have to guard
[45:03] ourselves but this word is a pure word
[45:06] that we know exactly where we're walking
[45:08] step in step with this word we're not
[45:10] guessing we're not we're not we're not
[45:12] speculating but we know exactly what his
[45:14] word said and we're walking in perfect
[45:16] step with it he's come to set at liberty
[45:19] them that are bruised i'm thankful for
[45:21] that because i don't have to walk
[45:22] unassured of where i'm going or walk in
[45:24] fear that i might get hurt again or i
[45:27] might be damaged by somebody but i know
[45:29] the word and i know what he wants done
[45:31] with it and i'm walking step in step
[45:34] with what he's promised for it to come
[45:36] to pass
[45:37] this day
[45:38] this scripture is fulfilled brother bran
[45:41] would say first the prophet goes to god
[45:43] and the word comes down and he wrote it
[45:45] in the bible and now that was god's four
[45:47] ordained plan the prophet saw
[45:49] and he wrote it in the word so that the
[45:51] people following would be warned of
[45:53] situations and things to come see now by
[45:55] inspiration
[45:57] that word was spoke by god by
[46:00] inspiration
[46:02] that word was spoken by god the prophet
[46:04] brought it and by inspiration we have to
[46:07] receive it
[46:09] so by inspiration god spoke it
[46:12] by inspiration the prophet received it
[46:15] and by inspiration we have to receive it
[46:18] it's not a a mental conception of it or
[46:21] it's not a theological conception of it
[46:24] but it's by
[46:25] inspiration is the only way we'll
[46:27] understand
[46:29] all that god was important to christ and
[46:31] all that christ was he poured into the
[46:33] church we'll never understand that by an
[46:35] intellectual conception of it but it's
[46:37] by inspiration only
[46:40] this is the plan of god he says and this
[46:42] book is none other than about than the
[46:44] bible and the author of it is not an
[46:46] inventor
[46:47] he's none other than creator himself who
[46:50] promised divine healing he wrote the
[46:52] book he inspired it
[46:54] and it's god's inspired word
[46:58] later down he would say now if if if god
[47:00] who made the bible who wrote the bible
[47:04] the bible is inspired god's word do you
[47:06] believe that
[47:07] do you believe that with all your heart
[47:09] all right it's god's inspired word then
[47:12] if it's god's inspired word
[47:14] then the inspiration of god is here with
[47:17] us to make this word live to prove that
[47:20] he's here
[47:22] surely you can receive him is that right
[47:25] so it's by inspiration he wrote it let
[47:28] me just maybe just slow down a minute
[47:29] here by inspiration he wrote it
[47:32] and so by inspiration he'll reveal it
[47:35] jesus had to find where he was at at
[47:37] that exact moment in time to identify
[47:40] the inspiration of god of that moment
[47:43] this day is this scripture fulfilled in
[47:45] your ears so we've got to recognize what
[47:47] day are we walking in what's happening
[47:50] right now in the word of god to identify
[47:52] where we're at in this plan of god
[47:55] i believe that there's more prophecies
[47:57] about this end time bride than there is
[47:58] about any other people that have ever
[48:00] come before about any other pro
[48:02] prophecy that there ever was prophesied
[48:04] about there's been more about this
[48:07] oncoming bride than there ever has been
[48:09] before there's more sure words about us
[48:12] than there ever was before i believe we
[48:14] should be the most assured anchored
[48:16] people it's by inspiration
[48:19] i cannot talk you into it i cannot
[48:21] explain into it i cannot power point you
[48:23] into it but it's by inspiration that you
[48:26] receive this message in this hour this
[48:30] day this scripture is fulfilled in your
[48:32] ears it's not for another day another
[48:34] time another people but it's right now
[48:37] in this time we are walking in perfect
[48:39] step with the word
[48:41] so if we receive the word and perfect
[48:43] step in this time then we get all of the
[48:46] benefits that come with it i believe
[48:48] we've lived underneath our privileges
[48:50] for for our entire lives but now we are
[48:53] recognizing we are walking with the word
[48:55] and with the word comes the benefit of
[48:58] the word
[49:00] we should not be walking in depression
[49:02] or anxiety or fear or or or or anxious
[49:05] about tomorrow we should know exactly he
[49:08] holds us in his hand he's holding
[49:10] tomorrow we may not get tomorrow but
[49:12] he's holding it anyway
[49:15] we may we're not promised to walk out of
[49:16] this building but he's holding us anyway
[49:19] we're so sure that we're walking in the
[49:21] perfect plane of god that even if he
[49:23] slay me i'll trust him
[49:25] even if he takes me today i'll trust him
[49:27] we're walking in the planet this day
[49:30] this scripture is fulfilled in our ears
[49:34] not somebody else but our ears
[49:36] we're walking in the perfect plan of god
[49:38] by
[49:39] inspiration
[49:41] when able by inspiration come no beauty
[49:44] but he come in inspiration he had no
[49:47] bible to tell him it was a lamb but god
[49:49] revealed it to him
[49:50] it was a lamb no inspiration to tell him
[49:53] that it wasn't cain said well now
[49:55] reasoning it's a fruit they must have
[49:57] eat apples i'll bring fruits as an
[49:58] offering and jehovah will receive this
[50:00] because it looks better
[50:02] than what that would be so jehovah will
[50:04] receive this and today the people think
[50:06] the same thing
[50:08] but it's got to be by inspiration
[50:11] it's not how well we dress right it's
[50:14] not how well our our our hair matches
[50:16] our tie or
[50:19] our car how shiny it is or our
[50:22] our rims are shined up and god doesn't
[50:24] care lick about any of that he's not
[50:26] worried about how you look or if you're
[50:28] if you've got glasses if you don't got
[50:30] glasses if you're balding if you've got
[50:31] plenty of hair god's not looking at any
[50:33] of that he's looking for the inspiration
[50:36] at that time to catch his word of where
[50:38] we're standing at this hour
[50:41] we've got to recognize we're moving in
[50:43] flow with the word we're in harmony
[50:46] we're in synchronization with the word
[50:48] where there's there's abs and there's
[50:49] flows and there's valleys and there's
[50:51] mountains but you've got to recognize
[50:53] where are we at now in this plan of god
[50:57] we're not looking for another another
[50:58] source
[50:59] we're not looking for another wave i'm
[51:01] not i'm not looking for a plan b or a
[51:03] way out or somewhere else to run to but
[51:06] i found my refuge i found where my hope
[51:09] is placed i found that mighty tower that
[51:12] i can run into and be saved i found that
[51:14] plan of god that i can walk step in step
[51:17] with
[51:18] it's by this vindicated word of the hour
[51:20] that we recognize we are walking in step
[51:23] with the word
[51:25] we're not looking for something else
[51:27] we found the main source remember
[51:29] brother branham would talk to demas
[51:30] shakuri and back in the 60s and he would
[51:32] tell them there's oil out there in
[51:34] kentucky
[51:35] and they would say oh well where where
[51:36] is it exactly say well it's right there
[51:38] but i'm not going to tell you exactly
[51:39] where it's at because it's not for
[51:41] commercial use
[51:42] this gift is not so you can benefit
[51:44] yourself and and raise a kingdom unto
[51:47] yourself and and so they packed up by
[51:49] the inspiration of the prophet and they
[51:51] they packed up all their equipment and
[51:52] he got some business partners and he
[51:54] goes out to kentucky and he drills down
[51:57] and he hits oil
[51:59] he said oh the prophet was right look
[52:00] we've hit oil
[52:02] but brother branham said they only
[52:03] tapped into a small reserve
[52:06] they didn't hit the main source he said
[52:09] they began to drill oil wells all over
[52:11] that place and they got oil and they
[52:12] were making money and then their their
[52:14] their motive and objective became a
[52:16] reality and they began to steer off of
[52:18] the word
[52:19] they began to build kingdoms unto
[52:21] themselves and argue over money or argue
[52:23] over control and brother bam said those
[52:25] little tributaries that they had hit
[52:27] began to to run out
[52:29] you see they were pulling from one
[52:31] another those tributaries and it's just
[52:32] like a man getting close to the word
[52:35] he's getting close around this message
[52:37] but he taps in he gets a little oil a
[52:39] little gifts in the church a little a
[52:40] little healing takes place maybe a gift
[52:42] of knowledge or a gift to preach and
[52:45] he'll tap in close to that word but
[52:47] eventually that oil will run out
[52:50] because he's not tapped into the main
[52:52] source
[52:53] but brother bam says so that the
[52:55] prophecy would be true not more than a
[52:57] hundred yards from where they originally
[52:59] drilled another company came along later
[53:01] and drilled right there and they struck
[53:03] the main vein
[53:06] you see it's right there we're just men
[53:08] have for years have been dancing around
[53:10] the main source they wanna they drill
[53:12] into it they get a little life coming
[53:14] out and then they begin to denominate
[53:15] amongst themselves they begin to they
[53:17] denominate and you build a kingdom unto
[53:19] themselves but they're right next to the
[53:21] main vein
[53:23] and that main vein begins to draw its
[53:25] oil back into it and that that that
[53:27] temporary well will run dry
[53:29] that well drilled over here and that
[53:30] well drilled over there you see it had
[53:32] life it had the real oil at one time but
[53:35] it began to run dry
[53:37] but that main vein will never run dry
[53:39] brother brahms said that back in that
[53:41] day he said it would produce 1100
[53:44] barrels of oil in a half a day
[53:47] i like that because if even if the 11th
[53:49] hour worker can come into this door he
[53:51] can tap into that main vein he can
[53:53] receive the same benefits that those of
[53:56] us have been tapped into in our whole
[53:57] life the same benefits 1100 barrels a
[54:00] day tapped into that main source we're
[54:02] not looking for anything else
[54:04] this oil is not running out
[54:06] i can't speak for others that have
[54:08] tapped into a temporary source that and
[54:10] then we find ourselves at the gate and
[54:12] they're asking me for oil but you've got
[54:14] to be tapped into the main vein already
[54:16] you've got to have the source already
[54:18] we're not looking for another source we
[54:20] found the main source
[54:22] we found the main vein of inspiration
[54:24] we're not looking outside this word this
[54:27] is where our hope comes from
[54:29] the devil would like to tell you to tap
[54:31] into this ism and tap into that schism
[54:33] but this is the main vein
[54:35] if it doesn't line up with the word i
[54:37] don't want it it might be close to it it
[54:39] might have a little life in it it might
[54:41] show signs but the only the main vein
[54:44] will have oil when the time comes
[54:47] we must know where our roots are tapped
[54:50] we've got to be tapped into the message
[54:51] of the hour
[54:53] if we're not we'll run dry if we're at
[54:55] some man and he might be proclaiming to
[54:57] preach the message but if we're tapped
[54:58] into a man he'll run dry
[55:01] we've got to be in the word we've got to
[55:03] be tapped into the only sure thing to
[55:05] know that this is the day we're living
[55:07] in
[55:08] all other things will run dry but only
[55:11] this main source
[55:13] will continue to have life
[55:16] but sometimes that oil gets clogged up
[55:18] with our own selves we might be tapped
[55:21] into the main vein and we might have our
[55:23] own our own log of tradition in the way
[55:26] we've got to blow it out brother ram
[55:27] says you did you drill a hole in the
[55:29] stump and you put a piece of dynamite in
[55:30] there and you blow it out that's how you
[55:32] get that logger tradition let the oil
[55:34] flow he said we call that prospecting
[55:36] you've got to dig it out so that that
[55:38] main vein can flow through
[55:41] sometimes we wonder well what do i have
[55:42] to do with this if the words already
[55:44] flowing and the the promises are already
[55:46] coming and i just don't seem to be in
[55:48] flow with it what do i do you've got to
[55:50] blow the logs of tradition out of your
[55:52] life
[55:53] just blow it out
[55:55] well i just don't act that way or i
[55:57] don't well maybe you should worship
[55:58] differently than you've ever worshipped
[56:00] before
[56:01] maybe you should do something that
[56:02] you've never done before for the lord
[56:04] maybe you should reach out in another
[56:06] realm that you've never reached out for
[56:07] me maybe you should pray that prayer
[56:09] that you've never prayed before and
[56:11] watch the lord move and activate when
[56:13] you blow that log out of your way the
[56:16] oil's there we've just got to clear it
[56:17] out but the ramp said bore those holes
[56:19] in the ground dig them out set dynamite
[56:21] blow it down keep on blowing shafts
[56:23] going down till we find it till we find
[56:26] the main vein
[56:28] and tonight we're trying to take the
[56:29] word of god
[56:30] and use it by the power of the holy
[56:31] spirit to blow all the indifference and
[56:34] doubts away from us all those little
[56:36] light fluffy things that just doesn't
[56:38] have any foundation doesn't have any
[56:40] weight in our life we want to blow it
[56:42] all out of the way so we can find this
[56:44] glorious vein
[56:46] that vein is christ
[56:50] to think that brother branham was
[56:51] preaching to a people that were not even
[56:53] there yet
[56:55] he was preaching to an audience of
[56:57] people that were that weren't even on
[56:59] the scene yet just earlier this week a
[57:01] brother sent to a to a a chat pictures
[57:04] of of where brother branham had preached
[57:06] in in kentucky and it was a big
[57:08] amphitheater with rows of metal
[57:10] bleachers and where he had preached
[57:11] there and i was sitting there looking at
[57:13] picture thinking i doubt if any of them
[57:15] got what he was preaching
[57:18] he preached 19 services in a row there i
[57:20] think it was clarksville 19 services in
[57:22] a row there and i doubt if if if just
[57:25] five of them got what he was preaching
[57:27] in fact he said if i could just get five
[57:29] good men
[57:30] we could turn this world upside down
[57:31] nobody got what he was preaching at the
[57:33] time and and then men use that now to
[57:35] say well when he preached the seventh
[57:36] seal he said you don't have to believe
[57:38] it just just live a good christian life
[57:40] you know you'll never understand this
[57:42] but just live a good that was for the
[57:44] people sitting there
[57:46] but he knew that there was a people to
[57:48] come that would understand what he was
[57:50] preaching
[57:51] that would receive what he was preaching
[57:53] that he knew by prophetic utterance that
[57:56] we would receive that word in
[57:58] inspiration in the right time and he
[58:00] would say this day is this scripture
[58:03] fulfilled in your ears
[58:05] it was not fulfilled when isaiah i first
[58:07] said it jesus had to identify at the
[58:09] time that it was fulfilled now we are at
[58:12] the time when that prophetic word is
[58:14] being fulfilled through the bribe
[58:18] there will be an understanding of it but
[58:20] abraham says when it fell upon luther it
[58:22] manifested that promise of that hour
[58:25] when it fell upon wesley it manifests
[58:27] the promise of that hour when it falls
[58:29] in this day it manifests the promise of
[58:32] this hour when it falls upon moses it
[58:34] manifests the promise of that hour you
[58:36] see he's he's showing us how the word
[58:38] works in the pattern
[58:41] fell upon noah manifest the promise of
[58:43] that hour when it fell upon jesus it
[58:45] manifests the promise of that hour see
[58:47] it's the holy spirit coming down to
[58:49] quicken
[58:50] make a lie those those people that's
[58:53] foreordained of god to be in the rapture
[58:56] notice that is if he is a true eagle he
[59:00] will understand the message of the hour
[59:03] if he's a true eagle
[59:06] i don't believe it says that this isn't
[59:08] for you and you'll never understand it
[59:09] or it'll always be something that you
[59:11] can't attain but he said if you're a
[59:13] true eagle you will understand the
[59:16] message of what i'm preaching to you
[59:18] this day this scripture will be
[59:20] fulfilled in your ears
[59:23] you will understand it he says in the
[59:25] message paradox so therefore we know
[59:27] that luther could not get it wesley and
[59:29] so forth and reformers knox finney
[59:31] calvin
[59:32] and down so forth they did not get it
[59:34] all but what they had was the gospel
[59:36] truth but now
[59:38] somebody say now
[59:40] in the last days we are given the
[59:43] understanding by the word that we are
[59:46] going to understand it
[59:50] now somebody say now
[59:52] we are given the understanding by the
[59:55] word that we will understand what the
[59:57] prophet was preaching to the elect
[1:00:01] i say that's me i say amen to every word
[1:00:04] of god i say i'm walking in step with
[1:00:07] the message
[1:00:08] [Music]
[1:00:10] this is our day this day this scripture
[1:00:13] is fulfilled
[1:00:15] amen
[1:00:16] in calvin's ears in finney's ears no in
[1:00:18] your ears this day
[1:00:21] we're inspired by the presence that the
[1:00:23] word is in this hour
[1:00:25] we know the
[1:00:26] word we're inspired to walk in it in
[1:00:30] season in time in pace don't get ahead
[1:00:33] of it don't get behind it walk in pace
[1:00:35] with the word
[1:00:37] hallelujah i don't wanna drop your brand
[1:00:38] new mic
[1:00:42] praise the lord
[1:00:44] we were so in tune with it
[1:00:46] this harmony is now to exist between the
[1:00:49] groom
[1:00:50] and his bride
[1:00:52] he shows her his word of life
[1:00:54] she receives it i like that line she
[1:00:57] receives it
[1:00:59] she never doubts it
[1:01:00] therefore nothing can harm her not even
[1:01:04] death for if the seed be planted the
[1:01:07] water will raise it up again here is the
[1:01:10] secret of this the word is in the bride
[1:01:14] as it was in mary
[1:01:18] i like that little parentheses there
[1:01:19] because it gives us an action of what
[1:01:21] we've got to do the word is in the bride
[1:01:23] as it was in mary and what did mary do
[1:01:26] when the angel said this day the
[1:01:28] scriptures fulfilled she said beat unto
[1:01:30] me according to thy word
[1:01:33] be it unto me
[1:01:35] this day i'll receive that promise be it
[1:01:38] unto me we've got to have the faith like
[1:01:40] that to recognize whose presence are we
[1:01:42] in
[1:01:43] who's come in the room today who is what
[1:01:45] we've invited him to come and we're
[1:01:47] surprised when he's here we've got to
[1:01:49] recognize we're in the presence of the
[1:01:51] one who can change our circumstance
[1:01:54] we're in the presence of the one who can
[1:01:56] break our cycle who can bring healing to
[1:01:58] the body who can bring that that
[1:02:00] prodigal back home we're in the presence
[1:02:02] of the one who can activate the seed
[1:02:04] inside of us i say be it unto me
[1:02:07] according to that promises
[1:02:11] this day is this scripture fulfilled in
[1:02:13] your ears
[1:02:15] we've got a part to play we say be it
[1:02:17] unto me
[1:02:19] the bride has the mind of christ for she
[1:02:23] knows
[1:02:24] what he wants done with the word
[1:02:28] we know what he wants done with the word
[1:02:29] we've sat here service after service
[1:02:32] we've been preached to we've studied at
[1:02:33] home we've listened to tapes in the car
[1:02:35] we know what he wants done with the word
[1:02:38] we've got to do it
[1:02:40] we've got to take what we know and apply
[1:02:42] it to action to put it into action
[1:02:45] god's plan moving through a bride moving
[1:02:47] through lips moving through feet moving
[1:02:49] through hands
[1:02:51] manifested sons of god
[1:02:54] that's what the plan of god is
[1:02:57] she knows what he wants done she
[1:02:59] performs the command of the word in his
[1:03:02] name
[1:03:04] i like this right here why for she has
[1:03:07] thus saith the lord
[1:03:12] i was preaching this one time this quote
[1:03:14] a man came up to me said well that's
[1:03:15] brother vale's book i said well you'll
[1:03:16] find the same exact quote in spoken word
[1:03:19] as the original seed which brother ran
[1:03:21] him utter with his own voice and he said
[1:03:23] she has thus saith the lord
[1:03:27] the power is in the bride it's no longer
[1:03:30] in one man or back 65 years ago the
[1:03:33] power is in the bride
[1:03:36] to use it to make manifest the works of
[1:03:38] god in this age
[1:03:42] that's why we believe what we believe
[1:03:43] it's not just a set of rules or conduct
[1:03:46] or a way to live a life but the power of
[1:03:48] the almighty god is in his bride
[1:03:53] somebody say it's in me
[1:03:55] it's in me
[1:03:58] why would god take the time to come down
[1:04:00] and manifest himself into vessels if we
[1:04:03] were just going to sit there and let
[1:04:05] that oil
[1:04:06] idle there
[1:04:08] but he came down and he anointed us with
[1:04:10] power so that we might perform the
[1:04:12] command of the word if they lay their
[1:04:15] hands on the stick
[1:04:16] [Applause]
[1:04:19] if they say unto this mountain and do
[1:04:21] not doubt in their heart
[1:04:23] if they take me out my word it shall be
[1:04:26] done unto them the power is laying in
[1:04:29] the bride in this hour this scripture is
[1:04:33] fulfilled
[1:04:35] not waiting for something
[1:04:37] not waiting for a big man to come back
[1:04:39] it's already in the bride
[1:04:41] [Applause]
[1:04:44] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[1:04:46] and it comes to pass like a seed that is
[1:04:48] planted in water that comes to full
[1:04:50] harvest serving its purpose
[1:04:53] aren't you glad to know you got a
[1:04:54] purpose
[1:04:57] that's the biggest lie of the devil i've
[1:04:59] ever heard that you don't have a purpose
[1:05:02] you know we we sit through i've been
[1:05:03] through a few meetings this year and sat
[1:05:05] through a few prayer lines and i can
[1:05:06] tell you most of our young people
[1:05:08] struggle with if they have a purpose
[1:05:10] what a lie from the devil
[1:05:12] that god would come and manifest himself
[1:05:14] and open himself unto a people and then
[1:05:17] the devil would get in there and say you
[1:05:18] don't have a purpose
[1:05:20] you have a greater purpose than anyone
[1:05:22] that's ever walked this earth
[1:05:26] you are the final voice to the final age
[1:05:30] you are the one that gets to kick them
[1:05:32] in the lake of fire if the young people
[1:05:34] want to know what their purpose is they
[1:05:37] are the ones that bind him with the
[1:05:39] chain of circumstance to say you have no
[1:05:41] room to work here any longer i'm not
[1:05:44] your slave but i know where i'm going
[1:05:46] i'm walking in step with the word you
[1:05:50] may never hold a microphone in your hand
[1:05:52] that doesn't matter you've got to walk
[1:05:54] in step with the word and bind satan
[1:05:58] in his own territory
[1:06:00] but the man said we bind him by not
[1:06:02] giving him any room to work with
[1:06:06] let the holy ghost do the work tap into
[1:06:08] the main vein
[1:06:09] serving its purpose
[1:06:12] those in the bride do only his will no
[1:06:15] one can make them do otherwise they have
[1:06:17] thus saith the lord or they keep still
[1:06:20] they know that it has to be god in them
[1:06:24] doing the works
[1:06:26] god in them doing the works
[1:06:30] that's what we're witnessing we're not
[1:06:32] witnessing a decrease this message is
[1:06:34] not weak we're not backed up in a corner
[1:06:36] if i could just sit down with you i can
[1:06:38] keep you for hours just telling you of
[1:06:39] the testimonies from this year on
[1:06:42] i've seen more miraculous this year than
[1:06:44] i have in my entire life put together
[1:06:46] god is on the move he's doing something
[1:06:50] he's making a way for something he's
[1:06:53] activating our faith for something
[1:06:58] you're pastors in mexico i was in mexico
[1:07:01] here a few weeks ago and the lord came
[1:07:03] down in a supernatural way
[1:07:05] i could take the time to tell you but
[1:07:07] we'll get to talk about it over there
[1:07:09] we'll have ten thousand years to cover
[1:07:12] just one trip but the lord was so mighty
[1:07:15] in battle there i saw i saw the instant
[1:07:17] healed
[1:07:18] which is amazing to see a thyroid gland
[1:07:20] just decrease and the symptoms disappear
[1:07:23] i saw a hernia just just go back inside
[1:07:26] somebody's body i i saw i saw the this
[1:07:29] crippled old man just get up and shout
[1:07:30] and run around the church and all that's
[1:07:32] amazing but what's what's more what's
[1:07:35] more magnificent to me is the spiritual
[1:07:38] healing that god will do
[1:07:40] you know a doctor might come in and
[1:07:42] repair a hernia
[1:07:43] a doctor might come in and give you a
[1:07:45] good injection of antibiotics and one
[1:07:47] who is sick might get up and walk
[1:07:50] but when the lord comes in and begins to
[1:07:52] heal
[1:07:53] bruised hearts
[1:07:55] when he begins to heal those broken
[1:07:57] parts those those places where a doctor
[1:08:00] can't touch a a minister can't touch a
[1:08:02] counseling can't touch certainly a
[1:08:04] psychologist can't touch
[1:08:06] when the lord comes in and begins to to
[1:08:09] administer to those needs
[1:08:11] it begins to rewire a heart
[1:08:13] and you see a cold stony heart begin to
[1:08:16] get adjusted to the word of god and he
[1:08:18] begins to come in and just change the
[1:08:20] situation that's a supernatural work to
[1:08:22] me
[1:08:23] when i see the lord moving in action and
[1:08:26] taking someone who is just a regular
[1:08:29] church member sitting there their whole
[1:08:30] life and making them on fire for god
[1:08:32] like they've never known him before to
[1:08:34] me that's this scripture being fulfilled
[1:08:38] in our ears
[1:08:39] and it's only by the word it's him in
[1:08:42] them doing the works
[1:08:46] tell me what man's hands are clean
[1:08:48] enough to lay on the sick that they
[1:08:49] might be healed
[1:08:50] you won't find one
[1:08:52] tell me what man is clean enough that he
[1:08:54] could go into counseling and counsel
[1:08:56] someone and unlock that spirit out you
[1:08:58] won't find one but it's christ in them
[1:09:01] doing the works
[1:09:03] that's why when we find a god-led man
[1:09:05] that allows christ to work through him
[1:09:07] we can we can march step and step with
[1:09:09] that man we can put shoulder to shoulder
[1:09:11] with that it's christ in him doing the
[1:09:14] works
[1:09:16] it's christ and your mama doing the
[1:09:18] works it's christ in your daddy doing
[1:09:20] the works
[1:09:21] it's christ in you
[1:09:23] doing the works
[1:09:24] that's why we can walk in this word
[1:09:28] he's fulfilling his own word
[1:09:31] he did not complete all his work while
[1:09:33] in his earthly ministry so now he works
[1:09:37] in and through the bride
[1:09:39] it's a powerful quote when you get ty
[1:09:41] really go back and read this he did not
[1:09:43] complete his works while he was here on
[1:09:45] earth so now his reputation his name
[1:09:49] everything that he is all of his power
[1:09:51] all of his strength is resting on the
[1:09:53] bride
[1:09:56] it's you
[1:09:57] it's me we're walking with the word we
[1:10:00] have thus saith the lord
[1:10:06] or we keep still
[1:10:08] by his word it's him and us
[1:10:11] doing the work
[1:10:14] he works through his bride she knows
[1:10:16] that for it was not yet time for him to
[1:10:19] do certain things that he must now do
[1:10:24] but he will now somebody say now
[1:10:27] he will now fulfill through the bride
[1:10:29] that work which he left for this
[1:10:32] specific time
[1:10:34] don't tell me that you don't have a
[1:10:36] purpose to fulfill he left it all
[1:10:38] resting on our shoulders
[1:10:41] him in us resting on our shoulders to
[1:10:44] fulfill that which he left for this age
[1:10:47] this specific time
[1:10:50] tell me what other what other generation
[1:10:52] was left to have a body change
[1:10:54] tell me what other generation was left
[1:10:56] to get so quickened by the word that
[1:10:58] they would change the very elements of
[1:11:00] their mortal body where they become so
[1:11:02] quickened by the word that they would
[1:11:04] get caught up
[1:11:06] in two heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:11:09] into another dimension tell me what
[1:11:11] generation was left with that commission
[1:11:15] you have a greater purpose in your life
[1:11:18] [Applause]
[1:11:22] it's us
[1:11:23] this commission is for you it's for
[1:11:26] those that believe in this day
[1:11:29] this scripture is fulfilled and there
[1:11:31] are some standing here which shall not
[1:11:34] taste of death for they will be changed
[1:11:37] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:11:40] caught up
[1:11:42] by what the commission of the word we
[1:11:44] have thus saith the lord there will be a
[1:11:47] body change
[1:11:49] now tell me what would get the bride so
[1:11:52] hot in the word that she would actually
[1:11:54] take a body change there would have to
[1:11:56] be a short quick work ahead of that
[1:11:58] there would have to be the miraculous in
[1:12:00] the faith building and and just another
[1:12:03] level of anointing
[1:12:05] i don't know about you but i think we're
[1:12:06] experiencing another level of anointing
[1:12:08] in this hour
[1:12:10] if you're where you were five years ago
[1:12:12] you better find the lord today you've
[1:12:14] got to continue in step with the word
[1:12:18] we're in perfect harmony the bride and
[1:12:20] the bridegroom walking step in step
[1:12:24] hand in hand
[1:12:26] he says the time is at hand the time was
[1:12:29] not previously at hand
[1:12:31] and the wisdom and economy of of god in
[1:12:33] this mighty revelation
[1:12:35] could not come forth thus we immediately
[1:12:38] learned the revelation of god for each
[1:12:40] age can come in that age only
[1:12:44] and at a specific time
[1:12:47] look at the history of israel the
[1:12:48] revelation of god to moses came only at
[1:12:50] a specific time
[1:12:52] of history and even more specifically it
[1:12:54] came as the people cried unto god
[1:12:58] jesus himself came at the fullness of
[1:13:00] time he being the complete revelation of
[1:13:02] the godhead and in this age
[1:13:06] somebody say this age
[1:13:08] the revelation of god will come in its
[1:13:11] due time it will not falter neither will
[1:13:14] it be premature think on this and heed
[1:13:17] it well for we are in the end time today
[1:13:22] i don't think you have to wonder if
[1:13:23] we're in the end time
[1:13:25] we are in the end time today we see so
[1:13:28] many of the prophecies coming to pass in
[1:13:30] the king of the north on the move and
[1:13:32] wars and rumors of wars and pestilence
[1:13:35] in the land and and and and lovers of
[1:13:37] them own cells
[1:13:39] naked wretched blind and knoweth it not
[1:13:42] murders and suicides at an all-time high
[1:13:45] we see that we're at the end time
[1:13:48] so if all of the negative is coming to
[1:13:50] pass
[1:13:52] if all that all of those prophecies
[1:13:54] about that world is coming to pass how
[1:13:56] about our prophecy as the bride of god
[1:14:01] that she'll grow stronger that she'll
[1:14:03] get deeper as she'll get higher and
[1:14:06] she'll get more in love with him than
[1:14:08] she was yesterday that's our promise
[1:14:12] [Applause]
[1:14:14] i keep falling in love with him why we
[1:14:18] can't help it
[1:14:19] he's pulling us he's drawing us higher
[1:14:22] there's something in us that he's
[1:14:24] anchored to
[1:14:26] and he's drawing us through another
[1:14:27] plane
[1:14:28] even when we don't feel like it he's
[1:14:30] drawing us to another plane even when we
[1:14:33] don't realize that he's drawing us to
[1:14:35] another plane even we don't see the
[1:14:37] changes he's drawing us to another plane
[1:14:39] he's raising us up in faith for what the
[1:14:43] final capstone ministry
[1:14:46] his reputation is resting on this bride
[1:14:50] to think that god
[1:14:53] i'm in construction when i put my name
[1:14:55] on the project i think about every
[1:14:57] detail of that project because my name
[1:14:59] is on the permit
[1:15:01] i'm responsible
[1:15:03] if that project fails i'm responsible if
[1:15:05] it looks like garbage i'm responsible
[1:15:07] for it
[1:15:08] my name's on the project
[1:15:12] you know sometimes we'll go we'll go to
[1:15:14] a project and we'll look at it we'll say
[1:15:16] no this house is it's got shaky
[1:15:18] foundation and the first thing we check
[1:15:21] is the foundation
[1:15:22] we'll look around that house and think
[1:15:24] no it's it's not real you know it's
[1:15:26] bulging here and you've got you've got
[1:15:28] some falling here and the walls going
[1:15:29] out here and they must not laid the
[1:15:31] foundation right or it's just too old or
[1:15:34] it's just been sitting here too long and
[1:15:36] we you know we end up just walking away
[1:15:37] from the project no it's not worth
[1:15:39] taking on we'll just
[1:15:40] we'll just start over on something new
[1:15:43] but i think god that's not how he looks
[1:15:45] at a project
[1:15:46] god specializes in broken things
[1:15:49] god specializes in broken people and
[1:15:52] broken foundations and where we've been
[1:15:54] heard along the way god specializes he's
[1:15:57] the repair clinic he can fix the
[1:15:59] foundation he can fix where we're where
[1:16:01] we've been where we've been heard or
[1:16:03] ever been pulled apart or maybe there
[1:16:05] was too much weight put on us at some
[1:16:06] time he can fix that
[1:16:09] god does not walk away from a project
[1:16:11] thank god he doesn't look at something
[1:16:13] and think oh it's too far gone but my
[1:16:15] god specializes in things not impossible
[1:16:20] even when i didn't feel it he's working
[1:16:22] even when i didn't see it he's working
[1:16:25] even when i couldn't i couldn't feel it
[1:16:27] in my body he never stopped working
[1:16:30] he took on the project i'd say i can't
[1:16:33] speak with you but i thank god he took
[1:16:34] on my project
[1:16:36] where i had france
[1:16:38] excuse me where i had failures
[1:16:40] where i had inconsistencies he took on
[1:16:43] the project
[1:16:44] he said i'll make a beautiful thing out
[1:16:46] of that
[1:16:47] i'll take that broken thing and i'll
[1:16:49] make it beautiful i'll make it exalt my
[1:16:52] name i'll make it lift up praises i'll
[1:16:54] make it lift me up on high i'll make it
[1:16:56] such a beautiful thing that it'll even
[1:16:59] take a rapture with me
[1:17:01] to think that god took us in our
[1:17:03] inabilities
[1:17:04] oh my
[1:17:08] to think
[1:17:09] how many times we let him down
[1:17:12] how many times we failed and we made a
[1:17:13] promise and the next day we went back on
[1:17:15] it
[1:17:16] how we see we've commissioned we're
[1:17:18] going to do this or we're not going to
[1:17:19] do that ever again and we walk and the
[1:17:21] next day we're out in the same thing god
[1:17:23] still loved us anyway
[1:17:26] he said i'm not giving up on you
[1:17:30] i can fix this project
[1:17:32] i can take this broken vessel and i can
[1:17:34] repair it i can take this broken vessel
[1:17:37] and i can i can seal up the wounds and i
[1:17:39] can seal up the cracks and i can fill it
[1:17:42] with my anointed oil
[1:17:45] that's what god's doing in this hour
[1:17:46] he's not taking the theologian and the
[1:17:48] high call he's taking the broken vessels
[1:17:51] and he's making a paradox out of them by
[1:17:54] raising them higher than they ever
[1:17:56] imagined they could go
[1:17:58] that's my god
[1:18:00] it wouldn't be that big of a deal for
[1:18:01] god to take a monk that's lived his
[1:18:03] whole life in a cave and say yeah you
[1:18:05] know what he's not made these mistakes
[1:18:07] but that's not how god operates
[1:18:10] god takes a sinner saved by grace
[1:18:14] and raises him to a plane above any
[1:18:16] other
[1:18:17] that's my god
[1:18:18] he doesn't care about your mistakes his
[1:18:20] grace covered that he doesn't care about
[1:18:23] your faults his own blood paid for that
[1:18:25] he doesn't care about where you slipped
[1:18:27] up yesterday he already atoned for that
[1:18:29] my god specializes in the broken things
[1:18:34] that's what he's building his kingdom
[1:18:35] out of
[1:18:36] all those stones that were rejected
[1:18:39] that's what he's building his kingdom
[1:18:41] out of
[1:18:43] he's not building him out of just
[1:18:44] perfect synagogues somewhere men have
[1:18:47] tried that god is building his kingdom
[1:18:50] on stones rejected by the rest of the
[1:18:52] world
[1:18:57] never been so sure of god's grace in my
[1:18:59] life
[1:19:01] to think where i came from
[1:19:04] if he never did another thing for me
[1:19:06] oh he'd have done more than i could ever
[1:19:09] ask or imagine
[1:19:10] he'd done more than i could ever fathom
[1:19:12] if he never did another thing for me
[1:19:14] he's already done so much
[1:19:18] but i don't believe he's done with his
[1:19:19] bride
[1:19:20] i don't believe he called and anointed
[1:19:22] us and elected us and placed us so that
[1:19:24] we could just walk a okay christian life
[1:19:27] i believe he called us for a purpose i
[1:19:30] believe he anointed us for battle i
[1:19:31] believe he called us to go into victory
[1:19:37] you know there was one time in the bible
[1:19:38] a man who recognized the presence of of
[1:19:41] jehovah around him
[1:19:43] and he had made a promise to his men he
[1:19:44] said this day we'll kill every one of
[1:19:47] them
[1:19:48] and the sun began to fall
[1:19:50] and the sun began to set
[1:19:52] and you might be thinking that god's
[1:19:54] running out of time to perform your
[1:19:55] miracle but you just got to have the
[1:19:57] faith of joshua you just got to have the
[1:20:00] faith in the eyes that joshua had to say
[1:20:02] he's not giving up on me lord we need
[1:20:05] some help
[1:20:06] you know what the lord did he caused
[1:20:08] great stones the bible says to rain down
[1:20:10] from heaven and those great stones of
[1:20:13] fire began to fall upon those giants and
[1:20:16] those stones killed more giants than
[1:20:18] joshua and all of his men put together
[1:20:21] if you're backed in the corner maybe
[1:20:23] just call out to the lord say lord i
[1:20:24] need some help today
[1:20:26] i need some help in this situation
[1:20:29] and the lord caused great stones to fall
[1:20:32] now those stones were created to kill
[1:20:35] giants those stones were made to slay
[1:20:38] giants
[1:20:40] [Applause]
[1:20:41] and they fell and they and they killed
[1:20:43] the giants before them and we know the
[1:20:45] rest of the story joshua then under
[1:20:47] inspiration was able to say by the power
[1:20:50] of the word son
[1:20:52] stand still
[1:20:55] it's not getting too dark for your
[1:20:56] miracle
[1:20:57] that prodigal's not too far gone you're
[1:20:59] not running out of time you just got to
[1:21:01] have the faith of joshua and say son
[1:21:04] stand still in the name of christ
[1:21:08] anointed by his presence to walk in step
[1:21:10] with the word
[1:21:12] to walk in perfect time now whether god
[1:21:15] orchestrated the sun to stop at that
[1:21:17] point in time i don't know but by faith
[1:21:19] joshua spoke it and it came to pass
[1:21:22] now we don't need the sun to stand still
[1:21:25] we don't need squirrels
[1:21:26] but by faith what do you have need of
[1:21:29] today
[1:21:30] [Applause]
[1:21:33] to recognize
[1:21:34] where we are in this word this day this
[1:21:37] scripture joshua could have said those
[1:21:39] words out of his mouth this day this
[1:21:42] scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[1:21:45] look at the sun standing still
[1:21:47] and joshua finishes the job that day
[1:21:50] and then later years later
[1:21:52] there will come another giant into the
[1:21:54] land trying to rob the people of god of
[1:21:57] their victory
[1:21:58] and david recalls and remembers what the
[1:22:00] lord did for joshua he said somewhere in
[1:22:02] this valley there are stones that were
[1:22:04] created
[1:22:06] to kill giants
[1:22:08] and he begins to walk along that stream
[1:22:10] and he begins to find some mildly
[1:22:12] looking stones
[1:22:13] some stones that maybe nobody else would
[1:22:15] pick
[1:22:16] and he begins to bed down and pick those
[1:22:18] stones up and put him in his satchel
[1:22:21] these stones
[1:22:23] these were created for a purpose
[1:22:25] this stone right here was created for a
[1:22:27] purpose
[1:22:28] i believe it's killed a giant before
[1:22:35] takes that
[1:22:36] stone and remember goliath prophesied
[1:22:39] how he would die
[1:22:41] but watch how the watch how the lord
[1:22:43] uses it
[1:22:44] and david do we know the story
[1:22:46] [Music]
[1:22:48] that stone had already killed some
[1:22:49] giants before
[1:22:51] that was a heavenly stone
[1:22:54] it went so fast i don't know if it went
[1:22:56] and circled the earth and came back
[1:22:57] around but you think that a stone a
[1:23:00] stone hitting a giant would knock him
[1:23:02] back but the bible says that goliath
[1:23:04] fell on his face
[1:23:09] the devil will always bow before the
[1:23:11] word
[1:23:12] the devil will always be on his face
[1:23:14] before the living god he can't help it
[1:23:17] it's already written in the word and
[1:23:19] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:23:22] he'll fall on his face before the word
[1:23:25] it is also written
[1:23:27] it is also written
[1:23:30] i don't know what it took to do it that
[1:23:31] stone was created to kill giants
[1:23:35] brother branham picks that up later in
[1:23:36] the beginning of the message paradox he
[1:23:38] says i got a new bible today
[1:23:41] he says there was there's three
[1:23:42] bookmarks in it you know these little
[1:23:45] tassel things he said there's two of
[1:23:46] those in there said the first one when i
[1:23:48] opened it was on the first building of
[1:23:49] the temple
[1:23:51] the second one was on the second
[1:23:53] building of the temple and then my wife
[1:23:55] had put a bookmark in it i opened it to
[1:23:57] it it was on mark 11 22.
[1:23:59] have faith in god if you say unto this
[1:24:03] mountain and do not doubt in your heart
[1:24:06] it shall be removed
[1:24:09] what is he saying the third building of
[1:24:11] the temple is upon confession of the
[1:24:14] mouth he says those great stones are
[1:24:16] confessions that's how they built the
[1:24:18] temple by those great stones you can
[1:24:20] take the time to go research it those
[1:24:22] great stones are a confession of faith
[1:24:26] so let me say to you that you're not
[1:24:28] just an average stone sitting here this
[1:24:29] morning you're not just an average rock
[1:24:32] sitting here this morning but you were
[1:24:33] created to kill giants
[1:24:36] your purpose in life is to slay giants
[1:24:39] god caused you to come down from glory
[1:24:42] to kill a giant
[1:24:43] he's going to cause you to set on fire
[1:24:46] to kill a giant
[1:24:48] those great confessions be thou removed
[1:24:51] now i don't know what you have in your
[1:24:52] life but if you got anxiety say be thou
[1:24:54] removed
[1:24:56] you got depression in your life say be
[1:24:58] thou removed
[1:24:59] you got fear in your life be thou
[1:25:01] removed
[1:25:02] you got secret sin be thou removed
[1:25:07] you got diabetes be now removed last
[1:25:10] saturday night i watched somebody walk
[1:25:11] through a prayer line who was instantly
[1:25:13] healed of diabetes be thou removed
[1:25:18] and do not doubt in your heart and it
[1:25:20] shall be given unto you
[1:25:24] be thou removed
[1:25:26] by faith walking in the word
[1:25:28] this day is this scripture fulfilled
[1:25:33] that third temple is built in the
[1:25:35] manifested lives
[1:25:37] of sons and daughters of god upon their
[1:25:39] confessions the word is nigh thee
[1:25:42] even in thy mouth
[1:25:44] speak it and move forward
[1:25:47] be thou removed thou shine in my land be
[1:25:50] thou removed
[1:25:51] you giant of sickness be thou removed
[1:25:55] maybe sometimes we can't even put a
[1:25:57] finger on it we've just been walking it
[1:25:59] a little bit down a little bit upset a
[1:26:01] little bit afraid a little bit just it's
[1:26:03] seeming like we're not walking in total
[1:26:04] victory there's a giant right there
[1:26:08] be thou removed in the name of the lord
[1:26:10] jesus christ
[1:26:14] brother branham had a burden on him that
[1:26:15] he couldn't quite explain he just seemed
[1:26:17] like he lost his zeal for the people
[1:26:20] but they're just a simple prayer
[1:26:23] they are just honoring a promise he had
[1:26:25] given to god god said you remembered
[1:26:26] your promise and now i'll remember mine
[1:26:29] be thou removed
[1:26:31] and the burden was gone and the burden
[1:26:34] was lifted you see how quick god can
[1:26:36] activate that inside of you the fate to
[1:26:39] recognize you're walking in perfect step
[1:26:41] with the word we know what he wants done
[1:26:44] with it
[1:26:46] we've just got to put it into action
[1:26:48] speak it by the power of the lips it's
[1:26:51] time to put it in your mouth
[1:26:54] put it in your mouth and speak it
[1:26:57] upon the confession of my god i say be
[1:27:00] thou removed be cast into the sea
[1:27:04] thou thou demon of doubt be thou removed
[1:27:08] and do not doubt in your heart and it
[1:27:10] shall be given unto you
[1:27:14] to recognize whose presence you're in
[1:27:16] you say well i'm a sinner
[1:27:18] but if you'll just let me see you lord
[1:27:20] jesus manifest this word that we're
[1:27:22] talking about i know that's how job seen
[1:27:24] you i know that's how abraham saw you i
[1:27:27] know that's how the rest of them saw you
[1:27:28] because it was your promised word being
[1:27:32] vindicated
[1:27:33] i've heard all kinds of things and
[1:27:35] gimmicks and everything but i understand
[1:27:38] somebody say understand
[1:27:40] that there's a last day message in the
[1:27:42] land that was spoke by an angel on the
[1:27:45] river in 1933 i heard of the healing
[1:27:48] services and i know when that takes
[1:27:50] place i can't stay in this old rut
[1:27:53] anymore
[1:27:55] we got to get out of the rut sometimes
[1:27:57] we just got to get up out of that you
[1:27:58] know when you're riding on the side of
[1:27:59] the road and you get stuck in some of
[1:28:01] those those semi truck ruts you just got
[1:28:03] to break out of those sometimes and
[1:28:05] sometimes as believers we get stuck in
[1:28:07] the same old rut i say it's time to pull
[1:28:09] yourself out of the rut
[1:28:11] we are walking in victory we're not
[1:28:13] defeated we're not discouraged we're not
[1:28:15] afraid we're not a retreat we're walking
[1:28:18] in total victory with the word going
[1:28:20] before us
[1:28:23] it's a promise of the hour this day is
[1:28:26] this scripture fulfilled
[1:28:28] it's got to be revealed unto us
[1:28:31] when that anointing comes in we've got
[1:28:32] to recognize who's in our midst we've
[1:28:34] got to recognize it's not just a funny
[1:28:36] feeling it's not just an emotion who is
[1:28:39] it that's in our prayer closet who is it
[1:28:41] that comes in this building every sunday
[1:28:43] and thursday who is it that walks with
[1:28:45] us when we're out in the world who is it
[1:28:46] that protected our car who is it that
[1:28:48] protected us when we're in harm's way
[1:28:50] we've got to recognize the anointing
[1:28:55] if we could ever realize the anointing
[1:28:57] that we're in contact with our lives
[1:28:59] would never be the same
[1:29:03] jacob knew
[1:29:04] that there was an israel inside of him
[1:29:07] he knew there was somebody else inside
[1:29:09] of him he knew that this isn't me
[1:29:11] supplanter is not my testimony i don't
[1:29:13] want to be this the rest of my life
[1:29:15] there's something else inside of me
[1:29:17] but when that anointing came when he
[1:29:19] recognized whose presence he was in he
[1:29:22] said i'll not let you go until you bless
[1:29:24] me i'll not let you go until i get my
[1:29:27] blessing
[1:29:27] [Applause]
[1:29:31] how many times has the lord walked into
[1:29:32] those doors
[1:29:34] and we failed to recognize his presence
[1:29:36] and we've we thought about some other
[1:29:38] thing and thought about this and then we
[1:29:40] find ourselves in the middle of week why
[1:29:41] hasn't god answered me
[1:29:44] where is god now
[1:29:45] he said i was just with you and you
[1:29:48] failed to hold on to my anointing
[1:29:50] you failed to hold on to that presence
[1:29:52] that i brought in that room i sent my
[1:29:54] angel in there you felt the brush of his
[1:29:56] wing you've got to hold on to that
[1:29:59] anointing
[1:30:01] that's where your new name is
[1:30:03] when you get a hold of that anointing
[1:30:04] you're no longer the birth name you were
[1:30:06] born with you're mrs jesus christ you've
[1:30:09] come in contact with a name-changing
[1:30:12] anointing that will change your whole
[1:30:14] outlook on life
[1:30:16] struggle struggles yes troubles yes
[1:30:19] trials absolutely but your perception is
[1:30:22] it's totally different than before you
[1:30:24] came in contact with that anointing
[1:30:27] he can't lose you
[1:30:29] he can't forsake you you know when
[1:30:31] you've never met the lord you could say
[1:30:32] those words but you don't really mean
[1:30:34] them
[1:30:35] but when you've come in contact with the
[1:30:36] lord
[1:30:37] he can't lose me
[1:30:39] he can't forsake me
[1:30:42] we're in love
[1:30:44] we we met each other we came in contact
[1:30:47] that one that i got a hold of jacob
[1:30:49] didn't just forget about that the next
[1:30:51] day no he walked with the limp the rest
[1:30:53] of his life but he was so desperate to
[1:30:55] get a hold of that anointing he said
[1:30:57] you'll find a pile of bones here if you
[1:30:59] don't give it to me now that's how
[1:31:02] desperate we've got to be to get into
[1:31:04] this plan of god you'll find a pile of
[1:31:06] bones here
[1:31:07] i've got to have it i've got to walk in
[1:31:10] total victory
[1:31:12] and a new name is laying
[1:31:14] there there's an israel in you
[1:31:18] there's an israel inside of you you may
[1:31:20] not realize that you may have already
[1:31:21] covered the revelation of it but there's
[1:31:23] a new name inside of you
[1:31:25] that the world can't speak it they don't
[1:31:27] know it they don't see it they'll never
[1:31:29] understand it but you know you were
[1:31:31] called to a higher place than where
[1:31:33] you've been living your whole life
[1:31:35] there's something greater but when the
[1:31:37] anointing comes in don't let it go
[1:31:40] don't miss it
[1:31:42] don't miss that anointing
[1:31:46] i was preaching on this subject a little
[1:31:47] bit on this subject
[1:31:49] in australia a few months ago there was
[1:31:51] a young man in that service who was
[1:31:53] running the audio
[1:31:55] he had come from i think tennessee
[1:31:57] he's an old tennessee boy and moved up
[1:31:59] to canada running from the lord and then
[1:32:01] somehow he ended up in australia
[1:32:03] still running from the lord
[1:32:06] he meets a girl who's a backslid girl in
[1:32:08] a message church
[1:32:10] they get together they start going to
[1:32:11] the church and he's get back in step
[1:32:13] with the word back in step with the word
[1:32:14] and they're they're doing on their all
[1:32:16] for that church and giving their all to
[1:32:18] that youth camp we were at
[1:32:20] she's just administrating the services
[1:32:22] you know as far as the paperwork and the
[1:32:24] spreadsheets and he's running the sound
[1:32:26] i said god bless this couple for being
[1:32:28] so dedicated to serving the lord
[1:32:30] but at the end of that service i closed
[1:32:33] and i began to walk out the door and he
[1:32:34] got off the audio and came down and he
[1:32:36] was walking my direction i thought maybe
[1:32:38] he's going to ask me if i want a water
[1:32:39] or maybe he's going to ask me if
[1:32:41] i need anything
[1:32:42] and as he got closer to me he began to
[1:32:44] tremble
[1:32:45] and i recognized he's not coming to ask
[1:32:47] me he's not coming to ask me if i want
[1:32:49] to water
[1:32:50] he's coming to ask me for water
[1:32:52] and we got in contact with each other he
[1:32:54] said i don't have what you have i've got
[1:32:57] to have what you have he said while the
[1:32:59] anointing of god is here i've got to
[1:33:01] have what you have
[1:33:03] you know friends i didn't tell him that
[1:33:05] he had to crawl on his knees up to the
[1:33:07] front of the church i said as peter said
[1:33:09] silver and gold have i none but that
[1:33:12] which i have i give unto you in the name
[1:33:15] of christ
[1:33:18] don't tell me that god's not having new
[1:33:20] births take place i watched one happen
[1:33:22] right in front of my eyes
[1:33:24] that boy is totally different he's a
[1:33:27] hundred percent different in so much so
[1:33:28] that his wife didn't know what to do
[1:33:30] with him but then four days later the
[1:33:32] lord caught up with her and the same
[1:33:34] thing happened to her
[1:33:38] god's doing something in this hour
[1:33:41] he's changing hearts in this hour
[1:33:43] just since then that was about two
[1:33:44] months ago since then the boy's been
[1:33:46] called to preach he might be the first
[1:33:48] evangelist to ever operate in australia
[1:33:50] don't tell me that god isn't doing
[1:33:53] something
[1:33:56] he's mindful of your situation but when
[1:33:58] that anointing comes in don't let it go
[1:34:01] until he blesses you
[1:34:03] now remember it's not a man
[1:34:05] it's not this big preacher
[1:34:07] it's the anointing of god it's
[1:34:09] recognizing whose presence you're in
[1:34:12] friends i'm all in favor of receiving it
[1:34:14] by the preaching of the word
[1:34:16] i i've heard testimonies just of last
[1:34:18] week of people receiving the holy ghost
[1:34:20] and healing by the preaching of the word
[1:34:23] but i'm also in favor of prayer lines
[1:34:25] and laying on of hands and and and going
[1:34:27] to to nighttime prayer times and we're
[1:34:30] called out at 3 in the morning i've seen
[1:34:31] the lord do miraculous there too
[1:34:34] don't put god in a box but when that
[1:34:35] anointing comes whether it's through the
[1:34:37] preaching whether it's through the
[1:34:38] prayer whether it's the laying on of
[1:34:40] hands whether it's through a word of
[1:34:41] prophecy don't miss the anointing when
[1:34:44] it
[1:34:44] comes that's where your victory is
[1:34:48] it's under that presence but the man
[1:34:50] will say i labor to stay under this
[1:34:52] anointing to see where the message is
[1:34:55] today
[1:34:58] that's an exact quote to see where the
[1:35:00] message is
[1:35:02] today
[1:35:03] this day
[1:35:04] this message is fulfilled in your ears
[1:35:08] but we've got a labor to stand under
[1:35:10] that anointing
[1:35:11] it's hard to stay under that anointing
[1:35:14] it shaves us
[1:35:16] it takes away from us
[1:35:18] it empties us out
[1:35:20] it checks every thought
[1:35:22] it checks every move
[1:35:24] it's hard to labor to stay under there
[1:35:28] but it's where our victory is
[1:35:31] that's where our promises lay
[1:35:34] that's how we find it
[1:35:36] the man would say the anointing's here
[1:35:38] i think over thousands of times he would
[1:35:40] say the anointing was there
[1:35:43] and the light struck the lens
[1:35:47] i don't believe he was just talking
[1:35:49] about a picture
[1:35:50] that somebody took
[1:35:52] i believe the anointing is here
[1:35:54] and the light has struck the lens
[1:35:57] a lens is a piece of glass or other
[1:35:59] transparent substance that is used to
[1:36:01] form an image
[1:36:03] of an object by focusing the rays of
[1:36:06] light from that object
[1:36:09] i don't want to over complicate it
[1:36:11] you're here to reflect the image
[1:36:13] of christ i believe the anointing is
[1:36:15] here and it has struck the lens
[1:36:18] we're here to magnify what the lord is
[1:36:20] doing we're here to magnify what he's
[1:36:22] doing in our day in this hour not days
[1:36:25] gone by off you could have been here 30
[1:36:27] years ago or 60 years ago or 2 000 years
[1:36:29] ago but he right now today christ is
[1:36:33] living in lives
[1:36:34] jesus is moving in situations he's
[1:36:37] healing he's bringing back he's
[1:36:38] restoring
[1:36:40] there in that meeting in mexico yet
[1:36:42] another prodigal runs to the front and
[1:36:44] gives his heart to the lord
[1:36:46] that's three in the last year i've seen
[1:36:48] just under where i've been associated
[1:36:49] with
[1:36:50] it's the time for it
[1:36:52] it's the season of it
[1:36:55] he's moving mountains
[1:36:57] be thou removed
[1:37:01] listen for the change in the anointing
[1:37:04] remember the man would talk about the
[1:37:05] symphony
[1:37:06] and we say he's the great conductor and
[1:37:08] he's conducting that symphony and you
[1:37:10] might just get one note you might just
[1:37:12] get that one symbol clap or that one
[1:37:14] horn blow but listen for your change
[1:37:17] listen for that anointing to come
[1:37:19] through the conductor is conducting
[1:37:21] we've got to stay in tune we know what
[1:37:24] he wants done with the word we've got
[1:37:26] the sheet music in our hand we've got to
[1:37:28] read until we see it's my note
[1:37:31] this is my section the conductor's
[1:37:34] coming my way there he is there he is
[1:37:37] the anointing has come
[1:37:39] we've got to recognize it's our time
[1:37:41] we're not born in the wrong age who
[1:37:42] weren't born in the wrong season we were
[1:37:44] born for this season this age to bring
[1:37:48] to manifestation the promises that god
[1:37:50] gave us
[1:37:54] it's already in us to overcome
[1:37:58] you may not feel like it sometimes you
[1:37:59] may not have looked in the mirror this
[1:38:01] morning i thought i'm an overcomer
[1:38:03] by the bed you probably look in the
[1:38:05] mirror and think i'm an overcomer this
[1:38:07] morning
[1:38:08] maybe you did
[1:38:09] i know i didn't i didn't even look in
[1:38:11] the mirror
[1:38:13] but it's already in you to overcome
[1:38:17] and when that anointing comes through
[1:38:20] that's what activates it
[1:38:22] when that anointing comes through that's
[1:38:23] what sets that gene seed
[1:38:26] brother and we say so we have these
[1:38:28] times what time do we start
[1:38:31] 11.
[1:38:32] so we have these times the symphonies of
[1:38:34] the symphony of god's word that's the
[1:38:36] whole drama changes
[1:38:39] you are
[1:38:40] you who are interested
[1:38:42] how many is interested
[1:38:44] listen for that change
[1:38:46] you know it's getting close you hear the
[1:38:48] way the drums are beating amen want
[1:38:50] something to happen you know this is a
[1:38:53] change see it's going to break out into
[1:38:55] a burst in a few minutes and you're
[1:38:57] watching for it you can tell the way the
[1:38:59] drums are timing oh god if you can hear
[1:39:02] the drums of the finish now if you can
[1:39:04] hear the echo of the music of the
[1:39:06] heavenly word singing itself out it
[1:39:09] shall come to pass in the last days the
[1:39:11] symphony of god's great drama that he's
[1:39:14] playing it changes him his symphony at
[1:39:17] the junction the composer and those who
[1:39:20] are interested
[1:39:22] listen for the change
[1:39:25] are you interested
[1:39:27] this is eternity
[1:39:29] are you interested
[1:39:31] listen for the change
[1:39:34] we're out of change a junction of time
[1:39:39] but you're you already have what it
[1:39:41] takes to hear the change
[1:39:43] you don't need a musical ear
[1:39:46] you need to have his ear
[1:39:48] you don't need to have perfect pitch
[1:39:50] you need to be in tune with the word
[1:39:52] and the change is coming
[1:39:54] we feel the change in the air there's an
[1:39:56] atmosphere the inspiration the anointing
[1:39:59] it's changing the waters are troubled
[1:40:01] the timing is is it's a specific time
[1:40:04] for a specific burden but we have what
[1:40:06] it takes to overcome
[1:40:08] in the darkest of all ages
[1:40:13] i think one of the greatest the greatest
[1:40:15] lies that the devil has told the bride
[1:40:17] is
[1:40:18] you're not gonna make it
[1:40:20] you don't have what it takes
[1:40:22] you're not going to be there should the
[1:40:23] great the great trumpet sound it'll pass
[1:40:26] by everybody else but not you well you
[1:40:28] know he's telling your neighbor the same
[1:40:30] thing
[1:40:31] you know he's telling the preacher the
[1:40:32] same thing you know he's telling the guy
[1:40:33] in the back he's telling the deacon the
[1:40:35] same thing he's telling the song leader
[1:40:36] the same thing he's telling your mama
[1:40:38] the same thing he's a lion devil
[1:40:41] and he would like to get you to think
[1:40:43] that you're not gonna make it but we
[1:40:45] have a more sure word of prophecy in
[1:40:48] this hour that you've already made it
[1:40:52] guns already saw you walking in perfect
[1:40:55] victory by a prophet's vision he saw a
[1:40:57] bride without spot or wrinkle and she
[1:41:00] was walking in step with the word
[1:41:04] [Music]
[1:41:06] not building a kingdom unto herself she
[1:41:08] was saying onward christian soldier
[1:41:10] marching as to war
[1:41:13] we are not divided all one body are we
[1:41:19] he also saw your mistakes
[1:41:21] and that bride started to get out loud
[1:41:23] and a prophet through a vision would say
[1:41:25] get back in line and the bride responded
[1:41:30] he saw where you slipped up and the
[1:41:32] bride responded and got back in line
[1:41:35] with the word
[1:41:37] [Applause]
[1:41:38] satan can't stop this
[1:41:41] satan can't kill this he can't destroy
[1:41:43] it he can't stop this move of god the
[1:41:46] movie is already on for the bride we are
[1:41:49] not stopping we are not slowing down
[1:41:52] until we reach complete and total
[1:41:54] victory by the changing of our bodies
[1:41:59] that's why we believe what we believe
[1:42:02] [Applause]
[1:42:04] it's already there
[1:42:06] that's right trying to cut them down and
[1:42:07] bring them to a spot when the great
[1:42:09] capstone comes the ministry that's in
[1:42:11] the church and the capstone will just
[1:42:13] come right straight together like a

[1:42:32] fit ourselves to meet that cornerstone
[1:42:35] let us love and project our lives in
[1:42:37] christ and be sincere and stay with the
[1:42:40] word until he comes
[1:42:42] and we just fit right in there like a
[1:42:44] glove over the hand like that

[1:43:19] jesus said say to this mountain and
[1:43:21] you've heard and about that time had
[1:43:22] taken place that's the ministry that

[1:43:40] eye to go out or will not go
[1:43:43] now what if i just ended that quote
[1:43:44] right there you might leave with a
[1:43:46] question but the very next line he says
[1:43:48] but don't worry

[1:43:54] the power of the church rises it'll
[1:43:55] bring its brethren the power of the

[1:44:04] we're looking forward to it
[1:44:05] [Applause]
[1:44:07] don't worry church

[1:44:39] this is another time
[1:44:41] another age i'm not laodicean anymore
[1:44:44] i've come into another age i've come out
[1:44:46] of that that old starchy lukewarm church
[1:44:49] going quote knowing scripture quoting
[1:44:52] i'm coming to another age where there's
[1:44:55] life and where that life is there is
[1:44:58] where liberty is
[1:45:01] we're on a higher plane
[1:45:04] it'll be there friends but the brandon
[1:45:06] didn't he he said well and and the devil
[1:45:08] began to torment him and say well you
[1:45:10] said that squirrel would be on the other
[1:45:12] side of that log what if it's not there
[1:45:13] and he said it'll be there
[1:45:17] when you get up against that trial it'll
[1:45:20] be there

[1:46:00] predestinated resources but under
[1:46:02] inspiration
[1:46:04] that's when they come to life
[1:46:06] inspired
[1:46:08] in his presence
[1:46:11] whose presence are we in
[1:46:13] if the music players would come
[1:46:16] inspired

[1:47:03] the isle of patmos
[1:47:06] i'm just john but then under that
[1:47:08] anointing under the open book he saw
[1:47:11] that he wasn't just john
[1:47:13] but his name had already been written on
[1:47:16] another book there was another name
[1:47:18] written there and i john
[1:47:21] under that anointing shouted so loud
[1:47:26] i don't care if you shout i don't care

[1:47:32] what you have needed to overcome is
[1:47:33] already inside you
[1:47:36] it's predestinated inside you it's a
[1:47:39] predestinated resource to recognize the
[1:47:41] word and walk step in step with it
[1:47:45] now we know what he wants done with the
[1:47:46] word
[1:47:47] we've got to walk with it we've got to
[1:47:50] move with it
[1:47:51] we've got to take the word as it were
[1:47:53] hand in hand
[1:47:56] eat the book
[1:47:57] yeah
[1:47:58] we've got to eat the book
[1:48:00] we've got to absorb it
[1:48:02] we've got to become it
[1:48:03] it's not theology
[1:48:05] it's not by mind it's not by
[1:48:06] understanding it's not by how much i can
[1:48:08] scour over these things
[1:48:11] it's by revelation
[1:48:13] i'm gonna make it i wish i could sing
[1:48:16] i've seen that song i'm gonna make it he
[1:48:18] already said i would
[1:48:22] you know one time in the bible
[1:48:24] there was a lady who had the same
[1:48:26] the same torments that you have
[1:48:30] by circumstance
[1:48:31] she was put in a bad situation in life
[1:48:36] she had she had forsaken her friends her
[1:48:38] friends have forsaken her they left her
[1:48:40] alone her parents had forsaken her and
[1:48:42] there she was all alone
[1:48:44] until she met
[1:48:45] someone who told her she had value
[1:48:55] watch the anointing that's in here
[1:48:58] until she recognized
[1:49:00] who she was talking to
[1:49:03] nobody thought she was of any value
[1:49:05] before she prostituted her body
[1:49:08] man would spit on her step on her
[1:49:10] she was the the worst in
[1:49:12] civilization but then one day she came
[1:49:14] in contact with somebody
[1:49:16] and she much like you thought there's no
[1:49:18] way i'll ever be worthy enough to walk
[1:49:20] with him
[1:49:21] there's no way i'll ever be worthy
[1:49:23] enough to to sit with him at his table
[1:49:28] but something inside of her knew there's
[1:49:30] an israel in me
[1:49:34] the whole time she was out insane the
[1:49:35] whole time she was she was out in the
[1:49:37] world she knew there's an israel
[1:49:40] inside of me if i could just labor under
[1:49:43] that anointing
[1:49:46] like just labor he might reject me but
[1:49:48] i've got to try
[1:49:50] i've got to try to get there
[1:49:53] we know the story she spent all of her
[1:49:54] savings on a box with oil
[1:49:58] you think about how she walked through
[1:50:00] that room where they all knew who she
[1:50:01] was
[1:50:02] they all knew oh my
[1:50:04] sometimes us as church people somebody
[1:50:06] walks in the church and we think oh we
[1:50:07] know who she is
[1:50:09] we know what that brother's done
[1:50:11] see she's dragging that chain
[1:50:17] of sin
[1:50:19] of condemnation
[1:50:20] under that anointing you think the
[1:50:22] living word was sitting in that room and
[1:50:24] she was a believer
[1:50:25] she could feel that coming on her she
[1:50:27] could feel that oh
[1:50:29] look at that shekinah glory all around
[1:50:31] if i could just get to them i hope they
[1:50:32] don't stop me i hope they don't stop me
[1:50:34] if she's dragging her chain and as she
[1:50:36] gets closer that chain begins to get a
[1:50:38] little lighter
[1:50:39] it begins to get a little bit more off
[1:50:41] her shoulder
[1:50:42] she's pulling it a little less
[1:50:44] by the time she can get to him all she
[1:50:45] can think about is washing his feet
[1:50:49] you think what is this what is this
[1:50:50] crazy woman doing
[1:50:55] lebron would say
[1:50:57] if you do
[1:50:59] because the holy spirit can inspire it
[1:51:01] to you
[1:51:02] but if the soul isn't right with god as
[1:51:05] as we've been through it's no good
[1:51:06] anyhow remember false anointing ones
[1:51:08] will rise in the last days not false
[1:51:10] jesus says false christs and we'll
[1:51:12] deceive the very elected if it were
[1:51:14] possible but notice
[1:51:16] she had a service to do for him
[1:51:21] remember she's not a preacher
[1:51:23] she's not a prophet she's not a song
[1:51:25] leader she's she's got a service
[1:51:27] to do for him
[1:51:29] she had heard of him but now she's seen
[1:51:32] him with her eyes
[1:51:34] she had a service to do and she had
[1:51:37] nothing to do it with
[1:51:39] well i felt like that so many times in
[1:51:40] my life i want to do something for the
[1:51:42] lord but i've got nothing to do it with
[1:51:45] so she rushed forward anyhow to do the
[1:51:48] service
[1:51:49] and watch this god
[1:51:51] furnished the water
[1:51:53] and the towels
[1:51:56] to wash his feet
[1:51:58] she had heard of a living god all her
[1:52:01] life but now she's seen him with her
[1:52:03] eyes she knew it was him and inspiration
[1:52:06] struck her and said this is the
[1:52:09] messenger he needed a service and she
[1:52:11] had nothing to serve him by but his feet
[1:52:14] was dirty so she rushed forward anyhow
[1:52:17] to do him a service because she was
[1:52:19] inspired
[1:52:21] to do it
[1:52:25] she went forward to serve him because
[1:52:27] inspiration struck struck her
[1:52:31] and that was the hour
[1:52:33] that was the messenger that was the
[1:52:35] messiah who was to heal and she believed
[1:52:39] it and he needed a service done to him
[1:52:42] and she went forward without anything
[1:52:45] showing that she could do it she just
[1:52:47] went upon her inspiration
[1:52:51] and god broke up the fountains of the
[1:52:53] tear glands in her eyes
[1:52:55] the same eyes that had the same ears
[1:52:57] that had heard and the eyes that had
[1:52:59] seen broke up with joy
[1:53:01] god given long hair and with them tears
[1:53:03] flowing down god furnished her towels
[1:53:05] with her here with her hair
[1:53:07] and with her tears
[1:53:09] she served his needs the need of the
[1:53:13] living god
[1:53:14] she had heard about it but now she's
[1:53:17] seen him
[1:53:18] she could do him a service
[1:53:24] we may not have a
[1:53:26] some great gift or some supernatural
[1:53:28] ability but don't worry
[1:53:31] what you have need of is already in
[1:53:32] there
[1:53:34] what you have need of to do a service is
[1:53:36] already laying within sight of you but
[1:53:38] under the right inspiration under the
[1:53:41] right anointing in the right time it
[1:53:43] will come to life
[1:53:45] recognize what anointing you're under
[1:53:47] we could just bow our hearts this
[1:53:49] morning
[1:53:52] oh jesus how we love you
[1:53:55] truly god there's none like you lord
[1:53:58] amen
[1:53:59] father we have no gifts to bring of our
[1:54:01] own and
[1:54:02] father no beauty that you desire us or
[1:54:05] father no no treasures of this earth
[1:54:07] that we could bring that would mean
[1:54:08] anything lord but
[1:54:10] lord what we have you gave us father
[1:54:13] lord you gave it to us for a purpose
[1:54:15] this revelation of the word of the hour
[1:54:17] you didn't just give it to us so we
[1:54:18] could argue about or pick her about it
[1:54:20] or reason about it but lord you gave it
[1:54:22] to us that that we might wash our feet
[1:54:24] with it lord

[1:54:49] anything lord you saw away
[1:54:53] oh god when we were backed in a corner
[1:54:55] it looked like there was no way out you
[1:54:57] made a way for us lord
[1:55:00] oh god we didn't have the words to say
[1:55:02] your spirit brought inspiration lord
[1:55:06] father even those times we didn't know
[1:55:08] what to pray you gave us utterance lord
[1:55:12] oh god there's truly no one like you
[1:55:20] father you gave us this word and

[1:55:27] down here father
[1:55:28] i believe every word that's been spoken
[1:55:30] by the mouth of a prophet lord
[1:55:33] lord it was given for a purpose
[1:55:37] lord i pray that we can put that word
[1:55:38] into action in our mouths

[1:56:30] of a believer to say be thou removed

[2:22:38] this morning
[2:22:40] just uh so encouraged and
[2:22:43] just uh
[2:22:44] strengthened by by what the holy spirit
[2:22:46] said this morning um
[2:22:49] i you know how he was talking about how
[2:22:51] satan lies and lies to us and such and
[2:22:54] sometimes you know
[2:22:56] uh
[2:22:57] he can make us
[2:22:59] you know lie to us and and make us feel
[2:23:01] like
[2:23:02] you know the victory we have in our life
[2:23:04] is now
[2:23:05] is not what it is uh
[2:23:08] but uh
[2:23:09] you know
[2:23:10] if you would say interview the devil in
[2:23:12] the morning say what what what's your
[2:23:14] purpose for today he says well i'm gonna
[2:23:15] take say dave and i'm going to do this
[2:23:18] to him i'm going to do that to him at
[2:23:19] the end of the day
[2:23:20] he's not going to be serving the lord
[2:23:22] he's you know i'm going to take him down
[2:23:24] and such
[2:23:26] but at the end of the day that's not
[2:23:27] what happens you know you might fail and
[2:23:29] stuff
[2:23:30] it might all through the day you know
[2:23:32] you things might uh
[2:23:34] not go the way you would plan
[2:23:36] but at the end of the day it's satan
[2:23:38] that failed
[2:23:39] he didn't get to uh
[2:23:41] do what he had planned to do you're
[2:23:43] still standing for jesus so it's
[2:23:45] it's satan's the failure you're still
[2:23:47] the victory so on monday morning you
[2:23:49] know you can wake up
[2:23:50] in the morning and say well at the end
[2:23:52] of the day i'll still be serving the
[2:23:54] lord
[2:23:54] satan he has his plans he's going to
[2:23:56] fail on tuesday on wednesday on thursday
[2:23:59] all through the all through the week you
[2:24:01] can just chalk it up you know satan zero
[2:24:04] dave one day two days three
[2:24:07] even though it doesn't feel like that in
[2:24:08] our spirits a lot of times
[2:24:10] but he was that just
[2:24:12] it was kind of how you know god was
[2:24:13] dealing with me but you know he was
[2:24:15] talking about how satan lies to you and
[2:24:17] satan lies and he tries to say different
[2:24:18] things
[2:24:20] you know there's there's so many things
[2:24:21] that come up throughout the week that
[2:24:24] you know it's a battle that we're in
[2:24:27] but it's already done god's already put
[2:24:29] it inside of us
[2:24:31] it and it's just god
[2:24:33] making it manifest and bringing out
[2:24:36] in us
[2:24:37] the purpose that he has already said
[2:24:40] he's going to do
[2:24:42] so let's just
[2:24:44] go before him in prayer and lord
[2:24:46] just come to you in prayer lord and just
[2:24:49] i might not have said that exactly how
[2:24:51] how you brought it to me and such lord i

[2:24:56] lord that it's already done lord and how
[2:24:59] how you brought it out this morning it's
[2:25:00] it's not

[2:25:03] guessing which way
[2:25:05] and what's going to happen lord
[2:25:07] but lord it's already done this is your
[2:25:09] plan this is your purpose and you are
