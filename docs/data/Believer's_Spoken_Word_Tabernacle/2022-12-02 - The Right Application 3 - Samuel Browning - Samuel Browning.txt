brother Ram tells us he takes the parallel of halibut with the Rapture and how that when the Lord Jesus raised there he was with his disciples as it says in the book of Acts for that period of time about 30 days and the brother Brown said the Saints our loved ones and those Saints have gone on will raise and he said we'll be gathered together yeah and he said now you think how God has things so planned out brother Graham says he has everything so planned and he said what it is he said because even when our changes come we're going to be looking to see who made it and he said see he says he knows that we would be looking around so he gives us that time because when he when he descends all eyes are going to be looking for him so to think of just even how it is now in our lives it always comes back to him and then in that time it will all come right back to him because he's The Sinner of Our Lives Amen in the Lord good yeah so good to be in the house of the Lord tonight and good to be and fellowship with you we just want to turn our hearts to the word of the Lord tonight and just invite him to come so appreciated the song service and the songs and just the worship and it's just so wonderful to be gathered together amen I just want to mention to you the calendar and so forth has gone out and I I'm going to just requesting your prayer Lord willing I fly out real early in the morning of meetings in Mexico there it's like their their Unity meetings and they've already started in on Tuesday night and so um flying for that and to minister there on this weekend and then to come on back home and so um I just covet your prayers amen if you just keep me in prayer and certainly be praying for you brother Ronnie long will be here Amen to to stand in for us and then um and we're just thankful to the Lord for that and and just certainly looking to the Lord for what God has in store amen so would you just will you keep that in prayer amen and then we'll so we just want to also there's some announcements that's on the calendar as well that upcoming events in January and then even in March and I know those are far off dates as far as in March but it's things that I think that it would be good to go ahead and plan for you can put on your calendar and some the meetings and some things that we have and and some of those meetings that have coming up there have some special planning that has gone into that for some unique some unique things I'll go into that in a little bit detail here in a little bit a later time so um let's go let's look here in the scriptures in First Peter chapter 4. Amen in verse 12. also wanted to give you an update brother Stephen West he just wanted to say thank you for your continued prayers his mother she's at home it's just that she's experiencing at different times just um some difficulty with breathing the lung volume so if we just keep that in prayer she's on the therapy where all that is at and just it's her her breathing and that therapy that that would just she would grow stronger so she's she's at home there and so our brother just asked that we would just keep that in prayer I know there's many other requests and different needs that here are among us and we just want to remember each one of these requests and needs in prayer someone comes on your heart I know we say this a lot but it's true God knows and he knows how to place needs Upon Our Hearts sometimes if you if you think about in a term and this is why I love the beauty of the body of Jesus Christ because if you think about just for one individual of how many times that you just yourself have been had requests come your way pray for me pray for pray for me and really you would have to try to write everything down to remember and on your own but it's something that's special when we can recognize that within it God will always bring to our heart in prayer or leading us into prayer God will always bring that so I'm thankful that we don't have to look and say oh my I forgot to forgot to pray about this I forgot no as soon as those things as it comes to our heart we enter in and we pray because if not all the requests that we have the only thing we would do as far as in prayer would just be giving out requests right but our desire is this Lord that that you would just you would Minister and speak to the needs amen God's placed us as a body that we would be able to to do that and it wonderful to be a part of the body of Jesus Christ a local body a man where we can take the different requests and needs before the Lord in prayer so First Peter chapter 4 and verse 12. the scripture says beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding Joy let's just let's just bear our hearts in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord as we just come to you this evening Lord are just so thankful God for your mercy Lord to us once again Lord you've allowed us to be able to come together Lord father our expectation Lord is to hear from you Lord we just desire to give Lord of our hearts and ourselves to you and you know what we have need of oh God we ask that you would just Minister Lord in just a very special way Lord I pray that you would help me Lord to step aside Lord the things Lord that you've laid Lord on my heart and I just want to be sensitive to what it is that you desire for this service Lord I pray that God that you'll just Lord come in a very special way Lord and speak personally to every heart we invite you in that way Lord have your way father we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you being seated I want to we were looking here just even a few weeks ago and um as we look at this in the scripture with the trials and trials of our faith and I look as we were dealing with the thought on the right application to things and we could speak of that in many ways there's many examples that I won't go into but I thought of of how that God through the ministry of brother Branham there were things that would be directed and every time we'd go right back into the word to resolve where someone was like in a conflict or something in their life and they didn't understand what was going on or maybe they had been told something and what they were told really wasn't true and I think brother Branham in one particular time just to give just in a nutshell because it could really it could really speak on this for some time but there was a lady who came a sister who came to brother Branham there and she had uh many different things that had been taking place in her life and and she was told by one person she had seven devils and then she got told by another person you've got five Devils so she was all in a in a confusion of what was going on and she got there and brother Brandon began to sit down and see her and and because of what was said she was she was so you could see I mean she said I don't want these devils and brother Brown began to speak speak to her a little bit and he said he began to speak to her and said he said sister he said those things he said the doctors have been giving you he said you're aware your mother went through a certain time of life too right that's right now he said there's no Devils there he said but aren't you she said aren't you going to cast them away he says there's no Devils to Cast Away there's none there you're in menopause right now and so knowing that brother Branham would have that and I just maybe pause here for a moment if you've uh if any would uh you know of any any any situation brother Bram actually takes there's a wonderful YouTube video where sister Rebecca goes into some explanations when brother Branham actually set her down sister Rebecca Branham and spoke to her even in how to relate to her mom in certain times because she wasn't aware of what was going on brother Brown took a it was 40 45 minutes it's a very good video of understanding even that whole whole part that takes place it's just tremendous because there's so many parts in the message where brother Branham will deal with that but um you know with this with this lady here she was the sister was sitting there and you know brother Brown said I could tell she was hungry but you know he says she still was so caught up with that that I have devils and and brother Branham she goes out and they go out and eat she finally gives in they go out and eat in the kitchen and then when they come back into the Parlor and she said now brother Brown are you going to cast those Devils off me I think she's already been told twice you don't have any devils but see the wrong application was binding her now let me tell you the other effect of that wrong application brother Brown went ahead and told her he said sister I told you you don't have any Devils you're in menopause he said now here's what I want you to do he said you are a good you were a good housekeeper she said yes he said this is what I need you to do I won't use the words exactly brother Brown said he said you need to go home and you need to clean your house and you need to make your husband an apple pie and just go on because you see what the wrong app this is what I'm saying within this do you see what the wrong application had done that man that apple pie will preach won't it but you see you see what the wrong ad this is to me the Simplicity of the you see what the wrong application can do the wrong application had a person where they were living in defeat this is why there's got to be the right application and that's why we need the word of God that comes to discern the very secrets and intents of our hearts so notice when Peter would write this in First Peter chapter 4 Peter writes this and here this is this is after the Holy Ghost has come this is speaking to every believer down through time because this shows beloved thinking not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing has happened to you it shows our Humanity that when the test or the trial and we don't even know what it is at first we don't even know it's a test we don't even know it's a trial but when something happens the the first part of it is because we are still veiled in this Humanity and we are constantly as people I can't get all into this tonight when we constantly search for understanding in things why is this and why is that we search for understanding right so we see that within that yet here God knows that part and God doesn't get caught up with our Humanity God knows that down on the inside is a son and daughter of God and all it takes is them to hear from God and they receive strength to bring the outer realm in subjection God's Got Confidence in his children his sheep will hear his voice and respond so notice he says but rejoice in verse 13. inasmuch as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding joy and I think of that in that scripture there when we look many times at the test and the trials when they come we don't feel like rejoicing and this scripture is not telling us get out in the flesh but what it's speaking to us it's speaking from there's something deep within that though the circumstances do not Merit worship but God is worthy of worship I don't know what is going on around me but I know in whom I have believed if there's one thing I can rejoice in his grace hath brought me his grace half brought me saved this far his grace will lead me over that's what I can rejoice in not the circumstances that are around me right David said though my enemies Came Upon me to consume My Flesh yea they stumbled and fell and David speaks in the midst of that chapter what he was focused on he knew all of this was taking place but he said in the midst of that there is one thing that I've desired and that's what I'm going to seek after when all of this is going on I want to dwell in the house of the Lord I want to be in his presence I know I've still got access to his presence I know there's something greater than this atmosphere that's around me I don't want to come under this atmosphere I want my life to be brought under the atmosphere of his presence praise the Lord this is what Peter would say in First Peter 1 6 wherein you greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth and I I just feel to keep emphasizing that part of it it's the trial of your faith it's not our flesh because if it was the trial of our flesh it breaks in a moment the flesh breaks the Flesh in the midst of the trial the flesh displays its weakness but that's why the trial comes the trial comes to break down the flesh so that the real man of God the real daughter of God might stand up let the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the pairing of Jesus Christ tried with fire so you can't consume this this Faith within our hearts when it's when it's tried with fire it cannot be consumed are you with me remember what what Paul said I've laid the foundation where no man can live let a man be careful how he adds to that Foundation right because every man's work will be Tried by fire and that which remaineth is that which will be rewarded so fire comes to try to prove and what fire does is it causes the impurities to be separated from the purity Oh Glory and I'm talking about in our own lives now let me read this Herald of three kinds of Believers and I read this to you before but it's much to draw from here on this thought of the right application brother Bram said sometimes Believers are put to the test and not just sometimes every time they are for every son that cometh to God must be chastened tried child trained and remember the trials and the dusty roads and the hot son of persecution but he says the but the Loyalty of your heart beats that material till she's ready to go into the mold so what what is it that that that that that beats that character or that or that material is the Loyalty of our heart loyalty is standing true amen right I mean sometimes when the battle comes the pressure comes to Desert right but there's got to be something greater a loyalty we say loyalty to what loyalty to whom God has revealed himself to you the Bible said walk in the light as he's in the light you walk in that light and much more unfolds then firm on the life that he has revealed to you right well I don't see all of this but stand on the light that he's revealed to you because Flesh and Blood did not reveal that to you God has revealed that to you and if you'll be faithful with that the Bible says that the righteousness of God is revealed from Faith unto faith so Stand Fast in that word and expect for God to reveal more because everything that God reveals to you and I we will be tested and tried on that word so notice this loyalty of our heart he said God's children is made up correctly on his word for they are living examples and the word of God is living through them the trial comes to shake you to put you to the very bottom to see where you'll stand and it goes on he says now job through his tests and trials his children were taking everything else the church members come and they accused him of being a secret Sinner and they tried to say everything against him I want you to catch this but yet he wouldn't listen to any of it he knowed he had met God's requirement he know there's no need of Satan trying to tempt him he noted was the devil what was it that he knowed was the devil he knew that the inspiration they were speaking with was not coming from God because the inspiration he had received from God he had walked in that inspiration fully job had offered up the right sacrifice right so this discernment job that's why Joe could stand there he never called him a devil but remember even when his wife said you know Curse God and die but that was part of the test and he said thou speakest like a foolish woman you're not a foolish woman because the fool has said in his heart there is no God right so here still there's discernment in the life of a Believer though discernment job doesn't know what's taking place he doesn't understand it but there's enough to discern in this moment that this is the enemy coming against me how can it be so sure because the revelation God has revealed to him the acceptable way and it wasn't just something handed to job it was revealed to job brother Brown puts her like this and the message I know my redeemer liveth he said the reason the rest of them were coming at Job the where they were is because they only knew God by theology he said but job knew him by revelation because when you know him by Revelation you know that he is a person glory be to God you are acquainted with his nature with his ways you are acquainted with him and friends and he is not our enemy because a friend he maketh known to his friends whatsoever he doeth he was conveying to job the way of acceptance oh my so job knew that discernment now notice brother REM said as long as Satan can make him believe right now now notice as long as Satan can make him talking about Job believe that his sickness was his God doing it he had job whipped now he said but once job struck that Revelation that it was not God he was only going through his trials to make him something it wasn't God doing it it was Satan doing it he said now he'll try to tell you he'll do the same thing to you he'll try to tell you that these trials and things is your God trying to put punishment upon you notice it's you're being punished That's what Satan wants you to believe you're being punished now he said it isn't so it's Satan doing that and God permitting it to temper you to make you see if you are tied to this Earth by the Earth cares or whether your treasure is in heaven so God permits it the fire comes upon the metal to temper it make it stronger so the trial doesn't come to make us weaker the trial comes to make us stronger and into not strengthening our flesh but the trial exposes and weakens and brings back to life that the inner man might be strengthened that's why Paul could say that though the outward man perish but yet our inward man is renewed day by day is that right so he'll try to tell you so Satan notice he has come he he when God said have you considered my servant job and Satan then after all of this he he is there whispering to job you are being punished and job's looking at it you see there's influences for the things job looks at I'm being punished but yet the confusion is if I've done what God has asked me to do well let's just let's just speak a few moments in job in verse 1 job said my soul is weary of my life and I will leave my complaint upon myself I will speak in the bitterness of my soul So speaking of the situation and what is taking place I I'm going to appeal to The Compassion of the Lord in verse 2 I will say to God do not condemn do not condemn me show me wherefore thou contenders with me now let me just say this and we're not trying to elevate anybody but you see there there is a way that with job wherein that he's appealing to The Compassion of God that job within the midst of it he's not got an attitude but he's looking at the situation do not condemn me show me wherefore thou contend this with me is it good unto thee that thou should suppressed that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands and shine upon the counsel of the wicked hash thou eyes of Flesh or seeth thou as a man seeth are thy days as the days of man are thy years as man's days that thou inquirest after Mount iniquity and searcheth after my sin thou knowest that I am not Wicked and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand now if what we're reading here this would be job praying that's a pretty powerful statement thou knowest that I am not Wicked job's Got Confidence where he's standing because what you've revealed Lord that's what I've walked in I can't do nothing else but reveal in what you have walked in or what Norwalk in what you've revealed I can't do anything else but that now notice thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about yet thou destroyed me my my verse 9 remember I beseech thee that thou Hast made me as clay and wilt thou bring me into dust again you see what job doesn't know it's first of all it isn't God doing it it isn't God contending with him but job doesn't know that right job is looking at it you brought me forth am I going to go back to dust again here's the reality job does not know what conversation has taken place in heaven he doesn't know boundaries have already been put up you can touch everything but don't you touch his life but job doesn't know that job's a prophet right he had access to God by vision and revelation God could have easily opened that up and he could have saw that taking place did not Micah what's not Micah lifted by the spirit of God and said I see in heaven right by Prophet carried by vision and Revelation would come regarding the the situation and God could have done that right now but he chose not to God could afford any any length of time there's times sometimes that you'll know of certain things that maybe God will just something will be mentioned your way something will come your way or something will kind of stir in a way like my it just seems like maybe something you know God is moving and warning or or something in some way sometimes God will do that be very gracious to you and I in that manner you realize when the Bible says uh regarding that of the Sumerian age in the Book of Revelations it said 10 days Thou shalt have tribulation meaning 10 years 10 bitter years and brother bran would tell us how that God would so keep that back from the church yet it was written in the letter but he would not put emphasis upon that lest it would bring fear upon the people but to realize that when the situation would actually occur real Believers would stand by the quality of his life that was within them you realize that God what it speaks to you and I it isn't that God has a lack of confidence it's God knows what you and I have need of even the test even the trial that's coming our way because God's got a purpose in it all and God knows how to prepare you and I for that test and that trial oh we feel so ill prepare we wonder what's going on but yet God has prepared you and I for that moment and then in that moment God is Excavating more of himself in our lives what a paradox in it we're in the middle of it saying I don't know what all is going on but God said I've got everything just right where I want it I've got the excavator here I've got this equipment here I've got but Lord watch all this no all of this right here see this is what I have designed to bring out of you oh my mama like I told you before I'm not I'm not putting a raise in my hand to say Lord I want you to testify about me no I'm not raising my hand like that right because I'm sure if Joe would have had the choice job would have said God don't don't brag on me Lord surely I prefer my brother over here or my sister they are much better off than Lord God if if anybody deserves well I don't want to wish a trial on anybody anyhow let's go on verse 9 remember I beseech thee that thou has made me as the clay and wilt thou bring me into dust again hast thou not poured me out as milk and curdled me like cheese in other words job is speaking of that God you have fashioned me you have brought me forth everything has been set and so perfectly arranged in my life by you you have brought me to this place thou has closed me clothed me with skin and flesh and has fenced me with bones and sinews thou Hast granted me life and favor and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit oh I'll tell you as I read through this here in the Book of Job I don't know if the Lord will let me speak on it or not but you'll find over and over in places right in here where in the midst of when job is talking there'll be something raise up on the inside that he recognizes and it's things that I believe job don't even know what's being said in that moment but what is it it's that seed of God on the inside that's speaking out job identifies right here that I have been clothed in sinews and flesh that I am an attribute of God in other words this body that I'm in is just like this screen it's only to display you glory be to God thou has granted me life and favor in thy visitation hath preserve my spirit and these things now notice thou Hast hid in thine heart I know that this is with thee so here job is standing I know Lord that you have the understanding for what's taking place because I know you you're not the author of confusion you're a God of purpose job knows that by the Revelation job is is knowing this that God is a god of purpose that it's God that's drawn to his heart it's God that's revealed that of the perpetuation of the sacrifice of the burnt offering and how to have Fellowship under the shed blood so he knows that within this that God has the understanding that he has need of now notice in verse 14 if I sin then thou Marcus me and thou will not equip me from mine iniquity if I be Wicked woe unto me and if I be righteous yet will I not lift up my head oh my I love that that phrase right there even if I'd be righteous I will not hold my head up as though that I have done something because real true revelation of righteousness brings humility to the word of God recognizing that it's not by works that I have done but it's by grace through faith are you saved and that is not of works but we are his workmanship that it's not my righteousness because that ain't nothing but filthy rags but it's his righteousness he hath made him to be sin who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in Christ and if I'd be righteous yet will I not lift up my head I am full of confusion therefore see thou mind Affliction for it increases thou harness me as a fierce line who's he talking about God you're hunting me like a fierce lion and again thou show us thyself marvelous upon me thou renew us thy Witnesses against me and increaseth thine indignation upon me changes and War are against me could that be a prophet of God sure could we can go through all the rest of the prophets you see God God doesn't have a problem with our Humanity sticking out it's us as humans that gets problems with other people's Humanity come on now we get problems with other Humanity but you remember we're not United with Jesus Christ right we are a part of the body of Jesus Christ by the New Birth by the spirit of almighty God so it's not Humanity it's not Humanity that we're to be caught up with but in reality when I look at things like this I take encouragement from it I take encouragement from it in my journey because you want to know why we're faced with the same battles we're faced with the same battles and the same devil that came to job and told job you're being punished God's against you God's contending with you you would look at that and think about it that's the same thing he wants to tell you and I [Music] oh my and so when the enemy wants to say well if you were this if you were talking about a prophet of God right here one who had access to God by vision and Revelation you know what he goes to show you and I that God will only reveal and give understanding when understanding is needed but let me just say this whether God gave job any understanding or not it would never and could never Shake job off of that Firm Foundation because job did not know God by theology he wasn't talked into God he couldn't be tucked out of God amen it was a reality in his life now let's look in verse 18 here the same chapter wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb oh why why did you bring me here why am I here why am I here oh that I had given up The Ghost and no I had seen me I think our brother Bram says it in adoption series he talks about how he was you know talking to the Lord he said I just want to go on home I just want to go on home and be with the Lord I just I'm so tired all this here and he said the voice came to him and Whisper and said are you trying to dodge the troubles are you trying to dodge the trials brother Brown said forgive me Lord just give me Grace to go through he does not want to our Humanity does not want to go through it in that way right oh my oh but I had given up the ghost to know I had seen me I should have been as though I had not been I should have been carried from the womb to the Grave so he's telling God God this is what you should have done why did you even bring me here see job doesn't see any purpose job sees I'm incon this is confusion to me God said I've got you right it's right where I want you I'm letting Satan come and bring all this around but it's all working out of purpose I'm not against you but see job doesn't know that job doesn't know that oh my oh my all my days few cease thin and let me alone that I may take a little Comfort before I go wince I shall not return even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death see job even knew that in the midst of it even what was revealed in order for there to be a shadow there's got to be light present then Lord go I'm coming down the darkness job had this had been Assurance in his life I'm not lost he found me I'm not lost even if I go down by the grave that's what he's talking about but you will be there you even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death not deep dark Valley that ain't scriptural it's the shadow because in order to be a shadow there's got to be light presence and the same light that led us into light is the same light that will lead us from this Dimension into the next dimension oh a land of darkness is Darkness itself and the shadow of death without any order and where the light is as Darkness so think about it the ram picks it up here in the Hebrew series and you just spoke that particular morning when God bringing his his children into certain places like before the Red Sea and how God would bring him into that place and he says you know how Israel every time it came to a showdown they would fly loose and get weary and want to turn back and why did this happen to me but he said to another Brown said now after I got done preaching that this morning the strange thing of it is I I preached it as hard as I could and there was many that came to the Altar and questioned it why does this happen to me now well brother bam has just ministered was is how God will bring us into different trials and tests and he said I just finished preaching that this morning and at the end of the morning service he said there were still those who came up front and he says they asked the question why does this happen to me brother van said you see how it goes It goes over the top of the people's hands it's just the same people they didn't say it's the same people he said it's the same it's people what's he speaking of humanity so here think about it in a service that these people were setting in and brother Branham led by the spirit of God because brother Brown goes into the very next statements he's trying to get him to see what who was present and speaking that morning Jesus said you have eyes but you can't see he sent it to the disciples and they said Lo thou speak as plainly now we believe no man has to tell you anything because God shows it to you do you now believe after all this time he's getting him to realize who was it that was speaking to you this morning see people were in the midst of tests and of Trials and brother Brown was bringing that out within the Hebrew series bringing out through the Exodus journey of how God will bring us into certain places and then here we are at the Red Sea and my brother Ram says it like this he said no doubt the people thought well glory to God this is the trial and this will be the final trial there'll never be any more trials after this and the Red Sea open and he said here it was just one thing right after another God was proving right but this is what I want you to see you see how the enemy would want to and would so distract the people from recognizing God is mindful of your situation they were consumed with why is this happening to me and that's a thought that will come from our Humanity but you understand this is why we come together this is why we pray this is why we come to the house of God to receive encouragement and strength God's not going to yank us out of a trial God's not going to do an emergency exit like there's a door that all of a sudden you get up to the roller coaster and you realize you're a bigger chicken than what you really are and there's all of a sudden a gate you can pass on through no that's not how trials are there are no emergency Gates there are no trap doors but there is Grace and strength that God ministers to you and I that we can look in the midst of the trial and in a service like this say thank you Lord you are with me Lord you're watching me and God is encouraging you to do what continue to rest in his hands that he can mold and shape Our Lives oh my brother Brian goes on to say he said see you mustn't question anything to God for the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of the Lord and every trial is put upon you to prove you they're more precious to you in Gold so if God let a few light afflictions happen to you remember it's for the correction of you now remember trials are not God correcting us but the Trials come for the correction of us well part of us need what what is the correction of us you know God lets the trial come that our character might be molded I won't ask you to raise your hands but sometimes you might look you think Lord have mercy why does it seem like I attract these kind of people or why does it seem like this comes my where you know why it is because God says that's what's needed in order to bring out of you what I have in you nothing else will do it oh but I just want to sit and hear a wonderful preaching preaching is to encourage you right the minister of the word it cuts Stones positioning them into the body but remember the trial of your faith is that which is between you and God personally not God you're pastoring you you and God it's molding and shaping on the sacred Sands of God's grace it's for the correction of you now I know God knows sometimes let's just be honest we're slow learners right even though we realize this guy's our biggest enemy but we think a lot about it we think a lot of him or her whatever it is oh as you can tell I mean you we do that but you see God helps us don't look down on yourself God is helping you and I the test or trial is helping us to see the correction that's needed in me not that you're not that oh I did something wrong and God's correct no no no it's the molding of our character Hallelujah that's why sometimes we can spend a lifetime running from situations and we look at and think the same situations come in my way guess what there's one common denominator here and that's you are you hearing me now there's one common thing and that's you and that's me so it isn't that boy this person oh my brother so-and-so or sister so-and-so are this boss or that wait wait recognize God is not the author of confusion God permits these things that it might bring a reflection in us oh God help me help me Lord to be a real reflector not a deflector you understand even in the things that you or I can be right but yet it also will God will get right down into where is our attitude every son that cometh to God must first be chastened of God tried and child trained there's no exceptions now he says these afflictions are done and are brought about to see what attitude you'll take and they say Lord help me to have the right attitude I believe that's what the scripture says rejoice that's what real rejoicing is is to be able to have the right attitude that's what we're rejoicing is that in the midst of it to have the right attitude Lord you're in control I don't know what's taking place around me but Lord help me just to stand I want to submit myself to you Lord what's to be molded out of my life I want to yield to you that's rejoicing because you can sit right here in a whole glory to God and not really be rejoicing you could really have an attitude against God come on now but you see it's in the midst of the trout what do you do in the midst of the trial do you stand faithful in the midst of the trial do you Worship in the midst of the trial or do you withdraw yourself see all of that is attitude that's rejoicing rejoicing oh my oh my how many say Lord help me I got both my hands up if I had more I'd put them up if I could put both my feet up and stand right here and I'd do it God help me to have the right attitude right because we're still here in our mortality in our Humanity God's encouraging us notice there's a Proving Ground that's what this Earth is all about it's The Proving Grounds where God is trying your eye now think about this within it how that God would move in in such a manner that you know even where job all of this has taken place you know this doesn't phase God whatsoever God's not setting up there saying you've bragged on him he's questioning he's he's acting like I'm the one oh man oh my here I did I got the bragging on that brother bragging on that sister no no God God's not looking at it that way you know why because what God was bragging on was that part of himself that he saw in job [Music] he was bragging on his word because he is the word and we are a part of the word [Applause] God knew what job's flesh and Humanity would do in the midst of this time jump in even being a prophet he didn't have the understanding that you and I would be permitted and even yet tonight how many times have we heard messages and you you open a message and you're hearing a message and at the beginning of a message there'll be a statement brother Rand will make about trials and Proving Grounds but you see we need to hear that and be reminded and encouraged and God knows that but Satan was making him think this but he didn't they didn't change God's thoughts about Job whatsoever God's never had a new thought God's thoughts about job had never changed even like it was when discouragement had come to John when John could not understand why things were happening or weren't happening the way that he thought it was John had the right scripture John had the right scriptures but he's thinking about it is what hindered him he got his ego eye filmed over but I'm glad where there's a film there's still one who can break veils they'll repeat her God there was a longing inside of John Jesus knew Jesus never spoke one word against John he never said well that old sorry guy I tell you you know I wondered about him you know dressing like that and doing the things he did now look at him down there questioning no you see where we're anchored is on the Revelation and Jesus himself knew John was a spirit born man that was positioned in the word what did he what do you mean by that he knew all you've got to do listen I know what John's going through but you just stay around right here let him know what you've seen and then go tell him what is it I've got confidence in him he'll receive the word and be encouraged in prison oh I believe God would pass by our way tonight right here on Sheffield and God would encourage you and I might be in the midst of a test or trial but God said I've got some real sons and some real daughters down there I don't got to take them out of the trial I don't got to take them out of the situation but I'm just going to make myself more real to them in the midst of this trial glory be to God notice here in in John or in Job 14 5 notice how job would speak seeing his days are determined the number of months are with thee that thou has appointed his bounds that he cannot pass turn from him that he may rest till he shall accomplish as a hireling his name you realize job would go on by inspiration and I think it's the next chapter within there job would speak under inspiration of what it was to be a servant a hireling meaning bad we are we are Sons and Daughters of God but we serve his purpose and this is what job is aware of that we are here to serve the purpose of God and job looking upon this situation turned from him until he hath accomplish his purpose but to realize nothing nothing can take us until the purpose of God has been fulfilled job doesn't know Joe thinks this is the end of his life he doesn't know there's going to be a turning point here he doesn't know that he doesn't he isn't moving within that all he knows is I don't know what's going to happen but job can tell you one thing I know I ain't lost I know that I don't know how old it's going to come out but I know I ain't lost but he doesn't understand what's going on right here job 16 6 though I speak my grief is not a saged and though I forbear what am I ease so there's nothing that's actually bringing him release but now he hath made me weary God hath made me weary thou Hast made desolate all my company God hath delivered me to the ungodly and turned me over into the hands of the wicked he's as he said he's desolate all my company in other words all my friends I don't got nobody around me to encourage me even my wife even the maid turns when I ask her for some new sheets on the bed of course job wasn't even sleeping in the bed right everything my friends everything that was part of the trial job could have easily think about it in the midst of the trial and what's taken place he could have very easily loaded his gun and are you with me he could have released and became bitter against everybody that was around him is that right my where does time go I was at ease in verse 12 but he hath broken me asunder he also taken me by my neck and shaken me to pieces and set me up for his mark Joe who's done this God has done this his archers compassed me round about he cleaveth my Reigns asunder and doth not spare he poureth out my gall upon the ground he breaketh me with breach upon breach he runeth upon me like a giant job 17 6 he hath made me also a byword of the people so not only the friends that was all around him but remember job was regarded as a man of wisdom and understanding he was also a man that would encourage others he was one that God would use as a vessel to help other people and here was a man that's now become a byword when at one time as the scripture said I was as a tablet in other words God would give understanding through the vessel to help others but that's all part of the testing and of the trying think of this here in job 19. and verse 6. now know now that God hath overthrown me I'm reading these scriptures as they come we're dealing with how that you can see the effect of Satan wanting to make job think this is God punishing him know now that God hath overthrown me and have compassed me with his net behold I cry out of wrong but I'm not heard I cry aloud but there's no judgment there's nothing coming my way and remember in the earlier scripture job said I'm confusion why was he confused because job knew I've done everything Lord that you've asked of me I have everything that you've revealed to me done it does that mean that job didn't have mistakes no he wasn't saying that but what it did say was Joe knew there was a perpetuation Joe knew that when there had been mistakes that he had went and the blood had cleansed he was in fellowship with God and so his confusion was what's going on what's going on he hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass and he hath set darkness in my paths he has stripped me of my glory and taken the crown from my head he hath destroyed me on every side and I'm gone My Hope hath he removed like a tree he also hath kindled his wrath against me and counted me unto him as one of his enemies all if we could stop job right now and say job that's not true you are not his enemy you are his friend you are his buddy he has revealed his will to you he is not looking on you as this enemy because God does not change his mind what a powerful thought isn't it brother Brown preaches it's the rising of the Sun that morning and that night he preaches God does not change his mind starts in the very beginning of that service does God change his mind rehearsing going over what had just taken place that morning then he goes into rehearsing how that Satan will come and buff it at you punch at you poke at you try to make you think you don't got the Holy Ghost and on and on he goes in through all that what is it these aren't just titles of a message it's letting you and I know that when God has put his shield of approval upon our life that God does not change his mind God does not give the Holy Ghost and then take back the Holy Ghost we are sealed until the day of our Redemption glory be to God in the highest Hallelujah his troops come together raise up their way against me and Camp round about my Tabernacle he hath put my brethren once again you see how important this is he hath put my brethren far from me and mine acquaintance are very estranged from me there is multiple times in the Book of Job where job will refer to this at different times you know why as I said before when somebody says oh you know the sayings dicks and stones may break my bones or words will never hurt me that's a lie and whoever came up with a liar because words hurt it's the truth they hurt right but we're not here to glorify those things but it shows you right here of all this that job is feeling he's he's looking for encouragement if I can just be encouraged just strengthen and you know sometimes the way we encourage one another is simply by doing this and opening these things up right sometimes I think some of us need some Hearing Aids on here to roll them up when we need a garage door opener here alone and God just wants us to listen to here and be able to say praying for you brother I know God God's brought me through sister God's brought me through some things it may not be exactly alike but I know God is no respect to person and God ain't left you he's right there with you to help you and to bring you through we need that encouragement let me tell you something in the midst of all this right here you know what you know what job is receiving Satan is coming right up next to him and whispering God's punishing you God's punishing you same way that he'll come now think about how the devil will do that he'll come right around certain things can start taking place and he'll get right into our minds you know so and so where they don't care for you so and so don't like them don't get quiet on me now what would you do I will believe God's word above that line devil and I'll tell you this right now why because you entertain that you'll take something in the best thing to do is I want to believe the best about God's people I want to believe the best about another person say wait a minute here devil I am not going to receive that you say what do you mean God Is Not An accuser of the brethren are you with me well what do I do with an accuser act like your daddy throw him down throw him down God cast down the accuser of the brethren don't entertain those lies because look it might be failed but the same time I know this I know that but it might be those things are coming to you why don't you just turn and say God remember my brother in prayer Lord Lord I remember my sister Lord minister to them give to him Lord just what they have need of in their life oh I tell you what we do that sure is anything boy the devil be lickety split right out of the room right God help us let's just close here tonight but REM said when those things are come Upon Our Lives and how they would come at us he said I want you to remember when it seems like everything has gone wrong everything's gone wrong he said I want you to remember God has confidence in you [Applause] God has confidence in you you see what God is doing here right right here in this moment of of this time where we're standing in an end time standing in a closing closing of world's history standing in this moment but yet here's in a moment where understanding is coming like never before sure you know why we need it we need it the rest as the rest of the ages and every believer has stood like job stood down through time job's a type of the body of Jesus Christ all the way down through time and then at the end time understanding would come and God lets you and I know in through a channel that God's Got Confidence in US when God lets attest when God lets a trial come our way it's because he has confidence in you but then we'll just say it like this and I close here he says sometimes he said we him and we Haul about it but that's something that God has given you to overcome he knows you'll do it he's put his Trust in you so you want to know Lord do you trust me he sends tests and trials our way that's his confidence that's his Trust I said Lord make me more like you help me Lord Jesus help me Lord help me to have the right attitude with it no matter what the test no matter what the trial if it's something that's being said you know even misunderstandings that we can be misunderstood you know that's also a test or trial What attitude we're going to take within it what kind of attitude are we going to take I say Lord I want my attitude to be sweetened with you Lord Jesus I want it to be sweet Lord Heavenly Father Lord I realized it as we look over this Lord here this evening Lord just looking Lord upon job's life and in this moment Lord oh God how that Lord our hearts Lord are encouraged and challenged Lord at the same time Lord just how mindful that you are oh God and you know you know our Humanity but that's not anything you focus on so that's you Lord letting us know that we're not to be focused on it but Lord I pray that God that in the midst of these tests and trials and times the Lord help us Lord that we can have the right attitude Lord within it help us Lord I pray that in the midst of it Lord that that even as job himself Lord did not understand what was going on but yet Lord he was standing solid your Prophet called it like this flat-footed on that Revelation that you had given to him you had spoke to job personally Lord and though in this situation Lord God he did not have inspiration to understand what was going on he was trying to find the inspiration that he was trying to find Lord because as we read here earlier he said he knew that it was with you Lord that if he could just get job would write of this Lord and many times it would come Lord sometimes in two verses 3 Verses 4 verses five verses Lord in different chapters and his requests would be if I can just talk to him if I can just talk to him Lord sometimes the hardest times in our life is when you're silent and we're praying and we're asking Lord and oh God it's as though you remain silent that's the time lord when we become tested that's the time lord where the enemy Lord will want to try to move up Lord with many different types of accusations and things but Lord this is where we've got to be sure of where we're standing Lord amen and Lord Jesus to know that Lord God you are my righteousness Lord yeah You're My All In All Lord everything you've spoke to me Lord the things that God that you've convicted me on things Lord that you've dealt with me on Lord I've walked Lord and Lord to be moved Lord into that place with you Lord that father in the midst of these moments as your Prophet would tell us and take us through many examples in the scriptures that when you're silent that's the test that comes to see what kind of an attitude that we will take during that time help us the Lord I pray oh God I I realize the Lord Jesus here tonight Lord and maybe those Lord that are streaming or will stream it Lord I pray God tonight even as the word would come Lord and bring a reflection in our life Lord to realize Lord there is a ground that we can stand on Lord if there's been lives Lord that have been in and out and when the Lord attest has come Lord then right back out into the world oh the test never put us back out in the world but there is a place Lord God that we can come to Lord to where there's an anchor in our life to where there is no longer any place to go back to Lord I pray God tonight grant that Lord for each life granted Lord I pray God here Lord among your children Lord as father even in the midst Lord God of the weakness of our Humanity Lord God may you Lord strengthen us Lord I pray strengthen us the Lord God in these moments Lord father service after service Lord day after day Lord sometimes the Lord in the midst of that silence but yet Lord you'll come right through his service Lord maybe Lord listening Lord to a message Lord maybe Lord God reading Lord and the scripture's there and God you'll just speak to us Lord there'll be something that'll just strengthen us Lord to encourage us the Lord I pray God may we lord I pray be sensitive the Lord to your voice help us Lord I pray may we lord God I believe we know this Lord but may we be more aware of it that when we come to the house of God the Lord that we bring o God every request every petition and say Lord I need you to move Lord maybe Lord God isn't you coming and moving the situation on maybe it's you coming Lord and moving Me Lord may be Lord It's you coming Lord God to call me as the song Lord God that the writer had wrote Lord sometimes he calms the storms sometimes he calms me oh God granted Lord I pray Lord Jesus Lord we need you Lord I need you this entire congregation Lord we need you Lord God help us Lord that when we come together that we're looking Lord to you Lord help us not to be caught up Lord in our minds Lord God upon the things that are going on but help us Lord to take every one of these Lord and place them at your feet and say Lord I need strength Lord God my flesh wants to dodge this trial My Flesh wants to dodge this test but God I'm asking you for Grace Lord I need more grace Lord God to go through it Lord help me Lord I pray help me Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ granted Lord amen and amen oh don't you love him amen hallelujah we're not enemies we're friends we're friends the trial is not God positioning himself as mine enemy but the trial itself if Joe could only know if that would only open that channel that job had access to but you see job being a prophet it doesn't mean that a prophet can do it when he wants to do it it's God that opens it as he wants to open it right all the way through the scriptures on the Isle of Patmos when the angel would take John around what are these and the angel said and John said thou knowest what are they in the book of Zechariah he awake of me as a one as a man is wakened out of sleep and pointed to the seven golden candlesticks and said what are these he said thou knowest what are they right Jacob was presented with a coat of many colors that he gave Joseph and blood covered and his Brethren had said he died yeah Israel was a prophet God could have revealed it to him but God kept it why it was all part of God's plan some things there's things that God shows us and there's other things that God in his time he lets us know but in the midst of it don't let his silence or lack of understanding on something hinder you say Lord I'm going to worship you because you've got the understanding that I need I may not understand what's going on but I know you've got a hold of my life I know that and that's one thing that I can rejoice in I can rejoice in that Lord be to God the job could have only seen it job what's taking place is God called a testimony meeting as a matter of fact God had a series of meetings about you job he called for back-to-back times and he bragged on you but job didn't have that he didn't have that understanding he said brother Samuel what would that have done that would have given him the understanding to what was going on and what was taking place Hallelujah but you know what it just goes to show you and I that even though we don't understand but there's something greater than our understanding right for though I understand all Mysteries they'll understand all these things and have not charity on nothing but if I've got charity though I don't understand everything he'll give me my what I have need of when I have need of you love him tonight amen let's just stand amen Hallelujah amen let's just worship him here just a few moments amen go ahead you have something in your heart to sing Hallelujah so good to have been in his presence
