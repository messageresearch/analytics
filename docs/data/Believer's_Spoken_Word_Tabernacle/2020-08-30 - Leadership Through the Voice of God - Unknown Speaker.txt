the lord i just so appreciated the word of the lord here on thursday night amen just so thankful that brother wayne was able to to come by and i just so appreciate the ministering of the word it's kind of funny one of the first times that brother wayne and i met we didn't even meet get to meet and shake hands he said on the front row and i was ministering but then we got to meet afterwards and well we just kind of hit it off and we just just have just really of um just how he's had some real good fellowship and i just really i i really love brother wayne appreciate his desire his zeal for the lord i think you got him loud enough and uh so we we just we're just so thankful to the lord the word has come to edify us amen come to build us up so um i want to read one verse of scripture here and this is in jeremiah 37 verse 17. i'm going to just read that one first and then let me read a few more verses and i'll let you be seated but i want you to notice this scripture i'm taking this here first this is the very first meeting that zedekiah is going to have with jeremiah zedekiah is the last king before they go into captivity i want you to notice the reading of the words in verse 17 then zedekiah the king sent and took him out and the king asked him secretly in his house and said is there any word from the lord i want you to catch this he knows that jeremiah has contact with god he knows that jeremiah is the one whom god has sent to reveal his word to and through him and jeremiah said there is for said he thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon now a chapter later in jeremiah 38 17 where we're reading from last week here we come into the second meeting now remember jeremiah's already been cast in prison the dungeon and so even with that part of it you realize there's different places of court of the prison and then the dungeon would be the lost place so now when we take this up in jeremiah 38 the uh jeremiah has already been raised up out of the dungeon as we were looking a few weeks ago by vedmalek who is one that the word had found a resting place in his life to recognize not just that jeremiah has the word of the lord but he has an ear to be able to hear and a heart that can give place to that word when abamelec was raising up jeremiah even the approach that he took it was a display of how he was allowing the word to come into his life he was not haphazard but he allowed the word to come into power in his life so now zedekiah sends for jeremiah again thus saith the lord the god of host the god of israel if thou wilt this is something he has to do if thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of babylon's princess then thy soul shall live notice what he's talking about he didn't say everything will be peachy just like a picnic for you right we're talking about real life real life is not the uh necessities and things of this life but real life is that of our soul is where our soul becomes into his presence his life this is what he's drilling this is what a word is dealing with then thy soul shall live and this city shall not be burned with fire and thou shalt live and thine house it's a big responsibility this decision is going to affect a lot of people but if thou will not go forth to the king of babylon's princes then this city shall be given into the hands of the chaldeans and they shall burn it with fire and thou shalt not escape out of their hands zedekiah said zedekiah the king said unto jeremiah i am afraid of the jews that are falling to the chaldeans lest they deliver me into their hand and they mock me now who's this about how how is he taking the word you know the bible tells us in the book of isaiah god doesn't cast aside our reasoning but he says come let us reason together brother branham would tell us over and over we see when man rests upon reasoning he's already failed to begin when anything comes against the word you forsake that and take the word yes amen this is why brother branham would tell us in putting on the horm of god and throughout that whole time he would say when your reasoning speaks with the word of god then you move with it because you're not moving by your reasoning you're taking the word of god but if it speaks against the word you denounce that and you take the word you say is that possible for abraham's seed abraham see there's a greater prevailing power within you the seed prevails are you with me yeah one in a million the seed prevails all those all of those germs that come through there brother graham said i watched them when they took me to that cattle ranch and seeing all of that all of those germs going through there he said but the one that was able it crawled and it moved its way above all the rest of them and it fertilized that egg right verse 20 but jeremiah said they shall not deliver thee obey i beseech thee the voice of the lord which i speak unto thee so it shall be well unto thee and thy soul shall live what a promise amen god bless you bless the reading of the word i want to just take a thought and just looking to the lord of how he'll just direct us here this morning on leadership through the voice of god you know there's things that when god will ask of us sometimes it can seem so great and if you recall even in the time of israel what led up to this situation it wasn't that they weren't uh coming at the new moons at the sabbaths and not the feast days it wasn't that they weren't offering up lambs and everything and going through all their festivals all the feasts of the lord they were but it was something that was lacking in their life to where god seen it the way that they were offering and going about those things was a real lack of sincerity now please let me just speak here for a moment sincerity itself is not just a piousness of your body people remember brother brahman said many people they can they'll offer up you know this religion will tell them something and they'll sincerely approach that and he said they can be sincerely wrong yet god sent god's sincerity that god requires is is a humbleness of heart to his will and obedience this is what this is where the lord spoke to to to saul obedience is better than sacrifice if jeremiah would have told hezekiah because remember what zedekiah what zedekiah is hearing is not something new he's not hearing something different but yet there's a there's a desire to want to hear something different but judgment this is not the first time where judgment has been spoken god already spoke judgment is coming wrath is coming but zedekiah if if jeremiah would have said to him oh zedekiah this is the word of the lord go and get a thousand rams and go get lambs and offer all them up i think we could agree zedekiah would have known not only had that in store but he would have sent and did that readily but you see it was something deeper than the sacrifices of all those other animals they were sacrificing other animals but they weren't sacrificing their own will and that's what god had a problem with they weren't sacrificing their own will and their own life and this is where god was speaking through his word to try to lead zedekiah in the way of life that this sacrifice that i'm calling you to is a sacrifice of your own life and your own will now the scripture goes on if we can continue to read here you see there's a choice that's got to be made in verse 21 if thou refuse to go forth i want you to catch this it wasn't enough for zedekiah in his just to sit there and say well i agree with it the agreements must come to an action faith without works is dead it must come to an action to an expression through that life of what god has said and the only way that can happen that has to be supernatural and let me just preach here just for a moment when i say that it has to be supernaturally it isn't just something way out there but it's the impulse of the holy spirit that's speaking to your heart personally he is there ministering courage right there if you can only yield to that he will break a spirit that is hanging over you that tries to hold you back from surrender that's what brother bram said kept me back from giving my life to the lord there was a spirit that hung over me let me just tell you friends it's not personalities it's not well this is this person's temperament it's this person's personality we've got all of that but i'm going to tell you personality it will not overcome personality it takes a greater one to break that spirit to dispose of him and let him know where you can stand and say i deny your lies satan and i accept what god is speaking to me when you stand on the word listen to me you know what i'm talking about when you stand on the word you will experience a surge of the holy spirit moving down in your life when you take a stand upon that word what is it it's a real courage that comes with that word because this word has life it has power within it if you refuse to go forth this is the word that the lord hath showed me this is what god has showed him verse 22. behold all the women that are left in the king of judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of babylon's princes and those women shall say thy friends have set they on that means they've enticed you allured you through temptation let me tell you something remember the gates of temptation lust of the eyes lust of the flesh and the pride of life thy friends who is he worried about not about the chaldeans he's worried about the jews that are already there thy feet notice what will happen thy friends have set thee on and have prevailed against thee thy feet are sunk in the mire and they are turned away back so they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the chaldeans god's letting him know either you lead your home either you take authority and let the word lead you and you lead your home or god says i let everything will be taken captive are you with me and thou shalt not escape out of their hand but thou shalt be taken by the hand of the king of babylon and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire this is a big responsibility and decisions themselves i think as we have perhaps of my mind serves correctly and i think about it we uh decisions themselves the older you get they don't become lighter amen sometimes there's decisions we make just to say uh i'm not going to go check on this i'm having this pain or i'm having this ah i'm not going to go check on it i'm not going to go this and i'm not going to do that or i'm not going to do this or sometimes decision we make yeah we don't need to call a plumber right now or this or that and the decisions we make eventually they lead to a catastrophe they can lead to a a bigger thing we understand we understand the impact of decisions their decisions themselves are things that the word always sets before us a choice and i believe with all my heart that the as we draw closer and closer to the finish line we begin to recognize that every decision that we're making we just don't look at things in terms of saying well oh this is natural i can make this decision it ain't going to very matter no no i believe as we're getting closer to the finish line you start looking at decisions that you make and say though there may seem to be no sin nothing in this but if i go this direction or if i take this up or if i go on this measure how's that going to affect my walk spiritually you begin to think and you realize what's what what is causing that it's not that you're such a great individual it's because the word is gaining preeminence in your life and the word is bringing before you the clarity of the mark that you're pressing toward and everything else that is about your life that could seemingly be a priority it begins to fade away it's not saying that you get rid of everything in your life like well you know i i don't go hunting anymore i don't do this anymore or i don't mess around with wood anymore that's not what it's saying it's saying what it comes down to is is that the word itself has such preeminence in your life that you recognize that anything that will take away or hinder that i don't want that about my life it's the value of his presence the value of his word in your life so his decision was not just about him paul even told timothy you hear the words take take heed to the words i'm i'm i'm speaking to you because not only will you save yourself but you'll save others who hear thee because the words that paul had were the words of eternal life i notice zedekiah's response in verse 24 then said zedekiah unto jeremiah let no man know of these words and thou shalt not die few verses on down in verse 28 so jeremiah ebold in the court of the prison until the day that jerusalem was taken and he was there when jerusalem was taken his response to the word it's known by his actions instead of saying you know the word that god has spoke to you jeremiah this word is of such value and to listen to me it's not uh the worship of of of the prophet or the man's person but it's to recognize that is god's mouthpiece and to reference that word that god is speaking through that mouthpiece that that is the word of the lord it's not to be esteem lightly it's not to be well you know well you know this is just brother brown's thinking or there this right here let me just tell you there are things in there that we can look at and say well you know that was brother brown and he would say this is my thinking or whatever but let me just be very clearly i will take his thinking i will take that over top of any other man's thinking because the thing that he should have done is is jeremiah you're not going back to the court of prison no way but he prepare a place and say jeremiah you you come and you rest over here but instead he he came he wanted to hear what's the word of the lord has god changed his mind at all and then the word comes lets him know all you have to walk in is simple obedience and instead of that he says don't you say these words to nobody else and he puts him back in the court of the prison let me just tell you something right now we can come and sit right here god can come down and he comes down by his presence and by his spirit and it can be such a time of oh my goodness i felt so wonderful i felt so good just stay with me now but yet if we leave out of here and hear the word goes back to the court of prison in our life he's not allowed to come in in preeminence we've done no different than what zedekiah did don't allow the word to just say you can't come any further you can stand on the door but don't go meddling in my life but the word has come to change our life and the real reality to a believer there's sure there's a reality about it that our will and everything else but there is a greater there's a greater reality of a seed on the inside let me say this whether that seed has come to birth or not there is a prevailing power there that's in that seed that no matter what the enemy will try to do he can't get it out of god's sight he can't take it out of god's memory he can't cloud it up with all sin and doubt and unbelief he can't get it to a place to where god forgets about it god knows where his seed is and the quickening power moves over that sea it draws your life you may not even be sitting in church israel was scattered throughout the world but the trumpet sounded supernaturally to bring them back home and brother the holy ghost is a living voice it is the word of god that is sounding out to gather his children back home amen we can take no credit we can take no glory it's him this condition that was in judah and in israel they were they were divided they were a divided people there was a need for leadership yes amen there was a need for leadership he had zedekiah and all zero kind cared about was himself right but god's gonna hold him responsible he's got more to look after than just himself he's got his household to look after can i preach a little bit to daddies to husbands your wife wants somebody who lead in the home leadership is not being dismissive of your responsibilities it's you taking the role and leading in that home well she's more spiritual than i am that's error you already need to ask god for a deliverance from a complex in your life god by his word if god allows that to be and in your life that god is overstepping his own word i understand sometimes in situations maybe there's one who's serving the lord and their spouse is not serving the lord but to bring it down very with such clarity here that leadership itself there is a craving for leadership and the husband says well you know you know mama you take care of discipline you take care of discipline shame on you you're the one that's supposed to be leading in that you're the one that's supposed to be direction and administering the rod of correction you're with me now you see on these thesis of leadership there was a cry for leadership look at what his his whole party is is that oh my if you know if i don't wonder what's going to happen the jews they're going to deliver to the jews they're going to mock me and here the word of the lord speaks that this is what's going to happen your family your household all is going to be carried away he's he is focused on the wrong thing same thing when a daddy gets focused on i don't want to hurt their feelings i want to make sure they love me i want you know that sometimes will cause the biggest compromises because they want them to love them that's a selfish love your children and everybody will love you if you stand there and you'll hold them accountable and tell them the truth when they're wrong don't put it on everybody else that it's this fault well if they hadn't been so sensitive they wouldn't have got on you if they hadn't been there you need to take your direction and responsibility as a real man in your home there is an example that we see in the word when the word was delivered to us in this day it did not come haphazardly when she wash it that we wonder where we stand it came with direction to bring correction why we were off the mark we had to get brought back on the market so many times you see that it's a result of the spirit that started way back there under this feminist movement and that has come and have prevailed because the word has not been held as a standard are you with me now so daddy you're to know what's going on in your home sometimes there's sayings as husbands boy i'm saying we're just going to go with him there is a desire and that cry for leadership in that life for you as a daddy to lead the devotions in the home for you to stand there and and giving direction and leadership and to guide your home being the real spiritual man in the house being the one who stands there it's not about what you say it ain't about all that you say it's the life you live it's your life your testimony your direction and what they're going give them something to follow i believe that's go i believe that's the desire in our life but i believe many times the enemy complicates it and god brings it so simple it isn't that you've got to be a great scholar you've got to be able to put scripture together you got to be able to do that a little more i can tell you right now and many times even with teenagers and one of her more they don't care about all the scriptures you can put together and your children everything else don't care about all the scriptures you can put together they want to see a lie they want to see a life that they can follow are you with me we're not it's not something where we're dependent god is letting jeremiah know you've got a responsibility you've asked of the word if jeremiah if seneca will take this word and go right back into his home it will have an effect on his home boy it's quiet brother brown will take this many times some of these are very familiar quotes to us brother brian will tell us we see it he said a woman can't get out of her place until the man first gets out of his amen right many times where you see it's not listen to me even as a pastor it's not going around saying sister you shouldn't have said this sister you shouldn't have done that many times that's a key that there's a missing link of leadership in that home when sisters walk around with their going about and taking their own opinion well don't you feel this and i feel the church ought to be like this and i don't feel i feel the church ought to be like this if that's going on i don't know but god is speaking the bible says the women is to learn in silence and to be subjection to their own husbands if they are to learn anything let them ask their husbands at home you know what that speaks there ought to be leadership at the home that if there are questions not that that man has all the answers but that he is in contact with the source of every answer listen friends the word is not against you it comes to help you there's a there is a cry that goes out for leadership and this is what god was responding to to to the cry for leadership there was a condition that was present there and there is an appointed channel let me just move here just just try to pick up the pace there is there is a channel god has channels of leadership yes and when we we see that here the lord jesus he's asked a question and in john 6 28 and they said unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god you see they're seeing they're they're they're seeing things take place and they're and they're asking him what should we do that we could work the works of god look at the simplicity of it jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that you believe on him whom he hath sent amen that's the work of god now brother brown picks this up in spirit spoken spoken word his original seed and he's bringing it down through the scripture here that of moses that of samuel and he goes in here in paragraph 378 he says this is a law of god god's law is to receive a vindicated servant remember jesus told him he said um you know he said you you'll receive one who comes in his own name but you will reject him who comes in his father's name the father's name is his life his character his nature made manifest not just words but it's a life that is made manifest a real prophet of god he's one with that message that message is being lived out in his life the character the nature of god is on display amen hallelujah let me just be very careful let me just be very honest with you you take away the lord jesus christ and remove that from brother branham's life there wouldn't be a going on you recognize these were not and i know it's been seemed very elementary these are not the thoughts of william branham amen was a servant just like this microphone that brother wayne used the other night it can't speak that's right you can sit here all you want and say brother wayne talk to me brother wayne say something brother wayne said brother wayne this is not brother wayne but this is an instrument that brother wayne used amen and that's why god moves he uses instruments that are surrendered to him that's god's law he says in john 13 20 verily verily i say unto you he that receives whosoever i sinned receives me and he that receives me receives him that sent me oh he sent a vindicated servant he said it's a law of god to receive it and it goes on and i'm just just bear with me i'm just going to read this he said which one of you can condemn me of sin let me show you god's word see if you believe it see if god vindicates it in you and let me speak of myself if i speak of myself i'm a liar but if i speak of god and god speaks through me by his word then it's the truth then who believes the word of god near you now notice he says jesus said he that receives them that i send receives me them that he sent and them that receives me receives him that sent me he says you can only serve god as you believe the servants that god sins amen the citizen a mcdonald's menu amen there's things on the mcdonald's menu that i might prefer how do we get to mcdonald's you know how it is when you ask your wife what's for dinner and she says anything then there's other times you're like hey all right there's things that you prefer but it's all food but don't let your preferences keep you from eating amen that's what paul dealt with in the corinthian church they allowed their carnality to rise in preferences instead of recognizing it's god who does the planting it's god who does the watering it's god who brings the increase it's to be it is such a blessing to be able to recognize that it's him is that right so you believe the servants that god sends you can only serve god on earth as god's servants that sent on earth by divine inspiration interprets the word to you paul here in two places in the scripture first corinthians 14 and also 11 1 you follow me as i follow christ you can say paul i don't need you i'm going to follow christ you can't you can't you can't you do away you do away with paul try to do away with john the baptist you can't these are connections to the throne it's not the man but it's the word that comes forth to prepare an entrance amen they're lives that are longing to serve god luke 10 16 he that heareth you heareth me he that despiseth you who despises me he that despises me despises him that set me god speaks his message through his servants now you know paul uh he we we many times we quote hebrews 13 8 if you go there hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever it's him all right hallelujah when it all comes down to it it's him amen within a service when it all comes down to it it's him amen he's the this is the objective is that he is the one that we see that we look in the word we see him we see where our lack is and we see the grace that has come to catch us from where we are to where we ought to be that's the power of a word that god has revealed there's a quickening power behind this word amen but the word the verse right above it goes in conjunction with it remember them which have the rule over you that rule is not the rulership of man over man god has appointed by gifts his servants not men of elevation servants what are they to do serve his will serve his people serving things that goes against their own wow a will their own wants too it's not about them it's about them serving god's will they're not perfect neither are you perfect but you see how god will chose to confound the wise then god will take fallible men and he will reveal himself to be the infallible god where he will take more than just your eyes and ears to see and hear it will take a spiritual endowment of the holy spirit to recognize that it's not the word of brother branham it's not the word of samuel browning or dwayne lawson or on and on but this is the word of god and so your confidence is not in the fallibility of that man but it's in the infallible god of an incalible letter that cannot fail [Applause] that's what we're under amen remember them who have the rule over you have spoken unto you this is what this is the true rule the word amen amen if it's a man we're still lost if it's a man we're in trouble but simon what kind of kind of car should i buy one you can afford save your dime save your text because i'm not here to tell you what kind of car to buy brother sister i've got confidence in the holy ghost i know him that way i preach him the way i know him i got confidence in him by love affair that there's a desire within your heart and this word as it keeps coming it's transforming us and it creates even a greater desire arises in our heart to please him amen i believe with all my heart a greater sensitivity to where when something there is going wrong he's there to alert us [Music] that's my confidence in him who has spoken unto you the word of god whose faith followed bless him lord faith is a revelation it's got to be that revelation the man said in one place he said it's the absolute that's held over that congregation amen what is that absolute it's jesus christ it's a word that god has sent in this hour it's the holy ghost praise the lord whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation if it's just a man when that man dies your faith dies but if you're following a revealed faith it will take you higher amen it'll lift you higher is that right under the authority of that revelation we rise in new heights now notice this is here even before zedekiah in jeremiah 29 2019 because they have not hearkened to my word saith the lord which i sent unto them by my servants the prophets these were not words that were sent to another nation it was sent personally notice rising up early and sending them you'll find that many times in the scripture rising up early rising up early god made it a priority it was set first to send his word to his people you see leadership itself it comes there's a vision it's a reality it's a faith the bible talks about with abraham the word of the lord came to him by vision you know when god spoke to abraham come away from your kindred come into a land i'll show you how blessed thee so forth he had to obey the voice of god when i say had to it wasn't somebody there pressuring him but it became greater than every other pool and he was willing to set aside everything to move into that channel amen it's the same thing that with when samuel samuel when samuel is here there is an open vision that is given of the word there becomes an opening within that word for the children of israel that's the mercy of god you see this is where god would express and i don't have time to read this but when god would speak even to with israel and how that he would guide them and he would lead them david would pick it up in the psalms and he would speak their the spirit of christ speaking to him that i i will guide thee i will instruct thee i will teach thee in the way i will guide me with my own eye and and the spirit of christ is letting it be known uh to that to you and i don't be like the horse or the mule that's got to have bits in their mouth and they've got to be turned here and there don't be like those who have no understanding what's he saying let the word the eye of god let the holy spirit be the guide of your life follow him for what he's trying to lead you into he doesn't lead you into bondage you're in bondage you need to be led into liberty amen and then the more as we're yielded to him that understanding there is liberty that is given by that of the spirit of god within the soul of the believer and it just keeps on working in our life a loosening and a loosening and a loosening that's why the scriptures would say it didn't say whoever could be pushed by the spirit of god right those that are pulled by the spirit of god said those that are left you see it's one thing for the spirit of god to say this but it's another thing for our heart to say yes lord that's leadership amen i'm saying like this that's receiving leadership he can say it but we must have a heart that says yes lord i side with that of the word we know how this is in our own life there are things that sometimes we can become enslared in our own feelings complexes can develop hard feelings or resentments or other things and we can become ensnared in that but when the word comes forth don't draw back right but say yes lord amen side with the word and when you side with the word and say yes lord don't even entertain a thought of how's this going to be or how's this going to happen if the word is speaking to you stand upon that word and say be it unto me lord according to thy word for jesus said my sheep they know my voice this is why even when you you know you can sinner uh brother branham would use the the example of the pool of bethesda they were all gathered around that pool of bethesda many were healed right there have been many that had come in the water when the angel had come down in a certain season right is that right soon as soon as that one stepped in the water there was no such thing as waves keep on going it ceased it was supernatural but they were sitting there gathered in that place because they knew there was a visitation had confidence in that right this is why brother brown would say the water could not say look at me look who i am it wasn't the water it was their faith in the angel stirring the water the faith in god's word and it brought deliverance in their life that's why brother brown when he makes that statement and this is in conjunction with this when he stands there and he says let me just let me just read it like this he says i'm just your brother by the grace of god but when the angel of the lord moves down it becomes then a voice of god to you he said if i offended you by saying that forgive me but i felt that might have been resented but i am god's voice to you and i'll say it again that time was under inspiration i felt bad about it the first time but it repeated it you see just a pool of water but when the angel of the lord came down it became more than a pool of water it became a place of deliverance when he comes that's what makes the difference when he comes in your house that makes a difference when he comes in your life that's what makes the difference [Music] [Applause] the impotent man who was laying there he didn't have nobody to help him [Music] is that what he said who do i have to help me i need somebody to help me and carry me down there i can't get there why are you still here because i know god's moving amen he needed help for somebody to carry him to where he needed to be the god who sent the angels angel after angel age after age are you with me that same god came down and where that man could sit there and there was no doubt there were things that were piling up about his life of you've tried before you've been sitting here before but you never got anywhere but his faith was not in himself he knew i'm here this is where god is moving and he stayed there brother his faith in that it invited the god of glory when he could not get to the water he couldn't move himself but the god of glory came down to where he was [Music] hallelujah amen that's the reality of the word coming to our pathway to our life it's not us with the ability to get to god it's god getting to us behold i stand at the door and knock here in the scripture i'll go back to the first part of jeremiah 38. i'm not going to pronounce all those try to pronounce all those names in verse 1. we would be here a month or sundays but the words that jeremiah had spoken unto all the people saying this is what the word that was spoken thus saith the lord he that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence but he that goeth forth to the chaldeans shall live for he shall have his life for a prey and shall live his life it shall be a reward jesus said if you keep your life you lose it but if you're willing to lose your life you you keep your life is that right you receive life this is why listen the word when the word of leadership listen praise the lord leadership by the word does not leave you in your same condition leadership by the word it shows us where we are where we need to be it has a clarity this is where we are this is where we need to be so leadership by the word is not an emotion it's not a feeling are you with me this is why as the word came in this hour it came to bring such a stability in our life the world has rejected it because the world for many of them they go to church and all they have is a great emotional time but they don't live in the word that's not leadership that's called being pinned up for slaughter are you with me leadership is there to lead us to direct us to guide us hey i believe in emotion you understand we i just say it like this we're balanced i'm not you understand exactly where i stand on that there's people that's when completely off to another direct that's not even my focus if they want to go that route there's plenty that in the scriptures even that brother wayne was saying standing here and quoting that scripture on thursday night if they hold that peace the rocks will cry out it's speaking of the god that would even make you stand and worship let it be that god that stands in the depth of your life when all hell is breaking loose against you you've got one on the inside that same one that descended in revelations 10 and stood with his hands up that same god is standing inside of your life hallelujah that same god who took the seventh star of this age and he revealed himself through this message through this prophet it took a life that was surrendered to god that the word might stand and be raised in power amen that word raised in power says we don't need church programs preach amen hallelujah five ways to overcome drugs three ways there's one way one truth one life you don't rehabilitate demons they're meant to be cast out god never made you as the daughter of god or a son of god to live with devils your life was meant to be an inhabitant of almighty god [Applause] hallelujah that's why so much so that even after you've been sealed with the spirit of god there might have been trouble that's come in your life and this is why the spirit of god would say give no place to the devil give no thought to the devil give no divisive thought to the devil amen let the word have free course if you can only recognize why does the devil do that why does he try to come that way because this word he is trembling this word exposes him this word takes authority over every devil and when you can receive it as the word of the lord let me just tell you the scepter passes to you hallelujah amen glory thank you lord you don't have to ask the devil cannot this cannot you don't have to ask him you're not his you're not his servant but sam you don't know what i did you don't know what i did i'm not talking about what you did i'm talking about the what the words calling you to right now amen hallelujah there's a greater one here amen amen the call was to go out go out and give your life destruction is coming come out from the sin of unbelief this is what the spirit of god said let us go without the camp when jesus was standing there the bible as it as it declares he suffered without the gate go forth unto him bearing his reproach go beyond traditions well i believe brother branham was a prophet of god go beyond say i am the one who god sent the message for [Music] [Applause] i'm that you that he said behold i send them to you elijah the prophet i'm that you knew beyond sound barriers this city i want you to catch me whoever remains in this city this city think of how many things david would write under inspiration even many of them that will come in the millennium and future home but they were also even in that time how david would recognize even god's choice how jerusalem was looked upon how it was favored by god but you recognize the city itself was not the bricks and the mortar these bricks out here in this building they ain't changed much since we've been here since 97. these bricks ain't changing man they got a little cracks in them here and there but they ain't changed much right the mortar but you see the real building is right here this is the real building there's mortar between those bricks out there that is put to hold them bricks together those of you know as tile layers and whatever more if you don't get that mixture just right that grout that goes in between the tile just like the mortar it becomes brittle and can hold nothing together and that's what god let him know you have there has been mortar that has been given to you that's untempered in the book of ezekiel what was the untempered mortar prophets prophesying to them peace peace everything's gonna be all right just sow your seed money on yeah everything's going to be all right god don't care it's all right blessing lord you believe a message don't you brother you love brother branham don't you pray are you going to preach with me now it is true that he said all that you ever loved and love you will be there i don't try to divide or separate or try to bring all that understanding but i know there's got to be a life that follows it i know there's a lot of grace and a lot of mercy of what god maybe had told as he told the prophet at certain times but i'm telling you a real life it gives itself to this word and it's transformed brother it loves this word thank god for this word why [Applause] i think you understand that verse 3 thus saith the lord this city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of babylon's army which shall take it therefore the prince has said unto the king we beseech thee let this man be put to death here's what the princes are saying for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city and the hands of all the people in speaking such words unto them he wasn't weakening them he was strengthening them he was trying to strengthen them in the right things but they regarded this message as treasonous to the nation of israel are you with me now they regarded it as treasonous but remember what god was calling them to was what they fell from treasonous to their first birth but god was trying to let them know there's a greater reality to line yourself up with yes he was trying to call him to that greater reality look what look how the scripture says this is what they said for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people but the hurt this man jeremiah he's not seeking the welfare of this people you know what the word welfare is shalom he's not seeking the shalom of the people see the reasoning the reasoning of man well it's coming against me it's against us it's not he was trying the word was coming to try to liberate him amen try to set him free it came for their welfare it was coming to minister to their soul this is why god you know he would speak here think about it it's so contrary to to the thinking of of of the earth of worldly thinking everybody wants to be so lovey-dovey and what i mean by lovey-dovey they really don't want to be lovey they want you to condone if you're against what i'm against then you're a hater david said i hate which thou that which thou hates o god amen if it's against god's word then i hate it [Applause] if it's for god's word then i'm for it let me just stay here this is why god would say as many as i love i chase him and rebuke it's a word of leadership that god would give us jesus said when the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth let me just move on to second chronicles 36 can i have just a few more moments this scripture goes and it accounts here in second chronicles when zedekiah and come on the throne he was 1 and 21 years old when he began to reign and he reigned 11 years in jerusalem and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord his god and he and humbled not himself before jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the lord now we don't have anywhere in scripture second kings 24 jeremiah 52 these portions we have nowhere that shows that zedekiah was rude or spit in his face or anything like that but you see it was more than just his demeanor of person god looks on the heart while the rest of the world if we take isaiah 53 the rest the rest just eyes of man are seeing another man die but in the eyes of god it was much different he saw the travail of his soul he saw that that surrender that offering up of his life completely that you and i might have life see god looks to the depth of that life that's why there's times listen to me carefully this is why there's times i've just been pastoring here to come in here a few in 18 years coming since since i've been standing here there's been times that you can look at things i want to see you want to see lives move on with god but i can't force that right and the other part that's true really tremendous is is i can't see i can't see unless god gives me insight into it of how god's moving in that heart sometimes a person can set and it might seem no outward movement but their heart is being inclined to the word of the lord this is where this is where it takes us as believers to trust in the lord corrections got to be given i agree you understand with me but there's also it takes a discernment of the holy spirit this is where the trust comes in and and the rest in the word of god that god himself it's him that starts to work and he that begins to work will finish the world jerubal has hands have laid the foundation he shall also bring forth the capstone in that life sometimes god has to come and stir us up a little bit and he'll have to stir up lives and maybe get a little bit comfortable and he has to remind us hey you can't keep staying in this realm they're wonderful you're giving your life to the lord go on make another step take another step in obedience be baptized in the name of jesus christ have you received the holy ghost receive the holy ghost keep moving on in the word amen oh god let my heart be so given and friends it just doesn't stop with the baptism of the holy ghost it there is a continual quickening and growth in our life that quickening keeps quickening quickening quickening quickening quickly until the very change of our body this is the evil that he did in the sight of the lord is god humbled not himself before jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the lord let me just say this zedekiah had a rich heritage he knew what it was to see a humble life before him josiah was his daddy josiah was a man that when he kept the passover this is what the scripture said there had not been a passover kept since the days of samuel it leaped solomon since the days of samuel he had a god describe josiah as a tenderness of heart a humbleness of heart a heart that when the word was found he wept he gave himself to it where israel had allowed it to become kind of dust covered let me just say this the message that god has given us in this hour its full leadership are you hearing me it's leadership that even addresses present social issues are you hearing me not according to how the flesh sometimes would lack it but remember don't allow the spirit of this world to lead you it is leadership that god has given knowing that things that were sowed as seeds of where it would lead to leadership is all around the reality is everybody is following somebody everybody's following somebody we want to be found following thus saith the lord amen i'm going to say this very clearly if lives and hearts would give themselves even more to the word and take the value and the authority of the word they wouldn't be getting caught up in all of this other mess it's leadership that god has given those things are traps it's traps how many times the spirit of god has been saying that to us here brother wayne comes in here i don't talk to the men that come in here and preach i don't know you know what i've been preaching i don't talk to about those things but here it comes in and here the spirit of god brings it up and lets it be known these things are traps let me just tell you something as much as it is for the traps about all this other stuff out here is traps if these things take preeminence in your conversations if that's number one at your dinner table if that's number one in your home you need to evaluate the order i'm talking leadership here i'm talking leadership those words do not bring life you all understand you know me mo those of you you've been here with me you know me you know exactly where i'm standing i'm not a guy who has my head in the sand but neither am i going to be a guy who's going to be influenced by well this one says this brother samuel i don't listen to none of those fake news but you indulge in even all sorts of well this man this man saying this and this man saying that god has sent us a message i said god has sent us a message that doesn't mean that i don't read the newspaper that don't mean that i don't look up the weather on my app and see is it a good time to plan it simply means that that voice is what has priority in my life if there's anything that starts putting my direction anywhere else it is a hindrance [Music] if god put me here then it's god's duty to protect me he's my provider are you with me amen that don't mean i don't wear a seatbelt are you with me i don't mean that i don't have home insurance that don't mean that i don't have a security system right but my trust is in the lord when you talk to me i don't talk to you all about my security system oh i got this heating motion detector i got this labeled up on all the windows i got this if somebody even thinks about let's put on because the world we live in all right but that ain't my priority oh i'm telling you what's the truth we might as well just it's leadership it may not be anything knocking down walls but if you receive a word it'll help you he didn't humble himself let's just stop here what a value that god sees on humility humility it's not about us really being able to do anything but what's real humility is to recognize when you're standing in the presence of one greater of one who can do something about your need about your life you know that that challenge is always put before us you know sometimes on the job one thing that i prayed when i was teaching i realized i don't have all the answers i've realized in pastoring i don't have all the answers i've realized as a husband i don't have all the answers i've realized as a dad i don't have all the answers it's not that we don't want to give answers because we want the desire within our heart is to want to help somebody sometimes we're saying what what can i say but what's important is that you know him who is the answer there are many times within teaching sometimes the answer to the question i had i had to be willing to hear and to listen and sometimes the people whom came who came to me well most of the times in those situations they weren't believers but there was a wisdom that god would god would allow me to tap into that would help to address a certain problem brother samuel who did you give glory to well i would thank the individual but i would say lord thank you for being merciful to me and i thank you for preparing my heart to be able to receive it that i didn't stand there in a way and say well who's this it's to recognize we're in the presence of one who is greater than ourselves this is what the scriptures would say submit yourselves unto god humble yourselves in the sight of god he will exalt you humble yourself under the mighty hand of god notice the mighty hand of god and he will exalt thee in do time we could really preach on that like the scripture says if there be any sick among you let them call for the elders of church anointing with oil if there be any sins it shall be forgiven it shall be well but it didn't give the time when it says humble thyselves under the mighty hand of god and he shall exalt thee in due time god brings forth out of our life as we humble ourselves to him and to his presence to recognize sometimes that i had together a group of i don't know how long ago it's been now but a lot of the young the married families and the younger ones children and things and we were talking there at the house and i was expressing this very part about leadership sometimes sometimes that is a person they kick in trouble simon you don't have all the answers no neither do you matter of fact brother brown tells us in the message he said if you get a get around a man and he's telling you he's got all the answers he said you better run from him we're not led by the wisdom of man we're led by the holy spirit delivering his word to our life he will lead you and guide you into all truth i tell you god has been doing some wonderful things right here in our little assembly and i thank him for how that he is working touching hearts touching lives and moving by his presence amen samuel what does it what does it cause in you i want to see more i want to see more of him i want to see more of him i want to give myself more to him amen i want him to have the uppermost seat this word that we preach this word it packs within it a power this is not my thoughts this is god's word it packs a power and a courage to move your life into what god's desire is for your life amen leadership leadership not always something that sounds way out there but it comes in a still small voice but it's with certainty if zedekiah could have only received this yes he would have received the authority to cast down his imaginations his reasonings that were holding him back he would have received a word that could have led him he would have led his home it would have preserved it would have preserved his life he would have preserved the life of his family but he had a choice to me i say this morning we're standing in the presence of that same god we've got choices to make we've got a choice to make lord i want to serve you i want to surrender and give my life fully to you we've got choices to make us husbands as fathers i want to surrender my life and lord you to be the first place and preeminence say well brother simon i'm not a very good this it ain't about you being very good it's depend on him depend on him he's the one to lead you he's the one to guide you and that same god that deals with your life even as the spirit of god is moving so sweetly and it just is even here this morning a different it's not a different holy spirit but it's a you you understand just how that god is ministering in such a measure and such a in such a a personal way to give direction in life sometimes every service itself is different i you i perhaps you already see that already in different times it's not about how this or that it's about him it's about him coming the word taking an effect in our life he let him lead you and guide you he will take you in your life he'll take you you can't get to the baptism of the holy ghost but he will take you there but i will say this to you you can't get to your healing but he'll take you there you can't get to your deliverance but he'll take you there amen if you can just say lord i believe yes i submit myself i cast down my reasonings i can't figure this out i can't look at all this i refuse to look at my reasonings and my imaginations i'm gonna look to you lord look away to jesus i'm gonna look to you lord i'm gonna look beyond i tell you the same god it's not a man can inspire you to look beyond that you could a man can come here he could speak have everything put all together seemingly and it would leave you without any vision but there's a vision that comes through that word that it comes to you and says there's a possibility there is a possibility there is a reality that you can walk free there's a courage that comes with that word there's a strength maybe there's a string that's been about your family something that's been throughout your family and you can look back and say it's how to hold here it's how to hold there but you makes you look to the lord and say lord in me you're the cycle breaker hallelujah you recognize there's a greater strain that comes from predestination a strain from the tree of life the strain from that seed that's on the inside of you god opening your eyes to see victory where the rest of them saw nothing but giants saw nothing but defeat but david went down there when david saw goliath all david could see was victory hallelujah when joshua and caleb looked over there in the land all they seen was victory because it was the word that gave them vision they took what the word said beyond what their eyes saw eyes are more than this it's a mental as well let's say i take the word of the lord amen i take what god has said i take that word i'm willing to walk in that
