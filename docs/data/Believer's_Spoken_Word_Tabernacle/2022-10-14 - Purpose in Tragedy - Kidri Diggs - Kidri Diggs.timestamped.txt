[43:02] right now
[43:05] in the name of Jesus Christ we pray
[43:07] church amen amen amen praise the Lord if
[43:12] you have your Bible let's turn to the
[43:13] Book of Ruth
[43:15] chapter one
[43:19] Ruth chapter one
[43:37] verse 1.
[43:39] I came to pass in the days when the
[43:42] judges rule that there was a famine in
[43:45] the land and a certain man of Bethlehem
[43:48] Judo
[43:49] when went to Sir John in a country of
[43:52] Moab and his wife he and his wife and
[43:56] his two sons
[43:57] in the name of
[43:59] in the name of the man was elimelech and
[44:02] the name of his wife
[44:04] Naomi and the name
[44:07] of his two sons Milani
[44:10] chalian
[44:12] ifronites of Bethlehem Judah and they
[44:15] came into the country of Moab and
[44:18] continued there and remember like
[44:21] eliminate Naomi's husband died and she
[44:24] was left and her two sons and they took
[44:28] them wives
[44:29] born of the women of Moab the name of
[44:33] one was offer and the name of the other
[44:37] was Ruth and they dwelt there among
[44:41] about 10 years and my life and Chilean
[44:44] died also but of the both of them and
[44:49] the women was left
[44:51] of her two sons and her husband
[44:55] I mean let's go to Psalms chapter 37.
[45:03] Psalms chapter 37.
[45:07] this is one of my favorite songs this
[45:09] song is packed
[45:11] amen With the blessings of God go back
[45:15] and read it sometimes it's packed but
[45:17] we're gonna pull out uh verse 23.
[45:21] Psalms 37 verse 23.
[45:26] the Bible says the steps of a good man
[45:28] are ordered by the Lord and He delighted
[45:31] in his way
[45:33] though he fall he shall not be uttered
[45:37] passed down for the Lord upholded him
[45:40] with his anger
[45:42] amen may the Lord blessing of his word
[45:44] you can have your seats
[45:49] church I believe that we are in the last
[45:52] days
[45:54] and you know the Bible speaks of
[45:56] perilous times you know there's there's
[45:58] a lot of things that the Bible talks
[46:00] about will be happening in the last days
[46:02] and tonight my subject is
[46:04] purpose in tragedy
[46:07] purpose in tragedy
[46:10] you know when we think of the word
[46:12] tragedy you know most of the time we
[46:14] think of her
[46:16] you know we we we think of discomfort or
[46:19] or or or we think of pain
[46:22] but if I could say it like this it took
[46:25] a tragedy for us to be here tonight
[46:29] it took the death to bury a resurrection
[46:32] to the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[46:36] which truly was a tragedy to kill an
[46:39] innocent man
[46:40] to kill a man who never did any wrong
[46:43] when they were men who murdered indeed
[46:45] all kind of other things and they went
[46:48] free oh what a tragedy right you know
[46:51] but it took that tragedy that the
[46:54] purpose of God will be fulfilled
[46:56] Hallelujah so church if we can look at
[46:59] our lives a little bit different we want
[47:02] to change the angle of Our Lives tonight
[47:04] because a lot of times we look at what
[47:07] we're going through and the first thing
[47:08] we say is oh the devil no the devil is
[47:12] not in control
[47:15] so I'm very careful about how I speak
[47:18] when I'm going through things now it
[47:21] took me a minute to get there but now
[47:24] I'm here so I don't look through the
[47:26] eyes of of of of of of of
[47:28] dysfunction I don't look through the
[47:31] eyes of depression I don't look through
[47:33] the eyes of disaster but I look through
[47:36] the eyes of purpose amen
[47:38] because with God Amen in everything
[47:41] there is a purpose
[47:43] because the public God said God hardly
[47:46] has a purpose in everything or he would
[47:49] be the author of confusion and God shall
[47:52] be off of confusion so if you look at
[47:55] your child right now there's a purpose
[47:58] you must say brother Jesus I lost this I
[48:00] lost that oh it was such a tragedy but
[48:03] it was a purpose
[48:04] before I go any further I know a brother
[48:07] in Canada his wife died of what of what
[48:11] the doctors say breast cancer and you
[48:13] know how we do we we stand and we pray
[48:15] and we believe and we call on God and we
[48:18] fast and we stand there and say Lord in
[48:21] your word you promised us healing but
[48:23] what if God don't ask
[48:37] but if he doesn't answer it's still for
[48:40] your good
[48:41] [Applause]
[48:42] Ness
[48:45] amen and you know this brother you know
[48:48] his wife ended up passing and I believe
[48:51] that they had kids and so forth and
[48:54] teenagers and young adults and when she
[48:57] passed you know it was it was such a
[49:00] tragedy
[49:01] the whole family was devastated
[49:04] the president's husband who was a
[49:07] God-fearing man
[49:10] a god-free
[49:12] God-fearing husband living in a
[49:15] God-fearing household and sometimes when
[49:17] things happen it looks like we're right
[49:20] where we're supposed to be in God
[49:22] so when things happening we begin to
[49:24] question Lord why is this happening I'm
[49:27] not silly I'm not doing anything wrong
[49:29] there is a purpose
[49:31] yeah
[49:32] [Applause]
[49:34] see who can understand the mind of God
[49:36] hallelujah his ways are not our ways his
[49:40] thoughts are not our faults
[49:42] so sometimes there's things in you that
[49:46] only a tragedy can bring out
[49:55] tonight
[49:56] [Applause]
[50:00] amen because we've been looking at the
[50:02] tragedy as pain
[50:04] all right we've been looking at the
[50:07] tragedy as a disaster
[50:09] but could it be God shapening us into
[50:12] something
[50:13] could it be God bringing something our
[50:16] way that only a tragedy could unlock and
[50:19] open up
[50:21] [Applause]
[50:22] hooray Hallelujah church and as his
[50:26] brother prayed and painted now his wife
[50:28] is passing he's on his his bad mourning
[50:32] and and wondering Lord why didn't you
[50:35] let my wife pass
[50:37] with this promise of healing I have
[50:47] and I'm sure most of us approach it like
[50:49] that when things when people don't get
[50:52] healed and different things happen and
[50:54] we'll be like God your word says by your
[50:57] stripes
[50:58] they're supposed to be healed we're
[51:00] supposed to be healed so why did it
[51:02] happen
[51:04] and his brother he cried out to God he
[51:06] prayed and he prayed and God came back
[51:08] with the answer
[51:09] oh after his wife was gone
[51:12] and God began to speak to him and tell
[51:15] him my son I had to take your wife
[51:18] because me healing her wouldn't have the
[51:22] effect on your children that her passing
[51:25] would
[51:29] and as she passed and went on to Glory
[51:32] those kids began to remember her life
[51:35] those kids begin to remember that God
[51:38] that hurt their mother was a God-fearing
[51:41] mother and they they begin to remember
[51:44] her love they began to remember how she
[51:47] taught them in the scriptures and
[51:49] everything and then they began to get
[51:51] closer and closer and closer to God what
[51:54] brought them closer it was a tragedy
[51:59] yeah
[52:00] and sometimes God will use the tragedy
[52:03] Hood to unlock the next step in your
[52:07] life
[52:08] holy and it took the death of losing a
[52:12] wife that his own kids Hollywood get
[52:15] closer to God
[52:19] God is smarter than us
[52:22] he's wiser than us
[52:24] so you know the best thing for us to do
[52:26] is not question God
[52:29] hold it but check out attitudes
[52:32] and say Lord hallelujah give me a mind
[52:35] to say that no matter what happens it Is
[52:38] Well with My Soul
[52:41] and church as as I begin to look at the
[52:45] start
[52:46] you know I begin to think about
[52:49] the word of God
[52:51] you know how God
[52:53] allows things to happen
[52:56] no explanation
[53:00] you ever thought about that
[53:02] most of the times when we go through
[53:05] things there's no explanation
[53:11] and as you go through it God will begin
[53:13] to unfold himself yes amen because every
[53:18] child every test is for the purpose of
[53:21] God reveals
[53:22] Hallelujah and unveiling amen as a
[53:26] Believer because the Bible says the
[53:28] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[53:31] by God
[53:32] so what we have to look at is when we go
[53:34] through things or we fall into sin or
[53:36] whatever it is we can't say oh the devil
[53:39] made me do that
[53:40] so he did
[53:44] God alone
[53:46] because if I confess amen listen to me
[53:49] good if I confess it was the devil and
[53:52] the devil made me do it what I'm
[53:54] confessing is the devil has control over
[53:56] my life
[53:58] and I refuse to give him control
[54:01] [Applause]
[54:02] it looks like if I tell a lie I'm not
[54:05] gonna say the devil made me do it I say
[54:07] Lord I'm sorry
[54:10] oh
[54:12] I do something wrong I go to God and
[54:14] repent but I never say the devil made me
[54:17] do it because if the devil made me do it
[54:19] that means I
[54:21] act on a time I was his
[54:26] and I refused
[54:29] when God has given me a blood covering
[54:34] [Applause]
[54:36] the devil when God has come and revealed
[54:40] himself when God has come and touched my
[54:42] life I refuse to say the devil made me
[54:45] do no hit
[54:47] [Applause]
[54:50] the only Power he got is what you give
[54:52] him
[54:55] Hallelujah
[54:57] what we think about a tragedy
[55:00] and you know the scoffers in the world
[55:02] today
[55:03] that say if God was real
[55:05] why is all these things happen
[55:08] there's a purpose
[55:12] there's a purpose
[55:14] let's let's let's let's let's go into
[55:17] the word tragedy for a second
[55:20] the word tragedy is
[55:22] a dramatic composition
[55:25] often in verse dealing with a serious or
[55:29] somber thing
[55:30] typically that of a great person to
[55:34] staying through a flaw a character
[55:38] so sometimes Church
[55:40] the tragedy is so close to home people
[55:44] will look at the tragedy and they will
[55:47] make that a part of your character hmm
[55:52] but the tragedy and who you are are two
[55:55] different things
[55:58] but the tragedy
[56:00] into something greater
[56:02] you know when God and and when we look
[56:06] in the Bible and we look at we talk
[56:09] about the story of Job oh
[56:14] oh he lost his riches he lost his social
[56:16] status everybody on Facebook started to
[56:20] disclaim it
[56:21] everybody on Facebook's talking unlike
[56:25] him Hallelujah start to block him all
[56:28] these things he lost all his social
[56:30] status why because of the tragedy he was
[56:32] going through and look the tragedy was
[56:35] without proof of sin
[56:37] [Applause]
[56:39] so don't judge me about what I'm going
[56:41] through
[56:45] and these were his message believing
[56:48] friends
[56:50] judging him by the tragedy in his life
[56:53] whoa
[56:57] um
[56:58] oh before then he was a man of God
[57:01] but once he lost his social status
[57:04] you know
[57:05] once he started to lose friends on
[57:07] Instagram
[57:08] when nobody was when nobody would
[57:10] befriend him on Snapchat anymore
[57:14] and they began to block his Twitter and
[57:16] all these other different social events
[57:19] that they may have had
[57:21] in our day
[57:23] but I was gonna say it is they know in
[57:25] our day
[57:28] Hallelujah in our church
[57:30] look at it he lost his he lost he lost
[57:33] some of his wages
[57:35] the way to provide from his family no
[57:38] doubt was through his his substance his
[57:41] cattle and all his things but that began
[57:42] to die without explanation
[57:47] without explanation
[57:49] Hallelujah
[57:51] oh social status without explanations
[57:54] everything that job had that made him go
[57:57] Hallelujah it turned into a tragedy and
[58:01] everybody's looking at what he's going
[58:03] through and they're judging him by what
[58:05] he's going through oh church we could
[58:08] take a lesson from job
[58:10] yeah
[58:13] in church look
[58:15] when he's going through that
[58:18] look at it I want to show you something
[58:19] today that you could be going through
[58:22] something in your life and it's nothing
[58:25] simply more than just a bet between God
[58:28] and the devil
[58:35] well that's all it was
[58:38] it was a bet between God and the devil
[58:42] the devil says oh oh he's serving you
[58:45] because of this and that and all these
[58:46] things and God says you want to bet
[58:55] you won't fail and the BET what was the
[58:57] BET all about in the midst of his
[59:00] tragedy that he would curse God and God
[59:02] said no no he won't he's greater than
[59:06] what he's going through holy he's not
[59:09] identified by the time he's identified
[59:12] by the covering of the time
[59:14] Hallelujah job was not connected to his
[59:18] social status job was not connected to
[59:21] his children to his wife to his cattle
[59:23] to his money he was connected to that
[59:25] blood
[59:28] what are you connected to tonight
[59:32] what are you using to help you get
[59:34] through your trial
[59:38] because sometimes there may not be
[59:40] people to come around to help uplift you
[59:42] yeah
[59:52] let's look at the fall
[59:55] something that was so great
[59:58] in the beginning
[1:00:00] and look at where we are now
[1:00:03] when God created man man was what in the
[1:00:07] image of God
[1:00:08] just like him
[1:00:10] Adam was in every point every manner
[1:00:14] every England every job every ghetto
[1:00:18] just like God
[1:00:20] amen
[1:00:22] it is very image
[1:00:25] Adam couldn't be touched by the justice
[1:00:28] Lucifer the dragon whatever you want to
[1:00:31] call him he knew he couldn't come to
[1:00:33] Adam
[1:00:35] but in his mind he already had a plan he
[1:00:38] said you know what I'm going to produce
[1:00:40] a tragedy
[1:00:42] God feel some pain
[1:00:47] but what you think about something
[1:00:49] before you lay your life down to commit
[1:00:53] sin think about who's getting joy out of
[1:00:55] it first
[1:00:56] [Music]
[1:00:58] because Satan runs to God constantly
[1:01:00] accusing us and the day you decide to
[1:01:03] say hey I'm not living this way anymore
[1:01:05] Satan says oh
[1:01:07] oh
[1:01:09] yeah I think they're about to curse you
[1:01:10] God to your face but I don't know about
[1:01:12] you but in the casino or brother Dean's
[1:01:15] life
[1:01:15] every table in my casino is red
[1:01:21] Hallelujah
[1:01:23] every table is weak the devil will never
[1:01:27] win
[1:01:28] but he's playing Blackjack God always
[1:01:31] wins all right when he has the dice of
[1:01:34] my life rolling the dice they always
[1:01:37] fall on seven come on brother
[1:01:40] why because the dice in my life they're
[1:01:43] fixed they're waiting Hallelujah so
[1:01:46] always fall in my favor
[1:01:48] and I want you to believe the same thing
[1:01:51] the spiritual Casino in your life is six
[1:01:54] by God
[1:02:00] you can come over there with five
[1:02:01] dollars and still walk out with 500.
[1:02:05] why because it's fixed all right that's
[1:02:08] why we pay tithing Hallelujah because he
[1:02:10] said you do your bless if you don't you
[1:02:12] curse oh
[1:02:17] I can't believe
[1:02:19] brother Samuel in 2022 we have people
[1:02:23] still wrestling with paying taxes
[1:02:28] the Bible is clear
[1:02:31] if you do you're blessed if you don't
[1:02:33] you're going to live in a tragedy
[1:02:40] look Satan
[1:02:42] he gets kicked out of heaven
[1:02:44] and he comes down to earth and he says
[1:02:46] you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna
[1:02:47] mess up the whole thing
[1:02:49] I'm gonna make God pay
[1:02:52] that's his whole mindset he wants to
[1:02:55] give back to get back at God and the
[1:02:58] only way he know he can do it is messing
[1:03:00] with his wife
[1:03:02] like Samson said if you would have left
[1:03:04] my health alone I wouldn't be here
[1:03:07] messing with y'all
[1:03:11] and if you want to make God angry mess
[1:03:14] with his wife
[1:03:17] because she gave me touch
[1:03:20] honey she's Sanctified and put aside for
[1:03:23] God and His Hands alone so when Satan
[1:03:27] begins to mess with you he's messing
[1:03:29] with God's Pride prized possession I
[1:03:32] don't know about y'all heard but I'm
[1:03:35] wrapped up and I got a bow on me in
[1:03:37] God's eyes
[1:03:38] [Applause]
[1:03:42] Christmas gift imma give year round
[1:03:47] holy look Church
[1:03:50] let me read this
[1:03:52] now we we just take the fall you know
[1:03:54] God he said the prophet God said God
[1:03:57] would have been unjust
[1:03:58] to put elderly there create sin and and
[1:04:02] make them fall he said no he put them on
[1:04:05] free more ages
[1:04:07] where they would you would I would we
[1:04:10] would make our own decision
[1:04:15] listen he said let's go back to the
[1:04:18] beginning in the original physical
[1:04:20] creation as we know it today God made
[1:04:24] everything in pairs male and female
[1:04:26] there were two chickens roosting ahead
[1:04:29] there were two cattle cows and all right
[1:04:32] down the line but when it came to man
[1:04:35] there was only one who was it
[1:04:40] hmm
[1:04:42] created in God's image
[1:04:44] just like God talk like God Walk Like
[1:04:48] God Amen had the mannerisms of God Amen
[1:04:51] Adam knew he couldn't touch that
[1:04:55] right he could have made himself that
[1:04:57] way God did that and let me say this if
[1:05:01] you are anything in this spiritual life
[1:05:03] God did that
[1:05:08] that's right you know we got preachers
[1:05:11] and and different people in the world or
[1:05:14] uh in this world who think there's
[1:05:16] something because they know this message
[1:05:18] no God did that
[1:05:21] and wonderful God's election and calling
[1:05:23] you and showing you we would be in
[1:05:26] another denomination
[1:05:27] [Applause]
[1:05:32] it's Grace
[1:05:34] [Applause]
[1:05:37] that's why I'm not quick to move people
[1:05:40] right yeah or cast people down
[1:05:43] because everybody has to go through
[1:05:45] something
[1:05:47] he said every child of God must be
[1:05:49] tested
[1:05:51] hardly proven to be what that seed is
[1:05:54] inside
[1:05:55] and listen he says Adam has been made in
[1:05:58] the image of God he was the son of God
[1:06:00] and as a Son of God he could not be
[1:06:03] tempted and false
[1:06:06] boy I'm about to say something heavy now
[1:06:10] of God a daughter of God you cannot be
[1:06:14] tempted and false hold up
[1:06:17] all right amen
[1:06:19] oh I know some of you are reluctant to
[1:06:21] say Amen now
[1:06:23] because you feel like I fall every day
[1:06:25] but let's let's understand this this
[1:06:28] item was a spirit man
[1:06:30] we're not talking about the Flesh of
[1:06:32] Adam amen that's why that body was put
[1:06:35] in the flesh to be tempted amen so it's
[1:06:38] your flesh being tempted not your Adam
[1:06:42] yeah
[1:06:45] Hallelujah so sometimes we fall and we
[1:06:48] make mistakes that's not your seed being
[1:06:51] changed
[1:06:53] it's not your atom being changed it's
[1:06:57] your flesh tell you identifying
[1:06:59] Redemption
[1:07:04] that's why we go through these so we can
[1:07:07] appreciate Redemption
[1:07:13] it was not the atom that fell it was the
[1:07:17] Flash
[1:07:20] the sea remain the same
[1:07:25] that's why we don't have two Souls
[1:07:28] because God after Adam failed he never
[1:07:31] had to come and put that soul in another
[1:07:34] body
[1:07:36] all he had to do was put that body that
[1:07:39] atom in an atmosphere where he could
[1:07:41] recognize who he was again
[1:07:44] and he'd come back to himself he loses
[1:07:47] spiritual amnesia
[1:07:49] [Applause]
[1:07:52] Glory
[1:07:54] come on
[1:07:55] so what did God do
[1:07:57] because we are of that same Adam he had
[1:08:01] to put us in a body of death to
[1:08:03] experience tragedy
[1:08:11] listen
[1:08:13] as the Son of God he could not be tipped
[1:08:16] in the fall
[1:08:17] because remember the Bible says
[1:08:19] when you're tempted don't say you're
[1:08:20] being tempted of God
[1:08:23] Hallelujah
[1:08:25] the gene of God cannot be tempted
[1:08:30] yeah
[1:08:31] but these what are you saying the gene
[1:08:34] of God can't be changed
[1:08:36] and all temptation does hallelujah is to
[1:08:39] try to make it be something it's not
[1:08:42] hurry up and no matter who I was or what
[1:08:45] I was when I was in the club I still was
[1:08:47] the gene of God
[1:08:50] Hallelujah idea on the dance floor
[1:08:52] cleaner Shake It Up Hallelujah you know
[1:08:55] what I still had that Gene in me I still
[1:08:58] wasn't Adam
[1:09:01] if you was in the bar listening to your
[1:09:03] hokey talk and you had the seed of God
[1:09:05] that alcohol you were drinking couldn't
[1:09:08] change
[1:09:14] well I know some of y'all been saved all
[1:09:16] your life but for those of us who can
[1:09:18] recognize the tragedy of the sex coming
[1:09:21] alive
[1:09:22] there was a purpose in it
[1:09:25] God allowed us to experience tragedy in
[1:09:28] this flesh why so certain things in our
[1:09:31] spirit man could awaken
[1:09:36] floor
[1:09:43] listen
[1:09:45] oh my I love how the proper places
[1:09:47] he said as a Son of God he could not be
[1:09:50] tempted and fall
[1:09:52] that would be impossible
[1:09:58] uh what I want to do tonight I want to
[1:10:00] strip Satan from all this power
[1:10:03] because what we do is we look at what
[1:10:05] we're going through like oh my Lord God
[1:10:08] I'm so sorry I need to I need it your
[1:10:12] seed cannot be changed
[1:10:16] amen
[1:10:17] [Applause]
[1:10:18] what God is doing he's allowing you to
[1:10:23] experience the attributes of redemption
[1:10:29] through every test through every child
[1:10:32] it's an unfolding of God to you
[1:10:40] because he says to be tempted Hallelujah
[1:10:42] he said that would be impossible so God
[1:10:45] took a byproduct of man to cause the
[1:10:49] fall what was it Eve and where did Eve
[1:10:52] come from
[1:10:59] come from the what of Adam
[1:11:05] she didn't come from the spirit
[1:11:08] she came from that touch that rib honey
[1:11:12] that connection of Adam
[1:11:14] showing that she was not created in the
[1:11:18] very image of God but in the very image
[1:11:21] of me
[1:11:23] right
[1:11:27] therefore bring it for what
[1:11:34] so God allowed her to be created that
[1:11:36] way why so that we could experience
[1:11:39] death and child
[1:11:45] because Satan can come to Adam with why
[1:11:47] because he knew he would be the same one
[1:11:49] in heaven
[1:11:53] all right so he had to come to someone
[1:11:56] that would receive his words
[1:12:04] and we know the story of the fall and
[1:12:06] Satan says oh boy I got him
[1:12:10] oh he was once a God but look at him now
[1:12:14] doubt that look like a tragedy
[1:12:18] come on think about it Church he's
[1:12:20] walking out of the Garden of Eden with a
[1:12:23] remembrance of what it was like to tell
[1:12:26] creation to do what it did
[1:12:30] he's walking out Hallelujah with the
[1:12:33] remembrance of knowing what it's like to
[1:12:35] have fellowship with God daily and
[1:12:37] constantly
[1:12:41] Hallelujah in a stage of tragedy
[1:12:46] but look at it even that tragedy the
[1:12:49] fall had a purpose
[1:12:52] and Satan thought oh boy I got him I
[1:12:55] messed it up oh my I got my seated and
[1:12:58] God's standing there watching the whole
[1:13:00] thing and he's saying you dummy
[1:13:05] you dummy you are fulfilling my purpose
[1:13:09] and Satan after you your ignorance to
[1:13:13] usher in Redemption
[1:13:16] [Applause]
[1:13:24] amen Satan thought he was creating a
[1:13:27] tragedy but no he was Unlocking The
[1:13:30] Mystery of God's attributes
[1:13:34] oh yeah
[1:13:35] all right so every tragedy of the Fall
[1:13:38] was for a purpose what God had to allow
[1:13:41] somebody to be lost which was a tragedy
[1:13:43] to produce What A Savior
[1:13:47] which was what a purpose
[1:13:50] hey God did what he allowed Hallelujah
[1:13:53] us to be born in the body of death why
[1:13:55] so we could get sick which is what a
[1:13:58] tragedy to produce what a Healer
[1:14:02] Glory
[1:14:03] I hope you catch it in church
[1:14:07] oh
[1:14:08] God have purpose
[1:14:13] so what looked like a tragedy was really
[1:14:16] the plan of God
[1:14:20] just sitting there patient waiting
[1:14:24] and he's saying it is my
[1:14:26] okay say
[1:14:28] do what you do
[1:14:30] I need you to do what you do you're so
[1:14:32] smart
[1:14:33] go ahead finish it up
[1:14:35] go ahead and do your thing and God is
[1:14:37] saying
[1:14:39] we're almost there and as soon as even
[1:14:42] after I believe but took of the
[1:14:46] forbidden fruit
[1:14:48] parts of God begin to be unlocked
[1:14:51] don't know if we don't know that thing
[1:14:54] uh uh a picture of the Transformers
[1:14:58] those calls when they begin to change
[1:15:00] into something Hallelujah
[1:15:02] maybe they'd be in one position then
[1:15:05] they change it to another position but
[1:15:07] it's still the same thing
[1:15:10] Optimus Prime was a Freightliner all
[1:15:13] along
[1:15:15] but it took something to happen for him
[1:15:17] to stand up Mike
[1:15:23] and God will the Healer all along but it
[1:15:27] took a tragedy for that mystery of him
[1:15:30] to unlock and transform in our life
[1:15:34] God is the original chance
[1:15:40] all right
[1:15:45] [Applause]
[1:15:51] how old is gonna be I'm gonna I'm gonna
[1:15:55] do this and I'm gonna die I'm gonna mess
[1:15:56] up the whole world and God is sitting
[1:15:59] back saying no you're not gonna mess it
[1:16:01] up You're Gonna Save the whole world
[1:16:04] come on
[1:16:06] because when the whole world got lost
[1:16:09] that made God move into a savior
[1:16:12] all right
[1:16:13] holy when you and I it's by our bondage
[1:16:17] we recognize that he's a deliverer
[1:16:22] to those of us whoever smoke whoever
[1:16:25] drank and when God delivered us
[1:16:29] God delivered us
[1:16:31] [Applause]
[1:16:39] and took that tragedy for me to put that
[1:16:43] tar in my body to put all those things
[1:16:45] that smoking does all those elements
[1:16:48] that it does to experience that to
[1:16:51] realize what it means to be healthy
[1:16:56] what is it it's the grace of God
[1:17:00] Hallelujah
[1:17:03] and Satan wants to be sad because we're
[1:17:06] going through something no tonight we're
[1:17:08] gonna Rejoice
[1:17:09] we're going to rejoice in every time we
[1:17:13] don't rejoice in every tribulation why
[1:17:15] because there's a purpose in my life
[1:17:21] I have to experience the opposite of God
[1:17:24] to get the realness of God
[1:17:33] I'll keep proclaiming it he be fighting
[1:17:36] me in my finances earlier but my mindset
[1:17:38] has changed to Hallelujah in my life I'm
[1:17:42] still blessed
[1:17:45] Hallelujah
[1:17:46] because the Bible says hallelujah amen
[1:17:49] let the weak say I am what stroke
[1:17:53] how can the weeks and they're strong
[1:17:55] because weakness is only a perversion of
[1:17:58] what you really are
[1:18:03] what are you confessing
[1:18:06] oh my don't get nervous I'm about to
[1:18:08] close
[1:18:17] come on listen he says now
[1:18:18] he could not be just and make man fall
[1:18:21] see
[1:18:22] God's not going to make a servant
[1:18:25] he's going to let us make mistakes he's
[1:18:28] going to let us fall into certain things
[1:18:30] why what does that do that brings him
[1:18:33] closer
[1:18:37] can you imagine Hallelujah yourself not
[1:18:41] living with that man right there
[1:18:46] eternity
[1:18:48] [Applause]
[1:18:51] there's something about that connection
[1:18:53] Hallelujah but let me tell you something
[1:18:55] that connection was before the
[1:18:57] foundation of the world
[1:18:59] [Applause]
[1:19:07] there's a pastor inside there
[1:19:12] so what did he do he allows you to
[1:19:14] experience certain tragedies to get your
[1:19:17] hunger and for truth and that tragedy
[1:19:19] brought you where back here
[1:19:22] [Applause]
[1:19:32] so really
[1:19:34] God uses the tragedy
[1:19:36] to bring us back home
[1:19:46] Church
[1:19:48] but I like it
[1:19:50] she has three more agents we have the
[1:19:53] will and the right to decide
[1:19:55] and we'll even we'll even sometimes
[1:19:57] choose the wrong thing but let me say it
[1:20:00] like this God has to allow
[1:20:06] so when I made a mistake it wasn't just
[1:20:09] the devil having control of me no it was
[1:20:12] God allowing it
[1:20:15] Hollywood because of the son and
[1:20:18] daughter of God nothing can happen in
[1:20:20] your life except first it comes to God
[1:20:24] let's go back to Joe
[1:20:26] Hallelujah
[1:20:27] Satan came to church that day
[1:20:31] the Bible say the sons of God went to
[1:20:34] worship and the Bible says and Satan
[1:20:36] came also
[1:20:38] believe it or not the devil loves to
[1:20:40] come to church
[1:20:44] because he knows if I can get somebody
[1:20:46] to use I can hold up the anointing
[1:20:50] if I can get somebody to use I can cause
[1:20:53] a friction between the preacher and the
[1:20:55] people
[1:20:57] let me say this demo you got the wrong
[1:21:00] one today
[1:21:02] [Applause]
[1:21:11] your resistance doesn't back me up your
[1:21:15] resistance wants me to see you even more
[1:21:17] Freya
[1:21:20] Glory
[1:21:22] I will accept the challenge
[1:21:24] to get out of the way and let God use me
[1:21:36] now
[1:21:38] you can't and we know these things he
[1:21:39] can't be a savior unless something is
[1:21:42] lost oh it's a tragic
[1:21:45] anybody ever been lost
[1:21:47] okay well let's let's put it like this
[1:21:50] go back to what you was before you came
[1:21:52] into truth
[1:21:54] that's what it means to be
[1:21:59] done you guys are over a league I ain't
[1:22:01] never did this I ain't never did that I
[1:22:03] I've been a pretty good person nice
[1:22:12] if you if nobody never told you let me
[1:22:15] tell you now you are born indeed
[1:22:19] came into the world speaking live
[1:22:23] so therefore all of us need what a
[1:22:27] rebirth
[1:22:30] whether you feel like you never did
[1:22:31] anything or not
[1:22:33] you're born in a body of death
[1:22:37] oh my
[1:22:39] god listen
[1:22:40] he says now you can't be your savior
[1:22:41] unless something is lost you can't be a
[1:22:43] Healer unless something is sick these
[1:22:45] things had to be that way God made them
[1:22:48] thus so that he his great attributes
[1:22:52] could be displayed
[1:22:55] man
[1:22:56] let's understand what it means to be
[1:22:58] displayed
[1:23:02] do me a favor
[1:23:04] put um
[1:23:06] put um um Psalms 37. verse 23 up there
[1:23:12] on the street
[1:23:14] he can
[1:23:19] is that the footsteps of the righteous
[1:23:21] are ordered by God
[1:23:25] what makes them righteous
[1:23:28] is that even in his failures
[1:23:31] he gets back up
[1:23:34] that's what makes him righteous
[1:23:39] I have been young and I'm old yet have I
[1:23:44] not seen the righteous forsaken
[1:23:47] even in my falling I have a promise that
[1:23:51] I'm not forsaken
[1:23:52] now remember he said that his attributes
[1:23:55] may be displayed you see that scripture
[1:23:58] that's what it means to be displayed
[1:24:02] right there in front of all of us that
[1:24:05] there's no confusion
[1:24:07] right there where all of us can see it
[1:24:10] and it's interpreted holy word forward
[1:24:14] and that's what God is doing with his
[1:24:16] attributes he's put them on display but
[1:24:19] there's no confusion
[1:24:31] listen
[1:24:33] yeah
[1:24:35] one thing I want you to realize
[1:24:38] seeing
[1:24:39] funny
[1:24:40] is a product of the Fall
[1:24:43] amen
[1:24:46] but we're gonna snatch all the power
[1:24:49] sin
[1:24:51] is not a creation
[1:24:58] so when you look at sin I'm about to say
[1:25:01] something now
[1:25:02] look at sin it doesn't even have a
[1:25:05] resting place
[1:25:08] because it doesn't have its own origin
[1:25:14] because it's not a creation it's a
[1:25:17] perversion
[1:25:18] Hallelujah
[1:25:20] this is the problem said there's never
[1:25:22] was such a thing as creation of sin
[1:25:27] that didn't go down good did it
[1:25:31] because we look at all of our failures
[1:25:34] and all the things we come up short no
[1:25:37] that's not a creation that's a
[1:25:39] perversion
[1:25:42] Hallelujah he said it's not a creation
[1:25:45] no sir sin is a perversion there's only
[1:25:49] one Creator that's God sin is
[1:25:52] righteousness perverted listen to that
[1:25:54] sin is righteousness
[1:25:58] so except you believe in perversion sin
[1:26:02] doesn't even live
[1:26:08] if you take the perversion out of it
[1:26:10] hallelujah it's not even real
[1:26:17] what is the LIE
[1:26:19] the truth
[1:26:21] where did the law come from the
[1:26:23] perversion of the truth
[1:26:26] so if you take the perversion out of it
[1:26:28] the LIE doesn't even exist
[1:26:35] catch me now
[1:26:37] I'm by the club I want you to catch me
[1:26:39] now hold it what is sickness a
[1:26:42] perversion of you
[1:26:44] but if you can get your thoughts to
[1:26:46] believe that you will heal sickness
[1:26:48] won't even exist
[1:26:52] why because it's a perversion of Truth
[1:26:55] if you learn to live in the element of
[1:26:57] Truth
[1:26:59] Darkness won't even exist
[1:27:07] Ence
[1:27:08] I got to say like the Pentecostal
[1:27:09] preacher y'all don't hear me
[1:27:13] I said y'all don't hear me I say yo
[1:27:18] don't hear me sin I said sin is a
[1:27:23] perversion
[1:27:27] foreign
[1:27:31] Hallelujah if you're living in the right
[1:27:33] place with God it doesn't even exist
[1:27:36] [Applause]
[1:27:43] s
[1:27:45] because it has no creation
[1:27:49] therefore he can never come back out of
[1:27:52] something
[1:27:56] and if it came had come back out of
[1:27:58] something that mean it doesn't have any
[1:28:01] origin
[1:28:03] without any originality
[1:28:07] it's just a lie
[1:28:12] [Applause]
[1:28:18] what is a Lie the truth misrepresented
[1:28:21] certainly what causes what curse word is
[1:28:25] God's blessings turned into curse words
[1:28:27] instead of a blessing sin is not a
[1:28:30] creation sin is a perversion so Satan
[1:28:32] could not create sin he only perverted
[1:28:35] what God created
[1:28:37] you know what the prophet said Satan
[1:28:40] can't even create his own tools whoa
[1:28:45] Hallelujah Glory his tools come from God
[1:28:48] hallelujah received as a lie
[1:28:51] [Applause]
[1:28:59] you asked me why I'm happy and here's
[1:29:03] the reason why because
[1:29:06] my sins are gone
[1:29:11] [Applause]
[1:29:15] where is those sins hallelujah our sins
[1:29:18] are gone in the element of Truth and
[1:29:21] when we can live in truth we can live
[1:29:24] victoriously
[1:29:25] Glory
[1:29:27] Hallelujah
[1:29:31] look
[1:29:33] so

[1:29:41] cancer
[1:29:42] isn't real
[1:29:46] like but these I I you say but these I
[1:29:48] know somebody who got it that's because
[1:29:50] they received a lie

[1:29:57] hilly
[1:30:00] and Castle can't create itself
[1:30:02] hallelujah it's a perversion of true
[1:30:05] sales

[1:33:37] on the two prior times that I didn't
[1:33:40] have diabetes
[1:33:41] after they said I did so you think this
[1:33:43] time is going to be different
[1:33:45] hmm

[1:33:49] said Mr Diggs you got diabetes I look

[1:34:25] said no no I don't
[1:34:26] say well well whatever
[1:34:28] this and that
[1:34:30] so doc comes in
[1:34:32] and he starts to go over this and go
[1:34:34] over all these things he said why do you
[1:34:35] why do you need your your duty physical
[1:34:37] I said because I want it
[1:34:40] he said because our job wasn't no
[1:34:41] because it's mine and I want it yeah
[1:34:44] Hallelujah
[1:34:47] so he says well your levels are kind of
[1:34:51] high
[1:34:52] and you know it looks like you got
[1:34:55] you know diabetes I say nope
[1:34:58] what you see
[1:35:01] is a protein drink
[1:35:04] what you see Hollywood is a pre-workout
[1:35:11] and he says to me no he don't go through
[1:35:13] your body that fast and this and that
[1:35:15] and blah blah blah say look man before I
[1:35:17] came here I went to the gym I had a
[1:35:19] pre-workout of protein shake and that's
[1:35:21] what you see
[1:35:22] that's what's in my body now for those
[1:35:25] of you who know me what was it last time
[1:35:28] thank you
[1:35:31] if it was sweet tea last time something
[1:35:34] I put in my body so this time it got to
[1:35:36] be the same thing something I put in my
[1:35:39] body yeah
[1:35:40] don't let the devil lie to you
[1:35:44] don't let him pervert your status right
[1:35:48] so he says now he says no he can't do
[1:35:50] this he can't dad so in my mind I'm
[1:35:52] thinking he's in my mind I'm thinking
[1:35:55] now he's a doctor with the school always
[1:35:57] a young guy man and I'm not trying to
[1:35:59] take away from that but he's saying you
[1:36:01] know you got this you got that and you
[1:36:03] know it don't come out your body and all
[1:36:04] these things I'm thinking
[1:36:05] when you drink something where does it
[1:36:08] come out at
[1:36:14] it's fluid
[1:36:17] and fluid comes out of the way fluid
[1:36:19] comes out
[1:36:24] thus
[1:36:26] pre-workout
[1:36:31] he's like no that's not that all these
[1:36:34] things or whatever blah blah blah
[1:36:36] so I'm like no he said we got to take a
[1:36:38] blood test
[1:36:39] oh
[1:36:41] man when you start saying you're gonna
[1:36:42] test me by the blood I started to shout
[1:36:48] and that's what you ought to do every
[1:36:50] time they say they need we need a blood
[1:36:51] sample come on come on Hallelujah we
[1:36:53] need to take a blood sample blood test a
[1:36:55] blood pressure whatever if you realize
[1:36:57] what the blood has done for you that
[1:37:00] means you're covered
[1:37:01] I ain't worried about no tests I ain't
[1:37:03] worried about no examination Hallelujah
[1:37:06] because when God sees my blood all he
[1:37:08] sees is his blood
[1:37:13] but it's according to your testimony and
[1:37:16] what you believe so I'm standing there
[1:37:19] like praise God
[1:37:22] hurry up test me prick me good
[1:37:29] because I'm confident that that blood
[1:37:31] still has power
[1:37:32] [Music]
[1:37:35] confident that he's still atoning in the
[1:37:38] midst of what they would call a tragedy
[1:37:42] very hot
[1:37:44] so he takes the test and all these
[1:37:46] things and he said look I'm not trying
[1:37:48] to be difficult I'm not trying to be
[1:37:50] difficult but I just want to make sure
[1:37:51] everything is good as everything is good
[1:37:54] so that was on a Wednesday
[1:37:56] that Thursday had to fly and go to
[1:37:58] Canada he said well call back Saturday
[1:38:00] your test should be back in and you'll
[1:38:01] find out everything
[1:38:03] so I went about my business
[1:38:05] you know what I'm thinking
[1:38:07] you know that this is just the enemy
[1:38:10] trying to walk you down you know he's
[1:38:12] trying to give you a little time to
[1:38:13] think about it what are you thinking
[1:38:15] about
[1:38:15] either he is or he isn't
[1:38:19] and as far as I'm concerned God is
[1:38:22] that's what the Bible says Harley you
[1:38:24] must first realize that he is
[1:38:27] Hallelujah so church I go to Canada and
[1:38:30] I come back Hallelujah the next the
[1:38:32] Monday and they're calling me they know
[1:38:34] they call me why are they call me Friday
[1:38:36] instead of Saturday they call me Friday
[1:38:38] but I'm like
[1:38:42] it's a deal with y'all when I get back
[1:38:44] so I got back they still called me still
[1:38:46] called me I said oh I say I'm coming I'm
[1:38:48] coming down there I'm coming you know
[1:38:50] they won't discuss stuff on the phone so
[1:38:51] I'm coming
[1:38:52] so I get down there
[1:38:55] and the doctors in there he said hey Mr
[1:38:57] D how you doing I said I'm doing good he
[1:38:59] said well
[1:39:03] yes came back normal
[1:39:07] like I told you that
[1:39:11] I told you it was pre-workout
[1:39:14] he said oh yeah he said well you know I
[1:39:16] just wanted to make sure I do what I'm
[1:39:18] supposed to do now this is the Clint
[1:39:19] Charlie don't never be afraid to stand
[1:39:21] your ground
[1:39:22] because there's a purpose in that
[1:39:24] tragedy there's a purpose in that test
[1:39:27] so in me standing my ground Hallelujah
[1:39:29] for those who drive trucks you know that
[1:39:31] Duty physical only lasts two years
[1:39:33] holding that's no two years if you're
[1:39:35] gonna drive you have to go get another
[1:39:36] physical because they want to make sure
[1:39:37] you're healthy while you're driving so
[1:39:39] this man already wrote my physicals did
[1:39:41] everything got everything I passed this
[1:39:43] wrote my um wrote my uh uh card out
[1:39:47] and when I look
[1:39:49] well it was supposed to be uh from
[1:39:51] February or this month for of this year
[1:39:54] 2022 to February of 2024.
[1:39:58] I don't know
[1:40:00] but mine said
[1:40:02] from February 2022
[1:40:05] to February
[1:40:07] 32.
[1:40:14] you know what I mean
[1:40:16] I never got to be tested again
[1:40:19] the Rapture being took place before I
[1:40:22] got to go back and take another test
[1:40:26] will he do it
[1:40:29] ah mom so bear with a child bear with
[1:40:34] the death God has something for you on
[1:40:37] the end of it
[1:40:38] don't be dismayed Hallelujah
[1:40:41] in my closing Hallelujah cause I know
[1:40:43] it's getting late
[1:40:45] in my closing Church
[1:40:46] the reason why I read the book of Ruth
[1:40:49] look at the tragedy
[1:40:52] elimelech died
[1:40:55] child un die
[1:40:57] Milan died
[1:40:58] and now you got three women left all by
[1:41:01] themselves
[1:41:03] but you know what look at that tragedy
[1:41:06] it took that tragedy in Ruth's life to
[1:41:10] lead her to a boy as Hallelujah
[1:41:13] it took losing a husband to get the
[1:41:15] right hook
[1:41:19] Hallelujah it take Naomi Hallelujah to
[1:41:23] losing the limit like Hallelujah to
[1:41:25] being fully Redeemed by Paul half
[1:41:29] so sometimes it takes a longer to
[1:41:33] receive a blessing
[1:41:36] and that's how God works turn it looked
[1:41:39] like such a tragedy but it was that
[1:41:41] tragedy Hallelujah that pulled her in
[1:41:43] the fields it was that charity
[1:41:45] Hallelujah to put boys eyes on her it
[1:41:48] was that charity all the way up they
[1:41:50] gave her a typing barley season
[1:41:54] it was the type
[1:41:57] it was the tragedy Hallelujah
[1:42:00] and it's by that tragedy earlier to see
[1:42:04] that six Ballers a week wasn't good
[1:42:06] enough
[1:42:07] oh
[1:42:08] six seals are not good enough hallelujah
[1:42:13] amen God put her right in a place where
[1:42:16] she could be identified with seven
[1:42:18] Marley
[1:42:24] her life will change forever
[1:42:26] what started it
[1:42:31] I can go on and on
[1:42:33] about things in the Bible that would
[1:42:35] happen that look like a tragedy
[1:42:36] and God worked it out for his purpose
[1:42:40] y'all know Joseph's whole life was a
[1:42:42] tragedy
[1:42:43] his whole teenage years was a tragedy
[1:42:46] at the age of 15 Hallelujah his brothers
[1:42:49] was jealous
[1:42:50] so jealous they hated him sold them into
[1:42:52] slavery oh what a tragedy
[1:42:55] then he goes earlier but the part of his
[1:42:57] house she lies on him throws him in jail
[1:42:59] with a tragedy he gets in jail
[1:43:02] Hallelujah they forget about him oh what
[1:43:04] a tragedy all of that was leading up to
[1:43:07] what holy Pharaoh's dream all right yeah
[1:43:12] he took all that stuff that happened in
[1:43:15] his life just to get him to that place
[1:43:17] Hallelujah to be in Pharaoh's jail
[1:43:21] come on
[1:43:23] let me tell you power something
[1:43:26] what we do we be like Lord
[1:43:28] father God
[1:43:29] save my son
[1:43:31] whatever you got to do save them next
[1:43:33] thing you know you get a phone call here
[1:43:35] in jail
[1:43:38] and you're crazy behind Gathering up
[1:43:40] bail money
[1:43:42] when you didn't pray Lord do whatever
[1:43:43] you got to do to save him but you got
[1:43:46] enough air money for leave them in there
[1:43:48] remember your prayer
[1:43:51] that might be the thing Hallelujah
[1:43:54] that breaks it
[1:43:59] oh I know we got this sensitive believe
[1:44:01] that everybody thinks little about God's
[1:44:04] love
[1:44:07] who gonna love it he rebuking what Chase
[1:44:12] Lord save my son please whatever you got
[1:44:15] to do and they think
[1:44:18] leave them right in there and keep
[1:44:21] praying
[1:44:24] you say oh Lord whatever you got to do
[1:44:26] save my daughter she gets involved with
[1:44:28] a young man who beats her and breaks her
[1:44:30] heart and you want to get your gun and
[1:44:32] go after no you said whatever you Lord
[1:44:34] whatever you got to do save her
[1:44:38] stand there keep praying
[1:44:41] sometimes we go fight Hallelujah jump in
[1:44:44] the way and then God can't do nothing
[1:44:47] come on musicians I'm closer
[1:44:49] let me stop because I go down a whole
[1:44:50] other path with that one
[1:44:57] God has a way
[1:45:00] and a lot of times it's through tragedy
[1:45:03] but tragedy
[1:45:05] it works for our Goods
[1:45:08] and what you have to be careful of
[1:45:11] don't be like Joe's friends
[1:45:14] judging him by what he's going through
[1:45:17] right and there's some people who go
[1:45:19] through things in front of the whole
[1:45:21] world
[1:45:22] and then as some people go through
[1:45:24] things behind closed doors
[1:45:26] it doesn't mean that person going
[1:45:28] through things before everyone else did
[1:45:31] something wrong
[1:45:34] it may just mean that God is pulling a
[1:45:36] little bit more out of that person
[1:45:39] so that person needs your prayers too
[1:45:41] honey
[1:45:42] don't be like Joe's friends without
[1:45:45] cause
[1:45:46] they can accuse him right they never
[1:45:49] found anything wrong at all right all
[1:45:52] they kept saying is something got to be
[1:45:54] wrong Joe
[1:45:55] for you to be going through this
[1:45:58] right yeah
[1:46:00] what's going wrong is it was a bet
[1:46:07] and God knew job
[1:46:11] that's right
[1:46:13] keep in mind I want you to realize this
[1:46:15] Hallelujah your life has already been
[1:46:18] pre-planned by God
[1:46:20] so whatever trial whatever ups and downs

[1:54:13] God has made that clear over and over
[1:54:15] and even right here coming around
[1:54:17] tonight it was not remember even one
[1:54:21] blade of grass in job's yard couldn't be
[1:54:23] touched unless God permitted it
[1:54:26] not even one blade could be touched
[1:54:30] so Satan has no power over what you or I
[1:54:34] go through
[1:54:36] God permits but has God has made so

[1:54:41] kept on preaching tonight
[1:54:49] we recognize how Satan wants to put you
[1:54:52] know everything when people can take a
[1:54:53] story and put a spin on it
[1:54:55] they can put a spin on it and make it
[1:54:57] come out in a certain way there ain't no
[1:54:58] spin on this this is the pure gospel
[1:55:03] it's the standard of the word of God and
[1:55:06] we can stand right there and look back
[1:55:08] at the Devil and say Boo
[1:55:13] because tragedy brings purpose

[1:55:32] truth in that element of truth then we
[1:55:35] live Victorious
[1:55:38] and Truth is a person
