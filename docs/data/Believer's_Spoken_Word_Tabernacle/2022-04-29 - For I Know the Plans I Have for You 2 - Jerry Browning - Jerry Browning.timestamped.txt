[33:58] amen
[34:01] i'd like to read from jeremiah chapter
[34:03] 29 verse 11 through 11-13
[34:07] i want to speak again on the subject
[34:09] before i know the plans i have
[34:28] for i know the thoughts that i think
[34:30] toward you saith the lord
[34:32] thoughts of peace and not of evil
[34:36] to give you an expected end
[34:39] then shall you call upon me
[34:41] and ye shall go and pray unto me and i
[34:44] will hearken unto you
[34:46] and you shall seek me and find me
[34:48] when you say search for me with all your
[34:50] heart
[34:52] maybe see
[34:54] as i had
[34:57] read to you on
[34:59] sunday
[35:00] in the new and international
[35:02] translation it says for i know the plans
[35:05] i have for you plans to prosper you
[35:08] not harm your plans to give you hope in
[35:11] the future
[35:14] god has plans for each and every one of
[35:16] us god has his plan
[35:18] and it's not
[35:20] our plan that shapes god's plan
[35:24] god has a complete plan that he had
[35:26] before the world was ever formed
[35:30] and
[35:31] it was a great grand plan
[35:35] far beyond
[35:37] what our perspective can can quite grasp
[35:42] he knew the beginning from the end
[35:46] when he started he knew how he was going
[35:48] to finish it
[35:50] and because he was god there was nothing
[35:53] that could prevent him from doing what
[35:56] he had set out to do
[36:00] satan tried to
[36:02] uh
[36:03] offset his plans or upset them
[36:06] when he came down to the garden and
[36:08] tempted eve
[36:10] and uh
[36:11] you know thereby man
[36:13] fell
[36:15] but
[36:16] even that unbelief
[36:18] did not stop god's plan
[36:22] everything works according to god's plan
[36:26] even when satan thinks he's thrown a
[36:28] wrench into something it's still part of
[36:30] god's plan
[36:35] and there's nothing can interrupt
[36:38] it god had a plan for moses
[36:42] to
[36:43] to be the deliverer the man in other
[36:46] words that he would use
[36:49] the instrument that he would use to
[36:51] deliver
[36:52] the children of israel
[36:56] moses tried to interject his plan into
[36:59] it
[37:01] and he ended up with one dead egyptian
[37:04] and the people still bound
[37:06] and the people had no confidence in him
[37:10] but that didn't stop god's plan
[37:13] god didn't have to say hope i got to
[37:15] scratch this plan now i've got to go
[37:17] back to square one i've got to start all
[37:19] over again no it didn't affect god's
[37:22] plan it worked in god's plan
[37:26] because it took moses out of egypt away
[37:30] from all of his training away from all
[37:33] of the unbelievers of the of the
[37:36] egyptians it took him away from the
[37:38] criticism of the p of his own people and
[37:42] got him out alone to where god could
[37:45] come down and just speak and it'd be god
[37:47] and moses speaking to one another
[37:51] so it was it still worked at god's plan
[37:59] when god says something that settles
[38:02] it it's going to happen
[38:05] no matter how
[38:07] ridiculous it may look to man and
[38:10] brother branham said god makes it look
[38:12] ridiculous to man
[38:15] and it always looks ridiculous to the
[38:18] unbeliever
[38:23] someone's saying i'm going to church to
[38:26] be prayed for i i've been diagnosed with
[38:28] cancer i'm going to church to be prayed
[38:30] for to be healed to an unbeliever that
[38:32] would sound ridiculous
[38:37] but to a believer it makes perfect sense
[38:42] because that is god's plan
[38:46] that fits in god's plan god's i am
[38:49] jehovah raphae
[38:51] the lord thy god that healeth all thy
[38:54] diseases
[38:55] it's god's plan to heal people
[38:59] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[39:02] and forever
[39:05] he's healed people in the past he's
[39:07] still healing people
[39:10] he hasn't changed
[39:14] and no amount of devils can stop him
[39:17] from from bringing healing
[39:20] to those that need it and will believe
[39:30] faith is only real to god and the
[39:33] believer
[39:35] you try to talk about faith to an
[39:37] unbeliever
[39:39] to a person of the
[39:40] world they don't know what you're
[39:42] talking about faith
[39:46] do you mean like mind over matter
[39:49] no
[39:52] faith is real faith is a substance
[39:58] faith is something you can hold on to
[40:02] and it's not a hope
[40:04] and it's not a last hope
[40:11] god's promises will be fulfilled no
[40:13] matter what the devil tries to do or
[40:15] what how much unbelief is around you
[40:27] all the
[40:28] unbelief they could muster
[40:31] wouldn't stop the sun from coming up
[40:36] all the unbelief that a
[40:38] a person could muster wouldn't stop the
[40:40] stars from shining
[40:43] so how could it stop god
[40:48] it doesn't matter what anyone around you
[40:50] says
[40:51] your faith claims and holds on to the
[40:55] word of god because it's in the plan of
[40:57] god to heal you
[41:06] he'll heal every sick person that'll
[41:08] take his word after
[41:12] now
[41:14] i no doubt you have
[41:16] read in the message about
[41:19] a brother by the name of brother way
[41:23] and i had the opportunity to meet him
[41:26] years ago when i was a young boy him and
[41:29] his wife
[41:30] and heard their testimony firsthand
[41:34] and he was in a service brother branham
[41:37] was preaching
[41:39] and he just fell over dead right in the
[41:41] service
[41:43] laid out in the floor dead his wife was
[41:45] a nurse
[41:46] she went down by him right away said
[41:49] he's gone
[41:53] and god raised him up from the dead
[41:55] right there in that service
[41:58] and here's what brother branham had to
[42:00] say about it he said brother way
[42:03] your god's purpose for your life isn't
[42:06] over yet
[42:09] that's why you're still here with us
[42:11] tonight
[42:12] he had passed in the morning service he
[42:15] was attending the night service
[42:19] he said that's why you're still here
[42:20] with us tonight because god's purpose
[42:23] for you isn't complete yet
[42:26] and he says i'm going to pray that god
[42:28] shows you the plan
[42:30] that he has for your want your life and
[42:34] your wife's life
[42:36] so that you can get into god's plan and
[42:39] do what god has for you to do
[42:45] so death couldn't take him
[42:49] because god
[42:50] still had a purpose there was still a
[42:52] plan that involved him and his wife
[42:59] turn me to romans chapter 8
[43:02] verse 28
[43:10] pardon me while you turn
[43:27] and we know that all things work
[43:29] together for good to them that love god
[43:33] to them who are called according to his
[43:36] purpose
[43:38] before i go on reading let me read you
[43:40] this
[43:42] brother branham said this was concerning
[43:44] brother way again
[43:46] he said
[43:51] i think it was no more than a
[43:53] confirmation of what i had been
[43:55] preaching about and had been witnessing
[43:58] of the kingdom of god
[44:01] and it's something along that line
[44:05] so
[44:06] here god wasn't finished with brother
[44:08] way yet
[44:09] but he but he let death temporarily take
[44:12] him
[44:13] so that he could raise him back from the
[44:15] dead
[44:16] in the service
[44:18] so that he could confirm what brother
[44:20] branham was preaching
[44:23] so you see
[44:25] god's plan is beyond just something very
[44:28] simplistic
[44:30] god works all things they they're
[44:33] working like
[44:34] a clogs to together
[44:38] all things work together
[44:42] for the good of them that love the lord
[44:45] so everything that has ever went on in
[44:47] your life god has allowed and it has
[44:50] been to bring you to the place to where
[44:53] god could use you to bring you to where
[44:56] you are now
[44:59] and it doesn't matter what your age is
[45:00] how young you are or how old you are
[45:04] god's plan was to bring you to this
[45:07] point in time you were ordained to be in
[45:10] this last age in this last time
[45:14] with the end time message
[45:17] at the time when god is calling the very
[45:21] last election
[45:26] and you've got a part to play
[45:31] you might think well
[45:33] i'm not a preacher how could i be
[45:34] playing a part in it you don't have to
[45:36] be a preacher
[45:38] do you know what you have to be
[45:40] what god's made you
[45:43] that's all you got to
[45:44] do be what god's made you
[45:48] and brother branham said
[45:50] be the best at it
[45:56] all things work together for the good of
[45:58] them that love god to them who are
[46:00] called according to his purpose
[46:03] for whom he did for know
[46:05] he also did predestinate
[46:08] uh
[46:09] i don't understand people that have
[46:11] trouble with predestination because the
[46:12] words in the bible
[46:18] so it isn't like
[46:20] a word that somebody snagged out of the
[46:22] air somewhere and
[46:24] and said well it'll fit with this and
[46:26] this and this uh ideology of the
[46:29] scripture no it's in the bible
[46:34] for whom he did for know he also did
[46:36] predestinate
[46:37] to be conformed to the image of his son
[46:40] you see his plan
[46:42] you'll know god's
[46:44] another insight to god's plan read the
[46:47] mystery christ the mystery read the
[46:49] message christ the mystery of god reveal
[46:52] he has a threefold purpose brother
[46:54] branham said
[46:59] to be conformed to the image of his son
[47:01] that he might be the firstborn among
[47:03] many brethren
[47:04] who are the many brethren us
[47:10] well he's the firstborn
[47:12] well then
[47:13] i've been reborn too
[47:21] moreover
[47:22] whom he did predestinate them he also
[47:25] called
[47:26] god didn't leave he doesn't leave
[47:28] anything up to chance
[47:31] he had a plan for you and he called you
[47:34] to this end time message to fulfill
[47:38] his plan
[47:46] and whom he called them he also
[47:48] justified in whom he justified them he
[47:51] also glorified
[47:53] what shall we then say to these things
[47:56] if god before us who can be against us
[48:00] it doesn't matter who's against you
[48:04] it can't stop god
[48:09] he that spared not his own son but
[48:11] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[48:14] not with him also freely give us all
[48:16] things
[48:17] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[48:20] god's elect
[48:22] it is god that justifieth
[48:30] who is he that condemneth
[48:32] it is christ that died ye rather that is
[48:35] risen again who is even at the right
[48:36] hand of god who also maketh intercession
[48:39] for us
[48:41] who shall separate us from the love of
[48:43] christ shall tribulation or distress or
[48:46] persecutions or famine or nakedness or
[48:48] pearl or sword
[48:49] that is written for thy sake we are
[48:51] killed all the day long we are accounted
[48:53] as sheep for the slaughter nay in all
[48:56] these things we are more than conquerors
[48:58] through him that loved us
[49:01] for i am persuaded that neither death
[49:03] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[49:06] nor powers nor things present nor things
[49:08] to come nor a height nor debt nor any
[49:11] other creature shall be able to separate
[49:13] us from the love
[49:15] of god which is in christ jesus our lord
[49:21] you realize that god even has a that
[49:24] even the unbelievers fit in his plan
[49:31] even the unbelievers have a purpose to
[49:34] serve in this life
[49:38] even the make-believers have a purpose
[49:40] to serve in this life
[49:48] they may be the ones that are going to
[49:49] despise the believer
[49:52] speak evil of the believer
[49:54] pass their name out as evil
[49:57] persecute them
[50:02] pharaoh the bible said god raised him up
[50:06] for his purpose
[50:10] and the bible says that god hardened
[50:12] pharaoh's heart each time that moses
[50:15] came to him
[50:17] that was all in god's plan
[50:20] to fulfill his purpose and to fulfill
[50:23] his
[50:24] plan and his plan was i am going to
[50:28] bring egypt to its niece
[50:33] i i promised i would do this with a
[50:36] mighty hand i'm not going up there and
[50:39] asking his permission i'm going to force
[50:42] him
[50:44] i'm going to do it with the mighty hand
[50:50] well in order for god to have to do with
[50:52] the mighty hand
[50:53] pharaoh's heart had to be hardened and
[50:55] he had to resist
[50:59] he had to be an unbeliever
[51:04] now god didn't create him to be an
[51:06] unbeliever
[51:07] pharaoh came into this world
[51:10] because of the fall
[51:13] he was serving seed
[51:16] but even god can use serpent seed to
[51:19] serve his plan
[51:22] everyone on the face this earth fits
[51:25] into god's plan somehow
[51:33] and he purposes the plan in himself
[51:38] he doesn't ask my permission
[51:41] or or my
[51:43] advice you think ought to do this
[51:48] jerry and he doesn't have to tell you
[51:52] everything that he's doing
[51:56] even about your own life
[52:01] he allows you he allowed job to go
[52:04] through trials that was all part of
[52:05] god's plan
[52:08] because god wanted to reveal something
[52:10] to job
[52:12] so job had to get into a place to where
[52:15] he would be opened up to god to where
[52:17] god could reveal to him the resurrection
[52:26] so god lets you go through things so
[52:28] that he can more reveal himself to you
[52:35] i will boldly say the lord is my helper
[52:40] he reveals to us that he's our helper
[52:44] he reveals to us that he how could he
[52:46] reveal to you that he was your healer if
[52:49] you never had need of healing
[53:01] he said he'd make everything work
[53:02] together for the good of them of the
[53:04] lord
[53:09] so there's nothing that goes on
[53:12] even
[53:15] you may make a you may be going
[53:17] somewhere and make a wrong turn
[53:22] and you think
[53:24] oh i've really messed up
[53:26] i've got to get turned around and get
[53:28] back where i need to go
[53:30] and if you were in a hurry you're like
[53:32] oh
[53:33] why would you do something like this you
[53:35] you talk to yourself i'm sure
[53:40] they say it's okay as long as you don't
[53:42] answer yourself
[53:50] but
[53:51] i i believe i'd give you the testimony
[53:53] of
[53:54] when my mom had last come down to visit
[53:58] us and i took her to the airport
[54:00] and on the way back we just kept getting
[54:02] into
[54:04] more and more traffic
[54:06] and i started taking alternate routes
[54:08] routes to try to get around it
[54:10] to try to get back home quicker
[54:14] and uh end up getting on getting off of
[54:17] one route onto another that was backed
[54:20] up so i turned around and went back on
[54:21] to the original route got back on there
[54:24] got on down got stopped down there and
[54:26] and found out that just before i got
[54:28] there there had been a a major accident
[54:31] up there
[54:34] i thought i made a wrong choice
[54:37] but god didn't want me at that place
[54:39] when that accident was going to happen
[54:43] he's got your hand on he's got his hand
[54:46] on you
[54:50] when you don't even know that it's
[54:52] necessary
[55:04] sometimes
[55:06] god has you do things that after you get
[55:09] it done you think oh man that was a
[55:11] waste of time
[55:18] i'll give you for example
[55:22] i went to college
[55:25] and i studied
[55:28] and what i studied
[55:31] i don't even use
[55:35] what i went there for
[55:38] but i learned how to make good notes
[55:47] i learned how to write
[55:49] resumes and you would be shocked at the
[55:51] amount of resumes that i have wrote
[55:54] for my church members
[56:04] i thought boy i've wasted i've wasted
[56:06] some time here
[56:11] but i went and got what god wanted me to
[56:13] get
[56:14] i just didn't know what it was
[56:24] there was a woman
[56:27] she was
[56:29] a wash woman
[56:31] washed clothes for a living
[56:34] and
[56:36] she had a burden on her heart
[56:40] for the community
[56:44] she couldn't get away from the bird
[56:47] but she was just
[56:48] just
[56:49] a person who did laundry
[56:52] she had a burden for for god
[56:55] and for the work of god
[56:58] so she went with her savings and rented
[57:01] a stable
[57:05] and invited a preacher to come
[57:09] and a preacher came
[57:11] and began to preach and poured his heart
[57:14] out
[57:16] to the community and all that would come
[57:17] out
[57:22] and the only response he got
[57:24] was a little old boy with hair hanging
[57:26] down his back wearing his daddy
[57:28] suspenders he came up to the altar and
[57:31] gave his life to the lord out of all
[57:33] those people out of all that community
[57:36] one young man came up and gave his life
[57:39] to the lord and that young man's name
[57:41] was the white l moody
[57:43] and he won millions of souls to the lord
[57:48] and that wash woman that was just a
[57:51] washed woman that just did laundry it
[57:54] was her purpose in life to get the white
[57:58] elmoody to salvation
[58:06] so be what god has made you and be the
[58:10] best at it
[58:14] god
[58:15] made her a washed woman
[58:23] so that she
[58:24] would save up money
[58:26] to rent a stable
[58:28] to get one young man saved
[58:33] and do you know all the millions of
[58:35] souls that got saved under the white
[58:37] dome moody's ministry
[58:39] she will get credit for it
[58:48] be what you are and be a good one
[58:54] brother adam said fulfill your purpose
[58:56] so others can see you
[58:58] if you're a housewife be a real one
[59:01] if you're a husband be a genuine one
[59:04] if you're a deacon be genuine
[59:07] if you're a preacher be genuine whatever
[59:09] you are
[59:13] but don't try to take somebody else's
[59:15] place
[59:19] and he mentions about usia
[59:22] and how uzi got lifted up
[59:27] and he took the censor
[59:29] and he went to try to do the priest's
[59:32] job
[59:35] god had to bring correction to him
[59:39] brother branham says when god brings
[59:40] correction to you and the word calls you
[59:43] down and you feel rebuked then just
[59:45] repent
[59:47] that's all it is the only thing to do
[1:00:00] lincoln
[1:00:02] president abraham lincoln
[1:00:06] he had no education
[1:00:11] but he
[1:00:12] he
[1:00:12] had a drive
[1:00:17] to to be president
[1:00:22] and he didn't let his education stop him
[1:00:30] i became one of the greatest presidents
[1:00:32] we've ever had
[1:00:34] he was a god-fearing man
[1:00:39] he had something in his heart was it was
[1:00:42] god had a purpose for him to serve
[1:00:49] and you think well if god had a purpose
[1:00:50] for him to serve be president
[1:00:52] why didn't god make him a real educated
[1:00:54] man
[1:00:57] why why didn't god make him be born
[1:01:01] into a family of politicians
[1:01:08] because none of that stuff
[1:01:10] has anything to do
[1:01:12] with god's plans and purpose
[1:01:17] god's plan for abraham lincoln's life
[1:01:19] and god wanted to show there's nothing
[1:01:21] going to stop it
[1:01:26] you think the devil voted for abraham
[1:01:29] lincoln
[1:01:32] no
[1:01:34] he did not
[1:01:38] and the devil was against him his entire
[1:01:41] presidency
[1:01:45] so much so
[1:01:47] that once his purpose had been served
[1:01:50] the devil sent an agent to take his life
[1:02:04] so i think every christian ought to be
[1:02:07] that way find your purpose and go do it
[1:02:12] have a purpose in life something you're
[1:02:13] going to do god has placed you here
[1:02:16] do something about it
[1:02:19] if there's a revival there it's there
[1:02:21] for a purpose
[1:02:23] let's get something out of it
[1:02:27] let's do something about it
[1:02:36] and you've got to be willing
[1:02:38] to pay you the price whatever it
[1:02:46] is you know
[1:02:49] we read the story of samson
[1:02:52] see what kind of a man samson was and
[1:02:56] as you read about his life you might
[1:02:58] wonder why did god even mess with him
[1:03:02] he looked like such a messed up person
[1:03:07] he had problem with women
[1:03:10] why would god even bother with him
[1:03:13] but god had a purpose for him
[1:03:19] and even when satan took
[1:03:22] and cut off his hair and put out his
[1:03:24] eyes
[1:03:25] it still wasn't going to stop god from
[1:03:27] serving
[1:03:29] his purpose through samson's life
[1:03:33] but you realize samson
[1:03:36] had to be willing to give his life
[1:03:39] so that god's final purpose could be
[1:03:42] served
[1:03:45] and samson said
[1:03:47] let me die
[1:03:50] with the philistines
[1:03:56] and he was willing to do whatever it
[1:03:58] took he was willing to die out
[1:04:01] you know
[1:04:03] there is something in every human that
[1:04:05] wants to preserve their life
[1:04:07] but he was willing to die out to that
[1:04:12] in order to fill just one more time
[1:04:15] the power of god
[1:04:18] brother branham said are you willing to
[1:04:21] pay the price to feel god's power one
[1:04:23] more time
[1:04:30] i said on
[1:04:31] sunday you've got to let loose
[1:04:34] and let god have his way
[1:04:37] and get yourself out of the way
[1:04:42] there was um
[1:04:45] two individual man and his wife that
[1:04:48] came to be prayed for one of brother
[1:04:50] rem's meetings
[1:04:52] they were old
[1:04:54] they were well stricken in age
[1:04:57] and they were having
[1:04:58] problems that come with age
[1:05:04] brother branham said now this morning
[1:05:06] your old and gray and stoop shoulder
[1:05:09] having a lot of aches and pains and
[1:05:11] things you're not used you didn't used
[1:05:12] to have
[1:05:15] but remember you're still serving the
[1:05:17] same god that brought you on the earth
[1:05:20] then it must be all in god's purpose to
[1:05:23] let you get this way
[1:05:26] but remember in the resurrection you'll
[1:05:29] not have a gray hair nor wrinkle
[1:05:31] everything that death has did to you
[1:05:34] will be forgotten in the resurrection
[1:05:39] god when he got the picture painted
[1:05:42] they said there they are now come on deb
[1:05:45] but you can't take them until i let you
[1:05:48] do it
[1:05:50] and when you go into the dust and raise
[1:05:53] up again you'll come back the same
[1:05:54] lovely couple that you was at the altar
[1:05:57] that morning when you got married and
[1:05:59] remained that way forever
[1:06:02] so what have we got to be scared about
[1:06:06] so they come up to be prayed for because
[1:06:09] they were experiencing things from their
[1:06:11] age
[1:06:14] and brother ma'am said god let you get
[1:06:16] this old for a purpose
[1:06:23] i'm going to tell you something age
[1:06:25] doesn't mean anything to god
[1:06:32] moses didn't really get started until he
[1:06:34] was 80.
[1:06:42] well god i'm too old now my my
[1:06:45] life's gone
[1:06:47] doesn't matter this is the time i've
[1:06:49] chose
[1:06:55] brother ramsey said took
[1:06:57] egypt 40 years to teach moses and god 40
[1:07:00] years to get it out of him
[1:07:12] satan could not drown noah in the flood
[1:07:16] until the purpose of god had been
[1:07:18] finished
[1:07:20] he couldn't burn up the hebrew children
[1:07:23] until the purpose of god had been
[1:07:25] finished
[1:07:31] you know
[1:07:32] the bible doesn't tell you shadrach
[1:07:34] meshach and abednego it doesn't tell you
[1:07:36] much about what they did
[1:07:40] it didn't tell you much really about
[1:07:41] their life
[1:07:43] but what it tells you about is the
[1:07:45] purpose of their life
[1:07:49] and the purpose of their life
[1:07:51] was to show a king
[1:07:53] that there was a god
[1:07:56] and that not even fire could harm his
[1:07:59] children
[1:08:01] that the very thing that satan sent
[1:08:03] along to destroy him all it did was was
[1:08:06] loose their bonds
[1:08:10] it burnt the ropes off of them the
[1:08:12] bindings off of them without sending one
[1:08:14] hair
[1:08:15] on their body
[1:08:20] you think about this uh
[1:08:23] think about the times you've grilled out
[1:08:25] perhaps
[1:08:26] especially on a charcoal grill
[1:08:29] with real fire
[1:08:32] and you know you get the thing heated up
[1:08:34] and you're trying to turn
[1:08:36] you know your food and and and
[1:08:39] you know the closer you get to the heat
[1:08:41] while your hands you get to where you
[1:08:43] can't hardly stand the heat cinches the
[1:08:45] hair off your hands
[1:08:50] especially when you're trying to put
[1:08:53] the food on the grill
[1:08:56] sometimes it's easier to place it on
[1:08:57] with your hands than it is trying to use
[1:08:59] the utensil
[1:09:00] especially slippery old chicken
[1:09:05] and before you can get it all on there
[1:09:06] you're like well it got too hot for my
[1:09:08] hands
[1:09:09] and that's just a charcoal grill
[1:09:14] but they heated this furnace up many
[1:09:17] times over
[1:09:18] they had it so hot that the the men that
[1:09:21] went down there to throw them in
[1:09:23] died they perished from the heat
[1:09:30] but it never touched one hair on the
[1:09:32] head of me shaq shadrach and bendigo
[1:09:39] god's purpose
[1:09:40] was so the king would look down there
[1:09:43] and see i i see four men down there
[1:09:47] unbound unbound walking around and
[1:09:49] unhurt
[1:09:51] and he said the fourth man is like the
[1:09:54] son of god
[1:09:55] [Music]
[1:10:00] their purpose in life
[1:10:03] was to reveal the fourth man
[1:10:08] [Applause]
[1:10:14] and that's what god focused on in their
[1:10:16] life
[1:10:25] he couldn't kill job with boils or
[1:10:28] troubles
[1:10:29] until the purpose of god had been
[1:10:31] finished
[1:10:32] the lions couldn't eat daniel
[1:10:36] death and old age couldn't take abraham
[1:10:41] until the purpose of god had been
[1:10:43] finished
[1:10:45] death old age couldn't stop sarah from
[1:10:48] bringing from having the chosen son
[1:10:57] what's age mean to god
[1:11:01] god said
[1:11:03] i'll just reverse it
[1:11:06] i'm god i can do what i want to
[1:11:14] god can do what he wants to in your life
[1:11:27] what was my purpose
[1:11:30] i was thinking today when i was
[1:11:32] studying on this service
[1:11:37] and i thought
[1:11:39] my mom brought two pastors into this
[1:11:41] world
[1:11:44] my dad trained two pastors
[1:11:54] that was besides them actually living
[1:11:56] their life as an example
[1:12:05] you know
[1:12:06] you know
[1:12:07] don't you don't have to worry about
[1:12:09] well what what is god's purpose for my
[1:12:11] life
[1:12:13] because god is going to manifest
[1:12:17] you will you are in god's plan you'll
[1:12:20] fall right into place
[1:12:28] do as the lord lead you
[1:12:33] hallelujah
[1:12:40] and i just said that that's besides all
[1:12:42] the grandchildren that have been
[1:12:44] produced
[1:12:47] and the talents that god has given them
[1:12:49] and the talents that god has worked out
[1:12:51] through their life
[1:12:57] and how they edify the body of the lord
[1:13:06] it all come about because of a couple
[1:13:08] got together
[1:13:10] and both dedicated their lives to the
[1:13:12] service of god
[1:13:16] and it brought all that about
[1:13:22] and this is the thing see
[1:13:24] god knew all that all the time
[1:13:31] my mom didn't know my dad didn't know
[1:13:35] mom was too busy trying to stuff a foot
[1:13:37] long hot dog down inside her little
[1:13:39] purse
[1:13:41] because she couldn't eat it all on the
[1:13:42] first date
[1:13:48] but god had a plan the whole time and he
[1:13:50] knew what it was and knew what he was
[1:13:52] going to produce out of it
[1:13:57] brother branham says it this way he says
[1:14:00] god
[1:14:00] got this one with that one and that one
[1:14:02] with this one and this one with that one
[1:14:04] and then produced
[1:14:06] offspring until he get the right king in
[1:14:09] the bell
[1:14:18] the wonder we can say
[1:14:20] is the word says the weapons of our
[1:14:22] warfare are not carnal
[1:14:27] but mighty
[1:14:29] to the pulling down a strong hope
[1:14:40] satan's you know satan has been present
[1:14:43] throughout your life to try to disturb
[1:14:45] god's plan for your life
[1:14:53] he tried the attractions of the world
[1:14:55] with some of you
[1:14:58] he tried to take your life
[1:15:00] perhaps
[1:15:02] from one way or another
[1:15:10] god said uh-uh
[1:15:13] i got a plan
[1:15:16] and this individual fits in my plan
[1:15:20] in a certain place at a certain time
[1:15:25] and that's today
[1:15:31] and tomorrow
[1:15:34] and the next day
[1:15:38] until the purpose that you have
[1:15:41] in serving god's entire plan
[1:15:44] has has been served
[1:15:52] then god says
[1:15:53] now i'm going to reward you
[1:15:58] i'm going to take you out of this life
[1:16:00] and take you to a place beyond your
[1:16:02] imagination
[1:16:07] brother branham said i used to fear
[1:16:08] death
[1:16:11] he said but something happened to me
[1:16:16] he said i used to fear dying because i
[1:16:19] thought would i just be a
[1:16:21] like a floating spirit
[1:16:25] he said but something happened to me the
[1:16:27] other day
[1:16:29] and he said i'll never be the same
[1:16:35] he said and if you could understand what
[1:16:37] death is you'd never fear it
[1:16:44] because it's
[1:16:46] eternity
[1:16:49] there's no yesterdays
[1:16:51] there's no tomorrows
[1:16:54] everything's all just present tense
[1:17:04] and god
[1:17:05] rewards
[1:17:07] his faithful soldiers
[1:17:11] by taking them home
[1:17:17] your work's done
[1:17:19] now come on up a little higher
[1:17:25] receive a little bit of the reward that
[1:17:28] you got coming to you
[1:17:38] last year
[1:17:40] labor day
[1:17:44] i
[1:17:45] i in my church i'm sure you were
[1:17:47] all praying for brother roell
[1:17:50] storyanna
[1:17:54] then
[1:17:58] sister soriano
[1:18:00] messaged me
[1:18:03] and said brother roell has been promoted
[1:18:15] now my way of thinking i looked at
[1:18:17] everything that god was doing through
[1:18:19] brother rowell and all the work that he
[1:18:21] did
[1:18:22] all the labor he put in and all the work
[1:18:24] that still yet needed to be done
[1:18:28] so i kept saying
[1:18:30] ah it ain't god's time to take him yet
[1:18:33] he's still got a lot of work to do
[1:18:36] but that was my thing
[1:18:38] but see in with god he had fulfilled the
[1:18:42] purpose god had sent him for
[1:18:45] say
[1:18:46] but and there's still work to be done
[1:18:48] yes and there's more people
[1:18:50] that god has to fulfill that work
[1:19:00] god has
[1:19:02] been
[1:19:05] and you might think well nobody could
[1:19:07] ever feel brother oil's shoes
[1:19:10] that ain't god's purpose anyway
[1:19:21] but there's other people
[1:19:23] other brothers
[1:19:26] that fit in god's plan
[1:19:29] that god has a purpose
[1:19:31] that they're going to fulfill
[1:19:33] and they're going to play their part now
[1:19:44] and you know
[1:19:45] as god's plan works
[1:19:51] it also brings identification
[1:19:58] causes people to show their colors
[1:20:09] the report i got was
[1:20:12] that all
[1:20:14] the ministers
[1:20:15] and
[1:20:16] brethren who never relied on brother
[1:20:19] roell
[1:20:21] for financial support
[1:20:24] but relied on him
[1:20:26] for spiritual support
[1:20:29] are still
[1:20:30] supporting the work
[1:20:43] my brother and i the the brother that's
[1:20:45] pastor right now brother boy
[1:20:48] my brother and i
[1:20:50] got to meet him he uh last time we were
[1:20:53] over in the philippines he
[1:20:55] he took me around
[1:20:56] while my brother was going and preaching
[1:20:58] in
[1:20:59] certain locations he was taking me to
[1:21:00] another location to preach on one sunday
[1:21:02] morning and we met up later that evening
[1:21:11] you know covet hasn't took one life
[1:21:14] that
[1:21:15] god
[1:21:16] hadn't intended
[1:21:18] to take
[1:21:30] even covet
[1:21:31] has to bow to god's plan
[1:21:42] anyone
[1:21:44] that comes again when someone comes
[1:21:46] against you friends that's going to work
[1:21:49] in god's plan
[1:21:50] for your life
[1:21:59] you think
[1:22:01] about the
[1:22:02] the
[1:22:03] guide used to take brother branham
[1:22:05] around hunting
[1:22:10] and brother branham said
[1:22:12] he had a cruel heart
[1:22:18] you remember the story he
[1:22:20] used that little
[1:22:23] call of a fawn
[1:22:25] to draw their mother out
[1:22:28] brother ram said i couldn't watch i
[1:22:30] turned my head
[1:22:32] i knew he was just gonna blow her heart
[1:22:34] clean through her
[1:22:37] all of a sudden the rifle
[1:22:40] went down to the ground
[1:22:43] he said lead me to this god
[1:22:47] that you talk about
[1:22:49] because he saw something real
[1:22:52] so even that mother deer that stepped
[1:22:55] out there but hearing that fun cry had a
[1:22:59] purpose to serve
[1:23:01] and her purpose to serve was to show
[1:23:04] that god was real
[1:23:06] showing it through nature
[1:23:14] the possum
[1:23:17] the cave and brother brahman said
[1:23:19] she waited patiently for her turn
[1:23:25] brother branham passed her by
[1:23:32] but a little ugly old possum
[1:23:37] had a purpose
[1:23:39] to serve in god's plan
[1:23:44] that a prophet would pray for
[1:23:47] and she would be healed
[1:23:49] and gather up her babies
[1:23:52] and go on her way
[1:23:55] all things work together for the good of
[1:23:58] them to love the lord
[1:24:08] god
[1:24:09] uses animals
[1:24:11] god cares about animals
[1:24:18] hallelujah
[1:24:22] brother branham wanted to be a cowboy
[1:24:27] but that wasn't god's plan for his life
[1:24:32] he wanted to be a wilderness man
[1:24:35] but that wasn't god's plan for his life
[1:24:40] god's plan for his life was to be the
[1:24:42] prophet
[1:24:43] to the end time age
[1:24:46] and to bring the word
[1:24:49] that has called us
[1:24:51] into god's plan
[1:25:07] i wanted to be a soldier
[1:25:11] but that wasn't god's final plan
[1:25:15] i said you're not going to be a soldier
[1:25:17] for this country you're going to be a
[1:25:18] soldier for me
[1:25:23] but you know god even took all that
[1:25:27] and none of it was wasted
[1:25:35] god used things to mold you
[1:25:38] into the person
[1:25:40] that you are today
[1:25:46] and god didn't place you here
[1:25:49] to express your political views
[1:25:54] because everybody has got them in the
[1:25:55] all state
[1:26:08] god
[1:26:10] sent you here
[1:26:12] to be a christian
[1:26:14] to be a servant for him
[1:26:28] oh my
[1:26:32] god's plan
[1:26:34] for i know the plans i have for you
[1:26:38] god's not trying to figure it out
[1:26:43] it's already said
[1:26:48] i've seen people
[1:26:50] searching
[1:26:53] for what they felt maybe god would call
[1:26:56] them to do and they were doing it all
[1:26:57] along
[1:27:01] what were they looking for
[1:27:10] you know what more important could god
[1:27:12] call you to be
[1:27:14] than a member of the bride of jesus
[1:27:16] christ
[1:27:20] to
[1:27:21] let your life
[1:27:23] be a light
[1:27:25] to the world
[1:27:29] ye are
[1:27:30] the light of the world
[1:27:35] hallelujah
[1:27:36] god's purpose god's plan
[1:27:41] and you know no matter how many times
[1:27:43] satan tried to derail
[1:27:45] god's plan
[1:27:47] for brother branham's life
[1:27:49] god was always there
[1:27:55] it's a matter of you
[1:27:57] won't you take a
[1:27:58] drink oh he's the only that the
[1:28:01] branham family has produced
[1:28:05] give me that bottle
[1:28:16] couldn't do it
[1:28:23] every time satan tried to derail it
[1:28:27] you see satan saw
[1:28:30] the the birth
[1:28:33] satan saw the sign
[1:28:40] he didn't know god's complete purpose
[1:28:42] but he knew god had something special
[1:28:44] for this individual
[1:28:47] just like he knew
[1:28:49] god's got a child that's going to be
[1:28:51] born in egypt and he's got a special
[1:28:53] purpose for him in this life
[1:28:55] i don't know who it is
[1:28:58] so i'm just going to kill them all
[1:29:02] all the baby boys
[1:29:06] and you know all those baby boys those
[1:29:09] hebrew boys
[1:29:11] that died
[1:29:15] their purpose in life was to hide moses
[1:29:28] so that satan couldn't find moses
[1:29:35] in the time when jesus was to be born
[1:29:40] and they came to herod
[1:29:42] and they said
[1:29:43] where is he
[1:29:45] born king of the jews
[1:29:50] herod's jealousy
[1:29:57] caused him to order
[1:30:00] the baby boys to be killed
[1:30:03] and everyone
[1:30:05] that died
[1:30:07] died
[1:30:08] to hide
[1:30:10] jesus
[1:30:17] that's
[1:30:18] hard something to grasp
[1:30:24] but god even had a plan for them
[1:30:29] and do you realize the moment they died
[1:30:33] they became about 20 years old
[1:30:38] in perfect bodies
[1:30:42] and they were welcomed home
[1:30:47] here's your reward
[1:30:55] ah
[1:30:56] makes it look ridiculous to man
[1:31:04] but god has a purpose for everyone
[1:31:15] there was a
[1:31:20] little baby girl
[1:31:24] that i went to pray for in the hospital
[1:31:26] one time
[1:31:27] he was six weeks old
[1:31:30] she'd been abused
[1:31:34] been
[1:31:35] had bones that had broke and re-healed
[1:31:40] her head was swollen
[1:31:42] from the abuse
[1:31:46] she had wires hooked up all over just
[1:31:48] six weeks old
[1:31:54] i went in and
[1:31:56] there was a nurse tending to her
[1:31:59] and i said i don't want to get away she
[1:32:00] said no pastor it's fine come on up be
[1:32:03] beside me
[1:32:06] so i i said
[1:32:10] can you tell me anything about the
[1:32:11] condition of this baby
[1:32:14] he said if she lives she'll never be
[1:32:17] right
[1:32:19] she'll
[1:32:20] she'll be an emblem
[1:32:28] there was
[1:32:29] the mother
[1:32:32] the man she was living with
[1:32:33] were being questioned
[1:32:38] about what had went on
[1:32:41] how this had happened to this child
[1:32:45] and they found she had been sedated with
[1:32:48] drugs
[1:32:49] it was still in her system
[1:32:56] i prayed and i said lord
[1:32:59] just take this little baby on home
[1:33:02] don't let her suffer no more in this
[1:33:04] life
[1:33:08] and i left
[1:33:11] and she passed
[1:33:14] i was asked to do the funeral
[1:33:18] and i just kept thinking
[1:33:20] now brother branham said
[1:33:23] that death couldn't take you into the
[1:33:25] purpose for your life had been served
[1:33:29] i just kept thinking what purpose
[1:33:33] if this little baby's life had served
[1:33:40] her mother
[1:33:43] she
[1:33:44] knew about this end time method
[1:33:48] she had been raised
[1:33:50] by a mother who was a believer
[1:33:58] she had professed to be a believer at
[1:34:00] one time herself
[1:34:04] the drugs that were in the baby
[1:34:06] were drugs that had been prescribed to
[1:34:08] the mother
[1:34:15] and the police when they went while the
[1:34:18] parent the the
[1:34:20] mother and this man was being questioned
[1:34:22] they went
[1:34:23] in their investigation and went into
[1:34:25] their apartment
[1:34:26] and found
[1:34:28] where the medication had been crushed
[1:34:30] and cut up with the razor blade to get
[1:34:33] it and fed in the bottle
[1:34:41] i said what purpose could she deserve
[1:34:48] the lord said
[1:34:50] she gave opportunity
[1:34:52] for them to do the right thing
[1:34:56] but they chose to do the wrong thing
[1:35:01] and it says
[1:35:03] it would be better
[1:35:05] that a millstone
[1:35:07] was tied around your neck
[1:35:09] and you cast into the scene
[1:35:12] than to offend one of these little ones
[1:35:18] woe be the he that bringeth the offend
[1:35:23] but
[1:35:24] jesus goes on to say but yet the offense
[1:35:27] must
[1:35:28] come
[1:35:40] hard to grasp some of these things
[1:35:46] but it just lets you know
[1:35:50] a little insight
[1:35:51] to the complexity
[1:35:53] of god's mind
[1:35:59] my thoughts
[1:36:00] are not your thoughts
[1:36:04] he knows
[1:36:13] and i may have touched on a cord
[1:36:16] somewhere
[1:36:20] maybe you've lost a
[1:36:22] child loved one
[1:36:26] you may not know
[1:36:28] why
[1:36:30] or what purpose
[1:36:32] their life served
[1:36:34] but god had a purpose
[1:36:37] and they weren't taken until that
[1:36:39] purpose was served
[1:36:45] and for serving god's purpose
[1:36:47] they were rewarded
[1:36:58] the venom said all
[1:37:00] babies
[1:37:01] die
[1:37:02] go to heaven
[1:37:07] brother adam said sometimes he'll take
[1:37:09] one
[1:37:12] to prevent it
[1:37:15] from facing things going down the road
[1:37:20] be raised right wouldn't have the right
[1:37:22] here or something
[1:37:25] god knows
[1:37:35] perhaps the purpose was
[1:37:37] to get your attention
[1:37:48] god's got a plan for you
[1:37:53] amen
[1:37:55] be what god has made you
[1:37:57] as the prophet said and be a good one
[1:38:05] god's called you to be
[1:38:08] a factory worker be a good one
[1:38:12] why
[1:38:14] last seed may be working by you
[1:38:22] you may be the one
[1:38:24] that crosses path
[1:38:26] with this child of god
[1:38:28] that needs to be called
[1:38:32] and the god in your life
[1:38:35] will call them
[1:38:37] because they
[1:38:38] have been predestinated
[1:38:42] highly listening
[1:38:50] heavenly father lord we
[1:38:52] bow our heads before you tonight
[1:38:57] lord i
[1:38:59] think about the times lord in my life
[1:39:02] where
[1:39:04] satan tried to take me away or take my
[1:39:06] life
[1:39:10] lord he couldn't lay a hand on me
[1:39:14] because you had a purpose
[1:39:19] lord
[1:39:21] the things that i've
[1:39:23] went through lord
[1:39:25] with my health
[1:39:28] the times that satan would come to try
[1:39:31] to bring fear
[1:39:34] lord you had a purpose
[1:39:40] you allow us
[1:39:42] sickness to come our way
[1:39:45] so that you may reveal healing through
