in a personal way that we be further changed lord we love you and thank you father jesus precious amen you love him let's go to the book of daniel if you would go to jan daniel chapter 6. it's good to be in the house of the lord daniel chapter 6 and i want to just we'll read a few verses of scripture then we'll let you have your seats daniel verse 1 6 and verse 1. it pleased darius to set over the kingdom 120 princes which should be over the whole kingdom and over these three presidents of whom daniel was first that the princes might give accounts unto them and the king should have no damage then this daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes because an excellent spirit was in him and the king thought to set him over the whole realm then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against daniel concerning the kingdom that they could find no occasion nor fault for as much as he was faithful neither was there any error or fault found in him in verse 5 then said these men we shall not find any occasion against this daniel except we find it against him concerning the law of his god then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king and said thus unto him king darius live forever and the presidents of the kingdom the governors the princes and the councillors and the captains have consulted together to establish a royal statute and to make a firm decree that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days save of the o king he shall be cast into the den of lions now o king establish the decree and sign the writing that it be not changed according to the law of the and persians which altereth not wherefore king darius signed the writing and the decree now when daniel knew that the writing was signed i want you just to hone in on this verse here now when daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and his windows being open in his chamber toward jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his god as he did a four time it didn't matter what changed in the kingdom daniel won't change it it didn't matter what was going on daniel said god's word doesn't change i'm a part of that word i'm not changing so i'd like to speak to you tonight on just one simple word unaltered unaltered may god bless the reading of the word as you're being conceived just some weeks ago months ago i remember exactly when actually it's probably been just about a month just in devotions one morning just struck me certainly didn't know that i'd be preaching on it at this time but it struck me when i came across this last part of the scripture there in verse 10 of how that when there was a writing that was made how that daniel he made an approach and when daniel went about everything he never he never stopped he never altered anything about his walk with god not his life never altered one bit anyway look at that word unaltered that's a it's a very challenging word because it's nothing that we could ever really tack onto humanity because with humanity we we change even as we grow older we change you know you can as much as you want to dig your heels in and you know i'm gonna do this and i'm not gonna lose my hair i'm not gonna we we change there's there's parts about it that shows in our humanity itself that it's it's it's a fading away there's a dying that takes place we we find ourselves with not the strength maybe that we had even in previous years and i know some of you are looking at me and saying you're 46 years old right now but you you understand that when some of those times of certain things that you know we we just find that the dying and that that altering apart of certain things that we've even had to alter were certain things that maybe you could do in the past instead now you call somebody else to do it what's happened there's a changing that's taking place but to to your life as a believer there's one thing that doesn't change and that is the word of god that is your experience because your experience with the holy ghost that can't be altered that cannot be changed that's solid that's rock solid that's that's the part of the new birth that can never be altered in our life no matter what comes or what goes it is steadfast in our life remember when jesus when he was expressing in that time and you know you remember when he was asking who do men say that i am and they said some say you know you're this you're that you know you're this one what it was was all parts of christ that they were seeing and they were identifying he is identified with jeremiah with isaiah but in reality he was all of them put together it was god who had been revealing himself down through time and remember what he spoke to peter in that time he said that upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not be able to prevail against it and how many times we hear brother branham will take it in the simplicity and he says see it shows that the gates of hell would be against it it would it would actually the teachings and everything else would a challenge the word of god so the challenge that satan wants to try to present to you and i is a challenge against the word of god because in our lives we face things that people who don't even believe in god they face the same things there's people who lose their jobs that don't believe in god and there's people who lose their job who do believe in god but there comes there comes to the sort separates to that of a believer is that the test that comes to our life is whether that we are going to stay with the word you know it's easy when there's no pressure that comes on around us of where whether we're going to stand with the word and let me just say this satan knows he knows our weaknesses brother bran tells us in a short message at the end of 62 the message the contest satan studies to find to see where is that word out in our life where is the word is it in our flesh is it only in our spirit or is it down there in our soul because where is it that we're because when it comes down to that of the soul then it comes to a place that of as to the believer we realize our life we're not living by bread alone we're living by every word of god and it's not just what we realize it's what we must have in our life as a believer when tests are trials or things come about in our life not just when they come but even when they come in the times of opposition we know that our strength comes from the lord and there's no way that i can face this or face adversity i need the strength and the help of almighty god it's not just about when things are going good but it's when the test and the trial comes that's when it really displays a real believer and the real goods on the inside so we're talking about in the midst of it what a paradox that in the midst of a life god does a work the god who changes not whose word cannot be altered and that god comes and does a work in our life by the new birth that's unalterable and yet that life that is on the outside of that is a life that we spirits altering we experience change in our life just like changes in season and changes we go through certain tastes you have now colors of paint or colors of this all of those things changes but there's one thing about it in our life that doesn't change and it can't change because it's not a work of man it's a work of almighty god it's unaltered and i want to say it like this the holy ghost is unaltered in this hour no matter what man has tried to do tried to water it down bring it down to a handshake or just to name it and claim it it's unaltered it's undisputed he's the same almighty god he does the same things you know what this is this right here you say well that's that's the book of life and the lamb section within it but it's also a prophecy concerning that the same god that moved before back here in adversities is the same god that moves in our life as well it's a book of prophecy that we can expect and know him to be the same he's never diminished in power doesn't matter what's changed through the ages he is the unaltered one who is in our midst the word of god is unaltered the heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away as you know the gentleman said and brother branham will refer to it he said as the black brother said i would rather be standing he said upon the word of god then upon he said heaven or earth he said because they will pass away but there's one thing that can't pass away and that's the word of god what you and i are seeing all around us right now is a vesture that's upon the earth and just like a vesture whether it's my coat or your shirt eventually it gets holes in it it serves its purpose and it's gone there is a vesture upon this earth but remember the earth is a redeemable attribute of god that god began to deal with in the days of noah he called it to repentance baptized it in that of water and the blood was shed and dropped upon it to claim it back there at calvary and it is awaiting its fire baptism and you and i have already received it why it's fitting that we would receive it first because we are the ones that were made to rule upon this earth amen so god prepares before he repairs the finality of the earth god prepares the people that is going to occupy and to dwell for the meat shall inherit the earth so it's unalterable so the foundations of this earth are unaltered the found what do you say what are the foundations the foundations are established in hebrews 11 that the worlds were framed by the word of god so the foundations themselves are that of god's word so now what does god do god is going to take the earth right back into that place with the fire baptism where he'll cleanse it off there heading into the millennium and then after the millennium now comes then the future home the baptism of the holy ghost upon this earth and then you and i will dwell upon it in the future home to think how that god would bring all this together back to the foundation you see there's a foundation to come back to and that's the word of god that's why the word of god has meaning in your life because you are always a part of the word of god you might have tried to run from it your mind the devil might have gave you all kinds of excuses of why you can't do it or you're not a part of it but once you get a taste of the power of almighty god that moves upon your heart there's something that raises up on the inside and it presses beyond every lie every doubt and every darkness that's around what is it it's the unaltered god that's in our midst he said i'm god and i changed not i give the same experience the same power with the same deliverance i am unaltered in my ways i am that i am i am alpha and omega you see to be unaltered every one of us people we face pressure you face pressure there's always pressure that's around paul would write of that in romans 12 be not conformed to this world right that's a pressure you know we think about it many times that uh our young people no matter how how young they are and how the ages at start they face pressure there's pressures that they face now i didn't face when i was their age this thing even because of the availability of different things that's out there and you realize in this hour we we can't if i can say it in this way put her head in the sand and say well i'm not going to have anything to do with all that no there's an unaltered source that's in our midst that can give victory over the internet there's an unaltered one that has given victory all the way down through time the holy ghost is the answer to every problem even when you stand there in your own life not knowing the answer but you know in whom you have believed and he is the answer and just as he has unfolded himself through his word and unfolded himself to you and in your life he will unfold himself in every situation and every trouble that comes your way because he's not the author of confusion he's an author with a purpose oh my things take us by surprise but never god that's right think of this here you know brother branham would talk to us in in the terran age of the age that age of that tyra there being that fourth age an age where you had here now things had moved into a place of that red horse rider that we read about in the book of revelations where the white horse had went forth and through innocency and and deception had moved in there to really work to break the power of the church of the living god and when he moved in you say how did he do that he substituted the real reality of the holy spirit in the lives of the people satan didn't care how much doctrine that they had he could just twist it a little bit then the word itself the word has been altered but yet the word remains the same so the word hasn't been altered it's man's idea the word hasn't changed that's where god would come in this generation that you and i are in god was not here on the platform each night and in the pews just to show off god's not just in your life or my life just to show off god is declaring through the message of the hour that i am the same god the word that i have spoken i am the same god there is nothing impossible with god god was declaring in this this hour in this age when superstitions and questions and remember when the gifts fell out there on azusa street supernatural returning back among the church of the living god but now the church begins to believe in the supernatural that's necessary because it's coming to a place of the greatest supernatural event that has ever struck the face of the earth it will take more than gifts but the gifts will be with it in this restoring and the placing of it in the word but the holy spirit would come in its fullness to do what prepare a bride for rapture where the church has put questions on the word but god has a royal seed upon this earth that the holy spirit has sought out and their heart is calling out for an unaltered god an unaltered word i don't want to wear it with compromise i want a god who is the amen of the word hallelujah unaltered unaltered pressure comes but the scripture said be not conformed to this world god told him in the thytaran age it was a dark age the the the pressure brother graham says it's simple like this it was either bend or be broken there was a coalition that came along in order to gain work it it'll apply for what's coming up on this earth in order to worship this is where everything's got to come about you see how everything is setting up right now we hear brethren deals with this and he talks about how communism coming in communism coming in remember brother adam he tells us over and over he says don't you watch and fear communism he said but you watch that purple curtain and brother adam comes around i you know probably i think was about a month ago i was there and listening to the message revelation book of symbols and and here i heard brother branham say of how that that coming in of communism it was only a set up for those to give themselves in for catholicism to take over look where we're at even right now look at even you find such the divisiveness it's safe and sowing hatred and division and everything else it's setting up a right place for that image of the beast to fully come into power because you're going to have people that they might have principles but they will relinquish their principles because they will say hey we can do better by just joining with catholicism see everything is coming it's it's all right in time it's all right in place we're not ignorant of satan's devices we would be if not for the grace of god if not for god's word that has come to us in this hour that's why as a believer god calls our lives to look beyond the things he says lift your head up when you see these things taking place it's bringing the people into a place to where even though they don't agree with one another remember the ram tells us in the message shalom he says it's darkest before the breaking of day and the darkness is causing a congeeling of that time he said you've got them coming together and they don't even agree over doctrines and brother graham takes us into that place of the philadelphian age i will keep the in the hour of temptation we understand the mark of the beast it's already setting forth in the earth that whenever the holy ghost is rejected they take the mark but it's coming to that time we're moving into that moment when the bride is gone from here when that pressure comes down and there will be decisions that have to be made even then we're moving into those hours to where will lives be altered will they rest in an organization or will they see it at that time and say i don't want nothing to do with this because there is good people in there is that right there is but they will be given an opportunity to make their choice but you see it comes down to a place that there is something greater it shows theology can be altered man's ideas can be altered because every one of them they have their absolute but you see a real absolute is an absolute that can stand in the face of other absolutes and it's unmoved and there's victory within it it's life within it it reproduces the very life of jesus christ see brother brown would say it like this he says in that parent age i'm just going to refer to some of these places he says each age had its pressure every age every gentile church age remember god has been calling a bride out throughout these seven church ages we're living in the time of the finish there's not another message there's not another messenger there's not another time coming this we have arrived to the end of the end time we're here this is the finishing up of the mystery of god the capping off of a bride that which god had in his mind is now coming into fruition a bride that reflects jesus christ himself every age had its pressures well sometimes we can look at one another you know let me just say it let me just bring it home here to us even as ministers among the five different gifts you know and you know evangelists or a pastor can look at evangel say hi you know you don't have to put up with all you know just caring and things he's able to move here and drop this here and my go on and sing results there and sing results there and a teacher you know my you know a teacher everything is looks at but what we fail to recognize is is to understand just as every gift and every life we all have pressure we all have burdens there's not one thing you know the the greatest trick of the enemy is to put something like pie in the sky grass is greener on the other side it doesn't become easier lot thought life would be easier it didn't all he did he didn't leave church right away he just turned his tent door he simply was facing here where abraham and them were at all he did was uproot his stint tent stakes and just turned his tent around and dropped it he was no longer in a place of receiving from the word of god and because he turned himself notice what happened though right there in the camp where the vindicated word was at but yet the power of solomon by him looking at it focusing on it taking in it letting it come in the doors of his home the influences soon little by little by little by little eventually he was inside of the boundaries of sodom and in the city and became a mayor i wonder if lot probably thought when he became the mayor of the city man this is surreal wow i never imagined this would happen of course not but it happened right how did it happen little by little by little by little by little by little this is why don't lift up your tent stakes keep your door of your home of your family of your house of your life but the same as sometimes it's a it's a hard barren grant i i see a ground out there it looks like the garden of eden we're not here for things that look like we are promised in this our real true substance amen not impersonations but reality is that right oh my you know i'll never forget i had a man we had a man to come through when we first had built our house where where we where we did live and this guy came through and he had this hatchback car and you know uh and and he he came up to the door well you know we needed pictures at the time we did and you know you could only have ford you know how it is you put one picture on the wall you do a little bit here and wait for taxes come in put a little bit there you you understand what i'm saying and so you know he pulled up and he had these i think it's thomas kincaid in my i got that right these paintings like portraits of light and stuff and he had these things out there brother richie was trying to tell us oh i have some portraits i said what are they up i was tempted i'll be honest with you the thomas again man these things are beautiful i've seen them at the at the christian bookstore but you know it is christian bookstore to buy those paintings you have to have a mortgage document and sign it up i thought man this is beautiful how much aren't they 50 i told my wife i said i was tempted i'll be honest with you i was tempted i said honey these things are counterfeit i said there ain't no way in the world he's hauling these around like this in his back of his car he had quite a few of them i said there ain't no way in the world i said either they're counterfeit or he stole them i said sir i appreciate that but we're not going to be able to buy any at this time a counterfeit you can sell it cheaply but the original cost a lot counterfeits can be bought out for cheapness but an original oh it's priceless that's why the original work of the holy ghost in a life it's priceless it can't be bought out it's unalterable each age had its pressure brother them talks about the pressure that we face in this age think about the great burden that we face in this age and he words it this way it's the pressure of riches it's the pressure for those who have riches it's the pressure for those who don't and are striving to get it's pressure all around i mean it's just like you know well let me go on it just you know you find soft living he said and nervous tensions in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in it would be like if i gave my jacket to brother brian because i know he can't wear my jacket and brother brian tried to put on my my jacket he'd probably rip it and you'd look at it and you'd think man you know or it'd be like paul paul having his suit coat and paul giving me his suit coat you already are like no way buddy you got you need about 10 sizes bigger there why it's unfit for me that's how this age is to a real believer i want you to think of this even when god has done a real work in your life we still battle things we battle pressures anybody like suffering nobody does right nobody likes suffering the lord jesus himself prayed three times is that right identifying that part of humanity his humanity didn't want to suffer but his soul wanted to please and follow the word more than his flesh what won the battle if that word would have only been in his flesh the flesh would have won but the word was down there on the inside and the wired won the battle in the time when the wrestling match was going on oh my my my hallelujah even the babies amen and me on that one back there amen that's wonderful that don't bother me at all notice this soft living and nervous tensions and a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in i don't have to ask you sometimes how how those feelings and those pressures come about but i want to just say it like this every age has had its test and it's the test of the word in this age we're not tested with with the word that god gave to luther that's not the full test that comes to us that just shall live by faith but that's not the full test in this hour for the bride neither is it sanctification neither is it the working of the gifts it's the full word that has come in our midst and it is a full test of the word oh my now you see when we look at it the the tensions we see the world is responding this is why men's hearts are failing for fear this is why you know everything that's being given to people to calm them down raise them up put them to sleep and everything else all those things that are pressure and we sense the pressures even in these bodies we sense that at different times we sense fears at times come on the word spoke to us on sunday be not afraid and we rest in that word and remember there are times that fear comes but that's where we rely upon god and say lord i'm fearful this this situation is fearful but lord jesus you are my strength david said what time i am afraid i will call on god david said i ain't too big to let him know lord i'm afraid and i need to feel your feathers i need to feel the wings of the holy ghost amen that's the kind of people we want to be amen brother samuel ain't that altering not at all because we are united with the living god to know that whatever comes about he is the unaltered one he's the one that keeps us lined up when we get out of sync out of sorts he's the unaltered one and he's the one to line us up oh my let me let me just try to get here to a little place think of this the world they're facing these things now i want to just read some of these things regarding that of daniel you find this here brother brahm is talking about this here in daniel's time and he talks about in the message how can overcome there was four overcomers that could stand the test of fire and the lion brother brandon says now we're expected to be tested that's a good lesson for my brother back there he that cometh to god must first be tested the rem says tested with what with the word that's god's test he that cometh to god must be tested that only shows a true child see he can be tested and when the test comes on you can't overcome unless there's a test to give you and when a test is given it's to see whether you can overcome or not you know it'd be like mom or dad asking how was school there got an a really wow was that a pop quiz well nobody have a quiz you have a test no i got an a in their mind they got an a but the test shows whether you've been studying whether you've been paying attention that's what the test shows have you got the material to where not only can you identify the facts but be able to apply it in situations that are presented to you that's what the test does can you oh my can you apply it when situations are are put to you most of the situations or the tests that we face as believers it's not a b c or d and we say got to be c that's usually the majority of the answers right there true or false anybody got a coin t heads for true tails for fault no it don't work that way the tests that we come to require application can we and do we apply the grace that has been given to us the word that we've been hearing how god is dealing and moving in our life you see god when we come to services when you are out there your your personal walk with god these are not things that just they're taking up time this is god in stealing and putting his word into our heart he's god is speaking to us to bring change to our life there's things that you can set right here in the service and you may not in yourself feel any different but the word is transforming you and you find yourself then when situations arise it's god as you're taking that word in you know you don't stay you know if you here you were as a five-year-old boy let's just say in the lord you don't stay that way with eating on the word of god you grow and you mature and as you grow and you mature the things that were tested and tried upon when you were five years old you don't look at those as tests anymore but the things of your age of where you're at now we're tested upon right but the word matures us for that place notice that only shows a true child jesus said to him that overcometh the test the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you the test is the greatest thing to ever happen to you let's watch out i believe it's written in the scripture peter said our trials are worth more to us than precious gold it's a testing time it's one good evidence how many of you want a good evidence god's with you i like those evidences don't you one good evidence it's one good evidence to us that god is with us when we're tested for all children of god are tested and tried man i thought everything's going to be a nice picnic nice big chocolate chip cookies with walnuts sticking up in sandwich just right where the bread having that lice lettuce and tomato no sauce i thought everything was going to be good we just we're not in a picnic somebody finish it for me we're not on a picnic we're in a a battle we're in a battle but you know what we learn to appreciate the times between the battles and you should rest between the battles as a matter of fact god appoints agents to care for you between the battles when the test had passed for the lord jesus what did the bible say angels came and ministered unto him when elijah was tested and after he was warned what did god do god sent angels to minister to elijah and not just any he called it the one that had the softest hand and he wanted the one that can make the best case is that right and he cared for elijah after elijah had made a stand or been tested in that hour then after the test and the test was passed god ministered to him you see it goes to show that our flesh look at the weakness how the lord jesus even coming through that his flesh there was weak weakened elijah weakened is that right the flesh was weakened here here is the test that's taking place it's it's breaking out it's in a battle of other realms to stand for that word to believe for that word there's pressures that want to come and come against that whether we're going to stand on that word or whether we're going to be altered or unaltered it's within let me say this clearly it's within our human nature to take the easy way nobody wants to be misunderstood nobody wants to be uh what's wrong with this guy nobody none of us i'm talking about a human nature i'm not talking about the new birth the new birth wants to stand on the word of god but the human nature part doesn't like to be misunderstood is that right even in that right there proves greater is he that's in you even in that right there so notice daniel here he was i just want to just let me wrap this these these up here daniel a man of prophet notice brother brown calls daniel and shadrach meshach and abednego he calls them the overcomers in that day the bride he said they weren't the church they were the bride there were millions down there in babylon but only the church of the living god was made up of four four overcomers remember when the bible says when here uh you know when the lord jesus went here life the the life had passed out of his body right and then how he himself rose on that easter morning the bible said many of those who slept not all many many not all in the old testament you say they were offering the lamb but were they offering it by revelation that's the difference you see when it's by revelation it's something from your heart that means more than anything else that's how you know when it's a real revelation it means more to you than anything else in your life it's not head knowledge it's not something that you have to do it's reality to you it means more to you and there's nothing that i will do to alter that oh my i tell you you go a million ways of sunday on that thought right there think about this that was the size of the overcomers them overcomers was put to the task and every overcomer has to be put to the test when they said you take back the word what the word says or be thrown in the fiery furnace they refused anything but the word when daniel was given the test i want to get to this place here when daniel was given the test that he should take back what the word said that they should lean towards the temple as solomon prayed and he would deliver them from all things god would hear from heaven if they'd look towards the temple and pray when you catch what brother brown says that that if daniel would take back he was tested would he take back from the word god had already given his word let me tell you about spiritual discernment because the enemy could have been there to talk to daniel and say you mean you're going to stand upon solomon his word you know what happened to his end don't you you know he got tied up with women right come on now this is scripture but you see it all showed that that perfection had not come they were all types of that perfect one that was to come are you with me but you see even in the midst of all that this is where spiritual discernment looks beyond the veil and recognizes this is not the word of a man it's the word of god because a man's word can be altered but god's word cannot be altered amen daniel could stand right there and say god has said that what he spoke out of his mouth he will not change it let somebody know where they're standing at standing on the word of god when daniel was given a test that he should take back the word now notice brother graham said they set a trap for him i believe that prophet knew that now i want you to just catch this here they set a trap for him and he said i believe daniel knew it they set a trap for him he walked humbly when it come time for him to pray he knowed at the home place in jerusalem there was a burning sacrifice on the altar daniel wasn't afraid of them spies he raised up the shades and threw back the shutters and knelt down on his knees and throwed his hand up to god and prayed now let me just say this to you daniel wasn't doing this because he was under the influence of others who didn't like what was going on in the kingdom are you hearing me because the bible's already said they tried to find occasion against him in the kingdom and they couldn't do it right just like on our jobs i mean look people know how to align with other people they they know who they can go to and be critical same thing in the church and on people they know it any people it's spirits it ain't spirits that work in those manners and they couldn't find anything concerning the kingdom they couldn't say hey daniel's not doing this daniel's not doing they couldn't find nothing he had a testimony he was walking in humility to the word of god and because of being in humility to the word of god whatever was asked of him to do by this by this by this that didn't come against the word daniel said they've been placed in authority over me i will do what they've asked me to do all right okay quiet that's scripture that's bible submit yourself and to ordinance of every man is that right so so we want to stay under the influence of the word and not get under the influence of the world right is that right this is where the battle and as it comes into in before you and i then they laid a trap they laid a trap for him and daniel knew it but notice remember god will never honor the wrong motive and the wrong objective things can be absolutely the right thing to do but god won't honor it if it's the wrong motive and wrong objective is that right but in daniel was found an excellent spirit his motive and objective remained pure daniel wasn't throwing up the windows and saying i'll tell you what they're ain't do you know what they're not going to tell me when i can't pray daniel said you know what daniel do you know this law has been passed yeah i heard about that what are you going to do today i'm going to do what i do every day what is that i'm gonna pray in the morning i'm gonna pray in the noon time and i'm gonna pray in the evening time but daniel look what's coming your way but daniel said that word right there that's coming it's there's been a change come in the kingdom but i'm part of another kingdom that can't be changed [Applause] it can't be it's unaltered so daniel wasn't doing it in defiance daniel said i'm going to keep on being daniel i'm going to keep on being a believer i'm going to keep on living for god i'm going to keep on standing for his word i i didn't choose to be here in babylon but god seemed fit that i would be here i didn't bring myself in favor before the king but it was god who gave me favor with different ones to come in to certain positions it was not my doing it was god's doing he knew where he was standing unaltered the ram said why he throwed up his hands and prayed to god why live or die he had the victory and therefore i love this so much victory till the lions couldn't eat it so much victory to the lions couldn't eat it he overcame it oh my oh he said chad wrapped me shaking a vinegar had so much victory he said you know victory's a hard thing to burn out or eat up or anything victory's a hard thing to clinch amen that's why we must have the victory in our life the victory in our soul the victory day the victory of calvary the victory of the resurrection and then through that victory comes victory after victory after oh sure there's opposition sure circumstances arise mountains bigger than us rivers wider than us everything else but in the midst of that that victory gives us strength because faith is the victory that overcometh the world it gives us strength to stand in the midst of that time and say i'm gonna keep on walking with god i'm gonna keep on being believer i'm going to stand on god's word because god hasn't changed his word hasn't changed laws have changed dictates have changed but god's never changed and i'm united with him who's unaltered hallelujah oh my think about that daniel as he came into that place in his life i like how brother brahman says it like this daniel said i got a testimony he's down there in paradise i got a testimony guys ezekiel is telling us daniel yeah i'm listening to ezekiel i got i got another one i got another one i got another one i got i want to talk about that one who i seen the stone you down the mountain without have but i got more i didn't just have one visitation he visited aren't you glad he keeps visiting you every visitation it strengthens your eye for these moments to walk in an unaltered way let's just stop there tonight if i get going on this next part we'll just we'll just we'll be here unaltered i want you to notice daniel's demeanor in this time he wasn't arrogant daniel was under a greater law it was the law of almighty god he had the right motive he had the right objective and so in the midst when all that was taking place daniel could walk in there and as that scripture we read i think it was verse 10 i believe where we ended that when that that came about that day daniel said i know this statue has been that god has still said to seek him daniel said you know what i'm gonna open the windows daniel are you doing no no i always do that right i've always opened the windows i've always opened the shades right so this is just another day in the life of one with victory it's unaltered let me tell you tonight if you don't have that victory in your heart down in that place you can come to that place in god if you just invite him in brother samuel i have faith you do he's given you faith but if you just invite him he'll operate on your faith and it will no longer be just a mental faith that it will become a supernatural faith of the living god where it will no longer be just your faith because look even after the new birth has come we still have to contend with our mental faith at times but that super sense that victor on the inside that which is unalterable that's why when times when we prayed about things and we didn't get an answer or things didn't come the way we thought about it it doesn't move this down here we might be disappointed we might say what what took place but you know the victory down on the inside is what you draw from and saying i don't understand i don't know why he said no but he's in control and it's an unaltered life by the holy ghost that's the kind of lies we want to live that's a testimony we want to have like daniel unaltered that no matter what comes what test when we're tested by the word because remember everybody experiences job loss people experience fires people get sick people cancer cancer coveted on and on we can go on on we're not exempt the world we face the same things the world faces is that right but the difference the difference is the lord jesus christ when god told egypt he said that you will know how i how the lord doth make a difference how did god make a difference by the blood being on the door that's how god makes a difference it's that token life oh you know you may not be able to hold you know by the same i really can't remember i remember a few quotes or i remember a few scriptures it ain't about remembering quotes and scriptures you could remember all the quotes and scriptures i'm not against that you know that i mean before i god ever revealed that he called me to preach i love to read the word of god i listen to the word listen listen and read but it ain't about how much you can quote so don't let the devil beat you down about that it's what happens in the face of everyday life when you're faced with tests and temptations and sometimes you don't even have you might say well man i need a word to speak towards this you are that word he is the word inside of you and your reaction to that at that point is the word speaking through your life oh my god heavenly father lord jesus how we just appreciate you lord father we lord are living in a dying world among a dying generation we see that lord even things all around us things changing lord even without that things change but we see such change lord things changing but dear god like daniel when he in the midst of of babylon he and the other believers that were there a very small group your prophet called it four overcomers that was there and they were tested by the word there were there were others that evidently that lord they would give in under the pressure the pressure would come to such a place it would be so great that they would give in lord we have to bring it back to the glory of god there is no flesh that can stand against the pressures of this age or any age whether it was down in babylon wherever no no flesh none could stand against the pressures the lord it takes one to stand and i'm thankful tonight lord i believe the congregation lord testifies with me we're thankful that there's one who's standing on our behalf in this time trouble there's one who's standing lord daniel wrote of him in daniel 12 of how that you will make yourself known to israel to us as the bride in this hour we see the standing mighty conqueror in revelations 5 descending and bringing that power of the living god that conquering that stand into the church of the living god lord this message that you've sent us is the quickening power that's come to the word of god to make it alive it's the standard of this hour operating behind [Music] flesh not us but greater is he that's in us [Music] lord we're no match in our own selves for the enemy [Music] but father as paul could say i can do all things through christ who strengthened me as a believer as a child of god we we can do all things through christ who strengthens us lord i pray tonight if there be one lord whether here streaming or archive this if they've not received that victory yet may they may they not just push it to the side but may they just open their heart and say god i want a victorious life i want that victory in my life that victory that triumphed there in the face of temptation in gethsemane that victory that triumph there at calvary that same victory that got up on that easter morning that same victory that came back to the church on the day of pentecost lord i i want to be a partaker of that same victory amen granted lord tonight may the holy ghost just move lord right now to that heart in that life god go lord and operate on their faith and raise that faith to a real living genuine faith of the living god granted lord i asked lord that you would give strength to every one of your believing children no matter what it is that they're facing adversity but may the lord remain loyal and true to the word of god knowing that these things come about but our strength is in you is in the word of god we can never overcome we can never overcome without the word of god lord i ask these things may god you just be the refuge the strength an unaltered one lord strengthen your children lord give them courage whatever lord whatever it is that they are facing would you just strengthen them just now lord in the name of jesus christ amen [Music] amen don't you love him amen i just appreciate him brother brian will you lead us in a few songs of worship could we just worship him if you'd like to stand you're more than welcome stan i may just love the lord how many thankful for his mercy aren't you so thankful the unaltered one in our midst revealing himself as the mighty the unaltered one unconquered by traditions unconquered by man's ideas he's the unaltered one and
