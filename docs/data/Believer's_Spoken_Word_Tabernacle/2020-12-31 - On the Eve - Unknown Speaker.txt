glorious hour amen just thank god for his mercy being able to come here amen on this this evening be able to gather around the word of the lord i believe god has something very special for us let's just go to him in word of prayer heavenly father lord we have lifted up oh god lord praise offering and lord there's been petitions that's already went forth and god we we've invited you into this service lord we've brought you here oh god your prophet would place it so clearly that when the body is gathered together it's more of the godhead bodily gathered together lord jesus we ask that god that he would be so preeminent here tonight we ask that god that if there are any part in our life that god you don't have possession of we want you to have possession [Music] there's things lord that have encroached we desire oh god that you would come o god for you're the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart lord we want every fiber of our being to be yielded to you oh god i pray that lord you'll just take control here tonight speak to our hearts lord in a special way you know every single need o god you're the only one that can meet our needs lord from the requests that have been wrote down lord for the disassembly god for others lord and other assemblies lord jesus you know those needs lord you're mindful of him and lord you're ministering oh god to every single need we love you lord jesus we appreciate you lord o god we just commit ourselves in the remaining part of this service lord into your hands for the glory of god in jesus name amen and amen amen god bless you if you turn with me in the scripture i'm going to read two places and then we'll let you have your seats here this evening thank you musicians amen in romans 13 verse 11 paul would write in this way and that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believe the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light let us walk honestly in the day not in rioting and in drunkenness but in shame not in chambering in wantedness not in strife and envy but put ye on the lord jesus christ that that that phrase you would see that very much in the scriptures it's to sink into the garment and the clothing put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof in ii peter chapter 3 verse 9 peter would write in this manner the conditions are are are given in the first scripture in the first scriptures of this chapter scoffers conditions and you know brother branham would take time and he would deal with conditions that would exist we know a promise that we're waiting on of the rapture but he would take being pressed of god to show us even conditions that would exist even coming into that of the rapture brother branham would say it from works as faith expressed then he would go into the message the rapture and he would read psalms 27 and he would say it in this matter i want to read this for a background for the rapture a background has a lot to say it's one thing for you to have a testimony and what really makes a testimony is is the background is to think god in this age that it is an age of god godlessness it's an age of hatred it's an age that where the bible will just plainly say in the book of romans haters of god and so we find all of these conditions but yet it's in the midst of this age right here that god is taking a people in rapture it's a paradox and so he he lets it be known they're scoffers somebody's got to fulfill that part of the scripture that's not the part that i want to fulfill amen and first in verse let's go to verse 9. the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness i want you to look at this very clearly nevertheless according to his promise this is not just the written promise but it is the living god who has had interpreted the written promise it's his it's the anointing that comes upon our eyes to see the promise that this is the day and this is the fulfillment this is the pathway of this promise and to see that we're a part of it so nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spout and blame amen may god bless you as you're being seated bless his word brown you know he would many times when we look at this and brother branham would approach coming into a new year's eve and and i know that that many uh you know i would hear brother branham ask different ones have you already given your new year's eve message and and there were things that god was just dealing with the culmination of the year things that what god has already done what he's been fulfilling and things that then through that what we are to look forward to and i i look at this that many times you know as the question would come up and brother branham would reiterate it to us he said people have asked me the question what do you think about the future and you know he says i don't know what the future holds but i know who holds the future and so that's the thing he said if i can keep acquainted with him and i think that's the real objective and i want to just just speak just for a few moments on just three simple words on the eve on the eve now when we look at this you know on the eve when we we have a few days of the year of times that we have on our calendar such as we have a christmas eve and here we are today gathered in a new year's eve and the eaves themselves are those things that are a precursor or what comes ahead of time of that day it's something it's one day that leads right into an another day there's no gap between the eve and then the next day matter of fact it rolls from right from the eve right into the next day and so we recognize that even within thinking of this we when you're on the eve of anything of an actual event the eve itself is when when it's captured and recognized it creates an expectation it creates an anticipation and and with that uh a real expectation and an anticipation when it is when it is rightly in tune then it is it is viewed and is received as a time of preparation remember in the days of the lord jesus many were looking for a promise of the word to be fulfilled and they were looking for it but yet when it came they were they were caught off guard and how that god how it would even come and it bypassed as paul said the princes of this world he's talking about the intellects the reasoning and this is what jesus said it's beyond that father i think the thou has hid it from that of the smart and the intellect and the great reasoners but you have revealed it unto babes and brother ramon always had this on such as would learn it deals with a receptive heart a humility that's able to be taught by god at that it's something that you and i did not give ourselves but when we look at this on the eve because i certainly believe with the opening scriptures we read we are living on the eve of the change of the body we are living on the eve of the rapture we are living on the eve of of of our loved ones appearing we are living on the eve you see there's no other age to come there's no other message to come the star that has arose uh remember the same morning star is the same evening star it just depends on the position of where you're at that star remember the wise men were in the east then the star was in the west and they traveled unto the west we are in the east we have seen a star and to think of how that in the time that we are living in we recognize this is a this is a finality of a time that we're living in we do not have exact dates nor do we even try to worry or to even expend time in trying to find the day or the hour jesus said no man knoweth the day nor the hour so we're aware that there's certain things that we're not to expend our energies for but what are we to do we are to recognize this is the time of his coming and then recognizing that we're in a state of alertness we're in a state of watchfulness we're in a state to where we're watching what steps we're taking we're ensuring that our lives are not becoming burdened but rather we're unloading we're making ourselves light and and ready for the translation this is the effect of when the eve is revealed that this is there is an effect upon the lives of the people you know there's many eaves that that are given down through scripture such as you'll find on the feast days it'll say on the moral you'll find things that god will place as as an anticipation as an expectation you find that even where god would speak you know uh to to joshua in three days tell the people to prepare themselves you're going over the jordan god set the eve of expectation and when it drew near god was there to declare this is the eve of the time of the crossing you see man can't declare the ease because the eve is is ordained for there are people who are part of the eve that are to move into that day in other words they are part of this day that is dawning that leads us into that new day so we recognize that with this in mind this is why paul would say you are not children of the night but of the day paul would write be not drunken he's talking about overwhelmed and carried about with the things of this world to where you become intoxicated with it you saw there's an eve there was even an eve on an easter morning where as the scripture had prophesied and jesus stood there and he declared it destroy this temple in three days i'll raise it up again but remember the disciples had forgot they had now been under a gloom they forgot about that because it wasn't happening how they thought it should happen but god that did not stop god from fulfilling his word he fulfilled it anyhow and he came to them and he let them know this is the fulfillment of the word and indeed i am the fulfillment of the word i'm not the fulfillment of your thoughts but i am the fulfillment of the word you see the word came to change their thoughts and line their thoughts with god's thoughts because there was a desire that god himself would come and bring a transformation in their lives so when they went up there on the day of pentecost it was an eve and they were waiting that day to break into their lives you see the eve made them ready for the day and so when we think of this you know down through time we think of you know when uh the emancipation proclamation was wrote and in there in the writing it was declared that those who were being held as slaves that they could go free but even though the documents said you could go free it was allotted a specified time it said on a certain date and it had to be on that date was when the sun would arise then the slaves could go free so here was a written document and there was people who were tied in to the day they were on the eve of that day as as you know brother randall would describe it and history records it they were there there was some down in the valley where the encampment was and they had slaves on the way up that mountain side they were holding hands by hand they had somebody up on top of that mountain on the peak up there that was able to say the sun is arising and able to holler back down there to the slaves and let them know your time of liberty what the promise in the document has said the son is now declaring you are free somebody had to see the sun come up and declare it down in the valley it was an eve that led to the day in the time of the first exodus everything was mounting the evening time everything was drawn close you find many events were happening plagues things were taking place in egypt god sent a message to declare this is the time to leave it didn't happen the way the people thought it should happen the people didn't realize that that that it was there was going to be some challenges and satan is always there to challenge and to oppose the word he'd do the same thing in your life he's there to try to challenge and oppose the word but you see that don't stop god even in a time where you and i could you know look and we can wonder it doesn't stop god god's word is going to be fulfilled and god is fulfilling his word listen my brother and sister it is not up to you and i to get ourselves to believe it is god coming on the scene that he's the one who moves and stimulates and stirs and builds up our faith that's the same way it is for the rapture it is not you and i building ourselves up but it is god that is building us up and brother when that morning rises and our loved ones appear before us i'm telling you you talking about a stimulation it will release a body change around this world hands that are tied together there will be a cry of liberty it's time for the atoms to change it's time for the bodies to change goodbye world goodbye [Music] it was a time of exodus there came a final moment get the lamb slay the lamb take the lamb apply apply the blood you see this time of anticipation on the eve they had to apply the blood and when they applied the blood that was the necessary requirement of preparation when they applied that it cleared their past and gave them a clear future that blood being applied it showed they were identified with the covenant that the living god had made to abraham confirmed to him make real to him and then he had raised up his servant moses to preach under the authority of that covenant being revealed to a covenant people they were identified with the god of abraham hallelujah you see this is where on the eve that we stand the bible says this in psalm 62 look at this scripture truly my soul waiteth upon god from him cometh my salvation he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be greatly moved how long will you imagine mischief against a man you shall be slaying all of you as a bowing wall shall you be and as a tolerant fan this is talking about rising up against the vindicated word the living lord jesus christ verse 4 they only consult look what they do to cast him down from his excellency they delight in lies they bless with their mouth but they curse inwardly are you with me my soul so notice what david's talking about this is a condition this is a condition remember the words out here don't create an atmosphere words creating an atmosphere come from the atmosphere that's within america is that right that's why there's got to be an atmosphere on the inside then when the words come out it's not just words but jesus said my words they are spirit and life they come out with the atmosphere of god to create he noticed this my soul wait thou only upon god for my expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be moved in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god he's your rock he's your revelation revelation cannot be explained you can't break it down on paper but it's a reality inside of your life hallelujah it's an anchor it's a rock storms may come tests may come but there's a greater reality on the inside it's the revelation of god that you are anchored in jesus christ it's a rock that we are built upon oh glory be to god trust in him look at this trust in him at all times g people pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us we think about you know a new year and you know many times people look at a new year and i don't want to say just people i say for every one of us you know a new year sometimes you know you have different goals or different things you want to be able to accomplish i think the first things that we ought to be able to really uh focus on is be able to evaluate spiritually but we don't have to wait till december 31st to do that really for a believer it's every day of your life there's a tension that you've added to your life when you became a believer and that tension that goes on in your heart am i pleasing to my lord that's daily that's it's being taken up daily there's an inventory but to think that within this time and the year that you know as we're living it brings you know it brings a new hope because we also know that we are one year closer to the coming of the lord this day has passed for one day closer to the coming of the hour has passed we're one hour closer so in this as a believer we do not want to look back we want to look forward people you know we could say now i wish we could go back to 20 19. and i don't know you know as far as with the inconveniences and everything that's happened in 2020 but you know the reality of it is godding never took a break in 2020 he's still the same god he's still a healer he's still the same yesterday today and forever glory be to god he's the same god these things that happen are opportunities for god to make himself known [Music] brother tells us right in the times of junction that's when omnipotence speaks and declares itself to think of it not to turn a new page you know you think of how brother ran talks about a man you know opening up you know the paper and his wife said what's in the paper he said same old stuff just different people doing it is that right it's a new page it's a new paper you see this is why for a new year many people have resolutions or they make promises you know many people get exercise equipment just you'll go to the garage sale in march they'll be selling it you'll get it dirt cheap just if you can hold out a little bit because that soon wears off all day oh man i'm going to get this and get that you can just go to a good garage sale you'll get one for dirt cheap because it'll either be in the basement or it'll be in the garage but samuel that's very low of people you know how it is you you know how it is there are things that sometimes that we've intended to do and you find out a year later ah a year later i still ain't painted that room yet what happened between that time what happened life right is that right so sometimes when we look at the mix of this we just don't want to turn a new page because we realize turning a new page will never ever change time doesn't change nobody is that right you know as i've thought i've heard it said so far very very clearly you take a a a a young man that's a dirty man you let him become a middle-aged man he'll be a dirty middle-aged man if he keeps on he'll be in the nursing home a dirty old man why time don't change you can turn try to turn a new page but there's one who can take the control of your life brother he don't turn a new page but he transforms your your life becomes a new life not that you've got to live it's him living it through you see this is why that as paul would say paul would make the declaration i i i i'm here not to count myself he said as though i have apprehended but i reach toward those things that are before me and he says looking you know counting those things that you know forgetting what's behind me and i reach forward to watch before me you know in order to reach before you you've got to have authority to forget what's behind you so there's got to be a greater power than our mind there's got to be a power that if satan can try to bring something up in your mind there's got to be a power that's greater than any memory brother there's got to be a power to say that's not who i am that's who i used to be but that old man don't live here no more you're not tied to the past that's how you can reach to the future that right so i want to press toward the mark of the high calling of jesus christ i want to reach out reach out to that day itself till we stand within that moment in a complete identification when all time fades into eternity you see let me just say it like this when we talk about future you know somebody can say well you're going to be all right now i believe in encouraging people i believe in looking in the word there's things sometimes that unless god speaks and drops something you know we've got promises in his word where we can look at it and say according to the word of god this is a promise that we can stand upon come on now and we can stand upon that promise but you see it's one thing then when god will come down and he will declare what the past is you see because the future brother brown would approach to approach it in this manner he would say if i told you sister come here i'll pray for you you're going to be well he said you would have a right to doubt that but he says if he comes and he tells you something that's in the past he said then he who knows the past surely he knows what your future will be there is no one that can be but he that walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlestick he which was which is and which shall come he that is alpha and omega both root and offspring of david the living god if he can come and reveal what your past is then he can reveal what your future is let me tell you something god has not come to make known what your past was that you remember but god comes to tie you in with where you always were and to bring you because if you can see the past brother then you can also see the destiny your future becomes clear it becomes sure you see this is why when brother adam would pick it up like this you see i watch i watch how the things are unfolding and working and the placing of it when brother adam is dealing here in the midst uh of the message shalom because you see when he takes us here in the message shalom and he's dealing with what you have witnessed god do in the events that's been taking place and he ties this in now think of it in the message shalom he's tying it in to god of many miracles and many things that have taken place that the people saw take place you and i are witnesses of these things we we're not eyewitnesses but you see this is why the bible says blessed are you who are not even there but yet you believe you can't explain to somebody neither can you make somebody believe by explaining something that's sovereignly given by god those keys belong to god alone that's why jesus said flesh and blood had not revealed this unto you you realized he was standing there in flesh and blood but it was not the flesh and blood of jesus christ that revealed it it was god that revealed it hallelujah think of it many of them come face to face with the lord jesus is that right he was there many of them sit there under his teaching i'm talking about a teaching that the bible says never a man speak like this man you know what it was if one that he had all the vernacular correct it wasn't that he had all the peace and q's and the eyes and the t's and pronounced it all correctly the bible said the common people heard him gladly you know what it was there was a god behind the word to back it up that's why they said never a man speak like this let me tell you there was men all the way down through the scriptures who spoke by the authority and unction of the revelation of god it was wrapped up and culminated there of the old testament in the bridegroom the lord jesus christ and now in this hour that we live in now that same lord jesus is in his body the bride of jesus christ it is that same word that's being spoken by the same deity that's spoken in the beginning it's having an effect you see brother ryan takes us in this message and he's trying to what he's dealing with is the future the future how can you deal with the future if you don't deal with the past right somebody says i want to be well that that's the that's future right whether it's the next second whether it's the next minute or the next hour but in order to move to there you got to also deal with the past you got to deal with sin got to deal with unbelief are you with me you see and somebody says well i i you know i want the holy ghost well you got to deal with the past you can't go on to the future without dealing with the past this is the prescription that was laid out in acts 2. you people want i want more of god you got to deal with the past and before you can go forward is that right this is called consecration confession sincerity now notice brother graham will take it he says now think of this he's trying to place the assurance of the people upon the word that god has fulfilled is fulfilling and is going to fulfill in the season in the hour he takes them to three events of how they're right there in the tabernacle after the seven church ages were drawn out he said that pillar of fire it came into the room and he drawed out those seven ages right there on the wall then brother adam takes us into another place and he says there out there he said on mount sunset he said when the seven angels came down with that inspiration he said god came down to with the inspiration to loosen those seven seals that was there and where the blood had been sealed up but now god came down with inspiration to unfold that book to you and i then he brings the third one into a place to see the third one he goes into the place of the blackout where the heavens are blacked out and he deals with how he said after you know the event took place and it goes into the pope going to jerusalem brother brown will continue to talk about them blackouts he said watch these blackouts he said it's a sign of the coming of the lord and he deals with how that then when the pope he said here are the phases of the moon that took place right there and they snapped that picture on that day there all the way through and the very final picture the seventh one it was completely the moon was completely blacked out now you know that the moon represents the church is that right the bible tells us in revelations chapter 12 when we look at that in revelations chapter 12 it speaks of how that the woman remember the bible says here she was she had a crown uh you know upon her head uh you know and she she had that she was clothed with the sun moon under her feet upon her head a crown of twelve stars you see she had crossed over there under her feet was the jewish orthodox law she had crossed over from the law under and come under the holy spirit the foundation the 12 apostles that ministry she had come under the holy spirit there had been a crossing over just as it was in the days of joshua you see there's got to be a coming out of and are going into and it's identified you see what is happening the spirit of god these are not we recognize in the scripture that this is why the inspiration in this hour it come to let you and i know these are not just stories these are not just happenings in the scripture that are given to try to you know excite and stimulate faith but it is prophecy that god himself is fulfilling in this hour in this time to show moon itself represents the church you know the church the moon the moon is given to to display the light in the absence of the sun is that right but remember what happens when when something gets between the earth and the sun what happens it becomes worldliness shadow is that right it gets a shadow upon the earth when something comes between we know it as an as an eclipse is that right something comes between the sun and the moon we receive these things there that are in the heavens david said the heavens declare the glory of god they display his handiwork so we see that in this let me let me back up and pick up you know this scripture that we look at here in this time in exodus or isaiah 60 verse 1 the scripture says arise and shine for thy light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee now we know the promise in the scripture says in first child walk in the light as he's in the light then we have fellowship one with another and the blood of his son cleanses us from all unrighteousness and let me just say to you we're not just walking in light we are light jesus said as long as i'm the world i'm in the world i'm the light of the world is that right then he turns right around in the book of matthew believe chapter 5 and he says ye are the light of the world right placing it together paul said you were sometimes darkness but now are you light in the world you weren't just in darkness you were darkness but now we're not just in light we are light in the lord not to think there within there's a gross darkness a gross darkness upon the people there's two spirits that's at work there's a holy spirit and there's satan there's two spirits that's at work even in this time and in this hour this is why that when we we look at it that when we see a gross darkness we're talking about we're talking about demonic oppression we're talking about listen friends we're in an hour there's an influence that's on you're either going to be influenced by god or you're influenced by satan are you with me i want to be under the full measure of god's influence i want an influence that's not just when i come to church thank god for that i want an influence that goes better than my buddy i want an influence that goes deeper than a husband or wife or a mama or a daddy i want the god who is the soul influencer to come on the inside and influence every part of my life that's the kind of influence that we want to be under because then it don't matter where you're at who you're around or whatever more you're the same it presses you know brother brown was saying like this he said the people themselves you know he says you feel sorry for him it's just he said as jesus said on the cross father forgive them they know not what they do you see it in this hour you see it even in politics you see it in many of this measure but the rabble bring all these things around you think it you look at things and you you you just look at it around and you realize pete there ain't no way somebody could say this or somebody could think this or how can people just you know lay down on some how can this happen it's spirits that are pressing in let me just tell you something god ain't losing the battle whatsoever god whatever the enemy's getting is because god's allowing him to get it [Applause] this world system it's not our home we're just passing through this is why we're on the eve all of them down through the ages have waited as though they were living in the eve of his coming is that right this is why we find this this this great of darkness that's setting in you find that of even how the time and i don't want to lay so much into the types but i want to pull it out uh you know seeing how brother brown lay it in the scripture he would tie in how that when abraham was coming after there in genesis 14 the battle with the kings was where lot had been taken captive lot had no defense in sodom kings are you with me kings came in and overthrew sodom but there was one king went under the inspiration of god abraham abraham was a ruler placed by god are you with me and he knew that satan has come and taken something that belongs to me brother ram said abraham he didn't have to ask he just looked at it that way god gave me the land and lot's part of the land i'm going to get him amen oh let us not try to reason his satan has come along and there's something that belongs to us just identify and say god under your anointing under the inspiration i go after that loved one i go after that wife i go after that husband i go after that lost one amen here extends all these kings come out wow what a victory celebration but in the midst of it here comes the king the king of king and priest of salem melchizedek brother brown tells us the reason he's come out from jerusalem he's been put out of that city just as christ was put out in revelations 3. he was put out listen now they hold the bible hold scriptures but remember he's not welcome this is why i stood you know sorry over a year ago and a man was trying to tell me well these people you know they believe the bible i said brother they don't believe the bible if you reject the vindicated word you reject the very god who inspired the prophets and inspired the bible i said that is false you know better than that you see how people can get under under a thing but you see look at this where's melchizedek and he brings what abraham needs abraham recognizes him abraham did not pay tithes and offer he did not pay ties to nobody else he recognized there was one king that stood out above all the other kings it was a spiritual discernment in the midst when sodom was trying to offer him oh here let me give you something let me reward you but abraham said i did not come for a reward let me bring it personal i'm not serving god for a reward i know there are rewards over there but i'm not serving him because there's a reward i'm serving him because i love him he has changed my life [Music] [Applause] so i don't on about bill buy him out too late too late but already been a call on his life and for the first time he's seen that one who spoke to him standing visible are you with me here he makes himself known see how this is a parallel within the scriptures letting us know the time that we're living in this is a fulfillment this is a season it's a time because remember never never never in the scripture did it a lot that the earthly jerusalem was our mother galatians 3 that new jerusalem that heavenly jerusalem that is mother of us all that same one that john in revelations 21 that it speaks i saw that new jerusalem i saw that city coming down from god out of heaven as a bride adorned and prepared for her husband she's been part of the eve that leads into the day she's been part of the preparation as jesus said upon this rock i will build my church each one of the bride members that are part of that body they have found their position in christ down through the ages it's a complete body in this hour he's not rapturing a partial body but it's a rapturing of the entire bride body that has been down through the ages as he makes himself known in the power of his resurrection and the fullness of this person right here among us the same living god these are not fantasies these are not stories these are realities these are realities that you're not resting on somebody else's revelation it's your revelation you know what you were and you know what you are who did that the same god this melchizedek this same one who is right here in our midst making himself known the bible says paul would spend countless time in the book of hebrews and he would declare that this one who had neither father nor mother nor beginning of days nor ending of life and brother bran will pick it up whoever this man is he's still alive tonight he's the same yesterday today and forever just as john could stand there under the revelation of his ministry and say he's right here in the crowd he's right here he's right here then another day would come john would be back there baptizing he's right here he's right here one day brother the he is right here came present john stood faithful to that revelation the same word that you hold dear i am i am redeemed god has changed my life he transformed my life that same revelation you hold in your heart and you're declaring i'm part of that rapture i'm part of that bride i'm numbered with jesus christ i'm united with him that same confession and profession in your life brother one of these days that change is gonna strike in your life what you have been declaring by the power of the holy ghost in your life will one day become a reality hallelujah glory be to god hallelujah we're not just walking in light we are light and why when the pope brother brown picks it up the pope went over to jerusalem and that's where he ties it in we're not of that earthly jerusalem i've heard with different brothers that's went there i remember a couple years ago brother wayne and i were together in a meeting and we were sitting there and brother lane was talking about he said but samuel he said it's really quite awe-inspiring when you stand there you know to to think about i'm right in the area where my future home is going to be but to realize it will not be that you with me it will not be that but it will be that which comes from above even in the millennium it'll be that which god builds is that right so you see this is why even in the time we're living in the two messengers that went to sodor remember there was one that stayed back with abraham one that stayed with him but two went down to sodom is that right went down there they went down there and they ministered but remember their ministry it blurred the eyes to the door blinded them the people could not see to the to get to the door that ministry of billy graham and oral roberts but let me just say this to you so you understand brother branham called it in god warning before judgment he said it's messages of god they've got their message he said and we've got our message and it's all the mercy of god hey listen now when lot was brought out lot would never be an elect of god but i think look at the scripture says lot good even in what he had received thou hast multiplied thy mercy to me he received listen to me now he received what god had given to him he never could see what abraham seen but he never tore it down either are you with me now i want you to think of this here this is why we're living in a time this is why brother right now he brings it around he says now where we're at he said what i believe that god is fearing to feeling is doing and he takes the scripture fear not little flock for it's your father's good will to give you the kingdom he said god is separating the light from the darkness think darkness gross darkness is upon the people churches it's been blacked out when the pope went there to jerusalem you blacked out it blacked out showing for the church it's black it's darkness what is it worldliness darkness has crept in where people if they don't want to do that they don't want to be that way but as brett brown put it he said it's a darkness that presses them you realize there's people listen friends these why this is why in these times like this you're not you know when you look at things this is why the discernment on things there are sometimes when you're looking at things you're not talking to people you're talking to demons i'm talking about in religious realms it ain't putting nobody down it's recognizing let me tell you something the bible said when that evil spirit is cast out it walketh in dry places if it returns and it finds the house empty garnished and swept it returns with seven other devils and does the lastest day of that man is worse than the first it doesn't mean that he becomes a worse drunkard or a worse this or that that he ever was he becomes something worse than a drunkard he becomes a religious inspired man and religion is the worst devil there is somebody preached with me a religious devil it's got everything mastered on its own come on friends your religious devil now think of this in this time that we're living in this is why the scriptures we read in psalm 62 this is why i was looking at this that we can look forward with the certainty to the future now just stay with me here just a few moments it's times of darkness that we're in we've seen fear in this a in this time this year fear has come and gripped people and if people just stop and think for a little bit just think but how fear has gripped them fear has caused people to compromise or question certain parts of the word that are not even to be questioned you're going to preach with me or no one has done that fear the bible says trust in god at all times there's not one scripture in the bible that's wrong with superscript that you go to the bottom of the page that says well this is optional in times of you understand what i'm saying i'm not saying that to be hard but i'm looking at when did god make his word optional jesus help me here you see we're living in a time before the rapture which is going to take faith like never before and the worst culprit an enemy of faith is fear and worry dread uncertainty and that's satan's job listen to me it's satan's job to even try to come and hit at you to try to get you thinking about yourself to try to make you uncertain and if he can pull you out from out from living in the soul realm and get you out here in your thoughts you'll start tripping like your trip downstairs are you listening to me this is why you're made to live brother brad was saying like this in one of the millions he said that real baptism of the holy ghost on the inside of your life he said that's what you're to drink from that's what you're to draw from it's that experience on the inside and that's where you grow you grow by drawing from that reality that's inside of your life you draw from that you set here as a son and daughter of god and you feast on the word to know that this is my promise these are my promises i have passed from death unto life my time belongs to him come on friends in the days of noah they exalted science above the word preach with me now it's always science has always come to try to challenge the word of god is that right they told noah phooey you can't there ain't no such thing as a rain i don't care what you could say you couldn't get the revelation out of his heart [Music] what i'm trying to tell you tonight you might have lost contact with the revelation in your heart but there's a time that you can get back in contact with that reality oh that just don't make sense so when did we start going by that come on now we walk by faith not by sight hallelujah you see he holds my future amen he holds your future is that right this is why brother ryan would put it like this you know from what we read in psalm 62 he said so i just put my life in his hands it requires patience and to pick this up patience but sam you're just preaching right behind the prophet i feel safe i've always done that because this is a revelation of jesus christ you see with patience it requires patience to obtain promises how many of you have ever had to wait on something right i'm not even talking about the promise of god i've never had to save for something and wait on it sometimes you have to say man i like a new gun or i mean i'd like a new sofa you know and you got to save a little bit for it maybe it's only ten dollars here and ten dollars there and you still you start looking at and you're like man that thing i hope it don't increase in price boy i hope they get a sale and this and that you know sometimes when they get the sale you're oh my goodness man this is the best sell of the year they've just marked it down one penny right i've really got to move on it now and we get impatient because impatience that's not part of our soul that's part that's here those are things that we deal with sometimes we get impatient maybe sometimes when you get to looking and feeling like i'm not doing a good job or am i really growing as much as i ought to be and you get to looking at the wrong thing now when we look at these patients you see patients how does patients come patients we know there's trials we know there's tests but what also brings patients by knowing that god is he's the same who was he's the same that we'll be and brother ram will continue now tying this right in again in the message see it's a pattern he's showing us he said now the same god who came and gave the seven church ages the same god who came out there in sabino canyon the same god he said that now put those signs in the heaven he said the same god look he said he's vindicated it he said there's been three witnesses of vindication the same god he said that did that is the same god that's to fulfill the promise of the change of our bodies so where is our faith at well you see it's not just in us looking at events we are the product of this message this message is not an idea this message is not a man's thoughts this very very clearly as brother brandon put in mighty god unveiled before us he said to think the message of the hour the express thoughts of jehovah it's simple you know gory goes right above of people's heads it goes right over because why you can't explain it it's not for the intellect it's not for the smart paul even said as i read it here on sunday you see many that are not wise and noble and mighty that are called but what is it many who are weak and every out here but see on the inside there will be people that maybe you can look at and say well my man they ain't even smart at all but it ain't about how smart you are there's people can be a whole lot smarter that may be able to quote a whole lot more scripture but that ain't what counts what counts is is do you have the life on the inside because it don't matter how much you can quote it matters how much he can live through you glory be to god amen now notice how how this you know would go because many times a person could say i've tried i've tried brother and we picked that up with a patient brother grandma tried i tried he said we'll keep waiting sometimes this is why people have hear that god has made them a promise and they've walked away they got they got impatient with god and then the devil comes down it's not for you it's not this and not that but if god's made a promise god is present to back that promise up what do i do wait that's scripture they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with look at the future you see the only way you can look into the future is to know your past is clear amen and the past being clear isn't just well i ain't done that in a while no no the past is where there's been a pass inside of here you're passed from death onto life it's something that just it's settled it's just settled it's a satisfaction you see this is why this message as i said moments ago this isn't doctrine so much deeper than that it's the life of jesus christ it's a token that's to be on display it's a living god who lives inside of a husband living god who lives inside of the wife a living god who occupies in a home a living god who declares to this generation this is who i am amen and god's got some tools that are yielded as instruments to bring that realization let me tell you the prophet the prophet god sent in this hour was an example was a witness of how god wants to use every son and daughter of god because when the prophet left the scene god in his fullness of his word did not leave the scene that same mighty angel that descended in revelations 10 is the same mighty angel the same god that's right here in his bright body are you with me he's the same yesterday today and forever he's the same pillar of fire the same god discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart the same god baptizing with the holy ghost the same god casting out devils the same god healing the sick he's the same yesterday today and forever amen he's got a bride on earth who's established on the rock we've seen a lot when i say see a lot over the years there's been a lot of things that some of you that's older seen a lot over the years where you've seen people that rise up and they come under an inspiration and they're this new person or they're this or they're that right but what was that the lack of patience before the bride of jesus christ the bride that stood on let me tell you something friends let me tell you something i've heard things where people have said things well this brother can't quote much scripture or this brother you know not much spiritual and sometimes the very one that's doing that is the one who talks and runs down everybody else that has nothing to do with it being spiritual let me tell you something being spiritual isn't even that you've been used and god has performed miracles through you that's not even being spiritual being spiritual scripturally scripturally is to be spirit-filled brother said it like this he said i've seen many people who have faith to perform miracles and yet they weren't spiritual at all because to be spiritual is to be spirit filled paul said let him that is spiritual acknowledge the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord you never said let him that's spiritual they speak in tongues or they do this and do that no no no spiritual is to be spirit-filled and to have faith in that word not knowing how how it's going to come to pass but god said it and the god who said it will bring it to pass what are you gonna do ain't gonna try to figure it out but he's gonna find me waiting i'm gonna be looking and i'm gonna make him making sure as peter said being diligent be found that i'd be found blameless i'm not trying to wash myself but at the same time i have to rub shoulders with the world so i want to make sure that stench don't stay on me sometimes when i'm out there and the supermarkets are around different ones or sometimes you hear certain things things that i didn't ask to hear certain words that you didn't ask to hear certain sites you didn't ask to see but thanks thanks be to god there is a lutron a washing a laver there is a place that you can come and you can wash up and brother you can wash yourself you can wash your mind you can wash yourself from the contaminants of the world why there is a place provided for you because as priests you're to enter and wash your hands and wash your feet your doings and your goings and god's provided that in his word a clear future because this inspiration has come the same god that has brought this word has brought the change in you so this is the question i asked you see a future wow that's a it's a great thing for many people it's sad things that's happened in this past year i just looked out here i just come up here today there they identify biden as the second catholic president in 60 years this is not this is not you know this is their this is their how do you say it their their channels or whatever that's putting it out there the first proclaimed catholic president in 60 years think of it we never had fraud like this since 60 years ago i'm not here to get in politics i'm not i'm not that's not even my focus i want you to understand if you can't these are things that's so obvious sure there's always been fraud this is so obvious but you're showing it shows think of the people think friends this is not our certainty our certainty as people's not tied into this brother brahma identifies they said see there's no certainty in democracy now you look at this this is not where i said can you think of what the rest of the people has to look forward to think of what the people out there they think why don't we devote the next time right i know what i even do and what do i even care what do i even want why don't i do this why don't you do that you see it's like anything there was a lease a little bit of hope but that's not so with you because your eyes are not set upon those things sure i appreciate a good president but our eyes aren't set up on those things but to see the time that we're living in a future wow a future to see the way people are going they don't even think of you realize when people don't have a real clear path and their eyes are not open they can't see what's before them when they come under an anointing like that listen to me i'm talking about even people can sit inside a church and they don't even recognize when all of a sudden they start pulling back on the word they start pulling back on the word what happens you're turning your tent door from the word and you're turning it to the world and i'm going to tell you when you turn your tent door to the world it's not you controlling you but sodom will eventually grawl you into her grasp that's all lot did he turn his tent door and begin to face sodom and eventually before you know it he's the mayor of the city it has a pool sodom has a pool the world has a pool but so does god have a pool it's a pool that's greater than the world brother without bull that's moved inside of your life it's something that's drawing you even if you're not fully surrendered it's a power that's drawing you [Applause] hallelujah what's he trying to do he's trying to let you know i'm the god who can deal with your past i'm the god who can give you a real [Music] future he took a woman at the well who had a past she was so ashamed of she had a pass she couldn't go to the well at a certain time but then he came he dealt with her past in such a way brother that she left her pots and went back into the city what happened there was a word that came to loosen her the smart educated and religious elite in that day they looked on him and said blc pub scoffing at him but when he came to her he found a heart oh sure her life was dark but beneath the darkness was a receptive heart amen was a heart that could be spoken to you know brother adam tells us he said where there's a resentful spirit the holy ghost won't reveal nothing this is why it makes all the difference in the world to have a receptive heart we don't want to have a resentful because anytime you you ever see like that you've been left in that no doubt i've been left and sometimes you're left in places you think lord where are you at where's the words where where are the words not coming you know what god's doing god's protecting that person and that individual because it's setting with the resentful spirit and they're not receptive but you realize when you go to speak to a receptive there's a connection there's something that starts to happen and there's things that start flowing and you're like man i'm not even putting this together this is not things you've been studying it's things that yes you might have read and you know maybe in your devotion things as you've heard in the message but you realize it's not you putting it together how it's coming out that way you almost say my goodness i'd like to sit down and grab a seat by me saying this right here why because it's not you that says it that's why jesus said take no thought what you shall say in that hour it shall be given to you [Music] this is why we don't fear oh my so here this this clarity this future i said i was closing i know you say yeah right you say that all the time but once you think of this brother branham he comes back from africa he has that amoeba he comes into that place and they brother brahm has amoeba because of things that happen over there but i want to focus on the amoeba and i want to focus on what the lord told him but brem's been suffering for months it was about six months suffered he suffered with that amoeba parasite in his system up all hours of the night and other things you can you you know sometimes how it is when you're sick and everything else but it says oh god you begin to just think about what brother bondsworth had told him oh god he already says are you going to heal me of this lord is this going to keep on going in my body or how long is this going to be how long is it going to keep on going like this he said about that time you said he came walking in the room he hadn't spoke to him in months but he came walking in the room and he took typewriter paper and he typed on it brother branham he said he speaks to him he says you've been wondering what's your future going to be like brotherham said he took those papers out and he said he just threw them papers and he said every one of the papers he said they went right on up he said it was a pathway right on into heaven and he said what was spoken out don't worry your future is clear well there brother bran said at that moment he said he said i asked him well don't leave i how long i want to know i want to know lord is this is this it is this done in my body is this done he said it's done he called the doctor he said i want an examination two witnesses came his mother-in-law and you know the banker two witnesses they had had dreams and revision things like that brother brown walks into that clinic where the doctor's at and he said to he said check me out and see if there's an amoeba he said check me out he said that amoeba's gone the doctor said you got that amoeba he's a good man you got that of me but i just checked you the other day he said it's gone brother brandon said see what it is he said i knew what had already happened the man checked him went in the lab came back say hey man i i need to check you again brother brahma said you're not going to find anything he said he said you have to have me to check you month after month he said because it just don't happen like that brother brown said you can check me every day if you want to that amoeba is god let me tell you when god deals with your past brother the devil can try to show up every day god has dealt with your past unbelief is god the devil's been defeated and god has birthed a son and daughter of god you'll never be known as a sinner no
