the wrong way but it blessed my heart because you do like to me is you say what do you mean by that well you know I I believe that everything we look around and say what can I do what can I do and others were were doing that as well and I just appreciate that we so appreciate amen also the May meetings that's coming up it's the weekend before Memorial Day we changed it this year and um a lot of things were already um uh we're filling up and I was just debating back and forth well when I went the other day after we had already made the decision about the meetings I don't know what all is going on Memorial Day weekend in this city but the hotels are already booked wow so um I know there's been a lot we've had to deal with college graduations as well as High School graduations and band camps I know cuz I've had to work through all of that with hotels and things but it's the weekend before the schedule's on the board it's a little different we're not going to do a Saturday service we're just going to just have Fellowship on that Saturday Friday night service but two on Sunday and the second service on Sunday will be um the youth service at 5:30 p.m. I hopefully I'll I kind of got it from some of the young people in other churches last year they said brother Samu why don't you have a Sunday night service on Memorial Day I said well I can't preach brother Nathan four times so but uh I think that will work out really well the details are on the bulletin board and uh we'll get an email out about that and then sister Amanda's going to get the menu I just had spoke with her we had spoke and she let me know that so we'll have three months but don't cook your head your food three months ahead of time and put it in the freezer don't do that you know I always tease my mom a little little bit when she gets out banana bread I said was this banana bread from 1990 I I I tease her a little bit you know uh uh you know so also the March calendar I know brother Shane had got that out and then brother Shane isn't there this evening youth activities this evening okay so uh the young people know what we're talking about there um let's just go into the word of the Lord this morning uh many announcements that were there but uh we we'll try to keep up on that and but I want to go to Ruth chapter 4 I mean chapter one want to say to brother Trevor and sister Rea God bless you it's good to see you amen amen so good to be in the house of the Lord I tell you we had a um just um a wonderful time and uh sister Angeline right sister Angeline's here God bless you Sister angelene I I seen it last week but you know my mind as the service gets going but we had just a wonderful time with the um the young people there we always do and uh they they make it very easy and when you get into a subject and we started we started covering a subject on Friday night there I just felt led of the Lord to start into it and uh I told him I said you might actually hear this in a service I'm not going to preach it today but uh friendship and making friends and showing it through the scriptures and and how that we approach that and overcome come even all of our uh Parts in our lives because sometimes people say well I'm an introvert or I'm an extrovert and I'm a and we we I believe God gives us leadership and and helps us to overcome in those areas because every every area sometimes we can look and say well this is a weakness well but there's also a strength to it as well and the areas that sometimes like I said with the extroverts yeah it's a strength but it can also be a weakness they can get themselves entangled in things that they shouldn't boy should we just preach on this [Laughter] but uh you know I just made the approach them I said everything we do uh you know we want to look at it and say is it Godly and friendship is Godly amen I think throughout the Scriptures it says Abraham the friend of God Amen Ruth chapter 1 you probably ready to be seated here in a moment amen God bless you I know some of you have to to do that maybe we could just read a couple scriptures then we'll just finish reading the rest as you being seated in verse 14 and they lifted up their voice and wept again and orpa kissed her mother-in-law but Ruth clave unto her amen may God bless you bless the reading the words you're being seated and we'll just continue to read I want you to notice in these parts of it but Ruth clave unto her and she said behold thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people and unto her Gods return Thou after thy sister-in-law now remember Naomi and her husband IMC had uh left out of the uh land of Israel times had got rough and hard and they left and remember we see it scripturally throughout and the prophet would be quick to point this out to us from Abraham to wherever is that anytime we leave the promised land of God we're out of position and so Satan's desire is always to try to draw us and get us out of position from where the blessings of God are even where God would work and as we looked that a little bit last week where God will work and deal with your life you want to stay in that place where God is working and dealing with your life and let me just say this to you one sure sign that God is working and dealing with your life is all hell will be against you Devils will be against you demons will be against you all of these say everything will be turned loose but remember that's just like that airplane when it comes to that point it's got to break through that barrier so when opposition comes it's no sign it's time to turn back opposition is always there to challenge us when we come to obtain a promise of God that's so I want you just to take this and I it may go a little bit I don't know we'll see how we go here this morning but remember that their Naomi's husband had passed away and you know God has a way of getting everyone and getting his people in position you know I was marveling here as I was just praying the other day and just meditating and of how that sometimes you know when as we speak about that you know as a person in a life would come to serve the Lord and we know that it has to be the love of God that would actually begin to stir that heart and that is true and yet as the prophet would say within that he says we could not even seek after God unless God had turned our nature God had actually begin to draw upon us we couldn't even seek after him so it's all God working to turn our hearts in that way and then even when you think concerning different uh times like this uh like with Emil what if EMC Naomi's husband had not passed away probably would have still remained there but you see God knows God knows just how many feathers to take out of the nest to get us back into the where we need to be sir because let me just tell you the Bible is very clear he is mindful we are but flesh that there is a battle with this flesh leading up to the Holy Ghost and then he equips you with the Holy Ghost to subdue it and battle a against it but there's always a battle around and I look at gyrus the prophet called him a secret believer but God allowed a situation that forced him out to make a decision now you could call and say well if he really loved God if he was really one of his but see God knows that the situation will not overwhelm the seed that's there but God allows the conditions to come about that a decision might be made brother B also said it yes yesterday morning as I was going through it remember in uh with Garnet Peak and this is out of the I'm the resurrection and life in in the latter part of 63 and remember Garnet Peak was an 18-year-old boy and uh remember he had dealt with polio and all of those things and uh you know brother brandham you know had asked uh Garnet he said Garnet if you could be out here on the street you know and driving a hot rod and all these other things and run around with friends and he said Gar he said would would would you rather do that or be where you're at right now in Christ and Garnet said I would rather be exactly where I'm at right now in Christ and brother BR said it like this Garnet had objectives to be a tobacco Auctioneer he said and no doubt he would have went that way but that's not what God had for him and he said what it was polio came and God took po polio to Drive Garnet to him so sometimes situations that we are looking at and can I just say it this way sometimes situations that maybe we're trying to pray our loved ones out of be careful you're not praying them out of when you've already been praying God get a hold of their life Lord take the feathers out of their nest Lord turn this situation around now you might say as a husband or wife will say I don't want to live with a grizzly bear I do that already enough I I don't want any other problems but remember it's focusing on that Soul that's what really matters and God knows how to bring the conditions to where that everything around that will fade away or as the prophet could say rot around that seed that seed must rot and die that rotting is to its own ideas to its own ways to its own thinking to everything of self it's dying to self let me just tell you this there's nothing can bring that outside of the message of the hour because the message of the hour is the inspiration of God it's the Waters of God that's been released in this hour or as the prophet could even call it the mercies of God in his richness that actually will bring conviction to your life and let you know where you're at and where you need to be and it brings a moment where you can rock to your own ideas because outside of this word outside when we're talking of the message of the hour we're talking of the revealing of Jesus Christ what he it's a covering a covering it only covers over what's really needed and I'm glad that the blood of Jesus Christ in its covering it deals with the sin question it deals with the real problem on the [Music] inside and it's prevailing power now want you to notice this my how did we get here but I want you to notice this here amik passes away Naomi's husband and they begin to hear that there is bread back in Israel you see God knows exactly when to drop that word when they look like all hope is gone and God says there's bread bread is the staff of Life staff of life it had meaning to her you know what it meant is that there is provision there is Bountiful provision in Israel and here orus husband dies Ruth's husband dies and then here they're all going to go back into Israel and I want you to notice the Bible has it words at here in the opening scripture of verse 14 it says but Ruth clave unto her Ruth was already cleaving to Naomi there was a connection between her and Naomi I want you to understand me a moment it was a connection that was deeper than just a daughter-in-law and a mother-in-law yes sir that is of a great value but it was a deeper spiritual connection you say well what does that mean because you can have a strong familiar or family connection and it can lead you out of the will of God that's why you've got to make sure that your absolute is not mother father or anybody else you've got to have an absolute yourself and that absolute is Jesus Christ his word not Mama's word not Grandma's word not Grandpa's word you've got to have a word there's a word from God for your life it's got to be personal in your life because listen to me every devil out of hell is against you when you start making a step for the kingdom of God and Satan will not stop at anything to try to pull you aside or lead you aside you say brother Samuel can I actually have an absolute without that absolute coming inside of me at first you've got to have an absolute that you're looking for and when you look to that absolute that this is the truth this is who he is it will lead you to the absolute experience in your life that'll anchor you the scripture said when they found that pearl of great price they sold everything to obtain it Ruth clave unto her there was something spiritual going on let me just tell you something there's things spiritual going on that you may not even realize it God moves beyond the depths of our carnal mind sometimes we're so busy trying to filter everything through our mind and the spirit of God the supernatural it'll bass it it'll move right through that and right down on the inside and you know what that's showing it's showing you that the real you is not your mind up here but the real you is that down on the inside that is drawing on God oh hallelujah hallelujah but here is't it incredible just the next verse Brianna if you don't mind the next verse here thy sister-in-law orpa just and all it took was just a little word to or for to orpa you guys you go on back I don't have no more Sons see there's a law of redemption in order of redemption to raise up seed unto thy name and she tells them are you going to wait till I get old I'd be too old to get married have children again so you know what when that's said every little bit of a hope is gone from orpa it didn't take much for orpa to say if there's no hope for me I'm out of here she kissed her mother-in-law on the cheek but Ruth though she could not see here and though what she was hearing sounded hopeless there was a greater connection on the inside there was something on the inside that begin to respond when the spirit said yes this said yes the spirit said yes this said yes is that right the prophet said the atmosphere falls in the meeting and begins to say yes Lord thy promises are true and the Soul says yes Lord yes Lord what are you doing stepping into the the water this is your [Applause] promises she turned and went back let's read what Ruth said in verse 16 Ruth said after it was said go on go ahead and go after your sister-in-law I don't blame you I don't blame you brother Samuel that's discouraging Hey listen the syop phenician woman when she came to the Lord Jesus she was there and she said uh thou son of David have mercy on me and he said it's not meat to take the the bread for the children and cast it to dogs the prophet said Jesus himself tried his best to discourage her you say why would Jesus do that because she knows the need in her life and the word itself cannot deny the word it rose up a humility out of her heart and she said true Lord but the dogs eat the crumbs from the master's table you know what she said you're not running me off you're not getting me off your hands I know what you've got I know what you have I know what I need in my home I know what I need in my marriage I know what I need in my life you're not running me off I tell you that's a seed that's a seed on the inside that's pressing its way above the muck and the G and all the junk that's packed in it and Ruth said entreat me not to leave thee entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee in other words no more words about me leaving because they're going to fall on deaf ears I don't know the word Retreat sorry I only know go forward that's all I know go [Applause] forward but you're a moabitas I'm going what promise do you have I'm going if she wanted she could have had a lot of excuses of why to turn around or if I had some excuses so she thought now watch this for whether thou goest I will go Lord show me every step of the way no where you go I'm going where he leads me I will follow glory and where thou lodgest I will Lodge wherever your presence sets down and begins to work in my life that's where I'm going to sit down and I am going to eat myself into a body change I am going to eat myself to where I see my enemies under my feet I am going to eat myself to a place where I can see the things that once bothered me no longer bother me where thou lodgest where you rest I'll rest where the pillar of fire sets down that's that's where I'll settle down thy people shall be my people and thy God my God verse 17 where thou dest will I die and there will I be buried the Lord do so to me and more also if ought but death part thee and Meen what a determination and think of this of a determination of an individual that doesn't even have a promise like you have before you this morning that's already been written in the word examples all through the word that no matter what a life could say you don't know where my life is at you don't know how shattered it is you don't know how it doesn't matter there there's countless promises and examples as well as all through this Congregation of witnesses of what the Redeeming Grace of God has done and will do there is no circumstance there's no sin there's no condition there's nothing too great for my Jesus nothing is too great for him he's a mighty conqueror Hallelujah he's not there's no habit too great there's nothing of this world too great there's no pull for the things of the world too great that my Jesus is not [Music] greater Verse 18 when she saw when Naomi saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking unto her amen so when discouragements and things listen as the word is coming the word comes to our life remember the word is come to lead Sons and Daughters to Liberty it's not come to lead the carnal mind it's not come to lead the flesh it's not come uh to somehow you know reform us no it's come to lead out Sons and Daughters of God so God like that in Egypt God allows the situations and conditions to get so bad to where the Fulfillment of the word that God originally spoke to Moses let my son go that he may serve me God will break down every hold every condition it doesn't matter what it is where the enemy feels like he's got a hold is nothing too great that he will not come down and break the hold over every son and every daughter of God yes sir y'all believe this right if you don't I do I'm a witness of this this is not a pipe dream this is a reality this is a reality I I did not come here to this morning of just some sort of a thought and what it could be as a matter of fact just to let you know I sat right back there to moments before I had walked out of here with two outlines in front of me where do I go this morning think of this now she came to a place of a decision sometimes when we look at with decisions remember the prophet was talking about how that when a decision is made he said it's like stones that come that then are to be cut and hued out for the service of the master and it takes the word to actually begin to shape that stone and work that stone because remember we are regarded as Lively stones that are to be fitted and divinely placed in the temple of the Living God every one of us have our own part peculiarities differences even the diversity of gifts even within our temperament and our makeup but yet every one of us to be a part of the body of Jesus Christ God knows all of that and where the spirit of God God comes down in the very midst of our life the prophet said he sets right in the midst and the middle of our temperament he takes away that old first nature that carnal nature that was enmity to God and he sets down of his divine nature and now it begins to move through the temperament in our life and give us Grace to overcome daily now the decision that's made think about a decision itself you know when we think about decision you know you can't set neutral you've got to make decisions you all the way through right here all through these verses I just read n Ruth had to make decision after decision you said brother samel she already made one decision but remember the word kept coming to her but she held the decision to the end I'm not going back don't try to stop me don't try to hinder me and there is nothing the Lord do any ought to me if there is anything anything but death that would separate us a decision and you know how important a decision is yes sir it'd be like you invite somebody over for dinner and they say we'll think about it you'd sit there and look at him and say well must have other stuff to do maybe you know maybe there's other things they got to think they got to consult their consult their wife they got to look for other things but you know when a decision to be made it's something that's to be made at that moment and it declares what you intend to do the prophet tells us in marriage of the Lamb that when when we make decisions we show our faith in God yes sir and let me just tell you how could those decisions be made unless God comes and energizes our faith that's right that's so good that's what that's that's why when as he's moving Among Us he's here to energize our faith right now watch this here what was the Holy Ghost given for let me just let me read this here to you Naomi tried to get Ruth to go back but she said your people are my people your God is my God and where you die there I'll die where you're buried there I'll be buried and I'll not turn back that's when a person has caught a vision don't make any difference what her people said you're going over there to become a Holy Roller or something that don't make any difference to Ruth there was a purpose of God to be fulfilled let me tell you something if there's anybody that Whispers in your ear and says well you'll be a fanatic look at their life I said look at their life do you want to be like them no I because usually the people that says you're going to be a fanatic they're trying to hold you back let me tell you something when you really serve God and you get out of your own mind you'll be considered a fanatic you'll be considered like Paul said a fool for Christ but whose fool are [Music] [Applause] [Music] you got all this regular lers going on and yet some of you would march to high heaven with all the regulations the government wants to put on oh bless God we're going to March the EPA we quit trying to put regulations on the Holy Ghost qu trying to regulate what he can do in your life Hallelujah let me just tell you something he's a gentleman he don't need us helping him out and how to control it let me just tell you something there's a lot of Fanatics in hell and they're for the wrong thing there's religious Fanatics in Hell business Fanatics hell's a real place everybody that leaves here does not go to heaven sorry preachers don't put you in heaven like I stood there and said yesterday we've stood in a lot of funerals and we've heard a lot of lies preachers don't put you in heaven there's only one mediator between God and man and that's the man Christ Jesus you got to make up your mind that you're either going to serve God or not like Joshua said if serving the lord seems evil to you you know what the word evil means well I would never regard evil if it refers to Grievous it's Grievous what he's asking me to do if it seems evil to you you choose this day that's nobody else if you let somebody else influence you look at their life oh brother Samuel they've been around the message for 50 years but if they have not moved one iota you have got the wrong example let me tell you something there is a flying eagle in our midst Jesus Christ the holy ghost that comes down and liberates lives changes lives and sets Hearts on Fire that's what he does he specializes in Taking Lives and making Saints out of them and then just so you understand a saint is not somebody who's perfect in themselves a saint is a Sanctified one been set aside by the spirit of God and filled with God's spirit and is a living Memorial of Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's so good yes sir that's a person that's caught a vision don't make any difference what her people said you're going over there to become a Holy Roller or something that didn't make any difference to Ruth there was a purpose of God to be fulfilled you know even like the prophet I I love to me I love the sovereignty of God when you study the God's sovereignty I love how the message just unfolds that cuz it's right there all the way through the scriptures of how the brother B say here he was he said you don't even know why but you staggered into that little mission that night and you made your way to the altar didn't really know all that was going on he said but there was your beginning some of you had your beginning in a charismatic church some of you had your beginning in a Catholic Church Catholic Church yeah because it was Jesus Christ that caught your attention but the the problem of it was is you got you got a catch of him and you said I ain't lodging here cuz he's moved on I'm going to go on where he's at and you didn't even know where to go you didn't know where to go but he knew where you were at and like that boy that he healed their eyes he came and found you and led you to himself I tell you you make a decision as God moves on your heart don't let listen to me the moment that God begins to deal with your heart there also a spirit of fear that'll want to creep up around you what are you going to do what's going to happen to you you might act this way your friends might say this that is a spirit of fear as a barrier that's wanting to hold you back from obedience to the voice of God but if you will pass through that barrier press through that barrier you will find the goodness and glory of God that will lead you on am H my my and just as sure as you're hungering same quote just as sure as you're hungering tonight for the holy spirit it's something in you pulling you that a purpose of God in your life has got to be fulfilled just like it was with Ruth so it wasn't a natural thing it wasn't Ruth that got caught up with ar rest she did not catch oers o i name bringing my mind just tired oers o I don't want to say Oprah orpa dear Lord no I don't want to Blas in the house of God orpa but you know she didn't catch or a spirit you got to be careful you don't want to catch one another's Spirit that's right are you hearing me it's important that you recognize God speaking to you don't look at what your neighbor is doing don't don't even look at what your wife is doing or your husband's doing God speaking personally to you there will be no excuses in hell if you say well my wife didn't go or my husband didn't go God will hold you accountable every man must give an account of his own soul he rise or falls to his own [Applause] Master but there's a pulsation on the inside and let me just tell you God won't push you and God won't pull you that's right it didn't say blessed is who years yields to my pooling blessed is he who who who who uh who who helps who allows me to push him that is not overcoming overcoming begins with a decision amen it's every day in our life come on friends even those of us that have already crossed over in the land you've got decisions to make when God's dealing with your life on things there's decisions to make oh brother Samuel it's just a small little baby those little baby amorites grow up to be like their daddies they got the same nature in them and the little things in your life you don't kill will eventually rise up and take away your faith that's how important it is that's why Israel got caught and they stumbled they allowed things to become common and they got the coup in at babies oh how cute it is oh it's innocent go baby looks innocent let it grow up it got the same DNA as his daddy right that's why you got to look at little things I don't care if it's sin and of this world it might be a little baby thing a little thing that you think oh that ain't harmless standing harmless let me tell you one little harmless thing will lead to another harmless thing lead to another harmless thing lead to another harmless thing it'll keep going until it overtakes you and takes the joy of the Lord out of your life don't ever get to thinking you're too big for God's grace to come down and humble you and walk in humility to the grace of God Hall don't worry I'm just trying to catch my breath how can I overcome brother BR says what are you struggling for so you can live what are you living for so you can die wouldn't it be most foolish if we didn't accept God's provision for eternal life what could we think about what could be on our mind that would attract our attention to anything what if you owned a100 million and you own the state of Indiana or any other state or even a nation as far as that concerned the entire world you live long enough you've got to come to that too and constantly day by day every time your heart beats you're going right straight to that you there's no winning for you you're on the losing side and you've got to lose but remember the promise he that'll lose his life amen for my sake you know life is a precious thing yes yes am you can waste it spend it or invested your choice your choice that's why the prophet could say in choosing of the Bride choice is a great thing a great thing so our choices we can't blame our decisions on nobody else right we can't well I you know I I walked I tell you what the reason I walked off I tell you we wouldn't be in the condition if I hadn't have had to walk off that job because of that boss don't blame it on that boss God could have been using that situation to temper you amen and you have to realize you need to stop running from your problems and recognize that your problem stares you in the mirror come on friends this is where let's just get right down to it a lot of times what it is we're so busy so interested in play blaming all of our shortcomings on everybody else well I got a bad attitude because of this no you got a bad attitude because you chose to have one amen well brother Samuel I've got a grudge because of this no you got a grudge because you chose to have one you have a choice is whether to not you're going to entertain the love of God and when you really get the love of God in your life and you have the love of God if something comes up it will be Lord I need more of your love because I don't want this in my life it's not of you and it will take my soul to hell you can have a justly ought against somebody but if you don't release that from your heart scripture Jesus said when you pray and you ask the father to forgive you if you haven't forgiven it'll be held against you that's exactly what he said I don't know about you but I want freedom I want freedom oh brother Samuel does that mean that there's not things that oh yeah sure there's plenty of things that come around my way but you know I don't sit here and evaluate what comes my way and put it on evaluate what comes around you we don't sit around and compare who's been offended the most because we've all frankly offended other people whether we know it or not Lord have mercy come on friends if we'll really look and consider some of the choices and decisions we have made in life there were no more about God than nothing we didn't seek God we didn't ask God we didn't ask for his leading didn't ask for his guidance we've made him brother Samuel you're talking to believers do you think Believers can't make wrong decisions I'm sure right here there's some of you that's made some wrong decisions and and probably said some things yesterday or the day before that you had to repent over and say Lord forgive me for saying it that way forgive me for that attitude forgive me for entertaining that thought remember David was an elect child of God it didn't keep him from making wrong decisions is that right so just because we're elect my we're just on autopilot no we have decisions to make this is why when the prophet got to is such a place I hope God gives me Grace I've studied on it for years on that whole part that he went through with about decisions and holding back and decisions and many of that has just opened up so wonderfully just waiting on the Lord to let me bring it but remember when the Holy Spirit told him and said why are you waiting on me to make the decision in other words I've already confirmed Divine Healing there needs not be no confirmation for that that has already been walk in it you don't need to pray and ask me do I need to pray for the sick I've already conf confirmed that are you with me amen but you see the prophet even began to hold back on that because he had developed a complex even a complex was hindering what God had already confirmed in his life but look what an example we had right with the Prophet The Prophet himself one of the things that you realize I think brother Brian referred to it on Thursday night with that with that uh that young man you know when he was was freed of that homosexual Spirit he he re raised up and remember what he said he he said I'm free I'm free he confessed that thing and got that right out in the open and one of the things that you find that even as brother R he didn't have to do that in front of all of us as a people and on tape tell me which one of us would have done that which one of you which which one of us would have got up and just announced it to everybody and said hey everybody in this church I want you to know I got a complex because I don't feel like I get to sing or I get to called as much as any nobody else but he got up and why did he do that to draw attention to himself no you know why he did that I believe God moved him to do that so that you and I could be able to relate and see as the prophet would say it service after service after service on past then it's so easy to build a complex and you know what a complex is a way of thinking about something is that right it's a way of thinking Lord have mercy but it's being honest and God can come down and speak to our hearts look at this he that'll lose his life for my sake shall find it Lord for his sake that's what we want our lives to be taken with because you see how how many of us have been to funeral services and things and you heard things this person was old they were great down at the uh you know the Garden Club and they were great here sometimes there's just so many great works of humanity where people have so given their lives oh they were the top of the booster club they fought for the kids they did they were right there to fight the wrongdoing on the workplace that's a trap the Bible says no man that Warth entangleth himself that's right not oh the Devil May no no no man who Warth entangleth himself with the Affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a good soldier see traps can come traps can come our way and what's you're trying to do take us away from the source of life that is there to change us try to get our Focus off on other things but watch he that'll lose his life for my sake you know it doesn't matter what what I would have at the bottom I I believe I'm going to I'm going in the Rapture I believe I'm going to see my loved ones I believe I'm going to be changed I believe I'm going to be alive and remain I'm pressing towards that Hallelujah I'm pressing towards that if there if it would happen to come an obituary and something would be read I don't want age of this life he was good at this good at that I want one thing to be said that he loved the Lord Jesus Christ better than he loved his own life he loved the Lord better than he loved his own reputation that's what I want to be said he that will lose his life for my sake shall find it now what would be in any more of a treasure than to find that life though you found the whole world to be yours but if you find life you found the greatest thing that could be found that's so good that's a witness right watch this how the prophet says this here Ruth was willing out of redeem and Redemption Ruth was willing everybody say willing to forsake her Idols well brother Samuel I was you know I've been raised around the message I don't have no Idols remember what the prophet tells us in Corinthians book of Corrections he picks up Corinthians chapter 10 where it speaks to them and says as those who sat down underneath the mountain while Moses went up and they begin to rise up and play and it says neither be ye idolators as some of them who begin to rise up and play and the prophet takes that scripture and he says now idolators he said to worship an idol doesn't Al to altogether mean that it's an image he said you can be i dle e Idol like a car that's just idling at a stop so this is no Wonder in the scripture cuz you see how sometimes we can read in the scriptures that don't ain't me ain't me I ain't no idolator praise God I've been called out of the earth of Calis but anything you keep in your life and will bow down to it when pressure comes situations come and you go back into your way and mode of acting about things that is reminiscent of your childhood let me tell you that's why you need the spirit of God to take care of you to take that out of you so you don't all of a sudden go back and relapse as it was when your days of childhood and it was in your days of high school oh no you may not throw yourself on the floor and throw a fit but you'll throw a fit for everybody else and pout on everybody else and try to ruin everybody else's time though you're not intentionally or even mindfully trying to do that but why is that that's cuz somebody didn't take you up and wear out your high in the beginning absolutely that's right that's exactly right and look what how look what kind of inservice it does you even right now it causes you to think that everybody on the job's against you it causes you to think that if somebody don't look at you in the right way that they're against you you know what it is listen friends listen don't L me back oh if I had a real daddy if I had a real mama there is a parent in the house here this morning there is a parent that is able to come down and move through every channel of your life where everything has been and the scars and the molding there is a great physician Hallelujah Hall that can go down and mend the broken heart that can heal Brokenness that can deal with scars that might still be wounds in your life things that the enemy wants to pick when the spirit of God begins to move and come around in your life and set this up before you what should I do say get out of my way get out of my way you have been in my way long enough I have prostrated before you long enough this excuse this Idol you are not going to steal what God is speaking to me she was willing to forsake her Idols let me tell you something every one of us and I'm not going to say this to make you laugh but I'm saying it to make you think in Charlie Brown they had a man a little boy by the name of lias he want lonus he walked around with his blanket his blanket was something he walk around with it and he carried it everywhere he went it was his safety blanket do you realize sometimes the things that we're packing around our safety blankets our ways when things don't go right when seems like sometime oh I I failed in this area and we run right back into the same things you need to burn those bridges you need to burn those bridges I don't know who it was somebody just told me here not too long go here this past week I don't remember who it was but there was a famous General that when he would come and bring his troops in he would go back he would tell them you burn every bridge behind us cuz there's no retreat I tell you that's what we ought to say Jesus send the fire of the Holy Ghost Lord burn every bridge Lord burn every idea burn every Idol burn everything Lord H I don't want no excuses in my life Lord Hall Lord have mercy she had to forsake her past life right now that may not seem like too much to you CU you could say well she wasn't a Rahab oh but she was born a moabit her past life carried with it a very negative connotation your first birth and my first birth carries a very negative connotation oh brother Samuel they could not even enter in to the house of God until so many generations that's right and you know what you and I could never have entered into Christ outside of Christ come to us and bring us into him amen she was willing to forsake her past let me just tell you this if you allow the devil to keep you in your past it's your fault but I I've come here with a word here this morning I had no idea this was going to go this way I've got a lot in front of me but I had no idea this is going to go this way I told you I had two different
