word of prayer we got a need on your heart just let it be known before the lord this morning he's mindful he said in his word where two or three are gathered together in my name i'll be in their midst the one who's able to do something and who desires to do something for your need he's here he's here heavenly father lord we recognize we're not in the presence of a man we're in the presence of almighty god lord you're the same god [Music] every need that was ever placed before your children that of the greatest need salvation and every other need that would arise in the journey there were always opportunities that you would make known your faithfulness and make known your presence lord we just asked this morning it just the lord resides in our hearts we just we just believe i pray lord that you would help us because beneath the lord these hands and upon the hearts there's knees there's situations there's questions lord we know that the enemy would set forth to battle but we're not looking at him we're looking to you who made the promise you're the one lord who comes and increases our might you're the one who comes to them who have no strength and you give strength the lord so father our desire is not to act upon our own but to wait on you lord to wait in your word we lift up our eyes we look to you this morning we look beyond our need beyond our situation and we look to the same lord jesus we ask that god that you would just move among us this morning lord as we open the word that's all we can do we can open our bibles but god we need you to open open the word to us personally we need you to depart the waters we need you lord we just asked that you would come almighty god help me to step aside the congregation together lord may you just come and speak perform your word in our lives i pray this morning we're a very blessed people lord [Music] i i don't even feel like thank you is enough words but i love you papa [Music] i love you appreciate your mercy and your grace appreciate your leadership and your work and our lives [Music] oh god we thank you lord jesus [Music] we are blessed oh god [Music] we just commit lord this service remaining part into your hands our lives with it lord in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you this morning if you would turn with me to zechariah chapter 12. so good to see each and every one of you different ones victor it's good to see you very good to see you and there's someone else mr carmen and let me see back there matthew michael good to see you matthew i think you've grown more maybe covered 19 meant you grew 19 more inches you're a good-looking young man michael you are too praise the lord zechariah chapter 12 verse 8 and just look to the lord right now he would just just direct us here i want to just move into that on verse 8. the scripture says in that day shall the lord defend the inhabitants of jerusalem and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as david and the house of david shall be as god as the angel the lord before them and it shall come to pass in that day but i will seek to destroy all the nations that come against jerusalem and i will pour upon the house of david and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications that's the baptism of the holy ghost it's the same holy ghost that god has poured out upon the gentiles and israel receiving their day of visitation but we see the parallel of his working in our life he's the one who defends us are you with me he's defending his word and our protection it's in him and they shall look upon him whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn we've moved to verse 1 of zechariah 13. in that day there shall be a fountain not a cistern not a man-made source of water not a place that's depending on local revivals where the water washes down all off the roof all the dirt and the grime and how many of you ever had a cistern growing up we did i was glad when we moved to sandusky i remember turning on the water green bugs coming out i remember that it was a cistern and i also remember at times when there was a drought we had to call for somebody else to come bring water and fill that tank because if it didn't rain and wash off the water into there then we had no water but this is a fountain he opens yes this is god fulfilling his word you know he said in his word if any man believeth on me as the scripture has said aren't you glad he opens your eyes to what the scriptures really are saying he opens the way to the living waters and when he opens that fountain then out of your belly it's not just a fountain that's that's as though it's out here no he brings that fountain of life within you like brother branham standing at that bubbling brook and said what is it that makes you bubble i stood there just the other day what makes you bubble hallelujah it's something behind me amen water's coming out so deep one of the brothers told me in that water he said i've stuck he said i said down in there he said a real long stick a pole he said nine ten foot he said it still would not reach the bottom which is like a little hole but there's precious water it's cold it's refreshing you can drink from that water i'm glad that there's a fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins where sinners plunge beneath the flood lose all their guilty stance this is that fountain in that day shall there shall be a fountain opened to the house of david and to the inhabitants of jerusalem notice it's not just for everybody it's for those in whom it's intended for for sin and for uncleanness let me just follow this up that part of it when i just said it's not for everybody although the preaching of this gospel it goes to all it's put before every man a decision that they must make will you come to these waters it's open to all brother branham would preach christ the mystery said oh i hope you just don't think this is just to this little group of people he said it's to everybody if they will receive isn't that powerful all you have to do is receive it how do i receive it believe it say amen be it unto me and it shall come to pass in that day sayeth the lord of hosts that i will cut off the names of the idols out of the land and they shall no more be remembered and also i will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land may god bless you bless the reading of his word as you're being seated so as we are looking here in the word of god and just looking at this thought that is just so much here just upon my heart there's just been so many things we'll say within the past year and a half almost two years just so much of and just waiting on the lord and god just dealing with things on my heart just seeing this of the time where we're at and the parallel of god working with with israel and to keep in mind that what what god how god has dealt even with israel in that of the election through his sovereign grace it's the same god who works in our life by his sovereign grace and so when we we look at this here in the scriptures it speaks of how that god would make make known or to those who would be thought of as feeble god in that day will make them as david and remember david was not the choice or seemingly the one that would be chosen to be king his stature was not a stature that would be something that they would be able to put faith in his stature remember they had god had given them a king that in stature matched the other kings of the nation but god as the scripture is so clear to guide you and i and i believe it is within every part in his word and every part of our life that that god is letting us know that we do not see things as god sees it there's things that we would pass over sometimes even it might be a scripture you might even be looking at what you're reading in in your devotion it can be even what is read for a text and you might look over it and say how is that going to minister to my need but you see god is the god of his word and he knows exactly how to minister to our needs right on time you see this is an hour this is a time where um the god of this evil age satan is exalted to the throne of worship in man his wisdom knowledge the bible tells us in the book of daniel prophesying even of this time that knowledge shall increase the wisdom of man how would so increase and we can look at all that and there's certain things that we say my i'm glad you know this convenience or i'm glad this convenience or i'm glad this convenience there's certain things that we've benefited from the knowledge increasing but yet within it all this is where we we we we must uh reside in our hearts to recognize that it's not upon knowledge and wisdom by which we know god or can even figure out his word or even that of our own lives but it comes down to it's god coming and faith is what brings him on the scene and god god has a way through his word to where he comes and to even that that would try to figure him out and try to put a pathway for him to come god just comes in a manner that it defies all odds it defies the very wisdom and the counsel of man because god's counsel his thoughts are higher than our thoughts and so i believe the prayer from my heart would not be that god you come according to our thoughts i don't believe that's the desire here and i believe that we can change in our hearts so align it and say god let your thoughts be my thoughts lord lift me into your thoughts because i can tell you his thoughts are not based on the reasonings of can you or can't you his thoughts are i am the lord and there's no one else beside me his thoughts lifting into his thoughts it brings faith in our lives it brings something in our life that even that we stand in amazement and what is moving in our life why because that is the supernatural god he overrides all reasoning and all the the elements of man and he displays himself that he is the living god they that are feeble shall be as david this reality that we read of here in the scripture that is made available to us through and by the blood of the lord jesus christ where he would make a way that that same life that was there in the blood that brought our lord and savior to earth and he gave his life that same god who dwelled in that body it was for a purpose that he might make real to you and i that i have already redeemed you it was his desire to make that real because when you recognize you're redeemed you recognize the power and the whole that was upon your life it is broken and you have been brought back to whom you really belong to and who you always were hallelujah through the simplicity god veils himself in simplicity in looking at the word when the word is coming to pass it moves from just a written word that is a promise and it becomes a living fountain it becomes a reality it becomes that of god himself taking on the form of his word and as you yield to that word he's calling you to yield to it oh glory be to god as you yield to it it's his strength his power that's in work that's bringing you and releasing the hold of the enemy from upon your life brother and sister at church can't do that a man can't do that there's only one that can do that and let me just announce to you he's already done it recognize that a heart that desires to be free when that freedom and sound of jubilee begins to ring in their heart there's not enough devils out of hell that can hold them back hallelujah there's a purging that takes place this fountain cleanses he just don't forgive but the real depths of god's forgiveness it's a purging of the conscience of purging what i'm speaking of is the soul it's that word that is sprinkled there has a pure water upon the conscience it's god that brings a change to where he removes that to where there's no more desire amen amen is god's working and this is what god makes known to do to israel during that time as the bride is taken in rapture at the marriage supper of the lamb and he slips away from the marriage supper of the lamb because there's got to be an appointment you know how it is when you're at a wedding supper and i don't want to dwell upon this so much this morning but you know how it is you know everybody is anxious you you're there you know and and and when thank goodness the carnality doesn't go over there right thank goodness we're not waiting on oh do they get all their pictures taken we're starving to death i wish they thank god that carnality doesn't go over there are you with me but we shall sit down and the bible said he will wipe away not send somebody else to do it he will come and wipe away every tear brother samuel i don't understand that how am i going to have memories of victory and my brothers and sisters and yet he'll remove away all of that of the memories of all the failures and the memories of this one didn't make it or that one did how does he do that it's a paradox [Music] the same way that he moves in your life now it's a continuation of his power over there but after you get done here as things are winding up and you know how it is with a wedding supper you start going around and you're fellowshipping with different ones he slips away at that time all the nations are they're gathering in because remember satan is cast out when the bride goes up in rapture and the bible says wall to the inhabitants of the earth in that time for love the devil has come down to you so here he is and the bible said he know that he has but a short time he's going throughout the earth think of it he's going and assembling those nations that to come against israel and and frankly they're all against israel god has given a grace even in this hour let me tell you and this is not putting our president up but let me just tell you it couldn't have been a politician in the white house jerusalem had to be recognized as the capital of jerusalem let me just tell you god in this hour when men were promoting churches and creeds and ideas and all sorts of things god anointed a word of promise a man with his spirit that was able to declare and point back to you and i the real chosen place of worship that you and i might have real liberty and to recognize that the name of the lord jesus christ is not just a name it is a life of a person who is the way the truth and the life it took eyes to reveal that way and to say this is my beloved son hear ye him [Applause] we're standing there on mount transfiguration we've received hear you him moses and elijah is to speak to the 144 thousand hear him this is the one and then walking off of the mountain right into the millennium so close i say glory be to god hallelujah let me just tell you the greatest privilege we just don't know about the promise we are called into this promise by this promise to become this promise and that this promise might be made manifest through our mortal bodies [Applause] hallelujah he slips away and he comes to make himself known to the 144 thousand remember moses and elijah have been preaching revelations 11 they have been preaching the same characteristics of their ministry that was in the old testament follows in this same characteristics they try to take them fire issues out they try to take them you see the enemy cannot touch them until god has finished with them until they have finished their testimony let me just tell you something there's not a devil of cancer there's not a devil that can take you until god's purpose has been fulfilled in your life because this word this message brother and sister it's a written expression of god's life inside of your eye hallelujah it's the same holy ghost riding betrayal again in the life of the believer it's a proof of the testimony of jesus christ in the midst of his children i am the same god i am the same yesterday today and forever i change not i'm the same god who part of the red seas and the same god who made a way through the jordan i am that i am the same god [Music] hallelujah that's why the devil's trying that's why he's been after israel trying to destroy him because if he can destroy him and write wipe them out then there is he can say there's a promise that god has not been able to keep this is why the enemy has been hot on your trail this is why you find situations arising and that arise but remember the enemy can do nothing except god give him permission and if god gives him permission it is an opportunity for god to step down and display his glory and his power and to declare this is my child this is my son this is my daughter you've gone far enough [Applause] they come to know under that ministry of the two witnesses they come to know his mighty power his mighty acts of salvation it becomes personal to them what they themselves cannot understand becomes personal to them they see themselves in the word are you catching the parallel it's god directing you and i that we might see ourselves in the word and we can see ourselves in the word that god is keeping his word it gives us strength to stand upon the promises of god and say the same god that has kept this word he's the same he's god of his word he'll keep every word what does it do it builds genuine faith in the word of god my mama i feel like preaching a little bit thank you lord glory to jesus zechariah 10 1 ascii of the lord reign in the time of the latter rain god makes known his seasons then we can ask for what he desires for us to ask for remember he cannot do anything unless we first ask for it but it takes him to alert us to what we must ask for and to give us faith to ask for that to believe that's for me so the lord shall make bright clouds and give them showers of rain to every one grass in the field for the idols have spoken vanity and the diviners have seen a lie and have told false dreams they comfort in vain therefore they went their way as a flock they were troubled because there was no shepherd mine anger was kindled against the shepherds and i punished the goats for the lord of hosts hath visited his flock the house of judah and hath made them you catch this he has visited them who his flock the house of judah you know why god has visited you because you belong to him me god visited me in the condition where i was at in the pigpen god visited me god visited you not because of the condition we were in but because of what was beneath the darkness of our life promises of the programs of man will make you a better guy we'll make you a more moral man we'll do all this all of those things fail they can make a person a good moral person which i think anybody would want to have a good moral person in their neighborhood we would applaud that especially in this hour but that is not salvation religion is the works of man it's only a covering to try to cover up what the real issue is that needs to be dealt with but salvation is of the lord he comes to save his own he sends his word he visits our lives never forget when god was dealing with my heart god was visiting my life visiting me in dreams visiting me brother samuel did it turn you around no i was still running i was still going the way i was going but he was visiting me he knows what he's doing i guarantee you one thing my mom and dad it would have looked like i don't doubt for a moment the devil didn't tell them look at god and even hearing your prayers you're going completely the opposite way look at him he's worse off now than he's ever been but brother they had confidence because there was a token applied in their own life and they knew what a rascal and a stinker that they were as well i don't care how kind of a goody two shoes that they were i love you mama i don't care what they were and everything they can rely upon brother they knew that they had to have jesus christ the power of god to change their life and they held to that same power and said god what you did for me you do it for sam your lord you'll change his life you'll transform his life what was that that was there moving and saying pour out the latter rain deal with his life he have visited them and have made them as his goodly horse in the battle my lord my lord hallelujah you take a horse and you look back at its pedigree and you see this horse and they look back through the line oh it's stubborn it's this it's that they bring it out to the auctions like they do down in mount hope in amish country on the front on on on on friday mornings and they walk them horses around there you know the amish people they don't they don't buy them scallywag horses the horses you pass by are thoroughbreds those horses have been many times on race tracks are you with me they ain't just buying some horse and say i think this horse can pull me i think this horse will be all right you know what they want to see they want to see the character they want to see the pedigree let me just tell you something our first family tree did not have much of a pedigree to offer but he was able to look and see that sea that he planted on the inside and say in that seat brother there's papers there's papers that go along with that seed all it needs is the seed of life to raise that into an expression of a divine pedigree as a son and daughter of god amen that's why god that's why god has visited your life hallelujah not an accident it's purposeful [Applause] the devil tried to tell you you're here for nothing or you don't understand this and you don't understand this you just look at that devil and you say shut your mouth i didn't bring myself here i may not understand everything but i know that god has spoke to my heart i know that god is dealing with my life and he that becomes the good work shall perform it until the day of jesus christ verse 4 out of him this is jehovah genre this is our provider out of him i look for a man but there was no man to help me i looked who is able i'm looking who is able who's able to bring redemption who's able to bring on the resurrection and the rapture who's able and i looked no man was worthy but out of him out of the throne step the lamb [Music] out of him god is jehovah jireh abraham where did this ram come from the lord provided for himself out of him brother out of this word when you've got needs in your life you know how it is when you've got needs you got situations and you find when you're looking at it out of the word here we will step forward and make himself known out of him came forth the corner the foundation stone the rock on which you're positioned this rock that he said he had set you up on you know brother adam you couldn't climb up there are you following me now you can't climb up there god has to put a man up there [Music] what god has done for the messenger the same god has put you and i on the rock of divine revelation men have tried to climb this great mountain but god himself is the one who translates us who puts us who places us upon a sure foundation and what is that place he positions us it's in himself in divine love what brought you from where you were loved what drew you who would have invited you who would have spoke to you who would have had any dealings with you god his love and he called you cleaned you up and transformed you for what that by his love working in your life it would produce a faith and a confidence in him what are you resting in his workmanship out of him oh my this is a this is one of those scriptures like others it's like a ch a can of juice concentrate mixing it up out of him comes forth the corner out of him comes forth the nail you know the bible speaks in isaiah 22 about the nail ezra when they come back in the land say he hath given us a nail you know what a nail is for to fasten you to something and notice he has given his life his life through him by redemption that what that you and i are not separate separated from the word of our true identity but it is him that fastens us up unites us plants us positions us in him out of him comes forth the nail hallelujah i'm nailed in tied in tangled up shut in with jesus but sammy you're you're in a cocoon yeah i'm in him now remember what takes place in him is a mystery he had an old ugly caterpillar comes in but once that cocoon is opened up at the appointed time out comes forth a beautiful butterfly you understand creation testifies of the power of his godhead [Applause] creation nature testifies of the true witness look sometimes to a tree i mean did anybody in their yard like a tree that doesn't have leaves on it you look out there and say that tr you don't look at them and say in that a beautiful tree honey in the bark nights with all that moss over it there's no leaves on the tree not one of you say that but what you start looking at is saying you know what i think we need to get rid of that right but in the wintertime you know looking at that tree you know it's only a matter of time until life comes back up in the roots the life will come to the roots and bring forth that of the leaves and then you'll stand there once again once the winter of death has passed you'll see the resurrection of the spring you see the height of the summer and then the fall itself will tell of the fall death sets in but then light comes back it's all a testimony of the true witness of jesus christ all nature testifies of the power of his godhead out of him the battle bowl out of him the battle bowler it is him who breaks the bow when that of the millennium in the beginning and here preparing for that the bible says he will beat their beat their swords into plowshares war will be broken from around the earth the bible says that the earth land sea and sky will be filled with the knowledge of the lord amen and there will be peace as he sets on us on the throne of david the same way it is that he breaks the battle bowl out of your soul our own soul and nature was enmity against god even trying to perform religious acts it's enmity against god what must i do except what he has already provided and he's the one that will come and do away with the enmity and strife he'll put peace in your soul come unto me all you that are heavy laden and i will give you rest for your soul this is what god's peace does in your life it transforms your life he is our peace who's broken down every wall he breaks the battle he breaks hallelujah and the bible says here notice this working out of him every oppressor together what's the oppressor one that could walk through the land and say one who oppresses and he said i will break out the oppressor god deals with the one who says i can't get free of this you know what kind of life i live you know what kind of life you recognize that there's hearts that cry out even right now that say god i want to be free i don't want to be driven to do these things let me just tell you legion was crying out that way it was not his mouth it was that seed on the inside you would never have looked at legion you'd have been destined to get preachers to go around him and the community but rather the difference was when jesus came there was something down on the inside faith coming by hearing [Music] the prophet said there wasn't enough devils that could keep him back do you see the power of responding to the call that's going forth within you he calls brother there's gotta be something to catch that call there's something or day to catch that call to catch that ring of freedom [Music] but after he met jesus he went back a different man i'd say there were people still running from him but when he walked in the house that day his family knew something's different something's happened to daddy let me just tell you something it's a difference when you don't have to tell nobody it's a difference where you don't have to be you just are in liberty to be who you always really were he set you free are you hearing me this morning he sets you free he sets the captive free and verse 5 and they shall be as a mighty men which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle and they shall fight because the lord is with them and the riders the powers that are on horses shall be confounded and i will strengthen the house of judah notice i will strengthen i will save the house of joseph i will bring upon that i will bring them again to place them for i have mercy upon them and they shall be as though i had not cast them off amen what a paradox to be able to so deal with the past in your life to where it is such a paradox you can say well i know i you know those things that were done but that's not me that's not who i am that's not who i am and yet a person can say oh no no no samuel i remember i remember when you used to do this i remember when you used to do this but you see it's not this that's been changed yet it's this on the inside in the temple there's new ownership that's moved on the inside i didn't change my habits he changed my nature there's new habits that come with a new nature there's a different wall that comes with a new nature what does that his spirit of grace that is poured out upon my life it causes me to ask it causes me to desire his grace for my life oh glory be to god i stood right here we didn't own this church at the time i stood right here sure i had already been baptized once i was how was that mom 10 11 i remember this time you didn't have to be baptized again yeah i know but you know what there was something that god had done in my life that i had a real understanding of it yes it wasn't just something that i had just went along and had just done i wasn't just doing something careless before but you understand i stood right here from where god had just brought a man from some weeks back a man that had said i can never stop doing this i don't i can't stop doing that i can't stop doing this and i was standing right here and i remember as i testified some of you were here a few people we were on here on a saturday and i said if they would have asked me or somebody told me a few weeks ago you'll be standing here and you'll be walking into the waters of baptism your life you will have turned over to the lord i said it i said i would have said you're crazy even though god was dealing with my life it shows you the paradox of his power i didn't know what was taking place brother aaron i didn't know why he was visiting me in dreams why were the things he was pointing out in my life why were the things that he was taking out desires i didn't know what was going on but i'm just here to tell you it was a paradox and it's still a paradox can you explain it i cannot explain it but i know what he has done [Applause] let me just tell you right now those of you praying for your children you don't got to look nowhere else you can look god put a testimony before you of of an individual who was running completely the opposite way who even the people of the world had given up on he'll be nothing and you know what if it had not been for the mercy of jesus christ that's exactly right i may not even be alive on the earth today for the life than where it was going but god who is rich and mercy me just tell you mom and dad you might think they're going 100 miles an hour the other way what should i do you keep praying all the more you're not walking by sight you walk by pay it's a paradox of his power hallelujah oh glory be to god hallelujah hallelujah and they shall be as though i had not cast them off you understand what that means brother aaron you're not walking around someone well i'm not worthy i'm not worthy it's true there is not one of us who were worthy but he has made us worthy there's nothing you and i could ask for but you know what he has given us faith and a confidence to ask for what rightfully belongs to your eye let me just tell you something he wants to give you the holy ghost more than you want to receive it it belongs to you he made a way that you could have it amen hallelujah and the same one who sent the lord jesus the same one who moved back and rolled back the waters is the same god here this morning to roll back and park the waters of unbelief the waters of doubt [Applause] he's the same god i am the lord their god and will hear them and they of ephraim shall be like a mighty man did you catch what this is saying shall be as mighty men hallelujah not that they are mighty men not that we are mighty people it's not a mighty people it's a mighty god in his people it's not mighty men and women it's a mighty god wrapping his life in our lives i want to remind you paul would call the attention to the corinthians he would let them know you said you see after your calling there's not many who are noble rich or mighty who are called but god had chosen the outcast the weak that which the world or anybody else could say that one but god looketh not as i see god looks on the heart when god chose david he saw a place a heart where he could be a great big god he that is feeble shall be as david god calls the weak listen to me now listen but what gets in the way pride three temptations lust of i lust the flesh and the pride of life pride will keep back that which is weak from surrendering their weakness they'll keep their weakness and say well i can't do this because of this and i've got this and i've got that and i've got this but when you're ready you might say i am a nobody no no when you're ready to really become a nobody not in pride hide behind your weaknesses well i can't do this and i can't do that but when you're willing to become weak to become a nobody then god says that's an empty vessel that's a vessel that the rest could say that's a frail weak earthen vessel but god said that's where i put my power [Applause] and your life now this wine is better than the first wine are you here this life the life i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me it's a different life and god takes weakness let's just face it we all have pride right right we all deal with pride that's that that that's part of the pedigree of the first birth and the and the new birth raises us into a place to give authority and dominion and very important spiritual discernment to array to recognize the encroachment of the enemy to try to hinder god from working in our lives let me just verse 8. i love this i will hiss for them i will hiss for them that word hiss means i will pipe or i will whistle there'll be a melody that i will call for them with hallelujah you know god's gonna finish that song of moses are you with me god's gonna finish that song of moses because in that song of moses is also the mystery of the song of the lamb come on now it's a song what is a song it's melody it's where the word that comes forth by divine arrangement by the composer himself there are lives and hearts upon the earth that are part of the symphony of the word that's to be acted out and the word calls for you and it begins to perform through your life i will hiss for them hey the rest of the world sees israel they've been watching israel go back there's even people that you know they are pointing out different things about it let me just tell you the grace of god has come to you and i yeah to recognize what it's about to recognize this is our final it's the final visitation to the gentiles is to get us to recognize bringing us in order and preparation for the rapture because the rapture is on amen are you with me the rapture is on the bible says there that the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout he's already he's in his dissension [Applause] he sent forth a shout what is the shout the bread of life the message get under the blood get the holy ghost [Applause] he is our staff of life he does all three while he's descending just as the seventh seal the opening of the seventh seal is the coming of the lord but remember in the coming of the lord he's to come in bright form he's to come catch away his bride he's to come is that right he's to come and catch away his bride he's to come also and he's to anoint the two witnesses that'll go forth to israel is that right what is that that's all part of the coming of the lord all of those things shaping up this is why this is the beginning of the end what a beautiful day i say what a beautiful day will gather them let me try to finish this for i have redeemed them you know he already redeemed him on calvary before i ever was standing here before i ever was kneeling in brother bill's basement before he ever filled me with the holy ghost i was already redeemed i was already you know what he was doing he was calling me into the place of redemption and what the holy ghost does remember his work listen to me now his work of you even believing on him as your lord and savior is a work of redemptive power but there's more power and then he comes to do what clean up your life what is it more working of his redemptive power and what does it do it's to build faith that he himself might step inside of you and make his known in you and through you his power he that is feeble shall be as david are you with me egypt was a mighty nation israel was in bondage they were in egypt was a mighty nation they had power over israel but god didn't raise up the amorites or another nation to come over and destroy him god could have taken another army that would have been similar you could have maybe matched up a little bit better god wasn't trying to match up with their earthly military wisdom power amen but here god said i'm going to come and do this in simplicity how are you going to come i'll come in the form of a runaway prophet [Music] [Applause] i'll come in one who's been running from it that recognized his strength and knowledge of the word cannot deliver him amen but when he met god god stepped inside hallelujah it was not moses it was god in moses i have come down to deliver them god anointed his prophet with the word what was the word to do it was to announce judgment on egypt and proclaim liberty to israel the heart of the message was let my son go that he might serve me all the acts of power that were displayed was to build faith not in pharaoh it hardened his heart but it was to build faith in the hearts of israel for that exodus night god by his grace would send a prophet with a pillar of fire vindicated word you call this a great army god's backing him up are you with me god is backing him up god let him out and brought him to a place where the enemy thought he had him but what the enemy didn't know you've been suckered you've been fooled this is an ambush that's set for you he didn't know but that day was his last day what israel didn't know was that day there'll be no more cries of the tax masters over you god took the situation to do what swallow up all of that which was after them brother let me tell you something the devil can't follow you through the blood [Music] he can't make it amen because if he could he'd be your brother he can't make it he can try to send impersonation but he can't make it you couldn't have made it either but god passed you safely to the other shore [Applause] god has placed you in a position where you're not running and looking back over your back you are not the tail you were made to be the head god has given you authority god has pointed out if you only look on the shores of your life he'll show you those dead egyptians those task masters that i want to run you down those task masters whip you and put you this reminds you this and that he'll show you they are dead the paradox of his power can i have just a few more moments i will sow them notice and they shall increase as they have increased i will sow them among the people they shall remember me in far countries and they shall live with their children and turn again israel was dispersed after the rejection of messiah sprinkled here yeah here here i asked you a question were they loved in those other countries not at all they weren't loved they're hated even now you take in europe they have to have the guards outside of their schools in europe but you know what god permits that you know why they got to get back into their land god permits things to arise if god had left you or me in our comfort zone brother think about where we would have been but god started removing things around us he starts dealing with our life why he's got to get us in place and he's doing it no matter how you try to resist it he's doing it hallelujah hallelujah and i will bring them again also out of the land of egypt i will gather them out of assyria i'll bring them into the land of gilead and lebanon and place shall not be found for them and he shall pass through the sea with affliction and shall smite the waves and the sea and all the depths of the river shall dry up and the pride of assyria shall be brought down and the scepter of egypt shall depart away god is speaking of bringing israel back home remember he said i will hiss for them the rest of the world is caught up with their music are you with me the bride also has a music that she has caught up with it's singing a new song out of your life are you singing a new song is there a new song being sung out of your life if it's not let the lord who is the lord of my strength and my song let him become your song but the rest of the world is going with their music remember they're following you're following somebody they're following they've got the temple of rock and roll they're following the run and one and from them who is a witch bewitching them with what traditions and ideology and creeds of man decked with crosses appearing to be holy but administering doctrine that denies the power of a living lord jesus christ in the heart of a believer but we are not following cunning devised fables of men we've been called like israel remember israel has been summoned there's been a call that's been going on the angel of the lord the same time that god made himself known to his prophet there the same time israel becomes a nation the angel of the lord getting things in order getting things together let me just tell you something that sound is going forth that sounds just like sound waves are passing through this room this morning there are all kinds of waves that are going through here the only way you'll know what waves are going through here you must have something that's able to pick up that wave which is invisible and able to process that signal and brother there's no way our ears our eyes or anything about us it's able to catch or process the signal of god but there's a seed that god put on the inside it's tuned in to a certain frequency you didn't know it but you had a certain sim card in your life you were already identified with a certain network your your sim card would not work with another network young people know what i'm talking about i'm talking about your little chip that you got in your phone the little thing that you know they said this is a verizon only phone this is an att only phone let me just tell you something there was a sim card on the inside of your life that was already programmed ordained by almighty god to bear the characteristic of jesus christ in his word in this hour and the spirit of god from the ascending tower it sent out a signal and what did it do it began to call to you and there's something that began to rise up within your life you didn't even know what was taking place you could not even explain it what was it it was god calling you home it was a signal from the control tower [Applause] mama eagle knew where that little one was [Music] she never lost track of the one who was in the nest but mama eagle came flying over she began to cry out [Applause] that little eagle thought he was a chicken tried to act like a chicken tried to do everything the rest of the chickens he tried to fit in he tried to eat worms with the rest of them you know why he was trying to fit in he did the things they did he was trying to fit in but if he only could see who he was [Music] he never was a chicken he was always an eagle it took one of his kind to passover you know what's happening his eyes are being turned from the barnyard you're getting dizzy i'm locked on i can't even get my eyes off this and then something as it screams out myself mama [Music] [Applause] how do i get out of here mama jump jump jump comes on the fence post mama i'm up a little higher son i want to take you higher i want to take you into position i'm going to take you into place what what i do from here mama spread your wings and he began to spread his wings he began to look oh my goodness it's just like mama's wings it's just like mama's wings and about that time mama what i do from here just jump son the wind is here to catch you that same wind of the holy ghost that fell in the upper room is here this morning what do i do jump jump he's there to pack you from death unto life [Applause] hallelujah this gathering disassembly has god bringing us and drawing us to himself as he said concerning israel so has he done the same for you and i am amen i will say to the north give up my sons give up my daughters are you with me you've got the spirit of god inside of you and lay claim on your children these are promises in god's word oh i don't know if they're going to make it you cast that devil out well brother simon you know if they're predestinated to make it you claim them you claim your loved ones don't look at the condition they're in but say lord jesus as you got a hold of my life lord get ahold of their life lord let me just tell you they might have to pass through the sea they might have to pass through a lot of affliction but what he said i'll be with you god won't lose one [Music] [Applause] it's a paradox of his power i will strengthen them verse 12 i will strengthen them in the lord and they shall walk up and down in his name saith the lord he that is feeble shall be as david amen what did god tell he speaks this is this is god speaking to israel in the book of job when god speaks in many places in the old testament of israel coming back into their land he speaks of them as they are dead but he said i will bring them to life in ezekiel the valley of dry bones in the book of isaiah thy dead men shall live you who were dead in sin in trespasses has he quickened and this is where the testimony comes out we say that in confession to the lord let the weak say i am strong that scripture it comes right at the end of scriptures right before it in the book of joel that speak of beating the swords into plowshares letting the weak say i'm strong is not a scripture for the millennium it's a scripture heading into it where israel can say i am strong where you can say i am strong i can do all things through christ who strengthens me be strong in the lord and in the power of his might our lord jesus the bible says crucified in weakness but he was raised by the power of god he is our strength he is our strength the holy ghost the word of god in the life and heart of a believer don't just leave it in the prophet don't leave it in your pastor don't leave it in your daddy don't leave it in your mama don't leave it in your husband don't leave it in your wife if this same spirit that raised up jesus from the grave dwell in you it will quicken your mortal body it's the paradox of his power that god would take a people a life that is of weakness and god will take that life that surrenders to him and make his power known through that life i say be it unto me lord amen amen what must i do surrender yield as a vessel yield to him yield to him the more we can empty out the more he can pour himself in as he told the little woman as elisha told her she said there's a creditor that's come from my land and they're going to take this land from me and they're taking my children from me and she needs to know how do i deal with this situation i've got somebody who's coming to take what belongs to me you know what elisha tells her he doesn't say oh go get all the military go get all of this go get all of that no no you know what he says go tell your sons go borrow empty vessels from your neighbor how is she gonna reclaim what belongs to her empty vessels how's she going to stop the creditor from coming empty vessels that become full of oil so as a wise virgin she gets vessels ready for the miracle and he told him don't just borrow a few gather all you can they bring them all in the house they close the door behind them this is not a public display this is a intimate working of the holy ghost the rest of the world won't believe it he's not in there making oil the god whose earth the earth is mine he said and the fullness thereof god created in that room when the door was shut god created what was able to answer the creditor's question amen he that had a lean against him the oil came as an abstract the oil came to move all that was against her and everything that the devil would like to try to take from you what's the answer empty vessels empty vessels what did he have in the upper room what did they have in the upper room empty vessels they had hauled themselves into the upper room what does god call by his word as he calls for israel to come together he's calling for empty vessels and he comes to cleanse and fill their life samuel my vessel let me just tell you even if you already have the oil of the holy ghost in your life listen to me now even with the oil of the spirit of god in your life say god fill every fiber of my being i want to empty up every excuse i want to empty up all of samuel's pride because samuel's got a lot of stinking pride i want to empty up why because the more that i can empty the more he can feel amen i can't feel it but i can empty by saying lord i surrender lord i let down and here the door is closed the curtains drop the rest are on the outside not knowing what's going on but out of that little room walks a little woman with a word that has become substance and as she walks out with that oil it's through that oil that she pays off the debt and she lives the rest of her life by that oil hallelujah this is the lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes the coming of the holy ghost it makes known you're redeemed the call of the spirit of god upon your life is calling you into the place of redemption he's letting you know i have already redeemed you come and accept what belongs to you what's he doing he's calling you into that little place to where he can shut you off from the world and unveil himself and i am the one who answers and deals with the sin question i am the one who settles the debt i am the one who is your ransom from every home let's pray heavenly father you've delivered your word to our hearts now lord you know i know how the enemy would have wanted to battle but you're greater your word has went forth there's not enough devils out of hell that can keep your word from coming to pass there's not enough unbelief that can stop when a heart begins to believe not believing what they can do but to believe the living god is right here among us and he's calling me dear jesus i pray this morning if there's any lord that the door the curtains as it were around their life has not dropped down may they receive that invitation this morning may the lord take of their life and surrender and i pray god for our hearts lord lives that you've already sealed filled with your spirit lord i come back you draw me right back to this place so i'll pray this is also lord if there's any whether they're here or streaming by way of internet maybe lord they felt the holy spirit upon their life but they know it's never went to the depth of their soul where that fountain becomes a spring of living water out of their life issuing forth holiness cleanliness not generated by self but that which is propelled by the strength of the lord in their life may they invite you to be the lord of their life may they say lord go deep in me lord take me into the depths of god and lord for those those of us lord that filled with your oil if there's some wicks that need to be trimmed maybe from the cares of life it's gotten to look gotten a little carboned up this is lamp trimming time time to remove the carbon of the world time to remove what would hinder that flame from burning because the flame itself is what manifests the quality of the oil that's in it [Music] lord forgive us lord may we pick up in the areas we need to pick up in we're not going to we're not trying by our own strength we're here as empty vessels to empty ourselves out before you not to make excuses the lord i pray for every need for every heart right now lord jesus we ask these things in the name of jesus christ amen amen amen if you like to stand you're more welcome to stand give thanks with a grace [Music] because he's given jesus christ give thanks [Music] with a grateful heart give thanks to the holy give thanks because he's given jesus christ [Music] say i am strong let the poor say i am rich because of what the lord has done [Music] i am strong [Music] because of what the lord has done for us give thanks give thanks oh give thanks [Music] give thanks because he's given jesus christ his son give thanks [Music] give thanks because he's given jesus christ his son and the weak say i am strong [Music] let the poor say i am rich because of what the lord has done for us amen and now let the wings i'm strong let the poor say i am rich because of what the lord has done for us again thanks for [Music] this thirsty of my
