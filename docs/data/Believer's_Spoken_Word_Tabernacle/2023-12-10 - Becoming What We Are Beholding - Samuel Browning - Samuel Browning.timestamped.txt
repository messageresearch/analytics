[37:43] brother joshu would Echo these
[37:46] words them standing here
[37:49] together uh with what
[37:52] was spoken by the embassy and other
[37:55] things it's a miracle
[38:00] and I I would say
[38:02] it I would say it like this I I look at
[38:05] everything that's done that it's always
[38:06] a witness for you and I for no matter
[38:09] what need or situation is that we would
[38:11] have before us they were
[38:14] told there will not be anything till
[38:22] 2025 but I like how the scripture could
[38:25] say I like in the scripture puts the
[38:27] conjunction but
[38:30] God but
[38:35] God oh no my my my situation that's not
[38:40] the end but
[38:42] God Amen so we're just so thankful to
[38:46] the Lord that they're here with us and
[38:49] uh also coming up we'll have more
[38:51] details perhaps brother Shane you can
[38:53] gather some of those details for the
[38:54] email for um December 30th um a
[38:58] gathering that they're having uh and we
[39:01] certainly want to support that and so um
[39:06] I think also brother Brian he made some
[39:08] other announcements here today as well
[39:11] we're certainly not encouraging you to
[39:12] stay
[39:13] home uh so but uh I think there are
[39:18] things that we
[39:19] just we want to use uh we want to use
[39:23] wisdom and uh I was um I was preaching
[39:28] was preaching a
[39:30] meeting and
[39:32] uh you know it it didn't bother me if
[39:34] it's only two people there I that
[39:38] doesn't bother me and but the meeting
[39:40] you know there was more than two people
[39:42] and the brother I told him I said hey I
[39:44] said look who's supposed to be here
[39:46] they're here and the others are
[39:48] streaming you can see all of that I said
[39:51] look that that doesn't affect me one bit
[39:54] uh I believe if we can be in the house
[39:55] of God we want want to make do
[39:57] everything we can to be in the house of
[39:59] God that's right amen I I believe that's
[40:01] what we do as
[40:03] Believers uh but
[40:05] uh there were some things that um you
[40:08] know well anyway I don't want to say too
[40:10] much because of somebody streams of
[40:13] service but uh needless to say you know
[40:16] I was uh praying for individuals with Fe
[40:18] statement one time it's true it says uh
[40:22] uh Jesus and germs are kind of alike
[40:25] they're everywhere
[40:29] and so I you know we we we thank the
[40:32] Lord for that I know I know that uh glad
[40:35] to have brother Brian back here with us
[40:38] and
[40:40] uh I I I told him I told him back there
[40:43] this morning just kind of teasing with
[40:44] him I said I hope no more no more
[40:46] presents come back from Arkansas this
[40:50] time and uh so glad to have uh Brother
[40:54] Ray he was back here with us on Thursday
[40:56] and uh and different ones had battled
[40:58] sickness it's just good it's good to be
[41:00] together it's just good to see each one
[41:02] of you and when you're not here we miss
[41:05] you amen we miss you amen and so let's
[41:09] just look to the word of the Lord here
[41:12] in this morning I want to say thank you
[41:14] to the Musicians if you'd like to turn
[41:16] with me in your scriptures to Luke
[41:18] Chapter
[41:19] 2 amen we certainly just love you and
[41:24] uh certainly count and an honor to be
[41:27] here and my I tell you I I didn't get a
[41:31] touch on it on Thursday but my the
[41:33] message brother Ronnie ministered here
[41:35] last Sunday what a tremendous
[41:39] word and uh I you know I I want to
[41:43] believe in some ways but I uh with
[41:47] things that God gives us the grace and I
[41:49] do believe I I'm not I'm not interested
[41:53] in um chatter uh I'm not I'm not
[41:56] interested in um ideas about the
[42:01] message I I'm only interested in the
[42:04] message and uh I I look at that and I
[42:08] think you know that's the thing that we
[42:10] we want you would say well brother Samu
[42:12] isn't that all the same goal I think
[42:14] sometimes there's things that are the
[42:15] goal but it's one of those things is you
[42:17] know the picture itself it's never
[42:19] become more obscure but it becomes more
[42:22] plain there's things even as I read back
[42:25] over of quotes that I'll go back over
[42:26] certain things that maybe I've had down
[42:28] in a file from last year and I look back
[42:30] across I say my it's more plain now than
[42:33] it was last year and it just the picture
[42:36] it what it happens is is the picture
[42:38] itself never shifts away from Jesus
[42:41] Christ being the same right if it does
[42:44] then there's some peace in there that's
[42:46] not right so everything and that goes in
[42:49] our lives to everything he should always
[42:51] be the same if there's a peace we've put
[42:54] in our life that somehow it's taking
[42:56] away from him being the same in our
[42:58] lives that God I I don't need that peace
[43:01] in there I just want the peace that you
[43:03] want that you would remain the same in
[43:06] my life amen so I want to just read just
[43:09] a few verses of scripture in Luke
[43:12] Chapter 2 and uh just a a thought here
[43:17] that really just uh burning on my heart
[43:20] and then even from last weekend with
[43:23] some things that I was uh speaking on
[43:25] and just this was kind of in the
[43:27] background of my heart but in Luke chap
[43:29] 2 and beginning in verse 6 and the Bible
[43:33] says and so it was that while they were
[43:35] there the days were
[43:37] accomplished that she should be
[43:40] delivered and she brought forth her
[43:42] firstborn son and wrapped him in
[43:44] swaddling clothes and laid him in a
[43:47] Manger because there was no room for
[43:50] them in the end and there were in the
[43:52] same country shepherds abiding in the
[43:55] field keeping water watch over their
[43:57] flock by night and lo the angel of the
[44:00] Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the
[44:03] Lord Shone round about them and they
[44:05] were sore afraid and the angel said unto
[44:08] them fear not for behold I bring you
[44:12] good tidings of great joy which shall be
[44:15] to all people for unto you is Born This
[44:18] Day in the city of David a savior which
[44:21] is Christ the lord and this shall be a
[44:24] sign unto you
[44:26] ye shall find the Babe wrapped in
[44:29] swaddling cloths lying in a manger and
[44:33] suddenly there was with the angel a
[44:35] multitude of the Heavenly Host praising
[44:37] God and saying glory to God in the
[44:40] highest and on Earth peace Good Will
[44:43] toward men and it came to pass as the
[44:45] Angels were gone away from them into
[44:47] heaven the Shepherds said one to another
[44:50] let us now go even unto Bethlehem and
[44:54] see this thing which is come to pass
[44:57] which the Lord hath made known unto us
[45:00] and they came with haste and found Mary
[45:03] and Joseph and the Babe lying in a
[45:05] manger and when they had seen it they
[45:08] made known abroad the saying which was
[45:11] told them concerning this
[45:15] child amen May the may the Lord bless
[45:18] the word Les could we just have just a
[45:20] word of prayer here and I know we all we
[45:22] are gathered here we have needs we want
[45:24] to hear from him there's things that God
[45:26] has laid upon my heart but I the the
[45:29] thing that we need is I need the same
[45:31] inspiration that he would that he gave
[45:34] it and brought it to me that he would
[45:35] come and bring it to us today and that
[45:38] he would speak to every need he knows
[45:40] God's reserved he hasn't let me know
[45:42] everything but God has knows what our
[45:45] need is and he is mindful of that and we
[45:48] just want him just we want him to have
[45:49] his way that's that's my ultimate desire
[45:53] here Heavenly Father Lord as we we are
[45:56] so thankful Lord for the moment that we
[45:58] have together together and Lord we ask
[46:02] Lord that you would just come Lord once
[46:04] again Lord in a very special way come
[46:08] and anoint us Lord for service anoint us
[46:11] Lord that we might hear that we might
[46:13] see that we might Lord understand and
[46:16] that our lives God might be further
[46:19] change Lord in this moment Lord we pray
[46:23] Lord may you minister to every need now
[46:26] Lord we give ourselves Lord speaker and
[46:28] hearer to you Lord without any
[46:30] reservation oh God For Your Glory we ask
[46:33] these things in the name of Jesus Christ
[46:36] amen amen amen may God bless you as
[46:38] you're being seated I want
[46:41] to I want to speak on a thought
[46:44] here uh in and that is
[46:49] becoming what we are
[46:51] beholding
[46:53] becoming what we are beholding amen you
[46:56] know it's very very crucial that what
[46:59] you whatever you look
[47:02] at uh it will affect the direction and
[47:05] course of your life you remember the
[47:07] young man when he was riding he got on
[47:10] and rode that bike and the promise was
[47:14] whoever can ride the bike down the plank
[47:16] will win the Schwin BL the bike and a
[47:19] lot of very experienced writers got on
[47:22] there men no doubt writers these were
[47:24] probably the guys going through the
[47:26] neighborhood that could ride without
[47:28] holding the handlebars I never was able
[47:30] to do
[47:32] that so well don't don't don't take me
[47:35] out now but I I just I wasn't able to do
[47:38] that maybe I was on Country gravel too
[47:40] much you know and but uh uh you know he
[47:44] got on there and very simple he rode to
[47:47] the end of the plank and the rest of
[47:49] them around said how what in the world
[47:51] did you do and he said there's one thing
[47:53] he said that I I noticed what all of you
[47:55] did did he says you got to looking at
[47:59] everything that was right here on the
[48:01] side he said and that's what that's why
[48:04] you went off he said but what I did was
[48:06] I just kept my eyes on the goal at the
[48:10] end and that that was a direction and
[48:13] this is why that with every and
[48:15] everything in every part of your journey
[48:17] with God as a Believer it is important
[48:22] and God with his grace comes to direct
[48:25] your focus and attention as he does mine
[48:29] upon the goal at the end lot of
[48:32] distractions can come around our life
[48:34] lot of things to try to pull our
[48:36] attention away but if we can keep our
[48:39] eyes on him then that's when he'll see
[48:43] us through whatever turbulent moment
[48:46] we're in whatever pressing time that
[48:48] you're in whatever in your life that
[48:50] you're going through maybe it's a
[48:52] besetting sin but keep your eyes on him
[48:55] because he'll give you the strength to
[48:57] move through all of that it was when
[48:58] Peter took his eyes off of the Lord
[49:02] Jesus and began to consider how he was
[49:05] walking and what was taking place in his
[49:07] life and when he got occupied on that
[49:10] beholding the wrong thing he begin to
[49:13] sink so it's important of what you
[49:16] behold we see that uh even in the world
[49:19] and the things that we live in even
[49:21] right now of becoming whatsoever that we
[49:25] behold remember it was Lot's wife she
[49:28] was they were instructed when you're
[49:30] called out of Sodom don't look
[49:35] back but she began to hear the cries it
[49:39] was loved ones that were crying and she
[49:42] turned and when she turned against the
[49:46] voice of the angel that said Don't Look
[49:48] Back she became a pillar of salt and
[49:50] this is why Jesus would simply just say
[49:53] in a phrase of scripture remember lot's
[49:55] wife cuz just within those three words
[49:57] is a lot of things to consider to
[49:59] reflect upon and to think about and so
[50:03] to realize that it's very important that
[50:05] also what we are beholding we want to
[50:08] become what we're beholding and I'm
[50:09] talking in terms of the word when I'm
[50:12] looking and just drawn here in this part
[50:15] of the scripture and I'm just to kind of
[50:17] lay behind uh the scenes I I'm thinking
[50:20] of us as Sons and Daughters of God it's
[50:23] important that we're becoming what we're
[50:26] beholding and that we're beholding the
[50:28] right thing and God would be sure to set
[50:30] the right thing before us uh I think
[50:33] many times that as a when I was teaching
[50:36] school you know you could uh somehow
[50:40] take for example you could say well you
[50:42] know the kids they've already wrote
[50:43] letters before when I was a fourth grade
[50:45] teacher well they've wrote letters when
[50:46] they were you know in first grade and
[50:48] second grade and third grade so I'll
[50:49] just tell them to write a letter they'll
[50:51] they'll know what they're doing you
[50:52] realize that the skills themselves
[50:54] aren't continually practice they'll
[50:56] continue they'll lose certain things and
[50:58] then there's certain things that maybe
[51:00] that within that year it's going to be
[51:02] added beyond what they had the previous
[51:05] year such as you know in first grade
[51:07] it's a great accomplishment for them to
[51:09] write uh a number of sentences uh but
[51:11] then when you start moving up into other
[51:13] grades it's now becomes the thought
[51:15] itself kind of deepens and you know it
[51:17] becomes into paragraph so there's a
[51:19] greater expectation and so I just want
[51:22] to say it like this there's a greater
[51:24] expectation in this hour for you and I
[51:27] and God himself has not left us to
[51:30] wonder as to what's expected but God
[51:33] when he makes a promise in his word he
[51:36] doesn't step back and say now you figure
[51:38] it out you try to find out you Tred to
[51:40] see uh determine when it's being
[51:42] fulfilled but we see the pattern once
[51:45] again right here that when this the
[51:47] promise that was made that Behold a
[51:49] virgin shall conceive a child would be
[51:52] born his name shall be called emman
[51:56] it would be an everlasting sign now God
[51:58] made that promise on Isaiah Mary and
[52:00] Joseph were fellowshipping about that
[52:02] promise brother brother Bram gives us
[52:04] that dramatization within that and no
[52:07] doubt these Shepherds they knew about
[52:09] that they no doubt knew the word but you
[52:11] see God in his grace comes by and makes
[52:14] known to them that this fulfillment of
[52:18] the word that's been promised it's being
[52:21] fulfilled right now amen and God makes
[52:24] it known to them as he comes to the
[52:27] Shepherds and I don't want to dwell so
[52:29] much on that this morning but he's
[52:31] coming to simple humble lives to make
[52:35] himself known amen you see God himself
[52:39] being omniscent he doesn't he's not
[52:41] going to waste his time God will
[52:43] broadcast the word but the word comes
[52:46] with an intended target in mind knowing
[52:49] there's there's Hearts because let me
[52:51] just tell you something it would be like
[52:52] you going to the store with your
[52:54] children and you know how it was even as
[52:56] you had your children when they were
[52:58] younger I think sometimes even mothers
[53:00] right now want to make sure that their
[53:01] 40-year-olds are tucked in bed you know
[53:04] I see you see you were out i' see you
[53:05] live 360 you need to be home and you
[53:07] know it's things that you want to uh uh
[53:09] check up on but if you went let me just
[53:11] say it like this so you understand if
[53:13] you went to the store with your children
[53:15] you just didn't walk out the door and
[53:17] look at your wife and say hey uh where
[53:19] where are the kids at no you make sure
[53:21] you went in there with them so you want
[53:24] to make sure they're coming out with you
[53:26] and God coming down to redeem you and I
[53:29] God came down here because we were
[53:32] always his children and he was coming to
[53:35] get
[53:38] us we've always been a part of
[53:43] him so to see that they were called from
[53:47] where they were and notice after the
[53:50] word itself was made known to them they
[53:54] themselves then turned after the great
[53:58] Jubilation and all of the everything
[54:01] that was spoken they themselves said let
[54:03] us go now even unto Bethlehem and see
[54:06] the thing which has come to pass which
[54:08] the Lord made known to us and the Bible
[54:10] say as we read they came and made haste
[54:14] and they saw the Babe lying in the
[54:16] manger and when they seen it they made
[54:19] it known a broads saying which was told
[54:22] them concerning this child now notice
[54:25] the word makes known this is a moment of
[54:28] fulfillment they in obedience to the
[54:31] word now it's going to become something
[54:34] that they must see and give witness to
[54:38] personally it's not going to be enough
[54:40] for them just to take the Angel's word
[54:45] are you hearing me now this is why we
[54:48] hear the message but the message must
[54:50] become something where you see it
[54:54] personally
[54:55] not just something where you take the
[54:57] Angel's word for it but it's something
[55:00] that you recognize this was for me and
[55:03] you walk according to the word to come
[55:05] and see because listen the messenger is
[55:09] a star in the hand of God and he sent
[55:12] there to point and to open the way that
[55:15] Satan has wanted to close off for you
[55:18] coming back in as a son and daughter of
[55:20] God and Satan wants to obscure that but
[55:23] God sends a word where it's a direct
[55:26] reflection of the light himself from the
[55:28] throne that you might walk into the full
[55:32] path as Sons and Daughters of God that's
[55:35] right so you say well shouldn't we take
[55:38] the Angel's word they did they acted
[55:41] upon it they did what he said if they
[55:44] had stayed in the field where they were
[55:49] they would have never saw what the word
[55:52] was saying was on Earth you see that's
[55:55] where it puts it on you and I we can
[55:58] hear we can hear the word and we can
[56:01] stay in the same place where we're at
[56:04] but listen no matter where you're at in
[56:06] your journey it's one thing as God is
[56:09] making his word known but he's letting
[56:12] you know go to the Fulfillment that he
[56:15] is proclaiming don't just stand in the
[56:19] field and say glory to God in the
[56:22] highest peace and Good Will has come but
[56:25] to go and behold what has been
[56:31] fulfilled and become
[56:34] that and I think this is
[56:36] where we look in the scripture here and
[56:40] you hear from this from the portion we
[56:43] read today where the Bible had said
[56:45] there was no room for him in the end
[56:47] that's quite quite a symbol that's
[56:49] placed out there of what it spoke within
[56:52] the lives and the hearts of men right of
[56:55] how it was even among the religious of
[56:57] that day there was no room for
[57:01] him I want you to listen how brother BR
[57:03] says this he says no wonder there was no
[57:06] room for him in the end it wasn't
[57:09] wrapped right it wasn't wrapped the
[57:12] classical paper around it you see uh and
[57:16] and and and forgive me for just a moment
[57:18] but it's just like you know you could
[57:20] have the most beautiful paper wrapped
[57:23] around a gift right the paper ends up in
[57:26] the trash it's the
[57:30] gift it's like the gift bags that are
[57:32] given you don't want it give it back to
[57:35] me I'll recycle and use it
[57:38] again come on all the rest of us Penny
[57:42] Pinchers in
[57:44] here but you see what I'm saying notice
[57:47] the Bible said there was no Beauty in
[57:50] this gift trap no beauty that we should
[57:54] desire you see God has chosen in such a
[57:57] way and so ordained it it was always his
[58:00] thought are you hearing me this was
[58:02] always his
[58:04] thought and God's thought being
[58:07] expressed now it has an effect on those
[58:10] when he comes that are a part of that
[58:15] thought and so when he reveals himself
[58:19] they could look and see they they could
[58:21] see here here's a man remember the
[58:23] Greeks they stum LED and they looked and
[58:25] said they want to see Jesus but all they
[58:28] saw was a
[58:29] man but the disciples saw the gift that
[58:34] was
[58:35] behind behind the flesh behind the paper
[58:39] yes sir is that right that's what's
[58:42] important is that in everything listen
[58:44] to me now in everything in your
[58:47] Christian walk my Christian walk I want
[58:49] to know where is Christ in this if
[58:53] there's anything presented as a gift if
[58:56] it even is a gift of something this is
[58:58] to further your natural life it'll help
[59:00] you I want to know where is Christ in
[59:03] this amen well brother Samuel how can I
[59:06] know that listen you're a Believer the
[59:08] Bible says that we are to exercise our
[59:12] senses to be able to discern good and
[59:15] evil and we do that by eating the meat
[59:18] of the Worden when you're not eating and
[59:21] feasting on the word your discernment
[59:23] goes down your discernment it becomes
[59:25] now your reasoning abilities your
[59:27] feelings about things well I think
[59:29] feeling it's all right I feel it's okay
[59:31] I you know I think God understands that
[59:33] you see what happens you now begin to
[59:35] move into a realm that you're not called
[59:38] to live in you're out of your domain as
[59:40] a son and daughter of God when you're
[59:42] not living from the soul realm amen amen
[59:46] Satan's desire is to pull you into the
[59:48] spirit realm pull you into the flesh
[59:50] realm that's what the maniac there in
[59:53] Oregon wanted to to do when he came up
[59:55] the stage it wasn't the man so much it
[59:58] was the Satan himself knew if he could
[1:00:01] get the prophet out of that Realm of the
[1:00:04] soul and get him in his Spirit realm he
[1:00:06] had him
[1:00:08] whipped the very moment we go to our
[1:00:11] reasonings we're whipped that's why the
[1:00:13] Bible said lean not to your own
[1:00:16] understanding Hallelujah beloved believe
[1:00:19] not every Spirit but try
[1:00:22] everyone notice it say it didn't say
[1:00:24] believe not every
[1:00:27] wrapping believe not every flesh Veil no
[1:00:30] it said try the spirit what is
[1:00:34] behind the
[1:00:38] rapping where will this take me will it
[1:00:41] lead me closer to God or further of God
[1:00:43] but you see that's according to your
[1:00:45] objective my objective what's our desire
[1:00:47] I believe your desire it would
[1:00:49] correspond with what's in my heart I
[1:00:52] want to be closer to God I want to to be
[1:00:54] more like
[1:00:56] God absolutely amen I I want I want to
[1:01:00] be more like him I want listen Enoch got
[1:01:03] so close to
[1:01:04] God until God took him he didn't get
[1:01:08] further he got
[1:01:10] closer notice it was wrapped as a gift
[1:01:14] as a gift from God sent from God a God
[1:01:18] that they didn't know nothing about they
[1:01:19] claimed they did and they claimed they
[1:01:21] was looking for him but he did not come
[1:01:23] in the way that they thought he was
[1:01:25] coming according to their Creeds they
[1:01:27] could not receive God's Gift he was
[1:01:29] wrapped different he was wrapped up like
[1:01:31] a baby he was born in a manger he come
[1:01:35] from poor people come from a bunch of
[1:01:37] Fanatics so how could they receive
[1:01:39] something like that no wonder there was
[1:01:41] no room for him in the
[1:01:45] end I want to just announce right here
[1:01:47] and I would try to say it you you're
[1:01:49] just a privilege to be I think what was
[1:01:51] it brother John Sanger said you're just
[1:01:53] privileged to hear me preach on
[1:01:57] myself there's more room for
[1:02:01] him there's more I I don't have enough I
[1:02:03] want
[1:02:04] more I want more I want him to have more
[1:02:08] in my
[1:02:11] life is that
[1:02:14] right sometimes in order to have more
[1:02:16] you you know Brothers you know how it is
[1:02:19] if you're going to have more pictures on
[1:02:21] the wall you got to get rid of some of
[1:02:23] the rest of them
[1:02:25] there's only so much room in the
[1:02:26] basement right there's only so much room
[1:02:28] in the garage before you star renting
[1:02:31] storage
[1:02:32] units eventually got to just start
[1:02:34] getting rid of it and and and that's the
[1:02:36] same thing in our Liv it's things
[1:02:38] sometimes that God's asking us to get
[1:02:40] rid of and you know what he's actually
[1:02:42] calling us to to trust him more it
[1:02:44] really isn't so much about the thing
[1:02:47] he's dealing with our life about it
[1:02:49] isn't necessarily the what he's dealing
[1:02:50] with our life about that it's sin he's
[1:02:53] just simply saying and you're there's no
[1:02:55] room for me to further grow and spread
[1:02:58] out in your
[1:03:00] life but Lord I must have this I must do
[1:03:02] this I must do that God brings us to a
[1:03:07] place of trusting him
[1:03:11] completely that's what Genesis 22 was
[1:03:14] Abraham Abraham you would have never saw
[1:03:17] that out of Abraham in Genesis
[1:03:19] 12 you didn't you never saw it in
[1:03:22] Genesis 13 never saw it in 14 15 16 17
[1:03:26] 18
[1:03:27] 19 you didn't see that to Genesis 22 so
[1:03:31] you know what that tells me that we grow
[1:03:35] hallelujah it's growing to a place this
[1:03:38] is coming to a place of complete trust
[1:03:41] to where Lord I trust your word above my
[1:03:44] own
[1:03:46] reasonings say is all listen Saint's
[1:03:49] tactic is always to bring us into our
[1:03:51] reasonings on things to dwell and to
[1:03:53] shift for ourself within that way and I
[1:03:56] just want to say within that where it
[1:03:58] says there's no room for him there's a
[1:04:00] lot of even among we realize listen in
[1:04:03] this hour he's knocking he was knocking
[1:04:07] at the door he was put out of the church
[1:04:09] now you would look and say well they
[1:04:11] have the Bible yeah whatever version
[1:04:13] they've got now even if they have King
[1:04:14] James version but they put him
[1:04:17] out because you can have all of the
[1:04:20] letter and if you don't have him who is
[1:04:22] the author the dynamic to the mechanics
[1:04:25] you missed what it's all about that's
[1:04:28] right it's about him he's the only one
[1:04:30] that can make the word live he's the
[1:04:32] only one that can make it work in our
[1:04:34] lives right yes sir so it's him I I
[1:04:38] don't need more education I don't need
[1:04:40] more knowledge I don't need to know this
[1:04:42] and know that what I need I need him I
[1:04:45] need to know him oh I want to know him
[1:04:48] more and how do we know him more by
[1:04:51] beholding what he himself is making
[1:04:54] known to you and
[1:04:56] I and becoming what we're beholding
[1:05:00] that's now that's the challenge that's
[1:05:03] the challenge that we face that's the
[1:05:05] battle that's where Satan battles is
[1:05:08] becoming and that part of becoming the
[1:05:11] in between from what we're
[1:05:13] beholding no room for him they you know
[1:05:17] they don't want they don't they don't
[1:05:19] want they they want things their way let
[1:05:21] me just say what it boils down to within
[1:05:23] this you'll hear Brother brand say this
[1:05:25] over and over in the message and I think
[1:05:26] it's very true because Satan's desire is
[1:05:29] to corrupt the Mind from the Simplicity
[1:05:32] of the Gospel they were looking for what
[1:05:35] they looked at was we need a great
[1:05:36] military man to come down and to lead us
[1:05:39] out and he'll you know destroy all this
[1:05:40] and destroy all that what God what they
[1:05:43] needed God gave them what they needed
[1:05:47] was a
[1:05:48] baby say a baby they needed a
[1:05:52] birth they didn't need more training
[1:05:55] they didn't need a more of an
[1:05:56] intellectual man they needed a birth let
[1:05:58] me just say this friends you cannot
[1:06:00] bypass the new
[1:06:02] birth and ever get anywhere with
[1:06:06] god well I'll go to this conference or
[1:06:08] I'll go to this or I'll go to that let
[1:06:10] me just tell you something self-help and
[1:06:12] all those other things I'm just going to
[1:06:14] tell you personally from my heart there
[1:06:16] is nothing that can that can do what the
[1:06:19] new birth can do you say brother Samuel
[1:06:22] how can you say that I'm a
[1:06:25] witness I'm a witness of what the new
[1:06:28] birth does in a
[1:06:30] life I believe there's other Witnesses
[1:06:32] here but you see how Satan wants to sow
[1:06:35] if we not careful he wants to sow
[1:06:37] creeping in right even among us as
[1:06:40] though now something is substituted when
[1:06:43] in God's intended purpose is that Christ
[1:06:46] would dwell supremely in our
[1:06:51] lives even more amen watch how brother
[1:06:55] Ram says this he says and further in
[1:06:57] that quote in paragraph 64 he says he
[1:07:00] was wrapped then in a dirty cloth a
[1:07:02] swaddling
[1:07:04] cloth brother John zanger made mention
[1:07:06] of that when he was here and what they
[1:07:08] put around the ox's neck and he's
[1:07:10] wrapped today in the same
[1:07:12] thing they call Holy Roller fanaticism a
[1:07:15] bunch of Heretics it's wrapped up in
[1:07:18] swaddling cloth and the world don't want
[1:07:21] it right oh I'm so glad to raise that
[1:07:25] cloth off listen let me tell you
[1:07:26] something friends let me just bring this
[1:07:28] this quote right here not bring it up to
[1:07:30] date but let me just tell you the world
[1:07:32] still don't want
[1:07:34] it there's even around our ranks that
[1:07:37] don't want
[1:07:39] it they wanted to formalize the working
[1:07:42] of the Holy Spirit and control
[1:07:46] it you don't control God glory god is
[1:07:50] made to flow through you and
[1:07:52] I amen prise the Lord oh my I I I I want
[1:07:57] I want all of him
[1:08:00] amen I want all of him much as he says
[1:08:04] oh I'm so glad to raise that cloth off
[1:08:07] look notice I'm glad to raise that cloth
[1:08:09] off that to me that statement that's
[1:08:12] made right there it is not just a
[1:08:14] statement in passing of what the
[1:08:16] scripture we've read but in this very
[1:08:19] hour it is Christ himself that has taken
[1:08:22] the Veil off of the
[1:08:25] word God has taken the veil off of what
[1:08:28] man has has looked at in confusion but
[1:08:31] God himself has taken the cloth he has
[1:08:34] opened the
[1:08:37] seals and who is those seals he is those
[1:08:41] seals that's why the prophet could say
[1:08:43] over and over he says when he opened
[1:08:45] those six seals notice he the seven seal
[1:08:48] open the six
[1:08:50] seals it's him it's him that has come
[1:08:53] right here Among Us it's him that's
[1:08:55] taken the cover off the word where the
[1:08:58] where the church has said well you just
[1:08:59] agree with this and you just sign our
[1:09:02] book or you just ascribe to this or even
[1:09:04] how the spirit wants to work around our
[1:09:06] message well you just believe brother
[1:09:08] randam is a prophet and you just believe
[1:09:10] that the doctrines are the truth and you
[1:09:12] just subscribe to this no but to take
[1:09:14] the cloth off and to see what it really
[1:09:18] is it's
[1:09:19] [Music]
[1:09:21] Christ it's Christ and when I say that
[1:09:25] it's Christ in you
[1:09:27] amen look he says look what's laying
[1:09:30] underneath it eternal life God made
[1:09:35] flesh and dwelt among
[1:09:41] us remember let me just give just a
[1:09:44] few bounce on a few
[1:09:47] examples Phillip went to Nathaniel and
[1:09:50] told him we found him right
[1:09:55] we found him we found him whom Moses and
[1:09:58] the prophets spoke of we found
[1:10:03] him and then he proceeds to tell
[1:10:08] Nathaniel of where he is Jesus of
[1:10:11] Nazareth and what's Nathaniel's response
[1:10:17] Nazareth what good can come out of that
[1:10:19] swaddling
[1:10:22] cloth what good can come out of that
[1:10:24] life let me just say this to you listen
[1:10:27] I know from my own
[1:10:29] life where others that I where I grew up
[1:10:32] in the city I grew up in those that were
[1:10:33] around that knew me what happened to
[1:10:36] that
[1:10:37] guy or even individuals you know that
[1:10:40] after they start hearing certain things
[1:10:41] how teachers could look at you and
[1:10:42] things like that and he listen I was in
[1:10:45] I was in need of help I needed help from
[1:10:48] a living God I needed to meet that God
[1:10:52] personally are you hearing me but look
[1:10:55] at they can look at your life look at my
[1:10:57] life what can come out of that life it's
[1:10:59] not what you're seeing but what's
[1:11:01] beneath
[1:11:03] there it's not the darkness that's
[1:11:05] around it but a sea that's beneath
[1:11:09] it it's what's beneath that it's the
[1:11:12] character that God SED in there that's
[1:11:15] what he's working to bring
[1:11:17] forth are you hearing me God's not
[1:11:20] trying to bring you and I to a place to
[1:11:22] where that we conf formed to the word
[1:11:24] that's not what it is he's leading you
[1:11:27] and I out of Darkness into this
[1:11:30] Marvelous
[1:11:31] Light and the light shineth brighter and
[1:11:34] brighter and brighter until that perfect
[1:11:35] day it's God himself leading his
[1:11:38] children above the muck that we were
[1:11:41] buried in Above This Pond of Life above
[1:11:45] all the dirt that was packed into US
[1:11:47] above all the grab bag of
[1:11:50] life it's the quickening power of God
[1:11:53] that's leading
[1:11:57] us they said to him the one of the
[1:11:59] greatest things come and
[1:12:01] see come and
[1:12:03] see come and behold what I'm saying has
[1:12:06] been fulfilled and when he got there the
[1:12:10] word itself identified
[1:12:16] him behold an Israelite in whom there is
[1:12:20] no
[1:12:21] gu amen huh Rabbi when did you know me I
[1:12:25] saw thee
[1:12:29] before before Philip ever called you I
[1:12:32] saw you
[1:12:34] before what before are we talking about
[1:12:37] where were you
[1:12:38] [Applause]
[1:12:40] before before the foundation of the
[1:12:43] world when the angel sang and The
[1:12:45] Morning Star shouted for Joy where were
[1:12:48] you before
[1:12:50] Hallelujah I saw you before
[1:12:58] H you hear what I'm saying so no matter
[1:13:02] what sin or what unbelief or what has
[1:13:05] ever tried to hedge in a seed of God it
[1:13:09] will not work it cannot overcome the
[1:13:12] word of God it cannot overthrow the
[1:13:14] purpose of almighty God every son and
[1:13:17] daughter of God comes to a personal
[1:13:20] Resurrection amen
[1:13:28] I tell you let me just say this to you
[1:13:30] these are not just words but it's things
[1:13:32] that the Holy Spirit called into our
[1:13:33] hearts that we would behold and become
[1:13:36] what we're
[1:13:38] beholding and he says you believe this
[1:13:40] he says you're going to see greater than
[1:13:42] this what would be
[1:13:44] greater well more of the same sure more
[1:13:47] greater meaning more but greater than
[1:13:49] this you'll see something greater than
[1:13:51] this what could be greater than seeing
[1:13:54] the Messiah than seeing God in Christ
[1:13:57] what would be greater is seeing God in
[1:14:00] you seeing God in your own
[1:14:03] life that's the working of redemption
[1:14:06] God does not want you talking about
[1:14:08] somebody else's testimony Daddy's
[1:14:10] testimony mommy's testimony the
[1:14:12] prophet's testimony you're to have your
[1:14:14] own
[1:14:16] [Applause]
[1:14:18] testimony become what we're
[1:14:21] beholding the woman at the well
[1:14:24] H she
[1:14:25] came and there at the well she began to
[1:14:29] behold and when she was
[1:14:33] beholding she became what she was
[1:14:39] beholding she left her water
[1:14:43] pots everything let me just preach for a
[1:14:46] moment everything that she had come to
[1:14:49] rely on in
[1:14:51] life that some how was an appeasement
[1:14:55] she knew the
[1:14:56] word but something that she could rely
[1:14:58] on no doubt she had she was very
[1:15:00] beautiful she could rely on that she
[1:15:03] could rely on her charm she could rely
[1:15:05] on going to that well but you see God
[1:15:09] wanted to bring her to a complete
[1:15:11] Reliance upon the word because all that
[1:15:14] other ground is Shaky Ground right right
[1:15:18] she was with the one man ah that didn't
[1:15:20] work out then the next and the she he
[1:15:21] wanted to bring her to s Solid Ground to
[1:15:25] stability in her life so here he begins
[1:15:28] to talk to her what is she doing she's
[1:15:30] beholding but after beholding she
[1:15:32] becomes what she's beholding now we
[1:15:35] never read anymore about we don't even
[1:15:36] know her name we don't never read
[1:15:38] anymore about this but we do know one
[1:15:39] thing for sure she had to be one that
[1:15:42] received an upper room experience like
[1:15:44] the rest of them did but she had and
[1:15:47] walked by the experience that God was
[1:15:50] giving her at that moment that was an
[1:15:52] experience of
[1:15:54] redemption that this word is for you
[1:15:57] it's not by an accident that you are
[1:15:59] hearing this word and the word is
[1:16:01] dealing with your life the word is
[1:16:03] touching things in your life in your
[1:16:05] heart and going down through and calling
[1:16:07] you out it's not an accident it's not by
[1:16:09] chance it's by
[1:16:12] Design now the Bible says in John 16:13
[1:16:16] how be it when he the spirit of Truth is
[1:16:18] come he will guide you into all Truth
[1:16:22] for he he shall not speak of himself now
[1:16:27] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[1:16:29] he speak and he will show you things to
[1:16:32] come so I want to say when we look here
[1:16:35] in this scripture that's a very uh uh uh
[1:16:39] loaded scripture because when he is come
[1:16:43] he leads and guides us into all
[1:16:47] truth it it never stops he continues to
[1:16:52] lead us
[1:16:53] on and the truth itself is the person of
[1:16:57] Jesus Christ I want you to think he
[1:16:58] stood in the midst of pilate's court and
[1:17:01] proclaimed that the purpose he was sent
[1:17:03] was to Bear witness to the truth what
[1:17:06] truth what truth was he to Bear witness
[1:17:09] too the truth that was
[1:17:12] lost but I I thought the prophets had
[1:17:14] the truth the truth would move through
[1:17:16] them but the truth that was going to be
[1:17:19] restored was the truth like they had it
[1:17:21] in Eden where God's image was veiled in
[1:17:25] their lives Hallelujah he came to
[1:17:28] restore that truth right Hallelujah not
[1:17:32] a truth because the prophets notice the
[1:17:35] spirit of Truth would move upon them
[1:17:37] then it would lift off then it would
[1:17:38] move upon them then it would lift off
[1:17:41] because remember that was the difference
[1:17:43] with the coming in Redemption on whom
[1:17:46] you see the spirit descending and
[1:17:50] remaining the same is he
[1:17:53] so the identification is the abiding of
[1:17:57] the spirit of the Living God that leads
[1:18:00] and guides in all of the truth
[1:18:04] amen
[1:18:06] amen so he come to Bear witness of the
[1:18:09] truth remember God has not left it up to
[1:18:13] you and I to figure our way out God
[1:18:16] makes himself known to you and I
[1:18:18] personally the little Eagle that was in
[1:18:20] the barnyard the prophet picks this up
[1:18:23] and rising of the sun he said he did not
[1:18:25] need a picture of an
[1:18:27] eagle
[1:18:28] right right but what had the effect is
[1:18:32] when he saw a
[1:18:34] being like he
[1:18:36] was and he didn't have a mirror are you
[1:18:39] hearing me he didn't have a mirror that
[1:18:41] he could walk by and say I look
[1:18:43] different than them but he could look
[1:18:46] only in a shortened way my feet are
[1:18:49] different than their feet my wings are
[1:18:51] different than them my feathers these
[1:18:53] said he could see differences but he
[1:18:55] wasn't able to identify his
[1:18:59] kind and by beholding the chickens all
[1:19:03] he did was try to act like a chicken
[1:19:06] that's all he knew to
[1:19:08] do but when one came that was of his
[1:19:11] kind and Mama eagle flew over he could
[1:19:15] look up and see that is a
[1:19:18] being that's a living being he couldn't
[1:19:21] explain it he couldn't figure it all out
[1:19:23] but something was just taking hold on
[1:19:25] his life that all the rest of the
[1:19:29] thoughts and the clucks of oh you'll
[1:19:30] never be able to do that you got to
[1:19:31] watch out for them they're the kind that
[1:19:33] eat us you got to watch out they'll
[1:19:34] swallow up everything I mean they
[1:19:36] they'll do away with our Creeds they'll
[1:19:37] do away with all these Isom they'll do
[1:19:39] it but there was something that was
[1:19:40] taking hold on him that was greater than
[1:19:43] any power of human reasoning or
[1:19:45] intellect it was the power of almighty
[1:19:48] God that was coming down through the
[1:19:50] Chanel of the word being fulf
[1:19:53] filled and when Mama eagle flew over his
[1:19:57] head was up
[1:20:00] Hall she said jump son jump he
[1:20:04] jumped
[1:20:06] hallu oh he jumped on the fence post I
[1:20:10] don't know jumping up on the fence post
[1:20:12] might have took a Month of Sundays but
[1:20:14] finally he that courage came on in there
[1:20:18] then he got up on that fence post but
[1:20:20] then after the fence post here mama
[1:20:22] Eagle said just flap your wings you're
[1:20:24] built for
[1:20:26] this you see he had a living reality
[1:20:29] that he could look at and that's what
[1:20:32] God comes to show you and I is a living
[1:20:35] reality making himself known to you and
[1:20:40] I through every facet of our
[1:20:47] life Acts chapter 1 and verse
[1:20:50] 8 Jesus said
[1:20:53] to the disciples you shall receive power
[1:20:56] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[1:20:59] you and you shall be Witnesses unto me
[1:21:03] both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in
[1:21:06] Samaria and unto the uttermost part of
[1:21:09] the earth now you can put your name in
[1:21:12] there and not just in your community but
[1:21:15] through every aspect of
[1:21:18] life to be a witness that he has come
[1:21:22] amen
[1:21:24] that we are living in the last
[1:21:29] days that it is a fact it's a reality
[1:21:32] that God and Christ are one amen you're
[1:21:35] a witness that God still gives the Holy
[1:21:39] Ghost amen you're a witness that there
[1:21:42] is genuine Christians you're a witness
[1:21:46] that the gospel is still in effect
[1:21:50] you're a witness that the apostolic age
[1:21:52] AG is still in
[1:21:57] session and when he had spoken these
[1:22:00] things while they behal now I want you
[1:22:01] to notice while they
[1:22:04] behadd he was taken up and a cloud
[1:22:07] received him out of their sight and
[1:22:09] while they looked steadfastly toward
[1:22:11] Heaven as he went up behold two men
[1:22:14] stood by them in white apparel which
[1:22:16] also said ye men of Galilee why stand
[1:22:19] you gazing up into heaven this same
[1:22:21] Jesus which is up from you into heaven
[1:22:24] shall so come in like manner as you have
[1:22:27] seen him go into heaven then they
[1:22:29] returned unto Jerusalem from the mount
[1:22:32] called ol of it which is from Jerusalem
[1:22:35] a Sabbath Day's Journey now I want you
[1:22:37] to think just for a moment the direction
[1:22:40] of where they headed after things had
[1:22:43] not worked out like they thought it
[1:22:45] would work out they were going away from
[1:22:49] where they needed to be right what was
[1:22:53] taking them away
[1:22:55] discouragement brother bramy uses
[1:22:57] another word
[1:23:00] bewildered we
[1:23:02] thought that's what they said we
[1:23:07] thought and it wasn't that their
[1:23:09] thinking as far as him being a redeemer
[1:23:12] it's they didn't understand the thought
[1:23:15] of
[1:23:17] redemption but you see God comes think
[1:23:20] for 40 days
[1:23:23] he comes and he gathers
[1:23:26] them they don't know where he's going to
[1:23:29] appear there they are out fishing right
[1:23:33] there they are here right and here he
[1:23:35] shows up you know all of that was also
[1:23:37] training that was also training for them
[1:23:40] to let them see and to know that God is
[1:23:42] interested and he occupies himself with
[1:23:45] every part of our
[1:23:48] life even when they needed fish he
[1:23:51] supplied what they needed
[1:23:54] and to be put them brother BR said put
[1:23:56] them in a place to where you never know
[1:23:58] what corner you turn and you're going to
[1:24:00] see him standing there always to be
[1:24:03] aware he's right here with us he's near
[1:24:07] but there had to have been something
[1:24:09] that was there at this event that was
[1:24:12] taking
[1:24:14] place and how that they had witnessed
[1:24:17] this event and man 40 days walking with
[1:24:20] him but to think how these the Angels
[1:24:23] the Bible said two men that stood by
[1:24:25] them dressed in white apparel they these
[1:24:28] angels must have captured think about it
[1:24:31] what they are seeing they have
[1:24:33] witnessed he who said I'm going to go
[1:24:37] away for a little while and your sorrow
[1:24:40] but you'll see me again then he lets
[1:24:43] them know and again I say I'm going to
[1:24:46] go away but you'll see me again he was
[1:24:48] letting him know the first time will be
[1:24:51] the crucifixion and then the
[1:24:53] resurrection and then the next time
[1:24:55] you'll see me going but I will come
[1:24:57] again but I will come in
[1:25:00] you because your sorrow will be turned
[1:25:03] to
[1:25:05] Joy that's what the spirit of Truth was
[1:25:08] leading them into to behold it was to
[1:25:11] behold the promise that was for their
[1:25:14] lives to Behold The Working of the holy
[1:25:18] spirit in their
[1:25:20] lives evidently these these these uh
[1:25:23] these uh these angels are standing there
[1:25:26] they must have you know must have said
[1:25:29] Hey Hey cuz as they said by the
[1:25:30] scriptures look you're gazing you're
[1:25:33] beholding too long and not moving to the
[1:25:36] place of becoming I believe it's
[1:25:38] important that we look upon the right
[1:25:42] things I don't believe that we need that
[1:25:44] we are to rush about things I believe
[1:25:48] that when we look at things and say God
[1:25:51] let it so move into my life because
[1:25:54] listen so many times that's where even
[1:25:57] things have gotten to even in life
[1:26:00] theyve looked they thought they knew
[1:26:01] what it was and they took off and yet
[1:26:03] they didn't they missed what it was
[1:26:05] really all
[1:26:07] about we think the message was just
[1:26:09] another great Revival and they missed
[1:26:12] it and failed to recognize that what the
[1:26:15] message was all about was the original
[1:26:18] message of Christ in
[1:26:21] you then you must be born again that
[1:26:24] Christ becomes preeminent through your
[1:26:26] life not just become born again and set
[1:26:29] around as though I made it already but
[1:26:31] now it's Christ Living and operating and
[1:26:34] breathing and moving through every facet
[1:26:36] of our
[1:26:41] life had to been where they were they
[1:26:44] kept on looking and if Satan can get you
[1:26:46] to look at the wrong thing or look even
[1:26:50] at the right thing but in the wrong way
[1:26:53] he's got
[1:26:55] you remember John when he was given a
[1:26:59] tour in the Book of
[1:27:02] Revelations the prophet of
[1:27:05] God gave John a tour because when John
[1:27:09] fell down to worship Him He said stand
[1:27:12] up on your feet see thou doest it not I
[1:27:15] am of thy fellow servants the
[1:27:18] prophets what was he saying what you're
[1:27:20] beholding but you're not looking at it
[1:27:22] in the right
[1:27:24] way it's not to worship me but to see
[1:27:28] that this God who is the person of Truth
[1:27:31] the spirit of Truth is leading you to
[1:27:33] the real truth in your life that you are
[1:27:36] a son of God you are a daughter of
[1:27:39] God let me tell you your first birth my
[1:27:41] first birth is the
[1:27:44] lie you hear me the first birth is the
[1:27:48] lie it's a product of the lie that was
[1:27:51] told in the the Garden of
[1:27:53] Eden but the second birth is the product
[1:27:56] of the
[1:27:58] truth it is the truth himself coming
[1:28:02] forth that you are a son and daughter of
[1:28:04] God that's what happened to the woman at
[1:28:06] the well it was the truth beneath the
[1:28:09] darkness coming forth it was the truth
[1:28:12] in the prodical son it was the truth in
[1:28:15] Peter the truth in
[1:28:21] Paul
[1:28:25] so that's a
[1:28:26] key want to be moving to a place of
[1:28:29] becoming you know not just come and look
[1:28:31] at it man that's wonderful tremendous
[1:28:34] wow glory to God in the
[1:28:37] highest and then we back here again oh
[1:28:41] glory to God in the highest praise the
[1:28:44] Lord what are you saying brother the Sam
[1:28:47] becoming what we are
[1:28:51] beholding you know what that means is
[1:28:53] you can even come here in the church and
[1:28:56] you've got to press beyond what you're
[1:28:58] even seeing and what you're hearing
[1:29:01] right cuz you can see and hear just a
[1:29:04] man you can have and sense a feeling and
[1:29:09] a sense the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:29:11] you got to go beyond that you got to
[1:29:14] move beyond that you got to remember
[1:29:15] he's here to lead you to direct you it's
[1:29:18] one of those things that God take the
[1:29:19] man of God and help me to see the areas
[1:29:22] in my life where I need to grow Lord in
[1:29:27] you oh my let me move on here
[1:29:30] quick so he would let them know even as
[1:29:33] he did at the tomb remember think about
[1:29:36] it in the grace of God if he had not
[1:29:38] come the Angels where they were even as
[1:29:41] he appeared to Mary Magdalene they were
[1:29:43] looking in the
[1:29:45] Tomb if he hadn't come if the Angels had
[1:29:49] not announced they'd have still been
[1:29:50] there looking at the tomb right they
[1:29:53] would have charged admission to
[1:29:55] it it would have become just a
[1:30:00] sight but it wasn't to be a sight it
[1:30:04] wasn't to be I mean I I'm thankful that
[1:30:06] there's places that we can visit but
[1:30:08] it's something deeper than that
[1:30:10] memorials are all about to let you know
[1:30:13] and remind you what he was yesterday he
[1:30:17] is still the same today that's what
[1:30:20] memorials are all about memorials are
[1:30:22] not gravestones that God don't move no
[1:30:25] more like that that's not a memorial of
[1:30:28] God that is a supplier of man Hallelujah
[1:30:32] but the memorials of God are witnesses
[1:30:35] what God did before he's still God
[1:30:43] today and he had they had to tell him
[1:30:46] he's not there he's risen a change had
[1:30:49] come a fulfillment of scripture had
[1:30:51] taken place an announcement that would
[1:30:53] begin to gather the scattered sheep
[1:30:55] together for the purpose and to serve
[1:30:57] his purpose so in other words the seeing
[1:31:00] was changed to beholding him in the
[1:31:02] Fulfillment of his word now had changed
[1:31:05] from the example to behold now the
[1:31:07] entrance and the summons into the same
[1:31:10] image to become a partaker of his life a
[1:31:13] joint Heir a
[1:31:18] beneficiary why didn't he repair to
[1:31:21] aapas
[1:31:22] why didn't he go back to them and say
[1:31:24] see what I told you you didn't believe
[1:31:28] me it wasn't for them they weren't
[1:31:32] believers they didn't believe then they
[1:31:34] wouldn't believe
[1:31:35] now right even what Jesus told the Rich
[1:31:37] Young Ruler they got the they got the
[1:31:39] prophets in the Psalms right right you
[1:31:42] see here when he comes back now is to
[1:31:45] behold this is the
[1:31:47] entrance that's why as we're beholding
[1:31:50] Christ it's behold holding that entrance
[1:31:52] into all things beholding him the who
[1:31:55] has all wisdom has all things for our
[1:32:00] life this is why even when the
[1:32:03] prophet would say it like this remember
[1:32:06] regarding the hidden Mana when it was
[1:32:08] given as Junior Jackson gave that dream
[1:32:11] about that crowbar being taken in the
[1:32:14] top of that mountain coming off notice
[1:32:15] not the bottom the top we're at the
[1:32:18] summit it's Capstone time Hallelujah and
[1:32:20] underneath that Capstone notice it was
[1:32:24] in the hand a crowbar to go in there and
[1:32:27] what did he instruct what did he
[1:32:28] instruct to be done Brethren look on
[1:32:32] these
[1:32:33] things look on these things not go out
[1:32:37] and see what so and so said on this
[1:32:39] website we're not in the days of
[1:32:42] presuming no
[1:32:44] more we're in the days when the perfect
[1:32:47] interpretation has
[1:32:49] come Hallelujah we're in the days when
[1:32:53] the absolute of God's stop has
[1:32:57] broke the silence around our life has
[1:33:01] broken amen it's God's thoughts being
[1:33:04] carried out it's God's thoughts we're
[1:33:05] being moved by and notice even as the
[1:33:09] prophet said
[1:33:10] then there were those even at that time
[1:33:13] and I certainly think there's always a
[1:33:15] time in a season and we understand that
[1:33:16] but there were those who who who who
[1:33:18] began to follow and go after brother
[1:33:21] Bram where he was
[1:33:23] going and what they failed to recognize
[1:33:25] is here was the angel making the
[1:33:27] announcement he's on earth now the
[1:33:31] Fulfillment of the word is
[1:33:33] hereall your deliverance has come Christ
[1:33:37] is here dwelling right Among
[1:33:40] Us right we love his
[1:33:44] appearing we love his appearing here he
[1:33:46] is and to behold and now to become what
[1:33:50] we're beholding I want to just let me
[1:33:52] just let me just move through this these
[1:33:55] parts
[1:33:57] here and God's wrapped gift I think
[1:34:00] paragraph 156
[1:34:02] Brianna he says it like this he says
[1:34:05] God's Gift package wrapped up in the
[1:34:08] form today of the Holy Ghost it was
[1:34:12] wrapped up then and called the Son of
[1:34:15] God God's Gift package was just taken up
[1:34:19] and rewrapped again in and sent back it
[1:34:24] was wrapped up in the Son of God then
[1:34:28] it's wrapped up in sons of God today
[1:34:32] called The
[1:34:33] Church taken up rewrapped so it's the
[1:34:37] same
[1:34:42] gift not a different gift it never
[1:34:46] called you and I to be Overcomers and
[1:34:48] then give us something different he said
[1:34:50] be of good cheer for our I have overcome
[1:34:52] the world and the prophet takes that
[1:34:55] verse of scripture in John 16:33 he said
[1:34:57] what Jesus was saying there is I took
[1:35:00] the holy ghost in my body and I overcame
[1:35:03] by it and so shall
[1:35:06] you because what was it it was the Holy
[1:35:09] Spirit quickening the word and it was
[1:35:13] the word living out it was the truth
[1:35:16] living
[1:35:19] out oh my
[1:35:22] and now let me just trying to move here
[1:35:25] just just in these things
[1:35:28] here let me say it like
[1:35:32] this will only live as deep as what
[1:35:35] you're beholding right that's
[1:35:39] good in other words you're only
[1:35:42] challenged to what you're
[1:35:46] beholding and giving yourself
[1:35:49] too you see you can be beh hold it we
[1:35:51] can behold it and go
[1:35:54] away remember the Bible J James speaks
[1:35:56] of this we don't want to be hearers of
[1:35:58] the word and but notice what it says
[1:36:00] deceiving our own selves how could that
[1:36:03] be how could being a hearer be a
[1:36:05] deceiver of our own
[1:36:08] selves how can that be we're beholding
[1:36:12] something and our understanding of what
[1:36:15] we think and we're walking by
[1:36:17] understanding instead of by Divine
[1:36:20] expression
[1:36:22] oh I understand this now or I understand
[1:36:25] the godhead or I understand serpent SE
[1:36:27] or I oh yeah here is we talking about
[1:36:29] the New Birth again
[1:36:31] what that's the greatest event to ever
[1:36:35] take place in your
[1:36:36] life of the new birth and it's on the
[1:36:39] new birth that there is a growth to take
[1:36:41] place in our life let me tell you none
[1:36:44] one of us nobody's going anywhere
[1:36:46] without every child of God coming into
[1:36:49] that place of a real genuine
[1:36:52] birth and God also wants to break any
[1:36:56] imagination that would be around our
[1:36:58] lives of thinking we have something when
[1:37:00] we don't have
[1:37:02] it Hallelujah understand me that the
[1:37:04] Holy Spirit itself when we're looking at
[1:37:06] it it's deeper than just a good clean
[1:37:09] moral
[1:37:11] life that's wonderful but the prophet
[1:37:13] said that's why this is the most
[1:37:15] deceptive age he said because people can
[1:37:18] live good morality above drinking above
[1:37:21] smoking above all those other things but
[1:37:23] not having the personal life of Jesus
[1:37:27] Christ and you would say well what would
[1:37:29] be the personal life of Jesus Christ
[1:37:32] well what did the life of Jesus Christ
[1:37:33] do in the body called Jesus I only do
[1:37:36] those things which please the father
[1:37:38] that's right I must be about my father's
[1:37:41] business I have not come to this earth
[1:37:42] to do my own will but the will of him
[1:37:44] that sent me that's he was more
[1:37:47] connected and aware of the other realm
[1:37:50] than he was in this realm he walked in
[1:37:53] this realm that's true but he lived by
[1:37:56] the other
[1:37:57] realm that's what the Holy Spirit does
[1:38:00] to you as a Believer that's why when
[1:38:03] John saw the holy city coming down he
[1:38:06] saw it coming down as a bride
[1:38:10] prepared what was he saying that now the
[1:38:13] coming of the Holy Spirit it lives out
[1:38:16] in the delegates of that City
[1:38:19] Hallelujah here amen in this Earth as it
[1:38:23] will be
[1:38:25] there Samuel that's challeng it should
[1:38:28] there should be a challenging to live
[1:38:29] deeper we want to become what we're
[1:38:31] beholding this message was not just
[1:38:33] meant to be something that we gather
[1:38:35] around and hold hands and dance around
[1:38:37] it like dancing around the fire and
[1:38:39] glory to God God sent a message but
[1:38:41] behold what he has sent behold I want
[1:38:43] all that God has for my life there's
[1:38:47] more that I don't want things to crowd
[1:38:50] him out I want want to make more room
[1:38:51] for
[1:38:54] him I don't want to be one to say I got
[1:38:56] enough
[1:38:58] Jesus it's kind of like you know when
[1:39:00] they come around the restaurant you just
[1:39:02] no no more no more not enough I don't
[1:39:04] want no more no no I want
[1:39:08] more I want
[1:39:10] more am if my cup overflows overflow it
[1:39:14] Hallelujah overflow it Lord that's
[1:39:16] overwhelm me because I I'm not the one
[1:39:18] that brings the word to pass but oh let
[1:39:20] me just give myself to you Lord that the
[1:39:22] word will come to pass in my life notice
[1:39:25] this this in Acts
[1:39:27] 19 if I can just refer to these couple
[1:39:29] places because I want to get to one one
[1:39:30] last Point here was in Acts 19 here the
[1:39:34] Paul when the Bible says Paul had passed
[1:39:37] through uh EP Ephesus now remember
[1:39:40] Ephesus ends up being one of the real uh
[1:39:44] group of Believers that were very very
[1:39:46] matured with things he didn't have to
[1:39:48] talk to them about gifts I had to talk
[1:39:50] to him on how to act his husbands and
[1:39:52] wives right had to work with them on
[1:39:55] domestic things of life God knows how
[1:39:59] to adoption of sons God said adoption of
[1:40:03] sons act like an adopted son at
[1:40:07] home woo
[1:40:09] my see that's that's God speaking to you
[1:40:12] and I helps us to act and move within
[1:40:14] that realm where we need to be God help
[1:40:17] us here where they were have you receiv
[1:40:20] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:40:23] believed and they said unto him we've
[1:40:25] not beheld
[1:40:27] that we've not beheld that well what do
[1:40:30] you mean well I you know we can only
[1:40:33] live as high as what we're
[1:40:34] hearing we we haven't heard that but
[1:40:37] they were living all that they had
[1:40:41] heard you see one thing they were doing
[1:40:44] what they had beheld they had been
[1:40:46] giving themselves to it because when it
[1:40:48] came time for another step they were
[1:40:49] ready to make that next step
[1:40:52] is that right that's the same thing God
[1:40:54] works within our life to where we become
[1:40:57] what we're beholding now Paul makes
[1:40:59] known to them hey Jesus indeed is the
[1:41:03] Christ but I want you to understand what
[1:41:06] God has done in Christ that has been
[1:41:09] offered up the sacrifice and the Holy
[1:41:12] Ghost has
[1:41:14] come so it was no longer just beholding
[1:41:17] him out here just beholding and
[1:41:20] fellowship and talking about all the all
[1:41:23] the things you know of Jesus is the
[1:41:25] Christ and this quote goes with this
[1:41:27] quote and this scripture goes with this
[1:41:28] scripture and this one goes here and I
[1:41:31] can prove this here
[1:41:32] no let's see what's beneath it
[1:41:36] hallelujah amen let's see what's beneath
[1:41:39] it God doesn't need a group of
[1:41:41] collective Minds getting together to
[1:41:44] Hash things out that's why the Holy
[1:41:46] Ghost has
[1:41:48] come God has given the Holy Ghost goes
[1:41:51] to his church so it's not one man
[1:41:53] leading another man by another man's
[1:41:56] idea and then it just becomes instead of
[1:41:59] the birth of Christ it becomes another
[1:42:01] that person come on we've had that
[1:42:03] enough already we do not want to we do
[1:42:06] not want to give birth to personalities
[1:42:08] the only person that we want to see
[1:42:11] glorified and raised in our midst in our
[1:42:14] lives is Jesus
[1:42:18] Christ Hallelujah the Simplicity of it
[1:42:22] to think of how they were
[1:42:25] beholding now what they beheld they
[1:42:28] become but Paul had to take them back to
[1:42:31] that original sign that's why the
[1:42:33] brother Bram could make this statement
[1:42:36] Bri I don't know if I have this here A
[1:42:38] super sign in
[1:42:39] 1959 paragraph 111 do I have that
[1:42:43] there do I have it or not super sign
[1:42:46] okay I don't I want you to listen to
[1:42:48] this statement here listen the message
[1:42:52] is revived again in the last days the
[1:42:57] message of who he is and what he is you
[1:43:01] catch what he's saying so the message is
[1:43:03] not something new the message is revived
[1:43:08] again it's the original message That's
[1:43:11] what Satan has worked to corrupt what is
[1:43:14] the original message Christ in
[1:43:19] you that's right
[1:43:21] that's the original message but how did
[1:43:23] God revive it look others have the Bible
[1:43:26] have the Bible just like you and I do
[1:43:28] smart men very in intelligent men men
[1:43:32] that know the words and the breakdowns
[1:43:33] and all those other things but the
[1:43:36] message is revived again and God
[1:43:39] revealed it he took a vessel and
[1:43:42] revealed this message through a vessel
[1:43:45] that didn't even have a seventh grade
[1:43:47] education what was being revealed Christ
[1:43:51] what was being made known that this is
[1:43:53] God's objective in our
[1:43:56] life that's that was what it's all about
[1:43:59] great smart men that had studied even
[1:44:02] when brother Bram looking at uh here he
[1:44:04] is in his robed in a white wig calls up
[1:44:06] Jack Mo a great Theologian and Jack said
[1:44:08] well you know that that there his age
[1:44:10] you know he's matured and brother Bram
[1:44:12] said something did not ring
[1:44:17] right it didn't ring right why because
[1:44:22] that itself was a thought of man but
[1:44:25] God's thought was he is the finality he
[1:44:28] is the amen he is the same yesterday
[1:44:31] today and forever he is Alpha and
[1:44:35] Omega it him is complete and supreme
[1:44:41] authority it's Emmanuel dwelling in you
[1:44:44] with the same works that he did
[1:44:46] manifesting himself through you the very
[1:44:48] same things that he did it's the evening
[1:44:51] light yet it's evil spoken of and it's a
[1:44:54] hard
[1:44:57] way brother Bram says it like this go to
[1:45:00] Broken sister 195 uh
[1:45:05] 65 brother Ram's talking about the word
[1:45:08] in you he says nothing can take its
[1:45:10] place it is
[1:45:12] God in the beginning was the word and
[1:45:15] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:45:16] God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:45:18] dwelt Among Us in Hebrews 138 said he is
[1:45:21] the same yesterday today and forever how
[1:45:24] can we rub that away from that it's got
[1:45:27] to be the truth he Remains the Same he
[1:45:30] is the same in every principle listen
[1:45:34] that's the reason you enjoy it you
[1:45:37] Baptist Methodist Catholic and
[1:45:39] Presbyterians you enjoy that presence
[1:45:43] somewhere in you you've accepted God
[1:45:47] maybe sometime in an intellectual way
[1:45:50] maybe maybe you have felt the power of
[1:45:52] God and you're a servant of God but when
[1:45:55] you can really come into God and
[1:45:58] recognize your place in him as a son or
[1:46:00] daughter of God that's what brings that
[1:46:03] great thrill to you that God intended
[1:46:07] you to have amen you see what he's
[1:46:09] saying here in this
[1:46:11] quote it's
[1:46:14] deeper it's deeper than just enjoying
[1:46:17] his
[1:46:19] presence Lord
[1:46:20] it's deeper and he's letting the people
[1:46:24] know listen and I'm not we're not taking
[1:46:26] that away he's bringing it down to this
[1:46:28] place here you enjoy that but God what
[1:46:31] what you are what you are beholding he
[1:46:33] says notice it's to become something
[1:46:36] greater than just any intellectual way
[1:46:39] of feeling God's power and maybe you're
[1:46:42] a servant of God but when you can really
[1:46:44] come into God to where you recognize
[1:46:47] your place in him as a son and daughter
[1:46:48] of God that's what brings that great
[1:46:51] thrill to you that's the joy that's the
[1:46:54] subtleness that's the satisfaction
[1:46:56] that's the foundation that's the
[1:46:58] foundation place where God lays that
[1:47:00] foundation in your life that's the real
[1:47:02] thrill when you recognize I'm a son and
[1:47:04] daughter of God so now what you have
[1:47:07] beheld you have
[1:47:10] become now let me just let me just shift
[1:47:13] this here just a moment so that becoming
[1:47:15] more like him because I have to cover
[1:47:17] the breath of everything that's here
[1:47:19] becoming more like him it's letting God
[1:47:21] go deeper in your life no matter where
[1:47:24] you're at in your journey right remember
[1:47:27] God you can let God in as your savior
[1:47:31] that's the only further he'll go if you
[1:47:33] don't open up other
[1:47:36] doors so good brother Bram takes this he
[1:47:40] says you have to go from the door of
[1:47:44] Pride he says then he says here he says
[1:47:47] from That Door of Faith he said then he
[1:47:49] said here you find
[1:47:51] that Pride so he keeps on going from
[1:47:53] door to door what is it Avenues areas in
[1:47:56] our life that God is working God is
[1:48:00] moving God is taking over it's becoming
[1:48:03] more and more like him we sometimes I
[1:48:07] think that when brother Bram talks about
[1:48:09] how the spirit in this last days he said
[1:48:11] I think he said that it has been so
[1:48:14] underestimated of this Spirit the pre he
[1:48:17] calls it the pressure of this age of of
[1:48:20] of soft Easy Living that everything has
[1:48:22] to be so easy easy So Soft just hand it
[1:48:26] to me God just give it to me just give
[1:48:29] it to me but you see it comes down to
[1:48:35] remember when things didn't happen the
[1:48:37] way they thought it should happen they
[1:48:40] went away and went fishing again they
[1:48:41] were bewildered but he came and gathered
[1:48:45] them how did he gather them by the
[1:48:47] Fulfillment of the word not according
[1:48:50] according to their thoughts about things
[1:48:52] so many times the things that is so
[1:48:55] lacked and I'm not I'm not putting
[1:48:56] anything on on a person down but I want
[1:48:58] you to understand faith is the very
[1:49:00] thing that governs and I say oh God let
[1:49:02] your spirit come and energize Faith In
[1:49:04] Hearts let it energize faith in life to
[1:49:07] where you realize God has never thrown
[1:49:10] in the towel on
[1:49:13] you God has never said that's it I've
[1:49:17] dealt with you service after service
[1:49:19] I've dealt with you here I've dealt with
[1:49:20] you here I put roadblock here road block
[1:49:22] that's not God that's how we respond
[1:49:27] sometimes had responded okay is when we
[1:49:30] come to a place where it didn't happen
[1:49:32] this way but listen remember the thing
[1:49:34] we want is the
[1:49:36] truth the truth and the truth comes to
[1:49:40] make us free from what the
[1:49:43] [Applause]
[1:49:46] lie and it comes in such Simplicity a
[1:49:49] small package
[1:49:54] now I'm coming down here I want to just
[1:49:57] leave these last few words when looking
[1:49:58] upon this
[1:50:02] here as Paul said we have been born we
[1:50:04] have born the Earthly image this is just
[1:50:06] from my heart now let us bear the
[1:50:09] Heavenly image and the true image of God
[1:50:12] is to receive his life and be
[1:50:13] transformed to become a new creation in
[1:50:16] Christ Jesus where all things have
[1:50:18] become new and the old things are pass
[1:50:20] passed away and Paul would go on to say
[1:50:23] that I may know him in the power of his
[1:50:25] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[1:50:28] sufferings being made conformable to his
[1:50:32] death Paul would go on to say that we
[1:50:34] are being changed from Glory unto Glory
[1:50:38] even by the spirit of the Lord as we are
[1:50:40] beholding his face in an open
[1:50:45] glass to become what we are
[1:50:49] beholding Hallelujah to look into the
[1:50:52] perfect law of
[1:50:53] Liberty satan is all about to try to
[1:50:57] distract our
[1:50:59] vision away from the purpose but what's
[1:51:03] been
[1:51:04] uncovered in this hour what's been taken
[1:51:07] off in this hour what a privilege we
[1:51:10] have to be able to look
[1:51:13] in and see eternal life to be able to
[1:51:17] look and to see Christ in your life to
[1:51:22] be able to recognize I am a Son of God I
[1:51:25] am a daughter of
[1:51:27] God he would go on to say that we're not
[1:51:30] to count ourselves as perfect in other
[1:51:32] words complete but rather to press
[1:51:34] toward the mark of the high calling in
[1:51:36] Christ Jesus and that we are beholding
[1:51:38] and seeking to apprehend which we've
[1:51:40] been apprehended of in other words what
[1:51:42] I'm beholding I want it to
[1:51:45] become what God is saying I want it to
[1:51:47] become in my life I don't want to just
[1:51:50] behold it I want to become what I'm
[1:51:52] beholding we want to be doers of the
[1:51:55] word of God as we're beholding ourselves
[1:51:59] in the mirror of God's word and
[1:52:00] submitting ourselves to the perfect law
[1:52:02] of Liberty the working of the Divine
[1:52:03] love of God to bring to pass every
[1:52:06] promise in our lives from that of the
[1:52:08] new birth to all things to the very
[1:52:11] changing of the atoms of our
[1:52:14] bodies now as a school teacher and you
[1:52:17] would know his parents sister Nita would
[1:52:19] know Mr Maria working in school brother
[1:52:22] the Rocka would know as he worked in the
[1:52:23] school you know the some of the things
[1:52:25] that can burden sometimes that burden
[1:52:28] me people when we had kids and you have
[1:52:32] to you're training you're wanting you
[1:52:34] you things groundwork you're laying in
[1:52:35] for what's coming down the road and
[1:52:37] people are not uh children are not you
[1:52:40] know parents aren't they're keeping them
[1:52:41] out of school they're keeping away from
[1:52:43] this and oh they got this and sometimes
[1:52:44] you get to begin to know hey these these
[1:52:47] excuses I mean this it's it's beyond
[1:52:50] what I what I'm talking about I'm not
[1:52:53] just honing in right now on Church
[1:52:54] attendance I'm honing in on that there
[1:52:57] wasn't something present present to
[1:53:01] really give themselves to
[1:53:03] glean from what was going on and you
[1:53:07] talk about trying to play catch up with
[1:53:08] things trying to catch up here and catch
[1:53:10] up there and catch up there and catch up
[1:53:12] here I'm looking at I'm looking at these
[1:53:15] things of how that in our lives and in
[1:53:18] our walk with God Lord I help me to be
[1:53:22] so shut in with you where the
[1:53:25] distractions and things of this life
[1:53:27] things like even what brother John
[1:53:28] Sanger brought out right here on traps
[1:53:31] beautiful in bringing that out but it
[1:53:33] was more than a beautiful sermon it's
[1:53:36] why it was something to look in our life
[1:53:38] and say God what about my
[1:53:41] life where in my life where where are
[1:53:44] things within my life brother Simon
[1:53:46] you're telling me to put myself so I'm
[1:53:48] not telling you to put yourself anywhere
[1:53:50] but I'm just saying friends that when we
[1:53:51] look at the word of God we want to
[1:53:53] become what we're beholding in other
[1:53:55] words if we're still standing in the
[1:53:58] same place that we were before we're not
[1:54:03] becoming what we're
[1:54:05] beholding and if what you're hearing it
[1:54:09] seems like well this is just right where
[1:54:11] this at I I I I want to hear more but
[1:54:14] listen you've got to become what you're
[1:54:16] beholding and the only way you can
[1:54:19] become what you're beholding you've got
[1:54:21] to be sincere in your approach to
[1:54:24] it you've got to be very serious with oh
[1:54:28] brother Samuel that's just fanaticism
[1:54:30] that's what they
[1:54:31] thought that's what they thought it's
[1:54:34] not
[1:54:35] fanaticism he we owe him our whole
[1:54:39] life everything and all that we
[1:54:43] are can I read you a quote
[1:54:45] here this is kind of a Quantum Leap in
[1:54:48] the message statue of a perfect man but
[1:54:50] I think it' be very fitting I I'm not
[1:54:51] going to read the scriptures I would
[1:54:53] love to perhaps we'll come back to it as
[1:54:55] time but you know as when brother BR
[1:54:57] preaches out out of second Peter 1 verse
[1:55:00] 1- verse 13 you can read it later on but
[1:55:03] I want you to watch how brother Braham
[1:55:05] himself comes to the end of a statue of
[1:55:06] a perfect man and he says I pledge this
[1:55:09] morning to
[1:55:10] him with all my heart that by his help
[1:55:14] and by his grace I pray that I'll seek
[1:55:18] daily with without ceasing until I feel
[1:55:22] every one of these requirements flowing
[1:55:25] in this little old stature of mine till
[1:55:28] I can be a
[1:55:30] manifestation of the living
[1:55:33] Christ
[1:55:35] am see adding two is not I've got this
[1:55:40] now I put this now I put this this is
[1:55:43] where some of the teaching and some of
[1:55:45] the groups have got off to people keep
[1:55:47] falling off falling off on you come
[1:55:49] under under the word for your day but
[1:55:51] the foundation is Faith the foundation
[1:55:55] is the new birth am is that right and
[1:55:59] this is where brother bradam himself I'm
[1:56:00] not going to stop here was one who knew
[1:56:03] the new birth he said I'm not going to
[1:56:04] stop seeking daily until I can see the
[1:56:07] manifestation of the living Christ here
[1:56:10] he says for he became sin like me that I
[1:56:12] might become the righteousness of God he
[1:56:14] took my place Lord let me take his now
[1:56:17] because that's the purpose he died for
[1:56:19] look at this how many will pledge that
[1:56:21] same thing by the grace of God I say
[1:56:24] this morning how many will pledge that
[1:56:25] Lord hallelujah and I I wanted to keep
[1:56:27] adding adding adding I think brother
[1:56:30] Jerry years ago I I love that because we
[1:56:32] you know we've seen that all the time
[1:56:33] the prayer of JZ but I love how how the
[1:56:35] Lord LED brother Jerry to bring that out
[1:56:37] here and brother Jerry he he read that
[1:56:38] scripture and he he come to that part in
[1:56:40] the in the service my it just turned my
[1:56:42] world upside down he said how has japz
[1:56:45] prayed Lord enlarge my borders and the
[1:56:48] Holy Spirit came down through brother
[1:56:49] Jer and said Lord enlarge my character
[1:56:52] enlarge everything enlarge that Christ
[1:56:55] in my life Lord let it grow Lord
[1:56:58] God let it grow let Christ become
[1:57:01] magnified in my life let him grow more
[1:57:03] Lord the power of his resurrection and
[1:57:06] the fellowship the left hand The
[1:57:08] Fellowship of his suffering being made
[1:57:10] conformable unto his
[1:57:12] death I want to grow
[1:57:14] Lord I want to become what I'm beholding
[1:57:17] and I want I want to be locked in I Lord
[1:57:19] give me Grace help me Lord where
[1:57:21] distractions are all around we're in an
[1:57:23] hour We're All Around we're distractions
[1:57:25] but help me to stay focused upon you
[1:57:27] Lord Amen brother brandham says I pledge
[1:57:30] it Lord this church pledges it the full
[1:57:35] stature of Jesus
[1:57:42] Christ there's more room for him
[1:57:47] amen there's more room for him
[1:57:49] and remember the reason they wouldn't
[1:57:52] they didn't give him
[1:57:54] room is because he didn't have any
[1:57:57] room in their
[1:58:01] ideas remember that's what the prophet
[1:58:03] is bringing us to place that
[1:58:05] too so where does making room for him
[1:58:09] begin in our
[1:58:13] thoughts starts right there God told
[1:58:16] Joshua chapter
[1:58:18] 1 meditate on these things right day and
[1:58:22] night then Thou shalt make thy way
[1:58:26] prosperous and of a good
[1:58:29] success it begins with his
[1:58:33] thoughts what does that mean that means
[1:58:35] there's more of God for
[1:58:37] me there's more there's more I want to
[1:58:42] become what I'm beholding Hallelujah I
[1:58:45] want to take the word that I'm hearing
[1:58:47] here this is a very simple application
[1:58:49] but it's very very true I want to take
[1:58:52] the word that I'm hearing and I want to
[1:58:54] pray over it I I rejoice in the word I
[1:58:57] rejoice in his presence that I I I
[1:59:00] rejoice in his presence but the word
[1:59:02] that's coming I take it and to pray over
[1:59:05] it Lord I want to see more of you in
[1:59:09] me if the prophet of God could stand
[1:59:12] here and make that statement until I see
[1:59:14] the manifestation of the living Christ
[1:59:16] in
[1:59:17] me you would think
[1:59:20] why would he be requesting for something
[1:59:21] that's already taking place because
[1:59:23] there's more
[1:59:25] room there's more
[1:59:26] [Applause]
[1:59:29] room there's more room it will require
[1:59:31] more emptying out it'll require digging
[1:59:34] out some areas but God will give us the
[1:59:37] grace amen and Leadership that we need
[1:59:40] and some of that digging out is through
[1:59:43] prayer it isn't anything that we can
[1:59:45] talk out or Reason out it's through
[1:59:47] giving ourselves to the word of of God
[1:59:50] and in prayer as you give yourself to
[1:59:52] the word it isin't about what you feel I
[1:59:54] don't I don't feel anything's happening
[1:59:55] that's not a thought that comes from God
[1:59:58] remember as the word itself is coming
[2:00:00] forth it affects your
[2:00:02] life as you take it and take it into
[2:00:05] your life Lord let my life let my life
[2:00:08] absorb that word let my life assimilate
[2:00:11] to that word like we looked at on
[2:00:12] Thursday night let it just take it in
[2:00:14] Lord just taking him in and becoming
[2:00:18] what we're beholding Hallelujah to where
[2:00:21] we're no longer in the same place where
[2:00:24] we
[2:00:25] were but we're closer to
[2:00:27] him closer to
[2:00:30] him because like I said with those kids
[2:00:32] that sometimes would come to me and
[2:00:34] sister Nita different ones who witnessed
[2:00:36] this too sometimes you realize they had
[2:00:37] been out of school so much or been here
[2:00:39] been there and so many different things
[2:00:42] you had to catch up on previous skills
[2:00:44] and bring them up they had it in other
[2:00:46] words friends what this is the point I'm
[2:00:48] trying to make
[2:00:49] they didn't maintain where they were
[2:00:52] at they actually went
[2:00:55] backwards if you're not going forward
[2:00:58] you're going
[2:01:01] backwards you you you can't stay neutral
[2:01:04] you either move on with God or you're
[2:01:06] going backwards how can I be going
[2:01:08] backwards because if you don't walk in
[2:01:10] the light as he's in the light the light
[2:01:13] passes
[2:01:15] on that's why it's very important to how
[2:01:17] God peeling back and open opening the
[2:01:19] word and we look into it and see him
[2:01:21] Lord in my in every aspect of my
[2:01:25] life God's wanting to do more and in
[2:01:29] their thoughts they had limited him in
[2:01:32] his expression I want to make room for
[2:01:34] him I is continually continually to be
[2:01:38] changed until that final moment when the
[2:01:42] very atoms of this body have been
[2:01:47] changed until that time
[2:01:49] we press
[2:01:51] on until that moment we keep moving
[2:01:55] forward because it's the prize that's
[2:01:57] set before us to become what we're
[2:02:01] beholding God sets the example he sets
[2:02:04] everything a victory before us we don't
[2:02:06] come into a service I I I listen I I
[2:02:09] believe this message is not a I don't
[2:02:11] believe the message of the hour is a
[2:02:12] message of condemnation it's a message
[2:02:14] of Liberty it's a message of Grace it's
[2:02:16] a message that comes to minister courage
[2:02:19] ability and strength and love to you to
[2:02:22] let you know who you are amen and to let
[2:02:24] you know what belongs to you let you
[2:02:26] know what rights you have that you can
[2:02:29] look at that and exercise your rights
[2:02:31] it's a right for you to have the Holy
[2:02:33] Ghost it's right for you to be healed
[2:02:34] it's right for you to be delivered it is
[2:02:37] right it's part of your
[2:02:40] rights God continued to move through our
[2:02:43] lives say God help us amen help me to
[2:02:47] behold the right thing
[2:02:49] help me God stay focused amen and I want
[2:02:53] to become what I'm
[2:02:55] beholding I want to become that Lord I
[2:02:58] want to become that you love
[2:03:01] him amen let's just bow our heads in a
[2:03:03] word of prayer musicans if You'
[2:03:08] come oh
[2:03:11] my amen and amen thank you
[2:03:15] Lord oh thank you Jesus
[2:03:21] I want you to think just even from the
[2:03:22] depths of your heart your
[2:03:28] life maybe that's not a place that maybe
[2:03:32] you've you've come to yet with God but
[2:03:35] you realize God's leading you to to that
[2:03:39] place of his life to have the
[2:03:43] preeminence in you maybe you've enjoyed
[2:03:44] his presence and that's wonderful that's
[2:03:47] wonderful remember you've got to behold
[2:03:49] the right thing in Acts 19 he had to
[2:03:51] take them back and point them show them
[2:03:55] the right thing the prophet said they
[2:03:56] had to recognize that sign first before
[2:03:58] they could receive the Holy
[2:04:01] Ghost to know what it's all
[2:04:06] about I I want you to know right here
[2:04:09] this morning I'm not asking you to look
[2:04:10] for an emotion no no I'm asking you as
[2:04:15] the prophet simply said it in the
[2:04:17] message invisible Union
[2:04:20] he said look for a
[2:04:21] truth from the depths of your
[2:04:25] heart where everything is laid and
[2:04:28] surrendered before
[2:04:31] him as every head is bowed every ey is
[2:04:33] closed I ask you not to be looking
[2:04:37] around but just as you're coming and
[2:04:39] you're looking here and you're
[2:04:44] seeing then you say
[2:04:46] Lord that's what I want in my
[2:04:50] life that's the walk that I want Lord in
[2:04:53] you I want that
[2:04:58] life amen praise the
[2:05:02] Lord maybe there's things that here cuz
[2:05:05] we God has spoke to us on so many
[2:05:08] different levels here this
[2:05:10] morning God's not just spoke to us about
[2:05:13] being born again and then that's that's
[2:05:15] it no it's it's it's to all of us
[2:05:18] becoming what we're
[2:05:20] [Music]
[2:05:22] beholding but I would ask you would you
[2:05:25] would you be
[2:05:28] willing to allow
[2:05:30] God to move into the very thoughts of
[2:05:33] your
[2:05:34] [Music]
[2:05:36] life and let him just travel down every
[2:05:40] area he'll be right there he he doesn't
[2:05:42] Force you there he'll lead you he'll be
[2:05:43] right with you but to say
[2:05:46] Lord like you would do in your heart
[2:05:48] home when you get together and you say
[2:05:50] we got to sort through this stuff we got
[2:05:52] to figure out what needs to
[2:05:56] go would you just say Lord I there's
[2:06:00] things that Lord I know that can crowd
[2:06:02] out in my life your Prophet said there's
[2:06:05] a lot of things that can try to take it
[2:06:06] out of us he said your boss can you can
[2:06:09] let your boss take it out of you you can
[2:06:10] let different things try to take these
[2:06:13] things out of you what God is wanting to
[2:06:15] bring to pass in your life and Satan
[2:06:17] knows just EX exactly so meticulously
[2:06:21] how to plant different things along the
[2:06:24] way to get your focus away from what God
[2:06:27] is calling you to but I believe with
[2:06:30] every one of us in our walk this is a
[2:06:32] personal walk that there's a deeper walk
[2:06:35] for every one of
[2:06:38] us and I'm wondering how many like the
[2:06:40] prophet had said coming to that place of
[2:06:43] a pledge that
[2:06:45] Lord I'm not going to
[2:06:47] stop when I Seek You
[2:06:50] daily without ceasing
[2:06:54] until I see all of these great virtues
[2:06:58] flowing even in a a greater way I I'm
[2:07:01] not coming to a place well I've got all
[2:07:02] the virtue I need I've got all the
[2:07:04] patience I need no no there's more
[2:07:08] there's
[2:07:09] more adversities and circumstances of
[2:07:12] Life lead us to a place of more
[2:07:17] surrender I wonder how many would say
[2:07:20] Lord help me I want to make room for you
[2:07:24] beginning right with my
[2:07:26] thoughts my
[2:07:28] ideas my ideas have have limited you in
[2:07:31] a certain way but I don't want my ideas
[2:07:33] cuz your thoughts are so much higher
[2:07:35] than mine I don't want to limit you Lord
[2:07:38] I want to take the limiters
[2:07:40] off amen God bless you Hallelujah that's
[2:07:45] that's my prayer
[2:07:46] Lord that's my pledge
[2:07:48] [Music]
[2:07:50] L I want to go
[2:07:53] deeper I want to become more what I'm
[2:07:56] beholding Hallelujah because as we walk
[2:08:00] in the
[2:08:01] light more light will be shown to
[2:08:06] us amen God bless you this
[2:08:09] morning can we pray
[2:08:13] together
[2:08:16] Hallelujah Heavenly Father
[2:08:19] L Lord as here we are gathered in your
[2:08:22] presence
[2:08:23] [Music]
[2:08:27] Lord Lord we so appreciate being able to
[2:08:31] see one another as we said in the
[2:08:33] beginning parts of the service it's it's
[2:08:36] just wonderful Lord It's refreshing to
[2:08:38] see different ones Lord all of us Lord
[2:08:41] even there's some now that are not with
[2:08:43] us Lord sickness and other things taking
[2:08:46] place but God how wonderful it is
[2:08:49] to just be
[2:08:52] together as brothers and
[2:08:54] sisters and Lord as much as we we love
[2:08:57] one another and we cherish these moments
[2:08:59] that we can come
[2:09:01] together and it's vital for our lives
[2:09:03] it's so important Lord more than I
[2:09:06] believe that we lord can even
[2:09:14] realize but Lord we've not we've not
[2:09:17] come with the with the main
[2:09:19] purpose to see one
[2:09:22] another we come here with a
[2:09:25] purpose to see
[2:09:29] you we want to behold you
[2:09:33] Lord Lord that the word itself would
[2:09:38] speak speak to each of Our Lives to
[2:09:41] every need that's
[2:09:44] here that the word Lord
[2:09:47] would ch challenge us and encourage
[2:09:52] us go deeper
[2:09:55] Lord Lord going deeper isn't so much us
[2:09:57] walking from this room to that room as
[2:10:00] it is you us surrendering and you going
[2:10:06] deeper in our
[2:10:09] lives Lord even as we stand here this
[2:10:13] morning there's needs Lord that are
[2:10:16] throughout the building hearts that Lord
[2:10:19] that God were requests have been offered
[2:10:20] up that
[2:10:21] lord said that's that's the life that I
[2:10:25] want that's the life that I want I I
[2:10:28] want that substance I want that life
[2:10:30] that's that's what I want
[2:10:33] Lord now father that required faith in
[2:10:37] order to raise that hand to defy a law
[2:10:40] of gravity Grace has given to rise above
[2:10:44] law and they Lord have accepted that
[2:10:47] Lord
[2:10:48] now I ask oh God that as they would just
[2:10:52] keep their eyes on
[2:10:55] you you will do for them Lord you can do
[2:11:00] it right here in this moment you can do
[2:11:03] it in the next
[2:11:04] moment but God I'm asking Lord that may
[2:11:08] such a Grace and determination so set
[2:11:11] upon their hearts and their
[2:11:13] lives from this moment forward
[2:11:16] Lord they'll not take their eyes off of
[2:11:19] you
[2:11:20] Lord to that thrill to that joy to that
[2:11:25] peace has come into their lives and they
[2:11:28] can see
[2:11:29] you living through them
[2:11:33] Lord and I'm asking Lord that for every
[2:11:36] one of us Lord that are
[2:11:39] here sometimes Lord our ideas that's
[2:11:41] what gets in the
[2:11:43] way Lord all of
[2:11:47] us
[2:11:48] our
[2:11:52] ideas
[2:11:53] Lord if your Prophet could stand there
[2:11:56] in 1965 at the close of his ministry one
[2:12:01] of the last messages he would preach on
[2:12:03] the wings of a snow white dove and he
[2:12:06] could speak about that experience at
[2:12:08] Eagle
[2:12:10] Rock and he would speak regarding the
[2:12:13] word that's been opened in this hour and
[2:12:16] say to you in prayer that we could hear
[2:12:19] it
[2:12:21] Lord you have led me to a
[2:12:24] faith like I never had
[2:12:28] before Lord that's an
[2:12:32] example for my life for our
[2:12:35] lives that you've come to lead
[2:12:39] us to a place to where our faith greater
[2:12:43] than what it is
[2:12:47] now every every aspect of our life lord
[2:12:50] it's not looking for great big glamorous
[2:12:53] things it's it's in the simple things
[2:12:55] you coming in Lord and moving through
[2:12:57] every channel and every thought of our
[2:12:59] life Lord we want to make room for
[2:13:03] you in the simple things of life that
[2:13:06] we're every because why in our thoughts
[2:13:09] that's where decisions are made is in
[2:13:10] the
[2:13:11] mind where Lord God to where we even
[2:13:15] begin with that place say Lord
[2:13:19] let my life let my mind be filled with
[2:13:22] your
[2:13:25] thoughts that the decisions that I make
[2:13:28] it leads it leads me closer to you
[2:13:31] because I can't go
[2:13:33] forward and backward at the same time
[2:13:36] but I want to go
[2:13:38] forward I want to go
[2:13:40] forward I want to press
[2:13:42] on I want that word to continue to work
[2:13:45] and the maturity and every bit of the
[2:13:48] greenness being baked out of my life I
[2:13:49] want to become more and more and more
[2:13:52] and more in the image of Jesus
[2:13:55] Christ Lord the desire in our
[2:14:00] hearts I think Lord of how that the
[2:14:02] prophet when there could be others Lord
[2:14:05] that they would
[2:14:07] look they would mistake things things
[2:14:10] that would be
[2:14:13] said but to think Lord how that brother
[2:14:15] brandham when he sat there and it had
[2:14:17] troubled sister
[2:14:19] da she couldn't figure out why are
[2:14:21] people saying brother Brown why are
[2:14:23] these people calling you Jesus Christ
[2:14:25] why are they saying
[2:14:27] this brother Bram Lord as he took that
[2:14:29] CU it's also in questions and answer 64
[2:14:32] there but he took that very thing he
[2:14:34] said that's it's not right it's a spirit
[2:14:37] that's there he said but if it wasn't so
[2:14:40] close as that I would doubt my
[2:14:45] Ministry oh
[2:14:46] God
[2:14:50] [Music]
[2:14:52] it's not Lord us walk it's not in these
[2:14:56] things sometimes in our
[2:14:57] ideas that we have we limit you in our
[2:15:04] ideas but may we recognize it's
[2:15:08] Christ help us Lord It's Christ Living
[2:15:11] out his own life through our
[2:15:15] lives through the vocation of life that
[2:15:18] he's called you to it's Christ Living
[2:15:20] out his own life his word through your
[2:15:26] life
[2:15:29] Lord not something that we have to make
[2:15:32] ourselves but may we lord just just
[2:15:34] surrendering to
[2:15:35] you becoming what we're beholding

[2:16:13] in the light then as you walk in that
[2:16:16] watch more light open and
[2:16:21] unfold that's our desire isn't

[2:17:32] him in prayer just pressing and putting
[2:17:34] on a tape and taking in the message and

[2:17:44] on the word and and here you are you're

[2:32:41] [Music]
[2:32:45] on
[2:32:50] I want you to think about this as we
[2:32:51] prepare to
[2:32:53] go sometimes our our thoughts and our
[2:32:57] minds we're talking about becoming what
[2:33:00] we're
[2:33:01] beholding it's not about what we're
[2:33:03] doing as far as us doing or us making it
[2:33:07] happen it's about us
[2:33:10] yielding in his
[2:33:12] presence because the disciples
[2:33:17] could
[2:33:18] not bring to pass what they were
[2:33:22] beholding with the resurrected Messiah
[2:33:25] but he pointed them where to go and
[2:33:29] T and they went and they were
[2:33:32] endued with power from on
[2:33:35] high H how did they go there they went
[2:33:37] there as yielded
[2:33:39] vessels so then in Acts 19 how did that
[2:33:43] happen yielded vessel
[2:33:47] because we've all been there we've all
[2:33:49] even been in areas of our life where
[2:33:51] here the word is coming to pass and we
[2:33:53] want to see the word come to p and then
[2:33:54] we we we look at it as though it's
[2:33:56] something that we've got to do or I've
[2:33:58] got no it's what we're yielding
[2:33:59] ourselves to that's why we want to
[2:34:03] behold and know that Satan is interested
[2:34:06] in
[2:34:07] distracting that's like where a person
[2:34:09] who is sick in their body remember
[2:34:11] brother brandom talked about here you're
[2:34:13] prayed for and he says all of a sudden
[2:34:15] he says you get worse the tumor and
[2:34:18] everything swells up and immediately at
[2:34:21] that moment everything comes around I'm
[2:34:24] not any better I'm worse I feel worse
[2:34:26] today than I did before he said that's
[2:34:28] the best sign of your
[2:34:32] healing see is what we're beholding and
[2:34:35] yielding to that word regardless of what
[2:34:37] my senses say regardless of any other
[2:34:40] thought regardless of anything let every
[2:34:43] man's word be a lie and God's word be
[2:34:47] true yes sir and that's simple yielding
[2:34:49] to the word of God even as we're taking
[2:34:51] and we're meditating on the word of God
[2:34:54] when you are in a moment that you may
[2:34:56] not feel as a very spiritual moment and
[2:34:58] here you are working and walking through
[2:34:59] the factory walking through the store
[2:35:01] and you're meditating on the things of
[2:35:03] God you know what's happening you're
[2:35:04] yielding that's good so good sometimes
[2:35:08] you don't don't expect things to all of
[2:35:10] a sudden it' BEC coming saying pow
[2:35:11] things are happening just like that no
[2:35:13] no it's little by little amen from Glory
[2:35:18] unto
[2:35:20] Glory just say it like this Lord I'm

[2:35:37] and that's the thrill that's in your
[2:35:39] heart as a Believer to
