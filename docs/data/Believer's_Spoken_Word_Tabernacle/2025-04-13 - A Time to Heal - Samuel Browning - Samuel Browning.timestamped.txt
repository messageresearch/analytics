[35:54] Oh, because it
[35:58] reaches to the
[36:01] highest mountain.
[36:05] Oh, thank you, Jesus. Yes,
[36:08] [Music]
[36:12] it
[36:13] [Music]
[36:15] was
[36:17] all the love that gives me strength from
[36:24] [Applause]
[36:25] day to
[36:33] day. It's my
[36:36] soul. It
[36:38] suits. Yes, it
[36:41] suits my
[36:43] doubts. Oh,
[36:46] yes.
[36:48] [Music]
[36:52] My same
[36:55] blood
[36:57] drive my tears.
[37:00] The
[37:01] love that gives me
[37:04] strength from
[37:07] day to
[37:09] day and you will
[37:17] never
[37:21] heaven
[37:23] reaches to the
[37:26] highest mountain.
[37:32] It
[37:33] flows through the
[37:42] Lord. Oh, that gives me
[37:46] strength from
[37:49] this day to day. And he will
[37:54] never
[37:56] lose his
[38:01] power. His sin will
[38:04] [Applause]
[38:08] [Music]
[38:11] never lose.
[38:15] [Music]
[38:18] never
[38:19] lose its
[38:21] [Music]
[38:24] power.
[38:27] Hallelujah.
[38:29] Hallelujah.
[38:32] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[38:35] Amen. We're living witnesses of that,
[38:37] aren't we? Amen. In this in this day and
[38:41] age and time that we live in, yet God is
[38:44] still the same God. He does the same. He
[38:47] does the same that he's always done. His
[38:49] nature's never changed. His words never
[38:52] changed. Amen. The victory is still the
[38:55] same. Amen. Everything around, we know
[38:59] that there's nothing new under the sun.
[39:00] We know we're living in a time like it
[39:03] was as in the days of Lot and and Noah
[39:05] and the conditions and where everything
[39:07] was. But you know, God made a promise
[39:09] and he's kept his promise in this hour
[39:12] that he would make himself known as the
[39:15] revealing of the son of man. Not just a
[39:18] portion, but God in his fullness.
[39:22] That the God of glory who came down and
[39:25] created a blood cell and a body
[39:29] and stepped into it to redeem you and I.
[39:32] Amen. Now that redemption has been done,
[39:36] what he showed back there to Abraham,
[39:39] when he picked up dust, blew it, and
[39:41] stepped into it, it was not the dust.
[39:44] The prophet said, the dust went back to
[39:45] the earth, but it was what God did
[39:47] through that dust. And now through and
[39:49] by the redemption that's come through
[39:52] Calvary, through the Holy Ghost, now
[39:55] that same son of man, he came back down
[39:58] through, he took a body
[40:03] Amen. That seventh angel messenger and
[40:06] he spoke through a redeemed vessel.
[40:10] That's it. And let me say this, he
[40:14] didn't leave his body.
[40:17] It is now Christ in you the hope of
[40:20] glory.
[40:22] Glory is the power of redemption.
[40:25] That's how powerful redemption is. It's
[40:27] not by your works. It's not by your
[40:30] worthiness. It shows you the power of
[40:33] redemption that it's God who workketh
[40:36] within you.
[40:38] Oh my. Oh my. Then what situations too
[40:40] hard for him?
[40:42] What's too great for the Lord?
[40:45] Oh my. Amen.
[40:49] Amen. We certainly love you this morning
[40:51] and so good to be in the house of the
[40:53] Lord. And
[40:55] uh if Brother Carlos, were you able to

[42:26] things in the Lord. Amen. Amen. And so
[42:30] Amen. Let's just can we approach him in
[42:31] a word of prayer? Amen. And let's just
[42:35] put our needs before him. Amen. And
[42:39] whatever that you might even feel like
[42:41] that you're overwhelmed. You might feel
[42:42] like this is too great and it is for
[42:45] you. It would be for me and it is for
[42:47] more mortal man. But nothing's too great
[42:50] for God. And if we can just invite him
[42:52] in this way and say, Lord, just let me
[42:54] see you in your glory. Let me see you as
[42:57] a mighty conqueror for this need.
[43:01] Heavenly
[43:03] Father, Lord, as
[43:05] we approach your throne through the
[43:09] grace that's been provided for us
[43:11] through the name of our Lord Jesus
[43:15] Christ. Lord, we're so thankful for this
[43:19] privilege and
[43:20] opportunity. Now, Lord, there's there's
[43:22] needs and requests, Lord, that have
[43:25] already been taken up before you in
[43:27] prayer.
[43:28] And there's needs upon the hearts that
[43:30] Lord that are
[43:33] unspoken
[43:35] situations, things that Lord
[43:37] that are beyond that of Lord a mortal to
[43:43] another
[43:44] mortal. But Lord, we're looking beyond
[43:47] that and we're asking that you would
[43:50] just give us
[43:51] grace to be able to see you high and
[43:55] lifted up, Lord. Yes. to be able to see
[43:58] you, the mighty conqueror. Lord,
[44:03] grant it. Lord, we're we're inviting
[44:05] you. We're welcoming you. We're desiring
[44:08] that you would anoint
[44:11] our eyes, Lord. Anoint our faith. Anoint
[44:15] our hearts, oh God. Anoint us to
[44:19] hear. Cause us to see you, Lord, and to
[44:23] see whatever the situation might be. May
[44:27] we see it under your feet,
[44:29] Lord. Father, we ask that you'll just
[44:32] minister
[44:33] now to our needs. We just, Lord, give
[44:37] ourselves to you. Ask that you would
[44:39] have preeminence in this service and we
[44:43] ask it for the glory of God in Jesus
[44:46] name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen.
[44:50] Could we turn in um the scriptures and
[44:54] I'd like to go to Luke chapter 10. I'm
[44:57] going to couple places to uh read from
[45:01] but we'll read from here and then I'll
[45:02] let you have your
[45:06] seats. So good to be gathered together
[45:10] and
[45:15] then amen.
[45:18] In verse 30 of Luke chapter
[45:22] 10, and Jesus answering said, "A certain
[45:27] man." You find that very interesting in
[45:30] the scripture. God puts names where he
[45:32] wants to put names. And we also
[45:35] understand that at times when names are
[45:37] placed, those names are also it's a
[45:39] type. Like John was a type of the bride.
[45:42] Elisha is a type of the bride. But then
[45:44] you have places like this, just like it
[45:46] says in Luke chapter 24, that two of
[45:49] them walk together, Cleopius and a
[45:53] friend. And I I love those places
[45:56] because you know why? That's a space for
[45:59] my name.
[46:02] Amen. It's a space for your name.
[46:05] A certain man, not just anybody, a
[46:07] certain man went down from Jerusalem to
[46:13] Jericho. So he was going from a high
[46:15] place to a low place and fell among
[46:19] thieves which stripped him of his
[46:22] reignment and wounded him and departed
[46:26] leaving him half dead. And by chance
[46:28] there came, sorry, and by chance there
[46:31] came down a certain priest that way. And
[46:34] when he saw him, he passed by on the
[46:37] other side. And likewise, a Levite when
[46:41] he was at the place came and looked on
[46:43] him and passed by on the other side. But
[46:47] a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed,
[46:50] came where he was, and when he saw him,
[46:54] he had compassion on him. Now I want you
[46:56] just to take just for a
[46:58] moment. Jesus is rehearsing this even
[47:02] within the context of what he was asked.
[47:06] Who is my
[47:07] neighbor? And to understand that whoever
[47:10] our neighbor is, it's one that we see
[47:12] that's in need. And I want to just say
[47:15] it to you in this way.
[47:18] this. When you think of this, there's no
[47:21] one that could really see our need like
[47:25] God.
[47:28] And God became kin folks to us.
[47:32] Amen. We were always a part of him, but
[47:34] God came down and became one of us.
[47:38] And he wasn't just wasn't just going
[47:40] anywhere. He was going for a certain
[47:43] man. He was coming for a certain people.
[47:46] Right? Are you with me? Knew exactly
[47:48] where we were at. And notice the most
[47:52] unlikely place or vessel that would seem
[47:55] that help would come from a certain
[47:58] Samaritan.
[48:00] Samaritans were looked at as the
[48:02] offcast. And how can this be? That's
[48:04] right. But you see, God chose chose and
[48:07] he still chooses to hide himself in
[48:09] simplicity.
[48:12] Sometimes the very answer that we're
[48:13] looking for doesn't come in the form
[48:16] that maybe we're looking for. But if
[48:18] we'll just look to him, God will bring
[48:20] the answer in the form. And what we want
[48:23] to be able to say is, God, let me look
[48:24] beyond the veil to see you. Let me
[48:27] recognize your presence. Amen. Notice
[48:30] and went to him. He had saw him. He had
[48:33] compassion on him. and went to him and
[48:37] bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and
[48:41] wine, and set him on his own beast, and
[48:46] brought him to an inn, and took care of
[48:49] him. And on the tomorrow when he
[48:51] departed, he took out two pence, and
[48:54] gave them to the host, and said unto
[48:56] him, Take care of him, and whatsoever
[48:58] thou spendest more, when I come again, I
[49:02] will repay thee. Amen. May God bless you
[49:04] and bless the reading of the word. As
[49:06] you're being seated, I'm going to pull
[49:08] one more scripture here before we move
[49:12] on into this. Out of the book of
[49:15] Ecclesiastes, the scripture says, "To
[49:18] everything there is a
[49:22] season and a time to every purpose under
[49:26] the heaven. A time to be born, a time to
[49:29] die, time to plant, time to pluck up
[49:32] that which is planted, a time to kill, a
[49:35] time to heal, a time to break down, and
[49:38] a time to build up. And I want to focus
[49:41] upon that phrase within there and speak
[49:44] this morning on this thought, a time to
[49:46] heal. And so when we come into our our
[49:51] reading of our text here this morning, I
[49:54] want you to watch how brother Brandham
[49:56] places this when he speaks of that of
[49:58] the Samaritan because uh so often we and
[50:02] it's a phrase that can be used and has
[50:04] been used uh many times sometimes even
[50:07] by individuals is not even Bible readers
[50:09] and they will uh lay this title upon
[50:13] someone who maybe has done something
[50:14] good uh warm fuzzy something that's and
[50:17] done good for somebody else and they'll
[50:18] say, "Oh, it's a good you're a good
[50:20] Samaritan." But there's a much deeper
[50:22] meaning to this because I want you to
[50:24] understand that when we look at this
[50:26] this parable in the scripture, it's
[50:28] actually a parable of redemption that
[50:30] speaks of you and I because the in in
[50:33] reality is is that when we consider
[50:36] this, brother Bram says Jesus found a
[50:39] man one time in a parable. He was on his
[50:42] road from Jericho or from Jerusalem to
[50:45] Jericho. It showed he was backsliding.
[50:48] He was going from up on high and going
[50:51] down low. He was backsliding and he met
[50:55] him on the road and an enemy had beaten
[50:58] him and robbed him and left him half
[51:01] dead. That was physically alive but
[51:04] spiritually dead. That is so good. The
[51:07] priests and the Levites and so forth
[51:09] passed him. But the good Samaritan, as
[51:12] Jesus taught it, came, picked him up,
[51:15] poured oil in and wine, and taken him to
[51:18] the inn. And brother Brandon says,
[51:20] "That's there's the place that I want to
[51:24] get you to." He taken him to the inn and
[51:27] said to the caretaker, "Take care of
[51:30] him." He gave him a couple of pennies or
[51:33] whatever it was to pay his way and said,
[51:35] "Now, if he needs any more, just go
[51:37] ahead and take care of him. I'll make it
[51:40] right when I come. Brother Bram says,
[51:43] "And you shepherds, God give you the
[51:45] spirit and the word to take care of
[51:47] these wounded ones that's been brought
[51:49] in. If you need any more, he'll take
[51:52] care of that when he comes. So just feed
[51:57] those sheep."
[51:59] Now, we understand this when we look
[52:01] here in the scripture that this is more,
[52:04] as we said, than just someone doing a
[52:08] good deed. But everywhere everywhere
[52:10] through the scripture when we read the
[52:12] scriptures and our eyes are open to it
[52:16] we should be able to see Jesus Christ in
[52:20] every portion of the scripture because
[52:23] this in itself it's a book of redemption
[52:26] and so all the way through we can see uh
[52:29] God's God's mercy we can see the
[52:32] redemptive plan of God we can see the
[52:35] first coming we can also see the hour
[52:37] that we're standing in when the seven
[52:40] seals have been open, we can see it all
[52:42] the way from Genesis 1 all the way to
[52:44] Revelation. It's types that's spoken all
[52:48] the way through there. And so when we're
[52:50] looking here in this scripture that it's
[52:52] something much deeper and when we God
[52:55] gives us grace to be able to look
[52:57] deeper, it's not through our uh
[53:00] ingenuity, but it's the inspiration of
[53:02] God that would help us to look deeper in
[53:05] the word of God that our our thoughts
[53:07] and our objectives just become deepened.
[53:10] And so Jesus himself, he places himself
[53:13] as the one who actually catches the
[53:15] sinner, the backslider, the downtrodden,
[53:18] the brokenhearted, and ministers to them
[53:21] and carries them to the place of the inn
[53:24] in order for them to be fully cured.
[53:28] That's so good. You see the others, the
[53:29] others walked away from him. The the
[53:31] priest, when the priest seen him, the
[53:33] priest realized, I there's nothing I can
[53:35] do with this. And he also didn't want to
[53:38] defile himself. Then you had of the
[53:40] scribe. The scribe looked at the
[53:42] situation and said, "This situation is
[53:44] too great. I don't want to I don't want
[53:46] to get entangled with this. This is this
[53:48] is too much for me." But you know, the
[53:50] very reputation of the Lord Jesus is
[53:54] made with situations that man looks at
[53:58] and says, "There's no hope.
[54:01] That's impossible.
[54:03] I don't want to get involved in that.
[54:05] That would that would defile me." Let me
[54:08] tell you his reputation is made with
[54:11] that.
[54:13] You know when you think of how that the
[54:16] word comes and it picks up our lives.
[54:18] You know when we look at this I I want
[54:20] to just say this here that when the
[54:23] message of the hours it comes across our
[54:25] path and the spirit of God sweeps across
[54:27] our lives. We all come from different
[54:30] backgrounds. We all come sometimes we
[54:32] may have all kinds of brokenness and so
[54:35] forth that we come from. But let me just
[54:36] say this to you. One of the things that
[54:39] just really exemplifies the glory and
[54:42] the power of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[54:45] through the message of the hour is that
[54:47] no situation is beyond hope.
[54:53] No situation,
[54:56] nothing is beyond the redeeming grace of
[54:58] almighty God. Why? Because God knows
[55:02] what is beneath the darkness that was in
[55:05] our life. That's what he came to raise
[55:08] up. That's why that the light and the
[55:10] water came of of to raise up that seed.
[55:14] Not to warm the dirt, not to quicken the
[55:16] dirt, but to quicken the seed. And then
[55:19] when the seed is quickened, this dirt
[55:21] will respond to the quickening power
[55:23] that's taking place in our life. So here
[55:26] here he stands. And you know, God
[55:28] specializes in this. He specializes in
[55:31] things that you know when we look at it,
[55:33] we can look at a situation and we can
[55:36] try to figure it out and how do I make
[55:38] this work and how can I do this and you
[55:41] know sometimes I believe in the best of
[55:43] our intentions we we always want to be
[55:45] led by the spirit of God but sometimes
[55:48] there's things where we God has to bring
[55:50] us to reality is that you know it's
[55:53] going to take the supernatural. It's
[55:55] going to take more. Yes, there's things
[55:57] that as far as we can do within
[55:59] ourselves, but this is what we always
[56:01] want to be. We want to be a channel that
[56:03] the Holy Spirit is free to move through.
[56:06] This is why, let me just say this to
[56:08] you. This is why when Paul would write
[56:10] to fathers and he would speak about even
[56:12] in the correction and disciplining and
[56:14] he says provoke them not to anger, in
[56:16] other words, to where they're
[56:18] exasperated in all life and all in all
[56:21] part where that they can actually
[56:23] succeed and actually move forward. Don't
[56:25] don't take away any hope from them but
[56:27] bring correction but also point them and
[56:29] showing that the correction is about
[56:31] there's a goal that is to be had and
[56:34] that and you know God God does the same
[56:36] thing with you and I he doesn't God does
[56:38] not come down and and you know he's
[56:40] frustrated with us and says I've been
[56:42] trying to say this and I've been trying
[56:44] let me tell you something God never
[56:46] approaches us through frustration. Amen.
[56:48] That's right. You know why? Because he's
[56:50] got confidence in his word. Amen. Now
[56:54] listen, that's the same thing that he
[56:56] wants to do and be through you and I is
[57:00] to is for that confidence to reside
[57:03] within our hearts and let nothing cloud
[57:06] that out. Because let me tell you, in
[57:08] every situation in our lives, it will
[57:12] take the
[57:13] supernatural working of God. And the
[57:16] greatest request that you and I can have
[57:18] is say, "Lord, let me be a faithful
[57:21] branch." Amen. If there's anything in me
[57:24] that needs to be pruned off, cuz I'm
[57:26] sure there is, then prune it off, Lord.
[57:29] That that fruit can come through my
[57:31] life. That my life could be a channel.
[57:33] Because sometimes our life of being a
[57:35] channel is simply just being a good
[57:38] solid believer in character.
[57:43] Are you with me? It's not, listen, it's
[57:45] not all about words.
[57:47] The word was meant to be made flesh.
[57:51] Are you with me? So notice he would
[57:55] carry him to a place of safety where he
[57:57] could be fully healed, cured, and set
[58:01] free by the transforming power of God.
[58:03] It's nothing less than the supernatural
[58:06] work of Almighty God. And I want to
[58:08] remind you, he said, "I'm the Lord that
[58:11] health thee." Amen. And this, he heals
[58:15] soul, which is the most important. Yes.
[58:18] But he heals your spirit
[58:21] and he heals your body because times
[58:23] when that soul has been healed, there's
[58:26] going to come times in our spirit and
[58:27] our body that we're going to need we're
[58:30] going to need healing in those areas.
[58:32] And he ministers to healing in those
[58:35] areas in our life. If you just be in
[58:37] tune with God and you watch, God will
[58:39] sweep right through a service and
[58:41] minister to every phase within our life.
[58:44] The Holy Spirit will bring new birth.
[58:46] the Holy Spirit will move to uh give uh
[58:50] healing in that spirit to reclaim areas
[58:52] that maybe Satan has got into in our
[58:55] mind and and then you know through uh
[58:58] certain areas and and the Holy Spirit
[59:00] will lead you and bring you from where
[59:03] you're at to where you ought to be as a
[59:05] son and daughter of God. And of course,
[59:07] he'll sweep over your body and and touch
[59:09] your body. Brother Brandon says, "There
[59:11] are some here today, Lord, Father, who
[59:14] does not have this blessed, restful hope
[59:16] in their soul. May this be the day that
[59:19] they receive it. There may be those who
[59:21] have grown weary in the way. Let them
[59:25] know, Lord, that we never come to a
[59:27] picnic, but to a battleground, fight
[59:30] every inch of the way. Give them courage
[59:32] and strengthen them." Now I want you to
[59:34] understand right here we've just had
[59:36] he's asking minister to the soul and
[59:39] minister to the spirit. Now when let me
[59:41] just deal with this just a little moment
[59:43] here as he's leading. There might be
[59:45] those who's grown weary in the way. Let
[59:48] them know Lord we've never come to a
[59:50] picnic but to a battleground to fight
[59:52] every inch of the way. Now, you might
[59:54] look at that and I want you just to
[59:56] notice how the Holy Spirit will let will
[59:58] speak to you and I and help us to see
[1:00:01] that within this walk with God, there's
[1:00:04] going to be times that you don't feel
[1:00:06] like it.
[1:00:08] There's going to be times to where you
[1:00:10] don't feel like reading. You don't feel
[1:00:13] like praying. You don't feel like coming
[1:00:15] to the house of God. Oh, yeah. Brand
[1:00:19] says it's very easy for a Christian to
[1:00:20] get that way. You see it's very because
[1:00:23] why? You're still in this right here.
[1:00:26] But this is why when the prophet think
[1:00:28] of just simple instructions he said and
[1:00:30] how can I overcome? He says keep revival
[1:00:34] in you. Amen.
[1:00:37] So now that becomes our responsibility
[1:00:39] of laying in the presence of God and yet
[1:00:43] you have life.
[1:00:46] Pressures of life they don't lessen they
[1:00:48] keep on. I mean when you retired did the
[1:00:50] pressures of life did no it don't get
[1:00:52] easier pressures of life I mean those of
[1:00:54] you that have retired they they don't
[1:00:56] get easier you know isn't isn't one day
[1:00:57] that oh I tell you what one day you know
[1:00:59] when I get 18 and I can drive to work
[1:01:01] and oh the pressures don't work you know
[1:01:03] what happens the more as age comes the
[1:01:06] more responsibility
[1:01:08] it's life and sometimes with life even
[1:01:12] this is where Paul would write be not
[1:01:15] weary in
[1:01:17] welldoing sir Amen. But you say, "Well,
[1:01:20] brother Samuel, if we get weary in that
[1:01:21] way, and I don't feel like doing this."
[1:01:23] Well, this is where then the enemy would
[1:01:26] like to come to you and say, "Oh, well,
[1:01:28] you you don't feel like coming to
[1:01:29] church. Oh, you don't feel like reading
[1:01:31] your Bible. Oh, you don't feel like
[1:01:33] praying. You must not have the love of
[1:01:34] God in your heart." And he can take
[1:01:37] things and spin it on you and then try
[1:01:39] to just get you down into that place.
[1:01:41] But see, it's reminding you, we've not
[1:01:44] come to a picnic. In other words, we're
[1:01:46] going to have to battle beyond our
[1:01:49] feelings.
[1:01:51] And when you battle beyond your
[1:01:52] feelings, there's a great blessing that
[1:01:56] awaits because God is looking at you and
[1:02:00] seeing you look your feelings and
[1:02:02] knowing that you don't feel anything.
[1:02:04] You might sit for a little bit and you
[1:02:06] don't feel anything. But all of a sudden
[1:02:08] as you move on into prayer and it just
[1:02:10] seems like everything is as dry as dry
[1:02:13] can be. It feels like you're reading and
[1:02:15] it it just feels like the print is just
[1:02:17] hitting you in the forehead and coming
[1:02:18] back down and you're listening to a
[1:02:20] message and it it seems like all of a
[1:02:22] sudden here you are you're out over here
[1:02:24] and you've missed everything that's been
[1:02:26] said for the last 15 20 minutes or
[1:02:29] whatever more. But you know within that
[1:02:31] this is where we have to recognize it's
[1:02:34] a battle that this where I'm living in
[1:02:38] it's a constant as Paul said bringing in
[1:02:41] subjection.
[1:02:44] And that's what the quickening power has
[1:02:47] come to do.
[1:02:49] Anybody that tells you it's not a battle
[1:02:52] I will say to you right now first of all
[1:02:55] I think they have missed the mark.
[1:02:59] are you? They don't know what they're
[1:03:00] talking about. It doesn't it doesn't
[1:03:02] sudden then all of a sudden oh no no no
[1:03:04] this is why then when brother
[1:03:05] ministering to the spirit let them know
[1:03:07] lord that we're not come to a picnic in
[1:03:10] other words we've got a battle and you
[1:03:11] know just putting listen sometimes
[1:03:14] healing comes just by putting things in
[1:03:17] perspective
[1:03:19] because the way that we've got things
[1:03:21] framed and we're thinking about it man
[1:03:23] we've got it framed in such a way and
[1:03:25] sometimes you can take those thoughts
[1:03:27] and frame yourself right outside of
[1:03:30] Christ.
[1:03:32] That's very true. Come on now. But
[1:03:35] aren't you glad that the word is a
[1:03:37] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:03:40] the heart.
[1:03:42] He knows right where to find you from
[1:03:44] Jerusalem to Jericho. You might be in
[1:03:46] Jerusalem in your soul, but in your
[1:03:49] spirit you've already, it's like I'm on
[1:03:51] my road to Jericho and you've
[1:03:53] entertained some things and it just beat
[1:03:55] you up and got you down. But he alone
[1:03:59] who knows how to come and minister to a
[1:04:02] spirit that has drifted and went astray.
[1:04:05] Let me tell you, he comes with ample
[1:04:07] necessities to minister to your need.
[1:04:11] And not leave you there, but pick you up
[1:04:13] and take you where you belong.
[1:04:17] So look, Brother Brandon says there's
[1:04:19] some that's been wounded. Now it's going
[1:04:21] to come to the body. There's some that's
[1:04:23] been wounded. Lord, the enemy has shot
[1:04:26] darts of sickness into their body and
[1:04:28] afflictions. There are warriors laying
[1:04:31] here on the battlefield that would be up
[1:04:33] and going if they could, but they are
[1:04:36] must be taken to the inn where the
[1:04:39] caretaker is to take care. May the
[1:04:43] ambulance of God carry them to a real
[1:04:48] genuine faith this afternoon. I'm
[1:04:51] telling you, not only is the ambulance
[1:04:53] of God to carry genuine faith to the
[1:04:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost, but the
[1:04:58] ambulance of God is here to carry the
[1:05:00] genuine faith and healing in our spirit
[1:05:04] and healing in our bodies.
[1:05:08] You don't call an ambulance for a joy
[1:05:10] ride. You call an ambulance because it's
[1:05:12] an
[1:05:13] emergency
[1:05:15] 911 situation.
[1:05:21] And I'm telling you, it's an
[1:05:26] emergency. It's an emergency.
[1:05:31] Can you say that with your situation?
[1:05:33] It's an emergency, Lord. I need you.
[1:05:38] Lady OA, Lady Oia says, "Oh, just send
[1:05:40] one of the white vans that delivers
[1:05:42] medicine." But the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:05:44] says, "It's an emergency, Lord. I need
[1:05:47] you. I need my high priest.
[1:05:55] So
[1:05:57] to recognize this that you know within
[1:05:59] it the first priority when this one came
[1:06:06] and he comes down and sees the need and
[1:06:09] the situation. I want you to notice that
[1:06:13] what he did first in this text we read,
[1:06:16] he bound up the wounds. In other words,
[1:06:18] you've got to get the things that are
[1:06:22] bleeding out. We got to get it stopped.
[1:06:25] We've got to let some hematsis come in
[1:06:27] first. We got to let it get stopped.
[1:06:30] Get it to a place where healing can
[1:06:32] start.
[1:06:35] Amen. That's good preaching. The man,
[1:06:38] the man himself had no other recourse.
[1:06:41] He couldn't even resist the treatments.
[1:06:43] He because of where he was at, he had
[1:06:46] been beaten. He had been stripped. He
[1:06:48] had been robbed.
[1:06:50] But God saw his need.
[1:06:54] And let me tell you something. Whatever
[1:06:56] the devil might have taken from you, God
[1:06:59] is here to deliver it back to
[1:07:03] you. Hallelujah. I'm the Lord that
[1:07:07] health thee.
[1:07:09] He hasn't come emptyhanded. He's come
[1:07:12] with what's necessary to restore you.
[1:07:17] Hallelujah.
[1:07:18] [Applause]
[1:07:20] Hallelujah.
[1:07:22] He had no other course but to yield. He
[1:07:25] was in a place of yieldedness. I want
[1:07:28] you to notice two things that came. Wine
[1:07:30] and oil. All the way through the
[1:07:32] scripture. Oil and wine has always been
[1:07:35] together in every ser sacrifice.
[1:07:38] Is that right? We know the oil to be the
[1:07:40] type of the Holy Ghost. The wine to be
[1:07:43] the revelation of God's word. Is that
[1:07:46] right? So oil and wine has always been a
[1:07:49] part of worship. Yes. and the oil and
[1:07:53] the wine. Maybe you didn't know this but
[1:07:56] wine itself it was you know looked upon
[1:07:59] even by many of the ancients and even
[1:08:02] during this time wine has a long history
[1:08:06] in medicine
[1:08:08] because wine itself it has an
[1:08:11] antiseptic it has an I don't know how to
[1:08:14] pronounce this an an anogalis I don't
[1:08:17] know how to pronounce it uh something
[1:08:19] that in other words it numbs you and it
[1:08:21] has an
[1:08:22] anti-icrobial agent for treating wounds.
[1:08:27] So, the first thing that's got to be
[1:08:29] ministered is we've got to get the truth
[1:08:31] to that wound.
[1:08:35] In other words, God didn't come as a
[1:08:37] scavenger,
[1:08:39] to pick at your wounds. He came to
[1:08:41] minister to your wounds.
[1:08:46] And let me tell you, he came with what
[1:08:48] was needed to stop the infection, to
[1:08:51] stop the bleeding out.
[1:08:55] Hallelujah. He came with what was needed
[1:08:58] that would be able to numb you and ease
[1:09:00] you and put you into a place of looking
[1:09:03] at his grace and rest coming upon your
[1:09:05] life and what was needed in an
[1:09:08] antimicrobial to keep away the microbes.
[1:09:11] Why? Because you are coming to full
[1:09:14] healing.
[1:09:17] Hallelujah.
[1:09:19] Glory. And that full healing will lead
[1:09:23] to a change of this body.
[1:09:30] Hallelujah.
[1:09:33] And the oil helped to soothe
[1:09:36] the wounds.
[1:09:40] Had a way of wounds that were that was
[1:09:43] so uh tender and brittle, but oil had a
[1:09:46] way to soo them. Why? So we can so it
[1:09:49] can start being worked with so we can
[1:09:51] mend it up
[1:09:54] now. You see within this this is where
[1:09:57] we have a responsibility to recognize
[1:10:00] our need right and to submit to
[1:10:02] treatment. Never forget as I've shared
[1:10:05] with you many times this scar that I
[1:10:06] have right here when I got a cut and it
[1:10:09] was deep and I remember I'd never had
[1:10:11] stitches before. I've told you that. And
[1:10:14] you know if I would have been by myself
[1:10:15] I don't know what I would have done. I
[1:10:17] probably would have just rolled it up
[1:10:18] because I just thought band-aid will be
[1:10:20] good with it, you know. But I had a I
[1:10:22] had a man that was there, another
[1:10:24] another young man was on the football
[1:10:25] team with me and he passed by my dorm
[1:10:28] room where I had it open and working on
[1:10:29] things and he looked in there and seen
[1:10:31] it. He said, "What in the world?" I
[1:10:33] said, "Oh, it's it's all right." His
[1:10:34] name was last name was Wickcham. I said,
[1:10:35] "Whamm, it's all right." And he said,
[1:10:37] "No, it ain't. You're going to a
[1:10:39] hospital." I said, "It's only a cut,
[1:10:42] man. I" He said, "You listen." He said,
[1:10:44] "You you come with me." and he drove me
[1:10:46] to the hospital there in Marietta and
[1:10:48] they got in there and man, was you
[1:10:50] scared? Yeah, I was scared cuz I ain't
[1:10:52] never had stitches
[1:10:53] before. And so when they went in there,
[1:10:55] I'll never forget they had to take first
[1:10:57] of all and get it all cleaned out and
[1:10:58] they started putting shots and how
[1:11:00] everything was spread apart and then
[1:11:02] they started stitching it and bringing
[1:11:04] it together. You know that that in
[1:11:06] itself when when when if I had not come
[1:11:08] to a place to recognize I needed I
[1:11:11] really had a need. And you know what? If
[1:11:13] it hadn't been somebody there of a
[1:11:14] friend, somebody with me who was able to
[1:11:16] help me. See, no, you you got a real
[1:11:18] need. And let me just tell you
[1:11:20] something. Aren't you glad that the Holy
[1:11:22] Spirit is a real friend?
[1:11:25] Aren't you glad that God knows?
[1:11:29] Lord, I'm good. I I'll be all right. I
[1:11:30] I'll just No. No. He's Come on. You're
[1:11:32] coming with me. You're coming with me.
[1:11:36] This is why God could say in the book of
[1:11:38] Isaiah, "Why should you be stricken
[1:11:41] anymore? You will revolt more and more
[1:11:44] and the whole head is sick and the whole
[1:11:46] heart faint. From the sole of the foot,
[1:11:48] even unto the head there is no soundness
[1:11:51] or health in it, but wounds and bruises
[1:11:54] and putrifying soores. They have not
[1:11:57] been clothed, neither bound up, neither
[1:12:00] mllified with ointment.
[1:12:04] This is where God would go on speaking
[1:12:06] to Jeremiah or to Israel in the time of
[1:12:09] exile. Is there no bomb in Gilead? Is
[1:12:14] there no physician here? Now, God's not
[1:12:16] asking a question as though he doesn't
[1:12:18] know. He's asking a question to let them
[1:12:21] know that there is still a physician
[1:12:24] present.
[1:12:26] And there is not a new prescription, but
[1:12:29] it is the same prescription
[1:12:31] and it's
[1:12:33] present. Why then is not the health of
[1:12:37] the daughter of my people recovered?
[1:12:42] Now notice as he goes on with him
[1:12:44] looking at this in what we read in
[1:12:46] Isaiah. You see it has to come down to
[1:12:50] recognizing our need. And when we look
[1:12:53] at this when we can see symptoms when we
[1:12:57] can see situations and then the Holy
[1:12:59] Spirit has a way of highlighting things
[1:13:01] in our life. It's a time that we've got
[1:13:04] to recognize our need and submit to the
[1:13:07] treatment of the Holy Spirit and and not
[1:13:11] look at it because let me just say it
[1:13:12] like this. If you look at anything in a
[1:13:14] manner of well I I can you know I don't
[1:13:16] have to look at this right now or I
[1:13:18] don't have to deal with this right now.
[1:13:19] But no, when God brings our attention to
[1:13:22] it, this is where we want to deal with
[1:13:23] it. Let me just say this as simple as
[1:13:26] simple as I can say it. When the Holy
[1:13:28] Spirit is moving in your heart and the
[1:13:31] word is moving and revealing and
[1:13:34] pulsating in your life, don't you let a
[1:13:36] devil talk you away from God in his
[1:13:40] mercy that's beckoning you out of a
[1:13:42] situation. Maybe it's out of a sinick
[1:13:45] life. Maybe there's situations as it
[1:13:48] goes down. There's a need for a real
[1:13:50] healing and deliverance in your soul to
[1:13:53] where there comes a deep settled peace
[1:13:55] that I know that I know that I know that
[1:13:59] I have passed from death unto life that
[1:14:01] I have met the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:14:06] Let him cure out everything.
[1:14:10] Symptoms of unbelief, ungodly dress,
[1:14:13] ungodly things of the world, ungodly
[1:14:15] habits. Let me just tell you something.
[1:14:17] I don't care how much marijuana they
[1:14:19] legalize is still against the word of
[1:14:22] God.
[1:14:24] Are you hearing me? They can't give me
[1:14:26] that trash. Well, you know, God said
[1:14:28] every herb and seedbearing thing. Let me
[1:14:30] tell you something. God never asked you
[1:14:32] to do something that would destroy your
[1:14:34] body and take you out of your mind.
[1:14:38] It's of the devil. And Satan has brought
[1:14:40] it right down here. It started out with
[1:14:43] prescription drugs and now everywhere
[1:14:45] you go, you got a dispensary and the
[1:14:47] smell of skunk all over the air.
[1:14:52] I'm telling you, it's a devil.
[1:14:55] Amen. You don't trade out one thing and
[1:14:57] then bring something else in your life.
[1:14:59] Let me tell you the very thing that
[1:15:01] would cause you to feed on ungodly
[1:15:04] things out there. You don't need to find
[1:15:06] something that gets sweetened up that
[1:15:08] gets better. But you need to find the
[1:15:10] living God that can take care of that
[1:15:13] need in your life. Let me tell you, the
[1:15:16] Holy Ghost is a sure
[1:15:19] remedy. He'll burn that desire for
[1:15:22] alcohol out. He'll burn it out for
[1:15:24] marijuana. He'll burn it out for ungodly
[1:15:26] things. He'll take care of lust.
[1:15:32] You don't close up a wound without
[1:15:35] getting it clean.
[1:15:38] If not, there's an infection that'll set
[1:15:40] through your body and it'll caner
[1:15:44] and it'll eventually kill you. So, don't
[1:15:47] ignore infection.
[1:15:52] Invite the Holy Spirit. Say, "Lord, I'm
[1:15:55] going to take in the wine right now."
[1:15:57] You say, "Well, what's that wine doing?"
[1:15:58] Jesus said, "Sanctify them through thy
[1:16:00] truth, for thy word is truth." Is that
[1:16:03] right? Let the word as it's coming forth
[1:16:05] and the redeeming power in the
[1:16:07] revelation as it's being preached. Just
[1:16:09] take it into your life. Oh, brother
[1:16:10] Samuel, I'm not worthy. Let cast that
[1:16:12] devil to the side. You need to take the
[1:16:15] word and what the word is saying about
[1:16:17] you because what will it do? It will
[1:16:19] begin to cleanse your wounds.
[1:16:22] You can't get good enough on your own.
[1:16:26] That's why God sent a message.
[1:16:32] Come on, friends.
[1:16:34] This is why it took more than a priest.
[1:16:37] Help me preach. It took more than a
[1:16:39] scribe. It took more than theology. It
[1:16:42] took more than a Sunday school. It took
[1:16:45] more than a picture of an eagle. It took
[1:16:48] the living eagle
[1:16:52] himself.
[1:16:54] Hallelujah.
[1:16:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That came
[1:16:58] sweeping down right to where you and I
[1:17:01] were
[1:17:02] at. You know what I see here in Luke
[1:17:05] chapter 10? I see one who was worthy to
[1:17:09] take the
[1:17:13] B. Hallelujah.
[1:17:16] I see one where it's not just given us
[1:17:18] ideology but a living God.
[1:17:22] We needed more than a man.
[1:17:25] Hallelujah. I looked and I saw no man
[1:17:28] worthy. But here I seen one
[1:17:33] the lion of the tribe of Judah. One that
[1:17:37] had been slain.
[1:17:40] [Music]
[1:17:42] One that was worthy.
[1:17:46] Thank you, Lord. Well, there was a lot
[1:17:47] of sidstepping in our life. Well, you
[1:17:50] need to go to this group. They'll help
[1:17:51] you.
[1:17:53] We're sidest stepping in our life. You
[1:17:55] know what your problem is? You just
[1:17:57] don't have this memorized good enough.
[1:17:59] It's sidest stepping. You don't want You
[1:18:01] know what? We don't want to sidestep
[1:18:04] because there's a God who come right to
[1:18:05] where you are. Aren't you glad?
[1:18:10] Oh Lord, we love you.
[1:18:13] We love you, Lord Jesus.
[1:18:16] Notice this. In Jeremiah, they have
[1:18:20] healed also the hurt of the daughter of
[1:18:24] my people
[1:18:25] slightly, saying,
[1:18:27] "Peace, peace." When there is no peace,
[1:18:33] it's false. It's appeasement. It tickles
[1:18:37] the ears. That's what the Bible said it
[1:18:39] would be. They would tickle their ears.
[1:18:41] What? Tell me what I Tell me what what
[1:18:43] appeals to my flesh. Something that will
[1:18:45] give me enough of a numbing to silence
[1:18:47] that voice in my soul that's crying out
[1:18:49] for reality.
[1:18:53] They're having itching ears. And you
[1:18:55] know what? They they've got there's
[1:18:56] desires that they have. But you see,
[1:18:58] this is where that within it, it's a
[1:19:00] false peace. It and this is listen
[1:19:04] friends. Listen listen. This is why that
[1:19:07] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, it's got
[1:19:10] to be something deeper than just on your
[1:19:13] flesh or your spirit.
[1:19:16] You can have it on your spirit and just
[1:19:19] love. Oh, I love to get in the
[1:19:21] atmosphere. I love to worship. I love
[1:19:24] it's got to come deeper to where it's a
[1:19:26] love affair on the inside to where he
[1:19:30] changes you and your victory is not
[1:19:33] dependent on the atmosphere, the songs
[1:19:37] or anything else. But it's a victory
[1:19:39] that is manifested even in the darkest
[1:19:42] of hour. There's an anchor that holds
[1:19:45] you beyond the veil.
[1:19:48] It has changed the very desires of your
[1:19:51] life. That's right. Amen. That's a peace
[1:19:54] that can never be removed.
[1:19:57] This is where Isaiah said, "Oh, thou
[1:19:59] afflicted, tossed with tempest and not
[1:20:03] comforted. Behold, I watch this now. I
[1:20:07] want you to watch how this is going.
[1:20:08] Behold, I will lay thy stones with fair
[1:20:12] colors and lay thy foundations with
[1:20:15] sapphires." Now, what God's speaking of
[1:20:17] is building Israel back up. He's talking
[1:20:20] about that when it will actually come
[1:20:23] through that of the baptism of the Holy
[1:20:26] Ghost through those two witnesses of
[1:20:28] Revelations 11.
[1:20:30] Because God would write many times on
[1:20:32] when Israel went out of the land how he
[1:20:34] was going to restore them. But you also
[1:20:36] read in many of these promises where God
[1:20:38] has made a promise that he was going to
[1:20:41] bring them back. And in places like
[1:20:43] this, when God brings them back to this
[1:20:45] place that we're reading about here,
[1:20:46] they won't be able to fall away from
[1:20:48] that. Right,
[1:20:50] brother Samuel. Is is there a place
[1:20:51] where you can not fall away from? Yeah.
[1:20:53] In him.
[1:20:55] In him. Oh, sure. You You know, yeah,
[1:20:58] you can make mistakes and other things
[1:20:59] like that, but you can't fall away from
[1:21:01] him because your desire is him.
[1:21:06] As a matter of fact, it's impossible for
[1:21:08] you to fall away.
[1:21:10] Hallelujah. When you get in him,
[1:21:14] brother and sister, that's the effect of
[1:21:16] the seal of the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:19] No other age has had the privilege of
[1:21:22] the seal of the Holy Ghost. This is the
[1:21:25] sealing hour.
[1:21:29] Watch what God said. I I will lay thy
[1:21:32] stones with fair colors, and lay thy
[1:21:35] foundations with sapphires, and I will
[1:21:37] make thy windows of the gates, and thy
[1:21:40] gates of carbunles, and all thy borders
[1:21:42] of pleasant stones, and all thy children
[1:21:46] shall be taught of the Lord, and great
[1:21:49] shall be the peace of thy children.
[1:21:51] Amen. You realize that verse right there
[1:21:53] is the privilege of the baptism of the
[1:21:55] Holy Ghost.
[1:21:56] Because when when you have received him,
[1:21:59] the Lord Jesus picks this up, I believe
[1:22:00] in John 6, and he's refers back to this
[1:22:03] passage because to that to the believer,
[1:22:06] you have an inside teacher. When the
[1:22:09] Holy Ghost is come, he's the one inside
[1:22:12] of you that retaking in of the lamb and
[1:22:16] it's roasted with fire. He's the one
[1:22:18] that takes that and begins to open and
[1:22:21] unfold himself. You say, "Why would that
[1:22:23] be?" because it's not a public show.
[1:22:26] It's an inward work. That's the real
[1:22:30] mystery of the coming of the Lord in
[1:22:32] this hour. It's when he gets behind
[1:22:35] closed doors. That's where he reveals
[1:22:38] himself. Woo. When he's walking with you
[1:22:42] along the way and he meets as though as
[1:22:44] though he's going to keep on going. You
[1:22:46] say, "No, Lord. I want you to come.
[1:22:49] Lord, I want you to stay. Whatever your
[1:22:51] need is in your life,
[1:22:54] I want you to stay, Lord.
[1:22:59] Oh, thank God, Lord. I love this. In
[1:23:03] righteousness shalt thou be established.
[1:23:06] Whose righteousness his
[1:23:10] thou shalt be
[1:23:12] far from oppression?
[1:23:15] For thou shalt not fear and from terror,
[1:23:19] for it shall not come near thee. Amen.
[1:23:23] Didn't Jesus say, "I will not leave you
[1:23:24] comfortless."
[1:23:26] Here he is, the God of glory standing
[1:23:29] behind the veil and he said, "I will not
[1:23:32] leave you comfortless."
[1:23:34] Well, it wasn't Jesus coming back in a
[1:23:36] corporal body, but it was the same God
[1:23:39] that would be able to minister the
[1:23:41] victory and the achievement of Calvary
[1:23:44] and conquering over Satan's trinity and
[1:23:47] come back to his children and become the
[1:23:50] comforter on the inside. He said, "I'll
[1:23:54] not leave you comfortless, but I will
[1:23:56] come to you." Notice who will I.
[1:23:59] Don't you love him?
[1:24:01] Jeremiah chapter 3, it said, "Return ye
[1:24:04] backsliding children, and I will heal
[1:24:08] your backslidings." Notice,
[1:24:09] "Return, return, backsliding children,
[1:24:12] and I'll heal your backslidings. Behold,
[1:24:14] we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord
[1:24:17] our God." Hosea 14:4, "I will heal their
[1:24:21] backslids. I will love them freely,
[1:24:26] for mine anger is turned away from him."
[1:24:28] And listen, you know what this is
[1:24:30] speaking of? It's speaking of the
[1:24:31] restoration of the Jews under the
[1:24:34] 144,000. But remember, you are the type,
[1:24:38] the spiritual type of Zion of Jerusalem
[1:24:42] that's been restored. You're not an
[1:24:44] earthly Jerusalem. Help me preach now.
[1:24:48] The earthly Jerusalems, Baptist,
[1:24:51] Methodist, Pentecost, Roman Catholic,
[1:24:55] earthly Jerusalems, there they crucified
[1:24:59] him.
[1:25:01] They crucified the word of God.
[1:25:05] They were upset the first time with with
[1:25:08] their a man making himself God. And now
[1:25:11] this time where they were upset is for
[1:25:14] the word that was in the man.
[1:25:17] Amen. And they crucified the word again.
[1:25:21] But that had to happen. Why? Because
[1:25:23] when the word would be crucified and God
[1:25:26] let it happen. Why? That he might raise
[1:25:31] up in a newness of life. The
[1:25:34] resurrection in this hour. It's the
[1:25:37] resurrection of the son of man
[1:25:41] among his people.
[1:25:44] Glory be to God. What were they doing?
[1:25:47] crucifying the effects of the word.
[1:25:50] Oh God, don't do this no more. You don't
[1:25:52] need to act like that. You don't need to
[1:25:54] do this. You don't need to do that.
[1:25:55] Crucifying. We're at in the very pull
[1:25:58] pits.
[1:26:00] So you're not that. You're not an
[1:26:01] earthly Jerusalem. That's right. You're
[1:26:04] a spiritual Jerusalem.
[1:26:06] Right. I John looked and what I saw I
[1:26:10] saw a city coming down. That new
[1:26:12] Jerusalem. It was adorned as a bride
[1:26:15] prepared for her husband.
[1:26:18] And Paul said, "We that have been born
[1:26:20] again of the spirit of God, children of
[1:26:22] the free woman."
[1:26:24] We are of that new Jerusalem, which is
[1:26:27] the mother of every elect son and
[1:26:30] daughter of God. And let me tell you
[1:26:33] something, he has built up your life.
[1:26:35] Every one of us are a place, a stone in
[1:26:38] this temple, in this tabernacle of his
[1:26:40] glory. And God himself is the one
[1:26:43] assembling himself
[1:26:46] together.
[1:26:49] Humpty Dumpty fell off the wall and
[1:26:50] couldn't put himself back together
[1:26:52] again. But let me tell you something.
[1:26:54] Jesus
[1:26:55] himself, when God in his mind, what he
[1:26:58] had, the attributes of his thoughts, and
[1:27:01] when sin came in, it looked like it was
[1:27:03] all scattered. But God had a way to put
[1:27:06] himself back together again. How did he
[1:27:10] do it? by his word.
[1:27:13] He didn't need all the king's men. He
[1:27:15] just needed his word.
[1:27:18] And he begin to put things back
[1:27:20] together. Oh my Lord, it's God who puts
[1:27:23] our lives back together.
[1:27:27] I'll heal your backslidings.
[1:27:30] God heals up and downs. Now, we we can
[1:27:33] all go through different valleys of
[1:27:34] things, but I'm talking about at one
[1:27:36] moment, you know, person serving the
[1:27:38] Lord for a while and then they go right
[1:27:40] back out in the world and it's like, has
[1:27:41] nothing ever happened? Now, I'm not all
[1:27:43] of a sudden going to say that there was
[1:27:45] nothing happened, but I'm just here to
[1:27:46] tell you that God is present to heal
[1:27:49] backslidings.
[1:27:52] And no matter what capacity they are,
[1:27:54] he's here to heal it. But here, return
[1:27:56] to me and I'll do it. And you know, one
[1:27:59] of the things with backsliding, that's a
[1:28:01] con, that's a real real life condition.
[1:28:05] Book of Proverbs says that the
[1:28:06] backslider is right in all his ways.
[1:28:10] Yeah, that's good. When everything you
[1:28:13] see is right about you and you're right
[1:28:15] and everybody else is wrong, you're
[1:28:17] backsliding.
[1:28:19] When all you can do is pick people apart
[1:28:21] and how this is right. And in order for
[1:28:22] you to feel uplifted, you got to put
[1:28:24] other people down. You're
[1:28:26] backsliding. That's true. Are you
[1:28:28] hearing me? You're not you're not
[1:28:30] dwelling in the righteousness of Jesus
[1:28:32] Christ where you need to dwell. You
[1:28:34] don't got to put nobody down to be
[1:28:35] lifted up. He said, "If I be lifted up,
[1:28:38] I'll draw all men unto me."
[1:28:42] Is that right? Brother Ramon said, "Oh,
[1:28:45] heavenly father, unworthy creatures.
[1:28:47] This hot, sweaty room this morning, a
[1:28:50] sweat box, but God sweated it out for
[1:28:52] us." The Holy Spirit come down, convince
[1:28:55] people that they were wrong and they
[1:28:58] were sinning. That's why it takes It
[1:28:59] takes the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:02] It takes the Holy Ghost to convince
[1:29:03] them. Well, I'm just going to talk to
[1:29:05] him till I'm blue in the face and drive
[1:29:06] them away.
[1:29:08] It takes the Holy Ghost. You see, God
[1:29:11] will take situations in life that brings
[1:29:14] us to a place to teach us. It's not your
[1:29:17] tongue that's going to get the job done.
[1:29:20] That's good preacher. And if God could
[1:29:22] have his way, what he would love to do
[1:29:24] is to perform a circumcision on your
[1:29:26] tongue.
[1:29:27] And it would be a great glorious victory
[1:29:30] to be able to get that tongue under
[1:29:32] control to bridle that thing. Cuz let me
[1:29:35] tell you, there's a lot of places that
[1:29:36] are set on fire with that tongue. It
[1:29:38] might be the smallest member, but it's
[1:29:40] caused the most divisions in churches
[1:29:42] sometimes. It's caused the most amount
[1:29:44] of hurt. I'm telling you, friends, this
[1:29:46] is why we need the spirit of God. You
[1:29:49] might say, "Well, I've always been this
[1:29:50] way." How long is always? Does that mean
[1:29:53] clear back since the mind of God? Don't
[1:29:55] you try to put that characteristic in
[1:29:56] the lamb's book of life? But you need to
[1:29:59] let God prove himself as a mighty
[1:30:01] conqueror that he can take hold of a big
[1:30:03] mouth. He can take hold of a tongue. He
[1:30:05] can take an override, a critical spirit.
[1:30:07] Let the mighty conqueror write in upon
[1:30:10] your life and prove himself in that area
[1:30:12] of your life. Hallelujah. So instead of
[1:30:15] looking at it in defeat, say, "Lord
[1:30:17] Jesus, manifest yourself as the mighty
[1:30:20] conqueror." You know what it becomes?
[1:30:22] Instead of a defeat, it becomes an
[1:30:23] opportunity.
[1:30:27] He said their spirits, Lord, were
[1:30:28] arrogant. They had become hostile,
[1:30:31] snoopy, know-it-all, not willing to
[1:30:34] repent, not willing to forgive people
[1:30:36] that's done things against them. They
[1:30:38] wasn't willing to. But the Holy Spirit
[1:30:41] took the word of God, placed it right in
[1:30:44] their gentle hearts and said, "Now,
[1:30:46] don't you want to come back to where you
[1:30:48] was the first time when you come to the
[1:30:49] altar? Don't you want to come back to
[1:30:51] where everybody you love everybody? You
[1:30:54] you and you love me with undying love.
[1:30:56] Then just rise up and come to the
[1:30:58] altar." They did it, Lord.
[1:31:01] Amen. How many like to say, "Lord, take
[1:31:04] me back.
[1:31:06] Take me back." Amen. He says, "I pray
[1:31:09] that you will sanctify their thoughts,
[1:31:11] Lord. Sanctify their heart. Make them
[1:31:13] gentle and peaceful. May they rise from
[1:31:15] this altar now after that they have
[1:31:18] repented and giving their lives over to
[1:31:19] you. Go back to their homes. No matter
[1:31:21] what, no matter what takes place, if the
[1:31:24] husband gets all upset or wife gets
[1:31:26] upset or neighbors gets upset or
[1:31:28] somebody working with or associating
[1:31:30] with, I'll just be gentle like a dove."
[1:31:37] How many believe that he can minister to
[1:31:39] that?
[1:31:41] Amen. You see, God honors your desire.
[1:31:44] Let me read you. Let me refer to you a
[1:31:46] few places here in the scripture or in
[1:31:49] the message. You know, brother Brandham,
[1:31:51] he picks up a a few times here and you
[1:31:54] have at times where individuals that
[1:31:56] they have come into a backsliding
[1:31:58] condition. They got cold, not where they
[1:32:00] want to be with God. maybe whatever the
[1:32:03] circumstances and things of life that's
[1:32:05] come up. And let me just tell you
[1:32:06] something. I I don't you're not going to
[1:32:08] find me standing here and saying that
[1:32:09] anybody's backslide never had an
[1:32:11] experience with God.
[1:32:13] Come on now. Because this is one
[1:32:15] preacher by the word and by the message
[1:32:16] of the hour that don't fit. That's
[1:32:18] right. That's so good. But there are
[1:32:20] conditions and situations that truly
[1:32:22] there are those and situations where a
[1:32:24] person has been backsliden or whatever
[1:32:26] more and they really just by the fruits
[1:32:28] and the attributes and everything
[1:32:29] through their life, they've not gone
[1:32:31] deeper. But all it takes is a moment to
[1:32:33] recognize that there's a deeper walk and
[1:32:36] the grace of God to sweep down and all
[1:32:39] is gone.
[1:32:42] Is that all right? But the main thing
[1:32:43] what what you want to do is is that
[1:32:45] anytime correction comes, you always
[1:32:47] want to say yes, Papa.
[1:32:49] Yes. Because with correction, he comes
[1:32:52] to minister and he don't only, you know,
[1:32:54] uh bring the things that's harsh, but he
[1:32:56] puts the honey on the rock.
[1:32:58] [Laughter]
[1:33:01] Oh, brother Samuel, you're preaching an
[1:33:02] awful lot of grace. It's real grace.
[1:33:07] Law could never take them across Jordan.
[1:33:11] Are you hearing me? This is where it's
[1:33:13] got to be the law in your heart lived
[1:33:15] out by grace. That's right. And when
[1:33:18] it's exemplified by grace to your
[1:33:20] children, then they see a standard
[1:33:22] that's not dos and don'ts, not something
[1:33:24] at church, something different at home,
[1:33:25] but they're seeing the grace of God. And
[1:33:27] yet the standards and boundaries and law
[1:33:29] is present to do what? Point them to a
[1:33:32] God who is able to write the laws in
[1:33:34] their heart. There is grace that is
[1:33:36] sufficient to take you across Jordan.
[1:33:39] You see, God honors your desire. Let me
[1:33:41] let me just I'm going to read you a few
[1:33:43] things here. Just just listen. I don't
[1:33:44] I'm not going to put them up there. Just
[1:33:45] listen. He said, "Here you here you
[1:33:46] are." He said, "Uh, there's an operation
[1:33:48] on a colon, sister, that I see. And and
[1:33:51] you're desperately in need. There's
[1:33:52] another thing. Desperately in need of
[1:33:54] something here spiritually." She said,
[1:33:55] "Amen. You haven't been feeling right.
[1:33:58] You've been kind of washed away a
[1:34:01] little. And you want to come back." She
[1:34:03] said, "That's right. Well, you're back
[1:34:06] now." Hallelujah. You see her desire,
[1:34:11] she wanted to be back, and God made a
[1:34:14] way.
[1:34:17] Hold on now. I'm not finished with this
[1:34:19] devil yet. Well, you're back now. Go on
[1:34:22] believing with all your heart. You're
[1:34:23] get well. Your sins are forgiven
[1:34:27] you. Brother Benham said, "Now I never
[1:34:30] said sins forgiven." He said that it
[1:34:34] wasn't me. It was
[1:34:36] him. Who was it? The word is a discerner
[1:34:41] of the thoughts and intents of the
[1:34:43] heart.
[1:34:45] He caught you. You were near Jericho. I
[1:34:48] want to come back to Jerusalem.
[1:34:51] Your sins are forgiven you.
[1:34:55] [Applause]
[1:34:58] We got him in the corner. We might as
[1:35:00] well keep him there. Amen. Ain't that
[1:35:02] right?
[1:35:04] Here comes another brother. Brother
[1:35:06] Brandham said, "Here's a colored boy
[1:35:07] sitting on the end of this seat watching
[1:35:09] me right here." He said, "You're looking
[1:35:10] at me earnestly. I don't know you, but
[1:35:12] you're a stranger to me. You're
[1:35:13] suffering from a trouble. Well, I I see
[1:35:15] what it is. It's an allergy.
[1:35:18] I love that. You know why? Because it
[1:35:21] shows God's interested, Brother Dave, in
[1:35:23] allergies.
[1:35:25] It's an allergy. Do you believe that God
[1:35:28] will heal you? One great thing about it
[1:35:30] is this. One of your greatest troubles
[1:35:33] is that your backslid. You really want
[1:35:37] to come back to God. If that's true,
[1:35:40] raise up your hand and come right here.
[1:35:42] The brother raises his hand and comes
[1:35:43] up. Your sins are forgiven you, my
[1:35:46] brother. You say, "How do you know
[1:35:49] that?" The same one that told me what
[1:35:51] was wrong.
[1:35:56] Who is this? The Lord was present to
[1:35:59] heal them.
[1:36:02] The son of man have power on earth to
[1:36:04] forgive sins.
[1:36:08] This blood speaketh better
[1:36:13] things.
[1:36:16] Hallelujah. Glory be to God. Brother
[1:36:18] Aaron, not only the oil and the wine,
[1:36:20] but the power of the Holy Ghost, the
[1:36:24] beast is present to put you on and pack
[1:36:28] you
[1:36:30] back. Hallelujah. Your sins are
[1:36:34] forgiven. How can that be? He looked
[1:36:37] beyond your fault and saw your need.
[1:36:41] [Applause]
[1:36:49] That's how simple it is.
[1:36:54] I got to go here to a point here right
[1:36:56] now. Just stay right with me. I got to
[1:36:58] go here to a point. Brother Brand goes
[1:37:00] into this here in one place. He says it
[1:37:02] like this. He said, 'Now, friends, he
[1:37:05] said, 'What I want you to do is take
[1:37:07] every unbelief you've got, every
[1:37:09] unreasonable thought and lay it down on
[1:37:12] the floor and put your foot on it and
[1:37:16] say, "Lord Jesus, I'm going to believe
[1:37:18] you."
[1:37:19] [Music]
[1:37:21] Take every unbelief,
[1:37:23] every
[1:37:24] unreasonable thought, and put it on the
[1:37:27] floor
[1:37:29] and put your foot on it. Lord Jesus, I'm
[1:37:33] going to believe you.
[1:37:38] Won't everybody stand with me right now?
[1:37:40] If you can't stand, that's fine. Why
[1:37:41] don't you stand with me? We take a break
[1:37:43] here just a moment. Whatever it might
[1:37:45] be, every unbelief, unreasonable
[1:37:48] thought, I want you to take it right
[1:37:50] now. I want you just to put it right
[1:37:52] there under your foot. I want you to
[1:37:53] drop it and say, "Lord, I give it to you
[1:37:56] and I'm going to stomp right at it.
[1:37:58] Lord, help me to believe you.
[1:38:02] Oh, brother Samuel, what's that doing?
[1:38:04] You asked the prophet when he picked up
[1:38:06] that stone and threw that stone in the
[1:38:08] air. The prophet tells us in a message
[1:38:11] called reaction to an action that there
[1:38:13] is an equal action to every reaction.
[1:38:17] Smite, take this bow, take this arrow of
[1:38:20] deliverance and smite the earth. How
[1:38:23] long shall I smite it? Smite it till
[1:38:25] you're free.
[1:38:27] Smite it till you're free. Smite it till
[1:38:30] you got liberty. Smite it till freedom
[1:38:32] comes back. Smite it till joy returns.
[1:38:34] Smite it till the Holy Ghost comes.
[1:38:37] Smite the ground. Don't just smite it
[1:38:40] till you feel better. Smite it
[1:38:44] until you have what God has promised
[1:38:46] you. Hallelujah. You love him. Shake
[1:38:49] hands with somebody as you sit down and
[1:38:51] say, "It's mine.
[1:39:05] God honors your desire. Yes, he does.
[1:39:07] David said it like this in Psalms
[1:39:10] 147:E1. Praise ye the Lord, for it's
[1:39:13] good to sing praises unto our God. For
[1:39:16] it is pleasant and praise is coming. The
[1:39:18] Lord doth build up Jerusalem. He
[1:39:21] gatherth together the outcast of Israel.
[1:39:25] Put yourself there. He health the broken
[1:39:27] in heart and bangeth up their wounds. He
[1:39:31] tellth the number of the stars and he
[1:39:33] calleth them all by their names. Oh, I
[1:39:37] think they all look alike. I know them
[1:39:38] by name.
[1:39:42] I know them by name. I have their
[1:39:44] character and it's my character. I know
[1:39:47] them by name. I deal with them on a
[1:39:49] personal level. I'm not given a group
[1:39:51] revelation. This is an individual
[1:39:54] revelation.
[1:39:56] I'm speaking to them from an open book
[1:39:58] where their names are rented. It's not a
[1:40:01] big book. It's a little book.
[1:40:05] And I'm speaking to them through the
[1:40:08] mercy. Amen. Of the blood on the mercy
[1:40:11] seat.
[1:40:17] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Don't you love
[1:40:19] him?
[1:40:21] Oh my. You see this is why it says look
[1:40:23] at Jeremiah. Behold I I want you to
[1:40:26] watch this. It's I will bring it health
[1:40:28] and cure. Who is I? God.
[1:40:32] And I will cure them and will reveal
[1:40:35] unto them the abundance of peace and
[1:40:38] truth. I will cause the captivity of
[1:40:41] Judah and the captivity of Israel to
[1:40:43] return and will build them as at the
[1:40:46] first. I will cleanse them from all
[1:40:47] their iniquity, whereby they have sinned
[1:40:49] against me. I will pardon all their
[1:40:51] iniquities, whereby they have sinned,
[1:40:53] and whereby they've transgressed against
[1:40:55] me. And it shall be to me a name of joy,
[1:40:58] a praise, and honor before all the
[1:41:00] nations of the earth, which shall hear
[1:41:02] all the good that I do unto them. And
[1:41:05] they shall fear and tremble for all the
[1:41:07] goodness, and for all the prosperity
[1:41:09] that I procure unto it.
[1:41:13] Isn't God good? Behold, I bring health
[1:41:16] and cure.
[1:41:18] Psalms 103. Who redeemth thy life from
[1:41:23] destruction? Who crowneth thee with
[1:41:26] loving kindness and tender mercies?
[1:41:30] To crown means to be surrounded.
[1:41:34] He surrounds you with his loving
[1:41:37] kindness. How? By bringing you in him.
[1:41:42] He surrounds your life. Aren't you glad?
[1:41:44] Aren't you glad? Aren't how many glad
[1:41:46] that God surrounded your life? Oh, we
[1:41:50] had ways of escape.
[1:41:52] We used to have ways of escape. The
[1:41:55] preaching would get hot. All of a
[1:41:56] sudden, we had a spontaneous move to go
[1:41:58] to the bathroom
[1:42:00] or something would strike our mind.
[1:42:02] What's going to happen at work if you
[1:42:04] make that move? What's going to happen
[1:42:05] at school? But he surrounded our life.
[1:42:09] Eventually, it got to a place he cut off
[1:42:11] all exits.
[1:42:14] And all you could see is he's my way and
[1:42:17] this is the way. You know what he did?
[1:42:18] He brought you to a place of surrender.
[1:42:21] He showed you that way is not a way of
[1:42:23] escape. You went this way. That's not a
[1:42:25] way of escape. You went this way. That's
[1:42:27] not a way of escape. And eventually he
[1:42:29] brings you to a place where all your
[1:42:32] self efforts is vanished. And you see
[1:42:35] Jesus only.
[1:42:38] Hallelujah. You see the almighty God.
[1:42:42] This is my beloved son. Hear ye him.
[1:42:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:42:51] So, there's got to be a starting place.
[1:42:53] You know, a starting place. Brother
[1:42:56] Brand looks at a sister. He said,
[1:42:57] "There's a dark shadow. I see it. It's
[1:42:59] jumping and bumping and moving
[1:43:00] everything between you and I." Well, I
[1:43:02] know what it is now. He said, "It's a
[1:43:03] demon of nervousness." You think
[1:43:06] sometimes that you've lost your mind,
[1:43:08] but he's a liar. You're not. You're just
[1:43:12] as sane as anybody else. But he's trying
[1:43:14] to get you down, lady. Don't you pay no
[1:43:17] attention to that. Do you believe me to
[1:43:19] be a servant? Another thing. You've
[1:43:21] tried so long. Watch this now. You've
[1:43:23] tried so long to even get one place. You
[1:43:26] just like to put your foot that you
[1:43:28] could start from there. I'm not reading
[1:43:30] your mind, but that's what you was
[1:43:31] praying about. You said many times in
[1:43:34] your thoughts, if I could just get one
[1:43:36] place to start from. This is your
[1:43:39] starting place. Hallelujah. Right here.
[1:43:44] And brother Brandham addresses that demo
[1:43:46] and says, "You're healed." And the same
[1:43:48] time you're healed. This other lady was
[1:43:50] healed. You had the same thing.
[1:43:51] Nervousness. Brother Brandham said, "I
[1:43:53] see another lady." Oh, it's like a It's
[1:43:55] like an oppression, sister, that's upon
[1:43:56] your life. When the sun starts setting,
[1:43:58] you especially get weary in the evening
[1:44:00] time. Sometimes you think you're going
[1:44:03] to lose your mind and you'll you'll drop
[1:44:05] things. I'm not reading your mind, but
[1:44:08] that's true. Something here knows you.
[1:44:13] Before you come to this meeting, you was
[1:44:15] praying you could get in line and you
[1:44:17] was going to accept it. You wanted a
[1:44:19] place to put your foot. You said to set
[1:44:22] your foot. Is that right? That's what
[1:44:24] you've been believing and praying about.
[1:44:25] That's what you've been been asking God.
[1:44:27] Something here tells me, is that right?
[1:44:30] That's God. He wants to make you well
[1:44:34] and he'll do it right now. He said, "You
[1:44:37] understand, sister, them feelings you're
[1:44:39] getting, that's the time of life. That's
[1:44:40] that's menopause and things like that.
[1:44:42] You all these hormones and your body
[1:44:44] ceasing from making hormones. Don't
[1:44:46] don't try to put any hormones in your
[1:44:47] body. Don't do that cuz it just going to
[1:44:49] lead to cancer. Don't do that. You know,
[1:44:51] it's a natural thing. After a while,
[1:44:53] it'll be over. But now the devil will
[1:44:56] run you crazy if he can. But don't you
[1:44:59] let him do it. You look to Christ right
[1:45:01] now and be healed.
[1:45:05] Glory be to God. You know what that
[1:45:07] shows? That authority has come to sons
[1:45:11] and daughters of God.
[1:45:14] [Music]
[1:45:15] Hallelujah.
[1:45:18] Oh my. He goes on another situation.
[1:45:20] You're awful nervous, aren't you? He who
[1:45:23] stealed the calm sea, can he steal that
[1:45:25] nervous condition you got? You've been
[1:45:27] waiting for a place to start. Many times
[1:45:30] you've tried to make a you've tried to
[1:45:32] make a you've tried to make a start, but
[1:45:34] you're on it now. Keep walking in the
[1:45:37] name of Jesus Christ and get well. Is
[1:45:39] this all right? He said, "Now, you've
[1:45:42] been sitting here. I want you to, you
[1:45:43] know, young man." He said, "I see you.
[1:45:45] You you're trying to get a hold of
[1:45:46] yourself. Everybody's always telling you
[1:45:48] anyhow, but nervousness is a horrible
[1:45:51] thing. You've wanted to place your foot
[1:45:54] so you could start from here. You're on
[1:45:56] the spot now.
[1:45:59] Glory. 1964 identified Christ. Look on
[1:46:02] me, sister. You want to go eat supper
[1:46:04] and feel good about it again? Go ahead.
[1:46:07] That ulcer will leave you and you'll be
[1:46:10] made well again.
[1:46:12] Honey, ain't that right? God healed you
[1:46:13] of an ulcer. Amen.
[1:46:17] The same time the Lord the Lord had
[1:46:19] dealt with my heart and dealt with our
[1:46:21] hearts to step away from teaching and
[1:46:24] then Satan rose that right
[1:46:26] up and God came right down in a service
[1:46:30] and healed that condition. Hallelujah.
[1:46:32] She went through the test
[1:46:34] over at Mercy Hospital. Hallelujah. went
[1:46:36] through all that where everything was
[1:46:38] drugged up and so forth and you know
[1:46:40] that oh yeah there there it is and and
[1:46:41] you'll never you know never get beyond
[1:46:43] this and this and that. But one night,
[1:46:45] amen. In a service, brother Codre's
[1:46:49] first time here and what she had on her
[1:46:51] heart when she came forward was the two
[1:46:55] oldest boys. I want to see them saved.
[1:46:58] And she came forward. She came forward
[1:47:00] that night. And that's what she was
[1:47:02] asking God about. And brother Codre got
[1:47:05] back. Now Paul and Ben remembered the
[1:47:07] spirit of God moving in that service. It
[1:47:08] moved right down these hallways. Right.
[1:47:10] the service, it just kept moving. And
[1:47:12] right down standing outside of that
[1:47:13] conference room, I was standing there
[1:47:15] and both of them had tears and things
[1:47:16] welled up in their eyes. I said, "What
[1:47:18] that is, it's the presence of God and
[1:47:20] it's God calling to your heart right
[1:47:22] there, right outside of my office. We
[1:47:25] prayed the prayer of salvation and they
[1:47:27] turned their hearts over to the Lord."
[1:47:29] Brother Cadre came finally walking back
[1:47:31] down the highway. He said, "Who are
[1:47:33] those two boys, Brother Samuel?" I said,
[1:47:35] "Those are my sons." He said, "Tell your
[1:47:37] wife that that condition in her stomach
[1:47:39] is gone. She is healed in the name of
[1:47:42] Jesus Christ." She never said a word to
[1:47:45] him about that.
[1:47:50] God cares.
[1:47:55] Hallelujah.
[1:47:59] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:48:02] Glory to God.
[1:48:05] Hallelujah. that also will leave you.
[1:48:07] You'll be made well. Look, lady, what
[1:48:09] are you scared of? You got a nervous
[1:48:11] condition. It's been bothering you for a
[1:48:12] long time. Do you believe God can heal
[1:48:14] that nervousness? 90% of this audience
[1:48:18] is vibrating with the same thing. You
[1:48:21] want a place to put your foot always and
[1:48:24] everybody's telling you get next to
[1:48:26] yourself.
[1:48:28] But you've got to have a starting place.
[1:48:31] You're on it right now.
[1:48:34] The word of God says you're free.
[1:48:39] I say we're in the spot right now.
[1:48:42] Oh, it's not this building. It's not
[1:48:44] 1530 Lake Breeze Road. It's in the
[1:48:47] presence of Jesus Christ.
[1:48:51] When the Holy Spirit has revealed to you
[1:48:54] what your need is, if it's for the Holy
[1:48:56] Ghost, if it's for healing in your body,
[1:48:59] there is no other higher court of
[1:49:02] appeal.
[1:49:04] The Supreme Wicked One has spoken.
[1:49:08] There is no greater place to be because
[1:49:11] you realize your judge has become your
[1:49:14] attorney
[1:49:16] and the word is speaking on your behalf.
[1:49:22] This is your spot.
[1:49:25] Hey, this isn't just a good service.
[1:49:26] This is your place right here this
[1:49:28] morning. This is your spot to step on
[1:49:31] nervousness. This is your spot to lay
[1:49:33] down fear. This is your spot to lay down
[1:49:36] and say, "The Holy Ghost is mine." This
[1:49:38] is your spot to lay down and say, "Peace
[1:49:40] is mine." This is your place to lay down
[1:49:42] and say, "Healing is mine." This is the
[1:49:45] spot right here this morning.
[1:49:48] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:49:52] Amen. And I'm just going to stop right
[1:49:54] here.
[1:49:56] And I'm going to say to you and ask you
[1:49:58] this question,
[1:50:03] can the
[1:50:04] God who performed the greatest
[1:50:07] miracle by changing your life,
[1:50:11] delivering you of the habits and holds?
[1:50:15] Sister Stephanie, the things when you
[1:50:16] were giving us testimony about things
[1:50:18] that you thought was going to be hard,
[1:50:20] the pants and other things like that. Is
[1:50:22] that right? I hope this okay. She
[1:50:25] thought it's going to be hard. I wanted
[1:50:26] her to give her testimony anyhow, so
[1:50:28] we'll just pull it out. The very things,
[1:50:30] this is out of her own mouth. She said,
[1:50:32] "The very things that I thought I'll
[1:50:34] never I'll never be able to to to let
[1:50:36] this go." You know what happened? God
[1:50:38] sovereignly came and took the desire.
[1:50:41] Good.
[1:50:43] She stood on what she knew was right.
[1:50:46] Stand on the word that you know that's
[1:50:48] right. You say, "Well, brother Samuel,
[1:50:50] it's not all about pants. It's not all
[1:50:51] about ungodliness." Those are all
[1:50:53] symptoms. I agree. But you can't let
[1:50:55] symptoms remain. You've got to let God
[1:50:57] come and bind up the wound. You've got
[1:51:00] to let him bind up the wound. Don't
[1:51:01] Don't Why let the wound be open? Why let
[1:51:03] it keep going? Why let it keep oozing?
[1:51:05] Why let grace abound?
[1:51:09] Why let it abound? There's mercy here
[1:51:12] this morning.
[1:51:13] And can't the same God, Hallelujah.
[1:51:17] Hallelujah. That delivered you,
[1:51:20] can he also
[1:51:22] give you, hallelujah, healing in your
[1:51:25] body? Amen.
[1:51:27] Can Can he also I'm just I'm just I I
[1:51:30] want to go down to just read. I got to
[1:51:31] read I want to read this quote just very
[1:51:33] very very clearly. He said, "Can't he,
[1:51:36] the God that saved you from sin, can't
[1:51:39] he give you happiness and peace and joy
[1:51:43] and heal your body and rapture you up
[1:51:45] into glory?
[1:51:48] Can't the same God who saved and
[1:51:50] revealed himself to you? The same God
[1:51:52] that's done a work in your life, can't
[1:51:54] he restore to you your peace? Can't this
[1:51:57] same God take away the weariness in your
[1:52:00] life? Can't this same God restore to you
[1:52:03] your joy? It's nobody else's joy. It's
[1:52:06] your joy.
[1:52:09] Restore unto me the joy of thy
[1:52:12] salvation. Lord, I want my joy back.
[1:52:16] I want my health back.
[1:52:19] Maybe you're standing here this morning
[1:52:21] as a waywarded one and you say, "I want
[1:52:23] back as being a son and daughter of God.
[1:52:26] What rightfully belongs to me. I'm not
[1:52:29] going to live below my God-given
[1:52:31] privileges no longer.
[1:52:35] [Applause]
[1:52:38] Do you love him this morning?
[1:52:41] Let's stand.
[1:52:45] Hallelujah.
[1:52:49] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Flashing
[1:52:53] red lights of his coming.
[1:52:55] But the flashing red lights of his
[1:52:57] coming within them red lights. It's not
[1:52:59] just red lights of a train track. I see
[1:53:03] the lights of that ambulance.
[1:53:06] I see the lights that's showing light on
[1:53:08] the path of how I can walk out of here.
[1:53:11] Hallelujah.
[1:53:12] Are you hearing me? There's a strength
[1:53:15] here this morning. Yes, there is. Amen.
[1:53:17] You've been looking for many places to
[1:53:19] put your feet.
[1:53:21] Praise God. But he's here.
[1:53:24] But the question is, do you believe?
[1:53:27] Amen. Will you accept that this morning?
[1:53:30] Will you accept that and walk and walk
[1:53:32] with that? Will you accept that reality
[1:53:34] that the Holy Ghost is for you?
[1:53:38] Will you take aside every unbelief and
[1:53:40] unreasonable thought like we did moments
[1:53:42] ago? Will you just put that down there
[1:53:44] and say, "Of all the times of trying,
[1:53:46] but this is my spot right here, right
[1:53:48] now." Because you know what it is? God
[1:53:50] has sent an ambulance for you.
[1:53:52] Hallelujah. He cares that much for you.
[1:53:55] Now the question is, he cares. Do you
[1:53:58] care? That's right. Do you care enough
[1:54:01] that he was willing to send an ambulance
[1:54:04] to bring you to a genuine faith? For
[1:54:07] whatever your need was. That's so good.
[1:54:09] Oh my. What we see is the story of
[1:54:12] redemption.
[1:54:14] It's a story of love.
[1:54:17] It's a story of grace. It's a story of
[1:54:19] Almighty God sweeping down to pick up
[1:54:24] you and I.
[1:54:26] He's here this morning, friends. He's
[1:54:29] here to give you the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:54:31] He's here to give you the Holy Ghost.
[1:54:33] He's here to take each and every one of
[1:54:34] you to a deeper place in him. Amen. Let
[1:54:37] me just say this to you. God knows what
[1:54:40] your need is. And you can make that need
[1:54:42] known to God. But let me just say this
[1:54:44] to you. Don't look at your need without
[1:54:47] looking to him.
[1:54:48] Because your need will only be as
[1:54:50] overwhelming as it's always been. That's
[1:54:52] right. That's right. But look to him.
[1:54:54] Amen.
[1:54:56] When snake When the snakes had come in
[1:54:58] and begin to bite Israel,
[1:55:01] God instructed Moses. Look at God's
[1:55:03] provided way.
[1:55:05] He told Moses, he said, "I want you to
[1:55:07] get a a pole and I want you to take that
[1:55:11] take a serpent, coat it there in brass.
[1:55:14] Let it be crystallized.
[1:55:17] And I want you to put it up on the
[1:55:18] pole." How high should I put it? 3 foot?
[1:55:20] No. I want you to put it so that it's
[1:55:23] raised up. Hallelujah.
[1:55:26] Because I want them to be able to look
[1:55:27] and see. Well, what are they going to
[1:55:29] look and see? They're going to see that
[1:55:32] sin has already been judged.
[1:55:36] Amen. Where did he get that inspiration
[1:55:39] to put that serpent on the pole? Because
[1:55:41] of the fall that took place in the
[1:55:43] garden.
[1:55:46] And in heaven, Lucifer,
[1:55:50] that old serpent.
[1:55:53] Who led the first rebellion? I wanted to
[1:55:55] be lifted up. Yes. I wanted to be
[1:55:59] exalted.
[1:56:00] What must they do? Look and live.
[1:56:06] To look at that and
[1:56:09] recognize that should be me.
[1:56:13] And when you recognize that should be
[1:56:15] me, you know what's happening? Your will
[1:56:18] is dying out like the life of that
[1:56:21] serpent went out. So good. Wow. And when
[1:56:24] your will dies out, then the life of
[1:56:27] Christ
[1:56:28] who paid the price on Calvary raised up
[1:56:31] on that Easter morning comes back inside
[1:56:33] of you. Yes, it does. Praise. And it
[1:56:36] says concerning you, you are my
[1:56:37] righteousness. Yes.
[1:56:40] You are my
[1:56:43] justification. He is my justification.
[1:56:46] He is yours. So what must I do? Look and
[1:56:51] live. Amen. Sure, we pray for you this
[1:56:55] morning. You're free to come to the
[1:56:56] altar. We're however you feel led to do.
[1:56:59] But I I want to worship him. I want to
[1:57:01] right here this morning. I care. And you
[1:57:04] know what? I'm not here just to have a
[1:57:06] ride in this ambulance. This isn't like
[1:57:08] showing up to safety town and they bring
[1:57:10] the ambulance and fire trucks like to
[1:57:12] show to the kids and the kids are just
[1:57:13] enamored with it. He came from me.
[1:57:18] Thank you, Lord. I'm saying he came from
[1:57:19] me right here this morning. He came for
[1:57:22] me. Yes, he did. Did he come for anybody
[1:57:24] else? He came for me. Oh, brother
[1:57:28] Samuel, that's me. That's emitting
[1:57:30] defeat. That is not I have need of him.
[1:57:34] Maybe it wasn't for your soul this
[1:57:36] morning. Maybe your soul is anchored
[1:57:38] away. The desires of the world is gone.
[1:57:40] There's just, you know, Lord, I love
[1:57:42] you, but maybe he came with his
[1:57:43] ambulance to pick you up in your
[1:57:46] weariness.
[1:57:48] Thank you, Lord.
[1:57:49] Maybe he sent his ambulance here this
[1:57:51] morning. Yes, Lord. To put you on the
[1:57:55] stretcher of his grace.
[1:57:58] Hallelujah. And where you could never
[1:58:00] get to and say, "I can't get to that
[1:58:02] place, but he's come." That's right.
[1:58:05] And really, the real true mode of
[1:58:08] transportation is on his wings.
[1:58:11] He's come on his wings. Hallelujah. You
[1:58:14] know what that means, Sister Barb? He
[1:58:15] never come to walk us somewhere. He come
[1:58:17] to pick us up. Hallelujah. That's what
[1:58:20] this message is. It's a rapturing
[1:58:22] message. It comes to pick us up. Why?
[1:58:25] This is where our trouble is. This is
[1:58:28] where our trouble is. This earth. He
[1:58:31] comes to lift us. That's what the Holy
[1:58:34] Ghost coming in. The quickening power.
[1:58:36] What does it do? It comes to bring a
[1:58:38] lift. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:58:42] To take us where we need to be.
[1:58:45] [Music]
[1:58:47] Blessed be the Lord. I know I have you
[1:58:49] do this a lot and I'm not doing it by
[1:58:50] ritual, but would you mind just yielding
[1:58:53] your hands for just a moment and lay
[1:58:55] them on the person next to
[1:59:00] you? This is not a form because you know
[1:59:02] what I believe, brother Ricardo? I
[1:59:04] believe this that the Bible said they
[1:59:06] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:59:07] shall recover. The prophet tells us that
[1:59:09] same quickening power is right in the
[1:59:12] body. Hallelujah. You believe that this
[1:59:14] morning? Hallelujah. I want you to pray
[1:59:17] for that one you've got your hands on
[1:59:20] right now.
[1:59:23] Go ahead. Right here.
[1:59:25] Heavenly Father,
[1:59:27] Lord, we thank you, dear God, for your
[1:59:29] mercy, Lord, here this
[1:59:31] morning. Lord Jesus, you have sent the
[1:59:35] great ambulance, Lord God, into this
[1:59:38] building this morning. You know, Father,
[1:59:40] the needs of every one of your children.
[1:59:43] You know the need, Lord God, of my
[1:59:45] sister, Lord, my mother-in-law. You know
[1:59:48] the need, Father, that Lord, that she
[1:59:49] has upon her heart, Lord. You know the
[1:59:51] needs throughout this building, Lord
[1:59:53] God, through every brother and every
[1:59:55] sister. Lord, we are confident in the
[1:59:58] wings of Jehovah. We are confident,
[2:00:00] Lord, in the great wings of the Holy
[2:00:03] Ghost. Lord God, I pray. Heavenly
[2:00:06] Father, may the sweep of the Holy
[2:00:09] Spirit, God, may it, Lord God, sweep
[2:00:11] away every unbelief, every unreasonable
[2:00:14] thought, Lord God. May you move down,
[2:00:17] Lord, I pray, God, in your glory, Lord
[2:00:19] Jesus. May you feel, Lord, empty hearts,
[2:00:22] Lord God. May you refill, Lord, lives,
[2:00:25] Lord. May you touch, Lord God, the weary
[2:00:28] in heart and spirit, Lord God. May you
[2:00:31] restore to them, Lord, the joy of their
[2:00:34] salvation. Touch those, Lord God, that
[2:00:36] are sick in their body, Lord, the
[2:00:39] infirmities, Lord God, that might be in
[2:00:41] their body, their mind, their spirit.
[2:00:43] You're the Lord that healthth all
[2:00:45] diseases.
[2:00:46] [Music]
[2:00:47] In the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:00:50] Christ, Satan, you're defeated.
[2:00:53] You've already lost the battle. And our
[2:00:57] great kinsman, the Lord Jesus
[2:01:00] Christ, has descended right down to our
[2:01:03] need. He's found each of us right where
[2:01:06] we're at. And our hearts, our lives are
[2:01:09] yielded to
[2:01:11] him. We're carried to the end. We're
[2:01:15] carried to the table. We're carried by
[2:01:18] the presence of almighty God. And in the
[2:01:21] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, for the
[2:01:24] blood that speaketh better things,
[2:01:27] Satan, hold your peace and take your
[2:01:30] leave and come out of this people in the
[2:01:33] name of Jesus Christ.
[2:01:36] Amen.
[2:01:40] Hallelujah.
[2:01:43] [Music]
[2:01:47] Hallelujah. Oh, let's say thank you,
[2:01:50] Lord.
