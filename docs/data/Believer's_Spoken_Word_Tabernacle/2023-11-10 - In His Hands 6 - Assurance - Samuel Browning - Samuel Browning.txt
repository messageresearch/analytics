what we were searching for it was was the presence of God that was drawing us Braham said what it is he said God fulfilling his word is what makes the creation in you not a word from a previous hour but the word of this hour and that's what makes the creation in you that's What Makes You hunger That's What Makes You thirst it's God fulfilling his word amen because we've not been drawn to a church we've not been drawn to a personality we've been drawn to him our father amen so thankful for that amen let's just go to him in a word of prayer tonight Heavenly Father Lord how thankful we are Lord for these moments that you have given to us Lord that we can gather together father with brothers and sisters of like Precious faith and Lord in these moments Lord we believe father we are our Witnesses and we also believe that God just what you do in just a few moments of Time Lord It's Eternal Lord there's an effect oh God Upon Our Lives I pray father May the influence of the Holy Spirit Lord through the word god May Our Lives be so influenced Lord by you and to you Lord you know every need that's gathered here Lord Lord God under the sound of our voice those that would stream Lord

moment Lord we pray Lord we just ask Lord for your touch Lord upon your children Lord different ones Lord dealing with different needs as the request went up Lord we just ask that God that you'll just visit every heart Lord move move on every life Lord in a very special way Lord we just give ourselves to you now Lord we stand here Lord by your grace father once again in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you amen if you turn with us in job 23 and it's so good to good to be back and as Paul said that was his first time flying that he remembered he was a little boy last time real little guy he was able to sit on his mom's lap the last time so he had kind of a baptism by fire this time I almost felt like I was making an overseas trip uh you know you fly to Atlanta and then from Atlanta over to Washington was over five hours on the plane there just from Atlanta to Washington so uh and you know it's not like it used to be you get a a big package of almonds with only three almonds in it and uh you know the napkins this big you know no but uh you know it's just uh little things and uh but we're just thankful to God for his mercy and just thank you for your prayers and I know you I know the Lord was really mindful of us here in a local assembly we were able to tap in when we landed there uh then driving up to where we needed to go two hours north of Seattle and um we were able to stream into the service and uh so that was really wonderful as well and it's pretty neat to hear you all all here the Sunday morning service and then we're just getting ready to go to service over there on Sunday morning so uh we just appreciate amen God's faithfulness and uh when I was listening to brother Nathan uh Minister uh little bits and pieces because I was trying to finish because I had to preach Sunday night and so I was trying to make sure I was ready to go for Sunday night and I was hearing the the thought coming and I thought my goodness it's like what I just preached last night there when we were preaching on the thought of God and that's my you know how mindful God is of our needs and uh my the word has such strength in it for our lives to encourage us I tell you if we ever needed encouragement it's right now and the only and the what's what gives us real courage is the word of God Amen what God knew and what God saw and what he sees in us so I just uh just so thankful for that uh so we want to look here in the word in verse 8 and um I know these scriptures you could probably you've probably uh We've read on them enough you could probably know him by heart now but uh we want to just draw from the thought here we don't want to just know him by thought by memory we want to let let God have an effect on our life amen what he what he desires to bring out of here so in verse eight behold I go forward but he is not there and backward but I cannot perceive him on the left hand where he doth work but I cannot Behold Him and once you to notice job knows he's working he knows that God is working but he says I can't Behold Him I don't know what's taking place right now he hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him so that's the manifestations of God I I can't see him but job says from the left hand I know he's working verse 10 but he knoweth the way that I take when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold I want to really draw from these verses tonight my foot hath held his steps his way have I kept and not declined neither have I gone back from the Commandment of his lips I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food I want to just pull from even that on verse 12 remember God had wrote the first Bible was in the heavens job job knew it you'll hear job recite this even as we come to further chapters job will recite certain constellations and things that's there and their meaning but job knows him by vision and so what job is saying is I'm just not content with what has been written there but I am waiting because man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God so job says I'm struck striving to live by every word that proceeds out of his mouth amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word this evening I want to just draw continue on that thought of in his hands and um I really want to take the word just to allow a word for a subtitle or thought in our hearts is that of assurance I think there's no greater thing than Assurance when a person has assurance it's a confidence that's not a it's not an arrogance it's a confidence that brings a peace it brings a settledness it brings a rest now these scriptures we read here in verse 10 11 and 12 they are wonderful statements and I don't want to just say it statements just to be as those statements but they're wonderful thoughts that have been expressed but for you and I standing on this side of calvary and having the understanding where we've been admonished through the scriptures as even Jesus himself when he came he let the disciples know that be of good cheer for I have overcome the world in the world you'll have much tribulation so he's letting them know there's going to be much tribulation that even though you're receiving the promise of what God has given but yet there's going to be much tribulation Paul even spoke of this witnessing it not only the Believers could witness it in Paul's life but Paul would talk about the admonishment and strength that he and other believers had received from the Saints in thessalonica Saints and other places and just watching their steadfastness under the midst of trial because you recognize there's something greater than just the DNA of a person I think that there's one thing about it between us as Believers if there's something that we look at within one another we don't want to emulate one another or take one another's Spirit we want to be able to recognize it's Christ and my brother it's Christ and my sister and that's what it is that challenges or provokes our life unto good works because we recognize in our flesh every one of us in our flesh uh our flesh is no good but it's Christ on the inside that's what's good it's Christ and that so when we see this in verse 10 11 and 12 remember job doesn't know what's taking place he's looking at it in a manner when we read these scriptures job's looking at it in a manner as though remember I don't understand what's going on he's longing to hear from God he's looking at it within this part that everything that God has asked and required of me I have done it and I've not done it in a manner of fear I've done it because what he's revealed to me so job is is looking at it in in in a way when he doesn't understand what's taking place but I want to bring it to us as Believers that as Believers sure when things come our way we come to that place sometime times and it seems odd when things take place we're trying to kind of gather ourselves and maybe make sense of it and and there's an evaluation that comes upon our heart of is everything right with God and that should be a reflection in our life I I think that ought to be that ought to be something that's very apparent about our lives is is everything right with God because you know knowing that there are times that God will allow afflictions and allow things to come our way that's actually God trying to get our attention and bring correction to our lives and then there's other times where the tests and trials it's actually molding it is not anything that's wrong it's just God bringing more of himself out of our lives and so we want to be very clear and I think we've said that here over the time is that we just don't want to you know uh make an assumption and say that everything coming my way well it's just a trial but we want to be able to understand is it indeed a trial or is it correction is that right because God has promised he won't lose one are you hearing me and as a Believer there's things that we want to look we want the word to examine our lives and I believe the Holy Spirit it will bring us God listen God knows how to work with every one of our Lives we could say to one another examine Our Lives examine Our Lives examine our lives but you know God I've watched things just over the years I've been serving the lord God knows how to bring things to a place to where a life will really come to a place of examining if there's become a veil around that life and there's things that they themselves cannot see yet in the mind think everything's all right God knows how to break that Veil he knows how to break that and he he doesn't need me or you to break that Veil God knows how to break that Veil because remember you're his children we belong to him he's our heavenly father and so with that in mind I I look at these scriptures here that there is a a a a bless blessedness of an assurance that we uh are to have as a Believer and brother brandham you know in this message I've heard but now I see it I I just continued over months just continued to going through this message and brother Bram says it like this in that message he said job knew that he was right I think that's a powerful statement brother BR said in another place job had a noo Fellowship he knew where he was standing and I tell you in this we're living in it's important you know where you're standing Faith and Hope listen they work together but if if there's no faith and it's just hope hope can be the biggest enemy of Faith because what faith does faith is the revelation of the will of God and Faith deposited in the heart brings a hope which is an expectation for what's been revealed hallah and then that's that's then that in itself it's where there's a love of God operate in our life so job knew that he was right even when all the accusations we've looked at when friends wanted to come when uh you know church members and on and on as brother BR put that there and everything was coming around to him to accuse him and you realize God has permitted this God could have stopped every bit of it but God has permitted every one of these things to come from that of his his children being taken for all those things but God didn't do it he permitted it and God didn't permit it because job was out of the will of God job didn't God did not permit it because he was going to correct job remember as we looked at a couple weeks ago he was purging job and purging is where where there's growth and then we trim off certain things that come out of that growth we're in interested in more growth not just a bunch of lifeless shoots is that right we want everything channeled in our life there's a channel that God operates by so when we think of it of how that God will test his people at times and in this case brother Bram picks it up in this same quote in this case it was God testing job look at this statement the best man there was on Earth at the time that's a a powerful statement how could he been the best man on Earth at the time is because he was under the blood he was in fellowship with God he valued God's word more than he valued his own lifeall he steamed the word brother Rams picks the scripture up and then in the church age he says that the elect of God will esteem the word of God above everything else above every idea above every opinion they will esteem it more than their necessary food and he says they'll yearn to live by it I don't want to just know the word the word was meant to be lived are you with me the rain falls soaks me but the rain did not fall to what my clothes the rain came because there is seeds in the ground and this word come that it might fall in the very midst of our life and bring forth what are you saying brother Samuel I don't want just a good service I want to see God in my life I don't want just a feeling I want to see God in my life the best man there was on Earth at the time now watch this now he was holding him then who was holding job God was holding him the Revelation makes a man upright not just good in his living but it makes him upright from one who is cast down to one who is upright in the presence of God because that he knew Job was a prophet that had a vision from God he had exactly done what God told him to do and God was Duty bound to keep his promise to him if if you've not been through this message in a while it'd be good to go through this message I've heard but now I see I can't even tell you how many times I've just continued to come through it actually since last November but in this message brother Brandon is laying it very clear we want God to do things for us then make sure everything's lined up hello make sure everything's lined up in order for the fire to fall on Mount Carmel remember Elijah had to come bring the altar in order had to put the wood in order and the sacrifice had to be in order then the fire would fall that was according to the word so it's to place ourself into that place and say well God how can I come into that rightful place be obedient to the word whatever the word says do do it and don't wait for well I don't feel anything I don't feel anything special we're operating by the word making ready for the fire to fall sometimes we get so prone to we have to have a feeling for this well I have to have a feeling for this I have to listen the word is the word and the word's been sent before us is that right the Bible said even Paul said there are things that don't even have to be revealed to you it's recorded in God's word let every man know how to possess his San his vessel in sanctification and honor is that right the prophet said you really don't even need a revelation of order be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ it's written right in the word but you see what's happened is you you we can look at that and say Well it's got to be revealed it's got to be revealed that the word of God is a truth not man's ideas about the word of God that's what we've been called out of ideas of man opinions of man we've been assembled to the person of Truth himself Hall and all Christians now watch this all Christians has got to be that when the last struggle of our life comes com and death rattles are in our throat we must still hold steady and remember that God said I'll raise you up again at the last day see that's personal it's got to got to hold that our testimony our place in Christ we've got a hold to that excuse me our testimony our place in Christ our position what we are knowing that we have kept every word of his commandment blessed are they that do his his Commandments that they might have a right to enter in and when we know that no matter what anyone else has said this is what's powerful we've kept every Commandment that we see in the Bible that God has done told us to do with reverence and love and respect to the Creator who wrote the Bible there's a lot that could be said and preached within that is to do everything with love with respect with with that of who of of the great creator of what he has wrote within his word then we can stand there no matter what accusation comes you have an assurance of where you're standing with God this is the hour of great Assurance let me tell you something I have watched countless videos of this of Israel of the Israeli troops of the different things that they have said and even seeing them preparing to go into war let me tell you something even the reporting I've watched one gentleman that's been right there with the military going right into Gaza and everything say over and over is God is with Israel let me tell you something I say Amen to that it's true they got to be called to repentance but God is with them they picked on the wrong people you cannot defeat the promise of God you can't defeat it pardon me for saying it but it shows the insanity we've seen in our nation for years now and all around of individuals Marching for things it's Insanity are you hearing me I'm not making a political statement I'm just pointing out the condition of people it's insanity but God said he would preserve Israel pray for the Peace of Jerusalem and I say it in this in this manner right here that Israel when them soldiers going into battle and watching and just listening and taking that in they're not going in there with just some haphazard thought you realize there's one individual I saw 95 years old reenlisted I said oh God let that kind of zeal fall among the people of God come on church let that kind of Burden fall on lives just say hey wait a minute I need to be in the house of God hey it's important for me to pick up and get with it hey it's important for me to be active in the duty of Our Lord if they can get that excited and listen that's not a workup these are people that are committed right let me tell you that's what the Rapture is going to be about people that are committed to the vision of the Lord let me just say this not to put a damper on anything but if you're halfhazard halfway in halfway out up and down and in and out and you know really ser serving God doesn't matter you're not that diligent about it you're making preparations to be left behind but the same you're trying to bring fear upon no I'm not I'm trying to tell you the truth because that kind of an attitude is not a Rapture attitude is to alert and be awaken awake thou that sleepest now how did we get here but we're talking about Assurance assurance so the resulting I I want to just look at this from Assurance you know how many knows that in a trial that's a time to yield how many knows that it's a time to yield now when we're complaining we're not yielding and listen let's just be honest sometimes in our flesh we go through that and we have to come back and say Lord forgive me let's just be honest we're not talking I'm not talking to Sons and Daughters of God and I recognize we have to come back to that sometimes we have questions of why sometimes the grumbling that comes but here's what's important is you've got an assurance on the inside that brings you right back to where you need to be because the trial itself it's a moment to be yielded in the hands of God let me look let me look here in the scripture for 2 Corinthians chapter 4 verse 17 for our light Affliction I wonder how many eyes Paul got when he wrote this light Affliction it should be heavy heavy duty for our light now watch this he is he is writing this under inspiration of us to consider that the Affliction that the test that the trial do not make more out of it than what it actually is for our light Affliction which is but for a moment do you realize how many came when the Bible said be faithful unto death there in that saman age and they came up to a place and there were those who were taken captive had the identity as a Christian but when they came there before the soldiers whether it's the arena or the state there were numbers of people that recanted how could they have recanted because they didn't have Assurance Assurance will affect your conduct but then you have others like polycarp that's walking and he hears a voice voice of the Angel say Play The Man Play The Man In other words stand like a man stand like a soldier of God stand steadfast polycarp could hear the angel just for a moment for those who recanted for just a moment of relief where are they that's right but for those who stood just under a moment what it seemed like it might have been hours it might have been days come on the Bible said there were those in Hebrews 11 that suffer C cural tortures but in all Essence it's a moment I don't care if it's days hours months it's a moment compared to Eternity it's to evaluate these things on that kind of a scale for our light Affliction which is but for a moment oh I love this worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of of Glory so what's working for us is to perform to accomplish to achieve what is it is that light Affliction that trial that test working out in our life see job didn't have the understanding of what was taking place in his life and that's why Satan was whipping him couldn't move him off the sacrifice but he was whipping come on three kinds of Believers as long as Satan could make job think it was his God that was doing it he had job whipped yet you couldn't move him off the sacrifice right but yet within it to understand that it was working that things that were taking place what job didn't know God was making something out of him God was working in his life J knew God's working but I don't know what's going on but here's what's important you and I cannot we cannot Escape we'd like to find exit signs like that in a test or a trial but Samuel why are you preaching on tests and trials cuz the majority of your Christian walk is tests and trials are you hearing me well I don't have test and trials then you might want to check your experience you might want to check where you're at with God I don't go out looking for tests and trials neither did job but remember brother BR said persec utions are a normal part of the Christian Life is that right and he said every church has them he said the church that doesn't is not God's but this is what's important is I'm we're not looking for my flesh looks for an exit sign let's just put it that way my flesh looks for an exit sign even my spirit would look for an exit sign my flesh my spirit wants to see an end to it right but yet the Soul on the inside that's the control tower that's what's important to bring everything else in line in the midst of that time and yield to the Lord in other words when Paul said I will glory in my infirmities Paul said I am a worshipper whether I'm up or whether I'm down whether I'm going on the mountain or I'm in the Valley I'm a worshipper now sometimes you notice people's worship and their worship will let you know where they're at now I'm not saying that we don't get down friends but what I'm trying to say is is that within it is don't let circumstances determine your worship because your worship is not about you your worship is about him who is the worthy one so whether I feel like it as far as I feel maybe chills or that that had nothing to do with it it has everything to do with he is worth Worthy is that right now notice this is what's important in verse 18 while we look not at the things which are seen that's what can get us in trouble is when we look at just what we see right that's where fear can come in that's where depression can come in so there's a place that you and I can look to friends what a what a privilege you have as a Believer a place and access to be able to look at things which are not seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal let's just bring this down right into shoe leather it's just like if you would get a report about your job oh they're going to do this X Y and Z well sure those things can it can Fear Can want to come in but if there is that hold on the inside that says wait a minute in the word he says I've never seen the righteous is forsaken pause I am one of the righteous ones by his grace not by my own doing now let's continue I've never seen one of his children begging for bread and I have the confidence that whatever door that God has opened that God will keep open as long as it's his will whenever God sees to fit to close it then he's got something better for me in mind that's able to look beyond the things that we see Hello sometimes the initial news can take the maybe take the breath out of us take the air out of us so let's not dehumanize and move us away from the humanity that we're surrounded in but let us remember that there is a place within us that is so much deeper and so much greater and a place that we're to draw from to affect us and move in this realm you see this this worketh for us is a far more an exceeding Eternal weight of Glory you know the whole thing that really when it comes down to it about us the thing that we take care of so much and we have to clothe it wash its hair and buy comfortable mattresses for it man comfortable chairs and you know have maybe have the heated seats in the car we baby it it's the thing that is worth the least amount 150 lb is 84 so I mean you can figure well wherever you want to figure you are you might be over a dollar but still compared to the soul the soul is worth more than 10,000 worlds that's the whole purpose of Calvary sure he took stripes for the healing of our body because he knew while we would be here in this life we would need Divine assistance there would need to be healing while we are here and our character is being molded and we're serving the purpose of [Music] God but that's the real value is to have Christ's character inside of us molding our own life making us you know when you look at that of gold and probably there's others here that's maybe more astute and on this than what I would have ever been with gold but you recognize that gold itself to be the purest it would be 24 carats many times within jewelry and things like that they'll have a certain carrot percentage within it it might say 18 carrots but it all has to equal out to 24 so that would mean if there are if it's 18 carrots there are six other alloy materials that make up that piece of jewelry or whatever it is but then in order to get that gold out of it or for a pond broker to test it to see cuz you can take a piece of gold to him they don't know that that gold itself that it's gold through and through they don't even know how much to even give you because it might be that it's a piece of an article that's simply coated in gold and it's not very many carrots whatsoever but then again it might have that piece cuz most every jewelry jewelry is not you will not find a piece of jewelry that's 24 Karat because gold is too soft it has to has a part within it of other mixtures of alloy silver lead and so forth that are all part of that compound to actually make it strong whether it's necklace ring and and whatsoever more but in order to make it to take that let's say they were to gather up a lot of gold it maybe chain and everything else think about it when they would make even that in the uh in the Ark of the Covenant and all of those arrangements in the Tabernacle God remember what God said it shall be overlay played with pure gold now they brought that stuff out of Egypt but that stuff they brought out that jewelry was not pure gold but it had to go through a process it would be like them wanting to get make gold bullion or gold blocks out of something they would actually have to take that gold whether it's in the jewelry the ring or whatever more and they would have to so put it together with uh with another combination sometimes borax and things like that and they would bring it together and when they would also put lead within it the the gold itself will sink down and Unite with the lead and the rest of the materials float free then they'll take the gold and the lead and they'll take that and in order to separate the lead out of it they'll take another process and separate the gold and Lead then it goes down you got to get the silver out of the gold they'll take you through another process sometimes the nitric oxide and things like that and break it down to where all you're left with is pure gold brother Samuel what are you say that it's a process because the character in our life it must be a gold likee character he said at the Book of Revelation in the lady of see and age buy of me gold that's been tried in the fire a pure gold that's why the coming of the Holy Ghost in This Hour is not a mixture of man's ideas they had mixture down through even in ausa Pentecost there was a mixture within it but God in this last days was not just going to release a portion but it would be the fullness of Christ himself coming free from any mixture that's why the bride in this hour the marriage of the Lamb has come because not only is the Lamb here but there's a bride on the scene that can receive the material the true gold of God and be brought forth and presented to him this is all God's work so the same part working in our life it's called working in our life God will take a hold of a life he's working out you know all the different things like brother Bram let me just read this quote out of time test Memorial memorials he said long years ago before they had the smelters they used to take the gold how they would know how that it was right or not with all the sludge was out of it all the iron pyite the Fool's Gold how many glad he takes the fool's gold out of you and I glad he takes that or say now I didn't have no fool's gold in me now you're foolish to think that you did we had fool's gold in us but see what the presence of God did was to separate us from everything that is not or will not bleed to Divine Assurance all the fools out of it beaters beat it beat it turned it beat it turned it until the beater sees his reflection in the gold that's the way God does his church he gives you trial after trial tell test after test trial after trial boy this sounds right don't it test after test until the Life of Christ is reflected in your life until you become peaceful sober Meek gentle humble ready submissive willing anybody else can say help me Lord Oh Brother Sam I've already arrived there yet really why are you still here why are you still here well I'm just in a holding pattern just to show everybody else what an example looks like oh really really I thought he's the Prototype I thought he's the example that every son and daughter of God is to be like in that case if God wanted to bring another example he would have left the prophet here because in our generation that was the closest that would have been upon Earth to that of the life of the Lord Jesus is that right a son of man revealing the son of man now here it is in Bride form is that right but notice God working individually you know many of these parts and things in our life that it would be things that nobody else would know about us sometimes these are things that we don't even know are lacking or that we should be we think we're in certain places in our life and God brings us through certain things to bring us to a place of recognition do you realize that even in the test or trial you or I do not recognize oh I know what God's doing he's trying to make me more Meek oh I realiz no that's a no it all God is not doing it that way but God brings us to a place of submission how can the how can the clay tell the Potter I know what you're doing right yep you're working Pride out of my life yep I know it it's divinely revealed to me we don't know it I said we don't know it you see that's all part of submission is we submit like job listen job didn't know what was taking place you or I know when a test or trial comes we've examined our hearts and examined Our Lives then we can stand there with an assurance that I know there's nothing between God and I and if he wants me to know anything he'll let me know it but in the meantime I'm going to keep on keeping on is that right that's not going to be a time that I pull away and pout on God get CAU on God well I'm not praying as much I'm not being that diligent within the word I'm just kind of down and and I'm just a little bit sad no that's a time to keep standing there what a joy that is to a real believer when you know that there's nothing in your life between you and God and if there is something when you repent of it and you make it right what a joy it is that you can stand in the presence of God while you are waiting for inspiration to drop I know it's been said a whole lot you know but it's true it takes a whole lot more muscles to frown the Bible said happy is the people whose God is the Lord is he your lord well then you ought to be happy that doesn't mean that you're a bubble dancing and running but it means there ought to be a happiness about your life there ought to be a joy no you don't understand this situation it didn't say happy is the people whose life is perfect who everything is smooth it said happy is the people whose God is the Lord not happy because everything is going my way or let's bring it up to this present day happy is everything when I've got Good Vibes like a young man I was sitting beside coming back from Australia he said yeah he said you know everybody was really friendly over there and and everybody said I just got Good Vibes when I went in the restaurant what in the world I mean some of this is just like I look at and think everything that we live around is based on Vibes and feelings when I went around so and so I didn't get Good Vibes I went around Lord have mercy we are people living off of feelings I pray to God that for the the Bride of Jesus Christ for us as children of God then we're not living by our feelings because by our feelings the devil will whip us every time is that right but he cannot set his feet on the Blessed ground of assurance that's down in the soul brother Bram said many times look at this turn your head from the things he's he's doing this so that we'll turn our head from the things of the world and look straight to Calvary to the one who's doing the beating many times you think it's strange because fiery trials and sickness and persecution no is it incredible because not all of us have the same trials and tests no we don't they're all remember brother Ram puts it in the church AG book personal Temptations seasons of Temptations so it's things that's so fitted maybe if God took your test or trials what brings test and trial what is test and trials it's breaking us down so more of Christ can come up maybe putting that that upon somebody else somebody else think you know there ain't nothing to this right here but God knows for each of us what's [Music] needed I want you to watch this statement I'm about to read you can probably read it up there ahead of me but there are times we need listen friends we need the right hand I'll probably not be able to get to it tonight we need the right hand as a matter of fact that's what holds you and I up that's what gives us strength that's the that's what brings the Assurance in our life but in our life when the molding and the shaping and the working is going on it's not red sea parting Jordan parting it's us yielding and God working because remember when he was led as a lamb to the slaughter dumb before her shear our identity was in there to be shaved off for wool to be cut off many times he says you think it's strange because fiery trials and sickness and persecutions it's only done to test you to get the dirt out of you to get the sludge out of you to get the slowness out of you to wake you up to the place where you can look and see the reflection or men can see the reflection of Christ in you Christ in you the hope of glory now I'm sure probably what I'm getting ready to say nobody else has ever felt this way so you know you just say oh man brother Samuel's so carnal but there's things that I God has brought out and I have seen in my life and I thought man oh man years ago I thought I was hitting high on the hog I mean I felt like man I had a hold on certain things but you know what God permits those things I think I probably am the only one feeling that way but there's certain things you begin to realize you see what I'm trying to say is there's certain things I could not see and God didn't ask you he doesn't ask me to come to a to your life and say hey here's a clipboard here I think I think you need to work on this in your life you're a character what good would that do you understand because just telling somebody does not mold character the preaching of the word right here does not mold character that only comes by test and trials the preaching of the word is to let you know who you are to encourage you to inspire you God will impart strength to your life to keep pressing in what he's called you to that's why it's important for the ministering of the word cuz if we're not receiving the ministry of the word then we find ourselves not progressing and not living up to the purpose and calling of God like we need to be is that right so things that God will work in our life and bring out God wants to bring the dirt out of us God wanted to bring dirt out of Samuel brownie he wanted to bring sludge out of Samuel Browning oh brother Samuel you mean for yeah for years God works and he works and he works and the thing that I can look back down through time not just years and years ago but I can look back down through there and say God thank you for your mercy when I wasn't even aware of it but there are things that in your own time and in your own season you see fit to work out at that time think of it how would it be if you went into a class let's say you signed up for art let's just pretend you weren't good in art you were like me that couldn't even draw a stick person and you went in there to sit down what if somebody overwhelmed you and started critiquing every little thing that you did and every little part you ought to sat like this you ought to be doing this you ought to be doing that you would be so overwhelmed you'd say what's the use of trying right see God doesn't do that God does not overwhelm us at the beginning he doesn't overwhelm us God knows what we're able to handle he knows the tests and trials and what we have need of to be molded out in our lives at that time he knows the strength that we need he knows the encouragement God knows the encouragement that you need in every service and he'll move a little bit of that of the right hand and give you encouragement just to let you know and remind you I'm right here that's right right but it stabilizes us it stabilizes us when we can look to the Unseen and that message looking to the Unseen brother Ram said when a man once catches that vision of the invisible God and knows that he's always present there's something that stabilizes that man's thinking it stabilizes his action in the time of distress and trouble do you catch what's being said here it'll stabilize his thinking it didn't say that his thinking may not try to spiral but there's something there to stabilize it it didn't say that in the midst of it that his actions may not get a little bit I don't understand I don't know but there is something that's there that'll stabilize his actions so let's just give Glory where it belongs it belongs to the Lord it isn't that man that is such a tremendous brother a tremendous sister they're always saying the right thing and responding in in the right way but you ain't seen them behind closed doors you ain't seen them when they first got the news so don't make an idol out of 84 cents worth of dirt let Christ be your example sure we see him sitting in the house of God sing We recognize we as Mortals recognize the struggle within other mortality and we know that my brother my sister I may not know what you have went through and are going through this week but you're still standing you had to fight through thoughts you've had to fight through discouragement you've had to battle but look where you're at it'll still make him look upward this is why it's so powerful this is why the necessity of the Holy Ghost teaching will give out on you but to have the word himself on the inside you can't fail it'll make him look upward and above the things that are happening around him because he's looking at the Unseen yet by a promise so he not just vague but he's got a promise he's looking at the Unseen through a promise remember even how Abraham when Abraham didn't have a Bible but Abraham had received Revelation from God he received revelation God had spoke to him even by Vision when Abraham said I'm going to have we're going to have a baby the people looked at him and said you're crazy I mean think about it but you see what Abraham what have been revealed to him that nobody else could see what did Abraham do he acted on what had been revealed see Abraham wasn't just going along and saying oh this is what God Said do and this is what God said Do no whatever what God had revealed to him is you are going to have a son so Abraham made preparation for it when the baby came along then they saw what he'd been talking about brother BR says when we can act whatever is in our heart when we can act out that Revelation then other people see God in you see it's acting out what's in our heart let me just try to get to a place here tonight Ephesians 1:1 and whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will I think this is powerful because our lives are not spent should never be spent on trying to figure out how can I fit God into my purpose no you got the wrong you got the wrong way it's the purpose of him all things work together to his purpose it's not seeing how God can fit into your purpose what's important and where overcoming and strength lies is to find out where you belong in his purpose because that's the purpose that's Eternal out of that all these other things it's temporal jobs and everything else sure God puts it on Earth to do a certain thing but that's temporal one day if God carries you'll not be doing that of course I don't know in the environment we're in if there'll be in retirement but you know if God terries we won't we won't be here so what's important is to realize what's the Eternal part the Eternal part that's what everything else that we live by we operate by so if there's anything that's going to be accomplished in our lives it's got to be because of his doing notice this is what the whole point is that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ let me read this next scripture in Revelations 3:14 and unto the angel of the Church of the lady oans right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I want you to watch how brother Bram takes this I don't think I put this in the in the notes Brianna but just just listen brother Bram takes this scripture and he says now I want to show you what I find in the thought of faithful I love that I love that the same inspiration of God takes it and says regarding overcoming the thought of that scripture is not so much what we are to overcome but it's how because the what makes no difference once you know the how is that right the thought of it now watch this you know we often talk about the great unchanging G Now watch how the prophet places this whose word does not change and when we speak of him after that manner we often get a view of him that makes him seem very impersonal it is as though God made the whole universe all the laws that pertained to it and then stood back and became a great impersonal God it is as though God made a way for salvation for lost mankind that way being the cross and then when the death of Christ was a atone for our sins his resurrection gave us an open door to him God just folded his arms and stood back it is as if we majored in believing in a great Creator who having created lost personal interest in his creation he said I want to say too many people are apt to think that way but that is wrong thinking thank you Lord hey if there's ever a people that need this you and I need it the faithful and true true witness but that is the wrong thinking for God is governing in the Affairs of men right now he is both Creator and sustainer let me just tell you none of this right now that's in the world has taken God by surprise there's things that's taken You and I by surprise even over the past few years right lot of things but never taken God by surprise God's in control of it he's watching over it he's governing in the Affairs of men now notice Colossians 1:16 and 17 for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones dominions principalities Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist he is a sovereign God and by his own counsel he purposed The Plan of Salvation of his own elect which he fornew the son died upon the cross to establish the means of Salvation and the Holy Spirit carefully executes the will of the father he is working all things at this moment according to the purpose of his own will he is right in the midst of it all he's in the midst of his church this great Creator savior God is Faithfully working amongst his own right now as the great Shepherd of the sheep his very existence is for his own he loves them and he cares for them His Eye Is ever upon them oh he says our lives are HID with Christ and God I'm so glad that my God abides faithful he is true to himself he won't lie he's true to the word he will back it up he's true to us he will lose none of us but raise us up in the last day I am glad that I am resting in his faithfulness aren't you glad for that and this is that faithfulness the prophet quotes being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ Christ two more scriptures and I'll close the Lord will perfect that which concerneth me I I believe these ought to be confessions if there's one thing we can have on our phone instead of having all them news apps and liars and everything else coming up we ought to have this kind of stuff popping up of a morning notification the Lord will perfect that which concerneth me reminder 12:00 p.m. the Lord will perfect that which concerneth me reminder 300 p.m. the Lord will perfect that which concerneth me I'm fine with those kind of notifications let them be a banner everything else in front of me thy mercy oh Lord endureth forever forsake not the work of thine hands Romans 8:28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the call according to his purpose all things even the things that are not good he didn't say the things are good all things work if we can accept it even our mistakes will work for the good if we're willing to accept his Grace Grace place that God would instruct us God would move Upon Our Lives guiding us back in the right way helping us strengthening us you know it's not comfortable to look at your mistakes it's not comfortable to look at where we failed but my heart's desire believe it's your heart's desire I don't want to displease the Lord I want Christ to be glorified in my life not a billboard to where that it's everybody else has to see but I this just for me it's something beyond what everybody else sees it's that Assurance in my heart it's an assurance that listen that runs that runs in our life that even takes in our thoughts on things our attitudes on things our feelings on things because we can be very good at hiding our thoughts or our feelings about things but if we're allowing around you long enough we know when you're faking come on church right we don't want to be fakers we don't want we want God help us Lord are we going to get to a place to where oh my when a test or trial comes my when we don't feel it in our flesh or in our spirit no but it's recognizing instead instead of just staying in a place of complaining grumbling instead of looking at it well when this is over I'm really going to give a testimony how about just be a testimony while it's going on I I want to be a billboard that displays Jesus Christ I don't want to be a billboard that says Hey Brother Samuels Under Pressure right now friends I'm not putting nobody down but I'm saying we don't want to be that way because it isn't just about showing that to somebody else it's about God working in our lives he's wants to work in our lives and a test or trial is just not an automatic guarantee that he's working in our lives will we yield because Paul said three times I prayed God take this from me take it from me because you know what Paul looked at this is a hindrance that's how Paul was seeing it it's a hindrance I have to write in big letters my eyesight coming and going it is a h an but then when God let him know my grace is sufficient for you Paul he didn't have to tell Paul Paul this is why and this is this and this and that we realize Paul recognized that that messenger of Satan was given to Buffet him to keep him in a place so that God could actually use him to the purpose he was called for and Paul knew he was called for God knows you and I we need that and this is why Paul said I will glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ that word power of Christ means the tent of his dwelling May rest upon my life I want him to be pleasing I want to be pleasing to him don't you Lord that even in the midst I want to be able to raise my hands I want to be able to worship I want to be able to say Lord just give me Grace someone Lord what what it is that you're bringing out of my that as a test or trial sometimes the durations can maybe it'll be a little bit longer and there are things that God can begin to point out in our life that's so specific but it doesn't never produce uh I know what this is about but it brings about when God makes that known Lord help me I I I don't want that to be in my life in that way I've given excuses for it I've given reasons that it could dwell in this Temple but now you've allowed this to come about to show me that there are things to be molded in my life the trial never came to destroy you the test never come to destroy you it came to free you it came to free you when they walked into the fiery furnace they were bound explain to me how the ropes were burn off of their hands explain that to me how that happened and yet there did not smell of smoke on their garments how did it burn the bands on their hand and not singe the hairs on their arm you can't explain it the only thing you can say is it's God and every test or trial that God has ordained listen God's not on the outside of the Furnace when they went entered in amen when when they entered in there was the fourth man he was already there waiting on him oh friends Hallelujah he hasn't stepped back as an impersonal God even when we're in the midst of the test or trial he's not far off he's right there there's an assurance he's right there I know where I'm standing with him I know what his desire is for my life and my heart says amen he's right there oh I say Lord just mold me make me Lord give me the strength I'll say it like this as we close in this moment give me the strength to stand how that I should stand the way I should stand give me the strength to stand as a Son of God as a daughter of God in the midst of a test or a trial you love him amen musicians would you [Music] come sometimes we don't get to the parts and places I think my we I told you when I first started preaching preaching this I said it'll probably take three parts and I'll move through it that's how I seen it when I preached it as one message and brother Nathan's but we just skipped over a lot of different things and points but you know I believe with all my heart that God comes to encourage us and remind us he's right there with us he's right here with us he's leading us he's guiding us I think it's an opport opportunity for us as Believers I think it is it's a real opportunity surely when every test or a trial comes our way as a Believer we examine our lives and remember God doesn't hold anything back from you if there's something that's out of place or out of line God doesn't hold that back but you also know that God will test you according to the word that's been delivered it's just like a person surrenders their heart to God they repent of their sins maybe there's things and habits in their life they're still struggling with they're coming into that place of sanctification and they leave out of a service or a time and they begin to make a confession of what God did for them on a service on a weekend or wherever it is and they begin to confess but B says you as you confess what he's done he said you watch you to work righteousness in your life now watch where the test or trial will come you have those at work family others around you will laugh at you but understand it really isn't those people it's the enemy trying to use and pull upon them to accuse you in a way to pull you away from what God has begun to do in your life then you take a life that then begins to God is cleaning that life up up and here it comes into a place desire after desire is leaving habit habit after habit things are leaving and then Satan will come along and try to accuse him well that's just you doing it on your own you know Works don't get you very far it's just you trying to do it but say how do I know that that Satan watch the effect it has on you discern the Spirit not by what's being said but by the effect it has on you if it's trying to tear you down then it's not of God because nobody can take desires out of your life but God himself there's things that you can have self-will to say well I'm going to stop doing this I'm going to stop doing this but what's different is when desires are being taken it's because the love of God is taking greater preeminence in your life habits do not flee out of law they flee out of divine love coming forth then how the enemy can come around bring accusation it just he the way that he'll try to come even when lives his lives have been changed transformed by the spirit of God Satan will come around and he'll want to try to bring accusation with that well that's just you there's nothing really different about your life but you see that's where it's got to be something that you know that within me it's not I who's living I never brought this change in my life he did am he's taken out the desires of world and he has placed his own life within H how do I know that because he has changed me from Death unto life my whole desire is to please him that's all I live for that's all I care about that's what every decision in my life is weighed around and even when I've made something a decision something I'm a little unsettled about I bring it right back in line and say Lord is there something that I make a wrong move see this is where we want to be stand standing and I tell you stand on what God what he's doing in your life stand but always keep moving have an assurance that you can stand in your life where God touches your life God draws your life and you keep walking with the Lord even after the Seal of the Holy Ghost has come this is really where job was standing accusations all around him but to know that God is worth [Music] working oh my you love him God is working I remember when the Lord first got a hold of my life my goodness man everything you seem like you're walking on clouds man alive I can still remember my dad in the other in the other church when he was preaching in one night dad got the preaching and he talked about how the enemy wants to come and say well you ain't even bride and big mouth me sitting on the second row or front row I said you got to be kidding me never forget dad just stopped the service and said Samuel thinks I'm kidding see I hadn't come into those places yet what I'm saying is is that the tests and trials you know this I'm speaking many I'm speaking to Veterans even been serving the lord youall longer than me but even to recognize does Satan ever pull it back does Satan never pull back on on anybody and say I tell you what man you're right on the money no no no remember he's always there brother BR tells us like this for every servant of God I don't believe that's just prophets or that's just ministers when I hear brother brm say that and I have heard but now I see I believe every servant of God is one who has a heart to serve God he said Satan is always there to accuse that servant of God let me just tell you something no matter where you're at your walk with God you know what the ultimate goal is but don't bow down to Satan's accusations keep going on because he doesn't know you he doesn't hold your identity it's Christ who holds your identity I tell you if this is a service that it was a service of salvation and God saved my soul I would be on fire with salvation I would be thanking the lord and I'll tell you what the rest of the people here would be thanking God with you we understand there's more to it same thing with sanctification same thing with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Seal of God I say Lord keep molding us Lord may we stand with that Assurance when that all sorts of accusation can come around may we stand with that Assurance Heavenly Father oh [Music] Lord father how we are so thankful Lord in the times of your working in our lives times that we're not seeing the right hand as far as manifestations those are all necessary and Lord God we desire him Lord we we know Lord Jesus that you're still the miracle working God but Lord in our lives individually I'm thankful we can come to a place as Believers that in order for us to have Victory we don't have to have every moment a right- hand manifestation Lord not that we're bigger not that we don't need you but we realize that even in order to stand in the time of a test or trial it takes the right hand of God to uphold us so sometimes Lord when we look at it after you have drawn our lives and our hearts to you Lord you've brought Lord a a transformation in our lives then Lord God as we are there being held in the right hand of God Lord how powerful that right hand is I think of when the prophet himself was standing there and his wife had been taken then he stood there right up next to that little crib that little unit where little Sharon Rose was at he said he couldn't tell me that there wasn't a god but he what he wanted to try to do is convince me that he didn't love me oh [Music] God as that conversation went on Satan coming into the reasonings the prophet tells us Lord every reasoning was agreeing with him he said I was about ready to say if that's the way he's going to be but he said out of that Soul oh he said think if that new birth that TI poost hadn't been there out from within came forth the voice though he slay me yet will I serve [Music] him Lord Jesus that's the right hand of God it did not take away and bring back sister hope it did not bring back sister Sharon little Sharon Rose it didn't bring her back but the right hand of God upheld the prophet during that time as the left hand was working did it all of a sudden that moment go away no Lord God as those Lord of us that have been around the message that even though I've ministered on these things last fall within some of these parts he was in despair he didn't want to live any longer he went Lord while working on those lines to reach out and touch that power voltage he took the glove off his hand then he said the next thing he remembered was waking up on the ground not knowing how he got there there Lord it shows there is a purpose the purpose of God that cannot be defeated what was it that upheld the prophet during that time the right hand of God but the right hand of God did not restore back sister hope little Sharon the right hand of God right away at that moment did not do away with the depression and the despair because Lord as it is mostly everybody sitting here tonight all of us Lord know what it's like to lose a loved one sometimes there's been situations that's more tragic than others Lord and we receive comfort from you but lord it's through that Comfort Lord that ministers to us that goes to work to give us strength to help us where that holes in our heart if there once Lord that's their spouse has went on home to Glory waiting on them Lord God the right hand oh God you hold us up Lord oh Lord Jesus if there's one thing when we're looking for a manifestation may we see Lord the right hand in our life that's holding us holding me giving me strength day by day Moment by moment Lord at your right hand while the left hand is working thank you Father help us Lord as your children that we can just help us to get out of the way Lord Lord help us I include myself with this prayer Lord God the way that we feel at times Lord our flesh our spirit Lord I'm Grateful I'm so glad that there's one on the inside to direct us Lord I'm glad there's word I'm glad Lord there's a word in this hour I'm glad Lord there's Ministry I'm glad there's other brothers and sisters in the body Lord that they may not know what's taking place but God to be sensitive Lord to be an instrument oh God to be an instrument to encourage somebody else along the way [Music] oh God help us Lord Lord as we need one another we need Christ in one another Lord I pray right here tonight I want to be an available instrument Lord how many tonight would concur with that agree with that say Lord I want to be a faithful instrument Lord to you a part of the body Lord that you can use help me to be sensitive Lord not just about my needs but be able to minister to help one another to encourage one another maybe God wants to use your fingers to send a text to remind that the right hand is still holding [Music] them oh God help us Lord Grant it Lord we pray Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen could we [Music] stand completely to you Lord yes Lord Jesus fill me with your thoughts make all brand new change my [Music] life let me live all that's true for I just

all that's true I just want to think like you something keeps holding me I think it was just just powerful the services the Lord brought here Thursday and Sunday brother Nathan preaching on that God's economy brother Alex who was ministering on the adjudicator of a greater world just tremendous God reminding us and calling us to our high calling and then to think within that of the economy of God every one of us is everything is so unique the way that God has made us God hasn't made every one of us just exactly alike even though the calling that God has for us everything is always it's it's Unique it's personal so with that comes the personal molding personal testing personal because God knows what he's wanting to bring out of our life when you consider that our light Affliction worketh for us an eternal weight of glory god getting out all the sludge I I I hope I believe we understand it you know there's things that God used even when I taught school God will use even others is not just things God just this situation happen God will use sometimes the situations that's around us to help us to see the greatness of our need for him or just how we need more of you how we need you you know God will even do that you can be witness to somebody talk to somebody and you realize it's like running into a brick wall all of a sudden why would that be well you could say well brother Samuel they may not be ordained of it no it might be that God has said you've done what I've asked you to do now pray and look to me is that right sometimes it's us to get Stones together get the O wood together get the sacrifice together but only God can bring down the fire and so sometimes these things that God permits different things to come our way it's what we are in God's economy that adjudicator of a greater World M it was a masterpiece weren't they those services I don't just say it because they were what was preached but say oh God let the word so soak down in our lives we want to be changed we want to be molded Lord help us for the High Calling of what God has has for us I tell you when I listen to that I I I listen to that the services when I'm not here I look at that as well oh Lord how you love us and you care for us to come and speak God would speak so personally to our lives I Got Confidence his word God sends his word to hit the mark in our lives don't you I got
