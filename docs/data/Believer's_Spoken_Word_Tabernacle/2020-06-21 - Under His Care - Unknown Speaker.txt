see each and every one of you and different visitors we have god bless you amen I brother Chad I know you didn't come here to hear me preach you came up here to fish oh my the Lord is so good at me it's so good well we just want to turn our attention to the word of the Lord this morning just ask the Lord just just speak to us in a very special way and I believe he died believe he is I believe he'll he's gonna do that for us because we need to hear from him I pray that it'll just be that I'll be able to get out of the way and my voice my voice it's not my voice that matters it's him coming through that voice you know there's a lot of things they heard when the his brother bran would tell us like this when Pearl Harbor was under attack and the people he said they they were all out you know the the the soldiers and different ones they were out you know carousing and having a good time nobody could believe that that danger was approaching and there was there was messages announcements that went out across the radio and they heard it but they ignored it and brother Brown made this statement he said it wasn't he said that they didn't hear the message they didn't hear the message that was in the message there was there was a real certainty that was sounding within that and I believe with all my heart we're blessed people if we can have ears to hear what the Spirit is saying we can have a heart that'll just say be it unto me Lord just to yield to him and allow him to accomplish what he desires to accomplish in our lives amen let's just look into the word of the Lord and here in Matthew chapter 6 and verse 25 would you mind if we just pray before we read here in the scriptures Heavenly Father Lord I know Lord that we could read your word it's it's not so much that we have a certain time that we have to pray the Lord we're just asking that you direct every part of this Lord that you'll just come Lord as you press the thought upon my heart Lord some time ago and I ask that you'll come Lord I'm not sufficient to deliver this Lord but you are father so may you just come Lord and just speak lip to ear to us this morning minister to our hearts what we have need of for your your faithful Lord your watching over our lives Oh God you know every little detail Lord and now we just pray and ask that you'll minister to the needs of your children Lord as we just place them there on your great altar Lord we lay in there in the name of Jesus Christ and ask that God you'll just move for every need in a special way in the name of Jesus amen amen verse 25 here the Lord Jesus said take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body than raiment behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly Father feedeth them are ye not much better than they which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature and why take ye thought for raiment consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these wherefore if God so clothe the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you O ye of little faith therefore take no Thought saying what shall we what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed for all these things do the Gentiles seek for your heavenly Father knoweth that you have need of all these things but seek you first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things you catch what it is things all of the other parts are things all these other things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof may God bless you bless the reading of his word you're being seated this word throughout the scriptures that we've read here in Matthew you can lead the account and Luke as well the word thought that is used here throughout each one of these scriptures where it's admonishing us take no thought for these things the whole the word that is dealt with here is means to be anxious or to be troubled with cares now I thought of this just you know some time ago and just thinking of these parts is the Lord just laying it upon my heart some weeks ago and I thought about something come back to my heart the Lord brought it back of while brother Branham would describe and dramatize that of a little Robin he said you know he said there was a story where one little Robin said to another one I wonder why those human beings walk around so downhearted and they look like they're so selfish said I wonder if they haven't got a heavenly father to watch over them like we Robins do so maybe that's about it you never heard of one of them having high blood pressure did you did you ever see them on crutches going to the hospital to be operated on no they got a heavenly father he watches over them and he takes care of them but we know more than they do you know and so we have to be cut on butchered up and all kinds of diseases and fuss and fight with one another and that's the way we do in Matthew chapter 6 verse 34 the last Scripture we read I want to read this one out of the amplified version so do not worry or be anxious about tomorrow for tomorrow we'll have worries and anxieties of its own sufficient for each day is its own trouble brother branham made this statement and this is where this is this very quote for weeks I does the first time I'll read it but this is where the inspiration broke within that of stability and in unstable times brother branham we would say this God don't want you to be frowning God wants you to be happy the human heart was made to be happy worried will cause cancer temper will cause cancer don't never be upset just walk in his love amen boy if it was only that easy but it is I said but it is it's always the devil's business to make things complicated but remember God is hidden and revealed in simplicity Jesus took such the great depth of things that you and I could be worried about and he would direct the attention to show the care of our Heavenly Father how he cares for the lilies of the field how he cares for the robins all of them think of it Solomon had to pray God give me the wisdom that I need to lead these people God give me let me have the the coming out and the going in may you order and direct my steps and and Solomon even and everything that of all that he would give himself to which is what God would even call of our lives but yet he says consider the lily what is it it is that the lily itself it doesn't have anybody out there to water it you don't have anybody out there you know to dig around and and put some fertilizer on it and sprinkle Miracle Grow on it and put Osmocote I don't have none of that it is that simply toil and it's taken care of knowing now notice this this is where this comes in now with that that statement we just read don't never be upset just walk in his love amen knowing that you're walking in him nothing can harm you there's nothing can harm you there's neither powers things present things future nothing can separate us from him were in him and we never come in by our own will he by choice elected us and brought us into him amen we only surrendered to the choice that he already made so it's his business to take care of what he has took himself no man can pluck them from my father's hands because he's the greatest of all of them amen it's the father who takes care of that who's got any more power than God so what kind of a power have you got over you to take care of you the whole powers that created the universe's they men that took the solar system and blew like that and every star went to its place sure and he watches over you that's the kind of a father we have happy Father's Day papa amen Charles Spurgeon would ride it like this anxiety does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow but only empties today of its strength Martin Luther would say like this pray and let God worry Winston Churchill I may not have been a believer but yet truth is truth when I look back on all these worries I remember the story of the old man who said on his deathbed that he had had a lot of trouble in his life most of which had never happened now let's look at this great God who has his hand upon our lives their heavenly Father in Isaiah chapter 40 verse 12 here's the question that is asked who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and meted out heaven with the span and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance I say he's bigger than my problems he's bigger if he can measure the waters the waters of this earth in the hollow of his hand you don't need both just one hand his balances he's able to weigh the mountains who have directed the Spirit of the Lord or being his counselor hath taught him with whom took he counseled and who instructed him and taught him in the path of judgment and taught him knowledge and showed to him the way of understanding think of this science itself studies what God has already done science breaks in and says this many atoms or molecules or whatever more it never did like chemistry whatever more these these compounds and how you break this off of and and this particular law of physics of potential and kinetic energy and all these other things those are only laws not that man came up with and begin to look at certain things and principles and then they would tack their own name to it because it's something that was already here but they themselves would put their name to it as though they discovered something it was already here they didn't create it they didn't make it god these are laws whereby that are said that even this of the earth and how that it operates whole mind think of this how that these very things as the Bible would say in verse 15 behold the nations are as a drop of a bucket and are counted as the small dust of the balance so in other words after you get done balancing out the mountain the dust that's on your balance that's how they're there counted so small behold he taketh up the Isles as a very little little thing and Lebanon which is not sufficient to burn nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering Lebanon is known for its great forests and woods and you need the wood in order to burn the sacrifice all nations before him are as nothing and they are counted to him less than nothing and vanity to whom then will you like in God or what likeness will you comparing to him the workman melteth a graven image and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold and casteth silver chains he that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image that shall not be moved this is to me the whole is the part that just gets me when you read about idolatry and images the person that makes the God actually had to make the God but when you meet this God the Living God you realize he made me and this God this Living God that you and I our Heavenly Father brother William I don't have to pick him up like this plant and say well come on you know I'm moving over here now and I need I'm going to pick you up and I need to carry you with me that's not our God as a matter of fact he picks me up when I get down he picks me up when I need encouragement he lifts me up a man he fulfills his promise that his sons and daughters he would live and walk inside of us oh I love this have you not known have you not heard have had not been told you from the beginning have you not understood from the foundations of the earth it is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in that bringeth the princes to nothing he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity think how many times his brother bran would say how far you have to dig down to find where the writings about Pharaoh are but our Heavenly Father is the same he's the same what he did back there he's the same today oh he says yeah they they shall not be planted yet they shall not be sown yay their stock shall not take root in the earth and ye shall also blow up on them and they shall wither and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble to whom then will you liken me or shall I be equal sayeth the Holy One lift up your eyes on high behold who hath created these things that bring us out there host by number he called them all by names by the greatness of his might for that he is strong in power not one faileth this great God that we've just read about above everything yet this great God would come down and take kinship with a man that was lost he would be made flesh in order to redeem us throughout his humanity he would experience and allow himself to experience many of the things that we deal with on a daily basis he didn't have to do that that's part of his love and yet he would come down to redeem us brother Bram says it like this and the message the power of the devil he says a long time ago when I got saved about 23 years ago I made up in my mind like this I wasn't going to worry about anything God said because God is able to keep his own word any job that's too big for God to do what's the use in me worrying about it whew if he's Almighty God he does all things if he can't do all things he's not Almighty God so I believe him to be Almighty God now what's this so I commit myself to him my soul to him my body to him my living to him my breathing to him my dying to him my resurrection to him and some glorious day he will come to commit ourselves as it would even as David would portray it in the Psalms I believe in Psalms 37 commit your ways unto the Lord it says roll your cares upon him so this morning here just for just for the next few moments this is what I want to even to begin to look at here under his care and we would see this in a time that we're living and I think you know in a time of things that we're seeing and we are experiencing around us we would have never a year ago I thought many times I thought my goodness a year ago who would have even seen this coming who would have ever thought this would be this way there's not one of us that are in here that has experienced this in our lifetime there's not one of it now know there's a lot of things that we can argue we we understand that what we're dealing with the pandemic it's that the virus itself is a real thing is it as bad as what the other pandemics that have been in the past well I don't know about that but I know one thing that is for sure that God knew that we would be here in the midst of this time he knew that there were these situations that would arise and God knew that we would have to go about our daily life our daily walk there are things we would have to do things we'd have to attend to and God would allow a situation to arise it would test us it would try us and I'll tell you what it's a pressure that ads all around us but yet within the midst of it God would call us as his children to be able to live in the midst of this time when people could say aren't you afraid about getting sick aren't you afraid about this and aren't you concerned about this and aren't you concerned about this let me just put it to you this way as I've said it weeks and weeks now there's no way that I'm gonna walk in to a ward where there's cold in nineteen now I'm not I'm not on plan on doing that if I know somebody has it sorry I love you but I'm gonna get next to you but I realize this one thing but how many times that with that and other things that God has kept his hand upon my life it does not make me a careless in the sense as though that I don't have to take certain precautions that's not what the Lord Jesus is talking about here whatsoever but he's talking about that in our lives should not be so vexed with anxiety and worry and fear and where we're trying to cross all the T's and all the gods and all of these things yet he wants us to walk with a perfect settled peace that he's got this under control we are here in this time God knows exactly where we're at and our trust is in him now what you think of this here in isaiah 32 verse 1 behold a king shall reign in righteousness and princes shall rule in judgment and a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind and a culvert from The Tempest as rivers of water in a dry place has the shadow of a great rock in a weary land I won't ask you to raise your hand but there's no doubt every one of us we deal with worry we deal with anxiousness we deal with stress we deal with pressure if you're living and you're breathing you're dealing with it we're not exempt from it it doesn't matter who you are it doesn't matter how Revelator's you are it doesn't matter how full of the Holy Ghost you are it doesn't matter you don't get away from press from pressure from stress from tension from the anxiousness but there's one thing that we do have as a believer we do have a place that we can go to we do have a place where we can release when it gets built up in our life now brother branham here he is you know he's he's was growing and this I'm going to read to you he's Lee he's going to take this from an actual experience that he himself has just experienced when he actually had to step in and take begin to take certain calls for brother Neville because brother Neville had come to a place that he was completely rundown and exhausted and he could not go a step further so brother Branham draws inspiration from and from this experience that he has within a hospital but let's look here in the message letting off the pressure he says there is a pressure on the people today and that pressure has no limitation or any denominational lines it has no age line it has no respect to person it's on young and old good and bad it's on everybody pressure it's on everybody I mean think about it you know as children Silas you know I'm saying in school they tell you come on man you got to you got to do good you know mom and dad they're trying to encourage you hey man you got to do good you want to go to college someday hey you want to go to this and all those things are good things but sometimes it just adds pressure because sometimes you know as a young as a young male say young man sometimes it's hard to see when they talk about things way out there in life you're looking at it you're looking just from lunch to dinner and they're looking at long you know I'm talking about you look for long distance you're like dad I just have to take your word for it you know they'll tell you certain things because they have been through those pathways before and sometimes this is where faith comes in even within as you're walking with your parents there's some times where your parents they'll say things and you yourself you've never been there I've been there I never had never had experienced it when my dad would tell me certain things but I'm so glad that I listened to somebody who had already walked this path way before and was able to help me not make decisions for me but able to help me so that there were decisions made that I actually am benefited from today well if I'd only listened to everything that he said I would have alleviated a lot of other marks and everything else upon my life but nonetheless there is a pressure pressure that even comes from things that are good things you can have pressure that comes around you as a young person as a middle age or whatever more you can have pressure that comes in the workplace in the school from family you can have pressure that's all around you pressure to do this and pressure to do that pressure itself is all around us and it is simply even in the normality and the routines of life it's on young and old good and bad it's on everybody pressure we are living in a neurotic age nervous tension everybody is racing here and going there and going nowhere ain't that right brother Trevor on 480 racing everywhere going nowhere sometimes I've arrived been on 480 I don't know why they put cops out there Mazal just put up a sign indianapolis 500 it's just to that kind of an age and I know this church listen now I know this church would be plagued with that he's speaking in brother Rutles Church as everywhere is plagued with it the tabernacle is plagued with it everywhere the whole world it's a day of pressure per hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry up and wait gotta get to my doctor's appointment so I can wait wait and now you heard in the restaurant you're gonna be waiting drive 90 miles an hour and then to get home for supper and wait two hours till it gets ready brothers don't say nothing it's a time and in that rushing and speeding it gets you to a nervous tension the wife say something a little contrary and you want to fly off temper husband say something you'll Pat your foot and tell him to get in the room well now husband I don't want no words with you go out there wife oh I'm so nervous see what what's the matter all this together this tension building up then the results of it doing something wrong and acting out of place now it'll make the poor act that way it'll make the middle class act that way it'll make the rich act that way it'll make the wrong act that way it'll make the pretty good act that way it'll make that good act that way because it's tension steam that's build up it's got to blow it out somewhere if you don't you blow the boiler up hey you know not just when I was in school but sometimes when when I was teaching because some of the first building building I thought in was built in the late 1800s there in Sandusky and they it was just beautiful buildings and you know how it was in those you'd get to a certain time of the day and man that boiler heat was always so hot and then they'd get that certain time of the day brother Brian that you know when they clicked it off you do this ping ping cling cling cling cling cling cling cling cling cling cling cling cling cling cling and you'd hear it and other didn't certain times than they maybe they had to start it back up and what would happen is on the intake of that boiler it would actually get as they were taking in there and trying to build in there there with that water air would get in there and they needed to release the air that was within the pipes many of you see this even when you go to water your plants at first it it comes out then you get it sputtering out it's why it's air that gets trapped in there there's got to be a way to get that air out of there and there is what is called a bleeder and that were a pressure release valve that is able to help that of the air that steam that pressure that's built up I'm glad that we have a place I'm glad that we've got a place where we can let off the pressure low glory it's the right place to let off the press the pressure we've got a release valve that God has given to us he said ask the father anything in my name and I will do it he said now we'll find out it builds up as the day goes you talk to your boss if you're working Oh so-and-so and if you speak to the kitty come in here mama I'm there you're it builds up ooh ma you feel like you're going to your hand is going to come off how would he know I said hello how would he know I know I'm with it every day I know what it means it builds up because why there's no boundary lines that says pressure doesn't come to a prophet of God pressure doesn't come to a believer no no pressure comes what's important is that you've got the place to let it off think of this here thought of this the other night I was at a certain hospital and our pastor I thought he was sick but he had just wore out Ron Ron Ron Ron chilly just exhausted and some of them said they called up and they called in the office down there and asked if I'd make his calls well I had been busy with business acts all day and ministers from different places and I said yes well I went to make his calls no brother man talks about this here as he goes into the hospital and I'm sure that probably every one of us have experienced this when he walked up to the station and they were busy you know maybe it's a time of charting you're getting ready to get off of shift and and everything else and here somebody comes and says hey how can you tell me where a room so-and-so is there whatever more well you know just look this Wainwright down the hall then said then you know the nurse and Sarita okay he walks down that way can't find it comes into another place you know and he says I seen this doctor he said four foot high and four foot wide I asked James I thought about asking him sir he said where could I get to this particular room and he since then even as he looked at some of the doctors and other nurses he was getting ready to approach them but he could see within their countenance that the stress and the tension they were all built up so he knew better than to even try to ask them he was in a situation he needed help to get to the sister's room and eventually here is a nurse and he sees this nurse and he goes over to her and he says ma'am he says I'm trying to get to this room and this and that and she said what brother branham she said let's look at it right here she said let me just you know lay this out for you of how to get to this room you know it shows that even when you look at how that a nurse or a doctor or in whatever that you do for a living and there's things mothers fathers and everything else there are things that we do that are not necessarily sinful there are cares of life that we have and when we're looking at the cares of life sometimes it's that they can mount up sometimes you get to looking at something not I realize that every one of our makeups are different some of this is going to hell it hurt and it you know hit a certain way others have it or hit another way there's some of us and you know hey man I mean you could care less I mean hey if you have you don't get the garden weeded so what buddy it'll be there the next time but there's others of us that we don't only want the garden watered we want it we did water it and we want the furniture moved here this wall painted we would like to have this light fixture up we would like to have the gate fix that goes into the fence and we ain't even started on one thing yet and you know it's funny because how some of us would like to be able to say man you know when we get into those times I wish I had this person's personality and then the other person that just says hey man let me just take it easy everything's gonna be all right you know and you know each one of us within our makeups and our temperaments can actually get in trouble because in the things that are strong yet we could look at and say man that's a good quality you know maybe brother Joey's able just to relax right back I mean maybe he's got you know all sorts of work that needs to be done around the house or other things but brother Joey's able to kick back and relax and I don't know for the joy does this or not but you know you could look at it and say my goodness man I would love to be like that word brother Joey I'm always looking at things and everything I see is this picture needs to be balanced with this picture this needs to be level out here and this needs to be and you see wonder what it comes down to we're looking for that and say my I wish I could be that way we add pressure to our lives when instead of saying Lord just stopping for a moment and saying lord help me Lord just to focus on one task for this day I know that's not very spiritual but it'll help you I said it ain't very spiritual but this will help you you know we always talk about everybody you know mama always used to say this and they would tell you rome wasn't built in a day I don't think anybody's trying to build Roman here anyhow but they would tell you a roll man wasn't built in a day and this wasn't built in a day and this and that but you see that the complexities between it there would be times that maybe brother joy would say mind you know what I wish I had more get up and or I wish I had more of this I need to take care of this I wish I was like that it creates then a stress or attention and we both need help from the Lord for God to help us in those areas of my love our live he needs God to help him because look this can carry over into the spiritual maybe we get Lacs and lazy that temperament will carry over to where we're just lacks and say sera sera I'm going in a rapture I don't have to pray I don't have to read as much I don't have to this or that blessed God the Bloods got me covered and it can actually lead to a lukewarm life and then there on the other hand those who are so rigid and this and that and whatever more they never can come to a spot sometimes maybe to feel like they're good enough or that they've done enough yet they're always looking at themselves and looking at this all we need the help of God we need the grace of God in our temperaments in our makeups we need the overshadowing of him that sits on the circle of the earth to guide us through this time of pressure we need his leadership when God got ahold of my life it just made me aware he had his hand on my life the whole time and the longer that I served him it makes me more aware of just how much more that I need him today I thought of this brother brems said going on in that message I thought that's it letting off the steam everybody it's just becoming a neurotic age everybody is all built up hmm haven't got no time and that builds up to a place that it breaks up things it causes people to have hard feelings when they snap them off and say things you don't mean to say now everybody is guilty of it I'm guilty oh no you're all guilty whoo and the church said Amen we do things under pressure that we wouldn't do otherwise there's an excess pressure build-up today he says I believe it's the enemy coming down and pressing I believe it's the devil we know the coming of the Lord is a hand and the Bible said in the last days that the devil would go about like a roaring lion and if he could get you under pressure did you hear the statement if he can get you under pressure hurring running over something you will make decisions that you wouldn't make if you'd sit down and think it over I'm not going to ask you to raise your hands but there I think every one of us could be honest there's some times we've we've recognized over our failures and our mistakes of the benefit of just sitting down and thinking it over because we're trying to figure out how am I gonna make this fit how am I gonna do this how am I gonna do that and we can get so worked up with the how-to instead of just saying lord will you help me oh brother 7 you're talking about natural you're talking about natural things they remember in the Garden of Eden God release that there was power that was present for that of the furniture to be rearranged come on somebody for the tree to be lifted up I know the brothers said boy I wish I had that in one man power but you see it was things that they were not in an ageist us they're safe in God's pavilion it was not an anxiousness of hurry up let's get this done hurry up let's get this done but yet the pressure that we find around us the build up pressures that cone of pressures to do this and you say those are natural things but how much greater could it be if we could say Lord and just be honest with you I'm awful anxious about this Lord I'm worrying about I'm so tore up I'm not even settled about this of what to do here Lord God will you help us will you help us Lord I believe you'll find that he will open doors he'll make ways for you we're witnesses of that it's just sometimes we forget in and we get under the pressure of things that are taking place the Bible says in proverbs 18:10 the name of the Lord is a strong tower and the righteous runneth into it and dis safe he is our place of safety it's in him that we can go and let off the pressure you see we all can experience and we all experience the pressures of this life and the cares of it but there is a pressure that you don't have to bear and that's a pressure of where am I going it's my sole right with God you see there's a place that's provided the name of the Lord is a strong tower and all it takes is to run to that tap you've got to have a desire to get to that tower you've got to have a desire because there's a slayer there's one that's after you the devil is after your life think about this age we're living in you've read it and I've read it reports all around all around here suicide and then from what I then you get crazy things that what they're putting out from what I've you you read certain things that are out there they're putting certain things out for people to watch about suicide how dumb is that how nutty is that it shows you the insanity people are looking for a place to escape to where they can just read off the pressure in other words you can be who you really want to be maybe you really want to serve God and there's something that's pulling your butt you're looking at what are my friends gonna say what's my husband gonna say what's my life going to say once - all of those are suggestions from the devil to try to build pressure to keep you in the same state so he can keep on pouring on that pressure but there is a release valve the name of the Lord is a strong tower you can call on the name of the Lord and say Lord Jesus I need you as my savior I repent of my sins I need your saving grace Lord I need you to turn around my life I may know what I'm talking about when you feel the release and that release comes because your faith has been appropriated in the one who already paid the price for your sins in that awesome it's more than awesome it's wonderful he's our pressure release he's the one that releases the guilty and declares us innocent this is a City of Refuge we're talking about a place where you can take refuge where he's our desire he's everything to us oh well I feel pressured yes you still feel pressures but it's different you're in a place where there's one who knows all about it he meets every need just like he takes care of the birds just like he weighed the mountains with a balance and the nations are a speck of dust that same God is greater than every trial he's greater than all the pressure he's greater than all the what-ifs it listen to this in the fat tyrant age here quoting out of the scripture I will put I will put upon you none other burden the word for burden is weight or pressure the pressure of the Dark Ages was either bend or be broken bow or die almost sounds like it's repeating Don it it was the Inquisition the power of the Empire backing up satanic worship be organized or pay with your life each age had its pressures for example a great burden of the last age is the pressure of riches soft living who and nervous tensions in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in it'd be like brother Aaron giving me his suit coat to wear I think it probably fit around one of my arms you would look at that if I walked up here now I know in today's culture must have mana guys in style he's got a tight coat on well I don't like tight clothes but here you had having that coat on you would look at that and say brother salmon has gained in some wood sister Kim must be really feeding him good does he know the quarantine is over but you see that that coat you would look at and say that don't even fit you it don't fit you why are you wearing it that's how this age is not just the sons and daughters of God it's for all of humanity it's unfit you want to know why people are acting the way they acting it's because of who's in control I'm not I'm with the president I'm talking about Satan he owns the kingdoms of this world he took the Lord Jesus up and in a moment's time he showed them the glory but you let go you let the administration change hands and God will prove in the Millennium when there will be people who will walk out will come out from those nation's remnants who are left and have not even been regenerated and will come and be raised back up to walk here in the Millennium and the Bible says that the knowledge of the Lord will fill the land earth sea and sky and just that administration changing over the earth will have an effect so you see there's not one nation you can go to oh I'll go to this nation oh I'll go to this mission well if I can only go to the Bahamas I would escape all of this oh if I could only go let me just bring it down Puerto Rico Oh crystal-clear waters all I would wait in the waters and oh I would just be relieved it would work for so long guess what pressure be waiting on you for to get back you know how it is on Monday morning when you took a week off it's waiting on you get rest it up get ready to go and sometimes you were looking for such other places all if this could just if I could just go there there's nothing wrong with getting away nothing wrong with a vacation nothing wrong with doing those trips brother branham himself showed us by an example the effect of those things but if we in ourselves make that the place of the let off the pressure then I'm afraid none of us would keep on working we'd become bums we'd be one stimulus check after stimulus check and everything else and oh my I hope this is that I hope this is that you understand what I'm saying we would just become so complacent but you seek god that's giving you an a a better resource then God said put them in the toughest age where there's all kinds of pressure and I will give sufficient grace then they'll be able to stand in the midst of pressure the trials that come upon their life will be opportunities for me to make myself known think of that statement that I read to you in the beginning God don't want us a friend God wants to be happy now God don't want you walking around like some mean where you got something painted on your face because paint don't make don't mean you're happy paints only a false sign you're trying to hide something come on somebody you're trying to put something on the show for somebody else but you see it's got to be something that's not painted on it's something that is down in here and we need the help of the Lord because there's times we experience worry we experience anxiety we experience these things that come along our way is it any wonder how brother Brown would make the statement worried causes cancer temper calls us cancer to me when I've looked at these statements and you know over the years goes you've been here who have sometimes ministered on certain things that have been certain angles it's no wonder is it any wonder that this is known as the cancer Age is it any wonder that the angel of the Lord specifically told the Prophet if you can get if you be sincere when you pray and you get the people to believe not even cancer will stand before your prayer is it any wonder we're living in an erotic age let me just read you here a few little points from a medical doctor says stress is a part of life you feel it when you're preparing for the holidays stuck in traffic or worrying about a friend's health while a little stress is nothing to fret about the kind of intense worry that lingers for weeks or months and make it hard for you to stay healthy stress has a profound impact on how your body systems function says Lorenzo Coen PhD professor of on and on and on and on and on health experts are still sorting out whether stress actually causes cancer yet listen a statement there's little doubt that it promotes the growth and spread of some forms of the disease but simply stress makes your body more hospitable to cancer brother Samuel this is so simple I know I know but you see God sent a gospel that went from my soul first of all and this same gospel yet ministers to my spirit come on the Prophet would take time throughout the message take that in the message of greatest battle ever fought he would deal with all three realms and greatest battle ever fought and throughout the message when you go through it we found it in the scriptures as well the Bible tells us that this this of our body to glorify God in our body and in our spirit now I look at this stress makes your body more hospitable to cancer anybody want to make diseases hospitable no not all stress is equally harmful and we realize this there are two different types of stress only one seems to be really bad for your health that this said the particular gentleman there short-term or acute stress like the time you might feel before preaching I mean giving a speech or fighting holiday shopping crowds tends to subside as soon as the event passes maybe that's why I can take such a good nap on Sunday afternoon it's stress that comes from situations you know you can manage or we'll be over at some set time but long-term or chronic stress is more damaging that type of stress Springs from situations that last many weeks or months with no definite end point or instance going to end Paul my grace is sufficient sometimes we're looking for an end point you know how it is home brother Samuel when God did stent bringing me through this I'm gonna testify well wait whoa wait it's a testimony even as you're going through it he's keeping you he's giving me strength throughout this day throughout this week he's helped me in the little problems in the little things that concerned me along the way I wonder if we wouldn't take time like that I wonder if it wouldn't help us in these times when we have periods where there's no definite set time I know you as parents are looking at me right now as parents some of you are looking and you're praying earnestly or Jesus let them open the schools in the fall no online learning Lord see that's helping some of you right there no long term a chronic stress is more damaging that type of stress Springs from situations that last many weeks or months with no definite endpoint caring for a sick loved one or dealing with a long stint of unemployment or common causes of chronic stress this type of no end in sight stress can weaken your immune system leaving you prone to diseases like cancer it also ups your risk for digestive problems and depression you wouldn't believe some of the things that I've studied over weeks of how a many much of anxiety and depression and all the release of cortisol and all those things are so tied to sleep and diet well we need help don't we not McDonald's either we need help chronic stress also can help cancer grow and spread in a number of ways listen stress hormones can inhibit and then stop a process called a canosa's which kills diseased cells and presents them from spreading I mean those healing lays in the body life is the healer right Bodrum says and you got a cut put penicillin on that cut but if the man's dead you can put all the penicillin you want you will not heal up life is the healer to me I found that pretty fascinating because the atheist or the infidel that don't even believe in God when they've got even the slightest little cut or scratch guess what it's a testimony that there's one greater than you and he didn't even ask the atheists or the infidel can I heal you go Robina God stress can inhibit a process this process which will kill diseased cells and presents them from spreading has anybody ever thought about that do you go round of the day brother Chad do you go around in the day saying oh no sales these sales these certain sales I need you I need you to kill diseases you know we're walking all around and I don't have Lysol handy right now and I need you to help me I need you to kill all these diseases I need it I don't need it I don't know if I can be six foot away somebody I really need you're not going around like that if you went around like that you'd be a nutcase you can't go around like that but look for the joint this is something that God set in the body before the fall they never had to worry about this before the fall they never had to worry about this how much greater by God's grace when he can take us back to where Adam and Eve fell from by the new birth that you and I can have a resource in God to say Lord I'm trusting you over the direction of my body goes on to say chronic stress also increases the production of certain growth factors that increase your blood supply this can speed the development of cancerous tumors he adds I need just a little bit more you've got to find healthy ways to manage stress what can you do about stress removing the causes the clear answer for some of you that means befriending some people some of you it means getting off or getting rid of things on Instagram or this others it means stop partaking of certain headlines and getting your leadership through the local news or your direction through the CDC or whatever it is you understand it's something we ignore but listen there comes a time there comes a time we've got to make sure what we're feeding on this is one of the simplest things that they will tell you you want to get rid of stress first of all eliminate what's causing it if you can sometimes that's easier to do than what we think but that's not always possible when it comes to types of things that cause chronic stress even if you can't rid yourself of the source of your stress you can learn to manage it this can help you keep a lid on chronic stress you know I think I'm gonna read this brother Branson who won the world these preachers telling people when you come to the Lord my you're on a picnic it's a gray no no picnic when you come to the Lord you're on a battleground but you're on the winning side you're no longer fighting against your brother your fattened with the backing of the Lord of glory share those battles share those things that come away that we have to overcome but God said these are opportunities that I will make my glory known through this can help you keep a lid on chronic stress it can also help you prevent minor sources of stress from lingering to a point where they're affecting your health well we've read through those md's I'm going to read from one right now doesn't have an MD not an oncologist not on whatever Allah Juicin and nurse none of that but I'm gonna read one who got sent in this day and the same one that we read about in Isaiah 40 who sits on the circle of the earth who measured out the mountains in his hand it came down and used this little Kentucky and this is back in 1964 this isn't 2020 if you worry's talking to a brother in a domestic situation if you worry it'll break your health down and that's what Satan wants to do now according this man he says I believe the message I love the message but my family's going a certain way notice the discernment here in questions and answers Satan is not trying so much to try to get him to go back on the wall but he's trying to worry him about his family why so that his health will be broke down pressure pressure Lord I'm praying for him but it seems like they're going to completely opposite way God I'm paying for him but it'll seem like their desires are to serve you whatsoever he's working I know and you so you just commit the whole thing to God and go right on serving God just as happy as you can be God will take care of the rest of it now I know I'm speaking to mortals and I know when we read a statement like this we're saying as we said Amen and we should say Amen to it but sometimes the committing it comes out to be a bigger job we make it out to be a bigger job than what it is committing is not where we say Lord I'm going to put this part in your hands I'll take care of the rest of it God said how shall you liken me well Lord I'll tell you what since you're God I'll give you 90% I'll keep the other 10% so he'll take the nine to do something about it and you take the ten and worry about it don't make sense so what should I do commit sometimes these things when we look at it it's more when I look at these statements here and experience it in my life it's a time where we even have to say lord help me to release it all I don't want to just say it and say yep that's what I need to do but lord help me help me to release it all into your hands I don't want to take it back home with me I don't want to pack this around with me I need your strength Lord that you will guide me help me to place it all into your hands why so you can live life how many believe this possible you read you coverage it's a couple more come you feeling pressured same brother ban looks at it look at that his history says how do you do he says you look like you're distressed you believe me as God's servant you believe that this Spirit of God is here now if I shall touch you you'll get well you're an awful deep thinker aren't you sister you've got a weary spirit too always worrying about things you haven't gotten no business to be you're nervous upset caused you to have acid in your blood which has give you arthritis I want you to catch this now please understand what I'm going to say sometimes things are just placed down here in a level so high tell you that devil the devil brought the pressure but you got a place to let it off well I'll tell you the devil gave me this and the devil gave me that sometimes the devil gets more blame than what he should I don't want to be found taking offered the devil but you understand what I'm saying he puts pressure why because he knows our bodies if he gets us under pressure we succumb our immune system things that are around us think about it if that gets broke down those things end up in our life guess what what we love and desire and enjoy doing more than anything serving the Lord praying and reading and being in the house of God and then all of a sudden these things are broke down and said goldeye I wanted to do this slaughter I wanted to be there you know what I wanted to do this God said hey just like I told Adam take care of this earth I've to entrusted you take care of this earth take care of it you're nervous it's caused you to have acid in your blood which is give your arthritis another one here comes a sister he says see one thing you're real nervous you're weak it's a stomach trouble you have I I see here's so weak you get so weak and I've seen you refusing things at the table like that things that you can't eat so now what calls this sister is a nervous condition it's a peptic ulcer in your stomach it causes pains and souring of the stomach and unrest and sometimes you think you have heart trouble of course it's not heart trouble quit worrying about that nervousness calls that acid in her stomach the bloating and the pressure up against her heart got her thinking oh my goodness oh my goodness I've got heart problems my friends I know I'm not only speaking to people they experienced this I know this my experience too well things can come your way you hear all these symptoms about Cova and water more yep still tasting whew coffee smells real good today right things and pressures listen to me now and now they're bringing this right down home when you have a situation sometimes in a church the enemy can take that situation and exploit it

down brother Carlos to where it's at why can't we just be like those Robins and say lord I need you this time there's sometimes worries or fears or anxieties he don't fret about it neither does he look down on you but he says come unto me he said cast your anxieties your cares upon me because I care for you he knew these things he knew the conditions he knew the situation's he knew the pressure he knew what would be here and he's Jehovah Jireh he's made away that we can live in this age under all the pressure brother Aaron everything that comes around not knowing what's it's going to look like next month what's it going to look like in the fall let's just gonna look like next year more play out the goodness they ain't gonna do this and now I tell you I can only take it anymore if their restaurants are just half way full Wow look at there there's more bolla I'm telling you what what could take place it may not sound like hallelujahs but you would hear I'm glad when we get in his presence because in the presence of the king there's fullness of joy we get in his presence so it's not like the hair compressor where you you almost gotta wear your protection but it's just like it the brand new is [Music] let's head you come in from the week and yeah man you make it the midweek service area whoo man I'm telling you what boy we've done everything in the world to get here and you sit down and you got every reason in the book why you could just stay home and you know just streamed I'm under so much pressure I need to prop my feet up God will understand honey can you bring me a glass of sweet tea while I watch brother Samuel I need refreshment pressure pressure will cause you to make decisions you normally wouldn't make if you sit down and think it through where it says forsake not to assemble yourselves together pressure but I'm glad there's a place aren't you brother Brian I'm glad there's a place where but a bit when we get in here all my the first song starts being sung by the drink after a period of time Shh sometimes I see people or they're all and then all of a sudden what's happening brother Joey were under his care in that the palm of his hand he measured out all the water brother Carlos sets upon this earth your problem my problem or it no doubt it's it's bright and big before us but if we can just look up to him through the stars they found the right position that same God has brother M says when we speak to that disease in our body and we say in the name of Jesus Christ cancer release he said the good cells arm themselves and go after the bad cells Wow we've got a place to release the pressure the spray anybody wanna be remembered in prayer god bless you remember me - would you Heavenly Father Lord Jesus your care is so great for us Lord what God you take a simple nosov fault but to me Lord every time you get a hold of it it's like the little lads launch it just my administers to our needs and Lord we all find ourselves daily we'd love to being able to say and we walk out of this place we walk out of here will never feel pressure again but what it is Lord there's a longing in our soul because there's been a pressure released of the guilt of sin the desire and the love of the world has taken flight there's a witness of that other land that's moved in that lets us know children there's a place I'm taking you to a place where you'll never have stress never be pressure you'll never have the tensions at what you've known but my grace is sufficient through the trials that I have allowed and will allow to come your way I will carry you through I'll bring you home to that place and as your prophet my prophet would say there's no way to describe it and you've just arrived this is what as hope would tell brother Branham it's perfect love Billy this is what you preach the Holy Ghost is oh god I'm a heart Lord and I know the hearts your children gathered here way long Lord to go Lord long to go home because we truly this world is not our home the earth itself must receive her cleansing then Lord in the Millennium we'll walk out on the ashes of the wicked then from there Lord it leads into the future home Lord Jesus were grateful [Music] got right here while we're walking in this journey you've not left us alone you're right there with us a father we all experience different pressure pressures and stresses if I try to relate more to the people certain pressures stresses that I would have or God perhaps the Lord they wouldn't be able to relate and vice versa there's certain stresses and pressures Lord just like little glimpses that I can see in with my wife I can pick those things up I can see it does it mean that I understand it no I don't understand it but I but I hear it I hear it Lord when we would sit down as a husband and wife and things Lord God as we would talk and express but I'm glad that we can pray for one another I'm glad there's a place that we can go and let off the pressure Lord I'm glad for it building you've given us that we can come where we can still meet and preach the revealed word of this Alan but Lord I pray if that's all the further that anyone has come may they realize there's a person here this morning that same Lord Jesus who was a rock in a weary land he's a shelter a covert a place a refuge a strong tower what God may they find refuge in you granite Lord this morning Lord for the husband for the wife for the father for the mother Lord God for these young people children that are even sitting here they experienced pressures every one of us

to the lives right now Lord God may as they would take the Lord God whatever that need whatever it is Lord betsa fauna may they Lord God just invite you right now and say Lord I want to take it and I want to cast my cares upon you Lord Lord Jesus as your prophet told us if it's something Lord God something Lord that's too big for you why in the world are we worrying about it but there's nothing too hard for the Lord nothing [Music] what I ask right now different ones dealing with diseases sicknesses dealing with afflictions in their body [Music] maybe Lord disturbances in their mind or their spirit Lord father I ask in the name of Jesus Christ Lord God as we unite together Lord to stand against Satan's army in his advances that would want to bring worry frustration disease Oh God granite Lord now in the name of Jesus Christ Satan we rebuke you you would want to take peace you would want to come and bring worry inject a little thought that then leads to something that just begins to
