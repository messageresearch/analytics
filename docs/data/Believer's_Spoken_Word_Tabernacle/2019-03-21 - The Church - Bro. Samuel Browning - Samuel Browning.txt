heard the song a long time ago and it means more to me today than never has before I hope it blesses your heart called the last mile some started walking said the heaven sure my home but they tired

[Music] thank you for that brother you meant we're almost there amen let's just sing that song again I know it was the blood his brother David comes I was actually reading a quote today or the other day last night whether Bram said when they pierced him in his side that blood came pouring out and then when the stripes on his back that blood came pouring out and then I began to think about the crown of thorns - that's why I did that that blood came pouring out and brother branham said that as it went down his legs it all became one blood as it hit the earth so when you receive salvation you receive healing you know the crown of thorns for your mind battles amen I just thought that'd be a blessing to you well I know it was the blood I know it was the blood I know it was the blood for me one day when I was lost he died upon the cross I know it was the blood for me one more time I know it was the blood I know it was the blood I know it was the blood for one day when I was lost he died

brother Paul's testimony we listened the brother Brian's testimony you know I was out in my yard just living everyday life Jessica told me that brother Brian had told the girl you've been talking to him she coming down about my testimony encourages you wouldn't hear that seriously it's something rose up in me I said it is for a purpose don't you ever thank you say for a purpose by the way I'm leaching I said it all the time my wife tells everybody said David was leading everybody Legion don't you he's bound by kinds of bowels of the devil's and he's sitting there they dope he's driving the hotel crazy because they don't want him to leave they people like people was crazy like yeah and he's sitting there and he's bound he could have been bailing 400 years him dealings to talk out of him demons to talk out of me one day and demons they was all in Legion and they looked down the road and they seen the dust they seen a man coming they go we seen it couldn't be what's he doing on this island forward and he comes walking up they get nervous they get funny they said are you care to torment us before our time he just walked up that's the way the devil's getting with us we make him nervous he tries to give us out of one thing and God gets the side of that we get into another thing we God gets us out of that he just can't fear us out in this world can't figure us out and sometimes I said when I come here and I look at my life and I can't figure myself out and I wonder how did I get where I'm at how did I get here I cursed you up last thing - I rejected you but you still at the end of it said you can run and blasphemy all you want but you're coming my way and you know something we fight to go his way when I'm driving his way I said well he's not going white when I was a young kid [Music] god bless your church thank God when it come down to it he had final say with me and I come to never thought I could be married he gave me a wife that I can't explain it he gave me a wife just like Moses as well praise the Lord let's sing this today Jesus on [Music] we're saying in Jesus I love you just worshipping because you can I never could imagine if he wasn't there and this passage Jesus I love you I wonder why you came I could imagine and he was our there when I heard the word Jesus I love you I found out you care I couldn't imagine my prophet said that you will be there oh this church saying Jesus I love you Oh me go I know this church game she couldn't imagine if he was are there let's sing the game Church Oh singing Jesus I'd even Paul said I could

[Applause] amen because you can could not imagine if you were there let's all stand Jesus I love you because you came I could not imagine if you were there Jesus I love you because you can I could not imagine if you were there Jesus I love you [Music] because you can I could not imagine if you were there Jesus I love [Music] because [Music] oh praise the name of the Lord Jesus where would we be without him we were lost and we needed to be found it's not within us to be able to find our own way but I'm glad that he came he knew where we were I knew exactly where we were at and he found us truly none of us can say I was seeking for God the real truth of it breaks upon our hearts is that any desire that we had or any seeking was because God himself had already made a choice and he was the one dealing with our life already if it's one ounce of it one ounce of it one speck of it one little grain if it's one little grain of it that's us then that would be ninety nine and nine-tenths glory to him and one-tenth glory to us but there's Noth nothing we can glory to think of it of how that he would call us bring us to himself but then would put it in these terms for us that we could understand it of how that he would deal with our heart and give us a spirit so that we can even get along with ourselves then he would come and put his spirit on the inside aren't you glad he's the one in charge he knows just exactly what he's doing he's done it time and time again he's changed life after life after life after life and he will continue until their final name until that final moment [Music] just good to be together it's again tonight let's just look to the Lord an award of Prayer tonight dear Jesus we are so thankful Lord for your mercy tonight your grace or that you have poured out upon our lives or Jesus we need you tonight I pray father that Lord as we have come your Lord to this place this building we don't want to stay at this address but Lord we would desire that you would move down Lord father is we would Lord yield help us to yield that we might be lifted Lord from this place because the way we look at it Lord we see problems we see things to need to be resolved solved answered but nor just looking at it here in this realm we find no answer but would you help us Lord to move out of this realm tonight help us to get into the spirit Lord to where we can begin to see things begin to receive Lord God to where that we can leave out of this building tonight that no matter what circumstance that we are faced with no matter the test no matter the trial Lord God even the condition of a soul that would be here tonight that doesn't know you may we leave out of here tonight Lord Oh God receiving from you Lord as we give ourselves to you tonight Lord will you just come from Lord the very front of the building to the back of the building God may the Holy Ghost Lord just have complete control Lord the glory of God may you take your word and speak to our hearts now Lord we pray minister to every me now Lord the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you thank you musicians if you'll turn with me to Daniel chapter 9 I just want to start there and then we'll move from there for the brian back there on the slides follow me from verse 25 down to verse 26 and then i'll come back to some notes that i put in between verse 25 and 26 okay so Daniel chapter 9 let's just start at verse 22 just saved just a little bit of time and he informed me and talked with me and said Oh Daniel I am now come forth to give these skill and understanding at the beginning of the supplications the commandment came forth and I'm come to show thee for thou art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision we could just stay on that scripture for a long time thou art greatly beloved think of this thou art greatly they love this is personally addressed and it lets Daniel know because thou art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consume to consider the vision in the tremendous how God will open and pour out of his love that our understanding does not work by demands or commands or law but the understanding of God breaks upon our life by the love of God in that wonderful 70 weeks are determined upon thy people speaking of the Jews and upon thy holy city Jerusalem to finish the transgression and to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy to anoint the most holy know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah Prince shall be seven weeks and watch how this lays in here shall be seven weeks , and threescore and two weeks it's taking two portions two measures of time that would be separated and is a conjunction that takes two separated portions of time underneath the seventy weeks and joins them together the street shall be built again and the wall even in trouble sometimes verse 26 and after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with a flood unto the end of the war desolations are determined amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as being seated we've been dealing with this and I know that sometimes the way that the Lord will lead us you might seem like we're off the path but I'm still dealing with the Red Sea right now but in this of the Red Sea there is much of that that speaks of a finishing work even in that there and if God helps us we look and continue to look at those types that lay in here for me I just want to follow him as he's leading us because it's wonderful to follow him it's wonderful the how how he opens the way and makes himself known to us I want to look at this here tonight just a little bit from Daniel 9 and the direction that I want to be able to draw from here is that which really pertains to us before we deal with this if however services that the Lord will lead us before we move move back over then to that of Israel but to look here and notice of how that God has made known to Daniel that 70 weeks in verse 20 for seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city so every the things that are spoken in here which is what would pertain to that of the Jews I wrote down a few notes I don't hope they'll make sense to you maybe as I would read through them but when we look at this here of the 70 weeks is there something between verse 25 and 26 in there if we look if we look within here 70 weeks itself for every every one of those weeks it is that of a seven years a day for that of a year and when we look at this here without spending a lot of time on it to find that how that the Prophet himself in this hour would be pressed you know to even go into that of Daniel 70 weeks and remember brother Branham as we read it last week in the fifth seal brother bream says I didn't even understand why I was going through that at the time he said that God knows that we would need it when we got here so you know to see times of how that God we can see even within this of how that God will open his word and when God will open his word it one thing that is certain about it we do not get and grasp everything nor everything that God would be maybe showing or displaying in that time or everything that God could but God will make sure that what it is that you and I need out of his word at that time when he's opening it that you and I get it because it's all about ministering to our needs it's it's not about accumulating knowledge or understanding it's about that we might be in sync with what God's desire is for this moment in this hour and myself I believe that any time that we are dealing with doctrine or we're dealing with mysteries if it stays out here and it never comes down to daily application we've missed it it's got to come down to where it becomes daily application because this is indeed his life that sealed that now is is open for you and I so when here the 70 weeks it would be that of 490 years that are pertaining to God dealing with the Jews and this is what he's making known to Daniel while that they are here in year 68 before they're coming out of Babylon now when we go on down to the next part that I read there you have that if we made mention in this scripture of verse 25 that there until as the scripture said that until to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks and we understand that there was a going back out of Babylon and returning back into the land and then there would be those of Israa and that nehemiah would come come forth and they would be given that of it be seven weeks which would be 49 years to where that here that the not only the temple would be raised up but then the city the walls the gates and all of those things you know to to think of that how that God would lay that out of even the years that how that that would lay in there so those seven weeks that then would be the forty-nine years then you have the next part of verse 25 and threescore in two weeks which is at was actually sixty-two weeks or 431 for years and then with what that leaves us with is one week and in that week remember this is where that in the midst of the week that here the Ministry of the Lord Jesus starts here at that of you know the age of thirty and three and a half years then here he is lifted up he's crucified so here three and a half years as the scripture says that the Messiah would be cut off but not for himself so then with three and a half years that God in the midst of the week the Messiah's cut off then what that leaves then is that next part which is three and a half years or days three and a half days of that last week which are years that are left to the Jews which is that of Revelations eleven three where it gives you the 1260 days which divided by 360 days equals three and a half years and that 360 days remember brother Branham deals with the three calendars that of the Julian that of the Roman and then he brings it down to the prophetic calendar and he says it all comes down and it must come back to that of the prophetic calendar so you can see how everything the timing is laid down precisely and everything is laid out exactly perfectly that the where we you and I stand the only thing is brother Brentwood saves in 64 in other places he said the only thing that I can see is that the Gentile church the bride is to be taken in rapture and those two witnesses ready to step on the scene because where God has Paul's been dealing with Israel when they themselves rejected the Messiah the daily sacrifice was taken away we know how the Titus and them came in and stormed the city and we know that the judgment that was poured out but before that judgment could ever be poured out there was already prophecy of Ezekiel 9 where there would be the sealing angel that would go through Jerusalem and it would seal all of the elect of God and there was not one elect of God that was caught inside of Jerusalem you know why they were ready they were ready and they were watching and so at a moment's notice there were things that were made known to them and they were prepared and they were ready when judgment had strike and and so when we look at this here with with this of of Israel we find that within this here that there would be that which you know God as we've been looking at that he would make mention of in different times that in very little places here and there throughout the Old Testament prophets in regards to that of of calling out of the Gentiles and taking a people there for its namesake but yet all of that was hidden this was not known this was all hidden and to think of how where I want to go in this moment here is now going into the midst here of that week of where that the Messiah's be cut off and then in the midst of that week remember now here you find that there is an opening now of seven Gentile Church ages where God Himself will call out and calling out a bride and taking unto him his bride that he chose from the foundation of the world and as soon as that last one comes in because we know that we're living in the finishing up of time this is as the scripture would said the finishing up of the mystery of God and so we're living in the time that just truly at any moment here that we we are going to be caught away the reality comes down to it even from the song of a Gentile days are numbered they they truly are numbered we see everything approaching and you know it is a very sad time because when you think of it it is a bad time out in the world right now it's a hideous time but you know that is only like a crumb compared to what it's going to be like when he get into the tribulation when you look at how things will be in the time of the tribulation and our key will be a small little word it will seem like a kitten term in the time of the tribulation it's a time that brother Branham would say Oh God he said cut me open film before a family full of sulfur he said but don't ever let me be here in the time of the tribulation but it's a time you know at the same time for us as the bride of Jesus Christ when you are recognized you know who you are you recognize what God has done in this day and it means more than life to you and you have been born of the Spirit of God then you know it's a rejoicing in our heart we have tests we have trials all of those things are moulding they're all purposeful but yet we have within our hearts a hope and expectation something that we're looking for and I don't care how many comes along nobody can ever take that Hope away from the bride of Jesus Christ so when we look at it here let's break in just a little bit in the book of Acts and let's look tonight at the Church of the Living God the Church of the Living God in acts 3 verse 12 that which comes forth in the midst of the week here now here in verse 12 notice Peter here he is this is after the man was healed at the gate called beautiful and when Peter saw it he answered unto the people and he said ye men of Israel notice who he's addressing ye men of Israel why Marvel here this or why look you so earnestly on us as though by our own power or holiness we made this man to walk the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob the god of Our Fathers hath glorified His Son Jesus whom you delivered up and denied him in the presence of Pilate when he was determined to let him go you know what Peter is announcing here he's announcing that the fulfillment of promises has arrived that it was not us that healed this man you know it marveled those people but Peter was letting him know this is the same God that called out Abraham the same God that met Moses it was that same God that came down and moved in in fulfillment of his word and glorified his son Jesus do you realize brother Adam tells us that on the day of Pentecost when they were filled with the Holy Ghost that Satan never got off his bed that morning he said that it was right here when they begin to see that same power in demonstration be live for the lives of the people he said that got satan's attention and got him upset you see this is why but that same life living inside of you and I it will produce a life of a believer another Christian and brother it is a blight full of the power of Almighty God amen now notice this he says but you denied the Holy One and the just one and desired a murderer to be granted unto you and killed the Prince of life whom God hath raised from the dead where we are witnesses and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong whom you see and know yea the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all and now brethren I wot that through ignorance ye did it as did also your rulers you see Peter he's aware of this this was through ignorance you did not realize you were crucifying the Prince of life but they had to be blinded is that right but those things notice which con I love this verse of scripture I'm out how to spell the other day but those things which God be for hath showed by the mouth of his prophets that Christ should suffer he hath so fulfilled to think of that God showed this by the mouth of the prophets these promises that already laid within it you realize that these prophets here and they had within them a chip off that diamond and there was a Victrola needle when there was music that was there that was contained within that word and there was a gift in their life the Bible says holy men of old were moved by the holy ghost hey man that same Holy Ghost it would move on that diamond chip in the light and there were promises that were sealed within here music that's to be broken in this hour there are people that are ordained to live out the symphony and the beats of the word he showed this he showed it by the mouth of his prophets you see every true prophet will refer back to the prophet you with me this is one of the qualifications it will never deviate you understand what I'm saying it never takes quotes and runs them quotes out on such a lie to where it runs and clear out of the scriptures that is an evil spirit that would lead it right away from the scriptures we do not dismiss Ajit's not an addition to the book this message is not outside of the book but this message comes to reveal those things that were sealed within their cover writing these seven thunders they reveal those things that are in there John writing not so then it must be that same God that will come forth in the same way now to think of it it would be that same mercy of God moving upon the ordained seeds of God how much you think of this Peter and them would have missed it they were walking around gloomy listen what Peter's saying right here before before he was filled with the Holy Ghost it was nothing but knowledge but now it's produced no power now it's produced no boldness knowledge did not let him know when stood he did not even know his position come on somebody Peter didn't just come on now this is just a chapter later you ain't going to tell me a chapter later all of a sudden Peter these things begin to be put together you say the Holy Ghost gotta put it together I agree but if you're gonna have a fire you've got to have wood there already and it takes a whole mighty cloth to take the wood the word that's being heard and being gathered that's why it's so important to be in the word and delivering that word it's a fellowship upon it to be in prayer why it's assembling word for the Holy Ghost to come down and bring it together and bring it in order and bring fire upon that that he will live and express itself in its power and grace in our lives there would be the God it would have missed it Peter and that one amidst the upper room and if they miss the upper room they miss the whole purpose of the message they miss the whole purpose of his first coming cuz his first coming was not an event it was an unfolding are you hearing me his first coming was not an event it was not the manger it was an unfolding to where when they themselves hear after the resurrection he himself comes as a faithful Shepherd which is according to the promise I will come and gather you up he gathers them up and takes them in the upper room all glory be to God you know that's what he's going to do to Israel when they get over there that 144,000 he himself to shepherd he's going to gather them together he's going to gather him to take him home then there would be the dog he's gathering them he'll gather him and prepare them oh girl and be to God to think of how that Peter in the moment in this time and the rest of the disciples if it was not for the mercy of God they would have missed what it was all about they would have had a knowledge of Calvary but that day of Calvary would have never been born in their lives amen Peter would have remained one filled with stories about being with him but never having that God who was there behind the sky inside of him though ramita God I tell you friends this message never came to point us to a man it never came to point us to a church this message itself it came to lift up already what God has declared this is my church very man there's one objective and that's to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ I'll tell you anything less so that's an evil spirit amen now notice this here here Peter goes on and that's three verse 19 now watch what he says here to the men here's the mercy of God you did this in ignorance now watch God's mercy now repent ye therefore and be converted so here right away and I'm not going to deal on this a lot tonight but this already they've already established there's a difference between repentance and being converted you can have repented but you're still not converted when you're converted you're changed you can no longer be the same you're a new creature in Christ Jesus all things are passed away but before you can ever be converted you must first repent why that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing that part pouring of the Holy Ghost when that times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord and he shall send Oh glory be to God he shall send Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you how many believe that how many believe he's coming back like you said he would yes sir amen we are expecting to receive the Lord Jesus Christ in a corporal body glory be to God we're being made ready for that physical return the same way that the two witnesses will move down by the power of the Holy Ghost and they will make a hundred forty four thousand ray for his coming and he shall send Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you watch how Peter goes here whom to heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things which God had spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began here is preacher Peter here he is he's preaching the second coming of the Lord you know how he's able to do that because he's experienced the coming of the Lord personally in his life that's how he's able to preach the second coming of the Lord this is the full purpose this is what the Church of the Living God loops for longs for is the coming of the Lord and you know what because you long for his coming he comes he comes and he'll come he comes in he'll come and he we'll come in a corporal body to receive us unto himself think about it why does he come you don't come unless you're welcome there must be something that has taken place to change that nature on the inside that must be lambs of God on this earth that welcome back the Lamb of God hey man it welcomes him to come down in services it welcomes him to come and show up when we're on the job it welcomes him to come into our homes why we are part of that personal coming of the Lord where the baptism of the Holy Ghost has moved down in our life and lets us know he's coming for me how you know he already planted the kiss on my heart that's how I know that's how I know and I'm looking for him ho glory be to God here David you know Paul breaks this he really in Peter when Peters preached preaching this here in verse 21 you realize that this breaks clear over into that of the setting up of the Davidic rule in the Millennium it breaks clear over this very scripture breaks clear over in the new heavens and new earth of how that God he's going to bring everything together and God is going to completely restore everything that even Nick day he's going to restore it and I just want to be there don't you and along the way I had just enjoying it for Moses truly said unto the father's a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren look how he's moving this back to the prophets this is what the Prophet said lack unto me him shall you hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you and it shall come to pass that every soul which will not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people yay and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days you see what the Holy Ghost does he which was which is and which is to come he's able to take those things that were promises and identified and say that which was now is it was the same God now moving through Peter and them that move there in the life of the Lord Jesus when they gave him the Scrolls that day and he said the Spirit of the Lord is upon me for he hath anointed me he found that place in the word he knew exactly what he was supposed to do he stopped within that and that ministry was made manifest now to think of this how did Peter within this moment and the time led by the unction of the Holy Ghost these were not men remember brother Graham said Peter couldn't recognize his name rode on a boxcar are you with me they spent it one that they were to learn men but it was the Holy Ghost inside of them glory that's our rest is the Holy Ghost it's in heal to know him he that is among us and he that is in us Peter said in verse 25 ye are the children of the prophets remember he's talking to ye men of Israel ye are the children of the prophets and of the Covenant which God made with our fathers saying unto Abraham and in that seed child the Kindred's of the earth be blessed unto you first God having raised up his son Jesus sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities remember over and over Paul would even talk in Romans 1 I believe verse 10 into 11 that the power of God is unto salvation unto the Jew first and Greeks also see even where the scripture comes in the beginning of Acts it said you shall be witnesses of me in Judea in Jerusalem you see Paul my mama you see here the promise was to be poured out in Jerusalem where the gospel itself where everything started brother it's coming back there I said it's coming back there it's gonna come right back to Jerusalem I believe with all my heart I believe them two witnesses are on earth how do you say thus saith the Lord on that but I'm just looking at how close we are how close we are you see all they're waiting is when that Gentile bride has taken up then that same Holy Spirit that same quickening power of God it moves from the bride and it moves there upon those two witnesses block and really preach on that one right now hmm you see they're gonna they're gonna need more than just knowledge of the scripture it ain't gonna be knowledge gonna turn them around come on somebody it ain't knowledge that turns you around it takes the power of God I don't care how much you know about healing it still takes more than your knowledge to bring healing it takes the power of Almighty God it takes God to manifest himself as Jehovah Rapha the Lord is my here it takes God comin on the scene to fulfill his word I want you to notice here in the scripture let me just let's work with this a few moments - not here home the church the Bible says in Genesis 41 45 that when failure notice now Joseph has received or he's attained a new name he's overcome you with me Amen there's an overcoming and this overcoming now it brings forth a revelation and notice I want you to I want to draw your attention to this that has his name he's given the name zaphenath-paneah and notice and he Pharaoh he gave him to wife essa not the daughter of Potiphar priest of on who could remove that title from her who can remove that title from her that's behind her name Joseph can Joseph can you see this title appears two more places in the scripture and you even look at and say well why does it steal brother well why is it still brought up in the Old Testament Rahab the harlot you know see sometimes when you think about that car that was stolen in that racketeering ring and it drove clear down the Bowling Green Kentucky and when run brother Adam the Spirit of God moved upon him said you'll find that car that's strolling down there and remember when you get down there of where it would have traveled to and so forth remember when they got that car he did not have a full tank of gas in it it only had a half a tank of gas but you know what that half a tank of gas was it was a reminder of what God had brought you from God will allow His grace to be made no to where in his mind he does not look at Rahab as the harlot but God would include that for you and I to remind you and I and let us see of the depths of the grace of God he can go deeper than you can ever imagine what changed a synapse why her union to Joseph it was not her choosing she was given to him so let's look at this a little bit he didn't earn he wasn't it wasn't something that he went out and chose she was gave to him you see even the choosing of a bride right now it is not Christ himself going forth and choosing or selecting on a bride he is choosing what he's already chosen remember when the anointing oil was poured out on David God had already chosen the anointing liable only for my mama the anointing oil only vindicated that David was God's choice been again on that one tonight but to think of this here but within it he's not going through the earth as we said selecting or choosing out a bride but rather he is drawing to himself those who have already been given to him to make up his body his bride his wife remember not one member or one age is the entire body but rather the ages put together John 6:37 let me just run through these scriptures here I hope you understand what I mean I don't mean just to run through them but I'll that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast down and this is the Father's will which has sent me that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day verse 44 no man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him you see it takes the power of God verse 65 in the same chapter therefore he's I say unto you no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father were given past tense amen so to see that this election of God you find of Howell that you know even here in the time where the Lord Jesus is preparing you know to go to Calvary you find in the scriptures in John 17 now I will read that tonight but you'll find in John 17 where the Lord Jesus himself would pray an intercession and he would just for our fellowship he would ask for that which those those which thou has given me that they themselves would behold my glory that they may be where I am ho glory be to God I tell you friends when we see this down through the scripture we're gonna just take the whole let the Holy Ghost take us you find that every time we're believers are even in that there of our Lord Jesus Christ when the word is made known within that hour it did not stop prayer but a matter of fact a prayer life turned out because when God begins to reveal it brings the believers in prayer because they are desiring for God to reveal those things which God hath revealed I don't want to just leave him in the heavenlies but I want to see it translated down to earth and those things that God has made known you see what good does it do to know all these things if it doesn't put something within you and I to give us a strength to give joy to give peace to give direction in our lives brother Sammy you don't know how much longer we got that's true I don't Harry that's contrary to the world he sent my peace I leave with you hey man I am come you know that you might have life and have it more abundantly listen tonight putting you down and letting you know your rights I'm letting you know as the son and daughter of God you've got a right to joy in your life if you say well I ain't done nothing wrong well listen the devil can sit there and try to twist all sorts of things he can try to get this and well this is wrong here he can get your eyes off of what you need to be looking at brother and sister if we can just look to him the scripture says looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith it's when we get our eyes off of him it's when we get in trouble but it's when we keep our eyes on him he stabilizes us it being doesn't mean that we don't got tests and trials we do have tests and trials but strengthens us he stabilizes us he gives us joy and peace in the midst of the story and you know you can take the attitude that you want you can say well you don't know what I'm going through maybe I don't know what you're going through and please understand I'm not making light of whatever it is you're going through I respect that but I want to let you know right here tonight that this is a time where there ought to be joy in the hearts of God's people joy is not going to break just on wraps or morning so what I would do I would evict that devil out of my mind right now you thief you robber get out of here that's what I would tell him because I've got rats as a son of God I know what the Lord Jesus did for me sorts of things around sons and daughters of God you've got the authority to enforce said by the Holy Ghost well God likes to flex his muscles a little bit and God likes it when his children and moved upon by him and they begin to flex their muscles of faith in his presence the Lord Jesus here in the midst of this time he comes to the disciples it's a familiar passage of Scripture for us and he says who do men say that I am it's not of Matthew 16 you most most of us would know this there's a lot of answers they know there's something different about his life there's something supernatural something spiritual but here as he turns and asks Peter and Peter said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God in verse 16 jesus answered and said unto Him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood have not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against him now think of these words here this is mentioned before the crucifixion these words are spoken do they understand them they don't they don't know what's being said here at this time but they're a part of something great that is taking place because you see even in the words that would be used I will build my church you would recognize that even build means to grow but then how that the Lord Jesus would use this term not Church now the word Church could not have been a foreign word to them because remember Stephen moved upon by the Holy Ghost he would refer to that same age of the Lord and say he was the one who was with them in the church in the wilderness so church itself was something that they would have an understanding of there according to all that they had been taught and they knew they knew that church itself was that of a group or gathering of people that were actually called out they were a group which that how that when Israel themselves were down in Egypt they could never be known as the Church of God but they were only known as the people of God at that time but once they came out of Egypt then they became known as the Church of God so in the church itself now think about it even that coming out of Egypt that it was something that God had assembled his church and got semble dis church by vindicating the promise that was made for deliverance and God would vindicate that promise through the offering of the blood it showed it was signs and wonders and how that God would deliver them with a mighty hand and once they would come out of there then they themselves would be known as as the Church of the Living God now you know I don't want to dwell on this a lot tonight but sometimes I think that in one thing that there has been some misunderstanding and the misunderstandings bairns that when the Spirit of God would move upon the Prophet and he would tell him so that you might understand and I'm gonna call you Church I'm gonna call you brah he was not overriding the scriptures that speak of the Church of the Living God but rather it is a certain word that lets the church know the season and the charity of time that we are living in and the bride herself who is the Church of the Living God she is alerted by the word now we'll leave that one alone tonight and we'll keep going so here you find that the Church of the Living God look here in acts 2:46 you know they never believe that the church was some place you could join you can come to this church and you're still not a part of the church right because the church is his body it is the mystical bath of Jesus Christ glory be to God it's not many churches there is one church one Lord one faith one baptism one Holy Ghost one God one church but I've never said he's coming back after churches he's coming back after the church that he claims as his own and this church you can't join it and they in the early church they never believed that they never believed that they never taught such stuff they never taught such stuff that you grow up in it you're automatically in it hello somebody verse 46 and they continually daily with one Accord in the temple breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart praising God and having favor with all the people and the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved who added the Lord had it give me Peter 1 preaching it was the vessel was Peter the vessel was Bartholomew the vessel might have been Andrew because after all that's his dress wear his dress where Bill Graham said he is dressed up in apostles prophets teachers evangelists well that don't make you outside of it remember that's in the body you're in the body that's part of you and you're part of it glory be to God God works inside of his body his body is his hidden program no repeater God hallelujah that's why however God started the church he must end it the same way any so-called church that is not ended in the same way is not his church and the Lord added to the church daily no how do you catch these words such as should be saved already ordained of God here God is going and rounding up his children who's doing this the Lord's doing it but we could work with this maybe God had somebody down at the sawmill maybe God had somebody here what was it it was the Lord who was working you say they might not have been a preacher hey listen preaching sometimes isn't all together by that of a gift but your life actually preaches a sermon it's a living witness of the Living God people don't want to know doctrines when you witness job they want to know who is that reality behind your skin sometimes I wonder if we've educated a bunch of people instead of them getting born-again they can quote quotes they can recite things they studied in everything else but the Lord must add acts 5 verse 12 and by the hands of the Apostles where many signs and wonders wrought among the people and they were all with one Accord in Solomon's porch in that funny where the Holy Ghost was moving among the people of God they were in one Accord you know what this phrase one Accord means you'll only find this not every phrase one Accord but in every one of the times I believe it's three or four times it's used there in the book of Acts you know what it means it's some Greek Greek word begins where the H ends with an end it's a it's a five billion dollar word but it all means is that it's notes that those notes then come together and they themselves put together bring forth a harmony go over to be the God you see God knows how to bring the notes together how in the world could these people so different from one another being one of call it because they weren't trying to join with one another's personality there had been the real personality come down they were in tune with God and rather they were caught up in his presence they knew who they were and that was their focus Wow here look at this and of the rest Durst's no man joined himself to them but the people magnified them nobody joined him it was to be added by God this is how the church was started this is how the church coming back to that no man can join it is the Lord Himself adding verse 14 and believers were the more added to the Lord multitudes both of men and women who was added believers you see you don't become a believer you always were a believer if you always were a believer then the power of God moves upon your life he causes you to believe he that cometh to God must first believe that he is right it's the power of God that raises up that causes one to believe unto salvation that so then to see that it is that the believers that then are added because remember the Holy Ghost brings the seal to show that he has received your faith they'll think how Paul would pick this up in Ephesians 5 what watch how this is unfolding I read T on acts 15 last week where Peter is watching in the house of Cornelius then the question comes up more than where they were brethren who were questioning Paul in them and remember Peter speaks James refers back to it there and says of how that God made choice and there that he would call out of people from the Gentiles for his name's sake and notice how that Paul here now Paul would have this mystery would be unfolded to him and how that this mystery would be open you know Peter and them never struggled with that remember Peter said at the end of Peter he said look Paul beloved brother Paul he says some things that are hard to understand which many who are unlearned wrestle to their own destruction see it shows one thing if you're learned you know when to say you know our Lord I don't understand that place you said it you'll bring it to pass and you give yourself to the Lord friends I'm preaching my experience here I trust I'm preaching the people by experienced nurse thing sometimes we're questions without questions we still have but you know what God makes it known in his time if God carries if God carries even another month you'll have more understanding you'll be more understanding that'll break in your life then there is this month if it tarries another year there's more why is it's the illumination of the Holy Spirit coming upon the word we couldn't handle it all at one time here this breaks Ephesians 5:25 let me try to get this husband's love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it so this mystery that's opening up of the church that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word so here he is going to Calvary with this mystery in him like Adam was on the seventh day he was going there with this mystery within him this mystery that laid there in the midst of that last week when the Messiah would be cut off the mystery that lay within him of taking that Gentile bride it lay there and he gave himself here's the mystery that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word we could never made ourselves presentable it's by him that we are made presentable won't it be to God it's not like our Western customs in the east the bride receives the material for her wedding garment from the bridegroom she receives that that's why this Bible it's not a Western book it's an Eastern book she takes the material that's given to her and she makes herself ready can you bear with me a moment she knows he don't want no low-cut wedding dress she knows he don't want no low no slits of this wedding dress come on somebody there's a pattern in this word she knows he don't want no high heels to where she's mincing he wants her to come in humility and he prefer glory he provides for her the same fine linen that he is attired he provides for her so that when she comes the mystery of her life is so sealed in his presence that there's not one room I expect for the devil to get in there she is all glorious within and without verse 27 look at this that he might present it to himself a glorious church Jesus don't have a problem with the word Church a glorious church because there's a lot of churches that he don't clean every Church he only claims his own y'all know what I'm talking about it's somebody come through our neighborhood when we first built our house back in oh three oh four they came through there and this guy came in with a hatchback now you two have been an idiot to know this guy's selling what's that what's a famous guy out of them that paints him like pictures in bookstores Thomas Kinkade he came up to my doorstep first of all what are you doing carrying Thomas to Kincaid pictures in your little hatchback and you come up to my door and telling me we've got a special on these things were selling them for $30 apiece I didn't call him a liar I just said you know what and I'm not interested you're not interested no I'm not interested at all you know why they were cheap reproductions they weren't the original drawing they weren't authenticated Oh glory be to God brother let me tell you something there's one thing that cannot be replicated it is authentic through and through and that's the seal of the Holy Ghost hey it shows through through Inlet should be no this is not a treat reproduction you can't buy this out with cigarettes you can buy this out with all sorts of things this is an original production that he might present it to himself a glorious church over the sand of the churches so this and so that and so this and so that wonder world are you looking at I know what are you looking at [Music] that people would actually be in that kind of afraid it's a glorious Church [Applause] not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish I mean let me just have a few more places here isaiah 52:13 right before i was a at 53 behold my servant is a speaking of the branch the lord jesus behold my servant shall deal prudently he shall be exalted and extolled and be very high and as many Worth's toning at thee his visage was so marred more than any man and his form more than the sons of men so shall he sprinkle many nations house he sprinkle house he sprinkle because you see on the day of atonement in that time of jubilee when the blood was offered up there was a priest that went riding out through the land and he blew a trumpet the trumpet the sound that went out identified the blood that had been offered in let him know you can go free and the effect of that blood reached the ears of the hair and they could throw down their hose and go back to their possessions he shall sprinkle many nations and the Kings shall shut their mouths of him for that which had not been told them shall they see and that which they had not heard they shall consider Titus chapter 2 verse 11 for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the Great God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works first Timothy 3:14 these things radda unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly but if I tarry long now may us know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God which is the Church of the Living God the pillar and ground of the truth do you realize what's being said here this is not about a physical building the house of God we call this the house of God we call that we meet here with the Living God but the order the house of God is where God lives you with me where God lives God lives in a house tell him somebody I'm gonna be to God when he came here on this earth hey here he found a body but think about it as far as any earthly house the Bible says that the son of man didn't even have a place to lay his head but brother he purchased unto himself the house of God then of the people of God that he himself he would dwell inside of us brother sister it's us dwelling in him and he is in us you shall know that I am in the father the father of me I am you and you in me God's chosen place of worship it is the house of God which is the church once again the Church of the Living God the pillar and ground of truth and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world received up into glory great is the mystery of godliness that mystery of God which is Christ in you the hope of glory great is the mystery of godliness can I have just a couple of minutes let's finish with the scripture in Ephesians 2 remember sons of God are born into the house of God servants don't abide there forever but sons that are born they abide in the house of God the Church of the Living God notice verse 11 wherefore remember that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision that which is called circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at the time you were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without God in the world but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ these types that laid in here what happened how are we brought in to the covenants there was a salmone that took us in salmone took Rahab after a battle was won Boh ass brought Ruth in after he suffered at the gate are you with me he paid the necessary transaction that was required because a gate in that day it was a place where two gathered to settle transactions he settled the transactions that was against your Ruth he brought it out the handwriting of Ordinances what would be to God that's why being in him and him in you the gates of hell can never prevail against you transactions that the devil would try to exact upon your life you are like a mighty arrow in the hand of a mighty man you turn the battle to the gate amen and say the transaction has already been made shake to take your hands amen go repeat a dog turning the battle to the gate bring it back where the transactions were settled are you with me tonight Harry was just sending up into glory there were some gates that needed to be opened these gates could only be opened when there had already been a victory and a conquering was led forth but you know there was a question and it went forth he said open up he everlasting gates it was those Old Testament Saints that were the elect of God that had been laid to rest in paradise they had been raised up at the resurrection of the Lord Jesus they entered in with him at the rapture and here they are moving up there to the gates and on the inside of the gates they said there must be a password and that password says who is this King of glory it says the Lord of Hosts below my day in battle necessary transaction had been fulfilled and the gates opened he's our peace he's our peace he broke down on the Bible says the middle wall partition that was between us he removed the chasm what you glad aren't you glad you could look across the chasm but he himself he himself became the breach he himself removed the castle and when that holy ghost has moved down upon our life it is the breach to that seed of God that ties that seed of God by the quickening power clears us ties us clear back to the mind of God you never did it in the first place Oh glory be to God notice how Paul would go on there you would say we are fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God right here as a church we're not the household of God but we are a part of the household of God there's one the household of God one the church were one of many outpost storehouses where our dried the room the Lord Jesus our Joseph he reveals himself he gives out grain I don't know about any of you I don't mind vegetable trees there all right sometimes I'm not really big on just be honest with you say where are you going with this well I appreciate stored up vegetables but we need having vegetable trays our Lord Jesus is preparing meals from what he's stored up are you with me not ministers he's preparing it but he has ministers to serve what he's prepared now we don't want that spirit to get on us well some of them had that idea I remember they had a dream and they seemed brother Neville serving food in the tabernacle oh brother Neville shouldn't be doing that see that same spirits around that same spirit is around it's not the Spirit of God it's an evil spirit but notice how the prophet of God under the leadership of the Holy Spirit he pointed out he's serving that same food that's being served it says same food we're not eating raw carrots we're not eating raw celery but our Lord Jesus who has prepared for us what we have need of he is supplying our every I'm glad about that and I'm not saying that because I don't like vegetable trace in the natural I'm just saying that he prepares a table he's got a table prepared the Church of the Living God mystery that he himself had hidden you know the reality of it is is that you know it's still a mystery to much of that to the world it's a mystery to that of church it's a mystery let me say to you don't let it stay a mystery to you if it's a mystery to you tonight don't let us stay a mystery just let your heart as its touched by God the scriptures that we read repent if you've never been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ don't be baptized and don't repent you repent first get your heart and I first let your heart be turned to God then walk into the waters of baptism believing that that promise that God has made he said that you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost I want you to think of this no matter the if we could say the goodest person could never earn it you can't earn a gift it's given it's given it's not something you merit it's the gift of God even to where God would prepare our hearts to receive him the real reality is it's not us receiving him it's him accepting us sometimes we've gone so customed to saying that brother Branham would tell us back into early 1959 he would bring it all the way up into future home and say you know what he said don't say I've received the Holy Ghost he said you say he accepted me what a difference it makes what a difference it makes this little bit of time that we're living and we're living in the closing moments of time he's finishing up his church and one of these days he's going to present to himself a glorious church without spot wrinkle blemish or any such thing he's gonna finish that up and then here you have the resume button for Israel the day breaks for jerusem and here we are at the wedding looking across the table I gotta look out here right now and I see many that I looked at when I was a little boy and see right now is battle-scarred soldiers but then that no matter what things took place sister Anna for the crash sister Elia different ones brother herb for the bill god bless you different lungs and then sister cress on and on mr. gomez oh my please don't get offended if I didn't call your name at each and every one you've been born at the Spirit of God friends I'll tell you right now even if it's just been a week you're still battle-scarred but you can look across and around just right here and see people where the Spirit of God has anchored when many times they let go but Hall how wonderful it is that the hold wasn't based on their hold it was his hold on their life something kept hold him day after day moment after moment something kept pressing them what is that it's the hope the hope of him coming home that day I hope I'd get to sit next to every one of you I don't know how that'll be possible but I hope that I'm able to sit there with you cellphone Samuel you fellowship with us but on that day [Applause] [Music] brethren let me tell you something when we look across the table and we see and that day see one another and say we made it it's grace it was sufficient we made it it was worth it all every test every smile it's been worth we look across and see one another oh my those that we have prayed together with we've joined shoulder to shoulder and fought battles and took mountains we took possession together we'll stand there on that day and say yes grace brother Brian it's amazing he gave us strength then he'll slip up come around and I don't understand it friends the Bible says heaven that he'll wipe away the tears from our eyes because the wedding supper is not a place of sorrow somehow he'll be able to remove from our remembrance all of the failures I know we'll be standing in our theophany I understand that but to think of how that he will wipe away all of those memories but yet the paradox is we'll have
