[5:06] wonderful prayer request uh wonderful
[5:08] testimony here from sister rosan she
[5:10] said uh here I'd like to share a
[5:12] testimony of God's incredible healing
[5:14] power last Thursday about 2 hours before
[5:17] church service I bent down and I pinched
[5:19] a nerve in my back the pain was
[5:21] excruciating and every move I made with
[5:23] my right hand arm leg or foot shent sent
[5:27] a sharp stabbing pain radiating from the
[5:29] center of my back despite the agony I
[5:32] attended Thursday night church serving
[5:34] uh church service praying fervently and
[5:36] trusting God to touch my body and bring
[5:38] healing yes sir although I experienced
[5:40] some relief during the service the pain
[5:41] persisted when I returned home for about
[5:44] two consecutive nights I was an absolute
[5:46] torment I was unable to sleep due to the
[5:47] pain would jol me awake it every just
[5:50] the slightest movement would jol me
[5:51] awake I had to work the next day but I
[5:54] was in so much pain that I could barely
[5:55] function relying solely on my left arm
[5:57] perform my duties as I cared for our
[5:59] resident she work in a nursing home
[6:00] right sister works in a nursing home I
[6:03] was desperate for Relief so I reached
[6:04] out to Sister Browning and asked her the
[6:05] number for a chiropractor she
[6:07] recommended Dr Brennan but unfortunately
[6:08] he was unavailable till Tuesday I
[6:11] couldn't wait that long because it the
[6:12] pain so I contracted another
[6:14] chiropractor joint chiropractor right on
[6:16] 58 and they too couldn't see me however
[6:18] they referred me to Dr Rick uh shiow and
[6:22] who saw me immediately after work he
[6:24] took x-rays diagnosed the pinch nerve
[6:26] and adjusted my back and neck he assured
[6:28] me that I should be feeling better the
[6:30] next day that same evening Sister Kim
[6:32] reached out to check on me unaware of my
[6:34] situation just to let me know that she
[6:36] loved me and that she was praying for me
[6:38] I decided to share my experience what
[6:40] was going on with her and she expressed
[6:42] her sympathy promising that she would
[6:43] pray for me the next day I returned to
[6:46] work but unfortunately there was no
[6:48] improvement uh in fact the pain seemed
[6:50] worse however I decided to push through
[6:53] I used both my hands despite the agony
[6:55] and pain Sister Kim checked in with me
[6:58] again that Saturday night and I updated
[7:00] her on my condition she reassured me
[7:02] that she'd been praying for me all day
[7:04] and we continued to do so that same
[7:06] Saturday night something happened as I
[7:09] turned in bed I realized the
[7:11] excruciating pain was gone I took deep
[7:14] breaths because before even deep breaths
[7:17] were causing immense pain so she takes a
[7:19] deep breath and while taking these deep
[7:21] breaths the pain just wasn't there
[7:23] discomfort but no pain I just knew that
[7:26] God had touched me praise God and I
[7:28] immediately thought of Sister Kim who
[7:30] had been praying for me and was the only
[7:31] one who knew about what had happened to
[7:33] me from my work I knew she prayed with
[7:35] me uh prayed for me with compassion and
[7:38] sympathy I could tell I recalled her own
[7:39] experiences with the kidney stones not
[7:41] too long ago and the immense pain that
[7:43] she had had to endure I believe that her
[7:45] prayers born out of her own
[7:47] understanding of suffering were the most
[7:49] powerful intercession I could have
[7:51] received and I wondered if God would had
[7:53] allowed Sister Kim to go through those
[7:55] trials so she could pray for me in my
[7:56] time of need maybe her experience was
[7:59] not just for her but for me as well so
[8:01] that I could receive my healing and
[8:03] victory I want to express my heartfelt
[8:05] gratitude to Sister Kim for her prayers
[8:06] of compassion I pray that God reward her
[8:09] with a life free from kidney stones from
[8:11] here on out and I thank her for being a
[8:13] vessel of God's healing power to know to
[8:16] flow freely into my life thank you

[42:34] amen if you'll turn with me let's go to
[42:36] 1 Corinthians chapter
[42:39] 12 and
[42:42] uh certainly ask you Lord Lord willing
[42:46] just to if you would keep us in prayer
[42:48] the meetings there with brother stepen
[42:51] um brother Isaac Hatfield will be here
[42:54] Lord willing on Sunday to minister
[42:58] amen for us and um Lord willing will
[43:01] will be ministering there with brother
[43:03] Steven's dedication meetings on Sunday
[43:06] morning
[43:08] so uh that is unless I can get be here
[43:12] and just tell him to stream it
[43:15] there so but we appreciate brother
[43:19] Stephen and it's just a he's such been
[43:21] such a blessing to us and I I feel we
[43:24] got cheated in February when he was here
[43:27] and uh not able to to speak uh but we
[43:32] are God knows all things and so we want
[43:34] to just continue to keep them in prayer
[43:37] amen I want to read here without any
[43:39] further delay beginning in verse one and
[43:42] Paul said now concerning spiritual gifts
[43:45] Brethren I would not have you ignorant
[43:48] you know that you were Gentiles carried
[43:51] away unto these dumb Idols even as you
[43:54] were LED wherefore I give you to
[43:57] understand that no man speaking by the
[44:00] spirit of God calleth Jesus a cursed and
[44:03] that no man can say that Jesus is the
[44:06] Lord but by the Holy
[44:09] Ghost now there are diversities of gifts
[44:13] but the same spirit and there are
[44:16] differences of administrations but the
[44:19] same lord and there are diversities of
[44:22] operations but it is the same God which
[44:25] worketh all in all but the manifestation
[44:28] of the spirit is given to every man to
[44:31] profit with all or to profit all amen
[44:36] may God bless you and bless the reading
[44:38] of the word as you're being
[44:39] seated I'd just like to take just a a
[44:42] thought here
[44:44] tonight and that is the other spiritual
[44:48] gifts and um I'm
[44:52] not I tonight I'm just going to take one
[44:55] of them and I just just really have so
[44:59] enjoyed the study upon the different
[45:02] gifts coming down through here and uh I
[45:05] think that would be probably tonight
[45:07] would serve us well to be able to get
[45:09] through one gift with some of the things
[45:11] I want to lay in here in the beginning
[45:14] and uh I certainly have been enjoying
[45:16] the things that the Lord has been uh
[45:18] speaking to our hearts you know the one
[45:20] thing about it when the word comes it
[45:22] just it comes to bring further Clarity
[45:25] and Direction amen man to our lives and
[45:28] to our hearts and so we when we look at
[45:32] this because so often and so much of the
[45:34] time is you know we spent about three
[45:37] services and I'm not altogether finished
[45:39] I want to deal with another part of that
[45:42] when we've been looking uh with the
[45:44] gifts and just and just looking at some
[45:46] things within maturity but I want to
[45:49] cover this first because uh many of the
[45:52] times we like I said when we think of
[45:54] gifts and a lot of times when I think is
[45:57] stated when individuals will bring up
[46:00] certain quotes and things of the prophet
[46:02] and say well you know the the nine
[46:04] spiritual gifts ought to be in the
[46:06] church but I think many times what is in
[46:08] is in a person's mind is that of tongues
[46:11] and that of Prophecy and the reason that
[46:14] would be even very natural and very
[46:16] common because Paul when he dealt with
[46:18] the Corinthian Church how many
[46:21] scriptures and how much did he deal with
[46:23] tongues and prophecy and like such of
[46:26] these other GI gift we're going to deal
[46:27] with there's a portion of a
[46:29] scripture that is given to
[46:32] it but yet these gifts themselves are
[46:36] the best
[46:38] gifts and they're actually where we'll
[46:40] begin tonight is with that of of what is
[46:43] the prophet calls the best gift that
[46:46] gift which is is the best out of it all
[46:48] and is absolutely the necessity out of
[46:51] it all but I want to just draw back to
[46:54] our our scripture here tonight think
[46:56] things that we I know when we go through
[46:59] this and we read through it and when we
[47:02] look at this that we read here in our
[47:03] text to know that there are diversities
[47:07] of gifts of how that gifts themselves
[47:12] that would be such a variety you can
[47:15] think about whether you even to think of
[47:17] just kitchen tools you can think of even
[47:20] as I had those office tools stapler tape
[47:23] and all those things like that they're
[47:25] they're so diverse what each one is
[47:28] needed for And So within all of it
[47:32] everything even within the gifts that
[47:34] God has set within the body they are so
[47:39] diverse in other words God if he wanted
[47:42] it all if all that he needed would have
[47:44] been tongues then that's all he would
[47:46] have given but God seemed fit to it to
[47:49] give you and I nine spiritual gifts now
[47:53] the prophet says it in this way he says
[47:55] you know God he said he gave us his word
[48:00] and he said now if it was me if I gave
[48:02] you my word and you didn't believe it he
[48:04] said well that would be it he said but
[48:06] that's not God God gave us five
[48:09] ministerial offices those are
[48:11] predestinated gifts that come from God
[48:14] from his forn knowledge of God and God
[48:16] gave that to go into the word to begin
[48:19] to you know break into a channel for
[48:21] what purpose to build our faith to see
[48:25] whatever we have need of it's already
[48:28] finished and then the prophet would say
[48:30] it like this again he said and then if
[48:32] we still can't get it that way he said
[48:34] God has set nine spiritual gifts in the
[48:37] church because he's interested in us
[48:41] getting it now I'll say it in this way
[48:44] brother Bram takes it up in the message
[48:45] Oneness also in marriage of the lamb and
[48:48] he speaks of how that you know when a h
[48:52] a young lady would be uh here she is
[48:55] courting and then you know here she
[48:57] would receive uh an engagement ring and
[49:01] brother Bram types that engagement ring
[49:04] that she would receive as that of the
[49:06] gifts that is given to the church and
[49:10] the reality of it is is that God let me
[49:14] just say it in this way you and I by the
[49:17] grace of God not by any goodness of our
[49:20] own or any of our own merits but it was
[49:23] predestinated by God as the prophet said
[49:27] when he speaks there in the church age
[49:29] book and he says this this special
[49:32] Revelation is built for a special class
[49:35] of people and let me just say it that
[49:37] takes that takes all all of our
[49:41] credibility away if I can say that it
[49:43] puts it all on the grace of God we're
[49:45] living in the time and the hour we're in
[49:47] and God has seen to it that you and I
[49:50] would be able to walk with a real truess
[49:53] and ass aury of our heart and that we as
[49:56] his bride we receive like that of that
[49:59] engagement ring we receive every gift
[50:03] that God has for us I'll just say it to
[50:05] you like this there might be a lot of
[50:07] things that you know where Satan is
[50:10] always trying to get in and trying to
[50:12] bring scarecrows and everything but let
[50:14] me just tell you no matter what has
[50:17] taken place no matter what false or no
[50:19] matter what this God gave the word and
[50:22] if God gave the word then he's big
[50:25] enough to watch over it
[50:27] and so we don't have to go into fear and
[50:29] lock things up and close it off but if
[50:32] we just if we just you know in a manner
[50:35] of just being in prayer and just and
[50:37] just let God let the word itself so
[50:40] place things and place our lives then
[50:42] you know what God will do what God sees
[50:44] fit to be done and one thing that's
[50:47] different about our lives and our hearts
[50:50] how we thank God for the gifts we thank
[50:53] God for everything and all that he does
[50:55] and I've said this to you as as your
[50:57] pastor to me I believe in all that God
[51:00] has for us there's not one thing going
[51:03] to be taken from me it's not going to be
[51:05] taken as long as I'm the pastor it's not
[51:06] going to be taken from this church I
[51:08] believe in prayer lines I believe in
[51:10] speaking in tongues I believe in
[51:12] Prophecy I believe in everything that
[51:14] God has given I believe in shouting I
[51:16] believe in everything I believe in
[51:18] Liberty in the house of God is that
[51:21] right we we believe in that because the
[51:24] word of God has come into a place and to
[51:26] bring a liberty in our hearts but
[51:29] there's one thing about it that we see
[51:31] the value of is that we could have like
[51:34] Paul says I can have all of these gifts
[51:37] and not just tongues and prophecy but I
[51:39] can have the gift of knowledge I could
[51:41] have the gift of wisdom I could have all
[51:43] these gifts but if I miss the most
[51:45] important thing Divine love which is the
[51:48] Holy Ghost I've missed it all and so to
[51:53] understand that part of it that we
[51:55] understand that not one of these gifts
[51:57] is an Evidence of a life being filled
[52:01] with the spirit of God but the prophet
[52:04] said it in this way he says I will say
[52:06] that the manifestation of the spirit
[52:09] that it is an evidence that the spirit
[52:11] is there manifesting through a vessel
[52:15] but we know what the true evidence is
[52:17] the Bible said when the spirit of Truth
[52:19] is come he'll lead and guide us into all
[52:22] truth it's when the spirit of God has
[52:25] brought an absolute New Creation on the
[52:28] inside and the amen is from your soul
[52:32] yes it that's the real evidence of the
[52:34] Holy Ghost that has never changed
[52:37] through the word and that evidence is to
[52:40] be able to receive the word and you say
[52:42] how do I know I'm receiving it because
[52:45] it lives out through your life
[52:47] Hallelujah there's nothing within that
[52:50] would disagree with the word of God
[52:52] that's the real true evidence aive
[52:55] because remember the word word itself is
[52:57] not is not altogether the Bible but the
[53:00] word is the person of Jesus Christ it is
[53:04] the Holy Ghost and that's why when we
[53:06] look at in the Scripture it says that
[53:08] there are three that agree in one the
[53:11] water and the blood and the spirit they
[53:13] agree in one we can be justified without
[53:16] being Sanctified we can be Sanctified
[53:19] without being filled with the Holy Ghost
[53:21] but you but but we can't be filled with
[53:24] the Holy Ghost and not have the others
[53:26] that are before that this is why John
[53:29] would say that there are three uh that
[53:32] that that these three are one the Father
[53:35] the word and the spirit so this is why
[53:39] that a person can never ever claim to be
[53:42] spirit filled they they can but we if
[53:44] they're spirit filled and yet resist and
[53:47] reject the word that's an Evidence
[53:50] coming out that's saying something
[53:52] different and this is why over and over
[53:55] through the message of the hour which
[53:57] it's all scripture that once that of the
[54:00] holy spirit is come that that soul will
[54:04] punctuate every word with amen because
[54:08] we're living in the hour of the amen so
[54:12] then when we recognize this the great
[54:15] difference even within our lives is that
[54:18] even when God would send eler and he
[54:21] would go under the direction of Abraham
[54:24] to get a bride and when he went to go
[54:27] and get a bride he he followed the
[54:30] wisdom and the and the leadership that
[54:32] Abraham gave and he prayed according to
[54:35] how Abraham told him of what he was to
[54:38] do and here comes Rebecca and when
[54:41] Rebecca came on the scene remember they
[54:43] begin to speak and they begin to talk
[54:46] and and then finally she declares who
[54:49] she is and when she declares who she is
[54:52] this is where elaser begins to worship
[54:55] oh that God has been merciful to my
[54:58] master how that God is so directed
[55:01] eleazer into that place that it wasn't
[55:04] something that he had to go through a
[55:05] phone book he didn't have to you know
[55:07] hit Instagram he didn't have to do you
[55:10] know a survey on Facebook he didn't H he
[55:13] he didn't have to do that he just had to
[55:15] be led by the Holy Ghost and when he
[55:19] came there remember he they you know he
[55:22] made known to to them to her parents and
[55:25] so forth and Brethren that you know uh
[55:28] you know the damsel uh I you know please
[55:31] let me have leave and and bring her with
[55:33] me uh to my master uh you know his son
[55:36] Isaac and and you know and how that when
[55:39] when they said well no just just wait 10
[55:42] days but he said no we we we don't have
[55:45] time to wait until the tribulation she's
[55:47] got to be ready to go
[55:49] now and so when when the call was given
[55:53] remember they said well let's just call
[55:55] her she's of age and so when now she
[55:59] comes and she says they asked her
[56:02] Rebecca what's your decision and she
[56:04] said I will go you know that that's the
[56:07] simplest thing decision is so
[56:10] powerful sometimes we we can we can uh
[56:13] allow things to be made so complicated
[56:15] you know all it takes for the word to
[56:17] start working in your life is to make a
[56:20] decision and to agree with the
[56:23] word and the word has a way of dis
[56:26] manling holds and fears and doubts and
[56:29] and all of that and and you know the
[56:31] thing of it is is that here she came and
[56:34] you know she got up on the camels and
[56:35] you know that she had watered and so
[56:37] forth but my point is is that eleazer
[56:40] gave gifts unto her Brethren and them
[56:42] and they were content with that but
[56:44] Rebecca knew that where those gifts come
[56:46] from there is one who is waiting for me
[56:50] there is one that has sent these gifts
[56:52] my way and that's the thing that is in
[56:55] tune with the bride of Jesus Christ that
[56:57] all of these gifts it ought to be one
[57:00] thing that I should see I should see him
[57:03] very clearly it's him that I want to see
[57:06] when everything is all said and done if
[57:08] God carries and and we and we are not
[57:12] privileged to be a part of that glorious
[57:14] morning that I believe is on us at any
[57:17] moment to think of it that whether it's
[57:19] at our last passing a breath but to
[57:21] think that what the glory is is not of
[57:25] any gift that's wor through our life or
[57:27] anything in that way but to know that
[57:29] standing there that as we have to come
[57:32] through that door I know him in the
[57:35] power of his
[57:37] resurrection that's the real Victory is
[57:39] to know
[57:42] him amen so then with these diversities
[57:46] of gifts you know there's so many uh of
[57:48] the of these gifts as we look at them
[57:51] and they're and they're always so
[57:52] diverse and that to think of it as the
[57:55] gifts are diverse even we as God's
[57:58] people are so diverse there's such a
[58:01] variety and God chose and ordained it
[58:04] that way even as Paul would call it
[58:07] where the spirit of God would be in
[58:09] tabernacling in a people of God he would
[58:11] call it the manifold wisdom of almighty
[58:15] God how that God is displayed in such a
[58:18] variety and you know we might think well
[58:21] this this brother's odd or this sister's
[58:23] odd but who knows they might think
[58:24] you're odd but let me just tell you like
[58:26] the prophet said regarding Solomon's
[58:28] Stone he said there was a temple he said
[58:31] there was a place in Solomon's Temple
[58:34] for every odd acting Stone there you
[58:38] go so if you think you're a little bit
[58:41] odd and the devil wants to try know you
[58:43] there's a place for you in the economy
[58:46] of God and you know we don't we didn't
[58:49] have to we don't have to push our way
[58:50] and fight our way the Bible said every
[58:53] man's gift maketh room for himself now I
[58:56] believe not only that scripture I don't
[58:57] only preach that scripture when it comes
[58:59] to the ministerial offices I believe
[59:01] that real gift on the inside is that
[59:03] Soul the prophet taught us about he said
[59:05] it's that soul and things that are to be
[59:07] that the spirit of God there's something
[59:09] there that the spirit of God is able to
[59:11] Quicken and agree with the word of God
[59:14] that's the real gift of God I'll tell
[59:15] you aren't you thankful the real gift
[59:17] makees room for itself we just let God
[59:20] have his way then God will make himself
[59:23] known am so there's differences also
[59:26] of administration you know different
[59:28] orders among the body of Believers and
[59:31] God has that setup you know God made it
[59:34] very clear to us you know that how he
[59:37] has set up even within the five
[59:39] ministerial offices sometimes we refer
[59:41] to it as fful Ministry and uh you know
[59:44] that's a term brother bam will use
[59:46] scoffield will use in the notes and and
[59:48] and recognizing that differences of
[59:51] administration we see that very clearly
[59:53] you know that's a very key point of the
[59:56] differences of administration because
[59:58] you know the thing of it is the prophet
[1:00:00] said when God sends the light of the
[1:00:03] hour he sends it through that messenger
[1:00:06] and then from that messenger come men
[1:00:09] that are Faithfully taught to carry that
[1:00:13] message on now I don't believe that
[1:00:15] Faithfully taught is sitting down at a
[1:00:17] chalkboard or a computer but I believe
[1:00:19] it's the spirit of God the same unction
[1:00:22] of the Holy Spirit I believe it's
[1:00:23] getting in the same vein and the same
[1:00:26] that's a privilege that you and I have
[1:00:28] not just as the ministry but as that
[1:00:31] word is being preached you and I are
[1:00:33] being brought in the channel of God's
[1:00:36] Own thoughts so then our own lives the
[1:00:40] way our lives are conducted are actually
[1:00:43] God's thoughts concerning his word being
[1:00:47] reflected and manifested in our life
[1:00:49] there's a difference of administration
[1:00:51] in recognizing God has that profit for
[1:00:54] the age and then the rest of the
[1:00:56] ministry in this age that we're in God
[1:00:59] sent the prophet of Malachi 4 to anoint
[1:01:03] Ephesians 4 and this is why that every
[1:01:06] true Ministry look God has not put the
[1:01:08] ministry is not on the same plane the
[1:01:11] ministry has come under Ephesians 4
[1:01:13] comes under Malachi 4 because when Aaron
[1:01:17] and the priest were to come and worship
[1:01:20] remember they had to come before Moses
[1:01:23] and Moses had to wash them right and he
[1:01:26] had to clothe them with the wisdom that
[1:01:30] God had given is that right so now what
[1:01:34] would be coming forth and that washing
[1:01:36] is the washing of Water by the word it's
[1:01:40] washing away our ideas washing away our
[1:01:42] thinking but you know what how beautiful
[1:01:45] it is when we're right in our position
[1:01:47] you know what I'm so thankful to me when
[1:01:49] I look at that I I don't want that
[1:01:52] position I'm just grateful to be under
[1:01:55] the ministry that God has given us just
[1:01:57] like every other age what a place of
[1:01:59] safety it is to abide Under The Canopy
[1:02:02] of God's word and you know what I mean
[1:02:04] by that you don't have to try to figure
[1:02:06] nothing out no it's just like this I I'm
[1:02:10] just going to say this when brother bam
[1:02:12] you know sometimes you know individuals
[1:02:13] can get this and they take it way off
[1:02:15] you know uh and brother R says you know
[1:02:17] take the things you're hearing and take
[1:02:19] it back to the scripture now he's not
[1:02:21] telling us you know be careful because I
[1:02:23] might be a deceiver there might be some
[1:02:25] things that's what he's speaking to us
[1:02:27] about is because this is a scriptural
[1:02:30] Prophet that is announcing to you and I
[1:02:33] to get into the same channel of thought
[1:02:37] because God what is a prophet that is a
[1:02:41] chip off of the diamond that gets made
[1:02:44] into a vrola needle that gets put on a
[1:02:47] record to release what's been canned in
[1:02:50] that record and God sends a prophet down
[1:02:53] then it's not the prophet in him s it is
[1:02:57] God's gift and God through that releases
[1:03:01] his thoughts that's been sealed in the
[1:03:05] word differences of administration and
[1:03:08] those are things that for us by God's
[1:03:10] grace that God gives us the the the
[1:03:13] ability to be able to recognize those
[1:03:15] different Administration those
[1:03:17] boundaries that God would set there you
[1:03:20] know within within a protection there's
[1:03:22] differences of operations and Paul would
[1:03:25] write this that let every man prophesy
[1:03:27] according to the proportion of faith
[1:03:30] that he's given God's given to everyone
[1:03:33] a measure is that right and so to
[1:03:35] recognize that you know God's the one
[1:03:37] that he's the one that that that
[1:03:39] determines even the extent of that gift
[1:03:42] being operated and let me just say it to
[1:03:45] you like this God can have a Ministry
[1:03:48] and that Ministry itself might be one
[1:03:50] that might be used once every so many
[1:03:52] years then God will have you know a gift
[1:03:54] that maybe you know may maybe it's a
[1:03:57] pastor and God might utilize that gift
[1:03:59] to minister in other places but God may
[1:04:02] not do that to to each and every one
[1:04:04] does that make anyone above one another
[1:04:06] not at all it's God that set these
[1:04:08] differences of of operation so it's not
[1:04:11] man that determines this now I will say
[1:04:13] this to you that you know sometimes uh
[1:04:16] humanness and and so forth can get in
[1:04:18] there and that's why Paul said let don't
[1:04:21] be striving for vain Glory you know in
[1:04:23] other words pushing and trying to you
[1:04:25] know VI like that like electioneering
[1:04:28] for a position that's where it comes
[1:04:30] back every man's gift will make room for
[1:04:32] itself and you know what here is the
[1:04:34] beauty of it is what God is whatever God
[1:04:37] has called you and I to do if we'll
[1:04:39] operate within that there is a peace
[1:04:42] there is a rest there is safety there is
[1:04:45] protection because what it is it's
[1:04:47] abiding within God's will for our lives
[1:04:51] and then we find this of the the
[1:04:54] manifestation of the spirit and and you
[1:04:56] know it's all the everything that Paul
[1:04:59] would write about it's all for the
[1:05:01] edification of the body it's not to
[1:05:03] satisfy uh somebody's uh you know
[1:05:06] feeling of spirituality no the
[1:05:08] manifestation of the spirit is given for
[1:05:11] the profit of all or that the body
[1:05:13] itself would be profited and so God you
[1:05:17] know this is the thing that God will do
[1:05:20] uh because the five ministerial gifts
[1:05:22] those are for ordained by God man comes
[1:05:25] here here well if he's a pastor he came
[1:05:28] here with that gift in him if he's a
[1:05:30] Prophet come here with that gift in him
[1:05:31] any part of of the ministry but the nine
[1:05:34] spiritual gifts are in the body and the
[1:05:37] prophet said it can be on this one
[1:05:38] tonight and never again and then you'll
[1:05:42] hear Brother Brown say in the message
[1:05:43] you'll hear him I've read to you some
[1:05:45] quotes where he's talking about how God
[1:05:47] was using Brother Neville and then he'll
[1:05:48] talk about brother Hig and Bam and then
[1:05:50] he'll talk about Junior Jackson and and
[1:05:52] he'll speak of them and you know how
[1:05:54] they have you know this this gift of
[1:05:56] speaking in tongues and so forth but you
[1:05:58] know what it comes down to is is no
[1:06:00] matter what it is whether it's one of
[1:06:01] the nine spiritual gifts or five
[1:06:03] ministerial you know God will will will
[1:06:06] entrust you and I with something and
[1:06:08] then he'll stand back and watch our
[1:06:10] conduct with
[1:06:11] it he wants to see how that we'll handle
[1:06:15] it because this is the very thing now
[1:06:18] this is exactly what brother bamy goes
[1:06:20] into bringing that out God will watch
[1:06:22] that conduct because everything must be
[1:06:25] kept to where that he's glorified amen
[1:06:29] and so God oh I'm glad he watches over
[1:06:31] that aren't you I'll just tell you right
[1:06:33] right up front if there God seen
[1:06:35] something within me that was not
[1:06:37] glorifying him I'd say Lord take me take
[1:06:40] me down take me down correct me take me
[1:06:43] down lord I don't want anything that
[1:06:45] takes away from you because you know why
[1:06:47] when you and I leave out of this
[1:06:49] building from these times that we gather
[1:06:51] you've got to face real issues in life
[1:06:54] right you've got questions that are
[1:06:56] before you've got needs with family and
[1:06:58] whatever more we need to see the Lord
[1:07:01] Jesus we need to hear from him we we we
[1:07:05] don't have time friends for
[1:07:06] personalities we only have time for one
[1:07:09] and that's God I I I think I pray God
[1:07:12] let that be the fading out in this hour
[1:07:15] from every personality and let us only
[1:07:17] see Jesus so when we look at this of how
[1:07:21] that a diamond itself the prophet says
[1:07:23] you know God's like a great big diamond
[1:07:26] and that diamond has been chipped or
[1:07:28] it's cut in such a way a true cut
[1:07:30] diamond reflects many rays of light and
[1:07:33] when we see in the church so many
[1:07:35] different gifts of the Spirit it's only
[1:07:37] the Reflection off of the real diamond
[1:07:39] and one may seem a little peculiar to
[1:07:41] the other but it's the way the diamond
[1:07:43] reflects the light so God does that also
[1:07:47] in the way he reflects a gift in the
[1:07:49] Bible one as a gift of knowledge one as
[1:07:52] a gift of tongues another as a gift of
[1:07:54] something else but it's God reflecting
[1:07:57] these lights and they are lights that's
[1:07:59] gathered in one person and that's
[1:08:02] almighty God now brother B goes on and
[1:08:05] talking about this in many places about
[1:08:07] the diamond and he's just he's showing
[1:08:09] us how that you know that it it reflects
[1:08:12] it's just it's the same coming from the
[1:08:14] same source as as I just read it's God
[1:08:17] reflecting through these lights but
[1:08:19] brother Bram would speak to us there in
[1:08:21] the message gifts and he says concerning
[1:08:24] he said even among the Pentecost OST he
[1:08:25] said these is where this is where
[1:08:27] individuals have got the gifts mixed up
[1:08:30] because they have put an emphasis on
[1:08:33] certain gifts and said if you do this
[1:08:36] then you got it if you do this then you
[1:08:39] got it and they've put that that they
[1:08:42] put those emphasis up on those things
[1:08:45] and that's where things were mixed up
[1:08:47] but let me just tell you something God
[1:08:48] knew what was coming in this hour God
[1:08:51] knew that he would restore and isua
[1:08:54] Street was not the restoration of the
[1:08:56] word it was not the long promised
[1:09:00] restoration but Aus stre was the
[1:09:03] restoration of the gifts right the
[1:09:07] supernatural moving Among Us once again
[1:09:11] but remember there are four messengers
[1:09:14] of death that ate away the tree in Joel
[1:09:17] chapter 2 and there's four messengers of
[1:09:20] life and that fourth one is the evening
[1:09:23] light it is Christ himself come down and
[1:09:28] making himself known not only through
[1:09:30] the ministry of Malachi 4 but now it's
[1:09:33] Christ impersonated in his bride once
[1:09:36] again where it is no longer two but
[1:09:39] these two have become one Hallelujah God
[1:09:44] himself has announced it there through
[1:09:46] that of the message where God spoke
[1:09:48] through the prophet in that of God
[1:09:50] hiding and revealing himself in
[1:09:52] Simplicity and the prophet said my first
[1:09:54] Duty for coming out of here was to marry
[1:09:57] a couple there in the back oh he says I
[1:10:00] trust that that is a type of what that
[1:10:03] God has called me to do in this last day
[1:10:05] think of it it's the announcement it's
[1:10:07] the call to the temple of God and then
[1:10:10] he steps forward that night to announce
[1:10:12] the breach what is the breach the breach
[1:10:15] is Christ himself the holy spirit that
[1:10:17] ties you and I back in to our
[1:10:20] inheritance it's Christ coming into his
[1:10:24] Temple amen am amenu Oh Glory and in his
[1:10:28] Temple is just like it was back there
[1:10:31] they had Snuffer dishes they had all of
[1:10:33] these utensils gifts that were needed
[1:10:37] for service and God has all of these in
[1:10:40] the body of Jesus Christ don't you love
[1:10:43] him for that is't that beautiful how God
[1:10:46] has it all put together oh my you know
[1:10:50] all of these things it comes to serve
[1:10:53] one great purpose this is why with the
[1:10:55] scripture I'm just going to give you a
[1:10:56] few scriptures here the Bible said he
[1:10:59] that he in John 7 that would believe on
[1:11:01] me had the scripture said out of his
[1:11:03] belly shall flow Rivers pearl of Living
[1:11:07] Water
[1:11:08] one in Psalms chapter 1 and verse three
[1:11:12] talking about this blessed man he shall
[1:11:15] be like a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:11:19] water Rivers non-spiritual gifts flowing
[1:11:23] out of the one same Source the same God
[1:11:27] and you you know you would look at that
[1:11:29] and the prophet as he goes into that and
[1:11:30] restoration the brid tree but I remember
[1:11:33] we've always got to keep in mind what
[1:11:35] are these gifts for because remember
[1:11:39] Satan is always tempting he tempted the
[1:11:42] Lord Jesus to try to get him to clown
[1:11:44] for him you say what do you mean by
[1:11:46] clown well I'm not talking about putting
[1:11:48] on a bozo suit with with a red nose but
[1:11:50] I'm talking about Satan was wanting him
[1:11:53] to do what he wanted him to do but the
[1:11:55] Lord Jesus though in the midst of
[1:11:58] Temptation he stood on the word of God
[1:12:03] and I want to just say it in this way
[1:12:05] that how God knows that within this hour
[1:12:08] there is a people on Earth that this is
[1:12:11] the brid tree that God had promised that
[1:12:15] he said I will restore where Satan
[1:12:17] himself when he ate he be to start on
[1:12:20] this right after the day of Pentecost it
[1:12:23] went for for a space of years there and
[1:12:26] then by the time it got to the Ephesian
[1:12:28] age she was already a fallen woman Satan
[1:12:32] had be to eat on that fruit and then he
[1:12:34] went from the fruit and took on the
[1:12:36] leaves and then he tried then he
[1:12:37] stripped the doctrine he can get into
[1:12:39] the life but the thing of it is that
[1:12:42] Satan ate all of that away but he forgot
[1:12:45] one thing you cannot stop the word from
[1:12:48] coming back and reproducing itself cu
[1:12:51] the life is in the roots and God said I
[1:12:56] will restore all not just some of it
[1:13:02] all amen he won't just be you know look
[1:13:05] like a Pentecostal Church of you know
[1:13:07] how it was back there in Acts two and
[1:13:10] you know like some rebuilt car that may
[1:13:12] have a a Ford motor and has a Chevy hood
[1:13:15] and that's not what God promised God
[1:13:18] promised that this bride would be
[1:13:20] hitting on 16 cylinders she would be a
[1:13:24] word bride through and through she would
[1:13:27] have she would have a word engine on the
[1:13:30] inside amen her life would be built and
[1:13:33] founded on God's holy word all the way
[1:13:36] through he said I will restore all the
[1:13:41] years and God has restored his word in
[1:13:46] this
[1:13:48] hour and the restoration of the word
[1:13:51] does not do away with the gifts among
[1:13:54] the body
[1:13:55] amen man's idea can do that but not
[1:13:58] God's word am but neither does man's
[1:14:02] theology exalt the
[1:14:04] gifts it's got its place the ministry
[1:14:08] that God has sent in this hour we
[1:14:10] recognize when there's a need then we
[1:14:13] move by the spirit of God and God will
[1:14:16] see fit to it to give us what we have
[1:14:18] need of abolutely thank you Lord oh
[1:14:20] friends that's why this seven seal the
[1:14:22] prophet said it's a relaxing time right
[1:14:27] are you hearing me we've entered into
[1:14:28] the rest of God that doesn't mean that
[1:14:31] you know somehow that we just you know
[1:14:32] like throwing confetti up in the air no
[1:14:35] it means that recognizing that God he
[1:14:38] has watched over our life all along it's
[1:14:41] God that has made a way time and time
[1:14:44] again it is God sovereignly that has
[1:14:46] known our need it is God that has
[1:14:48] ministered over our life and then to
[1:14:50] recognize wait a minute I didn't make
[1:14:52] none of this happen I didn't search
[1:14:54] myself
[1:14:55] it was not I who found this message it's
[1:14:58] not I who changed my life you know what
[1:15:00] when you begin to rehearse those things
[1:15:02] and remember it was God that brought you
[1:15:04] out of the iron furnace then you know
[1:15:07] what that does when you see it in that
[1:15:08] way you understand his miracles cuz you
[1:15:12] are one of his
[1:15:15] miracles
[1:15:17] Hallelujah and you're able to walk
[1:15:19] there's with there's a rest and you know
[1:15:21] what a rest is it's a confidence what is
[1:15:23] a confidence it's a faith and what is
[1:15:25] Faith built on
[1:15:28] love
[1:15:32] trust hallelujah hallelujah that is so
[1:15:35] good oh don't you love him God sent
[1:15:38] these gifts because he's there is fruit
[1:15:40] in this tree that's to be made
[1:15:43] manifest let me tell you the fruit is
[1:15:45] the fruit of the word and so God the
[1:15:48] purpose that he sent these these gifts
[1:15:51] is to keep the church clean amen am you
[1:15:56] know what God said I'm going to I'm
[1:15:57] placing this in there I can speak
[1:15:59] through them through my word I can speak
[1:16:01] through them through when they're
[1:16:02] Reading Writing devotion they're
[1:16:03] listening to the message in the cool of
[1:16:05] their room but I have set this there
[1:16:07] that just in case something gets a
[1:16:08] little off along the way I have set for
[1:16:11] my bride nine spiritual gifts because if
[1:16:14] something gets out of the way I know
[1:16:16] their desire is to please me and to
[1:16:18] bring forth fruit unto God so God
[1:16:23] himself is responsible amen and over his
[1:16:28] body oh brother we're not under
[1:16:30] denominational order no sir we're not
[1:16:33] under the isms of man we're under the
[1:16:36] leadership of the pillar of fire
[1:16:38] Hallelujah let me tell you we're under
[1:16:40] the same leadership that what it was
[1:16:43] when they came out of Egypt and Moses
[1:16:45] needed to know what to do the prophet
[1:16:48] said where Moses got all that he needed
[1:16:51] his leadership he got it out of that
[1:16:54] logos Pillar of Fire and he brought that
[1:16:57] down and it gave leadership to the
[1:17:00] people oh my I'm so glad that God speaks
[1:17:04] to our hearts aren't you I'm glad that
[1:17:06] God gives leadership to our lives so
[1:17:09] here we come 4 to one is given by the
[1:17:13] spirit the
[1:17:14] word of wisdom notice the word of wisdom
[1:17:19] so a Word of Wisdom that is given that
[1:17:24] remember
[1:17:25] it's not remember even with all of these
[1:17:27] gifts from tongues prophecy all of them
[1:17:31] it's not about what we
[1:17:34] think the prophet even said it like this
[1:17:37] when it come to a gift of healing he
[1:17:39] said many times I would look at somebody
[1:17:41] and say oh God I want to just go pray
[1:17:43] for them and that they would get well he
[1:17:45] said but the Holy Spirit would not allow
[1:17:47] me to do it and he would direct me over
[1:17:49] to this one and it may not even be that
[1:17:51] that serious of a need and you say where
[1:17:53] is that in the scripture it was at the
[1:17:55] pool of
[1:17:56] Bethesda Jesus stepped over one stepped
[1:17:59] over another stepped over another went
[1:18:00] to a man who had a condition that wasn't
[1:18:02] going to kill
[1:18:04] him oh brother and sister you know if we
[1:18:07] can just step back and look at that you
[1:18:08] see God's sovereignty in it all look God
[1:18:11] knew right where you and I were
[1:18:13] laying he knew right where you and I
[1:18:16] were at brother I'm glad this is not the
[1:18:19] compassion of of human I believe in
[1:18:21] human compassion I thank God for human
[1:18:22] compassion but I'm grateful for the
[1:18:24] compassion of God and you know what it
[1:18:26] is it's the compassion according to his
[1:18:29] word by
[1:18:31] election I'm grateful for the compassion
[1:18:34] of God that yes stretched out for those
[1:18:36] who would not even believe in Divine
[1:18:38] Healing but God would provide medicine
[1:18:39] and doctors that is so good I tell you
[1:18:42] you talking about love you talking about
[1:18:45] love that could stand there for people
[1:18:46] said I don't even believe in God and God
[1:18:49] desire to help Humanity in such a way oh
[1:18:53] my Hallelujah oh but a word of wisdom so
[1:18:58] it's not our thoughts it's not our
[1:19:00] thinking it's not man's thoughts it's a
[1:19:02] word of wisdom and there's only one true
[1:19:06] source of this kind of wisdom amen now
[1:19:09] remember the Bible tells this in Ezekiel
[1:19:11] chapter 28 that Satan was full of wisdom
[1:19:14] as well but Satan's wisdom is a
[1:19:17] deviation from the word of
[1:19:20] God is that right Satan's cunning and
[1:19:23] and and you know th way I mean look look
[1:19:26] look look look this is why the prophet
[1:19:27] said that within it all even all of
[1:19:30] these gifts not just tongues not just
[1:19:31] interpretation not just prophecy but
[1:19:34] even a Word of Wisdom when it comes down
[1:19:36] to it at the end of the day we must have
[1:19:39] the Holy
[1:19:41] Ghost that's what matters at the end of
[1:19:44] the day and so to understand that that
[1:19:47] the wisdom of God when it comes down
[1:19:50] it's never going to lead you away from
[1:19:53] God's word
[1:19:54] is that right God even told him in
[1:19:57] Deuteronomy 13 there can be prophets
[1:20:00] that will they will show signs and
[1:20:01] wonders and they'll hit right on the
[1:20:03] mark but he said if they then watch what
[1:20:06] comes out of their mouth if it seeks to
[1:20:08] take you away from the word it's a false
[1:20:11] prophet I don't care how I don't care
[1:20:13] how punctual the signs and wonders are
[1:20:16] you listen to the teaching of the word
[1:20:19] by their fruits their teaching you shall
[1:20:22] know them
[1:20:25] that's why the prophet said in the
[1:20:26] Harvest Time think of this think of this
[1:20:28] title
[1:20:29] 1964 Satan can hand out gifts by the
[1:20:36] handfuls wow now A Word of Wisdom
[1:20:40] everybody
[1:20:41] ready the prophet says if you'll notice
[1:20:44] the routine of the gifts the first is a
[1:20:46] gift of wisdom the first is the gift of
[1:20:48] wisdom that is the best gift of the
[1:20:51] group if you don't if we don't have
[1:20:53] wisdom we won't know how to use
[1:20:55] knowledge it's the second gift that's
[1:20:59] now let me just lik it in this way
[1:21:01] there's things no doubt that every one
[1:21:02] of us have let things slip out of our
[1:21:04] mouth and we could said I wish I'd have
[1:21:07] had some wisdom over that
[1:21:10] knowledge wouldn't have said it at that
[1:21:13] time wouldn't have said it in that way
[1:21:15] we had knowledge but it's wisdom we want
[1:21:19] wisdom to be over the knowledge this is
[1:21:21] why God gave wisdom it's the first gift
[1:21:24] that he even talks
[1:21:26] about now he says if we can't use the
[1:21:30] second gift without wisdom how are we
[1:21:32] going to use the last gift of
[1:21:34] interpretation or the next or the last
[1:21:36] speaking in tongues our Zeal has eat up
[1:21:40] our wisdom and our Zeal for our
[1:21:44] denominations and our enthusiasm now
[1:21:46] listen don't let that word denominations
[1:21:47] trip you up denominations is a framework
[1:21:50] of
[1:21:51] thinking this is where this is where
[1:21:53] even in a even in a way of thinking of
[1:21:56] well this is the way I look at it and
[1:21:57] this is the way and and then watch watch
[1:21:59] here's one thing we can disagree but
[1:22:02] there's another thing that if when we
[1:22:04] disagree and then things begin to lead
[1:22:07] away from the word by reasoning that's
[1:22:10] no longer just something that we don't
[1:22:11] see and disagree there's somewhere along
[1:22:14] the line we never want to be led away
[1:22:17] from the word denominations did not
[1:22:20] start in some school somewhere it starts
[1:22:23] with a deviation from the
[1:22:25] word and so our our Zeal for our
[1:22:27] denominations and our enthusiasm has eat
[1:22:31] up the wisdom off the vine brotherly
[1:22:35] love oh Lord have mercy what does
[1:22:39] Brotherly Love have to do with it
[1:22:42] everything you know what Brotherly Love
[1:22:44] is being able to put yourself in the
[1:22:46] other person's shoes who's wronged
[1:22:49] you that's a direct quote statue of a
[1:22:52] perfect man that's what Brotherly Love
[1:22:54] Is
[1:22:55] is being able to do that now let's just
[1:22:57] be honest there's not one of us in our
[1:23:00] natural abilities that really would have
[1:23:03] the level to be able to do that outside
[1:23:07] of it being by the spirit of God and
[1:23:09] even then it's a wrestling that goes on
[1:23:13] but you know what he already prevailed
[1:23:15] in one
[1:23:16] Garden that was only a sign he was going
[1:23:19] to Prevail in this
[1:23:21] Garden is that right the word will have
[1:23:24] its way
[1:23:25] glory be to God that's why how the word
[1:23:27] comes in in Revelations 10 8-1 it comes
[1:23:30] down into the garden there's a oh
[1:23:32] there's a churning going on a wrestling
[1:23:34] match that's going on but
[1:23:36] remember he will prevail yes he will
[1:23:40] amen there's an Abel buried beneath that
[1:23:43] can is that right oh man there's an
[1:23:46] Israel that's greater than your
[1:23:49] Esau glory be to God notice that it eat
[1:23:53] up the Zeal eat up wisdom the Zeal what
[1:23:56] Zeal it's it's going after things it's
[1:23:58] doing this without the wisdom of God but
[1:24:00] God knowing what we have need of he says
[1:24:02] the first gift in the line of gifts is
[1:24:04] wisdom the second is knowledge and if
[1:24:06] you don't have wisdom how do you know
[1:24:08] what to do with knowledge seek the best
[1:24:11] things first wisdom and if you ain't got
[1:24:13] wisdom what can you do with knowledge
[1:24:16] speaking in tongues or these other
[1:24:17] things it takes wisdom it takes God's
[1:24:20] wisdom and Solomon said call it your
[1:24:23] mother
[1:24:25] he says what did they do the Pentecost
[1:24:27] was received speaking in tongues and
[1:24:29] they made a denomination out of it and
[1:24:30] they went and said this is it I mix
[1:24:33] multitude with them now think about the
[1:24:35] time that we are living in in this hour
[1:24:38] we're living in the Time of Our God has
[1:24:43] called a
[1:24:45] people out of
[1:24:48] denominationalism now God couldn't call
[1:24:50] you and I out of
[1:24:52] denominationalism by denominational ISM
[1:24:54] right right but it had to be the free
[1:24:59] word it had to be the word himself he
[1:25:01] was put out right he was put out and
[1:25:04] here he is on the outside and and he
[1:25:08] here he is knocking you know here at at
[1:25:11] at the door but now it's turned to
[1:25:13] individuals because the church put him
[1:25:15] out so God is calling individuals out
[1:25:19] he's calling Our Lives to be open unto
[1:25:22] him and notice if he's calling us out
[1:25:24] out he's going to take us into something
[1:25:28] the scripture said in Luke Luke 17 it
[1:25:31] said as it was in the in the days of lot
[1:25:34] coming out and right so shall it be in
[1:25:37] the days of the son of man and as it was
[1:25:39] in the days of Noah it was a coming out
[1:25:41] and a going in so God is calling us out
[1:25:44] of see this is why that if somebody
[1:25:46] wants to call you out and you know run
[1:25:48] down whether it's church or run down the
[1:25:50] message ask them what they have for you
[1:25:52] instead amen right
[1:25:54] where are you taking
[1:25:58] me don't be just taking me to to just
[1:26:01] you know follow your little way no where
[1:26:02] are you going to where are you taking me
[1:26:05] to show
[1:26:08] me that'll say a lot right
[1:26:10] there and if they say freedom what you
[1:26:13] realize and know is that they have been
[1:26:17] in bondage the whole time because they
[1:26:19] never did get the new
[1:26:21] birth and the Commandments of God first
[1:26:25] John chapter 5 the Commandments of God
[1:26:27] were Grievious unto them
[1:26:30] that's are you hearing now I'm not
[1:26:33] sliding God can reach down and turn
[1:26:35] their life right around but let me just
[1:26:37] tell you something I have no desire to
[1:26:39] go back to what God brought me out of I
[1:26:42] don't have no desire look the bridges
[1:26:44] have been
[1:26:45] burnt I don't got things saved in the
[1:26:48] closet just in
[1:26:50] case you know I better keep these like
[1:26:52] you know the prophet says that we hang
[1:26:54] them up in the closet just in case I
[1:26:56] don't have the goods that's not listen
[1:26:59] you just let God listen if you're here
[1:27:01] tonight in that place say God burn it
[1:27:03] out of my heart because he burns it out
[1:27:06] of your heart don't worry you'll get it
[1:27:07] out of your
[1:27:11] closet is that all right you see that it
[1:27:15] works with the inside God Will Take Care
[1:27:17] it takes care of the inside it'll it'll
[1:27:19] come off it'll work its way to the
[1:27:20] outside but that is wisdom of how that
[1:27:23] God would move among us to bring us out
[1:27:26] and to bring us in this is why the
[1:27:27] scripture says that Joshua was
[1:27:31] full of the spirit of
[1:27:34] wisdom because this ministry it's a
[1:27:38] placing in the
[1:27:39] body and so it's looking at
[1:27:43] remember oh my you you have this gift or
[1:27:46] you do this or or they'll say oh no you
[1:27:48] don't do anything I don't want to be
[1:27:49] like
[1:27:52] you yeah be very careful because those
[1:27:55] that you that may not be visible they
[1:27:58] may never stand on this stage at any
[1:28:00] point but let me just tell you something
[1:28:02] are the nuts and bolts that's right that
[1:28:06] hold this thing together in prayer are
[1:28:09] you hearing me brother BR said the
[1:28:10] success of my meetings and pulled back
[1:28:12] that curtain and those that were praying
[1:28:15] I'm not saying those that stand up here
[1:28:16] don't have a part but I'm just saying is
[1:28:18] is don't despise the day of small things
[1:28:22] that's right what God has called called
[1:28:24] you to do is a vital part and nobody can
[1:28:27] take your place but Satan wants to try
[1:28:30] to minimize things and be like this and
[1:28:32] be like that but the spirit of wisdom
[1:28:35] helps us to recognize what God has for
[1:28:38] us and let him Place us where he wants
[1:28:41] us to operate because we'll never be a
[1:28:45] success anywhere else other than what
[1:28:48] God has called us to operate is that
[1:28:50] right so to understand that that part of
[1:28:53] it that when God has placed and and
[1:28:56] bring brings these forth all in its time
[1:28:58] this is why that we need that Spirit of
[1:29:01] wisdom Solomon asked for wisdom every
[1:29:03] time through through the all of the
[1:29:05] quotes that I have studied with this
[1:29:07] just isolating gift of wisdom and gift
[1:29:09] of healing and then you know breaking it
[1:29:11] up into different words so that it's not
[1:29:13] grouped and just going through every
[1:29:15] time the prophet will come back to this
[1:29:18] this of wisdom that God gave to Solomon
[1:29:22] now I just want you to understand this
[1:29:24] we see this he wasn't born with this
[1:29:26] wisdom
[1:29:27] sir but when he saw the task that was
[1:29:31] before
[1:29:32] him God God placed here his father in
[1:29:37] his life and his father told him this is
[1:29:40] what you need to ask for and it had to
[1:29:42] be something that was just more than him
[1:29:44] repeating words something had to drop in
[1:29:47] Solomon's heart that he could see the
[1:29:49] burden and the need and he realized dear
[1:29:52] Lord right I'm I'm unfit to do this on
[1:29:55] my
[1:29:56] own I mean think about it it's
[1:29:58] overwhelming I don't know how you felt
[1:30:00] but I mean I felt like you know you
[1:30:02] you've come to that place you know here
[1:30:04] when you get married you think oh dear
[1:30:06] lord I you know I thought I had all the
[1:30:07] p's and q's together and you go along
[1:30:09] and you realize oh wait a minute I don't
[1:30:11] and and you you know why because it's
[1:30:13] it's schooling right that's right you
[1:30:15] could read all the books to your blue in
[1:30:17] the face oh absolutely right it's like
[1:30:19] you could read all the journal abstracts
[1:30:21] about you know about uh parent in and
[1:30:24] doing this and doing that but when Boots
[1:30:26] get on the
[1:30:30] ground that's when you have to live it
[1:30:32] out right and I'm not saying that
[1:30:34] there's nice little things that we can
[1:30:35] draw from little things and little
[1:30:37] articles and and those things here and
[1:30:39] there that we come but we recognize God
[1:30:41] I need wisdom right hey isn't that what
[1:30:46] manoah
[1:30:47] asked he said ask the angel to his wife
[1:30:51] to come back ask that man to come back
[1:30:54] Hallelujah and he came back and he asked
[1:30:57] him how shall we order this child's life
[1:31:02] that is so you see what he was looking
[1:31:04] for it man had all these Ambitions and
[1:31:06] all these things of man here's a child
[1:31:08] and you know what we're going to do with
[1:31:10] him and with this or her or whatever
[1:31:12] more but then God makes known it's a him
[1:31:15] God didn't get his pronouns mixed up
[1:31:17] either that's right he's
[1:31:20] clear all right that's right and and
[1:31:23] notice he asked him and said what how
[1:31:25] shall we order his life oh my you see
[1:31:28] this is what listen I'm not saying we
[1:31:31] don't need teaching of the word we do I
[1:31:33] believe in teaching of the word and I
[1:31:35] believe that as we're praying and we're
[1:31:37] asking God for wisdom and Direction our
[1:31:39] life this is just one of the small
[1:31:43] channels that God can work
[1:31:45] through he can come right in your prayer
[1:31:48] closet he can come right while you're
[1:31:50] listening to the message he can come
[1:31:52] right through another brother or sister
[1:31:55] that you're
[1:31:58] unsuspecting that's why you don't want
[1:31:59] to try to put him in a
[1:32:02] box you might try to put him in a box
[1:32:04] and get all discouraged and walk out in
[1:32:06] the vesb and God's Got the Word of
[1:32:08] Wisdom that you
[1:32:09] need and you're walking out there having
[1:32:11] to care of your bottom lip oh he he
[1:32:13] didn't read the right text and God you
[1:32:15] didn't you know Lord you didn't and and
[1:32:17] God's got it all in
[1:32:19] control he's got it all in
[1:32:21] control so notice he asked God this is I
[1:32:25] need wisdom I need wisdom and
[1:32:28] understanding to lead this people amen
[1:32:31] and he asked God for that with this in
[1:32:33] mind Unity amen that it would be wisdom
[1:32:38] because the wisdom that comes from god
[1:32:40] it works to hold together in unity to
[1:32:44] the
[1:32:45] promise is that right and this is where
[1:32:48] that when we see this that you know
[1:32:50] Solomon you can read this later on you
[1:32:52] Bible readers you're familiar with it in
[1:32:54] First Kings chapter 3 you know in verse
[1:32:56] 9 he wrote about requesting this and you
[1:32:58] know because in Solomon I mean it it
[1:33:02] must have hit him and I think it
[1:33:03] continued to hit him as he went on but
[1:33:05] because you know why we're dealing with
[1:33:08] humanity and listen friends even with
[1:33:10] the attribute of God in our life that
[1:33:12] attribute is still surrounded by
[1:33:15] humanity and there is diverse matters
[1:33:18] that at times in the humanness of life
[1:33:21] that can be entangling
[1:33:24] complicated and don't even have a black
[1:33:26] and white answer we need wisdom that's
[1:33:30] so true you see many times God's people
[1:33:32] do not get in trouble with black and
[1:33:37] white where we need help is with the
[1:33:39] gray
[1:33:40] areas that's where Satan wants to try to
[1:33:43] come in and snag and trap and punch and
[1:33:46] and that's why the word comes to expose
[1:33:49] where Satan has wanted to ens snare Us
[1:33:51] in Gray
[1:33:52] areas amen that's so good now let's look
[1:33:55] at Solomon here just for a moment in
[1:33:57] First Kings 3 and verse 16- 23 I I'm not
[1:34:01] going to put this one up there but I
[1:34:03] just want to refer to it remember there
[1:34:04] two women who came they were
[1:34:07] harlots they both had given birth at the
[1:34:09] same time that's right and one of them
[1:34:12] went to sleep or rolled over on their
[1:34:14] child and their child died so in the
[1:34:16] middle of the night the one whose child
[1:34:18] died went over and took the other one
[1:34:20] her child and replaced it with her dead
[1:34:23] child
[1:34:24] right and then when this one woke up she
[1:34:27] looked at that and said this isn't
[1:34:31] mine this isn't mine 't there something
[1:34:34] mama knows which ones are
[1:34:36] hers boy Lord Jesus isin't it something
[1:34:41] that mother our New
[1:34:42] Jerusalem that Holy Spirit that we are
[1:34:45] born of that great Eagle of God he knows
[1:34:49] who belongs to him Hallelujah
[1:34:54] he knows
[1:34:55] his hallu that's why this message keeps
[1:34:59] going and keeps going listen friends
[1:35:02] that's why it's went into our lives it
[1:35:04] might have hit first your human spirit
[1:35:06] and here mama Eagle said no no that's
[1:35:08] not it there's my Eagles down there on
[1:35:11] the
[1:35:12] inside and Mama Eagle that quickening
[1:35:15] power kept dealing with that son and
[1:35:18] daughter of God on the inside to do what
[1:35:21] call you out of this Pond of mud that we
[1:35:25] were put in and what comes out a
[1:35:30] Lily and what are lies what are the
[1:35:33] flowers of the lies it speaks of
[1:35:37] [Applause]
[1:35:41] [Music]
[1:35:42] Resurrection my
[1:35:44] my
[1:35:47] glory so
[1:35:50] Solomon this dispute has come up so
[1:35:53] Solomon looks and he says bring me a
[1:35:55] sword speak it to the two women bring me
[1:35:57] a sword they brought a sword before the
[1:35:59] king and the King said divide the living
[1:36:02] child in two give half to the one half
[1:36:05] to the
[1:36:06] other then spake the woman whose the
[1:36:09] living child was unto the king for her
[1:36:12] bows yearned upon her son and she said
[1:36:15] oh my Lord give her the living child and
[1:36:19] in no wise slay it but the other said
[1:36:23] let it be neither mine nor thine but
[1:36:26] divided then the king answered and said
[1:36:29] give her the living child and in no wise
[1:36:33] slay it she is the mother thereof the
[1:36:36] one who said give it give it to her
[1:36:40] that's whose child that
[1:36:42] is what was that a word of
[1:36:46] wisdom a situation that we did not have
[1:36:51] something to go by here turn toap after
[1:36:53] so and so how do I be baptized no it
[1:36:57] wasn't written this wasn't written there
[1:36:58] this was a situation that came up amen
[1:37:01] that we needed a word of
[1:37:05] wisdom so
[1:37:08] notice brother Brams talks about this
[1:37:10] and I love just let me just read this a
[1:37:11] little bit he said when Solomon the son
[1:37:13] of David when he took the throne well he
[1:37:15] never prayed that God would give him so
[1:37:17] much but just wisdom to know how to
[1:37:22] govern and hold hold the people
[1:37:27] together that's what the real wisdom of
[1:37:29] God the real wisdom of God isn't isn't
[1:37:32] you know showing or displaying it's for
[1:37:34] one purpose Lord Grace that the people
[1:37:37] might be helped governed and held
[1:37:40] together holding to the promise of God
[1:37:43] no wonder the prophet said how that the
[1:37:44] pastor himself it should be the wisdom
[1:37:47] operating in his life cuz he tells us
[1:37:49] over here in the message of the absolute
[1:37:52] he's got to have an absolute that he
[1:37:53] holds over that congregation an absolute
[1:37:56] of the reality of Jesus Christ he tells
[1:37:58] us in power of transformation he said it
[1:38:01] takes the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:38:03] to keep a group of people together in
[1:38:05] harmony and let me just tell you that
[1:38:06] ain't no easy
[1:38:08] task it takes the leadership of the Holy
[1:38:11] Spirit not a Tutti Frutti not a sweet
[1:38:13] powder sugary guy it takes the
[1:38:16] leadership of the Holy Spirit are you
[1:38:19] with me it and to for what purpose
[1:38:22] holding to the message of the hour amen
[1:38:25] because Satan's all listen Satan's
[1:38:28] distractions is to try to get you away
[1:38:32] from your Liberty from the message that
[1:38:35] he'll use any little thing that's where
[1:38:38] you want to that's where we want to
[1:38:39] discern him now notice within this and
[1:38:42] let's bring it down here just for a few
[1:38:43] moments here in the local body you know
[1:38:46] Paul would write of this of and he
[1:38:48] speaks to the Corinthian Church and he
[1:38:50] said dare any of you having a matter
[1:38:52] against another go to law before the
[1:38:54] unjust and not before the Saints do you
[1:38:57] not know that the Saints shall judge the
[1:38:59] world and if the world shall be judged
[1:39:01] by you are you unworthy to judge the
[1:39:04] smallest matters know ye that we shall
[1:39:07] judge Angels how much more that pertain
[1:39:09] to this life if then you have judgments
[1:39:12] of things pertaining to this life set
[1:39:14] them to judge who are least esteemed in
[1:39:18] the church and he said I speak this to
[1:39:20] your shame is it so that there's not a
[1:39:22] wise man man among you know not one that
[1:39:26] shall be able to judge between his
[1:39:28] brethen now you say brother Samuel that
[1:39:29] says judge and judges also to discern
[1:39:32] and the prophet tells us that even with
[1:39:33] this a Word of Wisdom he said that
[1:39:35] discernment works right with it but
[1:39:38] brother goeth to law with Brethren that
[1:39:40] before unbelievers he said that's an
[1:39:42] utterly a fault among you because you go
[1:39:44] to law with one another why do you not
[1:39:46] rather take wrong why why do you not
[1:39:49] rather just post it on Instagram no they
[1:39:51] don't say that why don't you rather just
[1:39:54] suffer yourselves to be defrauded nay
[1:39:57] you do wrong and defraud and that your
[1:39:59] brother it just becomes endless cycle
[1:40:02] right two wrongs don't make a
[1:40:05] right is that right I know that's a
[1:40:08] simple saying but it's true it's a
[1:40:11] simple one but you notice Paul he he
[1:40:14] would write of this because there's
[1:40:16] situations that would
[1:40:18] arise that we would need a Word of
[1:40:21] Wisdom there's situations that AR rise
[1:40:24] that even like brother Brandon mentions
[1:40:25] here and I've read this quote to you I'm
[1:40:27] not going to do it again tonight but he
[1:40:29] speaks of how when somebody would come
[1:40:30] and say you know what job or what church
[1:40:33] do I take do I take this church or do I
[1:40:35] take that church and and brother Brandon
[1:40:37] would just tell us he said well that's
[1:40:38] something that's going to have to come
[1:40:40] through another
[1:40:41] ministry that's something now God can
[1:40:44] use tongues he can use interpretation he
[1:40:46] use he can use whatever gift but look
[1:40:48] with even in this right here sometimes
[1:40:50] these are things right here that are not
[1:40:52] seen seemed to be so
[1:40:56] spiritual let me tell you I've watched
[1:40:58] God work through the word of wisdom and
[1:41:01] you know at the time it didn't maybe all
[1:41:03] of a sudden seem so spiritual but you
[1:41:05] watch how God things that God would
[1:41:07] speak and say and things would come to
[1:41:10] pass and work right out I was talking
[1:41:12] with brother Brian here just uh I don't
[1:41:13] know if it was a couple weeks ago or
[1:41:15] whatever he was at the house for the
[1:41:16] youth meeting or pick a kids up and we
[1:41:18] were talking about when he had he had
[1:41:20] two jobs he was between and uh you know
[1:41:23] he he liked both jobs but actually one
[1:41:25] he wanted a little bit more and you know
[1:41:27] we're sitting there and I'm just going
[1:41:28] to tell you you you know this right now
[1:41:30] I'm not going to make nothing up I don't
[1:41:32] I don't have to put on nothing for
[1:41:34] nobody and I'm going to just tell you a
[1:41:36] pastor is not a
[1:41:37] prophet I know sometimes that can get
[1:41:39] people they they they can get spoiled
[1:41:41] and think it's got to you got to show a
[1:41:43] vision way if God wants to do that he
[1:41:44] can do that yeah if God wants to show a
[1:41:46] dream he can do that God wants to do he
[1:41:48] can do that however God whatever is is
[1:41:51] needed in that moment but then again
[1:41:54] there's things that you can come to and
[1:41:55] you just have to say you know what let's
[1:41:57] just pray about it and we I remember at
[1:41:59] the the latter part of we were sitting
[1:42:01] right there we actually sitting over in
[1:42:02] the conference room at the time and we
[1:42:04] were sitting there and you know I didn't
[1:42:06] know what to tell him we I listened to
[1:42:07] the situation and all of a sudden and I
[1:42:09] don't even know how now how together how
[1:42:11] it all came out but it came out in such
[1:42:13] a way of what a fleece of what to be
[1:42:16] laid before that company uh the next day
[1:42:19] and you know what I got a call the next
[1:42:21] day and here he was he's like hey they
[1:42:23] said they would pay for this insurance
[1:42:24] up to this part and they would do this
[1:42:26] and they would do that you know God
[1:42:28] knows what we have need of when we have
[1:42:30] need of it now God didn't have to do
[1:42:34] that in a back room you know with with
[1:42:37] just us together he could have gained
[1:42:38] that answer right across here but it's
[1:42:40] not up to us to determine that but I'm
[1:42:43] also glad that God is so mindful that he
[1:42:46] won't just say you didn't get it through
[1:42:48] the preaching of the word tough luck wow
[1:42:51] that's so good that's not
[1:42:54] God God is interested in helping his
[1:42:59] people he's interested let me tell you
[1:43:01] something he's more interested than
[1:43:03] sometimes when we've just thrown in the
[1:43:05] towel on something that we've been
[1:43:06] praying about but let me just tell you
[1:43:08] you might have felt like you threw in
[1:43:10] the towel but let me remind you Daniel
[1:43:13] The First Time You Prayed he
[1:43:16] heard your answer might be held up but
[1:43:19] the answer's on the way and God's Got
[1:43:23] reinforcements to come your way that's
[1:43:25] right that's right right
[1:43:29] woo glory to God man I'm glad God's not
[1:43:32] like us and says that's it
[1:43:36] befriended no but he said I'm your
[1:43:38] friend you're my
[1:43:41] friend God calls us his buddies his
[1:43:44] bride but the wisdom is the best of the
[1:43:49] group that's so good the best I'm that
[1:43:52] that particular quote let me let me
[1:43:54] close on
[1:43:55] this Prophet would refer to these two
[1:43:58] scriptures in the Book of Revelations he
[1:44:00] said when he even makes that statement
[1:44:03] because how that God would say here is
[1:44:07] wisdom let him count the number of the
[1:44:11] Beast and I don't have to go through all
[1:44:13] the quotes with on that then notice
[1:44:16] verse 17 or 179 here is the mind which
[1:44:20] hath wisdom and brother Brandon would
[1:44:22] say it in this way he says now you find
[1:44:27] all through these Church ages here
[1:44:28] pulling out the Holy Spirit speaking how
[1:44:30] those gifts would be working in the last
[1:44:32] days we've got Gifts of healing working
[1:44:34] oh it's going good well brother there's
[1:44:37] other gifts that's just one of them
[1:44:40] that's just a little minor thing here's
[1:44:42] a here's a far greater gift right here
[1:44:45] which would be the best the gift of the
[1:44:48] Holy Ghost of wisdom to put the word of
[1:44:51] God together and to share show the
[1:44:53] church where we're standing than to just
[1:44:55] get somebody healed we said we all want
[1:44:58] to be well but I'd rather have my soul
[1:45:00] well than my body well
[1:45:05] anytime let me just say this to you that
[1:45:07] wisdom that God has given without me
[1:45:11] prolonging the time you can go into the
[1:45:14] Book of Daniel and it speaks of how God
[1:45:17] filled Daniel and the others with
[1:45:21] wisdom but Daniel had wisdom that was
[1:45:23] given by God that even the others didn't
[1:45:26] have that level of
[1:45:29] administration are you with me Daniel
[1:45:32] had a different a level of
[1:45:33] administration as the prophet in that
[1:45:37] time and God would speak to him even how
[1:45:41] the wisdom of God in Daniel when the
[1:45:44] king dreamed a dream and said which one
[1:45:47] of you astrologers can interpret this
[1:45:49] dream and they said well King tell us
[1:45:51] the dream y'all know the story tell us
[1:45:52] the
[1:45:53] dream he said yeah I'd give you the time
[1:45:57] you'd been making something
[1:45:58] up so he sent a decree right kill every
[1:46:03] one of
[1:46:04] them but here was a man that was full of
[1:46:07] wisdom and wisdom holds for
[1:46:11] Life tell the king don't be so
[1:46:14] Hasty there's a God who can reveal these
[1:46:18] [Applause]
[1:46:20] things you see what it is the gifts it's
[1:46:22] all about edifying it's about life
[1:46:25] edification to the church and here God
[1:46:29] gave Daniel that wisdom and remember man
[1:46:32] they just oh they thought Daniel they
[1:46:34] they even made an image wanted to
[1:46:35] worship Him and Daniel told him he said
[1:46:37] look God didn't give this to me has
[1:46:39] known that I'm more than anybody else
[1:46:40] God did it to preserve
[1:46:43] life can you run with me just a few
[1:46:46] moments God has given this end time
[1:46:49] Revelation to you and I to preserve our
[1:46:53] life for
[1:46:55] Rapture because we're not in the place
[1:46:58] of interpreting Daniel's image but we're
[1:47:02] in the hour the stone is fixing to come
[1:47:05] in and the prophet said God in his Mercy
[1:47:09] has sent a Ministry to catch while the
[1:47:12] Stone is coming in a catch of people
[1:47:15] away Hall call us out of that image unto
[1:47:19] the Beast call us out and we see the you
[1:47:23] big toes have already been here kof and
[1:47:26] isah Hower and God has sent a word
[1:47:30] wisdom Hallelujah
[1:47:33] life to lead us out to safety amen and
[1:47:38] you know what that's done in our life
[1:47:40] sister Rosanne you know what that's done
[1:47:42] in our
[1:47:43] life young Brothers you know what that's
[1:47:45] done in our life let me tell you what
[1:47:47] this wisdom coming down from God has
[1:47:48] done it has put the church in order amen
[1:47:52] it has put our lives in order as a
[1:47:56] matter of fact when God came down and he
[1:47:58] the wisdom of God
[1:48:02] said you ready get your instrument up
[1:48:05] getting ready to go and here's the
[1:48:08] symphony is on the scene and here is one
[1:48:11] who is in the original Spirit of the
[1:48:14] composer standing as a director under
[1:48:17] the inspiration and begins to take and

[2:14:22] live Lord I
[2:14:25] love you
[2:14:27] more and every day I
[2:14:32] live Lord I love you more
[2:14:38] [Music]
