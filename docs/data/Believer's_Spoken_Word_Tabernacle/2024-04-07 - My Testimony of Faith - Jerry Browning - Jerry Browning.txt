through the Old Testament and he would show that for every situation for every need every one of those Redemptive names God would make himself known that this situation I've got it in control and I'm the God of this situation yes sir I'm the god of your need I'm thankful for that because every one of those compound Redemptive names it's all God and all of that will was poured into Christ and now that we are in him and he is in us all that we have need of the Prophet said once you have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost all that you have need of including the Rapture is in you then so what we have need of he's our provider he is our peace he's our Banner he's our Shield aren't you glad for that aren't you glad that he's all things Amen to us as a Believer amen we just want to say uh this morning that we are so thankful uh I know different ones were able to be there to yesterday others of you were not able uh you know but I thank you for praying uh for us and for the family as we were different ones were gathered there yesterday for to see uh sister Linda and the the homegoing and the celebration amen for our sister and um you know that's that's one of those things that uh and brother Jerry as he was ministering at here and what we had even said on Thursday night we'll certainly miss her here but it's like Paul says we mourn but we don't mourn as others because we we've got an expectation amen we know that we're soon and very soon amen that we're going to be reunited once again and I you know when I was down there in um in Jeffersonville and we were there in the meetings and um I just got back to the office after the Sunday morning service and I walked in and I picked up my phone in between the services and I seen where she had passed and uh I just told my wife I said you know I said I thought about like brother brandham went beyond the curtain of time I said brother brandham when he went beyond the curtain of time I said he looked back now he he wasn't even in a a condition that sister Linda was in but it's still nonetheless was this body and he asked the Lord he said do I have to go back into that thing do I have to go back into that thing but it was for a purpose and so this Veil is we only here in this Veil for a temporary time but I'm glad there's already been a connection made to the other side aren't you and I think as the spirit of the Lord came by our way on Thursday night and this is this is a moment this is why we have the services that we have it's a Time of preparation it's a time to be ready it's a time to be very sure it's a time to move on in as the spirit of God is dealing with our hearts amen it's a moment when we when we think of that any the spirit of God desires to bring a real rest and a real peace a solidness in every heart in life to where you can know beyond the shadow of a doubt that I'm included in that Rapture in that Resurrection because when that happens in your life that's just not about for what's coming yet that's very important but that will affect the way you live right now because when you have that assurance that trumps everything going on in your life even when offenses come that's greater that's good that's what allows to put everything else back in line where it needs to be amen don't you love him I want to just share a little something here with you maybe musicians just hold on a second can you kick it over there for me I want to just share something here with you uh a scripture um and this is very familiar to us but I want these these scripture and this is even in regarding it says Nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and great earthquakes shall be in divers mean many different places and famines and pestilence and fearful sights and Great Signs shall there be from heaven and we we understand of these of of this in this hour and time we can read it through many of the places of the gospel and you know I thought of it even as we were on our way here today they're already starting the preparation for people coming in here for this eclipse and there such preparation and my wife just made a simple comment when we were going by she said isn't it incredible because you have people at the end down here that they're setting up and they're going to be selling food you've got them blocked off in the Black River she said it and incredible people would make such preparation for an event like this instead of preparing for their soul because all of I thought that I said well maybe should have her come up and say it but but uh I thought that was I thought that was very good I'm sorry honey I didn't mean to embarrass you but I just said you know what I said that's exactly the truth you know you see people can become so enamored with things that's going on and we see everything that has taken place all around us we know we're not a pign a people that Paul said we're not ignorant of this time that we're living in we know the hour that we're living in because one of the greatest signs and the truest signs you could have all of this and it still not be a sign of the end time the sign of the end time is God would send a prophet and a prophet is a sign of judgment that's coming before mercy and we've already we've receive that and we're seeing these things come come about here I want to show you this picture here and uh this picture this is a path of the eclipse that that that line as it's coming down the one that comes from Washington down like this way right here when you look at this one right here this pathway right here that's 2017 this is right from our government website but then you find this part right here this is 2024 this is and this is where we are right over in here and I want you to notice this it's just a black mark across the nation ohow a black mark right across the nation sir and I want you to notice this here brother Bram makes a statement in choosing of a bride he said so I pray Lord in jesus' name let people shake themselves tonight flee from the Wrath that is to come for inad is rote over the doors and over the Nations a black check mark has come across it the spirit of God is grieved away from it and they're weighed in the balances and found wanting the Feast of Nebuchadnezzar has repeated again with drunken parties and half-dressed women calling themselves Christians I say we have arrived we have arrived yes sir and I you know I you you know me a lot you can go aad switch it off uh uh you know there's not a lot of things and I I just look at it I don't try to make a lot of things out of things I don't spend my time in that way uh just everybody has to do according to how they're LED of the Lord but I know if inspiration comes but I look at this right here and I think and when I see that I say God thank you for for your mercy because we see judgment is all around us in this hour that's right and we see that you know brother Bram said that God is taking his people beyond the camp of just relying on human reasoning but he said Satan is also taking his people beyond the camp of human reasoning into Insanity we've been caught up into the supernatural they're being caught into insanity is that right and so I'm so thankful for the mind of Christ setting down Among Us I'm Greatful F in this hour we can look at this and we see these things passing by we see them coming by but I'm so grateful for the stability that God brings in a heart and a life that right now there's an anchor that I'm ready to go and I just say to you this morning that what kept pulsating in my heart even on Thursday night if you're not ready make ready to go make ready to go so we want to take this opportunity and just to pull on the gift of God this is this is a service God has allotted for us we want to take the opportunity and we want to receive from the Lord this morning I believe God really has something for us he never brings us together to disappoint us so we want to pull on the gift of God this morning and uh so thankful to have brother Jerry here with us and uh we certainly want him to take his Liberty so maybe as we could stand and we'll change the order of the service amen amen could we sing that um uh amazing grace shall always be my song of Praise can we sing that amen amazing grace shall be my song of praise for it was Grace that on my liy oh I do not know just why he came to love me so but he loves beond thank you Lord oh my fault and he saw my hallelujah oh my let's just raise our hearts to him our voices so I shall pour oh in Thanksgiving thank you Lord my eyes to Cal oh to view the cross when my Jesus died [Applause] me how marous the gra that c my falling yes he beond all our faults and S my name let's just go to him in prayer amen Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for your presence this morning dear father that you've graced us with in this service dear God I pray now Lord as we commit ourselves into your hands for lord your use for your service dear God that we father would just be your microphone dear God but I ask God you'll Lead Me God as I speak from the heart dear God and I pray de God that you will guide me on how to re relate these things there God to be a help to the people and I I pray and I ask it For Your Glory in Christ jesus' name amen amen I'd like you to turn up in your Bibles to Hebrews chap 11 and we're we're we'll read the first six verses of this scripture uh I um I've come through some experience of some things over the past several years quite a few years it it it was something that uh I was faced with in my life that it uh uh it actually took place over a span of years that it just kept continuing and it was a a personal Battle of mine and uh I want to share that with you this morning has a testimony um I I I gave some testimony over different periods to my church at home in that but for a few moments before I do that I I just want to speak to you about faith so uh Hebrews 11 verse1 now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous and God testifying of his gifts and by by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen you may be seated I I start out by saying this uh you know I uh I I moved down to Tennessee and the toward the end of 1998 and started to Pastor the church down there in Dixon Tennessee and uh you know at the time I I really uh uh you know I had a lot of confidence but only in the fact that I I knew God had sent me but I I did feel inadequate in my in my understanding of some things and in my knowledge of things and uh Faith was actually something that uh when it came to certain aspects that I I felt a little inadequate but you know I've been there 25 years and uh you know I had ministered for years before that and had had been here and things but I'll tell you when you got to preach every service service in service out to the same church the same people you know so it isn't like you know evangelizing you might realize this but evangelizing you can actually take a uh they call it a little script bag of of sermons brother brandham did it and and and you can go preach that sermon at this church and then go preach that sermon at this church and then go preach it at that church you know and and of course God will come down the spirit and he'll bring in things you to say here that you didn't say there and and somewhere else that because he tailor it to the people in that but it's it's just how God works through evangelism that but when you're a pastor you know you can't get up and just preach the same set of three or four message five messages over and over and over you know and and you you've got to uh be able to follow the leaders ship of the Lord because you know you're feeding the people and the people have got to grow and they got to mature and and in in their in their walk with the Lord in their understanding of the Lord because it's not that we want to get real smart or be able to be real intellectual excuse me a moment brother Alex is so good to see you you know you know I I enjoy seeing all of you but for many years I used to come up here and when I'd come up I'd see brother Alex and I haven't seen him in so long and and he he's a real good uh dear friend to me so I really love that that brother I got to when I really got to know him and uh we went to a men's uh meetings down in uh Tennessee and and spent some time together and and man he just looked after me and took care of me and everything and it was you know and and I I really got to kind of really spend more time with him and got to know him he's a precious brother he's a dear brother amen and he loves loves The Lord Oh my he he really loves the Lord and he believes with all his heart um you know we and so you know as a pastor the people have got to grow and uh not just in to be intellectual but you got to grow an understanding because as you grow an understanding in Revelation it's really about knowing more about Jesus Christ and actually him becoming more and more a part in your life of what he wants to be and and and that because he he wants to uh that that's one of the things that that God wanted to do you know was actually be magnified in his people that's right and and and and that so uh but so anyway I I I feel like uh that uh I'm not proclaiming that I know everything and all and and I still believe I've got things to learn but I just want to share with you you what I have learned and uh I I I know this that you know the prophet said about faith he said you know like our body is controlled by five senses and some of these things I'm going to say you're familiar with but I'm just going to let the Lord lead me to tie all this in together our body you know is actually controlled by five senses in this world see taste feel uh smell and here and and but now but none of those senses actually declare faith and you know faith brother bam said is a six sense you know and and and I'm going to tell you something science cannot explain Faith science can explain uh the other five senses uh you know of the body and things like that and and and there's things they can explain about the you know the physical makeup and and and of your body and your organs and your brain and all these things and that but they cannot scientifically explain faith and and you know and churches everywhere religions everywhere uh you know uh all the denominations and everything they they they they always want to Proclaim Faith to the people and and and and they bring it in their uh actually many times intellectual conception of what it is and but uh faith is is more than those five senses faith is actually a direct positive that's right you know you can uh realize this that they've actually got medical terms for things that people can actually experience the actual pain of having a heart attack uh they can experience it in their body I've done it myself Pain's going down you know you wake up Pain's shooting down your left arm pains in your chest you go in and everything else they check you out find there's no blockage you're not having a heart attack you know and one of the words they have for many of these things and it works within the body and in the brain and all these the the one term they use is pseudo which uh is it's actually something that mimics it but you actually really feel it you're experiencing it you can feel it you you are experiencing that but it's not real that's good but Faith you can't feel Faith is not excitement you can't feel Faith No but faith is more real than anything that you can contact in your five senses of this body it's a direct positive now Faith is not uh something where you work up to it brother brand said he said you cannot work up Faith amen you you can't work it up by repeating things you can't say well I'm just going to take this frame of mind and I'm I'm going to think this way that's not Faith you know uh maybe the and I know some of these things you can try to point to me to other quotes and things but uh that uh maybe backs what you believe faith is but I'm telling you I've studied through the message I'll use your quotes and all the other ones I found too you know but I'm going to tell you just you say well uh and I know that brother Bram said the doctor says this and and you know but faith can call him a liar and all but this is what I'm saying a lot of people they use actually denial of things to to represent Faith denial is not faith if if the doctor says you've got high blood pressure you know and you say well I'm just not going to accept that you know I I'm going to believe I don't have it I'm just not going to accept that and you go home and every time you check your blood pressure it's high I'm telling you you probably should take some medication before you have a stroke that's right remember this here's a direct quote too brother Venom said God gave doctors and medical science the the knowledge they have to actually help poor suffering Humanity so you're not going to hear me get up here and and tell you don't take an aspirin don't take a Tylenol don't take medication don't go to the doctor because I don't believe that and the prophet didn't teach that that's right that's right that's that's right but I'm also going to tell you don't just rely on medical science you don't have to because we have Divine Healing right that's right the Lord that's right that's right remember when uh sister Bram sister mey had uh that I believe cyst that had come up in that and and and because of and we I don't want to get into all that but you know why she ended up with it was a correction from the Lord and all that but brother Brandon remember what he told her he said you go to the doctor and let the doctor do the test and tell you it's not there that's right he didn't tell her you just go out and don't claim that never told UPS shows up at the door with a package of assist you just saying I ain't accepting that package now don't get me wrong friends but I'm telling you there there are people that approach things with a an intellectual way of faith and that does not move on the word of God that's right that's so good faith is not positive thinking right brother vom say he actually says you want another quote he says it isn't I believe it I think it he says it's I know it right so it it's not and listen I uh uh you know I I spent five years in the service and and one of the you know and it did you know there was a lot of positive things that that came out of my time uh that I believe the Lord used that to work things within me and things molding and developing certain things in that but you know one of the things you know they they teach you I I believe in every branch of the military and that is is actually how to try to overcome things mentally you know that when you you're faced with physical problems you know the first thing is your mental approach to it you know and and and they they will tell you don't think this way think this way you know but I'm telling you that's not how Faith works right amen am brother random says sometimes people come up before me and they're trying to work themselves up into faith and he says I'll notice people come here and some of times they're shaking themselves and saying Oh Glory to God oh glory to God oh glory to God I believe he says that's not Faith he said actually he says that interferes with faith good he says you cannot work yourself up into Faith to believe he actually says faith is not excitement that's right right now there are times and I've witnessed this where people have come to me for prayer and uh they they're getting ready to face an operation and they've come up to me and they say brother Jerry I am just so afraid of anesthesia I have read so much about it people getting going under anesthesia and them not being able to bring them back too and they end up dying and all that and so I don't want to have that surgery I don't want to go under anesthesia and I said well I'm telling you with your approach and the way you're thinking you're going to have to because what what the problem is you're coming up here and you're basing everything on your fear I don't want to do this because I'm afraid so God don't make me have that to have to happen fear is not a basis for faith and I'll tell you this it takes just as much Faith actually more faith to go through the operation than for God to come down and perform a miracle on you brother brandom actually was he there was a man came up before him in in a message 51 where he brother bram's giv a testimony and and the man comes up and brother Bram says you you have kidney problems and he says uh I I I see a doctor standing before you and and he's examining you and you're up for an operation and then I love this part he says but I I feel though you've made preparations for something else and he says you've just been saved too and converted recently because you got on the same suit of clothes you've got on that I've seen you on getting saved GL Hallelujah now you think wow that's great that's wonderful you know he's preparing for something else brother man said you're preparing you know for for the Lord you know a a difference of changed in your life is really what he's saying he says well don't you feel your fear your operation brother Jesus Christ the son of God has made a preparation for you with his blessings may he rest upon you don't fear it brother you're going to be all right now you know the prophet many times he would say you know you've got this and you got that you stand to your feet you no longer got to get off that cot and all this and he tells this brother don't fear just go ahead and have your operation yes sir now you say why are you bringing that out because brother benam what he had to deal with was the man actually reason he come up there is because he had fear so brother Brandon really didn't deal with the operation or or or it was actually kidneys that he had a kidney problem and and brother Brenham didn't actually really deal with that but what but what he dealt with was the the whole problem the man actually had was fear and I've I've seen so many people come for prayer for things and it's really all because they're afraid you know and just forgive me I don't mean to offend anybody but there's sometimes you've got to go through surgery there's sometimes you've got to go through treatment and and and and I'll get to those things in in a little while why the reason why that you have to do that sometimes that's good let me just drop this in you wanted to be Christlike right I'll get to that in a minute well this is the thing look he the the the scripture tells us he is the high priest of our profession and brother Venom says look you testify and you believe it and he says as you testify of your salvation that you got saved he says that works righteousness in your life he said testify of of your healing and that works healing in your life that's right he says you know Paul says hold fast your profession because we've got a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities so hold fast your profession and come boldly to the throne of grace that you might be able to receive help in the time of need you can go to you can go to Jesus you got a problem you got a sickness you got a need I don't care what it is you can go to him the thing about it is Friends he knows your condition and he actually understands you I I want you to get this you've heard it preached probably uh so many years and in all your walking in with the Lord as a chrisan and that but look he came down in flesh to experience what you go through every day in this life so he understands you I've had people so many times think you know they they come to me as a pastor or something you know and they're like well you you just wouldn't understand what I'm going through you don't know what it's like to have actually had a child die wow I said well God is God knows he had a child that died look the Bible tells me friends he understands us that's the whole reason he came down and embodied himself in the likeness of man in the likeness of Flesh was made lower than the angels and and and and God is mindful of him and God is mindful of us [Music] I'm going to tell you something if you got to go talk to God about something you don't got to get you know real Pious and and and real religious and THS and th and all that kind of stuff and and try to impress god with what you uh your spirituality and that just go talk to him yes sir look if you're upset if you're frustrated if if something just got you turned upside down go tell him that's right that's right if somebody has pushed your buttons and got on your last nerves go talk to him about it right that's good yes sir I'll pass this on it is really I just slip it in there I I heard a brother from Ireland preaching one time and he said you know sometimes people complain say the service they preach too long and the service is too long he said I'll tell you what you do the next time you feel that after you leave church go get on your knees and tell God about it just tell him what you're feeling good hold fast your profession it don't matter what what you feel it doesn't matter what is going on it doesn't matter what what the the the it doesn't matter what things are tests and everything else are saying or whatever and that you hold fast don't accept what the devil's got to say about it brother vom actually says when you testify he says don't fuss with the devil about it that's right when the Devil comes to you and tries to get you to doubt and all that he said you say well people want to say no devil I ain't listening to you no devil I believe in quot he says don't do it he says ignore him don't talk to him that's right we how do we hold fast our profession we we have the promises of God the scriptures the the Bible that we believe friends it's more than ink on paper are plenty of religious people that carry around ink on paper that's all it is to them like I'd preached to to my church last Sunday on Easter I said look the thing about it is it's got to come down to more than ink on paper it's got to come down to you being a part in that Resurrection Jesus Christ that you actually not looking back that Jesus Christ arose 2,000 years ago but that there's been a resurrection that's happened in you there has been a new life that's come alive in you you are possessed with the spirit of Goden that's everything you have need of is in you you don't got to look for it friends look it ain't about ink on paper with the Bible it's about that the word of God being wrote in our hearts and coming alive and being manifest and produced through our lives that is is [Applause] faith faith produces the promises to you through [Applause] you Hallelujah and don't limit God to how he he has to work you know sometimes people latch on to one scripture and they they limit God to well this is how you got to work this one scripture I know it says they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover I know it says if there's any sick among you let them call for the Elders of the church and let them come and anoint you with order oil and the prayer of faith shall save the sick but I'm telling you really all it takes for you to be healed is just accept it believe it but not convincing yourself mentally I'm talking about something that happens down in here yes the healing isn't coming from out here somewhere it's coming from in here sir it's in you brother B said you're possessed with it sir that's right brother Samuel quoted as I was walking out you know that everything you have need of including the Rapture is in you when you have the spirit of God when you have the Holy Ghost everything you have need of that means everything you know brother brandom says including the Rapture because people look at that as being such a great mysterious miraculous thing that is going to happen in that but friend so if that's so great mysterious and and miraculous and all that and and it's in us then so is your healing that's right so is friends look you you you think salvation comes from out here somewhere that's good that's so good the author of Salvation is in you Jesus Christ huah and he was made the author of your salvation because of the suffering that he went through in the same kind of body that you walk around in now I want you to realize this brother Adam says God God will actually let his people come down many times to the last minute before he moves on the scene and does something Israel comes out of Egypt they they get down there to the Red Sea brother Adam said it looked like the General Moses had just was a horrible General had led them into a trap Pharaoh's Army came up behind them the people all got scared they're all crying he let it come down to where it would look like okay we're trapped there's no way out of this and brother Ram says God allows those things to happen just so he can come down and show how Supernatural he is show his power and he does something impossible sometimes you know we we actually we've heard it so much and everybody saw the Ten Commandment movie and all these different things and all that and so we kind of just some now got to where we kind of take it for granted but I'm going to tell you something rolling rolling back the Red Sea to them to walk on dry ground that was a big happening I want to tell you something greater than the moon passing in front of the sun yes sir am yes sir and not only that they went through on dry ground Pharaoh said if they can do it I can do it so where it looked like they was in a Trap God just led the devil into a trap God told Moses says I'm going to drown all of them and they'll never be seen [Music] again that's hallu he'll let you come down to the last minute brother Ram says he said look at Shadrach Meshach and abedo yeah yes sir and see manye just put yourself in the situation of those three children those three Hebrew children many of us the way we actually approach things and think and actually even approach our needs in this life today and and things we want from God and that we're thinking God don't let them throw me in that furnace I just believe God's going to allow something to happen and I'm not going to have to go through chemo I'm not going to have to go through this I ain't going to have to have that surgery don't don't let them God's going to do something I'm not going to end up being in that fire look they didn't feel anything they didn't get excited they didn't feel some kind of you know Pentecostal blessing on them sir they didn't all the three of them all start speaking in tongues and things no friends look they said we're putting you in there this is the thing we're going to play this these instruments and when we play them you bow if you don't bow we're putting you in and they said take a minute to consider what you're going to do and he said oh no no King we don't we don't need to take any time to consider this we're not bowing they didn't have to have a conference they didn't have to have a a church vote that's good right get get in hold on we got to get an opinion of everybody here no we ain't doing it we ain't bound they were of one mind and one Accord that's right all three of them know in whom they believed they believed in Jehovah yes and this is what they said friends look now listen to what they said it shows you their faith they said whether he delivers us out of the Flames or not he'll Deliver us out of your hands cuz I'll tell you one thing you want you think about it they look there perhaps and was saying look you you're saying that this is horrible we're going to get burned up and die but man the life we're living under you is really bad so no matter what we're leaving [Applause] here thank you Lord they didn't fear you know why they believed in the resurrection they believed in life they belied there was a better life than this life yes sir amen Lord Brother said look they put him on a death march started marching them down in in there the fire furnace he said God didn't show up they kept getting closer and closer God didn't show up they couldn't feel him they didn't see him nothing was changing he said they got on down there so close he said maybe uh the the men behind them was maybe a Spear's distance behind them driving them in and the Flames were so hot that it killed the men yep that that was forcing them in but they walked on in he said it just goes to show you God was actually with them they might not be able to feel it it might not look like anything was happening but God was with them the way while these other ones was dying from the heat they were marching on in he said and that's how Faith Works that's the way to do it just accept it believe it and keep marching keep walking [Applause] forward yes sir brother gives a dramatization you know he says I can see in heaven perhaps maybe an angel saying God are are you seeing what's going on with your children down here he says oh yes I am if my eyes are upon the sparrow my eyes are upon them he said I see what's happening he said ain't you going to do something just wait they march on down in there friends you know he says he says God says you know what I'm not going to send one of you Angels down there this time he I'm going to I'm going to go down there myself this time Nebuchadnezzar you know he he was actually his hand being forced it wasn't really that he really wanted to do this he was just under political pressure you know and that and so he says look down in there and see what's going on how they're fairing they said did we not cast three men in the fire Glory said yes he said well I see four men down there he said and they're not bound anymore Hallelujah and the walking around down there and the fourth man looks like God hallelujah God showed up the song You sung and he took them through the fire he'll take us through the fire Hallelujah he can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities amen he knows our condition he knows our condition because he came down and walked in our flesh you've heard the saying walk a a mile in a man's shoes Another Man's Shoes to see what they it's like in their life and what they go through well you want to be Christlike he walked in our shoes oh sometimes God allows things to come your way sicknesses and different things for you to go through for you to walk through that so that you can experience that so that he can come through you and be the high priest of people's profession so that he can come through you and minister to people to show them he knows what they're going through and feeling because he's got no mouth other than your mouth no hands other than your hands that's so good abely back in 2011 I went to Costa Rica in March with my father-in-law I came back I went home something very traumatic happened back in diction and that and uh it it caused me such trauma that I actually suffered from PTSD from it and uh I I I actually discovered the body of somebody who had committed suici side that somebody that I was close to dear to me and and and but I was already before that I was already starting to have some something happening to me mentally and and I couldn't understand it and I had already started to where once I got back from Costa Rica that that there was times where I was like trying to escape it and what I I I did was I just go to bed and try to go to sleep so that I didn't have to deal with this conscious mind but but things just kept progressing and getting worse and worse as the years progressed within a a a year's time it had got so bad and I was I was being attacked so much and things you know and and and people say well uh you know there was people that tell me look it's just the devil and and you know and that and I realize the devil can attack you friends but look there's things that can go wrong in your body and I'll tell you this I have found in my experience that sometimes people have an actual stigma about mental health Y come on now you know they can accept somebody having a heart condition they they can accept uh you know sugar diabetes or high blood pressure or even tenser and all these things and that but when somebody starts suffering in mental health you know it's like well whoa now don't you go see a doctor over that don't you go talk to nobody about that yes sir and I didn't know what to do and finally you know my my son uh youngest son uh my son Nate anyway he was getting married and it just caused me to re-experience this PTSD from that from that day during that day and and I was just in a mess but I was trying to cover it up and hide it from everybody and I didn't tell my wife or anybody about it and everything but I was a mess that day and so uh afterwards in that finally I sat down my my daughter uh Jessica is a nurse you know and so I I sat down with her and I sat down with my wife and I started telling them man this is what I'm going through this is what I'm experiencing I said and these are the thoughts and this is everything that's happening at that and so my daughter she says you need to go talk to your doctor so I went and talk to my doctor and and the doctor said you know it was it was actually uh depression but but it wasn't uh you know I had suffered PTSD from this atic experience and things and all that but I was not depressed because of Any outside stressors anything that was going on in my life I actually had some good things going on in my life my son Nate had just got married you know I uh you know and as time progressed you know I uh you know grandchildren started being born there in Dixon I had I had two grandchildren you know out uh uh you know in Utah in that but the other grandchildren started being born around there in Dixon and things you know and and uh uh you know and and I had a lot of happy things going on and and all that or whatever and you know and you could say well just focus on those things just think on that the thing about it was it had nothing to do with my thoughts that's right it was actually I was being struck with an illness and I went to the doctor and they said well you know and I actually found this in the message they said the chemistry of your body's changed and they said you know you you're actually uh you're you're having a something chemical that's going wrong in your brain you know a chemical imbalance and that you know and well I found just the other day in in in the message where brother random was talking about how he was sick with his stomach and and that he was giv testimony of it so he went to the Mayo Clinic and all that and had all these different tests done and everything else and he was talking about how sick he was and how this stuff was coming up in his mouth and how it was making him weak he couldn't hardly get around and he was thinking well I've prayed for people that's far sicker than what I am and they got healed and here I am suffering from this and brother R says and then he says and and I'm suffering mental things he says every seven years I start suffering mental things they say every seven years your body goes through a change and brother randam in that message friends he he he he actually left off from testifying says you know I'm not healed I I will get back to you and let you know how this comes out I uh you know I the doctors gave me medication the it just kept getting worse and worse you know they got a term for it they call it uh clinical depression I think it is you know which which is is not anything you know it's not something that you experience and you say well I got sad about that that's right that's right you know there's you've got no understanding of it and there's you can't say well and I'll tell you before this happened to me I used to try to deal with people and I say don't think that way well I'm going to tell you something it ain't about thinking it has nothing to do with that and so I could not mentally say well what I I'll do is you know I just won't think that way and I I'm just going to claim I'm Healed you know and I'm just not going to accept that or whatever it stayed there because the thing about it it wasn't actually connected to thought right you know look friends when a person gets cancer brother random says a a cell in their body backslides and he says and then a life enters into that you know and then brother B talks about you know casting that demon out and that or whatever but friends it it's and you say well all sickness is of the devil well the thing about it is really the reason you get sick and experience these different diseases and everything it's not really you know you say well it's the devil's fault it's actually Adam and Eve's fault come that's right because they disbelieved one word brother bam says if they're disbelieving one word it's what throwed us all into this it's going to take believing every word to get us out that's right yes sir so sometimes you can get uh hit with afflictions in your body in that and and you think that it was the devil that come and actually attacked you what sometimes happen is your body's failing you you're dying and then the devil sees that happening and so then he comes and starts to adding outside stressors I got high blood pressure you know and there was a time about two couple of years ago or so uh my blood pressure it was kind of hard medication wasn't really working to help me in things and and and that but uh you know some the one doctor I was going to at that time they were saying well it's not too bad you know and and they were just kind of letting it go but I I was having constant pain in my head all the time no type of no no type of Tylenol or anything else would relieve that it was a constant pain that was there you know and I sat on my back porch and I actually you know that doctor uh had gave up the practice so I was having to get a new doctor and that and so I I I made an appointment but it was becoming a new patient so I was having to wait to get in to see this new doctor and in the meantime and that and so uh while I was waiting and I was like I don't know what they're going to have to do I don't know what this pain is and so there was thoughts that would come down now now it's the devil thoughts would come in and say you might have a tumor you might have this you might have that they're probably going to have to do a scan on your head to figure out what's wrong with you it's going to be the first you know this here is December the first of the year is turning over and so you know you're deductible on your insurance and all the stuff you got to meet and everything and all that is going to turn over and start all over again so you got to come up with all this money I went in it turned out just to be blood pressure I didn't have to have any other you know brain scans or anything like that or whatever they they did do some other test to make sure that that that blood pressure running that high for so long hadn't damaged other things other organs and things of our body so they ran some test to see and all them were okay and all that you know and they it took them a while to adjusting medications and things like that you know and it got my blood pressure you know and that pain went away and all that and things you know but my point in saying all that is you know it started and then the devil attacked me right so when I was going through this this mental illness that I had you know the I started going through it and then after that the devil started adding stressors to make it worse there was he he he he worked through other people uh you know even uh some children that we had adopted in that to to bring a an attack and even an attack against the family we actually ended up in court for over a year over one of the attacks you know and it just kept these things it just seemed like it just kept dragging on and on and on 200 19 I came here and I and I preached a service and I entitled the message midnight and and I preached and I didn't preach real long and then we we but we had a lot of prayer for a lot of people afterwards and actually I spent more time up here praying for the people than I'd spent actually preaching and and and that and but there was somebody who came up for prayer you know and and they they were what they described to me they were suffering from the same mental illness that I was suffering from and I prayed for them and God instantly healed them wow they went off of all medication and that and everything came back and gave testimony God had instantly healed them I told my wife I said God I prayed for that person God healed them with the very thing I'm going through and I'm still suffering from it October of that year Samuel and I went to the Philippines we we we spoke at a a youth uh meetings that were there a youth camp we had uh one uh morning we had a a a session of questions and answers for for these young people you know and and these young people I think they actually were all 21 and up I think and uh so there was a a young lady there and she was asking a question you know and and and I found out things more things about it later than that but she was asking a question and it had to do with mental depression and so Samuel was actually standing there when she gave the question well when she gave the question that he turned to me and said why don't you address this one and so you know I I I spoke uh to her and the young people for a minute on that and things you know and and and I said you know you can seek uh medical uh help in that I said but you know but I I don't remember what all I said but I actually gave some some instructions and things that didn't actually have anything to do with uh doctors and medical things and all that and and and and I don't even remember I didn't even remember them what all actually all said to this young lady in that and then uh that was uh those Services ended we we left out of there and uh Sunday morning uh brother roel took Samuel and he took him to a a church to go speak that Sunday morning and uh brother boy that was there who's actually the pastor of the church there now the Overcomer he took me him and his wife and they took me to speak at this little church that was up in this just little village like and I got up there and I I spoke in this little church we actually had a somebody that wanted to get baptized after I preached in that and so then after they done the baptism and that then uh some of them wanted to give testimonies and out of this crowd of people this small church and that out steps that same young lady and she says I was suffering from this these mental things and she said and I was I was ready to take my own life and she said and I asked the question there in the youth Mee she says and brother Jerry spoke and told me what to do and things to do and I did that she says and I'm free hallah now you say why why are you saying things not to not to point at me or lift me up but what I'm saying is brother random said you know somebody would come up to to be prayed for and he said he would see they had no shoes he'd put his foot over by their foot to see if his shoes would fit them he would he would took his shoes off give it to them he he he'd looked at to see if his coat would fit them he would give it to the man brother man says if you want to pray and your prayers be successful he says put yourself in their place and I'm telling you it's nothing of me but what I'm telling you he says let the mind that was in Christ Jesus be in you what does that mean for that to happen friends then that's why God allows you to suffer through things that's why God allows you to go through things in that because that's part heart of the mind that's in Christ Jesus being in you he came down and became us so that he could understand us and he allows us to go through things so that we can do what the prophet said put ourself in their shoes so our prayer for them is successful here I was suffering through these things but because I was suffering through them and and actually been going through them for several years you know here I was able God was able to move through me and actually pray for them and and their faith reach out and them get healed of the very thing I was suffering from God was able to speak through me and actually move to them and then be deliver to the very thing I was suffering from that was 2019 it didn't stop it kept getting worse and worse and worse finally it got to where you know they had increased medication for me and everything else to where medication was no longer working and I'll tell you friends it would get so bad there was times you I would sit around and I would cry and I'd call up the doctor on the phone i' say I'm going to Pieces right now I called my wife up she was working in Nashville and I said I'm going to pieces right now I said I I'm ready to end this I said I just want to be I want to escape this I said I'm experiencing such anxiety right now and that and I don't know what to do you know then that's when the devil would come and add other stressors well you remember what it felt like you know when when you weren't serving God and you used to get drunk why don't you go do that I just said and I'll tell you friends when you get that back you you you you start searching now what am I going to do I just I just want to be I want to be free I just want to escape this and you think well why didn't God do something he just let it keep going on and then last year after I was here in July and then I went back home and I'll tell you during this time there some me lay this in here during that time I got to where I felt like there there was actually a time you might not have knowed about it because there was other things going on down there and things going on here and there was actually a year I think it was 2015 that I didn't even come up here and during that time I I was in such a a mental state in a wreck and everything else I couldn't even preach and then finally I was like well i' got I got to start preaching again I it's been months and I haven't preached I I've got to do this I'm supposed to be Pastor in this church and so I I just I said I'm going to force myself to do it but you know and I know maybe you don't understand completely how all these things work and all that you know but I'll tell you friends look it doesn't matter how much you know as a preacher it doesn't matter how much you've studied you actually got to get inspired ired by the spirit of God yes sir and God can actually in he he will come and Inspire just a thought to you that will take you to a scripture and all this and then like Jesus said when you've got the Holy Ghost he'll bring back to your remembrance whatsoever I've said unto you and then all these things you've read and heard brother Ram said and and and studied on and heard you know good good ministers uh you know real God called Holy Ghost filled ministers of this message preach and and teach under that and and you've got all these things and that when that inspiration comes it just starts drawing from all that there I was I was like I'm not getting no inspiration and I'm not feeling anything and I would get up and preach and and and and and I wasn't feeling the excitement I said something to Samuel about it one of the times he was in the Philippines and he said well I saw you out there you look looked side I didn't tell him but it was an all in Act I'm supposed to act this way so I better act that way and I'll just tell you something you know you you can think what you want about it whatever but friends I was recycling messages and my confidence was blowing and there was times I just felt like I was just getting up and just reading stuff and just just you know just going through things you know but I just kept on pushing but then you know uh from I think it was from uh it started in 2021 things begin to change a little bit you know and uh I I I started changing it started feeling a little different when I was preaching it started feeling a little different to me and and then uh you know uh 2022 uh you know I I started I made some other changes in in in my physical life and things and and so things begin to change in that I went to the doctor I said I got to get off this medication I hate this stuff I feel like it just it masks everything but it's all still there and and and I said I I I just want to to get off of it and so started coming off of it you know under the doctor's guide little by little and little by little and and that and uh you know of course you know and look I'm not trying to Advocate anything but I was exercising and dieting and all these different things and and trying to actually take better care of myself and that you know and things and so I was starting to prove and and as I was going on I was feeling more and more like myself and and I was starting to come more and more off of these different medications and things and that and then uh I preached here uh last year in July I went back home and I started a series of preaching on overcoming and it was because that I had individuals in the church that had come to me with things they were going through and and and battling with and that and and and and and needed help in that and so I felt inspired preach on overcoming and so I I I started through and like pastors do many times you know you God gives you an inspiration you start through it and that and it just keeps building and building and building and before you know it you got part six and part seven and part eight and all this you know and and and things of the thought you know and it just keeps growing and expanding and that's how this did you know and then uh I think uh one of the uh uh uh last messages that I preached on that series I I I gave the I was starting to beginning to feel a whole lot better and I was off of most of all the medication and that and and and I got up and I told the church look you know that I went through these things and everything I said but I'm back that's right that's right and I said I said God has healed me and you know and I gave and and actually that particular service actually they had started singing and the the way they do it at our church I I I don't know exactly why they do all this way but they what they had been doing was just actually kind of recording from the time I got up to speak until I got finish speaking so sometimes when Nate comes up to sing in that there's no more recording that but he' already come up to sing and then after he sung it's when I actually stepped up and gave the testimony there's no record of it and so I gave the testimony in that everything you know and and and it really bless the church mean and I we left we got out we went in the truck and uh I I actually think I had a couple of the grandkids with me I think or something and we were going out to eat and I told my wife I said okay the rest of that medication I'm on I says I'm not taking it anymore well that kind of upset her she was really worried about me and I said no I I've testified God's healed me I ain't doing it so uh the next morning she gets up and you know she gets up about 4:30 in the morning and so she had done some research and things you know before I got up and she said look let me just she just do this let me cuz she she actually divies out all my medicine for me at the beginning of the week thank God for her and she puts it all in these little trays and all I had to do is just at this time take those pills you know and uh I look at them I I couldn't tell you what one pill was from the other really and uh so uh she said let me just start and take what you've got left I think it was actually only one pill one kind of medication I had left said let me just start and I'll just take it away a little time she said till until until you know for a week or so and then then you'll be off it I said okay I thought you know you know she was really upset and I thought okay to satisfy you but I believe I'm Healed but anyway I testified that Sunday I came home that Sund we went out to eat I came home that Sunday evening we got ready to go to bed and I went and I I laid down the bed and I sleep with a CPAP machine and so I put that on and if you what that is you know it's constantly blowing air in your face to keep you breathing you know because it's a condition that some people have that they actually stop breathing while they're sleeping and so uh uh so this air was constantly blowing in my face and I was laying there and it just felt like a heavy weight had come and rested set down on my chest it was was like as if my grandson had come in and climbed up and sat on my chest while I was laying down and I felt like I was suffocating and I could feel that weight was there it was I could feel it and and and and I started panicking and I sat back up in the bed I ripped that mask off and I was gasping for air and I was gasping for air and and and and I sat there a little bit you know and that and my wife was behind she was dozing off and and so then I thought okay I'm feeling better I I'll try this again I'll lay back down I'd lay back down and there it was all again and so this happened several times finally I said me you're going to have to pray for me I said I'm going to tell you what it is I said the devil is attacking me and I said and and and but but but it it feels real I can feel this this is not my imagination and so you know she prayed for me eventually I was able to get a little sleep I got up that that next morning you know and and I went out and that whole week I sat around the house I couldn't do nothing I didn't have any energy for anything and I sat around the house and that weight was on me on my chest like somebody sitting on me all the time and I I was my wife would come out and she would sit down and I was just sitting there gasping for air and it got on in uh to I think Saturday and u i i I was I was sitting there on the couch and and I was you know and I I did I kept telling my wife look I testified and I believe that that God has healed me and I I said and and I said so I I'm not I'm not going to accept this I'm not going to accept any of this but it wasn't changing anything it was still all there so I I text my mom just to ask her hey could you pray for me this is what's happening can you pray for me you know cuz I had actually been texting her a testimony and telling her how God was working on it but here I told her this is what I've been suffering since Sunday night and I said and here it was Saturday and I said and and I said it's not getting any better I said could you just pray for me and so she she went to prayer but then right away she text Samuel and he was actually out of town somewhere uh getting ready to minister uh somewhere and and and that so she text him and and he he texts her back and he says I just read this quote right here and so she quickly forwarded the the quote onto me I think she said she didn't even read the quote she just forwarded on me and read the quote afterwards and and and that and and and this is what it said I I sat down I I got the quote on my phone and I started to read it and and it said and then after I read it on my phone I I jumped up I went and got my laptop I brought it into the living room put it on a tray there in front of the couch and and quickly looked it up so I could look up the whole context of the whole thing what brother random was dealing with and things but this is what he says this is in healing what cancer is he said a woman came here with cancer and all at once something strikes her and she says oh I see it and the Holy Spirit reveals what's wrong with her and tells her what she's done and what she has to do to get rid of everything and then pronounces God blessing upon her and away she goes and she's believing with her heart and she feels good and she goes home and she starts eating she says I'm fine and dandy in a few days she began to get sick and the doctor said uh you need to stay away from that bunch of Fanatics and it says and and but he sent word to her and said it and it's the very best sign in the world that the woman's [Music] healed and when I read that hallu something happened to me so fast it was quicker than thought Glory it wasn't my mind dwelling in thinking on this it wasn't you know there was no time for me to figure this out intellectually or or latch on to it even intellectually there was just something to instantaneously [Music] happened it's the best side in the world you're healed that weight was instantly gone it was a demon it was a spirit it was the devil here's the thing I found out brother Ram said you go testify to something and when you testify of it the devil is sure to come and bring an attack on you and you'll actually be attacked for the testimony you gave that's right that's right that's right and he says and God will actually allow it to happen to see what you're going to do well look it ain't go you friends look it ain't God trying to figure you out it's actually God trying to show you him in [Music] you look Jehovah the whole name of Jehovah is all about God wanting to reveal himself he is he is The God Who reveals himself am and this was just him wanting to reveal himself in me instantly it was gone tears started rolling out of my my eyes I and I just raised my hands I started praising the Lord and I said I'm free I'm free I'm free hallu thank you Lord I was completely healed heed of that mental disease thank you Lord huah sir Hallelujah brother R said you're possessed with something in you that tells you it's so Glory Hallelujah it bypassed my intellect just something anchored what was that it wasn't thought it wasn't positive thinking it wasn't denial that's what faith is it's an unseen thing it's an unfelt thing but it's a real thing it's a thing that moves it's a thing that changes things Faith brings God's promises to manifest in your [Applause] life Glory everything you have need of is in [Music] you Jehovah WRA the Lord Our God that Health all of our diseases yes sir he's not limited just to diabetes and and and and blood pressure and heart and that and and he's not just friends look but uh clinical depression and anxiety and all these other mental diseases and everything he's the Lord Our God that Health all of thy diseases do Humanity suffers from that because of what Adam and evea done right and that's why Jesus Christ came by his stripes I am healed they whipped him and he shed his blood for your healing that's his word that's his promise you don't got to think it you don't got to figure it out all you got to do is just believe it and accept it and walk on say I still feel sick

he had the apron around him was getting ready to shave him and all that you know and that and and and and he said uh can you see he said by his stripes I am healed and up out of that barber chair he came started running down the street because he could see how many days and weeks he went from the time he was prayed for until the time he sat in that barber's chair and God actually healed his eyes and brought sight to it he just kept walking he was just claiming God's promises that that that wasn't mind over matter that wasn't positive thinking that's right Faith ignores what all these other senses tell us I'm still heav heart palpitations I'm still having this and that by his stripes I'm Healed keep going don't doubt Hallelujah listen to this Psalms 23 we're so familiar with this Psalms 23 it says the Lord is my shepherd you know what that that word Shepherd there is is Raha it's one of the Redemptive names of Jehovah Jehovah Raha the Lord Lord is my Jehovah Raha he is my shepherd amen I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou H has prepared a table before me in the presence of my enemies brother bam said sometimes God's got to let us break down a little bit in health so he can give us a little extra attention get us on on his lap to woo Us in his bosom when when the doctor says nothing could be done then he takes us in his bosom and says see I love you I'm going to let you get well he says oh doesn't that make life a little better see he's The Marvelous Shepherd isn't he no wonder David said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he restoreth my soul he leadth Us beside Still Waters my cup runneth over and he anointeth Us in the presence of our enemy and brother B said did you ever get anointed in the presence of your enemy wo Hallelujah I'll tell you what friends that that that Saturday afternoon set in my living room I got anointed in the presence of my enemy but it was wasn't in I'm not talking about an [Applause] excitement I'm talking about the devil couldn't stay there no more I got anointed in his presence and he said I am that demon said I'm out of here let me share this with you you've heard brother brandham say you know he says I've seen in the service he says uh somebody have a demon on them he says and and and he begins to deal with him he says and that demon he says it it will actually come come up and it'll call out to Demons that are on other people for help and he said what it is he said that devil is afraid that person is going to start believing you don't have to fear the devil is afraid you say you say the devil's afraid of God no the devil's afraid you're going to start to believe Hallelujah your faith scares the devil you believing scares the devil that's faith that is actually Supernatural power that is actually being anointed in the presence of your [Applause] enemy the Lord hallelujah hallelujah he said did you ever get anointed in the presence of your enemy and just testify until your cup boil over just how marvelous it is to be anointed in the presence of your enemy hallelujah hallelujah come to the instruments Hallelujah Hallelujah let's sing that song He that they were singing he never promised the cross would not be hard to carry I'm going to tell you friends sometimes youve got to go through suffering we actually are partakers of the suffering of Christ and I'm not talking about you know those people that believe you know well I'll go and I'll kneel down and I'll take a a whip and I'll whip my back so that I can be a partaker and the suffering of Christ no it's things that you're going through in this flesh that's suffering that's how Jesus suffered In the Flesh you're living in and sometimes you know just like God came down to to live in flesh to know how you feel to walk in your shoes so that he could be the high priest of your profession sometimes he lets us walk in shoes that others walk in so that we can have compassion so that we can have understanding so that so that we actually can that God can actually come and reveal himself more to us so that we can share his word with others that are going through the same things in this flesh look brother Samuel look he faces things that I've never faced he's went through things that I've never went through I've went through things he hasn't went through you go through things that we haven't went through and that and but God allows us all to go through different things and that and sometimes those things will cross over and interlap and you and and you could testify of something that you're going through and friends you don't got to wait till you know whe look when God does something for you you testify of it man said the problem is a lot of times people don't want to testify he says God doesn't he says people will get SA then they don't want to testify of it he says if you don't want to testify of it you never really got saved he said because if God's done something in your life you want to tell somebody the angel of the Lord came down and appeared to Mary and said the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you and you're going to conceive and bring forth a child of the Holy Ghost brother Adam said she went around telling people she didn't wait for it to show she didn't didn't wait for a pregnancy test she didn't wait for anything else she went around testified of God's word he said he was going to do this he says when God's done something for you you testify of it yeah you might sometimes testify something and and then have to battle the devil the next week over your testimony just hold fast to your profession hold fast to your testimony don't waver and you don't got to commune with the devil and say devil you're a liar get behind me Satan just ignore him that's right don't argue with him brother benam said just walk on like Shadrach Meshach and Abednego you're going to get burned up keep walking hallelujah hallelujah sometimes he allows us to go through things and suffer things in that it's for we grow out of it our faith grows out of it our our revelation of Jesus in US grows out of it I'm not talking about intellectual growth faith is not intellectual faith in God's word is not intellectual no amen and I'm going to tell you friends you you can't try to make yourself believe but once that has anchored you say look if God can do it for brother Jerry he can do it for me that's right because God don't never change if he brother B says if he ever done something one time for somebody he's obligated to do it again for somebody else when when them conditions are [Music] met Hallelujah I'm not testifying something of my myself I'm testifying to you today of Jesus Christ being alive that's right if the same spirit that raised up Christ from the dead dwells in you it will Quicken your mortal body the quickening is in you hallelujah hallelujah let's sing help me sing

wanted to say my wasn't that wasn't it wonderful What the Lord Has spoke to us this morning um I know when brother Jerry and I had no idea that this was coming this morning but I had told him the other day when uh I had some time that he and I could meet and we had a little little bit and bite to eat together and I began to tell him because I know where where the Lord had brought him from and when he had shared those things uh with me and I told him I said if you whenever you feel led of the lord I want you to come here and I want you to give a testimony on this I said because this is one of those things we need to put right back in the devil's face I I just my heart all of my heart and and it's just those things even when I've had Paul around with me in different meetings God has worked it out with Paul and God would lay it on my heart and I would bring Paul up for the testimony where the Lord had brought him from uh I just think to me in in the mid of it that these are things that how God makes himself known and he just is the same yesterday today and forever I'm so glad for that aren't you amen I'm so thankful for the for the healing touch of the Lord and uh I want to say that uh my even here earlier today uh brother Matthew singing that song and ministering that I looked in there when I got ready to pray before church and I saw him setting up front it blesses my heart seeing these young people set up front I mean it blesses my heart real good and I I see him sitting there taking notes and and in the service too that blesses me so much cuz hey there's a lot of other things that young people could be doing but they want to serve the Lord and I to me it just blesses my heart real real good just to see him getting right in there and and my just Amen in the word of God so I I thank God for every step of the way and I I seen them as as there in times I'm back there I see them raising their hands and I see all of you but man I tell you when I see young people knowing the pressures they're going through in this hour I say boo [Laughter] devil oh my I love it I love it amen you see what God is doing he's the same God and every generation has has a fresh visitation amen so we want to just uh baptize uh sister Brianna here and we're so thankful for the testimony of what the Lord has been doing in her life and then on Thursday we had just a moment back there in the office and she would just get relating to me of you know even in her testimony and where God has brought her to uh you know for her coming into repentance and really just um recognizing her need of the Lord as her Savior and Redeemer and a desire just to walk on with God and I told her right back there I said the same yielding that's taken place the god that led you to repent is the same God that wants to come fully into your life and it's just one little statement that I can make that a applies to all of us the more that we surrender the more God will come in and that's the thing is that God's our desire is God just may you fill her life to a complete complete fullness I've watched I've watched Brianna here over the past years watched her setting in the youth youth meetings there even at our home let alone here in service you know she runs the slides but she's back there taking notes and running slides and the reason I know that is because in our meetings there at the house she's taking notes and and the things that's going on in the youth meetings and then they'll talk about it on the way home so I tell you what the word God is getting his word to his children amen and so I want to say I I thank God for what he's doing in in Sister Brianna's life what he's going doing in every young person in every one of our Lives because God's at work God is at work and though we may not see it here we may not see what God's doing in somebody else's life but rest assured God is working amen and what God does in secret will be rewarded and made manifest

certainly can't brother amen God bless you s sorry the Lord just uh has put it on my heart here just to uh give a little testimony here um a couple weeks ago actually it's been a month and a half or so ago now uh I was at work uh had a little episode um and uh had to leave work and I figured well I better go get checked out um I had shortness of breath and just a lot of things and uh went to the doctor um kind of make a long story short and uh they found um the the doctor sat down with me and said you have uh some damage to your heart uh Eerie IR reversible uh damage to your heart um moderate you know it's it's it's not like super serious it's just a moderate thing um I talked to my at my job I talked to them about it uh the POS position I have is is can be very stressful and so they were just real nice about it and said well uh we'll let you step into another position a lot less stressful and stuff just you know let us know um and and they were just real nice about it and such so I had until this past Monday uh to to let them know and uh so I'd been praying about it and just really going uh back and forth with you know what what to do and just not getting you know the the Thunderbolt leading that I was I was looking for so um but all all last weekend I just uh what what just kept coming back to me was I I know that the Lord led me into this position I I I I know that for a fact you know and he really wasn't leading me anywhere else even though I wasn't getting yes or no I I was not getting you know a leading to go anywhere else so I text emailed my my uh my boss in HR um Monday morning and uh said in in a way kind of apologize said I don't mean to you know be religious or anything but you know the one of my favorite uh verses in the Bible is brother Jerry quoted the Lord is my shepherd and I just told him he led me into this position and I'm not going to let fear lead me out of this position and so um that's what I wanted to uh you know share with you how you know sometimes it just came up came about in the in in the service today is is you know it's sometimes is fear or or other other things that can be U motivators and such and God brings these
