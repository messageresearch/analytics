[48:17] you'll bring deliverance to that heart
[48:19] I'm asking you'll set the captive free
[48:22] Oh God I'm asking God for every hole
[48:26] that's upon that life it'll be broken
[48:28] Lord God and that heart Lord will be so
[48:31] completely turned to you O God that it
[48:34] will seek Lord Jesus for that reality of
[48:39] Oh God
[48:43] Granite Lord you're no respecter of
[48:46] distance so we ask these things now Lord
[48:53] in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen
[49:04] god bless you this morning so good to be
[49:08] in the house of the Lord isn't it we
[49:13] want to turn into Bibles our Bibles this
[49:15] morning to proverbs chapter 18
[49:30] so appreciated the song service and the
[49:34] warship
[49:36] mr. Bethany and God bless you good to
[49:38] have you here
[49:43] you didn't need any help with that song
[49:45] by the way
[49:48] you did a fine job brother Brian
[49:51] proverbs 18 verse 10
[49:55] amen the name of the Lord is a strong
[50:00] tower the righteous run us into it and
[50:07] is safe I want to read that scripture
[50:12] again the name of the Lord is a strong
[50:18] tower
[50:21] what is his name it's his word revealed
[50:27] his life the name of the Lord is a
[50:30] strong tower noticed it's a raised
[50:33] position the righteous run into it and
[50:40] is safe
[50:45] glory be to God amen will you read one
[50:48] more place with me in isaiah 32 verse 1
[51:06] this is behold a king shall reign in
[51:10] righteousness and princes shall rule in
[51:16] judgment and a man shall be as an hiding
[51:21] place from the wind and a covert from
[51:27] the tempest as rivers of water in a dry
[51:33] place as the shadow of a great rock in a
[51:39] weary land how many know that the Lord
[51:44] Jesus is all of that he's provided that
[51:50] for everyone amen
[51:55] a man shall be as a hiding place from
[51:59] the wind and a covert from the tempest
[52:01] as rivers of water in a dry place as the
[52:05] shadow of a great rock and a weary land
[52:08] when I read that it speaks of conditions
[52:11] that are not ideal conditions but we've
[52:17] got a place we've got an escape a place
[52:21] where we can go in the midst of all
[52:26] these conditions wind's blowing
[52:31] winds are blowing people standing here
[52:34] now they're standing over here now
[52:36] they're standing back here enough but
[52:39] you know to a believer when they're in
[52:41] this place the winds come up here the
[52:44] winds will buy us over here
[52:47] the Alice over here bow us over here but
[52:50] you know only thing that wind does is it
[52:54] loosens up it causes the roots to get
[52:58] down a little deeper storms come sure
[53:04] they come dry times come but in him we
[53:10] have refreshing a great Rock noticed the
[53:14] scripture a great rock in a weary land
[53:18] the prophet of God would pick this
[53:21] scripture up and say a weary land he
[53:24] said people talk about America all this
[53:26] is land of joy and happiness he said but
[53:29] if you only seen the judgment that's
[53:31] upon it it's a weary land but I'm glad
[53:37] we've got a great Rock a great rock in a
[53:41] weary land amen god bless you this
[53:45] morning as you're being seated I want to
[53:48] continue to look at that if the Lord
[53:50] will help us on being under his care and
[53:53] I think if there's one great thing as
[53:57] even the songs that were sung here this
[54:00] morning that would come and everything
[54:02] moving into that place we see God's
[54:05] faithfulness of how that he's watched
[54:07] over us the same God that has watched
[54:10] over us is the same God who is watching
[54:12] over us and he will watch over us all
[54:15] the way through
[54:17] this speaks of a hiding place where
[54:19] we're reading from here and the
[54:21] scripture it does not in any way portray
[54:25] that as believers that we would be
[54:28] exempt from conditions coming about as a
[54:33] matter of fact in the book of psalms
[54:35] psalms 27 it speaks that in the time of
[54:39] trouble and that's the very chapter the
[54:42] very chapter you know that brother
[54:44] Branham would take four and preach the
[54:46] message the rapture and he would use
[54:49] that that chapter for a background a
[54:52] setting to get and get a perspective of
[54:56] what the conditions are that are going
[54:58] on this the age that we are living in
[55:03] and the times that we're living in it's
[55:05] a time of trouble
[55:07] and I think it's just continuing
[55:10] everything is just continuing to build
[55:12] up we don't know how much longer that we
[55:16] are to be here but one thing that we do
[55:19] know for sure that God is not going
[55:24] anywhere
[55:24] without us and we recognize that the
[55:29] reason that there are limitations to how
[55:32] far that Satan can encroach right now
[55:36] and that's because of the Holy Spirit in
[55:40] the bride body is present upon this
[55:44] earth the scripture says that he in the
[55:46] book of second Thessalonians he that
[55:49] will let he let us until he be taken out
[55:52] of the way it's the Holy Spirit that
[55:55] working in hearts that are yielded to
[55:57] God that's still keeping this whole
[55:59] thing together
[56:01] as soon as as soon as it's taken up the
[56:05] chaos that we have seen in a minor
[56:07] measure I thought my plagues and
[56:09] everything else in a minor it's a minor
[56:11] measure compared to what it's going to
[56:13] be but no matter what conditions come
[56:17] about this is a promise we have that
[56:21] he's our hiding place he is our strong
[56:24] tower and I want to just look at this
[56:26] this tower and being under his care in
[56:29] Joshua chapter 20 verse 1 the Bible says
[56:34] the Lord's also spake unto Joshua saying
[56:37] speak to the children of Israel saying a
[56:39] point out for you cities of refuge where
[56:43] of I spake unto you by the hand of Moses
[56:46] that the Slayer that killeth any person
[56:49] unawares and unwittingly may flee
[56:53] thither and they shall be your refuge
[56:56] from the Avenger of blood so God has
[57:00] appointed to them that they would have
[57:03] cities in their land that would be
[57:06] cities of refuge and when he does flee
[57:11] into one of these cities and shall stand
[57:14] at the entering of the gate of the city
[57:16] and shall declare his cause in the ears
[57:20] of the elders of that city and I want
[57:22] you to catch this he cannot just simply
[57:25] walk into that city there is someone to
[57:29] meet him there it says that there shall
[57:31] be the elders of the city will meet him
[57:34] at the gate and he has to declare his
[57:37] calls
[57:38] why is he seeking entry into this city
[57:42] of refuge in other words a complete full
[57:46] confession complete full repentance they
[57:53] shall take him into the city unto them
[57:56] and give him a place that he may dwell
[57:59] among them and if the Avenger of blood
[58:03] pursue after him then they shall not
[58:06] deliver the Slayer up into his hand
[58:08] because he smote his neighbor
[58:11] unwittingly and hated him not before
[58:14] time
[58:15] and he shall dwell in that city until he
[58:18] stand before the congregation for
[58:20] judgment and until the death of the high
[58:23] priest that shall be in those days then
[58:26] shall the Slayer return and come in unto
[58:29] his own city and unto his own house unto
[58:31] the city from whence he fled now I want
[58:35] you to think of this here brother Bram
[58:36] says it like this he says now a man
[58:38] coming to this place of refuge when he
[58:41] comes in there first he must want to
[58:44] come in
[58:45] he must desire to escape the wrath
[58:50] that's pressing to him he's got to want
[58:53] to do it so this is not something where
[58:56] a person is drug into it but rather they
[59:00] are under a pressure and when we look at
[59:05] this it says unwittingly unknowingly
[59:06] it's speaking of a person where let's
[59:10] say as they were maybe out cutting wood
[59:12] with an axe and they're chopping the axe
[59:14] and the axe head flies off or the axe
[59:17] flies whatever and it's mites and it
[59:20] kills a person it was that which when it
[59:24] was done that person could look and say
[59:26] I didn't mean to do that and there is a
[59:29] place provided for them that the Slayer
[59:33] that of the family and those that would
[59:35] seek the blood of this individual there
[59:38] is a place they can go where true
[59:42] judgment can be rendered because outside
[59:45] of that city it only becomes a debate a
[59:48] reasoning well I didn't mean to do this
[59:50] you know I never meant to do that
[59:53] but if they can make it to the City of
[59:55] Refuge and plead their case then there's
[59:59] one that'll meet them at the gate bring
[1:00:01] them into that city and then when they
[1:00:03] stand the judgment there before that
[1:00:06] congregation there's a judge that
[1:00:09] becomes their attorney and is able to
[1:00:11] plead their cause there's a high priest
[1:00:14] who's there and is able to declare
[1:00:17] though they are guilty it's true this
[1:00:20] one will slip but we are here to remove
[1:00:23] the
[1:00:24] guilt and reveal the true innocence this
[1:00:29] is why Jesus said in Matthew 11:28 come
[1:00:34] unto me all ye that labor and are heavy
[1:00:36] laden and I will give you rest notice
[1:00:40] and nothing else outside of a person of
[1:00:43] Jesus Christ will ever give you rest
[1:00:48] Alleluia take my yoke look at this take
[1:00:51] my yoke upon you and learn of me for I
[1:00:55] am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall
[1:00:57] find rest unto your souls for my yoke is
[1:01:02] easy and my burden is light hallelujah
[1:01:08] you know in reality a dispositive for a
[1:01:12] moment it's harder for a drunk to be a
[1:01:16] drunk than it is for me to serve God
[1:01:20] because a drunkard he wants to be free
[1:01:24] of that liquor but then he'll go and do
[1:01:28] it on the Thursday night or the Friday
[1:01:30] night or the senator he goes again doing
[1:01:32] he's in bondage he's doing something
[1:01:34] then he doesn't want to do but when a
[1:01:36] Christian is really a believer has
[1:01:39] really confessed their sins and they've
[1:01:42] been set free and those those of that
[1:01:46] sin death the reality of it is released
[1:01:48] on that life they are free it's not a
[1:01:51] chore to live for the Lord it's the
[1:01:55] greatest privilege the greatest honor
[1:01:57] that a mortal could have to serve the
[1:02:01] Lord Jesus the remm says I believe that
[1:02:05] a man coming to Christ and Christ is our
[1:02:08] refuge that's the New Testament refuge
[1:02:10] is Christ now a man coming to this
[1:02:13] refuge must want to come and he must
[1:02:19] remember another thing he's got to stay
[1:02:22] there
[1:02:22] he can't just run in till the pursuers
[1:02:25] get by and then go out again he's got to
[1:02:29] be satisfied not just enough to say I
[1:02:34] feel a little bit better so many times
[1:02:36] where it's it stopped is where a person
[1:02:39] can feel a little better they'll feel
[1:02:41] how I've been forgiven they feel a
[1:02:43] little bit of a lift but go until you're
[1:02:47] completely satisfied where there's no
[1:02:51] other longing in your life you have
[1:02:54] found him the pearl of great price you
[1:03:00] see God's a gentleman he won't encroach
[1:03:03] on you he comes where he's invited real
[1:03:09] repentance the presence of God is there
[1:03:12] to guide that and it welcomes him to
[1:03:15] move further
[1:03:16] you just can't run until the pursuers
[1:03:18] get by and then go out again he's got to
[1:03:21] be satisfied listen this
[1:03:22] yep believe if a man with his right mind
[1:03:25] could see that the net thing that the
[1:03:28] death was galloping behind him and the
[1:03:31] devil's hell he's going to and could
[1:03:33] find a place of refuge and then want to
[1:03:36] go out again there's something wrong
[1:03:38] with that man as long as he's in the
[1:03:42] refuge he's safe if he ever goes out
[1:03:46] again he's subject to his Slayers let me
[1:03:50] just say this this is why it's not
[1:03:53] enough just to come to a church you need
[1:03:57] to come you need to hear the word but
[1:03:59] you need to commit your life fully to
[1:04:02] God God cannot move unless there's
[1:04:06] genuine repentance you might say I need
[1:04:08] healing in my body but if there's sin
[1:04:10] laying that he will not move over that
[1:04:11] said you've got to fully repent there's
[1:04:17] got to be full confession in order for
[1:04:20] the comforter to come so when we say
[1:04:23] this it's not just enough to be around
[1:04:26] and I just want to be very intentional
[1:04:28] it's not just enough to be acquainted
[1:04:31] with this message you've got to be one
[1:04:33] with the author himself this message has
[1:04:38] come to reveal to us the City of Refuge
[1:04:42] a place that we can go to in the midst
[1:04:46] of a troublesome time in the midst of a
[1:04:49] weary land in the midst of a dryness in
[1:04:52] the midst of a famine there is a place
[1:04:55] that is revealed to you and I that you
[1:04:59] can be safe if he ever goes out again
[1:05:07] he's subject to his layers and in Christ
[1:05:11] we have a refuge and are secured then we
[1:05:17] have safety from the wrath of God and
[1:05:19] the wrath of hell that's coming upon us
[1:05:23] now I want to look at this confidence
[1:05:26] before we move a little bit further here
[1:05:28] this morning
[1:05:30] you see the scripture says in Hebrews
[1:05:34] 6:17 God willing more abundantly to show
[1:05:38] unto the heirs of promise the
[1:05:42] immutability of his counsel confirmed it
[1:05:45] by an oath
[1:05:46] who's he declaring thus to the heirs
[1:05:50] that by two immutable things in which it
[1:05:53] was impossible for God to lie we might
[1:05:58] have a strong consolation who have fled
[1:06:02] for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set
[1:06:06] before us which hope we have as an
[1:06:09] anchor of the soul both sure and
[1:06:13] steadfast and which in earth into that
[1:06:17] within the veil in other words it's just
[1:06:19] like the little boy who had the string
[1:06:22] and the kite and the kite was up above
[1:06:25] the clouds and here he is with the
[1:06:27] string and the man walks by and says
[1:06:29] what are you doing
[1:06:30] he says I'm flying a kite and the man
[1:06:32] says I don't see a kite
[1:06:34] he said I don't know he says it's up
[1:06:35] there he said you just can't see it the
[1:06:38] clouds are covering it up he said well
[1:06:40] how do you know it's up there he said
[1:06:41] because every once in a while I feel a
[1:06:44] little tug on that line hallelujah we
[1:06:49] have an anchor brother and there's a God
[1:06:52] it's not a poopy knee it is a fool from
[1:06:55] above amen we have been tied back in
[1:06:59] there was a breach in our life but the
[1:07:02] Holy Ghost has spanned the bridge and
[1:07:05] has tied us back in to Jesus Christ
[1:07:09] hallelujah is the abstract to the title
[1:07:12] deed we have an anchor I'll share it
[1:07:16] times out here you know it may seem like
[1:07:18] Airy emotions a reminder this or that
[1:07:21] but we got a stabilizer we're connected
[1:07:25] to the unseen realm hallelujah whether
[1:07:29] the forerunner is for us entered even
[1:07:32] Jesus made a high priest forever after
[1:07:35] the order of melchizedek just think of
[1:07:39] this
[1:07:41] here the man running for his life
[1:07:46] he's running he's there's been a man
[1:07:50] that's been killed somebody's died this
[1:07:55] man would come to this place of refuge a
[1:07:59] strong tower he would come to this place
[1:08:03] because he knew this is the only place
[1:08:05] this is the only place I can get to it's
[1:08:09] the only it's the only choice I have
[1:08:11] it's not it's not optional this is my
[1:08:14] only choice and he's coming to this city
[1:08:19] of refuge do you recognize it requires
[1:08:21] faith faith cometh by hearing and
[1:08:24] hearing by the word so he's coming to
[1:08:28] this place now when he stands there then
[1:08:31] the elder that hid that that receives
[1:08:33] them into the gate and his confession
[1:08:35] the man is guilty
[1:08:37] he's killed somebody else but only in
[1:08:41] this place with those that are presence
[1:08:45] can his innocence be revealed don't you
[1:08:49] recognize that when God takes a hold of
[1:08:52] a life that can be bound with sin and
[1:08:54] maybe you do look at sin and sometimes
[1:08:56] we think just drinking smoking and
[1:08:58] running around but the greatest sin and
[1:09:00] the only sin there is is unbelief they
[1:09:03] meant sin is unbelief and so within that
[1:09:08] man could come into that place but as
[1:09:10] soon as as repentance has come he's
[1:09:14] taken into that city brother
[1:09:16] he moves into that place of refuge I'm
[1:09:19] telling you there's a new man a new
[1:09:21] woman that raises up on the inside that
[1:09:24] says I don't even know that person who
[1:09:27] was in the past there's a new creation
[1:09:29] in Christ Jesus what is it
[1:09:31] it's that seed churn it was never never
[1:09:34] you that did it in the first place
[1:09:36] that's real truth justification that's
[1:09:39] real innocency and the only one that can
[1:09:42] raise that kind of an innocence E is the
[1:09:44] one who gave an innocent life
[1:09:47] and sit back the holy goes to come down
[1:09:51] and say I declared you innocent
[1:09:54] the first nature guilty that's why we've
[1:09:59] got to be born again hallelujah
[1:10:07] Romans they want there is therefore now
[1:10:10] no condemnation to them which are in
[1:10:14] Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[1:10:17] flesh but after the spirit for the law
[1:10:21] of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus
[1:10:23] hath made me free from the law of sin
[1:10:27] and death you're here this morning you
[1:10:31] don't recognize it let me just tell you
[1:10:33] Johnny crow
[1:10:33] you've already been set free all you
[1:10:37] gotta do is look let the word direct you
[1:10:40] that you have been set free like that
[1:10:43] old crows trained up he would walk that
[1:10:45] fence line eventually somebody came and
[1:10:47] they released that hold upon his leg but
[1:10:50] he kept on walking the same way he kept
[1:10:54] walking the same way why he had got used
[1:10:57] to that bondage come on rich women now
[1:11:01] he got used to walk in that same way but
[1:11:04] finally somebody cared enough to come
[1:11:07] back and let him know you're free you're
[1:11:11] free you're not chained down any longer
[1:11:15] and that's what the only goes through
[1:11:18] the revealed word of the hour it lets
[1:11:20] you and I know as the lamb is standing
[1:11:23] in power and authority you are free whoo
[1:11:32] you're loosed first John 4:17
[1:11:38] herein is our love made perfect that we
[1:11:42] may have boldness or confidence in the
[1:11:45] Day of Judgment because as he is so are
[1:11:49] we in this world
[1:11:53] you might say brother Samuel he was
[1:11:55] tempted to sin but he never sinned
[1:11:57] that's right but when that life has come
[1:12:02] upon you and it raises you up it
[1:12:06] declares the innocency of a son and
[1:12:08] daughter of God and if you do happen to
[1:12:11] fall short guess what he's there to
[1:12:13] convict you and lead you right back in
[1:12:15] are you with me now oh my because as he
[1:12:20] is you see as he is if we are covered
[1:12:23] with his blood he's not seeing us when
[1:12:26] we're under the blood he's not looking
[1:12:28] at us it's not our righteousness
[1:12:31] it's his righteousness the Bible said
[1:12:34] Abel in the book of other Hebrews
[1:12:36] chapter 11 that Abel offered a more
[1:12:39] excellent sacrifice by which he obtained
[1:12:43] a witness that he was righteous it was
[1:12:46] not able it was the sacrifice that was
[1:12:50] revealed to him that released to him
[1:12:53] righteousness in the eyes of God and he
[1:12:59] had that assurance it's not me that
[1:13:03] liveth but Christ that liveth in me
[1:13:07] there's no fear in love but perfect love
[1:13:13] casteth out fear because fear hath
[1:13:19] torment he that feareth is not made
[1:13:25] perfect in love
[1:13:29] fear can come but you've got authority
[1:13:32] to cast it out there God's army is
[1:13:37] commissioned to do just what he did in
[1:13:40] heaven and that was when Satan raised up
[1:13:44] against God he cast him out are you with
[1:13:50] me
[1:13:50] that's the way that his believers he
[1:13:54] said in my name they shall cast out evil
[1:13:57] spirits it's casting out by the word so
[1:14:02] it's knowing that that word is in you
[1:14:05] and you are in it and you stand upon
[1:14:07] that word and cast Satan out but the
[1:14:13] Branham takes I love this reference here
[1:14:18] when brother Branham came down with the
[1:14:21] ameba
[1:14:27] remember being over there in South
[1:14:31] Africa you let men set his itinerary you
[1:14:39] really can't blame you who wants the
[1:14:40] pressure of setting that it's enough to
[1:14:43] preach the meetings without trying to
[1:14:45] set your itinerary but God was moving in
[1:14:51] a certain area
[1:14:52] and the men who set the itinerary said
[1:14:57] we got to move from here to go here and
[1:15:00] the Holy Spirit speaking to the Prophet
[1:15:03] it says no no where to stay here
[1:15:06] pressure came pressure came and with all
[1:15:13] the men he's another brand new hiring
[1:15:15] interns - there's you familiar with it
[1:15:17] he turns to brother Bosworth and he but
[1:15:19] the bram says they're in the message you
[1:15:21] too
[1:15:24] you to see sometimes pressure comes from
[1:15:28] unexpected places God allows us to be
[1:15:34] tested now God allowed the Prophet to go
[1:15:38] ahead he says with that right there go
[1:15:40] ahead and go he said but you all pay for
[1:15:42] it
[1:15:42] it did not listen to me now it did not
[1:15:46] change his status as a son of God he
[1:15:50] didn't lose the Holy Ghost come on now
[1:15:52] he was just gonna get corrected but God
[1:15:58] now notice this here brother Graham
[1:16:00] comes and for six months after he comes
[1:16:02] back you know he's dealing with that
[1:16:03] amoeba case that parasite that's in his
[1:16:08] body
[1:16:10] a long time that's a long time six
[1:16:13] months to have to deal with something is
[1:16:16] that right
[1:16:16] I know sometimes an hour seems like a
[1:16:18] long time we're talking six months Pacey
[1:16:22] can't eat hardly can't sleep his brother
[1:16:25] Ben goes on to tell us this for six
[1:16:27] months and here in one morning how that
[1:16:31] the Holy Spirit comes to him and says as
[1:16:34] brother Branham is thinking in his mind
[1:16:36] what will my future be what will the
[1:16:40] outcome of this be
[1:16:42] you see God didn't let him know what the
[1:16:45] outcome was gonna be he was having to
[1:16:48] trust God and hear the Holy Spirit and
[1:16:52] look comes to him as he walks up and he
[1:16:55] says as thou was thinking of what would
[1:16:57] be your future he said yes he said he
[1:17:01] reached over and grabbed a piece of
[1:17:02] paper like typewriter paper and he said
[1:17:06] he stood beside me and he swirled them
[1:17:09] like that now I know one thing I know is
[1:17:11] that if you grab a piece of paper and
[1:17:13] you swirl them either there's multiple
[1:17:15] pieces of paper or one paper has been
[1:17:18] shredded whatever it is everything that
[1:17:22] was there on that paper was getting
[1:17:25] ready to be dispersed he took that paper
[1:17:29] here as he stands there the angel the
[1:17:31] Lord he takes that paper and he throws
[1:17:33] that paper up in the air and he
[1:17:36] announces to the Prophet your future is
[1:17:39] clear what he had a question on his
[1:17:44] heart what's gonna be the outcome
[1:17:47] hallelujah God came down and let him
[1:17:51] know this is what your future is gonna
[1:17:54] be like your future is clear let me just
[1:17:57] say to you this morning you've got a
[1:17:59] clear future ahead of you
[1:18:03] you've got a clear future the Word of
[1:18:06] God has come to declare to you and I as
[1:18:09] sons and daughters of God your future is
[1:18:13] clear a man when you move be under the
[1:18:18] blood I don't care what comes your
[1:18:20] future is clear he said you've been
[1:18:24] fearing that amoeba condition
[1:18:26] I said yeah will it ever leave me will
[1:18:31] it will it bother me anymore
[1:18:33] he said never no more when God does
[1:18:40] something he does it well first John 3:1
[1:18:45] behold what manner of love the father
[1:18:47] had bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:18:50] called the sons of God therefore the
[1:18:53] world knoweth us not because it knew him
[1:18:56] not beloved now are we the sons of God
[1:19:00] and it definitely appear what we shall
[1:19:03] be but we now look at this we know that
[1:19:08] when he shall appear we shall be like
[1:19:12] him for we shall see him as he is
[1:19:18] this revelation by the Holy Ghost we see
[1:19:23] you see when you come to this this tower
[1:19:26] you run into this tower notice the
[1:19:29] righteous run into it your I would have
[1:19:32] never called ourselves righteous but
[1:19:34] remember he saw you afar off he knew us
[1:19:39] before the foundation of the world
[1:19:42] what was he speaking about - that seed
[1:19:46] that lay beneath that darkness that's
[1:19:50] what he was speaking - he was not going
[1:19:53] to try to revive our old character or
[1:19:56] patch up our own nature he says there's
[1:20:00] one answer one remedy for that and that
[1:20:04] is that light would come and the light
[1:20:07] will disperse the darkness it'll cause
[1:20:10] that seed on the inside to rise up under
[1:20:15] the warming rays of the som what was
[1:20:21] dormant now arises and shines
[1:20:30] is a strong tower it's an elevated place
[1:20:38] it's no way and you and I could get into
[1:20:40] these heavenly places on our own there's
[1:20:44] no way that we could set ourselves on
[1:20:46] the rock like Moses we didn't know there
[1:20:50] was a place beside him on the rock he
[1:20:52] told us where the place was he has taken
[1:20:56] me in the secret of his tabernacle he
[1:20:58] has hidden me in his pavilion he have
[1:21:01] placed me upon a rock we could not get
[1:21:04] there of our own strength but just
[1:21:06] coming to the gate all you gotta do is
[1:21:08] come to the gate
[1:21:10] I'm the one that meets you at the gate
[1:21:15] who has a testimony of taken lives that
[1:21:20] are shattered that are found that look
[1:21:23] helpeth but he has a testimony he's got
[1:21:27] a reputation for taking the worst and
[1:21:31] transforming their lives his reputation
[1:21:36] is made on lives like that
[1:21:45] lives that were so rotten the devil said
[1:21:49] I don't even want to know more Jesus
[1:21:54] said I'll take them I'll take them no
[1:22:02] Lord if they come into your city they'll
[1:22:04] pollute it oh no you don't understand
[1:22:05] there's a fountain open in the house of
[1:22:08] David it's a better cleanse I'm able to
[1:22:11] set it free it's able to reveal who they
[1:22:14] really are
[1:22:15] huh glory be to God and because your
[1:22:20] sons Galatians 4:6 God has sent forth
[1:22:23] the spirit of his son into your hearts
[1:22:25] crying Abba Father wherefore thou art no
[1:22:31] more a servant
[1:22:37] remember servant don't know what his
[1:22:39] Lord doeth but a son and if a son then
[1:22:47] an heir of God through Christ now let's
[1:22:53] draw on this a little bit I know the
[1:22:56] scriptures are familiar to you but this
[1:22:58] is what we're drawing with remember
[1:22:59] we're in the land we're not exempt from
[1:23:02] conditions being and being around us but
[1:23:05] there's got to be a place where you know
[1:23:07] where you're standing when everything
[1:23:10] else is shaking all around you you got
[1:23:12] to know where you're standing when
[1:23:14] pressure comes up in your life you got
[1:23:16] to know where you're standing
[1:23:19] hey man in Romans 8:29 for whom he did
[1:23:23] foreknow he also did predestinate to be
[1:23:26] conformed to the image of his son that
[1:23:28] he might be the firstborn among many
[1:23:30] brethren
[1:23:32] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:23:35] he also called and whom he called them
[1:23:39] he also justified and whom he justified
[1:23:42] them he also glorified he sees you this
[1:23:49] is direct words from the prophet of God
[1:23:51] he sees you and I as a finished product
[1:24:00] hallelujah sometimes it's hard to see
[1:24:04] how far you've come
[1:24:05] but in that strong tower you're able to
[1:24:08] look back and say whew I've come
[1:24:11] somewhere I've come somewhere I was down
[1:24:15] there in the muck come on somebody
[1:24:18] I was beneath the muck and the Gulf all
[1:24:21] the dirt that was packed into me but
[1:24:23] light has come to raise me up in
[1:24:26] overcoming power it has raised me up Oh
[1:24:34] glory be to God God's grace has raised
[1:24:37] us above the multitudes and thickness of
[1:24:40] people what shall we say then to these
[1:24:43] things
[1:24:45] if God be for us who can be against us
[1:24:53] these aren't just words these are
[1:24:59] scriptures that win
[1:25:01] everything's breaking loose all around
[1:25:03] you you can apply this Scripture seems
[1:25:07] like family's coming against your bosses
[1:25:09] coming against your what I'm right
[1:25:11] here's a scripture if God is for me then
[1:25:16] who can be against me Enoch spared not
[1:25:22] his own son but delivered him up for us
[1:25:24] all how shall he not with him also
[1:25:27] freely give us all things who shall lay
[1:25:31] anything to the charge of God's elect it
[1:25:33] is God that justifies who is he that
[1:25:37] condemneth it is Christ that died yay
[1:25:42] rather that is risen again who is even
[1:25:44] at the right hand of God who also maketh
[1:25:47] intercession for us who shall separate
[1:25:50] us from the love of Christ you and God
[1:25:52] asks the question he really want you to
[1:25:54] answer it
[1:25:55] he's one less to consider who can't
[1:26:00] stand before him the devil's more than a
[1:26:05] match for any of us in the flesh but
[1:26:08] he's not more than a match for the Holy
[1:26:11] Ghost
[1:26:11] [Music]
[1:26:12] [Applause]
[1:26:15] he's not more than a match for God who
[1:26:21] shall separate us from the love of
[1:26:23] Christ notice not what who who's behind
[1:26:27] it shall tribulation shall distress
[1:26:32] persecution famine nakedness pearl sword
[1:26:36] see all these conditions all these
[1:26:39] conditions that are all-around
[1:26:40] conditions that we are exposed to and
[1:26:44] what does it do it proves the strength
[1:26:46] of the love of God ain't Curt in our
[1:26:50] lives and we are anchored to him as it's
[1:26:53] written for that sake we are killed all
[1:26:55] the day long we are accounted as sheep
[1:26:57] for the slaughter but may in all these
[1:27:02] things we are more than conquerors
[1:27:06] through him that loved us not survivors
[1:27:13] more than conquerors for I am persuaded
[1:27:19] that neither death nor life nor Angels
[1:27:23] nor principalities nor powers nor things
[1:27:26] present nor things to come nor height
[1:27:28] nor depth nor any other creature shall
[1:27:31] be able to separate us from the love of
[1:27:33] God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord
[1:27:39] I really don't like Heights I know it's
[1:27:44] not real spiritual but I really don't
[1:27:47] like Heights but I will get up in a deer
[1:27:52] stand but I really don't like even
[1:27:55] though I know it's better to be higher
[1:27:56] up I really don't like to get on tall
[1:28:03] ladders but right now I'm on the safest
[1:28:09] ladder there is this this ladder has got
[1:28:15] angels ascending and descending
[1:28:19] it's got angels that will come and
[1:28:21] prepare cakes for you
[1:28:23] it's got angels that will come with the
[1:28:26] tester trial and the testers in that
[1:28:29] they'll come in minister strength - yeah
[1:28:32] amen there's angels they're watching
[1:28:35] over us so I don't mind these Heights
[1:28:39] this strong tower these heavenly places
[1:28:43] I don't mind them Jesus said my peace I
[1:28:47] give to you my peace I give to you where
[1:28:51] his peace arise from he knew who he was
[1:28:56] he knew who his father was he knew where
[1:29:01] he was in the word the word was alive to
[1:29:04] him see it was not a piece like the
[1:29:06] world gives the world gives a piece and
[1:29:08] says you may get a bump in your salary
[1:29:11] huh your 401k whatever it is Z or P
[1:29:15] whatever it might go up your retirement
[1:29:17] or well your this or you know or your
[1:29:19] insurance rates your insurance rates are
[1:29:21] gonna drop a hundred dollars and some of
[1:29:23] you would start shouting and never show
[1:29:27] don't worry it's only temporary just
[1:29:29] wait till next year
[1:29:34] but you see it's a it's a temporary
[1:29:36] peace but the PC gives its eternal tests
[1:29:43] and trials can come and situations arise
[1:29:46] but that peace what he gives it cannot
[1:29:50] be taken it cannot be taken even in the
[1:29:55] midst of situations that you and I don't
[1:29:57] know what's going on we know he's got
[1:29:59] this in control and you can say
[1:30:06] recognizing as we look here in this
[1:30:08] scripture we've come in to that place
[1:30:10] and the innocence is revealed the real
[1:30:12] true reality it's a safety where the
[1:30:15] pressure what is all the condemnation
[1:30:17] that's upon the life all that
[1:30:20] condemnation is released in Jesus Christ
[1:30:23] I'm telling you don't matter what kind
[1:30:25] of baggage a person is carrying right at
[1:30:29] the gate where that confession is made
[1:30:31] from the heart right there that is
[1:30:34] lifted from that life as they would
[1:30:36] enter into that city coming into that
[1:30:38] place of refuge they can let the
[1:30:41] pressure see what it brings us to
[1:30:50] that's what brings us to this reality of
[1:30:54] what the Seventh Seal really is it's a
[1:30:57] relaxing time it's recognizing and
[1:31:01] knowing who we are remember faith is
[1:31:06] based on forgiveness you're in the
[1:31:10] strong tower and you can look back and
[1:31:12] say oh how did I get from there to here
[1:31:16] he brought me here and the same one that
[1:31:21] brought you this far will take you the
[1:31:25] rest of the way home so I really don't
[1:31:29] matter what comes between here and there
[1:31:31] you're going it doesn't matter what
[1:31:35] situations arise your destination was
[1:31:39] already set before the foundation of the
[1:31:42] world God by grace comes down and
[1:31:45] reveals to you you come from God and
[1:31:48] you're going back to God brother when
[1:31:53] that revelation sets in to the Lord and
[1:31:55] you see it's not as brother mem says not
[1:31:58] know certain evidence it's a reality in
[1:32:01] our life that we know the love of the
[1:32:04] world has gone where we were we
[1:32:07] recognize where we were where I am now I
[1:32:10] did not bring myself here God had
[1:32:12] brought me here where it's not just a
[1:32:14] message that my mom and dad believed but
[1:32:17] this is my message this is my Liberty
[1:32:21] this is my joy
[1:32:24] [Applause]
[1:32:25] it's become personal and we're in this
[1:32:30] place and look back now shall my head be
[1:32:34] lifted up no it isn't that pressure has
[1:32:45] boundary lines remember it's our soul
[1:32:48] that is sealed pressure as I read to you
[1:32:56] last week it doesn't know any boundary
[1:32:58] lines such as this church or not this
[1:33:01] church but the RAM says when he's
[1:33:02] preaching brother Rutles it's here he
[1:33:04] said this church is plagued with it the
[1:33:06] tabernacle is plagued with it
[1:33:09] we're all going through we have tests
[1:33:11] yet trials we have pressures you have on
[1:33:13] and on so there's an N is no age limit
[1:33:22] rather men talked about two young girls
[1:33:25] when they went to school
[1:33:28] Bolivia says they were going in the
[1:33:30] first part of college and here the one
[1:33:34] girl both of them come and they'd given
[1:33:36] their life to the Lord but one of them
[1:33:40] she got out there and this the kids the
[1:33:45] professor they started poking fun you
[1:33:49] never kissed a boy what you've never
[1:33:55] see the pressure the pressure was coming
[1:33:59] as though that that's something and that
[1:34:06] pressure came upon that young lady until
[1:34:10] she was in an institution she almost
[1:34:13] lost well she did basically lose her
[1:34:16] mind and you remembering that in the in
[1:34:19] the message where brother Bram says I
[1:34:21] want you to remember me in prayer I'm
[1:34:23] going to go pray for that young lady and
[1:34:25] God who is rich in mercy he came down
[1:34:33] when that lady couldn't find her way
[1:34:35] back hallelujah
[1:34:43] the Holy Spirit had to go out and make
[1:34:46] contact with her spirit and bring it
[1:34:49] right back around Christ you see the
[1:34:54] pressures of this age they are real
[1:35:02] but don't fear there's one who's greater
[1:35:08] than every pressure
[1:35:10] don't fear mama and daddy there's one
[1:35:13] who's greater don't let that put fear in
[1:35:17] your heart just recognize you are
[1:35:20] serving a Living God when this word has
[1:35:29] come into your life I think of what the
[1:35:32] Prophet said when he's set there and
[1:35:34] Hattie Wright's house and the Spirit of
[1:35:36] God moved down he said it was like a
[1:35:37] super anointing and it spoke what had
[1:35:40] taken place with those squirrels he said
[1:35:42] had he said that's nothing but the truth
[1:35:45] he said what took place in there where
[1:35:47] the Spirit of God came down and just
[1:35:49] charged that place and he said the
[1:35:51] testimony is that house has never been
[1:35:55] the same
[1:35:58] presidents the power of this message the
[1:36:03] token applied your house can never be
[1:36:06] the same with Jesus calms it'll never be
[1:36:11] the same your life is never the same get
[1:36:14] anointed it never leaves your
[1:36:19] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:36:23] that's in the world boo devil
[1:36:26] I said boo devil the devil is like a
[1:36:36] roaring lion that's why this pressure is
[1:36:39] that we see all around us more more
[1:36:44] mental breakdowns
[1:36:48] it's a nervous neurotic age it's an age
[1:36:55] the Prophet said it's unfit for humans
[1:36:59] to live in I'm glad that my soul has
[1:37:08] been born from the Netherlands I'm glad
[1:37:13] there's a token I'm glad there's a visa
[1:37:18] on the passport it shows I got my
[1:37:23] immunizations brother William I'm good
[1:37:26] to go
[1:37:31] that's why the pressure is being built
[1:37:33] up I want you to think of this the
[1:37:35] pressures of this age the pressures is
[1:37:39] soft easy living
[1:37:43] I could really preach on this one for a
[1:37:45] little bit if godly but you know I mean
[1:37:49] dad CEO of the company why can't I walk
[1:37:52] out a high school and be the CEO
[1:38:01] yock yock Akiko Lord you know how it is
[1:38:04] I mean hey man I could be the boss of
[1:38:07] this place I don't know how to run it
[1:38:08] the grass is greener on the other side
[1:38:15] pressure of a soft care free you see
[1:38:19] what kind of an egg what kind of an
[1:38:20] attitudes among the people I don't care
[1:38:23] I don't care if I offend you I don't
[1:38:29] care what I say not to your face but on
[1:38:31] Facebook I don't care I don't care who
[1:38:35] sees I don't care I don't care
[1:38:39] he cares do you care that don't care
[1:38:45] attitude is what was outside of the arc
[1:38:51] that's a dangerous attitude this is this
[1:38:58] is what comes take all the brother Brown
[1:38:59] makes this statement it's a complex age
[1:39:03] use complex everything's so
[1:39:06] interconnected everything's so
[1:39:08] technology-driven oh my goodness
[1:39:17] it's the along with this the this is the
[1:39:20] pressures of this age the spirit of this
[1:39:23] age is people's rights in order to
[1:39:29] declaring I have a right to be sinful
[1:39:34] see that's what's coming out I have a
[1:39:37] right I have a right I have its
[1:39:41] inspiration from the pits of hell
[1:39:45] revelations chapter 9 said that there
[1:39:49] was one who fell not descended fell from
[1:39:55] heaven he was called a baton and he's a
[1:39:58] bad man he was called a baton
[1:40:00] apollyon and he loosened you see he's
[1:40:05] got followers he loosened that data then
[1:40:08] that which was battled in the river
[1:40:10] Euphrates what was it those unclean
[1:40:13] spirits that never crossed over to the
[1:40:16] promised land
[1:40:19] and they're influencing the Bible says
[1:40:23] when they ascended out of the pit it was
[1:40:25] a smoke smoke permeates you've been
[1:40:32] around the campfire come in you boys
[1:40:38] been in a fire ain't you
[1:40:43] there were some boys one time that went
[1:40:45] to a fire but it went about hot dogs and
[1:40:49] marshmallows they were being tested for
[1:40:53] their stand
[1:40:55] they went into that College they went
[1:40:58] into that job they went you understand
[1:40:59] they went in there and the Bible says
[1:41:01] that Nebuchadnezzar called for the
[1:41:04] mightiest men in the country to bang
[1:41:07] their hands
[1:41:09] Satan's mighty men wisdom all of these
[1:41:12] great things and they were binding up
[1:41:14] their hands you know was doing it was
[1:41:15] trying to silence their worship it was
[1:41:20] trying to clanton their praise you said
[1:41:23] these guys were in Babylon but their
[1:41:25] heart wasn't in Babylon rather they had
[1:41:31] already let off the pressure they might
[1:41:33] have been in Babylon physically but
[1:41:36] inside they were back there in Jerusalem
[1:41:41] and the heat of the furnace seven times
[1:41:45] hotter and the men who threw him in were
[1:41:49] consumed the stuff from her Shadrach
[1:41:58] Meshach and Abednego I know those are
[1:41:59] Babylonian names I can't remember the
[1:42:02] other Hebrew names Ananias
[1:42:05] what are you all gonna do now well
[1:42:09] weight balance so what are y'all gonna
[1:42:14] do well I see
[1:42:18] a three o'clock about time for prayer
[1:42:23] they were living in victory in the midst
[1:42:27] of pressure they had a place to let off
[1:42:34] the pressure
[1:42:36] when Daniel the pressure came remember
[1:42:40] Daniel said don't not so hasty
[1:42:44] don't tell the King not to be so hasty
[1:42:49] God is God he'll give an answer you
[1:42:55] might feel like you're in a situation I
[1:42:57] have an answer I've gotta have an answer
[1:42:59] I've got to have an answer you're only
[1:43:00] working against yourself
[1:43:07] my brother brian says many times he said
[1:43:09] when you come and you come to a place
[1:43:12] nowhere I forgot them you come into a
[1:43:14] place and you say I didn't get a prayer
[1:43:17] card
[1:43:17] oh no let me get a prayer card I'm not
[1:43:19] gonna get there he said see what's
[1:43:20] happening you're building up pressure
[1:43:22] you're building up pressure you've been
[1:43:24] oh I didn't get my seat oh no I just
[1:43:26] didn't happen well no I got into church
[1:43:28] later or no I got one I know I said and
[1:43:33] you're building up pressure when you get
[1:43:36] to thinking something has got to happen
[1:43:38] a certain way God don't come to nobodies
[1:43:44] box he who sits on the circle of the
[1:43:48] earth who's bigger than all of our
[1:43:50] problems he don't come to any of our
[1:43:54] crafted ideas and crafted ways but he
[1:43:58] said I'm God alone you didn't make me I
[1:44:02] made you here they are in the furnace
[1:44:12] now the men that through men are
[1:44:15] consumed and here they are down there
[1:44:19] and when they get down there the bands
[1:44:24] of the world that high and had them tied
[1:44:25] down the fire released those bands the
[1:44:34] test or the trial brother Aaron it comes
[1:44:36] to free pressures come brother Carlos it
[1:44:42] comes to loose God had an appointment he
[1:44:50] had an appointment to meet his children
[1:44:52] right in the midst of the fire oh there
[1:44:57] are others in heaven a set I'll go down
[1:44:59] I'll go down Gutzon these are my boys
[1:45:04] I'm going down to spend a little bit of
[1:45:06] quality time with my boys it puts the
[1:45:12] testing trial in a whole nother
[1:45:13] perspective don't brother Joey it's God
[1:45:16] saying I want a little bit of quality
[1:45:18] time with you all the pressure was there
[1:45:22] pressure was all around but I want you
[1:45:24] to think about this the fire burned off
[1:45:26] the band's but it didn't consume their
[1:45:28] clothes it didn't consume them and when
[1:45:31] they got out of that test that trial
[1:45:34] they didn't even smell like smoke
[1:45:37] what was it brother there was a seal of
[1:45:41] the Living God they were standing with
[1:45:44] the word of the Lord and they knew who
[1:45:46] they were and it preserved them judgment
[1:45:52] was upon their life but the seal
[1:45:55] preserved them and he met him there yay

[1:51:47] is it this is a secret to letting off
[1:51:50] the pressure

[1:52:07] I want to I want to read this because I
[1:52:09] don't know if I'll get this one correct
[1:52:21] when you come into this place of refuge
[1:52:25] when you've really come in here God has
[1:52:29] taken you fully in remember you're not
[1:52:34] drug to that place a refugee is the one
[1:52:37] who brings you in by saying lord I need
[1:52:39] you I lay down my sinful life sinful
[1:52:43] habit I'll lay it all at your feet Lord
[1:52:46] I need you and you come in there

[1:52:59] wanted to leave once he's touched my
[1:53:05] life I don't ever want to me I'm
[1:53:10] satisfied he's everything
[1:53:16] the Simon had explained that I can't
[1:53:23] but he's my everything brother Brahim
[1:53:27] says I pray daily God don't ever I don't
[1:53:30] ever want to leave here
[1:53:34] it's my refuge
[1:53:38] and pressures mount says well god I'm so
[1:53:43] happy here let me stay oh he says the
[1:53:47] pressure gets great and if it does then
[1:53:51] he is our outlet so we don't have to
[1:53:55] worry about it if you're all pressured
[1:53:58] up and you don't know where you're going
[1:54:00] what's going to happen to you after
[1:54:01] death you don't know you're going to die
[1:54:03] sometimes you've got to do it but then
[1:54:06] the thing to come is to come to Christ a
[1:54:08] refuge and let off the pressure settle
[1:54:12] it once and for all no matter what takes
[1:54:18] place I hope you don't mind me reading
[1:54:21] Christ is our refuge we can let off the
[1:54:25] pressure you can quit worrying about
[1:54:28] well if I die what's gonna happen to me
[1:54:30] what's gonna happen to my wife what's
[1:54:32] going to happen to the husband what's
[1:54:34] gonna happen to the children just come
[1:54:35] to Christ and let off the pressure he
[1:54:37] give us all things all things are ours
[1:54:40] by Christ listen so just let the
[1:54:43] pressure off the only way you can do it
[1:54:50] please don't misunderstand me
[1:54:52] I know that there's things that we have
[1:54:56] is outlet sometimes brothers at hunt or
[1:55:01] fish sometimes you just get so twisted
[1:55:04] up in you you're gonna have some sort of
[1:55:06] an outlet I don't want to be funny but I
[1:55:10] also know sometimes four sisters
[1:55:12] sometimes it can be dangerous but
[1:55:13] sometimes shopping but my brother's
[1:55:18] sister listen to me all of those things
[1:55:21] we see that with Jesus had come aside
[1:55:24] let's rest right brother Bram talked
[1:55:27] about going up you know into those
[1:55:28] things even where brother branham's
[1:55:30] talking about going on meetings he said
[1:55:32] look you some get me to go out here to
[1:55:33] California why don't you bring their
[1:55:34] young uns and come on and join us he
[1:55:36] said we're going to tour the camera what
[1:55:38] gun factory it is and we're gonna go to
[1:55:39] Disneyland he may change that if he was
[1:55:41] here to him about that place but you
[1:55:44] understand
[1:55:46] I say those things so that you
[1:55:50] understand not that you don't but to
[1:55:53] remind us
[1:55:54] don't make carnal natural things to
[1:56:02] replace the real outlet that you need
[1:56:10] when problems arise it's not like Oh
[1:56:13] Lord we've been under such stress we
[1:56:17] need to take Sunday and go to Cedar
[1:56:18] Point
[1:56:21] dum-dum-dum sorry I don't
[1:56:28] you're not thinking correctly all we've
[1:56:33] just been so busy you know God won't
[1:56:35] understand if we go to the Cleveland zoo
[1:56:39] God will understand if we go to the
[1:56:41] Columbus Zoo
[1:56:43] oh we just feel so released when we've
[1:56:46] come back from there something's wrong
[1:56:48] something's wrong with your walk either
[1:56:55] you've not made it into that place of
[1:56:57] safety
[1:56:59] or you've got sidetrack somewhere along
[1:57:02] the way because he is our joy pressures
[1:57:13] are going to come but there is a place
[1:57:16] that's provided by God Six Flags don't
[1:57:22] provide it Kings Island don't provide it
[1:57:27] the latest shopping outlets don't
[1:57:30] provide it you go there you may end up
[1:57:34] with more pressure you see your reality
[1:57:40] is pressures all around us well I'm so
[1:57:44] pressured you know I'm looking at this
[1:57:46] uh-huh
[1:57:46] that's that's the problem what you got
[1:57:51] your eyes on it will affect you your
[1:57:57] eyes not just these eyes but your mind
[1:58:00] what you're meditating on because what
[1:58:03] you meditate on is what you feed on
[1:58:08] that's why you have to watch what you're
[1:58:11] feeding on but there's only one place to
[1:58:15] have as a resource families wonderful
[1:58:18] you need friends let me just you can't
[1:58:22] replace that resource of letting off the
[1:58:26] pressure in him I would say this say God
[1:58:32] helped me to balance my life I'm gonna
[1:58:35] preach why I'm here
[1:58:36] well brother salmon I'm gonna go to shut
[1:58:39] myself in hiding and I'm gonna go have
[1:58:41] some time away from the Lord ask God to
[1:58:43] help you balance out your life so that
[1:58:47] you're not taking spans here and then
[1:58:49] like it's almost like binge eating
[1:58:53] come on now walk balance the stabilizers
[1:58:57] or on the ship praying at all times come
[1:59:03] on somebody sometimes you can miss
[1:59:06] fellowship and fellowship is good preach
[1:59:12] brother Samuel I will pressure gets
[1:59:15] built up there's ways to let off
[1:59:18] pressure hey the world gets together on
[1:59:23] their first days and Fridays preach with
[1:59:25] me now
[1:59:26] the coronavirus ain't stopping them I
[1:59:32] know just well some people said this
[1:59:36] guy's a fanatic let me tell you
[1:59:38] something friends what I'm talking about
[1:59:39] is is that look how the world themselves
[1:59:42] is acting that doesn't mean for us to
[1:59:44] act irresponsible but I'm telling you
[1:59:47] the world knows they look brother joy at
[1:59:49] the end of the week man I can't wait to
[1:59:51] Friday a lot of guys starting on
[1:59:52] Thursday
[1:59:53] man I can't wait to Friday can't wait to
[1:59:55] Saturday and then Sunday comes like oh
[1:59:57] mom what in the world did I do on Friday
[1:59:59] and on Saturday here it is they
[2:00:02] recognize that's their way to let off
[2:00:03] pressure but we don't have to go out
[2:00:11] there and get that drink there's a
[2:00:15] fountain that's open there's a rock in a
[2:00:19] weary land there are laughter's that are
[2:00:22] provided for you and I that we can drink
[2:00:25] from that when there's famine all around
[2:00:28] us when you feel a little the brittle
[2:00:30] dry winds of the desert but yet there's
[2:00:34] a place that you can go to and be
[2:00:37] saturated in his presence no wonder we
[2:00:45] have such joy
[2:00:48] we're doing better Samuel we have yes
[2:00:51] we're to have joy the joy of the Lord is
[2:00:57] my strength
[2:00:59] if you don't do nothing more on this
[2:01:02] tower that you're in just speak your
[2:01:05] head behind you and look how far he's
[2:01:08] brought you he's brought you safe that
[2:01:13] far and he will take you the rest of the
[2:01:15] way that ought to give you a comfort
[2:01:19] then too as you turn around and you face
[2:01:21] the problems you face the pressures it's
[2:01:24] like gyrus gyrus was on his way to the
[2:01:28] house he had already stepped out he was
[2:01:32] under pressure if you go you're out of
[2:01:35] here he's already felt that pressure but
[2:01:42] you know what God allows pressure to
[2:01:45] force us out pressure forces us out come
[2:01:52] on now Jarvis would have never moved to
[2:01:54] his daughter hadn't got sick he too
[2:01:57] continued to be a secret believer
[2:02:00] maybe God's allowing situations in your
[2:02:03] life to force you out hello somebody and
[2:02:09] along the way here came the news
[2:02:14] don't even bother the master don't even
[2:02:19] trouble him no more just let him go on
[2:02:21] back let him go fly
[2:02:29] she's dead Cyrus
[2:02:32] you think the pressure he was under
[2:02:34] before that came upon him at that moment
[2:02:40] there's no doubt about it it was a
[2:02:42] squeeze a pressure came on him at that
[2:02:46] moment
[2:02:51] but the one he had heard about he went
[2:02:56] to him
[2:02:57] and he was there with him cuz he had
[2:03:02] invited him to his home and Jesus heard
[2:03:07] it
[2:03:11] no she's only sleeping
[2:03:16] you see sometimes the way we look at a
[2:03:18] situation the pressure mounts up and
[2:03:24] Jesus said is asleep it might as well
[2:03:29] say Amen
[2:03:30] hey man Lord that's me and everybody
[2:03:33] else sometimes us us this part that's
[2:03:37] out here not our soul the part that's
[2:03:40] out here experiences anxiousness
[2:03:43] experiences worry experiences pressure
[2:03:47] the things be to God there's one in the
[2:03:50] ship when the probably was standing
[2:04:02] there next to his daughter and Satan
[2:04:06] came right up next to him and telling
[2:04:09] him all sorts of things and this and
[2:04:12] that and this and that and this and that
[2:04:15] and the Prophet said I was about ready
[2:04:17] to say if that's how he's going to be he
[2:04:27] said but there's something that rose up
[2:04:28] in me the new birth type post no glory
[2:04:36] of our own your flesh and my spirit our
[2:04:46] flesh and spirit is not built for this
[2:04:48] pressure but when that souls been sealed
[2:04:54] it's not a gun that's been made to be
[2:04:57] into another type of gun like brother
[2:05:02] Branham had that gun the Sun gun
[2:05:03] somebody reboard it but this gun this
[2:05:06] down on the inside when it's been born
[2:05:08] again it's got the right start a man has
[2:05:12] been bored out by the one who really
[2:05:15] makes it the one who stamps Weatherby on
[2:05:17] there he's the one who makes it the one
[2:05:19] who has stepped in the name of the Lord
[2:05:21] is a mighty strong tower
[2:05:23] ooh girl repeater God it's pressurized
[2:05:31] she's just sleeping don't worry I bite
[2:05:37] in me and my words abide in you ask what
[2:05:41] you will and it shall be done
[2:05:49] and he would say I'm your friend that
[2:05:54] sticks closer than a brother
[2:06:01] I'm the one that will perfect what
[2:06:04] concerns you to finish what I've started
[2:06:13] pressures
[2:06:16] they're real
[2:06:18] we're not exempt from no matter how old
[2:06:21] you are but let me just say this
[2:06:23] positive thing at the same time no
[2:06:26] matter how young you are or how old you
[2:06:29] are there's a place of refuge where you
[2:06:34] can come and let off the pressure and
[2:06:36] it's just
[2:06:42] the trials come he's there to walk right
[2:06:46] beside you
[2:06:52] he's a faithful
[2:06:54] faithful friend
[2:06:59] this friend you don't have to put on any
[2:07:01] show phone you don't have to be
[2:07:06] something that you're not but if you let
[2:07:10] him you'll transform your life you'll
[2:07:16] make out of you what you can't even see
[2:07:18] in your life that's how great this
[2:07:22] friend is
[2:07:27] you love him
[2:07:33] sometimes in the sickness
[2:07:37] you know because there's
[2:07:40] stress is two different types right
[2:07:45] there's a good strength
[2:07:48] No
[2:07:50] gotta get dinner on the table but you
[2:07:52] know that's gonna be over all right I
[2:07:54] gotta clean the house right
[2:07:56] I gotta mow the lawn or you know or I
[2:08:00] gotta fix this
[2:08:01] can't put it off another week I've got
[2:08:05] to stand before a congregation it'll be
[2:08:08] over with
[2:08:11] but there's long stress
[2:08:16] sometimes that long stress is where like
[2:08:19] the profit with the amoeba case is a
[2:08:21] question mark at the end not a question
[2:08:24] on the promise of God for he said by
[2:08:26] your stripes by His stripes we are made
[2:08:28] whole the question mark becomes for us
[2:08:31] because we're looking at below it's
[2:08:32] gonna be is it gonna be it's gonna be
[2:08:34] medical route left of a surgery well I
[2:08:36] had to this Laura are you're gonna swoop
[2:08:38] down in miracle or what's it gonna be is
[2:08:39] it gonna be the giving of my life nor
[2:08:41] what what is that sufficient unto the
[2:08:47] day is the evil thereof worrying about
[2:08:52] tomorrow will only take your strength
[2:08:55] for today Oh what's gonna come what's
[2:09:00] gonna be what's gonna be you already
[2:09:02] know
[2:09:03] his word said I'm the Lord that healeth
[2:09:07] all thy diseases
[2:09:12] I know I'm speaking to different ones of
[2:09:15] you right now I've never been saying you
[2:09:17] know many of the places where you have
[2:09:19] been and we've all been in different
[2:09:21] places but I can tell you this just
[2:09:23] sometimes a little bit of suffering
[2:09:24] brother Carlos that I've been through it
[2:09:26] may only been a few days it seems like
[2:09:28] years you can call me a baby you can say
[2:09:32] whatever you want to say
[2:09:36] but sometimes when we're praying and it
[2:09:39] don't seem like we're getting any
[2:09:41] answers
[2:09:44] Jesus your friend Lazarus at the point
[2:09:51] of death
[2:09:52] come quickly rapido
[2:10:03] and what does Jesus do Terri's oh what's
[2:10:10] that mean pressures building of course
[2:10:13] Martha she has a way to try to do with
[2:10:15] that pressure she cumbers herself she
[2:10:23] cumbered with many things nothing wrong
[2:10:26] we have in a clean house but Jesus told
[2:10:28] her there's there's a balance
[2:10:37] but when Mary heard Jesus has come and
[2:10:43] the master the master he's calling for
[2:10:49] you
[2:10:51] where the Williams she dropped where she
[2:10:54] was at and went out to medium pressure
[2:10:58] was all around her think about the
[2:11:01] pressure not only was their brother dead
[2:11:04] he was sleeping
[2:11:06] they said dead but they had all the rest
[2:11:09] of the people around him uh-huh
[2:11:12] where's your church family at now mm-hmm
[2:11:19] where's your pastor at now was last time
[2:11:22] he texts you called you wait I didn't
[2:11:27] mean email you didn't even comment on
[2:11:29] your post
[2:11:38] it was pressure
[2:11:41] and God will allow that pressure but
[2:11:45] there's a release when she got to him
[2:11:50] Master if you had been here my brother
[2:11:56] wouldn't have died she had confidence in
[2:11:59] the working of God in that ministry but
[2:12:03] what Jesus was going to make her aware
[2:12:04] of is that there is no condition oh god
[2:12:11] there's no situation that's beyond
[2:12:15] redemption no situation pressure was on
[2:12:23] the brem says Jesus put a little bit
[2:12:26] more pressure on her and said I am the
[2:12:30] resurrection and the life and she
[2:12:35] accepted it she went to her knees she
[2:12:38] said I know my brother shall rise in the
[2:12:45] resurrection he said I am the
[2:12:46] resurrection and life she says and I
[2:12:49] know even now whatsoever thou asketh God
[2:12:56] he will give it to you and do you
[2:13:02] realize when you pray in the name of the
[2:13:05] Lord Jesus Christ
[2:13:06] it's Jesus praying through you even now
[2:13:13] whatsoever thou asketh the Father in my
[2:13:17] name
[2:13:23] there's no doubt about it there's needs
[2:13:27] there are great it might be different
[2:13:31] for every one of us we might look at
[2:13:33] that need different well when it comes
[2:13:34] to your home it's different when it
[2:13:37] comes down to your address you take a
[2:13:41] need where you could look at some and
[2:13:42] say you'll be all right
[2:13:43] God's in control but when it comes to
[2:13:45] your address then you get desperate and
[2:13:49] say God but those are those times that
[2:13:54] God steps in when nothing else will do
[2:13:57] there's nothing that flesh can resolve
[2:14:00] you've come to the end of your way
[2:14:03] you've done all you can do but this is
[2:14:06] where God steps in when the pressure
[2:14:09] gets so great that you think you're
[2:14:11] about ready to crack that's when he
[2:14:14] steps in you've got a place that you can
[2:14:19] let off the pressure you have promises
[2:14:22] that are available to you as believers
[2:14:28] there's no situation
[2:14:31] no situation beyond redemption
[2:14:36] if God's dealing with your you might say
[2:14:39] brother Samuel you don't know what
[2:14:40] so-and-so said you don't even know what
[2:14:43] what they have said against against what
[2:14:45] I believe where the brand tells us on
[2:14:47] the message paradox he said you want to
[2:14:49] see a paradox he said you see a man come
[2:14:52] into a meeting that would criticize the
[2:14:53] working of the Holy Ghost
[2:14:55] immediately what do we think that's
[2:14:56] blasphemy right but God knows and if God
[2:15:01] puts the burden on your heart then you
[2:15:03] pray you intercede like Abraham
[2:15:07] interceded for a lot brother Brent says
[2:15:09] is a miracle well God will come down and
[2:15:11] take a hold of a life like that he sent
[2:15:13] and that man who'd been a critic and
[2:15:15] criticizing the working of the Holy
[2:15:17] Spirit
[2:15:18] God will come down and change that man's
[2:15:20] life he said in the next night you'll be
[2:15:23] sitting in as a believer who does that
[2:15:26] God does that he specializes in taking
[2:15:31] situations that it seems like it's too
[2:15:34] far gone but God steps in we've got a
[2:15:40] place to let off the pressure let's bow
[2:15:45] our heads
[2:15:51] I know I've taken along longer time
[2:15:53] libertine I want to ask you this morning
[2:15:58] because I know not only here but on the
[2:16:00] Internet as well
[2:16:02] as you reflect into your life I wouldn't
[2:16:06] want to I wouldn't want to pass this
[2:16:09] service for what God has laid on my
[2:16:13] heart here and so pressed on my heart
[2:16:15] throughout these days
[2:16:17] I wouldn't want to go away from here not
[2:16:21] knowing there's not been an opportunity
[2:16:23] been given that if there's one here this
[2:16:27] morning that you haven't come into that
[2:16:31] place of refuge that's safety that you
[2:16:36] might say but at Samuel I come to this
[2:16:38] church that's not what I'm talking about
[2:16:40] you said a man shall be as a covert as a
[2:16:45] shelter as a great where Allah is

[2:24:41] the prophets ministry when pressure had
[2:24:44] come her way Lord a father am asking
[2:24:50] Lord God that made it be such a courage
[2:24:55] in a faith that would move down Lord God
[2:25:00] upon your children the Lord that the
[2:25:05] cares that they have their anxieties
[2:25:10] that's what the scripture calls it that
[2:25:12] they would take every one of those cares
[2:25:14] and right now they just cast them upon
[2:25:19] you you cared enough Lord to come and
[2:25:25] speak to us this way you cared enough
[2:25:28] knowing the pressures that would be here
[2:25:30] in this age the Lord
[2:25:34] [Music]
[2:25:40] we're standing like your children did in
[2:25:43] Acts chapter 4 they had already been
[2:25:47] filled with the Holy Ghost but pressure
[2:25:51] came upon persecution came their way the
[2:25:57] Bible says that they assembled
[2:25:59] themselves together and they begin to
[2:26:01] pray they were letting off the pressure
[2:26:10] Lord then you came down and there was a
[2:26:15] refilling of the Holy Ghost
[2:26:18] Lord Jesus I can't think of no greater
[2:26:24] need than a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[2:26:32] you're a great rock in a weary land
[2:26:36] you're the water where there is parched
[2:26:41] ground yet Lord there's water
[2:26:43] I asked Lord God for every thirsty heart
[2:26:49] here this morning I would say Lord I lay
[2:26:55] down every care
[2:26:57] I want a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[2:27:01] I want to rekindling on that fire on the
[2:27:05] inside
[2:27:07] my focus I've got a little bit off focus
[2:27:10] but I want another feeling of the Holy
[2:27:12] Ghost Lord an answer Lord God where the
[2:27:16] enemy and the pressure is coming but as
[2:27:18] they prayed grant with all boldness that
[2:27:22] thy servants might stretch forth their
[2:27:24] hands
[2:27:25] there are got a boldness Lord in service
[2:27:28] for you stand up on your word the
[2:27:33] promise is Lord that you've given to us
[2:27:40] Lord God it'll have to be you Lord but
[2:27:47] this is our request is that you would
[2:27:51] come Lord Jesus
[2:27:53] unjust lord refill every heart Lord
[2:27:57] refill every life or God even as Lord we
[2:28:02] would even go from this place Lord has
[2:28:04] vessels Lord that are open unto you Lord
[2:28:08] and just even throughout Lord the coming
[2:28:12] days and Lord just fill me Lord fill me
[2:28:16] Lord Jesus just letting off that
[2:28:21] pressure like Rahab where the rest of
[2:28:28] Jericho was under nervous frustrations
[2:28:34] she had received a true token every day
[2:28:40] she looked at that window
[2:28:43] she saw that token hanging Lord you are
[2:28:49] our deliverance you are our strength
[2:28:56] Lord you changed us from the creatures
[2:28:59] we were you transformed our lives now
[2:29:08] Lord I pray may that confidence in that
[2:29:12] rest may it just settle into every heart
[2:29:16] god granite I pray that every trophy
[2:29:23] Lord we give it to you Lord for your
[2:29:26] glory because we're under your care in
[2:29:33] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
