all your prayers we've been going through some trials our health wise and the Lord is the mighty Conqueror and he has been with us and given us a sweet peace through it all and we have one more surgery coming up the end of June here so keep your prayers coming and but the Lord has been so good and we just come today just to testify of his goodness and Vanessa we were driving in the car last

sing it's a song called God's been good [Music] maybe I have been looking back along this winding road to the old familiar markers of his mercies I have known I know it may sound simple but it's more than a cliche there's no better way to tell you than to say God's been good [Music] I've been blessed beyond my wildest dreams when I go to sleep each night though I've had my share of hard times I would change them if I could Oh [Music] God's been times replay and I can see that I've cried some bitter tears but I felt his arms around me as I faced my greatest fears you see I've had more gains and losses and I'm known more Joe even her as his grace rolls down beside me God's been good in my I feel blessed beyond my wildest dreams when I go to sleep each night though I've had my share of hard times I wouldn't change them if I could cuz through we're all God's banker [Music] see God has been my father my savior and my friend his love was my beginning his love will be mine [Music] to tell you everything here's the best way I can say it [Music] God's been good [Music] I've been blessed beyond my wildest dreams when I go to sleep each night you know I had my share of hard times I wouldn't change them if I called you sir [Music] [Music] God's been [Music] a man if it wasn't for his grace wouldn't any of us be here he's thankful today for his love and His grace in her life thank you for those beautiful songs girls that was that was wonderful I love having a family that can sing they just add so much to a service and we appreciate them you never come and be with us today like you to turn in your Bibles this morning if you would to Hebrews chapter four and I want to continue on with the thought I was on back a couple months ago when I was here of entering into his rest and I'm going to put this part to enter into his rest part two and I want to leave some things in here today that perhaps would be a help to some and and perhaps maybe someone you know it might benefit from these thoughts today of entering into his rest let's read together let us this is Hebrews 4:1 let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering to his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it for we which have believed to enter into rest as he said as I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world let's pray Heavenly Father we want to thank you dear God for the privilege of being here this morning I thank you for strengthen our bodies Lord to come to the house God and to serve you and to love you Lord we can't thank you enough father for what you've done and what you've given us we pray today God you just bless us now as we break bread together come and speak to our hearts Lord we pray from your book I have your preeminence and everything that's said and done here today where we give you the praise and the honor and the glory and we ask it all in Jesus name Amen the church said amen amen god bless you you may be seated so I want to continue on if I can with the message the thought of entering into his rest our text that we read here said we should fear lest we come short of it notice it didn't say we reject it we deny it or we refuse it it just said to fear lest we come short that simply means to stop short or not to go far enough not to enter in so I want to back up if I can this morning and just I'll regroup a little bit and this is more of a teaching service this morning than evangelistic so you have to put on your thinking caps a little bit I have a lot of scripture that I want to get to today as we bring this thought out and there's this purpose for it so if you've got a pen and paper you might want to write them down that way you'll have them to go back and reference and if you can keep up that's good otherwise they they put them on the screen so I think that's a wonderful thing so let me just recap a little bit of what we talked about when we were here the last time we started out you remember talking about the crazy world that we live in and how the world is falling apart we talked about the message letting all pressure how that everybody's running and rushing and going everywhere and going nowhere and it's an age of nervous tension causing us two things to do something wrong or to act out of place we said that's just what the devil wants us to do he wants to get us off balance so we'll do something wrong or we're act out of place that's his job so he tries to keep us nervous upset and get to a place that we can't we can't function properly the pressures of this age you said was three things riches soft living and nervous tension that's the pressures of this age the pressures of riches you can't you can't make it with one job anymore Hartley too many pressures gotta have this got to have that got to keep up with the Joneses it's got to keep up with mom and dad got to do what everybody else is doing Satan they'll put everything you can on you to think you've got to have the best of everything and you got to do everything everybody else is doing and that's just not true you are you and we love you for who you are doesn't matter what you have hello hey man amen I love it don't you so we want to look at it today and how that the whole earth is acting acting out of place we talked about 6cl opens with a great with a great earthquake in birth pains and what's with us going through and the storms my goodness said that have rocked this world the floods the the fires the hurricanes the the tornadoes the earthquakes and now volcanoes erupting just about everywhere around around the world just and that's the sixth seal coming the sixth seal is a tribulation and it opens with a great earthquake eden ow california could go we don't know any day it could happen but the bride is not focusing on the 60 the brides focusing on the Seventh Seal which is the coming of the Lord amen we talked about the mystery of God how that's Christ in you the hope of glory we talked about the fivefold ministry and their purpose to bring us to perfection we talked about adopting age and they placing those sons and daughters and talked about manifesting time and the whole whole creation is groaning in travail 2 for the sons of God to be manifested in saij that we're living in because it's manifesting time the fruit is on the vine the lovely the one is coming in plain view we're looking at these things today as we watch them we've read from jehovah-jireh we found out that he said now here he is among the church today made flashiest church he gave us the main over the earth and we ran an adoption part for he said for the manifestation of the sons of God when true sons born sons filled sons speak and their word is back say to this mountain brother I desire so and so I'm a believer in Jesus Christ and I give it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there's a manifestation he said Wow different than what we thought in Pentecost there's a manifestation I give it to you in the name of Jesus Christ I'm a son of God I'm a daughter of God I grant it to you well my crops are burning about I send you water in the name of the Lord bless your crops we talked about the 5 manifestations of the third pole in brother branham's life talked about the storm on Colorado you remember we talked about the fish it got his life back we talked about the squirrels that were created we talked about Hattie right I can't spend a lot of time on this now because I got to go through the whole message here so I'm I'm trying to hurry long we talked about we talked about sister Hanny right when she said that's nothing but the truth about the Randleman and we talked about sister branham's tumor and how that it was healing we said it wasn't a bunch of hit and miss stuff going on but every time we said before brother Branham used the manifestation of that third Pole every time God spoke to him first and told him to speak so it's not a you know show it's not something just hit and miss that's going on there were that were they were trying to trying to do this God speaks and we answer he said here in the Perkins Church it said they they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still what is that maturity I didn't say they weren't bright if they kept still I just said they either have thus saith the Lord or they keep still why because they've learned all speak when he speaks you know that's when I get in trouble is when I talk and I shouldn't talk he told me to say it first thing that's your yea be yea and your nay nay not oh I could say things but I better not in a message why are we so tossed and I kind of added this in there he said and one day he entered into the temple and he picked up the scroll in red the Spirit of the Lord is upon me for it's anointed me to preach the acceptable year and to bind up the broken hearts of the heal the sick and give sight to the blind and now we would think if such an anointing was on him they'd been prophesied eight hundred years before that he would come and here is with that type of an anointing the full blessing an anointing of the Lord upon him we would want to run all over the building we'd want to scream and run a holler but the Bible said he laid down the scroll and he sat down remember it said the eyes of all them in the synagogue were fixed upon him he spoke for the rents they spoke these precious words this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears identifying who he was and identifying the age that we're living in brother Branham said that's that's the precious words he said that's that's what he'd done under the anointing he didn't run scream shout listen God's not deaf you don't have to scream Devils out and the devil's not deaf either when that maniac up there in Washington come to tear brother ban him apart and it charged the platform brother Ram stopped the policeman and said let him come remember that come right up in front of him like he was going to beat and he did done it before the preachers he was gonna do it again brother just under his breath talked to him and said because you challenged a subtle god you're gonna fall at my feet nobody hurt hardly anybody ever heard that and a man went down boom you don't have to yell it you've got the authority according to the Word of God to speak the word in the Intervale preached up here in Sturgis Michigan 56 we learned that there were three courts the inner court and the outer court the inner court and the Holy of Holies and we learned that in the outer court the the firmament Sun the Moon the Stars that's what gave lightning on the another court and some days would be rainy some days would be cloudy some days the Sun would and shine that's a lot of people are there Christian Walker's right there they don't have any victory if it's not sunshine a little bit of rain and they just cloud up and want to cry themselves I think we've got enough rain I'd do a little crying I say how sorry about the head but but you know you you you you you you it depends on where you're living yet we found out said well how do we get how do we get worse was me you gotta keep moving you got to keep progressing you kind of keep growing in Christ and we found out then the the inner veil was were behind the curtain where the the the the the table of shewbread was where the prayers were offered and then the seven golden candlesticks was there and that was an artificial light sometimes those lamps would get filmed over sometimes they they'd go out the wicks would go down somebody would have to come in the priests would have to community you have to fix them again and get them going again because of an artificial light that's why our experience is sometimes it's artificial if everything's burning good everything going great we're feeling good but get a little low and we get a little low and all of a sudden were did down here lower than the curb how you doing by John doing so good we're getting the Molly grubs but then there's the Holy of Holies where the Shekinah glory is where the lamb is the light it never goes out remember the song in the city where the lamb is the light in that city where there cometh no nice I've a mention over there and it's free of toll and care I am going where the lamb it's like hey and if he likes you up buddy you get you live I'll tell you what you don't have to happen you don't know nothing to lie anymore he likes you bill your lip so what happened to him how he got lit he got in that interval you got inside the Holy of Holies in all of us suddenly got lit that's what I want I want to be lit it all depends on where you're living at see you got to keep walking keep going on into the Holy Spirit into the holy place let's a curtain drop the curtain dropped behind that priest and it's sealed him out seal the world out and sealed him in sorry I shouldn't yell it that's not my mic here sorry guys oh you can take the blame okay that's fine no I didn't mean to do that sorry I'm teaching I can't preach slow down here so we're live in a world when everyone would like a quick fix I'm fat I like something I'd like a pill road be like I just take a boom I've this in I like a pill I don't want to work for it I don't want exercise I don't want to labor I don't have to go all these camps and do this and do that I just want to pee I'll give me a pill that'll instantly melt the fat off my body oh we're looking for a quick fix it's the truth come on now we want something that'll work quick we want something and we want to know patience but I want it now and we're living in it you know everything's super super super super when I first time I preached this message was at our home church the first part of it that I preached here before it was Super Bowl week and everything was super super super super and I got thinking about a mother man talked about how it everything's so super the whole world is looking for a superhero we want something to come and fix it all and that right what something to take us out of our troubles take it Ronald D we they got all kinds of hero superheroes today is that right they got they got super everything super super super market super highway super moon never heard of a super moon in my life Super Bowl superheroes Hitler thought he had a super race they have superheroes they got Batman spider-man I love this Superman Wonder Woman Captain America Captain Marvel Iron Man flash the flash the Green Lantern that was my day the hawk showed the picture this is just a little phase of what's out there but giving all of that giving all of that we have a superhero giving all of that we have our own superhero and the next slide you're gonna see will show you how he handles things please nope back up there he is you see what he's saying there and this is how I save the world there's a superhero Jesus Christ Lord of lords King of Kings all power all in nor they all everything is upon him he's a super super natural God he takes care of everything let's go and in a mess he's called super Sayan and Jeff in 1959 he said like this can you see the real side it's Jehovah become one of us Jehovah God on earth as a fugitive a pilgrim in the land that he created rejected and pushed and laughed at scoffed at a stumbling stone to the unbeliever a rock of offense a devil to the righteous world but to the eternal sign to the believer God with us that's super sign super sign and Chicago he said it like this but but we're in a super super sale super super super super everything's super super cars super jets super speed super everything super race Oh everyone's super once once a super race Hitler thought told the Germans they were super people and found out they weren't they said next slide they said the days of miracles has passed and all these things let them prove it I'll give you an everlasting sign a super sign oh he could have come an angel he could have come whatever he wished you but he chose to come as Abraham's seed amen Abraham super seed because they got what supernatural power supernatural signs with a supernatural belief in a supernatural word from a supernatural God you talk about super who is it whoa super natural God in a super natural body in a super natural people giving supernatural signs hallelujah yes a super race and that that they know their God shall do exploits but the same signs and the same supernatural signs still shows among the supernatural people which is a seed of Abraham that's us I think it's time we take our hair that's I think it's time we take our position in the word and stand on what is ours and claim it a man God he talks about here in a paragraph in 92 he said God that that little baby cried that was Jehovah did you see it God living in a baby God living in a teenager what type of teenager was he he set the example when he was lost by his father and mother he looked about to find him and they found him in the temple What did he say as a teenager no you're not that I must be about my father's business example for teenagers see same with the little bride today just look around you little babies just look around you little babies teenagers moms dads grandpa's grandma's what is super Sayan i saw what is it's super sad to see it right it's right here today you don't have to look far look beside you just the fact that you're in the house of God just the fact that you're keeping your head above water and you keep on keeping on and you keep serving God and you don't give up and you don't turn back and you don't run there's something super about you that's you're overcoming and you're doing doing it the right way so why next slide why do we suffer so why are we already feeted depressed rather fighting and laboring and working so hard to achieve it's because we're not resting Church we're not resting we need to walk into that holy place and let the curtains drop around us and the whole world seal you out the whole world on the outside you're living in this your kind of glory there's something going on inside that has never gone on before and you are feeling the presence of God in all the turmoil and all the Satan's Eden that he's got out there you are living a victorious life because Jesus Christ has come on the inside of you and baptize you with the Holy Ghost and the Spirit of the Living God is living inside of you hey man all right so what I want to say then is the Holy Ghost is our rest today it's not a Saturday or a Sunday Sabbath it's the Holy Ghost and I want to get into that because we're precious friends that are seventh-day adventists people that love us and we love them some of my grandkids have gone to seven Adventists school I have a granddaughter this teaching there now in their school there's some good people there and and they love the Lord some of them really do I've good people that are that are Jewish people Messianic Jews that believe in Christ and they're trying their best but they're still living under that Old Testament of sabbath-keeping being Saturday so I'm not you you do what you want to do let me just say this for the sake of the tape and who might hear it I'm not condemning that I'm just saying I want to share with you what I feel the scriptures say about it and about how that we need to move into a rest that'll bring rest to your soul not just the body because it's the inside that's the important part is that right we need rest for the body yeah I don't think there's anything wrong with taking a rest day I wish I could take a rest day and not have to worry about it you know you know what maybe you don't work on Saturday maybe Saturday is your day off but then there's that list there's that honey-do list for Saturday for you honey do this and hon do that and hon you this and do that so honey do list you thought you were gonna kick up feet up just rest but Saturday is okay Saturday won't work for you so we're doing on Sunday we do it Sunday Sunday can they arrest but you got to get up you get are you ready for church I've come to the house of God what you should do because we're on to the resurrection but then we get involved with everything else and so many other things we're fellowship and so on so it's cognitive this has got or your Monday nothing wrong with taking some rest we all could use rest because we get so busy in this crazy world but I want to talk about our real rest I want to talk about our real Sabbath if you don't mind and share some things from my heart and for the sake of the tape that I'm making here today as well as it is sharing with others so let's let's enter into this as we look at this today in Hebrews chapter 4 this is where we read the rest in him because he's our Sabbath so let's go back to our scripture now and just take a quick little look here I'm not a I'm not a teacher I'm not by any means a final voice on anything at all I just I like to take Scripture and bring it together and let it speak for itself I like to do that and then I like to bring the message dovetailing reading with it to show that it was backed by a prophet and it's tough saith the Lord because that's what the Word of God is so why aren't we so tossed why is your life in an uproar are we resting I think we get too busy I think we get too busy sometimes for the Lord how's your prayer life ouch you know I think we just get too busy Church we got to back up and take time and say Lord and forgive me he loves to talk to you he loves to sit with you he loves you know as a parent you love your children to come and just said talk it doesn't have to be deep subjects and deep conversations but just you know mom I really love you and I appreciate all your done mother just feels real good dad you're a fine example I appreciate you dad well son I appreciate you too you turned out pretty good thanks to your mom you know it's just taking time to talk to the father and I didn't speak back I longed for those times and we just don't do it enough I'm guilty we just don't do it enough because we get caught up in this rat race caught up in two things of the world that's going on but let me go through this I've got to I've got to read quick and you've got to listen fast all right I usually go about 220 miles an hour when I'm speaking in gust up to 440 so just listen I'll speak quick and you listen fast let us therefore fear you know to be afraid to besieged siege by alarm lest a promise being left us remember what he said the prompt for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that our far-off events the minions the Lord I got your call what was that the Holy Ghost so let's be careful let's watch let's let's be a little alarmed by this that a promise being left us of the Holy Ghost of entering into his rest and that word rest there means a calming of the winds a resting place a heavenly blessing us to make quiet or just to rest that's what the holy ghost wants to do in your life wants to settle you so you stopped long enough to have this relationship and this atmosphere around you to where it doesn't matter what's going on out here you're at rest you're at peace your homes got order to it your family's standing together because we let everything come in and it just shakes all of that can you say Amen it really does it shakes all of us so watch what he says here for unto us was the gospel preached as well as under them but it did not profit them they didn't get anything out of it what it wasn't useful to him wasn't advantageous not being mixed with faith revelation they didn't have a revelation so they could understand heard the same word that we hear done that but they didn't have any understanding to it for a we which have believed to enter into rest we enter into rest as he has said as I swore to my wrath if they shall enter into my rest my rest he said although the works were finished from the foundation of the world I like that the Bible said he was a lamb slain from the foundation of the world it was all completed it was all done we just got to do our part we got to live our part of it amen can you say Amen for his sake in a certain place verse 4 for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wife and God did rest the seventh day from all of his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest seeing therefore it remaineth that some of us enter in and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief talking about the Jews and again he limited a certain day saying in David throughout the Psalms today after so long a time is it has said if they will hear my voice harden not your heart for if Jesus had given them rest if he to give him a day Saturday Sunday then would they not have afterwards spoken of another day there remaineth therefore a rest the people of God and for he that is entered into his rest his rest he keeps emphasizing that he also has ceased from his own works as God did from his amen talking more of just a 24-hour day rest entering into his rest ceasing from our labors let us therefore a labor to enter into that rest that is lest any man should seem to she'd fall after the same example of unbelief so let me just say something to the law and the commandments was only a shadow and a type of the real that's all the Old Testament was it was a shadow of the New Testament of what was going to come in yet people get so hung up on Old Testament teachings and laws and ordinances and and things in the little church in our in our area they love the bunch of people they're there because himself a Messianic Jew he's got a worldwide ministry he's a great orator great speaker great fella but he's he's into all the all all the ordinances all the old feast and all those things he wants to do them and still you know as a Christian talk about Christ which is which is okay I don't want to condemn that but friends we've been set free ordinances and all the things in the Old Testament they were they were nailed to the cross and let me just say it like this once Christ came that changed everything once he gave His life as a sacrificial lamb which was a type of that land back in the days when they Slade Slade the lamb and Slade the ox and if for the sins of the people now the real sacrificial lamb came and gave His life and were under a new covenant wonder new testament for a testament is only enforced after the death of the testator and now it's a new day so let's go Hebrews 7 and verse 19 said it like this for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto God Christ our land changed everything Church and if we're going to be believers of Christ we've got to believe what he did because we're still trying people are still trying to do it by works and it ain't gonna work if there's anything we can do to make ourself perfect then Christ died in vain hey man he was 10 verses 1 to 6 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect there's no perfection in the law you can keep it by the letter but there's no perfection in the law verse 2 said for then would they not have ceased to be offered if there had been perfection they wouldn't have to do it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over because the worshiper once purged should have had no more conscience of sin but they did and every year they had to come back and do the same thing over again and over again but Christ died once for all think a minute I love it don't you verse 3 said but in those sacrifices there there is a remembrance again made every year for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins listen friends only Jesus can satisfy your soul there's nothing else is the answer to everything where for first five when he comes into the world he says sacrifice and offerings out what it's not but a body esta prepared me Who am I I'm coming as a sacrificial lamb I'm there's a body is given to be a sacrifice in other words he was born to die that was his purpose in coming he was born to give his life to you and I can have life in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou has had no pleasure a man that didn't answer it listen we got good friends out here and I want to help him I want to just let him know you know why we're different we just differ I don't get it differ nothing wrong with that but the truth of the matter is if we're going to believe the Bible let's believe the Bible let's believe all it said I like to live by the Ten Commandments I'd like to do that God I can't keep them ain't good enough yeah well I bless God I'm a Ten Commandment well that's fine you ever lied well meaty tell him I'm not here see now Christ came and from that time on until now it's all about him are you listening to me friends it's all about him let's go to Colossians chapter 7 chapter 2 I'm sorry Colossians chapter 2 verse 19 this is teaching I'm sorry I'm not shouting and running in the aisles I'm not sorry I'm not doing that I mean for your sake I mean I'm not I'm not walking the back of the Peters here today this is good stuff though you say man for in him dwelleth the fullness of the Godhead bodily in who in Christ the fullness of the Godhead bodily and we are complete in him oh wait a minute what about what about the ten commandments what about the law no we are complete in him we're completing him which is the head of all principality and power in whom also ye are circumcised with a circumcision made without hands in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ buried with him by baptism wherein also ye are risen with him through faith and the operation of God who has risen from the dead and you being dead in your and your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh he hath quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses how many reckon that means all yeah I think it means all so who is gonna condemn me who's going to tell me that I've got trespasses going on no he forgave me all my trespasses doesn't matter what the devil says doesn't matter what the accuser says I'm sorry he's forgiven me all yeah but you don't keep Saturday I know I don't keep Saturday I don't keep Sunday either like I should but I'll tell you why I go to church a little bit it's not about a day it's about him it's about the Holy Ghost of being filled with the Holy Ghost and him giving you rest for your soul here's the answer it's all about him Church first word was I at what verse 13 okay verse 14 blotting out the handwriting of Ordinances oh my that was against us people think the law is a wonderful thing it wasn't for a wonderful thing I'll explain to you why it was given here in a little bit and that that it's not to be observed now it's over whew that's pretty good statement okay let's just let the word say it okay sorry blotting out the handwriting or nurses that was against us which was contrary to us and took us out of the way nailing it to the cross and having spoiled principalities and powers made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of hot and holiday or of a new moon or of a Sabbath days let no man judge you because the teaching a lot of it folks in the seventh day if you don't keep Saturday then then that's that's the important about sin almost that's you're not going to make it that's a seal the seventh day Saturday to them keeping the Saturday then is is is is a seal of God is what they say but that's not true the seal of God is the Holy Ghost and I don't it's fine if people want to worship on Saturday I don't have a problem with that thank God their worship and they want to worship every day amen so he said that let no man judge you a meat and drink respect to a holiday or a new moon or over Saturdays which are a shadow of things to come but the body is of Christ the shadow they're an image that's what a shadow is this an image of the real it's not the real you could come up to get me want to just hurt me and destroy me in see me walking down the street and they're my shadow going along there you could do whatever you want my shadow you could stab it and beat it and shoot it and kill it but are you gonna die cause it's only a shadow it's not too real it's a shadow of what was coming it's not the real image it's the shadow of the real image amen and you know when the real shows up the shadows gone who wants to talk to a shadow oh hey watch now that's bless your heart Galatians chapter 3 halation chapter 3 Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law that curtain where curse means doomed doomed that's what the law did it doom people Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us as written cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree that the blessings of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith you see the dispensations changed when Jesus Christ came to dispensations changed it had changed from the law and all the ordinances and all the rituals and all the Jews had done for all those thousands of years it had changed now to a body to a young Jewish boy walking in shoe leather and they couldn't handle it and yet that body that young man stood there one day and he said except you believe that I am he you're gonna die in your sins this is tough stuff this is real stuff this is a baby talk this is real meat this is straight talk if you're not accepting Jesus Christ and you've got a problem and the problems in your heart all right can I continue yes I can thank you where is that what verse verse 19 wherefore then serveth the law what was the purpose why did it all come it was added because of transmission they couldn't live right they couldn't do things right their innocence he was gone in the garden they didn't make it under human government in those days so God sent the law because of all their transgressions it wasn't a good thing but it was something he had to sin to bring him in check for the things that were doing wrong well we have something that brings us back in check today it's called the holy spirit that'll check you and watch you and keep you day by day in your walk with God I love him don't you church we're for service the law ed because your transgressions till until the seed should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator between God and man 4:21 said is the law then against the promise of god god forbid for if there had been a law given that could have given life verily righteousness should have been by the law but before faith came before faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed wherefore the law was a schoolmaster oh my you know a school masters are their little tough dudes the classroom they keep you in line we had one like I forgot her name no goodness sakes I thought I'd never forget her name I think it was mrs. I think was mrs. bath she was anything but a bath but if you are paying attention and you had your head down and you had your hand anywhere she could get to it she had a ruler she carried around the classroom and she would go Shrek oh and she didn't care that she was a schoolmaster she was a test master she was a jailer she was a tyrant she was a warden she was a good teacher the law here's what the law was don't get so hung up on the law it wasn't the real thing it was given it's a schoolmaster wherefore the law was a schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ which we might be justified by faith that we might be justified by faith but after faith come we are no longer under master we're graduated some of us quit you ate it I didn't put some yes but we graduated we're on school why do you need a schoolmaster now that you're out of school you don't need somebody to crack your knuckles but yet God gives us leadership of the Holy Spirit that says wait a minute you shouldn't do that what was that thought to her thinking you better watch that better change that you better not go there we're still under leadership we've still got guidance but now it's the Holy Spirit and it's guided by love is guided by by the presence of God and in the will of God and I don't have any idea where their what I did with my eyes okay let me look here where am I at guys what am i reading from do you know well where for Orpha but after about their faith has come then we are no longer under a schoolmaster were set free from the law that's plain isn't it it is to me maybe I'm not seeing something but I I want to second Corinthians 3 second twenty three but if the administration of death now that's the law the administration administration of death written and engraved in stones what was written and engraven stones the Ten Commandments is that right if the administration of death written and engraven in stones was glorious so that the children really could not said vastly look about the finished of Moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the Spirit the Holy Ghost be rather glorious more perfect more glorious if the administration of condemnation law be glory much more the ministration of righteousness Christ exceeding glory for then that which was made glorious had no glory in the respect by reason of the glory that Excellus for if that which has done away was glorious much more that was remaineth is glorious seeing then that we have such a hope we use great plainness plainness of speech not as Moses which would have a low risk face then the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end which is abolished but their minds were blinded for until the day this day remain as the same veil on taken away at the reading of the Old Testament the veil which veil is done away in Christ he changed it altered if you're still living under Old Testament law you haven't accepted Christ as your sacrifice as your lamb as your deliverance as a better thing we had the law but we were hoping something better would come along and God knew it would because he was a lamb slain from the foundation of the world this was all in his plan it was his plan for Israel to go through this he was his plan for the fall he was the plan for redemption it was a plan for Christ to come he was the plan for the Holy Ghost to be given it's a plan for you to be sitting here today in the anointing of God he had a plan he said but even until this day when Moses is read the Vedas upon their heart verse 15 verse 16 nevertheless when it the heart shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away the law will go and Grace will come and then you're free you're free Paul said the Apostle Paul says all things are lawful unto me but I won't be a brought into bondage of any of it all things are lawful but all things are not expedient I'm free Christ has set me free he who the Sun sets free is what friend heed you're not bound to keep things look at when Christ came when Jesus came memory said he said when he came he said I'm not coming to destroy the law but I come from a fillip member he said that he was a field fulfilling of the law we came to this earth he magnified the law that's the way I want to say it I can say it changed it because he did change it but he magnified it this is where he says in Matthew 5:27 28 Matthew 5:27 28 but she have heard that it had been said by them of old thou shalt not commit adultery but I say any who so ever look at upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart what did you he magnified it though the law said thou should not commit adultery but it stopped there it was a physical act but now Jesus brings it over and said this is a condition of the heart to lust after her already in his heart there's an adult right now so he main defined look what he said he goes on here in same chapter verse 22 21 22 look what he says here you have heard that have been said of them of them all thou shalt not kill but whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment but I've said unto you whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause this in danger of the judgment that were anger looked our word up anger anger one time anger is a struck it means it means a strong hateful hating strong hey who sever strongly hates another the same as a murdering spirit killing spirit what did he do he magnified it but I see a new whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment whosoever shall say to his brother Rick and the only taxation I could come up with modern was idiot don't call your brother an idiot he may be one we're gonna call him man which be in she'll be in danger the consequence never say thou fool shall be in danger of the Hellfire you don't call your brother a fool your brother's not a fool you may do foolish things but he's not a fool because The Fool has said in his heart there is no God that's a fool a man so what is the real rest what is the real thing here then can I go just a little bit longer okay I'm not preaching I'm trying to teach a little bit all right let's look here Matthew 11 beginning in verse 28 let's look at the real rest now come unto me all you that labor and heavy laden and I will give you rest another word for rest of Sabbath in other words that I looked at that rest it means to cause the cease from labor to recover to collect to draw strength to refresh to keep quiet and calm take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your soul rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light it's not a schoolmaster it's not a hard thing it's a joyous thing I'd be kidding you on a little further here Romans chapter 13 let me look he with me beginning conversatio low man anything but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled it's a law what what love fulfills a lot Wow for this first night thou shalt not commit adultery thou shall not kill thou shalt not steal what is that that's the law then commander thou shalt not bear false witness thou shalt not covet and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in to this saying thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law it fulfills it all right so he goes on now Isaiah Isaiah brought it out in Isaiah 28 you know what we're getting to the rest for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little there little for with stammering lips and another tongue will I speak under those people for whom he said this is the rest this is the rest this is the rest where anybody cause the weary to rest then this is the refreshing yet they would not hear they won't accept it wondering except the Jews would not accept the Holy Ghost they would not accept the day of Pentecost they would not accept Christ coming because for them to have done that would have undone all that that they had done for years not realizing that was just there until this came this is the real deal Christ superseded everything modern term he trumped everything he was the real deal all right so the Holy Ghost is our rest today acts 2 I'm not gonna read this I'm not gonna read this next that's cool because you know it the day of Pentecost when the day of Pentecost was fully come here in the upper row remember and they and they spoke with tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance I'm not gonna read that one so why do we gather on Sunday then why are we different than the seventh-day Adventists and in the Jewish faith why do we gather on Sunday and not on Saturday well two reasons that I can say it's off the top of my head number one reason is to is to honor the resurrection once Christ came and rose on the first day then Christians honor the resurrection of Christ and so we meet on Sunday for that purpose Luke chapter 24 verses 1 to 3 Luke 24 verses 1 to 3 now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came unto the sepulchre bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with them and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre and they entered into the fowl not the body of Christ I'll not the body of our Lord Jesus he is not here verse 6 he is not here but he is risen remember how he spake unto them when they were yet in Galilee he is not here he has risen the second reason we meet on Sundays because all the early church met on Sunday all the Apostles all the disciples they all met on Sunday Acts chapter 20 verse 7 back to chapter 20 verse 7 and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread Paul preached unto them and continued his speech until midnight 1st Corinthians 16 one and two all right can I just finish this now please I'm doing real good time-wise it just seems like it's longer because I'm not walking the aisles but I want to lay this in here and what this is good solid teaching because I love I love people I love the folks that we know that our friends of ours in the 7-day administers they're good friends and they love our family we love them and and a precious friend Sherry's got a landlady this of Messianic Jew she's a precious lady I wouldn't want to hurt them for anything in the world but there's truth is truth whether it's for me or whether it's for anybody out the truth is truth and I want people to know the truth so I speak it from my heart first within 16 verse 1 now concerning the collection of the Saints as the offerings the tithe said I this is Paul as I have given order to the churches of Galatia as I whose thing is it was Paul think he is this that they're gonna come on the first day of the week dictate the collection what about Saturday who was Paul well he only wrote 14 books of the New Testament he only said except you were if an you were an angel from heaven or an angel from heaven come preaching any other gospel than what I preached unto you let him be accursed whoa this guy's got some macho body this is the real deal here amen amen now so concerning the collections of the Saints as I have given you order to the churches of Galilee even so do ye upon the first day of the week that every one of you by lay by him in store as God has prospered him that there be no gatherings when I come day your ties 10% you give listen if you're not doing that then you're not you're not fulfilling the the word of the Lord you know because that that 10% of what you earn is not yours that's the Lord's it's not brother Sam's that's the Lord's we paid into the storehouse of the law of the Lord in God has a man there to take care of it he has a ministry there has a Levite there that takes care that the Lord's money hello if trustees that take care of of the building and the things that go on with the funds that come in to to support the church so we're not doing that then we're not doing the law we're going to do the word either as it is spoken here so the Sabbath I love this little statement the Sabbath actually was made for man and not man made for the Sabbath we should be held under bondage by the Sabbath because we're free all right look at mark - mark - there's 23 mark 2 verse 23 are you with me can I go do something I know I can I had quit CNN mark 2 verse 23 fur came to pass that he went through the cornfields on the Sabbath day and his disciples begin as they went to pluck the ears of corn on a Sabbath day and the Pharisees said behold why do they on the Sabbath day that which is unlawful it's not lawful to do that any centre to them have you never read what David did when he had need and they were hungered he and them that with him how do they win into the house of God in the days of the abbot are the high priests and did eat the shewbread which he is not lawful to eat but for the priests and he gave also unto them that were with him and he said unto them the Sabbath was made for man and not man for it's therefore a blessing that occurs people make it a curse if you don't keep it your gun no that's not why was there was there to help you that's what the Holy Spirit is there for the Son of Man is Lord also of the Sabbath 1st Corinthians chapter 6 verse 12 and 13 Paul said all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful with me but I would not be running the power of any all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expanding all things are lawful unto me but all things edify it not now I'm not gonna elaborate there's a lot more scriptures that we could bring here of teaching that Paul talked about the things sacrificed to idols and all these things and he said we're free we're free from all that but don't use your Liberty as an offence you respect people respect but don't flaunt your liberties don't say haha I don't have to do it no have the right spirit be careful how you present things you know something I've even heard people say well you don't want to talk to them they they rejected the message years ago maybe they didn't maybe they rejected how it was presented hello maybe that's the problem not not the message but how its presented because sometimes people get pretty rough with it people made it no I'm not gonna you know I'm not gonna say there's not problems problem children I would say that way they come along well that church over there you don't go to that church they got no ain't no different we got to people are people there are humans are humans everywhere that's another subject all right first Corinthians 6:12 all things are lawful but all things are not explained all things lawful I'm sorry all things broad okay first Corinthians 10 in 2003 did I read all that already I read all that already alright let's go I'm gonna I'm gonna close with this part here I think so I want to look at brother branham's convictions about Sunday because I I really I'm going to say from my heart too I think sometimes we we forget that it should be a we should honor the resurrection not just not just from 11:00 to 1:00 stepping out of my authority here brother Sam's gonna have to really really get me when he gets back but this is me I feel like we we shouldn't just honor the resurrection on Sunday morning when we're in service but I think we're too easy to get lacks with the rest of the day and get going do things that perhaps we shouldn't be doing take a rest day take a day talk to your children be a family fellowship with people but don't just turn it into another day that's me now and brother branham he had kind of had a conviction about him so I'm gonna read here from questions and answers number two this is co D 1964 and I'm just gonna read you listen as I read this now you say brother Branham you hunt didn't you ever hunt on Sunday well let me tell you something I'm not patting myself on the back here with of this but I'm not a sabbatarian now I believe the Holy Spirit is our Sabbath I believe that I believe we should honor that resurrection as a memorial that's a memorial that if you honor any day honor the resurrection now there's a no no law on keeping any certain day because you enter into the Sabbath of peace when you enter into him I've got that question here that I'm going to answer pretty soon anyhow if the Lord willing and about what the Sabbath day and I'll explain it God willing and now notice remember this see when I was a little boy right up here in Utica you I can't even cross that Youkilis I don't know what it is live down on the road I was about 14 years old I wasn't rapping for a living the only thing I had to help to get bread in our house it was catching skunks muskrats and possums I loved trapping I had to do it I go to school smelling like a skunk I had only one pair of clothes and that's all I had could wear and that's all I had mom would take it and wore some worth them often and washed them and put them back on and now that's how I went to school little boy I was standing right up there one night I said I I got them traps set out there around waffles up above that I leave every morning about two o'clock in the morning with my lanterns I'd run those traps and then get back here in time to go to school I catch a rabbit I got 15 cents out of it I get a box of shells out of that and maybe kill two three or four rabbits that what we didn't have to to make some biscuits and rabbits why the gravy for supper I've sell the others and maybe get enough to to get some bread or some meal some flour to make gravy I didn't know what whether you had that light like that or not I'd set it trout lines on the river and go down there and get them fish and sell it for ten cents a pound set my trout lines and I didn't have no boat I'd swim out to the log get in the water river and still cold and put my bucket and I'm gonna have to read over here get on to the river and put my bucket a bait in there out there in the log and paddle and paddle like that and my naked body in the river in run and had me a string on the side tie my fish up see them old catfish fitting me in the legs going along they're like you know what catfish fitting is yeah hey man no calf it's got fins no stick them in you if they get close to him okay keep going next slide but look a mini at night when I had was out then that river eleven o'clock but look a Midianite I went out in that River at eleven o'clock and shake every bit of bait off that line if I couldn't catch enough in six days I didn't want the one that come on the seventh stood there in the rain one night I came just seeing myself yet standing there leaning against I was a sinner but I was standing leaning against the pole like this the door it was pouring down rain and pretty near eleven o'clock and I'd be late tonight but I'm going to spring every one of those traps I won't catch them on the Sabbath i said i won't i won't set them traps god honors that go ahead and do also do you teach that we must we must need not keep sunday or any whole holy day or working or like working and fishing on sunday i believe yours for the brand now i believe it's a sin to hunt to fish and hunt and work on sunday when you can go to church and i believe you're transgressing the laws of god if there's a commandment to session yes sir there is now in the old testament we had the type of the sabbath day is all right and then jesus did not come for you to keep the sabbath day days the old sabbath day was Saturday which was the end of the week sunday is the eighth day the first day of the week with Jesus rose on I do not believe it's right now if you're a way in a wilderness somewhere and you're out there and hunting trip and there's no church around you think like that and there's nothing you can do and if you're fishing I believe that would be all right and if you around in the city or around in the church is going on you should attend church you should attend church now that was further Brandon's convictions so what do you saying
