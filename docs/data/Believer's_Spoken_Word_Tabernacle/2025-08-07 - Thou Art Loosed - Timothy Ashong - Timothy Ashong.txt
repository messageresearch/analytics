Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's certainly worthy, isn't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. What grace that God has shown to our lives and what a liberty that he's brought and you know I thought of that song we were singing freedom to worship and um we were speaking we were speaking there in Texas and I said you know you have the two words of liberty and freedom. One of the brothers brought it up in the office and I said, you know, uh, in the the scripture when it says that that we come into that liberty as it speaks in 2 Corinthians 3, it says that they change from glory into glory. And that liberty, I said, you realize that word liberty is is to be whom God has ordained you to be as a son and daughter of God. We have received an authority in our lives. and and freedom. You know, many times we we hear the scripture quoted that he whom the son sets free and that's not the scripture. The scripture said he's who the son has made free &gt;&gt; is free indeed. &gt;&gt; And made is a creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He He just didn't loosen the cage. But there new creation moved on the inside by the spirit of God. And we're a new creation. That's why there's no tie back to the past because the the old man is dead. There's there's nothing there. The the new creation on the inside is tied in. Amen. So there's that that's that's such a such a liberty. It's a real freedom. Amen. In our lives, Amen. We're not looking back over our shoulders, but we are truly God's brought us into a place where now we're no longer the tail. We're the head. Amen. And that's why the prophet said, "As soon as you come into the promised land," he said, you watch your prayers change then. And so you begin to take things personal. And these are promises that God has equipped me to take. Amen. So, we're so glad to be in the house of the Lord here tonight. Amen. Glad to have brother Timothy with us. And we just want to go ahead and invite him to go ahead and come. Brother Timothy is a real friend. I've been a real brother and uh real blessing to to us as a as a local body. And so, we're thankful that uh you know, time making time to be with us each of the times he comes. and um you know he comes twice a year now to follow up on checkups and things like that because how God healed him of the of the cancer and so he's very very adamant within the every six months and so I'm just to me we're just blessed that he would take and make time out of his schedule to come by and visit us. Amen. So we we we just thank God for that. Brother Timothy's just been always just a real good friend and uh you know just a real wonderful minister of the gospel. Just just getting out of the way and just surrendering uh true evangelist, a man at heart. And so we just want to we we want to pull on the gift of God. God knows our needs tonight. And so we're not we're not new to this. We know that God knows our needs and we want to draw amen not from not from the man but from El Shadi and that God will step down and use that gift tonight and speak to our hearts. Amen. Are you glad? Are you happy to be a Christian? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's just if we could let's just sing that continue maybe singing that song. I bless your name. Oh, I bless your name.

So once again we greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and it's a privilege uh to be here and uh I came to see the doctor and uh he said everything is fine. Everything is on course &gt;&gt; so I'm fine. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Praise the Lord. Our God is good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's in charge. He's in control. Amen. And he cares for us. So once again, God bless you for coming to church and I thank our friend and pastor brother Sam for giving me this opportunity to be here and just to share fellowship. Uh we just love to encourage the people of God that uh we keep pressing on. &gt;&gt; One of these days the meeting will be in the air. &gt;&gt; There is going to be a meeting. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the air one of these days. Sweet by and by. Amen. &gt;&gt; What a day that will be. Praise the Lord. So let's read from the Gospel of St. Luke this evening. Luke chapter 13. Luke chapter 13. And let us read from verse 10. We read, "And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day. And behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity 18 years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself." And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him and said unto her, &gt;&gt; "Woman, thou art loosed from thy infirmity." &gt;&gt; And he laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight and glorify God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation because that Jesus has had healed on the Sabbath day and said unto the people, "There are six days in which men ought to work. In them, therefore, come and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day." And Jesus and the Lord then answered him and said, "Thou hypocrite." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I like that. Does not eat one of you on the Sabbath day lose his ox or his ass from the store and led him away to watering. And u not this woman being a daughter of Abraham, &gt;&gt; whom Satan have bound, lo this 18 years, be loose from this bound on the Sabbath day. And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed, &gt;&gt; and all the people rejoice for all the glorious things that were done by him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And all the people rejoice &gt;&gt; for all the glorious things. And may we also rejoice &gt;&gt; for the glorious things which is doing and has done for us. &gt;&gt; May God bless the reading of his word. Let's please be seated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's just you know to read the scripture is just wonderful. It's a blessing. Amen. And so just uh to just encourage ourselves on this uh uh story that we have read which was something that really happened in the course of our Lord Jesus earthly ministry. So the Bible said he went to one of the synagogues. &gt;&gt; So he always goes to he goes to church. &gt;&gt; I love that &gt;&gt; after he has gone round gone around gone round gone around he goes to church. So brother Brown said everybody must have a church home &gt;&gt; where you support the cause of God with your presence, with your tithe and with your offering. Amen. So Jesus when he was here, he went to church. &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us so. &gt;&gt; We remember one day when he went to church and they give him the scroll to read. &gt;&gt; And he took the scroll and he read &gt;&gt; and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled. &gt;&gt; And then he said, "You will tell me physician heal yourself." So they they make fun of him, mockery of him. Yeah. But he's the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he knows all about it. And no man's behavior surprises him. &gt;&gt; Nothing surpris He know what people will be doing. He knows all about it. And he knows all about us today. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he told us to be happy. &gt;&gt; Rejoice. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When men revide you and they say all kinds of evil things falsely against you, &gt;&gt; he said, "Rejoice. Rejoice. rejoice and be exceedingly &gt;&gt; glad. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It didn't say we should be sad. &gt;&gt; It said be exceedingly glad. Be happy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; For so persecuted then the prophets of old. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he told us in the scriptures those that will live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. &gt;&gt; So he said no matter what persecution we he said rejoice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So just to encourage ourselves this evening said women that at loose &gt;&gt; from thy infirmities &gt;&gt; women that at loose. Amen. And we are loosed. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You are loose. &gt;&gt; Loose by the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; For the blood of Jesus shall never lose his power. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And so Jesus went to church. &gt;&gt; He went to the synagogue. &gt;&gt; And then in the synagogue he said, "Behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity 18 years. &gt;&gt; 18 years and was bound. and she could not stretch up. &gt;&gt; She was in this kind of condition. &gt;&gt; But my joy is that in that condition, she was still going to church. &gt;&gt; She could have a lot of excuses &gt;&gt; not to go to church. Reason not to go to church. &gt;&gt; You all know that I'm not feeling fine. &gt;&gt; You all know that I'm not well. She could not raise herself. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Nobody would have blamed her if she was not going to church. &gt;&gt; But yet in that condition she was going to church. &gt;&gt; What will be our excuse? &gt;&gt; And then my joy is that she didn't even know that day Jesus will be there. That's right. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; It was not broadcast. It was not there anywhere. But she went to church. &gt;&gt; So she was not going to church for anything. She was going to church because it is an appointment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She has to be there with her presence &gt;&gt; to support the cause of God. And remember that God is not ungrateful. &gt;&gt; To forget our labor of love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe the devil might have told them, "What are you going to that same church today?" That's good. for this years ever years and years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes years yes &gt;&gt; you are still going to church in this condition &gt;&gt; it is always a blessing to go to church &gt;&gt; under any condition &gt;&gt; praise the Lord &gt;&gt; she was b and was bound together and could in no wise lift up herself She could in no wise lift up herself, but she was still going to church. &gt;&gt; What about that day if she had missed church service? &gt;&gt; What about that day if she didn't go to church? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She did not go there because she knew Jesus was coming. No, she went to church because it is it was part of her life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. That said, look, look, I love God. I love God. Whatever happens, I love him. &gt;&gt; And I got to go and I must go and I and she continue going. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't ever get tired. &gt;&gt; Let's keep coming to church. &gt;&gt; Let's keep serving the Lord. Hallelujah. Let's keep serving the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because God will not forget our labor of love. &gt;&gt; He will not do it. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it seems like he has forgotten, but he never forgets. &gt;&gt; He has a time. He has a plan. He has a purpose. &gt;&gt; For whatever he allows. Amen. Whatever happens to us, he has a purpose for it. &gt;&gt; And don't let the devil tell you that God don't love you. &gt;&gt; He has done this for this. He has done that for it. He has done this. What about you? &gt;&gt; Your time is coming. &gt;&gt; Your day is coming. &gt;&gt; Your hour is coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Saints of God, never never be discouraged. &gt;&gt; Don't ever be and don't don't give up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And don't let the enemy convince you that it's over. It's never over. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's because remember the prophet of God said, "Even in death, we are not defeated." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, they've been praying for me. We Yes. We believe in prayers. &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe God answers prayers. &gt;&gt; Amen. He does. &gt;&gt; And he does. And he does. And he will continue to answer our prayers. &gt;&gt; Because God is faithful. &gt;&gt; Oh, there are many things we don't understand, but he knows all about it. And because we don't understand, it's good for us to leave it in his care. &gt;&gt; Don't try to go with reason or take any man's explanation. just leave it in his care. I don't understand it. I leave it with you. &gt;&gt; Because he knows all about it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like I've said sometime listen sometime the devil would want you to believe that it's in vain to pray. &gt;&gt; It's in vain to serve God. It's in vain to go to church. But that's a lie. It's never in vain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And sometime so sometime God seems to be quiet &gt;&gt; as if he doesn't hear &gt;&gt; but he &gt;&gt; and when he's quiet that the prophet told us besetting of God &gt;&gt; when you have met his requirement and he says not he said just be besetting just like that widow over there is Zeraphat She was a good woman. She was a believer. She trusted in God. &gt;&gt; And then there was crisis. No food. And the rent was not coming and and the food was just left a little just just the last &gt;&gt; and God came in at that time. Amen. &gt;&gt; When he was at the wit end that God came in there, &gt;&gt; you know, God had told he had told Elijah at that time to go to the brook sheriff and then he said the rabbies will be feeding you and and then he was drinking from the water here and there. Look, God could have kept Elijah there. &gt;&gt; And he would have given him water to drink. Right. &gt;&gt; If the birds were giving food, they would have continued to give him food. &gt;&gt; But God knew that woman was there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That woman was crying. God knew that woman was praying. She was faithful. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometime as if God doesn't see, he doesn't hear, but he sees and he hears and he knows everything about every one of us. So don't just give up. &gt;&gt; Help is on the way coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Deliverance is on the way coming. &gt;&gt; Manifestation is already coming because the price has already been paid. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then God told Elijah, "Now leave here. Go to Zeraphat." &gt;&gt; What did God say? I have commanded a widow woman. &gt;&gt; I've already done it. Right. &gt;&gt; The widow who didn't have anything, God said, "I have commanded her &gt;&gt; to feed you, to take care of you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Elijah started going. We know the story anyway. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God never forgets. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; God never forsakes. &gt;&gt; God is mindful. &gt;&gt; And these things are written for us. &gt;&gt; That's right. is for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For our learning, &gt;&gt; for us to be admonished, for us not to lose our faith, &gt;&gt; for us to believe, for us to trust the Lord. That's why it's written there for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It happened there so that you and I will be blessed. So that in our hour of need, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and frustration and difficult time, we can look back say, "Oh, God did it there. &gt;&gt; He did it there." &gt;&gt; When all hope seems to be finished &gt;&gt; when everything seems to be falling apart, when it seems that God came on the scene, &gt;&gt; the prophet tested a woman. He said, "Give me some water to drink." She was okay. It's okay. I'm just picking this two sticks and I'm going to prepare food so that um me and my son will eat in there. So said don't worry, just give me my own face. Oh, &gt;&gt; give me your first stranger. I don't even know where you are coming from. &gt;&gt; How do I give it? He said anyway. And she did it &gt;&gt; and then thus say yes the Lord &gt;&gt; the oil and the meal will not finish &gt;&gt; until the day God will send rain upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Hey &gt;&gt; our God is alive. &gt;&gt; Our Lord is alive. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; May God strengthen your faith. &gt;&gt; May God help us to believe. &gt;&gt; What was said about that widow woman, the Zerapat, just a poor woman, a believer. &gt;&gt; She trusted in God just like any of us here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So God can do anything &gt;&gt; anytime, &gt;&gt; anywhere. under any condition. &gt;&gt; He can change any condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May you be loosed from your unbelief. &gt;&gt; To be loose is to be free. &gt;&gt; To be released, to be untied. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like Jesus speaking to the disciples when he was uh uh going to Jerusalem for the uh um Passover and then he tell them that okay you go to this town when you enter that way you will see an act that is tied on losing &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; unting &gt;&gt; losing &gt;&gt; when you are tired you cannot operate &gt;&gt; you cannot move &gt;&gt; but Jesus said go and lose it &gt;&gt; and bring it to me &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; hallelujah lose him and bring it to me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you are loose, you are free. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You are loose. You are delivered. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like Jesus said when Lazarus was raised from the dead said lose him and let him go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he say he was covered with grave clothes all over said lose him. &gt;&gt; Let him go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Woo. And I was thinking the other day I said, "Man, we are loose. We were loose to lose people." &gt;&gt; What is Jesus say? Whatever you bind on earth, I bind in heaven. &gt;&gt; Whoever you lose on earth, I lose it. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So he give it the power to bind and to lose. &gt;&gt; So before you be able to lose others, you have to be loose. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So he lose us. &gt;&gt; So that we can lose others. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. He said, "Woman, you are loose." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Listen, the blood loses. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, &gt;&gt; "The greatest weapon ever put in the hands of man is the Bible." right? &gt;&gt; To be backed to be backed up with the Holy Ghost that Jesus died at Calvary to flee to free his church. &gt;&gt; He died at Calvary to flee the church &gt;&gt; from superstitions and fear and doubts &gt;&gt; and trembling. He died to free us &gt;&gt; from superstitions. &gt;&gt; To free us from fear. Brother told us fear is a curse. &gt;&gt; And the people who always living in fear, fear of death. Fear of no no. He said fear not let &gt;&gt; don't fear. &gt;&gt; Every time it comes on the said don't fear. No matter how the situation might be, &gt;&gt; no matter what the proclamation or declaration of the doctors or whatever around us, no, he said, "Don't fear &gt;&gt; because I can change the situation. &gt;&gt; I am able." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The God of Daniel is still alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. when they were taking Daniel and they just throw him into a lion's den &gt;&gt; just because he was praying just because oh my God brother said no matter how righteous no matter how good a person living for Christ and he does nothing but good Satan will still show his hatred because Daniel was just a good person he was just helping people he was helping the kingdom and yet they were against him &gt;&gt; that's Right? &gt;&gt; And because of his righteous life, &gt;&gt; because he refused to go against the word of the Lord, &gt;&gt; they were against him. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; And because of that, they arrested him because they didn't want him to go to church. They didn't want him to pray. They didn't want He said, "I will do it." Because it was part of his life. He knew they will come after him. &gt;&gt; But he also believed that God is able to deliver him. &gt;&gt; And so when they came upon him and they took him and then oh even the king knew that these people were just against Daniel. &gt;&gt; He knew it. &gt;&gt; He was sad. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the king prayed for Daniel. The king who signed the book he prayed for Daniel. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh Daniel, &gt;&gt; servant of the most high God, &gt;&gt; servant of the living God, &gt;&gt; sir, &gt;&gt; may your God &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Whom you faithfully serve, &gt;&gt; oh &gt;&gt; whom you faithfully serve, &gt;&gt; may your God deliver you &gt;&gt; from the lions, &gt;&gt; this was the prayer of his enemy, &gt;&gt; the king that signed the paper. That king said was praying against his own law. &gt;&gt; What he has done, he was praying against it. That though when I said nothing can change it. But this one let him be changed. &gt;&gt; Let something supernatural happen. &gt;&gt; The king was expecting something supernatural &gt;&gt; because the laws of the metrop cannot be changed. &gt;&gt; But there is a God in heaven &gt;&gt; that controls all things &gt;&gt; that can change any law and any rule. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That can go beyond anything. &gt;&gt; No matter what declaration, no matter who said it, &gt;&gt; oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So the key it said, Daniel, may your God deliver you. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said when they went away, he could not sleep. &gt;&gt; The king could not sleep. &gt;&gt; And Daniel was having a good time among the lions in the in the m That is the God we are serving. &gt;&gt; And do you know who is praying for you today? Do you know who is praying for you today? &gt;&gt; Somebody is praying for you. &gt;&gt; Somebody somewhere that you don't know &gt;&gt; is praying for you. The Bible says, "And the spirit prayeth on our behalf." &gt;&gt; We've grown that cannot be understood &gt;&gt; because that knows the mind of God. The mind of the spirit, &gt;&gt; the mind of God and it interceds on your behalf. So somebody is praying for us. &gt;&gt; Jesus pray for us. &gt;&gt; He said, "Father, that you keep them." Hallelujah. And because Jesus prayed for us, nothing can touch us. &gt;&gt; Because Jesus said, "Father, I know you always hears me." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, praise the Lord. So Jesus has prayed for you. &gt;&gt; He has prayed for us. &gt;&gt; And because he has prayed for us, we will make it. &gt;&gt; We will make it. Whether the devil like it or not, &gt;&gt; we will make it. &gt;&gt; Good like it would, it doesn't, that's not our business. &gt;&gt; Jesus pray for the church. &gt;&gt; And because he pray for us, &gt;&gt; we will go through. He will see us through. &gt;&gt; Somebody give a clap of him to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Woo. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He died. He gave us the Bible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why we have to read this Bible. &gt;&gt; Read the Bible. He told Joshua, "Don't move from this one." &gt;&gt; The word that Moses give to you, don't move from it. &gt;&gt; No matter whoever says anything against it, you leave those people. &gt;&gt; Whoever criticize Moses, you leave it. Right? &gt;&gt; You all that I want you to do is don't depart to the left or to the right. &gt;&gt; Don't try to put any interpretation to it. &gt;&gt; Just leave it the way it is. &gt;&gt; And I just love it. Read that Joshua chapter one and see how many times God was telling Joshua, be very courageous. &gt;&gt; Be courageous. &gt;&gt; Be of good courage. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be easy. You are going to have challenges. You are going to have to but be of good courage. &gt;&gt; Be of good courage. &gt;&gt; Read it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Write that please. How many times God was telling Joshua, be courageous. Be of good courage. Be very courageous. &gt;&gt; Church. May God help us &gt;&gt; to be very courageous. &gt;&gt; Don't just give up. Don't be afraid. Be courageous. There is no virtue in fear. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No. Just be courageous. Cast down reasons. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Bible say when the king went away, he was fasting through the night. He was praying. &gt;&gt; Save Daniel. God of Daniel, save Daniel. &gt;&gt; God of Daniel, save Daniel. Daniel is your faithful servant. Oh, they knew &gt;&gt; that Daniel was a faithful servant. He he said, "Daniel, servant of the living God, the most high God, &gt;&gt; may your God whom you faithfully serve, &gt;&gt; may that God deliver you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the king as God answered the prayer of the king. &gt;&gt; The king that signed that decree and they know that the decrees cannot be changed. God answered his prayer. Listen, the Bible said early in the morning, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He went to the the the the the cave, &gt;&gt; the king, he could not sleep &gt;&gt; before anybody got up. &gt;&gt; He believed his prayers. &gt;&gt; He was expecting a miracle. &gt;&gt; He was expecting something to happen. &gt;&gt; And he went to the cave and he was with lame voice. down here. Servant of the living God, &gt;&gt; servant of the most high God, &gt;&gt; as your God &gt;&gt; whom you have been faithfully serving, &gt;&gt; has he been able to save you from the lions? &gt;&gt; Then he was shall God be able to say, "Oh, king &gt;&gt; live forever." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; King live forever. My God &gt;&gt; sent his angels. &gt;&gt; My God sent his angel &gt;&gt; and they shut the mouth of the lions. &gt;&gt; Oh, I am here with the lions. I am alive. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. God answered the prayer of the king. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the king was just Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because he heard the voice of Daniel. And then they said, "My God has done it. &gt;&gt; My God has done it." Oh king. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Take quickly. Take away the stone. Take away the blockage. Everything. Daniel, come out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When they thought he was defeated, &gt;&gt; he came out triumphantly. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said when they think the message is defeated, &gt;&gt; that's where the victory is coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; People think when they left the message, oh the message will collapse. Collapse what? &gt;&gt; Then everybody will leave the message. No, &gt;&gt; you leave somebody coming. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because you must just be a carer. That's right. &gt;&gt; Carrying the seed. &gt;&gt; Transporting the seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Nobody can stop. Nobody can quench that fire that God started. God lighted it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; When we were young people believe this message and some of the parents said that your church the laws are too many. You don't wear hearing your women don't do this. It's too many laws. But listen, we were happy. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; What they were complaining about, we had not complain about that. &gt;&gt; And your the loss in your church is too. We have not asked you to come. &gt;&gt; We are enjoying our own law. We are enjoying our message. We are happy with our message. And you are sitting behind and they were complaining the law is too you have too many laws. What was it? &gt;&gt; Don't wear trouser. Don't paint your face. Don't do this. Because God says so &gt;&gt; and they were feeling sad for us. &gt;&gt; We are happy. &gt;&gt; If you are here &gt;&gt; and it is a force on you, &gt;&gt; then you better go out &gt;&gt; because it is a joy for us &gt;&gt; to know the mind of God &gt;&gt; that this is what God want us to do. &gt;&gt; This is the life he want us to live. It should not be difficult for you when the Holy Ghost comes and dwelt in you. It will not be difficult for you to pull down your trouser or your pants as a woman. &gt;&gt; Now sometime I look at I said sometime I see sisters with cute all this makeup and they try to do it light and I said listen do it well. Put red on. Don't just put white paint here so that people will not see it. Put red so that we see and know how to pray for you. Because who do you want to hide it from? &gt;&gt; Do you want to hide it from me? &gt;&gt; Look at up. &gt;&gt; Look up. &gt;&gt; May God help us. &gt;&gt; We are loose. Amen. &gt;&gt; Church, we are loose. The blood lose us. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. We are no more in bondage. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Christ set us free. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. loose. &gt;&gt; Free from superstitions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Free from fear. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. For me to live is Christ and to die is gain. &gt;&gt; Free &gt;&gt; from worry &gt;&gt; because there is no virtue in worrying. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no, no. Why do I worry? Oh Jesus. Brother Brown said, "If I even know I'm going to die tomorrow, the next hour, I said, I'm not going to worry &gt;&gt; because it will not do any good for me." &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Did the prophet say so? &gt;&gt; He said, "But I will have faith." Because faith can sign my pardon. &gt;&gt; Listen, it is not what you think is right &gt;&gt; or what you feel is right. &gt;&gt; It is what God says is right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That is what is right. Right. &gt;&gt; So the mind of God came to the prophet. &gt;&gt; So the word have come to straighten us, to straighten our thoughts, &gt;&gt; to straighten our thinking, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; To correct our minds. &gt;&gt; Do you get that? &gt;&gt; Like um I talk about anas that came to pray for Paul, Saul at that time. And then uh when the Lord spoke to Ana said there is a man here called Saul he's in this house here and there he's praying go and pray for him go to and then I said Lord please I have heard many things about that man &gt;&gt; see that man has been persecuting the church that man has been doing this and that God said &gt;&gt; that man is a choosing vessel &gt;&gt; whatever he has done whatever he has been doing that man is a choosing vessel. Go and pray for him. &gt;&gt; And and what I love about it is when Anas got to where Saul was, you know what he did? You know how he he addressed he said, "Brother Saul, &gt;&gt; sir, &gt;&gt; he said, "Brother Saul, &gt;&gt; why?" The word corrected him. &gt;&gt; The word corrects error. Amen. &gt;&gt; So whatever you think today, &gt;&gt; whatever anybody says today, we don't take it or we take what the prophet said on it. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the message has come to correct us. &gt;&gt; To straighten us &gt;&gt; to teach us what is right that this is the right way of God. This is what God has approved. That is why when we went into forc baptisms and false teachings in the prophet came those in the word we were blinded to it &gt;&gt; were bound by denominations &gt;&gt; some people are still bound today &gt;&gt; they are not free they become slaves to the church they they cannot express themselves but then God sent a prophet &gt;&gt; and he came to us and he straightened us that listen God is no three father Holy Ghost doesn't make three gods. &gt;&gt; It takes a person, a personality, not three persons. One person &gt;&gt; who manifested himself in this fatherhood dispensation, a sunship and the Holy Ghost is one God. &gt;&gt; Father is not a name. &gt;&gt; Son is not a name. Holy Ghost is not a name. The name is Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because when Jesus was on earth, he was preaching. and said listen I came in my father's name &gt;&gt; if he came in his father's name and he's called Jesus that is the name of the father &gt;&gt; so the word come to straighten our thoughts &gt;&gt; the word comes to correct us &gt;&gt; may God give grace as the word comes we drop our ideas &gt;&gt; we drop our thinkings we drop our feelings &gt;&gt; and take Gossip. &gt;&gt; Listen, that's what has been all throughout the scriptures. When the angel met Mary and the angel spoke to her and told her what can what was going to happen. He said, "How can this be?" &gt;&gt; This has never happened before. I've never read it anywhere before. &gt;&gt; And the angel said, "The Holy Ghost will come upon you." &gt;&gt; The power of the shall come upon you and therefore that only thing which shall be shall come out of your womb shall be called the son of God. Mary said, "Be it unto me &gt;&gt; according to your word." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the word strengthen her. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; May the word straighten us. &gt;&gt; May the word position us &gt;&gt; because that's what the word is saying to position us, &gt;&gt; to strengthen us, to make us know who we are. &gt;&gt; So good. Do you remember in that when God made the first woman, she didn't know who she was, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; She didn't even know her name. She had no she didn't know anything. When Adam say woman, he didn't call her. It's hey another creature in the garden. He has seen all other where is from this one. Adam might have said who are you? She said I don't know. Where do you come from? I don't know. What's your name? I don't know. And Adam look at there by the spirit of revelation. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Because Adam was asleep. &gt;&gt; He was asleep. He didn't know where that woman came from. &gt;&gt; God did the first surgical operation. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He did surgery in the garden. &gt;&gt; So when they talk about surgery, don't be afraid. God did it first. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So good. So that we hear about no don't be afraid &gt;&gt; until God has finished with us. &gt;&gt; Nothing can take us out of here. &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; Listen, this is the mind of God. This is not the mind of William Brham. &gt;&gt; This is the mind of this is the word of God to us. &gt;&gt; And the word is here to straighten us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To set us free from superstitions. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. From the ideas of men, &gt;&gt; from your own reasons, &gt;&gt; from the way we have been brought up, &gt;&gt; what we have been taught to be right, &gt;&gt; God's welcome to tell her this is right. &gt;&gt; What your parent taught you, what the church taught you, what this one taught you, what denomination taught you, this is what God says. God's word, the correct interpretation comes to a prophet. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We are going. &gt;&gt; Nothing will stop us. &gt;&gt; No power can stop us. &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; We are on our way to glory land. &gt;&gt; We are on our way to the promised land. &gt;&gt; Woman, you are loose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. I'm so glad that that woman went to church that day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Like this &gt;&gt; maybe with a stick &gt;&gt; and Jesus saw her &gt;&gt; maybe. Look at her faithfulness that in this condition she was able to come to church. And Jesus looked and said, "Come, &gt;&gt; come, sister, come, &gt;&gt; lady." He spoke the word. &gt;&gt; When he saw her, he said, "Woman, &gt;&gt; you are loosed." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Bam. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Woo. And she just straighten up. Think about it. &gt;&gt; She's She got her. She's straightening up. The power of the spoken word. &gt;&gt; Remember, it's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Remember, as you are hearing the word of the Lord, demons are being casted. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hummon spirit are casted out. &gt;&gt; All powers of darkness is broken down. &gt;&gt; Sin is cast out. &gt;&gt; Satan is losing the battle. We are on the winning side. &gt;&gt; Church, you are lose. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; I will not take much of your time, but I'm feeling very good. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know the prophet spoke about Johnny crow, little crow that was caught by a farmer and the farmer died and the crow just hoping around. Yes. And so he says one good man, some good man, good fellow come and he says, "Sir, please let this crow go. You don't blame me because he's a crow. That's the only way it can eat, survive is to pick from your farm. So let it go." So that good man spoke on behalf of the crow and it's okay. He set the crow free. He cut it caught the line. He caught the string. And the other best came out. He say is coming let's go. &gt;&gt; No I cannot. &gt;&gt; He say you are loose and no I cannot go. &gt;&gt; That good man Jesus &gt;&gt; on Calvary. &gt;&gt; He cut the line broken. &gt;&gt; He cut the line loose. &gt;&gt; We were bound in sin. We were bound with all kinds of habit. All kinds of diseases. All kinds of worries, all kinds of old things. And then Jesus on Calvary. &gt;&gt; Caught that link. Caught the rope. &gt;&gt; We that once were slave. We were once under the devil once being ruled by the power of the prince of the power of the air that we could not help ourselves. We were slaves and he was driving ush. And he was driving ush. And he was driving us. &gt;&gt; Amen. That good man, the Lord Jesus that day on Calvary C the line, broke the line. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said you are free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are free. &gt;&gt; No, you are free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Unto him that love us &gt;&gt; and wash us from our sins. unto him be the glory. &gt;&gt; The prophet speaking here, Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the first begotten of the dead. He said, now unto him that love us and wash us from our sins in his own blood. The word wash there actually in the Greek means to lose. He lost from our We were tied to the earth by our sin. &gt;&gt; We couldn't see. We couldn't hear. Had no conception of heaven or nothing. &gt;&gt; We had no conception of heaven or nothing. But when the blood came down, it cut the line &gt;&gt; and we got loose. &gt;&gt; When the blood came down, it cut the line &gt;&gt; and we were loose. &gt;&gt; Hey, we are no more exposed to sale. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We are out of the pound shop. &gt;&gt; He paid the price. to get us out of that place. &gt;&gt; We are lose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't care. You think I'm crazy. That's okay. I don't care about what you think. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He caught a lie and we got loose. &gt;&gt; And the prophet bring a farmer caught a crow and tied him. And he said, "I will teach the other crows a lesson." So he tied the crow, the old crow and by a leg with a string, a string and um and the poor old thing like star to death. He was so weak he could hardly walk around. That's what some of these organizations and churches &gt;&gt; has tied the people down. &gt;&gt; Oh just can't. Well, this is all the further you can go. Days of miracle is passed. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you are just tired. That's all. There is no such a thing as the Holy Ghost. And he don't speak in tonges like he used to. &gt;&gt; He is God. He's just the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Listen church. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Don't just sit down here and think well the days of William is gone. This is the days of the bride. &gt;&gt; Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday. &gt;&gt; The same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So it was not William Brown that did it. It was the Holy Ghost that did it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost is here. &gt;&gt; If the Holy Ghost can get a surrounded vessel &gt;&gt; that we believe in, &gt;&gt; that will trust in the Holy Ghost. That's why it is the book of the Holy Ghost. The art of the Holy Ghost in the apostles. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; The book of us. Brother Bran said it is the art of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; in the apostles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost is still as many as the Lord our God shall call. &gt;&gt; If God is calling, God is healing, God is doing the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Yes, church. He's the same. &gt;&gt; So don't come to a place to say, well, I will die in this condition. Me, I will not die in that condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if the devil tell you, yeah, this No, no, no, no. Hallelujah. God can change any condition. &gt;&gt; God can do anything. &gt;&gt; Hey, hey, don't limit Jehovah. Hey, the book of Psalms 78 is the children of Israel, they limited the most high God. They said, "He gave us this. He gave us this. He He gave us this. Can he also do this?" &gt;&gt; Okay, you open the Red Sea. Can he give us water? We We want water. Can he give us fresh? The children of Israel. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And they limited the most high God. &gt;&gt; Don't limit Jehovah. Right. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the same. The Bible say he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; And the Bible say I am God &gt;&gt; and I change not. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Woo. Glory to God. Hey, you are loose already. &gt;&gt; Church, you are loose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Woman is a type of the church. Say, woman, you are loose. &gt;&gt; Church, you are loose. &gt;&gt; We are loose to believe Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. We are loose to believe that he's the same yesterday. We are loosed to believe that he's here. He said, "Where two or three are gathered in my name, I'll be dead." We are loose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. It's just the same yesterday, today, and forever. living in all the churches. We'll get to it after the setting of this in the morning. He said God is uh he God is God that lives in every church age. He will live in every church age and will live in his people for eternity. &gt;&gt; God is living now in his people. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; He's not in his people. &gt;&gt; He's choosing people. is still why why you are you looking at me like that when you have the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; you know what it is that's God &gt;&gt; that's God in you &gt;&gt; Amen that's the word oh &gt;&gt; that's what the message has come to teach us &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost is not another being &gt;&gt; it's not a second person or third person it is God himself Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said Jesus when he was here, he had the spirit without &gt;&gt; measure. &gt;&gt; The fullness of the godhead bodily was in Christ. &gt;&gt; But each and every one of us has a portion of it. &gt;&gt; And what did the prophet said? If you take where if you are there where they were making this water or little part of the ocean and you take it just this full of this ocean take the ocean &gt;&gt; that this quality that you have quantity you have here &gt;&gt; has every potential &gt;&gt; has every quality &gt;&gt; everything that is in the big ocean is here or I take this small water here &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; what is here is the same quality quality. &gt;&gt; It's the same quality. &gt;&gt; It is only &gt;&gt; this is a little measure. This is little this full &gt;&gt; but it's the same quality. &gt;&gt; So when we have the Holy Ghost, it is the same quality &gt;&gt; that they had on the day of Pentecost that was in Christ is divided into the church today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So remember this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother said, "Dity is in you." &gt;&gt; Are you trying to reason? Drop your reason. &gt;&gt; Don't question the word. &gt;&gt; The word says so. &gt;&gt; And that is for us to know who we are. It is to position us. &gt;&gt; To stop our forget about your superstitions, &gt;&gt; right? Cast down your reasons &gt;&gt; and let us take what the word says &gt;&gt; because we are the word made flesh today. &gt;&gt; Hey, you must accept yeah what is this said? A pardon is not a pardon &gt;&gt; until it is accepted. &gt;&gt; So if you don't accept it, you still live in bondage. When he loses, we be lose. &gt;&gt; You have to accept it that he lose me. &gt;&gt; You walk into it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said now the cross scram they try to call, hey brother, you are loose. Let's go. Just like we are trying to do today. You are loose church. You are loose brother. Nah. Huh? You will stay in that condition. until you accept what God has done. &gt;&gt; And this good man, he took his knife and cut the crow loose. And you know, here come the other crows come over and said, "Come on, Johnny Crow. Let's go, S. Cold weather is coming." You know what? The crow will just go as far as he could go out there. Said, "I can't do it. It's not It's just not for us this day. &gt;&gt; We just can't do it. We can do it. &gt;&gt; We can do it. &gt;&gt; I can do all things through God that strengthens me." We can do it. &gt;&gt; It's not by our might. It's not by our power. It is by the Holy Ghost. What is the commission? We got a commission. &gt;&gt; The church got a commission. Go in my name. &gt;&gt; Castle devils in my name. &gt;&gt; Pray for the sick in my name. Whatever you bind on the earth, I bind it in heaven. &gt;&gt; Whatever you lose on the earth, I lose it in heaven. &gt;&gt; So he gave the commission to the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are just looking at yourself. Me? Yes, brother. Tell you talk about a little policeman. &gt;&gt; No matter who that can be a drunker, can be this and that that that. But when he join that force and he wears that uniform, &gt;&gt; everything changes. the people that look at him and dispatch him. When they see that uniform, you are driving on the road and you see the police car, your driving change, you check your speedometer, you apply your brakes because there's a policeman sometime is right behind you &gt;&gt; and you become a gentle driver &gt;&gt; because policeman is behind you &gt;&gt; and you are careful not to go against the law. In fact, you reduce to go below &gt;&gt; because policeman is there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that they will be laughing at us. They know what we are doing. &gt;&gt; They know how we drive. &gt;&gt; So when you slow down, you become so gentle. They'll be laughing. Listen, &gt;&gt; when the devil sees you, &gt;&gt; he knows who &gt;&gt; but sometime we don't know who we are. We forget who we are. &gt;&gt; Church, may God help us. &gt;&gt; When God give you commission, he gave us commission. &gt;&gt; Is waiting on the church. is waiting on us to accept it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Wow. He had been tied so long until he thought he was still tied. &gt;&gt; And that's the way with a lot of people. You are tied down with crits and denominations from old mother prostitute back there. there telling you Jesus Christ isn't the same and there is no such a thing as healing. There is no baptism of the Holy Ghost. There is none of this stuff like that. Trying to tell them you've been tied so long till you still think you are tied. &gt;&gt; The good man Christ gave his blood that he might wash us and lose us from our sin. What is sin? I will ask anybody to tell me what is sin is unbelief. &gt;&gt; Unbelief. That's what is killing us. &gt;&gt; Unbelief is killing us &gt;&gt; or we say we believe. Unbelief is killing us &gt;&gt; because we are reasoning with God's word. And that is the only sin there is is unbelief. &gt;&gt; Because instead of us to look at him, we are looking at ourselves. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Listen, the prophet said in the Old Testament, you know, the first bones belongs to God, &gt;&gt; he said, so if they give birth to a donkey and they squeeze like this, like this, he said, and they have to kill it, &gt;&gt; start knock it, he said the woman will say, don't worry, you are donkey, you are not good, but something good is standing for you. An innocent, blameless lamb. &gt;&gt; He said, listen, yes, I'm not good. You are not good. But look at the sacrifice. This sacrifice is coming in your place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because God made that provision. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not by works of righteousness that we are done. &gt;&gt; It's by his grace. So brother Brown said don't look at yourself. &gt;&gt; Look at your sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A perfect sacrifice &gt;&gt; on my behalf. On our behalf. We are free. &gt;&gt; We are loose. We are delivered because Jesus shed the blood to lose you today &gt;&gt; as a son of God. As a daughter of God, you are loose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From superstitions and evil forces. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. He said now he has washed us and lose us from our denomination in his own in his own blood and has made us free so we can think for ourself. &gt;&gt; And talk for ourself and act for ourself. &gt;&gt; Hey, the blind boy that was made blind, Jesus opened his eyes. He was born blind. And the Pharisees put fear in everybody, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And they called the mother, the parents, is that your son? Yes, please. Yes, pastor. &gt;&gt; How come that is saying? We don't know. He said because the Pharisees have won. &gt;&gt; Anybody that confess Jesus will be casted out. &gt;&gt; Your name will be cancelled from the church. &gt;&gt; And they love the church. He said of the word of the Lord. Oh. And then they came back to the blind boy who was blind and now his eyes was open. Were you born blind? Yes sir. How come that you are seeing? It's a man called Jesus. &gt;&gt; Made clear. Put it on my eyes and now I can see. Oh, give glory to God. That man is a sinner. I don't care about that. All that I know is that once I was blind, &gt;&gt; but now I can see. &gt;&gt; Why? He was loose. &gt;&gt; He was free &gt;&gt; to speak for himself &gt;&gt; to stand for himself. To testify of the goodness of the Lord. post stood before a gripper. He said, "I'm glad that I will speak for myself." He was loose. &gt;&gt; When God does something for you, when God loses you, you don't care about nobody. &gt;&gt; You will testify. &gt;&gt; You will worship him. You will sing. &gt;&gt; You will clap. Oh, some of us, we come to church, even you can't say amen. &gt;&gt; All right. You can say amen. &gt;&gt; Oh God have mercy. And the word comes to you can you cannot rejoice. Oh there is something about the word. David said restore to me the joy of my salvation. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; There is joy of salvation. &gt;&gt; There is joy. There is joy. Hallelujah. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. When you see me jump I got to jump. Because sometime I told you I could not even lift my leg feet up like this. I could not I could not move from here to there. They have to carry me and when the son has loose me. Hallelujah. When he has set me free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I don't care about anybody here. &gt;&gt; I am free. &gt;&gt; Free to worship. &gt;&gt; Free to testify. Free to glorify him. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Woo. Okay. Okay. Let's try and get this one and get out of here. Woo. Revelation 15. Unto him that love us and wash us from our sins in his own blood. The word wash is actually loosed. Lose us from our sins in his own blood. &gt;&gt; Okay. The prophet said, "Isn't that wonderful?" &gt;&gt; But are you spiritual minded? Did you catch it? It was his own blood that lose us &gt;&gt; completely. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said what? Completely. &gt;&gt; We are loose completely &gt;&gt; by the blood. &gt;&gt; We are no man the bondage of sin and death. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are loose completely. &gt;&gt; I am loose completely. &gt;&gt; And the true believer is loosed completely. &gt;&gt; If you're a true believer, the blood loses you completely. &gt;&gt; From our sins, listen, it was not human blood. It was the blood of God. &gt;&gt; Peter called it the blood of Christ. Paul called it the blood of the Lord and the blood of Jesus. Not three persons but one person. There is that revelation again. One God. &gt;&gt; That omnipotent Jehovah God came down and made itself a body by the midst of the virgin birth and end it that it might be the blood of God that lose us &gt;&gt; that will lose us. Lose us entirely. out lose us entirely. &gt;&gt; This is good for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. From our sins and presented scatterless &gt;&gt; before himself with exceedingly great joy. &gt;&gt; Will you like an Old Testament type? Let us go back to the Garden of Eden. When the first news came to glory that the son Adam had fallen lost has been lost. &gt;&gt; Did God send an angel? Did he send a son? Did he send another one like unto us? No. He came himself &gt;&gt; to redeem that lost son. Hallelujah. God did not entrust &gt;&gt; his plan of salvation to another. &gt;&gt; He trusted only himself. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; God was made flesh and dwelt among us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And redeem us unto himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are saved by the blood of God. &gt;&gt; The eternal God indwelt a mortal body in order to take away sin. He became the lamb in order to shed his blood &gt;&gt; and enter into the veil with it. &gt;&gt; Consider this. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Consider this." Hallelujah. Consider this. Since it is the blood of God, it is perfect blood. &gt;&gt; And if the perfect blood is loosening us from the power and bondage and definement of sin, then the loosening is perfect and complete. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The looseness is perfect and complete. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord help us. &gt;&gt; There is not therefore no condemnation. Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? &gt;&gt; It is God that justifies. &gt;&gt; Declares righteous. Who is he that condemnth? It is Christ that died. &gt;&gt; Romans 3, Romans 8:33,34. There is now. There it is. is death gave us the blood. The blood has loosed us. There is now no condemnation. How can there be?
