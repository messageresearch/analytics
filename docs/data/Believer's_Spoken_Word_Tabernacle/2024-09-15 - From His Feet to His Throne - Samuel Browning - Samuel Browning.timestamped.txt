[38:21] God Amen and it's truly his word that
[38:24] has made us what we are it's brought out
[38:28] of our Lives what he knew lay there the
[38:30] whole time and through all the tests and
[38:33] trials you know there's really there's
[38:35] no other way that we could be molded
[38:37] more In His Image than through the tests
[38:40] and trials that he permits us to go
[38:44] through the the hearing of the word the
[38:46] ministry of the word is so important to
[38:48] our lives it it brings God brings birth
[38:52] he brings Deliverance he'll bring
[38:53] healing and he'll bring
[38:56] encouragement you know sometimes when we
[38:58] walk in here we would love to be where
[39:00] we walk out of here the trial's gone but
[39:03] instead we walk in and God just
[39:05] encourages and said hey before the
[39:08] foundation of the world you were in my
[39:10] mind your your destiny is certain right
[39:14] and it and it helps us to get our eyes
[39:16] just to look to him that through the
[39:18] midst of it amen amen that's that that
[39:21] to me is what's so precious I found that
[39:24] true very many times how that God just
[39:27] take maybe a text and uh I've watched
[39:30] him do it and it just come right down
[39:32] and I think my I I know it this is my
[39:34] this is my moment right here this is God
[39:36] speaking to my heart the child didn't go
[39:39] away but he gave me strength Amen to go
[39:42] through it because when it all comes
[39:45] when it all comes out at the end of it
[39:47] it's going to be more of him and less of
[39:50] us and really there could be no other
[39:52] way and so amen we sing that song with a
[39:55] real revelation
[39:57] there amen it's good to be in the house
[40:00] of the Lord is't it amen we um I'm going
[40:04] to let you have your seats here just for
[40:05] a moment
[40:06] because we have a uh special guest he
[40:10] was here last
[40:12] weekend and uh then we had to wait for
[40:17] everything to kind of get lined up and
[40:20] good to also to have um Chuck and Joanne
[40:23] here with us as well uh brother joshu's
[40:25] parents and um
[40:28] so we are so thankful amen for little
[40:31] Steven amen as God has
[40:33] [Applause]
[40:39] given so we want to uh just dedicate him
[40:43] to the Lord here just at this time and
[40:46] we know that that's that's exactly what
[40:48] the Lord had given us in his word to do
[40:51] remember when the disciples you know
[40:54] they they were bringing the little
[40:57] children and the disciples don't don't
[40:59] don't bother don't trouble and and Jesus
[41:02] would take that and even express of what
[41:05] it must be like for us to enter into the
[41:07] kingdom of God and the kingdom of heaven
[41:10] and so he would speak of that and say
[41:12] suffer them not to come unto me for such
[41:16] amen is the kingdom amen so we uh we
[41:19] realize that what we are doing God has
[41:21] entrusted that life to
[41:23] us uh and God knew all of these things
[41:26] how he could so he would order and bring
[41:28] everything and our paths across and God
[41:31] so ordered that and I always go back to
[41:33] that moment of where with
[41:36] Samson and uh and his his father uh
[41:40] manoah and his wife when they asked the
[41:44] Lord uh you show us what we must do on
[41:48] how to raise this child because God
[41:52] knows the order that he has for our
[41:54] lives and you know we we realize that we
[41:57] and
[41:58] ourselves we have a part to play even as
[42:00] parents to do our part that what God
[42:03] would give us as as uh the wisdom and
[42:06] the knowledge but I'm glad he gives it
[42:09] and then he's the one that directs it
[42:10] he's the one that sees them all the way
[42:12] through if we just do just do our part
[42:14] to look to him then God himself will
[42:17] continue to watch over that life just
[42:19] like Moses was watched over in denal is
[42:22] that right he was watched over until it
[42:25] came to that moment for that purpose and
[42:28] and so I think of that's what a
[42:30] wonderful thing it is to be able to come
[42:32] and to just uh dedicate the life that
[42:36] God has given and dedicate it back to
[42:38] him and with that dedication it's a real
[42:41] expression that
[42:42] Lord I I completely am committed to
[42:48] raising this child in the admonition of
[42:52] the Lord I'm committed to that lord it's
[42:54] it's very important so we just want to
[42:58] um take this opportunity and we'd like
[43:00] to dedicate little Steven I've only saw
[43:03] him by
[43:04] picture but I've heard that he's just a
[43:06] miniature
[43:11] joshu no shock
[43:13] right so maybe if we can play that song
[43:17] sister Susanna bring them in maybe Paul
[43:20] sing a course of that
[43:22] and man the Andersons if you like come

[44:52] and that you would take him on Lord I
[44:54] pray Lord you know what you have and the

[46:33] scriptures if you would turn to Ruth
[46:37] chapter 3 and I have kind of a
[46:39] lengthy portion of
[46:42] reading here this
[46:44] morning that I want
[46:46] to read from and just to kind of just
[46:49] draw as a background for what we will uh
[46:54] look into here
[47:00] I want to go to you to Ruth chapter
[47:03] 3 and verse
[47:07] one
[47:19] Amen in verse one of Ruth 3 it says then
[47:22] Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her my
[47:25] daughter shall I not seek rest for thee
[47:29] that it may be well with thee and now is
[47:32] not Boaz of our Kindred with whose
[47:35] maidens thou was behold he went with
[47:38] barley tonight in the threshing floor
[47:41] wash thyself now want you to notice
[47:43] these verses we'll pick them up here in
[47:44] a little bit wash thyself therefore and
[47:47] anoint thee and put thy reignment upon
[47:50] thee and get thee down to the floor but
[47:53] make not thyself known unto the man
[47:55] until he shall have done eating and
[47:59] drinking and it shall be when he lith
[48:01] down that thou shalt Mark the place
[48:05] where he shall lie and thou shalt go in
[48:08] and uncover his feet and lay thee down
[48:11] and he will tell thee what Thou shalt do
[48:14] and she said unto her all that thou
[48:17] sayest unto me I will
[48:20] do that's my desire Lord sir and she
[48:25] went down unto the floor did according
[48:27] to all that her mother-in-law bade her
[48:29] and when baz had eaten and drunk and his
[48:32] heart was merry he went to lie down at
[48:35] the end of the Heap of corn this is
[48:37] speaking of the fullness of Christ and
[48:40] she came softly and and uncovered his
[48:43] feet and laid her down and it came to
[48:46] pass at midnight that the man was afraid
[48:49] and turned himself and behold a woman
[48:53] lay at his feet and he said who are thou
[48:57] and she answered I am Ruth thine
[49:00] handmade spread therefore thy skirt over
[49:03] thine handmaid for thou art a near
[49:09] Kinsman
[49:11] and and he said blessed be thou of the
[49:14] Lord my daughter for thou has showed
[49:16] more kindness in the latter end than at
[49:18] the beginning in as much as thou follow
[49:21] us not the young men whether poor or
[49:25] Rich and now my my daughter fear not I
[49:28] will do to thee all that thou requirest
[49:30] for all the city of my people doth know
[49:33] that thou art a virtuous woman and now
[49:37] it is true that I am thy near Kinsman
[49:39] how be it there is a Kinsman nearer than
[49:42] i t this night and it shall be in the
[49:44] morning that if he will perform unto
[49:46] thee the part of a Kinsman well let him
[49:50] do the kinsman's part but if he will not
[49:52] do the part of a Kinsman to thee then
[49:55] will I do the part of a kins to thee as
[49:58] the Lord liveth lie down unto the
[50:01] morning and verse 14 and she lay at his
[50:04] feet until the morning and she rose up
[50:08] before one could know another and he
[50:11] said let it not be known that a woman
[50:15] came into the floor amen may the Lord
[50:19] just add the blessing to the reading of
[50:21] the word you may have your
[50:24] seats if you would also turn uh to the
[50:28] Book of Revelations and I'd like to read
[50:31] out of Revelations chapter
[50:44] 3 I just want to read this just for a a
[50:47] background and a context of what we will
[50:50] speak on
[50:52] here this morning
[50:58] we know we're living in the lady oan
[51:01] age we know that these were churches in
[51:05] Asia Minor but God used the
[51:08] characteristics that was there and it
[51:11] became prophecy for the ages that would
[51:15] come which is known as that of the the
[51:18] fullness of the Gentiles or the the
[51:20] seven Church ages where remember the
[51:24] Jews they rejected the Messiah and when
[51:28] they rejected him remember that that was
[51:30] all in the plan of God that then he
[51:33] himself would turn and take a bride from
[51:37] the Gentiles for his name's sake it was
[51:39] all in God's plan but God could not make
[51:42] them reject him but they were blinded
[51:44] Paul picks this up in the Book of Romans
[51:46] they were blinded for our sake so it
[51:50] wasn't anything that we were better
[51:52] people as a matter of fact we you know
[51:54] the scriptures are very clear we were
[51:56] just heathen
[51:57] we we you know we we were just that way
[51:59] but we had no promise of covenants or
[52:02] anything like that Paul deals with that
[52:04] but all the way through the Old
[52:05] Testament God had laid all of this in
[52:08] little parts that was through there and
[52:10] you know the Jews they knew this but you
[52:12] see they didn't the understanding did
[52:14] not break upon them for this for certain
[52:17] scriptures that would pertain to you and
[52:18] I because we were hidden in Christ just
[52:23] as Eve when she was hidden in Adam
[52:26] that's right is that right and just as
[52:29] Joseph was rejected of his Brethren
[52:32] during that time of rejection remember
[52:35] he was given a gentile bride and when
[52:39] the Gentile bride was placed into the
[52:41] palace then his Brethren came and that's
[52:45] when he made himself known to his
[52:47] Brethren that's all a type of Christ
[52:50] speaking of how Christ himself would
[52:52] take unto himself a people for his
[52:55] name's sake
[52:57] and then there is a returning remember
[53:00] Paul tells us this in Romans there'll be
[53:02] a returning back to the Jews but we the
[53:06] Gentile bride will not be on the scene
[53:09] she will be taken in Rapture Before He
[53:12] makes himself known to the Jews is that
[53:17] right they receive their two witnesses
[53:19] Revelations 11 that that of the spirit
[53:22] of Elijah and Moses that will Point them
[53:25] to the law to the prophet pH and through
[53:27] that as they're as they're making known
[53:29] what the prophets and law were speaking
[53:31] of it will Point them away from The
[53:34] Keeping of traditions to the true
[53:38] atonement is everybody with me which is
[53:41] Christ that's who we're pointed to
[53:44] you've not been pointed to a church
[53:46] because a church cannot atone for you
[53:49] but we have been pointed to Jesus Christ
[53:52] and so that's where they'll be called
[53:53] from all of the rituals and traditions
[53:56] and they'll be pointed to him and it
[53:58] will be the same message of the baptism
[54:01] of the Holy Ghost that they will be
[54:04] anointed to speak to the
[54:06] Jews and as the Jews themselves are
[54:09] sealed away he'll slip away from the
[54:11] wedding supper where we're at he'll slip
[54:13] away come down make himself known to his
[54:19] Brethren He makes himself known then
[54:21] then there's a slipping back up and then
[54:23] we return with him in Revelations 19 and
[54:26] you know they the 144 they seal their
[54:29] testimony give their life but then then
[54:31] Here Comes Armageddon then after
[54:33] Armageddon this is then when the
[54:35] Millennium sets
[54:36] in then from the Millennium into the new
[54:39] home future home what a future we have
[54:42] to look forward
[54:44] to so we're living in this hour and it's
[54:47] important to know where we're
[54:50] living you know it's like we you and I
[54:52] have both been in places sometimes you
[54:54] can have a map and you need to know okay
[54:56] where am I right now you know when
[54:58] someone says I you know you've had
[55:00] people that called you and said I'm lost
[55:01] you say where are you I don't know oh
[55:04] boy we're in trouble so it's always
[55:07] helpful to find a point of origin where
[55:09] you at we we know where you need to get
[55:11] to but do you know where you're at and
[55:13] that's where the word of God it always
[55:16] comes to let us see where we are
[55:19] aten now let me just say this very
[55:22] clearly to you the word will never
[55:24] reveal a downward path to
[55:27] you it doesn't matter if you or I have
[55:30] stumbled or we fail it'll never reveal a
[55:32] downward path but the word of God will
[55:35] always reveal an upward
[55:39] path is that right so now let's read
[55:42] here in in in the lady oan Church age in
[55:46] in verse 14 and unto the angel of the
[55:49] Church of the lady oans write these
[55:51] things saith the amen the faithful and
[55:54] true witness the beginning of the
[55:55] creation of God I Know Thy works that
[55:59] thou are neither cold nor hot I would
[56:02] that thou W cold or hot so then because
[56:04] Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor
[56:07] hot I will spew thee out of my mouth
[56:10] because thou sayest I am rich and
[56:12] increased with goods and have need of
[56:15] nothing and knowest not that thou art
[56:18] wretched and miserable and poor and
[56:20] blind and naked the the key is they
[56:23] don't know
[56:24] it and the reason they don't know it God
[56:28] is present and this message this what
[56:31] I'm reading becomes the very unction of
[56:35] what all the message is it's a
[56:38] preparation to come out of the systems
[56:41] of man it's to is to break away all the
[56:45] veils and the obscurities because when
[56:48] we can see Christ for who he really is
[56:51] and recognize that that he who was is
[56:55] here right right now and then it brings
[56:58] us to being conscious of God and when
[57:01] we're conscious of God then we can
[57:04] become conscious of our own
[57:08] lives this is a sad state that I'm
[57:10] reading here because this is an age that
[57:14] is enriched with theology is enriched
[57:18] with religion enriched with
[57:22] tradition enriched with uh uh churches
[57:26] enriched with with all of that but yet
[57:28] when it all comes down to it at the end
[57:30] of the day the holy spirit is saying you
[57:33] you're not aware but Thou Art wretched
[57:36] miserable poor blind and
[57:39] naked right in other words what is this
[57:42] they're not covered with the true
[57:45] Garment of the
[57:47] word and that Garment of the word is his
[57:50] spirit is his blood that takes away any
[57:55] trace of the first
[57:57] birth it's where the New Birth has set
[58:00] into our life man cannot produce that
[58:03] it's a sovereign Act of almighty God
[58:06] where our faith accepts what he has
[58:09] already done and provided for
[58:12] us notice I counsel thee to buy of me
[58:15] gold tried in the fire never was a
[58:18] character like him that thou mayest be
[58:20] rich in white rment that thou mayest be
[58:23] clothed and that the shame of thy
[58:25] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[58:29] eyes with isav that thou mayest see now
[58:32] watch this as many as I love he didn't
[58:34] say as many as love
[58:36] me as many as I
[58:39] love where does his love stem from Clear
[58:42] from the foundation of the world
[58:44] Revelations 13:8 said he was the lamb
[58:47] slain from the foundation of the world
[58:50] Isaiah being a prophet is caught up to
[58:53] see and hear what God has already spoken
[58:57] this is why Isaiah could speak as though
[59:00] in Isaiah 53 it's already happened he
[59:03] was
[59:05] wounded right it's not something that
[59:08] you know he will be no no he was so he's
[59:10] already seeing it it's a finished
[59:14] work before there was ever a devil
[59:17] before there was ever any unbelief the
[59:19] lamb had already
[59:22] spoke before any situation before any
[59:26] condition before no matter what we would
[59:28] have been entwined in the lamb was
[59:30] already slain from the mind of
[59:34] God
[59:36] hallelujah notice in verse in verse 19
[59:39] so as many as I love this is this is his
[59:43] love being expressed I rebuke and chasen
[59:47] and be zelus therefore and repent aren't
[59:50] you thankful for the love of
[59:54] God behold I stand stand at the door and
[59:57] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[1:00:01] the door I will come into to him and
[1:00:04] will suck with him and he with me
[1:00:06] remember here he is outside of the
[1:00:08] church the church that claims to be
[1:00:10] worshiping him loving him and yet he's
[1:00:14] been put out of the church because he is
[1:00:17] the word it's his presence it's his life
[1:00:19] it's his nature he's been put out so
[1:00:22] here he is standing and he's moving upon
[1:00:26] the hearts of
[1:00:28] individuals that's why this our walk
[1:00:30] with God is an individual
[1:00:34] Affair yes it is to him that overcometh
[1:00:37] oh my this is where we want to go to him
[1:00:39] that overcometh will I grant to sit with
[1:00:41] me in my throne in my domain even as I
[1:00:45] also overcome and am sat down with my
[1:00:48] father in his throne he that hath an ear
[1:00:51] let him hear what the spirit saith un to
[1:00:56] the
[1:00:57] churches brother Brian switch it over
[1:00:59] for me please there we go this is what

[1:01:11] this this morning on from his feet to
[1:01:14] his
[1:01:15] throne and I I don't mean to interrupt

[1:01:55] like what we did the other day because
[1:01:57] I'm sure I'll leave somebody out I I but
[1:01:59] it what what helps is that I can hit

[1:02:02] passing it on and if we duplicate it or
[1:02:04] whatever more you know um well we I
[1:02:07] think it'd be better to duplicate it
[1:02:09] than not to get it at all so uh we want
[1:02:11] to I want to um just remind you of that
[1:02:14] right there just be on the lookout and
[1:02:16] Lord willing just um keep that in prayer

[1:02:32] say I'm thankful to the
[1:02:34] Lord I really
[1:02:39] am I I got to thinking a little bit of
[1:02:42] what brother uh David when he was uh
[1:02:44] ministering here one I tell you um that
[1:02:47] was wonderful when brother Isaac was
[1:02:49] here on Sunday that was
[1:02:51] wonderful and um God just knows what
[1:02:54] he's doing in season God has everything
[1:02:56] lined up you know and um then when
[1:02:59] Brother David when he was you know
[1:03:00] speaking of that because God not only
[1:03:02] providing for a spiritually which is the
[1:03:04] most important thing but you know what
[1:03:06] God has has made the provision his word
[1:03:08] if we put him first he said I'll take
[1:03:10] care of everything else and I'm I'm
[1:03:13] thankful to God that that's that's
[1:03:15] exactly what what he has been doing uh
[1:03:17] so if you would like to help out with
[1:03:19] your check book you can open it up and
[1:03:22] we'll but we would like to continue you
[1:03:24] know you if you as you continue to give
[1:03:26] just write on the envelope uh you know
[1:03:29] that it's going towards the project and
[1:03:31] um then we'll kind of go from there also
[1:03:34] um my Uncle Bobby um we got we had been
[1:03:37] praying for him and we went there a
[1:03:40] couple times this week and then
[1:03:41] yesterday uh not yesterday um Friday at
[1:03:44] midday I took a break from here and ran
[1:03:46] over there and we went in and and we
[1:03:48] just had prayer with him once again just
[1:03:51] just speaking to the family and uh just
[1:03:53] um standing there with him at that point
[1:03:56] in time they were actually going to move
[1:03:58] him even to a further um intensive of
[1:04:01] care which was more or less for the ne
[1:04:03] neurological part uh because the amount
[1:04:06] of seizures he was having but you know I
[1:04:08] got a text yesterday that when my aunt
[1:04:11] got there in the morning they already
[1:04:13] were moving him out of intensive care
[1:04:16] completely said I got here his eyes was
[1:04:19] open and you know and and so he's he's
[1:04:22] got he has the paralysis there on the
[1:04:24] right side from that stroke broke and uh
[1:04:26] so you just keep him in prayer and um
[1:04:29] I'm just certainly you know uh just been
[1:04:31] praying for God's mercy uh you know upon
[1:04:34] it and just been able to talk to him and
[1:04:36] just Express you know my heart Express
[1:04:38] the gospel and so we just I asked you
[1:04:41] just continue to keep in prayer that to
[1:04:43] me was a great thing of What the Lord
[1:04:45] Has Done because they they recognized
[1:04:46] that they said this was the prayers that
[1:04:49] turned this around and so I just ask if
[1:04:52] you would continue I know we all have
[1:04:53] needs and if you would continue to keep
[1:04:56] him in prayer amen the number one thing
[1:04:58] that my desire is is sure I want to see
[1:05:00] him well but the one thing that my
[1:05:02] desire is is Lord that soul and that's
[1:05:05] where when I got the news last Friday
[1:05:06] evening and I got away in my room down
[1:05:08] at the men's meeting that's what I
[1:05:09] prayed I said God I'm asking you for
[1:05:11] your mercies for that life so if you
[1:05:15] would just I know you have been praying
[1:05:17] and I just wanted to give you an update
[1:05:18] on that and um but let's let's look at
[1:05:21] this here a little bit here this morning
[1:05:24] on from his feet to his throne because
[1:05:26] knowing there's always a place and a
[1:05:28] beginning of where that we uh will start
[1:05:32] from Even in our journey and serving the
[1:05:35] lord and um I want you to see that um as
[1:05:38] we go through this here and we're
[1:05:41] looking at it um when we look at this
[1:05:44] promise that we have it says to him that
[1:05:46] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[1:05:49] in my throne even as I also overcame and
[1:05:53] sat down with my father in his throne
[1:05:55] this this is the promise that the mother
[1:05:58] of the sons of Zebedee asked about and
[1:06:02] the Lord Jesus said at that time he says
[1:06:04] well I I can't do that it's already
[1:06:07] given right it's already been given
[1:06:09] where from the mind of God and so but
[1:06:13] but then he's asked the question can uh
[1:06:15] can you drink the cup that I I drink and
[1:06:17] be baptized with with that which I am
[1:06:20] baptized with we can he said you you
[1:06:21] shall be indeed so to recognize that all
[1:06:24] the way down through the ages there's
[1:06:26] been a bride that's being built all the
[1:06:29] way down through the ages to to walk
[1:06:31] with God and is an absolute reflection
[1:06:34] of the word of God and I'm just going to
[1:06:36] say it like this every age has a promise
[1:06:38] to it and it's an A and that promise and
[1:06:41] that word is to the Overcomer now
[1:06:43] there's no way to overcome unless you
[1:06:45] have battles right and the first battle
[1:06:48] is really our own
[1:06:50] will and you know what that battle it
[1:06:52] continues to go down we us continuing to
[1:06:54] lay down our own will but thank God for
[1:06:57] the holy spirit that comes in our life
[1:06:59] that gives us a greater is he that's in
[1:07:01] us than he that's in the world that
[1:07:03] gives us a strength to continue to lay
[1:07:05] our lives down at his feet and so we
[1:07:10] recognize I want you to notice how
[1:07:11] brother Bram says this here he says in
[1:07:14] reference to this this particular uh uh
[1:07:17] uh scripture he says there will not be
[1:07:19] one person who will set in the Throne of
[1:07:21] the Lord Jesus Christ unless he has been
[1:07:24] living that
[1:07:26] word now watch watch how he says this
[1:07:28] your prayers your fastings your
[1:07:31] repentances no matter what you present
[1:07:34] to God that's what's key no matter what
[1:07:36] you or I present to God none of that
[1:07:40] will gain you the privilege of sitting
[1:07:42] in that Throne it will only be granted
[1:07:45] only to the word bride wow now he says
[1:07:50] as the Throne of the king is shared with
[1:07:53] the king the queen because she is United
[1:07:57] to him how how are we United to Christ
[1:08:00] who is the word how do we become United
[1:08:04] is it merely just us carrying the Bible
[1:08:07] is it merely no because this can this is
[1:08:09] almost like false teeth you can take it
[1:08:11] out and put it down but there's got to
[1:08:13] come a real uniting and the only way
[1:08:17] there can be a real uniting is the Bible
[1:08:19] tells us is by the Holy Spirit which it
[1:08:22] says in the Book of John that there are
[1:08:25] three that agree in the earth water
[1:08:28] blood and spirit and the and then there
[1:08:30] are three that are one the Father the
[1:08:34] word and the spirit so in order to be a
[1:08:38] part of the word we must have the word
[1:08:42] in US it must be the holy spirit inside
[1:08:45] of us so you know what that does it
[1:08:47] takes it away from my efforts of going
[1:08:50] through the fields and gleaning to where
[1:08:53] now his life inside of me and it's him
[1:08:56] bringing forth himself through my
[1:09:01] lifeall it's no longer your works or my
[1:09:04] works now you know as I was speaking to
[1:09:06] a person here just just uh uh uh this
[1:09:10] past week and and you know they they
[1:09:11] made a statement to me and said oh yeah
[1:09:13] I I realize you know you you really
[1:09:14] don't have to go to church I said no no
[1:09:16] no no I said that's not what I'm saying
[1:09:18] I said what I'm saying as I said is that
[1:09:20] this is the scripture forsake not to
[1:09:22] assemble ourselves together as the
[1:09:24] manner of some I said but going to
[1:09:26] church will not save you right right it
[1:09:30] won't save you Judas was in church it
[1:09:32] didn't save
[1:09:34] him is that right but going to church it
[1:09:37] has its part but what is the reason that
[1:09:40] was my question them what's the reason
[1:09:42] why do you go to church what's the
[1:09:44] purpose behind it the real purpose
[1:09:46] behind it should be because his grace
[1:09:50] has been expressed to my life and in
[1:09:53] devotion and appreciation of that Grace
[1:09:57] this is why I do what I do because I
[1:09:59] just want to love him more I want to
[1:10:01] draw closer to him it's an appreciation
[1:10:04] not out of us trying to obtain merits or
[1:10:07] stars on a calendar where we get to the
[1:10:10] other side and we're standing there and
[1:10:12] he says you know what you got 15 gold
[1:10:14] stars you only got 10 gold stars we
[1:10:16] cannot work our way into the
[1:10:20] kingdom of
[1:10:22] God is that right Cain tried that he
[1:10:25] couldn't work his way in had a beautiful
[1:10:28] offering but God refused it because it
[1:10:30] was the works of his own
[1:10:34] hands so the only thing can be accepted
[1:10:37] is what he has provided and there's a
[1:10:40] people there's a bride of Christ upon
[1:10:43] this Earth that just like Esther where
[1:10:45] the rest of the women that went through
[1:10:47] and they said we'll take this and we'll
[1:10:49] take that and what no we don't want that
[1:10:51] we'll take this what you know they they
[1:10:52] went around and they selected just
[1:10:54] certain attributes that they wanted it's
[1:10:57] much like the religious world of this
[1:11:00] day all they want is oh I I just want an
[1:11:02] attribute well you can't get married to
[1:11:05] someone just because you're like one
[1:11:07] attribute you have to fall in love with
[1:11:11] them their entire character it's not
[1:11:14] enough to say well I'm going to marry
[1:11:16] I'm not going no no not the other
[1:11:17] attributes I just want to marry the
[1:11:19] attribute of Grace he can't do that it's
[1:11:21] it's when we stand here in Union it's
[1:11:24] because I I want to fully marry and give
[1:11:28] myself to him who is the
[1:11:31] word and that's who's standing in our
[1:11:34] midst that's who has revealed himself in
[1:11:36] this hour is the word himself and this
[1:11:39] is the prophecy of this hour Hallelujah
[1:11:43] God has declared a bridegroom call
[1:11:45] through the word to call upon the hearts
[1:11:48] of a people that he for ordained from
[1:11:51] the foundation of the world let him that
[1:11:53] ha an ear hear what the Spirit sayith to
[1:11:56] the
[1:11:57] churches this is the hour let us be glad
[1:11:59] and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb
[1:12:01] has
[1:12:02] comeu because she's United to him so
[1:12:05] only they who are of that word even as
[1:12:07] he is of that word will share that
[1:12:10] Throne right now as we look at this here
[1:12:15] I want to just say it in this
[1:12:17] way God builds from the feed up think of
[1:12:22] where Ruth was instructed to go no she
[1:12:26] was not instructed to go lay down at his
[1:12:31] midsection do do not go lay down above
[1:12:33] his head because it can't be you above
[1:12:36] the word that's that's good but there's
[1:12:39] a reason all of the signification of the
[1:12:43] approach yeah right remember in order
[1:12:46] for this
[1:12:47] inheritance to come which is there
[1:12:50] resting in the inheritance of a Limon
[1:12:52] there's got to be the right approach
[1:12:54] that would release this through that of
[1:12:57] the Kinsman and she can't just come any
[1:13:00] old way you see this is how the word is
[1:13:02] it's not it's not something we just it's
[1:13:04] just a shot in the dark there's a
[1:13:06] Precision amen God is so he wants you
[1:13:09] and I to know the way so clearly that he
[1:13:12] lays it out he makes it so clear and let
[1:13:14] me just tell you something the clarity
[1:13:16] of his way is not five steps to be a
[1:13:19] happier Grump the five steps to be a
[1:13:22] better you that's not it he reveals
[1:13:25] himself he said I am the way the truth
[1:13:30] and the life and he made a promise today
[1:13:33] that I will show thee show thee reveal
[1:13:36] uncover to thee the path of
[1:13:39] Life how does he do it by revealing
[1:13:41] himself I am your way where you can't
[1:13:44] see a way out of your life or your first
[1:13:47] birth or the situation you're in or how
[1:13:49] am I going to make it through this trial
[1:13:51] I am your way I am the path out
[1:13:57] that's so good God
[1:13:59] builds from the feet up but remember
[1:14:03] Nebuchadnezzar's
[1:14:05] Vision this was the
[1:14:07] Gentile it was topped
[1:14:10] down it was all it was it was it was
[1:14:13] there from the gold and come all the way
[1:14:15] down through all of the parts of of the
[1:14:18] arms of silver medial persan and then
[1:14:21] down through the his belly and his
[1:14:23] thighs of brass and then legs of iron
[1:14:25] and his feet part of iron and part of
[1:14:27] clay notice such such carefulness has
[1:14:30] been given to the head but the feet
[1:14:33] which is a foundation which is what
[1:14:35] matters but that iron that iron notice
[1:14:38] how it it goes through that of the feet
[1:14:40] we understand that that that's a eastern
[1:14:43] and western hemisphere we saw that we
[1:14:46] didn't I wasn't alive then but to see
[1:14:48] the two big toes of Eisenhower and kusf
[1:14:51] at the UN we see where we're at we're
[1:14:54] not wondering where are we at right now
[1:14:55] are we in the ankle or are we in the
[1:14:58] upper part of the foot we're down to the
[1:14:59] toes right now but in these toes right
[1:15:03] here remember this this iron and Clay
[1:15:06] how did that get that iron clay brother
[1:15:08] BR when labor on that that's from that
[1:15:09] interm Maring and breaking apart the
[1:15:12] strength and and what a what a
[1:15:14] feebleness it is of clay and and iron it
[1:15:17] can't hold together it can't bind
[1:15:19] together it's a it's you don't lay a
[1:15:22] foundation that way that's why Jesus
[1:15:24] said do not build upon sand right but
[1:15:28] build upon the rock because storms no
[1:15:32] matter who we are we're not exempt from
[1:15:34] storms storms are going to come right
[1:15:36] just because we are believers and and
[1:15:39] and and as we stand professing to be the
[1:15:41] Bride of Jesus Christ we're not exempt
[1:15:43] from trials we're not exempt from
[1:15:45] suffering as a matter of fact there is
[1:15:47] suffering that is to come our way but
[1:15:50] remember there's got to be something
[1:15:53] that's greater there than our resolved
[1:15:55] in our DNA there's got to be an anchor a
[1:15:58] rock a revelation that when all hell is
[1:16:01] turned loose against you there's
[1:16:03] something on the inside that holds you
[1:16:05] you say what is that that's a real Firm
[1:16:08] Foundation like Paul said I have laid
[1:16:11] the
[1:16:13] foundation that Foundation is Jesus
[1:16:16] Christ God laid it by descending
[1:16:21] down paying the price and establishing
[1:16:24] it that you and I
[1:16:25] might become
[1:16:27] him you know the Lord Jesus he mentioned
[1:16:29] the same anointing that was a member the
[1:16:32] disciples hey these disciples they
[1:16:34] weren't Gentiles but they were under the
[1:16:36] anointing see the spirit the spirit that
[1:16:39] gets around let me just say this to you
[1:16:41] we're not you it's no such thing as
[1:16:43] saying well I tell you the spirits don't
[1:16:45] bother me no we're we we're listen
[1:16:46] they're all
[1:16:49] around they're all
[1:16:51] around we can feel the influence of the
[1:16:53] angels of God that are here but let me
[1:16:55] just tell you something all of those
[1:16:57] demon Spirits have been released that
[1:16:59] was there sealed up in Revelations 9
[1:17:02] right is that right they they've been
[1:17:04] released and then here we're standing in
[1:17:07] in a time in an hour where even those
[1:17:10] disciples begin to well who's going to
[1:17:12] be the chief one and who's going to be
[1:17:13] the head and who's going to be the top
[1:17:15] guy and who's that Spirit was all around
[1:17:17] they weren't Gentiles but that Spirit
[1:17:20] was there that's where it goes to show
[1:17:21] you and I that here we are living in
[1:17:25] Christ but oh this is why Paul could say
[1:17:27] if you live in the spirit walk in the
[1:17:32] spirit because why all of these evil
[1:17:35] spirits are all around that would want
[1:17:36] to pull you this way and pull you that
[1:17:39] way but walk in the
[1:17:41] spirit come on friends we've had to
[1:17:43] stand there and say God forgive me for
[1:17:45] that elevated thought forgive me for
[1:17:48] this for forgive me Lord for the
[1:17:50] entertaining that wrong thought or you
[1:17:52] know man might be a little bit better
[1:17:53] here or it might need God brings us to
[1:17:55] that place to real wait a minute those
[1:17:57] are spirits that are trying to get
[1:18:00] around the Bible tells us clearly before
[1:18:03] honor is humility am amen and this all
[1:18:08] begins with the right approach and I
[1:18:10] want you to notice this in Isaiah
[1:18:12] chapter 6 The Bible says in the hour
[1:18:15] that King Uzziah died I saw also the
[1:18:18] Lord sitting upon a throne high and
[1:18:20] lifted up and his train filled the
[1:18:23] temple above it the seraphim each one
[1:18:26] had six wings with Twain he covered his
[1:18:29] face and with Twain he covered his feet
[1:18:32] and with Twain he did fly and one cried
[1:18:35] to another and said holy holy holy is
[1:18:38] the Lord of hosts the whole earth is
[1:18:41] full of his glory now I want you to
[1:18:44] notice this how brother BR would go over
[1:18:47] this over and over taking this because
[1:18:49] this is the approach think of it in this
[1:18:52] hour Uzziah Isaiah had been looking to
[1:18:54] Uzziah and Uzziah had started off as a
[1:18:57] great man the Bible tells us he
[1:18:59] strengthened himself he God gave him
[1:19:01] many victories and many battles but he
[1:19:04] got to a place to where when he felt
[1:19:07] like he could do whatever he wanted to
[1:19:10] do and it didn't matter he even come to
[1:19:14] a place that he was going to step in to
[1:19:16] a calling that God had not had for his
[1:19:19] life that's right and you see he was
[1:19:22] going to he was going to offer up what
[1:19:24] the priests were called to author and
[1:19:26] notice with Isaiah when Isaiah saw this
[1:19:30] of how that this departure and then he
[1:19:32] was smitten with Leprosy well you know
[1:19:34] the leprosy itself was only became a
[1:19:37] sign of the condition of his
[1:19:40] heart you see many times this is why
[1:19:43] things that become visible outwardly are
[1:19:45] only manifestations of what is going on
[1:19:48] inwardly that's why a person can have
[1:19:50] cancer and all of a sudden they begin to
[1:19:52] see symptoms showing up here and yet it
[1:19:55] can be there right there in their body
[1:19:56] for a period of time why then the
[1:19:58] outside begins to show it up let me just
[1:20:01] say it like this if that will take place
[1:20:03] with cancer if that'll take place with
[1:20:05] these other things how much more will it
[1:20:08] take place when the spirit of God has
[1:20:10] steep into the control tower of the
[1:20:12] heart of man and the Judgment seat is
[1:20:15] back in the heart of man how much
[1:20:17] greater is it to see Christ himself
[1:20:20] coming more into view into view into
[1:20:23] view like Solomon told the bride he said
[1:20:26] it is a day I see thee as a day that is
[1:20:29] shining brighter and brighter and
[1:20:31] brighter and brigher
[1:20:34] amen it was reverence notice coming in
[1:20:37] when Isaiah he was looking at Uzziah and
[1:20:40] now when the when the churches have made
[1:20:43] their decisions and and men have made
[1:20:45] their decisions and we don't need that
[1:20:47] no more and our schools have told us we
[1:20:49] don't need that well I'm telling you we
[1:20:51] still need Jesus amen and the Bible said
[1:20:54] he still the same yesterday today and
[1:20:56] forever God never entrusted it to man
[1:20:59] that man would try to figure it out
[1:21:00] that's why there was the message like we
[1:21:02] looked at in the Book of Judges every
[1:21:04] man did what was right in his own sight
[1:21:06] well I reckon this I figure this I I I
[1:21:08] you know I believe God does this and I
[1:21:10] think no no we don't have to wonder
[1:21:12] God's word has been set before us and
[1:21:15] the Bible said let every man's word be a
[1:21:17] lie and let God's word be the
[1:21:20] truth amen so if there's anything that
[1:21:23] speaks contrary to the word of God it's
[1:21:26] not of God it's a false
[1:21:29] spirit I don't care if it takes a quote
[1:21:32] out of the message of the hour and said
[1:21:34] well you know that only pertained to
[1:21:35] brother brandom and brandom Tabernacle
[1:21:37] that's not the spirit of
[1:21:39] [Music]
[1:21:40] God that's the
[1:21:44] [Music]
[1:21:46] truth reverence
[1:21:48] humility and action notice here's the
[1:21:51] covering remember Ruth
[1:21:55] has been instructed by Naomi how to
[1:21:58] approach him that's true you wash
[1:22:02] yourself anoint
[1:22:04] yourself and put put your best garment
[1:22:08] on it's an
[1:22:11] approach see this is the
[1:22:13] covering because
[1:22:15] remember Ruth is not
[1:22:18] coming with wrongful intentions right
[1:22:22] her motives are pure amen this is where
[1:22:26] the spirit of God draws upon this is
[1:22:29] what's important with every promise of
[1:22:31] God from the Holy Spirit to on and on
[1:22:33] and on is what are the motives and
[1:22:36] objectives what's the reason remember
[1:22:38] Simon the Sorcerer wanted the Holy Ghost
[1:22:40] but he didn't want it for the right
[1:22:42] reason he wanted it so that he might
[1:22:45] profit and what did Peter discernment by
[1:22:47] the spirit of God said bitterness has
[1:22:49] filled your soul he was wanting it for
[1:22:52] the advancement of Simon but God's not
[1:22:55] here to advance any man's Kingdom the
[1:22:57] holy spirit is given that the kingdom of
[1:23:00] God might be Advanced through our
[1:23:03] lives so notice this approach here you
[1:23:06] know here that that sheriam you know
[1:23:08] covered his face reverence that's the
[1:23:11] first approach then covering his feet
[1:23:13] with humility then he can go into action
[1:23:16] and you see what God was doing was
[1:23:18] showing Isaiah how he prepares his
[1:23:21] servants and how a prepared servant must
[1:23:23] be reverent humble and in action the
[1:23:26] prophet says if you uncover your face if
[1:23:29] you uncover your feet your action isn't
[1:23:31] going to do no good because you're
[1:23:33] stirred
[1:23:36] wrong now let's look at the woman at the
[1:23:38] well here she stands cuz this same same
[1:23:42] approach has been all the way through
[1:23:44] scriptures I'm just going to take a
[1:23:45] couple examples when she stands here
[1:23:48] coming to the well little does she
[1:23:51] know her life what she's long
[1:23:56] for she's going to find her
[1:23:59] answer or if I can say it this way the
[1:24:02] answer is finding
[1:24:04] her she's buried beneath being married
[1:24:07] multiple times she's buried beneath
[1:24:09] darkness and Blackness and void but
[1:24:12] there's a seed down there Hallelujah
[1:24:14] there's something down there that the
[1:24:16] Pharisees and nobody else would give her
[1:24:18] the time of day but yet for her when the
[1:24:22] word begins to approach her and said go
[1:24:25] find your H go bring your husband and
[1:24:26] she said I have no husband and the word
[1:24:29] said your confession is true see she's
[1:24:32] coming she's getting her confession she
[1:24:34] didn't pull back and said wait a minute
[1:24:36] wait wait wait wait you're not touching
[1:24:37] my life that
[1:24:39] way I'll just take a little bit of Grace
[1:24:43] I don't want that don't be dealing in my
[1:24:44] life no but what happened when the word
[1:24:47] spoke to her then she confessed what the
[1:24:52] word had said was true and then in
[1:24:55] reverence she says sir I perceive thou
[1:24:59] art a prophet see him manifesting
[1:25:02] himself had brought forth those wings to
[1:25:05] cover her faith her face in reverence
[1:25:09] Hallelujah glory and as he begins to
[1:25:11] speak to her life and minister to her
[1:25:14] heart she says in humility now here she
[1:25:17] is covering her feet saying I know that
[1:25:19] when Messiah cometh he will tell us
[1:25:22] these things she had a question in her
[1:25:24] life notice she had come to a place of
[1:25:26] reverence to ask the word the questions
[1:25:30] about her life let me tell you something
[1:25:32] you can ask everybody on Facebook you
[1:25:35] can put all them kind I don't know what
[1:25:36] the thing is now they call them survey
[1:25:37] monkeys that's what the things they used
[1:25:39] to make us do you could put a survey out
[1:25:41] about your life and you'll get a million
[1:25:43] different responses but if you'll just
[1:25:45] get in the presence of God the Bible is
[1:25:48] true Jeremiah 29 I know the plans that I
[1:25:52] have laid for you to bring you to an
[1:25:55] expected end glory be to God we don't
[1:25:58] have to stumble our way through life
[1:26:00] spiritually or naturally we can walk
[1:26:03] with
[1:26:06] God that gives me real
[1:26:09] Comfort I know when Messiah cometh he'll
[1:26:11] tell us these things that's humility and
[1:26:14] soon as he made the statement I'm he no
[1:26:18] resistance she went into
[1:26:20] action those wings that covered those
[1:26:22] feet and now the other set of wings
[1:26:24] begin to put her in action she was put
[1:26:26] into action by the word not only
[1:26:29] uncovering her life confession had come
[1:26:31] and now the humility of what God himself
[1:26:34] was revealing to her it put her in
[1:26:37] action to wear her testimony think about
[1:26:40] it friends she lived a life that would
[1:26:43] been secluding and trying to hide this
[1:26:45] and hide that and hide this and cover
[1:26:47] this up but notice that this is why I
[1:26:49] chose it was more than a natural event
[1:26:53] there was a super natural happening that
[1:26:55] took place in her life and the
[1:26:58] supernatural accompanied her life that
[1:27:00] when she testified there was something
[1:27:03] behind her voice that said come see a
[1:27:06] man amen hallelujah she went into action
[1:27:10] yes is that right am well now we find
[1:27:14] the same thing with
[1:27:15] Ruth Ruth comes in reverence yes she
[1:27:20] washes herself you and I have provision
[1:27:23] you see
[1:27:24] have provision to wash ourselves by the
[1:27:27] water but how do I wash Myself by just
[1:27:29] standing under the
[1:27:31] word that's what it is just simply
[1:27:33] standing under the word just saying Lord
[1:27:35] I present myself Lord I Give Myself
[1:27:39] washing no this is what she had to do it
[1:27:41] wasn't when you get to B house he's
[1:27:43] going to do this but you have access to
[1:27:45] this wash thyself and anoint
[1:27:49] thyself and put on the right garment no
[1:27:52] you can go through scripture any any
[1:27:54] time it came time for someone to appear
[1:27:57] in their moment Joseph was taken out of
[1:28:00] prison cleaned up shaved and a new
[1:28:02] garment put on him before Esther went
[1:28:05] into the king the Bible said she didn't
[1:28:08] take anything but what hagy the king's
[1:28:11] Chamberlain required Esther said I'm not
[1:28:14] going to choose from the value menu of
[1:28:17] what character attributes that I want I
[1:28:20] want all of a
[1:28:22] hezus because remember vashy had
[1:28:26] rejected him and he put her away is that
[1:28:29] right but here is Esther and Esther said
[1:28:33] you know what the king likes you know
[1:28:36] what the king likes well the king loves
[1:28:38] uh the washing of Water by the word the
[1:28:41] king likes the anointment with those
[1:28:44] oils that'll take all the stench out of
[1:28:46] your past and and the King loves when we
[1:28:49] walk in with the garments that he has
[1:28:51] provided not what you brought in but
[1:28:54] what he has provided for
[1:28:57] you you understand in every one of these
[1:28:59] events it's not us doing it it's us
[1:29:02] taking what he has
[1:29:07] provided that's where Ruth is at and
[1:29:10] Ruth herself here's what she says this
[1:29:13] reverence of coming in her approach to
[1:29:15] move within that way and then she says
[1:29:18] all that all that you've said to do
[1:29:21] that's what I'm going to do that's
[1:29:22] humility right
[1:29:24] you know what that means Ruth yeah I
[1:29:27] think I know what it means I know I know
[1:29:29] it's going to mean a lot I know it can
[1:29:32] be very
[1:29:33] disgraceful cuz women don't go down into
[1:29:35] that threshing floor right true but she
[1:29:38] wasn't going down in there for an affair
[1:29:39] and they didn't have an affair down
[1:29:41] there she was going down there to make a
[1:29:45] claim on him as her
[1:29:48] Kinsman I can't get into this today but
[1:29:50] she did not go down there with a victim
[1:29:52] mentality that's oh things have happened
[1:29:54] to me this is oh so bad I mean if you
[1:29:57] don't do that I don't know that's not
[1:29:59] she wouldn't have got nowhere you see we
[1:30:01] don't get anywhere if we go as though
[1:30:03] it's somebody else's fault and I'm in
[1:30:05] this situation because of this and I'm
[1:30:07] in God don't move it all on that we've
[1:30:09] got to recognize we need his grace in
[1:30:12] all
[1:30:14] things she went there to make a claim on
[1:30:17] him you're a near
[1:30:19] Kinsman you're the one that can take me
[1:30:22] from the weary fields of G meaning and
[1:30:24] bring Rest In My Soul you're the one
[1:30:27] that can tie me back into my inheritance
[1:30:30] you're the one that can raise up seed to
[1:30:33] my dead husband that can raise up to the
[1:30:35] inheritance of the lemon that's who you
[1:30:37] are that's who I know you to
[1:30:39] be and that's why I'm here Ruth are you
[1:30:43] here for an anointing I'm not here for
[1:30:45] an anointing are you here for a gift I'm
[1:30:46] not here for a gift I just want you
[1:30:54] amen yes and she went down the Bible
[1:30:56] says into the floor and did according to
[1:30:59] her mother-in-law there was action yes
[1:31:02] you see every decision Ruth made a
[1:31:04] decision and there we could read in
[1:31:06] chapter one but Ruth kept on making
[1:31:09] decisions every
[1:31:11] day every moment was a time of decision
[1:31:15] right you know I think of brother Aon
[1:31:17] when you were praying and I was hearing
[1:31:18] it back there there are times that no
[1:31:20] doubt Ruth said man I've back's tired
[1:31:24] from me I mean she was thankful for the
[1:31:28] handfuls of purpose she was thankful for
[1:31:30] what she was gleaning but remember she
[1:31:31] had to beat that out she didn't put it
[1:31:33] in a machine and it did it for her right
[1:31:35] she had to do that that was all
[1:31:40] testing the Bible said whosoever cometh
[1:31:42] to God must be tested and tried she
[1:31:45] would being intested not only with that
[1:31:47] but with the young men and there she was
[1:31:48] being tested and God allowed that period
[1:31:51] of testing let me just tell you
[1:31:53] something
[1:31:54] God's not afraid of his word being
[1:31:59] tested he's not afraid of it because you
[1:32:01] know why his word Can't
[1:32:03] Fail now you or I may have failed and
[1:32:06] you know you may have made a start and
[1:32:07] then you drop off and but you see if
[1:32:09] you're part of the word the word will
[1:32:11] find you and bring you right back to
[1:32:13] where you fell off and there is a
[1:32:15] repentance and saying Lord I'm ready to
[1:32:17] go
[1:32:17] on because you recognize what repentance
[1:32:20] is is to recognize that you didn't lead
[1:32:22] me astray I got off in my own way and
[1:32:25] Grace is given to bring us back and keep
[1:32:27] moving us on because the word cannot be
[1:32:31] defeated amen thanks be to God so every
[1:32:35] decision we make should lead us or Draw
[1:32:38] us closer to him that's what that's what
[1:32:41] when the prophet would speak this of of
[1:32:42] Ruth that that he talks about how that
[1:32:45] God is looking for individuals that
[1:32:47] would be dedicated making a clean cut
[1:32:49] consecration for themselves and and
[1:32:52] looking to him and Ruth being asked to
[1:32:54] do something that would be so
[1:32:57] disgraceful but she was willing because
[1:32:59] she had made her decision let me just
[1:33:01] say this going to
[1:33:05] Calvary was not all of a sudden an event
[1:33:08] that just
[1:33:10] happened it started out
[1:33:13] daily little by little so good was one
[1:33:17] Calvary after another Cal that's right
[1:33:20] you know why because that's where you
[1:33:21] and I would be brought to Hallelujah
[1:33:23] even on our way from the feet to the
[1:33:25] throne is Calvary to another Calvary to
[1:33:28] what is the c dying to ourselves so so
[1:33:31] there in the Garden of Eden was was
[1:33:33] where the word was leading him to where
[1:33:36] here the promises was coming to that
[1:33:38] point of that Apex of where he himself
[1:33:41] would surrender his life as the Lamb of
[1:33:44] God that the spirit of God might be
[1:33:46] poured out upon you and I it was leading
[1:33:49] him to that
[1:33:50] place it was a place of real Sur
[1:33:53] surrender in
[1:33:55] humility she was told put these garments
[1:33:58] on you cover yourself up not don't take
[1:34:01] things off cover yourself up you see
[1:34:05] that's why brother BR says in this day
[1:34:06] he says how contrary to the day we're
[1:34:08] living in when they want to take things
[1:34:10] off they don't want the word they don't
[1:34:13] want they I don't want this I don't want
[1:34:15] that on my life God don't now God just
[1:34:17] looks on the heart he does you're
[1:34:18] exactly right he looks on the heart and
[1:34:20] the Heart what he sees is that's why he
[1:34:23] can look in the heart and the heart says
[1:34:25] I really don't want to do this but when
[1:34:28] the heart can say yes Lord amen yes Lord
[1:34:31] that's that you see when the heart
[1:34:33] that's the real battle the battle's not
[1:34:36] here there is a Battle Ground of the
[1:34:38] mind but the real where the real battle
[1:34:40] is that needs to be stopped is right
[1:34:43] there in the
[1:34:45] heart then it'll come then everything
[1:34:47] else it'll take care of itself and the
[1:34:49] things start taking place you don't have
[1:34:50] to pluck the leaves off your old leaves
[1:34:52] fall off and new leaves come
[1:34:55] forth why because it's beginning at the
[1:34:58] feet
[1:34:59] amen is so good oh my we want to we want
[1:35:03] to cover ourselves we want to Mark what
[1:35:05] he's done for us notice not at his feet
[1:35:09] not at his head but at his feet that
[1:35:11] spoke of an
[1:35:13] unworthiness that we would be able to
[1:35:15] lay down there and die to ourselves
[1:35:19] that's good and then begin to take
[1:35:21] orders from the word laying down our
[1:35:23] will to take up his will that's that's
[1:35:26] that's what the grace of God is given to
[1:35:28] us because notice when it speaks of him
[1:35:31] being the Lamb of God in Isaiah 53 it
[1:35:34] said as a lamb who is Led dumb before
[1:35:37] her shearers not his it showed that he
[1:35:43] where she was in him then he would be in
[1:35:46] her it would be Christ in you the hope
[1:35:49] of glory and us as the Lambs as the
[1:35:52] Sheep of God yield building our lives
[1:35:54] and things are being shaved off of Our
[1:35:56] Lives that's so good yes oh my willing
[1:36:01] to Mark the place right so this
[1:36:05] uncovering the uncovering of his feet
[1:36:08] what that speaks of is is an act of
[1:36:10] total
[1:36:11] submission see remember this is an
[1:36:14] Eastern book yeah that's good good point
[1:36:18] it's an Eastern book what that meant was
[1:36:20] it's an act of total submission yeah
[1:36:22] when she comes remember she says who is
[1:36:24] there I'm Ruth thine handmaid I'm thy
[1:36:28] servant that's what laying at the feet
[1:36:29] that this is what it also symbolized is
[1:36:32] that in the it was understood in the
[1:36:33] role of a servant to lay at your
[1:36:36] Master's feet and be ready for any
[1:36:39] command of the
[1:36:40] master so when when Naomi told her lay
[1:36:43] down at his feet she was telling Ruth
[1:36:46] come to him in a totally humble
[1:36:49] submissive way that's beautiful yes sir
[1:36:52] is that right yep now think about this
[1:36:54] when she moved there in the floor there
[1:36:56] was nobody else there right I'm not
[1:36:59] talking about there were other men but
[1:37:01] here she comes into the threshing
[1:37:03] floor you know what she's doing she is
[1:37:06] exposing herself to
[1:37:10] disgrace you let me let me tell you you
[1:37:12] think of the thoughts that wasn't going
[1:37:14] through her mind already hey look you
[1:37:16] already know you don't got a bad a good
[1:37:17] track record you're a moabit need I
[1:37:20] remind you how your family of the
[1:37:24] moabites came
[1:37:26] about need I remind you there's a
[1:37:30] curse you think she didn't have them
[1:37:32] thoughts oh brother Samuel that's not
[1:37:33] possible you can read in the book of
[1:37:35] Philippians and Paul himself will
[1:37:38] address to you and I that the Mind
[1:37:40] battles he had to overcome I have
[1:37:42] learned to
[1:37:44] forget those things which are behind me
[1:37:47] in other words I'm I'm not letting that
[1:37:50] image of seeing Steven and hearing what
[1:37:52] he said I'm not going to let I'm not
[1:37:54] going to let the enemy use that to
[1:37:55] torment me any
[1:37:58] longer I've learned to take God's grace
[1:38:01] and accept it not because I'm worthy but
[1:38:03] because he said
[1:38:06] so let me tell you you and I we could go
[1:38:09] through and do a million pentanes you
[1:38:11] could crawl your knees till they bleed
[1:38:13] and it'll never satisfy but by faith you
[1:38:16] can accept what he's already done for
[1:38:19] you he paid for your past present and
[1:38:23] future
[1:38:25] sins you have to accept it and apply it
[1:38:28] to your life if I can say it like this
[1:38:32] he's already forgiven you you have to
[1:38:34] take his forgiveness and forgive
[1:38:37] yourself by the power of his
[1:38:41] [Applause]
[1:38:44] forgiveness this is where she exposed
[1:38:47] herself and this is why that the real
[1:38:50] Church of the Living God has exposed
[1:38:52] herself to the prophet said to public
[1:38:55] persecution by taking God at his
[1:38:59] word we have come to him that is the
[1:39:01] word oh I see you're one of
[1:39:05] them
[1:39:07] Christian
[1:39:09] believer disciple of
[1:39:11] Christ no no no you're a fanatic fanatic
[1:39:16] when can we get so when when can we get
[1:39:18] so overboard about Jesus I understand
[1:39:20] there's been some
[1:39:21] nuts that's had a big Kool-Aid bowl and
[1:39:25] put Kool-Aid and let's all sing Kumbaya
[1:39:27] and drink Kool-Aid there's always been
[1:39:29] nuts that's right that's good come on
[1:39:33] Friends there's always been nuts around
[1:39:36] that ain't what I'm talking
[1:39:38] about I'm talking about a real Unity
[1:39:41] with the word of
[1:39:43] God when God touches your life and begin
[1:39:45] to deal with your life I'm only
[1:39:47] preaching from my experience but when he
[1:39:50] got a hold of my life I couldn't get
[1:39:51] enough of him
[1:39:54] I still can't get enough of him there's
[1:39:56] times like you would pray that my flesh
[1:39:58] will say I don't feel like getting up I
[1:40:01] don't even really feel like going maybe
[1:40:03] I'm in the midst of a trial I don't feel
[1:40:05] like going but there's something in me
[1:40:07] that knows if I can just get in his
[1:40:11] presence if I can just get to the
[1:40:13] threshing floor he will separate me from
[1:40:17] me
[1:40:18] hallah because my feelings is not me
[1:40:23] my real reality is I'm a part of him
[1:40:26] I've always been a part of him and it's
[1:40:29] the spirit of God the word that draws me
[1:40:32] closer flesh profited nothing Hallelujah
[1:40:37] but the spirit giveth
[1:40:39] life so you see when we look at this
[1:40:42] here she had to come she had to Mark the
[1:40:45] place she had to crawl up in the secret
[1:40:48] of the night and mark the place and then
[1:40:51] baz sitting by the a full heap of corn
[1:40:54] not a not a little Heap this was the
[1:40:57] fullness the fullness of Christ once
[1:41:00] again the full manifestation of Jesus
[1:41:04] Christ in him dwelleth all the godhead
[1:41:07] bodily is that right the full heap of
[1:41:09] corn not just a portion the Bible
[1:41:12] promised us in Joel chapter 2 that that
[1:41:14] the threshing floors would
[1:41:17] overflow we're not living in the time of
[1:41:20] barely enough we don't got barely enough
[1:41:23] there's more than
[1:41:25] enough sometimes we might feel like I
[1:41:28] don't know I can make the next step but
[1:41:30] you've got more than
[1:41:31] [Applause]
[1:41:34] enough greater is he that is in you than
[1:41:38] he that's in the
[1:41:42] world so we have to mark marking that
[1:41:47] place marking the place and here comes
[1:41:50] in humility that marking of the place it
[1:41:52] deals deals with where he laid down that
[1:41:56] talking about Calvary where he laid down
[1:41:59] I that's where it comes to where he laid
[1:42:02] his life down what he did for you and I
[1:42:06] just as I was talking to someone the
[1:42:07] other day and I mentioned I was talking
[1:42:09] some things and I said you know good
[1:42:11] people I said but if goodness is all
[1:42:14] that was required Calvary was not
[1:42:18] needed Nicodemus was a good man but he
[1:42:21] needed he needed to meet Jesus Christ
[1:42:25] there had to be a Calvary where the sin
[1:42:27] debt would be settled once and for all
[1:42:31] because every one of us were born with
[1:42:33] sexual polluted
[1:42:36] blood but God came down and created both
[1:42:39] cell and blood cell he didn't borrow an
[1:42:42] egg from Mary what would you have God do
[1:42:45] in another act but God didn't borrow
[1:42:48] from the human race but he's the great
[1:42:50] Creator he created a body for for
[1:42:53] himself he created a tabernacle that he
[1:42:56] might come down and shed his blood and
[1:42:59] then through his life come back in and
[1:43:02] mow his image in our lives you know what
[1:43:04] he did the highest of highest this is
[1:43:08] one who was higher than the head of
[1:43:11] gold the king of glory said I'm going to
[1:43:15] come down among my
[1:43:19] subjects I want the fellowship that I
[1:43:22] had with my thoughts before the
[1:43:25] foundation of the
[1:43:26] world there's got to be a way made back
[1:43:29] I am that way and he who was higher than
[1:43:33] the highest
[1:43:35] Hallelujah came
[1:43:37] down and took upon the lowest of lows
[1:43:42] where a footwash flunky was even above
[1:43:46] him he didn't even have a bed to lay his
[1:43:50] head is that right he showed real
[1:43:53] humility what was he doing marking the
[1:43:58] place
[1:44:00] hallu this is
[1:44:02] why no one can truly really look at
[1:44:05] Calvary and come out with a stuffed
[1:44:09] shirt when you come up with Calvary when
[1:44:11] you really look at and I know sometimes
[1:44:13] remember it's like that picture that man
[1:44:15] was looking at it in museum and he was
[1:44:16] looking at that
[1:44:18] picture and he looked at the curator and
[1:44:20] he said I don't see nothing the cator
[1:44:23] said no no you're looking at it
[1:44:27] wrong well how am I looking at it wrong
[1:44:29] he said you got to get down on your
[1:44:31] knees and look up and when he got down
[1:44:34] on his knees and looked up oh it struck
[1:44:37] him he saw it you see the Holy Spirit
[1:44:41] he's the one not a man he's the one who
[1:44:43] directs you and I so we might look at it
[1:44:46] in the right angle to recognize it's no
[1:44:49] goodness that you or I could ever do
[1:44:52] it's not what I could do listen even in
[1:44:54] my walk with God right now I'm not
[1:44:56] presenting my Works to him but it's his
[1:44:59] righteousness living out through our
[1:45:02] lives amen I love him I want to serve
[1:45:06] him I want to I want to be a better
[1:45:07] Soldier I want to be a better Christian
[1:45:09] I want to love him
[1:45:11] more is that right yes sir but as it
[1:45:15] starts with humility yes that's what
[1:45:19] Jesus said and I want to can kind of
[1:45:22] turn this here
[1:45:24] where Jesus when he said except you be
[1:45:27] converted and come as a little
[1:45:30] child God always builds I'm kind of
[1:45:32] moving here a little bit because of my
[1:45:34] time God builds from the feet up
[1:45:39] remember our thought from his feet to
[1:45:42] his throne that is so it's a journey yes
[1:45:45] it is every one of us it has to start
[1:45:49] with a real genuine birth that comes by
[1:45:53] faith in the word of God are you hearing
[1:45:57] me there there're in no other way it's
[1:46:00] like this prayer lines don't give it
[1:46:01] altars don't give it hands don't give it
[1:46:04] it's faith that releases the promise of
[1:46:08] God because if it's based on man or
[1:46:11] man's hand then it can fall away come on
[1:46:14] friends everything is by
[1:46:16] faith it ain't about how forceful the
[1:46:19] men oh that Minister really pray it
[1:46:21] doesn't matter he could pray underneath
[1:46:22] his breath right one time I was at the
[1:46:26] camp and the Youth Camp I still had one
[1:46:28] more service to preach and I I called
[1:46:30] brother Daniel Andy I said look you ask
[1:46:32] what the need is and I'm going to pray
[1:46:35] but I'm going to pray in my heart
[1:46:36] because I got one more service to go and
[1:46:38] I have no voice right now matter of fact
[1:46:40] that last voice and that last service I
[1:46:42] had a pile of those essential oil cough
[1:46:46] drops that somebody gave me you know the
[1:46:49] essential oils stand on one foot and it
[1:46:50] work I'm just EAS you know I I but those
[1:46:52] those actual those those those those I
[1:46:54] think those those cough drops actually
[1:46:56] helped me I kept on popping one in I
[1:46:58] just kind of took a teaching service but
[1:46:59] my point was this I didn't even pray out
[1:47:01] loud it ain't about how forceful we all
[1:47:04] look at we're all different I mean and
[1:47:06] not everybody preaches like me I Don't
[1:47:07] Preach like everybody else I don't want
[1:47:09] to preach like nobody else I just want
[1:47:11] to be what God has made
[1:47:14] me otherwise we're an impersonator and a
[1:47:17] hypocrite it don't matter about how loud
[1:47:20] it is but God hears Faith yes amen he
[1:47:24] couldn't hear blind bmus he didn't hear
[1:47:26] his voice it was faith it was not that
[1:47:28] woman's touch he felt it was a faith
[1:47:31] touch
[1:47:33] Hallelujah you hear me friends you see
[1:47:36] how how things want to take us away from
[1:47:38] what the real appropriated way is it's
[1:47:40] why the word comes is to build the
[1:47:42] spirit of God is to build our faith in
[1:47:45] the word it's a finished work what we
[1:47:47] have to do is accept
[1:47:49] it amen that's right glory be to God
[1:47:53] Amen Oh My Brother Sam you against
[1:47:56] prayer lines you know better than that
[1:47:57] I'm not against prayer lines I'm just
[1:47:59] trying to tell you that the only thing
[1:48:00] that will give you what you need is
[1:48:02] faith if you don't come through the
[1:48:04] prayer line with
[1:48:06] faith that's good that's good so it's
[1:48:10] all it's humility God builds from the
[1:48:12] way up brother BR says just get get
[1:48:15] humble and get away from all your
[1:48:16] worldly thinking and humble yourselves
[1:48:18] before God so I want you to watch how
[1:48:21] we're I'm turning this here because we
[1:48:24] look at God working in our life in this
[1:48:26] stature of a perfect man all of these
[1:48:30] attributes well I don't know where
[1:48:32] there's my there's my thing all of these
[1:48:35] attributes Peter has already said God
[1:48:38] has already given us these see you know
[1:48:41] what these are these are like the
[1:48:42] clothes in your suitcase they're already
[1:48:44] in the seed it isn't oh I got to get
[1:48:47] Faith and then the next got to get the
[1:48:49] next one I got to get the next one I got
[1:48:53] oh now I've fallen off no no no no that
[1:48:55] that's that's error that's so that's
[1:48:59] error yeah this is where this is there
[1:49:02] it's Christ in us we come under the word
[1:49:05] for our day we are birthed by the word
[1:49:08] of God and then this is why the prophet
[1:49:11] said if you try to do this without being
[1:49:13] born again what does he say it's like
[1:49:15] trying to put black bird or peacock
[1:49:19] feathers and a black
[1:49:20] bird right you don't need to if you're a
[1:49:23] peacock peacock feathers come out right
[1:49:27] sister Mercy you remember about peacocks
[1:49:28] where you always us to live she can tell
[1:49:30] you about them so we're talking about
[1:49:31] some not mean-spirited peacocks here but
[1:49:34] these you know the these These are in
[1:49:37] us and you know what we don't just sit
[1:49:39] around drinking coffee and eating a
[1:49:40] donut and thinking you know what this a
[1:49:42] good morning for temperance no it's
[1:49:45] usually Temperance is selfcontrol
[1:49:47] it's when it requires situations right
[1:49:51] that maybe that tongue wants to get a
[1:49:53] little
[1:49:53] loose our feeling wants to go in a
[1:49:56] certain way but remember the overcoming
[1:49:59] route is from his feet to his
[1:50:04] throne that's so good it's always in
[1:50:07] this place remember where the Bible
[1:50:09] tells us the last scripture we read for
[1:50:10] our text she was instructed to lay at
[1:50:13] his feet right until the morning
[1:50:17] breaks lay at his feet that's how God
[1:50:21] builds his church he said Upon This Rock
[1:50:24] I'll build my church when you look at
[1:50:25] this of Moses think of how the prophet
[1:50:27] spoke of this here think of how that God
[1:50:30] would build his church how does God
[1:50:32] build his church by his word how did God
[1:50:35] when this pedestal the prophet would
[1:50:37] pick this out this pedestal and he would
[1:50:39] say before God put the image he first
[1:50:42] had a pedestal it had four layers
[1:50:45] Abraham Faith that's good is that right
[1:50:49] Isaac love next one Jacob he said
[1:50:52] anybody read Jacob's life got to believe
[1:50:54] in God's grace then the next pedestal
[1:50:58] that's on top is Joseph Perfection
[1:51:00] that's what God built his church on he
[1:51:03] built it on himself so it's word on top
[1:51:05] of word on top of word on top of word on
[1:51:08] top of word on top of
[1:51:11] word what is it going from his feet to
[1:51:14] the
[1:51:16] throne I'm not going backwards brother
[1:51:18] Joy we're not going downwards the word
[1:51:20] you say well I I'm looking at this in my
[1:51:22] life life but if you look at it through
[1:51:24] the word you'll not be looking down on
[1:51:26] yourself you'll see what the word is not
[1:51:29] pointing you to look down but you're
[1:51:31] taking a true inventory of your life and
[1:51:33] saying God that's the Mark I that's what
[1:51:36] I'm called to that's what I'm going to
[1:51:38] rise to Lord go God forgive me Lord give
[1:51:41] me Grace to rise to that because the
[1:51:43] word is never pulling you
[1:51:47] down the word never pulls you down the
[1:51:50] word is always drawing you up
[1:51:53] right the call the call come up hi come
[1:51:55] up hither come up a little
[1:52:00] higher a word
[1:52:02] bride she's received what he has given
[1:52:06] to her she's not taken not taking what
[1:52:09] she wants what she feels she's a word
[1:52:13] bride she's been made up from the
[1:52:16] feet Hallelujah where the ground where
[1:52:19] it went in the ground at the Nia Council
[1:52:22] then came back a little Sprout that just
[1:52:24] shall live by faith what was the basis
[1:52:27] Faith then it went from Faith moved on
[1:52:30] up into sanctification is that right
[1:52:32] moving on up into sanctification then
[1:52:35] moving on up you know into the baptism
[1:52:37] of the Holy Ghost there that's what we
[1:52:40] have there with the the mouth right Aza
[1:52:43] street right come on the gifts being
[1:52:45] restored back but but you know what the
[1:52:47] the bride is not just to be a
[1:52:50] mouth so God help me not just to be a
[1:52:53] mouth help me to have some ears here too
[1:52:56] is that right because they that have
[1:52:58] ears remember God gave an eye and the
[1:53:00] Bible said if thine eye be single then
[1:53:03] thy whole body shall be full of light
[1:53:05] huah and God provided an eye in this day
[1:53:09] a seer in this day a prophet in this day
[1:53:12] according to his word for what for light
[1:53:14] to come into the body amen because there
[1:53:17] is a time of unity but it would be a
[1:53:21] word that would call her
[1:53:23] to his
[1:53:24] feet in total
[1:53:28] submission not you better do this if you
[1:53:30] don't do this no the bride is not moved
[1:53:33] are you hearing me the bride is not
[1:53:35] moved by National Force right that's
[1:53:40] Israel are you with me that's Israel you
[1:53:42] better do this you better do that that
[1:53:44] we can take a lesson with that in our
[1:53:45] families too but it's moved that didn't
[1:53:49] well that's a separate thing me I could
[1:53:50] preach that cuz I don't want somebody to
[1:53:51] take that so Loosey good but the bride
[1:53:54] is moved by spiritual
[1:53:57] unction is that
[1:54:01] right can I have just a couple more
[1:54:03] minutes let me finish this thought
[1:54:06] here so we want to go on to
[1:54:08] Perfection this is very
[1:54:11] important from his feet because in our
[1:54:16] lives as we read this scripture where
[1:54:18] Paul is adonic let me just read it leave
[1:54:20] the prin let us leaving the prin of the
[1:54:22] doctrines of Christ let us go on to
[1:54:24] Perfection not laying again the
[1:54:27] foundation of repentance from dead works
[1:54:29] and of Faith toward god of the doctrine
[1:54:31] of baptisms and of laying on of hands
[1:54:33] and of resurrection of the dead and of
[1:54:36] Eternal judgment and this will we do if
[1:54:38] God permit in other words as it's
[1:54:40] necessary we're going to text these
[1:54:43] things but in order to go on to
[1:54:45] Perfection where God is calling us into
[1:54:48] position it's going to take a word that
[1:54:51] brings us into position
[1:54:52] okay we've had our start there's been
[1:54:55] repentance there's a baptism there's you
[1:54:57] know that of a resurrection of that yeah
[1:54:59] but we got to go on into Perfection so
[1:55:02] in going on into Perfection are you
[1:55:04] hearing me
[1:55:05] now God wants to remove us from being so
[1:55:09] wrapped up in our status of where we
[1:55:14] are am I Son of God am I a daughter of
[1:55:17] God do I have the Holy Spirit do I not
[1:55:20] see Satan's desire is to keep us
[1:55:23] wrapped in
[1:55:25] that when God's calling us to go on to
[1:55:28] Perfection you say well how do I know
[1:55:31] okay look at what you
[1:55:33] were before the word was applied to your
[1:55:37] life and look at what you are now the
[1:55:41] prophet said what were your desires
[1:55:42] before what are your desires now see
[1:55:45] that's what you're looking at your
[1:55:46] desires you you've been baptized in the
[1:55:49] name of the Lord Jesus Christ you you
[1:55:52] you you you repented all that has went
[1:55:54] together what has that done that's been
[1:55:55] because his Spirit like that of Naomi
[1:55:58] speaking to Ruth has drawed up on your
[1:56:00] heart and brought us to that place right
[1:56:02] his presence it wasn't Peter going out
[1:56:04] and passing out P pamphlets about hey
[1:56:07] this is what you need to do he preached
[1:56:09] the word and as he preached the word the
[1:56:12] spirit of God was there to back it up
[1:56:14] and the spirit of God being there
[1:56:16] stirred up the hearts and said hey I
[1:56:18] want
[1:56:19] that you want what you want to be a
[1:56:22] preach know I want that that that what's
[1:56:24] being presented what was it it was
[1:56:27] Christ that was being presented
[1:56:29] Hallelujah stepen presented it to
[1:56:31] religious people and the Bible said they
[1:56:33] acted like dogs they nashed on him with
[1:56:36] their
[1:56:37] teeth is that right so with this of
[1:56:41] repentance sure every day we die daily
[1:56:46] right the Holy Spirit directs with
[1:56:48] things in our lives and we have to say
[1:56:50] Lord forgive me if if it's a real real
[1:56:52] true repentance is not do well God you
[1:56:54] understand no it's where remember with
[1:56:56] depth
[1:56:59] Lord just really pouring our hearts out
[1:57:02] before him and I wanted to say it in
[1:57:04] this way this is how let me read this
[1:57:07] quote to
[1:57:08] you this when you think of Our Lives God
[1:57:12] picking us up like clay out of the
[1:57:15] Potter's field anybody ever work with
[1:57:17] Clay when you were in
[1:57:19] school okay
[1:57:23] man I like when my kids they got
[1:57:25] Play-Doh I love that stuff now I didn't
[1:57:29] eat it little Aaron I didn't need it
[1:57:31] I'll be on
[1:57:33] that but you know you work with clay
[1:57:35] and I I'm no I'm no artist I don't even
[1:57:38] attempt to be that but uh I remember
[1:57:41] we'd have to work with it in school it
[1:57:42] wouldn't play though but you know they
[1:57:44] they'd have so much and they cut cut you
[1:57:45] off and then you could make something
[1:57:48] you know of course you we weren't
[1:57:49] working on a potter's wheel they
[1:57:50] actually had those places in some Dusky
[1:57:53] high school but I I didn't take that
[1:57:54] that depth of art because simply stick
[1:57:57] figures was Advanced for
[1:57:59] me but my point is is that uh that piece
[1:58:03] of clay it's taken with a purpose to
[1:58:07] become a
[1:58:08] vessel that's good and remember God has
[1:58:13] chosen you and I to be a
[1:58:15] vessel and he takes a hold of our
[1:58:18] life and he picks us up out of the clay
[1:58:22] all clay this is no different from
[1:58:24] anybody else and he picks us up out of
[1:58:26] that out of all out of the clay that's
[1:58:28] there and then he begins to mold us and
[1:58:31] put us on his will and work in us you
[1:58:33] know and they'll pound it and they're
[1:58:35] this and man it's it can be kind of
[1:58:37] rough but then as he starts working with
[1:58:40] it it's all coming to a place with a
[1:58:42] purpose in mind yeah that's good that
[1:58:45] this vessel would serve a purpose see
[1:58:49] God doesn't make a vessel like we did
[1:58:51] for our parents
[1:58:52] and we put our name on it what year we
[1:58:54] made it and then they put it on their
[1:58:57] night shelf over there
[1:58:59] oh Aaron made that when he was this oh
[1:59:03] a't that you know a't that PR dust it
[1:59:05] off Ain that one look at that and then
[1:59:07] they go back in memory that go God
[1:59:09] didn't listen let me tell you something
[1:59:11] God didn't call you to put you on a
[1:59:13] shelf God hasn't done what he's done in
[1:59:16] your life to put you on a shelf your
[1:59:18] experience is not something he's given
[1:59:19] you in your life to be on a Shelf right
[1:59:22] amen but you're called to be in service
[1:59:28] amen Now watch how the prophet brings
[1:59:30] this
[1:59:32] here God's choosing go to where I've got
[1:59:35] it highlighted there where it says his
[1:59:37] choosing is of his own he makes vessels
[1:59:39] unto honor and dishonor he says then
[1:59:40] those chosen ones born of his spirit
[1:59:44] will be trained to conform to His Image
[1:59:47] in their
[1:59:49] walk see from born of his Spirit now now
[1:59:52] it's time to
[1:59:54] walk hold my finger remember when they
[1:59:56] were just learning to walk we had to
[1:59:58] hold our finger and sometimes they fall
[1:59:59] and hey hey hey move that move that
[2:00:01] sharp edge right pretty soon you clear
[2:00:04] everything clear all is there any
[2:00:05] furniture in our house no no furniture
[2:00:07] is safe is there any electricity we can
[2:00:09] you no no none of it
[2:00:11] say right see God don't remove all the
[2:00:14] sharp tables no you don't remove all the
[2:00:17] sharp tables God don't put what I don't
[2:00:19] know what the name of that baby first or
[2:00:21] whatever it is putting star foam around
[2:00:23] edges and do but neither is God careless
[2:00:26] that's he's right there with us that's
[2:00:28] am like the prophet when he talked about
[2:00:30] Billy Paul walking into the kitchen and
[2:00:32] wanting a and wanting a bottle when
[2:00:34] after his mama had died he said Billy
[2:00:36] took off walking and he said you know he
[2:00:38] said he said we have one of them rugs
[2:00:40] that just sweep right from underneath
[2:00:42] you and he said I was right there by
[2:00:43] Billy and he said his foot caught that
[2:00:45] rug and he said up when his feet he said
[2:00:48] but I was there to grab
[2:00:49] him so he didn't fall how many times God
[2:00:53] has been there and he will be there to
[2:00:57] grab us
[2:01:00] hallelujah he rep reproves with all
[2:01:03] longsuffering and gentleness and mercy
[2:01:05] he chastens with nail scarred hands
[2:01:08] sometimes this Potter must take the
[2:01:10] vessel he's working on and thoroughly
[2:01:14] break it down in order that he may
[2:01:17] rebuild it exactly as he desires
[2:01:23] true I don't know about you but these
[2:01:25] these These are portions of quotes and
[2:01:27] just so inspired to my heart the other
[2:01:29] night after we left the service and
[2:01:31] every every time I've read this quote I
[2:01:32] look at that and think because sometimes
[2:01:34] in our minds we can look back on it and
[2:01:36] we think so is he taking the whole
[2:01:38] vessel and just completely smashing the
[2:01:40] whole vessel after after he's already my
[2:01:43] life I've been born of his Spirit no
[2:01:46] that's not what the prophet is saying
[2:01:48] there are some areas of our life to
[2:01:51] where God has to take us down to the
[2:01:54] feet and he says within this right here
[2:01:57] as he's building he's working remember
[2:01:59] he's building from that foundation stone
[2:02:01] on the inside and God has to work with
[2:02:03] things in our life and sometimes break
[2:02:06] it down to a place that he can build it
[2:02:10] to where he wants but you know what I'm
[2:02:13] in his hands I'm on his will amen he's
[2:02:17] in my life I'm in him he's working in my
[2:02:20] life he's there molding and shaping my
[2:02:22] character and he permits the test and
[2:02:25] trials to shape me and to mold me and to
[2:02:29] bring me just exactly to where he would
[2:02:32] have me to be and where he has you to be
[2:02:34] yes sir every work that God does he
[2:02:38] works from the foundation yeah it's just
[2:02:41] like in our lives remember when brother
[2:02:43] Boaz was here and he was ministering on
[2:02:44] that that sometimes we we we we don't
[2:02:47] real why am I why is this coming out why
[2:02:49] is this almost like this comes by and
[2:02:52] that's the reaction it's not about other
[2:02:54] people no that's right oh come on now
[2:02:58] come on not about other people it's like
[2:03:00] why what what is that that's what we
[2:03:03] need to say Lord help me you see that's
[2:03:05] why God allows that God doesn't allow
[2:03:07] when things like that happen am I the
[2:03:10] only one no when God allows things like
[2:03:12] that to happen you know what that's all
[2:03:14] about it's us coming to a place either
[2:03:16] are we going to say Lord this or that
[2:03:18] but remember the only way to get
[2:03:20] anywhere with God the way up is
[2:03:23] down lord show me is there a complex
[2:03:26] built back in my
[2:03:28] life what is this Lord why why does this
[2:03:31] keep coming why is this response coming
[2:03:34] like it is Lord then we're getting in a
[2:03:37] place coming to his
[2:03:40] feet and if we can uncover his feet and
[2:03:43] just lay ourselves down and say
[2:03:46] Lord I want the word to so come into
[2:03:49] that area Lord Lord you're in my life
[2:03:51] Lord you know what's there Lord it isn't
[2:03:53] that things aren't glisten friends it
[2:03:55] isn't that we're ever going to get to a
[2:03:56] place that oh this don't bother us this
[2:03:58] don't bother us we're Overcomers it
[2:04:00] isn't that you're ever going to get to a
[2:04:02] place of you don't have a bad thought or
[2:04:04] this it isn't that at all but the
[2:04:06] overcoming is being able to quickly
[2:04:09] recognize
[2:04:10] it and recognize he that's in you has
[2:04:14] already overcome that thing when a
[2:04:17] thought of lust wants to go through then
[2:04:19] recognize quickly as God brings you to
[2:04:21] that my brother recognize that God in
[2:04:24] you has already overcome that
[2:04:27] thing that's overcoming yes it that's
[2:04:30] standing there with our lives prior or
[2:04:33] before his feet you love
[2:04:36] him we want to be laid I want to be laid
[2:04:38] at his disposal don't
[2:04:41] you I want to be laid like Ruth was I
[2:04:44] don't care I don't care what nobody says
[2:04:46] I don't care what my workers say I don't
[2:04:47] care what anybody says I I want to be
[2:04:49] one with him I I want to walk with him
[2:04:52] that's I I don't care about nothing else
[2:04:53] it's him is that
[2:04:56] right let me read this last quote to you
[2:05:00] here but the BR says I'll probably he's
[2:05:02] talkinging about Mary
[2:05:04] Magdalene he said I'll probably never be
[2:05:06] able to stand where she stood but one of
[2:05:08] these days I'm going to preach my last
[2:05:11] sermon my last drop of persperation will
[2:05:14] fall off my face last time tears will
[2:05:17] ever dim my eyes I'm going to stand in
[2:05:20] his presence and say I want to come up I
[2:05:24] I don't want a palace I don't want
[2:05:26] nothing great I just want to crawl up to
[2:05:28] his precious feet and Pat them a little
[2:05:31] and kiss them once and then turn away it
[2:05:34] would pay me for
[2:05:36] everything I've ever
[2:05:39] done we never get away from his feet in
[2:05:44] that it's the humility and submission to
[2:05:49] him and from his feet
[2:05:52] EET Here

[2:06:39] prepared for you from before the
[2:06:42] foundation of the world you love
[2:06:46] him oh let's stand
[2:06:56] when Lazarus was raised from the dead
[2:06:58] brother Joey the next chapter you find
[2:07:00] him he's at the Lord jesus'
[2:07:03] feet when the maniac we only know Legion
[2:07:07] that one his name I don't know what his
[2:07:08] name is but one of these days I'm going
[2:07:09] to meet him we're going to meet him amen
[2:07:13] but you know what brother Brian right
[2:07:14] after he was at the
[2:07:16] feet he was at the feet right there's
[2:07:19] where you found him he was right at his
[2:07:23] feet Mary magaline that's what brother
[2:07:26] bram's referring to in this quote Mary
[2:07:29] magaline Jesus had come into the house
[2:07:31] of
[2:07:32] Simon they didn't wash his feet they
[2:07:35] didn't anoint
[2:07:36] him but she looked over and saw him
[2:07:39] there something be to stir in her
[2:07:44] heart go do him a
[2:07:47] service she went she took from all of
[2:07:51] her lip
[2:07:52] living bought that anointment that
[2:07:55] ointment she walked through there oh my
[2:07:59] can you imagine the
[2:08:01] gasps and all of the talking mean you it
[2:08:04] weren't even words maybe that even had
[2:08:06] to be said it was just you just felt it
[2:08:09] I know we're in living in a big age of
[2:08:10] feelings but you know you just it was
[2:08:13] real it wasn't her imagination cuz no
[2:08:16] doubt she heard the
[2:08:18] gasps remember because they even said in
[2:08:21] their heart remember what was said in
[2:08:24] the heart speaks louder than what's said
[2:08:26] right here and Jesus caught what was in
[2:08:28] their heart if he knew what manner of
[2:08:29] man woman was touching him he would have
[2:08:31] nothing to do with her but the word knew
[2:08:33] what was beneath yes he
[2:08:38] did and she
[2:08:40] came she laid down
[2:08:43] everything sister Rosanne like that song
[2:08:45] you sing The Alabaster Box she laid down
[2:08:48] her
[2:08:49] entire life
[2:08:52] at his
[2:08:54] feet she didn't know how she was going
[2:08:56] to wash his feet but God provided what
[2:09:00] he was moving upon on her heart to do
[2:09:03] she dried his feet with her
[2:09:06] [Music]
[2:09:07] hair God
[2:09:09] supplied what he was moving in her heart
[2:09:12] to
[2:09:13] do you know what God moves and draws us
[2:09:16] in our
[2:09:17] hearts it's very important don't don't
[2:09:20] don't push it away but it's very
[2:09:23] important to act upon that
[2:09:25] pulsation as God deals with your heart
[2:09:28] maybe it's on repentance maybe it's on
[2:09:31] really fully surrendering your
[2:09:33] life maybe it's in a place of Lord
[2:09:36] there's some things that maybe in the
[2:09:38] midst of a test of a trial and molding
[2:09:41] and you realize this is there's some
[2:09:43] hard things that's really pressing it's
[2:09:44] a
[2:09:45] moment he'll Supply what's needed just
[2:09:50] move upon that pulsation
[2:09:52] just get to him get in his presence
[2:09:55] don't worry about who you are what
[2:09:57] you've done no Mary
[2:10:00] Magdalene came to
[2:10:03] him and when it was all said and done he
[2:10:07] said
[2:10:08] daughter thy faith thy faith thy
[2:10:13] [Music]
[2:10:14] faith hath saved
[2:10:17] thee see they he was all around
[2:10:20] individuals that works it's got to be
[2:10:22] touched and works and all th faith has
[2:10:24] saved
[2:10:26] thee go and S no more she
[2:10:31] received
[2:10:32] deliverance from Seven demons right
[2:10:38] there Prophet tells us all of those
[2:10:40] those Seven Devils that she had around
[2:10:43] her life you know what it was it was
[2:10:45] accumulation of things from even when
[2:10:46] she was young hurts and things had
[2:10:49] mounted up and it became it became like
[2:10:52] Caverns places for them to move
[2:10:54] into but in the presence of the word
[2:10:59] himself she was able to lay everything
[2:11:02] down and you know what she never picked
[2:11:04] up that lifestyle again you know why
[2:11:06] because she had been separated from it
[2:11:08] by the
[2:11:11] word I say oh God this
[2:11:15] morning may his grace just move down in
[2:11:18] such a
[2:11:19] way brother br asked a question like
[2:11:22] this brother
[2:11:24] brandham I can't give over completely to
[2:11:27] Jesus do I have an evil
[2:11:30] spirit and brother Brown will answer and
[2:11:32] say I don't believe you have an evil
[2:11:35] spirit but I believe it's an evil spirit
[2:11:37] that's anointing your thinking to try
[2:11:40] and make you think you
[2:11:42] can't and he said here's how you need to
[2:11:44] approach
[2:11:46] it he said Just Surrender yourself that
[2:11:49] way as a woman woman who has fought all
[2:11:52] of her life to keep her virtue and then
[2:11:54] she surrenders it to the man of her
[2:11:56] dreams her
[2:11:58] husband he said this is the way you
[2:12:00] surrendered all that I am all my mind
[2:12:02] all my
[2:12:03] thoughts look at this it's just very
[2:12:06] simple Lord my thinking my all that I am
[2:12:10] I want to give it to you my life I give
[2:12:14] as a life of service take me Lord and
[2:12:17] use me just as I am amen
[2:12:22] that is not just a slide it's not just a
[2:12:27] quote but I'll tell you this right now I
[2:12:29] believe this with all my heart if your
[2:12:32] heart is longing for a place and a
[2:12:34] moment of surrender I've tried it
[2:12:35] doesn't matter what you've
[2:12:37] tried but if we can just have faith in
[2:12:40] what the word has made a way for us then
[2:12:43] if you can take that that simple place
[2:12:46] of statement and
[2:12:48] say what has been directed to say Lord
[2:12:51] take all of my
[2:12:53] thinking I I want to say it right now I
[2:12:56] know my life has been changed I know
[2:12:58] what God has done for me but you know
[2:12:59] what Lord take all my
[2:13:02] thinking right here aresh take all my
[2:13:05] thinking all that I am I want to give it
[2:13:07] all to
[2:13:08] you I I want to surrender Lord more of
[2:13:11] my life I I want to surrender Lord More
[2:13:14] Of Me Lord when brother Brandon would
[2:13:16] preach perfect strength perfect weakness
[2:13:18] he said this Tabernacle needs a fresh
[2:13:21] killing and he said I need one with it
[2:13:24] what was he talking about from the feet
[2:13:27] to his
[2:13:28] throne when he would say while the
[2:13:31] Tabernacle is having a Revival I want to
[2:13:33] have one I want more of the Holy Ghost
[2:13:36] that'll make me more of a servant like
[2:13:38] he
[2:13:39] is notice what the request was not that
[2:13:42] I could do this or do this or do that no
[2:13:43] no I want to be more of a servant he
[2:13:45] said I want to be more humble more of a
[2:13:48] servant that's what I want I want more
[2:13:52] Lord amen amen let's just bow our
[2:13:55] heads Heavenly
[2:13:59] Father times Lord
[2:14:01] where in moments like these
[2:14:05] Lord how precious it is Lord as you
[2:14:07] would speak to our hearts Lord in these
[2:14:12] tender hidden passages of your word
[2:14:16] Lord like one Lord God who
[2:14:21] not only to coming coming to Behold a
[2:14:25] drama but Lord to recognize
[2:14:28] that there's a backstage pass to it
[2:14:32] Lord that's what Solomon spoke to the
[2:14:36] bride when he would address her and say
[2:14:37] oh my
[2:14:39] Dove let me see thy countenance let me
[2:14:42] hear thy voice thou that are in the
[2:14:47] secret of the stairs
[2:14:51] Lord
[2:14:52] Jesus and we're not only
[2:14:56] Lord in these hidden passages but the
[2:14:59] real reality of it
[2:15:01] is is when Lord God we can
[2:15:05] recognize that we're a part of it
[2:15:07] Lord we've always been a part of
[2:15:10] it I pray Heavenly
[2:15:14] Father Lord I'm asking that right here
[2:15:16] this
[2:15:17] morning across this audience Lord there
[2:15:20] are needs Among
[2:15:22] Us hearts Lord that father in different
[2:15:27] stages in their walk with you but God as
[2:15:30] you spoke to us this morning every
[2:15:32] moment is a
[2:15:34] decision a decision Lord to keep moving
[2:15:37] Lord that decision Lord oh God Lord that
[2:15:42] would draw us and lead us Lord to that
[2:15:45] place to uncover your feet and to lay
[2:15:49] down lay our self lay our will down and
[2:15:54] and take orders from the word Lord
[2:15:57] father I don't want to be my own ruler
[2:16:01] Lord because frankly
[2:16:04] Lord I really wasn't my own ruler I was
[2:16:07] under the rule of The Prince and power
[2:16:10] of the air as Paul spoke to us in
[2:16:13] Ephesians
[2:16:14] 2 but the mercy of God came on the
[2:16:18] scene and Lord we have been quickened
[2:16:20] the light shined Lord down in our life
[2:16:23] we were like one of those Pond lies that
[2:16:25] was buried down deep in the bottom of
[2:16:28] the pond and the light begin to
[2:16:30] penetrate Lord and we begin to rise
[2:16:33] upward upward upward upward upward
[2:16:36] upward Lord until we're above the
[2:16:41] pond Lord
[2:16:44] Jesus I realize Lord no matter where we
[2:16:48] would be at in our walk with you we are
[2:16:50] in that place
[2:16:52] Lord of
[2:16:54] continual molding and
[2:16:57] shaping if there's one Lord that's here
[2:16:59] that doesn't know you in that
[2:17:01] way that God their heart Lord has been
[2:17:04] stirred and Lord Jesus even as those
[2:17:07] words that I put up there at the very
[2:17:09] end that
[2:17:11] Lord that Lord God may you just breathe
[2:17:14] into their hearts Lord just to be able
[2:17:15] to express that Lord for even that of
[2:17:19] Salvation Lord for that Lord that real
[2:17:22] surrendering Lord of their life that
[2:17:23] Lord I want to turn my life over I I
[2:17:25] don't want to keep it Lord I don't want
[2:17:28] to hold on to it because as you said in
[2:17:30] your word if I if I keep my life I'll
[2:17:32] lose it but if I'm willing to lose it
[2:17:35] surrender it then I'll find it
[2:17:39] Lord granted Lord Jesus I pray this
[2:17:42] morning Lord hallu may we lord
[2:17:47] God take up our cross daily Lord
[2:17:51] some of your children Lord standing
[2:17:54] here Lord God maybe Lord in the thick
[2:17:57] and the heat of a trial Lord there a
[2:18:02] Temptation Lord that's come their
[2:18:04] way and
[2:18:07] father I pray that
[2:18:09] [Music]
[2:18:11] God that as their heart Lord just being
[2:18:15] warned by the great rays of the S so
[2:18:19] n Lord that's where you met the Hebrew
[2:18:22] children you didn't abandon them but
[2:18:24] when they got in that fiery furnace Lord
[2:18:27] you met them right
[2:18:30] there Lord
[2:18:32] Jesus I pray father right here this
[2:18:35] morning for lives and hearts Lord that
[2:18:38] may be Lord right in the midst of
[2:18:40] decisions Lord right in the midst of
[2:18:42] Trials or tests and things that's going
[2:18:44] on Lord in their life and wondering how
[2:18:46] what will I do here what will be the
[2:18:48] next decision what would be the outcome
