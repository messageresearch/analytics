[28:49] Alas,

[28:56] sovereign die?
[29:00] Would he devote that sacred head for
[29:06] such a word as I? Well, at the cross, at

[34:48] you praise.

[34:55] the life,
[35:00] the truth,
[35:03] the way.
[35:07] Oh, I bless
[35:10] your name.
[35:13] [Music]
[35:15] I bless
[35:17] your name.
[35:22] Hallelujah.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's certainly worthy, isn't he?
[35:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. What grace that God has
[35:29] shown to our lives and what a liberty
[35:32] that he's brought and you know I thought
[35:34] of that song we were singing freedom to
[35:37] worship and um we were speaking we were
[35:40] speaking there in Texas and I said you
[35:42] know you have the two words of liberty
[35:43] and freedom. One of the brothers brought
[35:45] it up in the office and I said, you
[35:47] know, uh, in the the scripture when it
[35:49] says that that we come into that liberty
[35:53] as it speaks in 2 Corinthians 3, it says
[35:56] that they change from glory into glory.
[35:59] And that liberty, I said, you realize
[36:01] that word liberty is is to be whom God
[36:04] has ordained you to be as a son and
[36:06] daughter of God. We have received an
[36:08] authority in our lives. and and freedom.
[36:11] You know, many times we we hear the
[36:13] scripture quoted that he whom the son
[36:15] sets free and that's not the scripture.
[36:16] The scripture said he's who the son has
[36:18] made free
[36:20] &gt;&gt; is free indeed.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; And made is a creation.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He He just didn't loosen the
[36:26] cage. But there new creation moved on
[36:27] the inside by the spirit of God. And
[36:29] we're a new creation. That's why there's
[36:31] no tie back to the past because the the
[36:34] old man is dead. There's there's nothing
[36:36] there. The the new creation on the
[36:38] inside is tied in. Amen. So there's that
[36:41] that's that's such a such a liberty.
[36:43] It's a real freedom. Amen. In our lives,
[36:46] Amen. We're not looking back over our
[36:48] shoulders, but we are truly God's
[36:50] brought us into a place where now we're
[36:52] no longer the tail. We're the head.
[36:54] Amen. And that's why the prophet said,
[36:56] "As soon as you come into the promised
[36:57] land," he said, you watch your prayers
[36:59] change then. And so you begin to take
[37:02] things personal. And these are promises
[37:04] that God has equipped me to take. Amen.
[37:07] So, we're so glad to be in the house of
[37:09] the Lord here tonight. Amen. Glad to
[37:11] have brother Timothy with us. And we
[37:13] just want to go ahead and invite him to
[37:15] go ahead and come. Brother Timothy is a
[37:16] real friend. I've been a real brother
[37:18] and uh real blessing to to us as a as a
[37:22] local body. And so, we're thankful that
[37:24] uh you know, time making time to be with
[37:26] us each of the times he comes. and um
[37:29] you know he comes twice a year now to
[37:31] follow up on checkups and things like
[37:33] that because how God healed him of the
[37:35] of the cancer and so he's very very
[37:38] adamant within the every six months and
[37:40] so I'm just to me we're just blessed
[37:42] that he would take and make time out of
[37:45] his schedule to come by and visit us.
[37:47] Amen. So we we we just thank God for

[43:44] the people of God that uh we keep
[43:46] pressing on.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; One of these days the meeting will be in

[43:51] &gt;&gt; There is going to be a meeting. Amen.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; In the air one of these days. Sweet by
[43:57] and by. Amen.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; What a day that will be. Praise the
[44:02] Lord. So let's read from the Gospel of
[44:04] St. Luke this evening. Luke chapter 13.
[44:11] Luke chapter 13.
[44:16] And let us read from verse 10.
[44:27] We read,
[44:29] "And
[44:30] he was teaching in one of the synagogues
[44:34] on the Sabbath day.
[44:37] And behold, there was a woman which had
[44:39] a spirit of infirmity
[44:42] 18 years,
[44:44] and was bowed together,
[44:47] and could in no wise
[44:50] lift up herself."
[44:53] And when Jesus saw her,
[44:56] he called her to him and said unto her,
[45:01] &gt;&gt; "Woman,
[45:03] thou art loosed from thy infirmity."
[45:08] &gt;&gt; And he laid his hands on her,
[45:11] and immediately she was made straight
[45:16] and glorify God.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:19] And the ruler of the synagogue answered
[45:21] with indignation
[45:24] because that Jesus has had healed on the
[45:28] Sabbath day and said unto the people,
[45:33] "There are six days in which men ought
[45:35] to work. In them, therefore, come and be
[45:38] healed, and not on the Sabbath day."
[45:44] And Jesus
[45:45] and the Lord then answered him and said,
[45:48] "Thou hypocrite."
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; I like that.
[45:54] Does not eat
[45:57] one of you on the Sabbath day lose his
[46:00] ox or his ass from the store and led him
[46:06] away to watering.
[46:09] And u not this woman
[46:12] being a daughter of Abraham,
[46:15] &gt;&gt; whom Satan have bound, lo this 18 years,
[46:21] be loose from this bound on the Sabbath
[46:25] day.
[46:27] And when he had said these things, all
[46:30] his adversaries
[46:33] were ashamed,
[46:35] &gt;&gt; and all the people rejoice for all the
[46:39] glorious things that were done by him.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And all the people rejoice
[46:46] &gt;&gt; for all the glorious things. And may we
[46:49] also rejoice
[46:50] &gt;&gt; for the glorious things which is doing
[46:52] and has done for us.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; May God bless the reading of his word.
[46:56] Let's please be seated.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; It's just you know to read the scripture
[47:06] is just wonderful. It's a blessing.
[47:08] Amen. And so just uh to just encourage
[47:11] ourselves on this uh uh story that we
[47:14] have read which was something that
[47:15] really happened in the course of our
[47:20] Lord Jesus earthly ministry.
[47:24] So the Bible said he went to one of the
[47:27] synagogues.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; So he always goes to he goes to church.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; I love that
[47:37] &gt;&gt; after he has gone round gone around gone
[47:39] round gone around he goes to church. So
[47:41] brother Brown said everybody must have a
[47:43] church home
[47:46] &gt;&gt; where you support the cause of God with
[47:48] your presence, with your tithe and with
[47:51] your offering. Amen. So Jesus when he
[47:55] was here, he went to church.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us so.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; We remember one day when he went to
[48:03] church and they give him the scroll to
[48:05] read.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; And he took the scroll and he read
[48:10] &gt;&gt; and he said this day this scripture is
[48:12] fulfilled.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; And then he said, "You will tell me
[48:15] physician heal yourself." So they they
[48:17] make fun of him, mockery of him. Yeah.
[48:21] But he's the Lord. Amen.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; And he knows all about it. And no man's
[48:26] behavior surprises him.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Nothing surpris He know what people will
[48:32] be doing. He knows all about it. And he
[48:34] knows all about us today.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he told us to be happy.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Rejoice.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; When men revide you and they say all
[48:44] kinds of evil things falsely against
[48:47] you,
[48:48] &gt;&gt; he said, "Rejoice. Rejoice. rejoice and
[48:51] be exceedingly
[48:53] &gt;&gt; glad.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; It didn't say we should be sad.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; It said be exceedingly glad. Be happy.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; For so persecuted then the prophets of
[49:05] old.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; And he told us in the scriptures those
[49:09] that will live godly in Christ Jesus
[49:12] will suffer persecution.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; So he said no matter what persecution we
[49:16] he said rejoice.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So just to encourage
[49:20] ourselves this evening said women that
[49:23] at loose
[49:26] &gt;&gt; from thy infirmities
[49:29] &gt;&gt; women that at loose.
[49:32] Amen. And we are loosed.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; You are loose.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Loose by the blood of Jesus.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; For the blood of Jesus shall never lose
[49:46] his power. Yes sir.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; And so Jesus went to church.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; He went to the synagogue.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; And then in the synagogue he said,
[49:59] "Behold, there was a woman
[50:02] which had a spirit of infirmity 18
[50:05] years.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; 18 years
[50:13] and was bound.
[50:18] and she could not stretch up.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; She was in this kind of condition.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; But my joy is that in that condition,
[50:28] she was still going to church.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; She could have a lot of excuses
[50:36] &gt;&gt; not to go to church. Reason not to go to
[50:38] church.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; You all know that I'm not feeling fine.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; You all know that I'm not well.
[50:45] She could not raise herself.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Nobody would have blamed her if she was
[50:52] not going to church.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; But yet in that condition she was going
[50:58] to church.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; What will be our excuse?
[51:07] &gt;&gt; And then my joy is that she didn't even
[51:10] know that day Jesus will be there.
[51:13] That's right.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; It was not broadcast. It was not there
[51:18] anywhere. But
[51:22] she went to church.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; So she was not going to church for
[51:27] anything. She was going to church
[51:28] because it is an appointment.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; She has to be there with her presence
[51:36] &gt;&gt; to support the cause of God.
[51:40] And remember that God is not ungrateful.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; To forget our labor of love.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Maybe the devil might have told them,
[51:52] "What are you going to that same church
[51:54] today?" That's good. for this years ever
[51:57] years and years yes years yes years yes
[51:58] years yes years yes years yes years yes
[51:58] years yes years yes years yes years yes
[51:59] years yes years yes years yes years yes
[51:59] years yes years yes years yes years yes
[51:59] years yes years yes years yes years yes
[51:59] years yes years yes years yes years yes
[51:59] years yes years yes years yes years yes
[52:00] &gt;&gt; you are still going to church in this
[52:02] condition
[52:05] &gt;&gt; it is always a blessing to go to church
[52:08] &gt;&gt; under any condition
[52:13] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord
[52:17] &gt;&gt; she was b and was bound together and
[52:21] could in no wise lift up herself
[52:26] She could in no wise lift up herself,
[52:30] but she was still going to church.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; What about that day if she had missed
[52:35] church service?
[52:40] &gt;&gt; What about that day if she didn't go to
[52:43] church?
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; She did not go there because she knew
[52:50] Jesus was coming. No, she went to church
[52:53] because it is it was part of her life.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. That said, look, look, I
[53:03] love God. I love God. Whatever happens,
[53:06] I love him.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; And I got to go and I must go and I and
[53:10] she continue going.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't ever get tired.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Let's keep coming to church.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Let's keep serving the Lord. Hallelujah.
[53:21] Let's keep serving the Lord.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Because God will not forget our labor of
[53:29] love.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; He will not do it.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it seems like he has
[53:38] forgotten, but he never forgets.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; He has a time. He has a plan. He has a
[53:45] purpose.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; For whatever he allows. Amen.
[53:51] Whatever happens to us, he has a purpose
[53:53] for it.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; And don't let the devil tell you that
[53:57] God don't love you.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; He has done this for this. He has done
[54:02] that for it. He has done this. What
[54:03] about you?
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Your time is coming.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Your day is coming.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Your hour is coming.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; He's God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise
[54:17] the Lord. Saints of God, never never be
[54:20] discouraged.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Don't ever be and don't don't give up.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; And don't let the enemy convince you
[54:30] that it's over. It's never over.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; It's because remember the prophet of God
[54:35] said, "Even in death, we are not
[54:36] defeated."
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, they've been praying for me. We Yes.
[54:44] We believe in prayers.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe God answers prayers.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. He does.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; And he does. And he does. And he will
[54:53] continue to answer our prayers.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Because God is faithful.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, there are many things we don't
[55:02] understand, but he knows all about it.
[55:04] And because we don't understand, it's
[55:06] good for us to leave it in his care.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Don't try to go with reason or take any
[55:12] man's explanation. just leave it in his
[55:16] care. I don't understand it. I leave it
[55:18] with you.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Because he knows all about it.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Like I've said sometime listen sometime
[55:28] the devil would want you to believe that
[55:29] it's in vain to pray.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; It's in vain to serve God. It's in vain
[55:33] to go to church. But that's a lie. It's
[55:36] never in vain.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:42] And sometime so sometime God seems to be
[55:46] quiet
[55:48] &gt;&gt; as if he doesn't hear
[55:50] &gt;&gt; but he
[55:53] &gt;&gt; and when he's quiet that the prophet
[55:55] told us besetting of God
[56:00] &gt;&gt; when you have met his requirement and he
[56:02] says not he said just be besetting
[56:06] just like that widow over there is
[56:08] Zeraphat
[56:12] She was a good woman. She was a
[56:14] believer. She trusted in God.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; And then there was crisis. No food. And
[56:20] the rent was not coming and and the food
[56:22] was just left a little
[56:25] just just the last
[56:28] &gt;&gt; and God came in at that time. Amen.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; When he was at the wit end that God came
[56:34] in there,
[56:37] &gt;&gt; you know, God had told he had told
[56:39] Elijah at that time to go to the brook
[56:41] sheriff and then he said the rabbies
[56:43] will be feeding you and and then he was
[56:46] drinking from the water here and there.
[56:48] Look, God could have kept Elijah there.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; And he would have given him water to
[56:55] drink. Right.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; If the birds were giving food, they
[56:59] would have continued to give him food.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; But God knew that woman was there.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; That woman was crying. God knew that
[57:13] woman was praying. She was faithful.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometime as if God doesn't see, he
[57:19] doesn't hear, but he sees and he hears
[57:21] and he knows everything about every one
[57:23] of us. So don't just give up.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Help is on the way coming.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Deliverance is on the way coming.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Manifestation is already coming because
[57:35] the price has already been paid.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; And then God told Elijah, "Now leave
[57:46] here. Go to Zeraphat."
[57:48] &gt;&gt; What did God say? I have commanded a
[57:50] widow woman.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; I've already done it. Right.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; The widow who didn't have anything, God
[57:57] said, "I have commanded her
[58:00] &gt;&gt; to feed you, to take care of you."
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; And Elijah started going. We know the
[58:07] story anyway.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; God never forgets.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; God never forsakes.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; God is mindful.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; And these things are written for us.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; That's right. is for us.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; For our learning,
[58:27] &gt;&gt; for us to be admonished, for us not to
[58:29] lose our faith,
[58:32] &gt;&gt; for us to believe, for us to trust the
[58:35] Lord. That's why it's written there for
[58:36] us.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; It happened there so that you and I will
[58:42] be blessed. So that in our hour of need,
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and frustration and
[58:48] difficult time, we can look back say,
[58:50] "Oh, God did it there.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; He did it there."
[58:54] &gt;&gt; When all hope seems to be finished
[58:58] &gt;&gt; when everything seems to be falling
[59:00] apart, when it seems that God came on
[59:03] the scene,
[59:07] &gt;&gt; the prophet tested a woman. He said,
[59:08] "Give me some water to drink." She was
[59:10] okay. It's okay.
[59:14] I'm just picking this two sticks and I'm
[59:17] going to prepare food so that um me and
[59:20] my son will eat in there. So said don't
[59:22] worry, just give me my own face. Oh,
[59:25] &gt;&gt; give me your first stranger. I don't
[59:27] even know where you are coming from.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; How do I give it? He said anyway. And
[59:33] she did it
[59:37] &gt;&gt; and then thus say yes the Lord
[59:40] &gt;&gt; the oil and the meal will not finish
[59:44] &gt;&gt; until the day God will send rain upon
[59:47] the earth.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Hey
[59:51] &gt;&gt; our God is alive.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Our Lord is alive.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; May God strengthen your faith.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; May God help us to believe.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; What was said about that widow woman,
[1:00:09] the Zerapat, just a poor woman, a
[1:00:13] believer.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; She trusted in God just like any of us
[1:00:17] here.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; So God can do anything
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; anytime,
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; anywhere. under any condition.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; He can change any condition.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; May you be loosed from your unbelief.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; To be loose is to be free.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; To be released, to be untied.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Just like Jesus speaking to the
[1:00:50] disciples when he was uh uh going to
[1:00:53] Jerusalem for the uh um Passover and
[1:00:56] then he tell them that okay you go to
[1:00:58] this town when you enter that way you
[1:01:00] will see an act that is tied on losing
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; right
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; unting
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; losing
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; when you are tired you cannot operate
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; you cannot move
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; but Jesus said go and lose it
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; and bring it to me
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; hallelujah lose him and bring it to me.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you are loose, you are
[1:01:22] free.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; You are loose. You are delivered.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Like Jesus said when Lazarus was raised
[1:01:32] from the dead said lose him and let him
[1:01:34] go.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Because he say he was covered with grave
[1:01:39] clothes all over said lose him.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Let him go.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Woo. And I was thinking the other day I
[1:01:48] said, "Man,
[1:01:49] we are loose. We were loose to lose
[1:01:52] people."
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; What is Jesus say? Whatever you bind on
[1:01:57] earth, I bind in heaven.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Whoever you lose on earth, I lose it.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; So he give it the power to bind and to
[1:02:04] lose.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; So before you be able to lose others,
[1:02:07] you have to be loose.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; So he lose us.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; So that we can lose others.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. He said, "Woman,
[1:02:16] you are loose."
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Listen, the blood loses.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said,
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; "The greatest weapon
[1:02:33] ever put in the hands of man is the
[1:02:38] Bible." right?
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; To be backed to be backed up with the
[1:02:45] Holy Ghost
[1:02:47] that Jesus died at Calvary
[1:02:51] to flee to free his church.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; He died at Calvary to flee the church
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; from superstitions
[1:03:02] and fear
[1:03:04] and doubts
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; and trembling.
[1:03:09] He died to free us
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; from superstitions.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; To free us from fear. Brother told us
[1:03:19] fear is a curse.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; And the people who always living in
[1:03:24] fear, fear of death. Fear of no no. He
[1:03:29] said fear not let
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; don't fear.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Every time it comes on the said don't
[1:03:36] fear. No matter how the situation might
[1:03:38] be,
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; no matter what the proclamation or
[1:03:41] declaration of the doctors or whatever
[1:03:43] around us, no, he said, "Don't fear
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; because I can change the situation.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; I am able." Hallelujah.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; The God of Daniel is still alive.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:00] when they were taking Daniel and they
[1:04:02] just throw him into a lion's den
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; just because he was praying just because
[1:04:10] oh my God brother said no matter how
[1:04:13] righteous no matter how good a person
[1:04:15] living for Christ and he does nothing
[1:04:17] but good Satan will still show his
[1:04:20] hatred because Daniel was just a good
[1:04:22] person he was just helping people he was
[1:04:24] helping the kingdom and yet they were
[1:04:26] against him
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; that's Right?
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; And because of his righteous life,
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; because he refused to go against the
[1:04:36] word of the Lord,
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; they were against him.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; And because of that,
[1:04:46] they arrested him because they didn't
[1:04:48] want him to go to church. They didn't
[1:04:49] want him to pray. They didn't want He
[1:04:51] said, "I will do it." Because it was
[1:04:54] part of his life.
[1:04:58] He knew they will come after him.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; But he also believed that God is able to
[1:05:03] deliver him.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; And so when they came upon him and they
[1:05:07] took him and then oh
[1:05:10] even the king knew that these people
[1:05:13] were just against Daniel.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; He knew it.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; He was sad.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; And the king prayed for Daniel.
[1:05:24] The king who signed the book he prayed
[1:05:27] for Daniel.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh Daniel,
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; servant of the most high God,
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; servant of the living God,
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; sir,
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; may your God
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Whom you faithfully serve,
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; oh
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; whom you faithfully serve,
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; may your God deliver you
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; from the lions,
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; this was the prayer of his enemy,
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; the king that signed the paper.
[1:05:55] That king said was praying against his
[1:05:56] own law.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; What he has done, he was praying against
[1:06:00] it. That though when I said nothing can
[1:06:03] change it. But this one let him be
[1:06:05] changed.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Let something supernatural happen.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; The king was expecting something
[1:06:11] supernatural
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; because the laws of the metrop cannot be
[1:06:15] changed.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; But there is a God in heaven
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; that controls all things
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; that can change any law and any rule.
[1:06:23] Hallelujah.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; That can go beyond anything.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; No matter what declaration, no matter
[1:06:28] who said it,
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; oh hallelujah.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; So the key it said, Daniel, may your God
[1:06:35] deliver you.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said when they went away,
[1:06:40] he could not sleep.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; The king could not sleep.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; And Daniel was having a good time among
[1:06:46] the lions in the in the m
[1:06:53] That is the God we are serving.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; And do you know who is praying for you
[1:06:58] today?
[1:07:00] Do you know who is praying for you
[1:07:02] today?
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Somebody is praying for you.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Somebody somewhere that you don't know
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; is praying for you.
[1:07:15] The Bible says, "And the spirit prayeth
[1:07:17] on our behalf."
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; We've grown that cannot be understood
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; because that knows the mind of God. The
[1:07:24] mind of the spirit,
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; the mind of God and it interceds on your
[1:07:28] behalf. So somebody is praying for us.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus pray for us.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; He said, "Father, that you keep them."
[1:07:39] Hallelujah. And because Jesus prayed for
[1:07:42] us, nothing can touch us.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus said, "Father, I know you
[1:07:48] always hears me."
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, praise the Lord. So Jesus has
[1:07:56] prayed for you.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; He has prayed for us.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; And because he has prayed for us, we
[1:08:02] will make it.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; We will make it.
[1:08:06] Whether the devil like it or not,
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; we will make it.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Good like it would, it doesn't, that's
[1:08:13] not our business.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus pray for the church.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; And because he pray for us,
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; we will go through. He will see us
[1:08:23] through.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Somebody give a clap of him to Jesus.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:30] Hallelujah.
[1:08:32] Praise the Lord.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Woo. Hallelujah.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; He died. He gave us the Bible.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; That's why we have to read this Bible.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Read the Bible. He told Joshua, "Don't
[1:08:47] move from this one."
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; The word that Moses give to you, don't
[1:08:51] move from it.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; No matter whoever says anything against
[1:08:55] it, you leave those people.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Whoever criticize Moses, you leave it.
[1:09:02] Right?
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; You all that I want you to do is don't
[1:09:06] depart to the left or to the right.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Don't try to put any interpretation to
[1:09:11] it.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Just leave it the way it is.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; And I just love it. Read that Joshua
[1:09:18] chapter one and see how many times God
[1:09:20] was telling Joshua, be very courageous.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Be courageous.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Be of good courage.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be easy. You are going
[1:09:29] to have challenges. You are going to
[1:09:30] have to but be of good courage.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Be of good courage.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Read it.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Write that please. How many times God
[1:09:37] was telling Joshua, be courageous. Be of
[1:09:39] good courage. Be very courageous.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Church. May God help us
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; to be very courageous.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Don't just give up. Don't be afraid. Be
[1:09:48] courageous. There is no virtue in fear.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; No. Just be courageous. Cast down
[1:09:56] reasons.
[1:09:57] [Applause]
[1:09:59] Hallelujah.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; The Bible say when the king went away,
[1:10:04] he was fasting through the night. He was
[1:10:06] praying.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Save Daniel. God of Daniel, save Daniel.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; God of Daniel, save Daniel. Daniel is
[1:10:14] your faithful servant. Oh, they knew
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; that Daniel was a faithful servant.
[1:10:24] He he said, "Daniel, servant of the
[1:10:27] living God, the most high God,
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; may your God whom you faithfully serve,
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; may that God deliver you."
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; And the king as God answered the prayer
[1:10:41] of the king.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; The king that signed that decree and
[1:10:49] they know that the decrees cannot be
[1:10:51] changed. God answered his prayer.
[1:10:53] Listen, the Bible said early in the
[1:10:56] morning,
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; He went to the the the the the cave,
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; the king, he could not sleep
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; before anybody got up.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; He believed his prayers.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; He was expecting a miracle.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; He was expecting something to happen.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; And he went to the cave and he was with
[1:11:17] lame voice. down here. Servant of the
[1:11:20] living God,
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; servant of the most high God,
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; as your God
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; whom you have been faithfully serving,
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; has he been able to save you from the
[1:11:31] lions?
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Then he was
[1:11:39] shall God be able to say, "Oh, king
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; live forever."
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; King live forever.
[1:11:48] My God
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; sent his angels.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; My God sent his angel
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; and they shut the mouth of the lions.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, I am here with the lions. I am
[1:12:01] alive.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:12:05] God answered the prayer of the king.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; And the king was just Oh, hallelujah.
[1:12:13] Hallelujah. Because he heard the voice
[1:12:15] of Daniel. And then they said, "My God
[1:12:18] has done it.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; My God has done it." Oh king.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Take quickly. Take away the
[1:12:26] stone. Take away the blockage.
[1:12:27] Everything.
[1:12:29] Daniel, come out.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; When they thought he was defeated,
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; he came out triumphantly. Amen.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said when they think
[1:12:43] the message is defeated,
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; that's where the victory is coming.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; People think when they left the message,
[1:12:53] oh the message will collapse. Collapse
[1:12:55] what?
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Then everybody will leave the message.
[1:12:59] No,
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; you leave somebody coming.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Because you must just be a carer. That's
[1:13:06] right.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Carrying the seed.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Transporting the seed.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Nobody can stop. Nobody can quench that
[1:13:17] fire that God started. God lighted it.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; And oh my goodness.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; When we were young people believe this
[1:13:27] message and some of the parents said
[1:13:30] that your church the laws are too many.
[1:13:34] You don't wear hearing your women don't
[1:13:36] do this. It's too many laws. But listen,
[1:13:39] we were happy.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; What they were complaining about, we had
[1:13:44] not complain about that.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; And your the loss in your church is too.
[1:13:48] We have not asked you to come.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; We are enjoying our own law. We are
[1:13:52] enjoying our message. We are happy with
[1:13:55] our message. And you are sitting behind
[1:13:57] and they were complaining the law is too
[1:13:59] you have too many laws. What was it?
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Don't wear trouser. Don't paint your
[1:14:04] face. Don't do this. Because God says so
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; and they were feeling sad for us.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; We are happy.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; If you are here
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; and it is a force on you,
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; then you better go out
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; because it is a joy for us
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; to know the mind of God
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; that this is what God want us to do.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; This is the life he want us to live. It
[1:14:26] should not be difficult for you when the
[1:14:29] Holy Ghost comes and dwelt in you. It
[1:14:31] will not be difficult for you to pull
[1:14:32] down your trouser or your pants as a
[1:14:35] woman.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Now sometime I look at I said sometime I
[1:14:38] see sisters with cute all this makeup
[1:14:41] and they try to do it light and I said
[1:14:43] listen do it well. Put red on. Don't
[1:14:47] just put white paint here so that people
[1:14:49] will not see it. Put red so that we see
[1:14:52] and know how to pray for you.
[1:14:57] Because who do you want to hide it from?
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Do you want to hide it from me?
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Look at up.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Look up.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; We are loose. Amen.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Church, we are loose. The blood lose us.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. We are no more in
[1:15:22] bondage.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Christ set us free.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:26] loose.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Free from superstitions.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Free from fear.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. For me to live is Christ
[1:15:41] and to die is gain.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Free
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; from worry
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; because there is no virtue in worrying.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no, no. Why do I worry?
[1:15:52] Oh Jesus. Brother Brown said, "If I even
[1:15:55] know I'm going to die tomorrow, the next
[1:15:56] hour, I said, I'm not going to worry
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; because it will not do any good for me."
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Did the prophet say so?
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "But I will have faith."
[1:16:06] Because faith can sign my pardon.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Listen, it is not what you think is
[1:16:14] right
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; or what you feel is right.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; It is what God says is right.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; That is what is right. Right.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; So the mind of God came to the prophet.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; So the word have come to straighten us,
[1:16:29] to straighten our thoughts,
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; to straighten our thinking,
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; To correct our minds.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Do you get that?
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Like um
[1:16:41] I talk about anas that came to pray for
[1:16:44] Paul, Saul at that time. And then uh
[1:16:47] when the Lord spoke to Ana said there is
[1:16:49] a man here called Saul he's in this
[1:16:52] house here and there he's praying go and
[1:16:56] pray for him go to and then I said Lord
[1:16:58] please I have heard many things about
[1:17:01] that man
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; see that man has been persecuting the
[1:17:04] church that man has been doing this and
[1:17:06] that God said
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; that man is a choosing vessel
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; whatever he has done whatever he has
[1:17:16] been doing that man is a choosing
[1:17:18] vessel. Go and pray for him.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; And and what I love about it is when
[1:17:23] Anas got to where Saul was, you know
[1:17:25] what he did? You know how he he
[1:17:27] addressed he said, "Brother Saul,
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; sir,
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; he said, "Brother Saul,
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; why?" The word corrected him.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; The word corrects error. Amen.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; So whatever you think today,
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; whatever anybody says today, we don't
[1:17:48] take it or we take what the prophet said
[1:17:49] on it.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Because the message has come to correct
[1:17:54] us.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; To straighten us
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; to teach us what is right that this is
[1:18:00] the right way of God. This is what God
[1:18:03] has approved. That is why when we went
[1:18:06] into forc baptisms and false teachings
[1:18:08] in the prophet came those in the word we
[1:18:10] were blinded to it
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; were bound by denominations
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; some people are still bound today
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; they are not free they become slaves to
[1:18:20] the church
[1:18:22] they they cannot express themselves
[1:18:25] but then God sent a prophet
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; and he came to us and he straightened us
[1:18:31] that listen God is no three father Holy
[1:18:34] Ghost doesn't make three gods.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; It takes a person, a personality, not
[1:18:38] three persons. One person
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; who manifested himself in this
[1:18:43] fatherhood dispensation, a sunship and
[1:18:46] the Holy Ghost is one God.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Father is not a name.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Son is not a name. Holy Ghost is not a
[1:18:52] name. The name is Jesus.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Because when Jesus was on earth, he was
[1:18:59] preaching. and said listen I came in my
[1:19:02] father's name
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; if he came in his father's name and he's
[1:19:07] called Jesus that is the name of the
[1:19:09] father
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; so the word come to straighten our
[1:19:15] thoughts
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; the word comes to correct us
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; may God give grace as the word comes we
[1:19:22] drop our ideas
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; we drop our thinkings we drop our
[1:19:26] feelings
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; and take Gossip.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Listen, that's what has been all
[1:19:32] throughout the scriptures. When the
[1:19:34] angel met Mary and the angel spoke to
[1:19:37] her and told her what can what was going
[1:19:39] to happen. He said, "How can this be?"
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; This has never happened before. I've
[1:19:44] never read it anywhere before.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; And the angel said, "The Holy Ghost will
[1:19:47] come upon you."
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; The power of the shall come upon you and
[1:19:51] therefore that only thing which shall be
[1:19:53] shall come out of your womb shall be
[1:19:55] called the son of God.
[1:19:58] Mary said, "Be it unto me
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; according to your word."
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; So the word strengthen her.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; May the word straighten us.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; May the word position us
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; because that's what the word is saying
[1:20:13] to position us,
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; to strengthen us, to make us know who we
[1:20:19] are.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; So good.
[1:20:25] Do you remember in that
[1:20:28] when God made the first woman, she
[1:20:30] didn't know who she was,
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; She didn't even know her name. She had
[1:20:35] no she didn't know anything. When Adam
[1:20:37] say woman, he didn't call her. It's hey
[1:20:41] another creature in the garden. He has
[1:20:43] seen all other where is from this one.
[1:20:46] Adam might have said who are you? She
[1:20:48] said I don't know. Where do you come
[1:20:51] from? I don't know. What's your name? I
[1:20:53] don't know. And Adam look at there by
[1:20:57] the spirit of revelation.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Because Adam was asleep.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; He was asleep. He didn't know where that
[1:21:05] woman came from.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; God did the first surgical operation.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; He did surgery in the garden.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; So when they talk about surgery, don't
[1:21:15] be afraid. God did it first.
[1:21:18] [Applause]
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; So good. So that we hear about no don't
[1:21:24] be afraid
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; until God has finished with us.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Nothing can take us out of here.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Listen, this is the mind of God. This is
[1:21:37] not the mind of William Brham.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; This is the mind of this is the word of
[1:21:41] God to us.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; And the word is here to straighten us.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; To set us free from superstitions.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. From the ideas of men,
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; from your own reasons,
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; from the way we have been brought up,
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; what we have been taught to be right,
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; God's welcome to tell her this is right.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; What your parent taught you, what the
[1:22:04] church taught you, what this one taught
[1:22:06] you, what denomination taught you, this
[1:22:09] is what God says. God's word, the
[1:22:12] correct interpretation comes to a
[1:22:15] prophet.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes sir.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; We are going.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Nothing will stop us.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; No power can stop us.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; We are on our way to glory land.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; We are on our way to the promised land.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Woman, you are loose.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. I'm so glad that
[1:22:46] that woman went to church that day.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Like this
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; maybe with a stick
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; and Jesus saw her
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; maybe. Look at her faithfulness that in
[1:23:07] this condition
[1:23:09] she was able to come to church.
[1:23:12] And Jesus looked and said, "Come,
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; come, sister, come,
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; lady." He spoke the word.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; When he saw her, he said, "Woman,
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; you are loosed."
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Bam. Hallelujah.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Woo. And she just straighten up. Think
[1:23:36] about it.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; She's She got her. She's straightening
[1:23:40] up. The power of the spoken word.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Remember, it's the same yesterday,
[1:23:48] today, and forever.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Remember, as you are hearing the word of
[1:23:51] the Lord, demons are being casted.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Hummon spirit are casted out.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; All powers of darkness is broken down.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Sin is cast out.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Satan is losing the battle. We are on
[1:24:03] the winning side.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Church, you are lose.
[1:24:11] Hallelujah.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; I will not take much of your time, but
[1:24:14] I'm feeling very good.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know the prophet spoke about
[1:24:23] Johnny crow, little crow that was caught
[1:24:26] by a farmer
[1:24:29] and the farmer died
[1:24:33] and the crow just hoping around.
[1:24:39] Yes. And so he says one good man, some
[1:24:42] good man, good fellow come and he says,
[1:24:44] "Sir, please let this crow go. You don't
[1:24:47] blame me because he's a crow. That's the
[1:24:50] only way it can eat, survive is to pick
[1:24:52] from your farm. So let it go." So that
[1:24:56] good man spoke on behalf of the crow and
[1:24:59] it's okay. He set the crow free. He cut
[1:25:02] it caught the line. He caught the
[1:25:04] string. And the other best came out. He
[1:25:07] say is coming let's go.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; No I cannot.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; He say you are loose and no I cannot go.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; That good man Jesus
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; on Calvary.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; He cut the line broken.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; He cut the line loose.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; We were bound in sin. We were bound with
[1:25:32] all kinds of habit. All kinds of
[1:25:34] diseases. All kinds of worries, all
[1:25:37] kinds of old things. And then Jesus on
[1:25:39] Calvary.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Caught that link. Caught the rope.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; We that once were slave. We were once
[1:25:48] under the devil once being ruled by the
[1:25:50] power of the prince of the power of the
[1:25:52] air that we could not help ourselves. We
[1:25:55] were slaves and he was driving ush. And
[1:25:58] he was driving ush. And he was driving
[1:26:01] us.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. That good man, the Lord Jesus that
[1:26:06] day on Calvary C the line, broke the
[1:26:10] line.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; He said you are free.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; You are free.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; No, you are free.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord Jesus.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Unto him that love us
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; and wash us from our sins. unto him be
[1:26:31] the glory.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; The prophet speaking here, Jesus Christ,
[1:26:35] who is the faithful witness, the first
[1:26:37] begotten of the dead.
[1:26:40] He said, now unto him that love us and
[1:26:43] wash us from our sins in his own blood.
[1:26:48] The word wash there actually in the
[1:26:51] Greek means to lose.
[1:26:55] He lost from our
[1:26:59] We were tied
[1:27:02] to the earth by our sin.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; We couldn't see. We couldn't hear. Had
[1:27:09] no conception of heaven or nothing.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; We had no conception of heaven or
[1:27:16] nothing.
[1:27:21] But when the blood came down, it cut the
[1:27:25] line
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; and we got loose.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; When the blood came down, it cut the
[1:27:33] line
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; and we were loose.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Hey, we are no more exposed to sale.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; We are out of the pound shop.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; He paid the price.
[1:27:49] to get us out of that place.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; We are lose.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; I don't care. You think I'm crazy.
[1:27:59] That's okay. I don't care about what you
[1:28:00] think.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; He caught a lie and we got loose.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; And the prophet bring a farmer caught a
[1:28:09] crow and tied him. And he said, "I will
[1:28:13] teach the other crows a lesson." So he
[1:28:15] tied the crow, the old crow and by a leg
[1:28:19] with a string, a string and um and the
[1:28:23] poor old thing like star to death. He
[1:28:27] was so weak he could hardly walk around.
[1:28:31] That's what some of these organizations
[1:28:34] and churches
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; has tied the people down.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Oh just can't. Well, this is all the
[1:28:44] further you can go. Days of miracle is
[1:28:47] passed.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you are just tired. That's all.
[1:28:52] There is no such a thing as the Holy
[1:28:54] Ghost. And he don't speak in tonges like
[1:28:57] he used to.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; He is God. He's just the same yesterday,
[1:29:03] today, and forever.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Listen church. Yes sir.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Don't just sit down here and think well
[1:29:10] the days of William is gone. This is the
[1:29:12] days of the bride.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Jesus is here.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; The same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; So it was not William Brown that did it.
[1:29:25] It was the Holy Ghost that did it.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost is here.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; If the Holy Ghost can get a surrounded
[1:29:31] vessel
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; that we believe in,
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; that will trust in the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:37] That's why it is the book of the Holy
[1:29:39] Ghost. The art of the Holy Ghost in the
[1:29:41] apostles.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; The book of us. Brother Bran said it is
[1:29:45] the art of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; in the apostles.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost is still as many as
[1:29:52] the Lord our God shall call.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; If God is calling, God is healing, God
[1:29:56] is doing the same thing.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:30:09] forever.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, church. He's the same.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; So don't come to a place to say, well, I
[1:30:15] will die in this condition. Me, I will
[1:30:16] not die in that condition.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; So if the devil tell you, yeah, this No,
[1:30:21] no, no, no. Hallelujah. God can change
[1:30:23] any condition.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; God can do anything.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Hey, hey, don't limit Jehovah.
[1:30:32] Hey, the book of Psalms 78 is the
[1:30:35] children of Israel, they limited the
[1:30:37] most high God.
[1:30:39] They said, "He gave us this. He gave us
[1:30:42] this. He He gave us this. Can he also do
[1:30:44] this?"
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Okay, you open the Red Sea. Can he give
[1:30:49] us water? We We want water. Can he give
[1:30:51] us fresh? The children of Israel.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; And they limited the most high God.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Don't limit Jehovah. Right.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the same. The Bible say he's
[1:31:02] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; And the Bible say I am God
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; and I change not.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Woo. Glory to God. Hey, you
[1:31:14] are loose already.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Church, you are loose.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Woman is a type of the church. Say,
[1:31:19] woman, you are loose.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Church, you are loose.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; We are loose to believe Jesus Christ is
[1:31:25] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:31:28] We are loose to believe that he's the
[1:31:29] same yesterday. We are loosed to believe
[1:31:31] that he's here. He said, "Where two or
[1:31:33] three are gathered in my name, I'll be
[1:31:35] dead." We are loose.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:31:49] It's just the same yesterday, today, and
[1:31:50] forever.
[1:31:52] living in all the churches. We'll get to
[1:31:55] it after the setting of this in the
[1:31:58] morning. He said God is uh he God is God
[1:32:02] that lives in every church age. He will
[1:32:05] live in every church age and will live
[1:32:08] in his people for eternity.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; God is living now in his people.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; He's not in his people.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; He's choosing people. is still
[1:32:23] why why you are you looking at me like
[1:32:25] that when you have the Holy Ghost
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; you know what it is that's God
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; that's God in you
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen
[1:32:38] that's the word oh
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; that's what the message has come to
[1:32:42] teach us
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost is not another being
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; it's not a second person or third person
[1:32:48] it is God himself Amen.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; He said Jesus when he was here, he had
[1:32:58] the spirit without
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; measure.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; The fullness of the godhead bodily was
[1:33:06] in Christ.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; But each and every one of us has a
[1:33:10] portion of it.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; And what did the prophet said? If you
[1:33:14] take
[1:33:16] where if you are there where they were
[1:33:17] making this water or little part of the
[1:33:19] ocean and you take it just
[1:33:23] this full of this ocean take the ocean
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; that this quality that you have quantity
[1:33:30] you have here
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; has every potential
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; has every quality
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; everything that is in the big ocean is
[1:33:38] here or I take this small water here
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; right
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; what is here is the same quality
[1:33:43] quality.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; It's the same quality.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; It is only
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; this is a little measure. This is little
[1:33:52] this full
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; but it's the same quality.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; So when we have the Holy Ghost, it is
[1:33:58] the same quality
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; that they had on the day of Pentecost
[1:34:03] that was in Christ is divided into the
[1:34:06] church today.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; So remember this.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother said, "Dity is in you."
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Are you trying to reason? Drop your
[1:34:22] reason.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Don't question the word.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; The word says so.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; And that is for us to know who we are.
[1:34:31] It is to position us.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; To stop our forget about your
[1:34:36] superstitions,
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:34:40] Cast down your reasons
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; and let us take what the word says
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; because we are the word made flesh
[1:34:49] today.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Hey, you must accept yeah what is this
[1:34:57] said? A pardon is not a pardon
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; until it is accepted.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; So if you don't accept it, you still
[1:35:06] live in bondage.
[1:35:09] When he loses, we be lose.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; You have to accept it that he lose me.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; You walk into it.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; He said now the cross scram they try to
[1:35:28] call, hey brother, you are loose. Let's
[1:35:29] go. Just like we are trying to do today.
[1:35:31] You are loose church. You are loose
[1:35:32] brother. Nah.
[1:35:35] Huh? You will stay in that condition.
[1:35:38] until you accept what God has done.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; And
[1:35:48] this good man, he took his knife and cut
[1:35:51] the crow loose. And you know, here come
[1:35:55] the other crows come over and said,
[1:35:58] "Come on, Johnny Crow. Let's go, S. Cold
[1:36:02] weather is coming."
[1:36:04] You know what? The crow will just go as
[1:36:07] far as he could go out there. Said, "I
[1:36:11] can't do it. It's not It's just not for
[1:36:15] us this day.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; We just can't do it. We can do it.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; We can do it.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; I can do all things through God that
[1:36:26] strengthens me." We can do it.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; It's not by our might. It's not by our
[1:36:30] power. It is by the Holy Ghost. What is
[1:36:33] the commission? We got a commission.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; The church got a commission. Go in my
[1:36:39] name.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Castle devils in my name.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Pray for the sick in my name. Whatever
[1:36:44] you bind on the earth, I bind it in
[1:36:46] heaven.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Whatever you lose on the earth, I lose
[1:36:50] it in heaven.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; So he gave the commission to the church.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:03] You are just looking at yourself. Me?
[1:37:05] Yes,
[1:37:07] brother. Tell you talk about a little
[1:37:08] policeman.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; No matter who that can be a drunker, can
[1:37:13] be this and that that that. But when he
[1:37:15] join that force and he wears that
[1:37:17] uniform,
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; everything changes.
[1:37:24] the people that look at him and dispatch
[1:37:26] him. When they see that uniform,
[1:37:28] you are driving on the road and you see
[1:37:30] the police car, your driving change, you
[1:37:33] check your speedometer, you apply your
[1:37:37] brakes because there's a policeman
[1:37:40] sometime is right behind you
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; and you become a gentle driver
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; because policeman is behind you
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; and you are careful not to go against
[1:37:52] the law.
[1:37:55] In fact, you reduce to go below
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; because policeman is there.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; So that they will be laughing at us.
[1:38:09] They know what we are doing.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; They know how we drive.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; So when you slow down, you become so
[1:38:18] gentle. They'll be laughing.
[1:38:22] Listen,
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; when the devil sees you,
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; he knows who
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; but sometime we don't know who we are.
[1:38:37] We forget who we are.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Church, may God help us.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; When God give you commission, he gave us
[1:38:46] commission.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Is waiting on the church.
[1:38:51] is waiting on us to accept it.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:39:03] He had been tied so long until he
[1:39:06] thought he was still tied.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; And that's the way with a lot of people.
[1:39:12] You are tied down with crits and
[1:39:15] denominations from old mother prostitute
[1:39:18] back there. there telling you Jesus
[1:39:21] Christ isn't the same and there is no
[1:39:24] such a thing as healing. There is no
[1:39:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost. There is none
[1:39:28] of this stuff like that. Trying to tell
[1:39:31] them
[1:39:33] you've been tied so long till you still
[1:39:36] think you are tied.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; The good man Christ gave his blood that
[1:39:43] he might wash us and lose us from our
[1:39:47] sin. What is sin? I will ask anybody to
[1:39:51] tell me what is sin is unbelief.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Unbelief. That's what is killing us.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Unbelief is killing us
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; or we say we believe. Unbelief is
[1:40:08] killing us
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; because we are reasoning with God's
[1:40:11] word.
[1:40:15] And that is the only sin there is is
[1:40:17] unbelief.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Because instead of us to look at him, we
[1:40:21] are looking at ourselves.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:40:28] Listen, the prophet said in the Old
[1:40:31] Testament,
[1:40:32] you know, the first bones belongs to
[1:40:34] God,
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; he said, so if they give birth to a
[1:40:37] donkey and they squeeze like this, like
[1:40:39] this, he said, and they have to kill it,
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; start knock it, he said the woman will
[1:40:45] say, don't worry, you are donkey, you
[1:40:47] are not good, but something good is
[1:40:49] standing for you. An innocent, blameless
[1:40:53] lamb.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; He said, listen, yes, I'm not good. You
[1:40:57] are not good. But look at the sacrifice.
[1:40:59] This sacrifice is coming in your place.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Because God made that provision.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; It's not by works of righteousness that
[1:41:09] we are done.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; It's by his grace. So brother Brown said
[1:41:12] don't look at yourself.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Look at your sacrifice.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; on my behalf. On our behalf. We are
[1:41:23] free.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; We are loose. We are delivered because
[1:41:28] Jesus shed the blood to lose you today
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; as a son of God. As a daughter of God,
[1:41:34] you are loose.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; From superstitions and evil forces.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. He said now he has
[1:41:50] washed us and lose us from our
[1:41:52] denomination in his own in his own blood
[1:41:56] and has made us free so we can think for
[1:42:00] ourself.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; And talk for ourself
[1:42:08] and act for ourself.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Hey, the blind boy that was made blind,
[1:42:14] Jesus opened his eyes. He was born
[1:42:16] blind.
[1:42:18] And the Pharisees put fear in everybody,
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; And they called the mother, the parents,
[1:42:23] is that your son? Yes, please. Yes,
[1:42:25] pastor.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; How come that is saying?
[1:42:30] We don't know.
[1:42:33] He said because the Pharisees have won.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Anybody that confess Jesus will be
[1:42:37] casted out.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Your name will be cancelled from the
[1:42:41] church.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; And they love the church. He said of the
[1:42:45] word of the Lord. Oh. And then they came
[1:42:48] back to the blind boy who was blind and
[1:42:50] now his eyes was open.
[1:42:53] Were you born blind? Yes sir.
[1:42:55] How come that you are seeing? It's a man
[1:42:57] called Jesus.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Made clear. Put it on my eyes and now I
[1:43:01] can see. Oh, give glory to God. That man
[1:43:04] is a sinner. I don't care about that.
[1:43:06] All that I know is that once I was
[1:43:08] blind,
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; but now I can see.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Why? He was loose.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; He was free
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; to speak for himself
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; to stand for himself. To testify of the
[1:43:21] goodness of the Lord.
[1:43:26] post stood before a gripper. He said,
[1:43:28] "I'm glad that I will speak for myself."
[1:43:30] He was loose.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; When God does something for you, when
[1:43:37] God loses you, you don't care about
[1:43:39] nobody.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; You will testify.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; You will worship him. You will sing.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; You will clap. Oh, some of us, we come
[1:43:48] to church, even you can't say amen.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:43:53] You can say amen.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Oh God have mercy. And the word comes to
[1:43:58] you can you cannot rejoice. Oh there is
[1:44:01] something about the word. David said
[1:44:02] restore to me the joy of my salvation.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; There is joy of salvation.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; There is joy. There is joy. Hallelujah.
[1:44:12] Glory to God.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. When you see me jump I got to
[1:44:20] jump. Because sometime I told you I
[1:44:23] could not even lift my leg feet up like
[1:44:25] this. I could not I could not move from
[1:44:27] here to there. They have to carry me and
[1:44:30] when the son has loose me. Hallelujah.
[1:44:34] When he has set me free.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; I don't care about anybody here.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; I am free.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Free to worship.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Free to testify. Free to glorify him.
[1:44:49] Hallelujah.
[1:44:51] Amen.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Woo. Okay. Okay. Let's try and get this
[1:44:54] one and get out of here.
[1:44:59] Woo.
[1:45:01] Revelation 15. Unto him that love us and
[1:45:04] wash us from our sins in his own blood.
[1:45:06] The word wash is actually loosed.
[1:45:12] Lose us from our sins in his own blood.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Okay. The prophet said, "Isn't that
[1:45:20] wonderful?"
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; But are you spiritual minded?
[1:45:26] Did you catch it? It was his own blood
[1:45:29] that lose us
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; completely.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; He said what? Completely.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; We are loose completely
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; by the blood.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; We are no man the bondage of sin and
[1:45:46] death.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are loose completely.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; I am loose completely.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; And the true believer is loosed
[1:45:53] completely.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; If you're a true believer, the blood
[1:45:57] loses you completely.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; From our sins, listen, it was not human
[1:46:05] blood. It was the blood of God.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Peter called it the blood of Christ.
[1:46:12] Paul called it the blood of the Lord and
[1:46:14] the blood of Jesus. Not three persons
[1:46:17] but one person. There is that revelation
[1:46:21] again. One God.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; That omnipotent Jehovah God came down
[1:46:27] and made itself a body by the midst of
[1:46:30] the virgin birth and end it
[1:46:34] that it might be the blood of God that
[1:46:38] lose us
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; that will lose us. Lose us entirely.
[1:46:45] out lose us entirely.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; This is good for me.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. From our sins and presented
[1:46:56] scatterless
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; before himself with exceedingly
[1:47:01] great joy.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Will you like an Old Testament type? Let
[1:47:07] us go back to the Garden of Eden. When
[1:47:09] the first news came to glory that the
[1:47:13] son Adam had fallen lost has been lost.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Did God send an angel? Did he send a
[1:47:20] son? Did he send another one like unto
[1:47:23] us? No. He came himself
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; to redeem that lost son. Hallelujah.
[1:47:32] God did not entrust
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; his plan of salvation to another.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; He trusted only himself.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; God was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; And redeem us unto himself.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; We are saved by the blood of God.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; The eternal God indwelt a mortal body in
[1:47:59] order to take away sin.
[1:48:01] He became the lamb in order to shed his
[1:48:05] blood
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; and enter into the veil with it.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Consider this.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Consider this."
[1:48:22] Hallelujah.
[1:48:25] Consider this.
[1:48:28] Since it is the blood of God, it is
[1:48:31] perfect blood.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; And if the perfect blood is loosening us
[1:48:39] from the power and bondage and
[1:48:41] definement of sin, then the loosening is
[1:48:44] perfect and complete.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; The looseness is perfect and complete.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord help us.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; There is not therefore no condemnation.
[1:49:02] Who shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:49:04] God's elect?
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; It is God that justifies.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Declares righteous. Who is he that
[1:49:12] condemnth? It is Christ that died.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Romans 3, Romans 8:33,34.
[1:49:19] There is now. There it is. is death gave
[1:49:23] us the blood. The blood has loosed us.
[1:49:27] There is now no condemnation. How can
[1:49:31] there be? There is nothing to be
[1:49:33] condemned for
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; because the blood
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; has loosed us
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; from sin.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; We are free.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; We are guiltless.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Don't listen to man. Listen to the word.
[1:49:47] You are loose by the blood.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Now don't get tied down again by
[1:49:53] traditions and grace and organizations.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Don't be led astray by listening to
[1:50:00] those that deny the power of the word
[1:50:02] and deny that Jesus saves, heals, and
[1:50:05] fills with the Holy Ghost and power. You
[1:50:08] are God's free man.
[1:50:11] [Applause]
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Lose by his own blood.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's free man
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; loose by his own blood.

[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; You are loose from fear. You are loose
[1:50:28] from superstition. You are loose from
[1:50:30] the things of the world. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:50:32] The word came to lose us.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. What about that ego
[1:50:40] that was there

[1:51:18] done again. The English said, "No,

[1:51:25] today, and forever. He still heals. He
[1:51:28] saves. He says, he baptizes. He gives

[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; If the spirit of him that raised Christ
[1:51:56] from the dead dwells in you.

[1:55:13] know, it's with everything about it, no
[1:55:15] matter what comes. Amen. We can always
[1:55:17] take it right back and say, I'm not I
[1:55:19] don't have to be subservient to
[1:55:21] anything.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; I don't have to I don't have to be
[1:55:24] subservient to a complex. I don't have
[1:55:26] to be subservient to a grudge. I don't
[1:55:28] have to be subservient to, you know,
[1:55:30] we're sons of God.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; And it's deeper than anything that has
[1:55:35] ever taken place or happened. The son of
[1:55:37] God, that was before there was anything
[1:55:40] that took place. And that's what the
[1:55:42] Holy Spirit came to loosen. Aren't you
[1:55:43] grateful?

[1:55:47] for his mercy.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's let's let's press on. Don't

[1:55:57] drowning man out and the man who's

[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; I I'm glad that the Holy Spirit works in
[1:56:03] our lives to loosen us from
[1:56:06] superstitions.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad?
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Superstition sometimes things has
[1:56:11] been taught. Sometimes it's things that
[1:56:12] we've believed. Sometimes those things
[1:56:14] is still carried on. But God in his
[1:56:16] grace loosens us and we recognize those
[1:56:19] very things. Ah, there was superstition.
[1:56:20] This was actually what I thought was
[1:56:22] liberty was actually bondage
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; because I had to do this. I had to do
[1:56:26] that. I had to do this. But God loosens
[1:56:28] us from superstition because why?
[1:56:30] There's a man here that has turned on
[1:56:32] the light.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. It shows up what what is truth and
[1:56:36] what's true reality. Amen. And amen.
[1:56:38] We've been bought out of the market
[1:56:40] never to be exposed to sell again.
[1:56:45] Amen. Never to be exposed to sell again.
[1:56:48] Aren't you grateful?
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And amen. And amen.
[1:56:51] Hallelujah. Let's stand and my goodness.
[1:56:54] You got a song? Okay. I figured one came
[1:56:58] to you.
[1:57:01] Amen. Let's just stand and worship the
[1:57:03] Lord.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; For a long time. I traveled
[1:57:12] down a long lonely road.
[1:57:16] My heart was so heavy. I sang.
[1:57:23] Then I heard about Jesus.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a wonderful hour.
[1:57:31] [Music]
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that I found out he could
[1:57:36] bring me out his saving power.
[1:57:40] Oh, thank God I am free. Free. Free from
[1:57:46] this world of sin.
[1:57:50] I've been washed in the blood of Jesus.
[1:57:54] I've been born again.
[1:57:58] Oh, hallelujah. I'm saved. Saved. Saved
[1:58:03] by his wonderful grace.
