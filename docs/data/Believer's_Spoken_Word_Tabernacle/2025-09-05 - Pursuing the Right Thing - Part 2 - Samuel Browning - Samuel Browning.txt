Amen. To him. And Amen. And that's truly what's going to stand there on the other side is perfect love. Amen. And that's the the great achievement of the Holy Spirit, the love of God in our lives. Amen. And to think of it in its we're living in a time and an age where well people just can't put up with people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You you know how it is. You can't even you have to be careful when you pull up to a stoplight. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You got to be careful even you look at someone. It's true. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We're living in a time and an age. But it's not it's not the people. It's spirits. &gt;&gt; All of those spirits have been able been released, been able to come in. And if not for God's grace, &gt;&gt; if not for the grace of God, &gt;&gt; we would be caught &gt;&gt; in the same thing. &gt;&gt; But God in his rich in mercy &gt;&gt; has delivered us from this present darkness. &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, thank God for his mercy. Amen. And not only to deliver us to live victorious here and now, but to know that we're being prepared. We're being molded and shaped. &gt;&gt; And when all that testing is over here in this earth, this life, we go, we leave the rapture. Amen. Or by the way of the grave, whatever. But I know one thing. We certainly have a promise. We have a body that is waiting reserved in the heavens. And when this place right here gets to that that molded place that matches that theophony which we've been connected to and is pulling on us, when all of that gets met just right, then the rapture goes. You know, God has never taken one flower too early. Sometimes in our way of thinking about things, sometimes we look at things and think this individual was only 50 or 20 or 18 or 30. Yeah. Could have been a lot of life. But you know, God has never taken one flower too early. The prophet taught us that that until our purpose is served, &gt;&gt; we're to be here. &gt;&gt; You know, I remember my I remember my mama Browning when she she was over here in this one of the nursing homes there in North North Ridgeville. And when you found when others looked read her obituary and they read here she was for over 10 years in a nursing home and that's I guess that's kind of uncommon that someone would be in there that long. And you know, you look at the last few years of her life, she couldn't talk. She couldn't move herself. And you you could think, Lord, what's the purpose? But then when you hear the testimony of others that would come in that room, though she may not have been able to move these lips because of Parkinson's, but she knew how to talk to him. &gt;&gt; And the testimony was is there would be such a presence in that room &gt;&gt; when others would walk in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we may not understand everything, but God knows. God has never made a mistake. &gt;&gt; And let me say this to you. He never made a mistake with calling you. &gt;&gt; He never made a mistake with touching your life. &gt;&gt; God don't make mistakes. &gt;&gt; God don't make coincidences. It's not happen stance. God is purposeful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In all that he does. And I believe if God could hear my mama's prayer where she could not even move that so riddled her body but God could hear the heart, &gt;&gt; how much more has God not heard your heart, &gt;&gt; my heart. &gt;&gt; You believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; Let's just go to him in prayer. Father, how we want to say thank you once again for your mercies, Lord. many things, Lord, that we we don't understand. But how wonderful it is, Lord, to be able to trust you. I would rather have that, Lord, to reach out and to trust you than to understand everything. Like the song says, we'll understand it better by and by. But to trust you, Lord, oh my, that's something that's deeper than what our intellect could go. That's more than what our knowledge or our comprehension. But oh God, how that Lord Jesus, you give us the grace that's needed. And really Lord, it's not our trust as far as something that we have some great quality, but Lord, it's what you have deposited in our lives by way of the Holy Ghost. And through that, Lord, of that divine love, it reaches back to you in trust. And we trust you, Lord. Now, Father, there's requests that have been offered up. There's needs that's here tonight. And I pray that, Lord, that if you see that there is something, Lord, beyond what I've looked at, listen to Lord, and read, then always, Lord, I'm yours. I just want to be a faithful servant, Lord. May you come by once again and minister to our needs. That's what we want to that's what we want, Lord, is you would speak to our needs. We just commit ourselves to you now, Lord. Ask that you would forgive us, Lord, of our sins and our shortcomings. And may your grace just continue to ride in upon us, Lord, wave after wave after wave. We pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Let's look here in the scripture this this evening. John 13. Amen. Thank you musicians and song leaders. Want to continue to keep different different ones in prayer. I know brother Roco was just being released yesterday and um he's just needs to get stronger in his body and you know how that sickness will take it out of you. Many of us have already been through that and I got a text from brother Danny Lewis here earlier this afternoon and he wasn't feeling well either. So let's just remember different ones in prayer. I I know you are but um let's just remember them in prayer. God will just give him strength. In John 13 and verse 34, Jesus said, "A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another as I have loved you, that ye also love one another." Now notice, as I have loved you. Now remember when he talked with Peter, Peter Peter expressed that he loved him. But Peter could only express according to the love that he knew. It's only the only depth that he knew. I I feel thee. But here the Lord Jesus is writing of a new commandment now is to be restored. What they lost in Eden. Remember the prophet tells us they had a perfect understanding of the love of God. And so now this to be mentioned in this time, there's no doubt that the disciples and those as they were standing there hearing this, there's no doubt that they would have no idea of the meaning within this as far as to the degree that this would move and be made manifest through their life. Have no idea what it would take. But yet, as he spoke to them, that ye love one another as in the same degree as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. And by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if you have love one to another. Now, isn't it amazing? He never said that we'd be known by a doctrine. Even to be known by a picture &gt;&gt; but by this by this you'll be known as my disciples. This will be the distinguishing factor. Now we know many many people can attain to that element of love felio love within and it can be it can be very very wholesome. But in order for this of agape love, this has to be a divine sovereign work of the Holy Spirit himself making a deposit in our life. It can be no other way than God himself through you and I loving him and loving one another as he. I tell you, you talking about a supernatural work. Now granted friends, if God needed you or me to walk on the water, there was a need within that or how whatever the need is, then we want God to move according to that need. But one of the greatest achievements and what will come within the rapture, what will be taken is this perfecting of the love of God in the body of Jesus Christ. Amen. May God bless you and bless the reading of the word. As you're being seated, I'd like to continue to speak to you this this evening on pursuing the right thing. And when we look at this as we were kind of coming to a close last week, we see there's where there's a great difference between that of like and where love comes in. Because when Jesus would say to love one another to agopy them, it's not that we like maybe even someone's temperament or personality, but the love of God will look beyond that. But Jesus when he when giving this and these things being spoken to know that there would be differences that would remain about us in our personality and in our temperament and our makeup and all of the things of where we have come through in life. But yet the love of God would be able to look beyond that. So it never gave us any sort of a license to say well I will withdraw from this person because I don't like them per se as far as their personality, their temperament and we all are different. We have similarities yet we have differences. And if God wanted us all to be the same as far as our temperaments, our personalities, all of that, then God would have seen fit and would have changed that part about you and I. But God left that measure and that part within us, the temperament, the personality. And the prophet says the Holy Spirit comes and sets down right in the middle of your temperament, your personality. How the disciples were so different one from another. Brother Brham would take the message things that are to be and take about 15 minutes and deal with those differences of how that you could not judge Andrew by Peter or judge Peter by John. You you cannot. And this is why that we we don't judge or should not judge one another or judge ourselves by one another. Truly, we're fruit inspectors. But I want to just say this right now that some things that you might see or the lack of, it can change very quickly. Fruit itself can change very quickly. Fruit comes on and it goes through a whole process. So we always want to just commit everything into the hands of God. But I want to just say it like this that when we see it that the love of God with God's love there's no hatred. There's no detesting of that individual. You may not like their personality. They may like may may not like yours. But within it the love of God triumphs and is greater than those differences. And that's the power of the love of God in our lives. That's the motivating factor by which we strive for the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. Did you ever catch how Paul would write that where he would say strive for unity. If unity was just something that was just a given if it was just something that you know well you don't have to work at it. Paul would have never wrote endeavor. He would have never wrote strive. he would have never wrote. In every one of Paul's epistles, you find the appeal for unity as well as God giving direction and instruction. You say, "Well, why would that be?" Because the Holy Spirit cannot work into the full capacity that he desires to work to fulfill his word if there's disunityity. So, the Holy Spirit works within his word. And and you know, sometimes Satan would like to take a hold of of of things within this measure and make it as though that it's somehow elementary, but yet you find the prophet dealing with this all the time. Even in the opening of the message of Christ, the mystery of God revealed where the prophet would liken that to be that seventh seal message. And he would take almost 45 to 50 minutes and deal with these aspects in the beginning of that message and talk about how Satan will try to get among you, try to bring bitterness in, try to cause you to think differently against a person. Just understand that these are ways that Satan works to try to hinder the outworking of the Holy Spirit in our life. It's just like this that if you know you can be going down a road, we were um on vacation and there was a um some time ago and you know we were we were caught out in the midst of a storm and man I mean it was a storm that was coming through. Actually there were different tornadoes that were hitting down around in here in June and other places like that and we were right out there in the midst of it having to drive around trees that were falling on the road and I mean things were actually falling as we were driving. Now what happened is is there actually became roads that was at moments earlier passable and they became impassable. Somebody had to come along the way and remove that tree. They never came back to that place and said, "Well, this isn't going to be a a road that we're going to use any longer." But temporarily, it had to be dealt with until th that which was causing it to be impassible could be removed. And that's the same way that God works in our life, bringing us to not only a place to where that always about cleaning things out of our life, but yet to keep us in a place that where the spirit of God might have the rightway and the liberty not only in our lives, but right here among us as a body of believers. There are needs that sometimes that you might look at a person or you might think, well, there couldn't be any real severe needs. But let me tell you, every time that we come together as a body of believers, there are needs that are among us. There are lives that need a real divine touch from God and need deliverance. There are spirits that need to be cast out and broken back. And there's hearts that need to be filled and lives that need ministered to. There's sick that's among us. So within everything, there's such a a vastness among us. And and I think that within everything we could say that Lord I do not want to be part in hindering that. But I want to be part that the Holy Spirit could pass through my life that there are needs among us where deliverances can come and whatever the need is God you're more than sufficient. Let me just be a faithful part within that. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think that's the greatest one of the things that we could ask because you know agape love when we think of this you know when God agapeed the world there in John 3 he did not like the world he did not like what he was seeing or or the behaviors or of these things listen when God got a hold of our life if God would have got a hold of our life based on the things that we were doing the way way we were going about things, even how we thought about things. If God would have based it on that, he would have never touched our lives. But that's where agape love is so much different from felio love because felio love is in in its best yet it is still conditional. When the right conditions are met, then it can be expressed. But this is why that there has to come a a deeper reality in our lives of the love of God or that it goes beyond file. It's something that will work in our lives to move us and motivate us to strive then for unity because I if we agape then we will allow the correct brotherly kindness the correct expression and even of those who maybe aren't according to our taste or our like but where we're a body and love in our hearts is not a conditional things. Now, I say that very intentionally because if God wanted everybody in this church to be just exactly alike, he would have done that. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; That's why I told one individual some years back when, oh, they were looking for, you know, a church and they were talking about things. I said, just just let let me mention this to you. They weren't coming here. I said, just let me mention this to you as a fellow brother and as a pastor. Do not take a clipboard and go from church to church to church. I said, "This is what this is what you do." I said, "Do you believe that you have the Holy Spirit?" "Yes, I do." I said, "Then he's a guide." The Bible said that the spirit of truth will lead and guide you into all truth. So, it's not about a clipboard whether everything is lining up and administration is this and they do it like this and have this kind of a meeting and do this. Don't don't do that because you're going to find things that'll never alltogether match up. But if you will entrust your life to the guide, then God will guide you where you need to be. And it might not be really according to your choosing. But remember the prophet said when we have been redeemed, we no longer want our own choice. &gt;&gt; We want his choice because he has been our choice. Is that right? So you begin to see how that God would work in such a measure within that that because it does not allow us then to pull ourselves off into an island. Now notice first John chapter 3. John would write so much concerning this. He said we know that we have passed from death unto life. So this would be a litmus test because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. Now, loveth not would mean to detest or despise. Oh, I can't stand that brother. There's something wrong there. &gt;&gt; There's something wrong. You may not like per se as far as maybe the aurora or the personality. And don't try to refine that as just being well, they've got the Holy Ghost or they don't got the Holy Ghost. The prophet never did that when he talked about atmosphere because we're all made up differently. Now, I'm not making excuses, friends. I'm just trying to tell you that one thing for sure that within it is that there are differences that are there that's among us. But it no matter the differences, as it says in the word, whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer. And you know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Now remember, brother Bam says there's many more ways that you can murder a person than just killing them. &gt;&gt; He said you can take something greater than a knife and that is you can destroy their character to somebody else. &gt;&gt; Is that right? That's murdering. What what what would that be? That is trying to tear someone down. But yet listen, if they are one that Christ died for. Well, brother Samuel, we don't know that. All right, hold on. Right here, even in this body, we have lives and hearts that have come into the body of Jesus Christ. They have been baptized into the spirit of God. And then there might there are others that would be around that are in process and in journey. and God dealing with their life to bring them into the body of Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Because just to come to church, just to be affiliated around the message is not to be a part of the body of Christ. The body of Christ, we are baptized into that, not by water baptism, but baptized into that by one spirit. That's the Holy Spirit coming into our lives. And yet God would allow all of this to be all around us. Not only differences, but God will have lives in journey. And there can be lives that will never come to the knowledge of the truth. And God will allow all of that to linger for what for for what purpose? To test and display the divine perfect love of God through our lives. It's not up, you know, this is why I love it's not up to me to make the call on anybody. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to Why that that's beyond my pay grade. God did not ask me to do that. But God said only preach the word and the word will produce the right effect and it will bring forth. It has transforming power within it. Listen, there can be conditions you're looking at right now and situations. Just give God time to work. Don't put God on a time frame. Don't try to put God in a box. Let God work. And I'm telling you, even among lives that are coming in, let God work on their lives. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The love of God cannot fail. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So no matter within this, no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. &gt;&gt; What an age that we're called to. This is an age that's all about me. &gt;&gt; If it fits me, if it works okay with me, if it's convenient for me, it's all about me. This is an age of self. And yet this would be the age that God would set forth that in this age a people would actually come into that place that what they had in that alpha age where they actually came to a place of being capped off with divine love. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That the spirit of God would be able to so draw a people up into himself in all things. and God. Now, think about it. Listen, friends, let's be honest. If it's you or me, though, there's some projects at home that I've got in. I wish I had never got in. I thought I got in over my head. I thought, Lord have mercy. What have I got into? You know how it is? You start talking to yourself. What are you doing? How did you Why did you even start this? But you know what? God knows in the midst of this hour, where would light shine the brightest? When it is the darkest, it shines in the midst of this age and this hour where there's a group of people that will come to that place of maturity where the very capstone of God's grace setting down on their lives and taking us home in rapturing grace and it will be the achievement of divine love. &gt;&gt; He laid down his life for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was him &gt;&gt; laying it down for us. Notice, but whosoever hath this world's good and seeth his brother have need and shutth up his bows of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Samuel, this brother, I really like this one. I I'll help this one out. But what about the brother that you maybe don't? It's kind of like sandpaper. See, if we're not careful, we want to make that sandpaper and all of a sudden trying to determine who has the Holy Ghost and who doesn't. You have differences in your life. And the Holy Spirit will give you overcoming grace in your own life. Not take away your roughness, but he will sweeten your roughness in order to prove to you and through your life that there is something and one inside of you that is greater than was ever there before. And that is the divine love of God. What drove God to become down and become one of us? Love. &gt;&gt; The love of God that he was willing to lay aside his splendor, willing to be humiliated. Look, the body that he took on was a body of humiliation. &gt;&gt; He did not do that for himself. He did not do that to become a display down here. He was tempted in all of that to display his glory, display his power. But he came down in that body of humiliation in order to redeem you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, there's things he went through he didn't even have to, &gt;&gt; but he did. &gt;&gt; He did. And he did it willingly that he might understand you and I. &gt;&gt; He was willing to lay aside his splender. I want you to think about it. If he had not been willing, the Bible tells us in Colossians, we were enemies in our mind, in our soul, our nature, &gt;&gt; and by wicked works. But he was willing to lay aside. &gt;&gt; In order for what purpose? To redeem, not restore back that fallen nature, but to redeem what was beneath the darkness in our life. That's what he came for. He came to redeem his sons and daughters. And it would require him to lay aside &gt;&gt; his splendor. &gt;&gt; What did that &gt;&gt; love? Divine love. What will what? What is it that will cause us to be able to lay down our lives for one another? our thoughts, our feelings, our opinions. To be able to get rid of feelings, let me just say this to you. You are constantly going to have feelings, and you're going to have to constantly get rid of them. &gt;&gt; So, don't ever think that, oh, I'm going to come to this great apex of a maturity. I'll never have a wrongful thought. I'll never have a wrongful feeling. No, you're missing the point about adoption. Adoption is where you are no longer allowing this to rule you, but now where you on the inside are ruling that outer man and bringing it into subjection by the word and overriding your feelings. Oh my, you might have to pray for a period of time. The prophet said, "If you don't feel right towards that brother, go pray until you do feel right. Then go talk to them." Oh, hallelujah. I'm grateful those places were put in there because you know why this message even what I'm preaching tonight. It's not about political correctness. It's not to just get us all to say, "Amen. That's exactly right. That's what I'm doing." But it the word hits our lives in such a way that you don't need me measuring up your life. But it's the word as it's being preached. There is an examination that's going on within our lives that we can say, "Oh, God, help me, Lord God, in your mercy." But you see what it is? You're living in a time and there's seasons and there's things that's taking place that God is wanting to take you deeper and actually take you higher. &gt;&gt; Let us not love in word, &gt;&gt; neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth. You know, people will never know what's in your heart unless you express it. &gt;&gt; Brother Samuel, I really love you in my heart. Then we express it. &gt;&gt; See, God God didn't leave you and I to guess like I I wonder if he loves me. &gt;&gt; He expressed that to you and I. He laid down his life for you and I and then he sent back the Holy Ghost to deal with our life. There is no question. I mean, think how God has worked with our lives over and over and still is. &gt;&gt; Think about how long-suffering that he is. Think about how he's worked with our life. Think about things that right now that you've been praying about. You've come to an awareness in your life and said, "God, help me, Lord. I need your grace. I'm seeing that in my life." Maybe it's a complex. Maybe it's something. Oh, Lord. God, I I just Lord Jesus, help me, Lord, give me grace. You know, that thing could have laid there for years and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit has brought you to such a place of an awareness in your life of what is in your life. But you know what? That's the love of God to look beyond that. Look over that and still deal with your life and bring you to the place even that you are tonight. &gt;&gt; I want you to think about it. If it was conditional, there's not one of us here today, I don't care how good of a day you've had, there's not one of us that deserve his presence. &gt;&gt; Not one of us. &gt;&gt; Not one of us. How many times we've been in prayer or maybe you're going down the road or something and his presence will come down. We don't deserve that, friends. It's not what we deserve. God shows us it's not about our conditions. He doesn't love us based on conditional love. &gt;&gt; It's unconditional. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now notice the same thing that he would ask of us. Well, I want you to think of this in 1 Thessalonians 4:9 and 10. As touching brotherly love, this is the first epistle. As touching brotherly love, you need not that I write unto you. For ye are yourselves are taught of God to love one another &gt;&gt; even in what we just expressed and how that God became one of us. But not only in then how that he became one of us but how that individually in your life how he deals with you. How he deals with you. You are being taught the love of God &gt;&gt; where you just sometimes can back your head think Lord God Lord Jesus how could you desire to have fellowship with me Lord &gt;&gt; how could you Lord but God in his mercy he's teaching you how to love one another based on how he expresses his love towards you &gt;&gt; are being taught of God you're not being taught secondhanded but you are absolutely through the experiences in your life being taught of God on how to love one another. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but Lord, that's my prayer. I want to be taught. &gt;&gt; Most importantly, I want to be teachable, Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be closed off. I want to be teachable, Lord. Cuz sometimes you come in, listen, friends, let's just be honest. Sometimes you come into situations and we all have been there and we will be there, but you have to approach things and say, "Lord, give me the wisdom on how to approach this. Lord, how do I go about this, Lord? How do I I want your love to be set forth and to guide my life completely. Lord, I need your wisdom." You know where all that's coming from? It's desiring God not only to teach us, but it's also a part in our life that is absolutely humbling ourselves and submitting to the love of God &gt;&gt; that he might work his way through our lives. Oh, I know. I know &gt;&gt; we don't like uncomfortableness. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; I don't like uncomfortableness. Do you? &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; I don't like that. But you know, God allows that to be because there cannot be a pearl produced &gt;&gt; without there being a grain of sand to irritate. &gt;&gt; And when the grain of sand gets in there to irritate, what happens? What happens to that grain of sand? It gets covered over with all of that excretion from that inside of that oyster there, that clam. It becomes all covered over. And then people pay countless prices. They will auction them off for sometimes in the astronomical amounts of money and for what? Things that were put together as a string of irritations. &gt;&gt; That have become a symbol of beauty. See, that's what the love of God in our life, working out in our life, is actually able to take the things that are irritating. And it's not covering over someone, but it's actually God so covering over in our own will, in our life to wear it will reflect him in character that's priceless. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; And indeed, watch this. And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia. But we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more. So we can increase. This is just one of many places in the scripture where Paul would admonish them. And how that we can absolutely increase in the love of God to where that it's actually less of us and more of God. But notice toward all the brethren. I find that to be very peculiar. What a commendation that it would write that it wouldn't just be something that you are displaying love but toward all the brethren. Remember the prophet tells us in that day on Calvary right before he preaches the kinsman redeemer. Oh brother Brandham I can live for that man right there. He's a good man. Brother Bram says, "But can you live for that man that hates you? &gt;&gt; Can you live for that man who would kill you if he had the opportunity?" He said, "That's how you're able to test eternal life." Think about that. See, if in our minds it's things that, listen, friends, we battle within our humanity sometimes, maybe some more than others with temperament and how we're made up. And every one of us have different battles. But there can be lines that you can draw. Oh, they may not be drawn out here on the floor, but it can be lines that are drawn that we're not going to cross this line or cross that line. But in reality, where does that spring from? It is not God that would actually lead us to draw lines and to bring separation. Well, brother Samuel, this brother's wrong or this sister's wrong. Well, you're not going to help him by drawing a line. They don't need to be pushed down any further. They need help up. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; They need help up. Now notice, watch how this is word here in Ephesians 5 and verse one. Be ye therefore followers of God as dear children. and walk in love as Christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savor. So this is the key. Walk in love. Once again, if this was something that like the song we we sang here, fill my day every day with love. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; How many know there's distractions throughout the day? your greatest plans that you can have in the morning. I'm going to do this and do that and do this. And how many times have you had things come in your mind that's hijacked your thoughts and all of a sudden you think, I'm going to take care of this and before you know it, what you were going to take care of very quickly has taken up time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's flustered, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's it's just ate things up. Why? That's a tactic of the enemy because Satan knows our strength. You might say, "What does that mean?" just that little bit of reading or taking that little bit of time to pray. I tell you what it means. It means that you're putting God before you always. Lord, I don't even want to face the problems of the day. I don't even want to face even the things that I think aren't problems. I don't want to face the day without you. It doesn't got to be something that's a great big long prayer. But it's just to put him before you when you're getting ready to go on your job, when you're getting ready to go in the shift, when you're on your way to work. Lord, go in before me today, Lord. Watch over me. May your presence, Lord, just accompany me, Lord. No matter where it's going around, Lord, speak to my heart today, Lord God. Let my life, Lord, be a channel where the spirit of God can flow through my life. Speak to me, Lord. Reveal your word to me, Lord. Things that I've been hearing your prophet say, what I've been reading in the message and under the services, Lord, speak to my heart today, Lord God. &gt;&gt; Walk in love, &gt;&gt; right? Hallelujah. Oh my. I know we could say more within that, but to walk as an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savor. Notice in Galatians 5 verse 13. For brethren, you have been called unto liberty. only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Now, this word, this phrase is not talking about worthiness. This love is not based upon worthiness, but by love serve one another. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, thou shalt love thy neighbor &gt;&gt; as thyself. Remember they asked, "Who's my neighbor?" &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You remember that that that scribe? He was trying to slip out of that one. &gt;&gt; He got a little tight in that service. He Well, who is my neighbor? And Jesus brings it right down on how the everything, the law and the prophets, the commandments hang upon this. &gt;&gt; Yes. and who is my neighbor is one that I see is in need &gt;&gt; now. It isn't altogether somebody laying beside the road like when Jesus speaks of the good Samaritan. They may not be laying down there where they have been beaten and they have been robbed physically, but Satan may have robbed them and may have told them all kinds of lies and and tried to build grudges and resentments and tell them nobody loves him and nobody cares for him. But that's your neighbor. When you see that one in need, that's why the prophet said there are many gifts &gt;&gt; of healing. And he says there's many ways that God will heal. &gt;&gt; He said God can heal an old grudge through love &gt;&gt; that's stretched out. &gt;&gt; He takes us through a whole litany of things that can actually work. Well, they don't deserve that. But you don't deserve his presence either. Many times you don't deserve him to come by your way and pick you up. Oh, I know. We may not be laying down on the ground, but sometimes we can be so oppressed within our mind, in our spirit, that we need help from God. And God comes by our way and he lifts us up, he'll drop a word. He'll have the ravens to drop just what we need. The angels of God. Do we deserve it? No. &gt;&gt; No. But God says, "You're my neighbor." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As the prophet puts it like this, God says to you when we have come into that place with him, we're buddies. God sees my neighbor is down. My neighbor needs help. My neighbor needs encouragement. Who is my neighbor? Who do you see that's in need? &gt;&gt; Who do you see that's in need? Well, brother Samuel, they haven't been to church in weeks. Maybe they haven't been. I've seen them sitting there. Really? Really? You see, if you see someone in need, that's your neighbor. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's your neighbor. &gt;&gt; And God is may not be everybody else in the body that is maybe seeing it in that life, but God lets you see that. And how do you serve them? By love. It ain't that maybe you're going along, maybe there's something that they got going. It ain't about you got to compromise. That's not what we're talking about, friends. But we're talking about that prophet tells us over and over. He said, "Sometimes people just need a hand." &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; A hand and encouragement, love that'll break that. Oh, remember remember how the man he kept on walking into the house? His neighbor was his wife. She would give him what for? from coming in from them meetings. And here the prophet told him said, "You're going all wrong about it." Took in a box of chocolates. You've heard me recite this hundreds of times. But I want you to think of it ain't about how much that you and you and I can finish it. It just goes to show sometimes we can become so geared and that we're wanting to express the right thing. This has to be broken this way. This has to be broken this way. Let me just tell you friends, God has a way of totally blowing up our ideas. You know, the greatest thing that'll win people to the house of God, and the greatest thing that'll win them to listen to you is a display of divine love that you care about them. &gt;&gt; And sometimes you've got to take time and go out of your way. &gt;&gt; Man, maybe I need you to stop right here. &gt;&gt; We're living in We're living, friends, in this moment where we can look and see and you got a choice. H too busy. Oh, I don't have time for that. I don't have time for this. But you see, watch the very next phrase. Some of you got your Bible open. You don't have to. But I I I just want you to watch. Look at the very next verse. Very next verse out of Galatians. But if ye bite and devour one another, that's the alternative. &gt;&gt; That's called cannibalism. If a house be divided against itself, how can it stand? &gt;&gt; How many love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This I say then, walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. That's a key right there. Walk in the spirit. Well, brother Samuel, I've been born in the spirit, then walk in it. And walk in it is a decision and a choice daily to live under the influence of the Holy Spirit. Didn't say that the lust and desires would not come, &gt;&gt; but when we're under that influence, &gt;&gt; that white dog will always prevail. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? So this is where when we see that the whole Christian move and brother Bra asks asked the question. He says, "Oh, how many would like to see a real Bible church? A real Bible church where all the spiritual gifts were set in order. Everything making it manifest just exactly the way he said it should be." Oh, wouldn't that be wonderful? Now, we're going to have to sacrifice not money. You're going to have to sacrifice what? &gt;&gt; Some of your own ideas. You're going to have to sacrifice some time in prayer. You're going to have to sacrifice maybe a stubborn will to break down in humility. The whole Christian move is sacrificial. You're sitting here tonight. You made a sacrifice to be here tonight. I I want to also tell you I appreciate that from the bottom of my heart. I want to say God bless you on behalf of our Lord Jesus. I want to say God bless you cuz you made a sacrifice to be here. You might say, "Brother Sammy, I'm retired. I didn't come from work." But you had to fight through every demon. You had to fight through all kinds of mind battles and everything else that wanted to come your way. Things where the Satan wanted to beset you. But you made a choice and there was an overcoming in your life. So do not allow the enemy to minimize that. I say God bless you. &gt;&gt; The whole Christian move, every bit of it is sacrificial. &gt;&gt; I want you to think of this. The prophet tells us like this. He said, "As long as Satan can keep you firing at one another, he'll just sit back and say, "Brother, I don't even have to fight." But if we could just get together and look up to God as brethren and and step in arming and united, you don't have to change from one church to the other, you do what you do the way you want to. Them little differences you make is no difference anyhow. God give every one of you the Holy Ghost. God gives the Holy Ghost to who obeys him. So surely somebody has obeyed God. But the thing, as long as Satan can keep the little differences, that's what makes the church in such a commotion as it is today. Let's forget that thing and come together. Notice what he's saying. Let's forget that thing. Not pretend. Well, let's pretend it didn't happen. Let's forget it. &gt;&gt; How do we forget it? How do we actually forget it or put things in the past? Paul would would would would admonish us in Colossians. And there is a place, this is not, let me say this, every bit of this that that I'm reading from here tonight, it's not things that we're looking at and saying, well, it's just a switch within you. Well, I just forgot it. No, it sometimes it takes in our in our lives being honest. the Lord, there's some feelings it's not right. But as a son and daughter of God, you are taking it before the throne of God. You're not taking it on Instagram. You're not taking it on Facebook. You're not taking it to this breakfast or that one or this person's house. But as a son of God, don't allow the enemy to condemn you for the feelings that he's tried to stir up in you. But take it in his presence because in the presence of God, that's where your enemy can be dealt with. &gt;&gt; You don't have to be ashamed to bring him in there. Let me preach it now. You don't have to be, well, I had this feeling. You don't have to walk in there with shame. Let me tell you, Esther, the scepter is extended to you. &gt;&gt; It's recognizing I'm going to have disturbances in my flesh. I'm going to have feelings, but I'm going to go to him. I'm going to go to him. I'm going to go to him who gives me the strength. &gt;&gt; Because where does the cleansing of the death come from? From the inside. &gt;&gt; So, I'm not going to re reside on the outside realms. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go to God. all of our differences. You ever been around, y'all, I know I'm saying I'm talking plain here. You ever been around situations and things and you can maybe on the job, let's say on the job or family or whatever more and you come into things and you've got maybe that uncle that's sitting right there and that uncle is talking about this aunt over here and this and that and here that their back is to him and that aunt's coming this way and here you are sitting there with that plate of food and you're just looking up. You're just like, "Lord, what do I do right now? Do I go ahead and say something or what? Right? Cuz you know if that aunt walks up and then this is said, it's awkward, &gt;&gt; right? And it really isn't that you wanted to hear that anyhow, right? You understand what I mean? But it becomes you're trying to change something. Then you got sometimes individuals that can come into a situation and all of a sudden and and listen, everybody is made up so differently. Sometimes you'll have individuals and they'll just want to drop something and it's of things that you think, wait a minute, there's already been resolved to this. But you you know what that is? Listen, don't demean the individual because that now becomes another way of being tested in divine love. Because all that is is the enemy want to try to stir up commotion, &gt;&gt; one to try to make a scene, one to try to break things apart. I mean, you go into a restaurant, just imagine this. You go, "Oh my, I can't wait to get in this restaurant. Man, I'm my steak. I'm going to have that ribeye. It's going to be medium. Oh, it's going to be so tender. going to be hot pink center. How I'm going to have that baked potato all loaded up and probably making both your m your mouth water and mine is too. And you get in there and all of a sudden you're coming up to the door. You already can taste that steak and all of a sudden there is people running out of there and saying this is terrible. This has been the worst. This you're probably not going to feel like going in there. It's a commotion that's kind of worked for you to look over your wife and say, "What do you think? &gt;&gt; Maybe Mexican tonight, huh?" &gt;&gt; See, just commotion. And that's all the enemy wants to do is try to get commotion, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; What's he doing that based on differences? Notice he said, "We're the other brother is just as much in Christ as we are. There's no big men, little men, no superiors. We're children. We're one in Christ. And our little differences don't make any difference. Whether Becky wants a blue dress, Sarah wants a red one. They're both getting dresses, so they mustn't argue about it. Right? &gt;&gt; You know what's amazing is that within these differences, the prophet tells us in God hiding in simplicity in Albuquerque, New Mexico, that when we stand there on the other side, soon as we've been changed and the rapture has come, all the differences will fade away. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; But God would allow the differences to remain while we're here in time because you know why? We're still here in these bodies. Differences that become so evident among us. Differences that you can look at and think, how in the world did God put a group of people like this together? And if you can be very honest, you can even look as husband and wife. And if you begin to realize where God brings you to into that place, you realize God knew just what he was doing when he put us together. God knew just what he was doing. It don't mean that we don't get on one another's nerves. It don't mean that there ain't differences. &gt;&gt; There is. Is that right? There is. Now let let me just let me just try to go here just a few more moments. In the book of Ephesians, Paul would write here about this this tabernacle, this dwelling place where he said, "For through him we have both accessed by one spirit unto the father. Therefore, you are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of God, and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself, being the chief cornerstone, in whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord, in whom ye also are builded together for inhabitation through the spirit. So closely joined together. That's what fitly. Closely joined together. Builded together to take multiple parts and bring them together under one purpose and one plan in unity. Think of this. I want you to look at Solomon's temple here just for a moment. the stones where the prophet would, you know, brother Brandon would pick this up and speak on this many different times. But in first Kingsapter 6:7, notice what it says regarding this house, this temple. And this house when it was in building was built of stone, made ready before it was brought thither. So the stones were cut out in their own native lands. So when they got there, the scripture says, when they came, the stones were brought together. There was neither an hammer nor an axe nor a tool of iron heard in the house while it was in the building. &gt;&gt; So God didn't bring the stones together and all of a sudden saying, "I need to hack this off of you. We need to shape you a little different. Need to make you a little taller. We need to shape this. We need to do No. There was no sound of hammer, axe, any type of an iron tool. Now, in many ways, watch. Brother Brandon will type this in multiple ways. He'll type it in that of how that God would bring us together in that of a local body. And he'll also type it as the stones that are coming together at the time of the rapture that God will bring everything together in this great unity and harmony. And notice the bringing together in that unity and harmony comes by God revealing himself &gt;&gt; right now. That's what's drawn us &gt;&gt; together. That's what's drawn us out of this walk of life and this walk of life. You didn't know you were a stone that was a part of this building. You didn't know that. I didn't know that. But God in his mercy, he already knew that. And God sends a word and all of a sudden it begins to lay hold and breathe with a purpose and the will of God upon your life to begin to bring you into the place that God might place you &gt;&gt; in his body. &gt;&gt; Different. Oh my. There'll be a stone next to a stone and that stone would be ever so different. But notice the stones were cut according to the blueprint and they were placed in their proper position. The prophet says it like this. Many of the stones looked very odd. But there was a place in the temple for every odd &gt;&gt; peculiar stone. God had a place for him. Our ministries which is a beautiful type or anotype shows that in our peculiarity our way of worship. So see, God's not interested in make everybody worship the same way. &gt;&gt; That's why that going from one church to another church, respect it. &gt;&gt; Right? Just as much as when when people come here, respect it. &gt;&gt; I'm not and I don't I don't say this, we don't say this for any way, but we're not going to change just because, oh, somebody's coming, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And I don't say that without the love of God. I'm just trying to say that within it, it's always that respect and the peculiarity of the way of worship. What are you saying, brother Samuel? God has not chosen any ministry to be the pope of music in this hour. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No, we already have an absolute God. I don't need a pastor. I don't need somebody to interpret that to me. God has already interpreted his word. Right. &gt;&gt; You think what a sorry thing it would be where you had to call me every time. Brother Samuel, do you think it's all right if I'd get this? Brother Samuel, you think it's all right if I do this? Brother Sammy, if you don't I'm not the Holy Ghost for you. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be the Holy Ghost for you. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? I've got confidence in a personal relationship with God. I believe there's things where as a pastor, God gives you a pastor that you can say, you can bring things and we can pray together and look for the counsel of God. Sure, God has that avenue, but I think you get what I mean is that we all have our peculiarities, &gt;&gt; and our way of worship, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; There's some people that like practicing before they sing. Others don't. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Others don't. There's some that like, you know, certain things, like certain albums that are cut out of a studio. Others don't. Others like the impromptu of the live, the dynamics that come with that. It's preferences. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Then then again, of course, if we depends on if we want to spiritualize, that's a tendency we over we begin to spiritualize our preferences. In our peculiarity, our way of worship, when the temple, the real temple that we come to after a few minutes comes together, there'll be a place for every odd acting person. &gt;&gt; You ought to say, "Thank God I'm there." For every odd acting person. Odd to who? It ain't odd to you, but it might be odd to somebody else. But then once again, that's a test of the differences among us &gt;&gt; because there's got to be something greater than likes, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's got to be the love of God. &gt;&gt; And that which will actually move and unites us together, it will not be our likes. Oh, I know you might like this one and might like this one, but that's not what unites you. If that's what unites you, there's a big problem right there. &gt;&gt; There's a big problem right there. You see, it's okay to have the likes, but there's got to be something greater than just the likes. It's got to be the love of God. You cannot have out here, out here, outside of this this this this triple brick that we have right here. You do not just have bricks sitting on top of one another. &gt;&gt; They've got mortar between them. &gt;&gt; And those that mortar between them is what holds them in place. &gt;&gt; What is it that holds you and I in position? &gt;&gt; What is that? the love of God, &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let Let's stand. I'll finish this quote because I'm not going to keep going tonight. Some of you probably thinking, "God, thank you for your mercy." I don't know about you friends, but I enjoy this. Even Even if it's tearing me all to pieces, the Lord, I say, tearing me all to pieces. &gt;&gt; I want to be more like him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "We might look funny to somebody else, act a little funny, but remember, it's the place there for us." God is cutting out his church. And every little stone had its place fit exactly to it. Remember, it was cut away from the place it would be put together at. But when it come together, it didn't even need honing. It was already honed. &gt;&gt; God made it so it fit perfectly in its place. Ram says, "Oh, what a type we find of the spiritual. How every gift of God, every odd acting, every odd act of born again Christians in their peculiarity, yet it's got its place. It fits in the body. it goes to its right place. He said many of us would try to say now that's not of God. A good holy consecrated soldier of the cross and we say now we stood in church the other night and we heard such and such a thing that can't be of God. But if it's in line with the pattern, if it's in line with the scripture, it may be odd, but it's going to have its place. It'll fit right in. And it won't even need honing or polishing. It'll go to its place for the great architect Christ is preparing it now odd one to another. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; let's just stop right here for tonight. Differences. We're going to have them until we step from this side &gt;&gt; to that side. Now we have an opportunity to be honest and come to places and say, "Lord, teach me how to deal &gt;&gt; with differences. &gt;&gt; Let the love of God because listen friends, let me just say this to you. Sometimes depending on even our upbringing as children, maybe coming through teenagehood and so forth, we weren't taught those things. But even if we were, we still need in this capacity the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Because you can take a person that could, man, they can get along with every Oh, I tell you, you couldn't rub them the wrong way. They get along with everybody, but that don't mean that they got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram tells us in that statue of a perfect man, there's many people, he said, that have these virtues &gt;&gt; within their natural self. They're not of they're not that that's godly, but they have that. You've met people that are as patient a patient can be. &gt;&gt; You think, you know what? I know why you're a kindergarten teacher. I know why you're a preschool teacher. Right? And then the same thing the way we look at patience there. You can look at others sixth grade, seventh grade. I know why you are. I know there's but it's it's patience but it's works in a different way. &gt;&gt; For what? According to the need that's at hand. But you see within these things how God would so work within our lives and us to come to that place to understand of differences. We have them, but one of these days they'll all fade away. But you know, I don't believe God wants us to stand here and say, "Oh, I'm longing for that day." When so and so is different, Lord. Even so, come Lord Jesus. Come, Lord Jesus. That's not even the right the right reason, &gt;&gt; right? It's not even the right reason. Even when you're praying for the coming of the Lord. I I believe you should. Even on your job, we're people of his coming. You should expect him to come on your job and help you. &gt;&gt; We're people of the coming. You should expect him to come every day in your life. Lord, I need help. I need strength. &gt;&gt; But in the meantime, in the meantime, God has allowed these differences. And if he wanted to strip all of them away, he would have done that. that God said, "I tell you what I'll do. I'll take this stone and this stone, this stone, and this stone." Lord have mercy. Lord, no. Not you're Lord. Surely you're not going to put these two side by side. I am. And you're going to put these stones above them. I am. And you're going to put these stones below them. I am. How is it going to work? Ah, because my love in them will serve as the mortar to overcome the differences. My love, my victory will shine through redeemed vessels that will actually come to a place in their life to be able to overlook differences by the love of God. I say, "Lord, help me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Help me. &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord." You know how it is in your family. Your children are all different. You might have two, four, five, three, our three boys, they're different. They got similarities, but they're different. They're different. I mean, in their personalities, the way things are, they're different. And they approach within that even certain things they like, certain things they don't like. You find that even in your home, but finding in the body. But I'm so glad that God made a way. &gt;&gt; That's something that's just not me having to put up with you and you put up with me. I'll tell you, I'm just going to put up with brother Samuel until the rapture. It ain't about putting up. That ain't what God that ain't the achievement. But it's where love itself can have victory and prove victory in our life beyond the differences. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that powerful? Isn't it powerful what the love of God look what it's done in your life? &gt;&gt; Look what it will continue to do. &gt;&gt; Don't allow the differences to be your focus, but let the love of God be your focus. Even in your life, maybe you're standing here, sitting here, maybe streaming, and in your life you see differences. Brother Sam, I'm not I'm not there yet. Well, don't focus on the differences, but focus on the love of God that's calling to your heart &gt;&gt; and saying, "My son, my daughter, come come into me fully." Don't focus on your differences, but focus on him who's able to make a real difference in your life. You love him. &gt;&gt; Let's pray together tonight. Father, Lord God, sometimes Lord, how things don't go, Lord, as we maybe have looked at or thought or where we're going to get to, but that that really, Lord, I've I've learned that really don't matter. What matters, Lord, is that you've been able to have your way and speak to our hearts according to the needs in our lives. Lord, there's not one of us that's gathered here tonight or that would be streaming this message. But Lord, what could say, "I want more." Lord, help me Lord to empty up. Help me Lord through that counsel that you've given knowing feelings and things will come but may we never never allow feelings to become a resident in our lives. But Lord God, may we Lord, I pray by the love of God, take every burden, take every care, take every feeling. It may not even be Lord God, a feeling that's between brothers and sisters here. It might be a feeling Lord of something in family, feeling Lord of on the job. But we want to have the right we want to have the right feeling Lord. So I pray that Lord as we come to you Lord once again here this evening and we see Lord in our lives it's continuously as the scripture admonished us walk in love. Let your life, let it be regulated by the love of God. Let it be the umpire, the rule, the absolute in your life. Oh God, help us, Lord. I want to say I don't believe that there's coming a bride. I believe she's on earth tonight. I believe we're a part of that, Lord. Not by our merits, no, but by the grace of God. Lord, like the scripture would say, "Behold, what manner of love is this that hath been bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God." Oh Lord, [Music] help us, Lord. I pray. Lord, if there's one thing, Lord, when it all comes down, all said and done, we're not going to be taken out of here because of great miracles and things that's been done. Lord, how I thank you for every miracle. Thank you for every need. But Lord, the achievement in this hour is divine love. [Music] And when your prophet when he was he come back from the other side, he had already been a changed man, he was already full of the Holy Ghost. But when he slipped back as he said, "Do I got to go back in that body that was laying on the bed?" And over and over he would say, "I cannot be the same William Brandham that I was before since I visited that place. It will take perfect love to get there." Never said it would take that it would have to be Lord God miracles and signs and wonders. All of those are needed as accompaniments along the way. But the separating, what will separate will be the love of God, the seal of the living God in the heart of the believer. Lord, I realize sometimes Lord, the enemy wants to make light to individuals. What are you doing? What part do you have? But Lord God, this is the hour that we're not to despise small things, but that part as a stone that you've called us to be. The prophet would re remind us, he said in that message, maybe it's a housewife, maybe it's at the grocery store, maybe it's at this place, it's at this and our families. [Music] Lord God, help us. Lord, some Lord may never be used in certain capacities as others. That that doesn't matter. But what matters is the love of God from our heart. And Lord God, when they can, Lord Jesus, rest upon that to say, Lord, I know what you've done in my life. I know where you took me from, and I know how you cleaned me up, and you've filled my life, Lord. Taken the very desire of the world out. And only thing, Lord, in my heart's desire is I want to please you, Lord God. May they be ever so thankful for that work of grace because that's the greatest miracle that could ever be done and that the love of God would so triumph through their lives. Oh, Father, when they would go, Lord, to want to pull back maybe by human nature or things that they've been through and experiences in life, it would just be natural tendencies. But Lord God, as Paul said, the love of God constrainth us. There's another force on the inside. There's a strength, Lord, a hidden power, the love of God that moves within our heart, Lord God, that will not allow those feelings will allow not allow things to reside in that life. But Lord God to drive us to that place. Lead us to that place. Guide us to that place. [Music] Help us Lord. I wonder Lord sometimes if we've not overlooked where this great adoption would bring us to. how the Lord Jesus would be pressed upon many times in the temple and he would slip right on by. Even when they were trying to get him to say something, they pulled beard out of his face, spit on him. But what was it? What caused that to be in that way that he would say, "Father, forgive them. They don't even know what they're doing. It was the love of God. I'm so glad. I'm so glad he was willing to drink his bitter cup. I'm so glad he was willing to look beyond the shame of the cross and see the joy that was set before him. to know what that victory on Calvary and raising on that Easter morning what it would do in my life and in the lives of others Lord. [Music] Oh God, grant it. Lord, help us. Lord, help us, Father. Lord God, may the Holy Spirit just take this word, Lord, even as we would go from this place and from the presence of one another, Lord, just continue to move upon our lives. Press through us, Lord. move down, Lord, for each heart, each life. Lord, perhaps there's one or others here that would say or would stream, Lord, I want that love of God. I want that seal of the Holy Spirit in my life, I want that. I want that reality that will stand that where the desires of this world have faded and the only desire is I just want to please God. Lord Jesus granted, Lord, it doesn't take, Lord, a great effort from our lives. It takes us to believe you, Lord God, and to accept what you've done for us. You can meet them right there, Lord God, as they're streaming, Lord God. May be sickness in their body, circumstances, but you can meet them right there, the same as you can meet right here tonight, Lord. There's a need, and you're the God. You're Jehovah Gyra and you still meet the needs of your children. Grant it, Lord God. Grant it, Lord. I pray. May the love of God just sweep down, Lord. Drive back, Lord God. every spirit of darkness, Lord. Every spirit of doubt, Lord, every spirit of anxiety, Lord, every spirit of depression, Lord God, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Satan, you're defeated and you're a liar and you're nothing but a bluff. And in the name of Jesus Christ, we call your hand to it. The love of God is greater. Grant it Lord. Grant it Lord. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Yes Lord. I want to be a vessel you work through. I want to be Lord of you. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Lord God. Oh God. &gt;&gt; Oh I want to be more like you. Jesus, I want to be more like you. [Music] Oh, I want to be a vessel that you work through more like you. [Music] Yes, Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Jesus, I want to be more like you. [Applause] [Music] You work through. Oh, I want to be more like you. Hallelujah. Lord, I want to be more like you. Yes, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Want to be more like &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. be amazing. You were through. &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to be more like you. [Music] Make me more. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord God. Jesus [Music] make me more like you. [Music] Oh, give me a heart that's filled with love. and make me more like make me more. Oh, may be more by Jesus. Make him more my peace. Oh, give me a heart and fill with love and make me more like me. [Music] And I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God. I've been washed in the fountain. I'm cleansed by his blood. join in with Jesus as we travel this summer. Oh, I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God. You will notice if we say brother, sister around here, it's because we're a family and these folks are so dear. When one has a heartache, we all share the tears and rejoice in each victory in this family. So deep. Oh, I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God. I've been washed in the fountain. I'm cleansed by his blood. We're joint airs with Jesus as we travel this summer. I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God. From the door of an orphanage to the house of the king. No longer an outcast. A new song I sing. From gra to riches, from the weak to the strong. Oh, I'm not worthy to be here, but praise God, I belong. And I'm so glad. I'm a part of a family of God. I've been washed in the fountain. Oh, cleans by his blood. Oh, join in with Jesus as we travel this song. I'm so glad I'm a part of the family. Oh, we're joint airs with Jesus as we travel this summer. I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God. Hallelujah. [Applause] Oh, hallelujah. Thank you. Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, we love you tonight. Thank you. Thank you for your word. Thank you for our to let us be part of a body, Lord Jesus, with with precious brothers and sisters, Lord Jesus. As brother said, tonight, we look around. We love one another, Lord. And the ones that maybe couldn't be here, they're sick or whatever, Lord. We love them. Praying for them, too, Lord God. Just such a when we see one missing, Lord, there's just something in our heart. It's just like something's not right, Lord. And we miss them, Lord Jesus. when we come to the appointed time of worship, whether they're sick or whatever's going on, Lord, just pray that you'd bless them and help them, Lord Jesus. May, as the Bible said, may we increase in our love, Lord. Increase in the brotherly kindness and these things and patience and things with one another, Lord God, as fitly joined together, Lord Jesus. Help us to just may there be more of that mortar come in, Lord Jesus, and and just be a be a glue to us, Lord Jesus, and hold us together, no matter how oddly shaped we might be, Lord Jesus. We just want to fit together, Lord, and and and be a help us all to to reflect you to one another, Lord Jesus. To reflect your light, one another. We love you, Lord. We thank you for this message tonight, Lord. May you bless it. May it strengthen us, Lord Jesus, and uh be a light on our path. And when we deal with one another, Lord, whether we have differences or things, may this service come back to our memory, Lord Jesus, and and help us to just show the love of the Holy Ghost one to another. Watch over us until we should meet again. We love you and give you thanks in Jesus name. And church says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." God bless you. May the Lord go with you. We look forward to seeing you again on Sunday, Lord willing. I'm so glad I'm a part of The family of God. I've been washed in the fountain, cleansed by his blood.
