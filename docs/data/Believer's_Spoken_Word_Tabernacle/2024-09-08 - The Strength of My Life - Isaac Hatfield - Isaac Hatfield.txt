Brother Ray and brother Wayne and all the saints there in bluon Ohio amen they just love you guys so much and just feels like a sister Church to come here and we just want to greet you all and um my father helped drive me up this morning and we're thankful for that my wife my wife couldn't be here this morning amen some of you may know she's been going through through a real battle amen so if you just continue to lift her up in prayer amen but we've come this morning with a common enemy with a common goal amen we you know Satan rages amen he comes against us but we've been given a weapon amen we've been given a Word of Promise we've been given a slingshot of prayer that brother Brandon would say that you could take that slingshot and go after God's Sheep amen so that's what we're to do this morning it's becoming of us to fulfill all righteousness Amen in the midst of Trials amen sometimes it's not always easy but it's becoming of you to take a stand amen and press the Battle For The Goal amen so we're just thankful amen I'm excited to be in church amen amen excited to take a few swings back at the Devil amen so if you have your Bibles thank you musician we're going to turn to the Book of Psalms chapter 27 Amen in the in the middle of all of this that she's been going through the Lord just begin to deal with my heart on this on this thought amen so we'll just read the whole chapter then we'll have you be seated amen it says the Lord is my light and my salvation and Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell and though when host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing yeah I will sing praises unto the Lord here oh Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me when thou sayest seek ye my face believe me not neither forsake me oh God and my salvation when my father and my mother forsake me then the Lord will take me up teach me thy way oh Lord and Lead Me in a plain path because of mine enemies deliver me not over onto the will of mine enemies for false Witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living but wait on the Lord Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord amen if we could bow our heads and if you have a need this morning just make it known unto the Lord amen he's never present help in the time of trouble Heavenly Father we approach your throne this morning Lord with confidence father Lord that you see the very depths of our hearts Lord that your word is still a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart father we approach you boldly father knowing Lord that all things are possible to them that believe father Lord that we can ask and believe and we believe that we shall receive that which we have asked Lord that if we seek we shall find Lord if we knock it shall be opened unto us Lord father if we ask for bread would you give us a stone father Lord but you are a mighty God and and we call upon your name this morning asking father that you just have your way in this meeting Lord praying that your spirit would just begin to come down and brw through this congregation father and minister to the needs of your children Lord and we'll be sure to give you the glory and the honor father as we commit this service into your hands in Jesus name amen you may have your seats this morning we're going to take a thought if we could out of that first verse and if we could take a title it be the strength of my life the strength of my life and when we talk about strength there's different types of strength you know there's the strength of the natural man the strength of of your muscles to be able to do a certain amount of work or lift a certain amount of weight you have a natural strength and brother Brandon would say that um that Christians sometimes would have a so-called religious strength where they would burn a candle every night amen or put their name on a book and and think that that they were getting strength from that it's the strength of Christianity so-called brother Brandon would say but what we're talking about like David would speak about is spiritual strength that the Christian has it's it's a strength that he could say the Lord is the strength of my life amen it's it's not the strength of your natural physique but it's the strength of of your spirit it's the strength that that allows you to overcome daily and and David would say the Lord is the strength of my life and if you look at the definition of of that word strength it's in one sentence the quality or state of being physically strong but another definition is the capacity of an object or substance to withstand great force or pressure amen and we're living in a time of great force and a time of great pressure uh the Church of the Living God is under a pressure amen and the world as a whole is under a pressure but but spiritual warfare uh the believer faces it every day and and and when you begin to come and maybe into even a closer walk with the Lord sometimes you face greater pressures and and greater trials amen because the Lord's testing his children and he puts you through the pressures but he's given you a strength to withstand the pressures and me to withstand would be to to remain undamaged by or to remain unaffected by me that you can go through a trial but but it doesn't damage you it it doesn't even affect you am mean like those like those Hebrew children would go through the fiery furnace and the smell of smoke wouldn't even be wouldn't even be on when they come through it and that's what it is to have a strength to withstand it's that you can come through something and remain unaffected you don't lose your faith you don't lose your joy you you don't lose your worship and me you still come to the house of God because it's a strength of your life that you're able to withstand as Paul would write take onto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand amen for we are fighting a strong enemy but brother Brandon would say our Warfare is not carnal but it's strong Bringing Down the strongholds of the enemy amen I I like this brother brandom this a whole prayer but in this prayer brother brandom says that we father God we would not only pray for these here but for those stretched out across the world that are needy both spiritually and physically give to them oh Lord the desires of their hearts because thy children are struggling in these days he said the oppression of the enemy is so strong but Thou Art stronger for it is written greater is he that's in you that is than he that is in the world Amen and I just like the devil to hear that today I mean uh the devil is strong the oppression of the enemy is strong but God has said greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world and we serve a god that is stronger than any devil a god that is stronger than any Spirit than any opposition but he said I'll give you a strength that you might withstand because something about that devil he cannot withstand the word of God Amen brother Brandon would come into contact with with doctors of divinity and all kinds of things and and they would boast and they and they would Bluff and they would have a loud voice of opposition against him but whenever he would make the claim you come up here on this platform and you show me in the scriptures where I'm wrong they would they would never come in the presence of that word because Satan can't withstand the word am mean he he he's got a loud voice he he he's got got a scary voice and he's got a loud boast but he has no strength to withstand the word of God and mean that's why you as Believers when the Lord becomes the strength of your life you have an ability to withstand through the word every opposition every spirit amen out of hell and me every sickness that the devil try to throw against you you have an ability to withstand amen because God has provided a place for you to go and hide from the fiery darts of the enemy and me and the Lord is the strength of my life when David would write this if you look in the strong concordance what that word strength means it's a fortified place or or a fortress it's a defense and in Jeremiah it would even write oh Lord my strength and my Fortress and my refuge in the day of affliction mean God has provided for us a strength that would be like a fortress all around you and and that's why David could write in Psalms 27 that when the wicked even my enemies and my foes come against me he said who shall I fear is that the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid amen the believer's not been given the spirit of fear but that's why you can stand in the face of enemy and say I do not fear the wicked I do not fear my foes I do not fear my enemies because the Lord is my Fortress amen the name of the Lord is a strong tower that the righteous would run into it and they would be safe amen a a man that's born of the kingdom of God a man that's born of the Holy Ghost has not one thing to fear how many times when you turn on the tape you hear brother brandom saying if I could just get the fear away from the church if I could just get them to see who they are and and and and where they're standing then they then there wouldn't be any fear upon them and if you could ever get to that place to realize that you are HID away in the time of trouble and mean that when the world is falling apart all around us you don't have one thing to fear amen your future is clear amen it's secure Amen brother Brandon would come and preach to us the message modern events made clear by prophecy amen it wasn't modern events made confused by prophecy but when we look out at this world Amen and to the Natural man it would look like the future is so unclear everything is so unstable amen but we've received a Vindicated word which has brought Clarity Amen in modern events the what's going on in the world what's going on in politics am me we're not confused but it's clearer than ever before that we are living in the Vindication and fulfillment of the words of the prophets that have come before us amen it's clear modern events have been made clear and to those that are in The Fortress amen you have nothing to fear you are HID away amen the Rapture is our goal there's a Clarity there's an overcoming oh there's a hidden place you can go with the Lord and let off the pressures and withstand the pressure of this neurotic age amen but it's it's got to come through the Lord amen for for in Romans it would say that that for when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the ungodly amen and so we didn't always have this strength amen this strength didn't always belong to the Church of the Living God but God made a a way that that that in his own strength of a natural man that he would be willing to walk that road to gotha he would be willing to take the humble road to Calvary amen and as he w walked that road the blood would drip down from his legs amen and that and that animal skin would slap against those bloody legs amen but brother Aaron what was happening was he was becoming weaker and weaker as that blood left his body as he would cry out my God why has Thou forsaken me and in the weakest condition that he would ever stand he was making a way that he would pour a strength back on the Church of the Living God and mean that you might have strength in this darkest stage that you would have something and mean that would hold you you would have something that would keep you in the darkest of hours but it would have to come from the supernatural strength of the Lord amen that he would provide a baptism of the Holy Ghost that he would pour out upon the church amen that you would have strength to overcome because we're in a contest amen and brother Brandon would preach a sermon a contest and he said a contest is the test of strength it said those Indians used to take a a rope all right like like a tug of war and and they would build a fire and they would get uh they would get um uh on both sides of the Rope you all you all know how tug of war works and they would build a fire in the middle and whoever would show the greatest strength would win and pull the enemy into the fire now brother br's showing us that there's a contest coming between Satan and the Church of the Living God he said it started in heaven uh Satan was kicked out and now he's trying to use all of his strength to pull God's children into the fires amen and he would be able to do it if we didn't have a greater force but God sent his word that that word and you would be a greater force that you could pull the enemy into the fires that he has created amen that what the enemy meant for evil God could work it together for your good amen and the strength of the word in you would be a greater strength than the strength of the enemy amen and it's not just the strength of a letter for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life when that word comes inside of your heart it brings a supernatural strength amen that'll give you an overcoming life it'll give you an overcoming power but it's got to be the word in you amen it's got to be uh you're fortified in the word of the Living God am mean am mean you train for battle amen learn learn learn how your enemy comes you learn how to counter attack you learn how to fight with the word of God and and with prayer and you learn that your own ability will never win the battle amen have you ever been there you Tred to do it in your own ability but you try fighting God's God's appointed way one time and you realize there's a different force on your side amen we we uh God because the one that won the battle in heaven amen the one that defeated Satan in heaven and cast him down amen but he didn't just cast Satan down into the Earth and leave us here alone but he came down himself amen he came down and put himself inside of a people inside of a bride amen and so the one that's already won the battle in heaven a amen it's a rigged fight amen if you'll just accept that into your heart if you'll just accept the same life that has already defeated Satan that life will never lose amen we have the brother Brandon would say and is anything too hard for the Lord we got the Mighty God for our God oh my David would write who is this king of glory he's the Lord strong and mighty amen he's the Lord Mighty in battle so lift up your heads oh ye gates even lift them up ye Everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory it's the Lord of hosts he is the king of glory amen brother brand say I've never seen him come into battle yet but what he comes out packing the victory amen in the same one that won battles in heaven and me he's winning battles through his church all throughout the ages and now we know that we are have the assurance that this battle we will win amen we're going to win Church the bride is going to win this thing we've already seen the back of the book amen and when the Lord is the strength of your life and when that strength comes into you you have the ability to strengthen others and me you know even how how the Lord would tell Peter after you are converted strengthen your brethren how could he strengthen his Brethren before he had been converted he didn't have anything to strengthen him with but after he went up to to to Pentecost amen he received something that he could strengthen his Brethren amen and and and as Christians we can draw strength from others amen you can draw strength from your father you can draw strength from your mother you can draw strength from your pastor but there's got to come a time in your life where you've got to receive a personal encounter and have a strength in your own life if you're just depending upon pastor's strength you'll get to a valley one time and realize that you don't have what it takes that you don't have the same thing that your pastor has but it's got to be a personal strength that that goes with you all the days of your life that's what David had Amen in in Psalms I it would take about all day to read how many times David talked talks about this but just to just for an example in Psalms 19 he would say oh Lord my strength and my redeemer Psalms 28 the Lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusteed in him and I am helped therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth and with my song will I praise him the Lord is their strength and he is the saving strength of his anointed Psalms 46 God is our refuge and strength a very present help and trouble Psalms 81 sing aloud unto God our strength Psalms 18 the Lord is my strength and song and has become my salvation Psalms 144 blessed be the Lord my strength which teaches teacheth My Hands to War and my fingers to fight do you see a theme here all throughout David's life all throughout David's Ministry he was saying that there was only one source of his strength and that was the Lord the Lord was the strength of his life the Lord was his very present help in the time of trouble and so we realize something that that this bu building is not our strength am mean these pews are not our strength the music is not our strength all the form and all the church order and none of that is our strength but we have one source for our strength and that is the Lord himself the Lord himself is the strength of my life the Lord himself is the strength in My Darkest Hours amen it comes only from the Lord amen it doesn't come I mean the strength of this church isn't just brother Samuel the strength of this church isn't the mum Ians and the song leaders but the strength of this church is the Lord himself amen the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob amen that Pillar of Fire is accompanying this message and as he comes into the services here and me he begins to breathe strength into into the congregation he begins to breathe strength over his children amen but don't mistake it for anything else but the Lord because he alone is the strength of this bride amen it's the Lord God has divided because you see when they were going to send the ark over the the flood in the days of Noah the Ark was made out of gopher wood amen and that gopher wood was a light uh uh very airy wood that that would soak up water very fast and so they would take that gopher wood and they would empty out all the resin out of it that that was in it in its natural condition and as it became emptied out anden if they would to float that over the water it would just soak up the water and it wouldn't stand a chance but that's why they would take the resin or the pitch and put it over that Ark and then it would become after it hardened up it would become as hard as steel anden and and that's the believer's life that you are just a light piece of wood and you can empty yourself out and you can you can be justified and Sanctified but you you're just then in a place that you're you're able to soak up but if you don't fill it with the Lord you you can begin to fill it with all kinds of other things but but if you fill that with the the pitch or the Holy Ghost then it will give you a strength to go over every trial and every test but God and so God has provided for us he knows our condition amen he knows our humanity and he has provided for us a strength that's why he promised us the baptism of the Holy Ghost Amen in Isaiah 28 it spoke that that there would come a rest that there would come a refreshing amen that was stammering lips and other tongues amen that it would it would write about it in the book of Isaiah that he will speak to this people and he said this is the rest wherewith you may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing and he was speaking of the promise that he would pour out the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost is that right amen where 120 empty vessels would come up into the upper room and they would be filled or endued with a power that would send them out where before brother brand would say how before you know they were just a bunch of cowards amen hiding up there in that upper room but when that that when that baptism Came Upon him they sent him out into the streets with the testimony it made them Witnesses of the great power of the Holy Ghost and brother BR talks about how the when the priest would come into his office in the Old Testament he would go behind the veil and partake of that original Mana amen but God has provided a holy ghost that would be a a manner that he would pour out upon his church and it wouldn't just be a mouthful but brother say A Soulful of the original Mana could come back upon your heart and mean that you could draw strength from the Mana of the Holy Ghost amen and if you look at that if you look at that scripture in Isaiah 28 uh before before it speaks of the refreshing in verse 5 it says in that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a Crown of Glory and for a diadem of beauty onto the residue of his people brother brandom says that that he is speaking of the great day when the witness would come he said what is our Crown he said the Holy Spirit crowns us he said a Crown of Glory and a diadem of beauty onto the residue of the people brother BR said the residue is the people that's left over he said he'll be a diadem or a Crown of Glory a diadem of beauty speaking of 700 years before this happened that the Holy Ghost would come but then it says for a spirit of judgment to him that's sitting in judgment and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate and and he says them who is standing for him and with him this great spirit that's prophesied will be the strength of him that stands at the gate Amen in the battle he is our strength amen we rely upon him not upon culture not upon education not upon things of the world not by power not by might but by my spirit sayeth the Lord Brother B said the church rests solemnly in that he will be the strength of him that stands in the gate not his theological background not his denominations but the Holy Ghost will be his strength he will be the one that will stand at the gate he'll rely upon the strength of the Holy Spirit to turn the alien away amen amen it'll be this it'll be uh for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate I mean when you you're in a battle and it's going to take a strength to defeat uh the aliens that's a maybe an odd word but it's spoken of in the Bible even in Hebrews 11 when it's talking about The Heroes of Faith it said they quenched the violence of fire they escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness they were made strong waxed Valiant and fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens we in a battle against some aliens and those aliens are Philistines and a and ammonites and when they encountered these Giants in the land I mean they were aliens they didn't belong they were from they were in their land they were they were foreign they were from another uh they were trespassing am mean on land that belonged to the children of Israel but but out of weakness there would come a strength that they might turn the aliens away and that's going to be the key to the Church of the Living God that out of weakness that a church would be made strong amen God would choose those that are weak God would choose the Beggars God would choose those that the widows and the poor those that those that would be able to empty out of all the strength of religion and all the strength of of Creeds and dogmas and just empty themselves out and say Lord I I'm weak and I'm nothing like Moses and like Samson and like all these great Heroes throughout the Bible say Lord I have no ability and at that time the Lord would say but I have a strength that I will put in your life that will give you overcoming power and if you want to be strong in the Lord it'll have to come through a total death to your own self a total death to your own ideas amen a total death to everything you know about the word like Paul had to empty out everything he learned under his education and his teaching and he had to go spend some time with the pillar of fire on the back side of the desert and recognize that his strength wasn't enough but the but the Revelation from the Lord himself amen would far surpass anything that he could learn amen but but but he wouldn't come in strength and but he would come in weakness amen and deliver to us uh a word amen and Moses would come in weakness and God would use them to lead the children of Israel out out of Egypt amen but God God has given us a strength and and let me just say this amen it is enough hallelujah amen his strength is enough amen I I I think we've all experienced that if you've been serving the lord at any time and you've trusted him you realize that his strength is enough amen Elijah come up against Jezebel religion and systems amen and he was a lonely man amen until the Lord had to remind him that there was there was many others just like him amen but but the Lord would begin to reveal to them that my strength is enough Elijah man you don't have to get it from Jezebel you don't have to get it from Big churches and big numbers but I will be your strength oh my man when brother Brandon was here he went through the Palaces of Oral Roberts and Billy Graham but and he would get discouraged thinking my their Ministries came even off of mine amen but but but he would begin to look up to the Lord and the Lord would tell him but but but I am your portion amen and when the Lord is your portion it's enough amen you don't have to go look into other sources and mean you don't have to go look into other things but when you find your strength in the Lord and you begin to get settled that it is enough it'll bring a stability to your life because you'll stop looking Amen to other places you'll stop looking around and digging around that maybe you've missed something you haven't missed nothing if you've made the Lord your strength he will be with you in The Valleys he'll be with you in the mountains amen and this word is enough amen we don't have to do anything to alter it amen we don't have to look to to Dr dos and and any other voices but God's voice has come down into this age and me and it's and it's captured the attention of a bride that would say that Lord that is enough for me that is enough for my family amen you got to stop depending upon your own strength amen stop depending upon your own abilities amen but cast your cares upon Him and He will care for you and me we need not fight in this battle friends but stand still and see the salvation of the Lord am mean you've been trying to fight it in your own ability and you're losing every time but let go and let God take over amen he's the master of the wind he's the maker of the rain he's still walking among the Church of the Living God God am mean he's in the building this morning because he said he would be and we recognize his presence and we worship the god of our strength and say Lord you are all I need Lord you are enough for me you are everything that I have need of in this journey Lord and you will get me through every trial oh you got to put the blinders on and me and stop looking to the left or right and look to the Lord who will pick you up out of the Waves oh he is the Lord he is the strength of my life amen it's perfect strength through perfect weakness amen and if you feel weak this morning you are a perfect candidate for the Lord to be the strength of your life and lift you up into Realms amen of strength and and anointing oh en courage Hallelujah that's what he would do for all of his great Heroes throughout the Bible they were just men like you and me but the anointing of the Lord made the difference Amen brother Brandon would talk about Samson he said I said Samson was the first sermon that brother brandom ever preached he said cuz he always liked strength but he said I couldn't just imagine Samson being a I couldn't imagine him being a very strong man brother B say I imagine him being kind of frail and kind of weak amen because that way when the Lord would use them for such magnificent things that the glory would go to the Lord amen so there Samson stood frail and weak amen but the but but scripture would tell of great events of strength that would happen in his life and it would write how the spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him and he slew a lion right and he slew 30 Philistines and then one day he would pick up the Jawbone of a mule and slew a thousand Philistines and man can you imagine I'm sure those Philistines had come into contact with many men before and had and had slayed them amen with their Philistine weapons but when they come into contact with the anointing of the Lord they didn't stand a chance and mean a thousand Philistines would fall just like that under the anointing of the Lord that was upon Samson and mean it was because the spirit of the Lord would come upon him it was because Samson let something into his life and me Samson let in a hidden power am me and he let in a hidden power that would be greater than anything he could ever do with his own ability and mean but it was it it it was the Lord I mean it wasn't some magic trick it wasn't it it wasn't brother brand say it's not like rubbing a rabbit's foot it's not like a lucky horseshoe it is it is a hidden power that comes through a birth amen and that's the only way it comes amen that you have to let it in and you have to let in that hidden power and then brother brandom says that that that that just like Samson packing those gates up he said you will pack those Brazen gates to Calvary and it'll make you pray for your brother and your sister and mean it it it'll make your life come into come into line with this word and mean and you won't have to manufacture it you won't have to sweat it out and work it up but when that hidden power comes into your life it'll be just as easy amen sure you'll have hard days but the manifestation of the word will come forth out of your life because it's something that's on the inside working its way outside and me and making a difference in my life like that old Sunday school song it's Jesus on the inside working on the outside it's a hidden power oh that's what gives you the fruits of the spirit that's what gives you love that's what makes you receive the word for your day it's it's the Holy Ghost friends it's a hidden power and that's what Samson had that he would come and come against these Philistines and and carry those Gates of the city but one time there come a a lady there uh or or maybe not a lady but a a woman or or you know not not a good lady her name was Delilah you all know the story that's right amen she would come and begin to ask Samson Samson where does that great strength come from you see brother Brandon warned us of three things especially in the ministry and that was woman money and popularity he said you always got to guard those areas because we have scriptural examples how how um Samson fell because of woman and Saul fell because of popularity and balum fell because of money so you have to guard those areas anden so here comes a woman Delilah in and begins to talk to Samson and say Samson where does thy great strength come from and he would tell her uh if you do such and such and and she would do it and she would say the Philistines be upon the Samson and Samson would break free from the cords and she would say why don't you love me Samson don't tell me where does thy great strength come from and she kept asking them where does it come from and she kept coming and and bugging them and asking them where does thy strength come from and brother brandom compared that to the church ages he said that they would try to bind the Catholic church but he would raise up a Martin Luther that would break the cord then they would try to bind the Lutheran church but he would raise up a John Wesley that would break the cord amen and he would try to they'd get bound again but he'd raise up a pentac costal group that would break the cord but brother brandom said that that those same things would begin to bind the Pentecostal church and and what it reminds me of is it reminds me of those four bugs of death that brother brandom talks about coming in to eat the tree the tree of life and they started to come in and they would eat the leaves and and they would eat the fruits and then they would eat the bark but what were they really trying to get to Brother David they were trying to get to the lifeline of the tree they were trying to get to where the sap belonged because they were trying to get to the heart of the tree that they might kill it anden and and all throughout the ages they would try to come against justification and sanctification and they would realize that that there's there's something deeper than that and and all throughout the and Satan trying to get in and get to that strength anden so that's what Delilah would do to Samson she would start eating away at them and eating away and eating away until eventually Samson would give his heart to Delilah amen he had given his strength to God but he gave his heart to Delilah and Delilah discovered where his great strength laid he said I have been a Nazarite since my birth he said he said uh uh uh he said uh uh there's never come a razor upon my head and I've been a Nazarite to God from my mother's womb and if I be shaven then will my strength go from me and I shall become weak and be like any other man and so Delila called upon the the those men and they come in and shave those Seven Locks during the night and this time when she made the call Samson the Philistines be upon the he tried to get up and break free from those cords but he couldn't break free and and he wish not that the Lord had departed from him amen he he he no longer had the strength to meet the challenge of the hour amen but but but but when he stood up that time amen there was something that he couldn't break free from those bands because the Lord had Departed from him when he broke that Nazarite vow and mean he still had all of his natural muscles his framework was still the same but when the Lord departed he couldn't meet the challenge of the hour and me brother Brandon would speak about the they're building bigger churches and and they're getting bigger numbers and they're getting better dressed preachers and and with with curly hair and stand up there and and and be so elegant and so pretty amen but the Lord had departed from them and their strength had gone from them amen when they broke that vow with the Lord amen because you see something um brother Aaron amen you could stand up here this morning with all the muscles that you have am me and and you do Sports so you probably have to train and you probably build quite a bit a good strong muscle amen but if there was no life in your body amen you just stand up here at just a pile of bones and muscle and you wouldn't be able to lift nothing you couldn't lift an ant if there was no life in you to motivate that muscle am mean and so that's how it is in the spiritual and mean if you you can have all the numbers and you can have all the pews and you can have all the the million dooll buildings and beautiful things but if there's no Spirit there to motivate it and mean it's just a dead church amen it's just a dead Creed or or or Dogma amen and Samson here realizing that his strength wasn't enough to do it he's here realizing that the strength that he has Isn't Enough enough amen he begin to realize that just knowing all the quotes wasn't enough Samson begins to come into a condition of weakness and begins to realize that that just sitting in a message Pew isn't enough amen and but he realized something and that the mechanics wouldn't be enough but it would take a Dynamics to come upon the mechanics amen amen that it wouldn't just be enough to have the the mechanics but he would have to have the Dynamics amen is that right right this morning that that's what the church needed and all of its mechanics but we needed the Dynamics to come upon the church to make it live Amen to make that car start and take us where we needed to go amen it's going to take the word and the spirit and mean and and neither is it just enough to have the Dynamics me but brother Bron would say if I could ever get the fundamentalists and the Pentecostals together and mean because the fundamentalists know who they are and the Pentecostals have this great faith but if I could ever get him together amen look what look what God could do amen but he'll get them together in a bride amen she'll be both mechanics and Dynamics amen she'll have the word and spirit amen just like that shunamite woman when she come into contact with the Elijah Ministry she was in great disarray but when Elijah come into contact and she took care of Elijah anden God so blessed her that the cruci of oil would never run out in the barrel of meal would never run dry but she would have a word and spirit diet that would keep her all the way until the rain fell again upon the Earth and God has given this bride a word and a Spirit Revival and me it's spiritual food and due season it'll keep you until the Rapture and mean it'll give you what you have need of to get out of here if you'll just feed on the diet of the word of God and the spirit of God for you see God is a spirit amen but in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God anden you see God isn't just a dead letter but the Holy Ghost is the spirit of the word and when the spirit of the word comes into your life oh it won't just be it won't just be an empty anointing it won't just be an empty power but it'll be an anointing that will line you up with every word of this Bible it'll bring to pass the manifestation of sons that the world is GR moaning for Amen brother Aaron it'll fulfill exactly what's been prophesied over this bride but but the church rejected it and mean the church refused it and I can only imagine that this is the first time that Samson has ever felt fear I can only imagine that all of his life that Nazarite vow had been hanging over him brother Brian but here he comes into condition and I can imagine it's probably the first time he he's ever felt what it's like to be afraid the first time he he's ever felt what it's like Amen to suffer defeat and and not know and fear for the future and fear that the Lord was no longer on his side because he had forsaken his vow with the Lord you see his long hair was a Nazarite vow it was a sign of consecration brother B said long hair is a Nazarite vow it shows that you've cut yourself from the world to obey the word he would say long hair was a Nazarite vow of Samson but he would also say that a hair to a woman is a Nazarite vow just like the hair was to Samson and when a woman cuts off her hair she denies or Nazarite vow that she is a bride to Christ brother BR said a Nazarite is one that is consecrated for a purpose and Samson was consecrated to an age and a purpose so he had long hair and the woman that that's a child of God lets her hair grow to show that she's consecrated to every word of God brother BR said if she cuts it off I don't care how much she dances or sings in the choir or speaks in tongues or runs up and down or has all kind of Aid societies brother Brandon said she is dead that's thus saith the Lord the word of God 1 Corinthians 14 she denied her Nazarite vow and sold out to the God of this Modern Age and mean we see how brother would begin even to speak that that Pentecostal group was getting bound up with the same thing and me thinking that just because they spoke in tongues it was enough amen but there was nothing in them and they begin to chop off their hair they begin to put on garments that pertain to a man and they begin to shave off their Nazarite vow and me and me thinking that that it would that that that just because that maybe they did a certain thing that it was enough but but they only accepted part of the word but they rejected a message that would bring them to an adoption amen they rejected the adoption they rejected the word that would place them positionally in their land and and they refused it when it came oh my and they begin to brother brand would say committing spiritual fornications he said any word in the Bible That's rejected or if any self-interpretation is put to it it's absolutely rejecting and committing adultery against the god that is your husband amen Amen brother brother brother Brandon would begin to show us am mean that there is a bride and she is vowed to Christ and he said uh he said a woman shouldn't even wink at another man he said she shouldn't show any emotions towards another man and mean she shouldn't even wink because you know what the problem is it starts with a wink and then all of a sudden it it goes to a little text message it begins to escalate a little farther and and you find out that you're in a position that you that you ever thought you would be in me but it started with a wink and mean and now we're talking about spiritually now sometimes it starts with just a wink amen with with a false Doctrine or a false Spirit am me you just you just you just look at a website say I just want to see what this is all about and me I I don't believe it but I just want to know what it's all about and all of a sudden you begin to think oh I wonder I wonder I wonder if that fining boy ever did raise I wonder if that bridge ever did fall and you realize that the Lord has departed from you and you no longer have the strength that you once had and may because you begin to to to to wink at that that spirit and you find yourself in the lap of Satan amen and you no longer have your strength am me because you forsaken your Nazarite vow and you begin to shave away this word and shave away that word and shave away this quote and shave away this scripture and you begin to realize Lord where have you gone and that's where the denominations found themselves when brother Brandon was here he would begin to call out an indictment against them and say eobot is written on the door the presence of the Lord has to parted and me because you begin to shave off Luther's words and shave off Wesley's words and now you stand as a Shor as a Shor sister he would say a me where God gave you the word to be your strength but you begin to shave off this lock and shave off that lock and you stand without strength and me and he would begin to even rebuke the Pentecostals and even his own Tabernacle he would say brandom Tabernacle worldism is creeping in he said have you gave up your secret that you once had when you were wallowing in the sawdust and now the discernment of hearts are taking place and you sit there and you think my that's that's pretty good that's all right that and you sit there and he would begin to rebuke them and say worldly ism is creeping in amen and and your strength is departing from you amen but he would begin to speak about letter be free amen if she has the spirit let her alone amen and God has called us to a freedom in this message amen he's called us out of the chains of denominationalism and I say let her stay free amen let this bride stay free amen amen amen just because you sit in the message Pew that's not where your freedom lays but your freedom lays in the message himself which is Christ that the Lord has descended in this last hour in the strength has descended back into the church and I say let her stay free amen if we have to Worship in ten Pan Alley let us stay free and mean if our young people have to boohoo and snot all over the altar to get an experience with the Living God then I say let us stay free oh my if a move of God ever becomes a bad thing around this message we'll go out into the Wilderness amen we'll cry out with the rocks and the trees but we will not give up our strength to any spirit any devil we will not give up our anointing we will not give up anything that this Prophet taught oh my if it becomes a shameful thing to quote this Prophet then I'll go out into the Wilderness and I'll live on the riverbank but I will not forsake the strength of my life amen because when you find yourself in a trial you don't want to realize that your strength has departed and your Nazarite vow has been broken oh but I tell you when I find myself in a trial I want to know that the Lord is the strength of my life I want to know that the anointing of the Lord is able to rescue me because I know I don't have enough strength in myself oh oh brother Brandon would begin to even cry out hurt not the oil and the wine touch not my anointed don't you touch that oil of the Holy Ghost don't you touch that stimulation of Revelation oh don't touch my children don't touch my free bride oh we've got the oil brother and sister and we've got the wine and we're free in the Holy Ghost oh don't shave off one lock if you just stay with the message and me it'll keep you in the hour of trouble am mean this message is the strength of my life am mean this message is what will get us in a Rapture oh God's not looking for separators or God's not looking for mixers God's looking for separators you see a Nazarite is one that's consecrated for a purpose am me and if you don't devote yourself for if you don't devote yourself to something I mean what are you going to do are you just going to go around like a piece of Driftwood and think one day this is right and the next day this is right amen but God's got a Nazarite bride Amen in this bright age he's got a Nazarite bride that is consecrated to an age and a purpose and me we're consecrated to this age and we're consecrated to the purpose amen you are a separated people you are not like the denominations I hope they don't offend anybody but you're different and mean you are not the same we are not the same as the Methodist we are not the same as the Lutheran we are a called out people we are a separated people holy onto the Lord Brother Brandon would say come out from among them and be ye separate touch not their unclean thing we've been called out from that mess to a freedom and a liberty oh oh I'm so thankful that brother brandom came on the scene and told the truth and man he would say he would say brother BR even talking about cutting their hair he would say maybe sometimes M ministers hasn't got nerve enough to tell you he said this is one time you're going to hear it oh and he would begin to cry out against that Jezebel system he would begin to cry out against makeup and cry out against all these things and mean and I believe we still need man and to tell the truth I believe we still need people that'll stand up for the truth and mean I believe we can still call black black and white white and me I believe our young man can still dress like young man I believe our young sisters can still dress like young sisters and me we're not here to mix with this world we're not here to give into the peer pressures amen I I I know it's a lot of pressure amen for our young people to go into the schools and things but God has given us a spirit to withstand the pressures of the age and stand there as a witness if you're the only one stand stand alone for the message of the hour stand for the word of God stand for the spirit of God Amen don't bow down now amen don't give into the pressures now am mean we're just now close to home this is the time to stand like never before Oh and there's more for you than there is against you brother Shane if you'll stand for the Lord he'll stand for you and there'll be more for you than anything that comes against you and me in the hour of trouble you'll realize that there's a host of angels encamped round about you to see you through to Victory oh he's the god he's the god that we serve oh but the problem is brother man say let they let down the bars they let down the bars they compromis with sin let down the bars the Sheep got out but how did the goats get in he would say they let down the bars they begin to compromise just a little word here and a little word there and they realize that their that their pasture is full of goats oh and the sheep have gotten out and they might have a bigger congregation but it's a Congregation of goats and not of sheep oh they let down the bars you know I've got a little boy and and he's 14 months old so if any of you have had children you know what that's like and and he is getting into everything Oh my he gets into a c i mean you can't turn your head Harley and he's doing something getting into the cabinets and the cabinets out the cabinets is a big one because we don't have them locked so we probably should just lock them but we don't have them locked so every time he tries to get into them we have to get on to them and so we say you can't do that buddy and we'll go and we'll maybe give him a little SWAT and then he'll he they don't do nothing I mean you you don't want to hit him that hard but he just don't care he so he goes right back to there and after about the 50th time it would be easy to give up and just say okay buddy whatever you have rule of this home you you have rule of this place you you get into the cabinets go ahead and stick something in the outlet I don't care mean but what type of home would that produce mean if you just gave up and compromised and let him have rule over the home and and and what type of home will it produce if you start letting down the bars and letting a little bit of of this creep in and a little bit of that creep in am me and you don't want to take a stand against it amen because it takes effort and it takes it takes it takes sometimes a little bit of uncomfortableness Amen to stand up against something amen but but but sometimes you get to the place like Samson where you say just once more Lord I want my strength back I want my home back I want my family back I want my wife back I'm tired of this devil having full rain over my home but Lord forgive me for I've compromised forgive me Lord for I let down the bars but Lord restore unto me the strength that I once had hallelujah amen amen it would behoove us to not forsake the strength of our life am me if a man forsakes to walk in the sunlight he'll get weak and it shows that there's something mentally wrong with him when a man would go hide himself down in a cellar and refuse to walk in the sunlight that would give him strength and before long he'll become anemic he'll become weak and and and because he forsook it and brother random would say that you know if we forsake to walk in the light of the Lord if we forsake to walk in God's sunlight if we forsake the Holy Spirit if we forsake our prayer life amen you start to realize that you're getting weak amen but but we shouldn't refuse is the Lord that is our strength and and when Samson before we move on the thing about Samson amen Samson had had had forsaken his vow amen he say why are we so strong you talk about cutting your hair you talk about makeup why is it so strong because we're under a Nazarite vow amen and when Moses was Vindicated by the pillar of fire and mean shortly after he would begin to write don't you add one word or take one word from that which I have spoken unto you amen and there would come brother brandom Vindicated by a pillar of fire and he would say so say unto you don't you add one word don't you take from word you just say what's set on those tapes oh that's why we're under Nazarite vow I mean if you shave one word you'll find yourself in trouble I mean you I'd say this you don't even have to break out the scissors you can leave them in the ch for because when God gave us this message it was a perfect message amen amen legalism was already shaved off of this message I mean fanaticism was already shaved off of this message I mean and as Ministers of the Living Word of God and mean it's not my job to try to make it right it's already perfect it's only our job to give it to God's children in the purity of the word that the strength of it might come into their lives and produce an overcoming and amen but the but the but the hope that we have brother Brandon would begin to say is that while Samson was in that condition a new shock begin to grow backen and those Seven Locks amen begin to come back upon his head amen and brother Brandon would say now notice at the opening of The Seven Seals Revelations 10 the full word is to be born into manifestation again and Vindicated by the spirit of God in the full strength as it was when he was here on Earth manifested in the same way doing the same things that it did when he it was here on Earth amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever oh I will restore saith the Lord amen amen it can look pretty dark but God has restored the strength to his bride amen he will have a bride that will stand in strength in honor and glory and she will not refuse the leadership of the Holy Ghost but you see those children of Israel got to a place one time where they looked out at that Philistine Army and they seen Kings leading them into battle and they thought my wouldn't it be nice to have a king like that to lead us into battle wouldn't it be nice and you see God was going to give him that and the man Christ Jesus but they begin to go ahead of the word and they think we want somebody like that to lead us into battle and Samuel Samuel's heart begin to break and they would say Samuel you've always been faithful you've always been good to us it's nothing against you it's just that we want a king to lead us into battle and Samuel was a prophet with the word of God but they begin to desire natural leadership to lead him in battle they said we still want the priest blowing the horns we still want we still want all of the order and all of the all of the form it's just that we want a natural leadership and when they begin to push out the leadership of the Holy Ghost for the natural leadership and mean it was just like Samson cutting off his hair and mean because Samson without that hair was just like any other man and this church was just without that leadership of the Holy Ghost was was just another church it's just like the world with God's name attached to it and so so there in this condition they begin to reject the king of Israel and begin to accept Saul as their King and so it's significant to me when David writes this the Lord is the strength of my life because as we begin to place ourselves in the picture that David was in amen Saul begins to become Anointed The King over Israel and in 1st Samuel 15 it's written of the the the story and so Samuel is sent to anoint Saul King over Israel and when Saul begins to rise to this position and Samuel comes in to anoint him and he he begins to say hearken onto the voice of the words of the Lord and Samuel begins to command them to go and smite amalec amen and destroy everything and spare them not and so Saul gathers the Army and lays in weight and and he begins to begins to get things in order for battle and begins to dismiss the kenites that were in the land because he didn't want them to get caught up in it amen because they uh from what I understand they had been good to Israel and so he he began to dismiss them and and and he lays in weit and when the amalekites come in the army of Saul begins to rise up and smite the amalekites amen and and they took King AAG alive in the best of the animals amen and and and when he did this the Lord repented that he had ever made Saul King because he didn't perform the Commandments of the Lord that the Lord had given him and it Grieves Samuel and Samuel came to Saul and man and just paraphrasing this it's powerful if you want to go read it but but Samuel begins to come to Saul and Saul says I have performed the Lord's commandment but then Samuel begins to say then then why can I hear sheep bleeding and why can I hear ox and lo if you perform my commandment then what is the sound and and Saul would begin Saul you see Saul would begin to explain that they kept him for sacrifice but you're all familiar with the scripture how obedience is better than sacrifice and that comes out of this this text here because Saul was supposed to kill everything and it would have been better if he would have just obeyed the Lord than to take to take him for sacrifices it would have been better if he would have killed King AAG than to keep him and to keep the animals for sacrifice and and so Samuel begins to tell him I will tell you what the Lord has said and he says when thou was little in thine own sight in verse 17 was thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel and the Lord anointed thee King over Israel and he says sa when you were little in your own sight you were exalted and mean but you see as we said before Saul fell because of popularity and he began to listen to the voice of the people instead of the voice of the Lord amen and he finds himself in a condition amen where the Lord you see uh we are just because the Lord has chosen us that's where our strength comes from but I'm aware that if the Lord would ever take his hand off of my life brother Dave I'm just like 84 cents of dust and C I have no good thing I brought nothing into this world and I'll take nothing out of this world brother Brandon said he would even see people have an experience with the Holy Ghost and get out on the field and totally deny it because of popularity amen amen but but we are not that big amen if you get to thinking you are big enough to have your own Ministry or have your own position amen you you got to come back and realize amen that you're that the only reason that you've been exalted to this position is the Lord anden and it's the Lord only that's the only good thing about me is the Lord it it's his election in my life amen and so Saul Samuel comes to Saul and says you know why didn't you obey and and and he Samuel begins to lay the news on to him in verse 23 he says because thou Hast rejected the L word of the Lord he H has also rejected Ed thee from being King and and and and and so Samuel said unto Saul Saul said I pray thee pardon my sin and turn again with me that I may Worship the Lord in verse 26 it says Samuel said unto Saul I will not return unto thee for thou Hast rejected the word of the Lord and the Lord hath rejected thee from being King over Israel and Samuel turned to go away and he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle and it ran and Samuel said unto him the Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day and has given it unto a neighbor of thine that is better than thou and me you see now how David writes this the Lord is the strength of my life we're seeing a transfer now amen from the from from Saul to David Amen in in verse 29 it said and also the strength of Israel will not lie nor repent for he is not a man that he should repent amen and there on that scene Saul uh had forsaken the Lord and Samuel took his sword and Samuel come up to King AAG and in the presence of the Lord he slayed King AAG and he said because your sword has made mothers childless I will make your mother childless and he slew King AAG in the presence of the Lord I mean that may sound pretty strong but it was the obedience to the word of the Lord that's what Saul should have done in the first place amen amen but Samuel was obedient to the the Lord and here comes David on the scene and in Psalms 52 it it's a Psalm of David talking about when doag the Edomite came and told Saul and so and so in verse 7 it says lo this is the man that made not God of strength but trusted in the abundance of his riches and strengthened himself in his wickedness but I am like a green olive tree in the house of God oh I trust in the mercy of God forever ever and ever you see David was a man of Small Beginnings as well and me David was taken from the Sheep coat and made a a shepherd and a sheep coat to the king uh uh to a king in Israel you see David was a man of Small Beginnings but the difference was David didn't forget where his strength came from and me and I'm trying to draw a picture here David did not forget in the in his mistakes and his failures that his strength came from the Lord amen but his strength was the strength of Israel and mean in the book of Isaiah it would talk about how some TR about the strength of pharaoh and some trust in the shadows of Egypt amen but but it said therefore shall the strength of pharaoh be your shame in the Trust In the shadow of Egypt your confusion but David would write some trust in chariots and some trust in horses but but but we will not forget the name of the but we will remember the name name of the Lord Our God Amen do you see David's attitude some trust in the strength of pharaoh some trust in chariots and some trust in horses amen and some trust in Psychology oh and some trust in big churches and some trust and education but we will not forget the name of the Lord Our God oh my we will not forget where our strength comes from and in verse 29 it talked about the strength of Israel will not lie and it will not repent and me and that word strength is the only time in the Bible that it's capital S because that speaks to me that it is not speaking of the strength of Egypt it is not speaking of the strength of pharaoh but the reason it would be a capital S is because the strength of Israel is the Lord himself and mean it speaks to me that there is a deity that followed along and led the children of Israel and that was the strength of David's life that when he would write the Lord is the strength of my life he was speaking of a capital S the Lord himself is the strength of my life and it's the Jesus Christ that's the same yesterday today and forever oh it's the same strength that led the children of Israel out of Egypt it's the same strength brother and sister that Caleb could say I'm just as strong now as the day Moses called me it's the same strength that would lead Joshua through the Red Sea it's the same strength that would be with Moses and Joshua and Rahab and all the all the all the heroes throughout the Bible it was the strength of Israel that was with them in the Lion's Den that was with them in the Red Sea but oh I'm so thankful that Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new Amen in the strength of Israel crossed over into the Gentile dispensation and it's the same strength friends that came down in the upper room and filled 120 vessels it's the same strength that came into the meetings with brother random and said I take every spirit in here under my control and me we have been given a word of strength we have been given a word of anointing and it's under that word of strength that they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover in my name they shall cast out Devils amen casting out Devils doesn't just have to be a great event at the front of the church but while the word Goes Forth it has enough strength to Cast Away the spirits that are haunting your life and me this message still has enough strength to to to bind the spirits of confusion that would torment your mind oh it's the word of strength that would Cast Away spirits of anxiety that would Cast Away spirits of depression that would begin to reveal to you who you are and mean it's the strength of Israel that's the strength that's accompanying this bride oh it's the strength of my life it's the strength and his strong hand still reaches down his strong hand is still here in this meeting it still reaches down the same strength that plucked you up out of the Dust of this Earth that same strength canand your broken body that same strength is the strength that heals you the strength the same strength that called you is the same strength that keeps you for the Holy Ghost isn't just ownership young people the Holy Ghost isn't just ownership but it's keeping power and the same strength that called you it'll keep you when the Holy Ghost becomes the strength of your life he didn't just call you to lose you he called you to keep you amen and it's the strength that comes in the midst of Trials you see when brother brandom stood there and his wife lay and his baby laid in that morg and the devil came to him and said you you serve God and this is what he does you mean you're going to tell me you're going to serve him night and day and he'll lift up a blanket and reject your prayer and brother Brandon was left standing between two opinions and he would say he would say he was in a place between two opinions but he was lay his hands upon that baby and say the Lord gives and the Lord takes away and blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah he didn't forget where his strength came from but he would say the lord gave is and takes and he said I felt relief oh my that means something to me because you know what the devil will come and try to whisper in your ear that if you just give up all of this and just go out into the world that you'll have relief but I'm here to tell you it is a Lie from the pits of hell and but when brother brandom took sides with Jesus he said I felt relief and the best way to get relief in your trial is just to take sides with Jesus and say Lord you give and you take away but Blessed Be the name of the Lord Lord I remember you're the strength I remember that you brought me out before and you'll bring me out again and like job could say the Lord gives and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord he didn't question God he just praised them and say Lord I trust you oh my my wife stood there in our youth camp the other day and if you're not familiar with her situation it was a the the devil was a attacking her with with seizures I mean it was non-epileptic but he was attacking her with seizures and she stood there in that camp and in the middle of seizure sometimes we'd have to carry her out and let her come out of it and get some strength back but there she stood ready to go in the prayer line and she stood there with strength and she stood there with with a with a something in her heart that said if I could just get in that prayer line and in the middle of Caesar I would watch her and and she would just lift her hands to the the Lord and begin to praise the Lord and mean in the middle of it she would just begin to confess and praise the Lord am mean and she gotten that anointing amen and things she had been carrying were broken off of her in an instant in the presence of the Lord amen but I'm telling you there's a time in the middle of a valley oh where the best thing you can do is say the Lord gives and takes away but blessed be the name of the Lord and me I may be in a valley but he's still God he's still worthy of my praise he's still worthy of our worship amen what are you going to do in the middle of your trial I think I'll throw up my hands and start praising the Lord amen I may be in a valley but I haven't lost my praise I may be in the middle of the darkest time of my life but I tell you the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob has not departed from me but the anointing of the Lord is in the building right now to set his children free you don't have to stay where you're at you don't have to stay in that prison anymore oh you may be down but I haven't lost my praise oh Satan you can't have my worship you can't have my praise you can't have my joy oh you say I'm in a battle brother Isaac but let the joy of the Lord begin to swirl through this building and the joy of the Lord is your strength and just all of a sudden you came in here dragging your feet but in the moment you say oh my it's the joy of the Lord and it's restoring unto me oh I've just begin to fight I've just begun to fight oh where is that Philistine where is that Goliath am mean where is that cancer where is that depression where is that anxiety you are defeated because God has come on the scene and shed of blood oh he's poured out a spirit of anointing that has set a bride free and he which the son has made free is free indeed so we're not going to look at the obstacles if you're looking at the obstacles you're looking at the wrong thing but brother Brandon would say we get Joy by looking at the word and so if you stopped looking at the word and started looking at the obstacle that might be why you lost your joy but look back to the promise and by his stripes you are already healed so why don't you praise him like you're already healed why don't you worship him like you're already delivered because it's just as sure to happen as the word of the Lord because his word cannot fail oh he said I'll be in ever presentent help in the time of trouble I'll be the Lily in your Valley I'll be the Opium I'll be the rose of Sharon I will not leave you nor forsake you oh you say Lord I'm afraid I made a mistake Lord I'm afraid that you're going to forsake me but oh David would write lord I can't even escape from your presence whether shall I go if I Ascend up into heaven you're there if I make my bed in hell you're there oh Hallelujah I'm talking about an everpresent God Amen Saul was rejected but David as a man after God's Own Heart would write surely goodness and mercy follow me all the days of my life and God would begin to speak to David that he would bring forth the temple through his son Solomon and he wouldn't forsake Him like he did Saul it's said I will not take my mercies from I will not take my mercies from them like I did Saul oh he said I will not forsake you oh Children of the Living God you are not a Saul you are a David and in the Valley of the shadow of death his mercies have never forsaken you he's an never presentent help in the time of trouble Hallelujah he's the god of the valley we have the Mighty God for our God we worship the mighty God we worship the strength of Israel oh oh do you feel it do you feel it do you feel the presence of the Lord and then in his presence you have a right to confess the word over the situation and let the weak say I am strong let the poor say I am rich Hallelujah stop confessing your problem and start confessing the word oh let the weak say I am strong let it come out of your own lips I am strong I am strong I am free I am delivered I've got my joy back I've got my peace back I've got my children back I don't even see them yet but I've got my children back Hallelujah they belong to you go ahead and claim your children go ahead and speak for your children go ahead and speak for your loved ones I'm telling you that there is a strong arm that is able to reach out to them and pull them back into the fold of the Living God he will not lose a one of his hallelujah oh if you're oh we are in the palm of his hand and Satan can't pluck us from the palm of the hand of the strength of Israel Hallelujah said I will not lose a one of mine oh glory to God I believe right now you can go ahead and thank him for the Holy Ghost you can go ahead and praise him you can go ahead and worship Him amen he has spoken it he will perform it oh he is the strength Giver Hallelujah let the weak say I am strong let the poor say I am rich let the bound say I am free amen because the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass sometimes you just have to adjust your attitude that's right you're taking the wrong attitude you're taking the attitude of what you're seeing with your natural eyes but change your attitude to what you see through the eyes of faith and let your attitude adjust to the word and when you get the right mental attitude it will bring to pass every promise in this Bible amen amen friends it's time you step into your position as a son or daughter of God you don't have to keep giving in to that same devil and mean when you are a son or daughter of God I mean brother Benjamin stand in your position and don't waver to the left or right but look in the eyes of that devil and say you are [Music] defeated oh but we are oh we are going on to Glory nothing can separate us from the love of God we have the good news of the Gospel this morning our names were written on the land book of life before the foundation of the world he's predestinated us he's called us he's Justified us and we're already glorified Hallelujah there's already a place in glory for me and in one of these days anden we will return back to the joys of the Lord for a whole Millennial Reign and we'll hear those beautiful words well done good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the Lord hallelujah enter into the joys of the Lord but you don't have to wait till then there's a restoration of Joy coming throughout this building right now there's a restoration of Peace in this building right now you don't have to wait till the Millennium to get your joy back he is here to restore Joy he is here to restore peace he is here to refill you with the Holy Ghost he is here here to give you the desire of your heart oh break out your slingshot and say Satan I'm coming after my sheep I'm coming after you you see brother brandom had a dream one time and there was a man and a woman that was supposed to be kind of like his mother and father although it wasn't and that man had a I forget exactly what it was it was a three a three edge of Club type of thing right and brother brand said he he this this man kept beating this woman up with this club and going around real boastful proud every time she try to get up he would beat her down and brother brandom said he he knew it wasn't right but he didn't want to he didn't want to approach it at first because he he felt like he couldn't take on this man he felt like he was too big and so brother brandom didn't approach it at first but finally he stood up to the man and said don't touch her don't you dare touch her oh and as he did he said my muscles begin to grow like a giant and then he begin to say don't touch or you have to deal with me and he said he begin to stand and all of a sudden his faith muscles begin to rise up like a giant amen and he begin to show us that that that that was a type of the church and a type of the denomination ational husband and mean beating her with that Trinity Doctrine and things and me and mean and what would have happened if brother Brandon wouldn't have stood up to that thing man what would have happened we'd probably all be here baptizing the Trinity this morning amen but he took a stand against that Trinity Doctrine the Lord and when he did it he realized he had greater strength than he thought he did amen and I say what would happen if we didn't take a stand against these things it it may get uncomfortable but what would happen if we stopped preaching against these things what would happen if we let down the bars and then all a sudden you're too scared to approach it but what would happen if you do take a stand and then all a sudden you realize okay I'm a lot bigger than this thing I'm a lot stronger than this thing amen it's a Time friends it's a time to lift up your heads straighten out your chest use Faith use Faith you're the Bride of Jesus Christ be strong in the Lord and the power of His might it's not your strength it's the strength of the lord it's the power of His might so be strong it's a time to be strong it's a time to be strong amen maybe you've maybe you've come to a place in your own life you've been scared to take a stand against it because you you think it's stronger than you you've been scared you're scared to approach it you sometimes wonder if you have the Holy Ghost or not but you're scared to take a stand against it because you don't you're worried maybe and you're you're you're worried you think it's bigger than you you're scared to take a stand against that depression against that anxiety that is so good you're scared to take a stand against that that lustful spirit because you think it's bigger than you amen but just one time say Lord I want my strength back I want my strength back and if you got your strength I want to keep my strength and so I'm going to stand up against this thing amen amen as the musicians come hallelujah amen maybe we could close our eyes and bow our heads [Music] amen me the Lord's been moving in this Hallelujah and I believe the Lord's been dealing with hearts already amen but you see the challenge of the hour now is the rapture of the church and intellectual strength will never do it amen and denominational strength will never put you in it but but God revealed himself to Abraham at 99 years old just before the change as elshad ey that he could draw strength from elhi and and though he was weak in his body and Sarah's womb was as good as dead he could draw strength back for a change praise God Amen maybe this morning you find yourself you've been living in a you've been living Liv in a a bondage and you've been too scared to deal with it man but this morning why don't you just take a stand against it Lord am man if you've been needing the Assurance of the Holy Ghost in your life you don't got to stop running from that thing I'm a witness that the God that I serve can answer that question amen you've got a spirit that's been plaguing your mind why don't you just come take a stand against that thing and and you realize oh those Faith muscles begin to come upon you and you say I've been living in fear this whole time and all the time I was a lot bigger than this thing because the strength of the Lord amen I don't believe there's an enemy in this room this morning that's stronger than the Lord amen amen father Lord we come before you this morning Lord we reverence your name you are the Mighty God lord we feel your strength in the building this morning Lord father as
