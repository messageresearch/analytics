your midweek service as as always it's always a blessing to come we have a special extra reason to be coming these days of course they don't have anything to do with gracie but we're certainly we're certainly glad that y'all's taking such good care of it up here we appreciate you much for that and you man we always love you all and brother samuel as well and so it just makes it extra special to us now to be able to come and we want to say god bless you and greetings to you all from brother erickson the church there true word and so we just want to take a few minutes this evening and the word just before we do could we just bow our hearts in a word of prayer and we just want to speak to him just for a moment if you have a special need on your heart let's just reach out to him father we have enjoyed a wonderful song service here this evening lord your presence has been made known among us and the singing and the worship lord we've just come to you tonight we offer ourselves to you we ask you that you would bless this lord may you bless it with your presence may you sanction it may you just step into the room lord may you have your way in this meeting we thank you for this place that's been set aside for your children lord a place for the word of god we ask you now that may you lead us lord and you give us the words lord of encouragement and strength for this body of believers father we commit this meeting into your hands and we ask you lord you do wonderful things among us and we'll truly give you all the glory in the name of jesus we pray amen and amen and god bless you tonight if you if you have some bible your bible with you we'd like to look in the book of revelations and i want to read here from revelations the first chapter and i have a couple of scriptures here revelation chapter one and verse three revelation chapter 1 and verse 3. revelation 1 and 3 for blessed is he that readeth and he that hear the words of this prophecy and keep these things which are written therein for the time is at hand now i want to read you something brother brahm said about this it's a revelation the book is to the servants of god for this last time when the time is at hand when this book will be revealed over in the book we find that the book was closed and shut and sealed until the end time so when he says for the times at hand he's not speaking about for that day that it's being written he's talking about the day that it's going to be revealed let's also go into revelations uh the 22nd chapter let's go in the 10th verse revelation 2 and we can include the ninth verse of the the eighth verse down to the tenth here sorry and now john saw these things and heard and when i'd heard and seen i fell down in worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things and then he saith unto me seal thou see thou do it not for i am the fellow servant of thy brother and the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship god so at the same time that people would be inclined to worship an angel prophet of god when they would be inclined to worship that that that specific angel would say don't do it but then what's the next thing and he sayeth unto me seal not the sayings of this prophecy of this book for the time is at hand now it's amazing because in revelations 10 john is told by the by the thundering angel seal it up until the seventh angel sounds when he shall begin the sound the mystery will be made clear and then now here in revelations 22 you're seeing him meet this same he's he's john's meeting the bride is meeting an angel that he is inclined to worship but says don't worship me but it is a time to unseal the book it's a it's a time that is at hand amen we ask the lord bless his word tonight and i do want to speak to you tonight just a little bit as you be seated i want to speak to you on uh the time time is at hand the time is at hand we want to maybe speak to you a little bit tonight concerning this matter there's some things that we that we recognize and that we're living in some very very uh very unprecedented times some some crazy times as we could say you know it's a it's a time crazy things are going on everywhere and we we want to say that we we can see certainly that it's a time to um a time to appreciate the uh of course that the darkness always makes us appreciate the light and and the bad makes us appreciate the good amen and and so we want to say that and you know just in just in getting started here i do i do say that i i certainly appreciate your pastor here brother samuel for the stand that he takes on this message and it's always been a blessing to come here and minister and as i said it's a little more special now but i think maybe this is one of the first times i've heard brian uh go through an entire service a song leading uh i'm impressed i i've just been honest i i liked him already it's a sun involved i'm impressed amen spiritually he's a he's a real blessing amen god bless you brother simon you got him trained well amen so we we we appreciate him as a son-in-law he's been a great a great a part of our family and and he married my my daughter and of course gracie's a special one took to me so you know how dads are you know and so um we definitely favor her and and think uh she's the best of the best so hey man y'all be okay with me if i'll say that because to to me there's no better a man so but we we certainly love her so it just gives us a little special uh a feeling to come and and even in such uh times like this i think of of the darkness of this hour and the times that we're that we're visiting you um i i think that it's sometimes it does us uh how could i say this it does us good to reach back and begin to look at some of the things that are principled truths things that was laid out and things that are are certain to us and sometimes we need to revisit those things and remember uh the times and the seasons and what we're doing here and what the situations are and i thought it was amazing how that brother branham will actually say he says see if we could just go into it right now he said look when the time is at hand when the revelation of jesus christ is being revealed to the body of christ and christ has been revealed not dead but alive living in his church doing this same things that he did then the same ministry the same gospel the same signs the resurrected christ when he's revealed by his angel into the church then the time is at hand when he is revealed by his angel in the church then the time is at hand and never a time since the day until this day has the mystery of jesus christ ever been revealed until these last days for them the time is at hand amen i i think it's a powerful thing to realize that the book of revelations is something that was written not for that day but written for this day and that it's always amazed me that god wrote it in a symbol form so that the bride would have a book in the bible that was written to her that other people was going to read it but they're not going to understand it because it's a personal letter from christ to his bride and it would take a prophet or an angel to unseal that book to the church and when he does it then he would say then is the time at hand when the revelation comes now again and three kinds of believers brother bran will say it like this but you can see also the raptured church making himself ready it's a great scene you can see the presence of god vindicating making the great drama it's foretold here in the bible to act itself out what a time to live the most glorious time the man of all the ages has longed for this time the prophets of old long to see this hour but wasn't privileged and and and i thought i think of this and i think you know uh sometimes somebody will tell you oh my you should have been there you know or you should have seen this what a what a wonderful time and and you know sometimes you hear people say that and you think well it maybe didn't have to be that good to impress the person because you know some people don't read situations well but when you think about brother branham when you take a prophet like this and he tells you that this is the greatest of all the ages to live that this time that you're in is better than all the other times now this man's not saying this by not knowing he's saying this with the knowledge of a prophet of god and i i don't have to point out to you i know you know it but i think it's good to think about it amen but this man had visions of the garden of eden he he could tell you what color that he's eyes was what what color of hair her what he had visions of the cross he he told about jesus hanging on the cross 1955 vision the uh water from the rock and he actually while he's preaching he's breaking into visions and and he's telling you all these things and and by all the visions that he's had by all of the different dispensations it's been unlocked to him the scriptures that he's read he saw something about this age and he would say to you that this is the most glorious of all of the ages this is this is a man that has seen it and yet says i sing their day i see abraham's day i sing moses day i sing paul's day but your day is a more glorious day than all of the days that's ever lived now i say that because god is calling us into an experience and if we're not careful here today we will allow satan to devalue the experience that god is letting us live in and we'll be looking back and saying i wish i would have lived in that day or i wish i would have lived in another day and to think you're saying that while living in the greatest days that it's ever been so see satan can't change it he can't put you in another day so he can make you wish you was in another day he cannot he cannot take away the power of the experience of the word of god so he tries to explain away the the power of the experience that you're having but i i want to say that amen that if we could say it is in this way that god has called us into an experience that many men have longed to be but this is not an experience for the whole world amen we're experiencing things right now that it's not for everybody it's not a public show it's not a worldwide show it's not a national revival amen but i can find it in the bible that individuals had certain experiences with god that when god called them out and they would experience things other people wasn't experiencing but they were at the same time you know you go back and you read your history books and you can read about herod and you can read about rome and you can read about all these things that are happening but you know right in that same season of time when all those things was happening jesus christ was on the earth and he took three men in the bible matthew 17 he took three men and took them up on top of the mountain called mount transfiguration and those three men was experiencing things on the top of the mountain while politics was happening while trials were taking place while the world was going on the same as it did every day but they wasn't just having another day they was having a supernatural experience where they're transfiguring jesus christ where they were seeing him face to face upon the mountain a mountain of adoption a mountain of transfiguration a mountain where jesus was being revealed as the son of god right there they met while they were on the mountain they were seeing moses and they were seeing elijah and they in the bible tells us that peter becomes so overwhelmed by what he saw that he wanted to start building denominations he wanted to start building tabernacles to everybody but a shadow of a clown came over him amen and said listen amen just worship god amen amen just jesus just worship jesus amen and you know that any man that ever has a true experience with god is going to walk away in that spirit glorifying jesus christ amen and i think about these people upon this mountain and they're seeing this power and they're seeing this exhibition but the word that they heard come out of the cloud the voice they heard out of the cloud amen said hear ye him hear ye him now that's full of prophecy and that's full of of intention and that's full of power those just those little words hear ye him that's that's very powerful to the church of the living god because as it feels inside them you know you think about it when you go back there and you see jesus at jordan and you see the pillar of fire coming down and saying this is my beloved son but then you're seeing in matthew 17 we're starting to say here my here this is my beloved son but hear ye him now that means you have to hear him and not all the other voices now that's telling you you don't have to hear what everybody else is saying as long as you hear what he's say now it's one thing because he said in john 5 and 24 himself he that heareth my voice and believes me has passed from death into life and shall not come into condemnation is that right so then you find that you have to hear the voice of god for salvation for your power for your deliverance is that right but watch the scripture it said hear ye heal now the brother random will pick that up and he'll say that's a prophecy that he's going to speak in the last days that's a prophecy hear him means he's going to be speaking or he wouldn't tell you to listen so the same voice that they were listening to on the mountain will be the same voice that will be speaking in the last day and if you will hear that voice it will cause a transformation in your life and you will go from death unto life now how do you know the voice you're hearing is the same voice unless you can do an abstract on the voice is that right unless i can tell you where it was from the time it left jesus until the time i hear it today how can you tell me you're hearing the same voice but when william branham came he started with jesus christ and said here's the voice it went to paul in the first age and he brought it right down through seven ages and then he says i am the voice of god to you but just before he left the scene he said for the final voice for the final age will be the bride of jesus christ then the same voice that spoke on that mountain in the last day we'll be speaking through a five-fold ministry that have come under the authority of the prophet of god listen the experience you're having right now i know it's it's the devil's way to say look back and look back and look back but no child of god ought to ever have to look back there should be an experience going on right here right now inside this church of the living god where the glory and the power of the holy ghost is falling and we're recognizing who it is that is speaking to us or when peter describes it amen look what he said amen here ye him you know what the prophet of god said he said that put him back behind the word that put him back behind the word you know what he said when he said hear ye him he said that moved them back into the camp of eden it put them back in the same camp that adam and eve was in the garden of eden they were behind the word back there and the prophet of god is saying it put them back behind the word and today what has happened in the message of the hour what did the voice of the sign say get back to the word get back behind the word but i'm telling you tonight that you have had the same experience that they had in the bible home now transfiguration through the message of the hour it just puts you back amen behind the word of god and there's nothing more powerful than the word there's nothing more anointed than the word and if you're going to take a body change it'll be by the word if you're going to be delivered it'll be by the word it's adoption time back behind the word of god when peter describes it you know peter tells the story in second peter the first chapter he is describing what he saw on that mountain and he says he says now these are not fables these are not stories some little story i'm telling you he said i am an eyewitness of the majesty of god i'm an eyewitness of his majesty and then he begins to tell you a day star has risen and a more sure word of prophecy has come upon our life what is it when scripture is fulfilled then it shines as a day star into dark places amen and you think about where this message has shined into our lives amen people said that god wasn't a healer but he pierced the darkness and we saw the healing anointing people said god wasn't a deliverer but the word of the age has pierced the darkness of unbelief and critics and we've seen a deliverer rise up among us we've seen the healer we've seen the deliverer we've seen the prophetic words of god and how it comes into the church amen when peter described it he said a day star has risen and i'd like to echo those words in this hour this is not just a bunch of stories and a bunch of fables and william branham's ministries not just a bunch of little fables and stories put together hey remember that's a sure word of the prophecies of god coming to pass in this age this ain't just something little something this is the experience of mount transfiguration that we have climbed to pull them out and others have long deceit are you with me we bypass faith and temperance and knowledge we went on past virtue we went on past brotherly kindness until we've seen the capstone of the sovereign divine love the word itself has come back into the church and kept off a pride for the revelation of the age we're living my when i look and see where we're at today my when i think of the season and the times that we have lived in these seasons are pre-planned of god they're they're they're pre-scene of god when you you think you're a preacher what are you trying to tell you i'm trying to tell you that god can do great things in small crowds i'm trying to tell you god can do great things in small crowds you don't have to have a big crowd to have great things three of them went on the mountain with him but he did it on purpose he called them aside so that they could see the power of god without unbelief without unbelievers without skeptics without critics he called the believers out into a work of redemption my goodness when i think about it's an hour of resurrection church it's when god dismisses the unbelievers amen and calls the believers closer to manifest his promise and his word when god's going to do something he's ready to do it when there's believers in his midst you know you know what i'm saying this is the truth it's exactly what he done when they called him to come and rise jericho's daughter isn't it and and while he was on his way he said i'll come and wake her and while he was on his way while he was on the way she died on the way but did that stop the resurrection no it did not amen but he was on his way and did he not tell him back in the ages i'm on my way and many have died between that time and now but it don't stop the resurrection amen because their names is in the lamb's book of life but when he comes into the little room amen it's a time that he says i'm going to resurrect them and any unbeliever it's time to go any make believer i'm dismissing you this is the hour that the believer will witness the resurrection power in the church of the living god and this is the time it's why the separations come don't get excited don't get worried the unbeliever has to go to their place the the make-believer has to go to his place but the believer is being called into the position that god anointed you to come into and that position is a position of power a position of authority a position of witness and vision and revelation don't you underestimate the experience that god's calling you into just because there ain't a lot of people going don't mean it ain't wonderful and powerful when you get there come on church you know i'm telling you the truth it was only two who was walking on the road to emmaus when jesus himself came to them the bible said jesus himself drew near unto them and their eyes were holy now there's another one says he was in another form amen he was it same one in another form came near to them and can i say it to you like this it wasn't one like him it was him amen it wasn't one like jesus it was jesus he was just in another form and when their eyes were opened they saw it was the same jesus amen i tell you tonight we need an eye-opening service to recognize the same jesus is in here tonight in the form of the pride of jesus christ same power same authority same word my being invited into a place great things happen in little crowds look what he does he took him right there in that little room two of them and they got to go in the little room with him and while he was in that room the third pool began to open and they began to hear the bread being broke open by the one that wrote it are you hearing me this agent we're in now this ain't some little preacher wayne lawson this ain't some little pastor samuel amen that's not what we're talking about we're talking about the lamb taking a book and bringing a prophetic word that men without education men without men without abilities surrender themselves to an open word and they break the bread of life that same way he broke it in that day and brother let me tell you there's some bread eaters in the house tonight amen people that have seen it and have recognized spiritual food and due season an hour of the eating of the bread glory to god you know what i'm talking about the bread of communion the bread of eden and time communion and melchizedek bread and melchizedek feast the wine and bread and authority just at the changing of the body that's what they served in the exodus they served some bread it was unleavened bread and they ate it with their rods in their hand and the shoes on their feet and the bible said not even a feeble one left the place amen i'll tell you this there's a bride coming out today and she's not leaving feeble and she's not leaving sick but she's going to leave with a change amen by the way i wish the church was bigger i wish the bribe was bigger i seen some people leaving well i'll tell you what i don't care what happens in the numbers amen i'm worried about the value of the experience that i've been given amen i'm not going to say it's getting smaller because it's not that's just a plot of the plume of the devil that's just a lie the devil's telling somebody i just a few years ago was over in in india and there's one church in there apostolic church that come into the message i was a part of bringing them and it was 750 and the apostolics told them when you accept that message you're going to lose everybody in the building and you know what he did he said if it's the word of god if it costs me every person i don't care i'm going to stand with the word of god and you know what he did he didn't lose nobody but you know what else happened all of the ministries that he had raised up and sent out and started churches over about 30 of them they all accepted the message they accepted it in one meeting i was preaching that meeting and the pillar of fire came down and blew the building up and then thousands of people were receiving the holy ghost at the same hour and the people that saw that dynamic demonstration said any message that produces that much power i want to be a part of it and let me tell you you don't have to have a thousand people to know the power of the resurrection out of god and come in this building right here tonight well the last time i was over there brother samuel they broke out the walls they tore down the houses next door people gave up their houses and they emptied them out and they're filling them up with church people he went from 750 to about 2000 in a couple years you know what he did he dedicated himself to god and he believed the message with the power to preach it now i i cannot preach why i'm here let me say this there's some people that this message don't do nothing for it's because of their unbelief that the power of the message don't do any good for them they're so cowardly that they can't preach the message but because they believe the message then the denomination don't want nothing to do with them amen and then because the believer amen believes the message that when they hear the cowardness in a man they don't want to follow him because they ain't going to follow no coward amen so you ain't helping nobody by hiding the truth hey remember you've got to declare who you are declare it with power and let the believer be a believer and let the unbeliever be able to are you hearing me what sometimes sometimes i think amen that our 12 year old girls has got more more strength than some of our preachers amen some of them backslid they don't even know they wouldn't they wouldn't know amen the power of god if it walked up and tapped them on the shoulder well i might as well preach hadn't we got some young girls here we got who we got here how many young girls we got we got a couple right here you young ladies uh how old you are you're 11 how old are you yeah you're 38 you're not that young you are young according to me you are hey remember that she's 11 would you stand up for me would that be okay would i miss you no can you stand up for me she's 11 years old amen how old are you 20 stand up brother amen you you see these guys they go out on the street and they they wear this message and they conduct themselves by this message and then that little girl goes to the mall dressed like that she walks down the street dressed like you know why she dresses like that because a prophet taught to dress like that she's got more strength than some of the preachers that's got it that can't even preach it in a church full of believers amen but there are some believers in the last day that's going to cast aside every bit of the cowardice and every bit of the backup and they're going to say amen to the word of god what difference does it make you can laugh at me you can ridicule me amen but i'm going to feel the power of the experience that i'm in oh everybody rip it away from me he said preacher that's a little strong it's time to be strong [Applause] this is a wonderful time it's a wonderful time is it not could i say this but this is a bright time yeah y'all remember brother i'm saying it's a bright time you know what that that when a prophet says something like that he's telling you something of the age you're living the time you're living so he says bride time that phrase that he speaks opens up amen a change of relationship he's telling you bride time is not dating time you see this not church time it's not play church time this is pride time this is when the word and the church have become one and there's a relationship moving you not kitchen time not living room time it's a bedroom experience time you see when he says bright time amen i have to say it like this it's not only the experience you're having it's the experience you can have yes amen to you so brother we're having a great experience but how much more could you have if you only recognize the position you've been put in amen isn't there more that you can have than you're having hey remember when i say this and it's the experience of god it's a brother man we'll call it a bright time then maybe make it a little clearer he says it's a bright age many people see that i said people stumble over that i don't actually meet it means the seed has come out of the shuck you know how powerful that is because the seed that's in a shuck is bound to the shock the seed that's in the shock has to share its glory with the bondage of a shot in other words there's not a full expression that's not a full revealing it cannot really be who it is because it's in the bonds of a shock but once it comes out of it it can be exactly everything that's anointed to be and i'll tell you this bride has come out of this layout to see us shook and she's been put back into the word of god everything she's been called to be amen the prophet of god then he'll call it a son of man age amen hey amen he'll call it an adoption time an adoption time you see checkbook authority time can i say it like this amen that it's a time amen where there's not some age limit but a true seed of god has every promise that god given and everything that's in the bible has been promised to the seed of abraham whose seed we are according to the promises of god we promised a new body to live in a new earth amen in a brand new body that's a promise made to us and every promise that god made has been made to the church adoption time now saying it's adoption time seed time son of man age amen i thought this one was phenomenal it's a rapture age amen now what would that mean to you as a church it means that the cycles have changed we've been in a death cycle since the garden of eden amen now to see what a rapture age or cycle would mean you have to understand how we got where we are to understand what's happening to see the cause of it now i won't have time to preach on it in a depth but let's just say it like this job saw it amen and the prophet said he saw the corruption of the seed was the problem so in the garden of eden when death come in was when satan reasoned with eve on the word and it polluted the word so you've got death from that time all the way through but then there's a season where the bible said that the incorruptible word would come and the church would be able to take on incorruption that the mortal would take on immortality so it's got to be a season of immortality it's going to be a season of incorruption and and to get any season you've got to have a word so the word is a word of the righteous cycle that changes it from death unto life when we're taking in this message we're not taking in death we're taking it alive and life is coming into the church amen that we have turned a corner again again remember say it like this we've turned a corner dispensational change uh to a builder it means that you've come through the corners and now you're going to change your corner right take somebody to lay it out to get it in the right place to get the change in the right place right it's a corner but once you get through the corner about anybody can lay a light amen anybody can go and you watch how william branham came as a mason and he turned the corner for the church and he turned us from this pentecostal age into not a flat corner amen but he turned us upward amen and he put us back into the eternal lands of god now the church brother man said you got to slow down at the corner see you got to take your time be careful at the corner but once you get the corner made it's time for the church to run like never before it's a time for the bride of christ can i say this to you tonight bride this is time for you to run it's the top see see if the coach is standing on the sideline he would be saying to you run with all of your might hallelujah there is nothing between you and the finish line there's nothing between you and the finish line there's no messengers coming there's no revivals coming there's nothing else coming amen what is happening now is a bride is taking the message of her day and she's running until the finish of this rapture amen and i'll tell you this if i could give voice amen beyond the curtain of time brother branham said i heard him say press the bible can i say it to you hebrews 12 said let us run this race that is set before us amen there's a cloud of witnesses who are watching let us lay aside every sin that would be sentenced every weight of sin amen and everything that would be said it's let us lay it aside well well i'll tell you amen you know you know that we could spend hours there but could i just say this much to you whatever's waiting you down lay it aside amen maybe there's a little trouble in the church it's not a time to find trouble it's not a time to pick up burdens it's not a time to pick up a problem you can't run and carry it with you you've got to put it down right here and keep running do you recognize one more step and you may be in eternity okay one more step hey when you ain't got time to stop and pick it up and worry about it now i know some people get worried they think they might need it later you know we got to keep this case we need it later let me tell you this is a provisional race and amen as it is a marathon you know they don't carry their water and their food but they're stationed set along the way amen and when you're running if you start running low you just stop and get a drink so you don't carry the water you don't carry the food you just run and let me tell you tonight church you're carrying too many burdens with you you carrying too many issues with you you got to drop it all and run like you've never run before run to the finish line run run run run run nobody ever run this is not paul's time this is not moses it's time this is not adam's time this is prime time got to finish the race everybody's waiting on you the heavens are cheering and then the ages are cheering you got to run provisional brother you ain't never seen no duck pack up a bunch of wheat to carry south he knows that the god that's sending him here everything he needs is along the way and the church is in the move it's the move his own you ain't got a pack up to go you got to unload to go you got to unpack everything of unbelief every trial every problem glory to god the devil trying to give you stuff you know why he's trying to give it to you because he's trying to slow you down he's trying to pile it on you where you can't run you can't run like a runner hey man but i'll tell you this the word the word is calling for a total separation of all unbelief the word your coach is standing on the inside and he's saying i chose you for the race i chose you to finish this amen he's already bragged on you brother he's already said this one won't fall at the line this one won't fall like the first e fail this runner this eve she won't even stumble at unbelief she won't stagger at the finish line but by the revelation of the word she'll run [Applause] she'll stay on her feet are you hearing me amen are you hearing me church the world don't have enough to knock this sprite down they don't have enough amen i'll tell you this they throwed everything they got at us they throwed everything they got every devil in hell has come against us and we're still standing and we're still moving and we're still shouting and we're still running i'll tell you why we are because we're anointing runners we're anointed to finish this sometimes you see me preaching and i just start waving my cough like this people think that's surrender let's not surrender i i promise years ago the devil said i'm going to get you you're not ever going to make it i'm going to make you fall before you reach the end amen and every time just when he starts telling me that i get to preach it i just pick my flag up and start waving this flag says devil i'm still here i'm still running you're for everything you've got but i'm still coming at you i'm still running the races and i'm here tonight i'm still running i'm still waving amen you don't have enough the devil don't have enough brother might as well shout about it you've been fighting about it you've been hurt by it you might as well shout about [Applause] [Applause] it's race time this ain't a time to pick up a bunch of trouble [Applause] somebody said well bro wayne you know what's going in the church this this this i don't have time don't mean to be unconcerned i don't have time i don't mean to be i don't need to be carefree i don't have time i've got to run and i can't run like that [Applause] [Music] well i believe the word itself is calling amen this bright church is manifesting time amen calendars calendars ain't changing calendars don't change seasons god changes the seasons i haven't been amazed at this many times people say well by the way and i tell people and when you're going to serve the lord when you're going to really serve the lord they said well there'll be a time there's coming a time someday sometime it's going to be coming amen and they think that if they give it some time somehow it's going to get better between then and now but you know what amen time doesn't change things matter of fact generally it makes it harder with the amount of time you spend and seeing the more scars more troubles more problems amen it actually becomes harder you become colder things become more embedded in you now i can prove it i don't i don't want to take a lot of time this but i could prove it to you if you go down to an old folks home over here a retirement village somewhere and them old men are still chasing them women they still dirty old men because they were dirty young men and they just got old so just because they got old didn't mean they got a better heart amen they just got old that's all that happened people still smoking drinking committing adultery running doing whatever and they're old people doing it because they never met somebody to change them and they kept waiting for time to change it and time don't change it come on sin is worse today than it was 5 000 years ago time ain't gonna change it well we might as well preach since we're here haven't we time ain't going to change it amen so we got to have a season of change we got to have a season for change i mean when i was i was looking this i thought it's amazing it's that the man to pull up bethesda another proof 38 years he spent at the pool 38 years amen he had been in an infliction for 38 years if time was going to fix it he would have been healed if time would would heal him he would have been healed by 38 years he had been at the pool amen and the bible said a certain man in a certain season amen speaking to you speaking to me a certain man not just anybody but a certain person but you stay in something for a long time amen but it'll take a certain season to bring change now that season came when the angel came to the pool amen but the bible tells us the season he was in was not just an angel but the very god of the angels amen the very angel of the covenant jesus christ was the one in his season do you understand what i'm saying to you you're not just getting a messenger at this time you're not just getting another church age messenger but the season you're living in the angel that has came is the angel of the covenant jesus christ has come to make a change [Applause] now i could easily tell you that that change is coming through a pillar of fire is that right that pillar of fire is jesus christ paul met him on the road right paul met him said lord who are you jehovah who are you he said i am jesus he said i come from god and returned to god he came from the light returned back to the light so that light was jesus christ that same light that wrote the bible amen comes in the end time and appears over william branham's head amen and and just for the record we didn't take the picture are you with me just for the record we didn't take the picture in sam houston coliseum before a bunch of people amen a picture was taken to the pillar of fire now the people that took it was our critics so they didn't fix it up for us they didn't help us out they were our critics trying to destroy the work of that ministry but god amen said who can be against you if i before you now that same one was called the angel the covenant of the holy ghost and the man calls it the pillar of fire the same one now that pillar of fire and who's this melchizedek in 1965 brother ram said that pillar of fire amen he says it comes among us can you imagine the purifier comes among us now you might ask what does he come here for what's the purpose of his coming he said it's something to change our hearts oh god you mean christ himself has come to change our hearts he didn't just send an angel he didn't just send somebody he come himself he come to change our heart because actually as a man thinketh in his heart he is so the problems that we have is not the world the problems we have is in our own heart the issues that we face the problems we have it's not the world it's our heart amen you can have a thousand liquor stores but if it's not in your heart they go out of business amen the store is full of cigarettes i don't buy one of them because it's not in my heart to do it so you can close all of them but if it's in your heart it's not going to help but christ didn't come just to close down the liquor store he come to change your heart amen now you got to see in matthew chapter 24 he says he says this when the parable of the fig tree comes forth they know the season see the fig tree of the season it's a summer right when you see the fig tree put forth bud know the season is changed the summer is nigh he says see the summer is nigh in matthew 24 33 he says it like this that it's near even at the door amen see even at the door now if you go back to the revelations you watch in revelation chapter 2 coming up to the church ages jesus will say a repent or else i will come quickly but in revelation 3 and 20th allowed to see an age he said i stand at the door the season that israel's a nation the same season that the bride will receive the visitation of the pillar of fire in a heart transitioning message that will actually have the power to change the heart to a purity in the most evil of all the ages it ever was that will be hearts that will be turned back to god by the power of a vindicated word it will not be done by socialism it will not be done by traditions amen churchianity can't do it preachers can't do it amen memberships can't do it confessions can't do it it will take the personal presence of jesus christ by the baptism of the holy ghost to come into the being of a person and he will change their heart now notice what he says i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open i will come unto him i will come unto him of course in a broad sense he's speaking of laodicea and christ is on the outside in a personal sense it's talking about christ speaking to the heart you see a prophecy laying here i will come in the age of laodicea in this dark age and speak personally to your heart the god of heaven having a personal visitation with you can you imagine sitting in a little service like this and all of a sudden god starts talking to your heart and he's doing it to fulfill prophecy i will come unto you i will speak unto you i will knock at your heart see a knock he says that he that hears my voice so the knock is the voice of god talking to you god knocking trying to bring change to your life is when god starts speaking to you you see the voices what's doing it look what he said he that heareth my voice harden not your heart as they did in the days of provocation but open the door and let christ come into thy heart let the voice of god begin to come in the heart now he didn't promise to send someone he said i will come i personal pronoun i'm not an english major but that's personal i i will come unto you now if you could take that eye could we preach a month no matter what i i i think about this i the one that created the heavens and earth had said i'll personally come and talk to you the one that hung the stars in their place and put the moon and said to the sun where it could stand fill the oceans with water put the flowers on the mountain sprinkle the trees with the with the birds and the insects of the land put man upon the earth that one that can do all of that with by the speaking of his word said i will come into your heart think about it the creator of heavens and earth has become a renovator of your life amen you have just invited the greatest renovator that ever lives amen a new creation will take place inside you he will come and put it back like it was in the garden of eden i've often said it like this you could put a three-year-old turning loose in your house for a couple hours he can tear it up so bad you didn't you you i tell you what you let a three-year-old just do what they want in the house and see what happens they'll pull everything down put everything out of place now you you take them back there and you be serious about it and put them and say look i'm giving you all day to put it back like it was or i'm going to spank you well you might as well spank them to start with they can't put it back you know why they can't because they don't know why it was there they can't put it back and they don't know why it was there it would take the one that put it there to put it back and all these theologians and all these psychologists they'll never fix you they'll never fix that heart it'll take the god that created you ain't meant to play it back in the place that it come from the creator has become a renovator and he's come into your life and so they've misplaced this and they misplaced this and they misplaced this and you know what he said he'll knock and he's not knocking at the door of your house he's knocking at the door of your heart he's not just wanting to come home with you he's wanting to come into your life and any door you'll open up in that life he will come in there and he will rearrange it to the divine order can you imagine your life being in order but a divine order but every room in there amen every room that the spirit goes into is a divine order [Music] let him come he said i will i will come unto you i will come into you i will come in and reveal i'll come in and sub now now that prophecy is an eye which is personal which is christ coming in there that's amazing because he's doing it by prophecy in revelation 3 the same as jesus did it in the scripture when he came into jerusalem do you know do you know that they gave the very dates daniel could have gave you the very dates christ come into the cities of jerusalem but by prophecy of zechariah line they could have told you that their king would come riding the color of the horse he would write they would they could tell you by prophecy that the the mule he would ride would not have him been rolled it will be a white foal and it will not have even been written and your king will come right in it in the name of the lord and and by daniel they could have told you the very day he was coming amen had they watched the prophecies they would have knew exactly who it was brother ma'am said when he come riding down there that day amen and they begin to say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord he said see they begin to feel the atmosphere was full amen and and and when they heard the people rejoicing and they saw him riding in he said they begin to say who is this amen now think about that who is this now now the brother man will say he'll tie it together for us and he'll say it and who's this in 1959 he'll say look he said the city went out pouring the waters washing their pots ceremonies crying who's in a hosanna screaming to the top of their voice oh i can imagine what those people see who is interrupting our church who's interrupting our church service with all this noise do you think that stopped them the very christ that they had looked for was right with them how could you stop them amen what is it they see who is it they begin to say this causing the stare who is this who's got this little group of people wrapped up around him who's causing this see they said who is it but the people that it was being stirred up knew who it was they knew that that was the king prophesied in zechariah that's why amen that's why that's why when they said to jesus they said look can you make these people hold it down a little you seem to be the source of this could you just quiet these people a little bit and jesus said to them amen if i tell them to hold their peace he said these rocks are going to cry out listen church amen i know there's people that would like us to to hush up a little about this message i know they don't want us to quote the prophet and preach the word and shout about the age that we're in and the things that god's doing but if we hold our peace the rocks are going to stand up out there and start preaching the message of the hour all creation all creation has longed to see the day and we see it and we see it and it ain't happening it ain't happening in the church it ain't happening down the road it's happening in my heart oh can you imagine when he started riding into jerusalem and they didn't they didn't have anything to worship with they didn't have anything you know what the bible said they start taking the palm leaves off the trees and throwing them down they start taking off their coats and throwing before and crying hosanna hosanna blessed is he that comes in the name of the lord and to think tonight that that same one that rolled then is riding again on the last days he's coming come on church amen he's not going to ride he's riding tonight he meant it wasn't william plant them riding the trail it would be jesus christ riding the trail again and here he is tonight riding right here in the church of the living god the vindicated word has carried you into an anointing and the people begin to shout they begin to rejoice and others look around and say why what is this who's causing this amen people say i've had people tell me hey mr brother wayne you you should tell them people to sit down i said well i didn't tell them to stand up he said you i've had people say you you let the people shout too much you are telling quantum down i said i didn't ask him to shout i didn't ask him to stand up i didn't ask him to rejoice i just preached the word of god and there's something on the inside of the believer that said blessing is he that comes in the name of the lord it's the holy ghost the holy ghost that's coming to the church with authority and with power it's our time do you see what it's doing he's coming amen to our lives somebody said well brother wayne if he's if this great one's coming what's he coming to do i love how brother brown says he's coming to bring a pardon he has come to this place tonight and he's speaking to you to pardon you can you imagine right now if you just open your heart and let the presence of god carry this word in the renovator will take away all evidence of a former occupant he will clean the floors he will clean the walls he will sanctify it and make you a brand new creature pardoning you from all the former lies loosening you from your unbelief loosening you from your affliction loosening you from the dreads of sin come on church i know there's a lot of believers that would fly a lot higher if they could just get rid of that little bit of haunting spirit amen if they could get rid of that little bit of that devil every time you start shouting every time you start rejoicing there's that little devil over there i know what you did they know what you did this one knows what you did well i tell you what you go tell whoever you want to because i done told my daddy hey man i just had some brothers and every time they wanted me to do something that i didn't want to do they said we'll tell mama on you he might say you know what my first objection every day was i told mama everything she knew everything about me so every time they tried to put me under the thumb i'd say go tell her she already knows and i'll tell you this you can't tell my god anything about me that i don't already don't already know so you know what i can do i can come to the house of god and i can preach without condemnation i can shout without condemnation i can love god because i'm standing under the blood of this age [Applause] loosened from unbelief loosened from sin loosening the church of the living god you see what is happening it's a time of visitation god is visiting the church now now brother brahm says it's a visitation and and to make it clear brother bannon will say as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming the son of man otherwise a visitation of the same thing elohim will visit abraham's seed the same way he visited abraham now don't let it pass us in vain don't let elohim come and visit us and us walk off the same because see what happens is now here we are with all this going on all this trouble with all these problems and i'm up here preaching it's the greatest age greatest time grace blessing and you're sitting here one of you got a mask on others wore a mask in some of you have you heard every kind of politics on the situation what you should what you shouldn't do amen everything in the world is going on all the dark walk out of here and there's all kinds of fights and troubles and problems everywhere are you hearing me what what is it brother madam says it's the devil trying to block the visitation of god see in the days of abraham brother man said when elohim come to his tent door and when he came to his tent personally came to the tent of abraham god is coming to your tent yes amen is that right christ is coming elohim to your tent and brother man said while this was happening he said that morning he said the sun was hot he said the grass was dry he said the cows was was in a famine he said sarah was upset about her hair and the way she was dressing are you hearing me it wasn't a different day but it was a different season it was the same as every other day at the house of abraham just like it's your house honey my hair ain't doing good amen something's happened and the bill didn't get paid and this over here and this thing and this now now we've got all this politics going on around the message all over the world it's going on everywhere and people are saying what's going on brother wayne what's going on i tell you what's happening is satan is trying to block the visitation he's trying to get your mind away from the thing that any humans come to my tent hello him oh magic god has visited my tent tonight hallelujah i love how the prophet says that he says i believe there's a blessing in this city tonight i believe there's a blessing in store i believe there's a blessing in this meeting tonight i believe the blessing of the holy ghost is going to fall in this meeting tonight and the devil has done everything he can to block it yet there's things that's went on in your life just this week don't go to the house of god too much trouble this problem that situation you shouldn't come you shouldn't do and satan trying to block the visitation of the holy ghost amen but you persevered and you come anyhow and you withstood anyhow because you believe something special might happen [Applause] coming for a visitation tonight brother bam said don't miss your visitation wake up now watch because when jesus visits great things happen amen amen what's now he went to a tent down in the tombs of gardea and it was a man bound by by a legion of demons amen and jesus being a frail humble man the bible said not much to look at brother brahman said he was frail and humble and when the demon in that man rose up he said we'll go down and destroy this man he wasn't nothing to look at we'll destroy him like we have everybody else but brother ram said when that devil got down there and faced up with jesus he said jesus lifted his head and looked into the eyes of that man he said when he connected eyes he said that devil said what are you doing in there amen see elohim had come the one that kicked that devil out in the beginning was now standing there visiting the tombs are you hear me he wasn't in the palace he was in the tombs there was a revival in the graveyard old church of the living god there's a revival that has come the great grave age of laodicea darkness is everywhere but the day star it's risen the power of god is following the anointing of the holy ghost is moving upon the church you see what he said to that devil take your leave loose the man and let him go and i'll tell you the same anointing is still here today visiting the church it's visiting in the holy ghost [Applause] it's a powerful time to live now you think we've been here too long i don't mean tonight i mean in time by the way why didn't the lord already come why is this situation already over why we already raptured do you know the bible the program said as it was in the days of noah right and we look at the evil side brother of them said there's more to it than just the evil he said it's also called the day of long suffering and god is not slack concerning his promise but he is gracious and lone suffering with people to get their hearts right yeah now i've been in some meetings when they went a little long actually one time i was preaching i was preaching at the church uh brother erickson's and and i was actually preaching on time and i was talking about i was actually talking about god giving you a lot of time and it was up to you what you do with that a lot of time and i'm talking about your time on earth your grace god gives you what you do with that grace and i was just ministering all that we come to the end of the service and and i felt a nice pull but i turned the meeting over to brother erickson and brother actually gets up behind the pulpit and he starts singing a song and if you know brother ray he never does this but in the middle as he starts singing the song he said folks he said god's not done in here today he said i feel like somebody needs something from the lord and he just started singing a song when he did a lady got up and come up to the front the sister is a little bit a good friend of ours we know her well tremendous sister but she had been carrying the guilt from an abusive thing happened when she was a little girl i think maybe an uncle or something had abused her as a little child and her whole adult life she had been carrying that guilt like she done something wrong and she had carried that and carried that and karen and in the middle of that search she gets up and comes in the end of the service now listen to me in the end of the service amen in a prolonged moment of the service in a long suffering moment in that service and she gets up and comes up there and when she does amen we pray for him the spirit left her right and and i realized right then that god had created a little moment on the end of that service to give her at deliverance and i thought isn't that amazing she would have had to live the rest of her life unless god would give her that specific moment and you think about this because brother branham said that god created time because of the devil is that right he said in end time he will destroy the devil and all redemption will take place that's where the cross happened that's redemption takes place now think about eternity and a devil in eternity but god created time as a place to destroy the devil so we don't have to live in eternity with no devil and god created this moment in time to destroy the works of the enemy in your life amen that you don't have to live the rest of your life with some devil this thing about laws and works this is about living free this is about living under the holy ghost power of god amen amen to think right now that god is created and created a time i know that's a special time time's at hand but what time what time is the time when satan's cast down a time when satan is destroyed a time in christ is knocking at your heart a time when we're running like never before a time the rapture anointing a time of the experience of the bride of christ a very time that we're living right now you see even in this in this service right now a time that god has created that you can you can break the bonds amen of unbelief little little things that you've had to carry burn you little things that you that you're concerned with and they trouble you they keep you out of that sweet experience with christ this meeting right here god can create a moment in time to squash that spirit in your heart amen maybe you ain't got the power to kick him out maybe the power maybe you don't have the power to do it yourself but he said i'm knocking yes amen and you let him in he doesn't kick the devil out one time i guarantee you can do it again you let him in tonight watch what he does stand your feet tonight let our music players come it's a time it's a time when angelic battles have become human battles it's that time but the bible said they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony now how could you testify this tonight lest god give it to you from a prophet how could you say it tonight how could you say the things that we say unless god would give you a prophet but because he's given us a prophet with a prophetic word he's gave us a word to speak and through that word the greatest weapon that's ever been given to the earth there's not a greater weapon ever been given you can you can use that you can use that word you can get out of anything is that right get out of anything listen tonight i i believe tonight that you can break out of it i believe it i i'm just preaching the other day to a youth meeting down there at home and i told the young people i said you know what we really need is a breakthrough that's what we really need as is a breakthrough and that's what as a bride as a people we just need to break out of it all these things all these issues just just forget it break out of it and remember it's elohim it's elohim visiting christ visiting tonight's visiting your hearts he if you if you would open up and let him in he renovated change it i i i know that he's the greatest he's the greatest renovator that ever was do you know that he will renovate this earth back to its former glory and beauty he'll renovate the whole thing and the same one that will renovate the heavens and earth has promised tonight that he would come in our hearts and renovate change a personal visitation to change your heart who wouldn't want that in them to mind who wouldn't want to say come on in here lord change this desire change this heart let the mercies of god let's just buy our hearts tonight father we're so thankful tonight for the anointing of god that would come into this place the time that you've created in this meeting the moment that you've given us to speak to your children but i i pray father tonight that the power of your spirit would visit homes and visit lives lord i i don't believe that we have to bring you down i believe you're right here already i believe you've been speaking to hearts tonight touching lives and i ask you now as you would minister to the need lord father we open up our hearts and we ask you to come in lord
