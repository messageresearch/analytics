[28:59] And then you know it ain't going to be
[29:02] long. You're going to be changed too.
[29:05] You'll keep pressing on
[29:10] on and on and on.
[29:13] Pressing on.
[29:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[29:18] Hallelujah. I keep pressing on
[29:23] to the higher calling of my Lord. Your
[29:28] time. I'm going to keep pressing on
[29:34] on and on and on. I'll keep pressing on.
[29:43] I'm going to keep pressing on to the
[29:48] higher call of my Lord.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; I'll keep pressing on
[29:58] to the higher calling of my Lord.
[30:07] Hallelujah.
[30:09] Glory be to God.
[30:12] Hallelujah.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; If there's a press, then there's an
[30:20] opposition,
[30:22] &gt;&gt; right? But greater is he that's in you
[30:26] &gt;&gt; than he that's in the world.
[30:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram came to himself after the
[30:32] vision of going beyond the curtain of
[30:33] time. And he came to himself
[30:36] putting his fist in the air.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; Keep pressing.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; Keep pressing. Amen.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; Keep pressing.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that how you feel tonight?
[30:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Keep pressing. Amen. God bless you
[30:49] tonight. And good to see that you
[30:51] pressed your way out tonight. May God
[30:54] richly Amen. bless you. I think that's
[30:57] such a to me I want to say God bless
[30:59] you. Amen. I know there's different ones
[31:01] that would have been here and sickness.
[31:03] Sometimes there's jobs and things like
[31:05] that, but God bless you. Amen. And just
[31:07] pressing your way out here tonight. And
[31:10] I believe God, amen, has something for
[31:12] us. He never calls us together without
[31:15] having something for us.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we just want to enter right
[31:19] in. Amen. What a wonderful atmosphere.
[31:21] Let's just go to him in a word of
[31:23] prayer. And Amen. Heavenly Father,
[31:27] Lord Jesus, how we're so thankful,
[31:30] &gt;&gt; Lord, for what a wonderful presence,
[31:34] &gt;&gt; wonderful atmosphere,
[31:36] Lord God, as your children. Lord, we
[31:40] come Lord from all of the not only the
[31:42] walks of life but all of the different
[31:44] daily tasks and things that we've had
[31:47] before us but Father we've just stepped
[31:50] aside Lord
[31:53] your God to come and to worship you
[31:57] and Father to just
[32:00] Lord bask in your presence and to know
[32:03] that God that we
[32:07] Jesus can receive receive such strength
[32:11] from your word, Lord.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; Oh God, such Lord such encouragement.
[32:19] Lord Jesus,
[32:22] we don't ask you Lord that you would
[32:24] take away the trials, the problems, but
[32:28] we ask you for the grace and wisdom
[32:31] and Lord for your leadership. Lord, that
[32:34] God that you would give us the grace to
[32:36] go through them. Lord, help us, Lord,
[32:40] just sometimes, Lord, in moments like
[32:41] this is just a moment that helps us,
[32:44] Lord, to
[32:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. just get right back on track maybe
[32:48] to look at things Lord
[32:50] in a Lord in the way that we should.
[32:54] Lord, we're not here because we're Lord
[32:56] a big I or big you. We're here Lord
[32:58] because of the grace of God. And Lord
[33:02] Jesus, unlike the spirit of this age,
[33:05] we're dependent on you, Father.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; You're our husband.
[33:10] Lord God, when you have taken us unto
[33:12] yourself, you've put that veil over your
[33:15] shoulder.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; That expresses that you would take care
[33:19] of all of our needs.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Lord, you know the vastness of the needs
[33:24] that's here. It may not be, Lord God,
[33:27] very many of us, but it's still, Lord,
[33:30] if it's only just a couple, it's still,
[33:32] Father, we'll take you. And Lord, you
[33:35] won't withhold your presence. It's not
[33:37] about numbers with you, Father. It's
[33:40] about hearts that Lord would just
[33:42] welcome you and we're here tonight
[33:44] because we have need Lord of you. May
[33:47] you just come Lord and just cause the
[33:49] words of my mouth Lord to be formed that
[33:52] would be according to your will. Lord
[33:55] what is to be expressed here tonight and
[33:57] just minister to our hearts. Lord be
[34:00] with each and every one the different
[34:01] needs. Those that are not able to be
[34:03] here Lord may you minister to them as
[34:06] well. Lord, I pray and and make a way,
[34:08] Lord. If it's something that God, that
[34:10] we'd be hindering, Lord, may you make a
[34:12] way, Father, that they also, Lord, would
[34:15] be able to gather and and to assemble
[34:17] here as well, Father. Lord, what a
[34:19] privilege it is to be able to come
[34:21] together, Lord. We love you and we thank
[34:23] you, Father, in Jesus precious name.
[34:27] Amen.
[34:28] Amen. Let's look here in the scriptures.
[34:31] Amen. John chapter 13. I'm going to read
[34:33] just a couple places and we'll allow you
[34:35] to have your seats tonight. Amen.
[34:45] Amen. So thankful for the just the Amen.
[34:48] the wonderful just the song service, the
[34:50] atmosphere. Amen. Just so precious.
[34:53] Amen.
[34:56] John 13 and 34.
[35:00] Amen. A new commandment
[35:03] I give unto you, that ye love one
[35:07] another,
[35:09] as I have loved you,
[35:13] that you also love one another.
[35:16] Now, I don't believe these were just
[35:18] good words that were spoken. I don't
[35:20] believe this was something that was
[35:22] limited to Sunday school class, but he's
[35:25] speaking to his disciples, those that
[35:28] will be vessels that will actually pack
[35:31] the message. And if they miss this,
[35:36] they can have all the doctrine right,
[35:38] &gt;&gt; but if they miss this,
[35:41] &gt;&gt; then their identity is lost.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Because we're not identified by how
[35:46] right we are in doctrine. Right. Right.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; Doctrine is important. Is that right?
[35:52] &gt;&gt; Doctrine is important. The truth, the
[35:53] spirit of truth. That's very important.
[35:56] But notice what Jesus said. By this
[35:59] shall all men know or perceive that ye
[36:03] are my disciples if ye have love one to
[36:07] another. Now, obviously, we're we
[36:09] wouldn't be outside of the word, but to
[36:12] be dwelling in the word is also to have
[36:15] the life of the word within us.
[36:17] And that is exactly what the perception
[36:20] where others would see. They wouldn't
[36:22] even it wouldn't even be about my did
[36:24] you see how they put that together. Did
[36:27] you see how they tied that scripture and
[36:29] tied that quote? My good. That's not it
[36:32] at all. But by this by the love not that
[36:36] we would even have toward them, but the
[36:39] love that we would have toward one
[36:42] another.
[36:44] Because after all this love when Jesus
[36:46] writes this speaks this a new
[36:48] commandment this could never have been
[36:50] attained to without the coming of the
[36:52] Holy Ghost.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; Impossible because this love that he's
[36:56] speaking of is who he is.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; Remember when brother Bram says the word
[37:02] is coming across our pathway and we're
[37:04] surrendering it to him. He said you are
[37:06] becoming love for God is love. So by
[37:11] this so I I to me I appreciate it
[37:13] because you realize it doesn't matter
[37:15] how smart we are. I believe in studying.
[37:18] I believe in giving ourselves to God. I
[37:20] believe in all of that. The Bible
[37:22] admonish uses in that. But when it all
[37:23] comes down to it what what is the
[37:25] distinguishing factor is the love of God
[37:29] within our hearts.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:33] By this shall all men know that ye are
[37:36] my disciples, if you have love one to
[37:40] another.
[37:42] John 15:17, these things I command you
[37:46] that ye love
[37:49] one another.
[37:50] Amen. May God bless you and bless the
[37:52] reading of the word as you're being
[37:53] seated. I want to speak here tonight on
[37:57] this thought. The brotherhood.
[38:00] the brotherhood.
[38:04] And when you see the scriptures that
[38:06] we've read from here tonight, you
[38:09] recognize as Jesus many times you'll
[38:11] chase this down in the scriptures where
[38:13] it will say one of another, one to
[38:16] another. So it would speak of there
[38:20] would be a reciprocal part. In other
[38:22] words, for that love that would actually
[38:25] pass through of a reserved conduit and
[38:30] then it would actually be able to be
[38:32] received and passed on if like
[38:35] electricity flowing through this
[38:37] building. We we originally my wife and I
[38:40] at home I think of it as it comes to
[38:42] mind now. We've had a coffee pot. Many
[38:44] of you many different ones even when we
[38:46] lived at the other place many of you
[38:47] remember when we some 10 years ago and
[38:49] we were talking about how long we had
[38:51] had that bun coffee maker and you know
[38:53] when I drink coffee I like it boiling
[38:55] hot when I drink it I don't like it
[38:56] lukewarm and that's why I always tease
[38:58] the brothers from overseas when they say
[39:00] no ice and I quote the scripture I would
[39:02] thou hot or cold and then give it to
[39:06] them you know and I've got good friends
[39:07] uh buddies that I tell them I'll say you
[39:09] know what I'll go ahead and make your
[39:10] coffee and have it setting out so when
[39:12] you come here a couple months down the
[39:14] road, it'll be ready for you." And of
[39:17] course, they have their things they like
[39:18] to say about me drinking it scalding
[39:20] hot. But my point is is we we just got
[39:23] done talking about, "Yeah, we've had
[39:24] this coffee maker for 11 years." And you
[39:27] know, it's about the time you get ready
[39:28] to say something like that and something
[39:29] goes out. And so that very night when we
[39:33] made that statement, you know, we my
[39:35] wife and I where it's plugged in at cuz
[39:36] it always it stays warm, stays hot in
[39:39] that reservoir there. And she she
[39:41] actually that night it it got to a place
[39:44] kept kicking off that GFI switch. Well,
[39:46] I thought, my goodness, what in the
[39:48] world's going on? What's going on? And
[39:49] we kept on working with it. We went took
[39:51] it and plugged it in on another uh
[39:53] outlet so we could it would actually uh
[39:55] operate in a different part of our
[39:57] kitchen. And then so the next morning
[39:59] when I got up, I took that thing and I
[40:00] plugged it back in. Plugged it back in
[40:02] and it kept on popping that GFI. Popping
[40:05] that GFI. I would put that thing back in
[40:07] and reset it. And eventually I'd have to
[40:08] go downstairs. I I thought for a moment
[40:10] I thought, man, I'm going to have to
[40:11] call Brother Sean and and ask him to
[40:13] take a look at this here cuz I don't
[40:15] know what's going on, you know, and and
[40:16] I'm thinking, man, what am I going to
[40:18] do? I mean, how do you start a day
[40:20] without Jesus and coffee? I don't know
[40:22] how you do that, you know. But um at at
[40:26] any rate, we look at this and I found
[40:29] out when we got to looking at it online
[40:31] that actually what it was, it was
[40:33] showing that there had actually come a
[40:35] fault in that heating element. It had
[40:37] shorted. there was something that was
[40:38] wrong. I mean, you would say, "Duh,
[40:40] Brother Samuel, the GFI is kicking out."
[40:42] But sometimes you don't know. Is it the
[40:44] GFI switch that's wrong or is it the was
[40:46] it the coffee maker? Surely, I didn't
[40:48] think it was a coffee maker, but you
[40:49] know what it caused us to do? I took
[40:51] that thing and I then started plugging
[40:52] it in and plugging different things even
[40:54] into that outlet. And sure enough, we
[40:57] singled it down to that's what that is.
[40:58] And that's how it is within our lives.
[41:01] There's sometimes we we can't maybe
[41:03] figure out how is the current why is the
[41:05] current not flowing through my life the
[41:08] way that it ought to be because you know
[41:09] there's nothing wrong with with the love
[41:11] of God. There's nothing wrong with the
[41:12] Holy Ghost. You you're standing in that
[41:14] place to know that you've passed from
[41:16] death unto life. But maybe there's
[41:18] through the the the the circumstances of
[41:21] life through tests and through trials
[41:22] and and things have come up that
[41:24] sometimes there might have come a little
[41:25] bit of a short in your life and you
[41:27] realize that this is where you have to
[41:29] look at first because our lives was
[41:32] meant to be a channel. Jesus called us
[41:35] branches and a branch doesn't bear bear
[41:38] fruit of itself but it bears fruit of
[41:40] the vine. And so it's actually to be a
[41:43] channel that God would actually work
[41:45] through. And you know, God takes
[41:46] channels. God doesn't take channels like
[41:48] you and I or individuals that you and I
[41:51] would maybe so much look at. You know,
[41:53] we would have chose instead of Abraham
[41:55] and Sarah, while you know, if we were
[41:56] looking at bringing forth a promised
[41:58] son, we would have surely chose people
[42:00] who were actually able to accomplish
[42:03] that task. Surely, we wouldn't have
[42:05] chosen those that would have been barren
[42:07] and so forth. But God uses channels and
[42:10] he'll take the weaknesses and things
[42:12] that would be in our lives, even
[42:14] throughout of of the accumulation of
[42:16] things that's happened throughout our
[42:18] lives sometimes because there's not one
[42:20] of us that has come here through a
[42:22] perfect situation. We all have baggage.
[42:25] Baggage the prophet called it the grabag
[42:27] of life of things that we we have within
[42:30] that. And God in his grace knew all
[42:32] about that. And God would so pour in his
[42:35] life into our lives. And then we come
[42:38] into these moments. We come to these
[42:40] times where it absolutely takes us being
[42:43] able to surrender and to submit every
[42:46] one of our weaknesses in his presence.
[42:48] But you know, it's not just something
[42:50] and I want to just say it just maybe as
[42:52] easy as we would just say it as far as a
[42:54] switch. But it takes the right
[42:56] atmosphere in order to actually release
[42:59] fear from our life and be able to break
[43:01] it down to where that we actually feel
[43:04] at peace in his presence and to know
[43:07] that he already knows our weaknesses. He
[43:10] knows all of these things as the Bible
[43:11] tells us in Hebrews 4 that all things
[43:14] stand open or naked before him. He knows
[43:17] it already, but he's waiting on us to
[43:20] actually be be able to present whatever
[43:23] it might be. Whatever the weakness is,
[43:25] whatever the situation, God wants us to
[43:28] present it to him. And then he'll step
[43:30] right in and work right through our
[43:31] lives. That's exactly what he did when
[43:33] he took the disciples and asked them to
[43:35] look upon the field. Said they're white
[43:37] for harvest. He already knew what was
[43:39] needed as far as that there was needed
[43:41] laborers in the field. But he said,
[43:43] "Pray ye the Lord of harvest that he
[43:45] will send laborers into the vineyard."
[43:47] You see, many times this is where
[43:49] sometimes when we can look, there can be
[43:51] a disconnect. We hear the word being
[43:53] preached. My, how we're just so thankful
[43:55] to God. And and many times you begin to
[43:57] realize this and even as you grow in
[43:59] your walk with God that it's more than
[44:01] just a good service. Because a good
[44:03] service does not mean that it's the
[44:05] right kind of songs being played or my
[44:07] favorite songs or my favorite melody or
[44:09] my favorite preacher. It's not about
[44:11] that. when we can actually grow beyond
[44:13] those types of things and say, "Lord,
[44:15] I'm not here to come come to see a man.
[44:17] I might have my preferences just like
[44:19] you have your preferences, but I I don't
[44:21] want to I don't want to limit God to my
[44:24] preferences, but I want God to work in
[44:26] such a way. As a matter of fact, that's
[44:28] part of our growing. That's part of
[44:30] overcoming in our life to be able to
[44:32] actually overcome and go beyond our own
[44:35] human preferences and say, "Lord, you
[44:38] know what I need tonight?" And God can
[44:41] can take a gift that he's placed within
[44:43] a man's life, a person's life, and so
[44:45] speak through that that gift to you and
[44:47] I to where what we see is Jesus Christ.
[44:50] And the whole thing that we need to be
[44:52] able to see is what do we do after the
[44:55] service is over? What do we do after
[44:58] it's over? You know, after the after the
[45:00] the prayer of benediction and the song
[45:02] of take the name of Jesus is sung,
[45:04] that's not the time that actually the
[45:06] service ends. It's actually where God in
[45:09] a service has commissioned each and
[45:11] every one of us of the things that we
[45:13] would need to pray about in our own
[45:15] life. It always amazes me how God can
[45:18] take a service and we could all get
[45:20] together after the service and there's
[45:22] certain things you would get, certain
[45:24] things you would get, certain things you
[45:26] would get. How can that possibly be that
[45:28] that one man? Well, it's not one man.
[45:30] It's God himself. And as the word is
[45:33] being preached, you begin to find
[45:35] yourself garnering in to the spirit of
[45:37] God. And you begin to see things in a
[45:40] way that you have never saw things
[45:42] before. And just because we see it
[45:44] doesn't mean that it's going to come to
[45:46] pass in our life. It all begins with
[45:48] agreeing with the word, submitting to
[45:50] the word. But God also places it in our
[45:53] charge for us to actually pray about it.
[45:56] Many of the times there's things to
[45:57] where that there's things that maybe we
[45:59] don't pray like like we should. and ask
[46:02] God upon the things that he's speaking
[46:04] to our lives. Because every service,
[46:06] friends, should be a personally tailor
[46:09] fitted service that God has so fitted it
[46:12] for our needs.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of God we serve.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; So we don't show up to a service and
[46:17] say, "Man, I didn't need that service. I
[46:18] could have just stayed home tonight."
[46:20] But if we're really looking to see Jesus
[46:23] and we want to see him, that's what we
[46:26] want. We want to not only see him, I
[46:28] want to be more like him. So you don't
[46:30] want the ideas of Samuel Browning. You
[46:32] don't want the image of Samuel Browning
[46:34] because God don't want none of us to be
[46:36] like one another. He wants us to be like
[46:38] Christ. And so it should actually be
[46:40] Christ in one another that we long to
[46:42] see. Cuz after all as being the real
[46:45] attributes of God who we're actually
[46:47] fellowshipping with. It's not so much
[46:49] the flesh and blood, but it's the
[46:51] attributes of his spirit that are
[46:53] attribute sons and daughters of God. And
[46:55] that's why our fellowship is in the
[46:57] spirit. Because in the flesh, my we will
[47:00] let one another down. We'll disappoint
[47:02] one another. And God will allow that to
[47:04] be tested as he brings a body together.
[47:07] Why would God do that? He would allow
[47:09] that would be done in order to bring out
[47:11] more of himself in that of the
[47:14] perfection of his own life working
[47:17] through us. So this is the brotherhood.
[47:19] This scripture love one another. This is
[47:22] a it's a reciprocal word. In other
[47:24] words, what's being expressed, it should
[47:27] actually flow as a great conduit that
[47:29] like just like that electricity that I
[47:31] that I that I I spoke about when we got
[47:34] that new coffee pot. My got right on the
[47:36] way, ordered that new coffee pot, had it
[47:39] set up then the next day of the same
[47:41] same kind. And you know what? Everything
[47:43] working fine. Everything flowing. The
[47:45] current was flowing. Everything was just
[47:47] right. And you know what? God has to
[47:49] work. And he'll work in our lives
[47:51] because he knows there must be that
[47:54] reciprocal flow. His his love, in other
[47:56] words, when his love so comes into our
[47:59] life and flows into our life, it should
[48:01] not look any differently out of our
[48:03] lives as it did from his life. You might
[48:06] say, "Well, brother Samuel, he was God."
[48:09] But remember, he came down not only to
[48:11] be the blessing, but to share the
[48:13] blessing. And if he made a statement in
[48:16] the word and he would say that we are to
[48:18] love as I have loved you, then there's
[48:21] no way that we humanly can actually be
[48:24] able to attain to that outside of divine
[48:27] intervention. And it will take the
[48:28] divine love of God coming through and by
[48:30] the new birth. And it will actually take
[48:33] that word working in our life, the love
[48:35] of God. And let me just say it to you
[48:37] where you are tonight in your walk with
[48:39] God and even with the love of God in
[48:41] your life, you've not reached the
[48:42] climax. You've not reached the pinnacle
[48:45] because when that when that climax has
[48:47] been reached, the rapture goes. But all
[48:50] along through there is a growing. So
[48:52] don't allow the enemy to shame you, make
[48:54] you feel bad. When you're looking at the
[48:56] word and you say, "My, I need to pick it
[48:58] up right here. My I need to pick it up
[48:59] right there." That's a good sign as a
[49:02] sheep is following the shepherd and is
[49:04] absolutely recognizing that in this
[49:07] atmosphere of the Holy Spirit, he's not
[49:09] come to shame me, not come to condemn
[49:11] me, not come to put me down, but he's
[49:13] come here to encourage me that in the
[49:16] walk and to do what? That the his own
[49:18] life might come forth through our life.
[49:20] So this reciprocal, it's it's to be that
[49:23] same love that is to actually be working
[49:26] through the body of Christ. Now you
[49:28] might ask and say, "Well, brother
[49:30] Samuel, aren't we to express this love
[49:32] even to others that are not even apart
[49:35] and apart within that of the body?" Yes,
[49:38] but yet at the main same time, this is
[49:40] where the challenge is going to come.
[49:42] This is where the rubber will meet the
[49:44] road is when it actually comes down
[49:46] among your siblings, our family. Because
[49:50] you know, when you get among family,
[49:52] family has a way that everything
[49:54] sometimes can become common. We can see
[49:57] one another's shortcomings so well. We
[50:00] know one another's shortcomings. But
[50:01] this is why that God would even allow
[50:04] even and bring together a body of
[50:06] believers. Because you know why? There's
[50:08] not one body that is perfect. And
[50:10] there's not one person in that body that
[50:13] is perfect. But God has so assembled it
[50:16] in such a way that the love of God might
[50:18] triumph in each of our lives to so
[50:21] subdue our own humanity to the love of
[50:24] God dwelling on the inside. So to think
[50:27] of this how that even where it would be
[50:29] written you know beloved what manner of
[50:32] love is this that we should be called
[50:35] the sons of God. So God never called us
[50:38] sinners. He never called us pigs. He
[50:41] never called us goats. This message does
[50:43] not go around calling us that. But what
[50:45] the message tells us, you were always a
[50:48] son and daughter of God, but it calls us
[50:50] to recognize, don't allow that goaty
[50:53] nature to reign over your life no
[50:54] longer. Don't allow that pig nature to
[50:57] reign over your life no longer. You were
[50:59] called to a higher walk. And that higher
[51:01] walk is in Christ. And so this is where
[51:04] the love see God God's not in the
[51:06] business of shaming you because if he
[51:08] shames you to get you here, he'll have
[51:10] to shame you to keep you there. See, God
[51:12] doesn't bind his people to him by fear.
[51:14] False teachers do that. But God comes
[51:17] through his word and he will actually
[51:19] unite you with love and divine love. And
[51:22] that's what creates such a peace and an
[51:24] atmosphere that actually growth can take
[51:27] place within our life. Now when you
[51:29] think of it, it's it's like that as we
[51:31] said of of a family that where the
[51:33] family itself even within a father or a
[51:36] husband, you know, within the initiating
[51:39] to set the groundwork of what will
[51:41] actually be the home, how will the home
[51:44] actually be controlled, how will it be
[51:46] run, how will all of these things be
[51:48] done. And so God did not leave this up
[51:51] to anyone else to figure out, but he
[51:54] came himself. He was the example as I
[51:57] have loved you. And he was letting it be
[51:59] known that as I have loved you. Think
[52:01] about this. There was not a reciprocal
[52:04] that was going around because they could
[52:06] not actually be able to receive that of
[52:09] the agape love and turn around and
[52:11] project it right back to the Lord Jesus.
[52:14] Even when Peter was asked, "Do you love
[52:16] me?" He said, "Do you agape me?" He
[52:18] said, "I feel thee. Do you agape me? I
[52:21] feel thee." See, he was not able to
[52:23] express what God was calling for because
[52:26] he had not come to that place of
[52:29] complete death to himself, which that on
[52:32] the day of Pentecost would bring that
[52:34] part to where you had reached something
[52:36] entirely different about Peter. No
[52:38] longer do you find this about Peter. You
[52:40] don't find him living the same kind of
[52:42] life. What took place? The love of God
[52:44] moved in and took complete control over
[52:46] his life. Same thing about John. John
[52:48] who was ready to call fire down from out
[52:50] of heaven. What happened to John? John
[52:52] got in the presence of God and John was
[52:55] changed from death unto life. He
[52:57] received the impartation of God's own
[52:59] life and here it was the love of God
[53:01] that was moving through John's life. Now
[53:04] think about this that when we look at
[53:06] this within that of a family and how
[53:09] that God would so set the groundwork
[53:11] that truly the groundwork itself would
[53:14] be that of his spirit dwelling on the
[53:16] inside which is his love which also is
[53:19] his word. Now notice how Peter would
[53:22] write this. He said, "Seeing ye have
[53:24] purified your souls in obeying the truth
[53:29] through the spirit." Now notice, obeying
[53:31] the truth through the spirit. So, so
[53:34] simply taking in of the truth actually
[53:37] brings purification.
[53:39] It will bring cleansing. Now, this is
[53:42] how far that that cleansing is to go.
[53:44] And notice how Peter when he even put
[53:47] this measure in his own as one an
[53:49] experience of his own life unto
[53:51] unfeigned love of the brethren.
[53:56] My so to come to that degree that you
[53:59] would say well brother Samuel the
[54:01] evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost is
[54:03] to be able to receive the word for your
[54:05] day. I agree the prophet said genuine
[54:08] faith in the word of God. But remember
[54:10] you can't have faith without love.
[54:13] Perfect faith. Love produces faith.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; And faith is based on forgiveness.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Is that right? So notice how this would
[54:23] be wrote that you have taken the word of
[54:26] God in. And notice Peter would give this
[54:28] by the spirit of God. Here's a little
[54:30] bit of a measuring stick that you know
[54:32] cuz sometimes what it is, it's hard for
[54:34] us to see and measure our own selves.
[54:37] And sometimes depending on how you're
[54:39] made up, you can ever you can seem so so
[54:41] beneath and so below. And neither should
[54:43] we ever get up here as though we're
[54:45] we're something, you know, and my we've
[54:47] arrived. But yet at the same time, God
[54:49] doesn't want you to walk around, you
[54:51] know, with a frown and beat down either.
[54:53] He wants you to understand that your new
[54:54] birth is not your adoption, but your new
[54:56] birth only puts you in position to begin
[54:59] growing. God does not expect you to be
[55:01] perfect when the Holy Ghost has come. He
[55:04] expects the perfection of his life to
[55:06] work in you and bring forth perfection
[55:08] in your life. That's his achievement in
[55:11] our lives. So notice this. In obeying
[55:14] the truth through the spirit unto
[55:17] unfeign love of the brethren, see that
[55:19] you love one another with a per a pure
[55:22] heart fervently. Notice that next part
[55:24] in there. See to it that you love one
[55:27] another with a pure heart fervently. So
[55:30] now this is a responsibility. It isn't
[55:32] just well you know here it is I I I've
[55:34] come to that place of un unfeign sincere
[55:37] sincere a real love for the brethren in
[55:40] my heart not just for the brothers that
[55:41] I like know that we want to get out of
[55:43] that filio realm we've have to reside
[55:45] down on the inside of that real true
[55:48] love for the brethren recognizing them
[55:52] as brethren part of the same family of
[55:55] God and to notice that we would have
[55:57] that responsibility to love see that you
[56:00] love one another with a pure your heart
[56:02] fervently. So, this is not something,
[56:04] this next part of the verse, I'm not
[56:05] going to dwell on this tonight, but that
[56:07] next part of the verse is not something
[56:08] that the Holy Ghost is just going to do
[56:10] for us. It will take him doing it, but
[56:12] it'll take us submitting to him and
[56:14] allowing him to come to the forefront,
[56:16] but the responsibility comes on us. It's
[56:19] kind of like in the tabernacle in the
[56:21] wilderness where God had different
[56:22] porters. Some were over that that of the
[56:25] meal. Some had to make that of the the
[56:26] the the oil of the apocryphe and all
[56:29] those things like that. they they
[56:30] themselves were responsible in order to
[56:33] see that the work of the tabernacle
[56:36] would go forward. What was needed would
[56:38] always be there. And that's the same way
[56:40] that God entrusts you and I. That's why
[56:42] he wrote in Jude, keep yourselves in the
[56:44] love of God.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; So what's entrusted? It's not just,
[56:47] well, I'm just here automatically. No,
[56:49] no. It It's something that we must keep
[56:51] guard and blinging oursel because
[56:54] constantly with this life and this
[56:57] world, it's constantly wanting to try to
[56:59] pull us out of the presence of God.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; I'm not just talking about keeping you
[57:04] out of church. I'm talking about wanting
[57:05] to keep you out from God's presence. If
[57:08] he can do that even on, you know, on a
[57:10] daily, my here you are going along just
[57:12] a wonderful time during the day and all
[57:14] of a sudden if he can in any way just
[57:16] like in a service try to somehow get
[57:18] gloom over you or try to bring up your
[57:20] past or try to bring up something where
[57:22] you're a failure and you entertain that
[57:24] for a moment. I don't have to tell you.
[57:26] You know what happens because that's not
[57:28] just a thought. That's a spirit that's
[57:30] trying to anoint you with doubt. You
[57:32] say, "Well, I don't doubt God's word."
[57:34] But when you're entertaining that
[57:36] against the word that said, "My little
[57:38] children, sin, let's sin not." But if we
[57:41] sin, we have an advocate with Jesus
[57:43] Christ, the righteous. If we confess our
[57:46] sins, he is faithful and just to forgive
[57:49] us. I am not going to doubt his word.
[57:51] I've stood on that word and when I've
[57:54] confessed that sin from my heart,
[57:55] whatever it is, shortcoming, it has
[57:57] dropped in the blood of Jesus Christ and
[58:00] God don't remember it no more.
[58:05] But you see, why would Satan want to do
[58:07] that and try to anoint you with that
[58:10] unbelief? Why would he want to do it in
[58:12] that way? Because as soon as you begin
[58:14] to entertain that, then immediately it's
[58:16] like breaking of the channel when you
[58:18] entertain that and you are called to be
[58:20] a channel. You're not called to produce
[58:22] the word. You're not called to produce
[58:24] works. You're not called to make things
[58:26] happen. We are called to be channels
[58:29] that are available for him.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; My my my. So notice in the scripture
[58:35] where it says if that same spirit that
[58:37] raised up Christ from the dead dwell in
[58:40] you, it shall also quicken your mortal
[58:43] body. So however this life it worked in
[58:46] him, it will make our mortal body come
[58:50] to the same expression.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; I want to remind you when you got the
[58:56] Holy Ghost, it wasn't your spirit that
[58:58] died.
[59:00] It wasn't your body that died.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; It was your soul.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; It was a nature.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; And God, when the Holy Spirit has come
[59:10] into your life, then what? Then here you
[59:13] have out of three parts of your life,
[59:15] body, spirit, and soul, onethird of you
[59:18] is redeemed and twothirds are not.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[59:23] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; And this is why that we can never treat
[59:26] the other twothirds as though they're
[59:27] redeemed. their possessions.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; You bring it in subjection by the
[59:32] authority of the Christ of God in your
[59:35] hearts.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Now notice within this, as it would
[59:39] state within the scripture, being born
[59:41] again, not of corruptible seed, but of
[59:43] incorruptible by the word of God, which
[59:45] liveth and abideth forever. Now watch
[59:47] how John would write this in 1 John
[59:49] chapter 3. We know that we have passed
[59:53] from death unto life because
[59:57] we love
[59:59] &gt;&gt; the brethren.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; I want to be very specific here. He
[1:00:02] didn't say because we love everybody.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; This is a love just like within your
[1:00:08] home. You love your children. Now, I'm
[1:00:11] just going to tell you, if you love
[1:00:12] everybody else's children better than
[1:00:13] your own children, you got a problem.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; And you're going to have problems in
[1:00:17] your own home.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because it should be that God has
[1:00:20] so channeled and given you those
[1:00:23] children,
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Well, well, this one over here, I I
[1:00:26] don't have a problem with taking them
[1:00:27] and showing them how to do things on the
[1:00:29] lawnmower and this and that. Right. God
[1:00:30] didn't give you that other person to do
[1:00:32] that, too.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Maybe as your children pass on through,
[1:00:35] but God entrusted and gave you those
[1:00:37] children to you and that love is to be
[1:00:40] poured out upon them. Now, I know we
[1:00:42] spoil them and everything else, but the
[1:00:44] reality is is love also has a lot of
[1:00:47] correction in it, too. And correction
[1:00:49] doesn't always mean the belt or the rod
[1:00:51] or all that of chasing. But correction
[1:00:53] can actually be the expression of
[1:00:55] showing what's the right thing to do and
[1:00:58] living the what is what is the right way
[1:01:01] to live. So even within this when we
[1:01:04] consider this this standard that would
[1:01:06] be set forth of how that we know we've
[1:01:09] passed from death unto life because we
[1:01:11] love the brethren. I wonder I wonder how
[1:01:13] many John when John would write this
[1:01:16] right here. Remember this is the same
[1:01:18] one that was ready to call fire down
[1:01:19] from Samaria. Now he had quotes on this.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; You see before the Holy Ghost came, he
[1:01:26] loved quote wars.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Preach, brother Samuel.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; You see, that was a clear sign that even
[1:01:34] when Jesus, cuz the Holy Ghost couldn't
[1:01:35] have come yet, but Jesus even told him,
[1:01:37] you don't even know what spirit you're
[1:01:39] of. If you're wanting to destroy
[1:01:42] somebody, whether it's online or
[1:01:44] whatever more, that's a wrong spirit.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; And listen, friends, we already have
[1:01:49] enough against us.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; I don't care how wrong a man is, we are
[1:01:53] never anointed by the spirit of God to
[1:01:56] tear down one another.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; That's not the Holy Ghost.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; So good.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:02:04] I'll tell you what that is. That's
[1:02:06] called a selfish spirit.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; It's called a critical spirit. And the
[1:02:09] only way that a person can ever get in
[1:02:11] that place because they're not dwelling
[1:02:12] down in the camp with a pillar of fire.
[1:02:14] They're up there on the fundamental
[1:02:16] altars of Balum.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Got to be careful how how fundamental
[1:02:21] you become. You want to be fundamental,
[1:02:23] but you want to be fundamental with the
[1:02:24] spirit of God in your life. Because with
[1:02:27] the spirit of God in your life, you can
[1:02:28] look and thank God for his grace and
[1:02:30] hold that same grace for somebody else
[1:02:32] and know that his grace is sufficient
[1:02:35] just as it is for you. And that's where
[1:02:37] we want to dwell is the pillar of fire.
[1:02:38] We don't want to get up here on the high
[1:02:40] places where you can look down and all
[1:02:42] you see is hind departs. If all you're
[1:02:44] seeing is hinder your parts, well,
[1:02:45] brother Sam, all I see is faults. All I
[1:02:47] see is failures. You're not dwelling in
[1:02:50] the camp of the supernatural like you
[1:02:53] ought to be.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's preachers. I don't
[1:02:56] care who it is. If you're not dwelling
[1:02:59] in the camp of the supernatural, you
[1:03:01] know, I'm preaching Bible to you. I'm
[1:03:03] preaching the message right there where
[1:03:05] the pillar of fire, right in the midst
[1:03:07] of the camp when God was right there.
[1:03:09] Sure, we've got problems. Sure, there's
[1:03:12] situations. But when we're dwelling
[1:03:14] where we ought to be, then we can
[1:03:16] recognize God's grace for one another
[1:03:18] just as it is for us. What is it? It's
[1:03:20] reciprocal.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; It's reciprocal.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; So good.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:03:28] He that loveth not his brother abideth
[1:03:32] in death.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Whosoever hateth his brother is a
[1:03:37] murderer.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; And ye know that no murderer hath
[1:03:41] eternal life abiding in him.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Remember brother would tell us over and
[1:03:46] over, you don't have to be a murderer
[1:03:48] with an actual knife
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; to destroy somebody.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; You can tear down their character.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; So good. Well, brother Samuel, they're
[1:03:59] wrong. Listen, let me just say this to
[1:04:00] you. If they're wrong and you go and
[1:04:04] begin to knife their character, what if
[1:04:07] God uses that channel to help one of
[1:04:09] your children
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; or would desire to do that?
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; But what's been happened is that
[1:04:16] confidence and respect has been
[1:04:19] diminished.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; That's where it becomes a
[1:04:23] responsibility. I'll tell you if there's
[1:04:25] anything at all if we got any
[1:04:27] grievances. Oh, brother Sam, I got
[1:04:28] grievances. Well, the place to put
[1:04:30] grievances is not out on the internet.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; And it's actually not to call one
[1:04:35] another and give one another grievances.
[1:04:37] I'll tell you a place to go,
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; is to the Lord in prayer.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Because what real brotherly love will do
[1:04:44] is the prophet said, you begin to put
[1:04:47] yourself in his shoes.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:04:55] I say, "Lord Jesus, help us
[1:04:58] sir."
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Notice this. Hereby perceive we the love
[1:05:02] of God because he laid down his life for
[1:05:06] us and we ought to lay down our lives
[1:05:11] for our buddies at work
[1:05:15] for our natural gene pool.
[1:05:19] Brother, you're saying I'm not to love
[1:05:21] my family. I'll tell you what he said
[1:05:23] right here. Lay down our lives for the
[1:05:25] brethren. But sometimes
[1:05:27] we're willing to lay down our own lives
[1:05:29] more for our flesh and blood
[1:05:33] than we are for the family of God.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Now, sometimes that laying down
[1:05:40] sometimes it can come through
[1:05:42] compromising. Sometimes it can come, oh,
[1:05:44] we'll go to great lengths for our
[1:05:47] natural family. I'm not saying that we
[1:05:49] shouldn't have a love and a care for our
[1:05:51] family, but neither should listen to me.
[1:05:54] Our love and our care for our family
[1:05:57] infringe upon our God-given rights.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm just going to help my family
[1:06:04] out.
[1:06:05] Brother, I won't be able to be there for
[1:06:07] months on end because I'm going to help
[1:06:08] them out.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; You I'm not the principal. you don't
[1:06:13] have to give me a tardy slip or an
[1:06:15] exemption that you got to take that up
[1:06:16] before God.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; But I think there's some things we have
[1:06:20] to really evaluate. But if we're not
[1:06:22] careful, we'll lay down given things.
[1:06:25] And if we're not careful, it only begins
[1:06:27] right there. Reason on this, reason on
[1:06:30] that, reason on that, and where we at?
[1:06:32] We're living outside of our God-given
[1:06:34] ground. We're living right out here in
[1:06:36] this realm of the twothirds that's
[1:06:38] unredeemed.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; And we've got reasoning for it. We've
[1:06:41] got we can go right in the scriptures,
[1:06:43] you know, in James. But yet, it's it's
[1:06:46] amazing that the scripture itself, one
[1:06:48] scripture should interpret another
[1:06:50] scripture,
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; that's good.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; You know, there's a word that it's a
[1:06:56] simple word. It has two letters. It's
[1:06:58] no.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Over the years, sometimes in counseling
[1:07:03] where I've had to tell different ones.
[1:07:04] You know, sometimes what it is is
[1:07:06] sometimes there's individuals that I
[1:07:08] begin to realize over the years with
[1:07:09] pastoring that what it is, it isn't
[1:07:11] necessarily so much that they want to
[1:07:13] help people. It's that they have a need
[1:07:16] or an issue in their life they've never
[1:07:18] dealt with. Maybe they've been rejected
[1:07:22] or never appreciated in the right way.
[1:07:24] So, they're always reaching out to want
[1:07:26] to try to do things. And in yet, it's
[1:07:28] really not from the genuiness of really
[1:07:31] wanting to do it. It's about to try to
[1:07:34] satisfy. Listen, friends, I'm not
[1:07:35] putting anybody down. I think one of the
[1:07:37] things we want to look at is let the
[1:07:39] word examine our lives.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Because if not, you
[1:07:42] see how the enemy plays upon those
[1:07:44] things in our life. He'll take things
[1:07:46] that have been complexes, the things
[1:07:48] right there. I'll never forget when
[1:07:50] going through, you know, to many times
[1:07:51] when I've talked with different things.
[1:07:52] It can be situations and all of a sudden
[1:07:54] here I am in the middle of counseling
[1:07:57] and when and the presence of God comes
[1:07:59] down and something is uncovered that
[1:08:01] happened years and years and years ago.
[1:08:04] And that person said, "Oh my goodness,
[1:08:06] this happened here, here, and here." And
[1:08:08] they begin to realize what these things
[1:08:11] is still having an effect on their life,
[1:08:13] on what they're taking on. And then they
[1:08:15] can almost feel guilty if they say, "I'm
[1:08:19] sorry.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; I just can't do that."
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; That's good. That's right.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that we can take things to
[1:08:26] God in prayer.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; I I just you you know me well enough by
[1:08:29] now right now. I've never told anybody
[1:08:31] don't do this and you do this and you do
[1:08:33] that. I'm not If you come to me for
[1:08:34] that, save your time. I'm not tell I'm
[1:08:36] not here to tell you what to do. But if
[1:08:38] God will allow me, I will ask you
[1:08:40] questions that I don't want answers to,
[1:08:42] but I want you to think about those
[1:08:44] questions. Yeah.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Do you pray about those questions?
[1:08:47] Because these are questions that if God
[1:08:49] gives those questions, it's for us to
[1:08:51] reflect and decisions and choices must
[1:08:54] be made by us as individuals. How in the
[1:08:58] world did I get here?
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; But who so hath this world's goods and
[1:09:05] seeth
[1:09:06] his brother have need, and shutth up his
[1:09:10] boughels of compassion from him, how
[1:09:12] dwelleth, now watch this. This is key
[1:09:14] word because John will write of the love
[1:09:16] of God not as something that comes and
[1:09:19] goes
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; because you see the real outpouring of
[1:09:22] the Holy Ghost is not something that
[1:09:24] just falls upon our spirit and then it
[1:09:28] pulls back. That's not the coming of the
[1:09:30] Holy Ghost. Sure, the rain falls on the
[1:09:33] just and unjust, but the coming of the
[1:09:35] Holy Spirit according to the word and
[1:09:38] the word alone will lead and bring forth
[1:09:41] a new birth to every predestinated seed
[1:09:44] that receives the word of God down into
[1:09:47] their soul. And it will no longer be it
[1:09:50] will not just be something coming and
[1:09:52] something leaving, but it will actually
[1:09:54] God takes up his abode. He abides. He
[1:09:58] dwelleth in our life. And that is even
[1:10:00] when we don't feel like it.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; That's good. That's good.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; He's abiding still cuz he said, "Lo, I'm
[1:10:07] with you always."
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; So good.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; And so he teaches us even in our
[1:10:10] beginnings of our walk with him as a
[1:10:13] faithful father not to depend on our
[1:10:16] feelings. Now some some of us maybe how
[1:10:18] we're made up, you know, we're maybe
[1:10:20] been made to rely upon our feelings.
[1:10:22] We've lived by our feelings so long. So
[1:10:23] it isn't just something when the Holy
[1:10:25] Ghost has come there's a light switch
[1:10:26] and we're no longer living by our
[1:10:28] feelings. As a matter of fact, we've got
[1:10:29] to continue to battle against our
[1:10:31] feelings cuz no doubt some of us did not
[1:10:34] feel like being here tonight,
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Some of us didn't feel like certain
[1:10:39] things. You're not saying, "Man, I know
[1:10:40] it's truth." Cuz sometimes with the
[1:10:42] pressures and circumstances, it would
[1:10:44] have been more comfortable to have been
[1:10:46] at home. But you see, even right here,
[1:10:48] in that simple way, you have had to
[1:10:51] bring your feelings, no matter how real
[1:10:53] they were, in subjection to the word of
[1:10:55] God. That's the same way when our
[1:10:57] feelings get out of line with one
[1:10:59] another. Same way when our feelings get
[1:11:01] out of line with our husband or our wife
[1:11:03] or our children, we've got to bring them
[1:11:05] back in subjection. You know why? If you
[1:11:07] don't do that, you are not a fit channel
[1:11:10] for the Holy Spirit to move through.
[1:11:13] And he will not do that. I probably
[1:11:16] won't get to those quotes tonight. I
[1:11:17] could tell by time. But you know, look
[1:11:20] at this. Dwelleth the love of God in
[1:11:23] him. How dwelleth it? So he sees a need
[1:11:27] and shutth up his bows. You know,
[1:11:29] sometimes it isn't that we've missed the
[1:11:31] needs. Let me read the last scripture.
[1:11:33] My little children, let us not love in
[1:11:35] word, neither in tongue, but in deed and
[1:11:40] in truth.
[1:11:42] How many of you thankful that God became
[1:11:43] one of us?
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; About five of us. How many of you
[1:11:47] thankful that he went to Calvary,
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; shed his blood,
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; right? Thankful he got up on that Easter
[1:11:54] morning.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Thankful he sent back the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Now, what was that? Was that just a
[1:11:59] word?
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Was that just a I love you.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; What was that? It was him.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; He saw the need in our lives.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus was observant of others.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; He even the others. This was not even
[1:12:22] anything spiritual.
[1:12:25] They're hungry.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; We need to provide something for them.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; They've come to this meeting.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Now, what if Jesus would have, you know,
[1:12:34] played the spiritual route? Well, we're
[1:12:36] here for spiritual food and due season.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; What does it matter about the natural
[1:12:41] food that perishes anyhow? Sometimes
[1:12:43] those statements are made because of
[1:12:45] mothballs in the wallet.
[1:12:49] That's good.
[1:12:50] Sometimes those statements are made out
[1:12:53] of those things. They're not made out of
[1:12:54] a spiritual part, though we'll try to
[1:12:56] cover it up with quotes and everything
[1:12:58] else. But listen, friends, we're not
[1:13:00] fooling anybody, even our own selves
[1:13:03] within it. So notice to see to see a
[1:13:06] need. I I think in this hour, if Jesus
[1:13:08] was that observant, it was not because
[1:13:10] he had some spectacular DNA. Remember,
[1:13:13] he was made in the likeness of sinful
[1:13:16] flesh. He had to go through the same
[1:13:19] things that you and I go through. He is
[1:13:21] a faithful and merciful high priest,
[1:13:23] deity of Jesus Christ. One of the many
[1:13:25] places Jesus was tempted with sexual
[1:13:28] temptation, tempted by women, tempted
[1:13:30] with drinking, tempted with all these
[1:13:32] things, but yet he remained and he was
[1:13:36] able to be able to resist temptation. He
[1:13:40] felt the pull to give in to the easier
[1:13:42] way with through the midst of
[1:13:44] temptation. But in order to be the right
[1:13:46] kind of a mediator and then the
[1:13:49] sacrifice for you and I, he withtood
[1:13:51] that temptation that then with the
[1:13:53] coming of the Holy Spirit, he might be
[1:13:56] the right kind of a mediator through you
[1:13:58] and I where we can go to him and say,
[1:14:00] "Lord, I know it's not like they're
[1:14:02] spitting on me, but I feel like spit is
[1:14:04] on me, Lord. I I Lord, how that is and
[1:14:06] they're not pulling things a beard out
[1:14:08] of out of my chin, but I feel like it,
[1:14:10] Lord. I feel like they're pulling
[1:14:12] virtue. I feel like they're pulling
[1:14:14] this, but Lord, I need strength, Lord. I
[1:14:17] need help, Lord God. And you know what's
[1:14:19] happening during that time? It is you
[1:14:21] and I being melded down and the very
[1:14:24] love of God on the inside that will
[1:14:26] allow itself to become expressed in our
[1:14:29] lives through divine opportunities that
[1:14:32] have been orchestrated.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; By God.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:14:38] that's great. Yes, sir.
[1:14:40] So sometimes this very simple thing
[1:14:43] right here, this scripture, I know
[1:14:44] probably reading this scripture right
[1:14:46] here, I probably could have just put a
[1:14:48] big dollar sign right there cuz some
[1:14:51] think that's how we help one another,
[1:14:56] but that's not limited to that. I know
[1:14:58] it's very, very simple. You know,
[1:15:00] Brother Brandham's mother, I'm just
[1:15:01] going to go with as it comes. You know,
[1:15:03] Brother Brham's mother, Brother Brandham
[1:15:05] tells us when he sits there and how when
[1:15:07] brother Neville came in to see his
[1:15:08] mother, he said, "You know what?" He
[1:15:09] said, "I've visited many sick folk and
[1:15:11] I've done that." He said, "But I never
[1:15:13] knew how much it meant
[1:15:15] until when I seen brother Neville
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; and then I seen some of you saints
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; come and visit."
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Then brother Brandon will take up in the
[1:15:22] beginning of the message indictment.
[1:15:24] Remember talking about Edith? Edith
[1:15:26] Wright's going through a great time in
[1:15:27] her life. She's actually passing through
[1:15:29] the change and the time of life. Brother
[1:15:30] Brandham takes a little bit and expounds
[1:15:32] on those changes within our life. And he
[1:15:34] says, "Look," he said, "It it'd be good
[1:15:36] for you if if different ones of you, not
[1:15:38] all at once now,
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; but little by little,
[1:15:43] go out and visit her.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; And don't tell her she looks bad. Tell
[1:15:48] her she looks good."
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Samuel, I I'm in for the deep
[1:15:55] things. These are the deep things.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz if we've got all the doctrine
[1:16:01] right and we don't have this part right
[1:16:03] here, we're still lacking.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; So how can even some of the things be
[1:16:07] expressed? Well, you know what? I've
[1:16:09] watched sometimes some things also
[1:16:10] checked seen responses and things
[1:16:12] sometimes. You know, I can remember that
[1:16:14] even some years ago and it doesn't have
[1:16:16] to rely upon just one person to be the
[1:16:18] ring leader to get meals together. Oh,
[1:16:21] this sister so and so. If you've got a
[1:16:22] burden on your heart, you do it.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Get it together. you allow those things
[1:16:27] to be done because listen, there's no
[1:16:29] one greater, no greater one among us
[1:16:31] here than another. And I think of it
[1:16:33] when different ones of us have been
[1:16:34] sick. I know you think, brother Samuel,
[1:16:36] you're going awful carnal on this
[1:16:38] tonight. I'm just trying to show you of
[1:16:40] a different way sometimes where things
[1:16:42] can be attended to to help out the body.
[1:16:46] And I know we might look at and say,
[1:16:47] "Well, I don't need this or or they
[1:16:49] don't need that. They're they're wealthy
[1:16:51] and they don't need this or they don't
[1:16:52] need that." It isn't that they need
[1:16:54] money. Right. Amen.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; They might be millionaires,
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; but what they need is to see the
[1:17:01] expression of Jesus Christ through the
[1:17:04] brotherhood.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; So, so it's not always money. That's why
[1:17:15] when you think about having relationship
[1:17:17] with your children, it ain't all about
[1:17:19] money,
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; You don't have to have money
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; to have relationship. Take them here,
[1:17:24] take them there. You could have all the
[1:17:26] money in the world. You could take them
[1:17:27] to Disney World. You could take them
[1:17:29] here, take them there, and still not
[1:17:30] have relationship.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; That's true. That's true.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; It's not about money.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; It's with love. And God teaches us how
[1:17:42] to submit and how to do what's important
[1:17:45] and minister to that one.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Everyone, as I've said before, even our
[1:17:51] boys, you know this within your family,
[1:17:52] you got multiple children. Everyone's
[1:17:54] different. You also know even in the
[1:17:56] approach to it certain times, right? You
[1:17:59] might have the greatest plans in the
[1:18:01] world. Maybe it's your wife, your
[1:18:02] husband. You got the greatest plans in
[1:18:03] the world. My, you got everything lined
[1:18:05] up
[1:18:07] and all of a sudden,
[1:18:10] where' these cats and dogs start raining
[1:18:12] from?
[1:18:14] And you know what it does? Let's just be
[1:18:16] honest. It gets under our skin.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; You know why? Ain't going as we had it
[1:18:22] planned.
[1:18:23] That's okay. I'll say I'll preach and
[1:18:24] say amen for you
[1:18:27] because there things is just not going
[1:18:28] as it's planned. But you know what? God
[1:18:31] God knows exactly what he's doing. And
[1:18:33] through all of these things, even as we
[1:18:34] work with one another, it isn't Let me
[1:18:37] just tell you something, friends.
[1:18:38] There's no such thing as, "Oh, this was
[1:18:39] a problem in church." Or, "Oh, I tell
[1:18:41] you, I've got this going on at home or
[1:18:43] this with my children." Listen, let me
[1:18:44] just tell you something. Those types of
[1:18:46] things like that are not, "Oh, if I
[1:18:48] could just get this out of the way." No.
[1:18:50] God uses these very circumstances. Yes,
[1:18:54] sir.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; That are pulling on our strings that we
[1:18:56] would like to just open the door and get
[1:18:58] them out.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Samuel, lay hands on me.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Lay hands on me tonight. Brother Samuel,
[1:19:04] speak the word over me. Oh God. Lord,
[1:19:07] let it come tonight, Lord. And and just
[1:19:09] Lord Jesus, just turn her heart
[1:19:11] completely. Turn his heart completely.
[1:19:13] And
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; don't we?
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; That's right. Sometimes the way very
[1:19:17] ways that we're praying about for change
[1:19:19] and God is saying, "No, you're going to
[1:19:22] be my hands."
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; You're going to be my feet.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; And in order to be my hands or my feet,
[1:19:28] you're going to have to change your
[1:19:28] thoughts about this.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Remember, the feet of William Brandham
[1:19:33] became the feet of the Holy Ghost that
[1:19:34] night in Oregon.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham had to change his
[1:19:38] thoughts how he was thinking about that
[1:19:40] man.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. So then to see these things
[1:19:45] how God will allow sometimes friends
[1:19:46] listen it isn't just even in the
[1:19:48] preparation of foods and we get in those
[1:19:50] things and and build that all up and and
[1:19:53] you're doing that you know you know what
[1:19:54] that says when you you you you you do
[1:19:56] something like that for somebody else
[1:19:58] even right here in the body you know
[1:19:59] what that says that expresses love it
[1:20:02] expresses care that you're more than
[1:20:04] just somebody that I think I know your
[1:20:06] name I think you go to church yeah you
[1:20:08] go you're yep yep you're you're in my
[1:20:10] church yep you're on the directory it's
[1:20:11] more than at
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Samuel, I'm tired. The
[1:20:18] prophet, let me just give you this
[1:20:19] words. When he showed up at his house
[1:20:21] and all that chaos was going on,
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; here's brother Ram's exact words in one
[1:20:25] of the quotes. He said, I was tired.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; He had had people walking through the
[1:20:30] house all day. I've got a word from the
[1:20:31] Lord, thus sayith the Lord, if you don't
[1:20:33] listen to me and this and this and this
[1:20:34] and that.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon had all that,
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; He called it mental cases. He had that
[1:20:39] going on in the house. Then plus on top
[1:20:42] of all of the other spirits being cast
[1:20:44] out of sicknesses and whatever more.
[1:20:46] Think about what kind of a turmoil that
[1:20:48] would be in the home.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Cuz after all, they didn't have a 3,000
[1:20:51] foot home.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; It wasn't even they didn't even have the
[1:20:55] add-on at that time that you can drive
[1:20:57] by and see right now on the house.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Didn't have that. And here all of this
[1:21:01] is actually going through. As a matter
[1:21:02] of fact, Brother George told me it was a
[1:21:04] very, very small house that they lived
[1:21:05] in originally. I mean, it was
[1:21:07] unbelievably how small it was. I think
[1:21:09] it was, you know, it might have been a
[1:21:10] little bit bigger here than the
[1:21:11] platform, but think about all of that
[1:21:12] was going on within there. Well, it made
[1:21:14] no wonder that anybody would be crazy.
[1:21:16] But brother Brandham here, he steps in.
[1:21:17] He says, "I'm tired, but Lord, what
[1:21:19] would you have me to be in this
[1:21:23] situation?"
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Now, this is how I'm going to do it. No,
[1:21:27] he said, "What would you have me be,
[1:21:30] sir,
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; in this situation?" Because every
[1:21:32] situation's different.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; I'm sure every one of us, you've tried
[1:21:36] to replicate
[1:21:39] He's honest.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; The rest of us is honest, too. I say,
[1:21:43] "Amen." Try to replicate and you begin
[1:21:45] to realize and God brings you to certain
[1:21:47] times. I remember that even working with
[1:21:49] kids. God taught me that right there.
[1:21:50] You can't replicate those things.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; God will have things that just blow up
[1:21:54] your replication.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because God wants us
[1:21:58] depending on his leading.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; It always is. Lord, what would you have
[1:22:05] me to be in this situation?
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it isn't even that of of food.
[1:22:10] But I'm I just say it to you like this
[1:22:12] tonight. When there's different ones, it
[1:22:14] should not be in this hour that we don't
[1:22:16] know. Oh, who's sick among us?
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, really? Oh, really? So and so had
[1:22:21] surgery?
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; How can that be missed?
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; We not only have an app, we have email,
[1:22:29] have all the other communications that
[1:22:31] are going on. Listen friends, you might
[1:22:33] think this is carnal, but it's not
[1:22:35] whatsoever.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; These are very things right here. He who
[1:22:38] seeth his brethren need, but you see
[1:22:40] where everything is at in this hour,
[1:22:43] this life that we're living in, it's a
[1:22:45] time, listen, the pressures are greater
[1:22:48] than they ever were. That's a sign of
[1:22:51] the oncoming Exodus.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; The pressures are not are not are not
[1:22:56] lessened. Many of you have more
[1:22:58] responsibilities than you ever had,
[1:23:01] right?
[1:23:02] It's like how you know you know when to
[1:23:04] be able you you walk away from your desk
[1:23:06] or whatever it is and you realize you
[1:23:08] never come into a spot of where
[1:23:10] everything is cleaned off and it's
[1:23:11] orderly. You just recognize when to walk
[1:23:14] away from work and say this is enough.
[1:23:17] It'll be here tomorrow.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; And for some of us that's overcoming in
[1:23:22] our own makeup.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Right? And God's working through that.
[1:23:27] See, we can look at think, oh my, this
[1:23:29] this but God's working even out his will
[1:23:32] through our own lives just to trust him
[1:23:33] and knowing when to just even step back.
[1:23:36] But to think that within this Satan's
[1:23:38] desire is to so overwhelm our lives.
[1:23:41] Listen friends, he knows in this hour
[1:23:43] that what this message is called to
[1:23:46] produce is brotherly love. If it does
[1:23:49] not produce that, the capstone cannot
[1:23:52] come down. But it will produce that.
[1:23:55] That's what this will do. Remember the
[1:23:58] honey that was poured in the rock box
[1:24:01] and the prophet was was spoken it will
[1:24:05] stick. What was he saying? That the same
[1:24:07] water that has went through the rock box
[1:24:10] and has sealed each one down through the
[1:24:12] ages where their faith has become a
[1:24:15] supernatural faith. That honey being
[1:24:17] poured in by the messenger in that rock
[1:24:20] box, it will move and it will hold. What
[1:24:23] will it hold? It will hold a bride
[1:24:25] together. It will bring the very
[1:24:28] resurrection of the dead by the working
[1:24:31] of the supernatural in our life because
[1:24:33] they without us
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; should not be made perfect.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; The achievement in an age, we're not
[1:24:41] just talking about hate. If we're
[1:24:43] talking about becoming love, we see in
[1:24:46] this age
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; the personification of hatred.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:53] People shoot people they don't even
[1:24:54] know.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; They disagree with them. You see where
[1:24:58] we're at in this hour
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; over the time it's already been all the
[1:25:01] way down through the age. Remember it's
[1:25:03] coming into such a place within this
[1:25:05] hour. These demon spirits people don't
[1:25:07] even know what they're doing. That's why
[1:25:08] listen I don't I don't feel bad at the
[1:25:10] person. It's what it is is that they're
[1:25:12] overtaken with spirits.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Think about it. If you could go and talk
[1:25:16] to many of these people who are on death
[1:25:17] row and other things else then look they
[1:25:19] don't even realize what took hold of
[1:25:21] them.
[1:25:22] Yeah,
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; it's a spirit that took hold of them.
[1:25:25] That's the same way it was in the days
[1:25:26] of Noah. The earth was filled with
[1:25:28] violence through them.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; It wasn't just violence out here. There
[1:25:32] was channels.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Channels that absolutely accepted those
[1:25:38] thoughts,
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; those demonic anointing
[1:25:42] and got them people in such a case of
[1:25:45] ready for destruction by getting in the
[1:25:48] spirit of destruction. And the prophet
[1:25:50] said, if there if the world as it is now
[1:25:53] getting in the spirit of destruction,
[1:25:55] then God is also here to bring his
[1:25:58] people into the spirit of rapture of the
[1:26:02] Holy Ghost.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; So to think of this, it's not something
[1:26:09] that when we cons when we consider what
[1:26:11] would be the perception how he laid down
[1:26:13] his life. Who did he go to Calvary for?
[1:26:16] Who did Jesus go to Calvary for? Did he
[1:26:19] need to pay for his own sins?
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; No. He had no sin. He had nothing to
[1:26:24] repent of.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; When he walked into the water to be
[1:26:27] washed, he didn't have to walk in there
[1:26:28] for repentance.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; He was he was the lamb that was to be
[1:26:32] washed. Also, the high priest that was
[1:26:33] to be washed and later anointed,
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; So, he did none of this for himself.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; But the Bible said who for the joy that
[1:26:43] was set before him. What was that joy
[1:26:46] right here tonight?
[1:26:48] that he would be able to see you in your
[1:26:50] right mind, me in my right mind, to be
[1:26:53] able to be free from the hold of drugs
[1:26:56] and pornography and all these other
[1:26:58] things. He would be able to see the joy
[1:27:00] where there's such a love of God in your
[1:27:03] heart for him and for his word. He did
[1:27:06] that.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; That he might bring to you.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; What he knew lay within you because it
[1:27:12] was part of himself.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; That lays within you. That's
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:27:17] You were always part of this family.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; You were like one of those long lost
[1:27:23] people. Found it. One of the men one
[1:27:26] time he's a didn't even realize who he
[1:27:28] was tied into. He loved this Navajo
[1:27:30] music playing the flutes and playing the
[1:27:33] music. Then he realized it. New Jersey.
[1:27:37] Finally one day everything gets traced
[1:27:38] down
[1:27:40] and realizes
[1:27:43] he's Navajo.
[1:27:47] the very things that he liked all of his
[1:27:49] life, it was something that was in him.
[1:27:52] I've also watched I've just studied over
[1:27:54] the years at different times when these
[1:27:55] things will come across I just put them
[1:27:56] in separate studies and categories and
[1:27:58] look at them. You look at certain things
[1:28:00] and sometimes it can be so traumatic.
[1:28:01] You find with on individuals that when
[1:28:04] they find out that where where they are
[1:28:06] at and oh this is you know really not
[1:28:07] you know maybe they like one one
[1:28:09] particular young lady she was actually
[1:28:10] stolen from the hospital by a nurse but
[1:28:14] yet actually raised as though she was
[1:28:17] her own and then when she finds out
[1:28:20] she's not it's was devastating to her. I
[1:28:22] want you to understand that real in real
[1:28:25] reality, you and I, I don't care if you
[1:28:27] were raised by natural parents or not.
[1:28:30] I'm whether it was grandparents or
[1:28:31] whatever more. Let me just tell you, you
[1:28:32] had a heavenly parent
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; that never ever lost sight of you.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; He knew exactly what you would be swn
[1:28:40] in. Knew exactly all of the complexities
[1:28:43] of life. He knew all the mistakes. So,
[1:28:45] let me just tell you something. Don't
[1:28:46] try to go back and, oh, if I could have
[1:28:48] lived, if I could have redone this, if I
[1:28:49] could have redone that. You can't redo
[1:28:51] it. But what you can do is go forward
[1:28:55] from today.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; There is grace right here tonight to
[1:29:01] make a decision to where you're not
[1:29:03] dwelling back there. That's a trick and
[1:29:06] a trap of the enemy to get you to
[1:29:08] reminisce down memory lane. But allow
[1:29:10] God's grace to be so great and poured
[1:29:13] into your life. Allow him to express the
[1:29:17] laying down of his life. He knew how low
[1:29:20] you and I would be. And he went lower
[1:29:22] than where we were
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; that he might lift us
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; to where he is.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; The truth. Amen.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Man,
[1:29:36] the Lord.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me just read this first
[1:29:40] little part and I'm I'm just going to
[1:29:42] close.
[1:29:47] I want you to think about this. The
[1:29:48] first thing that Pentecost produced.
[1:29:52] Many times when we think of that term of
[1:29:55] Pentecost, we think of great
[1:29:59] dynamics of power.
[1:30:02] And it is. It's God's. It's God's power.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; It was due, right? That which is able to
[1:30:09] blow up open the channels. What's been
[1:30:12] clogged up in our life, it's able to to
[1:30:15] free us. That's exactly right.
[1:30:17] We we needed that
[1:30:20] in our lives. We needed that joy. We
[1:30:22] needed that liberty,
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; that that jubilee, that part that brings
[1:30:26] us back to who we are. But the very
[1:30:29] first thing that Pentecost produced
[1:30:31] after the coming of the Holy Spirit, the
[1:30:33] very first thing that the Holy Spirit
[1:30:36] produced
[1:30:38] was that of brotherhood,
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; divine love. Let me read the first
[1:30:42] little part of this. The first thing
[1:30:45] that Pentecost produced, in other words,
[1:30:48] was a product of it was brotherly love.
[1:30:54] This is why that a person can can never
[1:30:56] be able to say, "Well, I really I tell
[1:30:59] you what, I so love this message and
[1:31:01] can't get along with anybody."
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; You might agree with the truth.
[1:31:09] And to be able to say, "I believe it."
[1:31:10] Remember the prophet says that only
[1:31:12] shows you can read,
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:31:14] But you've got to have the token,
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Because the token is the life of the
[1:31:19] covenant. That's what makes the word
[1:31:22] live.
[1:31:24] That's the love of God from our hearts.
[1:31:28] Not to know him, not to know the word is
[1:31:30] life, but to know him,
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; the author. Is that right?
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Now, notice this.
[1:31:37] It tore down the middle wall of
[1:31:40] partitions
[1:31:41] and made a brotherhood.
[1:31:44] to such a way that they had everything
[1:31:46] in common in the Bible days of
[1:31:50] brotherhood.
[1:31:52] Now they were as different as night was
[1:31:55] from day.
[1:31:58] Listen friends, before the Holy Ghost
[1:32:00] came, they were here spatting, even
[1:32:02] walking behind the Lord Jesus.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Who's going to be the greatest?
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; What was that that came among them?
[1:32:10] spirit
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; started comparing themselves to one
[1:32:16] another. God don't want you comparing
[1:32:17] yourself to one another.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; That's that's the greatest downfall.
[1:32:21] We're not to compare where we compare
[1:32:23] ourselves is with the word. It's it's
[1:32:25] incredible how Satan will use this.
[1:32:26] He'll use comparison
[1:32:29] to cause people to elevate. Oh, I feel
[1:32:31] pretty good. I tell you, not like some
[1:32:34] people in the church.
[1:32:37] Not like this one. There's a scripture
[1:32:40] that says, "God, I thank you that I'm
[1:32:42] not like that publican."
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Better be careful.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; I don't care because that publican, they
[1:32:55] might only be in justification,
[1:32:57] but God might be waiting to temper you.
[1:33:00] And the love of God expressed through
[1:33:02] your life because life comes through the
[1:33:05] body, right?
[1:33:07] Hello.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Seeing that there's a need maybe with a
[1:33:11] a sister or a brother. Well, I'll just
[1:33:13] wait and let let brother Samuel do it.
[1:33:15] And it's true that brother Samuel can
[1:33:17] go. But I want you to understand, I'm
[1:33:19] only one person.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Understand, I'm not here tonight with a
[1:33:22] table and signing up like for the army.
[1:33:25] I'm just trying to tell you is that
[1:33:26] don't underestimate
[1:33:28] what God has done in your life.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be a walking quote
[1:33:33] book.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:35] You don't even have to be a walking a
[1:33:38] walking Bible as far as as you can quote
[1:33:40] every scripture. I listen I understand
[1:33:43] study to show thyself approved. But
[1:33:45] sometimes sometimes
[1:33:48] people need somebody
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; with God with skin on it
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; to be a friend to help them during their
[1:33:57] journey. Think back how it was with your
[1:33:59] life.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Think back how it was some of the
[1:34:01] different ones when you came to the
[1:34:03] Lord. Think about how it was
[1:34:05] I know certain sometimes our our minds
[1:34:07] need to be recalled to these things. I I
[1:34:09] know I'm closing. I'm closing. Our minds
[1:34:11] need to be recalled to remember these
[1:34:13] things because sometimes we get over
[1:34:14] here and we forgot how we got here.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; And if we're not careful, then we turn
[1:34:19] around and are looking at everybody else
[1:34:21] and saying, "Well, glory to God. What in
[1:34:23] the world's wrong with them?" Have you
[1:34:24] forgot
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; what God did for you?
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; That there were others who you know what
[1:34:31] took you under their wing?
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:34] And they didn't run your nose in the
[1:34:35] dirt. They didn't, you know, berate you.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; They expressed
[1:34:42] Christ to you.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; My my
[1:34:51] Can we go another couple hours?
[1:34:57] Let's stand.
[1:35:01] A brotherhood.
[1:35:04] Say, "May God help us."
[1:35:06] May God help us.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Am I my brother's keeper?
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; I am.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Where's Abel at? How should I know?
[1:35:22] How should I know?
[1:35:27] See, sometimes it isn't just even about
[1:35:29] that. What about your wife, your
[1:35:31] husband, your son, your daughter? What?
[1:35:32] How?
[1:35:34] What about a brother? What about a
[1:35:35] sister? And sometimes I wonder I wonder.
[1:35:40] We're not asking I'm not asking you to
[1:35:42] come around and be prophetic. We're
[1:35:44] under a prophetic word. But God's not
[1:35:46] God's not asked you and I to operate as
[1:35:48] a prophet. He don't want me to be a
[1:35:50] prophet as a pastor. If he wanted that,
[1:35:53] he'd have made me that. Sure.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; So, as a pastor, the only way that I can
[1:35:58] operate is, oh, sure, there's things
[1:35:59] that God will show me from time to time
[1:36:01] and things that he he'll want me to see.
[1:36:03] But, you know, as a pastor, a pastor is
[1:36:05] the ox of the team. And you know what an
[1:36:08] ox, he's got, oh, it's four feet on the
[1:36:10] ground.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; So, whatever's been told me that's in
[1:36:14] the heavenly, I should see it on the
[1:36:16] earth.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; If if the heavenly what's said in the
[1:36:20] heavenly, it's not matching up on earth,
[1:36:22] something's wrong. something's wrong.
[1:36:27] And so this is where that as a pastor,
[1:36:30] God would use that and operate even
[1:36:33] within the pastor to minister within
[1:36:36] these different things. But God's not
[1:36:38] asked us
[1:36:40] to have discernment. Oh, I see so and
[1:36:42] so's getting a little cold. I see so
[1:36:45] Look, you might have that feeling on
[1:36:46] your heart. And you know what? If that
[1:36:48] comes to your heart for that person,
[1:36:51] go to them.
[1:36:56] Hello, church.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Go to him. Well, brother Sam, my life's
[1:37:00] too busy. You know what you're missing?
[1:37:01] You're missing a part of the divine
[1:37:04] expression.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; H how is the word going to be expressed
[1:37:08] through your life? Well, I just come to
[1:37:10] the house of God and man, I just feed on
[1:37:12] the word. But where's the expression?
[1:37:15] How is it expressed? If we're not
[1:37:17] careful, we become fat and sassy in the
[1:37:19] stalls
[1:37:20] and there's no expression in our lives.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; But you see, part of that expression in
[1:37:25] our life, that's part of your old
[1:37:26] growth. It's part of your overcoming.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you what, I could be I can be
[1:37:32] real brotherly with this with this
[1:37:34] brother right here. He's a good buddy.
[1:37:36] He's a good chum. But maybe that's not
[1:37:38] the one that God's showing you that's in
[1:37:41] need.
[1:37:49] Amen.
[1:37:52] I pray God
[1:37:55] forgive us.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; If we have to turn around and say, "What
[1:38:01] happened to so and so?
[1:38:04] What happened to brother and sister so
[1:38:05] and so? What happened to them?
[1:38:09] Well, why didn't brother Samuel make an
[1:38:10] announcement?"
[1:38:12] I wonder if even beginning here tonight,
[1:38:14] we could say, "God, help me to get out
[1:38:16] of my own world."
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Help me to get out of my own world.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; See, we're not, if we're not careful, it
[1:38:25] becomes very so easily about self.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; And we've got certain thoughts about
[1:38:31] self that somehow it exempts us. And
[1:38:35] that's not me. But God, he knows in our
[1:38:38] lives
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; and he brings us into that. Lord, help
[1:38:41] me to be as observant as you were, Lord.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Help me not to be consumed. I know we're
[1:38:47] we're burdened. I I I told you that
[1:38:49] we're burdened. Seems like we've got
[1:38:51] things more and the pressures and of
[1:38:52] this life and certain things. I agree.
[1:38:55] Probably you're the same way. I've got
[1:38:56] reminders on my phone of things to do
[1:38:59] this particular day. Matter of fact,
[1:39:00] I've got added some reminders that I've
[1:39:02] continued to two months down the road
[1:39:05] because it goes to this week, then this
[1:39:06] week, then this week, then this week,
[1:39:08] then this week because it's not really
[1:39:09] things that's maybe altogether pressing,
[1:39:11] but it's just all of a sudden with the
[1:39:13] toils of the day and you start looking
[1:39:15] at that and you're like,
[1:39:18] that can wait till tomorrow.
[1:39:21] Soon as we put it off to tomorrow and
[1:39:23] put over here
[1:39:26] and can I also say this? I'm I'm not
[1:39:28] going to keep you.
[1:39:31] Why don't we just allow the enemy to
[1:39:32] take any excuse from our lives
[1:39:36] or ask God to take it? Well, I'm not
[1:39:38] that good with people. I'm not that good
[1:39:41] here. I I fumble with words. I Why don't
[1:39:43] you say, "Lord,
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; I'm here.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; What you want me to be in this
[1:39:53] situation?"
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; What do you want me to be?
[1:39:58] see the words to be expressed through
[1:40:00] our lives.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's the simplest of things
[1:40:03] like this here tonight. I know we didn't
[1:40:05] really get maybe so far as what I have
[1:40:07] in my notes, but
[1:40:09] I believe God spoke to our hearts to
[1:40:11] challenge our lives.
[1:40:13] You know, I would say it like this as we
[1:40:14] get ready to pray. Brother Bram comes to
[1:40:16] the end of recognizing your day in its
[1:40:17] message. I I love Brother Bram's
[1:40:19] humility. I love Brother Bram's
[1:40:20] transparency. I love how Brother Bram
[1:40:22] just does not say, "I've got it." But I
[1:40:26] love how he says it at the right end of
[1:40:28] recognizing your day in its message.
[1:40:29] When he's praying, he said, 'Oh God,
[1:40:32] let me be the revival.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Create in me
[1:40:38] the revival. Create in me what's
[1:40:40] lacking, Lord. Make me to hunger. Make
[1:40:45] me to thirst. Create in me what's
[1:40:48] lacking. Make me more kinder. Make me
[1:40:51] more humbler. Make me more willing. Make
[1:40:55] me more of a servant. I say, "Yes, Lord.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord." That's what I want more of
[1:41:01] the Holy Ghost for.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; I want more of the Holy Ghost. I don't
[1:41:04] want more of the Holy Ghost to make me
[1:41:05] feel good.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Make me feel like a son and daughter of
[1:41:09] God. I I I'm I'm a son of God.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; You're a son or a daughter of God. But
[1:41:13] what I want is is I want to be more like
[1:41:16] him.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. and being more like him is Lord I
[1:41:18] don't want my mind anointed but anoint
[1:41:21] me
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; to express
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; you through my life
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; you loving tonight
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; let's pray heavenly father
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; you've been so gracious to us tonight
[1:41:34] Lord
[1:41:36] you know Lord each and every one of our
[1:41:38] needs
[1:41:40] Lord God every one of us not just those
[1:41:43] of us that are here Lord I've included
[1:41:45] myself right here tonight, Lord. Dear
[1:41:49] God, as we look in upon your word,
[1:41:53] we don't want to miss
[1:41:56] that part of an expression.
[1:41:59] Oh, I know where to be a a witness.
[1:42:01] That's true. To the outside world.
[1:42:03] That's true.
[1:42:05] But what would it be like, Lord, in our
[1:42:07] homes
[1:42:08] if there was no care
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; one for another?
[1:42:14] Oh Lord, it would be an awful cold, cold
[1:42:18] place.
[1:42:20] What would it be like, Lord, for parents
[1:42:24] that don't know what their children are
[1:42:26] doing? Teenagers, whatever. I don't
[1:42:28] know. They're up in their room. I don't
[1:42:29] know what they're doing. What would What
[1:42:31] kind of home would that be?
[1:42:34] But allow things, Lord, to accumulate
[1:42:36] sometimes
[1:42:39] things to build up and and then yet in
[1:42:44] the mind is apparent. Everything's good.
[1:42:46] Everything's okay.
[1:42:49] But Lord God, how we want to so emulate
[1:42:51] you, Lord. We want to reflect you. Lord,
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; it was in the evening time when you
[1:42:58] would come down and gather your
[1:42:59] children,
[1:43:01] ask them how their day had been.
[1:43:04] begin to express your love to them,
[1:43:06] Lord. Father, just like we heard last
[1:43:09] last week through brother Marcus, Lord,
[1:43:12] as you took your servant,
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; that's what you've done through the
[1:43:15] message. You've showed us what real
[1:43:18] fatherhood is, Lord.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; Husbands, so forth. But what would it
[1:43:23] be, Lord, if our lives, our homes
[1:43:28] were in that way?
[1:43:32] Lord, I know tonight
[1:43:35] that even if there is a home or homes
[1:43:37] that would say, "Oh,
[1:43:41] mine's mine's that way." But Lord God,
[1:43:44] may I pray tonight the grace of God is
[1:43:46] not here to condemn.
[1:43:49] But may Lord God, as they can look up to
[1:43:51] you to know that you're a restorer,
[1:43:54] that dear God, that you will take
[1:43:58] through the through the channel of their
[1:43:59] lives. It won't be, Lord God, of passing
[1:44:02] through a prayer line. We believe in
[1:44:04] them, Lord. I've stood over and over. I
[1:44:07] believe in praying, Lord God. I've stood
[1:44:09] many times, Lord, within a meeting and
[1:44:11] prayed for need after need after need
[1:44:12] after need. And we need that. But
[1:44:15] sometimes, Lord, the prayers within
[1:44:16] there, I think, as I've spoke with
[1:44:18] different ones and just been one-on-one
[1:44:20] with them, Lord God, and help them to
[1:44:22] see so they'd have the right expectation
[1:44:26] to where the enemy would just be drove
[1:44:28] back, Lord, from condemning them and
[1:44:30] beating them up, Lord, to where they
[1:44:31] could actually begin to look up like a
[1:44:33] son and daughter of God. And to know
[1:44:36] that, God, that you're going to use
[1:44:37] their hands,
[1:44:39] [Music]
[1:44:40] freeing them, Lord God, from that of
[1:44:42] guilt and other things in their life.
[1:44:43] and and you're going to use their lives.
[1:44:46] Oh God, that's the real miracle.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:44:52] help us, Lord.
[1:44:54] Lord God, I want to freshly
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; surrender
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; my life to you, Lord.
[1:45:03] Freshly these hands, these feet, these
[1:45:07] lips, this mind, this heart.
[1:45:12] Lord God, every gate of my spirit, Lord,
[1:45:15] grant it, Lord Jesus.
[1:45:18] Lord God, I pray, Father, for each and
[1:45:21] every one of us that are gathered here
[1:45:22] tonight. Lord God, help us.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; May you deliver us, Lord. Not just those
[1:45:29] that are gathered here, but Lord, this
[1:45:31] entire assembly. Oh God, it will take
[1:45:34] you to deliver us
[1:45:39] from our own little worlds.
[1:45:44] God, we don't want our own little
[1:45:45] worlds.
[1:45:48] [Music]
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; This is what Pentecost produced
[1:45:55] was a brotherhood.
[1:45:57] Not a click, not a clan, not a group
[1:46:02] of human beings gathered together. They
[1:46:06] did that back down in the Nimrod's Tower
[1:46:10] of Babel.
[1:46:13] But this was not a gathering
[1:46:16] of human beings
[1:46:19] vessels. Yeah.
[1:46:21] that you would immor, display your life
[1:46:27] where the attributes of God are
[1:46:29] assembled together,
[1:46:32] baptized
[1:46:34] into one body by one spirit
[1:46:37] inside
[1:46:39] of this great brotherhood.
[1:46:43] Oh, it's not a club.
[1:46:45] It's not something where one human
[1:46:47] admits another. No. No.
[1:46:51] You're the one, Lord. You're the one
[1:46:53] bringing every one of your children back
[1:46:56] home.
[1:46:58] You're the one that deals with our
[1:46:59] hearts. You're the one that's brought us
[1:47:01] to this place of submission. You're the
[1:47:03] one who baptizes us into yourself
[1:47:08] that God, this same life might dwell
[1:47:09] within us. And then we're part of the
[1:47:13] divine circuit
[1:47:15] where the love of God where we can
[1:47:17] actually begin
[1:47:21] to see this scripture fulfilled
[1:47:25] to love one another
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; as
[1:47:29] I have loved you.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Lord, help us tonight.
[1:47:35] This is where you call us even as
[1:47:37] husbands
[1:47:39] to operate with that same love.
[1:47:42] You help us Lord. You called us Lord
[1:47:45] Jesus as a body. Help us Lord.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Father I thank you Lord God for your
[1:47:52] word.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; But to see dear God how all of this
[1:47:55] would measure up. As Paul said though I
[1:47:58] can do many great things. We've been
[1:48:00] through that. and have not love, it's
[1:48:04] nothing.
[1:48:07] So Lord Jesus,
[1:48:09] it's the love of God
[1:48:14] that brings the value
[1:48:18] gives us the right understanding that's
[1:48:20] not an understanding of your word that
[1:48:23] looks down
[1:48:25] on others,
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; picks one another apart.
[1:48:29] Lord, we're not vultures. We're eagles.
[1:48:34] We're not meant, Lord, to feed on one
[1:48:36] another.
[1:48:38] Feed on one another's failures or
[1:48:39] mistakes.
[1:48:42] Not only here in this assembly, but
[1:48:44] throughout, dear God,
[1:48:46] I pray. Father,
[1:48:50] granted,
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Satan's busy enough to try to tear down
[1:48:54] this message and wanting to tear down
[1:48:56] this one and tear down that one. God
[1:48:59] help us. May we hold up the standard,
[1:49:02] Lord,
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; and to know that God, how many times
[1:49:05] that we have needed your grace and we
[1:49:07] still need it.
[1:49:09] Help us. That's the strength within the
[1:49:13] brotherhood
[1:49:15] of the love of God
[1:49:18] operating in our lives.
[1:49:20] Help us, Lord.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord.
[1:49:26] May our lives be an expression
[1:49:29] that God would be that of the redeemer
[1:49:31] reaching out to others and say we're not
[1:49:34] some club that you can't join.
[1:49:38] But if you're thirsty,
[1:49:42] there's a fountain to satisfy you. If
[1:49:45] you're hungry, there's spiritual food in
[1:49:47] due season.
[1:49:50] Needs within your life, problems, why?
[1:49:53] He's the one. and he'll take care of
[1:49:55] every situation in your life. Lord God,
[1:49:59] it's redeemer anointing that reaches out
[1:50:03] through us
[1:50:06] to invite others into this great
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; body of Jesus Christ.
[1:50:16] We don't give nobody the Holy Ghost, but
[1:50:19] the life travels through the body.
[1:50:22] So Lord help us.
[1:50:24] Help us Lord.
[1:50:26] Forgive us Lord. I pray and help us to
[1:50:29] have the right balance. Teach us Lord. I
[1:50:32] ask just as even we walk away from this
[1:50:34] service tonight would you just Lord even
[1:50:36] in our times of prayer Lord God as we
[1:50:38] would just come before you. Teach us.
[1:50:42] Help us not to say, "Well, when I
[1:50:43] retire." No. No. Cuz when we retire,
[1:50:45] we'll have a greater accountability and
[1:50:47] responsibility than what we had when we
[1:50:49] were working. But with what we have
[1:50:52] right now, little is much when God is in
[1:50:57] it. I believe Lord with all my heart,
[1:51:00] dear God, the joy of the Lord even in
[1:51:04] hearts and lives, we're going to see
[1:51:05] that joy return.
[1:51:08] Then Lord God, we can ask Lord, help me.
[1:51:11] Help me to have that balance because to
[1:51:14] let that joy flow through our lives. Let
[1:51:17] me be an expression to somebody else.
[1:51:21] Grant it, Lord. And not just out there,
[1:51:24] but right here in this assembly, maybe a
[1:51:27] call, a card, or as you spoke to us
[1:51:30] tonight, get meals together
[1:51:34] for different ones when there's been
[1:51:36] needs. Oh, I know we're we're not a big
[1:51:39] group. We're a little group, but God,
[1:51:42] little as much when you're in it.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; It ain't about trying to satisfy Z
[1:51:48] everybody's hunger. It's about that
[1:51:50] expression,
[1:51:52] I care about you, brother.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; I care about you, sister.
[1:51:56] More than just, well, it's in my heart.
[1:51:59] It's in my heart. But God, how can they
[1:52:01] see what's in our heart if it's not
[1:52:03] expressed?
[1:52:05] [Music]
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. Help us, Father.
[1:52:11] We love you, Lord. We appreciate you.
[1:52:15] In the name of Jesus Christ. Grant it
[1:52:18] Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:52:22] Oh glory. I don't know if you feel like
[1:52:25] me but I say Lord help me.
[1:52:29] Help me. A lot of things you can walk
[1:52:31] away and and pray about. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:52:36] Yeah.
[1:52:38] Let God work within our lives.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; If you start to feel like an excuse come
[1:52:42] up, say no.
[1:52:44] I'm not putting any excuse cuz you know
[1:52:45] what? There's no limitations. God, what
[1:52:47] would you have me to be in this time?
[1:52:50] Great leaders.

[2:05:56] we thank you for the word tonight, Lord
[2:05:57] God.

[2:06:05] believe the message tonight was let us
[2:06:07] not love in word, Lord. Not just in
[2:06:09] thoughts, but to love in deed, Lord
[2:06:11] Jesus. Help us to be ministers. We may
[2:06:14] not all be called to preach the gospel,
[2:06:17] Lord Jesus, or to cast out devils with
[2:06:19] these things, Lord. But, Father, we may
[2:06:21] never do those things, but we can still
[2:06:23] minister, Lord God, one to another,
[2:06:25] Lord. We can pray for one another. We
[2:06:27] can visit one another, Lord. we can call
[2:06:29] or text or all these ways of
[2:06:32] communication we have these days these
[2:06:33] phones that we've been given Lord to to
[2:06:35] be able to communicate so easily Lord
[2:06:37] God all it would take maybe something
[2:06:39] that would just encourage someone Lord
[2:06:41] Jesus and you could use us Lord to talk
[2:06:43] to them or to just send them a message
[2:06:46] say I love you brother appreciate you
[2:06:47] and praying for you Lord help us to
[2:06:49] become just as you came down you you
[2:06:52] didn't come in the in the Lord to be
[2:06:55] served you came to serve Lord and that's
[2:06:57] what we're here to do Lord help us. May
[2:06:59] we in prayer, Lord. Seek your face and
[2:07:01] say, "Lord, here am I. Send me. What can
[2:07:03] I do to help my brothers and sisters,
[2:07:05] Lord, may you grant it, Lord. May we
[2:07:07] become more like you, Lord Jesus." And

[2:07:11] we're washing your feet, Lord. We love
[2:07:13] you and give you thanks. Bless our
