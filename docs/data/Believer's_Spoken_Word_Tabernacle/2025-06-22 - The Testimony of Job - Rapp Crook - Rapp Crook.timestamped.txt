[36:52] morning?
[36:53] That's what I'm resting on. I'm resting
[36:55] not on not on me. I'm resting on what he
[36:58] said. Amen. And God has confirmed that
[37:01] word. There's no other place of
[37:04] certainty and rest and safety outside of
[37:08] Jesus Christ. But God has so confirmed
[37:11] his word in this hour. That's what the
[37:14] message of the hour came to do is to
[37:16] confirm God's promise that God has never
[37:20] had to take one word back. But every
[37:23] word that God has ever said, God has
[37:26] always kept. every word, every
[37:29] appointment.
[37:31] Amen. I believe he's got an appointment
[37:33] here this morning.
[37:35] Amen. So good to be together. Amen. So
[37:38] good to see each and everyone. And I
[37:41] just want to say it's just a real
[37:42] blessing. I'm thankful to have brother
[37:44] Rap here with us today. And uh I just um
[37:48] how many remember the last time he was
[37:49] with us here last July? And he preached
[37:52] that message on rest. Powerful message.
[37:54] Amen. And um well, I really I just so
[37:57] appreciate I appreciate God's diversity,
[38:01] you know, I mean, I like I like, you
[38:05] know, I like different foods and things
[38:06] like that, but you know, if you eat the
[38:08] same kind of thing all the time, and I
[38:10] know we're talking about God's word, but
[38:11] you know, God just has an approach,
[38:13] right? And I'm so glad that God didn't
[38:16] make every one of us the same, right?
[38:18] I'm glad. I'm glad that he didn't make
[38:21] Brother Rap like me. And you know, I may
[38:23] want to I maybe would like to preach
[38:25] like that, but
[38:27] that's not I'm glad that God has such a
[38:30] diversity and such a bouquet. And you
[38:32] know why? God has chosen through all of
[38:34] that that through every veil, through
[38:36] every vessel, we can look and see him.
[38:40] And you know why he's done that? Because
[38:41] he cares about us. God loves us. He has
[38:44] such a such a multifaceted approach, but
[38:48] his nature remains the same. Amen. And
[38:51] so we just so love the Lord, don't we?
[38:53] Amen. Let's just pull on the gift of God
[38:55] as we welcome brother Rap here this
[38:56] morning with us. Amen. And just reach
[38:59] out and just touch the Lord and let's
[39:00] just draw from him. I'd like to go back
[39:02] to that song, I feel like going on
[39:04] because that's that's true. Many tests,
[39:06] many trials, but we feel like going on.
[39:10] You feel that way this morning. Lord,
[39:12] your grace has held my hand through it
[39:14] all. It's been sufficient, and I feel
[39:17] like going on. Amen. I feel like going
[39:20] on.
[39:22] [Music]
[39:23] Oh, I feel like going
[39:29] on.
[39:31] No matter what comes, I feel like.
[39:36] Oh yes,
[39:38] his grace is sufficient.
[39:42] Oh, try
[39:44] your scum
[39:47] on every
[39:50] day.
[39:51] I feel like going
[39:56] on. I feel like going on.
[40:01] I feel like going
[40:06] on.
[40:07] [Music]
[40:09] Yes, I feel that going
[40:15] on.
[40:19] The trials
[40:21] come
[40:23] on every
[40:26] hand.
[40:28] I feel like going
[40:33] on.
[40:37] Amen. Lord bless you this morning. It's
[40:40] a real uh real honor to be here with
[40:42] you. Perhaps while we're standing, we
[40:44] can just turn in our Bibles to the book
[40:46] of James, chapter five. And uh
[40:51] it was uh I might think about this uh
[40:55] the sermon this morning being the uh the
[40:58] surrender of a perfectionist because I
[41:00] like to have everything finished on my
[41:02] notes finished exactly right. And I got
[41:04] to a point last night says it's not
[41:06] ready yet. It's not ready. I might have
[41:08] to go with something else in the
[41:09] morning. But I was going back and forth
[41:11] in the car and finally I just sitting
[41:13] back there and nope. We're going to go
[41:15] with what the Lord put on our hearts.
[41:16] We're just going to make him h ask him
[41:19] to make it perfect for us. That's what
[41:21] we're going to do today. But I just
[41:22] really appreciate the atmosphere here uh
[41:25] uh this morning. It's such a such a good
[41:27] spirit and it's good to be with you
[41:28] again. My James chapter 5.
[41:35] No, I haven't. No. Sorry.
[41:41] There we go. There we go. All right. Try
[41:44] to get the jitters out of the system.
[41:47] James chapter 5 and verse 11. Behold, we
[41:50] count them happy which endure. That's
[41:52] why I appreciated the the last song we
[41:54] sang. Uh I feel like going on. Feel like
[41:57] going on. That's that's what it's about.
[41:59] We count them happy which endure. You
[42:02] have heard of the patience of Job and
[42:06] have seen the end of the Lord that the
[42:08] Lord is very pitiful and of tender
[42:11] mercy. This is a special scripture for
[42:13] me personally because my son is named
[42:15] Job. And uh when my wife was pregnant,
[42:18] we went back and forth with different
[42:20] names. And one morning having my
[42:21] devotions, I read this scriptures. We
[42:23] heard of the patience of Job. And this
[42:25] is why where Job got his name. And I
[42:28] thought, man, I given a son the name
[42:30] like Job, which means one of the things
[42:31] is persecuted. Who does that to their
[42:34] kid? But I gave him the middle name of
[42:37] of Daniel. God is my judge. And that's
[42:39] what that's what Job wanted. But we'll
[42:41] just uh our our uh topic this morning is
[42:44] is the testimony of Job. Let's pray.
[42:47] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your
[42:48] goodness. Thank you for your grace,
[42:50] Lord, to us. Father, uh if we look back
[42:53] upon our own life's journey, um there's
[42:56] no way that we could have made it
[42:58] without uh without you holding us,
[43:00] without you carrying us. And I thank
[43:01] you, Lord, for bringing us thus far,
[43:03] Lord. I pray, Lord, that you would
[43:05] minister to each one here today in a
[43:07] special special way, oh God, in Jesus
[43:09] name. Amen. Lord bless you. May be
[43:12] seated. Brother Dave, Sister Shirley,
[43:15] good to see you all again. Good to see
[43:17] you. Very very good. Well, uh um last uh
[43:23] last year I uh it's been it's been a
[43:26] it's been a year of trial for my family.
[43:28] Me, my my wife's gone through a number
[43:30] of different uh things. She had to be in
[43:32] the hospital a couple times. I can
[43:33] remember back in uh it was about a year
[43:36] a about a year ago back in the beginning
[43:38] August or end of July had to take her to
[43:41] the hospital and I I I helped her check
[43:43] in. I came back and get things to take
[43:45] to to to bring to her and I was looking
[43:47] around.
[43:49] I've got a I've got a book on Job around
[43:51] here somewhere and I I Oh yeah. I bought
[43:53] this book six, seven years ago. never
[43:55] read it and I'm going to be reading this
[43:58] book and I've I I've been reading
[44:00] through it throughout the year kind of
[44:02] studying through it. Uh um personally I
[44:05] did a went through my Bible class at
[44:07] school. We went through each chapter of
[44:08] the book of Job. I was kind of
[44:10] surprised. It's one of those books that
[44:12] I think is really really hard to to read
[44:15] and it can be hard to understand because
[44:18] as Job and his friends as Job's friends
[44:21] are are talking to him, they're saying
[44:24] things that sound right some half the
[44:26] time. But remember, you can say the
[44:28] right thing to the wrong person. It's
[44:30] not quite meant to be. Um, so it's it's
[44:33] hard to it's hard to figure out
[44:34] sometimes. But one of the assignments I
[44:37] have my students do is they they keep a
[44:39] Bible notebook. I ask them to um to read
[44:41] at least a chapter of the Bible each day
[44:43] and they just write one verse down in
[44:45] their notebook and then uh if they do
[44:48] that just write a verse five days a
[44:50] week, you get you get a B on your
[44:51] assignment. And if you write a sentence
[44:54] or two about the verse, you get an A for
[44:56] the assignment. And I found personally
[44:59] there are times in my life when I keep a
[45:00] little Bible notebook like that, it has
[45:03] always helps me uh to get more out of
[45:06] the my Bible reading. It's almost uh as
[45:09] I start writing it down um um my my
[45:13] mental digestive system starts working
[45:15] and I start meditating on and sometimes
[45:17] just the act of writing it down things
[45:20] jump out at me that hadn't leapt out at
[45:22] me before. So every few weeks I'll
[45:25] collect my students Bible notebooks and
[45:26] just kind of make sure they did it. And
[45:28] I was surprised this last year that
[45:31] there were several students who picked
[45:33] the book of Job to read. They're
[45:34] thinking, "Guys, you were picking one of
[45:36] the most difficult books of the Bible.
[45:37] Make it easier on yourselves." But I
[45:40] thought, there must be something there
[45:42] that um that that that intrigues them.
[45:46] Well, we're going to spend some time
[45:47] going at it, going over it. And I was uh
[45:51] encouraged to see that brother Brandon
[45:53] was also one who was intrigued by the
[45:55] book of Job. He he says different times,
[45:57] he spent a year and a half, two years
[46:00] going through the book of Job. He said,
[46:01] "I had Job on the A sheep for about four
[46:04] weeks. Every Sunday is every Sunday,
[46:06] every Wednesday, Job on the A sheep." I
[46:10] think that's it's a valuable thing
[46:11] sometimes for us to kind of plow through
[46:15] certain parts of the scripture because
[46:17] we can we can get the big picture
[46:18] sometimes, but you can just go through
[46:21] in Bible study. He talks about you get
[46:23] nuggets all these different places and
[46:25] it becomes so much more meaningful. And
[46:27] he's talking about Job. He says, "Such a
[46:29] beautiful story. God dealing with his
[46:32] saint."
[46:35] His friends had the story wrong. His
[46:37] friends thought it was God dealing with
[46:38] a hypocrite. God dealing with a sinner.
[46:41] But no, it's God dealing with his saint.
[46:45] And how that we all get in those places,
[46:47] times of distress, and don't know where
[46:50] to turn. So perhaps we can just look um
[46:53] in Job chapter 1. Um I'm not sure how
[46:56] this is going to turn out today. It's
[46:58] kind of exciting for me as well because
[47:00] um I want to try to capture a couple
[47:02] themes of the book of Job without uh
[47:04] without if we if we try to go through
[47:06] chapter by chapter, we could be here a
[47:08] really long time. And that's not the
[47:09] purpose. Um but Job chapter 1. And when
[47:13] we look at Job chapter 1, we're going to
[47:16] see that if anyone ever had a so-called
[47:20] perfect life, it was Job and his family.
[47:25] in almost any metric of perfect, they
[47:30] would have had it. They they I I I
[47:32] imagine reading what they have, they had
[47:35] an Instagram ready life. Job had the
[47:39] perfect LinkedIn profile. Job had
[47:44] picture perfect kids who never caused
[47:46] any problems at at at school. Job and
[47:48] his wife, they knew just how to put
[47:51] their arm around each other and smile.
[47:52] Think, what a beautiful family. He had
[47:55] it in every single way. And then God
[47:57] looks at Job says, "Yeah, he's perfect
[47:59] and upright." He has it in every single
[48:02] way. Job chapter 1, there was a man in
[48:05] the land of Oz whose name was Job. And
[48:09] that man was perfect and upright and one
[48:13] that feared God and estued evil. What a
[48:17] testimony.
[48:18] Feared God, estued evil. Like I said,
[48:22] he's the picture of success in his walk
[48:24] with God, in his business, in his
[48:27] finances, in his community, his home and
[48:29] family. His substance was 7,000 sheep,
[48:33] 3,000 camels, 500 yolk of oxen, 500
[48:38] shies, and a very great household to
[48:40] take care of all this stuff. This man
[48:43] was the greatest of all the men of the
[48:47] east. and his sons. He has seven sons
[48:50] and three daughters. His sons went and
[48:52] feasted in their houses everyone his day
[48:54] and sent and called for their three
[48:56] sisters to eat and drink with them.
[48:58] These are this is a family who gets
[49:00] along. They enjoy being together. A
[49:02] family reunion isn't a matter to get
[49:05] nervous about. They enjoy being
[49:06] together.
[49:08] And so it was when the days of their
[49:10] feasting were gone about that Job sent
[49:12] and sanctified them, rose up early in
[49:14] the morning, offered burnt offerings
[49:17] according to the number of them all. For
[49:18] Job said, "It may be that my sons have
[49:21] sinned and cursed God in their hearts."
[49:24] And thus did Job continually.
[49:28] So as our story opens, like I said, Job
[49:31] seems to be living a perfect life. He
[49:34] has a a faultless testimony. I don't
[49:37] think that means he's sinless, but he's
[49:39] righteous before God. He has all the
[49:41] outward markers of God's favor. Um God
[49:45] just keeps blessing him and blessing
[49:46] him. His business undertakings meet with
[49:48] great success. His flocks and herds
[49:51] multiply. His sons and daughters are
[49:52] happy and healthy. There's no sign of
[49:55] family dysfunction here. He keeps his
[49:58] kids covered in prayer within his
[50:00] community. He's highly respected. And if
[50:03] we look over in Job 29, we can uh this
[50:06] is at the end. This is the very last
[50:08] speech that Job gives and he's looking
[50:10] back and he's remembering all the things
[50:14] how life was before before his life
[50:17] changed and and he reminisces and and
[50:20] that's it's kind of interesting to see
[50:21] his description of what his life was
[50:24] like and what he expected his life uh to
[50:28] end up as he's he's been accused all
[50:32] through the book of being a secret
[50:33] sinner. He's been accused of of of
[50:36] hiding things. He's he's been he's he's
[50:38] heard he's heard a lot. And then this is
[50:42] one of the last this is as he finishes
[50:44] speaking verse two. Oh that I were as in
[50:48] months past and when we're in the midst
[50:50] of a really dark time that's what we
[50:52] say. I wish it was like it was back
[50:54] years ago when and it says when I when
[50:59] um when God preserved me.
[51:02] You know what? If we're still here
[51:04] today, God is still preserving us. We
[51:08] might not experience it quite like we
[51:10] want to experience it, but God was still
[51:12] preserving Job
[51:15] because God told Satan, "You can do
[51:16] whatever you can, but you can't touch
[51:18] his life." That was the preservation of
[51:20] God. So, Job just couldn't see God in
[51:23] his trials. And that's when we get
[51:25] nervous. But we're going to keep on
[51:27] going here. I wish it were like in days
[51:29] past when his candle shined upon my head
[51:31] when by his light I walked through
[51:33] darkness and he just goes on how
[51:35] respected he is. Verse seven, when I
[51:37] went out to the gate to the city, I
[51:40] prepared my seat in the street. The
[51:42] young men saw me, they hid themselves.
[51:44] They were nervous to talk to this great
[51:46] man, Job. The aged men arose and stood
[51:49] up. They they revered Job in this
[51:52] testimony. The princes and the nobles.
[51:54] They held their peace, their tongue
[51:56] closed to the roof of their to the roof
[51:58] of their mouth. Job's experience has
[52:01] changed so much because when he's in his
[52:04] trial, he's outside the city. He's on an
[52:06] a sheep. He's the mo people make a mock
[52:09] of him. The kids probably throw stones.
[52:12] How his how his ex how his life has
[52:15] changed. The respect of men is uh is is
[52:19] is is fleeting. We we we shouldn't fear
[52:21] men. We should fear God. But Job's life
[52:24] has changed so much. And Job's reviewing
[52:27] his righteous testimony. This is kind of
[52:29] his life, his his last defense.
[52:32] Verse 14, he he sat in the gates of the
[52:34] city. He was a judge. He says, "I put on
[52:37] righteousness. It clothed me. My
[52:39] judgment was a as a robe and dyed him. I
[52:43] was eyes to the blind." I wouldn't let
[52:45] anybody take advantage of a blind
[52:46] person. I was eyes for the blind and
[52:49] feet was eye to the lame. I did justice.
[52:52] I was father to the poor and the cause
[52:55] which I knew not. I didn't just dismiss
[52:58] it. I searched it out to do justice. I
[53:01] broke the jaws of the wicked. Plucked
[53:04] the spoil out of his teeth. Job's
[53:07] looking at his life. I have done well. I
[53:09] have served God based upon what how I'm
[53:12] living my life. How do I think I'm going
[53:14] to end up?
[53:16] And this is where Job
[53:20] is wrong about something. because he
[53:22] says, "I've done all these righteous
[53:24] things." And he says, "I expect I will
[53:27] die in my nest. I'll be able just to
[53:31] live long happily ever after and die on
[53:35] my family estate because I've done all
[53:37] these righteous things." I mean, you
[53:39] know what? When you do righteous things,
[53:42] good things happen to you.
[53:44] Bad things
[53:47] don't happen to good people. That's kind
[53:50] of the te that's the only explanation of
[53:52] suffering
[53:53] that was alive at the time of Job. And
[53:56] Job bought into Job bought into it
[53:59] without realizing it. He said, "Look at
[54:00] all the good things I've done. I thought
[54:02] I would die in my nest. I'd multiply my
[54:05] days as the sand." His expectation was
[54:08] for a long and peaceful life growing old
[54:10] in his family estate to die in his nest.
[54:15] And I think Job here is it kind of
[54:17] describes uh brother Ram talking about
[54:19] the person who I'd rather be right in my
[54:23] heart and wrong in my doctrine.
[54:27] And Job's right in his heart. He you
[54:29] know are all of us 100% right in our
[54:32] doctrine. We're all going to be it's
[54:35] really hard to have with with with with
[54:37] human words to make statements about God
[54:41] that cover everything because God's
[54:43] infinite. We can't do that. So Job Job
[54:47] is walking as best he can the life that
[54:49] he knows. He his heart is right with God
[54:52] which means he can be corrected which
[54:55] means he's he's got a relationship with
[54:57] God. Because you can have somebody who
[54:58] has a superior statement of faith but
[55:01] doesn't know God. That's good. Yeah.
[55:04] That gets scary. Oswald Chambers uh
[55:08] writes this about Job. Says, "It must be
[55:11] remembered what Job's creed was." Job
[55:14] believed that God prospered and blessed
[55:17] the upright man who trusted in him. And
[55:19] the man who was not upright was not
[55:22] prospered. And then came calamity after
[55:26] calamity.
[55:28] Everything Job believed about God was
[55:32] contradicted.
[55:34] And Job's creed went to the wind.
[55:38] Amen. He had to hold on to God stronger
[55:42] than he held on to his creed. And
[55:45] sometimes you have to ask, do we hang on
[55:47] to God or to our belief about God? There
[55:51] you go. At best, our beliefs about God
[55:54] can only be an approximation
[55:57] because we can't define the infinite
[56:00] with finite vocabulary. So don't hang on
[56:04] too tightly to our doctrinal statements
[56:07] because God is greater than any
[56:09] statement that we can make about him. So
[56:12] our our relationship must be with him
[56:15] and not with our belief about him.
[56:18] That's right. And Job, his belief about
[56:22] God got blown out of the water, but that
[56:25] didn't destroy him because he was right
[56:28] in his heart. He wasn't completely right
[56:31] in his doctrine, but he was right in his
[56:33] heart. And he followed God more than
[56:37] even if God went further than his belief
[56:39] could have taken him about God.
[56:42] I'd rather be right in my doctrine and
[56:44] right in my heart. Brother Brandham says
[56:46] God will respect it more. So if a man's
[56:48] wrong, what of it? Help him. He needs
[56:53] help.
[56:54] He doesn't say go and correct him. He
[56:58] says love him. If you can't love your
[57:01] enemy the same as you love those who
[57:03] love you, you're no better off than the
[57:04] publicans. That's what the church has
[57:06] failed to get. I hope you get it
[57:08] tonight. It's back to love, redeeming
[57:12] love. And he makes this statement in
[57:14] Chicago. one place it's talking about um
[57:18] teaching on the godhead and he's got
[57:20] brothers from different churches
[57:22] believing different things and he's got
[57:24] them all there together teaching on the
[57:26] godhead and when you when I listened to
[57:28] that sermon the first time I I expected
[57:30] to have a teaching on the godhead
[57:33] but it really doesn't strike me as much
[57:35] as a teaching on the godhead as a
[57:37] teaching on how God reveals himself
[57:41] which really is a teaching on the
[57:43] godhead because when uh when back in
[57:46] 3:25 when when the council of Nika went
[57:50] to define God they say okay here's
[57:52] here's father here's son here's holy
[57:55] ghost it's kind of like they're
[57:56] dissecting god and when you put god on
[57:59] the dissecting well in order to dissect
[58:01] something what do you have to do first
[58:05] you have to kill it and that's what they
[58:08] did they dissected god and this is how
[58:11] this system work this is the other
[58:13] system this is the other system, but
[58:15] they make those statements, they kill
[58:16] its impact. That's not how Jews look at
[58:19] God. Looking at God as dynamic, vibrant,
[58:23] living, how God reveals himself. And
[58:26] that's what brother Brandham does in
[58:28] this service. Look how God reveals
[58:30] himself. If in our lives we're not
[58:33] manifesting God, we probably have a
[58:36] wrong revelation of the Godhead. Because
[58:39] all the God it is therefore the teaching
[58:41] of God it is to show how God manifests
[58:44] himself. He manifests himself in Jesus
[58:46] Christ flesh the flesh of the prophets
[58:48] and he wants to do it in our flesh as
[58:50] well. So he says it's back to love
[58:55] redeeming love not another seminar so
[58:58] you can correct the other brother so
[58:59] they can no it's back to love redeeming
[59:02] love. All the other things are fine, but
[59:05] we have to come back to fellowship with
[59:08] one another. Amen. So, Job, he's living
[59:11] a a wonderful life, picture of success.
[59:14] There wouldn't be anything that you
[59:15] would say we need to add to his life.
[59:17] He's perfect and upright. He's got a
[59:19] great testimony.
[59:21] But
[59:23] unbeknownst to Job, his life had
[59:26] attracted the attention of Satan.
[59:32] And this enemy had long journeyed over
[59:35] the earth. He had witnessed the worship
[59:38] of Job ascending upwards toward the
[59:40] heavens. And he witnessed the blessings
[59:43] of God raining down on Job.
[59:48] Satan had heard the prayers, the lavish
[59:52] proclamations of love from Job toward
[59:54] God. And Satan had also observed God's
[59:58] great pleasure with this most faithful
[1:00:01] son.
[1:00:04] And Satan scoffed.
[1:00:09] This was no love between God and Job.
[1:00:13] Satan says this was just a mutual
[1:00:17] coincidence of wants.
[1:00:20] God needs somebody to worship him.
[1:00:24] And this is a human being who needs more
[1:00:27] stuff.
[1:00:28] So God will shower the things down upon
[1:00:32] the human being and the human being will
[1:00:34] worship God. This is just a transaction.
[1:00:38] Satan says this isn't love
[1:00:41] baloney. Calling this love. Job and God
[1:00:46] are just engaging in great selfdeception
[1:00:50] because to Satan, Satan doesn't know
[1:00:52] what love is.
[1:00:54] to Satan. Job and Jehovah had no
[1:00:57] relationship of disinterested love.
[1:01:02] Satan knows that kind of thing doesn't
[1:01:03] even exist. The greatest love to Satan.
[1:01:07] The only true love was self love. That's
[1:01:10] all there is. Any relationship between
[1:01:12] creatures was not built upon love for
[1:01:15] the other. No.
[1:01:18] any relationship between creatures was a
[1:01:20] rational relationship built around
[1:01:23] self-interested
[1:01:24] transactions. That's so true. If you're
[1:01:27] in Job's place, who wouldn't worship a
[1:01:29] God who blesses so much
[1:01:33] and considering God?
[1:01:35] Who wouldn't? What spirit wouldn't be
[1:01:37] pleased with all these ardent
[1:01:40] proclamations of worship?
[1:01:43] Satan understood self-interest and he
[1:01:45] saw the self-interest in both of these
[1:01:48] parties.
[1:01:50] He understood that, but he couldn't
[1:01:52] stand the lie
[1:01:54] that these two loved each other. No,
[1:01:57] don't call it love. Just be real. So,
[1:02:01] Satan decides one day he's going to
[1:02:03] reveal the farce behind Joe Jehovah's
[1:02:07] purported love for humanity. And Satan
[1:02:10] wanted to expose Jehovah as being no
[1:02:14] more and no less than an angel who had
[1:02:18] been able to write a victor's history of
[1:02:21] heaven's war.
[1:02:24] And there's where verse six comes up.
[1:02:28] Now there was a day when the sons of God
[1:02:32] came to present themselves before the
[1:02:35] Lord, and Satan came also among them.
[1:02:44] And the Lord said unto Satan,
[1:02:47] "Where are you coming from? Whence
[1:02:49] comest thou?" Then Satan answered the
[1:02:50] Lord and said, "From going to and fro in
[1:02:53] the earth, and from walking up and down
[1:02:55] in it." And the Lord said unto Satan,
[1:02:57] "Hm, have you considered my servant Job,
[1:03:00] that there is none like him in the
[1:03:02] earth, a perfect and an upright man, one
[1:03:05] that fears God and his shoes evil?" And
[1:03:08] then Satan answered the Lord and said,
[1:03:11] "Does Job fear God for not?"
[1:03:16] There's something in it for him. Haven't
[1:03:18] you made a hedge about him and about his
[1:03:21] house, about all that he hath on every
[1:03:23] side? You've blessed the work of his
[1:03:25] hands. His substance is increased in the
[1:03:27] land. But put forth your hand now and
[1:03:31] touch all that he has. And God, he'll
[1:03:35] curse you to your face. This is not
[1:03:38] love. This is just a bar, a deal that
[1:03:41] you can make, a deal that you can break.
[1:03:44] Be real.
[1:03:47] Does Job fear God for not? It's not a
[1:03:50] relationship of love. It's just a
[1:03:53] transaction.
[1:03:56] Now, I don't know about you, but when I
[1:03:59] have read the book of Job in the past, I
[1:04:01] have always seen it as
[1:04:04] Satan's attack on Job.
[1:04:08] But when you look at the question more
[1:04:11] deeply,
[1:04:13] the attack is a little bit different.
[1:04:15] Does Job fear God for not? Who is Satan
[1:04:19] really
[1:04:21] attacking?
[1:04:23] So good. Oswald Chambers paraphrases
[1:04:27] Satan's argument this way. You are
[1:04:28] infatuated, God, with the idea that man
[1:04:31] loves you for your own sake. He never
[1:04:34] has and never will.
[1:04:36] Job, for instance, simply loves you
[1:04:38] because you bless and prosper him, but
[1:04:41] touch anyone that is blessing still
[1:04:43] curses to your face and prove that no
[1:04:45] man on earth loves you for your own
[1:04:47] sake.
[1:04:49] Someone else says, "The only reason Job
[1:04:51] fears you is because you pay him to do
[1:04:54] it. You guys have made a contract. You
[1:04:57] protect and prosper him as long as he
[1:04:59] obeys and worships you. You are not a
[1:05:02] god worthy of worship. You have to pay
[1:05:06] people to honor you.
[1:05:09] Who is this question really attacking at
[1:05:12] its deepest level? It's not just Job.
[1:05:16] It's God.
[1:05:19] All the talk about God loving humans and
[1:05:22] humans worshiping God is selfdeception,
[1:05:25] a farce, a scam. And God says game on.
[1:05:31] Yeah, there you go. Because Satan is
[1:05:34] attacking God, not just Job. And you
[1:05:38] know what? Really, anytime Satan attacks
[1:05:40] one of God's children, it's an attack on
[1:05:42] God anyhow. But this is a this is a deep
[1:05:46] attack on Job.
[1:05:48] So, we often read Satan's question, does
[1:05:52] Job fear God for not as a challenge of
[1:05:55] Job's testimony. But really at its
[1:05:58] deepest level, it's a challenge of God's
[1:06:00] character that he's not a God worthy of
[1:06:04] worship.
[1:06:06] So ultimately, when we look through the
[1:06:07] book of Job,
[1:06:10] it's not Job who's on trial. That's
[1:06:13] right. Job thinks he's on trial. Because
[1:06:16] as he's being attacked on every side,
[1:06:18] you're a hypocrite. You're a deception.
[1:06:20] You're a deceiver. You're a secret
[1:06:22] sinner. And Job's desperate. I wish God
[1:06:24] would come and be a witness on my
[1:06:26] behalf. and vindicate me.
[1:06:29] Job didn't realize
[1:06:32] that it was God who was on trial and God
[1:06:35] had picked Job for his witness.
[1:06:39] Job wanted God to be his witnesses. No,
[1:06:41] Job, you are my witness.
[1:06:46] That's what this is. Hallelujah. So, we
[1:06:49] we we know Brother Brandham talks in in
[1:06:51] victory day. He says, "God has counted
[1:06:53] you worthy when you have a test."
[1:06:57] Why?
[1:06:59] Well, if you're an attorney
[1:07:02] and you're going to put somebody on the
[1:07:03] witness stand to to testify in defense
[1:07:06] of the person you're defending,
[1:07:08] you're going to put somebody on the
[1:07:10] witness stand who you have great
[1:07:11] confidence in. You're going to put
[1:07:13] something on the witness stand who can
[1:07:15] deliver testament that'll just poke all
[1:07:16] these holes in the prosecution's
[1:07:18] arguments.
[1:07:20] Job was that kind of witness.
[1:07:23] There was nothing wrong with Job's life.
[1:07:25] There was nothing wrong with Job's
[1:07:27] testimony. God had full confidence. Put
[1:07:29] him on the witness stand and he will put
[1:07:31] holes in every one of Satan's arguments.
[1:07:34] But Satan, sorry, Job didn't realize
[1:07:37] that was what it was. Because if God had
[1:07:40] told Job ahead of time, this is what's
[1:07:42] going on, Job, I'm going to prep you for
[1:07:44] your testimony. No, that's tampering
[1:07:46] with the witness. He can't do that. So
[1:07:49] Job, he goes into the situation, going
[1:07:52] into his trial, he's flying blind. He
[1:07:55] doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't
[1:07:57] know why.
[1:08:00] But there's one thing for sure. God had
[1:08:02] confidence in Job. God has counted you
[1:08:06] worthy when you have a test. Now, don't
[1:08:09] fail this. Don't fail to get this. When
[1:08:12] you have a trial or a test,
[1:08:15] anybody here have a trial or a test?
[1:08:19] It shows the grace of God has you found
[1:08:22] favor with God. And God believes that
[1:08:26] you'll stand the test that God is going
[1:08:29] God believes that you are going to
[1:08:30] contribute to the ultimate victory.
[1:08:32] That's why you're going through this
[1:08:34] because Satan says, "Hey, you put a
[1:08:36] trial on them. They're fairweather fans.
[1:08:39] They're they're bandwagon believers.
[1:08:41] They're not going to stick with it. No.
[1:08:43] God says, "Game on. Put a test. I will
[1:08:45] show you just how strong they are.
[1:08:46] They've got my DNA with them. That's my
[1:08:49] son or daughter, and this is going to
[1:08:51] prove it. God had confidence in Job. So,
[1:08:57] when it looks like everything has gone
[1:08:59] wrong, God's giving you a trial. He's
[1:09:03] not putting you on trial. He's putting
[1:09:06] you on the stand in his trial because
[1:09:09] your testimony Yes. It's not just not
[1:09:12] just a testament of what God's done in
[1:09:14] your life. It's a testimony that no
[1:09:15] matter what God does, though he slay me,
[1:09:18] yet I'll trust him. It's those
[1:09:21] statements that that that Job makes that
[1:09:23] showing I will follow God no matter what
[1:09:26] happens. He I I praise him for the
[1:09:28] blessings if they're all gone. I wasn't
[1:09:31] serving the blessings. I was serving my
[1:09:33] God. Hallelujah.
[1:09:38] When it looks like everything's gone
[1:09:40] wrong, God's giving you a trial. He's
[1:09:42] got confidence in you. You don't have to
[1:09:44] baby you around. You're a hotbed plant
[1:09:46] or a hybrid. You're a real Christian.
[1:09:49] Amen. You're a real Christian.
[1:09:52] And in Job 1:es 11 and 12, God draws
[1:09:55] clear boundaries in which Satan has to
[1:09:57] say, "All that he hath is in my power."
[1:10:00] He says, "Only upon himself put not
[1:10:03] forth your hand.
[1:10:05] So in this trial, Job is going to be a
[1:10:08] living representation about what is most
[1:10:12] valuable.
[1:10:13] You can take all the stuff, but that's
[1:10:15] not the most valuable thing. That's
[1:10:17] good. And even in phase two of the
[1:10:19] trial, you can touch Job's health, but
[1:10:22] you can't take his life. What was the
[1:10:25] most valuable thing was Job's connection
[1:10:27] to God. Yeah. And Satan couldn't touch
[1:10:32] that. So yes sir. Now we hear the
[1:10:36] stories of uh different men and women
[1:10:40] who've done very very well for
[1:10:41] themselves in business. There are many
[1:10:44] men who uh who work very very hard
[1:10:48] investing or building a business whoever
[1:10:50] and they've and they just throw
[1:10:51] themselves into it and their and their
[1:10:53] business almost becomes their identity.
[1:10:56] Um they're always 247 almost in
[1:10:59] businessman mode. Um, but then when they
[1:11:02] go in one day from not a rag, not a rags
[1:11:05] to riches story, but from a riches to
[1:11:07] rags story, when the stock market falls,
[1:11:10] what do these men sometimes do? They'll
[1:11:13] jump out of the building. They'll kill
[1:11:14] themselves because their identity is so
[1:11:17] wrapped up in the stuff that they have.
[1:11:22] Job's identity is not touched
[1:11:26] when God takes all this stuff. So good.
[1:11:29] Amen. Yes, sir. His identity was not
[1:11:32] touched in this first phase of Satan's
[1:11:35] attack upon him. He wasn't uh he wasn't
[1:11:38] phased a bit by it. And we know the
[1:11:40] story and this first phase of Satan's
[1:11:42] attack. The Sebans come, the ox and the
[1:11:46] asses are are stolen. The servants slain
[1:11:49] and then there's one servant comes. I
[1:11:52] only am escaped alone to tell you. In
[1:11:56] the same day, a fire comes down from
[1:11:58] heaven and burns up all the sheep with
[1:12:00] all the servants who are the shepherds
[1:12:02] watching them. Only one escapes. I only
[1:12:05] am escaped alone to tell you. Then the
[1:12:08] calaldanss come along and they carry the
[1:12:10] camels away. All the servants are slain
[1:12:13] except one, the messenger. I only am
[1:12:15] escaped alone to tell you. Then lastly,
[1:12:19] this great wind comes. All of his
[1:12:22] children are together fellowshipping
[1:12:23] together. The house collapses on Job's
[1:12:26] children, on Job's servants, except one,
[1:12:29] the one who has escaped alone to tell
[1:12:33] you.
[1:12:34] And
[1:12:36] what a day. And we've had rough days,
[1:12:39] but we've all had rough days before, but
[1:12:41] this everything is being touched. And
[1:12:47] Job must just be torn with this
[1:12:49] question. Why? Why?
[1:12:55] Now, we've read Job chapter 1. We've
[1:12:58] been onlookers in heaven's throne room.
[1:13:01] We know what's going on.
[1:13:05] But without this insight,
[1:13:10] we might be inclined to agree with Job's
[1:13:13] friends. Job, God must be trying to send
[1:13:16] you a message here.
[1:13:18] If we didn't know Job chapter 1 already,
[1:13:21] it'd be easy to I mean, how many of us
[1:13:23] are like the uh a neighbor man across
[1:13:26] from my dad's house? He uh I was at my
[1:13:29] parents house the other day and he was
[1:13:30] coming over my parents live next to the
[1:13:32] woods and he was coming over bringing
[1:13:33] the some tree limbs that he'd trimmed
[1:13:35] off and he was throwing them into my
[1:13:37] parents woods was fine. He said, "Oh
[1:13:39] yeah, the trees were getting too much. I
[1:13:40] couldn't see my neighbor's house."
[1:13:42] That's how people are, right? like to
[1:13:44] kind of see what's going with the
[1:13:45] neighbors and um and sometimes we're
[1:13:48] like that. We like see, oh, look at
[1:13:50] these people in their trial. Man,
[1:13:51] they're going through hard stuff, man.
[1:13:53] There must be a reason behind that. And
[1:13:55] we try to figure it out. And if we'd
[1:13:58] seen somebody go through everything that
[1:14:00] Job, we'd put them on their prayer list,
[1:14:02] but we might all think, man, Lord, I
[1:14:04] pray you'd open their heart to hear what
[1:14:06] you're trying to tell them here. So
[1:14:09] Job's friends, I mean, they came. They
[1:14:13] loved him. They came. They they spent a
[1:14:15] whole week with him. But um we probably
[1:14:19] should be not just so judging of Job's
[1:14:22] friends. How often do we tend to do the
[1:14:23] same thing sometimes and put the pieces
[1:14:26] together um in somebody else's trials.
[1:14:30] Um
[1:14:32] so we might have just as easily said and
[1:14:35] agreed with Job's friends that Job needs
[1:14:37] must have to repent from something have
[1:14:40] needs a closer walk with God. But none
[1:14:42] of those things were true. There was
[1:14:45] nothing wrong with Job's walk with God
[1:14:47] here.
[1:14:48] So looking as that as a purpose for
[1:14:51] suffering doesn't fit the bill here.
[1:14:56] Why did this all happen?
[1:14:59] Job knew what had happened, but he had
[1:15:03] no idea why.
[1:15:06] And he couldn't because like I said, if
[1:15:09] God had given Job inside information,
[1:15:11] Job, I'm gonna take all your stuff away.
[1:15:14] Just keep saying you love me and
[1:15:16] everything will be fine. That'd be
[1:15:18] witness tampering. And that Job couldn't
[1:15:21] know that and still be a faithful
[1:15:22] witness. He was never told the why
[1:15:25] behind his trials. In the entire book,
[1:15:27] God never tells Job why. Ever. That's
[1:15:30] right. That's true. Like I said, Job was
[1:15:33] flying blind with nothing to guide his
[1:15:36] response toward God other than what he
[1:15:39] knew of God's character.
[1:15:42] Would that be enough?
[1:15:47] Does Job have a close enough walk with
[1:15:50] God
[1:15:51] to even if God seems to disappear from
[1:15:54] the scene for a while,
[1:15:57] it seemed that way to Job. He couldn't
[1:16:00] feel God. He couldn't see God. He was He
[1:16:02] felt like an empty he felt like an empty
[1:16:05] bucket. There's nothing I don't There's
[1:16:06] I I there's nothing to draw from
[1:16:08] anymore. I'm just I'm empty.
[1:16:12] Would Job still trust God? He's always
[1:16:15] been faithful for.
[1:16:17] He's going to take care of me. Would Job
[1:16:20] still do that? Would his knowledge of
[1:16:22] God's heart
[1:16:25] be enough?
[1:16:27] And I just uh amazed at end of chapter
[1:16:30] one after all of these four servants.
[1:16:33] They come with these new bad news bad
[1:16:36] bad all of this comes and what does Job
[1:16:39] do?
[1:16:41] He bows on his knees and worships.
[1:16:45] Job arose. He tears his shirt, shaves
[1:16:48] his head. He's grieving.
[1:16:51] It's fine to grieve. It's not like we
[1:16:53] have to say praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:16:54] We don't always feel that. We can show
[1:16:57] grief. We can show that we're torn. But
[1:16:59] even in that case, he still worshiped.
[1:17:03] And he says, "Naked came I out of my
[1:17:05] mother's womb. Naked shall I return
[1:17:08] thither. The Lord gave. The Lord's taken
[1:17:10] away. Blessed be the name of the Lord."
[1:17:14] In all this, Job sinned not, nor charged
[1:17:18] God foolishly.
[1:17:21] The purpose behind Job's suffering was
[1:17:23] to silence Satan.
[1:17:26] Job would worship God even in suffering.
[1:17:32] Job was going to be the answer to the
[1:17:35] devil's question.
[1:17:37] Does Job fear God for not? He was going
[1:17:40] to be the answer to that question.
[1:17:45] And I think uh there's a in the message
[1:17:49] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:17:52] There's a there's a few places where
[1:17:55] brother Brandham talks about we have
[1:17:56] Satan's answer. We have the answer to
[1:17:58] the devil's question. There's probably
[1:18:00] four or five six different spots where
[1:18:01] he talks about that. I read that years
[1:18:03] back and I in my in the back of the book
[1:18:06] I jotted that down. The answer to the
[1:18:07] devil's question. We have the answers to
[1:18:10] the devil's question. My first I was
[1:18:12] well that's wonderful but what was the
[1:18:13] devil's question and brother Bram never
[1:18:16] really comes out and says this was the
[1:18:17] devil's question it's not I' I've I've
[1:18:19] seen but you know what we have to answer
[1:18:22] the devil's question what are the times
[1:18:23] that the devil asks questions well in
[1:18:26] Genesis chapter 3 asks a qu kind of a
[1:18:28] rhetorical question he makes a statement
[1:18:30] to Eve that kind of packs a question
[1:18:33] inside you that god uh must not be a
[1:18:35] good god if he's not letting you by the
[1:18:37] know tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:18:40] he asks God a question about Job. He
[1:18:43] there in the Matthew 4, the temptation
[1:18:45] of Christ, Satan's asking questions. But
[1:18:49] Job is going to have not only have the
[1:18:52] answer to the devil's question, he's
[1:18:53] going to be the answer to the devil's
[1:18:57] question.
[1:18:59] And I just want to look at this. We have
[1:19:01] Satan's answer.
[1:19:04] God has vindicated himself. God proves
[1:19:06] himself to his promise in this day.
[1:19:08] Hallelujah. The headship's here. Amen.
[1:19:10] Christ the Lord, the risen Lord is here
[1:19:13] in the same power of his resurrection,
[1:19:15] he ever was manifesting himself. There
[1:19:17] is the devil's answer. It's not just
[1:19:19] that we have Satan's answer. I say we
[1:19:22] are Satan's answer. Christ is alive.
[1:19:27] He's in you and me. We don't just have
[1:19:29] the answer. We are the answer. He says
[1:19:31] we are his victory. Amen. We don't just
[1:19:36] have the victory. We are his victory.
[1:19:40] The church is his victory. We come forth
[1:19:41] in this last stage with this glorious
[1:19:43] gospel showing his victory. He died for
[1:19:46] this purpose and we are the proof of his
[1:19:50] victory. Does Job fear God for not? Job
[1:19:54] was the answer. Job was the proof. And
[1:19:58] Satan asked the same thing about you and
[1:20:00] me. Do you fear God for nothing? Are you
[1:20:02] just here because God's taking care of
[1:20:04] you? He's blessed you. Your car is still
[1:20:06] running. You got a nice house. You made
[1:20:07] your you got a nice dog. You've got cute
[1:20:09] kids. You make the honor roll. Is that
[1:20:12] why you're serving God? No. We serve God
[1:20:15] because he died for us. He loves us and
[1:20:18] we love him. He could take all the stuff
[1:20:20] away, all the blessings away. I'm not
[1:20:22] serving God for what he gives me, but
[1:20:24] for who he is. Satan can't understand
[1:20:28] that. He can't fathom that. So again,
[1:20:31] he'll try to peel all these things away.
[1:20:33] And we still though he slay me yet don't
[1:20:36] trust him. We are proof of God's love.
[1:20:39] We are proof of his victory.
[1:20:48] Satan sees it all and he he he doesn't
[1:20:50] understand it. So chapter two we get a
[1:20:55] deja vu again. There was a day when the
[1:20:58] sons of God came to present themselves
[1:21:01] before the Lord and Satan comes also
[1:21:05] among them. And the God says, "Satan,
[1:21:09] where have you been lately?" And Satan
[1:21:11] says, "From going to and fro in the
[1:21:12] earth, from walking up and down in Yes.
[1:21:14] And what do you think about Job? I told
[1:21:17] you there's none like him in the earth.
[1:21:19] Fears me as she's evil. and he's still
[1:21:22] holding fast his integrity, Satan, even
[1:21:24] though you've moved me against him to
[1:21:26] destroy him without cause. There was no
[1:21:29] reason for Job to have to go. Job had
[1:21:32] done nothing wrong.
[1:21:34] And Satan answered the Lord, "Yeah, skin
[1:21:36] for skin. All that a man hath will he
[1:21:39] give for his life,
[1:21:41] but put forth now your hand and touch
[1:21:44] his bow and his flesh, and they'll curse
[1:21:47] you to your face."
[1:21:49] Financial trials are one thing where you
[1:21:51] can lose everything. And now he's going
[1:21:53] to put him a physical trial where he
[1:21:55] feels physically bad all the time.
[1:21:59] That's tough because it's not just aches
[1:22:02] and the pains pull too long. It that
[1:22:04] physical aches and pains can penetrate
[1:22:06] your emotions and your heart. Oh, I I I
[1:22:08] I feel bad. Therefore, I must be bad.
[1:22:12] That's that that's how that can go
[1:22:14] sometimes. And says, I'm gonna I'm gonna
[1:22:16] hit him this way.
[1:22:18] And God says, "Behold, he's in your
[1:22:22] hand, but save his life."
[1:22:28] So, Satan uh leaves God's presence and
[1:22:32] he smites Job from head to toe with
[1:22:36] putrifying boils.
[1:22:40] And Job sat down among the ashes. Verse
[1:22:44] 8 says and verse nine, "Then said his
[1:22:48] wife unto him, do you still retain your
[1:22:52] integrity? Just curse God and die. Let
[1:22:56] God just send a lightning bolt down and
[1:22:58] we'll be done with it. Just do this,
[1:23:00] Job. Take the easy way out." But he said
[1:23:03] unto her, "You speak as one of the
[1:23:05] foolish women speaketh. What shall we
[1:23:07] receive good at the hand of God, and
[1:23:09] shall we not receive evil?" In all this,
[1:23:13] Job did not sin with his lips. And I
[1:23:16] just want to point out that um God never
[1:23:19] took Job's wife from him.
[1:23:24] I think God is understanding because it
[1:23:26] wasn't just Job who was in this trial.
[1:23:29] Job's wife, she'd also lost all of her
[1:23:31] kids.
[1:23:33] She'd also lost her home. She'd lost
[1:23:36] everything. Everything was gone for her.
[1:23:39] And she responds here
[1:23:42] pretty rationally, I think. Let's just
[1:23:44] be done, Job. Let's just finish it. God
[1:23:48] doesn't say, "Ah, man. Job's wife was a
[1:23:50] terrible." He doesn't take her away.
[1:23:52] They stay together. They have children
[1:23:54] later on. God has understanding for the
[1:23:58] frailty
[1:24:00] of men and women. That is so good
[1:24:03] because God doesn't come down and hammer
[1:24:05] Job's wife. And the next chapter when
[1:24:07] Job says, "I wish I were dead." Job is
[1:24:10] saying these same things. I wish I were
[1:24:12] dead. He feels terrible. You know what?
[1:24:14] This is the very same Job who a chapter
[1:24:16] earlier knelt down and worshiped. Yeah.
[1:24:20] The very same Job who's worshiping God.
[1:24:23] There you go. Now he feels bad. Sickness
[1:24:26] and everything like that. And now, oh
[1:24:28] man, I wish God would just die. Cursed
[1:24:31] be today. Why didn't my mother misarry?
[1:24:34] That's these are the things he's saying.
[1:24:37] God knows that we are flesh.
[1:24:41] He is understanding for the frailty of
[1:24:43] the human being. So when we're in
[1:24:45] trials, we all say some pretty stupid
[1:24:49] things sometimes.
[1:24:51] Things that we really don't mean. Right.
[1:24:55] And there's a lesson that um I want I
[1:24:58] want to highlight in a minute. Job's
[1:25:00] friends come and I think they probably
[1:25:03] helped the most when they came and sat
[1:25:06] with him and said nothing.
[1:25:10] That's right.
[1:25:13] Because you know what? Explanations
[1:25:15] rarely help the hurting heart. That's so
[1:25:19] good. What do you say to somebody who's
[1:25:21] hurting? That's why we don't go visit
[1:25:24] somebody in the hospital. Someone says,
[1:25:25] "What do I say?" You don't have to say
[1:25:28] anything.
[1:25:30] just coming and showing you care and
[1:25:33] showing you love says so much. Let God
[1:25:36] translate that. But when we open our
[1:25:39] mouths, sometimes things just flop out
[1:25:42] that we didn't mean to flop out like
[1:25:45] that.
[1:25:48] Job's friends heard his words,
[1:25:52] but they didn't feel the anguish of his
[1:25:55] heart.
[1:25:56] And unfortunately, Job's friends argued
[1:25:59] with his words instead of ministering to
[1:26:02] his heart.
[1:26:05] How often have I done that as a husband?
[1:26:12] My wife says something
[1:26:14] and I respond to the words
[1:26:18] instead of just say, "Oh man,
[1:26:22] rough day today. Let's just sit and have
[1:26:24] tea together.
[1:26:26] That might be better
[1:26:28] minister to the hurting heart
[1:26:32] than grappling and wrangling with words
[1:26:37] because
[1:26:39] explanations. I've always, you know,
[1:26:41] I've always my my wife has told me, I
[1:26:43] don't need a solution. I just need some
[1:26:45] understanding right now. And we're not
[1:26:47] wired that way, guys. But you know what?
[1:26:49] When we go through hard times, guys,
[1:26:52] um we always we don't always want
[1:26:55] somebody to come along and solve things.
[1:26:56] We want we want some understanding, too.
[1:26:59] It can be really annoying when somebody
[1:27:00] comes and says, "You just need to do
[1:27:01] this this this different. You you'll be
[1:27:03] fine." If you only understood, we all
[1:27:06] are like that.
[1:27:10] If you go and uh break a leg, you have
[1:27:13] to go to urgent care and ah just really
[1:27:15] really hurts. Really, really hurts. They
[1:27:16] take an X-ray and you're lying on the
[1:27:18] table and they come in and the doctor
[1:27:20] shows you
[1:27:23] when he reads the X-ray. Does it make us
[1:27:26] feel better?
[1:27:28] Does reading the X-ray take away the
[1:27:30] pain of a broken leg? No. Explanations
[1:27:34] don't heal us. We don't live on
[1:27:37] explanations. We live on promises.
[1:27:41] So, we shouldn't spend too much time
[1:27:43] asking God why. And that's a really key
[1:27:46] lesson from the book of Job because God
[1:27:48] never explains things to Job.
[1:27:52] In fact, when God comes and reveals
[1:27:54] himself to Job at the end, all he does
[1:27:56] is ask questions.
[1:27:59] Job, do you understand this? Do you
[1:28:01] understand this? Do you know about this,
[1:28:03] Job? And Job says, no.
[1:28:06] But the one who asked the question does.
[1:28:09] And if God can keep all these diverse
[1:28:11] things in the entire universe, he's not
[1:28:14] only created them, but he can take care
[1:28:17] of them, making sure they're running
[1:28:18] smoothly, he can do all that, then God's
[1:28:21] got this, too.
[1:28:24] God doesn't explain anything.
[1:28:26] Job didn't need an explanation.
[1:28:29] He needed a revelation of God in his
[1:28:31] trial, and it came in his time.
[1:28:42] So in Job's despair
[1:28:47] in Job chapter 3
[1:28:49] after he's lost everything his friends
[1:28:51] have been there for a week without
[1:28:53] saying a word
[1:28:55] in verse one after this opened Job his
[1:28:58] mouth and cursed his day. In verses 11
[1:29:01] and 12, Job's asking the why question.
[1:29:04] Why did I not die from the womb? Why did
[1:29:06] I not give up the ghost when I came out
[1:29:08] of the belly? Why did the knees prevent
[1:29:10] me? Why the breath that I should suck?
[1:29:13] Verse 20, wherefore or why is light
[1:29:16] given to him that is in misery? If this
[1:29:19] is what life is, all this pain and
[1:29:21] suffering, why
[1:29:25] why is light given to a man whose way is
[1:29:28] hid and who God had hedged in?
[1:29:32] In times of severe testing, our first
[1:29:34] question is usually why.
[1:29:38] But it really shouldn't be because the
[1:29:42] the first question shouldn't be why, but
[1:29:45] what
[1:29:46] Job's wife came along with the solution.
[1:29:48] How we can get out of this. That's not a
[1:29:51] first question either, but it should be
[1:29:52] not how we can get out of this, but what
[1:29:55] can I get out of this? Because the why
[1:29:58] question packs inside of it accusations
[1:30:03] of unfairness or injustice. Whenever we
[1:30:06] ask why, it's kind of a hidden way of
[1:30:10] pointing the finger at God. Yes, sir. I
[1:30:13] ask the question why, but I really
[1:30:15] already know why.
[1:30:18] Be careful asking the why question too
[1:30:20] much because ask Job marinates in
[1:30:23] chapter three in these why questions.
[1:30:27] He soon moves from asking why
[1:30:31] to answering his question and accusing
[1:30:33] God.
[1:30:35] and he he'll make some pretty strong
[1:30:38] statements. And one of the ones I
[1:30:39] remember the most, he says, "It feels
[1:30:41] like God is pointing his arrows at me
[1:30:44] that I am just his target practice."
[1:30:48] That is a strong statement. But notice,
[1:30:52] God doesn't respond to Job's words. God
[1:30:55] responds to the pain in his heart.
[1:30:58] Because God could have been insulted.
[1:30:59] You think I'm that kind of God? If you
[1:31:02] want to know what it feels like to have
[1:31:03] my arrows in you, I will show you. He
[1:31:05] could have done that. That's what that's
[1:31:07] what Job's friends did. They responded
[1:31:09] to his words. But God sees the pain
[1:31:13] behind the words. He ignores the words.
[1:31:16] He's not going to be challenged. He's
[1:31:17] not going to be hurt by them. He ignores
[1:31:18] all the missiles there. He's coming and
[1:31:21] he goes and carries Job. He takes out of
[1:31:24] the trial. In the end,
[1:31:28] Job had marinated in the why question so
[1:31:31] much he started actually accusing God.
[1:31:33] the why questions. Watch out for those.
[1:31:36] Watch out for those.
[1:31:38] Like I said, it's a pity that Job's
[1:31:40] friends spent all their time responding
[1:31:43] to his words
[1:31:47] instead of encouraging his profession of
[1:31:48] faith. The same Job is saying why why I
[1:31:52] wish I were dead. He's also the one like
[1:31:54] I said he said the Lord giveth giveth
[1:31:55] the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the
[1:31:57] name of the Lord. A true friend will
[1:31:59] remind you of your positive confession.
[1:32:02] Ignore the negative, but remember it's
[1:32:05] not so bad right now. Just remember what
[1:32:07] God did not so long ago. Because when
[1:32:09] we're going through a really hard time,
[1:32:12] it's so dark and foggy, we can't
[1:32:14] remember anything outside of our trial.
[1:32:17] And a true friend will remind you, hey,
[1:32:21] remember last week
[1:32:24] this went really, really well. We we we
[1:32:26] laughed together last week. It was good.
[1:32:29] and the reminding of the good times are
[1:32:32] there remind us that God is with us.
[1:32:37] That's what a true friend will do. A a
[1:32:39] true spouse, husband or wife. I mean,
[1:32:42] when when you go through a trial, it's
[1:32:43] nice. Usually trials tag team. Husband
[1:32:46] be down for a while, but the wife's
[1:32:48] okay. Then then couple weeks later might
[1:32:50] it might switch. When both are done,
[1:32:51] that's really really hard times when
[1:32:53] you're both are down. But try to
[1:32:55] encourage one another. remind one
[1:32:57] another of what God has done because
[1:33:00] that shows that God is with you.
[1:33:07] So Job, he's uh he's vented his spleen,
[1:33:10] so to speak. He's he's asked all these
[1:33:12] why questions. He's uh made a complaint
[1:33:15] against God. And now we have uh Job's
[1:33:19] friends come. And uh one author writes
[1:33:22] about these friends. He says, "What
[1:33:24] Satan could not do with all of his
[1:33:26] Seabans and Calaldanss and winds from
[1:33:28] the wilderness that he soon did with the
[1:33:31] debating approaches and the
[1:33:33] controversial assaults of Elephaz,
[1:33:35] Zofar, and Bildad." Oh, the unmittable
[1:33:38] curse of controversy.
[1:33:40] Job survived the fire and the winds and
[1:33:43] the attacks better than he survived his
[1:33:46] friends. That was really, really hard.
[1:33:49] with friends like Job's who needs
[1:33:50] enemies you could say. So um Elephaz is
[1:33:55] the first uh one who speaks. So he's
[1:33:58] probably um the oldest of the company.
[1:34:00] So he's going to be considered the the
[1:34:02] wisest and his words are based on what
[1:34:04] he's seen in life. This is what I've
[1:34:06] experiences what I know and the special
[1:34:09] experience that that he had. And um
[1:34:13] we'll kind of go through these quickly.
[1:34:15] I know we're almost at an hour, but um
[1:34:17] Elephaz, one of his main points is Job,
[1:34:20] who ever perished being innocent.
[1:34:25] I wonder what Elephaz would have said to
[1:34:26] the men on the road to Emmas.
[1:34:29] Jesus was innocent.
[1:34:32] He perished. Jesus just kind of blows up
[1:34:34] this theory of suffering that bad things
[1:34:37] only happen to bad people. Elephas says
[1:34:40] this.
[1:34:42] He's speaking with some pretty cold
[1:34:44] logic. The logic is the innocent don't
[1:34:47] perish. Job, you're perishing.
[1:34:49] Therefore, you must not be innocent.
[1:34:54] And uh I could remember after my wife
[1:34:56] got out of the hospital back in the um
[1:34:59] August, I was doing my study on the book
[1:35:02] of Job and I was in chapter uh chapter
[1:35:05] five and I had this on the breakfast
[1:35:07] table. I was reading my Bible. I had it
[1:35:09] open there. I'm up doing something else
[1:35:11] in the kitchen. And she sits down. Oh,
[1:35:13] wow. You're reading your Bible up. Let
[1:35:14] me re read what you're reading. And her
[1:35:18] light, her eyes light on this
[1:35:20] highlighted scripture where Elephaz
[1:35:23] says, "Happy is the man whom God
[1:35:25] correctth. Therefore, despise not thou
[1:35:28] the chastening of the Lord." She's like,
[1:35:30] "My wife, so God's chastening me. What
[1:35:33] have I done wrong?"
[1:35:35] Well, this is a good th this is partly
[1:35:39] true. We can be happy when God corrects
[1:35:42] us. We shouldn't despise the chastening
[1:35:45] of the Lord. That's partly true.
[1:35:49] But you know what? Eleph
[1:35:55] God corrects you, you repent, and you
[1:35:59] can get then all the gold will start
[1:36:00] flowing again. That's really what Alfaz
[1:36:02] is saying here.
[1:36:05] Job, things aren't going so well for
[1:36:07] you.
[1:36:08] God's correcting you. Confess your sins
[1:36:11] and God will restore everything that
[1:36:13] you've lost.
[1:36:15] This sounds okay, but really this is a
[1:36:19] paraphrase of Satan's speech.
[1:36:23] Job, the motivation to confess and with
[1:36:26] God is to get your stuff back.
[1:36:30] So part of what Alfaz is saying, it can
[1:36:34] be correct,
[1:36:36] but when the right thing is spoken to
[1:36:39] the wrong person,
[1:36:42] you're mislocating the word of God.
[1:36:45] You're misinterpreting
[1:36:47] the word of God. And that's what his
[1:36:49] friends do again and again and again.
[1:36:53] Brother Brandham says there are three
[1:36:55] musts in the scripture to rightly divide
[1:36:57] God's word. You must not misinterpret
[1:37:00] the word. You must not misplace the
[1:37:03] word. And you must not dislocate the
[1:37:05] word. If we would do either of these, it
[1:37:08] throws the whole Bible in a confusion
[1:37:11] and chaos. And when Job's friends do
[1:37:14] these three things, it throws him into a
[1:37:17] confusion and chaos.
[1:37:20] When people come along when we're going
[1:37:22] through a hard time and try to analyze
[1:37:25] and explain, oh, you've just got some
[1:37:27] secret sin. Maybe you do, maybe you
[1:37:29] don't. But if you don't and someone
[1:37:31] comes along and says that, that throws
[1:37:33] the whole thing into a confusion and the
[1:37:36] chaos. We need to be really careful.
[1:37:39] We can use the right Bible verse, apply
[1:37:42] it to the wrong person, and it doesn't
[1:37:44] fit, and it can throw the whole thing
[1:37:47] into a confusion and a chaos.
[1:37:52] Elephas didn't answer the pain in Job's
[1:37:55] heart, but the words from Job's lips.
[1:37:58] And this was a mistake. You don't heal a
[1:38:01] broken heart with logic. You heal a
[1:38:03] broken heart with love.
[1:38:06] By the time Bildad came to speak, he's
[1:38:10] listened to Job's initial complaint. He
[1:38:12] listened to Elfaz's wise response. He
[1:38:14] listened to Job's rebuttal. And for two
[1:38:17] whole chapters, Job had gone on and on
[1:38:20] and on about the heaviness of this
[1:38:22] suffering, the hopelessness of it, the
[1:38:23] bitterness of it. And Billad just can't
[1:38:25] take it anymore. And he starts on says,
[1:38:29] "How long will you speak these things?
[1:38:31] How long will the words of your mouth
[1:38:32] feel like a strong wind? You're a
[1:38:34] windbag, Job. You're always talking
[1:38:36] about the same thing. Your trials
[1:38:39] enough."
[1:38:41] Not really very understanding, very
[1:38:44] friendly. And he's quick to respond to
[1:38:46] Job's words again. He says his emphasize
[1:38:49] emphasis job justice. Job God's justice
[1:38:52] is perfect.
[1:38:54] And he goes there. Your kids must have
[1:38:57] sinned against him. Otherwise, why would
[1:39:00] he have punished them? What a thing to
[1:39:02] say to somebody. But he actually does.
[1:39:05] I'm using the message translation here.
[1:39:07] 8:4.
[1:39:09] It's plain. Your children sinned against
[1:39:11] him. Otherwise, why would God have
[1:39:13] punished them?
[1:39:16] He's he liked to think his friends are
[1:39:19] meaning well, but they did much better
[1:39:22] when they kept their mouths closed.
[1:39:26] He gives advice. Job, seek the Lord. If
[1:39:28] you were pure and right, he'd pay
[1:39:30] attention to you again. He'd make you
[1:39:32] more prosperous than ever.
[1:39:35] But again, Bildad is just rehashing
[1:39:38] Satan's line. And Zofar does the same
[1:39:41] thing after Job responds to Bildad.
[1:39:45] Zofar doesn't he speaks the least
[1:39:46] because everybody's almost said
[1:39:47] everything by the time he gets he's
[1:39:49] speaking because he's there and you feel
[1:39:51] obligated to say something. But he again
[1:39:53] says you're a windbag. You're a liar.
[1:39:55] God is even punishing you less than you
[1:39:58] deserve.
[1:39:59] He says some bad stuff. Job, you should
[1:40:02] have known better. The triumphing of the
[1:40:05] wicked is short. You enjoyed blessings
[1:40:07] for a a while in your life, but the rug
[1:40:10] was pulled out from under you because
[1:40:11] you must have been wicked. The joy of
[1:40:13] the hypocrite is but for a moment. And
[1:40:15] they just keep going on and on and on
[1:40:18] throughout the book of Job. Every single
[1:40:20] time, you know, when your kids don't
[1:40:21] understand something and you have to say
[1:40:23] it again, you try to explain. You don't
[1:40:24] use different words, you just raise your
[1:40:25] tone of voice. You think if I say it
[1:40:27] louder, they'll get it. That's kind of
[1:40:30] what happening in this argument. And I
[1:40:34] don't want to rehash things or go over
[1:40:37] more than I need to, but Job is again
[1:40:40] and again and again facing accusations
[1:40:42] from his friends and then get to the how
[1:40:45] can anybody be righteous before God? God
[1:40:47] is perfection. He is the standard of
[1:40:51] righteousness, the standard of holiness.
[1:40:52] He can look at themselves and say,
[1:40:55] "Would I be vindicated? I haven't I'm
[1:40:57] not walking in sin. I'm not perfect. Um
[1:41:00] but
[1:41:02] I know it so of the truth. How can a man
[1:41:04] be just with God? Job's wrestling with
[1:41:07] these questions. He doesn't know how to
[1:41:08] answer it sometimes. How can anybody be
[1:41:11] righteous before God? How could I get
[1:41:14] God to come and vindicate my innocence?
[1:41:16] Again, this is where Job wants God to
[1:41:19] come and testify on his behalf when
[1:41:21] really Job just living a simple
[1:41:23] Christian life through his trials. He is
[1:41:26] testifying on God's behalf without
[1:41:29] realizing it. But he wants God. He says,
[1:41:32] 'I just wish I could have a day in court
[1:41:34] with God that I could come and argue
[1:41:36] this out with God. Because really, this
[1:41:39] is where I think his friends almost push
[1:41:42] Job to the edge and his def when we get
[1:41:46] defensive,
[1:41:48] we say thing even more things that we
[1:41:50] don't mean. That's right. when we get
[1:41:51] defensive and Job's getting defensive
[1:41:53] and his friends keep attacking and
[1:41:55] because of their attacking he's getting
[1:41:57] closer and closer to saying God I wish I
[1:41:59] could have a day in court to prove that
[1:42:01] you're not treating me justly
[1:42:04] and here's where um Job will be
[1:42:06] corrected in the end if he says if only
[1:42:10] I had a mediator
[1:42:13] and what's interesting when Job's having
[1:42:16] this like why did we go through trials
[1:42:18] one of the things that comes out of
[1:42:20] Job's trial Now in this point in history
[1:42:24] there was no indication nothing written
[1:42:27] about there being a resurrection
[1:42:31] nothing.
[1:42:33] But Job is under so much pressure. So
[1:42:36] much pressure. He says my I see the I
[1:42:39] see the seed go into the the ground and
[1:42:41] come up and it it dies in the ground and
[1:42:44] then it lives again. I see this and he
[1:42:46] said he's under so much pressure and as
[1:42:48] he's going through the pressure
[1:42:50] sometimes a lot of times bad things come
[1:42:52] out we're under pressure but here
[1:42:53] something good comes out God he says I
[1:42:55] know that my redeemer liveth and that I
[1:42:58] shall someday stand upon the earth this
[1:43:01] was a new revelation from God
[1:43:04] and God squeezed it out
[1:43:08] right through suffering and when we go
[1:43:11] through things when we go through trials
[1:43:14] new revelations of God come out of the
[1:43:17] trial. It's in times of blessing and
[1:43:19] prosperity. We usually don't get the
[1:43:22] depth of experience.
[1:43:24] But here Job is going through some
[1:43:26] things and some amazing things come out.
[1:43:28] But you know what? You can look at Job
[1:43:31] says some really rough things. The
[1:43:33] arrows of the Almighty are pointed at
[1:43:35] and he's saying that a couple chapters
[1:43:37] later I know that my redeemer liveth.
[1:43:39] Then later a little bit later, a few
[1:43:40] chapters later, he's saying some comp
[1:43:43] complaining. this feels really bad. How
[1:43:45] long does how much longer that's going
[1:43:46] to last?
[1:43:48] He's perfect and upright. And how does
[1:43:49] his life go? His feelings, it goes up
[1:43:52] and down. That's human. He goes through
[1:43:55] that. No. So, we get can't judge
[1:43:57] ourselves just based upon this because,
[1:43:59] you know, we just keep on going and God
[1:44:01] brings us up and we see some more. And
[1:44:03] that's just how life goes. But I wanted
[1:44:06] to point out um once let's go to Job
[1:44:08] chapter 23,
[1:44:10] sorry, Job 22.
[1:44:13] And I think this is just a really neat
[1:44:15] uh we're going to look at Job 22,
[1:44:17] Elephaz is speaking and he's going to
[1:44:20] try uh to persuade Job to um make things
[1:44:24] right with God. So Job 22 and verse uh
[1:44:30] uh 20 22, receive, I pray thee, the law
[1:44:34] from his mouth, lay up his words in your
[1:44:37] heart. If you return to the Almighty,
[1:44:39] which that is that's the name that God
[1:44:42] is usually known by in the book of Job.
[1:44:44] When Job's friends refer to him, when
[1:44:46] Job refers to God, he says Almighty.
[1:44:49] That's not a very intimate name for God.
[1:44:52] If you return to the Almighty, you'll be
[1:44:55] built up. You'll put away iniquity far
[1:44:57] from your tabernacles. Then shall you
[1:44:59] lay up gold as dust, and the gold of
[1:45:01] oper as the stones of the brooks. Do you
[1:45:03] see the Satan's lie there? Yeah. Turn to
[1:45:06] the Almighty. The gold will flow again.
[1:45:09] That's basically what he's saying there.
[1:45:12] Next chapter, Job 23,
[1:45:15] verse three. Oh, that I knew where I
[1:45:18] might find him, God, that I might even
[1:45:21] come to his seat. I would order my cause
[1:45:23] before him, fill my mouth, this
[1:45:25] argument, that this is not just justice.
[1:45:28] I would know the words he'd answer me
[1:45:29] and understand what he would say to me.
[1:45:32] Will he plead against me with his great
[1:45:33] power? No. He would put strength in me.
[1:45:36] You guys are pleading against me. You're
[1:45:38] arguing with me, but God wouldn't do
[1:45:39] that. He would put strength in me.
[1:45:42] Verse eight, behold, I go forward, but
[1:45:45] he's not there. Where is God? I look
[1:45:48] back, I can't find him. Where is he? On
[1:45:50] the left hand, where he does work, I
[1:45:52] can't Behold him. He hides himself. On
[1:45:54] the right hand, I cannot see him. He's
[1:45:57] flying blind.
[1:45:59] But he knows the way that I take. and
[1:46:04] when he hath tried me, I shall come
[1:46:07] forth as gold. Yes, sir. Elephas said,
[1:46:10] "Repent, and you'll get gold." And Job
[1:46:12] said, "No, I'm going to trust God and
[1:46:14] I'm going to be gold." Job knows what
[1:46:17] it's all about. He's not trying to get
[1:46:19] something from God. He's becoming God's
[1:46:22] treasure. It is so much more valuable.
[1:46:26] Just repenting to get something from
[1:46:28] God. That's not This is not a prosperity
[1:46:30] gospel. have a relationship with God and
[1:46:34] you will be Satan's answer. You will be
[1:46:36] the victory. That's the important thing.
[1:46:42] So again and again, Job and his friends
[1:46:44] go round and round here, but he keeps
[1:46:46] calling, "I wish I had a mediator." And
[1:46:50] in Job 32,
[1:46:52] a new man comes on the scene, Eliu. And
[1:46:56] this is a really interesting guy. You
[1:46:59] have Elephaz, Bildad, Zofar,
[1:47:04] and then you have Elihu.
[1:47:07] Who was this guy? Well, probably the
[1:47:10] youngest in the group because he speaks
[1:47:11] last.
[1:47:13] But his name is the only name that has
[1:47:16] any representation of God in it.
[1:47:19] Elephas, Bild, Zofa, they're just
[1:47:21] Eastern names. But Elahu means he is my
[1:47:26] God.
[1:47:28] And Elahu's dad is named Barakel,
[1:47:32] meaning God blesses.
[1:47:35] God is coming to Job in his trial. And I
[1:47:39] look at Elahu as kind of having the
[1:47:42] ministry of the forerunner because a few
[1:47:45] chapters later, God's going to come. And
[1:47:48] you know what? As what Elahu does
[1:47:51] throughout the book of Job, Job's
[1:47:54] talking about himself. Everybody's
[1:47:56] talking about Job. Job's talking about
[1:47:58] himself. Eli comes along and says, "Hey,
[1:48:02] we've got the focus wrong Job. Let's
[1:48:04] stop looking at ourselves.
[1:48:07] Look at God. Look at God. Elahu was sent
[1:48:11] to prepare the way because Eloh is going
[1:48:15] to come going to answer some of Job's
[1:48:17] questions. He's he's going to speak to
[1:48:18] the situation. He's going to actually do
[1:48:20] some correction of Job
[1:48:23] so that then Elahu
[1:48:26] stops speaking and Job's looking to God
[1:48:29] and the whirlwind comes and he's there.
[1:48:33] I look at the book of Job as a story
[1:48:35] also of the bride of Christ because from
[1:48:37] the very beginning God says she's
[1:48:40] perfect and upright. No fault in her.
[1:48:44] Yeah. As the bride of Christ goes
[1:48:46] through life, goes through trials and
[1:48:47] temptations, there are all these other
[1:48:49] folks who are there accusing. Ah, this
[1:48:50] isn't quite right. You're going through
[1:48:51] hard times because of this, because of
[1:48:52] that, trying to confuse, trying to get
[1:48:54] off the path. And she says, "No, I don't
[1:48:57] I can't I can't defend myself any other
[1:48:59] way, but I I don't know what I've done
[1:49:01] wrong, but I'm just going to wait for
[1:49:02] him because I don't think I've done
[1:49:03] anything wrong. I'm just going to wait.
[1:49:04] He's going to come. He's going to come
[1:49:06] and get me." You remember the story
[1:49:07] brother Ray tells about the girl and the
[1:49:09] um the armor u um meat packing uh owner
[1:49:13] the boy is going to come and he's he's
[1:49:15] not coming all the other ladies say he's
[1:49:17] forgotten about you you're not good
[1:49:19] enough you're just a cook you're just
[1:49:21] dishwasher he's not going to come no I
[1:49:23] don't know where he is but he's going to
[1:49:24] come to get me because I know him that's
[1:49:27] Job's testimony that's our testimony
[1:49:29] then Elahu comes preparing the way and
[1:49:32] Elahu's greatest concern was not to
[1:49:35] debate Job
[1:49:38] All of his other friends were wrangling
[1:49:40] with words. Eloh says, "I'm not going to
[1:49:41] debate you, Job. I just want to refute
[1:49:45] one thing about God as you've been
[1:49:48] saying." Brother Brandham says that
[1:49:51] after a while from the east comes little
[1:49:53] prince by the name of El of Elu, meaning
[1:49:56] he's representing Jesus Christ. First,
[1:49:58] he begins to straighten Job out about
[1:50:01] where he'd done wrong and things of
[1:50:02] accusing God. You know, the arrows of
[1:50:05] the Almighty are in me. That's an
[1:50:06] accusation to God. Then when he began to
[1:50:09] speak to him, not as a sinner,
[1:50:13] he comes as in love and he's he's not
[1:50:17] he's not attacking Job. He's just he's
[1:50:20] not speaking to him as a sinner. Job had
[1:50:23] said there's hope of a tree if it dies
[1:50:25] or a flower dies, right? little petals
[1:50:27] drop off. Is that the end of the flower?
[1:50:29] No, sir. And Job actually says this
[1:50:33] before Elahu comes. But Elahu can hear
[1:50:36] him say that. And Elahu is trying to
[1:50:40] straighten him out. He said, "Job,
[1:50:41] you're watching those flowers. They're
[1:50:44] in God's way. They haven't sinned.
[1:50:47] There's nothing about them that sin. But
[1:50:49] man sinned." And that's the reason you
[1:50:52] don't see him no more when he goes down.
[1:50:54] When he gets buried, goes down to show.
[1:50:56] You don't see him no more. But Job,
[1:50:58] there's coming a just one who will stand
[1:51:02] in the breach and put his hands on a
[1:51:05] sinful man, a holy God, and bridge the
[1:51:07] way and stand in his place, make
[1:51:09] intercession for him, and then the man
[1:51:11] shall rise again.
[1:51:14] Brother Brandham's looking at saying
[1:51:16] something really special here because
[1:51:18] Job had been crying out for a mediator
[1:51:21] that somebody would come. I wish there
[1:51:22] would be Job calls a days man, an
[1:51:25] advocate who would stand and be in my
[1:51:27] immediate. He he's calling out for that,
[1:51:29] calling out for that. And brother
[1:51:31] Brenham says Elliu comes along and he
[1:51:33] tells Job there's going to be one
[1:51:35] coming. And that's what I want. That's
[1:51:38] the most one of the most special things
[1:51:40] in this study.
[1:51:42] Um let's see here. Let's take a look at
[1:51:45] Job 33.
[1:51:54] Ell
[1:51:56] um Ellie is going to talk about
[1:51:57] different reasons for suffering. And of
[1:51:59] course she says some suffering we do uh
[1:52:02] um cause ourselves. Doesn't mean that
[1:52:04] it's always sin. But uh um I might
[1:52:07] overeat and I might get a get sick to my
[1:52:11] stomach. Doesn't mean I've sinned. But
[1:52:13] no, Job also says that God can instruct
[1:52:16] us through suffering
[1:52:18] and through suffering, God can also keep
[1:52:21] us from worse things.
[1:52:24] So in Job 33, Ellie is going to be
[1:52:27] talking about the pit multiple times and
[1:52:30] he keepeth back his soul from the pit,
[1:52:33] his life from perishing by the sword.
[1:52:36] The man who's going through suffering is
[1:52:37] chasened with pain upon his bed, the
[1:52:39] malt of his bones with strong pain. Why
[1:52:42] is this?
[1:52:44] One of the purposes for suffering that
[1:52:45] nobody had seen yet is that God has sent
[1:52:48] suffering to protect us from something
[1:52:50] worse.
[1:52:52] The only teaching about suffering at
[1:52:54] this time period is bad things happen to
[1:52:56] bad people. So bad things are happening
[1:52:58] to you, better get right fast. Ellie
[1:53:01] says, "No, there's much more to the
[1:53:03] story than that." One purpose of pain is
[1:53:06] to protect the soul of man from the pit.
[1:53:09] Another purpose of pain. This is a um
[1:53:12] from the apostle Paul. Paul had this uh
[1:53:16] thorn in the flesh.
[1:53:18] Lest I should be exalted above measure
[1:53:20] through the abundance of revelations.
[1:53:22] There is given to me a thorn in the
[1:53:24] flesh. The messenger of Satan to buffet
[1:53:26] me lest I should be exalted above
[1:53:28] measure. Another purpose of pain is to
[1:53:32] preserve us from temptation.
[1:53:37] And Paul continues to say he Paul prayed
[1:53:40] three times that this would be taken
[1:53:42] from him and it wasn't.
[1:53:44] But God said to him, "My grace is
[1:53:46] sufficient for thee. My strength is made
[1:53:48] perfect in weakness." Suffering also
[1:53:50] helps us draw closer to God so he can
[1:53:53] teach us. So there's a much bigger
[1:53:57] picture about suffering. CS Lewis said,
[1:53:59] "God whispers to us in our pleasures,
[1:54:02] speaks to us in our conscience, but
[1:54:04] shouts in our pains. Pain is his
[1:54:07] megaphone to rouse a deaf world. God can
[1:54:10] get our attention with pain."
[1:54:14] One uh theologian from earlier days, "It
[1:54:16] is a greater thing to pray for pain's
[1:54:19] conversion than its removal."
[1:54:23] What he means by this, Paul prayed for
[1:54:25] the removal of the thorn in the flesh.
[1:54:29] But it was a greater thing to pray for
[1:54:32] Payne's conversion that this would
[1:54:34] become I would it would become a conduit
[1:54:37] of God's blessing because sometimes we
[1:54:40] do a we we we can go through hard times
[1:54:44] and we can fight him sometimes.
[1:54:47] But sometimes this is just a phase God
[1:54:49] has us through.
[1:54:51] And it could be more useful sometimes
[1:54:54] just to say, "Okay, God, I've fought
[1:54:55] this for a while. I've prayed against
[1:54:57] this for a while, but Lord, maybe I
[1:54:59] should stop fighting it and just say,
[1:55:01] "Lord, what you going to do for me right
[1:55:03] now?" I remember years back,
[1:55:07] I had uh um I was going through a hard
[1:55:11] time. I'd uh I'd asked I wanted to start
[1:55:14] a relationship with a with a sister and
[1:55:16] she said no. Like it hurt bad. That just
[1:55:21] it just kind of dag you turn. It hurts
[1:55:23] bad. So I went for a walk walk along the
[1:55:26] around one of the res little reservoir
[1:55:27] near where we live. I just felt really
[1:55:29] really bad. Um and as I was kind of
[1:55:33] praying and thinking um I was thinking
[1:55:36] through James chapter 1 um but let
[1:55:40] patience have its perfect work. It would
[1:55:42] be perfect in entire wanting nothing.
[1:55:44] And sometimes and as I was praying and
[1:55:47] thinking about that verse, the mental
[1:55:49] picture came to me of a guy on an
[1:55:51] operating table and is having surgery
[1:55:55] performed.
[1:55:56] Surgery is not going to be fun. It's not
[1:55:58] it's it's going to hurt. What if the guy
[1:56:00] on the operating table starts praying,
[1:56:02] "God, I pray you would deliver me from
[1:56:04] this pain. Deliver me from this. Lord, I
[1:56:07] pray that you would deliver me from
[1:56:08] these messengers of Satan who are
[1:56:10] causing me to be hurting." You know
[1:56:11] what? this guy in the operating table,
[1:56:14] God is using the doctor to do a work of
[1:56:17] healing.
[1:56:19] And sometimes we can be fighting that
[1:56:22] and praying against the doctor. God, get
[1:56:24] this. Get the behind me, Satan. It's not
[1:56:27] Satan. It's the doctor. And sometimes we
[1:56:31] might just need to sit down and say,
[1:56:32] "Okay, Lord, you've got me here for
[1:56:34] something. I don't know how long I'm
[1:56:36] going to be here, but it really doesn't
[1:56:37] matter anymore because I've been here
[1:56:38] long enough. Just take care of it, Lord.
[1:56:41] And not try to keep jumping off the
[1:56:42] operating table. Whatever this time of
[1:56:46] my life is meant for, God, I'm all
[1:56:49] yours.
[1:56:50] Just don't take longer than necessary.
[1:56:53] That's that's kind of the picture that
[1:56:54] we can pray for. It's a greater thing to
[1:56:56] pray for pain's conversion than its
[1:56:59] removal.
[1:57:01] And Eleuse
[1:57:05] speaks. Yes, Elfaz, God does speak
[1:57:08] through dreams and visions. He speaks
[1:57:10] through our sufferings.
[1:57:12] But the biggest part of Elahu's message
[1:57:14] is that God also speaks through a
[1:57:17] mediator.
[1:57:19] And Eloh is going to answer in chapter
[1:57:21] 33 one of Job's biggest questions.
[1:57:26] He says, "If there be a messenger,"
[1:57:29] and messenger is an angel of the Lord.
[1:57:32] If there be a messenger with him, an
[1:57:34] interpreter, one among a thousand,
[1:57:38] to show unto man his righteousness,
[1:57:42] then he's gracious unto him and says,
[1:57:43] "Deliver him from going down to the pit.
[1:57:45] I have found a ransom."
[1:57:49] Ransom is a pretty important word
[1:57:50] because Jesus Christ was our ransom.
[1:57:54] And the book of Job's hard to read
[1:57:56] because it's written in poetry. Poetry
[1:57:58] in translation.
[1:58:00] Really hard. But what Elohu is saying
[1:58:02] here, a guy is going through a trial and
[1:58:06] if to the person who's going through a
[1:58:07] trial, if a messenger comes to this guy
[1:58:09] going through a trial, someone who can
[1:58:12] interpret the trial to him, help him to
[1:58:15] see what's really going on. If Job had
[1:58:18] known,
[1:58:20] Job, the reason you're going through
[1:58:21] this is so we could give Satan the black
[1:58:23] eye. That would have made the world of
[1:58:26] difference for Job. Praise God. But
[1:58:29] didn't know that.
[1:58:30] But if there could be a messenger, an
[1:58:33] interpreter to this one who's going
[1:58:35] through a trial to show unto man his
[1:58:38] righteousness, that God's gracious unto
[1:58:40] him. He says, "Deliver him from going
[1:58:43] down to the pit." The the messenger
[1:58:45] comes standing in the breach, standing
[1:58:46] in the gap. Here's the one who's on
[1:58:48] trial. Here's God. The messenger comes,
[1:58:51] one among a thousand. He's righteous. I
[1:58:54] I'm testifying on his behalf. Deliver
[1:58:56] him from going down to the pit. God's
[1:58:58] gracious. I found a ransom.
[1:59:02] Elohu is speaking about Jesus Christ.
[1:59:06] It's almost like it's written in code
[1:59:08] here, but you can see it. This is what
[1:59:10] brother Brandham is talking about.
[1:59:12] Everybody wanted to find God down
[1:59:14] through the age. Job of old only knew
[1:59:16] where he was. But God was dealing with
[1:59:18] the saint in this case. There the saint
[1:59:20] was scrapping his boil, scraping his
[1:59:22] boils. He looked a lot more like a saint
[1:59:25] in chapter one than he does in chapter
[1:59:27] three. But God's not about the outward
[1:59:29] appearance. He's about character of the
[1:59:31] heart. Some of his church friends come
[1:59:34] to him, say with their backs, turn to
[1:59:35] him. Not much consolation there. But Job
[1:59:38] wanted to know, "Oh, if I only knew
[1:59:39] where his where his house was." When a
[1:59:42] man is hungering and thirst for God, God
[1:59:44] will draw nigh to the man always. Then
[1:59:47] when his church members came, couldn't
[1:59:48] console him, accuse him of being a
[1:59:50] seeker. Sinner said he'd sinned before
[1:59:51] God. Job knew he hadn't sinned. He knew
[1:59:53] he was all right. But then God sent a
[1:59:55] young man down by the name of Eliu to
[1:59:58] meet Job, perfect type of Christ. He
[2:00:01] didn't accuse Job of being a secret
[2:00:02] sinner. He corrected him without
[2:00:05] accusing him. That's a pretty great
[2:00:07] thing.
[2:00:08] He tried to tell him of someone who
[2:00:11] would come and stand in the breach in
[2:00:13] the last days. Put his hand upon a
[2:00:16] sinful man and upon a holy God and
[2:00:18] bridge the way. And that is exactly what
[2:00:22] is talked about right here. This
[2:00:25] messenger come standing in the gap. He
[2:00:28] is the ransom. Paul speaks about this
[2:00:31] very same thing.
[2:00:34] There is one God, one mediator between
[2:00:37] God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who
[2:00:40] gave himself a ransom for all to be
[2:00:44] testified in due time.
[2:00:48] Elahu was prophesying. Paul is speaking
[2:00:51] about the fulfillment. And Elahu goes
[2:00:54] on, "This ransom is going to come.
[2:00:56] Deliver him for I provided a ransom for
[2:00:58] him." Elle goes on, "What happens to the
[2:01:01] man after he's ransomed his flesh will
[2:01:04] be fresher than the child's. He'll
[2:01:06] return to the days of his youth." Sound
[2:01:08] like a new birth.
[2:01:10] He'll pray unto God. He'll be favorable
[2:01:12] unto him. He shall see his face with
[2:01:14] joy. He will render unto man his
[2:01:16] righteousness. He will have a new
[2:01:19] relationship with God. He'll have
[2:01:21] victory over death. He lookth upon men,
[2:01:24] and if any say, "I have sinned. If a
[2:01:27] virgin that which is right, it profited
[2:01:28] me not." He will deliver his soul from
[2:01:30] going into the pit, and his life shall
[2:01:33] see the light. There's deliverance by
[2:01:36] grace after repentance.
[2:01:39] So, Eloh has a he has a powerful
[2:01:41] message. There are other purposes for
[2:01:43] suffering than just punishing the
[2:01:45] guilty. God speaks to us in our trials.
[2:01:49] He speaks to us in our pain. Sometimes
[2:01:52] that suffering is actually meant to
[2:01:54] preserve us from evil. And the best
[2:01:56] thing is Job,
[2:01:59] if there's a deep calling in the deep.
[2:02:01] There's got to be a deep to respond.
[2:02:02] You're hungering for a mediator. There
[2:02:04] is going to God's already got it. Job.
[2:02:07] Don't worry about it because there's
[2:02:08] going to be one. He is going to be our
[2:02:10] ransom. Death and suffering will be
[2:02:13] defeated. And let's look at the end of
[2:02:15] Job 37 as we're finishing this up.
[2:02:23] And Job chapter 37. Eloh is using nature
[2:02:25] to speak about um God. And he's talked
[2:02:28] about how God takes care of the the
[2:02:31] whole water cycle. That's an example of
[2:02:33] God using all kinds of uh um God's able
[2:02:36] to un um to take care of earth and
[2:02:38] things like that. And then um uh verse
[2:02:42] at at the end of chapter 37, he's uh
[2:02:45] let's look at uh like verse 16. Do you
[2:02:48] know the balancings of the clouds, the
[2:02:50] wondrous works of him which perfect in
[2:02:52] knowledge? Um um he's talking about how
[2:02:56] a storm is going to be coming. how how
[2:02:58] thy garments are warm when he quietth
[2:03:00] the earth by the south wind. That's
[2:03:02] nice. The south wind is nice. Um verse
[2:03:05] 22.
[2:03:07] Um fair weather comes from the north
[2:03:09] with God is terrible majesty touching
[2:03:12] the Almighty. We can't find him. He's
[2:03:14] excellent in power and judgment and
[2:03:16] plenty of justice. He's talking about uh
[2:03:18] the weather so much and it's almost as
[2:03:21] he's talking about the weather. The
[2:03:23] winds this, the winds that Elahu is the
[2:03:26] forerunner because the very next verse,
[2:03:30] the Lord answered Job out of a
[2:03:34] whirlwind. Elahu is just setting the
[2:03:36] stage for God. And we're going to we're
[2:03:40] going to close here, but I just want to
[2:03:43] this is something really special in this
[2:03:46] verse. The Lord answered Jehovah out of
[2:03:49] the whirlwind. Almost every time and
[2:03:52] with one exception up to this point in
[2:03:55] the book of Job, God is referred to as
[2:03:57] the Almighty.
[2:03:59] That's pretty powerful. God can the
[2:04:01] Almighty can crush things. He can he can
[2:04:04] just send his arrows through somebody.
[2:04:06] He can do all these things. But this is
[2:04:08] the Lord Jehovah. This is the first time
[2:04:12] Jehovah is being used here. The God who
[2:04:16] reveals himself.
[2:04:19] In Job's trial, there's another
[2:04:21] revelation of God coming. The answer to
[2:04:25] Job's problems was not an explanation
[2:04:28] about God, but a revelation from God.
[2:04:33] God never does explain himself. No, sir.
[2:04:37] And we always get in trouble when we
[2:04:39] demand explanations from God. But when
[2:04:42] God comes,
[2:04:44] that's a mighty thing. God speaks in
[2:04:46] storms to Israel on Mount Si to Elijah,
[2:04:51] to Ezekiel, and he speaks to Job in this
[2:04:55] storm also. And all that Job can say
[2:05:00] after God comes because God says, "This
[2:05:03] is what you asked for, Job. You wanted
[2:05:05] your day in court. everyone to be have
[2:05:07] me come before you. And Job isn't the
[2:05:09] same. I repent in dust and ashes that I
[2:05:13] have that I have questioned your justice
[2:05:16] because God is God. God is perfection.
[2:05:19] An unjust God is an oxymoron. It's
[2:05:22] impossible for God to be unjust.
[2:05:26] But the very end of the book um
[2:05:30] over in Job chapter 42,
[2:05:33] Job uh gets everything back and not just
[2:05:37] everything.
[2:05:38] God meets his own
[2:05:41] God satisfies his own law. Book of
[2:05:44] Exodus, if a thief is caught red-handed,
[2:05:48] the thief has to restore double.
[2:05:52] So, Satan, he asked, "Can I smite
[2:05:55] everything that Job has?" God says,
[2:05:57] "Yes."
[2:05:59] And God's letting Satan do all this
[2:06:00] stuff, but only God does in the end.
[2:06:02] Satan, you're going to have to restore
[2:06:04] double because God's laws of restoration
[2:06:08] bankrupt Satan because he doesn't just
[2:06:10] have to he doesn't just have to return
[2:06:12] what was taken. He has to restore
[2:06:15] double. And that happens. He had Job had
[2:06:19] uh um 7,000 sheep. God gives him 14. He
[2:06:25] had 3,000 camels. He got six at the end.
[2:06:28] He had a 500 yolk of oxin. He has a
[2:06:31] thousand. He has a thousand chia
[2:06:32] assasses. And he also got seven sons and
[2:06:35] three daughters. Satan had to restore
[2:06:38] double. So when we go through trials,
[2:06:41] we're going to win.
[2:06:44] We're going to defeat Satan, but it's
[2:06:45] also a way of bankrupting Satan because
[2:06:48] he has to restore double.
[2:06:51] In the end though, Job isn't going to
[2:06:54] the bank saying, "Man, look at this."
[2:06:55] Ching, chuch-ching, chuch-ching. I get
[2:06:58] more oxen, more cattle, more sheep. I
[2:07:01] get all these things. Ching. This is
[2:07:02] This is This tribe was a wealth maker.
[2:07:05] No, it's not at all. To Job, his
[2:07:09] greatest blessing was knowing God better
[2:07:13] and understanding his working in a
[2:07:16] deeper way. So whatever trials we're
[2:07:20] going through,
[2:07:22] you can look around us, around the
[2:07:24] world. God created everything, he keeps
[2:07:27] it all running. I have a hard enough
[2:07:29] time keeping my car running, but God
[2:07:32] keeps everything running. We can trust
[2:07:35] him.
[2:07:38] And
[2:07:39] if it's any consolation to us, Job
[2:07:42] doesn't know this. He didn't know this.
[2:07:44] I'm telling you though, we are Satan's
[2:07:46] answer. We're going through a trial to
[2:07:50] demonstrate that God is faithful. That
[2:07:54] we serve God out of love, not because he
[2:07:57] gives us great things. We have Satan's
[2:07:59] answer.
[2:08:02] There's the devil's answer here in this
[2:08:04] church, in these pews. There's the
[2:08:06] devil's answer. We are his victory. We
[2:08:10] are proof of his victory. God's a good
[2:08:13] God. Though he slay me, I'll trust him.
[2:08:17] A life lived based upon a relationship
[2:08:19] with God, not looking after the stuff,
[2:08:23] but with God that is proof of his
[2:08:25] victory. And that's what by God's grace,
[2:08:29] you and I get to be. We're called to
[2:08:32] serve God
[2:08:35] just by living a Christian life even
[2:08:37] when things aren't great. Amen. Let's
[2:08:40] pray.
[2:08:46] Lord Jesus, I thank you so much for this
[2:08:50] book of Job. And there's so much that we
[2:08:54] can glean that
[2:08:58] we count him happy which endures.
[2:09:01] the guy who gives up. We read a story
[2:09:04] about someone who gives up who can't
[2:09:05] make it to the end of the battle. He
[2:09:07] just leaves and like, "Oh, that's you
[2:09:09] feel so sad because, you know, if you
[2:09:11] just hung on a little longer, it's so we
[2:09:14] feel so sorry and sad seeing someone go
[2:09:18] away in the before the victory." But
[2:09:20] Job, we count him happy which endures.
[2:09:24] We've seen the patience, the
[2:09:25] steadfastness of Job.
[2:09:28] We've seen the end or the purpose of the
[2:09:31] Lord. That the Lord is pitiful. He's
[2:09:35] compassionate.
[2:09:37] God doesn't answer and wrangle with our
[2:09:39] words. He answers and speaks to the
[2:09:42] needs of our heart.
[2:09:44] I think about Elijah
[2:09:46] when he feels like he's just going to
[2:09:48] give up because I've done all this for
[2:09:50] nothing and my life is a danger. And he
[2:09:52] goes and brother Bradam says that God
[2:09:55] sent the angel with the softest hands.
[2:10:02] And perhaps we're going through a hard
[2:10:04] time right now. There have been bumps
[2:10:06] and bruises maybe the personal life
[2:10:08] maybe in our families.
[2:10:10] [Music]
[2:10:12] Elijah felt pretty rough.
[2:10:15] And God sent this angel with the softest
[2:10:18] hands,
[2:10:21] gave Elijah rest,
[2:10:24] and when Elijah got up the next morning,
[2:10:26] there was just a nice meal prepared by
[2:10:27] the fire.
[2:10:30] There wasn't any kind of debate. It's
[2:10:32] like, "How could you be so stupid? You
[2:10:34] just saw God defeat Mount Carmel. Why
[2:10:37] could you run?" No, he knows that we're
[2:10:40] but dust. He knows the frailty of flesh.
[2:10:44] God ministered to Elijah
[2:10:47] and then sent him back on his way.
[2:10:49] Encouraged him and Elijah kept on going.
[2:10:50] I pray Lord that you would send the
[2:10:52] angel with the softest hands.
[2:10:55] Lord, touch each heart. Lord, I pray you
[2:10:58] give us courage and patience, Father.
[2:11:02] Lord, if there are situations that we go
[2:11:04] through, there are some situations in
[2:11:05] life that change fast and there other
[2:11:07] situations just go on for a long time. I
[2:11:11] pray Lord if we're in one of those
[2:11:13] longterm trials that you just help us
[2:11:15] Father not to jump off the operating
[2:11:18] table but open our hearts that you just
[2:11:21] have your way. It's what the Apostle
[2:11:24] Paul did three times. He prayed against
[2:11:26] that thing. Finally said, "No,
[2:11:30] your grace is sufficient for me."
[2:11:33] Lord, I pray that you would
[2:11:37] where possible take the pain away. But
[2:11:39] Lord,
[2:11:41] otherwise make that pain just a pipeline
[2:11:43] of your blessing into our lives that we
[2:11:46] come to know you better.
[2:11:49] Lord, I pray that you'd help each one of
[2:11:51] us just to keep going on
[2:11:54] because there is a destination.
[2:11:58] We're not seeking blessings in this
[2:12:00] life. We just want to come forth as
[2:12:02] gold. We come before you and hear, "Well
[2:12:05] done, thou good and faithful servant."
[2:12:08] Lord, we live for that. I pray, oh God,
[2:12:10] that you'd strengthen each and everyone,
[2:12:12] Lord, in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:12:17] God bless you.
[2:12:19] [Music]
[2:12:22] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[2:12:26] I've learned to trust in God.
[2:12:32] through it all.
[2:12:36] Yes. Through it all,

[2:13:36] I've had questions for for tomorrow.
[2:13:41] There have been times I didn't know
[2:13:44] right from wrong.
[2:13:48] If you'd like to stand and worship him.
[2:13:50] In every situation,
[2:13:54] God gave blessing
[2:13:56] consolation.
[2:13:57] [Music]
[2:13:58] that my trials,
[2:14:01] they come to make me strong.
[2:14:06] And I can say that through it all,
[2:14:11] [Applause]
[2:14:13] yes, through it all,
[2:14:16] I have learned to trust in Jesus.
[2:14:22] I've learned to trust in God.
[2:14:26] Yes. Through it all.
[2:14:31] Oh, through it all,
[2:14:36] I've learned to depend on his word.
[2:14:43] [Music]
[2:14:46] I've been a lot of places and I've seen
[2:14:51] a many faces.
[2:14:54] Yes. Yes. There have been times I felt
[2:14:58] so all alone.
[2:15:03] But it is in that lonely hour,
[2:15:08] in that precious lonely hour.
[2:15:13] Jesus let me know. Yes, Lord. I was his
[2:15:18] own.
[2:15:20] And I can say that through it all.
[2:15:24] Hallelujah.
[2:15:26] Yes. Through it all,
[2:15:30] I have learned to trust in Jesus.
[2:15:35] I've learned to trust in God.
[2:15:39] Oh, through it all.
[2:15:42] [Music]
[2:15:44] Oh, through it all
[2:15:49] I have learned to depend upon his word.
[2:15:58] So I thank God for the mountains. Oh,
[2:16:02] hallelujah. And I thank him. Could we
[2:16:05] just thank you? Thank you, Lord.
[2:16:08] I thank him for all the storms he's
[2:16:11] brought
[2:16:13] me through.
[2:16:16] Because I never have a problem.
[2:16:21] I would know my God could solve them. I
[2:16:26] would know what faith and his word can
[2:16:31] do.
[2:16:33] That's why I can justify through it all.
[2:16:37] Through
[2:16:38] it all. Yes. Through it all. Through it
[2:16:43] all, I have learned to trust in Jesus.
[2:16:48] I've learned to trust in God.
[2:16:54] Through it all, trusting in the Lord.
[2:16:58] Through it all,
[2:17:01] it all I have learned to depend
[2:17:06] upon his word. Yes, I've learned to
[2:17:11] depend
[2:17:13] upon his word.
[2:17:17] [Music]
[2:17:19] Hallelujah. Can we just sing maybe just
[2:17:21] a little beginning of that? I'd rather
[2:17:23] have Jesus.
[2:17:27] [Music]
[2:17:29] I'd rather
[2:17:33] have Jesus
[2:17:36] than silver
[2:17:39] or gold.
[2:17:43] I'd ra
[2:17:45] Oh yes.
[2:17:47] Oh, let's just let him water that word.
[2:17:50] Have riches
[2:17:53] untold.
[2:17:55] Oh, I'd rather
[2:17:58] rather have Jesus
[2:18:02] than house
[2:18:06] or lamb.
[2:18:08] Oh, I'd rather
[2:18:13] be healed
[2:18:15] by his name.
[2:18:22] Thank you to be
[2:18:25] the
[2:18:26] king
[2:18:28] of all
[2:18:31] [Music]
[2:18:33] may
[2:18:35] be held
[2:18:38] his
[2:18:41] dress way.
[2:18:47] Oh, I'd ra
[2:18:51] have Jesus
[2:18:55] than any
[2:19:00] this world
[2:19:04] could afford
[2:19:07] today.
[2:19:09] [Music]
[2:19:12] Oh, for I'd rather
[2:19:17] have Jesus
[2:19:20] than men.
[2:19:25] [Music]
[2:19:26] I'd rather
[2:19:29] be faithful
[2:19:32] to his
[2:19:35] dear
[2:19:37] Lord, not rather
[2:19:42] Have Jesus
[2:19:45] spend worldwide
[2:19:49] faith?
[2:19:51] I'd rather
[2:19:54] be rather be true
[2:19:57] to his holy
[2:20:01] name
[2:20:03] than to be
[2:20:06] the king. Oh yes.
[2:20:10] Oh,
[2:20:13] your name
[2:20:15] for be.
[2:20:26] Oh,
[2:20:28] I'd rather I'd rather have Jesus
[2:20:34] than anything
[2:20:38] than anything.
[2:20:40] this old world. This whole world and yes
[2:20:47] today. Oh, thank you Lord. There to be
[2:20:53] to be
[2:20:55] the king.
[2:21:04] Oh
[2:21:09] sh
[2:21:11] [Music]
[2:21:17] I' rather
[2:21:19] rather haveus
[2:21:23] than anything.
[2:21:28] Oh, this soul world
[2:21:33] cannot hold
[2:21:36] today.
[2:21:40] I I want to sing this last line in a
[2:21:42] minute again.
[2:21:45] You know, brother Bram says we dare to
[2:21:49] compare our lives in the church age book
[2:21:52] with men like Polycarp and others and we
[2:21:55] look at their lives and say how did they
[2:21:57] do what they did? How did they stand in
[2:22:00] the test and the time that they stood
[2:22:01] in? Brother Ram makes a tremendous
[2:22:04] statement.
[2:22:06] He says God gave them supreme faith
[2:22:11] for the supreme hour. Right.
[2:22:15] And then he takes it right back down to
[2:22:16] our lives and says there's a crown of
[2:22:19] martyr for the martyrs that's given
[2:22:22] sometimes he said it's for those that
[2:22:24] they win in that way and it's he said as
[2:22:28] it applies to us it's a daily striving.
[2:22:32] We receive a crown of glory and that
[2:22:35] daily striving just as we sing this
[2:22:38] right here then to be a king of a vast
[2:22:40] domain. You you realize that that part
[2:22:42] of being the answer to Satan's question
[2:22:45] isn't about what we say. It's about the
[2:22:48] life that's being lived through us. We
[2:22:50] can be going right through our job. You
[2:22:52] get in the car and here you are even on
[2:22:55] your way to church and you don't feel
[2:22:57] like it. You don't you'd feel down. You
[2:22:59] feel everything else just feels like
[2:23:00] it's going along and and you don't even
[2:23:02] feel spiritual.
[2:23:04] But you're walking in obedience to God's
[2:23:06] word because you trust him. Hallelujah.
[2:23:09] You love him and that love has produced
[2:23:11] a trust and right out of your life, this
[2:23:14] right here is being is sounding out.
[2:23:18] It's sounding out. That's what Paul said
[2:23:21] in Thessalonians. He said, "Your faith
[2:23:23] has sounded out to others." This is
[2:23:26] being sounded out. Hallelujah. Through
[2:23:28] our lives. Amen. I'd rather have that.
[2:23:31] Abraham, how did you feel there when the
[2:23:33] king of Sodom offered you this and
[2:23:35] offered you this and offered you this?
[2:23:39] Abraham said, I don't want to shoe latch
[2:23:40] it. I've not done anything for any
[2:23:44] glory, for anything this world can give
[2:23:47] me. I did it to rescue my fallen
[2:23:51] brother.
[2:23:53] What a what a characteristic of Christ
[2:23:55] was displayed.
[2:23:57] And in the midst of all that, Satan
[2:23:59] always has offers he can make. Is that
[2:24:02] right? Always offers. But I'm so
[2:24:05] thankful that God is present
[2:24:10] and God has anchored something in our
[2:24:12] lives that even as the prophet said when
[2:24:14] Satan came up near him and he said
[2:24:16] everything he was saying was the truth.
[2:24:21] All reasoning was agreeing. And he said,
[2:24:23] "I was about ready to say if that's how
[2:24:27] he's going to be. He said, "But there
[2:24:30] rose up something within me." And the
[2:24:33] prophet said, "Thank if that new birth
[2:24:34] hadn't been there." Aren't you glad that
[2:24:36] the See, the answer is within you. The
[2:24:39] answer is there. It's Christ. Yes, it
[2:24:42] is. I say, "Oh, God, like that last
[2:24:46] statement that brother Raph read, God,
[2:24:49] like when Paul realized, Lord, I'm not
[2:24:52] going to pray for pain's removal. My
[2:24:55] flesh wants to. My flesh wants to. My
[2:24:58] flesh, your flesh does not like going
[2:25:00] through trials. But the real reality of
[2:25:02] it is God's proving his word right
[2:25:05] through our lives. Lord, give me grace.
[2:25:08] Amen. Like the prophet said in three
[2:25:10] kinds of believers, Lord, don't keep
[2:25:12] them from me, but give me the grace to
[2:25:15] go through them. Don't you appreciate
[2:25:17] the Lord this morning?
[2:25:20] I don't know how you feel. I felt like
[2:25:23] we had a cliffnotes
[2:25:26] on the book of Job.
[2:25:29] [Applause]
[2:25:32] I so appreciated that. You know, when
[2:25:35] you no doubt many of you, there's titles
[2:25:37] of messages coming right to your mind
[2:25:39] while it's being preached right here.
[2:25:41] Yes, sir. Because the book of Job, it's
[2:25:43] the book of a son who's been positioned.
[2:25:47] Yes, sir. And trials have come. And it's
[2:25:50] real exemplary of the bride of Jesus
[2:25:52] Christ
[2:25:54] all the way through there. And I could
[2:25:57] tell you how many can testify and say,
[2:25:58] "God is faithful."
[2:26:01] God is faithful. If there's anything we
[2:26:03] want to do within our lives, avail
