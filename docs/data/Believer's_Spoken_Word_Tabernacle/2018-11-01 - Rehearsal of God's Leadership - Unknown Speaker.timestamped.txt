[30:40] once they're this small
[30:46] [Music]
[30:57] [Music]
[31:00] one
[31:04] [Music]
[31:09] in that pressure it's so precious that
[31:14] that that's the desire of our heart Lord
[31:17] we want what what you want you know I
[31:22] love the statement brother branham makes
[31:24] in the message breach we are redeemed we
[31:28] no longer want our own choice but yet
[31:33] how many times have we made our own
[31:35] choices but you see God comes back and
[31:40] he looks around when that soul has been
[31:42] redeemed and that want to has been
[31:45] changed to want to please him then he
[31:49] doesn't look at the mistakes he looks at
[31:51] the want when we are redeemed we no
[31:55] longer want our own choice we want his
[32:00] choice we want what he wants amen
[32:04] sometimes the choice that God has for us
[32:06] and for our lives it's going to look
[32:09] impossible to our natural mortal being
[32:13] but God didn't call us because that we
[32:16] were capable he called us because we
[32:20] belong to him and all that we have to do
[32:24] the greatest thing we have to do is if
[32:27] we can get ourselves out of the way then
[32:29] the Holy Spirit moves upon the word that
[32:32] he's already sown in our hearts and he
[32:34] performs it amen don't you just love the
[32:38] Lord Amen I tell you what we really had
[32:42] some some really really good services
[32:45] here I'll tell you I just thank God so
[32:48] much Amen for his his visitation and his
[32:52] mindfulness of our needs I don't know
[32:55] about you I've always believed that we
[32:58] need the fivefold ministry
[33:01] we just don't need the office of a
[33:04] pastor we need that as individuals to be
[33:07] in our own assemblies God does have that
[33:10] direction through a pastor but that
[33:12] alone is not enough it's God working
[33:15] through every office of his ministry
[33:19] aren't you glad aren't you glad you can
[33:22] recognize that to recognize his voice I
[33:25] tell you God just come by our way and
[33:28] I'm just so thankful to the Lord I'm
[33:31] just looking forward to what the Lord
[33:32] has for us here this coming weekend amen

[35:07] deeper Lord in our lives we love you
[35:10] Lord we praise you tonight the name of
[35:13] Jesus Christ amen amen if you will turn
[35:18] with me to the book of Deuteronomy and
[35:25] just Deuteronomy chapter 1 is where I'd
[35:27] like to begin
[35:42] verse 1 of Deuteronomy 1 these be the
[35:48] words which Moses spake unto all Israel
[35:51] on this side of Jordan in the wilderness
[35:53] in the plain over against the Red Sea
[35:56] between paronto fell Laban has arose and
[36:00] dition there are 11 days journey from
[36:04] Horeb by the way of Mount Seir on to
[36:07] Kadesh Barnea and it came to pass in the
[36:10] fortieth year in the eleventh month on
[36:13] the first day of the month that Moses
[36:16] spake unto the children of Israel
[36:17] according unto all that the Lord had
[36:20] given him in commandment unto them after
[36:24] he had slain Sion the king of the
[36:26] amorite switch dwelt in heshbon and AAG
[36:29] the king of Bashan which dwelt in
[36:31] Astaroth in a dream on this side of
[36:34] Jordan in the land of Moab began Moses
[36:37] to declare this law say the Lord our God
[36:41] spake unto us in Horeb saying he have
[36:44] dwelt long enough in this mouth turn you
[36:47] and take your journey and go to the
[36:50] Mount of the amorite and unto the places
[36:53] not there unto in the plain and in the
[36:56] hills and in the Vale and in the south
[36:58] and by the seaside for the land of the
[37:01] canaanites and unto lebanon unto the
[37:04] great river the river Euphrates behold I
[37:08] have set the land before you go in and
[37:12] possess the land which the Lord swear
[37:14] unto your father's Abraham Isaac and
[37:18] Jacob to give unto them and to their
[37:21] seed after them may God bless his word
[37:25] as you're being seated I'd like to keep
[37:28] on reading if we could there in verse 18
[37:32] of the same chapter
[37:34] and I commanded you at the time all the
[37:38] things which you should do and when we
[37:41] departed from Horeb we went through all
[37:44] the great and terrible wilderness which
[37:46] you saw by the way of the mountain of
[37:49] the amorite s-- as the Lord our God
[37:52] commanded us and we came to Kadesh
[37:55] Barnea and I said unto you ye are come
[37:58] into unto the mountain of the hammerites
[38:00] which the Lord our God doth give unto us
[38:04] behold the LORD hath set the land before
[38:07] thee go up and possess it as the Lord
[38:10] God of Our Fathers hath said unto thee
[38:13] fear not neither be discouraged I'd like
[38:19] to just take a thought here tonight in
[38:23] that time of turning northward how that
[38:27] God has spoke through Moses to the
[38:31] people and I'd really like to focus on
[38:33] just a thought of this here and you
[38:36] never recognize within this of the book
[38:39] of Deuteronomy in these opening chapters
[38:42] God is rehearsing to Israel his
[38:48] faithfulness and his leadership and
[38:52] that's what I'd like to speak to you
[38:54] tonight on rehearsal of God's leadership
[38:58] because we're that Israel was standing
[39:02] here at this time they were not in the
[39:05] promise of which God had made
[39:09] Israel was dwelling in the wilderness
[39:11] but the wilderness was not the goal the
[39:14] goal was not even to come out of Egypt
[39:16] that was only a part of the full
[39:19] equation but the full goal was that they
[39:22] would come out of Egypt and then they
[39:25] would go in to the promised land and yet
[39:29] God would bring this around to them here
[39:33] Moses being moved by the Spirit of God
[39:36] to rehearse to the children of Israel in
[39:40] this time it's a tie it's a crucial time
[39:42] it's a time where 40 years has expired
[39:46] according
[39:47] what God has spoken regarding the
[39:50] generation that rejected God's
[39:53] leadership they rejected his leadership
[39:56] and failed to move in now Moses in
[39:59] bringing them back to this place to
[40:01] speak to them that it's time to move and
[40:05] take our journey and go northward God is
[40:09] moving and speaking to them to let them
[40:11] know that if there is to be mindful of
[40:14] his leadership in all things I want you
[40:18] to think about this of how that God when
[40:20] we look at it of how that God had met
[40:23] Moses there before God ever sent Moses
[40:27] down to the to deliver the children of
[40:31] Israel God made himself known to Moses
[40:34] and God when he speaks to Moses he lets
[40:37] him know in Exodus chapter 3 that that
[40:41] I'm gonna send you and it's certainly in
[40:44] verse 12 I'm gonna be with you and this
[40:46] shall be a token unto thee that I've
[40:48] sinned 'they when thou hast brought the
[40:50] people out of Egypt ye shall serve God
[40:53] upon this mountain and we see how that
[40:56] God he goes on to let emotion oh here in
[41:00] verse 16 he reveals himself as the same
[41:05] God as the Living God to Moses now
[41:08] remember up to this time Moses has only
[41:12] heard about God he's never met God he's
[41:18] never heard personally from God so
[41:22] within this time God is setting the
[41:26] pattern of not only how that he's going
[41:29] to deal with the messenger of that of an
[41:33] the spokesman of that hour but this is
[41:36] exactly how that God will deal with the
[41:39] elect children of that hour it's the
[41:41] same way that he dealt with Abraham it's
[41:43] the same way that he dealt with Jacob
[41:45] it's the same way that he dealt with
[41:47] Isaac God never dealt with his people in
[41:51] a manner of just a second handed
[41:53] experience because there's no power in a
[41:56] second hand that experience it's only
[41:58] living off the knowledge of what someone
[42:01] else has come to know and experience but
[42:03] God's desire is for a complete personal
[42:08] experience with him that literally
[42:11] changes a person's life and it lifts us
[42:15] out of just where we are confined to
[42:17] this natural realm but we become in tune
[42:20] with the supernatural God just as God
[42:24] ministers and cares about every need
[42:27] within our life God knows all along the
[42:31] journey he knows what he set out and
[42:33] here God is making known to the people
[42:36] as he's rehearsing his leadership of how
[42:39] that he brought them to this time and
[42:41] how that God spoke to Moses and he let
[42:45] Moses know that I will bring the people
[42:48] up out of the out of the affliction of
[42:51] Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites
[42:54] the Hittites the amorite the parasites
[42:56] and the Hivites and the Jebusites unto a
[42:59] land flowing with milk and honey and I I
[43:02] will say that tonight because that is
[43:05] the focus and that is the goal
[43:07] you see God in the first Exodus was
[43:10] taking a people out of a natural Egypt
[43:14] to a natural land but then notice here
[43:18] the pillar fire comes on the scene again
[43:20] after the crucifixion and the burial
[43:23] death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus
[43:25] Christ
[43:26] here it comes on the scene and here Paul
[43:29] himself meets him face to face and
[43:31] remember it was taking a people from
[43:34] that of just Judea forms Judaism and
[43:38] taking them and placing them in the true
[43:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost as sons and
[43:43] daughters of God and then God moves
[43:45] along once again here it has been down
[43:48] through the church ages and the pillar
[43:50] of fire makes his appearance once again
[43:53] in this hour to bring the Church of the
[43:56] Living God from the baptism of the Holy
[44:00] Ghost of where that we are dwelling to
[44:02] that promise of in my father's house are
[44:06] many mansions the goal is not just to
[44:09] dwell around here
[44:11] just to you know thank God for bringing
[44:13] us out of Egypt but there's a lot more
[44:15] to it than God just bringing us out of
[44:18] Egypt there is a promise that is twofold
[44:21] that God has made he would not only
[44:23] bring us out of the land but he would
[44:26] take us into the land until we come into
[44:29] that land we do not receive the real
[44:33] spiritual blessings of God as a matter
[44:35] of fact the Prophet said outside of the
[44:38] land is sensations but inside of the
[44:41] land his real spiritual blessings
[44:43] because once in the land in the mystery
[44:47] of the birthright of the name within our
[44:49] lives becomes expressed when we are in
[44:53] position in Christ so you see this is
[44:57] God's desire it was God who made this
[44:59] promise unto Abraham it was not Abraham
[45:03] who made it but it was God who made the
[45:06] promise known to Abraham and I want you
[45:08] to think of this of how that God knows
[45:11] and he's mindful of each and every one
[45:14] of us you see God's desire when he sends
[45:16] his word it's not that a word would come
[45:19] to you and I and a man would have such
[45:21] great intellects and abilities being
[45:23] able to produce persons pronounce this
[45:25] word say this word and be able somehow
[45:28] by just words to convince somebody
[45:31] that's not God's Way of the gospel
[45:33] whatsoever but when God is interested in
[45:37] moving and he moves it is God coming by
[45:40] his word just like it said in there in
[45:43] the scriptures with the Apostles that
[45:46] the Lord was with them confirming the
[45:51] word with signs and wonders following
[45:53] you see signs and wonders must accompany
[45:56] a word and a word is that of a voice so
[46:00] it must work harmony in hand and handed
[46:03] to see how that God's desire is that you
[46:05] and I would have such an assurance
[46:07] within his word now you look at it you
[46:10] and I could come to a place and say well
[46:12] this is God's Word you know and God
[46:14] could look to you and I'd say but you
[46:16] just you just believe it but you see God
[46:18] has a way of where he raises the word so
[46:22] that it's not just
[46:23] when it word that we're looking at that
[46:25] we somehow just take in here and are
[46:28] able to sand and position ourselves but
[46:30] God wants to make it so real to where
[46:33] when you don't know how to position
[46:34] yourself the word has positioned you and
[46:38] you cannot be moved that's what God is
[46:42] interested in doing he's interested in
[46:45] being the anchor when you can't explain
[46:47] what's going on so to see how that
[46:49] brother branham makes a statement here a
[46:51] double confirmation I love this he sucks
[46:54] about how that God he said the Covenant
[46:57] was given unconditionally Israel to see
[47:00] natural exchanged it and lost it in
[47:02] Exodus 19 when they made that rational
[47:04] mistake to take away the Grace and
[47:06] accepted law in its place what a
[47:08] rational mistake that Israel made there
[47:11] well watch what he says look God after
[47:13] he made the covenant with Abraham Grace
[47:17] had provided a prophet deliver for them
[47:20] in Egypt to carry out the word of
[47:23] Abraham nor glory you see he couldn't
[47:27] know against Abraham's word being a true
[47:30] prophet it would be the fulfillment and
[47:32] continuity of the word that's already
[47:34] been spoken that's why I truly don't
[47:37] understand when we have people and
[47:39] people's who say we don't need the Old
[47:41] Testament I don't understand that
[47:43] because out if you have not the old you
[47:45] do not have the new because it's out of
[47:48] the old that the new comes forward there
[47:50] had to be a fulfillment the old being a
[47:53] type of a man and the New Testament
[47:55] being a type of the married woman
[47:57] Christ's bride but he would project his
[48:01] life in so all of this is showing a
[48:04] great picture of God's great redemptive
[48:07] story notice he says remember Moses
[48:10] under the bush God said I've heard the
[48:12] cries of my people and I remember my
[48:14] promise before there was any law grace
[48:18] provided it Grace had provided a
[48:20] sacrifice for their guilt a lamb Grace
[48:23] had provided a covenant circumcision was
[48:26] already been provided before law grace
[48:29] had provided a pillar fire to lead them
[48:32] following a profit age
[48:34] security that the Prophet had told them
[48:38] the truth do you catch this the pillar
[48:42] fire is a security what is the pillar
[48:48] fire it's the angel of the covenant none
[48:51] other than the person of Jesus Christ
[48:55] I'll tell you what we just don't need
[48:57] the truth we must have him who
[49:00] vindicates the truth we must have that
[49:03] same pillar of fire remember friends
[49:07] millions have the truth they have this
[49:10] Bible but it takes the Holy Ghost to
[49:14] come upon it and make it live that's why
[49:16] the Prophet would say over and over he
[49:19] said the Bible itself is not altogether
[49:21] the gospel he said the word itself is
[49:24] not altogether the gospel but the gospel
[49:27] is the word in power and demonstration
[49:31] that is the real gospel of Jesus Christ
[49:34] that brings a change in a person's life
[49:37] that leads you from a life of sin that
[49:40] leads you into a place where you can
[49:42] walk in victory and you can actually
[49:45] manifest and reflect the glory of God in
[49:48] your life who does that that law brace
[49:51] provides hallelujah it is a security
[49:57] I'll tell you what is the pastor of this
[49:58] church
[49:59] it is a security that the Holy Ghost is
[50:02] present it is the security to me that I
[50:05] hear from him and he'll whisper to my
[50:07] heart sometimes it might just be a word
[50:09] of the times it's a phrase when there's
[50:12] things I don't know what to do I do not
[50:14] and I refuse to take my mind and my
[50:17] thoughts regarding you I want to know
[50:19] what does father say what does he want
[50:23] right now sometimes I think we get
[50:28] things wrong we take the message as a
[50:30] tool the message is not a tool the
[50:32] message is to be and lead us to a life
[50:35] that is Christ reflecting himself
[50:37] through these instruments
[50:40] we are his tools we are the we are the
[50:44] branches of the vine
[50:47] how is this going to happen God will
[50:50] bring it to past oh my a security that
[50:55] the Prophet had told them the truth it
[50:57] was the word that he was talking about
[50:59] notice the word that he was pointing
[51:02] them to they know that God promised it
[51:06] and here was the pillar of fire
[51:08] confirming it what a double security
[51:11] Grace had done that I don't know about
[51:14] you but I just don't need it back there
[51:17] I need it right now
[51:19] I need that same Holy Ghost right now I
[51:22] believe with all my heart that same
[51:24] pillar of fire is right here tonight I
[51:26] believe that same one has gotten us let
[51:29] me tell you friends there's different
[51:30] one sitting right here in this
[51:32] congregation that has witnessed that
[51:33] pillar fire moved right through the
[51:35] building but if your eyes could not see
[51:37] it you say I'd seen it but you know it's
[51:40] not a man that deals with your heart
[51:42] it's not a man that puts your
[51:44] heartstrings it's not a man that knows
[51:47] the thoughts that goes through your
[51:49] heart but it is the Lord God Himself
[51:51] that knows exactly what you are I have
[51:54] need of that same pillar of fire totally
[52:00] to God to God be the glory
[52:03] but notice brother ben says they wanted
[52:06] something for themselves that they could
[52:08] do have their own creeds and
[52:10] denominations and whatever more and make
[52:12] pharisees and sadducees something they
[52:14] could do their self man is always trying
[52:17] to save himself you can't do it God has
[52:20] already done it you just have to accept
[52:23] it and believe it a pillar of fire to
[52:27] lead them listen this a pillar fire to
[52:29] lead them and guide them to lead them in
[52:31] a way a power Grace had provided a power
[52:35] to condemn their enemy and to make them
[52:38] free the power had already been
[52:42] they didn't know how they were gonna
[52:45] live Egypt they were not gonna leave it
[52:48] under the intellection man but it was
[52:51] the redemptive power of God moving down
[52:54] through his word and God laid claim and
[52:57] he laid hold upon his children and they
[52:59] walked out of Egypt there they came
[53:01] there to the Red Sea and when they got
[53:04] there to the Red Sea they didn't know
[53:06] what they were gonna do and Moses was
[53:09] reminded reminded of the commission I've
[53:11] given you you shall bring them to this
[53:14] land there might be an obstacle in front
[53:19] of you tonight
[53:19] but I'm telling you the promises I will
[53:22] bring you into their land there might be
[53:26] all sorts of things that seem to be in
[53:28] your way but remember all of those
[53:31] things are mere opportunities that God
[53:34] himself might make known his glory and
[53:37] build your faith in a personal testimony
[53:40] because you need that personal testimony
[53:43] when it comes time to with the Giants no
[53:49] repeater God the Bible says that the
[53:52] angel of the Lord led them out of there
[53:56] they didn't have a great machine to pump
[54:01] out the Red Sea how a like our brother
[54:05] Graham said it he said they say huh yeah
[54:09] you know they just the Red Sea was you
[54:12] know ankle-deep at that time what's the
[54:14] response to the prophet the prophet said
[54:16] glory to God he said that's even more of
[54:18] a miracle God took like an ankle deep
[54:20] water and drowned it off a Pharaoh's
[54:23] soldiers I'm telling you you know why
[54:26] because Pharaoh's soldiers the Bible
[54:29] says in Exodus 14 they sought to follow
[54:32] the children of Israel but let me tell
[54:35] you something they did not have the
[54:37] unction and the power and the authority
[54:39] that had been given to the children of
[54:42] Israel what give the children of Israel
[54:45] that power and authority the grace of
[54:47] God had provided the power of
[54:50] god that was needed in order to take
[54:53] them across into their land the
[54:55] Egyptians only followed presumptuously
[55:01] all thanks be to God
[55:04] we are not following planning devised
[55:07] fables of men we are not following and
[55:10] wandering but we are moving under the
[55:13] authority of Almighty God not my power
[55:16] not by my by my spirit saith the Lord
[55:19] this mountain shall be removed Grace
[55:22] provided a power that drowned all of
[55:25] Egypt's army they crossed the Red Sea
[55:33] they had smote Pharaoh they done all
[55:36] these things with grace
[55:39] they done all these things with grease
[55:42] we need to be reminded of God's
[55:45] leadership the work that God began he
[55:49] began it by grease not because that we
[55:51] were worthy grace provided it and that
[55:55] saying what God is calling for it
[55:57] requires His grace to be able to move to
[56:01] provide for what he's calling for yeah
[56:06] amen they've done all these things with
[56:08] grace and then they exchanged grace for
[56:10] a law and that had nothing to do with
[56:13] the royal seed of Abraham brother Ram
[56:16] makes another statement here and I'm
[56:17] just gonna just kind of glance through
[56:19] some of this here it's out of the
[56:20] unveiling of God and it begins to me
[56:23] he's speaking to us and letting us know
[56:25] when he had come to Moses he was a
[56:28] pillar fire he was veiled in the pillar
[56:31] fire there at the bush but here before
[56:34] the people God vindicated him by the
[56:37] same pillar of fire amen
[56:41] they goes on he says now how God had
[56:44] appeared to Moses and he said now but
[56:47] this time he visibly scientifically
[56:51] appeared and vindicated Moses ministry
[56:54] to be the same God that spoke to him
[56:57] because he had appeared in the form of
[56:59] the pillar fire and set the mountain on
[57:02] fire so notice how brother Branham was
[57:05] moving here in this message he moves
[57:07] right here into this time to where here
[57:10] they are here up on the Mount and God
[57:13] moves down and he's vindicating Moses
[57:16] with that pillar of fire now what's all
[57:19] of this
[57:19] he said God first appeared to Moses in
[57:22] the burning bush Vail before the people
[57:26] got veiled again and vindicated Moses by
[57:29] the veil veiling himself with the same
[57:32] fire and same fire came down from Vienna
[57:36] notice God coming down there on the
[57:39] mountain his presence settling down and
[57:42] God talking to Moses now remember he
[57:45] says from then so they could only hear
[57:49] God's Word just the word they heard his
[57:53] voice for Moses was to them the living
[57:56] word Swissy God had so proven that word
[57:59] by Moses now what's what God is doing
[58:03] God is coming by his personal presence
[58:06] and now that the people have been called
[58:09] out of Egypt here where it comes to that
[58:12] of the Mount God is going to be it start
[58:15] speaking a commandment and giving there
[58:18] of the direction in the order of the
[58:20] host he's going to be giving there and
[58:23] putting lives in place and in order
[58:26] things that they themselves will
[58:28] actually do even when they come into
[58:31] that land of promise
[58:32] how many recognize that the land of
[58:34] promise when God brings us into this of
[58:37] the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is not
[58:40] something to wear it's just a
[58:41] slothfulness it's a laziness or lettuce
[58:44] nothing to do but we recognize it's
[58:47] something that moves upon our heart and
[58:49] the desire itself is to please him and
[58:52] to serve his will and his purpose so in
[58:55] order for us to serve his will and his
[58:58] purpose God must make known his will his
[59:01] word to our lives so here is God
[59:03] confirming the word the pillar fire
[59:06] being visible before the people to
[59:09] conform the word that's being spoken by
[59:13] Moses now what is it it was there to
[59:15] vindicate Moses that they should hear
[59:18] the word that's coming forth but the
[59:20] pillar fire coming there and vindicating
[59:23] that was not to keep the people's focus
[59:26] confined to Moses but it was to place
[59:29] their faith in the God who was speaking
[59:32] the word and the word he was speaking
[59:36] was a word that had already been given
[59:39] is that right now notice when we see
[59:43] this where the RAM says he goes on in
[59:46] the same message and he says he was a
[59:48] prophet and God had vindicated his word
[59:51] now he'd went down there and seen signs
[59:53] and wonders and then he says he this
[59:56] people got separated unto themselves a
[59:59] church see a church means called out
[1:00:02] as long as Israel was in Egypt now watch
[1:00:04] this you see this is where that the
[1:00:06] Bible itself is not just is not on just
[1:00:09] a book of history it's not a chronicling
[1:00:11] of events but it's a prophecy just
[1:00:15] exactly what God did with natural Israel
[1:00:17] is the type of what God has done and is
[1:00:21] doing with spiritual Israel when natural
[1:00:24] Israel came out and they failed to go
[1:00:26] into the promised come on now they
[1:00:28] couldn't go right on into the promise
[1:00:30] they rejected that is that right then
[1:00:33] you have a time of 40 years in the midst
[1:00:35] of that 40 years you have Balaam arising
[1:00:38] come on now you have been even when they
[1:00:41] come into that place you have that
[1:00:42] prophetess Jezebel rising up hello now
[1:00:46] in these church ages of the Israel all
[1:00:48] of those things were rising up but it
[1:00:50] does not it cannot it will not stop
[1:00:53] God's program what God has said he will
[1:00:58] fulfill sometimes that ain't turning as
[1:01:04] fast as we think it off to and we think
[1:01:07] we got to help God get pieces in order
[1:01:09] I'm telling you what we don't have to
[1:01:12] have help God get no pieces in order the
[1:01:15] piece that we need to take care of is
[1:01:17] our own self we need to be in prayer and
[1:01:21] getting ourselves so surrendered before
[1:01:23] God before we ever get eyes or one
[1:01:26] another and if we've got our eyes on one
[1:01:28] another in Auto beat on one another's
[1:01:30] heart where we're playing all God make
[1:01:33] us one Lord bind us together or God in
[1:01:36] the unity of the promise cause as far as
[1:01:41] failures you don't need to look any
[1:01:43] further
[1:01:44] you don't even need to look outside of
[1:01:45] this pulpit and I don't need to look any
[1:01:47] further than these pews right here but
[1:01:49] you know what I'm not looking at your
[1:01:51] failures God is not looking at my
[1:01:53] failures but like Moses and we are
[1:01:56] looking we might look through the same
[1:01:58] window but we are recognizing I am
[1:02:01] preaching to people of whom that I am
[1:02:04] one with and
[1:02:05] we have a promise we shall be changed I
[1:02:09] don't know glory be to God
[1:02:14] I don't care how black it looks I don't
[1:02:15] care how hot I don't care if all be
[1:02:17] Saints God said so and what God has said
[1:02:22] it's up to God to produce it whoo glory
[1:02:29] this people notice they got separated
[1:02:31] unto themselves a church while they were
[1:02:33] in Egypt they were not a church but a
[1:02:36] church means are called out look after
[1:02:41] after they was called out of the world
[1:02:44] and became a people then God let herself
[1:02:47] be known that he was that pillar fire he
[1:02:50] proved Moses message after they came out
[1:02:58] he proved Moses message the signs the
[1:03:05] wonders all of those were absolutely
[1:03:07] necessary
[1:03:08] you say all that was for those people
[1:03:11] down in Egypt no no that was for the
[1:03:14] believers because they knew the promise
[1:03:18] of God mutation they walk by the bones
[1:03:21] of Joseph every day but when it came
[1:03:24] time for God to fulfill the promise God
[1:03:27] was on the scene God was right there
[1:03:30] making himself known by fans and wonders
[1:03:32] let me tell you something a person that
[1:03:35] says all we need is the word and we
[1:03:37] don't need signs and wonders I'm telling
[1:03:39] you that's an unbeliever
[1:03:40] we need signs and wonders the Bible says
[1:03:44] signs and wonders follow them that
[1:03:46] believe
[1:03:48] right here God over and over to his
[1:03:51] children he didn't have to provide the
[1:03:53] pillar fire he did it for a security you
[1:03:56] know I God comes in our midst and heals
[1:03:58] the sick and musical needs and opens
[1:04:01] doors and jobs and all these things you
[1:04:03] know why he does it because he can
[1:04:06] and he loves you and I huh and what's he
[1:04:08] doing he's increasing our faith in His
[1:04:12] Word
[1:04:15] you ought to want to see God bless
[1:04:17] people ain't talking about bigger homes
[1:04:20] and bigger cars and whatever more I'm
[1:04:22] talking about you are the desire to see
[1:04:25] God move perfect faith brother brems
[1:04:28] says oh how in my heart I desire to see
[1:04:32] those apostolic times again but
[1:04:35] sometimes in some people's Bible I
[1:04:36] wonder what kind of translation they got
[1:04:40] they've done just a word only God I
[1:04:42] don't want to dead God I believe in a
[1:04:45] Living God I didn't meet a letter
[1:04:47] I knew this message by letter I knew
[1:04:50] scriptures in the Bible but I needed to
[1:04:52] meet God personally I didn't need to
[1:04:54] just hear about him I needed to meet him
[1:04:57] personally
[1:04:57] to where he would literally change my
[1:05:00] life and birth himself into my life
[1:05:03] that's what I needed and that's what the
[1:05:05] Church of the Living God needs huh after
[1:05:12] they was called out of the world now
[1:05:13] watch this
[1:05:14] God proving that the message was right
[1:05:16] message was at hand
[1:05:18] everything was they was going to be
[1:05:20] exodus then veiled his prophet to his
[1:05:23] exodus people here is God think of this
[1:05:28] another time I know this is very simple
[1:05:30] he says it goes on to say this in this
[1:05:31] message how that God the word was first
[1:05:34] coming to Moses and then he said the
[1:05:37] word had to be given out to the people
[1:05:38] and the word itself now once it's given
[1:05:42] out to the people it would be that same
[1:05:44] word that would later become veiled
[1:05:47] behind badger skins I'm looking tonight
[1:05:50] at badger skins that are veiling the
[1:05:53] very word of God confirmed by the pillar
[1:05:57] fire that very word living inside of
[1:06:00] your life it was written there in your
[1:06:02] DNA upon your gene but the pillar of
[1:06:04] fire coming by our way it raises up what
[1:06:08] he has already sober in your life and
[1:06:11] what is it it's veiling they
[1:06:14] hailing God Moses my question how did he
[1:06:27] lead him how did Moses know when to lead
[1:06:30] how did he know now's the time to go
[1:06:34] I mean did he just but you know what I'm
[1:06:38] tired of this I mean after all preached
[1:06:41] fifty parts on this right here
[1:06:42] let's just go how did he know when to go
[1:06:50] if somebody would have been watching
[1:06:52] this from the outside what would they
[1:06:56] have seen they would have seen in
[1:06:58] witnessed here there was a pillar fire
[1:07:02] by night and a cloud by day they would
[1:07:08] watch how that these people would set in
[1:07:10] one place maybe they would sit there for
[1:07:13] a day two days months and then all of a
[1:07:17] sudden they would be up and moving what
[1:07:21] is it that was triggering them to move
[1:07:23] now no doubt there were people there in
[1:07:25] those states think of this friends
[1:07:27] people there in those days I don't know
[1:07:29] if there were others of that they could
[1:07:31] see that pillar fire that cloud that's
[1:07:32] not my point right now but might be even
[1:07:35] to recognize it would be something of
[1:07:37] how that these people would be so
[1:07:40] orchestrated to be led in this time that
[1:07:44] you know you would think that he would
[1:07:45] get the attention of the people you know
[1:07:47] that was surrounding but you know what
[1:07:49] it didn't the only thing that it did is
[1:07:52] cause hatred to rise in the hearts of
[1:07:54] the people whose lands they were passing
[1:07:56] through why did those people hate them
[1:07:58] because they were people of a promise it
[1:08:00] was not those people
[1:08:02] it was demonic spirits that were there
[1:08:05] in the wilderness that were sent forth
[1:08:08] to try to turn him back preacher admit
[1:08:10] now it was spirits that had never
[1:08:12] crossed over the Jordan there they were
[1:08:15] bound that the river Euphrates but them
[1:08:18] spirits themselves who are trying to
[1:08:20] turn away the Covenant people of God but
[1:08:24] it was not the people of God that had
[1:08:26] brought themselves out of Egypt it was
[1:08:28] the grace of God and the same grace of
[1:08:31] God wouldn't move for them had backed
[1:08:33] them across the Jordan that same grace
[1:08:36] of God he gives you an avid dominion
[1:08:39] over all these ecclesiastic
[1:08:41] spirits that would want to try to turn
[1:08:43] back the real believer but there is a
[1:08:46] land across the river and my soul has
[1:08:49] already been birthed into that land
[1:08:52] Barry as they call from the other side
[1:08:58] how long do we stay here it depends on
[1:09:01] how long Papa wants us here turn with me
[1:09:05] in the Bible to Exodus 40 would you do
[1:09:06] that Oh Gloria you love the Lord look at
[1:09:26] this verse 36 and when the cloud was
[1:09:30] taken up from over the tabernacle the
[1:09:33] children of Israel went onward in all
[1:09:35] their journeys but if the cloud were not
[1:09:37] taken up then they journeyed not till
[1:09:41] the day that he was taken up you weren't
[1:09:44] gonna move him if the cloud weren't
[1:09:46] moving if the pillar file1 moving they
[1:09:50] weren't moving you can call him cloud
[1:09:52] followers all you want to call him that
[1:09:54] cloud was not a natural cloud that cloud
[1:09:57] was a supernatural cloud there wasn't
[1:10:01] rockets that made this cloud it was God
[1:10:03] himself by his promise you could call
[1:10:06] him all you want to but they were there
[1:10:08] locked in and they knew when it's time
[1:10:11] to move it's time to move you see they
[1:10:16] realize that it's not for us wherever
[1:10:18] I'm camping out now I'm not always going
[1:10:21] to be here in this spot I'm going to be
[1:10:23] moving your mouse I realize it right now
[1:10:26] well you wear your hat now you ain't
[1:10:28] that always going to be there you're
[1:10:30] gonna be moving on you're moving on with
[1:10:32] God and God desiring us to move on I
[1:10:36] believe as the Holy Spirit spoke so
[1:10:38] expressly on Sunday not to keep going
[1:10:41] around in the same cycle but be cycle
[1:10:44] breakers by faith cycle breaking or
[1:10:51] glory being a god notice for the cloud
[1:10:54] of the Lord
[1:10:55] upon the tabernacle body and fire was on
[1:10:58] it by night in the night of all the
[1:11:00] house of Israel throughout all their
[1:11:02] journeys let me tell you something you
[1:11:05] can read this over numbers 9 I'm not
[1:11:07] even going to have time to read it but
[1:11:09] over numbers 9 you even find where God
[1:11:12] speaks of it there in numbers 9 of how
[1:11:14] that Israel was watching that cloud in
[1:11:17] that pillar of fire you see and you
[1:11:19] realize that as we go over here go to
[1:11:21] and go to numbers chapter 10 with me you
[1:11:24] look over in numbers chapter 10 after
[1:11:26] after we've been in numbers 9 you go
[1:11:29] down there in numbers 10 glory be to God
[1:11:33] in verse 11 the Bible says and it came
[1:11:37] to pass on the 20th day of the second
[1:11:40] month in the second year that the cloud
[1:11:42] was taken up from off the tabernacle the
[1:11:44] testimony and the children of Israel
[1:11:46] took their journeys out of the
[1:11:48] wilderness of sanneya and the cloud
[1:11:50] rested in the wilderness of Paran and
[1:11:52] they first took their journey according
[1:11:55] to the commandment of the Lord by the
[1:11:58] hand of Moses Moses was interpreting
[1:12:02] that to them the pillar flower is
[1:12:06] lifting up the cloud is lifting up
[1:12:09] remember it didn't matter what time of
[1:12:11] the day it was sometimes it could be a
[1:12:15] very convenient time you know it'd be a
[1:12:18] very convenient time if you're already
[1:12:19] awake last morning time 10 o'clock to
[1:12:23] pack your bags right but then what if I
[1:12:25] came to your house and woke you up at 3
[1:12:26] o'clock in the morning right you'd be
[1:12:28] lucky to try to get up but then I tell
[1:12:30] you hey pack your bags we're going right
[1:12:32] now
[1:12:32] but you see Israel knew that at any
[1:12:36] moment they could be gone I mean they
[1:12:38] could be moving they knew at any moment
[1:12:41] they had to be ready on a moment's
[1:12:44] notice
[1:12:44] Wow because where they were dwelling Old
[1:12:47] Glory bit a dog where they would
[1:12:50] selling was not their final resting
[1:12:53] place
[1:12:54] I'll tell you as a believer we have a
[1:12:56] resting place in Christ but while we are
[1:12:59] in this life this life is not my final
[1:13:02] resting place this tabernacle of
[1:13:05] humiliation is not my inheritance
[1:13:08] it's my possession but in my father's
[1:13:11] house are many mansions that is my
[1:13:16] inheritance a body that will match my
[1:13:20] soul so Moses in our opening chapter has
[1:13:29] told them turn you and let's take our
[1:13:33] journey the opening of chapter 2 the
[1:13:37] Lord spake unto Moses at this time it
[1:13:40] said take your journey northward you see
[1:13:43] Moses is rehearsing the leadership of
[1:13:46] the Holy Spirit that the people
[1:13:49] themselves here is a new generation
[1:13:52] remember here is a generation that
[1:13:54] watched the older generation die they
[1:13:59] watched those who had rejected the
[1:14:01] promise of God they watched them die
[1:14:05] they watched there were those who had
[1:14:08] seen even the 10 men that brought up the
[1:14:11] evil report died right there that day
[1:14:13] immediately for the plague before the
[1:14:15] Lord and then you see the effect of the
[1:14:18] discouragement that came in the hearts
[1:14:20] and how that the people went along with
[1:14:21] it but God will not be defeated God has
[1:14:25] made a promise and God noticed while at
[1:14:28] the same time there was a group of
[1:14:30] people that God was killing off there
[1:14:32] was another group of people God was
[1:14:34] raised enough it was a people that God
[1:14:37] himself would take across not that they
[1:14:39] were going to be better more worthy
[1:14:41] nothing like that at all
[1:14:43] it was simply our people that would come
[1:14:45] to know the keeping power of God the
[1:14:48] grace of God the privation of God and
[1:14:51] the power of God you see it would be a
[1:14:53] new generation that would not just talk
[1:14:55] about testimonies and not have any
[1:14:57] connection of that but it would be a new
[1:15:00] generation
[1:15:01] who would see the mighty acts of God and
[1:15:03] would recognize the mighty acts of God
[1:15:06] even in their generation as God would
[1:15:08] whip some Kings like Sion and Lashon and
[1:15:11] all the rest of them that would build
[1:15:13] their faith before going into the land
[1:15:15] that they would know that God is still
[1:15:17] God what was God doing Grace was
[1:15:20] providing the faith that they had need
[1:15:23] of as their right it is by grace that
[1:15:29] you are saved not by works it is not my
[1:15:35] faith your faith that God has supplied
[1:15:39] the faith to each and every one of us
[1:15:42] may God always keep us humble and if we
[1:15:45] get away from that bring us back to that
[1:15:47] place Lord to recognize that ain't us
[1:15:50] when we get to that point we need a
[1:15:52] deflation but I'm glad he seemed to
[1:15:55] deflate us whenever we need to
[1:15:56] you see Moses I want you to think of
[1:15:59] this you know sometimes you could look
[1:16:01] at a situation you know where maybe with
[1:16:03] your children or other things like this
[1:16:05] and you could look at it and say I'm
[1:16:07] tired of being where I'm at this is
[1:16:09] awful
[1:16:10] I don't want to be here no more come on
[1:16:11] grow up come on get with it that's out
[1:16:14] of frustration that don't help nobody
[1:16:16] that'll do nobody any good you don't
[1:16:18] even do you no good
[1:16:20] did you see Moses was not saying this
[1:16:24] out of frustration let's take our
[1:16:26] journey onward he was rehearsing God's
[1:16:29] leadership to them to let them know that
[1:16:32] this word that I'm speaking that it's
[1:16:35] time to go northward this is God
[1:16:37] speaking you see he wasn't even allowing
[1:16:41] their faith to rest on it's 40 years 40
[1:16:44] years of past we must go out and do it
[1:16:46] that's the same thing Moses did in the
[1:16:48] beginning
[1:16:49] Moses thought now is the time it disobey
[1:16:52] the right time it is the right time but
[1:16:55] you know what in the right time God will
[1:16:57] move it's got to be God to move and then
[1:17:01] you know it's the right time and when
[1:17:03] God moves we want to move with God so
[1:17:06] you'd better see that pillar of fire
[1:17:07] itself they were just following the fire
[1:17:10] see it was Martin Luther think of this
[1:17:12] Martin Luther
[1:17:13] followed the fire right out of the
[1:17:14] Catholic Church Wesley followed the fire
[1:17:18] right out of where the Lutheran had
[1:17:20] can't down how did the Lutheran's get
[1:17:23] camp down they didn't see the fire there
[1:17:27] were many who came around and they heard
[1:17:30] Luther's message but they really didn't
[1:17:32] feed on Luther's message they only heard
[1:17:35] it to debate it and put other people
[1:17:37] down and do this or that they weren't
[1:17:38] feeders they were here's there's a
[1:17:41] difference between being a feeder and a
[1:17:43] hear you can hear it but if you feed it
[1:17:46] you become one with it
[1:17:47] and if you become one with it you got
[1:17:49] the same nature of him who is the word
[1:17:51] inside of you and that nature whole mile
[1:17:54] we could run through the attributes so
[1:17:56] we want not to be just hearers and
[1:17:58] listeners we want to be feeders on the
[1:18:02] word you see there were those who were
[1:18:04] acquainted with a pillar fire and they
[1:18:06] moved on when God moved with that pillar
[1:18:09] fire now think about this here how that
[1:18:12] Moses himself like we said Moses he had
[1:18:15] heard about God but he never had talked
[1:18:18] to God before the Bible says in every
[1:18:21] age to this to the seven churches he
[1:18:24] that half an ear let him hear what the
[1:18:26] Spirit say it to the churches the Lord
[1:18:28] Jesus picks it up in Matthew 13 speaking
[1:18:31] of the parables that are there of the
[1:18:33] kingdom and he said he that hath an ear
[1:18:35] let him hear what the Spirit have to say
[1:18:37] the church let me tell you something you
[1:18:39] and I did not give ourselves ears to
[1:18:42] hear we did not make ourself have ears
[1:18:44] to hear that is the grace of Almighty
[1:18:48] God this word what God is doing in this
[1:18:51] generation it what a passed over our
[1:18:54] head a million miles listen friends we
[1:18:57] would have just been fellowship around
[1:18:59] miracles and around testimonies and this
[1:19:02] of what God has done would have been no
[1:19:04] more than another movement of what God
[1:19:06] did through another man of God but we
[1:19:10] recognize that this right here has a
[1:19:12] move of God it was not taking us to a
[1:19:15] station this
[1:19:16] is moving us into eternity there was
[1:19:20] that where Martin Luther he brought the
[1:19:22] church to a station just shall live by
[1:19:25] faith
[1:19:26] Wesley bought him to another station to
[1:19:29] that of sanctification it was there
[1:19:31] Pinnacle's brought him to another
[1:19:33] station of their the restoration of
[1:19:36] gives of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:38] but we're not going to another station
[1:19:41] there is not a sitting down we are going
[1:19:44] to Eternity that eighth day has moved
[1:19:48] inside our souls this is not another
[1:19:54] station we've done left the station we
[1:20:00] are seated in the astronaut and our
[1:20:04] countdown did not begin with our worldly
[1:20:06] number 10 is a worldly number they began
[1:20:11] with one two three four five six seven
[1:20:17] and we are seated in the astronaut
[1:20:19] himself in the Lord Jesus Christ buckled
[1:20:24] in sealed in baptized in fool of the
[1:20:27] quickening power of Almighty God glory
[1:20:30] be to God that same God had got ahold of
[1:20:33] Moses you see brother am says it like
[1:20:35] this he said God had never talked to him
[1:20:38] before he had just learned it out of a
[1:20:40] book
[1:20:40] so God talked to him that's the reason
[1:20:43] no one knows what he was talking about
[1:20:45] God talked to him that's how he knowed
[1:20:48] he heard it from God aren't you glad to
[1:20:51] hear from God aren't you glad you could
[1:20:55] hear from God you see I just don't hear
[1:20:58] from God when I'm listening to a tape
[1:21:00] I don't just hear to hear from God when
[1:21:01] I'm reading a book I don't just hear
[1:21:03] from God even when I'm sitting in the
[1:21:05] house of God I hear from God even when
[1:21:07] I'm outside
[1:21:09] [Applause]
[1:21:11] because you see if I can only hear God
[1:21:14] in a certain way then I might want to
[1:21:16] question am I really hearing God or is
[1:21:20] it just something I think I'm hearing
[1:21:22] because if I'm hearing God that's his
[1:21:25] voice I'm hearing I'm not you're not
[1:21:28] here my natural voice you might when you
[1:21:30] listen to the tape you can hear brother
[1:21:31] branham's voice but let me tell you
[1:21:33] something if you don't hear the voice
[1:21:35] inside of that voice you miss it you
[1:21:38] must hear the voice inside of that voice
[1:21:40] God never sent the seventh angel for his
[1:21:43] natural voice to be idolized but he said
[1:21:48] God sent His Word to bring you and I in
[1:21:51] contact with himself the pillar of fire
[1:21:54] moving down like it did upon Moses was
[1:21:57] to vindicate the Lord to the people when
[1:22:04] a man hears the voice of God personally
[1:22:07] he hears the Word of God now you can
[1:22:11] hear it he said will you saved well God
[1:22:14] God has to come meet me yes sir I could
[1:22:17] sit here listen now I could sit here and
[1:22:20] preach till I fell dead in the pulpit
[1:22:22] ten twenty thirty fifty years from now
[1:22:25] you never hear it until God reveals the
[1:22:29] word to you you know one way to know
[1:22:36] when God's revealing the word to you and
[1:22:39] makes you act like God you don't cause
[1:22:44] you to get puffed up and look down or
[1:22:46] this or that
[1:22:47] that's not revelation that's called head
[1:22:49] knowledge that's of puffing up come on
[1:22:52] friends you see real revelation does not
[1:22:55] lead you away from the body of Jesus

[1:23:12] maybe you're closer than you think you
[1:23:15] are just sit there and let God speak to
[1:23:19] you in the word

[1:23:23] living I gotta be right that's God God

[1:23:36] certainly you're gonna answer at the
[1:23:37] judgement what is it
[1:23:38] it's God speaking through his word to us
[1:23:47] the matter of fact my friend goes on to
[1:23:49] say it again
[1:23:50] he said God's got a burning bush right
[1:23:52] by every seat here tonight he's got an
[1:23:56] angel that can set your heart afire
[1:23:59] right here tonight Oh glory be to God
[1:24:06] let me say this in her let's bring this
[1:24:08] let's bring it down I want you to think
[1:24:11] of this here's 40 years they went around
[1:24:16] at kadish Moses knew by experience what
[1:24:25] it was like to be a failure for 40 years
[1:24:30] he knew what it was all he listened
[1:24:32] Moses was preaching by an experience he
[1:24:35] knew for 40 years he had been out there
[1:24:38] in the wilderness
[1:24:39] he knew that out there in the 40 years
[1:24:43] of the winters he had got so occupied on
[1:24:45] sheep racing he knew all about the
[1:24:47] different kinds of sheep he had sheep he
[1:24:50] had sheep raisin magazine coming in he
[1:24:52] was on sheep rigging raising blog posts
[1:24:55] he was on their Facebook pages he was on
[1:24:57] their Twitter accounts he was all
[1:24:59] wrapped up in sheep raising
[1:25:06] he was wrapped up did this look like the
[1:25:10] same guy who believed that this was a
[1:25:15] people of promise did this look like the
[1:25:17] same guy who at one time it started out
[1:25:20] with such zeal it didn't at all he would
[1:25:25] have been in that state and he would
[1:25:27] have continued in that state except the
[1:25:31] grace of God one day as he was out there
[1:25:37] raising sheep God said now is the time
[1:25:41] now is the time Moses thought he knew
[1:25:44] the time God said I know the time I've
[1:25:46] got the time that's in my hands
[1:25:47] and if God attracts him away from the
[1:25:53] Sheep racing he attracts him away from
[1:25:57] what he was an expert upon and God
[1:26:00] attracts him and speaks to him out of a
[1:26:03] burning bush you see it wasn't that of
[1:26:06] he s you in but it was the som that was
[1:26:09] burning inside of that bush it was
[1:26:11] Christ that same one who stood there in
[1:26:14] front of the Pharisees when they said
[1:26:16] thou are not a man more than fifty years
[1:26:18] old and you said you had seen Abraham he
[1:26:20] said before Abraham was I am he was
[1:26:25] letting them know beasts people think
[1:26:27] friends the Pharisees the Sadducees they
[1:26:31] knew the law of Moses they knew the
[1:26:34] commandments what were those
[1:26:35] commandments it was the words that the
[1:26:38] pillar of fire had come to vindicate as
[1:26:41] God's Word and that word must come forth
[1:26:44] and here were people that had the word
[1:26:48] but they couldn't recognize the pillar
[1:26:51] fire standing in their midst that had
[1:26:55] brought the word off the page
[1:26:57] Oh God help us not to be in that
[1:26:59] condition help us not to be people that
[1:27:02] are trapped in the past
[1:27:03] help us to be people Lord better moving
[1:27:06] on into the promises of God you see
[1:27:10] Moses he forgot the promise but God
[1:27:13] never forgot it
[1:27:14] Moses had lost listen the Prophet said
[1:27:18] had lost the vision of victory and
[1:27:21] freedom you might be sitting here
[1:27:24] tonight and you might have asked God for
[1:27:25] a promise over and over maybe you're
[1:27:27] sitting out here and you've asked God
[1:27:29] for the Holy Ghost over and over again
[1:27:31] maybe there's a need in your life maybe
[1:27:33] there's a need in your body let me tell
[1:27:35] you something you let God restore the
[1:27:37] vision you let God birth that into your
[1:27:40] heart tonight he's then not the pillar
[1:27:42] of fire right there to your seat say
[1:27:44] Lord Jesus I'm available to not Lord God
[1:27:46] I'm available for you to come and make
[1:27:49] yourself known you said this a Thursday
[1:27:51] night I'm telling you we're dealing with
[1:27:53] an eternal being he does not know and is
[1:27:55] not bound by the boundaries of time but
[1:27:58] he works according to his word and when
[1:28:00] the heart is made open he will come and
[1:28:03] make himself known hello
[1:28:08] that same pillar fire that'll give you a
[1:28:11] vision it'll renew within your heart
[1:28:13] where everything has been blotted out
[1:28:15] where everything looks so dark it looks
[1:28:17] so bleak
[1:28:18] it looks so impossible but the pillar of
[1:28:20] fire moving right there and moving right
[1:28:23] across your life all of a sudden that
[1:28:25] begins to be something glory
[1:28:27] hopefully that moves up in your heart
[1:28:29] I'm the Lord that healeth all my
[1:28:31] diseases
[1:28:31] I'm the Lord that giveth the Holy Ghost
[1:28:34] I am your deliverer
[1:28:36] I am your comfort I am your provider he
[1:28:39] moves right down upon your heart and
[1:28:41] begins to West by his word what should I
[1:28:46] do take that word and confess it he is
[1:28:49] my comfort he is my deliverer the Holy
[1:28:52] Ghost is mine he is my healer Wow
[1:28:58] because that is a moral word that's a
[1:29:01] word that the Spirit of God has picked
[1:29:04] up and Viet is speaking and when he
[1:29:06] moves upon your life you speak that word
[1:29:09] with authority and what's the same God
[1:29:12] come on the scene with the more and
[1:29:14] ladder together and bring that word to
[1:29:16] pass
[1:29:21] god knows what he's doing his timing is
[1:29:26] always perfect think about this and
[1:29:31] closing Elijah he went up to Mount
[1:29:37] Carmel he said I'm doing this at thy
[1:29:41] word Lord let it be known that thou art
[1:29:44] God and I'm your servant and these are
[1:29:48] your people
[1:29:49] you with me you see what that words
[1:29:51] doing it's bringing people together I
[1:29:54] hope you understand it's not a man-made
[1:29:57] bringing together this is not a man-made
[1:29:59] unity it's God uniting his people with
[1:30:02] himself if we're just united together as
[1:30:06] a bunch of people were in trouble
[1:30:08] but if we are assembled by God look out
[1:30:11] devil watch out devil well let me give
[1:30:15] the words the Prophet said in wisdom
[1:30:17] versus faith be careful devil because
[1:30:21] why it ain't us it's the power of God
[1:30:25] behind us
[1:30:28] Korah be to God it's not us that cast
[1:30:31] out Devils it's God in His people that
[1:30:34] cast out Devils it ain't us that heels a
[1:30:37] sec it's God who heals the sick it ain't
[1:30:40] us who delivers it's God who delivers it
[1:30:43] ain't us who fills it with the Holy
[1:30:44] Ghost it's God who feels with the Holy
[1:30:47] Ghost could over it be to God
[1:30:51] think about it the Lord Jesus look at
[1:30:53] this here he is on the scene they're
[1:30:56] telling him in the house of Lazarus hey
[1:30:59] there's a man down here baptizing on the
[1:31:01] name of Jordan in Jordan the mother name
[1:31:04] of John they told him that but then the
[1:31:07] Bible says there in Matthew chapter 3
[1:31:08] here when John begin to announce that
[1:31:11] there's one among you whose shoes I am
[1:31:13] not even worthy to lose the Scriptures
[1:31:16] emphatic Lee state then cometh Jesus
[1:31:20] from Galilee to Jordan unto John to be
[1:31:25] baptized of him why didn't he come to
[1:31:28] John right away
[1:31:30] it wasn't time but when it was time he
[1:31:34] was led by the Spirit of God into the
[1:31:39] water think about it here when he come a
[1:31:44] man who was at the Pool of Bethesda
[1:31:48] there were many who were sick lame at
[1:31:54] that pool they were waiting what were
[1:31:57] they waiting on they were waiting on the
[1:31:59] angel to come in trouble the water I'm
[1:32:02] gonna tell you couldn't got those people
[1:32:04] away from there if you had a trial
[1:32:07] Emmett said I wonder if somebody had
[1:32:09] their palette right here you try to pull
[1:32:11] out their rug from her you might have
[1:32:14] had a fight a couple dukes in a
[1:32:16] Christian way why because they knew I've
[1:32:20] got to be here because right here is
[1:32:24] where the angels gonna come and I've got
[1:32:26] a need in my life and I want to be here
[1:32:29] when he comes you could not move them
[1:32:32] from that spot they knew God would visit
[1:32:35] it let me tell you something as a
[1:32:37] believer a believer recognizes God will
[1:32:41] always visit according to his word that
[1:32:44] he has promised the Holy Spirit the
[1:32:48] angel of the Lord comes on the scene to
[1:32:50] stir in trouble the water
[1:32:52] that's the time to move into the water
[1:32:54] when he's troubling the water that's the
[1:32:56] time to move on and the Lord Jesus moved
[1:32:59] right down in there he skipped over this
[1:33:01] one stepped over that one excuse me here
[1:33:04] excuse me there he moved all till they
[1:33:08] got to that one why did he go to that
[1:33:10] one because that's the one that he was
[1:33:12] shown he went right through that one and
[1:33:15] may tell you something that man could
[1:33:17] have never got there to the pool
[1:33:19] he said they keep on beating me there
[1:33:21] but the same God that sent glory be to
[1:33:26] God
[1:33:26] the same God that sent the angel was the
[1:33:30] same God who was on the scene and the
[1:33:34] same God who sent the angels
[1:33:36] seven stars in his right hand is the
[1:33:39] same God who came on the scene in the
[1:33:43] end time he's the same God hello
[1:33:50] where did he visit the house of mercy
[1:33:59] Jesus
[1:34:01] Lazarus your buddy he's sick unto death
[1:34:05] and Jesus in a frantic latekka I don't
[1:34:10] know oh Jesus
[1:34:13] all bowed there two more days how could
[1:34:20] he be so calm because this is listen to
[1:34:31] me now carefully he was reserved
[1:34:35] I do nothing of myself what's he doing
[1:34:41] restoring the leadership that was in the
[1:34:45] garden in the beginning when the second
[1:34:49] Adam walked here it was a rehearsal of
[1:34:52] God's a leadership back there I'd do
[1:34:57] nothing but what I see the father doing
[1:34:59] that doeth the son likewise you think he
[1:35:04] wasn't pulled to go he was pulled to go
[1:35:06] the one whom thou lovest his gate of
[1:35:11] affection was rattling come on somebody
[1:35:14] but he possessed the date of his enemy
[1:35:20] hallelujah
[1:35:22] why did he do that for you and me but
[1:35:25] you and I can look and say greater is He
[1:35:28] that is in me Satan might try to rattle
[1:35:31] your gate of reasoning he might try to
[1:35:33] rattle your gate of imagination he might
[1:35:35] try to rattle your gate of affection he
[1:35:38] might try to rattle your memory gates
[1:35:40] but remember the seed shall possess the
[1:35:43] gates of thine enemy and when he told
[1:35:49] the disciples come on now it's time to
[1:35:52] go away classes they fought something's
[1:35:56] wrong with him but you know what it was
[1:35:59] what he said was the truth
[1:36:01] it's just they didn't understand what he
[1:36:03] was saying he had to bring up and update
[1:36:07] their understanding of what he was
[1:36:08] talking about
[1:36:12] I love him don't you
[1:36:18] Acts chapter 18 when Paul was getting
[1:36:21] ready the heat was on in Corinth they
[1:36:24] were putting it on Paul Paul was ready
[1:36:26] to run
[1:36:27] Paul was ready to move out of there but
[1:36:30] God appeared to him at night the Lord
[1:36:33] spoke to Paul in the night my vision be
[1:36:37] not afraid but speak and hold not bad
[1:36:41] peace for I am with thee and no man
[1:36:45] shall set on me to hurt thee for I have
[1:36:48] much people in the city why was that
[1:36:52] that Paul had to remain in Corinth
[1:36:54] because there was much people that were
[1:36:58] God's people they were already God's
[1:37:01] people they didn't know they were God's
[1:37:04] people Oh hallelujah and he continued
[1:37:12] there a year in six months teaching the
[1:37:15] Word of God among them who was it that
[1:37:19] kept Paul there the pillar five the
[1:37:22] angel of the Covenant the cloud by day
[1:37:26] he pillar fire by night Paul stayed
[1:37:30] there under the leading of the Holy
[1:37:32] Spirit
[1:37:34] think about this in closing now here's
[1:37:40] Paul they've loosed from Crete Paul's on
[1:37:48] his way to see Caesar
[1:37:51] they shouldn't have never loose from
[1:37:53] Crete
[1:37:57] Paul tells him you shouldn't have done
[1:38:00] this
[1:38:01] Oh God how many times there's things
[1:38:06] were the Holy Spirit we could look in
[1:38:08] our lives and say yeah I've been there
[1:38:10] there's times I've loosed from Crete and
[1:38:12] I shouldn't l always lost loose from
[1:38:14] Crete you know what it brings you to
[1:38:17] with experiences in our life you can
[1:38:19] either do one or two things you can
[1:38:20] either take experiences and say well I
[1:38:22] want to forget those things that are
[1:38:23] behind me that is a truth but don't just
[1:38:26] take them and not make them lessons in
[1:38:29] your life let the Holy Spirit teach you
[1:38:32] to be more sensitive in your life
[1:38:34] because as a believer that's one thing
[1:38:37] that we want to be is more sensitive to
[1:38:39] God we've all had our loosening from
[1:38:42] Crete experiences are you with me Omaha
[1:38:47] but how Paul stood up in the midst of
[1:38:50] him and said I exhort you to be a good
[1:38:52] cheer for there shall be no loss of any
[1:38:54] man's life among you but of the ship for
[1:38:58] there stood by me this night the angel
[1:39:01] of God sure you let him know this is not
[1:39:05] my thinking this is not my doing but the
[1:39:07] angel of God has stood by me this night
[1:39:10] who's I am and whom I serve aren't you
[1:39:14] glad that you can say that the angel of
[1:39:17] the Lord whose I am and whose servant I
[1:39:21] am saying fear not Paul thou must be
[1:39:27] brought before Caesar there's not a
[1:39:30] storm that can sink the ship you are too
[1:39:33] gonna stand before Caesar you know why
[1:39:35] he wasn't so much about Caesar it was
[1:39:38] for some elect in Caesars house
[1:39:42] hallelujah there was some Electra net
[1:39:46] were there and lo God hath given thee
[1:39:49] all to them sail with thee wherefore
[1:39:52] sirs be of good cheer for I believe God
[1:39:55] that it shall be even as it was told me
[1:39:59] howbeit we must be cast upon a certain
[1:40:06] island we've had our Islands
[1:40:11] we have Islands tests and trials but it
[1:40:16] has not stopped the Word of God there
[1:40:20] are certain predestinated pre-planned
[1:40:23] experiences of God's divine grace that
[1:40:28] has the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:40:30] I trust it becomes more real to you
[1:40:32] tonight but here is the secret for she
[1:40:35] has the mind of Christ
[1:40:37] she has thus saith the Lord no one can
[1:40:43] make her do otherwise she waits on him
[1:40:48] she looks to him that pillar fire let's
[1:40:55] tan
[1:41:00] the Rebbe says we today are God's
[1:41:03] spiritual church with a spiritual law
[1:41:07] written on the tables of our hearts LED
[1:41:09] in a spiritual form now they looked up
[1:41:14] to see where the pillar fire was the
[1:41:16] angel the Lord but we don't look today
[1:41:19] there's just something happens that we
[1:41:23] know he's there but just something
[1:41:29] happens that we know is there so this
[1:41:36] rehearsal of God's leadership Moses is
[1:41:40] speaking to him it's time to turn
[1:41:44] northward it's time to quit going around
[1:41:48] in all of these circles it's time to
[1:41:50] move over into the promised land
[1:41:55] he's rehearsing to them God's leadership
[1:41:58] but this is not my thinking this is not
[1:42:02] my frustration although it's a longing
[1:42:04] of mine to go into that land but this is
[1:42:09] thus saith the Lord it's God's Word to
[1:42:14] God's people
[1:42:15] let's turn northward let's go across
[1:42:19] that land let's go into the promises oh
[1:42:25] my tonight if you're not there he's here
[1:42:32] to take you there and if you're there
[1:42:36] he's there to take us all the rest of
[1:42:39] the way home grace has led me safe thus
[1:42:44] far and His grace will take me home
[1:42:50] let's pray Lord Jesus
[1:42:56] our confidence the Lord not in ourselves
[1:43:02] not in our abilities and Lord God it's
[1:43:10] in your sovereign grace the very power
[1:43:14] of God moving down Lord God moving in
[1:43:19] our lives it's true Lord not here in our
[1:43:26] midst
[1:43:27] you can make yourself visible at st.
[1:43:30] pillar fire you've not only done it here
[1:43:34] you've done it Lord God in many places
[1:43:38] where the believers are gathered
[1:43:40] together
[1:43:44] as our red Lord just today for your
[1:43:50] profits speaking regarding how you had
[1:43:53] your picture taken with us he said he
[1:43:59] did not come because of me
[1:44:03] it's because of you
[1:44:08] Oh Lord Jesus Lord we stand hearing a
[1:44:14] very great time a very great hour I pray
[1:44:20] Heavenly Father the Lord through the
[1:44:23] simplicity of your word tonight may our
[1:44:28] hearts just say Lord
[1:44:32] simply just leave me I want to just
[1:44:38] follow your leadership I don't have to
[1:44:43] figure it out I don't I don't have to
[1:44:45] know because that's not faith the Lord
[1:44:49] to trust you Moses when he went down
[1:44:53] there Lord as your prophet put it when
[1:44:55] he went down there among the children of
[1:44:57] Israel you never kept all of the trials
[1:45:01] and tests from him as a matter of fact
[1:45:02] he was faced with Jennie's and Jambres
[1:45:06] and every sort of unbelief so many
[1:45:10] things Lord stood against him but bran
[1:45:14] put it like this you came to bluffing
[1:45:17] came to knock at him but Moses stood
[1:45:24] because there was one standing on the
[1:45:27] inside of him he didn't know how he just
[1:45:33] knew you were going to do it that's the
[1:45:37] simplicity Lord when you reveal yourself
[1:45:40] to an individual to our lives
[1:45:44] no wonder Lord as your prophet would
[1:45:46] tell us over and over how it's so
[1:45:48] important that a person must have their
[1:45:52] personal experience meeting you on the
[1:45:56] sacred sands of God's grace and how that
[1:46:00] in our life we must pray we ought to
[1:46:04] pray for revelations Lord God
[1:46:11] we see tonight revelation it leads us
[1:46:15] Lord leads us greater humility leads us
[1:46:23] the Lord God to be more like you or God
[1:46:31] all the signs all the wonders all the
[1:46:34] miracles all the healings everything
[1:46:37] Lord that's been done right here just
