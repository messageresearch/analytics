morning and we we talk about that and that's a great thing of Victory but I I'm so glad part sometimes we don't focus on too much but I'm glad that he was willing to drink his bitter cup I'm glad that he was willing to be our sin Bearer and he went to the lowest parts of hell there was no further part remember when Abraham pursued after lot the Bible said he went to the furthest parts of Dan the prophet said that was a type of Lord Jesus bearing our sins to the lowest parts of hell however long that space of time was but one thing we know he arose amen and not just back there 2000 years ago but that reality of what he did there he's brought it back in the same reality for this hour for us it's his children amen so what a privilege it is amen what a privilege it is amen we amen just want to prepare to turn our attention the word of the Lord tonight and um I want to try to just get right into the word and the thought have up on my heart like to say welcome brother Trevor he's going to be ministering for us this weekend and uh Alberto Zion so good to have them and you know brother Trevor was uh going to be the one to open up with the youth services and we kind of postponed some things well he's in times here in January he's up here in uh for the Zion both or in a time of conference and so when he alerted me to that and I said come on over so I kind of had that back of my mind anyhow but not so much maybe with I wasn't even thinking about the youth I just thought he's here I'm going to preach him so he's in a conference there in in Sandusky you know he's one of those guys that speak in another tongue like my brother-in-law who was leading you know and they get into all that technology and get into him and him and Zion both brothers Hine you know I just I'm just saying praise the Lord if it turns on it works give me my programs and praise the Lord these are the guys behind the scenes so we appreciate that and uh brother very good to see you amen good to have you here amen so we're looking forward to that uh the youth service I heard that mentioned I'll remember that for that's on Sunday evening as well at 5 p.m and I know there's just been a lot that are really looking forward to that and the boys are getting the text and different things about that so um we're just the brothers have announced it around and we just pray for you know good weather I know every you know the thing is everybody says well it's Ohio but you know what I've been in other states and people have that same phrase I thought I really thought it was just an Ohio thing stick around you're in Ohio stick around long enough it'll change but I found out even when I was in Arizona same thing they same kind of things are spoken and said and Connecticut no matter where you're at so we just want to just trust the Lord and just look to the Lord and I believe everything looks good so we just want to amen just be in prayer for that and let's just look to the Lord here if we could let's stand tonight and I just have a a portion we'd like to look at here in the word of the Lord and before we do before we open here the word let's just go to him in a word of Prayer amen let's just each and every one let's just invite him in a personal way Heavenly Father Lord how thankful we are oh God for this moment Lord that we have Lord in your presence Lord but father we just oh God our Desiring Lord as we come with our hearts Lord with Thanksgiving Lord for Lord what you have done and what you are doing Lord the grace that Lord you have shown and that Grace that is moving and working in our lives we have so much to be thankful for Lord there's a song Lord that you inspire to a writer Lord many many years ago count your blessings and name them one by one and Lord how thankful we are Lord when we can pause and remember her as you would even instruct Israel Lord to remember Lord and we remember you Lord not just in a moment of when we are coming Lord to a communion service but Lord we are remembering you Lord and remembering your grace that has brought us safe this far Lord and regardless the Lord of every circumstance Your Grace Lord will lead us the rest of the way and we're resting in that Lord and we just invite you Lord to this evening that you would just come by our way and speak to our hearts Lord we sense your presence Lord and we just Lord and like those walking on the road of Emmaus with you Lord they invited you in Lord and Lord when they constrained you and said no Lord we want you to come in Lord we we want you to come in they did not even know it was you but it was something that they were speaking from their heart of what was already stirring them drawing in their heart and causing their heart to burn and Lord it brought about Lord a constraining that we want you Lord to turn in Lord and speak to us Lord here tonight we are Desiring oh God that Lord that you would come and commune with us Lord our hearts the Lord to be an Open Lord vessel Lord that you might speak so personally oh God Minister Lord to our hearts and our lives in every need Lord we welcome you Holy Spirit have your way in the service Lord anointing both speaker and here together Lord that your glory Lord might be made known Lord and reflected Lord and having its preeminence and working in our lives Lord we pray heal the sick that are among us the Lord those that are streaming Lord touch their bodies Lord touch lives we pray o God as your word Goes Forth Lord May the spirit of God just cause our bodies to obey that confession that rises in our hearts Lord we love you and thank you now father in Jesus precious name amen amen let's look in Job chapter 21. and we'll look at verse 17. foreign and as I told you here just even though I think a few weeks ago I had no intentions of of moving or this chapter was just going to make a reference to at a point of what job where a conclusion was being drawn but the Lord seen fit otherwise so we just want to obey him in verse 17 of this chapter now this whole chapter remember what job is answering is all there's been the accusations throughout that's it's just been dropped all the way but then even the chapter preceding this in chapter 20. where it was just an unloading of speaking of how that these things that were the wicked that all of a sudden their prosperity and all these things it just it just fleeth like that and job would God would see fit because remember job is a prophet he may not have the inspiration for what he is facing right now but he is still speaking by inspiration that he has received to bring discernment even in his generation so the message if you can see this that the message job and his message are not two separate things he and his message are one and it's been it's bringing a discernment even from what job and so job is laying this out it's a contrast to what they are saying and so we want to look at that in verse 17 just moving into that a little further tonight how oft is the candle of the wicked put out and how oft cometh their destruction upon them God distributeth sorrows and anger so in other words how that things are able what job is saying how they're able to linger how things go on the wicked continue to prosper it goes on but you remember the wills of Prophecy are sure it turned slow but it sure is that right and the Bible is very clear whatsoever a man soweth he reapeth right amen so notice verse 18 they are as stubborn now he's talking about the wicked they are as stubble before the wind and as chaff that the storm carryth away and so when look verse 19 and God layeth up his iniquity for his children he rewardeth him and he shall know it or aren't you thankful that your iniquity is not laid up for you aren't you grateful that your iniquity it's already been taken care of and you've recognized that and you've accepted that amen aren't you grateful your sins are not you're not something you're coming to but there's things that's already behind you amen I'm thankful for that verse 20 his eyes shall see his destruction and he shall drink of the Wrath of the almighty for what pleasure hath he in his house after him when the number of his months is cut off in the midst shall any teach God knowledge seeing he judgeth those that are high one dieth in his full strength being holy at ease and quiet that's quite a contrast quite a contrast his breasts are full of milk this speaks of this man's life as far as with the Natural Things is natural life he's full of nourishment he's nourished his life is full of nourishment and another dieth in the bitterness of his soul and never eateth with pleasure and they shall lie down alike in the dust and the worms shall cover them amen how many know that that death don't have any respect whether it's rich or poor death don't take into account how much a person has or doesn't have as a matter of fact when you read on in the Book of Job the Bible says that in hell it's naked there's no clothing there's nothing that is there there's everything that people have put their stock in in his life there is nothing there but oh my for the righteous for the believer I'm not helpless not prepared for me it wasn't prepared for you it was made for the devil and his angels a matter of fact it wasn't made for human beings right and and God even in the midst of his grace will provide us red lights roadblocks everything else to try to stop a person from going that direction amen I want to really I want to just heed to that amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I just want to just speak on just a little question here tonight out of this and we'll see how far we get and I want to just really um to think about how that there are preparations that are that are in place that's been in place and they're really quite um different it's a contrast of what's going on this world is preparing for judgment and the bride is preparing for rapture there's a preparation going on and so the question that we want to be able to take in and to really reflect upon is what are you preparing for what are you preparing for you see the Bible tells us here that when we we recognize that when the reality strikes our hearts that this life itself has never really been about this life this life is not about this life it's about the next life it's all it's preparation this is why that when you look at the scriptures in Hebrews 11 the Bible says by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear with the reverence he prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith now God provided all that was needed but God didn't go out and harvest the trees for Noah God didn't cut him down for Noah but Noah had to go and he moved upon that and you know to to take and what was needed in order to bring about what God was calling for you know when you are I look at it in our life of what God is calling Our Lives to and when the God speaks to a heart and is drawing our hearts to him to walk with him you know God is not asking us as though that we already had the necessary material but God is letting you know that what he's calling you and I too he has already provided so it's not something that we have to do or to work ourselves into but it is to accept what God has already provided and to think about how that noise he labored he worked he toiled he prayed he he continued uh just you know giving himself to the Lord all for this purpose it was a preparation for that of the Ark for the saving of his household so in the midst of it now this is why withdrawing from here when we look at job's friends job's friends were looking at and the only way that they could understand things taking place remember brother Brown tells us that they only knew job theologically or at God theologically they did not know God by Revelation so the only way that they could interpret that God was just was that job was a secret Sinner and you'll notice as we said everything that they focused on was everything in this realm that could be seen they were not focused on what was the most important and that was a relationship with God and a fellowship with God they didn't focus on that and yet that that was the very harsh desire here of job job was expressing all throughout and he continues what job is longing for job's not saying I want my cattle back Joe missed all of these things family and on and on but job said what I desire is there is one that could put his hand on God and me a life oh that I could come before his seat that I could hear his voice once again what was job's focus it was not upon those things down here that had been removed but his Focus was what was the most important thing is my fellowship with God and that's still the most important it's always been the most important to every believer that's lived upon the face of the Earth as a matter of fact it has been that that has caused lives to be classified as oddballs because of the decisions that they would make in life they would make decisions in life not based upon the natural means but their decisions would be based upon the spiritual realm because one thing a Believer can rest in surely Spirit sure is mine things tests can come troubles but there's one confidence that a Believer has that when I am following in the will of God God will take care of everything that is going on around me he's a Waymaker so if I'll follow him I trust him he will open the way for me Noah pounded away in a preparation he labored for this now I want to just transition into this moment here in second Peter chapter 3 that speaks even of the moment that we are living in the Bible would say beloved I write unto you that in both which I would stir up your pure Minds by the way of remembrance that you would be mindful of The Words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the Commandment of us the Apostles of the Lord and Savior knowing this verse that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust is that right now let me just kind of just pick that up he would come as scoffers and brother Bram goes into that here but let me just continue to read the scripture he says and saying this is what the scoffers what would come forth from out of their lives where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation now you cannot you can talk or hear different people saying different things where people are even in a place to recognize in one way something's going on or we're at where I've been we're in a serious moment they can see conditions in the world and you and I are looking at it as though it's not just a natural progression this is the hand of almighty God it is because we're lives according to prophecy have rejected the spirit of God they have turned him down that's the reason this nation in itself it had its opportunity and in 1956 it turned down and rejected the Holy Ghost and that's why we see that as it has propagated and where it is even right now of the ungodliness and all that is right here even among us we see the effects of that and notice where is the promise of his coming so it's putting a question Upon This Promise the Bible says for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that was then being overflowed with water perish in other words Judgment of what was to come was all around them it was all around them but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and Perdition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day and the Lord is not slack concerning his promise has some men count slackness but his long-suffering to us word I'm glad about that not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance now God's not going to lose one of his elect when we stand there that day there will not be one wedding robe if we can use the analogy there will not be one wedding rope or one theophany there and God said they just didn't make it no God has already prepared just as he prepared the ark Noah preached 120 years but God when he gave the dimensions of that Ark he knew the only ones that would actually heed and listen would be that of Noah and his family so God when he sends his word let me tell you something God has an expectation God does not send his word with a hope so or you know there might be somebody no his word is part of his predestinated Redemptive plan and God is moving down to bring a rescue for his children glory be to God but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night now back there in verse 9 there'll be there'll be lives thank God for the mercy of God that are given an opportunity to come to Salvation is that right but remember the bride itself is the only ones elected for the rapture is that right there'll be many others of names that were the grace of God spilled over from the Lamb's Book of Life onto the book of life that received salvation is that right brother Brandon said where they were not trusting in their church but they were trusting in Jesus Christ for their salvation that's why brother Brandon said a Catholic man he said if he's trusting in the church he's lost but if he's trusting in Jesus Christ he's saved is that right now you know there's a further call for the bride and listen you're not going to keep the bride back there the bride's not going to be one that becomes complacent and says well you know what praise God I'm saved that's all it is because even those that are in that place there's no desire for further truth but they are walking in the light that God is open to them but for the bride brother there's something that you and I cannot even explain what he is it's a deep that's calling to the Deep there is more light to be revealed and that's why we can't even settle can I bring it down here we can't even settle for a lifestyle just being in a message Church there is something that draws us to an expression I've got to have more of him glory be to God but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with the great noise and the element shall melt with a fervent heat the Earth also in the worst therein shall be burned up so think about in The Hour That here we are just very briefly here for these scriptures it's a Time of preparation and God has seen to it in this this is the hour We're Not Looking for the rapture we have entered the Rapture cycle is that right we have entered into that into that place with God God himself Desiring no you and I could not make ourselves Rapture Worthy we couldn't do that even with all of the knowledge that was out there we could not make ourselves Rapture worthy but you and I will ordained for this so because of that God is responsible to himself remember he swore by himself it is God himself that is committed to his Word of Promise to prepare a way for you and I as a matter of fact God knew that you and I would desire the Holy Ghost he knew there would be a desire in our hearts for him a desire for Rapture a desire for escape God knew that and God prepared that for you and I that's why this meeting here tonight is not a by chance it's not something that you know God didn't know about God knew all about it and God knew even each and every one of us where we would be positioned that God knew what we would need and he made a preparation for us and so in this hour the unfolding of the Rapture has it's been unfolded in this hour where the Lord himself shall descend and he has in the shout the voice and the Trump and we understand he's doing all three as he's descending it's unfolding in the life of the believer that shout is the living bread of life it's his own life that then that life becoming wrapped up and there hemorphied in the life of the Bride then it is that same life that same voice that moves throughout the body of Jesus Christ and will literally raise the dead in Christ remember Jesus never ever when he raised he never looked back and said hey the rest of you come on but it was the Fulfillment of Prophecy in his life that announced to them the move is on it's time to move upward it's time to go that's why it's not what we're saying here it's what's being said here that has the greatest impact glory be to God and this is why in the hour that we're living in whole how we thank God for such Grace that has come our way we did not deserve it it is light that has come to our way God promised in the evening light in the evening time there would be light he promised he would open up the pathway the light for you and I and show us and God in His Grace has stood true and he will stand true to the Fulfillment of every promise the Bible said there'd be scoffers as I read to you here in the last days and brother Branham when you notice he'll take that in the message the Rapture and brother Brad will speak of how that those scoffers that they would arise and the whole objective with the scoffers and he'll he'll talk about how that Moses went down into Egypt and he said here he went down to lead out a group of people with only a stick in his hand but remember what that stick was it was the rod of judgment and within that stick that stick remember brother Ram tell us he said if they could have ever got that stick out of Moses hand he'd have been whipped but what that stick was a type of it was a type of the deity that's in the name of Jesus Christ oh my when when that was standing there there was a Divine Vindication what Moses was saying remember when he was there he said how am I going to get these people to believe me how will they know how that'd be a logical question but you see it's not a natural working on a natural you and I are not here because well this all makes sense to me this all lines up there'll be other things that will come that might make more sense we are not here tonight because we are perfect and good in our reasonings and our ability some of us might have more of an intellectual draw than others but we are not here because it makes sense we are here because of divine revelation even the things that we believe and we preach are beyond our own understanding but it's by revelation are you with me you say brother Sammy what are you saying I'm saying we're not a bunch of apologetics that's what I'm saying amen we are inspired Holy Ghost Field believe us amen that God himself has inspired and met we have met him face to face so as we look at this here we recognize the scoffers they would rise and brother Brown would tell us of how that the scoffers and what they would do and remember how when Moses threw the stick down he uses this example that Janice and Jamboree stood through their sticks down as well and when their sticks they were they they turned to serpents as well but it was Moses stick that consumed them now think of it Pharaoh himself never focused upon that but when he saw that miraculous being done he looked at that as though it's a Vindication and it hardened him against God's promise in that hour that's why brother Brown could say he said you can take he said a person and they're wearing shorts and bobbing their hair and on and on he said and maybe they can speak in tongues and pray for the sick and this and that and he said you try to tell him that their life is not right with the word of God he said and they'll tell you real quick the Holy Ghost falls on me but for the Bride of Jesus Christ there's only one Vindication and that's a life that the word itself will interpret there's only one Vindication amen is that right from the Rapture you know all of that brother said all those impersonations are kinds of things to upset the people and just say it very simply there's not another message to come we have received the end time message we have received the necessary preparation from God that you and I can receive of that and be made ready in the coming of the Lord now I want you to look here at Psalms 37. let's look here at this just for a little bit and thinking of how that with job's friends and because we know that I want you to understand this this whole our whole journey here brother Abraham says that and who is this from Melchizedek we we bypassed our theophany and came down here to be tested and tried and tempted and when that's over then we go back home in the Hebrew series he places it like they do at the shipyards over in New Jersey when they before they ever put out a vessel on the sea it must go through a testing or Proving Grounds and this whole life is The Proving Grounds let me just say God is not if I can say it this way that you don't misunderstand me or taking life God is not watching our life like somebody watching a a play or a drama and wondering what the next scene is going to hold God is not sitting there and thinking oh my goodness you mean this person went this way or this or man this one's that nothing surprises God you know when job was standing God wasn't surprised God knew what was in him Journey how did he know what was in him because God knows himself and God's confidence was in himself that job he's a chip off the old block that's where his confidence was at so God is not looking at your eye God is not giving us a test or a trial or permitting things to come our way in order to try to get us to fail God is not doing it that way but every test and every trial is for the molding and the shaping of our life right here within this Earth the actual shaping of our character right now so God's not God's not worried he's he knows exactly what he's doing Psalms 37 1 . notice how David would write of this fret not thyself because of evil doers neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity now just allow the Holy Spirit to just bring it right down and apply it right home in our life for they shall soon be cut down like the grass and wither as the green herb so right now it might be green this might looking good it doesn't matter what you interpret this in boss or anything else or anything within this life it looks like my the world except mine look at this this person and you know they're not even serving God mine look at them advancing to the real believer that's never ever really a real focus in our life because once as a Believer you've met God nothing else matters at all there's only one thing that you have and that's a desire to please the Lord now notice within this Psalm 1714 from men which are thy hand O Lord from Men of the world which have their portion in this life whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure they are full of children and leave the rest of their substance to their babies so they have their portion in this life Hey listen this is the Millennium for many people but this is not the Millennium for me and I'm not even talking about false teachers I'm talking about for how the world this is their millennium this is they they're hey they're enjoying themselves there I mean you know here's Thursday night there's many of them already their weekend has started tonight won't you say we start our weekend tonight you're going to repeat it this is what they're look they're they're living for they go through they make it through Monday they make it through Tuesday they make it through Wednesday they persevere through Thursday because they know here's Thursday night and Thursday night we'll be able to help them get through Friday morning through the donut line through the coffee line everything else because of what the weekend holds for them oh I'm glad as a Believer we are not caught up in those things I'm glad that we have found our source of satisfaction and rest I'm glad we're not looking for the next thing to come along and the next ball team to rise up and the next one is I'm glad that that is not my focus I'm thankful that there is a more sure place and a place of real rest and refreshment to where even when we can lay our head on the pillow at night we've got joy amen we've got rest we've got Thanksgiving in our hearts amen notice now job would speak of these things here in previous chapters regarding this of the wicked prospering in job 9 24 the Earth is given into the hand of the wicked notice it doesn't belong to them but it is given into their hand see how job misunderstanding this Revelation he knew that the Earth itself it belongs to God the Earth itself but it has been given into the hands of wicked oh my but whoever gave it whoever wherever it belongs to it's got to come back to he covers the faces of the judges thereof if not where if not where and who is he job 12 6 the Tabernacles of robbers prosper and they that Pro provoked God are secure wow remember there's so many places here in the scripture there at ease they even rest upon themselves in this previous chapter of job 21 and they make the statement of why should i serve him I've got a good why do I need to serve God I ain't poor I ain't broke I ain't troubled well I don't serve you because I'm poor I didn't serve him because I'm troubled I served him because I loved him and the reason I love him because he first loved me it had to let me get to a place in my life all those sitting around in a message Church acquainted with it but God had to allow me to get to a place in my life till I recognize this I needed him not just knowledge of quotes that I could finish but I needed him hmm and God knows how to let us get to those places to recognize that the message is not about doctrines the message is not about I know this and the message is Christ revealed to you and I and in US Lord be to God that's the whole purpose notice into whose hand the Tabernacles of robbers prosper and they that provoke God are secure into whose hand God bringeth abundantly now see a person could look at that and think Lord have mercy what blessings my look at man alive look they're prospering look at what but be careful what you're looking at are you with me remember brother Brown told us there's as many Penny ears as there is millionaires you know what a penny area and hope and acting thinking like they're a millionaire and spending like they are when they're pennies let's just be Penny ears but I mean real ones amen we're not interested in the riches of this world because it corrupts is that right but notice into whose hand God bringeth abundantly verse verse 13 of job 21 as I refer to this moments ago they spend their days in wealth their life is wrapped up in wealth and in a moment go down to the Grave that first part of that scripture Satan is a bigger sister in that right there wow you know not only did it have it before with all the television ads and everything else but all the Billboards that are out there but now it just goes right across the phone screen it's got the latest and greatest and and the next thing in line and what's it do it's keeping the people chasing after the next day oh Lord this is the next Style oh Lord this is the next town you know what's happening being led right to judgment everything LED right to judgment keeping everything before him because what their focus is on the wrong thing but you know James said this life itself it's just a vapor it really is it's just a season I don't know we could probably testify this going around the room sometimes it is so hard for me to capture when I think of that the age I'm only 47 I know I don't look anywhere near it look a whole lot younger but it's hard for me to capture that when I look at certain pictures of my dad and myself that I'm the age now that he was as a matter of fact a couple years older it's hard for me my mind be honest with it's hard for my mind to wrap that around because you don't want to know why I look at everybody else as being older than me it's hard it's you know you look at you look at things like that but you realize you know what this life is but a vapor I mean to me you talk to me I could you know you you know as you can get around people you went to high school with and you talk about like things or just yesterday and you know what here it's been 30 years ago for some of you maybe a lot longer than that and you know what and I remember seeing people that come back that have been out for 30 years and they were talking about the Glory Days in their football and you thought wow these people are old Lord have mercy it's funny how we think about things right the youthful mind always looks at it like I've got all the time in the world or I've got all this out there but when you begin to look back you realize wait a minute where did these last years go where did they go right it's just but a vapor now notice when we consider this here even in the midst of Psalms 37 let's go on in verse 3. now watch this admonition this is what I want us to look at the admonition to direct and focus our lives into because this is what job remember this is what job has been about throughout his life at his whole life matter of fact job's testimony even in Job 31 is that God knows I've never even said regarding gold and worshiped it or delighted in it I've never done that whatsoever I've trusted him job had that testimony so job knew what he was speaking of here so here our trust and our focus is to be in him so the Bible says in Psalms 37 3 trust in the Lord and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily Thou shalt be fed Delight thyself also in the Lord and he shall give Thee the desires of thine heart so there's no way that we can really Delight ourselves in the Lord and our desires not be about him right there's just no way because when he comes moves into our life Everything Changes even our request when God is beginning to even deal with our life our request and the things begin to fade from around us and our requests begin to be upon him and what he is speaking to us about right even starts with forgiveness repentance on and on and on so notice in verse 5 commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass yeah I'll say the same thing help me Lord because committed means you know what to put it on to roll away to to place into his hands and sometimes you know that's an easy word but sometimes that's a hard thing for us to do even as Believers it's a hard thing to do we're saying Lord I want to commit it and it isn't like that we're laying on a pillow and God's saying here you have it no Lord I wanted you to have it no God will never throw it back at us but the hardest thing is for us to commit it to him and yet brother Brown would tell us that is one of the most powerful weapons that God has given us as the Church of the Living God to commit is when we come to that place it's just Lord just of a faith and I trust you and you know I've said this many times right here in prayer on phone and counsel and everywhere else I would be honest now I'm telling you this because of my experience I would be honest enough to say Lord I'm maybe not there right now but I ain't gonna pack this around many longer I'm asking that you'll help me to come into that place of committing this into your hands now remember you can't Tinker with it and commit it at the same time because if you're tinkering with it it's still on your work desk you hadn't put it on God's work desk you know they have a like like the manhole my my you know the guy that would be like the the master he would bring in the apprentice and The Apprentice was learning to trade but the one who would be here at the desk he's the one who knew all about the trade he's the one that could teach the apprentice and bring him along in in that whole time and you know many times we're over here trying to get God God I'm asking you to solve this problem Lord I Lord I need you to do this and God said you still got it on an apprentice desk you need to bring it over to the Master's desk that's a committal yeah committal is is where our hands are off of it now this is part of focus and admonition in our lives because there's things that you know we come face to face with that there is no way that we're going to be able to resolve it there's things in the workplace and on and on family and everything else there's no way in the world we can spend all of our strength all of everything and yet when it all comes down to it all we've done is tired ourselves anybody ever been there yeah I've been there and he shall now notice this is what he'll do if we commit our way unto the Lord he will bring forth thy righteousness as the light and that judgment as the Noonday so it isn't something that's just like this in our life but that's what we want right but it's things that God who as we commit our ways unto the Lord and you know when you committed one of the sure signs when you've committed it I've committed it we're resting it doesn't matter whatever comes up it's a line vanity uh it's in God's hands I don't accept nothing that's a sign of a committal it's a rest now you might have everything else that'll try to speak against it what's Satan trying to do draw you out what was Satan trying to do to job draw him out that's what he was trying to do now notice verse seven I want you to hone in on this part of it here because Satan's desire is always to try to get us entangled with the Affairs of this life the part of that is that we are looking at things that we see we taste we feel on and on and on things that are right out here around us and we are prone to want to try to solve it within the first two realms we're prone that's a part of the weakness in our lives and you might say well but the same of that that's not necessarily no it is a weakness it's a weakness in our life that we are prone to that part of it to try to solve to try to help to try to help God out in some way but notice it's Satan's desire is to always get us entangled verse 7 rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way because of the man who bringeth Wicked devices to pass notice how he's talking about our focus and where we're to be focused in on cease from anger you know what that tells me these situations we can be angered we could be frustrated oh Lord Brother Sammy you're talking about Believers I know I am that's who I'm preaching to tonight that's who David's writing to cease from anger and forsake Wrath fret not by self in any wise to do evil for evil doers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the Lord they shall inherit the earth for yet a little while and the wicked shall not be yea they Thou shalt diligently consider his place and it shall not be notice where the Wicked the evil doers and how that their lives would Prosper even to things Within These verses that would literally vex the righteous or it would move and the righteous could look on but notice what David is admonishing by the spirit of God do in world ly even of things that you could seemingly seem justified is that right sometimes the greatest traps remember are the things that are so unnoticeable like oh my in the workplace I'm going to lead a crusade against all of the bosses and I'm gonna you know they've done this and they've done that in my bed there are some things that might need to be uncovered but sometimes that can become the greatest detriment and trap because the enemy is moving upon us and we get into this philanthropist thinking I hope I said the word right we get into this thinking right I'm just gonna you know I'm just gonna help everybody and what happens is it heats up our meditation it eats up our mind it eats up our prayer time it eats up our reading time you might have did all sorts of things for the company but where has your life been with God in the meantime this is why he said fret not because there's going to be times that we could become very fretful about things well that ain't Fair they're doing this and and this but just just just just just look to the Lord wait patiently on the Lord notice verse 11. but the meek Oh Glory shall inherit the earth and shall Delight themselves in the abundance of Peace the meek those who give place the Bible says give place to Wrath the meek shall inherit those who give place in the powerful the Bible says Moses was the meekest man in the earth and yet make us Moses also had a temper but you know what he was the meekest man in the earth because Meek means to give place he gave place to almighty God he gave place to the revealed word of God and it worked in his life it moved in his life it brought him into position in his life the meat shall inherit the earth give place to the word of God and the word of God working in your life will give you strength over that which could cause fret is that right notice the wicked I know I'm speaking tonight and there we could just pause between every scripture and every testimony and say hell you go ahead and give a testimony we give testimonies after every one of these scriptures tonight the wicked plotteth against the just and gnasheth upon him with his teeth the Lord shall laugh at him for he seeth that his day is coming so you mean God doesn't stop his plots you mean God just doesn't lean right in upon his children and say oh the wicked is plodding against you God reveals what's necessary to be revealed but there's other plots that can be made but just remember Esther anything that Haman makes as a plot God still has his mind on you amen God has not forgot about you notice the wicked have drawn out the sword they have bent their bow to cast down the poor and the needy and to say such as be upright of conversation and their sword shall enter into their own heart and their bows shall be broken I'd say it in this way we don't want there's a lot of things that we could enter into there's things you can enter into in family there's things you can enter into in the workplace there's things you can enter into all around us it's spirit let me tell you something there's a spirit of destruction that's all around us it's a spirit that's out to destroy this world there's a spirit of this world and remember just as much we're looking in the age of the Rapture and the Rapture that's that word is not even mentioned in the scripture but it's that mentioned caught up we shall be caught up there's a lot of things we can get caught up with you get caught up with family you get caught up with jobs you get caught up well what are you preparing for because whatever you're caught up in is what you're preparing for is that right I mean you know how it is you can stand around in the workplace there's plenty of critics there's people everywhere that they you know they can tell the boss how to do it better and you know what I I and there's some times where there's things that could be legitimately right there's been boots on the ground that have walked know the whole thing before all these things are given out that's true but how many times I wonder is it testing you or I to see what our attitude is going to be at and we fret ourselves and you know it's like the jump rope that's going around and here we are you know they're hey Sam you ready to jump in okay and here we are in a one and a and a two Anna who I don't know all those Rhymes and things like that and here we do we jump right into criticizing is that right we Jump Right In man and before you know it oh Lord I've entered right into this I've been and you know what as a believer oh there's convictional sent right in on your life amen there's a commitment wait a minute here what am I doing entering into this what am I doing come on under this listen friends that can be even bitterness within a family Spirits are real they're meant to be discerned and withstood say God help me I don't want to get caught up in those things you know brother random made a statement I can show you and I minister to you those different places in the message where brother man will say I have purpose in my heart never to have a negative thought to blast it out then you find him a few years later making the same statement again you know why because it's aware of that there is a continual cleansing and washing of Water by the word God didn't have to allow the prophet to put that to put that before us but one thing about it brother Ram didn't hide anything from you and I you know why that's an example for you and I to follow in our life that sometimes there's going to be sticky situations there's going to be things that we get caught up in and God in his grace will move down and speak to our heart and we say whoa what was I caught up in what was I even thinking about what is it God's grace to our lives [Applause] oh my notice this a little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many Wicked for the harms of the wicked shall be broken but the Lord upholdeth the righteous these are our promises now the Lord knoweth the days of the upright and their inheritance shall be forever they shall not be ashamed in the evil time and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied but the wicked Shall Perish and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs they shall consume and into the smoke shall they consume away now you see God is always trying to narrow this down here God has always said his word to be the object of our Focus not man's ideas God called us out of that God called us by his grace you know look man was looking at the word of God but they had all sorts of interpretations and they had man's ideas man's interpretations God brought us out of that and I I just stand firm on this I'm not going back into that I'm not going back into anybody who well I'm going to correct brother brownham and I'm going to tell you about brother Brown's opinions sorry I don't have no time for that stuff because God God never called me to look down on the message God called me to get under it God called me to look up not down on it God called me to look up because that is Jehovah the eagle sweeping through because here's what it all comes down to at the end of the day it must say the same thing is that right plain and simple so when we look at this God has always set his word to be the object of our focus and then through that Focus as as a life would be drawn away an attraction would take place think of Moses think of Abraham On and On Through the scriptures through that Focus then there would come forth a relationship because it would not be that of a letter and a man but it would be God himself who is the word and there would become a relationship there it would be a fellowship and through that relationship and fellowship there would be a strengthening that the man receives along with leadership to navigate through not only plenteous and precious times but tumultuous times as well because he's just not God when everything's going right he's just not God when we understand everything simple song that was sung years and years ago he's not just God of the mountains he's God in the valleys that's that's where he likes to prove himself so the focus itself has always been upon him and he is the word how many know that prophets themselves are reflectors meant to reflect that Believers are to be reflectors too to reflect that life for that life to be captured and that same light and as a reflector it doesn't diminish the light but it's the same the light that would shine within the same Brilliance that would go forth and I want you to think of this in this focusing here Abraham I like how Brother Band put it in the message look and Look Away to Jesus and brother Rand will talk about Abraham's life because Abraham had had some ups and downs he had a lot of testing a lot of Trials he sometimes the tests and trials that Abraham had one of them was just waiting 25 years that was just one of them okay but so there was many things you know the other thing he had there was misunderstandings of the promise brother Brown said he focused out the misunderstandings Satan could have just no doubt stood there and said you got it wrong that time buddy but you know what he had to do Focus that out well how do you focus something out there's I can't focus out brother just way if I'm looking at him the only way I can focus him out is I'm going to have something else that I'm focused on and when I'm focused on then that gets focused out I can still see when I look at brother Trevor I can see him in my peripheral but I'm not focused on him but whoever I'm focused on I'm going to lock in and I'm going to walk towards him and the closer I get the more as I'm walking towards brother Trevor he's no longer in my peripheral any longer oh my can't you see it even or what we're focusing on we're looking sometimes at the problem instead of looking at The God Who said I am your deliverer I'm your Waymaker and keep walking towards him the test or the trial is not a time to Desert him it's not a time to leave him it's not a time to stand and say master I The Apprentice can handle this situation no but as an apprentice say you know what this is bigger bigger bigger than me this is more than what I can handle so Lord I'm going to place myself on your desk because really the real problem is not the problem it's us and so we can say Lord I put myself on the altar I put myself on the desk oh my I'd like to go on but I'm going to stop right here Abraham focused out and he focused in on the promise of almighty God this is what job job's having to do right now he's having to focus out all the distractions all the accusations everything all around him and job is standing on what God has spoke to him and what he knows to be the truth and it's a part of his life so what job job is as it mentions here in the scripture there's a preparation that's underhand there's a preparation that's that's going on even before us here even tonight and I want to walk in that preparation I want to walk in and I want the word to come and to shape me to cut cut away those things that are not pleasing to him I want I desire his grace for the trials that he sees in His Infinite Wisdom that he's permitted for my life Lord give me Grace to go through because I sure can't make it on my own I need your grace and you know the beautiful thing about it is he never forsakes us he never pulls back from us as a matter of fact through every test and every trial is if I could have kept on reading here tonight God said never said he'd take away the trials but God said when the trouble does come I'll be the strength of my people I'll be their strength I'll strengthen them I'll keep them I'll make a way for them oh my God let us not fret ourselves in that of the wicked and the wickedness but let us Delight ourselves in the Lord so you're either going to fret in the things of the world or Delight in the things of God we've got a choice well brother Sammy you don't know my situation you don't know everything that's going around I don't have much to be delighted in really where did God bring you from what did God do in your life how did God speak to your life and God has moved upon your life and drawn you will not worship him for just of where he is right now we're worshiping him for who he is delighting myself in the Lord you're talking about Heap and coals of fire on the enemy's head it may not be like you're running around and you know dancing around but there's a delight within your life and it says in the midst of it all I can be negative I could be bitter I could be exasperating in my life but instead I choose to Delight myself in the Lord and let me tell you something what you feed on you will become if you dwell on the negative well I don't watch no evil this or I don't but if you feed on negative negative thoughts negative things you're entering right into that spirit and you know what it's coming right out it's affecting your life it's affecting all the rest around you what are you saying Brothers don't enter into that spirit get into the spirit of the word the same what do you mean by in the spirit of the word when's the last time you just got a loan away from God oh but Brother Sam you don't know my situation if I could really get this out of the way I could really pray no no this is the time to pray this is the time to pray it's a time to put on the message I don't know if I can get anything out of it no God knows what you got need of put on the word of God and allow an atmosphere to be created and I'll tell you you'll find things that God is going right down your alley on things that you have need of in your life and of things you're able to say at that moment Lord help me Lord this is just what I have need of it's pressing Beyond pressing beyond the things that we see around us we're children of Abraham and may God help us to focus out all the distractions and focus in on the promise focus on him turn Our Eyes Upon Jesus and look full in his wonderful Faith let's Stand Together musicians would come let's just start we'll just stop there tonight oh help us Lord amen what we're preparing for there's a preparation that we're in in our lives there's a preparation that's going on right now amen oh God help us to enter in to that preparation amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord a question that you would place before us Lord out of these scriptures what are we preparing for Lord one thing that we can always just be able to look at our lives and where everything is that even right now Lord God we can we can even see that God even by the decisions and by things the Lord that right around us Lord it'll tell Lord what we're preparing for I pray God those in the sound of my voice those that are Lord whether here or the internet Lord May the hearts Lord as David said I thought on my ways and I turned my footsteps God I pray tonight Lord May Lord as we Ponder there's one thing for sure Lord we don't want to miss it Lord and it's not just about missing that moment but it's also about Lord God this life right here because it's true none of us want to miss that Lord there's nothing of this Earth that's worth it nothing Lord but God I pray help us help us Lord in the midst of it Lord that our lives Lord when Lord things can come Lord around us like David mentioned and spoke of Lord things that could pull and draw Upon Our emotions Lord but help us Lord I pray help us Lord God that we would focus out those things Lord and focus in on you we know Lord there's only one thing Lord to be able to focus it out we first have to focus in on you and through focusing on you everything else around Lord goes into the peripheral it's blurred it becomes the Lord not the focus of what we're looking at and what we're being drawn to Lord we realize here we're standing in this moment Lord the change of the body is upon us the Rapture we're living in this generation In This Moment Lord we're living in this time that which all have looked and waited for Lord how that Lord that live long for this time and yet here we are standing Lord in this moment God me every heart I pray be ready to go if they're not may they receive the grace Lord that God to be made ready Lord to go may you move Lord I pray Lord as you're just moving Lord God by your spirit Lord Lord any life or God any Heart Lord that's become distracted Lord which Lord with things of this earth and the cares of it Lord sometimes with things lord it's just not even sinful but can become distracting Lord if we allow it to Lord help us Lord in the simplest of way o God that everything like Abraham Abraham's focusing in on the promise of God Abraham walked in his life the closer Lord is he just drawn closer and closer to you decisions that would be made in his life would be made based on the promise your Prophet told us that Lord when it came to the separation of lot the whole basis of that decision was certainly not based on Abraham's feelings because your Prophet told us he looked in the human side of Abraham and said that bothered him real bad that he had to separate from lot it hurt him he loved lot but it was the promise that Abraham held that caused him to make the decision to separate Lord I believe father all through here Lord many times we can look at Lord where we've had to separate from Friends family sometimes Lord even things around us right now co-workers and everything else and Lord to separate sometimes it's things Lord that we even have to separate from and not come under the influence of those other things Lord sometimes Lord even the people Lord that are under the influence they don't mean bad but Lord God sometimes the Lord those Spirits Lord and the way that it can just start to work Lord every one of us know it Lord you get around the fire you're going to smell like smoke you're going to smell you've been like a round of Fire sometimes the Lord God as it comes in the workplace family on and on you get around criticism for you know it you'll start criticizing everybody else you get underneath where there's bitterness it'll affect your life oh God help us Lord May there be Lord Jesus May our lives and our hearts say Lord I don't want to be caught up in that Lord I want to be caught up in you Lord God forgive me Lord if I if we've turned that way Lord any heart here tonight I believe there's Grace sufficient right here tonight Lord God you're not here shaming us you're here to direct us Lord the Lord to help us Lord recognizing that Lord God this flesh Lord can be so easily pulled upon but I'm thankful that there is an attraction from within Lord God that substance of your own being Lord of your own self oh God the Lord you would draw Upon Our Hearts the Lord God and there is an aligning with the plan and purpose of God just say Lord forgive me I got out of Step Lord I realize that I got my eyes on the wrong things I got caught up in the wrong thing Lord God help me Lord I pray father help us Lord we need your leadership Lord traps that are all around us and like your Prophet said like a child a little toddler we would stagger right into those things but Lord we're looking to you that you would help us Lord God you never told us to walk around fearful because of traps but we are just the Lord instructed if we would just keep our eyes on you God help us Lord and I'm thankful Lord when we have fallen in a trap I'm grateful there is Grace sufficient Lord for us to get back up brush ourselves off and get back right in Step Lord thank you for your mercy tonight Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen what are we preparing for amen I'm getting ready to leave how about you amen amen I I'm getting ready to leave you know sometimes we look at that and say why yeah I'm too boy I can't wait for the Rapture morning no no sometimes God when he's letting you and I know are you getting ready to leave that bitterness are you getting ready to leave that see because Rapture itself is to be caught up Rapture is to be one rescued is to be delivered not as one that doesn't belong or is not fitting for it but it's how God sweeps right in that's what a rapture and you know the Rapture itself it's not going to be like some special day to where that everything was just absolutely right your breakfast was just right everything was just right you were changing the oil on the car and man everything was going perfect now as a matter of fact when God showed up to Abraham's tent Abraham and Sarah that morning had just had a spew or heated Fellowship right but it didn't stop God you see of the Rapture will be another moment in the life of the believer because the Rapture is already working in our life right now think about how many times that God already we've had
