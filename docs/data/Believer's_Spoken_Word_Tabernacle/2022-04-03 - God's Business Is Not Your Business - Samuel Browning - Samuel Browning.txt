your words [Music] no greater desire we could have that the lord would have his way so good to be together once again it's good to see you all just love you appreciate each and every one of you god bless you may god just just pour out of his blessings this morning that he just come and just ministered just what what we have need of this man amen i want to just make an announcement here lord willing next sunday for the carmen mills from nova scotia canada he'll be here with us on sunday morning and brother carmen is just a real real good brother ministered there with him in services there in byc as well as i was there a few years back and ministered there at the church in nova scotia just a wonderful group of people carmen's just just a wonderful wonderful brother i know that you'll be blessed by his ministry just a wonderful ministry and we also have communion next sunday as well and i want to just just a few moments here just to mention a few things to you there's been some things that over the years even my dad and i had talked about at times and there were some things we wanted to make a change and i talked with the deacons here even some years ago and i told them i said i felt like this is a moment to make that change that is and let me just give you just a few moments instead of having just a single cup right up here we're going to have the trays with every individual cup now i have to say it you know i don't have any other words but sometimes we can be very dogmatic about things and the way that you know it's a dogmatic it doesn't allow you to move into other areas and it's binding but i want to say this to you it's coming out of one vessel it's coming out of one vessel it's coming out of one vessel and going into every one of those cubs and to say it like this i you know you know me very well you know the church here as well i take my cues also from how god directed his prophet and brother branham brought that right into the tabernacle right there and i tell you the angel of the lord must have not had a problem with it either because if you remember the testimony when they ran out of wine they ran out of wine in a communion service they did in a lot for everybody was going to be there and the brother came to brother branham you know he's standing right there serving he says what are we going to do we ran out of wine let's just pray let's just pray and he said as we were praying he said i couldn't help but he said i had to peek a little bit and he said i watched wine rise from the bottom of those cups [Applause] we're talking about the word of the living god we're talking about the word of the living god that would speak where there should not be any squirrels and squirrels came let me tell you that wasn't talking about squirrels that was talking about me and you where they could have looked in our life and thought what good could come out of that life that you let the word be spoken over that life not a squirrel that comes out every but a son and daughter of god comes out of that that's the power of this word the living word of god because it's not a man's word it's god's word it's god vindicating his word god watching over it so i just wanted to share that with you lord willing and i don't i don't have a time for the service you know we don't do that as far as the community we'll just try to do it right after we finish the morning service because i have to get brother carmen from here and um he's got to fly out from there and go on in his trip but he just he wanted to stop by for fellowship and i said hey you can come but if you're coming you're going to preach so so we're just we're just delighted to have him here just looking forward to the good things that god is doing god is doing some wonderful wonderful things amen you may not see everything but he's doing wonderful things in this hour amen well could we sing that one more time and let's turn to joshua chapter one and let's sing this have thy way [Music] oh fill our hearts lord oh yes lord fill our hearts god refill us lord and as we [Music] as we pray speak your [Music] heavenly father lord as we turn the pages of your word dear god we're asking that you'll just move down among us in a special way this morning god help us lord that we can just step out of the way that you can step down lord and just speak your word to our hearts lord we just surrender ourselves to you speaker and here we ask god that you'll just move among us in a special way according to every need that's here god may the holy ghost just take the uppermost seed and displace god in every heart and every oh god may you pour out of yourself lord fill vessels this morning refill vessels o god lord we're asking o god for everyone the lord that would be in need this morning that every need be met oh god lord you told us to ask for big things and we're asking oh god father we love you and we thank you and just ask you just come and just direct us in your word this morning speak to our hearts god come personally to every one of us lord in the name of jesus christ amen amen joshua chapter one and we'll thank you musicians i want to read a few verses of scripture here if you wouldn't mind i'd like to read the first 11 verses together and then we'll let you be seated now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of none moses minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this jordan thou and all this people unto the land which i do give thee even to the children of israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that i that have i given unto you as i said unto moses from the wilderness and this lebanon even unto the great river the river euphrates and all the land of the hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor for safety be strong and of a good courage for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee i want you to notice that verse turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whether soever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success i want you to notice in verse 8 it's tied the prospered prospering way and good success is tied to observing the word that god has spoke through his servant the prophet don't turn from it to the left or right just stay right with it or i may not understand stay right with it and as you stay with it don't let the word depart out of your mouth you're ordained to be a spokesman of the word in this hour you know you can tell what a person feeds on by what they talk about now you know it doesn't mean like brother dave and i can get out there on the boat and we go fishing and he starts talking about you know the lake like it's interstates and things but it's not that's not very long at all he doesn't we don't even talk about that very long right away then he starts going right into talking about things of of the lord we start fellowshipping on it sometimes when i've ran into brother joey out here in the parking lot it don't stay too long on deer we'd all like to have a good size but it very quickly turns to you know what i was hearing the other day you know what i was listening to the other day it turns to the word of god that's the he's the theme of our life it's him that sets everything else in order in our life now notice verse 9 have not i commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee whether so ever thou goest then joshua commanded the officers of the people saying pass through the host and command the people saying prepare you victims for within three days ye shall pass over this jordan there's no uncertainty in that in three days you shall pass over this jordan to go in to possess the land which the lord your god giveth you to possess it amen may god add the blessing to the word as you're being seated let me just refer to this quote and then i'll give you my title here this morning i actually thought i was going to be if i had to win according to last week and the way the inspiration had flowed into those parts there and where we were already at i would have i was already under the mindset and the set i'm going into a further part that god had other plans so i want to come back into a i read you this quote to start last week's service on the gathering unto him and we were dealing with the part of how that in this hour god has promised another ephesians just as he did a coming out of of egypt and into the promised land in going into the promised land is going into the ephesians because redemption's in two parts then coming then when here john the baptist stood there was an announcement of another ephesians that was coming to the church of the living god and we seen that example in the life of the lord jesus and there were believers that went on into the upper room and they came into their position they had in ephesians and now at the end of of the church ages and you recognize that the seven church ages that was all a mystery god calling out a gentile bride the jews were blinded paul lays that out so clearly in romans they were blinded for our sake daniel didn't see that that that that space of time where god would be dealing with the gentiles it was very much of how paul would write of it a hidden mystery it was the mystery of god which the mystery of god is the god's own life the holy spirit coming in the life of the believer and quickening that seed and bringing forth the son and daughter of god that was a mystery but you see when it was given in the time that it was to be announced and to come forth god already has this planned out he had a vessel by the name of paul who was chosen who was ordained even against his own will but he was set aside and he surrendered his will and god brought forth the announcement to the gentiles and there it opens to you and i in this even in the time that we're living in showing god in his season it's god that unfolds his word when it's time for that word to be made manifest and there are people just as much as there's a messenger there are people who are called by god to receive that word to receive that life and manifest that word and walk by it when victory that's all god's doing this is god's arrangement it's not our arrangement so when we see this this ephesians and you recognize the scripture that we are are looking at here in joshua 1 god is giving such assurance to joshua this is not a pep rally he's letting joshua know moses my servant is dead now it's time to go over this jordan and remember moses was a type of the law moses was a type because remember of what when thou shalt do this and do this and do this and they were blessed as long as they heeded to it but the law could never take them into the promised land and i'm just saying in this way it's wonderful for a life that can look into god's word and this says god says do this and i do this but the difference is when you do it out of fear and i'm talking about slavish fear not reverential fear slavish fear is where well if i don't do this i'm going to go to hell and if i don't do this and i've got god doesn't god you can't operate as a son and daughter of god under that fear that's a tormenting fear but you see there's a place you can come to to where it's reverential fear and reverential theories that's where the bible says the fear of the lord is clean you're obeying it because this is what god said to do so it's not i'm afraid of going to hell it's how god even deals with the life in the beginning you're not you don't do it out of fear of oh if i don't do this god's gonna get mad at me god god can't move in that way but you do it because you recognize it's the love of god his grace that would even come to you and i and chasten us correct us direct us into that place that he himself steps down and takes us into the promise so we are in an ephesians right now and that ephesians that we're in remember the first ephesians or first exodus was a coming out of a natural land going into a natural land the land of canaan then there was the second ephesians coming out of the natural land of canaan and going into the baptism of the holy ghost the spiritual land where all the promises lay with the for the believer and in this hour we are called from that spiritual land first coming into the holy ghost then through there we are directed into my father's house our many mansions in other words the promise from the baptism of the holy ghost the person of christ among us we are in an expectation of the rapture what all the ages and all the rest have looked for and longed for we are in that ephesians then ephesians to where that there are sons and daughters of god where the earth has been groaning and travailing and waiting for the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god you see the earth is a redeemable attribute it's longing to come back into its position but he knows it cannot come back to his position before the sons of god come back to their position everything must operate in its position you see what a blessing it is if we get out of position then we cannot expect other things to come in position but if we'll stay in position then we can look to god who puts everything else in position when it needs to be put in position oh my what a rest joshua could say but what if i fail as i was with moses so will i be with thee i don't want you walking around and timing this i i don't want you walking around looking over your shoulder and wondering i don't want you doing that i want you to understand joshua that there's going to be mistakes you'll make you will fail but my grace is sufficient [Applause] oh my if joshua could have only seen ahead of time of even certain decisions that he would make when he got into the land and certain things that he could kind of look at and say you guys look legitimate old clothes and motherly bread and you guys look all right you look legitimate but see never never never go by the feelings or how something looks he was charged joshua was charged take it back to the word is that right so how is it to be divided take it back to the word and the joshua in this hour it represents the end time ministry of the spirit of truth the lord jesus christ right here among his believing children oh my we can just bang bring that direction and just let our thoughts be so aligned with the word of god now when we look at this here brother branham would say it in this manner in the message the paradox he says you know if they men and people are always you know when they think about divine healing some work of grace they always think that there's something they have to do and i want you to listen very carefully they always think there's something they have to do you there is nothing you have to do but believe just believe god and and if they would have continued on talking about israel in their march coming to that of the land the promise wasn't given under the law the promise was given before the law without any conditions to it i've given you this land go on over into it but before they got to that promise they decided there was something that they must do themselves and that we still find that among human beings we're prone to be that way there's something we've got to do in other words or we feel like we got to make something happen oh it just don't seem like it's going the way it ought to be going and oh we need to be doing this why are you panicking are you panicking god has spoken who can but prophesy we are to look we are a people that are to look with the full expectation for god to come according to his word is that right so you see he says we're prone to be that way there's something we've got to do we feel that and we've got to have something into it also listen you do have something into it that's your surrender of your own will and your own ideas everybody say surrender or if we only had the white flags here's what you surrender to we're surrendering to the will and idea of almighty god and it's finished that's all there is just take his promise don't think nothing don't think of nothing else walk by it and god does the rest of it it's surrendering this whole land of promise when you take the whole account of that of joshua god asks them to do things that doesn't make sense to the natural mind but god does it that way to show and prove that he's god let me just say it to you in this way god isn't interested in trying to make sense are you hearing me if you're trying to make sense of god and put him all in and figure it all out you'll never be able to do it because you can't put him in a box he is the god of his word and we know him by faith now let me just say what i'm going to speak on here and really taking off the thoughts where we were kind of looking last week but i want to speak a little a little part here god's business is not your business god's business is not your business you see in the book of john chapter 6 they ask the question what shall we do that we may work the works of god and jesus told him he said you are to believe on him whom he hath sent that's the work of god because once you believe the messenger what he's saying and recognize that that's not his word it's god's word it's speaking and you believe that then that word goes to work and that word performs in your life and what you find is the works of that word the works of god begin to come forth out of your life what must we do believe sir believe the greatest battle greatest contest greatest conflict that's ever been and still is is between faith and reasoning it goes on and let me say this it that in itself doesn't stop after you've got the holy ghost but when you've got the holy ghost you've got greater is he that is in you you've got a power on the inside and you can just release that and let it go it'll carry you beyond your reasonings and where your reasonings say i don't know about that i don't know about this but faith in god's word will carry you beyond your reasonings we have nothing wrong with reasonings but when reasoning contradict god's word we call reasoning a liar is that right now notice this in joshua 3. i don't know if i'm going to read or just refer to a few of these places but in joshua 3 if you notice here is joshua he's telling the people i want you to sanctify yourselves for tomorrow this is the second day the third day we're going over there is nothing that is uncertain about what joshua is saying but i want you to catch this he's telling the people you sanctify yourselves god's not going to do that for you that's your business but god's business is he'll take you over so our business is to do what god has asked us to do the conditions then for god to come on the scene and fulfill his business because after all we're business partners well that must be about my father's business we must be we must be about his business do what he says do then he steps in and does what only he can do amen so here notice what joshua has told the people in that time and he's letting him know now here's the order of approach here's how we're going in the land here's how it's going to open on that third day on that third day the priests themselves are going to take the ark upon their shoulders remember what the ark contained the ark contained that of the word it represented the word taking the word into your heart putting the word first we're going to take the word and i want as the priest they bring this word and they step in the edge of the water i want you to witness of how then god will part the waters he'll cause the waters to stay now i want you to catch this here in verse 13 he says and it shall come to pass as soon as the souls of the feet of the priest that bear the ark of the lord the lord of all the earth shall rest in the waters of jordan that the waters of jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall stand upon a heat and verse 15 and as they bear the ark they will come unto the jordan and the feet of the priests that bear the ark were dipped in the brim of the water for jordan overflowed its banks all the time of harvest now to think of this in this time it did not make sense to cross jordan at this time where they crossed that brother brown lays it out clearly he said at other times of the year they could have walked right through there but it was at the time of harvest where the waters oh my where the waters were so great i don't want to run out here on on and tying this in and tying that but we might as well run with it we're living in a time when the waters are very great are you hearing me the bible says the setteth upon the waters waters that are wanting to stand between when you say waters waters are people but remember the people are influenced by spirits and every demon out of hell is against this advancement of the word satan is against you from coming into the promise of god's word if he can point out all your faults if he can point out all your shortcomings let me tell you something this guy has things to say that you could say that makes sense i know me i know about me but remember we're not to look at what the enemy says you are to look at what god says you'll never make yourself worthy you'll never be a fit candidate in yourself it is god who makes us worthy it is god who provides for himself it's god who gives the word that we can take that word and be made ready to come into the promise it was a time of prevailing waters it didn't make sense that this was the time to cross you know it's like sometimes in our life we come across certain things and we think you know what this just ain't the time to do this this ain't no time i'm talking about him in the natural you know what this will wait till spring spring's here this just ain't the time to do it there's a better time to do it right i know they put siding and things on the houses you know in the wintertime but like brother richie and them will tell you i mean they have to a lot you know for that expansion and things even have because of the temperature of the weather but it's not real real conducive time to put it on there right that's in the natural but how much more right here where you have some some 2 million people or more that's going to cross into the promised land and god brings them to a place right here it's at the time of harvest and the water is flooding the banks and here's what joshua there's no uncertainty about it he says get ready get ready preparing victims because three days we're going over and the third day we're going over the word is going to go before us we're going to give the word preeminence the word is going to part the way you see nothing but the word will make a way the word makes a way for himself oh my i don't want to get ahead of myself but you see when we look at that of how that they were called at the worst time that could be thought of but you see god likes to take those kind of times to prove that he's god and any man any woman that's ever amounted to anything anyone that's been a man of god a woman of god is those who will believe god what he's promised and is not afraid to do it because god will always stick with his word just as certain as he's god but the first thing is you've got to take the word you can't expect word results without the word it's got to be the word first that's our business god gives the word it's our business to take the word like the priests were to take the word under the direction of joshua joshua had received direction from god now joshua is passing on that direction to the people and everything has got to fall right in line to where the word will have preeminence you know what it means to have preeminence it means where our thoughts and our ideas we let them go and let's just be honest sometimes we need to say god i need a fresh killing brother brown could stand there in perfect strength and he said this tabernacle needs a killing and i need a fresh killing with it what is it our own ideas about things sometimes our own thoughts about it and where do we end up with our own ideas and our own thoughts frustrated but god has not given it to you and i to bring the word to pass that's not our business but our business is to believe the word to act upon that word and then it's god's business to come behind it is that right so you see god has given his word now brother puts it in this way taking the word of god as the priest took the word upon their shoulders and brother brown would say it in this way i i love this in time testing memorials he said it's the same for you sick people here tonight put god's word with your confession put your confession you believed it you set out there and you call those things which are not as though they were then we're marching on do it that way god's word will take it through now think of it in in this in this moment that the people in that time it's one thing for joshua to say get ready sanctify yourselves we're going over tomorrow it's one thing for him to say it but it's another thing for the people to believe it you know it's like brother brown gave the example he said here was a man that said oh pastor you can do great things oh pastor you pray for the sick oh pastor you you do this and you do that and all these things and oh my you know and and here brother brother brown turns around he says like a man he said is you know on a wheelbarrow he said you know he's willing to people over this little log from one edge to the other edge and my man you just do a good job with that wheelbarrow my pastor you do so wonderful this is so good finally the pastor said your turn to get in i don't know i mean that's that's an awful big drop right there but wait a minute i thought you said you had faith see what what we need to be what instead of the man the man listen to me now the man could be looking to a gift that's why brother brahma could say and take that when they raised that brass serpent in the wilderness the promise was look and live but brother bram said if they looked on it as a gift that would heal them they failed and would not receive their healing but if they can look at it that it's god's word that's been set before me then there would be virtue that would come because their faith is appropriated in the word of god that has been set before him that's the same way right here this morning we can look at it and rejoice in it but it's time to get in the wheelbarrow it's time to go to the other side so these people they had to have confidence in faith in what god was saying you see this is to me the the paradox when we talk about a paradox it is absolutely a paradox of the anointing of the word and how god will come remember moses was so complex perplexed about it of what do i do when i get down there if i say this and when they're going to ask me this and i say this see it's always here was the humanity coming out in that manner of people are going to want me to prove it people are going to want this and people are going to want that but you see one thing that moses was failing to recognize he came to it eventually was that god himself said i will accompany you it's not going to be your word but i will be there to accompany it not only with signs and wonders but my presence will be right there with you and the same god who's sending him down there there are people that are ordained to hear that word and as they begin to give ear to that word the anointing of the word that moses met and came with him now begins to fall upon the people to walk in obedience to the word that's a paradox i said that's a paradox well this time you say oh if i can only be a moses if you have been born again of the spirit of god you are a moses let not this law depart out of thy mouth you recognize your obedience to the word in your home invites not just oh i'm going to preach to him about this and i'm going to run no no the obedience to the word invites the anointing of the word into your home it invites the anointing into your life what does that obedience to the word of almighty god is that right because you can have absolute truth but if you're vexed in your delivery that ain't god are you hearing me now well i'm just upset and frustrated that ain't god don't blame that on god that is that is not according to god's word and god won't back that up are you hearing me god won't back up that but god will only back up his word listen this is why everything must come under the discernment of the word every motive every objective and it must come according to god's channel oh blessed be the name of the lord you see regardless you know brother john they could look over there and they could see them banks was flooded but regardless of how the circumstances looked they were making ready when you looked at their lives they were making ready to go across the jordan how's that gonna happen i don't know he just said get ready he just said be ready that's all god you see god had moved in such a place remember that old generation of doubters died off the ones who wanted to bring up an evil report you know what the evil report was it wasn't whole night oh wow that's cancer oh no no the evil report was they didn't believe that god was able to keep his word and you know what it was they said god you can't do your business you know why because they weren't doing their business come on transfer oh my god couldn't god can't gonna come down and operate like that but you see regardless of what was going on no matter the circumstance in the midst of all of that they were holding to the promise of god because you know circumstances don't stop god circumstances don't mean nothing to god circumstances stand out to you and i mean come on friends let's just be honest circumstances stand out to you and i but not to god and a believer this is where god locking us in let me tell you something friends this message this is not theology this is not something that's to be put on the bookshelf and played once in a while and then we go back to our own doubting ways that's not what this message produces this message produces faith in the hearts of the people well brother samuel i've been listening to it maybe you need to feed on it feed on it take it in and allow the word as you're taking it in say lord god cleanse me of my own ideas my own thoughts and my own being lord rub out every complex rub out everything lord if there's something in the way that's causing lord god the word not to have preeminence this is where we're looking in the face of the word and taking account in our own lives anybody in here like to stand in front of somebody and they criticize you nobody does but the word ain't here to criticize you and i but the word is here to point out the faults and the flaws and everything that's in our life and if we will behold him who is the word there is sufficient grace that is present that we can call upon him and invite the presence of god down in our life to change us oh my no wonder you say brother samuel i've been chained but are you being changed we were to be changed being changed there should be a changing that's going on changing from glory unto glory amen maturing are going on you see god takes believers to prove his word through look how brother brahman says this with joshua joshua how are you going to get across that river that's not my business it's my business to walk down to the river oh now so wait a minute now you mean he they actually had to walk down to the river in order for god to do his business yeah if they stayed in the camp and said hey you know what y'all tell me when that when that when it's parted and we'll go no no now god's business is not your business but neither is your business god's business hallelujah it's my business to walk down to the river it's god's business to open it up when i get there oh it's your business to testify and claim your healing and say i'm healed it's god's business to take care of it after you testify and proclaim it oh my how many say god i want you to do your business and lord help me to do my business glory be to god oh my oh my what what strength that we can receive from that you think of how that you know when we look here let me just just move ahead here for a few moments and look at elijah here many places we could go in the scriptures there's there's not there's not an example in the scripture that we couldn't take i i just i could just preach the whole bible with this thought god's business is not your business because every man every son and daughter of god it has always been that way that it's it's been god a lot things for you and i to do that we might show our faith how would we know what to do if he didn't show us see it's even his grace that he would show us what to do then it's his business to come on the scene and fulfill his word notice when he calls elijah here elijah remember in in first kings 18 i may kind of move around a little bit on this but elijah when the people had had departed from the living god and they were between two opinions remember elijah received a word from the lord and that word was is column to mount carmel for a showdown i want you to think of this elijah had something that he had to do you said god had spoke to him but when god speaks are you hearing me now when god speaks he's asking us to do something you said i didn't think i had nothing to do in it you don't what you're confusing me no no there's no confusion what god calls us to do is to surrender our will and our own idea i'll just come to use examples it comes to me if i invited you over to my house let's say brother joshua you came over and brother william and we're going to have jambalaya brother timothy and brother daniel they loved him well my wife and i we might make it a little different the shrimp the chicken i don't like fishing for meat like that shrimp fart no this let's just put it in there we ain't doing a little different we do but if you all came over there and you got in the kitchen and said ah sister kim no no no no no uh no no you need to be put in this creole season you know only a fourth a teaspoon we only need you know you only need an eighth of the cayenne pepper no i love you all but i have to tell you step out of the kitchen i invited you to have jambalaya the way we make it if you want it the way you make it make it at your own house but don't come in my kitchen and tell me what to do in my kitchen you ever been that way why why prepare something i've already embarrassed her and i've god has helped me to learn my lesson because i wasn't even thinking about it i wasn't thinking nobody altered anything but i sat down at the table a dish that she's made and i'm you know well joey ain't not hard to tell i look forward to eating and she says a certain dish i asked her what's for dinner when do you do that in the morning what's for dinner today i can have a good expectation but sometimes i've sat down this don't think right what was what was left out of this what was not right now my wife you know she's like because maybe somebody else got in the kitchen and oh well let's just do this and do this i've learned god's helped me because i realized maybe maybe somebody else started sprinkling stuff in or left this out or left that out you see there's a certain expectation that we even in ourselves would have god god gave god gave the word to elijah but elijah had to follow what god said do you see god gave him and now he had to follow it elijah came and i just referred to the scriptures he repaired the altar he had to take the stones that were there and repair it is that right then he had then as he repaired that altar then he had to cut the wood put the wood in order then he had to put the sacrifice in order then he told them go fill the barrels with water they had to dig the trench around there and fill that trench with water that was all a part of what god asked him to do all of that was elijah's business are you hearing me that was elijah's business but god's business was when elijah came to that spot and everything was set in order and elijah could pray and say hear me o lord hear me he was praying with the certainty that this is what god has promised and down came the fire he took care of his business that god had revealed to him and now god took care of his business oh my think of this this is why as we said like even with that of that that you know that recipe about jambalaya do what god has said to do no more than these brothers would come there and i would welcome them in putting more salt here in doing this and doing that no we're going to make it you're invited to it and that's how god expects us to conduct our business is to take his word not try to understand it not try to figure it out we'll add a little bit more salt here not that much creole there a little bit more cayenne here not too much broth there god says i don't want you turning from the left or to the right i don't want you altering this recipe i want you to stay with my word if you want the results of the fire stay with the word hallelujah what my son do you've been invited to a feast just enjoy yourself hallelujah oh my you see before that time we just read about god had told is god had told it elijah go stand to in front of ahab and tell him they're not going to be do a rain fall from heaven until i call for it that's a mighty big statement hey that was a mighty big statement joshua made and said three days were going over that's a mind that's a mighty big statement but you see there's an anointing that comes with that word if you believe it you begin to act on it and make preparations for it but while that was going on god told elijah i have got a place reserved for you up in the mountains and i've got some water up there brother braham said didn't make any sense going up to the mountains where it would be dry but god had a place provided and he said i've commanded think of this the ravens to feed you i don't think of this just for a moment it would be like you or i go into a restaurant and somebody shows up to our table without any arms and they say i'm here to serve you today first of all come on be honest with me first of all the thoughts going to hit your mind how they're going to write down to make sure that my state gets done the right way and that they might have a great memory but the next thing is how they're going to bring my food here how they're going to do all this it's not just my table it's other tables as well the first thing that would hit our mind thing why because as human beings we are prone to go that way first and let me just say this there are some things listen friends there are some things that we should just be able to look at and know are you hearing me there are some things it's just like when you sit down in front of a car payment if you can't afford it you understand what i'm saying don't don't don't go out on the ballpark with me now but you understand if it's something and it's not a need and it's something you're looking at you can look at that and think man you know what this is this is a want this really ain't a need there ain't something that you've got to then turn around and pray about i'm not talking about when there's a need and it might pinch and cut in a little bit i'm talking about sometimes on wants there's certain things that you're not saying well i'm going to go home and pray about it no what it is you really really really want it oh you're thinking about it here just go and drive it fill the seats and how they got the air conditioning and the warming and this and that no thank you we know those tricks see yourself in it you look like the same same person [Music] oh jesus the cadillac don't make you look better it might be a nicer ride but it'll make you look better oh lord how do we get there but you understand there's things that when we're when we're looking at all of this with the promises of god and you see where they were at god then i'm going to command the ravens to feed you elijah didn't even have a question about it he wasn't even questioning how's that gonna be i like how brother brad makes it so simple in the message certain sound he said elijah didn't even stop to think i how in the world what kind of ravens are gonna do that how can a raven pick up the beef how can a raven carry it how can a raven do this he said what it was elijah had heard from god just as much as there was a certainty that judgment was coming there was a certainty there is a place provided for you and god didn't say i might send ravens maybe i will might be god said i've already commanded them let me tell you something god's not maybe going to send the holy ghost it's not a maybe he said i have sent the holy ghost it's right here among us it's a promise of almighty god you say what do i have to do your business is repent and another part of your business is be baptized in the name of jesus christ and god's business is he will fill you with the holy ghost hallelujah our business and god's business oh my think of this here for a moment the brook dries up i'm coming down the brook dries up because there's just no ending to this and god lets him know this is dried up but i got a i got a widow of therapists i want you to go to she don't know it but i have commanded her to feed thee doesn't know she's in the drama she don't know she's in the vision she don't know what she's about to entertain know that she's been praying god lord the mill barrel the crucible she's been praying and she's been looking to the lord but she does not know that god is sending his answer to her need all glory be to god but god has it all arranged for the actors would be on the stage at the right time and the right things would be said and let me say there's an anointing that companies this word when he goes down there and he speaks to her he mentions to her he said give me a little drink of water okay no problem i got plenty of water are you hearing me now everyone don't hesitate tonight give me water so she went through getting water a hesitation but then as she went to act upon that here came the word bring me a cake she says i only have enough for my son and i to make one cake we're going to eat it and we're going to die she knew that's all that they had but he said bring me a cake first what a lesson here putting god first you always come out in victory that's why god could say honor me with thy firstfruits that tithes and thy offerings and thy barns shall be filled with plenty are you hearing me church these are things because god don't write out our check for tithing lord jesus god don't write out the check for offering god don't do that there's some things god does but that ain't his business that's our business are you hearing me that's our business god said i'll put it in your hands now can i trust you that's our business but it's god's business he said i'll pour you out a blessing that you cannot contain that's god's business is that right here this little woman was in this in this situation and she was standing there but from that moment on she went in there and she made that cake and she brought it brought it right out there to the prophet and at that moment there came the words thus saith the lord the mill barrel nor the cruce of oil will never run dry you see she might have been looking for a sign are you hearing me now i want a sign but god never promised that signs would come first he said if we believe they that believe and the signs shall follow them that believe the sign of the holy ghost follows them and that to believe are you hearing me it follows them that believe and here she was in that place and she surrendered her own thoughts and her own ideas to bring that cake and to present it there said brother samuel what's this he's talking about our life many many ways we can run into this it's speaking about our whole life our life being being completely yielded and surrendered to god things that you and i it doesn't make sense within our minds but if we can just heed to the word of almighty god let me tell you something she didn't have nothing she didn't have enough to sustain her house before the word of the lord came to her but when she all she had to do her business was to make the cake god wasn't gonna make the cake lord you just speak the word and make the cake no you show your faith by taking the word that's our business it's our business to come it's our business to present ourselves it's our business to take him at his word it's god's business to come and fulfill his word after that visitation every meal after that was a product of thus saith the lord her life after that was god's willingness it was in god's hands all she had to do was surrender her own thoughts and her own thinking and god supply just what she had need of it was god's business hallelujah right this was like as young people and everything else you know you don't come and say pray for me i've got to have a test my first question how you studied right well i didn't study very hard we think we think the magic on friends we have to put those stones together in the altar we got to lay the wood on we have to do our part and when you've done your part that god expects you to do then god will come and do what you can't do he'll bring things back to your remembrance he'll open you remember brother man tells us in key to the door he don't only take the message key to the door and deal with it in faith he says everything even in this natural life for mathematics and engineering and everything there is a key to all of that and when that key comes it becomes the aha it starts to unlock other things and once other things are unlocked what is that faith operating as an engineer faith as a mathematician faith as a plumber faith is deciding man faith has faith faith you because you're operating in confidence you're not walking on the job said well i don't know if i can do this drywall job or not you know i'm not real too good at it i don't know you know the the the screw stick through you know i just seem to get mud everywhere i really don't know you don't go on the job like that once the key has come there's a confidence is that right when we have to apply ourselves give ourselves to the word that's our business that's our business lord i want the holy ghost so bad it's your business to repent well i have repented i'm not just talking about for being sorry i'm talking about to where you hate that thing you abhorrent that's what the word repent means you abhor it i don't want nothing to do with this life i want jesus christ listen when you fully surrender he fully comes in it's our business to surrender and then god does his business this is why the scriptures when it speaks concerning our life and faith and direction i trust your faith is growing and building even this morning when you recognize it it should be when you recognize that part that you and i are called to do and god steps in and does what only he can do because sometimes we're wondering well i wonder why this hasn't happened i wonder why that hasn't happened i wonder why you don't need to wonder you come back remember brother branham when he preaches the message is be certain of god be certain of god first be certain listen if there's something in your life that's not right get it made right because god ain't gonna come over that god's business is to do his business but part of our business is confess your sins and he's faithful and just to forgive you and cleanse you from all unrighteousness if you got to make something right go make it right are you hearing me that's part of our business god ain't gonna walk over you and make it right and say hey joey let me tell you something samuel needs to make this right so i'm coming over here to do it for him is that all right nope if i wronged him my business is to go to him the word that right that's what the word says right then it's god's business to move behind that is that right that's how that's that's that's the part of the word it's god's god's word and god's business to move on the scene behind his word let me just let me close with this here you see the scripture tells us they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover how many believe that still i believe that promise still i know that healing can come right what we're setting and listening to the word we've had testimonies here even at times where i've received healing you probably have to i haven't even been right here in the house of god maybe been out on the lawn or driving or somewhere but this promise is still in effect they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover now you see i never i never just i never determined where it was going to happen well i'm going to go and you know i'm going to speak the word and this is how it's going to happen i don't know how it's going to happen i don't know when it's going to happen if i need healing i don't know that but i know what he promised and i know it's my promise are you hearing me part of our business is to be certain that what he said he will do and if you listen what the holy spirit has said one of the things that will keep you back from being certain is unconfessed sin that's one of the devil's ways to hide and it builds doubt and unbelief condemnation what do i do confess it because he already knows it anyhow you see god isn't here to put you down god's here to release you the enemy like to keep you locked away and keep you hindered but this god is here a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities he's here to release us what do i have to do confess it side with the word of god confess it repent let it be let it be brought under the blood of the lord jesus christ then we can stand on this promise they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover this is a promise in god's word let me read you another another scripture here in the book of james and these are familiar scriptures these are not probably majority of us at different times could quote these scriptures with our just waking up from a nap but sometimes where we miss and we fail is the order that god has given james 5 14 is any sick among you let him wait for the pastor or the deacon to call what version is that that must be the you version of the bible you know the youtube the me do me version that must be the weight on them come on friends more taren's it been 20 years i've been pastoring and there's some times and we understand it sometimes you know oh you know we can get offended with things but if we'll follow the word listen we follow the word then we get the word results brother sister where you been oh i've been sick for so weeks who'd you let know who'd you call well i didn't want to bother nobody you're not bothering anybody this is the word is there any sick among you let them call for the elders of the church you can even send a text you know what this is showing it's your business to do this well i don't got a voice use them fingers all right you can have somebody else hey call so notice let them call for the elders of the church let them pray over him so they call then the elders pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up and if he's committed any sins they shall be forgiven him let's just stop god's business is not our business god is determined to fulfill his word the original commission mark 16 go you therefore and preach the gospel and then that believe and are baptized shall be saved very simply put brother bram says my responsibility is to preach it it's god's responsibility to see that it gets to the predestinated seeds it ain't up to us we'll make this one no we don't make nobody a predestinated seed we don't make nobody oh i'm going to make them a child of god bless god i'm going to get no we don't do that our business is to preach the gospel and if you ain't called to preach don't do it on facebook either go ahead and live the gospel because a life that's live that is a sermon that is a living reality that's what gets the attention of others sometimes you might think well i don't think nothing's having an effect you know brother branham thought in himself when he about going out west he thought man it just the message ain't hitting with the people it ain't hit brother brahman said you know he said sometimes when you think things aren't hidden he says and and soaking up that he said you just be salty brethren gives us an example brother greg of when there was a man who had stood up in a breakfast out west and he had said certain things ministered brother demas or no brother williams got it behind him brother william said well i can imagine i can admire brother williams standing up behind him and said that ain't the way that brother branham's taught it he said would you like me to bring brother branham here would you like me to bring him back he said brother branham he said i went down through that audience he said there was hundred dollar bills being put in my hand he said your trip here and back is already paid for brother baby said see he said i thought the word wasn't getting through but he said it was having an effect all the long and brother brahm takes that and he applies that with spouses in marriage and with our children he said sometimes what you think is not having an effect but if you just live a salty life live a salty life well my business know your business and my business is to live the word be available be an instrument be a channel that the token an atmosphere can be created around there and then it's god's business to step down what a release if we can just really catch that that for every promise that's right here this morning for anyone seeking the holy ghost for a life that needs healing deliverance whatever the need is if we can heed to his word and do that business that he's calling us to do then he'll do his business what do i have to do well god told israel he said when you carry that ark remember god said those feet they had to get into the water think about it when they put the ark on they put the word on the shoulder the priest there and joshua three the water didn't move they had to get their feet in the water let me just say it how brother graham said it he said they waited in water for maybe for 20 feet he said but when they got to about the 40-foot point they were standing on dry ground you see sometimes when you start into something it didn't feel like wow does this feel right no it didn't feel right it didn't even look right they were walking into water and that can be a promise that's right before you what do i do walk on into the water with what with the word because know that the holy ghost will always come to the word let's pray heavenly father lord you know lord jesus that even lord just inspiration lord that's you placed on my heart lord with this thought that i certainly didn't know that it would be this week lord didn't know that lord last weekend lord you have a way of ordering things moving things around sometimes the lord in my own being it makes me very nervous because i'm not interested in preaching but as though that well i have to minister this i have to minister this lord even this morning you know even as i awoke i had two messages sitting before me which way do i go lord which way do i go praying lord and seeking not knowing exactly until lord god and just moving down father i believe in lord just as much as you sent elijah to the widow of zerebeth i believe you sent your word this morning lord to minister to our needs i believe god you've spoke to us lord to minister in this time of ephesians that we're in what you are calling to from our lives is a surrender surrendering of our own will surrendering of our own ideas and lord i i'm just going to be honest with you lord you know lord from my heart i ask you and i can be honest and this congregation can too but i'm still dying dying to myself oh i've there's been a death and a new birth has come a new man on the inside the lord as paul would say put on christ he would use that phrase put on in colossians in ephesians and that word put on as the elect of god it speaks of a garment that one would sink into lord jesus i hear your prophet tell us in the message power transformation he says many of us he says as we've received the holy ghost he said now we need to let the mind that was in christ be in us i hear him also say what a privilege it is that immortal could be able to enter in to the mind of christ lord jesus it was the mind of christ that directed elijah to call for that mount carmel showdown but your prophet would tell us in the seventh seal that once that that had pulled back from him he ran when that pulled back from him he ran lord jesus your prophet would tell us in this way he said see as a believer how we need and rely upon the mind of christ letting us know lord god that as the secret that's within the bride of jesus christ she has the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word what he wants done with it he wants us to believe it not believe what we can understand not believe when circumstances seem fitting but against all odds against every circumstance regardless to make ready make ready for the fulfillment lord help us lord as your children help us lord i pray o god that the mind of christ would have the preeminence in our lives lord father we find ourselves lord again and again we find ourselves repenting saying lord forgive me lord and my shortcomings forgive me lord god of my failures and lord every one of those right there can be attributed to us relying upon the natural mind instead of the mind of christ help us lord if there's one here this morning lord that's not moved into that great privilege of the mind of christ maybe lord there's things that they're looking at in the word maybe like you said here in the beginning they've just been very fearful but god may they recognize then lord jesus it's your desire not to create a slavish fear that does not come from you that shows that a heart is still not surrendered when it's under a slavish it's still not surrendered but may we lord surrender it to you may it be surrendered to you lord i'm certain lord all throughout this building there are certain things that lord that even as you work within our lives some things we're prone to some things has been taught into us lord it's almost like we feel we have to do this and if we don't do this we would be sinning or this or that oh god let us operate by the grace of god help us lord may the great joshua of the holy spirit lord just moving right among us lord every one of us in here lord god every one of us lord and may we lord i pray move to operate to do that which is our business so that you can do your business oh lord god help us lord give us grace lord teach us lord show us guide us direct us lord i know god even his families husbands fathers children lord the scripture would say to us our business is to train up a child in the way it should go that's our business as parents it's not your business it's our business it's our business and our homes to invite the holy ghost it's our business to instruct our children to that the presence of god would be there in our home not

went on in and took care of business 120. what happened to the other 380. they saw him ascend when's the last time you seen something like this but 120 took care of business what were they doing minding their business somebody says why i feel are you minding your business if you mind your business god will fulfill his but there was 120 that went in and they took care of their business their business was to go wait in jerusalem and when they got there [Music] god showed up and god took care of his business all they had to do brother carlos was go there but you see it shows taking care of business requires faith remember as we spoke last week god stimulates our faith by his presence not regardless of circumstances we don't try to figure it out we stand upon his word and if there's something in the way that would be holding me back then it's time to get rid of that it's time to clear that out so that i can go all the way whatever it is because whatever it is means nothing compared to him [Music] i believe i'm part of that 120. a lot of them saw it but i believe i'm part of that they went on in and got the pentecostal blessing glory be to god in the house god's business came on the scene oh glory be to god amen and amen glory hallelujah my goodness i'll tell you we ought to go out of here on fire for this week no matter what it is you're facing do your business and god will do his business amen if they're right brother joshua you do your business god will do his business because god has partnered with man glory be to god blessed be his name lord jesus we ask that lord you'd go with us it's been such a delight to be in your presence to be gathered together lord with brothers and sisters of like precious faith lord that you would come among us you would encourage us and strengthen this lord father may even from this moment it'd be such a stirring in hearts that there's anything in the way it'd be laid aside [Music] may we stand like those israelites that did not regard the circumstances of the river that may we take the word over our heart and go stand in the water but you're the one who opened it not just opened it but the bible said they stood on dry ground what a miracle what a paradox the lord when we take your word believe it and act on it that's what we can expect a paradox a miracle help us lord go with your children as they go their own ways father may they receive lord god just exactly what they are asking for healing in their body deliverance a holy ghost granted lord for every need i pray lord god we love you and we thank you
