amen amen I wonder if you'll turn with me to Lamentations chapter 3 I'd like to by the help of the Lord I just didn't feel we got into a place last week when looking on this with hope but I certainly enjoyed the word of the Lord and how the Lord brought it together um I had an opportunity to listen to the message there on Sunday that uh the Lord placed upon brother Stephen and my what a blessing what a blessing I was rejoicing with you and uh it rejoices my heart to hear you rejoice as well uh in the word of the Lord and I just uh I really appreciate brother Stephen I really appreciate his ministry and um you know just uh he's been a real real blessing to us here I know he has other places too uh but he's just just been a real blessing here and so I want to also say thank you uh for your prayers uh for us while we were away and ministering there and um uh the Lord just really just give us wonderful Services there with the young people and then on Sunday and uh some of you who know brother Mike walls um they just got a building and so that's after 32 years and um in this building they got they're going to to be busting at the seams even going into this building but it's a place at least that if you would think about even the DC area it's the the rent and where they were at is just absolutely uh just mind-blowing and so at least we allow them to build equity and um you know they'll be able to get everybody in but um uh you know everyone's really excited for that so I know that they're uh getting ready for that I think this maybe this coming weekend or right after that they'll be able to get into their building it's right outside of um Washington DC there and so um but they asked me to greet you amen and extend their greetings to you and U so we just we appreciate them and perhaps someday we can have brother Mike here brother Mike's just a wonderful brother just a wonderful we' known him for many many years and uh so U just a wonderful brother I I'm not going to take his Thunder and share his testimony but uh I've heard it a couple times of even how God arranged that work there uh but the boys were out we were there together on Sunday and they got a chance to hear the testimony of how God brought that all about I think those are wonderful moments because you can see how God just has everything just so divinely orchestrated and we believe that as Believers we we experien that but it's so wonderful when you hear even that testimony in someone else's life as well and so uh we just just want to say God bless you um let's just look here re very quickly in Lamentations chapter 3 and here Jeremiah is writing this I recall to my mind in verse 21 therefore have I hope it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness the Lord is my portion saith my soul that's right therefore will I hope in him the Lord is good unto them that wait for him to the soul that seeketh him it is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the Salvation of the Lord amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I I didn't include this but would you turn with me to Psalm 62 and I just want to read just a couple verses I I reference these last week but I want to just read him and then we'll just uh draw from there and right here in Psalm 62 this is where uh brother brandham he preaches uh the message Shalom he's drawing from this text and he you have a some time maybe to read it um a little bit later but I want to draw from here in verse one it says truly my soul waiteth upon God from him come cometh my salvation he only is my rock and brother BR was very clear to point that out in that he says that rock is a revelation to you personally of Jesus Christ he is my stabilizer my rock and my Revelation and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be greatly moved and look at this in verse three how long will you imagine Mischief against a man you shall be slain all of you as a bowing wall shall you be and as a tottering fence they only consult to cast him down from his Excellency they Delight in lies they bless with their mouth but they curse inwardly and think of how that Satan has tried over and over to tear down the kingdom of God to tear down the effectiveness of what the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ and the sending of the Holy Spirit among the Believers how he's tried to tear that away from the Church of the Living God but I'm grateful that God In His Infinite Mercy he sees to it that he have we have a visitation from him and in our lives he's not been torn down he's not been diminished to a Creed he's not been diminished to a a self-help but he's been lifted as a matter of fact the veil of who he really is has been removed from our eyes from our mind from our heart and we see him and we know him personally in our own lives as the mighty conqueror this is why then David could resume and say my soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him he only only is my Rock in my salvation he is my defense I shall not be moved in God is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in God trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him God is a refuge for us and I want to just drawing from that uh those places where our expectation is truly from him yes it's an expectation that is revealed and given to our hearts even as God sovereignly moves into our life brother Steven touched a little bit on this on on on Sunday about 34s through the message and he was dealing with how that it is the gift of God even God giving you and I the faith even to believe it's not something that we have mustered up on our own but it is God in his sovereignty you see that's what the word of God comes to let you and I see is that we're under the Sovereign working of almighty God and may God just help us to come into that place of looking to him with a faith and that he would just operate and perform his word and his promise to us and in us and through us this is the desire and so it's God who who gives you and I the faith he releases to inspire to you and I what is needed in this moment and in this hour this is why God when he sent this message in this hour it's for this moment to inspire a group of people that are built for this inspiration you you didn't you know when we look at it all the rest of them down through time have waited for this hour to come they've longed for it as a matter of fact the prophet himself would say I hope that I'm alive to see her when she puts on the Robes of his resurrection power he wanted to see that you see the prophet when he went off the scene he did not go off the scene with I I wonder if if this is going to work he had already not only seen it work it it had been proven but it was a faith to know that the word that God has spoken cannot fail Hallelujah and that's why this message itself it's not a movement it's not something that has been uh uh devised by man but it is a channel that's been open between God and the believer where all veils are taken away where the inspiration has come to you and I and that inspiration I'm talking about is the holy spirit is God's word in this hour to inspire you and I and how God in this in this time has come to deliver to you and I a real expectation Hey listen I'm standing here tonight I believe I'm one of them that's not going to taste death I believe I'm be looking at others here tonight you might say you don't know my condition it doesn't matter what your condition is I believe with all my heart I'm looking at a group of people on whom the ends of the world have come and we're standing with an expectation that just any moment somewhere even between now and even the next breath can come the very change of our bodies we're looking for our loved ones at any time to come Hallelujah I'm expecting that I'm looking for that this hour this message this word the Holy Spirit has brought us into to that place to look for the coming of the Lord so our expectation it's not something that's been derived from a man it's not something that we see how the world and in the best of their interpretation the ecclesiastical world and all of these things that they have of you know the Rapture and how it's all going to be but you know I'm thankful in this hour and I don't say it because that we're anything in ourselves but it's God's grace that is shown to you and I where we're no longer wondering what the next step is what's coming next we're no longer even standing back in a place where the Prophet was in the early years of the ministry and said we don't know what kind of body that is but God in this hour he took a prophet beyond the curtain of time why did he do that in this hour why didn't he do that in Luther's hour in Wesley's hour why didn't he do that at the outpouring on street because it wasn't the time the season or the hour God fulfills his word in season because it is when that word is being fulfilled it stirs the heart of those who are a part of that word God knows what he's doing that's right so here what a a a very a a a great key in this scripture this portion we've looked at in my hope is in the the Lord is that the Lord is the portion sath my soul he's my portion he's my portion he's he's my he's my inheritance he's mine who's saying this my soul not my flesh not my mind because sometimes your flesh your mind can can actually if you allow things to come there can bring doubt but you what's important is when your soul says the Lord is my ption [Applause] that's the anchor that's the stabilizer that's the one that pulls it all together as a matter of fact it's your soul that's the nature of the spirit it's the soul that God come to redeem he'll redeem the rest of it he's working right now to bring and subdue all things he will bring it all to a finish and you have that and I have that in my life that is a hope that rest within my heart within my life as it does in you that he will subdue all things unto himself and this hope as we have been looking at this hope it's what has been delivered to us a true expectation a trust that's been delivered to us by faith faith is the substance of things hoped for it's the substance right and this and by it the elders obtained a good report it's the same it's the love of God that brings you and I to a place to where not only can we bear All Things by his grace by his grace I don't have shoulders big enough to Bear it are you hearing me I don't have shoulders you don't either I don't have shoulders to Bear those things it requires something deeper than human love it requires God's love to be able to Bear it and to be able to believe all things that even when I can't see it when The Next Step I can't see it to be able to hope all things to trust in the Lord to even when let's say you come and you stand right here and we lay hands according to God's word according to God's word we lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that's his word and charity said I hopeth all things in other words we have done what the word has asked us to do if we confessed our sins the Bible said let them call for the Elders of the church let them confess all their sins anointing them with oil and the prayer the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man ath much is that the word of God then we can walk out of there it doesn't matter what I feel like it doesn't matter if I felt anything or not I hope it's all things come on friends I'm trusting in Him because you know what he gave the word amen that's right God didn't call us to walk by sight he called us to walk by faith sight is not just here it's every sense that even is contrary to that of Faith anything that speaks contrary to Faith let it go is that right now I want to draw from this scripture here tonight in in Romans 15 verse 13 oh my notice how Paul would write of this now the God of Hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that ye may abound in Hope through the power of the Holy Ghost so the god of a true expectation that expectation that is of a joyful and confident expectation of Eternal salvation the god of Hope fill you with all joy and peace in I'm glad that God he fills us with all joy and peace in believing I'm glad that there is one filling with many refilling because the very next part says that you may abound in hope in other words your expectation it doesn't waver but your expectation is to become greater your expectation in God's word that God is the god of his word he's not a man that he should lie every word of God is sure every word of God is amen our expectation abounds in the word of God why through the power of the Holy Ghost amen it's God lifting his word it's God raising the standard against the enemy and he's not raising it out here he's raising it in your life that's where the word is lifted to the standard to confront the enemy oh Hallelujah this is how Paul would write of this in first Timothy 1:1 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the Commandment of God Our Savior and Lord Jesus Christ which is our hope so our hope is not a word a paragraph but our hope is a person amen now I want you to think of this let me read this out of Titus chap 1 verse one I love this oh my Paul a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of God's elect and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness in Hope of eternal life which God that cannot lie promise before the world begin notice where Paul is taking us back to not to the beginning but before the beginning in the mind of God amen amen where our hope that's where our hope takes hold that's where the anchor is is to know that before there ever was atom dust or molecule before the devil was ever I was already you were already we were already Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah it was already settled your destiny my destiny was already settled this is how God address job with the present trial he was in he took job back to that hope he said where was you when the sons of God shouted for Joy Rejoice where were you at job and the morning stars were singing where were you job you know why cuz if he can get job connected back there where he was and to see that then job could look even at the trial and the circumstance that he was in and it breathed the whole into his life he already had a hope in his soul but job could stand right there and he could say I know my redeemer live amen the Lamb's blood that was shed and when his name was put on the book my name was put on it in the same time because I am identified in the character of Christ being revealed in this generation when his name is revealed I don't have my my own name we respond to his name because that's what we're in he called their name Adam we come under the name of Jesus Christ yeah we've had our other character yeah we've lived under that other character but he never came to redeem the Fallen character he came to raise up that character that was there on the inside the whole time that so good in Hope of eternal life expectation of eternal life which God that cannot lie promised before the world begin but hath oh I love this but hath in due times manifested his word through preaching which is committed unto me according to the Commandment of God our savior I'm going to I'm going to read this in the Amplified I about got lost on this one I'm going to read this on the Amplified so I won't have to break apart these words but I want you to listen this Paul a bonder servant of God and an apostle a special messenger of Jesus Christ the Messiah to stimulate and promote the faith of God's chosen ones and to lead them on to Accurate discernment and recognition of and acquaintance with the truth which belongs to and harmonizes with and tends to Godliness you say what does this word do this word that God has ordained to the faith of God's chosen elect which lends that to truth or godliness truth that lends to Godliness you say what what is it all saying it's saying that God in His Grace has sent forth his word in this hour and you have come in harmony with the music sheet the symphony that's being played out that part in this hour God has sent a word in this hour we've not been stirred up by man because if we got to we always got to have that man to stir us up Pump us up prod us up God's not doing that he never has use man in that way God comes by his word it's by his word being revealed that stimulates the people come on Church it ain't the music music is wonderful I believe in music it ain't the man I don't care how Dynamic he is or how much he stands here it ain't the man that'll do that it takes a revelation of Jesus Christ to stimulate your heart you say what do you mean if it takes a man it'll always take a man we got to have our certain man we got to have this certain preacher we got to have this certain one God has never made it that man is depending on man the prophet said you get too much confidence in a man he said watch God will let that man his Humanity will be shown why to get your faith back where it belongs come on Church oh man this this bride is not being led in a Rapture by man she's been LED in Rapture by the angel of the Lord himself the pillar of fire Hallelujah sometimes you might feel alone but let me tell you you're not alone my my my my look at the is resting in the hope of eternal life which ever ever the ever truthful God who cannot deceive promised before the ages of time began and now in his own appointed time he has made manifest made known his word and revealed it as his message through the preaching entrusted to me by command of God our savior Hey listen let me just say it like this brother BR you can look at many and there is different things that you can catch where people will talk about brother bram's Ministry they'll talk about the signs they'll talk about the Wonders but the prophet would say it like this in voice of the sign he said if they can see those scriptural signs remember what voice is following that sign if that voice is the same old Trend that did not come from God to bring a Revival is that right but notice the prophet would say like this he said if God he sends a word and people can recognize he said oh the signs and the Wonders being done can't they recognize Malachi's voice also being car being spoken out through the word that's being fulfilled I I say it in this way not not throwing anybody else off because nobody can help be what they are but you and I that by God's grace there is a part that will lays Within You and I that this message is more than signs and wonders it was more than just what was done on the platform we recognize and catch who it was that was in our midst and not only who it was but we see ourselves in the book to where that the book has been open to you and I and we recognize ourselves as Sons and Daughters of God that's what this message come to do it came to bring us to where that our hope is in the Lord and that the soul can say my portion is the Lord sayith my soul this is why that it means something to you this is why over and over as the prophet would say that ASE being predestinated you can't help but see it he would say oh God flash across this Lord he said all I can do is preach the word he said and when I preach the word he said God it's you flashing the light across the seeds if there's a seed there it'll catch it stay with me now it might take a little bit of time but just because time goes on there's not diminish there's not seed so what are you saying don't write nobody off don't write nobody off let me tell you something you say brother Samuel let's just let's just take it what brother BR said if I prayed he said for 10,000 people tonight on the platform he said and every one of them died tomorrow morning I would be right back on the platform tomorrow night praying for the next 10,000 how can he say that because he's trusting in God in his [Applause] word understand that sometimes there's things that don't go the way that we would like it to go or or would like to see it happen a desire to see every one of those people healed but it doesn't take away from God's word come on can we preach now sometimes when we don't see things maybe happening the way that we think they ought to happen we're ready to look around and blame somebody else and try to find blame that's good but you see that don't do that that that what that does that suppresses there being any hope in our life remember how brother Steven was bringing that well how the Lord was bringing that at the end we want to remain clear channels unto God when there's things that don't happen the way that we think it ought to happen say Lord we're looking at our lives as channels that are available and open unto you Lord yes oh my God help us notice this hope that has been delivered to us Paul would would speak of this hope in the book of Colossians as the riches The Riches of the glory of this mystery being Christ in you the hope of glory the expectation it's him in us that gives us a true expectation is that right now notice Galatians 5:5 for we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith through the spirit not because of what we have done but because what the spirit has done and is working in our lives through the spirit we wait for the expectation of righteousness by faith faith has handed into our lives and expectation this is why right out of this service tonight that no matter what your need is you should come with you know come with an expectation how do I come with an expectation be praying before you get here even praying while you're driving in the car praying while you're sitting right there while the word is coming forth Lord Jesus you know Lord I need a word from you Lord God I need a touch from you tonight Lord I need a word to come down my way Lord I'm coming here tonight I pulled up underneath your table if you don't give me a whole loath I will take a crumb Lord because I know where that crumb come from it come from the loaf and if I'll take the crumb oh I'm not ashamed to be a crumb Seeker the prophet said it like this in perseverance 1964 he said are you afraid to be a crumb Seeker he said oh if you can just take a crumb remember it has within it the same qualities that are in that loaf of bread he said maybe God will give you a crumb and you've got a promise and you'll take that promise you will begin to cherish that promise you will begin to water that promise and begin to thank God for that promise he said that's a real crumb Seeker that says Lord oh I will take the crumbs that fall from your table I'm not here to demand anything from you I'm just here because I know and I am convinced that this word is the truth I'm convinced that I am a believer I am sure that the Holy Ghost is still real still alive I'm ass sure that healing belongs to me Deliverance belongs to me and I'm here to get my crumb if you give me a slice I'll take it if you give me a loaf I'll take it but if all you lets fall a crumb I'm going to take that amen thank you Lord watch how the prophet says it like this in the message thy house he said our heavenly father we're so glad for Jesus Christ Our Lord who saved our souls from a life of sin and has made us the citizens of his kingdom by his grace we are saved and that not by oursel or by our works but by his Mercy we are saved and we're so glad of that we know that someday we'll see him for we'll have a body like his own body and we'll see him as he is at this time yet we do not know how that will take place but it's not for us to know we'll only look forward to it by faith and the whole walk is Faith Hallelujah so good hopeth all things trusting notice here we have this this anchor this anchor that entereth within the veil this anchor that we have this hope that we have in Jesus Christ when when he has come and his word has look look he's already confirmed his word remember Paul said that he he not only made the promise but he there in Genesis 22 he swore by himself he not only had promised the word but now he stepped forward by two immutable things he spoke the word and then he swore by himself cuz there was nobody greater to swear by you know what God was committing himself to his word two immutable things and now that same God what he promised he has confirmed by his word with the coming of of the Holy Spirit and sealing that in our hearts to where there is an anchor that same hope we have as an anchor that enters within the veil you ever think about what an anchor does man I know there's Boatman in here you had you put down an anchor you do not see where that anchor glasp or grasp but there is a reality that that anchor no matter what waves no matter what Storms Come that boat or that vessel is held right in place this is why that no matter when a doctor's report comes or a situation arises and it could try you know to come against you it could try to move upon your mind fear could try to come in but this is where the scripture or the song I pray God helps me to get it right my hope is built on nothing less than Jesus blood and righteousness when all around my soul gives way then he alone is my hope hand stay you got an anchor that within the veil and the doctor said this is what your expectation is but we've got an expectation that looks beyond that it's an expectation in the veil it's an expectation that said whosoever believeth in me shall never die we've got an expectation that we have already passed from Death unto life we've got an expectation by the Forerunner who said by my stripes ye are already healed and expectation I'm the Lord that Healers all thine diseases that is the anchor I'm tied to it you and the word are not two separate things there's an anchor you're yoked with this word within the [Music] veil within the veil sure we feel the waves sure we feel the waves sure there's things that can come mind battles sure there's thoughts that can come but there's an anchor it's a hope it's the expectation I I am trusting in the Lord tell me how he's going to get you out of it I don't know how he's going to do it but I know it'll be by his [Applause] word that's right that's real trust in the Lord hallelujah I want you to think of this in Romans 8 oh my let me try to get get down here for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God this is why all the groaning Hey listen the birds and the the Earth itself the volcanoes the earthquakes the they're waiting for the sons of God they're longing for the sons of God to come back in to control and manifestation God gives a little foretaste I said God gives a little foretaste even right now that's right hallelujah hallelujah there's a little foraste working in your life right now you and I this body is made up of elements of the earth and God has given you a greater power and authority on the inside as a son and daughter of God by the new birth that you now no longer are moved about by the prince of power of the air but now here you are as a manifested Son of God living in this Mortal body and when your mortal body wants to tell you something you're the one who stands there with jurisdiction and authority and said get out of my way Mountain get out of my way mountain when complexes want to stand there and say but that get out of my way Mountain you know what you're doing you're exercising your Authority it ain't going to diminish it's only going to increase from now to the change of the body and then into the Millennium hallah oh friends that's what this word come to do it in it gave you and I an authorization to live as Sons and Daughters of God you don't got to ask the devil you don't got to ask mom and daddy you don't got to ask the pastor God himself is the final voice of authority the amen has spoken and called you to live as a manifested Son of God your expectation is in him how's it going to be that's not for you to figure out hallelujah hallelujah when that word drops down when that word is settled down there and there's things sometimes that come across your lips and you think where did that come from I'll tell you where it come from it came from the portals of Glory it sovereignly moves down and there's an expression out of your lips you want to know how Isaiah felt when he said behold a virgin shall conceive that's exactly how he felt sometimes we wonder how did that come out but what it was inspiration dropped down yes sir Hallelujah Lord have mercy Romans 8:20 for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly right but to re but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in Hope or of this expectation God has given you and I an expectation he made a way remember he could not make Adam and Eve willfully sin put them on free moral agency God knew had knowledge of what the choice and what they would be remember but when they made that choice it did not hinder God whatsoever that's right as a matter of fact like the great Diamond inside of this great Diamond was every attribute if there had never been a fall there would have never been need of the attribute of Savior if there had never been a fall it would never been a need for an attribute of Redeemer a deliverer so forth this is why the prophet could say in the church ages he said it was the fall itself that gave him reason and purpose of being Hallelujah I'll tell you right now tonight I'm sitting here tonight and even the needs in my life and your life it gives him reason and purpose of being and let me just say it like this I love how the prophet lays it out he said many times he said it's preached as though that once he saves us he loses interest in us he said but that is not the case whatsoever he's walking in the midst of the golden candlesticks a matter of fact he said he is the sustainer of his new creation he is actually governing even in the Affairs of man right now he's watching over us my watch's this because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God God aren't you glad for those little for tastes right now aren't you glad those for tastes that spills over in a service or we're in prayer or maybe you're rid in your car and you get that little that little foretaste that spills over my you just feel so liberated I mean you don't need autopilot right then I mean you you're you're right there driving along maybe you're walking down the store maybe you're laying in your bed maybe you're right here in church maybe you're praying in your closet but my how those four tastes of Glory will just spill over you say why would God do that that to encourage you and I he knows we need time from time we need Divine encouragement and God knows just how it to give you and I that encouragement I'm grateful for that aren't you it makes us appreciate it so that it don't become common to us Lord verse 22 we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to Wi the Redemption of our body what has brought this groaning now this groaning is not for the newest style this groaning is not for the newest AI technology this groaning is not for you know it's nothing wrong friends with having plans in life even young people nothing wrong with having plans but just just be sure that like James if the Lord Wills that it's always place that of all the plans that I have but Lord if you see fit to interrupt them yes then give me the grace to walk through that Interruption and to accept it is that right give me the grace in my Humanity Lord because right here in my soul I want your will more than anything else sometimes my flesh will think things are the will of God this will be so perfect but the soul itself that's who I want to give the right away I want that soul to have the right away because my flesh can lie to me it's only limited to these senses but we as children of God are not called to walk by these senses we are called to walk by that super sense that sense of faith and you know what will always accompany faith it will always be the dove of the holy spirit that will accompany Faith it'll give you perfect peace and perfect rest my Lord Jesus we're looking for that Redemption of the body that's what we're looking for I don't know about you but every pain and whatever more there's you know I know I'm only 48 years old I'm just a young guy right now but sometimes there's certain things right now that I'm beginning to understand what the older one said sometimes oh I you know took a little bit to to get up this morning had to stretch and had to do this you know before I I never knew what that meant I never knew what some of those things meant of where you stand up and you got to wait for everything to catch up you might say you're only 48 years old well you need to pray for me a whole lot more then hallelujah cuz I I don't want walk around five gallon buckets of arthritis cream but you understand there's things that we and ourselves we we we we look at them my my Lord what's happening but you know what God allows that to happen even sickness that comes in our way you know when sickness comes your way my goodness you almost forget what it's like to feel good right I mean we appreciate all the Pamper and the chicken noodle soup and all that stuff but you forget what it feels like you and yet there's a part of it I want to get Beyond this I want to get back to that oh my aren't you glad that there's something inside of you there's a longing inside of you to get back to that reality oh friends you and I would never have known where to look but God came and found you and I we are part of this Redemption and God has put that expectation in your heart in my heart I'll tell you if you don't have that hope tonight I'd settle it right here tonight and say God I want that expectation right here tonight Lord for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope so if you see something if you see it then you're no longer expecting it right because you see it right for what a man seeth why does he yet hope for it if he sees it he's no longer expecting it but if we hope for that we see not then we do with patience wait for it I tell you that's a paradox this guy's impatient this first birth is the result of impatience Pride not waiting on God that's right that's good come on is this guy look look how many times there in scripture they that wait on the Lord David would even have David would have personal conversations they probably thought David man this guy talking to himself no David knew what he was doing my soul waiteth on the Lord my soul why are thou disquieted within me my soul why are thou cast down David understood the Realms of his Tabernacle are you with me he understood that oh my friends you see God brings you and I that's what this message come to reveal even to you and I who the real son and daughter of God is this like we said last week this is only the screen that allows the real son and daughter of God to be expressed upon sometimes though our feelings we make our feelings as though that's the ultimate and if we make our feelings the ultimate it'll show come on we've all been there and we're all going to have to battle with that and subdue that but let I'm looking at Overcomers right here you might not think that that's a very big thing but it is a great big thing in this hour for a people of God to subdue and subject their own feelings when they stand face to face with God's word to be able to stand there and say my feelings they might be ever so real but God's word I place it above my feelings is that right God is establish listen friends god holds his word as David said thou has manifested Thy word above thy name you see because God knows if he don't keep his word he doesn't keep his name but his name is tied to faithfulness his name is tied to merciful his compassions fail not why cuz he keeps his word god God's never ever ever been indebted to nobody for any word he's never had to send out an IOU he's never had an overdrafted promise but God's promises are just as sure yay and amen tonight glory be to God Jeremiah knew this expectation that's why he could say the Lord is my portion saith my soul therefore my hope is in the Lord you know God Jeremiah his message as he was expressing I I don't have time to go through all the scriptures here tonight but Jeremiah over and over he said oh they that look up under the hills and waiting for all these things truly their hope is in vain but oh Our Hope Israel is of the Lord he is our hope he is our Salvation in the midst of judgment in the midst of judgment God God gave a message of mercy and God look look here when Jeremiah this is being expressed in Lamentations Jeremiah had a witness and it wasn't just something that was spoken but God not only revealed his word but he vindicates it and Jeremiah was instructed by God to go and buy the partial of land that belongeth to thine uncle and I want you to make that that that would be contained I want an open Declaration of the sell and I want one also to be sealed up and put in an earn vessel why would that be because whoever tampers with the open one it don't mean this it don't say this the property lines are here they can do all of that they can tamper with this but when that which was sealed up is broken it has within it the original boundaries it has within it the original Glory it has within it all the original promises come on that's just like your life Satan has wanted to say a lot of things about your life but when God comes and breaks the seal on your life it reveals you are always a son and daughter of God that's why Rahab could sat on the walls that were doomed for defeat but she had an expectation of Victory why she had been lifted her head had been lifted above her enemies I'd like to preach on that with Jeremiah but he had an expectation we're coming back cuz God said we're going to possess these lands [Applause] again Hallelujah let me tell you something this Earth is a redeemable attribute of God it's already it's already had its water baptism come on now the blood has been spilled upon it at Calvary and sanctification is going to work let me tell you it's going to move on out even right there in the Millennium to where the knowledge of the Lord shall fill the Earth land sea and sky and then it's going to receive its baptism by fire the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then that future home is going to set [Music] down you think she's beautiful now in some places you wait till she gets back under the control of Sons and Daughters of [Applause] God hey look look at your life look what your life is now look what it was look what it is now look what it is now under the control of the son of righteousness one time we were prickers and stickers and cactuses but now the desert is blossoming like a rose where they said there's no water God said I'll show you he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of riving water out of deserts the waters shall weep and flow brother this ain't just speaking of them it's speaking of your life right now hallu my wish I had time on that prise Lord Paul said it like this picked it up from Isaiah in Romans 9:29 except the Lord of Sabio had left us a seed we had been as Sodom and and gamorra right but God left us a promise let me tell you listen friends I hope you understand what I'm saying it's filled with promises yes it is there there every promise in the book let me tell you every promise in the book is on the line it's right here there's no promise there's no page no portion there's not even two or three words that's been ripped out the God who made the promise is a promise keeping God but all it takes is one promise you might just have it seem like one promise but God has given that promise and except God had left us a seed we had been like Sodom and gomorra but God left a promise I want you to look at this a moment some weeks ago when we started dealing with this on hope this is the scripture the lord gave me this portion of where remember Joseph is down there they've had meetings with Joseph already they've had where their money was returned they've now went and they've brought the little one Benjamin and as Benjamin has come back remember it was Judah that stepped forward and Judah told Daddy he said I will lay my life on the line that he will come back to you safely is that right you see Judah rising up I will lay my life on the line let's look at this now therefore when I come to thy servant my father father and the lad being all with us remember when they found they planted the cup in Benjamin sack and then they took the cup said whoever's cup my cup is in he's the one will will stay with me is that right amen Benjamin's going to take the cup of Salvation notice this and the lad be not with us seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's Life his life is bound up who's speaking here Judah it shall come to pass when he seeth that the lad is not with us he's talking about when he get home if Benjamin's not with him then he's going to die thy servant shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the Grave for thy servant became shity for the lad unto my father saying if I bring him not unto thee then I shall bear the blame to my father forever let me tell you this isn't just a word about Benjamin this is God committed to his word if God doesn't fulfill his word if God doesn't stand for his own word this is why in this hour a lamb has stood up this is why in this hour in Daniel 12 Michael stood up it's God standing up for his word amen God raising his hands in the heaven he swore by himself he is Charity listen the Holy Spirit coming to your life is the Assurance it's god making sure to bring you and I to the expected end the Holy Spirit dealing with your life is here to bring you to a fully manifested son and daughter of God it's a spirit of God to bring conviction it's a spirit of God that leads you to repentance it's the spirit of God that sanctifies you and fills you with the Holy Ghost and matures you you are his workmanship Hallelujah is good that's why brother brand could say God's own life sixfold purpose of Daniel God's own life is bound with Israel he's married to her he says oh if the Lord willing will get into it he's married to Israel his life is bound to her just as I'm bound to Mrs brandham back there my wife you're bound to your wife your life is wrapped in it and God is married to Israel can I add just a little bit more let's take this promise believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thy and thy house shall be saved now sometimes listen sometimes you know listen listen friends I hey I'm telling you I'm not here I'm not here as a hope extractor I don't know if that makes sense or not it makes sense to you I'm not here to extract hope to where when you leave out of here oh I don't have no hope no I'm not here for that right I because I'm called to preach this gospel and this gospel is to bring a Living Hope This gospel is to encourage you to take what belongs to you it encourages you that you stand as a son and daughter of God in your own house in your own life and a Dominion this word comes to where it don't matter what shape the life is Hope Brother Sam you don't know how you don't know how bad this life is let me tell you something there ain't no hope out there but there is hope in the Lord if there's one place there's hope that's in the father's house if there's one place there's hope and that's in the word of God you might say my life might be twisted up it'd be easier to untangle a fishing line but I'm going to tell you it is nothing too hard for the Lord Jesus God knows how to get right down and move right down his grace is sufficient he'll take a life that maybe everybody else his railroad off and he will make a paradox out of that life by his Redeeming Grace you say how can you speak like that cuz my hope is in the Lord I know what he did for me and what he did for me he'll do it for someone else that'll believe him that'll trust him when I say believe him or trusting just accept the grace The Winds of the holy spirit that moves in cuz that's what it did on my life thank you Lord Brother BR said if I'm praying by house that God will save these teenage children and I believe with all my heart he'll do it see that's the same way job's stood oh look at this kid how he's doing no look at this kid how he's doing I don't care what he's doing or what she's doing I still have put that child in the hand of almighty God me and my house shall be saved God knows right where they're [Applause] at brother Samuel all I can do right now is pray that's the greatest thing you can do oh because as you're praying it creates an expectation you start looking for it you start listening for change you start looking for text to come in different come on somebody prayer because you know what you're praying according to God's word you're not out of the will of God brother Samuel they're so far this way listen I don't care how far they are listen the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much it's not your strength or power that turns them around it's the prayer of the Saints that's going out it's the Holy Spirit the token with that prayer that goes to deal with their life and turn their heart around I don't care whether it's a child whether it's a loved one whether it's a [Applause] spouse hey let me tell you something God ain't frustrated God ain't sitting there saying woo it's hot my I tell you this I don't know how I'm going no you were put here for such a time as this God breathes a word in your life to give you strength and encouragement brother Bram said even though I pass on before they do somehow before they leave here God will twist them right down on the trail somewhow or another he'll make it so miserable for them till they have to do it and brother Bram said that's the way I believe it that's the way I believe itj that's the way you believe it I could go on and read it brother BR says I've seen many come to the altar he said and what it was their mother's already gone on their daddy already gone on he said but it was a prayer being answered right there just because Mom and Daddy passes on don't mean the prayers ain't going to be answered remember your prayers you prayed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they're stored in a vial yes Hallelujah come on they're not just wandering way out there they're in a vow as a matter of fact the prophet when he called out a certain sister he said I hear you in a land called prayer Hallelujah I I hear you you're beside your bed and you're praying about this let me tell you it ain't something far out there it's moving through here like these waves are moving like the waves of the cell signal it's in a land called prayer there in one of your prayers it may have it might have felt like it hit the ceiling and came down to the floor and didn't go anywhere but there when you've stood there ain't about your feelings but when you have asked in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ let me tell you God is there to make good on the prayers of his people they get stored up about the time you say about the time you can look and say it don't seem like there ain't a convicting bone in their body it don't seem like anything but you let them prayers start being poured out you let the spirit of God start to deal with their life God knows right where they're at them prayers might be poured out when they're in a business meeting them prayers might be poured out when they might be driving down the WR God knows how to get their attention my my my my and we're looking for that promise let me read this in closing 1 John 3:2 beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that look at this we know that when he shall here we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is hallelujah we have that assurance that when he appears we'll see him but Samuel how can I see how can I have that Assurance do you see him now see when you when you see him now it makes you ready for that coming then as you see him now in the coming of his word in due time where he is coming to stimulate your faith coming to stir your heart coming to bring you into harmony with the word if you just you just yield with it don't don't argue about the music sheet just just enter right into it yes Lord be it unto me according to Thy word if he deals with things on the music sheet in front of you and it's dealing with your life amen Lord be it unto me you realize the authority of saying Amen to the word of God don't let the devil push you back and put fear upon you but stand right there and say Amen to the word of God brother there a power and authority you can be sitting right here tonight but as that word comes by and you say Amen to that word there is a power and an authority that's released in your life things that you walked in here and said how will I get Beyond but when you say Amen to the word of God not Amen to my feelings Amen to my thoughts but Amen to the word of God so be it and you'll walk out of here and you'll be the head over that thing that is so true Hallelujah that's the authority Friends of the word of God we're standing as children of God and every man every man that haveth this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure I tell you we are not ordained for failure Paul said it like this he admonished us put on the breastplate of faith and love and the hope the helmet the hope of Salvation we are not appointed to wrath we are not appointed to that of the of of that of of the Judgment we are appointed to Salvation we are appointed to Deliverance are you with me this is what we so in other words this word this word to a real believer it's not a word of Doom and Gloom it's a word that lifts us it's a word that we can begin to see we begin to look at circumstances cuz I know everybody every one of us at times we've been in trials and felt like when is this trial ever going to end when is this test ever going to our flesh will say that come on now our flesh will say this but we recognize we've not this is not our destiny this test or this trial it's not our destiny it's just a point that I'm passing through and God has appointed me to Salvation I am an overcomer I am a Victorious One my hope is in the Lord think about how the Lord Jesus stood there and said destroy right this Temple and in three days I'll raise it up again they thought he was talking about that Temple he wasn't he had said before that I have power to lay my life down power to take it up again he said in his word in Psalms 16 where David come under the inspiration I have set the lord always before me therefore he is at my right hand I shall not be moved Hallelujah therefore my heart is glad you see when he becomes the strength of your life amen when he's at your right hand when he's the strength of your life when are you understanding me tonight when he's the one that's giving you courage to take a promise you might you might say brother Samuel I I'm one in the Holy Ghost he is now is being set before you he is the strength Giver of your life he's the one that's stimulating you he's the one that's encouraging you in the promise that belongs to you this is why you have set I have set the lord always before me my thought says that nope but God said this my feelings said nope God said this he is at my right hand he's the one I'm holding to his promise and I'm going to confess that promise might be here but I'm going to confess it till it drops from here down here I'm going to stand on that word because he made a promise and he cannot lie he made that promise before the foundation of the world and there's something that's energizing my soul say Amen to the word of God my hope is in the [Applause] [Music] Lord and my Glory rejoiceth My Flesh also shall Rest In Hope thank you Father thou will not leave my soul in Hell neither wil thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption brother Aaron let's just read it like this thou will not leave my soul in Satan's Eden let's read it like that brother Bill thou will not leave my soul in Satan's Eden thou will not leave me defeated thou will not leave me cast down we have received a victory a a a victory a Victorious word from a living God let me read this quote and I will close it's just so good it's good yes sir in the message thy house brother BR said he was behind talking about the Lord Jesus he was behind to barricade of scripture so if there's things that you're looking on expectations in your life this this puts it in perspective why couldn't he raise before the third day he was behind a barricade of scriptures remember my expectation is from him he reveals first to his servants the prophets what he's going to do and then he does it yes and you know how he does it in you in me how did God cross over into the promised land the prophet said he crossed over into the promised land in them he couldn't rise for three days and his Spirit was back up here in the presence of God after three days that barricade was taken down because the scripture was fulfilled and his Spirit Went to went to the and the soul went to the body and he rose up he said before he died I have power to lay my life down I have power to take it up again now think of it every one of look at this so powerful every one of you in here as far as I know tonight as Christians look the thing that is in you now the spirit that is in you now is the same spirit that will raise you up you have power to lay your life down and you're doing it right now for Christ and then you'll have power to take it up again you think it ain't powerful to be able to lay down a grudge be able to lay down bitterness I'm telling you that ain't your human strength it ain't my human strength that's a power that lays within you that's right and because of that what are you you have that hope in you purify himself even as he is pure he reveals himself to you and I and there's an amen from within so be it Lord and what is it it's power to lay my life down what is it he makes real there's no value to this this is hindering me from working it's hindering from me and working your life and our whole objective and motive is wrapped in him you love him oh my we have power to lay it down power to pick it up again oh my Hallelujah I wish I could read the rest of the quote but I'm not I'm not going to well maybe live for a portion of it [Laughter] this is so good this is this is where last week I was really I was so inspired I couldn't get to this brother BR said you see when that scripture is fulfilled talking about those that's went on beyond the curtain of time and then the Rapture coming on he said then in paragraph 137 that Spirit descends right down straight under the altar there and takes up that soul that Soul goes right down and picks up the body and there you are raised up again think of it the holy spirit that is right in this building tonight the holy spirit that is right here in my heart will raise me up at the last day the holy spirit that is in me now will see to it the holy spirit that is in me now will see to it you talking about greater is he that's in you when when you felt like this but there's something in you keeps keeps pushing you it keeps pushing you there's something in you it just keeps moving you Hallelujah glory be to God in the highest the Holy Spirit that's in me now will see to it that I have a young Immortal body what is that that's Judah wow shity he is making his word sure the Holy Spirit that's in you will see that the great hairs will fade away I'll get mine back I got some gray here but I'll get these back we'll see that the great hairs will fade away in whatever it is and the old age if you're so old and whiskers down and walking like that it don't make one a difference that same Holy Spirit in you will just snap you right back at that day just to a young man and a woman that's the Bible the spirit in us right now right now not the one that will come the one that's in us now it's God in you you can raise yourself up why can't I do it now because there's scripture holding you've got to wait till the [Music] [Applause] Rapture and so am the god of Hope fill you with all joy and peace believing that your hope abound through the power of the Holy Ghost every experience God brings you through it's a greater expectation every every word of Revelation working in your life every every sweep of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah every word that inspires you heart heart oh Lord I I want to go home right now there scripture holding scripture holding that's why brother BR says you know he says there's a law he talks about this in this message thy house as well as in perfect Faith he said there's a law that that harnesses it else you would speak a world and go live on it is that right but but it's a scripture holding Lord Lord why why can this but see this is where we as Believers wait I'm waiting for he shall change these vile bodies it won't be another day of Advil won't be another day of of of arthritis cream there won't be another day of a pain medicine there won't there won't be another sickness there won't be another evil thought there won't be another disease Lord brother and sister you say what are you talking about Brother Sam I'm talking about the power of the Holy Ghost inside of your life life the same resurrection power that raised you from death unto life the same sweep of the resurrection power that moves over your life and brings you from sickness to health the same God that rids your life of cancer and other diseases the same God that breaks depression is the same God one of these days will'll change these vile bodies that final sweep we'll see our loved ones appear before us and then we'll know our change is on the way and you know what that won't be anything new to you because you've been used to the word being presented to you and as a Believer when the word comes across your pathway you expect change I'm going to go ahead and confess it I'm going to go ahead and call it mine I'm going to going to go ahead and call Deliverance mine I'm going to go ahead and call call the Holy Ghost M I'm going to go ahead and call Healing mine I'm going to go ahead and call Salvation M why as Believers we see the word made manifest and it scares us to ask and move upon his [Music] promise let me tell you friends God the only thing that God ask for you and I is to believe him that is so good yes and when we believe him that's what sets us in motion that's what sets a heart in motion to repent that's what sets a heart in motion to surrender their all this is it's God moving and releasing to us what we need in order to believe let me tell you God's in control he's not lost control he's in control of this bride he's in control of your life he's in control of your life your home if you let him be if you say Lord be the be the center of my life Lord be the center of it all Lord be the center of my home Lord be the wheel in the middle of the wheel Lord God lord be the influencer of my life Lord whosoever hath his hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure you love him tonight amen if you don't have this hope it'd be this is a wonderful time to let it just be settled tonight brother Samuel what do I have to do believe his word believe what he has said unto you amen amen because the word itself if you receive that word listen it's just like ice cubes that drop into a water when you receive the word it displaces unbelief Faith the word listen to me the word being preached by the spirit of God cast out Devils that's why when you leave out of here you feel lighter de they might have been out here maybe they were in here you know it don't matter the word goes after the devil to cast him out Hallelujah that ain't brother Samuel doing that that's him doing that Hallelujah this ain't a flesh and blood Affair it's God himself when the enemy wants to come in here and he wants to try to get in your mind get up your life you know what he's trying to do he's trying to make a challenge against against the Holy Spirit but the holy spirit will always take up the challenge of the devil because he's already defeated him at every turn we are disputing with a defeated Devil he's already defeated our lord Jesus already conquered him I tell you you believe that tonight no matter what your need is in your life I challenge you to accept it and stand to your feet and say I take that word I take that promise I take healing in my life I take Deliverance in my life I accept the Holy Ghost I accept God's grace [Applause] Hallelujah the god of Hope Hallelujah glory be to God in the [Music] highest hallelujah we're not beside oursel we know right where we're standing we're standing

looking for even that little bit of an Earnest that I've received right now I've received an Earnest word I've received an earnest deposit that I can expect God to fulfill his word and in the meantime I'm going to take this crumb I'm going to rejoice in hope I am going to thank and praise almighty God because the same God who supplied the crumb he himself is the bread of life and he said if we ask him for bread would he give us a stone that is so yes sir he said how much more we who are evil know how to give good gifts how much more your heavenly father if you ask him for the Holy Ghost will he
