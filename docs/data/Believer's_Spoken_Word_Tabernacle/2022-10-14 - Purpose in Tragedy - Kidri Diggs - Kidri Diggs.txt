God the family of God you know and uh certainly appreciate brother Sammy man wonderful brother and friend in the Lord amen but most of all what we have in common is the Lord Jesus Christ never let the devil make that comment we're here because of the Lord Jesus Christ not because of personalities of people but the Lord Jesus Christ amen let's just pray and we'll get right into the word of God tonight if you have a need you can acknowledge to the Lord by uplifted hands but he knows all things Lord Jesus father we're here tonight Lord on the merits of your grace and your mercy Lord knowing that there's nothing that we have done Lord is all your choosing it's all your election and predestination Upon Our Lives Lord the good times the bad times father is all about you father and Lord help our attitudes Lord Jesus and we'll look at things through the right eye through the right lens of to know father that you're in control of each and every thing Lord God we just pray father for your help Lord God will look towards the Hills from which cometh our help but we know our help coming from the Lord and Lord as you see those hands Lord and you see that need or that desire father we pray that it will be according to your perfect will yes Lord teach us not to want anything Lord that's not in your will father for Lord we know that if it's in your will it'll be done there's nothing the enemy can do to stop it father we pray for that need that uplifting loss Lord we pray to bless each and every heart each and every spirit and soul that is among us tonight father that the word would go out in power and demonstrations Lord to fulfill all that you've given unto us before the foundation of the world Lord a blessed Church Lord the pastor Lord all those connected to this ministry in the name of Jesus Christ we pray Lord and forgive us for our sins and trespasses Lord the things in our lives Lord that no one sees but you father keep us under your atoning blood that covers a multitude of sins Lord the things that has been the things that will be and even the things that are so right now in the name of Jesus Christ we pray church amen amen amen praise the Lord if you have your Bible let's turn to the Book of Ruth chapter one Ruth chapter one verse 1. I came to pass in the days when the judges rule that there was a famine in the land and a certain man of Bethlehem Judo when went to Sir John in a country of Moab and his wife he and his wife and his two sons in the name of in the name of the man was elimelech and the name of his wife Naomi and the name of his two sons Milani chalian ifronites of Bethlehem Judah and they came into the country of Moab and continued there and remember like eliminate Naomi's husband died and she was left and her two sons and they took them wives born of the women of Moab the name of one was offer and the name of the other was Ruth and they dwelt there among about 10 years and my life and Chilean died also but of the both of them and the women was left of her two sons and her husband I mean let's go to Psalms chapter 37. Psalms chapter 37. this is one of my favorite songs this song is packed amen With the blessings of God go back and read it sometimes it's packed but we're gonna pull out uh verse 23. Psalms 37 verse 23. the Bible says the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and He delighted in his way though he fall he shall not be uttered passed down for the Lord upholded him with his anger amen may the Lord blessing of his word you can have your seats church I believe that we are in the last days and you know the Bible speaks of perilous times you know there's there's a lot of things that the Bible talks about will be happening in the last days and tonight my subject is purpose in tragedy purpose in tragedy you know when we think of the word tragedy you know most of the time we think of her you know we we we think of discomfort or or or or we think of pain but if I could say it like this it took a tragedy for us to be here tonight it took the death to bury a resurrection to the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ which truly was a tragedy to kill an innocent man to kill a man who never did any wrong when they were men who murdered indeed all kind of other things and they went free oh what a tragedy right you know but it took that tragedy that the purpose of God will be fulfilled Hallelujah so church if we can look at our lives a little bit different we want to change the angle of Our Lives tonight because a lot of times we look at what we're going through and the first thing we say is oh the devil no the devil is not in control so I'm very careful about how I speak when I'm going through things now it took me a minute to get there but now I'm here so I don't look through the eyes of of of of of of of dysfunction I don't look through the eyes of depression I don't look through the eyes of disaster but I look through the eyes of purpose amen because with God Amen in everything there is a purpose because the public God said God hardly has a purpose in everything or he would be the author of confusion and God shall be off of confusion so if you look at your child right now there's a purpose you must say brother Jesus I lost this I lost that oh it was such a tragedy but it was a purpose before I go any further I know a brother in Canada his wife died of what of what the doctors say breast cancer and you know how we do we we stand and we pray and we believe and we call on God and we fast and we stand there and say Lord in your word you promised us healing but what if God don't ask but if he doesn't answer it's still for your good [Applause] Ness amen and you know this brother you know his wife ended up passing and I believe that they had kids and so forth and teenagers and young adults and when she passed you know it was it was such a tragedy the whole family was devastated the president's husband who was a God-fearing man a god-free God-fearing husband living in a God-fearing household and sometimes when things happen it looks like we're right where we're supposed to be in God so when things happening we begin to question Lord why is this happening I'm not silly I'm not doing anything wrong there is a purpose yeah [Applause] see who can understand the mind of God hallelujah his ways are not our ways his thoughts are not our faults so sometimes there's things in you that only a tragedy can bring out tonight [Applause] amen because we've been looking at the tragedy as pain all right we've been looking at the tragedy as a disaster but could it be God shapening us into something could it be God bringing something our way that only a tragedy could unlock and open up [Applause] hooray Hallelujah church and as his brother prayed and painted now his wife is passing he's on his his bad mourning and and wondering Lord why didn't you let my wife pass with this promise of healing I have and I'm sure most of us approach it like that when things when people don't get healed and different things happen and we'll be like God your word says by your stripes they're supposed to be healed we're supposed to be healed so why did it happen and his brother he cried out to God he prayed and he prayed and God came back with the answer oh after his wife was gone and God began to speak to him and tell him my son I had to take your wife because me healing her wouldn't have the effect on your children that her passing would and as she passed and went on to Glory those kids began to remember her life those kids begin to remember that God that hurt their mother was a God-fearing mother and they they begin to remember her love they began to remember how she taught them in the scriptures and everything and then they began to get closer and closer and closer to God what brought them closer it was a tragedy yeah and sometimes God will use the tragedy Hood to unlock the next step in your life holy and it took the death of losing a wife that his own kids Hollywood get closer to God God is smarter than us he's wiser than us so you know the best thing for us to do is not question God hold it but check out attitudes and say Lord hallelujah give me a mind to say that no matter what happens it Is Well with My Soul and church as as I begin to look at the start you know I begin to think about the word of God you know how God allows things to happen no explanation you ever thought about that most of the times when we go through things there's no explanation and as you go through it God will begin to unfold himself yes amen because every child every test is for the purpose of God reveals Hallelujah and unveiling amen as a Believer because the Bible says the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by God so what we have to look at is when we go through things or we fall into sin or whatever it is we can't say oh the devil made me do that so he did God alone because if I confess amen listen to me good if I confess it was the devil and the devil made me do it what I'm confessing is the devil has control over my life and I refuse to give him control [Applause] it looks like if I tell a lie I'm not gonna say the devil made me do it I say Lord I'm sorry oh I do something wrong I go to God and repent but I never say the devil made me do it because if the devil made me do it that means I act on a time I was his and I refused when God has given me a blood covering [Applause] the devil when God has come and revealed himself when God has come and touched my life I refuse to say the devil made me do no hit [Applause] the only Power he got is what you give him Hallelujah what we think about a tragedy and you know the scoffers in the world today that say if God was real why is all these things happen there's a purpose there's a purpose let's let's let's let's let's go into the word tragedy for a second the word tragedy is a dramatic composition often in verse dealing with a serious or somber thing typically that of a great person to staying through a flaw a character so sometimes Church the tragedy is so close to home people will look at the tragedy and they will make that a part of your character hmm but the tragedy and who you are are two different things but the tragedy into something greater you know when God and and when we look in the Bible and we look at we talk about the story of Job oh oh he lost his riches he lost his social status everybody on Facebook started to disclaim it everybody on Facebook's talking unlike him Hallelujah start to block him all these things he lost all his social status why because of the tragedy he was going through and look the tragedy was without proof of sin [Applause] so don't judge me about what I'm going through and these were his message believing friends judging him by the tragedy in his life whoa um oh before then he was a man of God but once he lost his social status you know once he started to lose friends on Instagram when nobody was when nobody would befriend him on Snapchat anymore and they began to block his Twitter and all these other different social events that they may have had in our day but I was gonna say it is they know in our day Hallelujah in our church look at it he lost his he lost he lost some of his wages the way to provide from his family no doubt was through his his substance his cattle and all his things but that began to die without explanation without explanation Hallelujah oh social status without explanations everything that job had that made him go Hallelujah it turned into a tragedy and everybody's looking at what he's going through and they're judging him by what he's going through oh church we could take a lesson from job yeah in church look when he's going through that look at it I want to show you something today that you could be going through something in your life and it's nothing simply more than just a bet between God and the devil well that's all it was it was a bet between God and the devil the devil says oh oh he's serving you because of this and that and all these things and God says you want to bet you won't fail and the BET what was the BET all about in the midst of his tragedy that he would curse God and God said no no he won't he's greater than what he's going through holy he's not identified by the time he's identified by the covering of the time Hallelujah job was not connected to his social status job was not connected to his children to his wife to his cattle to his money he was connected to that blood what are you connected to tonight what are you using to help you get through your trial because sometimes there may not be people to come around to help uplift you yeah let's look at the fall something that was so great in the beginning and look at where we are now when God created man man was what in the image of God just like him Adam was in every point every manner every England every job every ghetto just like God amen it is very image Adam couldn't be touched by the justice Lucifer the dragon whatever you want to call him he knew he couldn't come to Adam but in his mind he already had a plan he said you know what I'm going to produce a tragedy God feel some pain but what you think about something before you lay your life down to commit sin think about who's getting joy out of it first [Music] because Satan runs to God constantly accusing us and the day you decide to say hey I'm not living this way anymore Satan says oh oh yeah I think they're about to curse you God to your face but I don't know about you but in the casino or brother Dean's life every table in my casino is red Hallelujah every table is weak the devil will never win but he's playing Blackjack God always wins all right when he has the dice of my life rolling the dice they always fall on seven come on brother why because the dice in my life they're fixed they're waiting Hallelujah so always fall in my favor and I want you to believe the same thing the spiritual Casino in your life is six by God you can come over there with five dollars and still walk out with 500. why because it's fixed all right that's why we pay tithing Hallelujah because he said you do your bless if you don't you curse oh I can't believe brother Samuel in 2022 we have people still wrestling with paying taxes the Bible is clear if you do you're blessed if you don't you're going to live in a tragedy look Satan he gets kicked out of heaven and he comes down to earth and he says you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna mess up the whole thing I'm gonna make God pay that's his whole mindset he wants to give back to get back at God and the only way he know he can do it is messing with his wife like Samson said if you would have left my health alone I wouldn't be here messing with y'all and if you want to make God angry mess with his wife because she gave me touch honey she's Sanctified and put aside for God and His Hands alone so when Satan begins to mess with you he's messing with God's Pride prized possession I don't know about y'all heard but I'm wrapped up and I got a bow on me in God's eyes [Applause] Christmas gift imma give year round holy look Church let me read this now we we just take the fall you know God he said the prophet God said God would have been unjust to put elderly there create sin and and make them fall he said no he put them on free more ages where they would you would I would we would make our own decision listen he said let's go back to the beginning in the original physical creation as we know it today God made everything in pairs male and female there were two chickens roosting ahead there were two cattle cows and all right down the line but when it came to man there was only one who was it hmm created in God's image just like God talk like God Walk Like God Amen had the mannerisms of God Amen Adam knew he couldn't touch that right he could have made himself that way God did that and let me say this if you are anything in this spiritual life God did that that's right you know we got preachers and and different people in the world or uh in this world who think there's something because they know this message no God did that and wonderful God's election and calling you and showing you we would be in another denomination [Applause] it's Grace [Applause] that's why I'm not quick to move people right yeah or cast people down because everybody has to go through something he said every child of God must be tested hardly proven to be what that seed is inside and listen he says Adam has been made in the image of God he was the son of God and as a Son of God he could not be tempted and false boy I'm about to say something heavy now of God a daughter of God you cannot be tempted and false hold up all right amen oh I know some of you are reluctant to say Amen now because you feel like I fall every day but let's let's understand this this item was a spirit man we're not talking about the Flesh of Adam amen that's why that body was put in the flesh to be tempted amen so it's your flesh being tempted not your Adam yeah Hallelujah so sometimes we fall and we make mistakes that's not your seed being changed it's not your atom being changed it's your flesh tell you identifying Redemption that's why we go through these so we can appreciate Redemption it was not the atom that fell it was the Flash the sea remain the same that's why we don't have two Souls because God after Adam failed he never had to come and put that soul in another body all he had to do was put that body that atom in an atmosphere where he could recognize who he was again and he'd come back to himself he loses spiritual amnesia [Applause] Glory come on so what did God do because we are of that same Adam he had to put us in a body of death to experience tragedy listen as the Son of God he could not be tipped in the fall because remember the Bible says when you're tempted don't say you're being tempted of God Hallelujah the gene of God cannot be tempted yeah but these what are you saying the gene of God can't be changed and all temptation does hallelujah is to try to make it be something it's not hurry up and no matter who I was or what I was when I was in the club I still was the gene of God Hallelujah idea on the dance floor cleaner Shake It Up Hallelujah you know what I still had that Gene in me I still wasn't Adam if you was in the bar listening to your hokey talk and you had the seed of God that alcohol you were drinking couldn't change well I know some of y'all been saved all your life but for those of us who can recognize the tragedy of the sex coming alive there was a purpose in it God allowed us to experience tragedy in this flesh why so certain things in our spirit man could awaken floor listen oh my I love how the proper places he said as a Son of God he could not be tempted and fall that would be impossible uh what I want to do tonight I want to strip Satan from all this power because what we do is we look at what we're going through like oh my Lord God I'm so sorry I need to I need it your seed cannot be changed amen [Applause] what God is doing he's allowing you to experience the attributes of redemption through every test through every child it's an unfolding of God to you because he says to be tempted Hallelujah he said that would be impossible so God took a byproduct of man to cause the fall what was it Eve and where did Eve come from come from the what of Adam she didn't come from the spirit she came from that touch that rib honey that connection of Adam showing that she was not created in the very image of God but in the very image of me right therefore bring it for what so God allowed her to be created that way why so that we could experience death and child because Satan can come to Adam with why because he knew he would be the same one in heaven all right so he had to come to someone that would receive his words and we know the story of the fall and Satan says oh boy I got him oh he was once a God but look at him now doubt that look like a tragedy come on think about it Church he's walking out of the Garden of Eden with a remembrance of what it was like to tell creation to do what it did he's walking out Hallelujah with the remembrance of knowing what it's like to have fellowship with God daily and constantly Hallelujah in a stage of tragedy but look at it even that tragedy the fall had a purpose and Satan thought oh boy I got him I messed it up oh my I got my seated and God's standing there watching the whole thing and he's saying you dummy you dummy you are fulfilling my purpose and Satan after you your ignorance to usher in Redemption [Applause] amen Satan thought he was creating a tragedy but no he was Unlocking The Mystery of God's attributes oh yeah all right so every tragedy of the Fall was for a purpose what God had to allow somebody to be lost which was a tragedy to produce What A Savior which was what a purpose hey God did what he allowed Hallelujah us to be born in the body of death why so we could get sick which is what a tragedy to produce what a Healer Glory I hope you catch it in church oh God have purpose so what looked like a tragedy was really the plan of God just sitting there patient waiting and he's saying it is my okay say do what you do I need you to do what you do you're so smart go ahead finish it up go ahead and do your thing and God is saying we're almost there and as soon as even after I believe but took of the forbidden fruit parts of God begin to be unlocked don't know if we don't know that thing uh uh a picture of the Transformers those calls when they begin to change into something Hallelujah maybe they'd be in one position then they change it to another position but it's still the same thing Optimus Prime was a Freightliner all along but it took something to happen for him to stand up Mike and God will the Healer all along but it took a tragedy for that mystery of him to unlock and transform in our life God is the original chance all right [Applause] how old is gonna be I'm gonna I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna die I'm gonna mess up the whole world and God is sitting back saying no you're not gonna mess it up You're Gonna Save the whole world come on because when the whole world got lost that made God move into a savior all right holy when you and I it's by our bondage we recognize that he's a deliverer to those of us whoever smoke whoever drank and when God delivered us God delivered us [Applause] and took that tragedy for me to put that tar in my body to put all those things that smoking does all those elements that it does to experience that to realize what it means to be healthy what is it it's the grace of God Hallelujah and Satan wants to be sad because we're going through something no tonight we're gonna Rejoice we're going to rejoice in every time we don't rejoice in every tribulation why because there's a purpose in my life I have to experience the opposite of God to get the realness of God I'll keep proclaiming it he be fighting me in my finances earlier but my mindset has changed to Hallelujah in my life I'm still blessed Hallelujah because the Bible says hallelujah amen let the weak say I am what stroke how can the weeks and they're strong because weakness is only a perversion of what you really are what are you confessing oh my don't get nervous I'm about to close come on listen he says now he could not be just and make man fall see God's not going to make a servant he's going to let us make mistakes he's going to let us fall into certain things why what does that do that brings him closer can you imagine Hallelujah yourself not living with that man right there eternity [Applause] there's something about that connection Hallelujah but let me tell you something that connection was before the foundation of the world [Applause] there's a pastor inside there so what did he do he allows you to experience certain tragedies to get your hunger and for truth and that tragedy brought you where back here [Applause] so really God uses the tragedy to bring us back home Church but I like it she has three more agents we have the will and the right to decide and we'll even we'll even sometimes choose the wrong thing but let me say it like this God has to allow so when I made a mistake it wasn't just the devil having control of me no it was God allowing it Hollywood because of the son and daughter of God nothing can happen in your life except first it comes to God let's go back to Joe Hallelujah Satan came to church that day the Bible say the sons of God went to worship and the Bible says and Satan came also believe it or not the devil loves to come to church because he knows if I can get somebody to use I can hold up the anointing if I can get somebody to use I can cause a friction between the preacher and the people let me say this demo you got the wrong one today [Applause] your resistance doesn't back me up your resistance wants me to see you even more Freya Glory I will accept the challenge to get out of the way and let God use me now you can't and we know these things he can't be a savior unless something is lost oh it's a tragic anybody ever been lost okay well let's let's put it like this go back to what you was before you came into truth that's what it means to be done you guys are over a league I ain't never did this I ain't never did that I I've been a pretty good person nice if you if nobody never told you let me tell you now you are born indeed came into the world speaking live so therefore all of us need what a rebirth whether you feel like you never did anything or not you're born in a body of death oh my god listen he says now you can't be your savior unless something is lost you can't be a Healer unless something is sick these things had to be that way God made them thus so that he his great attributes could be displayed man let's understand what it means to be displayed do me a favor put um put um um Psalms 37. verse 23 up there on the street he can is that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by God what makes them righteous is that even in his failures he gets back up that's what makes him righteous I have been young and I'm old yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken even in my falling I have a promise that I'm not forsaken now remember he said that his attributes may be displayed you see that scripture that's what it means to be displayed right there in front of all of us that there's no confusion right there where all of us can see it and it's interpreted holy word forward and that's what God is doing with his attributes he's put them on display but there's no confusion listen yeah one thing I want you to realize seeing funny is a product of the Fall amen but we're gonna snatch all the power sin is not a creation so when you look at sin I'm about to say something now look at sin it doesn't even have a resting place because it doesn't have its own origin because it's not a creation it's a perversion Hallelujah this is the problem said there's never was such a thing as creation of sin that didn't go down good did it because we look at all of our failures and all the things we come up short no that's not a creation that's a perversion Hallelujah he said it's not a creation no sir sin is a perversion there's only one Creator that's God sin is righteousness perverted listen to that sin is righteousness so except you believe in perversion sin doesn't even live if you take the perversion out of it hallelujah it's not even real what is the LIE the truth where did the law come from the perversion of the truth so if you take the perversion out of it the LIE doesn't even exist catch me now I'm by the club I want you to catch me now hold it what is sickness a perversion of you but if you can get your thoughts to believe that you will heal sickness won't even exist why because it's a perversion of Truth if you learn to live in the element of Truth Darkness won't even exist Ence I got to say like the Pentecostal preacher y'all don't hear me I said y'all don't hear me I say yo don't hear me sin I said sin is a perversion foreign Hallelujah if you're living in the right place with God it doesn't even exist [Applause] s because it has no creation therefore he can never come back out of something and if it came had come back out of something that mean it doesn't have any origin without any originality it's just a lie [Applause] what is a Lie the truth misrepresented certainly what causes what curse word is God's blessings turned into curse words instead of a blessing sin is not a creation sin is a perversion so Satan could not create sin he only perverted what God created you know what the prophet said Satan can't even create his own tools whoa Hallelujah Glory his tools come from God hallelujah received as a lie [Applause] you asked me why I'm happy and here's the reason why because my sins are gone [Applause] where is those sins hallelujah our sins are gone in the element of Truth and when we can live in truth we can live victoriously Glory Hallelujah look so release what are you saying I'm saying cancer isn't real like but these I I you say but these I know somebody who got it that's because they received a lie because cancer is a perversion of what hilly and Castle can't create itself hallelujah it's a perversion of true sales so if you could not receive that perversion you'll stay healthy Hallelujah and I I feel some of y'all wrestling with that but y'all don't know I'm Ric Flair Hallelujah I'm Ric Flair so we gonna wrestle a little bit look I went to the doctor uh earlier this year and like always I know it's going to be a fight earlier I don't never expect to go without them seeing something that's their job when it comes to me Satan will always anoint the that's the scope the euroscope the our scope the horoscope and whatever else kind of scope he's going to anoint it to come back negative all right all positive or however they use it so I'm in the doctor's office because I was renewing my my my my D.O.T physical I have a CDL driver's license and I don't believe in giving up things that God gave me I ain't drove a truck in so many years Holly because God's been good to me but I keep my license and they say well if you don't take the test you can you can just get a regular driver's license I was like why I'm not a regular person so why would I want a regular driver's license I ain't regular I'm from out of this world Hallelujah church we are the extra [Applause] Hallelujah we are the kingdom of God we're not Ordinary People church that's what they messed up they said hey he was a man claiming to be God no he was God claiming to be a man that's when he missed it Hallelujah they missed the church they tried to change his identity they tried to make him a man's first things claimed to be gone no he was gone first then he became a man and so are you in the kingdom of God you are children of God Paris then you become a teacher then you become a nurse then you become a trump father then you become a factory worker but you are earlier God Children First but you never let the devil tell you that you're something natural oh my listen I was in there you all right you can't see it's a glare on that clock listen I go to the doctor renewing my my D.O.T and I get in there and the lady is checking me out and she does a blood cell a urine sample and oh my Mr Diggs you got diabetes imagine that imagine that God already telling me on the two prior times that I didn't have diabetes after they said I did so you think this time is going to be different hmm Hallelujah so I go in Hallelujah she said Mr Diggs you got diabetes I look her straight in her face and I said no I don't I ain't gonna receive your perversion I'm the original creation Hallelujah you're the original creation yeah Holly you have the ability to bring this flesh under subjection in church she says yes you do your numbers and your glucose y'all know your glucose and your fructose and your east coast and your West Coast whatever kind of Coast you like toast your dog toast mmm I said nah she said yes you do I said no no I don't say well well whatever this and that so doc comes in and he starts to go over this and go over all these things he said why do you why do you need your your duty physical I said because I want it he said because our job wasn't no because it's mine and I want it yeah Hallelujah so he says well your levels are kind of high and you know it looks like you got you know diabetes I say nope what you see is a protein drink what you see Hollywood is a pre-workout and he says to me no he don't go through your body that fast and this and that and blah blah blah say look man before I came here I went to the gym I had a pre-workout of protein shake and that's what you see that's what's in my body now for those of you who know me what was it last time thank you if it was sweet tea last time something I put in my body so this time it got to be the same thing something I put in my body yeah don't let the devil lie to you don't let him pervert your status right so he says now he says no he can't do this he can't dad so in my mind I'm thinking he's in my mind I'm thinking now he's a doctor with the school always a young guy man and I'm not trying to take away from that but he's saying you know you got this you got that and you know it don't come out your body and all these things I'm thinking when you drink something where does it come out at it's fluid and fluid comes out of the way fluid comes out thus pre-workout he's like no that's not that all these things or whatever blah blah blah so I'm like no he said we got to take a blood test oh man when you start saying you're gonna test me by the blood I started to shout and that's what you ought to do every time they say they need we need a blood sample come on come on Hallelujah we need to take a blood sample blood test a blood pressure whatever if you realize what the blood has done for you that means you're covered I ain't worried about no tests I ain't worried about no examination Hallelujah because when God sees my blood all he sees is his blood but it's according to your testimony and what you believe so I'm standing there like praise God hurry up test me prick me good because I'm confident that that blood still has power [Music] confident that he's still atoning in the midst of what they would call a tragedy very hot so he takes the test and all these things and he said look I'm not trying to be difficult I'm not trying to be difficult but I just want to make sure everything is good as everything is good so that was on a Wednesday that Thursday had to fly and go to Canada he said well call back Saturday your test should be back in and you'll find out everything so I went about my business you know what I'm thinking you know that this is just the enemy trying to walk you down you know he's trying to give you a little time to think about it what are you thinking about either he is or he isn't and as far as I'm concerned God is that's what the Bible says Harley you must first realize that he is Hallelujah so church I go to Canada and I come back Hallelujah the next the Monday and they're calling me they know they call me why are they call me Friday instead of Saturday they call me Friday but I'm like it's a deal with y'all when I get back so I got back they still called me still called me I said oh I say I'm coming I'm coming down there I'm coming you know they won't discuss stuff on the phone so I'm coming so I get down there and the doctors in there he said hey Mr D how you doing I said I'm doing good he said well yes came back normal like I told you that I told you it was pre-workout he said oh yeah he said well you know I just wanted to make sure I do what I'm supposed to do now this is the Clint Charlie don't never be afraid to stand your ground because there's a purpose in that tragedy there's a purpose in that test so in me standing my ground Hallelujah for those who drive trucks you know that Duty physical only lasts two years holding that's no two years if you're gonna drive you have to go get another physical because they want to make sure you're healthy while you're driving so this man already wrote my physicals did everything got everything I passed this wrote my um wrote my uh uh card out and when I look well it was supposed to be uh from February or this month for of this year 2022 to February of 2024. I don't know but mine said from February 2022 to February 32. you know what I mean I never got to be tested again the Rapture being took place before I got to go back and take another test will he do it ah mom so bear with a child bear with the death God has something for you on the end of it don't be dismayed Hallelujah in my closing Hallelujah cause I know it's getting late in my closing Church the reason why I read the book of Ruth look at the tragedy elimelech died child un die Milan died and now you got three women left all by themselves but you know what look at that tragedy it took that tragedy in Ruth's life to lead her to a boy as Hallelujah it took losing a husband to get the right hook Hallelujah it take Naomi Hallelujah to losing the limit like Hallelujah to being fully Redeemed by Paul half so sometimes it takes a longer to receive a blessing and that's how God works turn it looked like such a tragedy but it was that tragedy Hallelujah that pulled her in the fields it was that charity Hallelujah to put boys eyes on her it was that charity all the way up they gave her a typing barley season it was the type it was the tragedy Hallelujah and it's by that tragedy earlier to see that six Ballers a week wasn't good enough oh six seals are not good enough hallelujah amen God put her right in a place where she could be identified with seven Marley her life will change forever what started it I can go on and on about things in the Bible that would happen that look like a tragedy and God worked it out for his purpose y'all know Joseph's whole life was a tragedy his whole teenage years was a tragedy at the age of 15 Hallelujah his brothers was jealous so jealous they hated him sold them into slavery oh what a tragedy then he goes earlier but the part of his house she lies on him throws him in jail with a tragedy he gets in jail Hallelujah they forget about him oh what a tragedy all of that was leading up to what holy Pharaoh's dream all right yeah he took all that stuff that happened in his life just to get him to that place Hallelujah to be in Pharaoh's jail come on let me tell you power something what we do we be like Lord father God save my son whatever you got to do save them next thing you know you get a phone call here in jail and you're crazy behind Gathering up bail money when you didn't pray Lord do whatever you got to do to save him but you got enough air money for leave them in there remember your prayer that might be the thing Hallelujah that breaks it oh I know we got this sensitive believe that everybody thinks little about God's love who gonna love it he rebuking what Chase Lord save my son please whatever you got to do and they think leave them right in there and keep praying you say oh Lord whatever you got to do save my daughter she gets involved with a young man who beats her and breaks her heart and you want to get your gun and go after no you said whatever you Lord whatever you got to do save her stand there keep praying sometimes we go fight Hallelujah jump in the way and then God can't do nothing come on musicians I'm closer let me stop because I go down a whole other path with that one God has a way and a lot of times it's through tragedy but tragedy it works for our Goods and what you have to be careful of don't be like Joe's friends judging him by what he's going through right and there's some people who go through things in front of the whole world and then as some people go through things behind closed doors it doesn't mean that person going through things before everyone else did something wrong it may just mean that God is pulling a little bit more out of that person so that person needs your prayers too honey don't be like Joe's friends without cause they can accuse him right they never found anything wrong at all right all they kept saying is something got to be wrong Joe for you to be going through this right yeah what's going wrong is it was a bet and God knew job that's right keep in mind I want you to realize this Hallelujah your life has already been pre-planned by God so whatever trial whatever ups and downs you have have the right attitude because sometimes the right attitude to turn that thing that can only go three days into 40 years we didn't seen it hardly the wrong attitude let's pray Lord Jesus father we love you and we thank you Lord and pray that your word Lord has been shared and good ground Lord that it was something said Lord to uplift your people to encourage your people Lord to see you in the midst of everything Lord unto no father that we're not fight against flesh and blood Lord but a principalities Lord Darkness high places not an evils Lord have been laid out upon the land but Lord we know in the midst of all that Lord you you allow these things to come upon us to make us stronger so Lord God help us Lord to be your sons and your daughters Lord and to walk with our heads up Lord knowing that you're on our side and we're not forsaken despite what we may be said despite what made me believe Lord you know some of us have to go through it openly and some of us have to go through it privately but we know that you're with us all Lord we pray to the bless the church Lord and all those who are here tonight heard the word Lord just let him multiply father into that true purpose in their life in The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ we pray the church amen publish Church foreign [Music] Lord I need you Lord right now Hallelujah [Music] [Music] well let's have the right attitude [Music] I need you Lord right now [Music] I

power over what you or I go through God permits but has God has made so clear here tonight and he could have kept on preaching tonight we recognize how Satan wants to put you know everything when people can take a story and put a spin on it they can put a spin on it and make it come out in a certain way there ain't no spin on this this is the pure gospel it's the standard of the word of God and we can stand right there and look back at the Devil and say Boo because tragedy brings purpose oh my I tell you what my goodness to look at perversion and all those things and never look at it the same after tonight you know what it does it's God uncovering and if we can just tap into that like what was said tonight when you live in truth in that element of truth then we live Victorious and
