[44:08] commandments which I command thee this
[44:10] day shall ye observe to do that ye may
[44:14] live and multiply and go in and possess
[44:18] the land which the Lord swear unto your
[44:21] father's and thou shalt remember all the
[44:25] way which the LORD thy God led thee
[44:28] these 40 years in the wilderness to

[44:55] live by bread alone but by every word
[44:59] that proceedeth out of the mouth of the
[45:01] Lord love man lives Jonah chapter and we
[45:10] also want to start at verse 1 in the
[45:12] Book of Jonah and from there we're going
[45:15] to go to Psalm 77 Jonah chapter 1 verse
[45:25] 1 it says now the word of the Lord came
[45:27] unto Jonah and say I mean the son of a
[45:31] Midtown saying arise go to Nineveh that
[45:34] great city and cry against it for their
[45:38] wickedness has come up before me but
[45:42] Jonah rose up to flee unto Tosh's from
[45:46] the presence of the Lord and went down
[45:48] to Joppa and he found a ship going to
[45:52] tosha's so he paid the fare thereof and
[45:56] went down into it to go with them unto
[46:00] Tosh's from the presence of the Lord but
[46:02] the Lord sent out a great wind unto the
[46:05] see and there was a mighty tempest in
[46:09] the sea so that the ship was like to be
[46:13] broken
[46:14] a man Psalm 77
[46:32] Psalms chapter 77 let's read verse 17
[46:42] Psalm 77 and 17 the Bible says the
[46:44] clouds poured out water the skies sent
[46:47] out a sound thine arrow also went abroad
[46:51] the voice of thy Thunder was in the
[46:53] heaven the lightnings lightened the
[46:57] world the earth trembled and shook he
[47:01] made me a lord blessed to read of His
[47:02] Word you can have your seats tonight
[47:11] Amen everybody happy tonight amen praise
[47:15] the Lord I just kind of want to uplift
[47:17] for you tonight
[47:18] a man tonight by God's grace it may not
[47:22] seem like it with my topic but we're
[47:25] trusting in the Lord amen tonight by
[47:27] God's grace I want to use for a subject
[47:29] the storm is necessary
[47:31] amen the storm is necessary hallelujah
[47:37] you know one thing I'm learning to
[47:39] understand is that God he he doesn't do
[47:44] things the way we think it ought to be
[47:46] done amen
[47:48] but whatever God does he has a purpose
[47:52] behind it and you know in in times when
[47:56] we're going through things you know a
[47:58] lot of times we actually question why or
[48:00] why me you know or why am I going
[48:03] through this or what did I do
[48:05] you know you're a Christian there's a
[48:07] purpose behind it amen God is up to
[48:11] something amen and you know the devil
[48:14] thinks he's so smart
[48:16] cuddly but he's like I said like this
[48:20] Satan is only a tool in God's hands and
[48:24] it's smart and as shrewd as he is he can
[48:28] never get the jump on God perfectly
[48:31] he'll never catch God by surprise
[48:35] you never say God okay now you need to
[48:38] add some faith to them in the situation
[48:42] gods don't have to do that name Han
[48:45] because whenever you go through God is
[48:48] already prepared huh he's already giving
[48:52] you the goods he's already made away
[48:55] he's already praying for you the only
[48:57] thing you need to do is say no I believe
[49:00] and keep going forward
[49:02] hallelujah but you know in times where
[49:06] we're testing and we go through trials
[49:07] the human element gets in the way the
[49:11] human element we we begin to slow up and
[49:14] you know the first thing first things
[49:16] happen when we go through trials and
[49:18] tribulations let me let's get the church
[49:20] on the same record we ain't going to
[49:23] test somebody saying man we hate being
[49:35] tested but the only way for you to get
[49:39] to another level is to go to a test even
[49:43] the nuns out to rims you know without
[49:45] jobs and different things before you can
[49:46] be a nurse or a doctor you got to go
[49:49] through years of strenuous testing
[49:51] colors to be proven you can walk in that
[49:54] in that room and and say hey just don't
[49:57] mean nothing to me
[49:58] I can do this I know I can't have the
[50:00] ability and then say do you have a
[50:02] degree hallelujah did you pass the test
[50:05] hallelujah that's required for you to
[50:08] call yourself something a man and you
[50:10] know that's what God does
[50:11] God gives us spiritual test after test
[50:14] why because we got to be proven to be
[50:17] able to call ourselves the sons and
[50:20] daughters of God hurry everybody can't
[50:23] carry that label only those that have
[50:26] been proven can call themselves the
[50:29] children of God who you if you ain't
[50:33] been through nothing that means you
[50:34] ain't got no experience
[50:37] and the worst kind of person hallelujah
[50:41] to come and do something hallelujah the
[50:43] first time is a person with that
[50:45] experience all nervous all shook up and
[50:49] and hands shaking and everything else
[50:51] maybe it's a hot surgery you think that
[50:54] person want to do that if they haven't
[50:55] been proven no it's a very scary thing
[51:01] hey man and I'll say tonight huh Lia
[51:04] serving God can be very scary if you
[51:08] don't have any experience
[51:09] hariya but God gives us experiences so
[51:13] we can keep pressing amen and by those
[51:15] experiences hurry we'll be able to
[51:18] weather the storm oh yeah hey man but
[51:23] you know before I get going real good
[51:26] hallelujah let's talk about Jonah hey
[51:29] man you know Jonah you know we always
[51:32] look in the Bible and in the night when
[51:35] preaching I don't want us to to listen
[51:38] to the word and say well I know who
[51:40] that's for I know who that's for

[51:46] through that I'm talking to you tonight
[51:50] I'm talking to me tonight huh you know
[51:54] we spend so much time how do you taking
[51:57] the word and and using a shovel when we
[52:01] scooping it and throwing it over we're
[52:03] scooping it and throwing it to somebody
[52:05] we're scooping it and digging it deeper
[52:07] we need everybody need to put the
[52:09] shovels down the night and grab some
[52:11] ranks and pull everything to yourself

[52:26] fellowship with
[52:28] [Applause]
[52:29] [Music]
[52:30] [Applause]
[52:32] because when we stand before God we all
[52:35] stand and say where Lord brother Samuel
[52:37] did this - that ain't gonna fly it the
[52:44] judgment because it's what you've done
[52:47] with the word that you've been hearing
[52:48] Amen you know what I hear people say all
[52:50] the time I had a family member tell me
[52:52] you say you know that's good you're
[52:54] going to church you in middle setting
[52:55] everything but I've seen too much you
[52:58] know for me to trust preachers she been
[53:01] through a lot of storms he's letting
[53:04] those storms affect whether God is true
[53:07] on that okay but I want you to
[53:13] understand tonight that the majorities
[53:15] of the storms that we go through the
[53:18] devil didn't cause them you are got a
[53:23] church in you honey
[53:24] lot of times we go through things that
[53:26] we say the devil does the devil that the

[53:31] majority of your trials and tribulations
[53:33] come from God you can rejoice I rejoice
[53:41] for you that means if God is doing it
[53:47] hungry I've already got the victory
[53:50] because it promised me then I can bear

[58:18] from a family this was supposed to be a
[58:20] family usually go missing hallelujah on
[58:23] the back and some people on the back of
[58:25] a milk carton even gone from turn so
[58:27] long missing have you seen them but you
[58:38] don't leaving me go Harley for a week or
[58:40] so and nobody even inquires where you
[58:43] are that speaks a lot about your
[58:46] Christian life that speaks a lot about
[58:48] the atmosphere behind you and brother
[58:50] Samuel
[58:51] preachers notice to be true because
[58:53] certain preachers Holly will you come
[58:55] certain places we have people that
[58:57] connect with your ministry and they
[58:59] automatically start to a man when those
[59:02] people not then service saying hey man
[59:04] they say I wonder what so-and-so else
[59:06] today I won't live how many of you are
[59:11] those kinds of people honey if you can
[59:13] just miss chances nobody wonder where
[59:15] you are but you weren't here and maybe
[59:18] brother Saturday say have you seen
[59:20] sister so-and-so today why because she's
[59:22] connected to that let's change clothes
[59:27] what is it about your life that makes
[59:29] this church pal hey man
[59:31] because the Bible says whatever gift we
[59:33] have whatever we are is he fine he's
[59:41] supposed to make somebody else's life
[59:42] better and some of us are so caught up
[59:48] in our own child old tribulation we
[59:51] don't even understand that God is using
[59:52] you because somebody's watching how you
[59:55] going through your store but you started
[1:00:03] talking about the devil the devil does
[1:00:06] to do it
[1:00:06] I'm sorry brothers y'all know I'm a
[1:00:08] walker camera someway but you know but
[1:00:18] you know Church will you think about
[1:00:20] storms deaths and all these things we go
[1:00:23] to you we need to realize that earlier
[1:00:27] even where we are right now those of us
[1:00:30] feel the Holy Ghost and coming to church
[1:00:32] faithful God ain't done with us let's
[1:00:36] deal more he won't out of us so he he he
[1:00:40] loves us to have victories and he allows
[1:00:42] us to have defeats honey because those
[1:00:45] are things honey are gonna remind us
[1:00:47] that God is victorious oh yeah because
[1:00:51] without the valleys you never know what
[1:00:53] a mountain experience is like you never
[1:00:56] appreciate the goodness of God the grace
[1:00:59] of God the mercy of God you have to have
[1:01:02] times where you are
[1:01:03] and out lord help me and we got to be
[1:01:12] thankful that we have a god that can
[1:01:14] hear your cries never Papa I brought a
[1:01:20] message called deep color to the deep it
[1:01:23] has to be a date to respond oh my church
[1:01:31] with some of us ain't storms right now
[1:01:34] but I want you to think about it the
[1:01:37] pastor you think the person that's
[1:01:40] aggravating you maybe God trying to get
[1:01:44] you to a place you know what blew me
[1:01:47] away
[1:01:48] the Prophet was in a stage in his life
[1:01:51] and he was we understand that God used
[1:01:53] the Prophet matter calculate man mighty
[1:01:57] use him mightily but then in other stage
[1:02:00] in his life the Lord came to him and
[1:02:03] told him if you be more sincere prayer
[1:02:14] lies blinded eyes covered over deaf deaf
[1:02:17] ears middle and God comes and tells him
[1:02:19] if you be more sincere you'll see even
[1:02:22] more than now I'm an eye that just
[1:02:29] listening to that I don't think that he
[1:02:32] wasn't sincere
[1:02:33] grabblings that there was a whole nother
[1:02:35] level they he hadn't reached her if
[1:02:40] that's too simple a whole nother plateau
[1:02:45] who they had even reached and God came
[1:02:50] and told him hey you oh yeah you need to
[1:02:53] be more sincere what did God do God
[1:02:55] start Holly putting him in position
[1:02:57] sucker yeah well he had to humble
[1:03:00] himself huh certain things had to happen
[1:03:02] different things had to take place why
[1:03:04] cuz he could talk to God
[1:03:08] that's why I read Deuteronomy he says
[1:03:12] hey remember how I led you these 40
[1:03:18] years in the wilderness we say honey

[1:09:36] stores you know the greatest example one
[1:09:42] of the greatest example one of the
[1:09:43] greatest storms ever was the still not
[1:09:46] not not Florence not just one that just
[1:09:47] came y'all y'all thinking down south
[1:09:49] Florence as a bad start
[1:09:51] well it was for some people outstanding
[1:09:56] care along we didn't get touch all we
[1:10:01] got is a little bit of wind little bit
[1:10:03] of rain so tell us that breeze was nice
[1:10:07] did somebody else it was horrendous
[1:10:10] honey so you can see somebody going
[1:10:13] through something and you can judge it
[1:10:15] by your own experiences oh boy I can
[1:10:18] imagine what you're going through and
[1:10:19] they might be impressed and lord I thank
[1:10:21] you for your grace no I'm just I'm just
[1:10:24] I'm touched remember they they beat up
[1:10:26] Paul and they do that now Paul II beat
[1:10:29] up disciples and they do the mouth and
[1:10:30] they just a cell phone they start giving
[1:10:32] God praise and they praise the Lord we
[1:10:34] got beat up in the name of Jesus my
[1:10:41] every book they give God praise they
[1:10:45] said it was happy that they received
[1:10:47] persecution in the name of Jesus first
[1:10:51] and that's the attitude we ought to have
[1:10:53] when we're going through a storm hello
[1:10:57] but these storms are necessary earlier
[1:11:00] you know in choosing their Israel honey
[1:11:02] they had to go through all of that
[1:11:04] because God had to team the crowd down
[1:11:06] hallelujah so the faithful ones would
[1:11:09] have a story to tell
[1:11:12] hallelujah remember how he had to take
[1:11:15] them a certain way they had to be there
[1:11:17] hurry to see the Red Sea standing in the
[1:11:19] mist hurry
[1:11:20] but the believers got a story to tell
[1:11:25] they telling children holy how Pharaoh
[1:11:28] was chasing you they came out easy and
[1:11:30] God him the way of the Red Sea he wasn't
[1:11:38] Moses are you it was gonna lead to
[1:11:40] church and I'm here to say today honey
[1:11:43] if you got a Holy Ghost feel pastor
[1:11:46] standing behind that sacred death it
[1:11:48] ain't him Luton is gone reading him you
[1:12:01] know Moses get to the spot where the
[1:12:03] storm is so bad yeah you know what blows
[1:12:07] me away honey
[1:12:09] one thing about storms they're gonna be
[1:12:12] a big old category whatever five but
[1:12:18] when that thing hit land it breaks off
[1:12:20] into other stars and sometimes we have
[1:12:24] issues in our lives
[1:12:25] we have storms in our life carnal storms
[1:12:29] in our life and we don't deal with them
[1:12:31] they break off into other things and
[1:12:34] because of that word situation now you
[1:12:37] got other things happening in your life
[1:12:38] because you didn't deal with the store
[1:12:41] huh so you got to allow God hallelujah
[1:12:45] to deal huh to show you what to do in
[1:12:49] the midst of a storm the best thing you
[1:12:51] can do heylia in a storm is hath not to
[1:12:55] stop that's the worst thing you can do
[1:12:57] you know I see people when I be driving
[1:13:00] I Drive all the time storm coming they
[1:13:01] pull it over my mind said I'm like hey
[1:13:10] if I'm coming if I'm coming to uh
[1:13:12] Lorraine or sheffield wherever I'm at
[1:13:15] right here and I'm coming here I'm
[1:13:16] always South Carolina and Israeli in
[1:13:18] South Carolina
[1:13:19] ain't stopping because my hope my faith
[1:13:22] is get it ain't raining the whole way up
[1:13:24] there so I'm gonna keep driving
[1:13:27] hallelujah so I'm naked in the area
[1:13:29] where the Sun is shot but I gotta keep
[1:13:31] going in the midst of my
[1:13:33] stole hallelujah because even when is
[1:13:39] raining the Sun is still out oh yeah but
[1:13:47] storms are necessary oh my oh let me
[1:13:57] speed up a little bit Church when we
[1:14:00] looking we look right here in
[1:14:05] Deuteronomy how we see that the Lord
[1:14:07] said I did this to prove you to Humble
[1:14:10] you the show it was in your heart and
[1:14:12] God had already told them that I've
[1:14:14] given you the promised land
[1:14:15] but you got to go through these stores
[1:14:17] huh you got to fight yeah huh
[1:14:22] you got you got to be out there with all
[1:14:23] these unbelievers who who are in the
[1:14:25] church and they worshipping other gods
[1:14:28] he says doing all this to humble improve
[1:14:30] you hallelujah and then those see when
[1:14:32] you come through a storm
[1:14:34] you got a different attitude Hollis
[1:14:37] Chuck everything we need is already in
[1:14:39] the scripture and you take Joshua and
[1:14:41] Caleb those boys were in some some hard
[1:14:44] storms I mean they were in a storm when
[1:14:46] it looked like holy the Prophet was gold
[1:14:49] anyway and Josh was saying ain't going
[1:14:52] nowhere till you come back and we got
[1:14:56] those kind of people right now huh
[1:14:59] still waiting on the Prophet to come
[1:15:00] back but then you had somebody like a
[1:15:10] Caleb Polya who believed that message
[1:15:13] hallelujah who was a warrior a man but
[1:15:16] his attitude was a little different a
[1:15:18] man he said I was I was 40 years old I
[1:15:21] first called me honey and I'm just as
[1:15:26] strong now as I was dead honey what was
[1:15:29] speaking experience was speaking earlier

[1:15:39] to other young people go get a mountain
[1:15:45] nice edifying the body huh now he's
[1:15:49] helping one another a man he's come to
[1:15:50] his storm and he's realized the script

[1:41:54] area we want the Holy Ghost to fly this
[1:41:58] area tonight
[1:41:59] [Applause]
[1:42:08] stalls are necessary make a long story
[1:42:13] short I need to come down reason why
[1:42:16] where Jonah he told Jonah when she go to
[1:42:20] Nineveh crowd I guessed that great
[1:42:23] wicked city and Jonah and his mind he's
[1:42:26] like they don't deserve it they don't
[1:42:28] deserve it I ain't hang on God they
[1:42:31] didn't do too much eye wink God made us
[1:42:34] to jela Jeter jealous and sometimes we
[1:42:37] don't witness the people because we
[1:42:38] think they're gonna reject but we got to
[1:42:40] tell her but if God telling you to speak
[1:42:43] you ought to speak cuz he gonna back you
[1:42:46] up hallelujah oh yeah and you know Jonah
[1:42:50] ain't no going down to Joppa pay my
[1:42:53] ticket I'm going to holler you're toxis
[1:42:55] and he thought it was over
[1:42:58] but you know what blows me away but
[1:43:00] Samuel will look at people like like
[1:43:03] Jonah and we say Oh Sir Percy Baxley
[1:43:07] need not the message remember God says
[1:43:12] the storm huh you know sir I don't make
[1:43:17] my comments on people when they when
[1:43:19] they leave or they do whatever that's
[1:43:20] between them and God know is he's
[1:43:22] keeping me anchored I'm good I continue
[1:43:25] to pray for that person but it ain't
[1:43:27] mine
[1:43:28] it ain't my calling to be the challenge
[1:43:30] I'm like God you be merciful - and a lot
[1:43:33] of times harder people can realize they
[1:43:35] made a mistake but they don't come back
[1:43:38] because of how we handle them when they
[1:43:40] left no Jonah gets in the boat and he we
[1:43:52] look at John say go back slaughter
[1:43:54] brother Brown said you want her back
[1:43:57] slide on the back side he was in the
[1:44:01] will of God you say buddies come on how
[1:44:03] was he in the will of God I'm gonna give
[1:44:05] you one of the closest examples that he
[1:44:06] was in the will of God
[1:44:08] remember the Bible says and God
[1:44:12] to win the storm was necessary yeah it
[1:44:18] wasn't the devil doing it huh it was one
[1:44:20] of his children hardly on that boat and
[1:44:23] God had to send a message telling so he
[1:44:25] beginning to stir up the travels ho
[1:44:27] getting a mess up the tickets and all
[1:44:29] these things just to get his servant to
[1:44:32] pray and sometimes gotta do things like
[1:44:38] that just to show you he still hears
[1:44:41] your prayer hallelujah God I caused a
[1:44:49] storm so you can follow your knees and
[1:44:51] desperation just so he confirmed to you
[1:44:54] that you are still a child of God Jones
[1:45:07] on the boat God since the storm so much
[1:45:11] to catch John one Maxine listen storm
[1:45:16] came the marinas they start looking at
[1:45:19] each other you know what did you do
[1:45:25] what's going on they go to wake up Jonah
[1:45:30] in the midst of a storm now this is the
[1:45:33] question how could Jonah have peace in
[1:45:37] the midst of a storm he's actually the
[1:45:42] only other person that was on a boat
[1:45:44] that slept in the midst of a storm was
[1:45:46] the Lord Jesus Christ so he was out of
[1:45:51] the will of God
[1:45:51] how could he ever be a type of Christ in
[1:45:55] that moment he was a type of price
[1:45:59] shipping on the boat in the midst of a
[1:46:02] storm I don't know about you when I'm
[1:46:06] out of the will of God I can't sleep if
[1:46:10] I wasn't messed up I can't get no rest
[1:46:13] but the Bible say Jonah was fast asleep
[1:46:16] sleeping good now I don't sound like a
[1:46:19] man out of the will of God to me
[1:46:26] now don't bring an uncertain sound or
[1:46:28] what I'm saying and there's some people
[1:46:31] that do things and they just don't have
[1:46:32] no conviction I ain't talking about that
[1:46:35] huh Jonah had conviction but you notice
[1:46:39] God sent a storm
[1:46:41] hey everybody on the boat all uptight
[1:46:43] and they begin to say we're gonna roll
[1:46:45] away we go get John hey y'all throw me
[1:46:48] overboard hey man we can't do this we
[1:46:51] care about you we can't do you know me
[1:46:53] oh listen to the words coming out of my
[1:46:56] mouth
[1:46:57] throw me overboard sometimes God has to
[1:47:04] speak to us like that like we don't
[1:47:05] understand what he's saying
[1:47:10] joe said to me we said no we gonna throw
[1:47:12] your boy out yeah and the waters got
[1:47:14] worse who made the waters worse God Joe
[1:47:21] say tie me up
[1:47:22] don't be a boy there's a purpose for
[1:47:25] that storm it was a bigger purpose than
[1:47:29] Jonah I want you to go back and read it
[1:47:32] Jones I don't the boy they do Jonah
[1:47:34] overboard once they threw him overboard
[1:47:38] the storm ceased what happened after
[1:47:44] that
[1:47:44] the men on the boat Saturday knees and
[1:47:49] they started offering sacrifice to God
[1:47:52] they started worshipping God and they
[1:47:54] made a vow to God if Jonah would've
[1:47:57] never been on that boat that wouldn't
[1:47:59] never happen so sometimes in the midst
[1:48:03] of your storm there are people that God
[1:48:05] want to get to but the only way you can
[1:48:07] get to them is if you go through a storm
[1:48:09] oh yeah there are people in your family
[1:48:12] that's watching your life hallelujah and
[1:48:14] by yo storm they may be saved
[1:48:20] [Applause]
[1:48:25] because Jonah was on that boat those
[1:48:27] mean how do you cry like the god holy
[1:48:30] offered sacrifice and they worship
[1:48:32] dollar if Jonah Willis went straight to
[1:48:35] the elevat-- God would have never got
[1:48:37] those men back so sometimes there are
[1:48:41] people in your path that God is trying
[1:48:44] to get you and the only way he can get
[1:48:46] to them is if you go through something
[1:48:50] and you don't even know what he's doing
[1:48:53] but God is setting it all up honey God
[1:48:56] already had a special preparing fish
[1:48:57] there hallelujah go ahead God I'm
[1:49:00] worried about Jonah he had everything
[1:49:02] hooked up for Jonah he was worried about
[1:49:04] those meal Aleppo and the choosing a
[1:49:06] little thing you say oh say my wife say
[1:49:15] my husband stole no I say for children
[1:49:20] stole sometimes it's how you go through
[1:49:25] it dictate whether they come to it cuz
[1:49:30] they watching you you the one go around
[1:49:33] here to my joke are real did you put you
[1:49:40] in position to prove it
[1:49:42] and God God is so wise honey now he had
[1:49:49] two agendas the middle of the boat he
[1:49:51] took care of him honey put Jonah in the
[1:49:54] fish honey
[1:49:55] now this fish that has no brain to
[1:49:57] comprehend it doesn't have a GPS or map
[1:50:03] in his hand some kind of way it stays
[1:50:07] like there three days long enough for
[1:50:10] Jonah to get his heart right God is so
[1:50:17] good
[1:50:19] to the nightlife what why my garden is
[1:50:23] just low don't worry everything is gonna
[1:50:25] work everything is gonna man down
[1:50:27] God is doing he's doing something so
[1:50:29] unbelievable
[1:50:30] he gonna blow your mind there's a guy
[1:50:35] Liza taking this loan
[1:50:36] he's working everything out he came
[1:50:41] towards us enough time 3 that he crying
[1:50:46] out now he's back in profit status storm
[1:50:53] was necessary honey
[1:50:55] demanding repentance is only the joining
[1:50:57] the fish Hollow he's in the fish's belly
[1:51:00] fish fish don't know nothin hold the
[1:51:05] fish no he's supposed to go swallow man
[1:51:10] [Music]
[1:51:12] now let me ask you a question from that
[1:51:15] time how many times have you ever heard
[1:51:18] about a fish smaller than me
[1:51:21] you heard him bite no man but this was a
[1:51:26] special fish swallow Jonah Holly hey man
[1:51:33] the storm was necessary honey in church
[1:51:36] oh now I will show you how powerful
[1:51:38] disease now cuz we know when storms
[1:51:41] happen normally the fish don't get
[1:51:43] washed up on shore cuz they know what's
[1:51:46] going on they go a different direction
[1:51:47] honey because they're connected with
[1:51:49] nature office this fish stayed in the
[1:51:53] storm it didn't run for his life
[1:51:59] oh yeah it's instinct
[1:52:04] totally circle around this boat stay
[1:52:08] right here huh Leah and your dinner is
[1:52:10] gonna come in the form of a man
[1:52:15] I will change Oh daya today I want you
[1:52:22] to tell the devil if the devil saying
[1:52:24] you don't deserve it I want you to tell
[1:52:26] the devil God can do what you wanna do
[1:52:29] [Applause]
[1:52:31] [Music]
[1:52:35] if God will bless us God can do what you
[1:52:39] wanna do
[1:52:40] say don't you tell me I don't deserve it
[1:52:44] I decide what god bless me with fish
[1:53:04] scoops him up stays I did by truth a
[1:53:08] half is is that this swimming so John
[1:53:11] can get his alright now Jonah back in
[1:53:13] profit moles Lord how to look to all the
[1:53:16] temple he's in prayer more than
[1:53:18] everything I did all of a sudden the
[1:53:21] fish gets to a certain spot where he's
[1:53:23] starting to feel sick and he ain't gonna
[1:53:29] go to the bottom and die he's gonna go
[1:53:31] to the shore the storm was necessary and
[1:53:37] God is wisdom honey and everything set
[1:53:42] up because he knew that the people of
[1:53:44] Nineveh worship the fish God and not
[1:53:47] this big old fish hurry
[1:53:49] follows up a God throws of a god named
[1:53:55] Jonah proclaiming holy the Lord of lords
[1:53:58] and the king of kings this man comes
[1:54:01] with a message not talking about the
[1:54:03] fish God but talking about the God of
[1:54:06] God the strong was necessary church that
[1:54:18] meeting was the greatest revival ever
[1:54:23] recorded by one man
[1:54:27] besides the Lord Jesus Christ I think it
[1:54:30] was over 250,000 people repented from
[1:54:36] that message a storm is necessary what
[1:54:44] is God trying to do in your storm I know
[1:54:49] we said a lot of things but I want you
[1:54:52] to realize there's a purpose it's
[1:54:55] necessary God so Joseph and he was a
[1:54:59] sheep his brothers bowed down to him his
[1:55:03] mom and Daddy bowed down to her honey
[1:55:06] but how he got to that point he had to
[1:55:08] go through a storm holy cow patia his
[1:55:13] brothers being jealous of him was
[1:55:15] necessary huh his God is daddy giving
[1:55:19] him that special made coat that was
[1:55:21] necessary why because they started up
[1:55:24] the spirit of jealousy it wasn't the
[1:55:31] devil making him jealous
[1:55:33] who was it God knew exactly what was
[1:55:39] gonna happen
[1:55:40] Don say you know what I want you to make
[1:55:42] that boy's special coat cause it's gonna
[1:55:43] round your brother's up and Joseph need
[1:55:46] to get to the throne storm was necessary
[1:55:50] honey he goes ahead Joseph my boy boy I
[1:55:55] just love you trying let's go you try
[1:55:57] that : throw him in the pit we don't get
[1:56:03] rid of him you just wait one day we
[1:56:06] gonna get when Dad it around we're gonna
[1:56:08] get rid of no spirit of jealousy who
[1:56:14] allowed that to come and Joseph skip it
[1:56:25] it was necessary honey
[1:56:28] cuz he had to be bought into slavery to
[1:56:30] get the part of us out
[1:56:32] and then hot air particles wife look at
[1:56:35] hey big boy how you doing
[1:56:38] come on I want to eat lunch with you
[1:56:43] that lust demon was necessary
[1:56:46] Oh cuz Joseph had to show the devil
[1:56:57] holy that lust had no power over him it
[1:57:05] was necessary huh
[1:57:07] so I could be written in the Bible so a
[1:57:09] young man could see honey
[1:57:11] that God is greater than us he wiggle
[1:57:23] out his clothes and run from her next
[1:57:24] thing you know she tell allow them that
[1:57:26] allow was necessary why so he can get
[1:57:30] locked up not in a jailhouse running a
[1:57:36] jailhouse oh the gift didn't stop the
[1:57:39] storm didn't change who he was say I
[1:57:45] said this the other night huh look I
[1:57:47] thought storm goes in to tell everything
[1:57:49] but when that storm leaves an apple tree
[1:57:52] is still an apple tree the storm don't
[1:57:58] change the seed oh yeah hey no matter
[1:58:01] how hard it broke no matter what
[1:58:03] category it is hurry when the storm is
[1:58:06] over an apple tree is still an apple
[1:58:09] tree and when the Sun shines he's gonna
[1:58:11] produce apples although working
[1:58:17] oh good he's in jail running the
[1:58:27] jailhouse hurry because the wife didn't
[1:58:30] own up that was necessary why because he
[1:58:33] had to meet the bacon the butler why
[1:58:38] because they had a dream a man hug and
[1:58:42] you had to hear that dream hallelujah
[1:58:44] and he not only that he had to get
[1:58:45] forgotten sometimes we're going through
[1:58:52] things and feel like God don't hear our
[1:58:53] prayer but God just want to see if
[1:58:56] you're gonna remain faithful Lulu you
[1:59:00] you want to see if you gonna remain
[1:59:01] faithful no joke joseph state is running
[1:59:05] the jailhouse huh
[1:59:07] and then you know certain things happen
[1:59:09] hug one of them head get cut off and the
[1:59:12] other one go back to what they were
[1:59:13] doing and then next thing you know
[1:59:15] pharaoh has a dream remember the bacon
[1:59:19] but Lana dream Joseph interpreters in
[1:59:21] those dreams was necessary so that the
[1:59:23] one that was gonna be restored he could
[1:59:25] go back with the testimony to be able to
[1:59:28] tell honey the king that there's a man
[1:59:30] in your jailhouse tapes why are you
[1:59:39] going to your store earlier no matter
[1:59:42] what you're going through tonight when
[1:59:43] you get home I want you to look at your
[1:59:45] mirror and you say you know what devil
[1:59:47] God is in control boo devil I said boo
[1:59:56] devil booty back bhudev Oh
[2:00:03] you thought it was over you quit when I
[2:00:07] say boot elbow I ain't going nowhere
[2:00:11] cuz God is in control Pharaoh has a
[2:00:18] dream he tell us to the but I believe
[2:00:20] the butler tends to the butler buzzing I
[2:00:25] remember my mistake there's a man in
[2:00:31] your jailhouse that can interpret dreams
[2:00:39] so it was necessary that Joseph didn't
[2:00:42] already get delivered the dreams and
[2:00:45] everything had to take place so that not
[2:00:48] only when he's exhausted
[2:00:50] he's exhausted above anybody else
[2:00:54] because he's not just gonna be huh an
[2:00:57] advisor he's gonna be adviser to the
[2:01:00] through basically haruya god had to do
[2:01:06] it in such a way where Joseph can run
[2:01:10] the kingdom had people saying bow the
[2:01:16] knee
[2:01:17] Joseph is come the store was necessary
[2:01:22] so that the people could see God behind
[2:01:27] skin a man that could tell what's gonna
[2:01:31] happen in seven years to come and in
[2:01:34] seven years after it was necessary oh
[2:01:42] yeah you don't want to say it like this
[2:01:45] but it was necessary for brother Branham
[2:01:47] to lose his little baby huh it was
[2:01:50] necessary that he lose his wife huh
[2:01:52] because if God would have done that we
[2:01:54] would have never heard this message
[2:02:00] come on musicians I'm closing I'm
[2:02:04] closing come on there's a lot of things
[2:02:07] that have taken place
[2:02:08] turkey honey it was necessary that I got
[2:02:11] cancer in my brain so I could go all
[2:02:14] around the world and testify that God is
[2:02:16] a healer the devil don't get no credit
[2:02:25] God allowed me to go through it so I can
[2:02:28] tell my god still remains to be true it
[2:02:43] was necessary for me to get brain cancer
[2:02:46] select doc I get glory I hope you
[2:02:52] looking at your storm different I hope
[2:03:01] you're looking at a different Church

[2:34:01] know something you enjoy you don't you
[2:34:03] don't worry about time and honestly
[2:34:06] tonight when brother cadre was
[2:34:08] ministering and then he talked about
[2:34:09] coming to the end I felt like he just
[2:34:12] got started
[2:34:14] and that's the truth you know sometimes
[2:34:18] we have to recognize friends that
[2:34:20] sometimes and I'm not just talking those
[2:34:21] here but those on streaming as well to
[2:34:24] recognize God is not confined to time
[2:34:29] sometimes we can get so much in our mind
[2:34:32] to where this has to be done in a
[2:34:34] certain time and you got to know this in
[2:34:35] a certain time in you and how do you
[2:34:37] know it may not be that God is testing
[2:34:39] your patience to see will you praise him
[2:34:43] will you worshipping will you hold on
[2:34:45] how do you know and I say oh my every
[2:34:50] opportunity that we have it ought to be
[2:34:53] an opportunity to worship Him let go we
[2:34:58] sing that song so often let go and let
[2:35:00] God have his way but you know what
[2:35:03] that's the real reality when we're
[2:35:05] willing to let go God moves in such a
[2:35:07] wonderful way how many you know that's
[2:35:10] the truth those testify even from
[2:35:13] brother Randy's the church it's the same
[2:35:14] way once you let go and let God move you
[2:35:18] know what God doesn't have to have
[2:35:20] numbers all God needs his lives that are
[2:35:23] surrendered to him that love his
[2:35:25] appearing and love for him to move boy
[2:35:30] it's easy to preach after this
[2:35:32] but you know the reality if we look at
[2:35:35] something we can become so selfish we
[2:35:38] can be say I've only come for the word
[2:35:40] we'll remember the word is not a letter
[2:35:42] the words a person we have overcome that
[2:35:46] trinitarian devil we don't look at and
[2:35:51] say wow we don't need the moving of the
[2:35:53] Spirit if you don't need the moving of
[2:35:54] the spirit then you don't need the word
[2:35:56] because the spirit and the word are one
[2:36:00] are you with me
[2:36:01] we are they are one we need the moving
[2:36:06] of the Spirit of God as he moves to
[2:36:09] confirm the word that right God comes
[2:36:12] right behind right in the worship right
[2:36:15] through the word and he comes and has
[2:36:16] worth standing there how many times
[2:36:18] we're here on tape where the Rebbe says
[2:36:19] less water this word to come less water
[2:36:22] it less water the word that come oh my I
[2:36:25] tell you what I just I believe that God
[2:36:28] has spoke to our hearts tonight I
[2:36:33] believe that with all my heart now you
[2:36:37] know someone might look at that and say
[2:36:39] well that ain't deep preaching it's deep
[2:36:41] I'll tell you what right now that is the
[2:36:44] Seventh Seal moving through your life
[2:36:45] and a trial we can preach that on down
[2:36:49] that that's what it is
[2:36:50] see it's the uncovering of that mystery
[2:36:53] of Christ all the way as it was through
[2:36:55] Joseph and I'll tell you what it just so
[2:36:57] struck my heart back there how many
[2:36:58] times that we've you've read the story
[2:37:00] you heard the story how many times we've
[2:37:01] preached on it but back there in that
[2:37:03] time lord have mercy it just sparked
[2:37:05] just inspired my heart the path to
[2:37:08] fulfillment it was not a path that any
[2:37:10] of us would have chose we would not have
[2:37:12] chose this pathway as far as within our
[2:37:14] own self but thank god there's a seed of
[2:37:17] God on the inside of us that's been
[2:37:19] quickened that's the real you and me on
[2:37:21] the inside and that real son and
[2:37:24] daughter of God it yields to the paths
[2:37:26] of God's fulfillment there's no way we
[2:37:29] would have chose these things Joseph
[2:37:30] wouldn't have chosen if Joseph would
[2:37:32] have known what that coat of many colors
[2:37:33] are gonna do he would have returned it
[2:37:36] he would have looked on a receipt 30-day
[2:37:38] return policy and returned it no there's
[2:37:42] too much trouble I don't I don't need
[2:37:43] that wheat but you know what God knew
[2:37:45] exactly
[2:37:46] he was doing you know what it brings us
[2:37:48] to such a reality you know the whole
[2:37:50] thing that God was speaking once again
[2:37:52] to us over and over of all these avenues
[2:37:55] rest rest I'm over this and they're
[2:38:02] wonderful when the disciples after
[2:38:03] they'd already been filled with the Holy
[2:38:04] Ghost
[2:38:05] then when Herod and the rest of them
[2:38:07] started coming against him they got up
[2:38:09] there in the upper room they got up
[2:38:10] there again gathered together and they
[2:38:12] began to pray and they said Lord thou
[2:38:16] art the Almighty God not the creator of
[2:38:19] heaven and earth
[2:38:20] you know they begin to recognize this is
[2:38:23] not about Herod they put God above gods
[2:38:28] above this situation I tell you what my
[2:38:34] goodness you see these kind of things
[2:38:36] like this how the Lord speaks to our
[2:38:37] heart it'll give you more strength to
[2:38:39] fight the devil then if you got eight
[2:38:42] hours of beauty sleep this right here
[2:38:46] will cause you to get up in the morning
[2:38:48] before your arm gets off yes sir you're
[2:38:52] ready I mean you're charged and ready to
[2:38:53] go you know why because God Himself has
[2:38:57] spoke to that part of himself on the
[2:38:59] inside and that part on the inside of
[2:39:01] himself has heard him tonight and raised
[2:39:04] up above all other voices and has been
[2:39:07] encouraged and strengthened and he said
