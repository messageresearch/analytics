[38:47] your seats just for a few moments I want
[38:51] to just mention to you here this morning
[38:55] we I want to just if we could on a
[39:00] special offering that we lift here the
[39:02] the mission offering I'd like to employ
[39:07] that or send that for where it will help
[39:10] with the cost for brother Richard and
[39:14] sister Maria's little granddaughter
[39:15] Liliana there's been a lot of medical
[39:18] expenses and things that has has went
[39:21] forth there already they are going back
[39:25] down again here to Cincinnati tomorrow
[39:29] and so we just want to we want to direct
[39:33] that in that way if today that you were
[39:37] not with you're not prepared because
[39:39] this would be the mission offering what
[39:42] we would do is is that even next week
[39:44] we'll even extend it into next Sunday as
[39:46] well you'll just have to make sure and
[39:48] even next Sunday if you want to give
[39:50] even more toward it or what have you you
[39:53] can write it on the envelope just make
[39:55] sure that you make it out to the special
[39:57] offering there that's for Liliana's
[40:01] medical expenses and let's also let's
[40:04] just really continue to keep that that
[40:09] that situation in prayer as well
[40:13] you know we've we've already we've
[40:15] applied amen the promise and faith a man
[40:20] and just looking for the Lord to have
[40:23] his way and for God to move and so we
[40:28] just want to just keep that in prayer as
[40:31] a church you know there's many needs
[40:33] that we have is throughout the body
[40:36] there's many needs that are here we have
[40:39] this need and we have many others and
[40:41] and you know I'll say it like this even
[40:43] when we have a good report of things
[40:45] don't let off the gas pedal don't let
[40:49] off the gas pedal push the gas pedal a
[40:52] little bit further down we want to pray
[40:56] completely even in times sometimes you
[40:58] know there's things you can get good
[41:00] reports on you say honey where would
[41:03] that be in Scripture well in Scripture
[41:05] it's always when God gives a promise the
[41:07] people of God that promises made known
[41:09] to them then they begin to pray for that
[41:12] promise when Daniel the Bible says when
[41:15] Daniel understood by the books then
[41:17] Daniel went into prayer and when Daniel
[41:20] went into prayer here he was it was a
[41:22] secret of that life Daniel he began to
[41:25] pour his heart out make sure there was
[41:27] nothing in the way that would hinder God
[41:31] in his life Daniel believed he was a
[41:33] part of it and he was a part of it and
[41:37] so Daniel prayed concerning that when
[41:39] Peter I've always looked at this when
[41:41] Peter wasn't the we continue to pray
[41:46] amen so let's just remember that also in
[41:50] prayer I want to just also mention to
[41:54] you this as the brothers would prepare
[41:59] in just a moment to come the Lord
[42:03] willing my wife and I will be leaving
[42:04] here on Tuesday for New Mexico for
[42:07] meetings there with brother Manuel
[42:08] Salazar and
[42:11] not just myself but of a number of other
[42:14] ministers that are going in there for
[42:17] Wednesday through through Sunday so I
[42:21] just asked you to be in prayer with us
[42:25] this has been planned out for some time
[42:27] and so I just asked you to be in prayer
[42:30] with us during that time will you do
[42:33] that
[42:33] I certainly am i certainly am counting
[42:37] on that and I mean that with all my
[42:39] heart I'm counting on that too and you
[42:43] know also one surah mentioned to you
[42:47] this coming Thursday brother Steve Bruce
[42:48] Owen from Quebec will be here with us
[42:51] and brother Steve had mentioned about
[42:56] coming by because he will be next
[42:59] weekend brother Steve will be with
[43:00] brother
[43:01] Paula Fontaine and the Saints there and
[43:04] then also the tri-state youth meeting on
[43:06] that Sunday evening that I think it's at
[43:09] six o'clock so let's remember that on
[43:12] Thursday brother Steve will be here most
[43:14] of you remember brother Steve when it
[43:16] came last year in April and just a real
[43:21] real wonderful brother in the Lord
[43:23] pastors a church there in Quebec also
[43:26] want to mention on that Sunday on Sunday
[43:29] brother Boaz Romero will be here now
[43:32] brother Boaz will be returning it's the
[43:34] first time he's been here with us since
[43:37] he's been married and so he married a
[43:41] sister from Quebec so I'm sure he'll be
[43:43] wanting to show off his bride so we want
[43:48] to just be in prayer for those services
[43:51] as well and then Lord willing my wife
[43:54] we'll land back in here on Monday
[43:55] evening and just be in prayer with that
[43:59] as well and I also would really ask your
[44:02] prayer because then we're here for a
[44:04] couple weeks and then we're down at the
[44:07] believers youth camp with meetings down
[44:10] there where I'll be down there the whole
[44:12] week and ministering there and I ask you
[44:15] just if you would go ahead and begin
[44:17] praying for that as well but the Lord
[44:19] will just have his way because there are
[44:21] hearts and lives to be touched by the
[44:24] Lord young people that need an
[44:26] experience with God those that haven't
[44:28] experienced it they would be further

[48:31] god bless you god bless u musicians I
[48:36] want you to if you'll turn with me in
[48:38] the scriptures to Acts chapter 2 and I
[48:44] want to read
[48:47] begin beginning in verse one
[49:04] and I want to speak because I know I did
[49:08] not send a title to you all but I want
[49:10] to speak on Pentecost the Jubilee
[49:15] Pentecost the Jubilee in Acts chapter 2
[49:22] verse 1 we're going to read just a few
[49:24] verses of Scripture and when the day of
[49:29] Pentecost was fully come what was a type
[49:34] now is fully come they were all with one
[49:41] Accord in one place and suddenly there
[49:45] came a sound from heaven as of a rushing
[49:49] mighty wind and it filled all the house
[49:53] where they were sitting and there
[49:56] appeared unto them cloven tongues like
[49:58] as a fire and it's sat upon each of them
[50:02] and they were all filled with the Holy
[50:06] Ghost and began to speak with other
[50:08] tongues as the Spirit gave them
[50:13] utterance now you're aware as we go on
[50:18] without me reading more in that
[50:21] particular those scriptures they the
[50:25] Bible says they heard every man in their
[50:30] own tongue they were still speaking in
[50:34] their native language but the others
[50:37] were hearing it in their language amen
[50:42] but it's what they were saying that was
[50:47] important verse 12
[50:53] and they were all amazed and were in
[50:56] doubt saying one to another what meaneth
[51:01] this others mocking said these men are
[51:04] full of new wine but Peter standing up
[51:08] with the eleven lifted up his voice and
[51:11] said unto them ye men of Judea and all
[51:16] that dwell at Jerusalem be this known
[51:18] unto you and hearken to my Worth what
[51:22] authority here's the one who ran when
[51:26] they asked you were with him this is
[51:31] different now it wasn't just with him
[51:35] the one he was with was now in him for
[51:42] these are not drunken as you suppose
[51:46] seeing it is but the third hour of the
[51:48] day but this is that which was spoken by
[51:52] the Prophet Joel and it shall come to
[51:54] pass in the last days saith god I will
[51:58] pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and
[52:01] your sons and your daughters shall
[52:03] prophesy and your young men shall see
[52:06] visions and your old men shall dream
[52:08] dreams and on my servants and on my
[52:11] handmaidens I will pour out in those
[52:13] days of my spirit and they shall
[52:15] prophesy and I will show wonders in
[52:18] heaven above and signs in the earth
[52:20] beneath blood and fire and vapor of
[52:22] smoke the Sun shall be turned into
[52:24] darkness and the moon into blood before
[52:27] that great and notable day of the Lord
[52:30] come and it shall come to pass that
[52:32] whosoever shall call on the name of the
[52:35] Lord shall be saved
[52:39] now one more place in that same
[52:41] scripture here verse 32
[52:47] this Jesus hath God raised up we're up
[52:50] we all our witnesses therefore being by
[52:55] the right hand of God exalted and having
[52:58] received of the father the promise of
[53:00] the Holy Ghost he hath shed forth this
[53:03] which ye now see and hear verse 37 now
[53:11] when they heard this they were pricked
[53:14] in their heart and said unto Peter and
[53:17] to the rest of the Apostles men and
[53:19] brethren what shall we do then Peter
[53:24] said unto them repent and be baptized
[53:27] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[53:29] Christ for the remission of sins and ye
[53:33] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[53:38] for the promise I want you just to look
[53:41] at this here for the promise is unto you
[53:44] and to your children and to all that are
[53:49] afar off even as many as the Lord our
[53:53] God shall call amen may the Lord bless
[53:59] the reading of his word as you're being
[54:00] seated if you'll turn with me also now
[54:04] to the Book of Luke amen want to say
[54:08] brother Samuel god bless you amen it was
[54:10] a it was a pleasure having you here with
[54:13] us take our greetings back to your dad
[54:16] your mom and the church amen god bless
[54:19] you
[54:21] let's go to Luke chapter 4 here you're
[54:25] probably already there
[54:32] now
[54:35] the Bible says in verse 16 and he came
[54:40] to Nazareth where he had been brought up
[54:43] and as custom was he went into the
[54:46] synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood
[54:49] up for to read and there was delivered
[54:51] unto him the book of the Prophet
[54:54] Isaiah's
[54:54] and when he had opened the book he found
[54:57] the place where it was written the
[55:01] Spirit of the Lord is upon me now what
[55:04] you think of this he's reading what has
[55:08] been wrote but he's not reading it he's
[55:11] declaring it this is not just a reading
[55:16] this is declaring what was wrote now is
[55:20] living the Spirit of the Lord is upon me
[55:25] because he hath anointed me to preach
[55:30] the gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[55:34] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[55:36] deliverance to the captives and
[55:38] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[55:42] at liberty them that are bruised to
[55:45] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[55:50] and if I just let me make a common here
[55:54] just for a moment how fitting
[55:58] where the Lord Jesus himself standing
[56:03] here and would begin to declare the
[56:06] acceptable year of the Lord
[56:08] announcing the jubilee is approaching
[56:12] this is the Jubilee is approaching to
[56:17] think of where you and I stand in this
[56:19] hour that God in the message that he has
[56:23] given to us the finishing up of this
[56:27] working with the Gentile age this same
[56:30] thing repeats here and you're aware of
[56:33] this as believers in the message birth
[56:35] pains for the bream tags looks at
[56:38] there's pages that are stuck together
[56:39] and he's trying to find he says
[56:42] something's wrong with my Bible and so
[56:45] then the priest a priest a Catholic
[56:47] priest comes up to him gives him his
[56:50] Bible that he's been reading from and he
[56:53] says be still my son
[56:55] God is doing something and he reads this
[56:59] scripture because we you and I are
[57:02] standing in an hour that not only are we
[57:06] called back into the promised land of
[57:10] the fullness of the Holy Ghost but it is
[57:13] also calling you and I to what the
[57:18] prophets to what everyone has looked
[57:21] forward to that we would be delivered
[57:26] from this body and into that body that
[57:30] God has prepared for us he's the Alpha
[57:35] and Omega so when we look at where we
[57:38] are in standing here I want to deal with
[57:41] this because you would know they would
[57:43] have this marked even on the calendars
[57:45] when you would look at it today as that
[57:47] of Pentecost and they would have you
[57:51] know those things laid out but to me
[57:53] when we look at this within the
[57:56] scripture here to understand that each
[57:59] of these parts here of what the Ministry
[58:03] of the Lord Jesus here would come to do
[58:05] it was it is a ministry that brings
[58:10] liberté it brings healing it brings a
[58:14] recovering of sight it brings
[58:16] deliverance and it sets at liberty them
[58:19] that are bruised now I want you to think
[58:22] of this here and I want to just kind of
[58:24] move through this just a little bit you
[58:27] realize that if we would go back here in
[58:30] the beginning and go back clear to where
[58:33] they were the first family was there in
[58:37] the Garden of Eden you and I realized
[58:39] that there was a falling from eternal
[58:43] life God had given them his word and
[58:46] they were fortified behind that word but
[58:49] there was a falling from that of eternal
[58:53] life there were choices that were made
[58:55] in that time remember Adam did not under
[59:00] deception make a choice
[59:02] but Adam willfully made a choice when
[59:06] his wife had been deceived he made a
[59:09] choice in order to redeem her he
[59:13] redeemed her with the imparting of his
[59:16] life in her and remember with that then
[59:21] hear God as the Lord moves down here
[59:25] within the Garden of Eden remember here
[59:27] God comes down and he speaks in genesis
[59:30] 3:15 that he would give the woman a seed
[59:34] and that that seed itself would bruise
[59:38] the very head of the serpent that God
[59:41] would be the one who would be the
[59:45] undoing of what was done man was not
[59:49] able to undo what was done in Eden but
[59:54] it would take God himself that he is the
[59:58] one who would supply what was needed and
[1:00:01] God made this announcement I will give
[1:00:04] the woman a seat and you and I know or
[1:00:07] the woman does not have a seat
[1:00:10] but God Himself becoming one of us God
[1:00:16] through him by the creation of there
[1:00:19] creating a body that he himself would
[1:00:22] come down
[1:00:23] and live in and redeem you and I back
[1:00:26] unto himself and then listen through
[1:00:28] that Redemption it not only brings us
[1:00:31] back into the life that we fell from but
[1:00:36] it also is to bring us back and bring to
[1:00:40] restore back to what it was in Eden and
[1:00:44] it also then is to restore the earth to
[1:00:48] her former glory
[1:00:52] this is all his doing he expressed that
[1:01:00] he would bring them back where they fell
[1:01:03] from they fell from eternal life they
[1:01:06] fell from eternal youth so to think of
[1:01:10] how that God here would come down and he
[1:01:14] would bring life to us and bring to us
[1:01:17] our inheritance to bring us back and
[1:01:21] restore that fallen Eden who can read
[1:01:23] that in Romans 5 we find this great
[1:01:26] redemption story God has wrote this even
[1:01:30] when you could go back even to the very
[1:01:32] beginning in the opening of Genesis but
[1:01:34] for sake of time we even look at how
[1:01:37] that God moves down and it begins to
[1:01:40] deal with Abraham to think of it God in
[1:01:45] the restoring of this he deals with
[1:01:47] Abraham and here is Abram down there in
[1:01:50] the earth of counties and God speaks to
[1:01:54] Abraham and the Lord brings Abraham out
[1:01:57] of the earth of counties and here's what
[1:02:00] God told him he speaks to him in the
[1:02:03] land where he currently is under
[1:02:06] idolatry and everything else but he
[1:02:08] makes known to Abram there is a land and
[1:02:12] this land is a land that I'm going to
[1:02:16] give to you and to your seed at that
[1:02:19] time Abram had no seed his wife was
[1:02:23] barren but there was a promise that was
[1:02:27] made then I'm going to give you a land I
[1:02:30] will show you the land that I'm talking
[1:02:33] about and this land will
[1:02:35] your possession it will be your
[1:02:38] inheritance to you and your seed after
[1:02:41] you now hear Abraham to think of this
[1:02:44] you know an inheritance let me just deal
[1:02:47] with that word just for a moment the
[1:02:49] word inheritance it is something that
[1:02:52] belongs to you that has belonged to your
[1:02:55] family that has belonged to previous
[1:02:58] generations it's something that is
[1:03:01] handed down that's what an inheritance
[1:03:04] is an inheritance itself there are
[1:03:07] things that you know and just speaking
[1:03:10] on a very natural and carnal level there
[1:03:13] are things that some of us may have that
[1:03:16] we hold in our possession that things
[1:03:18] that maybe you never even met you know
[1:03:21] your auntie or your uncle or your you
[1:03:24] know your your grandma or your grandpa
[1:03:26] your great-great-great you never even
[1:03:28] met them but you hold in your possession
[1:03:30] somebody has told you this belonged to
[1:03:32] them
[1:03:33] this is what they wore on their wedding
[1:03:35] day this is what it is something that is
[1:03:37] of a valued treasure that has been
[1:03:39] passed down from generation to
[1:03:42] generation and yet you know when we look
[1:03:45] at it in the natural you can find people
[1:03:47] in the natural that sometimes you know
[1:03:49] we can say like this some people don't
[1:03:52] even have a sentimental value and I'm
[1:03:53] not here to preach on that I'm here just
[1:03:55] to show you that in the natural it can
[1:03:58] only run so far but when God has
[1:04:00] declared an inheritance there is nothing
[1:04:04] that can take away your inheritance that
[1:04:07] rightfully belongs to you and you may
[1:04:12] not even realize you've got an
[1:04:14] inheritance but that doesn't change that
[1:04:17] to have an inheritance you just need to
[1:04:20] be in the place to hear the words of the
[1:04:24] inheritance and the life of that being
[1:04:27] proclaimed and then you realize I have
[1:04:30] an inheritance so when we see this that
[1:04:36] an inheritance itself is something that
[1:04:39] remains in the family
[1:04:42] to whom it is given it must remain in
[1:04:46] the family to whom it is given this is
[1:04:49] why Abraham if I can refer to this in
[1:04:52] Genesis 15 when God has already now he's
[1:04:56] been in the land there's been time and
[1:04:58] Abraham asks God the question
[1:05:01] whereby shall I know that I shall
[1:05:05] inherit this land Abraham knew I'm
[1:05:09] dwelling on it right now but you said
[1:05:12] that this land belongs to me and my seed
[1:05:15] what's Abraham saying I want to know who
[1:05:18] my seed is because remember what is his
[1:05:23] what is his his inheritance it will be
[1:05:26] that which will be passed to his seed
[1:05:29] from generation to generation and that's
[1:05:32] why Abraham asked the question about all
[1:05:35] that he can see Eliezer is here as
[1:05:37] should it be Eliezer and God lets him
[1:05:40] know no it is one that shall be born
[1:05:45] from thy own loins this was the mystery
[1:05:49] that God was expressing through
[1:05:52] Abraham's life that even God's own
[1:05:56] inheritors those of his children would
[1:06:00] not be something outside of him but were
[1:06:03] ordained in his own loins the loins of
[1:06:07] his mind and that is why the Prophet
[1:06:10] could tell us he said when God when the
[1:06:13] Word was made flesh he said we were
[1:06:16] transferred from the loins of God's mind
[1:06:19] into the loins of Jesus we were there
[1:06:25] dwelling in that life you'd understand
[1:06:27] how we were identified when he walked
[1:06:31] upon this earth when the word was made
[1:06:34] flesh when he went to Calvary I paid a
[1:06:40] made me pay for my sins there in that
[1:06:43] body when he got up on that Easter
[1:06:46] morning we got up with her
[1:06:50] we are represented in this inheritance
[1:06:58] that is why Abraham would ask the
[1:07:01] question whereby shall I know that I
[1:07:05] shall inherit them God answers the
[1:07:08] question by taking him to the sacrifice
[1:07:13] how shall I inherited through the
[1:07:16] sacrifice there's God to come of the
[1:07:21] sacrifice and God noticed through the
[1:07:23] sacrifice there is also the unfolding of
[1:07:27] the Covenant oh my god God is committing
[1:07:31] himself to his word for he is the word
[1:07:36] when God has given a promise he commits
[1:07:40] himself it didn't like you and I are I
[1:07:43] say and you're Payton call me up I'll
[1:07:45] help you out and then you call me up I
[1:07:46] said huh you know what my back's been
[1:07:48] bothering me I wear this or that I'm a
[1:07:49] no Claude is committed to his word when
[1:07:54] God speaks his word his life his nature
[1:07:57] his substance his character he is there
[1:08:01] within that word and God let him know
[1:08:08] you're see I want you to know this your
[1:08:13] seat is going to be a stranger in a land
[1:08:17] that's not theirs Claude was letting him
[1:08:21] know there be a departing from the land
[1:08:26] but I want you to know your seed they'll
[1:08:30] be in a stranger in a strange land but I
[1:08:34] want you to know I will bring your seed
[1:08:36] back home this is their land this is
[1:08:40] their land God was letting him know how
[1:08:43] did they become a seed in a strange land
[1:08:47] they were sold into slavery here Joseph
[1:08:53] he rejected his rejected of his brother
[1:08:57] so because of the rejection Israel
[1:09:00] dispersed here they go they come down
[1:09:02] into Egypt right when you move ahead
[1:09:07] when Israel rejected the Messiah they
[1:09:11] were dispersed throughout the world but
[1:09:15] that never changed God's mind concerning
[1:09:17] them it never changed God's mind because
[1:09:22] God had already declared through the Old
[1:09:25] Testament prophets I will bring you back
[1:09:28] to your land
[1:09:30] [Applause]
[1:09:40] hallelujah God's mind cannot be changed
[1:09:47] it cannot be changed and he said I will
[1:09:54] bring them back into this land this is
[1:09:58] why here
[1:09:59] you know the Prophet would make in the
[1:10:03] message the third Exodus he would
[1:10:05] express to us and say why were they even
[1:10:09] down in Egypt
[1:10:11] why would God's people be out of that
[1:10:14] land after all that God promised right
[1:10:18] there with Abraham Isaac and Jacob their
[1:10:21] God gave them that land and said this is
[1:10:24] it I want you to think of this for a
[1:10:27] moment
[1:10:28] Satan has thought to try to keep them
[1:10:32] out of that land I'm not going to preach
[1:10:36] on all that this morning but he has
[1:10:37] to try to keep them out of that
[1:10:39] land but let me just tell you something
[1:10:41] and let me just remind the devil
[1:10:43] you can put up all the barricades you
[1:10:46] can try to put up all these false
[1:10:47] boundaries you can try to make peace
[1:10:49] pacts and everything else but you can't
[1:10:52] stop God from fulfilling his word he
[1:10:56] will bring his seed back home he can try
[1:11:05] to put all sorts of condemnation and
[1:11:08] everything else but you cannot stop God
[1:11:11] from fulfilling his word

[1:11:18] them out of the graves I'll bring them
[1:11:20] back to me I'll draw that back to me God
[1:11:27] gave them that land just even recently
[1:11:32] they found the artifacts of David right
[1:11:35] on the Temple Mount just here within
[1:11:38] just a couple days ago they found it
[1:11:40] right there I'm telling you it's buried
[1:11:43] [Applause]
[1:11:45] inscriptions are buried in the earth
[1:11:48] that show this land belongs to Israel
[1:11:53] and there was a sea and a seed in you
[1:11:56] and me that always identify this belongs
[1:12:00] to God and God by the power of the Holy
[1:12:03] Ghost

[1:12:24] piece back you one and everything else

[1:12:35] border he belongs to me I don't want no
[1:12:39] little sliver I want everything that's
[1:12:45] the working of the Holy Ghost in our
[1:12:47] life he moves too I speak to you and I
[1:12:51] how rights and then when he comes into
[1:12:54] our life oh that is why as a child of
[1:12:56] God you cannot be complacent if you even
[1:13:00] start to get complacent you begin to
[1:13:02] feel yourself thinking what's going on
[1:13:04] what's going on you who were ordained by
[1:13:07] God to occupy this land he meant that
[1:13:11] the Holy Ghost would have the right away
[1:13:14] the fullness of the Spirit of God
[1:13:16] working in your life and in my life
[1:13:23] brother branham tells us he said Oh God
[1:13:25] give us a Pentecost he gave us the book
[1:13:29] of Acts he give us the Holy Spirit to
[1:13:31] lead and guide us he give us a land and
[1:13:34] why are we out of it the Lord visited
[1:13:43] according to the promise that he made to
[1:13:46] Abraham he visited his seed he went down
[1:13:52] to each of you see according to his word
[1:13:54] a promise was laying there
[1:13:58] when desperation began to set in on the
[1:14:02] people's hearts they began to pray and
[1:14:05] ask and ask for God to fulfill his word
[1:14:11] God comes down and he makes the promise
[1:14:14] a living reality in the heart of Moses
[1:14:19] in Exodus 3 God speaks this promise into
[1:14:24] the heart of Moses and Moses I want you
[1:14:28] to catch this now here is a burning bush
[1:14:30] and yet a bush that here a fire
[1:14:33] enveloping but yet the bush is not
[1:14:36] consumed but the fire that was there in
[1:14:40] that bush came out of that bush and went
[1:14:43] into the bosom of Moses Moses went down
[1:14:47] to Egypt veiling God to the people are
[1:14:51] you with me that word that God had given
[1:14:54] in that hour that was a word that God
[1:14:56] through the lips of his prophet he would
[1:14:59] honor that sound he would blow that
[1:15:01] ram's horn he would blow that shofar
[1:15:04] that announces that the Lord God he has
[1:15:07] remembered his promise and I am the
[1:15:10] or come down to deliver my people go
[1:15:16] moses you'll be my spokesman the call
[1:15:25] the message that went forth was to call
[1:15:29] him out of egypt and call them to their
[1:15:33] inheritance bring them out and take them
[1:15:37] in that's the message bring them out
[1:15:39] take them in amen to come out of the
[1:15:43] land you're in and into the land of
[1:15:46] promise amen
[1:15:48] to ought to the adoption to the
[1:15:50] inheritance of the children of israel
[1:15:53] the natural seed of abraham you see this
[1:16:01] this would repeat we're in it israel now
[1:16:06] coming into the land here they are in
[1:16:10] the land they crawl so now here they
[1:16:12] cross into the land but now once in the
[1:16:15] land you find that things started
[1:16:20] getting loose israel begins to take for
[1:16:24] granted the land that they're living in
[1:16:27] they begin to take for granted the grace
[1:16:29] of god that's been given to him remember
[1:16:31] God's grace brother Tim was reading that
[1:16:34] hair out of the book of Deuteronomy I'd
[1:16:35] give you houses that you didn't even
[1:16:36] build I'll give you a Wells that you
[1:16:39] didn't dig I'll give you vineyards that
[1:16:40] you didn't plant what was that
[1:16:43] grace not because they deserved it not
[1:16:47] because you and I deserve it it's the
[1:16:49] grace of God what God has given to you
[1:16:52] and I this is in our inheritance and
[1:17:00] when it came to this place in Israel
[1:17:03] begin to get away from the fountains of
[1:17:06] living water I hope you with me they
[1:17:09] were getting away from the fountains of
[1:17:12] living water they were drifting from
[1:17:15] that life and they begin to hew to
[1:17:17] themselves broken cisterns
[1:17:20] broken cisterns cannot bring cleansing
[1:17:24] it cannot bring healing there's only one
[1:17:28] thing that can do that and that's a
[1:17:30] fountain that's open amen
[1:17:34] that's only one thing that can do that
[1:17:37] in our life and that's that fountain
[1:17:39] that has been opened the Lord Jesus
[1:17:42] Christ in the pouring out of his life
[1:17:45] and that's the same one that will be
[1:17:48] poured out on the 144,000 when vide is
[1:17:52] revealed to them that the fountain is
[1:17:54] open in the house of David Laura be
[1:18:01] declawed him and everything working hand
[1:18:04] in hand with the atonement God showed
[1:18:09] there was a dispersal that was coming
[1:18:12] through Jeremiah and remember God let it
[1:18:16] be known that this land it will be
[1:18:19] desolate she will have her Sabbath's she
[1:18:23] will enjoy all of that but this is what
[1:18:25] I want you to do Jeremiah I want you to
[1:18:27] go down there and I want you to purchase
[1:18:30] from your uncle that land that belongs
[1:18:33] to him I want you to redeem it by a
[1:18:35] purchase and I want you to make a
[1:18:37] signing of that a notary of that and
[1:18:40] place it in an earthen vessel and plant
[1:18:43] it in this land and then you'll have a
[1:18:45] written part out here what is hidden
[1:18:48] will correspond with what is out here
[1:18:51] amen it will be a declaration you know
[1:18:54] what God was saying that even in the
[1:18:56] midst of this dispersion what Israel is
[1:18:59] being taken captive I will bring them
[1:19:02] back home I will bring them back home
[1:19:10] hallelujah he chose to place this in an
[1:19:14] earthen vessel
[1:19:19] who is that earthen vessel the Lord
[1:19:22] Jesus Christ hey man that life because
[1:19:26] it's through him comes Redemption are
[1:19:31] you with me through him comes Redemption
[1:19:35] I'm not gonna get into Ruth right now
[1:19:38] but it's just an inheritance and
[1:19:45] inheritance in Leviticus 23 turn with me
[1:19:49] there would you please and Leviticus 23
[1:19:57] let's read just verses 9 through 11
[1:20:05] Leviticus 23 9 through 11
[1:20:14] and the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[1:20:16] speak unto the children of Israel and
[1:20:20] say unto them when you become into the
[1:20:23] land which I give unto you and shall
[1:20:26] reap the harvest thereof then you shall
[1:20:29] bring a sheet of the firstfruits of your
[1:20:31] harvest unto the priest and he shall
[1:20:34] wave the sheaf before the Lord to be
[1:20:37] accepted for you on the morrow after the
[1:20:40] Sabbath the priest shall wave it that
[1:20:45] wave sheaf was indeed the Lord Jesus
[1:20:51] Christ he raised on the eighth day he
[1:20:56] raised on the day after the after the
[1:20:59] Sabbath he was raised and it was
[1:21:02] presented notice one who had went in the
[1:21:05] ground now one that had come to maturity
[1:21:07] and that wave sheaf that that stalk of
[1:21:11] wheat right there where everything was
[1:21:13] fully right it was that full
[1:21:15] manifestation that was being way that
[1:21:18] there are more seeds in this field just
[1:21:22] like this one
[1:21:24] hey man there's more just like this one
[1:21:28] and that was wave to be it set to there
[1:21:33] before the Lord
[1:21:34] now the Bible goes on here if we drop
[1:21:37] down into verse 15 here verse 15 and ye
[1:21:41] shall count unto you from the morrow
[1:21:43] after the Sabbath from the day that you
[1:21:46] brought the sheath of the wave offering
[1:21:47] seven Sabbath's shall be complete even
[1:21:51] unto the morrow after the seventh
[1:21:53] Sabbath shall be a number fifty days and
[1:21:56] you shall offer a new meat offering unto
[1:21:59] the Lord you shall bring out of your
[1:22:01] habitations two wave lows of two tenths
[1:22:04] deals and they shall be of time flour
[1:22:07] they shall be bacon with eleven they are
[1:22:10] the firstfruits unto the Lord
[1:22:13] he was the firstfruits that rose
[1:22:17] they meant that resurrection but that
[1:22:20] resurrection on the day of Pentecost
[1:22:23] that way she was weighed upon them that
[1:22:27] same life that brought him out of the
[1:22:31] grave and raised him up is that same
[1:22:34] life that's now waived upon the
[1:22:36] worshipers at the day of Pentecost they
[1:22:40] met and they are recipients of that
[1:22:43] light now I want you to look at this
[1:22:44] here what God declares on the day of
[1:22:47] Pentecost here is two wave laws having
[1:22:53] that same see that same life inside of
[1:22:57] those wave lows but no longer loosely
[1:23:01] sheaves that are bound together by a
[1:23:04] cord but now the seed has been gathered
[1:23:07] together in unity this is what the
[1:23:11] scripture says they were in one place in
[1:23:15] one mind in one Accord and the Holy
[1:23:18] Ghost proper unity it brought the
[1:23:21] quickening it moved that seat to him
[1:23:24] became bread and that bread was rolling
[1:23:31] down through the camp and tearing things
[1:23:33] up are you listening here's a repeat of
[1:23:37] Gideon's day in that hour what he was in
[1:23:41] the alphabet he is in the Omega bride
[1:23:47] same life rolling in the hearts other
[1:23:50] believer they men that same brand that's
[1:23:54] been promised in this hour
[1:23:55] not a crumb but the bread himself to
[1:24:05] wave loaves I don't want to dwell on
[1:24:06] this a lot because I could I could
[1:24:08] preach days on some of this right here
[1:24:10] you know by God's grace I just love the
[1:24:12] Word of God don't you but the Bible says
[1:24:14] you make it with fine flour now how do
[1:24:16] you know what fine flour you stick your
[1:24:19] hand down in it
[1:24:20] and you know it's fine flour when it's
[1:24:23] sticky I mean it sticks to you that's
[1:24:28] the mystery skill the stickiness but on
[1:24:30] the inside there is that life on the
[1:24:35] inside your sweet life come on somebody
[1:24:40] the Lord be to God
[1:24:42] Oh so here the Lord well I want to get
[1:24:47] you to this to this point here the Lord
[1:24:49] would bring Israel into this land of
[1:24:52] promise from a natural land into a
[1:24:55] natural promised land Israel remember
[1:25:03] they had got away what God had given
[1:25:06] them remember he promised that he would
[1:25:08] bring them into the land when the Israel
[1:25:11] came out of Egypt the wilderness was not
[1:25:13] the promise they they were happy ain't
[1:25:21] nothing wrong with being happy they
[1:25:23] danced on the red sea shore they should
[1:25:25] have danced I mean when you see that
[1:25:30] your enemy is washed up on the shore
[1:25:32] behind you you ought to cut a spell but
[1:25:35] that tells us and you read in the
[1:25:36] scripture it wasn't until when Moses and
[1:25:39] them saw the dead Egyptians wash up on
[1:25:42] the shore that they begin to dance they
[1:25:45] begin to see they begin to praise God
[1:25:48] when they saw their enemy that had been
[1:25:51] chasing them and pursuing them and
[1:25:54] threatening to bring them into bondage
[1:25:56] but brother here came the redemptive
[1:25:58] power of God and it opened up that red
[1:26:01] sea what was it it was God manifesting
[1:26:04] his name when he opened up the Red Sea
[1:26:07] he manifests his strength so much that
[1:26:10] the Bible says in the book of Isaiah
[1:26:12] chapter 51 that when he parted the Red
[1:26:15] Sea the waves cried out the Lord of
[1:26:18] Hosts is his name the Lord is his name
[1:26:25] the parting the opening is through his
[1:26:28] name he declares his name hallelu they
[1:26:38] weren't in their land yet they were in
[1:26:39] the wilderness but God notice they came
[1:26:46] up to that place and Kadish and they
[1:26:49] said we're not able to do it I'm gonna
[1:26:53] agree with the fact if you're looking at
[1:26:56] your natural ability and with those 10
[1:26:58] spies
[1:26:59] we're not able to do it I agree but how
[1:27:02] can you forget but God that talks you
[1:27:05] out of each other how can you forget the
[1:27:08] God who opened the Red Sea how can you
[1:27:11] forget the God who fats you when you
[1:27:13] were hungry how can you forget the God
[1:27:15] who supply turning bitter water into
[1:27:18] sweet water how can you forget the God
[1:27:21] who took a rock and he brought forth
[1:27:23] water out of that rock all of that was
[1:27:27] to build faith in the Living God that
[1:27:30] was there in their midst I will send my
[1:27:35] angel before thee to keep thee in the
[1:27:40] way and to bring thee into the place
[1:27:42] that I have prepared for thee hallelujah
[1:27:50] he would take them in by redemptive
[1:27:53] power God let me remember on some of the
[1:27:59] Thursday nights when I read that quote
[1:28:00] really been stirred sometimes my
[1:28:02] children get up on my lap he said they
[1:28:04] go to you know squeeze and mom said boy
[1:28:06] daddy's got big muscles
[1:28:08] brother BAM said I said that kinda makes
[1:28:10] me feel a little good when they do that
[1:28:12] he said well you know what God likes his
[1:28:15] children he likes to show he's got big
[1:28:17] muscles
[1:28:19] he likes to display when situations get
[1:28:23] into a dire straight that's when he
[1:28:25] shows up rather when there's no other
[1:28:27] hope when there's no other place to turn
[1:28:30] this is where God said this is just
[1:28:32] where I want you I'm gonna make known
[1:28:35] that power concerning you
[1:28:38] he loves to flex his muscles
[1:28:42] he loves to demonstrate his power here
[1:28:53] they were as a people they're walking in
[1:28:56] this place in the land in the wilderness
[1:28:59] already resting in their bosom here they
[1:29:05] were born Israelites they were born
[1:29:09] Hebrews they were born Jews are you with
[1:29:13] me
[1:29:13] they were born that then they're just in
[1:29:15] that birth they have that heritage they
[1:29:18] already have that inheritance they just
[1:29:21] needed someone to bring them to their
[1:29:25] inheritance they could read in there and
[1:29:29] say oh my my father Abraham Kayla could
[1:29:33] say my father Abraham you think I'm a
[1:29:35] preacher now you think the devil didn't
[1:29:37] get right up next to Caleb and say hey
[1:29:39] buddy
[1:29:39] have you ever checked out your DNA you
[1:29:43] were checked out your verse were you
[1:29:44] ever checked out your birth certificate
[1:29:45] come on I'm not fooling a political move
[1:29:48] around talking my thing serious now have
[1:29:49] you ever checked out your birth
[1:29:50] certificate you were born on hmm a keen
[1:29:54] insight and God said that he would give
[1:29:58] the land to the seed he would give the
[1:30:00] land of the kinna sites if I know him if
[1:30:04] I recall correctly that wouldn't make
[1:30:05] Caleb that your great granddaddy would
[1:30:09] have been Esau
[1:30:10] and he saw was a rejecter of the
[1:30:13] birthright but there was something
[1:30:18] greater inside a Caleb that Caleb said I
[1:30:22] refuse to be identified by my natural
[1:30:25] family tree I refuse to be identified
[1:30:30] there I'm a son of Abraham the son of
[1:30:33] Abraham I've got an inheritance says
[1:30:37] I've got a lamb they're Calif you can't
[1:30:43] have it you're nothing but a dog but the
[1:30:45] dog takes the crumbs from the master's
[1:30:48] table there's something ringing in my
[1:30:52] heart and God God God chose Caleb to
[1:30:58] represent Judah hello I tell you there
[1:31:07] was something deeper than just his
[1:31:09] natural birth Caleb was the son of
[1:31:14] Abraham
[1:31:15] [Applause]
[1:31:18] he is our type Caleb so you're
[1:31:30] representing Judah you know so I think
[1:31:34] you something special
[1:31:35] no God said that so where do you think
[1:31:39] your inheritance is where dude is that
[1:31:42] where Jew does that that's my
[1:31:45] inheritance
[1:31:47] [Applause]
[1:31:49] so when Caleb think of this think of
[1:31:52] this he it was not his natural abilities
[1:31:56] he was not walking around with footsteps
[1:31:59] in possession on the land because it was
[1:32:02] something naturally belonging to him but
[1:32:05] it was a spiritual revelation where
[1:32:08] Caleb identified himself with the Word
[1:32:11] of God and the moving of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:13] in that hour he said if Tom be for us
[1:32:18] who can be against us
[1:32:22] that's that true Gentile that just like
[1:32:26] truth the Bible says we love Naomi they
[1:32:32] men the odds Naomi standing there with
[1:32:36] that same promise I wish I could preach
[1:32:41] that defeasance warn our inheritance
[1:32:47] already they in Christ in God before the
[1:32:54] foundation of the world when Israel and
[1:33:00] then patriarchs when here they were
[1:33:01] being birthed as we said last week when
[1:33:03] they were being birthed when there's a
[1:33:05] mid when they were crying out that name
[1:33:08] positionally placed them in the Land of
[1:33:11] Israel and you and I in the loins of
[1:33:16] God's mother when God was giving birth
[1:33:20] to himself to his world in the beginning
[1:33:24] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:33:27] and the Word was God
[1:33:30] they meant God giving birth to his
[1:33:33] children by his world we are
[1:33:37] positionally placed in Christ from
[1:33:40] before the foundation of the world we
[1:33:42] already have an inheritance as clear as
[1:33:49] clear can be but the man said God knew
[1:33:51] I'd be standing at the pulpit tonight he
[1:33:54] knew the text I read and he said he knew
[1:33:57] you would be here and he said God knew
[1:34:00] you'd be desiring the Holy Ghost so God
[1:34:03] made a way that you could receive the
[1:34:06] Holy Ghost why it was a call come back
[1:34:13] home come back home
[1:34:21] our inheritance our inheritance by
[1:34:26] predestination you can read that in
[1:34:27] Ephesians one I I don't have time to
[1:34:29] deal with it but in Ephesians 1 3
[1:34:32] through 6
[1:34:32] he has predestinated us unto the
[1:34:36] adoption the placement of children by
[1:34:39] Jesus Christ to himself for us to come
[1:34:44] into that place God had to become man in
[1:34:48] order to bring us back home in order to
[1:34:52] bring us back to our inheritance this is
[1:34:55] why brother Branham I had the quote in
[1:34:57] front of me but just let me refer to it
[1:34:58] he said what was first here he said God
[1:35:02] give you your inheritance your
[1:35:04] inheritance was first he said Jesus
[1:35:07] never left me an inheritance jesus never
[1:35:09] left you an inheritance he only came
[1:35:12] down and paid for your inheritance and
[1:35:14] brought you to your inheritance see what
[1:35:18] already but all there you understand
[1:35:20] here he came down and here the earthen
[1:35:23] vessel it has within it that inheritance
[1:35:27] that's been inscribed to you and I that
[1:35:30] points to your coming back to the land
[1:35:32] of what God chose you to be before the
[1:35:36] foundation of the world and in the earth
[1:35:39] and vessel he declares to you the land
[1:35:42] that belongs to you you're with me you
[1:35:49] having a good time
[1:35:52] [Applause]
[1:35:53] well my now here a new generation look
[1:36:00] how God everything is so complete in his
[1:36:03] word here you find when the new
[1:36:06] generation crosses in Joshua 5 you look
[1:36:09] when the new generation when they crawl
[1:36:11] so maybe I've just referred to it and
[1:36:12] stood arena but I got a turn there
[1:36:14] Joshua 5 and you know when they came
[1:36:17] into the land in Joshua 5 maybe you can
[1:36:19] read it when you get home but in Joshua
[1:36:22] 5 when they came in the land now here
[1:36:24] after coming into the land God begins to
[1:36:27] declare - a - Joshua
[1:36:29] he said the children are not bearing the
[1:36:32] sea
[1:36:33] of the Covenant in their flesh there was
[1:36:36] neglect in the years of warning or
[1:36:39] wandering and God let's say no
[1:36:42] he tells Joshua I want you to make sharp
[1:36:45] knives it shows there was necessary
[1:36:51] material that could be made sharp that
[1:36:55] can absolutely remove the reproach of
[1:36:58] Egypt off the lives of the children of
[1:37:00] Israel something that would be able to
[1:37:03] sever them from their past they may be
[1:37:07] able to cut it away from their past to
[1:37:10] wear now that circumcision that seal
[1:37:13] would be identified in their flesh
[1:37:16] listen to me now that seal being
[1:37:18] identified in the flesh was a sign of
[1:37:21] the Abrahamic covenant when they went
[1:37:23] into battle they were going to battle
[1:37:26] with the authority of the seal and the
[1:37:28] circumcision on their life that's why
[1:37:33] when the Holy Ghost is come brother
[1:37:36] it takes that word and it's circumcised
[1:37:39] as you and I it cuts away the surplus
[1:37:42] flesh it separates you from your first
[1:37:45] birth so in needs arise and you're
[1:37:49] praying for needs praying for loved ones
[1:37:51] praying for situation you present that
[1:37:55] token with your unwavering faith you're
[1:37:58] standing on solid ground as a son and
[1:38:01] daughter of Abraham I've got a covenant
[1:38:04] I'm in the Covenant
[1:38:15] maybe Shamgar this morning would be the
[1:38:18] morning for God to direct you to the ox
[1:38:20] goes you get to remember I want made to
[1:38:26] be the tale I made to be the head
[1:38:31] God did not save you and fill you with
[1:38:34] the Holy Ghost for you to be the devil's
[1:38:35] punching bag you standing as a soldier
[1:38:41] son and daughter of God you're equipped
[1:38:43] with the power of God in your life your
[1:38:46] acquit brother let me tell you something
[1:38:48] that little policeman standing on the
[1:38:50] corner then cars would run him over
[1:38:53] brother racecar would run him over
[1:38:56] but that little policeman right there
[1:38:58] could stand there and say stop brother
[1:39:02] he may not look like much but he's got
[1:39:05] the backing of City Hall
[1:39:07] he's got the backing of the mayor and
[1:39:09] let me tell you something as a son of
[1:39:10] God it's not you and I that heels to sit
[1:39:13] it's not us to change the situation it's
[1:39:15] not us who saves the loss it's not us
[1:39:18] who delivers and feels it is the Lord
[1:39:21] Jesus Christ we have an authority in his
[1:39:26] presence you see this was also showing
[1:39:37] that even as you and I think about it
[1:39:41] here where they're children how many
[1:39:46] years the Prophet been gone 54 years now
[1:39:49] 54 years almost a generation is how many
[1:39:53] years 44 the brem says if there is
[1:39:56] another generation every generation has
[1:40:02] got to have the same visitation children
[1:40:07] and different ones born in within the
[1:40:09] message things around our ranks but
[1:40:11] brother this is where God gave the
[1:40:13] promise your family your children others
[1:40:16] have crossed over but you also must be
[1:40:19] circumcised
[1:40:23] aren't you glad for that but they
[1:40:26] received the same experience with the
[1:40:29] same toxicity with the same power that
[1:40:32] you received in your life let me tell
[1:40:35] you something that's what Peter said
[1:40:37] when he declared by the Spirit of God
[1:40:39] the promise listen to you and to your
[1:40:41] children and to them that's far off as
[1:40:44] many as the Lord our God shall fall

[1:40:50] say as many as the Lord our God shall
[1:40:52] call this is - my children as well for
[1:40:58] my household believe and die in the
[1:41:01] house shall be saved you don't know how
[1:41:09] way where they are think about our way

[1:43:58] Holy Ghost it can take a life that feels
[1:44:03] so broken it can take that in the
[1:44:07] sounding of that they can take to skip

[1:44:41] be bondage that would come in and
[1:44:45] falling from an inheritance

[1:44:50] every 50 years are you with me

[1:44:56] pointing to the true Jubilee that was to

[1:49:09] when they came into the land as we said
[1:49:13] before they came into the land and you
[1:49:17] know here we go same with Jeremiah they
[1:49:20] got taken with Creed's and dogmas they
[1:49:26] got their eyes off of the life source
[1:49:29] are you with me they got their eyes and
[1:49:34] they started focusing on how to raise
[1:49:36] grain God said take it he laid it all
[1:49:39] out in the word planet you keep your
[1:49:42] focus on me
[1:49:43] it's what brother Tim Newman's was
[1:49:45] preaching you keep your focus on me I
[1:49:47] got your back I take care of you seek
[1:49:51] you first the kingdom of God and all
[1:49:52] these other things will be added unto
[1:49:54] you but you get your focus when you try
[1:49:57] to be the best gardener in in the town
[1:49:59] then you get your focus off of him who
[1:50:01] is the life giver of the seeds that are
[1:50:04] in your life well I can do this and I
[1:50:07] can do this I'm gonna really try to do
[1:50:09] this you're gonna blow your head apart
[1:50:12] trying to do that
[1:50:13] you can't do it it takes him to bring
[1:50:17] his word to life inside of you and I it
[1:50:20] takes him to supply the rain it takes
[1:50:23] him the same one Gomorrah that Sosa's
[1:50:26] were in our heart it takes a hole in our
[1:50:28] heart we say Oh Lord Jesus thank you for
[1:50:31] your word we water with praise we water
[1:50:33] it in the light of the word we water it
[1:50:36] and then here he comes in the latter
[1:50:37] rain a time for the maturing of the
[1:50:40] seeds he's sown in our life and it comes
[1:50:42] to fruition within our life then what do
[1:50:46] we do harvest eat and so back so back
[1:50:54] that's the whole principle in
[1:50:56] Revelations 10 8 through 11
[1:50:59] it's the word continuing to come to
[1:51:03] maturity in our life
[1:51:05] [Applause]

[1:53:44] Living God he subdividing himself into
[1:53:48] his people it was no longer God above us

[1:56:24] out of there on the day of Pentecost
[1:56:27] brother they received on the day of
[1:56:29] Pentecost the abstract of the title deed

[1:56:35] Holy Ghost is mine let me speak to you
[1:56:39] this morning if what you've got is a
[1:56:40] title deed don't you throw that thing

[1:57:18] abstract it cleared everything that was
[1:57:22] against it the devil could have had all
[1:57:26] of this condemnation living over but
[1:57:28] then when the abstract comes it removes
[1:57:30] all of that why because it takes you
[1:57:33] from where you're at and put you into
[1:57:36] the land which always belong to you
[1:57:39] and that's why you can never be
[1:57:42] satisfied outside of Christ because in

[2:02:26] you see there's got to be a word that
[2:02:29] ministers our inheritance to you and I
[2:02:32] and that word that ministers our
[2:02:34] inheritance to you and I what does it do
[2:02:35] it builds faith within us to rise out of
[2:02:38] the barnyard it's building faith in Him
[2:02:41] that you realize I always was a son I
[2:02:43] always was a daughter then you can rise
[2:02:46] up and realize it's not your
[2:02:48] righteousness it's not your worthiness
[2:02:51] him that gives you the gift of the Holy
[2:02:54] Ghost hallelu the grounds that belong to
[2:03:01] us as believers now Singh to you and I

[2:03:42] wants to try to put sickness on you try
[2:03:44] to put torment on you try to put
[2:03:46] something on you you can stand there and
[2:03:47] say as a daughter of Abraham as a son of

[2:04:38] mine they always belong to me and I have
[2:04:43] brought them back to me
