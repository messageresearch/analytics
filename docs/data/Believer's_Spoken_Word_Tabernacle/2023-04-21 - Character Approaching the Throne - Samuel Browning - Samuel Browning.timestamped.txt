[42:17] but I'm glad it won't be on time but oh
[42:21] what rejoicing that we'll have then
[42:24] and why wait let's start now
[42:26] amen I just ask that the Lord will help
[42:29] us tonight we I want to just look at
[42:31] something here as we've been looking at
[42:34] Divine love and
[42:35] I come across this it was last year and
[42:38] I didn't even really you know it didn't
[42:40] didn't remember it or think of it but
[42:43] you know God has a timing on everything
[42:45] and I got to studying some weeks back on
[42:48] that of just looking more and sometimes
[42:51] I just pour over uh quotes on certain
[42:54] phrases and I ran across this and it
[42:56] brought everything back to my mind and
[42:59] then here I am I have all this placed in
[43:02] this moment and just a thought that I
[43:05] want to speak on tonight is still with
[43:08] that of a useful life but I want to
[43:10] speak on the thought of a character
[43:13] nearing the throne
[43:15] character nearing the throne because
[43:19] remember when we look at the time and
[43:21] the age that we're in in Revelations 3.
[43:24] the Lord Jesus here he is put out of the
[43:27] church
[43:28] he's uh he's a refuge he's out he's been
[43:33] put out they don't want him
[43:35] and here he is but you know in the midst
[43:38] of that time when he's been put out
[43:39] there's a group of people that's hurt
[43:41] him not personally to their hearts
[43:44] so the message has not come in vain the
[43:47] message Has Come Together the Mighty Men
[43:51] of God
[43:53] it's come together God's subject oh I'm
[43:55] sure that we as far as to the world
[43:57] standards and even if we would look in
[44:00] our own selves in the mirror we would
[44:01] not classify ourselves as mighty men but
[44:04] you know that just comes with the
[44:05] territory Gideon himself didn't think of
[44:08] himself to be a mighty man but as he
[44:11] stayed in the presence of God his
[44:13] attitude began to change not of one of
[44:15] arrogance but where he began to accept
[44:17] what God knew about him
[44:21] and then perfect Faith he began to
[44:24] operate and rely upon what the word had
[44:27] made him and I believe that's what we're
[44:29] called to tonight
[44:30] because we're going we're on our journey
[44:32] to the throne
[44:34] blessed to him that overcometh for he
[44:37] shall set with me in my throne even as I
[44:41] have overcome
[44:42] and sat down with my father in his
[44:44] throne we're going somewhere we're at
[44:47] we're at we're at the time we're at the
[44:48] end and I want you to think of this I
[44:50] don't mean to keep you standing but
[44:51] before I read just a couple verses
[44:54] brother Branham takes that takes in the
[44:56] message how can overcome
[44:58] and it takes of that of that scripture
[45:01] where the mother of the sons of Zebedee
[45:04] sons of thunder remember she comes and
[45:06] asks granted that one of my sons will
[45:07] settle on the right and one on the left
[45:09] what an admirable request
[45:11] and Jesus said well that's not that
[45:13] place is not mine to give in other words
[45:16] it's not in a moment of giving it's
[45:18] already been given
[45:20] it's already been allotted but it'll
[45:22] have to come into that season
[45:24] and the question was can you drink of
[45:27] the cup that I drink of and they said
[45:29] yes yes and he said surely you shall
[45:32] they were going to be partakers of the
[45:35] cup of Salvation they were going to be
[45:36] partakers of the word and partakers of
[45:38] his life is that right but brother
[45:41] Branham took that scripture and how can
[45:42] overcome and he said see what it is he
[45:45] said the test had not Fallen
[45:48] and that's the test for the throne we're
[45:52] living in the time of the throne where
[45:53] the bride is standing on her feet the
[45:55] bride is on Earth here is the Queen the
[45:58] real queen right there's an imposter but
[46:00] there's a real queen as well and the
[46:02] real queen is identified by the word of
[46:05] God it is moving and flowing and living
[46:08] and pulsating through her life so it's
[46:10] not what she's claiming but her life is
[46:13] a vessel that God is vindicating his
[46:15] word through and that Vindication
[46:17] silences all doubt
[46:21] is that right so here we are living in
[46:23] this time and as we're nearing that
[46:26] character for the throne it's a time of
[46:28] our character being molded and the
[46:32] finishing touches coming on so let's
[46:33] read here just a moment
[46:35] and about character nearing the throne
[46:38] in verse 9 of first Samuel 25 it says
[46:41] and when David's young men came
[46:44] they speak to nabel according to all
[46:46] those words in the name of David and
[46:49] ceased
[46:51] I'm sorry I didn't give you a moment to
[46:53] turn there and that's my fault because
[46:55] it wasn't on the screen
[46:57] but here we have
[46:59] this is after the death of Samuel
[47:02] we have that where that David and them
[47:05] have come upon a place and a field and
[47:08] named neighbors
[47:10] um Shepherds or those that are keeping
[47:12] the sheep and shearing the Sheep are out
[47:14] at that time and David's men have come
[47:17] upon them but David's men have not come
[47:22] to harm them but rather they've
[47:24] protected them so now David remember as
[47:28] a fugitive he's on the run right Saul is
[47:32] chasing him he's being hunted down like
[47:34] a dog he's being chased and chased and
[47:37] Saul is coming after him but here in the
[47:40] midst of that time remember he's given
[47:42] abimelech had given him bread the sword
[47:44] of Goliath and so forth so here is David
[47:47] he is out at the mercies of those who
[47:50] are going to recognize and to be able to
[47:53] give to him so this is where the young
[47:56] men now that are with David are coming
[47:57] to Mabel's house to make requests so
[48:01] we'll just let you be seated may the
[48:03] Lord bless the reading of the word I've
[48:05] had you standing here just a few moments
[48:07] in verse 10 if we could keep him keep on
[48:10] reading enable answer David's servants
[48:13] and said
[48:15] who is David
[48:16] now he knows who you know he knows who
[48:18] David is but who is David
[48:21] who is he
[48:23] and who is this son of Jesse
[48:26] he's got attitude
[48:28] who is this and the kind of like so what
[48:32] there be many servants nowadays that
[48:35] break away every man from his master
[48:39] so who is Dave what has David looked at
[48:42] as a fugitive
[48:44] right right that's his view is viewed as
[48:47] a fugitive by so many within that of
[48:51] Israel remember David would go and here
[48:53] he is in this wood and there he is with
[48:55] his men and there would be people in
[48:58] that particular inheritance that would
[49:00] say to Saul hey David's up here come up
[49:04] here and get him
[49:05] God would direct David David would take
[49:07] off right then there was even a time to
[49:11] where it looked like that David was
[49:12] going to be overtaken by Saul at one
[49:15] point
[49:16] but there came an announcement the
[49:19] Philistines are making an invasion come
[49:21] quickly so Saul when he was you know at
[49:24] the point of overtaking David he was
[49:26] drawn away and I think when we can read
[49:29] this within David's life because much of
[49:32] the Psalms
[49:34] it's written of David's experiences
[49:38] and so what you're finding is that even
[49:40] where David would experience things it's
[49:42] very much like our life and our journey
[49:45] right now
[49:46] there's a lot of times like when you
[49:48] think of Saul and other things that is
[49:50] tried to overtake you
[49:52] many different things have tried to
[49:54] overtake you and sometimes it looked
[49:56] like there was no way out but God Made A
[50:00] Way
[50:01] because God's already anointed David to
[50:04] be king and there's nothing can change
[50:06] that
[50:07] that was in God's mind before the
[50:10] foundation of the world
[50:12] is that right
[50:13] it was not man who chose David but God
[50:17] said I've got a neighbor of thine that
[50:20] I've chosen and God sought out David
[50:23] even the prophet overlooked him
[50:28] but the word that the prophet was
[50:31] commissioned with didn't overlooking
[50:35] amen so this word that David has been
[50:38] Anointed with
[50:39] was not the word of a man
[50:42] but this word has sought David out
[50:45] and reality of where that Saul had
[50:48] rejected God and put God out and it's
[50:51] very simple how did Saul put God out and
[50:55] reject him he rejected him in the
[50:57] simplest of obedience
[50:59] it all started where he himself could
[51:03] not wait
[51:05] for Samuel to do what only Samuel was
[51:09] supposed to do you see it shows that
[51:11] even in that part of of kingship and
[51:15] ruling that God will test our patience
[51:18] right down to the very last moment
[51:22] but that is something to where the Lord
[51:24] Jesus said with patience
[51:27] possess she your souls
[51:30] so Saul and the spirit of God departs
[51:34] from Saul is that right the kingdom has
[51:37] departed but God finds a little vessel
[51:40] that was so overlooked he was the eighth
[51:43] son but God here in the anointing oil is
[51:48] poured upon David and if I can say it in
[51:51] this way and I know I've mentioned this
[51:53] before but God was going to come back
[51:56] into the camp of Israel and the presence
[52:00] of God was going to return through a
[52:02] yielded vessel
[52:05] Hallelujah you want it and you want we
[52:07] want to look at how that God moves in
[52:09] every circumstances say Lord let me just
[52:12] be a yielded vessel it doesn't matter my
[52:15] stature doesn't matter My Size Doesn't
[52:17] Matter my knowledge but I'm going to
[52:19] stand here based on my experience Lord
[52:22] with you that I know where I'm standing
[52:25] I know you've touched my life I know
[52:27] you've dealt with my life and I'm going
[52:29] to stand right here Lord as a yielded
[52:31] vessel May the presence of God come into
[52:34] this situation may the presence of God
[52:37] come back into this home May the
[52:39] presence of God come into this job make
[52:42] God's presence come here and you say
[52:43] what is that that's a Seed of Abraham
[52:46] because Abraham cannot change Sarah but
[52:49] the presence of God could change Sarah
[52:52] and bring a change in her life and
[52:55] Abraham said I will be a channel that
[52:58] Elohim can come into this tent and move
[53:01] according to his word
[53:03] God has done that in this generation and
[53:06] he's doing it in this generation through
[53:08] a many-membered bride so don't ever sell
[53:11] yourself short you're a chosen vessel
[53:15] you're a chosen vessel for the king to
[53:18] come in power
[53:19] you're a chosen vessel where the kingdom
[53:22] of God is wrapped up in your life to be
[53:24] made manifest through your life your
[53:26] conduct your actions your behavior and
[53:28] that one on the inside of us when he
[53:30] becomes incarnate we will crown him king
[53:33] of kings and Lord of lords
[53:36] so we know in whom we have believed and
[53:38] we're persuaded that he is able to keep
[53:40] that which is committed against that day
[53:43] so in verse 10 as we read he's asking
[53:46] the question who's David who's who's the
[53:48] son of Jesse there's many servants
[53:50] nowadays that break away from every
[53:52] every man is Master shall I then take my
[53:55] bread and my water this is Nable talking
[53:57] and my flesh that I've killed for my
[54:00] shears and give it unto men whom I know
[54:03] not wince they be
[54:05] so David's young men turned their way
[54:07] and went again and came and told all
[54:11] those sayings
[54:13] and David said unto his men gird ye on
[54:17] every man his sword and they girded on
[54:20] every man his sword and David also
[54:23] girded on his sword and there went up
[54:25] after David about 400 men and 200 Abode
[54:31] by the stuff
[54:33] let me just say this right here David is
[54:36] reacting to a report that's come his way
[54:41] is that right
[54:44] because David has done good to this man
[54:47] and this man has spit back in his face
[54:52] so David said we'll leave 200 behind and
[54:55] the rest come with me and bring your
[54:58] swords
[54:59] because we're going to take care of
[55:01] business
[55:04] but David
[55:05] is this your business
[55:07] or God's business
[55:10] is this what God wants or is this your
[55:13] flesh that stirred up
[55:15] come on I'm talking about character
[55:17] nearing the throne
[55:20] character nearing the throne
[55:24] verse 14. but one of the young men told
[55:27] Abigail
[55:29] Mabel's wife saying behold David sent
[55:31] Messengers out of the Wilderness to
[55:34] salute our master and he railed on them
[55:38] but the men
[55:40] were very good unto us now notice this
[55:42] testimony of a young man who's in Abel's
[55:44] house
[55:45] is making an appeal to Abigail
[55:48] and he's letting her know that what our
[55:50] master has done but here's his testimony
[55:52] in verse 15. the men were very good unto
[55:56] us
[55:57] and we were not hurt neither missed we
[56:00] anything as long as we were conversant
[56:03] with them when we were in the fields
[56:05] they were a wall unto us by night and
[56:10] day all the while we were with them
[56:12] keeping the Sheep now therefore know and
[56:16] consider that thou what that will do for
[56:19] evil is determined against our master
[56:22] and against all his household for he is
[56:25] such a son of bilio that a man cannot
[56:28] speak to him now notice
[56:30] this young man that is moved to speak to
[56:34] Abigail
[56:36] he sees judgment is impending
[56:39] it's coming Upon Our House
[56:42] David's coming because the way that our
[56:45] Master responded to him there can be
[56:48] nothing but judgment coming our way and
[56:51] I want you to catch this this young man
[56:53] this young man is not condoning the
[56:57] actions of his master
[57:01] he said he's the son of Belial and
[57:03] nobody can speak to him so what he
[57:06] belongs to and that of the false deities
[57:09] and everything else it's projecting
[57:11] itself through his life but here is a
[57:14] call for one what we've just read is a
[57:17] call for one to intercede it's a call
[57:21] let there be one to intercede on our
[57:24] behalf because they know judgment's
[57:27] coming we are still under his house and
[57:30] judgment's coming to the house they are
[57:32] appealing for an interceding and they're
[57:35] going to Abigail
[57:36] I want you to think in mind here that of
[57:39] how the spirit of God when Grace has
[57:42] moved down by Revelation to reveal to
[57:45] you and I what you and I are not
[57:48] deserving or worthy of and it really
[57:51] strikes our heart the real revelation of
[57:54] Jesus Christ strikes our heart that's
[57:56] what this message is all about then we
[57:58] realize that we were not worthy that it
[58:01] was God's grace that came and Drew us it
[58:03] was God's grace that has dealt with our
[58:05] life and where we are standing here
[58:07] today is not because we have brought
[58:09] ourselves here but we have yielded to
[58:12] the grace of God and that is why we are
[58:15] standing where we're standing because
[58:18] there was something in us that was even
[58:21] greater than our reasonings our
[58:23] imaginations it was the Seed of Abraham
[58:25] that was on the inside and God was
[58:28] pulling on that sea God was drawing upon
[58:31] that sea to bring it in position
[58:35] this is why the desire is to flee from
[58:38] the Wrath that is to come that's why I
[58:40] thank God there's a warning when we look
[58:42] all around us we see there are lives
[58:45] that are not even occupied or even
[58:48] thinking about or even have any desire
[58:50] to serve God or to be in the house of
[58:53] God to really give themselves to God
[58:55] there's no desire to do that I tell you
[58:58] if you have a desire to serve God you
[59:02] are the most blessed person upon the
[59:04] Earth tonight a desire to please God
[59:09] Hallelujah you are rich
[59:13] with a desire to please God
[59:19] because the way the spirit of this world
[59:21] is right now it's come to the
[59:23] Fulfillment of Prophecy every man is a
[59:25] lover of himself
[59:28] it's all about self but here is an in
[59:31] call for intercession and I I think of
[59:34] how that the revelation of the word
[59:35] works because then when the revelation
[59:38] of the word has come it does not cause
[59:40] us to where we become wrapped up in
[59:43] ourselves
[59:44] wrapped up in what we see but what we
[59:47] have received it now causes us like
[59:50] Abraham to say Lord if they're sturdy
[59:53] will you spare the city Lord if there's
[59:56] 20 will you spare the city if there's 10
[59:58] will you spare the city what is it once
[1:00:01] the word has come now
[1:00:03] it is the spirit of atonement that
[1:00:07] begins to intercede for others that are
[1:00:09] in need that don't even know they are in
[1:00:12] need
[1:00:13] aren't you glad you and I listen you
[1:00:16] might have set in The Message Church
[1:00:18] look I was raised up under this message
[1:00:20] but one day grace came and broke the
[1:00:23] veil from around my life till I realized
[1:00:25] I need more than a church I need more
[1:00:27] than a knowledge of this message but I
[1:00:30] need to meet the God of this message and
[1:00:34] I'm glad there was an intercession I'm
[1:00:37] glad there was a prayer that was made
[1:00:39] there in John 17 and echoed in this
[1:00:42] generation through the message of the
[1:00:45] hour that they might be one even as Thou
[1:00:48] Art In Me
[1:00:50] an intercessory prayer that is called
[1:00:53] out to pull Upon Our Lives
[1:00:56] same as Moses
[1:00:58] Hallelujah same as Daniel
[1:01:01] when Daniel made an intercessory of life
[1:01:04] remember if it was not for Daniel the
[1:01:08] whole Kingdom would have been destroyed
[1:01:12] Nebuchadnezzar told him the wise men get
[1:01:15] these fools out of here
[1:01:17] because I know what you're doing I know
[1:01:18] the tricks you're up to you don't know
[1:01:20] nothing you're only going to want me to
[1:01:21] tell you the dream and then you're going
[1:01:23] to go through and do all this and never
[1:01:25] can never say don't we're nothing we're
[1:01:27] not going to do it and we're just going
[1:01:28] to wipe it all out but Daniel stood up
[1:01:31] in that moment I ask you what gave
[1:01:34] Daniel that courage
[1:01:37] he didn't even have an answer to the
[1:01:40] problem
[1:01:41] he didn't even know the vision he didn't
[1:01:44] even know the interpretation but more
[1:01:46] important he knew the God who gives
[1:01:49] interpretations
[1:01:50] you may not know the situation you're
[1:01:53] facing tonight you may not see the
[1:01:55] outcome or the way out but let me tell
[1:01:57] you rest assured if you know that God is
[1:02:00] a Waymaker The God Who interprets
[1:02:03] circumstances and brings his children on
[1:02:06] top in Victory every time
[1:02:08] that I say rest
[1:02:11] rest
[1:02:12] in the very sovereignty and hand of
[1:02:15] almighty God
[1:02:17] Esther was drawn into a place of
[1:02:20] intercessory as well
[1:02:21] is that right
[1:02:23] sure she had to be reminded the position
[1:02:25] she was in
[1:02:27] but there was a messenger by the name of
[1:02:29] Mordecai that said you've not been
[1:02:31] placed in this position for just to
[1:02:33] forget about everything else and let
[1:02:35] things happen and Let It Go on as it is
[1:02:37] but you have come into the kingdom for
[1:02:40] such a time as this
[1:02:42] and Mordecai was a faithful messenger
[1:02:45] that spoke can I say this he spoke to
[1:02:48] the dilatoriness of Esther and he said
[1:02:51] if you don't rise up God will rise
[1:02:54] somebody up because he will not allow
[1:02:56] his purpose to be defeated
[1:02:59] Hallelujah
[1:03:00] I say God let me be that vessel tonight
[1:03:03] then how you feel God let me be the
[1:03:05] vessel why not me why not now why not
[1:03:08] ask
[1:03:12] then Abigail verse 18.
[1:03:15] she made haste
[1:03:17] and she took 200 Loaves and two bottles
[1:03:20] of wine and five sheep ready dressed and
[1:03:23] five measures of Parts corn and a
[1:03:25] hundred clusters of raisins and 200
[1:03:28] cakes of figs and laid them on assets
[1:03:31] boy that might make you hungry right now
[1:03:32] wouldn't it
[1:03:34] true I think that that was that was a
[1:03:37] traveling Golden Corral right there
[1:03:39] verse 19 not me it was a lot she got to
[1:03:43] feed all of you remember she got to feed
[1:03:44] David's men
[1:03:45] all right this is not sending them a
[1:03:47] little snack
[1:03:49] she's sending them what they had
[1:03:52] requested
[1:03:54] what her husband returned down and
[1:03:57] rejected she said I hear the king
[1:04:00] talking
[1:04:02] what the rest of the churches don't want
[1:04:04] to honor his requests but there is a
[1:04:07] bride on Earth that says I hear what the
[1:04:09] king's longing for
[1:04:11] and the church don't want to give it but
[1:04:13] I will honor I will surrender I will
[1:04:15] submit I will give Keep Jesus what King
[1:04:18] Jesus is longing for
[1:04:22] my mama I don't want to preach it so
[1:04:25] much I just want to lay in it but boy
[1:04:27] it's good to go with these things isn't
[1:04:29] it
[1:04:29] verse 19 and she said unto her servants
[1:04:33] go on before me behold I come after you
[1:04:37] but she told not her husband nabel
[1:04:39] you know just sometimes where you just
[1:04:42] don't let the right hand know what the
[1:04:43] left hand's doing
[1:04:45] what are you talking about I'm talking
[1:04:46] about character nearing the throne
[1:04:49] sometimes it's just
[1:04:51] we did we just don't say nothing just do
[1:04:54] it
[1:04:55] and it was so as she wrote on the ass
[1:04:57] that she came down by the covert of the
[1:04:59] hill and behold David and his men came
[1:05:01] down against her and she met them
[1:05:05] I want you to notice that as I said
[1:05:06] she's got a desire this this little lady
[1:05:09] named Abigail
[1:05:11] she's she's sending these gifts and
[1:05:14] everything that David's requested those
[1:05:16] she's married
[1:05:18] her first husband is still living
[1:05:22] she's still got her first husband right
[1:05:26] but the words dealing with her life
[1:05:28] while her first husband still living
[1:05:30] yeah
[1:05:32] come on now preach with me a little bit
[1:05:33] because the new birth is where that
[1:05:36] first husband
[1:05:37] dies and the spirit of God raises up
[1:05:40] that new man on the inside is that right
[1:05:44] that that's the second man Adam is that
[1:05:46] right but she got a first husband but
[1:05:48] you see she begins to hear his requests
[1:05:50] I tell you you see this is why the Bible
[1:05:53] said that he giveth the Holy Ghost to
[1:05:55] them that obey him it's to hear his
[1:05:58] voice he that happened here let him hear
[1:06:00] what the spirit is saying to the
[1:06:02] churches she had heard like Rahab and
[1:06:05] even the condition she was in she did
[1:06:08] not allow the condition to determine
[1:06:10] whether or not she could honor the
[1:06:12] King's request it didn't matter the
[1:06:15] house didn't matter how she was born it
[1:06:17] didn't matter none of that even for
[1:06:19] Rahab the Bible said Rahab the Harlot
[1:06:21] she did not even consider the way of
[1:06:24] life and where she was living when she
[1:06:26] heard the word think about this church
[1:06:28] the word energized her and even lifted
[1:06:32] her above the complexes that she had in
[1:06:35] her life
[1:06:37] glory be to God what was it it's
[1:06:40] character nearing the throne
[1:06:44] it's the strength of the son it's the
[1:06:47] effect of Christ upon his people
[1:06:51] oh glory be to God I'll tell you there's
[1:06:53] no way for us to doubt our doubts except
[1:06:56] God sweep by he managed by his sweet by
[1:06:59] his faith and moves and energizes our
[1:07:01] faith now notice in verse 21
[1:07:04] this is what is known of what David had
[1:07:07] said remember when they came to him with
[1:07:09] the report David had said surely in vain
[1:07:12] have I kept all this fellow hath in the
[1:07:15] wilderness
[1:07:16] so that nothing was missed of all that
[1:07:18] pertaineth unto him and he hath requited
[1:07:21] me evil for good
[1:07:25] who buddy that can be a hard pill to
[1:07:27] swallow
[1:07:28] when you do good and Evil's coming back
[1:07:30] to you
[1:07:31] right that's like putting money in the
[1:07:33] bank and you go and it says zero balance
[1:07:38] so and more also do God unto the enemies
[1:07:41] of David if I leave all that pertaineth
[1:07:43] to him by the Morning Light any that
[1:07:45] pisseth against the wall
[1:07:46] what you think about David's life let me
[1:07:49] just dwell with this just for a minute
[1:07:50] David's life
[1:07:52] David had in reverence
[1:07:55] and desire to please God
[1:07:58] I know we say we have brother Sammy he
[1:08:00] did
[1:08:01] but remember when we talk about when
[1:08:04] you're facing your enemy David is being
[1:08:06] hunted down like by Saul
[1:08:09] there ain't not one good thing that you
[1:08:11] can put on and say boy Saul's doing this
[1:08:13] real good he's doing it nothing
[1:08:16] he's hunting him down like a dog
[1:08:21] but David
[1:08:23] is setting his affections on things
[1:08:25] above
[1:08:28] are you hearing me now
[1:08:30] David's desire to please God in
[1:08:34] reverence God is what affects his
[1:08:37] conduct towards Saul
[1:08:40] are you hearing me it ain't because Saul
[1:08:42] deserves it
[1:08:44] if some God what it deserved he'd have
[1:08:46] had more than just a clipping taken off
[1:08:48] the skirt of His Garment he'd had his
[1:08:50] head taken off and David could have done
[1:08:52] it twice
[1:08:54] right so there's no reason there's no
[1:08:57] merits there's nothing there's not one
[1:08:59] little speck of anything that you can
[1:09:01] find that boy Saul's a good guy towards
[1:09:04] David you can't find that been run the
[1:09:06] contrary but what is it that causes
[1:09:09] David to honor a man Anointed with an
[1:09:12] evil spirit and is so wrong
[1:09:14] because of his desire
[1:09:17] to please God
[1:09:20] oh you hear me
[1:09:22] talk about a character that's nearing
[1:09:24] the throne
[1:09:25] see David is aware
[1:09:27] when he's looking at this David has a
[1:09:29] relationship with God that's what's
[1:09:32] affecting David and once you think about
[1:09:34] this there's a reverence to the things
[1:09:36] of God remember how brother Bram says
[1:09:38] how that Satan um how about the Lord
[1:09:41] Jesus
[1:09:42] through every Temptation remember how he
[1:09:44] said he defeated Satan he said he
[1:09:46] overcame him by the word remember
[1:09:47] brother I'm saying that then brother
[1:09:49] Brown says he overcame him by love
[1:09:53] right
[1:09:54] he overcame well how did he overcome the
[1:09:58] enemy
[1:09:59] it wasn't just because he was good at
[1:10:01] quoting scripture he overcame because he
[1:10:05] was yielded and he reverenced the word
[1:10:08] of God above his own wants
[1:10:11] and sometimes our wants friends are not
[1:10:13] about hunger and mourning this and one
[1:10:14] and that sometimes our wants is wanting
[1:10:17] to say something when it's a Wrong Time
[1:10:19] to Say Something
[1:10:21] hello I'm talking about character
[1:10:23] nearing the throne
[1:10:25] God tempering a people because if we're
[1:10:28] going to rule and reign with him God is
[1:10:30] tempering our character it's true a lot
[1:10:33] of our buttons that get pushed and all
[1:10:34] that there's going to be a complete
[1:10:36] change not just back to a young person
[1:10:37] again but God's going to change us all
[1:10:40] the way through and through but our
[1:10:43] character
[1:10:44] is what will be harvested
[1:10:47] out of this Earth
[1:10:49] a character that has been molded and
[1:10:52] shaped by tests by trials by things that
[1:10:57] we've come into and we've tried to get
[1:10:59] out of we've tried to pray our way out
[1:11:01] of it we've tried to pray it away
[1:11:04] and God has an appointment to mold our
[1:11:08] character
[1:11:09] because remember the Holy Ghost is the
[1:11:11] gift of God
[1:11:13] but character is not a gift
[1:11:15] it's a victory
[1:11:18] and so God is molding in our life
[1:11:20] victory
[1:11:22] after Victory after victory
[1:11:25] so I want you to think about this with
[1:11:27] David
[1:11:28] remember in the scripture as a Bible
[1:11:30] reader
[1:11:32] it was David's Behavior
[1:11:34] because Saul didn't know he had been
[1:11:36] anointed nobody told him it was a secret
[1:11:41] remember whatsoever he hath
[1:11:44] whatsoever the Lord see it in secret
[1:11:47] that he will reveal openly
[1:11:50] right that's a revealing of this third
[1:11:52] pool the revealing of the word it's in
[1:11:53] that secret place with God it will be
[1:11:55] revealed openly
[1:11:57] and what you find in the scriptures of
[1:11:59] how that Saul could look at David and
[1:12:02] the Bible says he knew God had anointed
[1:12:05] David to be king because he behaved
[1:12:08] himself wisely
[1:12:11] not because he had flu Goliath right
[1:12:14] right not because of all these other but
[1:12:17] because it wasn't because he slayed this
[1:12:19] when he killed this when he did this it
[1:12:21] was his behavior
[1:12:23] that was displayed that said this man
[1:12:26] is the one who's King
[1:12:28] his behavior
[1:12:31] wow that's powerful isn't it no wonder
[1:12:34] as the spirit of God would draw our
[1:12:36] attention in this end time
[1:12:38] it did not put the emphasis on Miracles
[1:12:41] it did not put the emphasis on emotion
[1:12:43] we believe in all those things it did
[1:12:45] not even put the emphasis on the just
[1:12:47] the written word it put the emphasis on
[1:12:50] the very character of Jesus Christ
[1:12:52] stepping into a group of people and
[1:12:56] molding our character to match his own
[1:12:59] glorious character that we would have
[1:13:01] the same ministry as the Lord Jesus
[1:13:04] Christ
[1:13:07] you love him
[1:13:10] so here David behaved him so he was
[1:13:12] Behavior it was the word it was that
[1:13:14] behavior that that anointing it was it
[1:13:16] was being expressed through his life
[1:13:17] even when he had others think of it God
[1:13:20] listen friends God permitted it don't
[1:13:24] hate or go ahead you know start hating
[1:13:26] those men I tell you David had those
[1:13:28] guys around him and them guys said hey
[1:13:30] David right there he is God has
[1:13:32] delivered him into your hands look I'm
[1:13:33] trying to get all scriptural and given
[1:13:35] him quotes and there you go David take
[1:13:38] his life there he is the almighty God
[1:13:41] who has delivered him into your hands
[1:13:43] but David knew
[1:13:46] the Bible said Thou shalt not touch the
[1:13:48] Lord's anointed nor do His prophets any
[1:13:51] harm
[1:13:52] and David
[1:13:54] the work
[1:14:01] if the man you respect the office
[1:14:05] is that right
[1:14:07] so here David was respecting that office
[1:14:09] and David knew that was the word of God
[1:14:12] I'm not treading over the word of God
[1:14:14] David could have tore salt down
[1:14:18] he had encouragement all around him
[1:14:21] are you hearing me he had counsel all
[1:14:23] around him take his life here he is
[1:14:25] twice
[1:14:27] twice
[1:14:29] but see David took all of those voices
[1:14:32] that was coming
[1:14:33] and he filtered it through the word
[1:14:37] now let's think facing
[1:14:39] you think David wasn't tempted this
[1:14:42] guy's tired of running for his life
[1:14:44] are you with me
[1:14:46] is you get him back in the corner he's
[1:14:49] feeling like defending himself on
[1:14:50] Facebook
[1:14:51] oh preach with me now
[1:14:53] he feels like he's got it man I gotta
[1:14:55] rise up and defend myself
[1:14:58] right
[1:15:00] oh that all that was there but what
[1:15:02] David did is he filtered Every Voice
[1:15:05] through the word of God
[1:15:08] what was it showing God didn't remove
[1:15:11] those were choices David had to make God
[1:15:14] chose David that's true but David
[1:15:16] yielded to God he yielded his emotions
[1:15:19] he surrendered his wrath he surrendered
[1:15:22] his anger he surrendered Vengeance he
[1:15:24] surrendered it to almighty God and said
[1:15:27] this is your word Lord It's hard right
[1:15:29] now to obey it but I humble myself to
[1:15:32] your word because your word is right no
[1:15:35] matter what my emotions say no matter
[1:15:37] what my thoughts say no matter what all
[1:15:39] around me say your word is right
[1:15:44] what is it character nearing the throne
[1:15:54] let me just skip over that you can read
[1:15:56] that later if you want to when you get
[1:15:58] home
[1:15:59] second Peter chapter three when Peter
[1:16:01] speaks of the time
[1:16:03] we're living in
[1:16:05] and Peter would say it maybe just to
[1:16:07] read just
[1:16:09] a verse of scripture in verse 11.
[1:16:12] seeing then that all these things shall
[1:16:14] be dissolved
[1:16:16] what men are persons
[1:16:18] ought you to be in all holy
[1:16:20] conversation
[1:16:22] and godliness
[1:16:24] looking for and hastening unto the
[1:16:26] coming
[1:16:27] of the day of God I want to be ready
[1:16:31] I want to be ready
[1:16:34] is that right
[1:16:37] we're in the heavens being on fire shall
[1:16:39] be dissolved in the elements shall melt
[1:16:40] with Urban heat I I want to go on and
[1:16:43] have the admonition because
[1:16:45] friends we see the things all around us
[1:16:48] and let me just say not only we see it
[1:16:50] we feel the pressures
[1:16:54] in the past years our patients have been
[1:16:56] tried
[1:16:59] Temperance our self-control has been
[1:17:02] tried
[1:17:05] because we see we see and we feel the
[1:17:09] pressures
[1:17:11] but that's where we have to say Lord
[1:17:13] renew my patience
[1:17:16] because we've got a promise as children
[1:17:18] of God we shall see him as he is and
[1:17:21] every man that hath this hope in him
[1:17:23] purifyeth
[1:17:25] himself
[1:17:27] how can I be pure without the washing of
[1:17:30] Water by the word let's just see the
[1:17:32] blessedness of the word The Living Word
[1:17:34] coming down and dealing with our life
[1:17:36] what's God doing he's coming to bring
[1:17:38] cleansing and as we say yes Lord be it
[1:17:40] unto me that's the truth Lord I give
[1:17:42] myself to that what's it doing there's a
[1:17:44] refreshing there's a renewing within our
[1:17:47] lives we are not set aside as Christians
[1:17:50] to be independent or in other words
[1:17:52] self-reliant we need him
[1:17:56] he is our husband we are his bride we
[1:17:59] need him we need the washing of Water by
[1:18:02] the word we need the Living Word coming
[1:18:04] down and Discerning our life and
[1:18:06] reminding us what manner of persons
[1:18:09] ought we to be we are people we're
[1:18:11] nearing the time of the throne we are
[1:18:14] nearing the time of the rapture we are
[1:18:18] nearing the moment where our bodies
[1:18:20] shall be changed in a moment in a
[1:18:22] twinkling of an eye we are nearing the
[1:18:24] wedding supper we are nearing the
[1:18:26] millennium
[1:18:28] the promises of God all to think of it
[1:18:32] how Paul could write about Isaiah spoke
[1:18:34] of it that we are the people on whom the
[1:18:37] ends of the world have come
[1:18:41] right here
[1:18:44] and we see this as a if I can use the
[1:18:47] words of the prophet
[1:18:49] it is an unfit age
[1:18:52] for humans to live in
[1:18:57] we see the crumbling of all world
[1:19:01] we see the hatred
[1:19:03] glorification of sin evil and wickedness
[1:19:07] but I want to remind you we've got a
[1:19:09] sure place to look to
[1:19:13] amen hallelujah
[1:19:15] the Bible tells us when you begin to see
[1:19:17] all these things lift up your head your
[1:19:20] Redemption draweth nigh when you feel
[1:19:22] like oh God my patience is getting short
[1:19:25] lift up your head your Redemption
[1:19:28] drawing now you need a refreshing in
[1:19:30] your life of temperance a refreshing of
[1:19:33] patience lift up your head your
[1:19:35] Redemption draweth now there is a fresh
[1:19:38] deposit of the glory of almighty God
[1:19:42] that is set aside for your life you are
[1:19:45] not left destitute he did not save you
[1:19:48] I'd fill you with the Holy Ghost and
[1:19:50] move away and leave you he's right there
[1:19:52] inside of you the whole time
[1:19:56] and before he was in you he was watching
[1:19:59] over you he was by you the whole time
[1:20:03] there wasn't a song wise enough smart
[1:20:05] enough big enough that could overtake
[1:20:07] God's plan and purpose for your life
[1:20:13] Hallelujah
[1:20:16] verse 23 of first Samuel 25.
[1:20:19] and when Abigail saw David
[1:20:22] she hasted
[1:20:24] and she lighted off the ass and remember
[1:20:26] she sent
[1:20:28] Goods
[1:20:30] she sent his request
[1:20:33] before him
[1:20:36] she's coming to approach him but she
[1:20:39] says
[1:20:40] let what he's asked for
[1:20:42] go before me
[1:20:46] battle testify of the heart that's
[1:20:49] coming to him
[1:20:52] when Abigail saw David she hasted she
[1:20:55] lighted off the ass and failed before
[1:20:57] David on her face and bowed herself to
[1:20:59] the ground and fell in his feet and said
[1:21:01] upon me my Lord upon me let this
[1:21:06] iniquity be
[1:21:09] I want you to watch this
[1:21:11] let it be on me
[1:21:14] watch just watching I'm talking about
[1:21:16] character that's nearing the throne
[1:21:18] and let thine handmade I pray thee
[1:21:22] speaking thine audience
[1:21:24] and hear the words of thine handmaid
[1:21:26] let not my Lord I pray thee regard this
[1:21:29] man of Belial even neighbor as for his
[1:21:33] name is so is he Nable is his name and
[1:21:38] Folly is with him
[1:21:40] but I watch this thine handmade
[1:21:45] see she's already a separation is coming
[1:21:49] by the word
[1:21:51] her first husband is still alive but
[1:21:53] separation is coming by the word
[1:21:57] she's been drawn to the word in
[1:21:59] obedience notice but thine handmade
[1:22:02] saw not the young men of my Lord
[1:22:05] whom thou didst
[1:22:07] sin
[1:22:09] now what's she doing she's distancing
[1:22:12] herself
[1:22:14] from the wrong
[1:22:16] that has been done
[1:22:18] yet I want you to watch this
[1:22:21] and she's doing that
[1:22:24] by first asking for forgiveness
[1:22:27] yes now no we could we could barter or
[1:22:29] we could say a lot of things and say
[1:22:31] Abigail
[1:22:32] you didn't even hear it
[1:22:34] you're not the one who reject it and
[1:22:36] you're saying let this iniquity be upon
[1:22:40] me
[1:22:42] well I got everybody's attention now
[1:22:44] don't I
[1:22:46] I'm talking about character
[1:22:48] that's nearing the throne
[1:22:50] we're not living in a time of ignorance
[1:22:53] we're living in a time of the full
[1:22:55] revealing of the son of man
[1:22:58] we're living in a time when the hearts
[1:23:00] and the secrets of men are being made
[1:23:03] known
[1:23:05] we're living in a Time
[1:23:07] that Secrets cannot remain hidden God
[1:23:10] will bring it to light
[1:23:12] but it depends John when God brings
[1:23:14] things to life where do you stand
[1:23:17] if you make excuses for it it will
[1:23:20] remain
[1:23:21] but that's where you have to identify
[1:23:23] with the word of God let me just put it
[1:23:25] this way if there's something that is
[1:23:27] within the family and you can say well
[1:23:30] Lord I see yes I see I I do this but but
[1:23:33] you know my my grandpa was like this my
[1:23:36] daddy was like this you can have a quote
[1:23:38] where it says Spirits travel in families
[1:23:40] but I've got more quotes that says when
[1:23:43] the Holy Ghost the abstract is called
[1:23:45] that it cuts off any claim of the devil
[1:23:49] upon that life
[1:23:51] come on friends we're talking about the
[1:23:53] strength of the coming of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:55] the quickening power in this hour it is
[1:23:58] the abstract to the title deed and
[1:24:01] that's why the prophet could stand there
[1:24:02] in Rising of the sun he said you see
[1:24:04] this little epileptic child but he said
[1:24:07] once that life has received the Holy
[1:24:10] Ghost he said that does not have a claim
[1:24:13] upon her life
[1:24:14] I don't care what the family tree says
[1:24:18] you've been grafted into another one
[1:24:23] must I do side with the word
[1:24:26] is that right but brother Samuel's heart
[1:24:28] it was hard for David not to take Saul's
[1:24:30] head off but he sided with the word
[1:24:33] why it was a character
[1:24:35] coming to the throne
[1:24:39] she knew judgment was coming I want you
[1:24:42] to watch this in verse 26.
[1:24:44] now therefore my Lord
[1:24:46] as the Lord liveth what's Abigail speak
[1:24:48] now
[1:24:49] and as thy soul liveth
[1:24:52] seeing the Lord
[1:24:53] hath withhold thee from coming to shed
[1:24:55] blood
[1:24:58] whoo
[1:24:59] this little lady is prophesying
[1:25:02] she's announcing the reason you haven't
[1:25:06] come to shed blood is because the Lord
[1:25:08] had withheld thee now I want to remind
[1:25:09] you David ain't setting in the tent when
[1:25:12] she meets him David's on his horse he's
[1:25:14] got his sword and the men are ready to
[1:25:16] go and take heads off
[1:25:18] but she's announcing the Lord has with
[1:25:21] whom thee
[1:25:23] what is it she's taking the word and she
[1:25:27] submitted herself to the word that
[1:25:29] you're the one who's King
[1:25:31] you're the one who's coming into King
[1:25:34] and she's taken that word and she glory
[1:25:37] be to God she is reflecting even a
[1:25:40] position that she doesn't have right
[1:25:43] then as far as being manifested but she
[1:25:45] even in her actions to the word is
[1:25:48] reflecting where her position will be
[1:25:52] glory be to God sing the Lord hath
[1:25:55] withhold in thee from coming to shed
[1:25:57] blood and from avenging thyself with
[1:26:00] thine own hand notice from avenging
[1:26:02] thyself with thine own hand
[1:26:05] oh the words calling it out this is
[1:26:08] about you David
[1:26:11] this is about you David
[1:26:14] I know you're the anointed of the Lord
[1:26:17] but the reason you got your sword out
[1:26:19] and you're ready to go take somebody's
[1:26:20] head off because this is about
[1:26:22] you
[1:26:23] they've offended
[1:26:31] hallelujah boy this is good in there
[1:26:35] now let thine enemies and they that seek
[1:26:38] evil to my Lord be his neighbor
[1:26:42] and now this blessing
[1:26:44] which thine handmade hath brought unto
[1:26:46] my Lord let it be given unto the young
[1:26:48] men that follow my Lord so all these
[1:26:50] these Treasures these gifts I want you
[1:26:52] to give it to the young men that follow
[1:26:54] my Lord notice where she's placing
[1:26:56] herself
[1:26:57] she's humbling herself
[1:27:00] and I pray they watch this in verse 28 I
[1:27:02] want you to notice there's three things
[1:27:04] here I pray thee forgive
[1:27:07] the trespass of thine handmaid
[1:27:11] but Abigail what have you done
[1:27:13] but she said I pray thee forgive the
[1:27:17] trespass
[1:27:18] of thine handmaid
[1:27:21] now watch
[1:27:22] because remember
[1:27:24] she wasn't even there I just read your
[1:27:27] scripture before Abigail could have said
[1:27:29] it wasn't me I wasn't even there
[1:27:33] I wasn't even there but what she
[1:27:34] recognized is I was born into this
[1:27:37] household or I was in this household
[1:27:40] come on now
[1:27:41] come on friends that's why when we
[1:27:43] repent we repent from letting that
[1:27:45] Fierce nature rule over us
[1:27:47] is that what it is
[1:27:50] because that real seed of God on the
[1:27:51] inside never did Sin
[1:27:54] is that right from God's mind it never
[1:27:56] did Sin in the beginning
[1:27:59] but that repentance is from allowing
[1:28:02] that old nature to rule and to Reign and
[1:28:04] project in our life so notice where
[1:28:06] she's at she is praying Lord she's
[1:28:08] praying to David forgive the trespass of
[1:28:11] thine handmade now I want you to watch
[1:28:13] how brother M said this I ran across
[1:28:14] this hearing the message my new ministry
[1:28:16] brother I'm saying you don't have to be
[1:28:18] rich and mighty in this world to be
[1:28:20] great in the sight of God you only have
[1:28:22] to be humble in your heart
[1:28:24] and God calls that greatness how many
[1:28:27] one be great
[1:28:28] remember the same I don't want to be
[1:28:30] great no I want to be great like this
[1:28:31] not great like the world says great I
[1:28:34] want to be great according to God's
[1:28:36] greatness his humbleness he that's great
[1:28:39] enough to Humble himself that's a great
[1:28:41] person that'll take the blame for
[1:28:43] everything that'll humble himself that's
[1:28:46] greatness I say this is the Bride of
[1:28:49] Jesus Christ a character that's nearing
[1:28:51] the throne are you with me now this is a
[1:28:54] people who is looking at it it's not
[1:28:56] so-and-so's fault it's not this person's
[1:28:59] fault that there is nothing if there is
[1:29:01] something about me it is not somebody
[1:29:03] else's fault it is between me and God
[1:29:07] and say God remedy this out of my life
[1:29:11] is that right
[1:29:12] because that's the only way that God's
[1:29:14] ever going to deal with it correctly she
[1:29:16] has the right approach
[1:29:19] is that right
[1:29:21] now remember this is not odd to the
[1:29:24] children of God
[1:29:25] when Daniel when the third pole
[1:29:28] visitation is made known to Daniel in
[1:29:30] Daniel chapter 9 when Daniel said I
[1:29:32] understood by the books in other words
[1:29:33] what Jeremiah and the rest have
[1:29:35] prophesied concerning the departure
[1:29:37] after 70 years I have understood by the
[1:29:41] books that this is the time and what you
[1:29:44] find Daniel going into he calls himself
[1:29:46] in sackcloths Daniel chapter nine you
[1:29:48] can read it he closed himself in
[1:29:50] sackcloth and he begins to make
[1:29:52] confession and what does he say we have
[1:29:55] sinned oh God we have transgressed O
[1:29:59] Lord not they have they have but we have
[1:30:02] oh God what is he doing he is one in
[1:30:05] humility of heart that is asking
[1:30:07] intercession
[1:30:09] for the people of Israel Israel chapter
[1:30:12] 9 one of my favorite chapters in the
[1:30:14] scripture when you deal with repentance
[1:30:16] is Ezra chapter nine this is something
[1:30:18] for years and years almost 20 years or
[1:30:20] more at some movement because Ezra
[1:30:22] stands there when he comes back in the
[1:30:24] land and Ezra sees them marrying and
[1:30:27] going about other peoples of the land
[1:30:29] and them still doing the according to
[1:30:31] the Canaanites and doing this and doing
[1:30:33] that and Harry takes pluck's hair out of
[1:30:36] his beard and he begins to set down
[1:30:38] before God and he is he is troubled he
[1:30:40] said God what are your people doing here
[1:30:43] he said here we are the transgressions
[1:30:45] and notice notice how Ezra approaches it
[1:30:49] you can read it when you get home he
[1:30:50] said Lord you laid less upon us than
[1:30:55] what we deserve Lord we deserve to be
[1:30:59] consumed for all the iniquities and our
[1:31:02] transgressions you say what is the value
[1:31:04] of that because where the spirit of
[1:31:07] atonement is the spirit of God is able
[1:31:10] to move out and change lives and change
[1:31:14] Hearts glory be to God when the prophet
[1:31:17] saw the preview of the Bride he never
[1:31:19] said is that the best they can do he
[1:31:22] said is that the best we can do
[1:31:25] why because this message stays with this
[1:31:29] generation to draw out a bride what is
[1:31:32] it shelling he's still on The Mercy Seat
[1:31:35] and God's spirit of atonement is still
[1:31:37] at work to intercede on our behalf until
[1:31:40] that final name is splashed
[1:31:46] the next part established on the word
[1:31:49] that's what she says in verse 28. for
[1:31:52] the Lord
[1:31:53] will certainly make my Lord a sure house
[1:31:57] notice my Lord
[1:31:59] who will the Lord will he's the one's
[1:32:02] going to make you a sure house but David
[1:32:03] be careful your foundation
[1:32:06] be careful your foundation
[1:32:08] because of whatever you take with you
[1:32:11] whatever you do will translate into your
[1:32:14] kingdom
[1:32:16] if you cut Corners here your kingdom
[1:32:18] will be a corner cutting Kingdom
[1:32:20] if you cut Corners before marriage your
[1:32:22] marriage will be a corner cut in
[1:32:24] marriage
[1:32:26] are you with me that's why it's so
[1:32:27] important
[1:32:29] it's so important to lay and to have God
[1:32:31] let God Be The Sinner notice for the
[1:32:33] Lord will certainly make my Lord a sure
[1:32:36] house so David notice David's not
[1:32:38] responsible for bringing himself to the
[1:32:40] throne you ever think about David when
[1:32:42] David could sit there and think and
[1:32:43] think I wonder how many more days I've
[1:32:44] got of this a running for my life
[1:32:47] alarm clock goes off snooze you better
[1:32:50] get up boy
[1:32:52] you better get up don't snooze it too
[1:32:54] long because you might miss it your head
[1:32:56] might be rolling what are you gonna do
[1:32:58] David today I'm gonna run from alive
[1:33:03] David where are you settling down I
[1:33:04] don't know I'm just running
[1:33:07] and you're anointed to be the king
[1:33:10] really
[1:33:11] and you're running like that
[1:33:13] he was being pursued
[1:33:17] by Saul
[1:33:18] but he had a character
[1:33:21] that was fitted
[1:33:23] for the throne
[1:33:26] notice because my Lord fighteth here's
[1:33:30] why
[1:33:31] because my Lord
[1:33:33] fighteth for battles
[1:33:35] of the Lord
[1:33:37] look at this discernment
[1:33:39] she's already said if you go you're
[1:33:41] going to avenge yourself but she's
[1:33:42] already declared now notice testifying
[1:33:45] of that trueness that seed that
[1:33:47] righteousness on the inside you are the
[1:33:49] one who's fighting the Lord's battles
[1:33:51] God's using you God's working through
[1:33:53] your life
[1:33:55] you realize brother Ram talks about it
[1:33:56] in this way I've got the quote here but
[1:33:58] I'm just let me paraphrase it he said
[1:34:00] when you consider what takes place here
[1:34:01] on the platform he said it's me yielding
[1:34:04] myself and God coming down and taking
[1:34:06] control
[1:34:07] he said now if I ever got in my mind
[1:34:11] that it's me he said God won't come
[1:34:15] and then he takes right the very next
[1:34:17] paragraph and he says
[1:34:19] if when somebody says something about
[1:34:21] you
[1:34:23] and you go to take after him he said God
[1:34:25] can't fight your battles
[1:34:28] because you're fighting them
[1:34:32] now I know I'm not going to ask this
[1:34:33] question because I'm I don't know I want
[1:34:35] I don't know what kind of hands I get if
[1:34:36] I raise this if I ask the question who's
[1:34:38] ready to fight some battles
[1:34:41] I'm afraid we'll come out of some purses
[1:34:42] and how to some coats and then
[1:34:46] so we won't ask that question we just
[1:34:47] think God made the spirit of God come in
[1:34:50] metal hearts here tonight come on
[1:34:52] friends because just like David there
[1:34:54] are times that we have felt like David
[1:34:56] he could not have cut a piece out of
[1:34:59] Saul's skirt if his sword had been
[1:35:02] sheathed
[1:35:06] are you with me that's the enemy that
[1:35:08] had moved up next to him when I was
[1:35:10] about ready to say if that's how he's
[1:35:12] going to be
[1:35:14] sword was already out of the sheath and
[1:35:16] he had taken even a peace but you know
[1:35:19] that peace that he took out of him it
[1:35:21] might have been a piece on Instagram a
[1:35:22] piece on Facebook a piece to somebody
[1:35:24] that he had to repent of that peace
[1:35:27] touch not the Lord's anointed do my
[1:35:29] prophets no harm
[1:35:30] is that right
[1:35:32] now look at this
[1:35:34] and evil hath not been found in thee all
[1:35:38] by faith in that a paradox
[1:35:40] I mean really here is a man that's
[1:35:42] getting ready to avenge himself has
[1:35:44] nothing spiritual about it whatsoever
[1:35:46] it's all about him
[1:35:48] and here stands Abigail moved by the
[1:35:51] word but you see what the word is doing
[1:35:53] it's discerning the real truth on the
[1:35:56] inside aren't you glad when we come to
[1:35:58] the house of God sometimes maybe we've
[1:36:00] already gone up in our mind to avenge
[1:36:01] ourselves I'll tell you what I tell you
[1:36:03] I have been burnt in this meeting right
[1:36:05] here and tomorrow when I when I I'm
[1:36:08] going to send them that email tomorrow I
[1:36:09] am going to talk to the Boston I am
[1:36:11] gonna aren't you glad when we get in the
[1:36:13] presence of God that the sweetness and
[1:36:15] tenderness of the dove of almighty God
[1:36:17] will come right back around and say hey
[1:36:19] wait a minute there is no evil found in
[1:36:21] thee what's it doing it's the word
[1:36:23] examining the word on the inside what's
[1:36:26] it doing it's lifting up that
[1:36:28] christ-like character
[1:36:32] I'm glad to be reminded of who I am
[1:36:34] aren't you
[1:36:35] oh my there's a Proving Grounds that we
[1:36:38] are in Even In This Moment now let me
[1:36:40] just try to to finish this here
[1:36:44] in verse 29
[1:36:46] yet a man
[1:36:48] Abigail says yet a man has risen to
[1:36:50] pursue thee and to seek thy soul
[1:36:55] but the soul of my Lord
[1:36:57] shall be bound
[1:37:00] in the bundle of life
[1:37:02] with the Lord thy God and that is
[1:37:04] powerful man
[1:37:05] a man is coming to pursue you
[1:37:09] and to seek thy soul but the soul of my
[1:37:12] Lord shall be bound in the bundle of
[1:37:15] life
[1:37:16] with the Lord thy God and The Souls of
[1:37:18] thine enemies them shall he sling out as
[1:37:21] out of the middle of a sling can I read
[1:37:23] to you this is one of the only places
[1:37:24] you only hear Brother Brown talk about
[1:37:25] Abigail twice and this is the quote
[1:37:27] right here weeks ago when I was studying
[1:37:29] on certain things and I ran across it
[1:37:30] just just set in on a bank of quotes
[1:37:33] and I ran across this I thought dear
[1:37:35] Lord this is what took me back to this
[1:37:36] this thought
[1:37:38] Brown is talking to the people of God
[1:37:40] and he's talking about how the word has
[1:37:41] come forth and brought correction and
[1:37:43] how that we're to respond to the word
[1:37:45] and he says if I could just break in
[1:37:46] here and he says Pentecostal preachers
[1:37:48] sometimes and men will go downtown and
[1:37:51] you'll see him on the streets sometimes
[1:37:52] we'll just jump into traffic and
[1:37:55] consider your friends
[1:37:57] if you see him fixing to get a ticket I
[1:37:59] don't care who it is put a nickel in
[1:38:01] don't let him be fined now watch what
[1:38:04] brother Brown's talking about he's
[1:38:06] talking about how that they would go
[1:38:07] down the street if you see the you know
[1:38:09] go by the meter if something's getting
[1:38:10] ready to expire they would see one of
[1:38:12] their people there and they would go
[1:38:13] ahead and put that Nickel in the person
[1:38:15] may not have even known it was getting
[1:38:16] ready to expire now watch what he's
[1:38:18] going into even in everything
[1:38:21] it will grow on you
[1:38:24] there's a lot of things grow on us right
[1:38:26] there's a lot of things can grow on us
[1:38:29] some things that might as well might as
[1:38:30] well say it the way we understand it
[1:38:31] sometimes they're growing on us so we
[1:38:33] think about is irritants
[1:38:35] things that can irritate us and
[1:38:38] frustrate us but that's not what brother
[1:38:39] M's talking about brother Graham's
[1:38:41] talking about in everything if you go to
[1:38:44] start doing the things that are right
[1:38:46] it'll grow on you

[1:39:06] hands or I don't feel like
[1:39:08] wow isn't it amazing how we live by our
[1:39:11] feelings but sometimes you've got to do
[1:39:13] the hard things and that's when feelings

[1:40:27] all men shall know
[1:40:29] you're my disciples that you have love
[1:40:31] one for another
[1:40:34] see what you have to evaluate is is all
[1:40:36] of your actions is what you're doing
[1:40:39] by love
[1:40:42] is what you're doing and the way you're
[1:40:43] responding and acting is it by your own
[1:40:46] reasonings or is it by the word
[1:40:49] if the character of God is against it
[1:40:52] then you ought to lay that aside and be
[1:40:54] against it too
[1:40:55] we're talking about a character that's
[1:40:57] near the throne listen friends you
[1:40:59] cannot change things on your own ways
[1:41:02] and your own measures
[1:41:04] you must come according to the word of
[1:41:06] almighty God
[1:41:08] now let me just let me let me move into
[1:41:10] this here this is where brother Ram's
[1:41:12] talking about this here what did what
[1:41:14] did he say what did he say about little
[1:41:16] David when he was up there and Abigail
[1:41:18] this is one of the places brother man
[1:41:20] talks about Abigail he said she said
[1:41:22] your soul is wrapped in a bundle of love
[1:41:28] when Abigail the great woman that met
[1:41:30] David we know that your enemies will be
[1:41:33] flung out like a sling that's right
[1:41:35] because you're wrapped in the bundle of
[1:41:38] the love of God oh if I want to be bound
[1:41:42] up let me be bound up in the love of God
[1:41:44] I don't want to be bound up with
[1:41:46] entertainment I don't want to be bound
[1:41:47] up with hurt feelings I
[1:41:52] had up with bitterness I want to be
[1:41:53] bound Up Tangled Up Tied Up in Jesus I
[1:41:56] want to be bound up with the love of God
[1:41:59] well how do you get bound up with
[1:42:01] something it'd kind of be like taking a
[1:42:03] string
[1:42:04] and you start having somebody you know
[1:42:06] when you're doing somebody that
[1:42:07] sometimes they'll do what is it
[1:42:08] mummified and where they'll do toilet
[1:42:10] paper around them and you're spinning
[1:42:11] around young people know that they do
[1:42:12] those kind of games you spin around
[1:42:14] until you keep taking the role around
[1:42:15] them and around them and around them
[1:42:16] around them you got to keep going around
[1:42:18] them that's how with being bundled up
[1:42:20] with the love of God do you realize it
[1:42:22] ain't just something that all I'm gonna
[1:42:23] pray till I become a great big bundle
[1:42:25] you must have action to go with your
[1:42:28] prayers and that action will also be
[1:42:30] what humility responding to what you
[1:42:33] don't feel like responding to it'll be
[1:42:36] something where you make yourself do
[1:42:38] what's right because the word says it's
[1:42:40] right and I'm doing it because I
[1:42:43] reverence God
[1:42:45] not because I'm condoning this action or
[1:42:48] this Behavior but I'm going to act
[1:42:50] according to God's word
[1:42:52] because sometimes you're tried when a
[1:42:55] person's behavior is out of line but
[1:42:57] you're tried what are you going to do
[1:43:00] are you going to respond and avenge
[1:43:02] yourself or are you going to act
[1:43:03] according to the word of God
[1:43:05] preach with me now
[1:43:08] oh my I want to be wrapped in a bundle
[1:43:11] of love because that's what he's coming
[1:43:12] to Rapture
[1:43:16] let me just move on here
[1:43:18] can I can I finish this up
[1:43:21] let me just finish this verse 30.
[1:43:24] and it shall come to pass
[1:43:26] when the Lord shall have done to my Lord
[1:43:28] according to all the good he has spoken
[1:43:30] concerning them I'll tell you she's a
[1:43:32] believer
[1:43:33] she said God's going to perform all that
[1:43:35] he has done concerning you
[1:43:39] glory be to God I'm glad that this is
[1:43:41] somebody that weren't coming alongside
[1:43:43] of David like the rest of them and
[1:43:44] saying get him David get him David boy
[1:43:47] I'll tell you David he's a nasty guy oh
[1:43:49] he's done you wrong he's done this no
[1:43:51] but here is character nearing the throne
[1:43:54] now remember some of them other guys
[1:43:56] hello some of them other guys that were
[1:43:59] urging David on David told Solomon when
[1:44:01] Solomon came into his kingdom he said
[1:44:03] don't you let joab's head stay on him
[1:44:05] why because joab will do what joab wants
[1:44:07] to do when it's convenient for joab
[1:44:10] is that right
[1:44:11] there's plenty of where are these
[1:44:13] examples there in the scripture where
[1:44:14] job did things that was not according to
[1:44:16] what David requested Joe have acted on
[1:44:18] his own accord and did what Joe had felt
[1:44:21] to do Joe had looked I'm going to
[1:44:22] advance the kingdom you don't Advance it
[1:44:24] outside of the word I don't care how
[1:44:26] much you're pulled to at the test or
[1:44:28] trial but a character that'll stay right
[1:44:30] with the word of God
[1:44:32] are you hearing me now
[1:44:35] it shall come to pass when the Lord
[1:44:37] shall have done to my Lord according to
[1:44:39] all the good that he hath spoken
[1:44:40] concerning thee and shall have pointed
[1:44:42] thee ruler over Israel that this
[1:44:44] shall be this situation shall be no
[1:44:47] grief unto thee nor a fence of heart
[1:44:50] unto my Lord
[1:44:52] either that thou has shed blood Costless
[1:44:57] but he did me evil
[1:45:00] but here is Abigail saying David
[1:45:03] God's going to fulfill his word
[1:45:05] you can't stop his word but you don't
[1:45:08] want to take regrets with you
[1:45:12] you don't want to take regrets with you
[1:45:15] David let your anger cease
[1:45:19] forsake Wrath
[1:45:22] you say brother Samuel I thought David
[1:45:24] was the king he is and Abigail is a part
[1:45:27] of his bride will be
[1:45:30] you want to see the heart of the Bride
[1:45:31] in the end time this is it right here a
[1:45:35] character that's nearing the throne
[1:45:39] a character that was the same way when
[1:45:41] he was hung on the cross
[1:45:44] and they pulled beard from him and he
[1:45:45] was reviled but reviled not back
[1:45:49] when he
[1:45:50] to patiently
[1:45:52] his good he was shedding his blood for
[1:45:55] all of mankind
[1:45:58] and he said father forgive him for they
[1:46:00] know not what they do
[1:46:03] oh my
[1:46:05] I said be it unto me Lord
[1:46:07] a character Nearing
[1:46:10] the throne
[1:46:11] but when the Lord shall have dealt well
[1:46:13] with my Lord then remember
[1:46:16] Don handmaid can I have just a couple
[1:46:18] more minutes a few scriptures that's it
[1:46:21] now after
[1:46:24] Abigail she has become so
[1:46:27] one here I know if I'm kind of Move
[1:46:29] Along on a type in one way Abigail here
[1:46:32] she is she is expressing
[1:46:35] the very desire of God
[1:46:38] to David
[1:46:40] let me ask you upon this earth right now
[1:46:43] who's expressing back to God his desire
[1:46:47] is it the denominations
[1:46:49] is it the people of this world
[1:46:52] or is it his beloved bride
[1:46:55] it's his pride
[1:46:57] there's one that he comes down to speak
[1:46:59] to and commune with one that will
[1:47:02] receive him and accept him one that will
[1:47:05] line up with the word no matter what it
[1:47:07] cost
[1:47:08] but she will Minister back to him
[1:47:12] displaying she's becoming one with the
[1:47:14] word
[1:47:15] and David said to Abigail now watch this
[1:47:17] testimony blessed be the Lord God of
[1:47:20] Israel
[1:47:21] which sent thee this day to meet me
[1:47:25] I wonder if Abigail felt very spiritual
[1:47:28] when she went to meet David but David is
[1:47:30] identifying the Lord has sent you
[1:47:33] because if God hadn't sent you everybody
[1:47:36] would have been dead including you
[1:47:40] is that right and blessed be
[1:47:43] thy advice wow
[1:47:47] and blessed be thou which hath kept me
[1:47:50] this day from coming to shed blood and
[1:47:53] from avenging myself
[1:47:55] with my own hand
[1:47:58] see this was not going to be about the
[1:48:00] Lord this was about David
[1:48:03] this was about David
[1:48:05] aren't you glad how God can discern
[1:48:07] those things in our lives sometimes but
[1:48:09] we man everything is lined up just right
[1:48:11] and God said that's all about you
[1:48:15] all damn scriptures and all them quotes
[1:48:17] and all those things they're like the
[1:48:18] Leaning Tower of Pisa it's leaning
[1:48:21] toward you
[1:48:24] hello
[1:48:26] for in varied deed as the Lord God of
[1:48:29] Israel liveth which hath kept me back
[1:48:31] from hurting thee except thou hadest
[1:48:34] hasted and come to meet me surely there
[1:48:38] had not been left unto neighbor by the
[1:48:40] Morning Light any that pisseth against
[1:48:42] the wall so David received of her hand
[1:48:45] that which she had brought him and said
[1:48:47] to her go in peace to thine house see I
[1:48:51] have hearkened to thy voice
[1:48:53] and have accepted
[1:48:56] by person
[1:49:01] verse 39 let's stand
[1:49:05] and when David heard
[1:49:09] that nabel was dead
[1:49:12] when he heard that
[1:49:14] her first husband
[1:49:16] not only she divorced he's dead
[1:49:21] now he sins to take her
[1:49:24] to be United she's going to be
[1:49:26] one with him
[1:49:28] blessed be the Lord
[1:49:31] that hath pleaded the cause
[1:49:35] of my reproach
[1:49:37] from the hand of nabel
[1:49:39] and have kept his servant from evil
[1:49:44] I'll tell you
[1:49:45] I think we all can identify with that
[1:49:47] right there is Lord you have kept my
[1:49:49] hand many times
[1:49:52] maybe kept my fingers kept my kept my
[1:49:54] mouth
[1:49:55] because in this day and age kept my
[1:49:56] fingers from dot kept Lord you've kept
[1:49:58] me back from evil
[1:50:01] ain't nothing to be ashamed of to say
[1:50:03] he's kept me back from Evil that's to
[1:50:05] glorify him and realize he has given us
[1:50:07] Grace
[1:50:09] to even with strain and hold back things
[1:50:13] that sometimes we were tempted to say
[1:50:15] and might have been absolutely the truth
[1:50:21] that it all matters
[1:50:23] the spirit
[1:50:24] that it's set in
[1:50:27] is that right
[1:50:28] because truth can be truth but it's the
[1:50:31] spirit
[1:50:32] that it's set in
[1:50:34] that matters
[1:50:36] here's a character nearing the throne I
[1:50:38] believe I'm looking at people I believe
[1:50:40] I'm one of them
[1:50:41] of character
[1:50:43] nearing the throne
[1:50:45] lives that are coming out from the
[1:50:48] things of the world coming out from
[1:50:49] underneath
[1:50:50] the household of our families coming out
[1:50:53] from every excuse and every reason and
[1:50:56] saying Lord mold me and shape me you
[1:50:58] know what you placed in my life Lord let
[1:51:00] my character be molded
[1:51:03] to your glorious character
[1:51:05] let my life be so wrapped up brother
[1:51:07] Shane let it be so tangled up to where
[1:51:10] when all when you see my life all you
[1:51:12] see is bad guys are tangled up mess oh
[1:51:15] no I'm a bundle of love
[1:51:18] I'm just I'm just Tangled Up In Love
[1:51:21] well how does that happen brother Samuel
[1:51:23] well it doesn't happen by somebody just
[1:51:25] going around me
[1:51:27] but it's me going and doing the things
[1:51:30] that is even the right things to do see
[1:51:32] so many times we look at things of that
[1:51:34] it's got to be gone to it is that right
[1:51:36] you we hear that preached over and over
[1:51:38] it's got to be god-to and it's true it
[1:51:39] does have to be God do it
[1:51:42] but this right here the prophet has
[1:51:44] given us instructions
[1:51:47] even when you look at Abigail
[1:51:49] judgment was not abated
[1:51:52] until the gifts that were sent that was
[1:51:56] requested I wonder how hard it was to
[1:51:58] load all them all that material because
[1:52:01] it wasn't just like you know all these
[1:52:03] delivering the groceries on your steps
[1:52:04] in four or five boxes they've got to
[1:52:07] feed David's Army
[1:52:08] right you got all this is loaded up I
[1:52:11] mean this one just like some little
[1:52:12] small truck a Swan's truck driving down
[1:52:16] and open up this is a lot
[1:52:19] but she is so concerned with his request
[1:52:23] that she says put this put this put this
[1:52:26] but this but this but this but this this
[1:52:28] this
[1:52:29] what's she doing all that he has said
[1:52:33] I want to honor his request
[1:52:36] how many feel that way tonight Lord I
[1:52:38] want to honor the request
[1:52:40] I want to be I want to just be so lined
[1:52:42] with that word Lord let MRI after MRI
[1:52:45] come across my life if there's anything
[1:52:47] that's out of line I want my life to be
[1:52:50] a display like Esther's was Esther or
[1:52:53] Abigail displayed a more excellent way
[1:52:56] that of charity
[1:52:58] let's pray
[1:53:01] father
[1:53:07] I believe Lord that we're Nearing
[1:53:10] the moment
[1:53:11] of Deliverance
[1:53:14] we're here
[1:53:16] in this season
[1:53:18] we're here in this time
[1:53:23] like Esther like Abigail like the rest
[1:53:25] we have been placed here
[1:53:26] [Music]
[1:53:28] for such a time as this
[1:53:32] Lord God May our hearts like Abigail
[1:53:35] making haste
[1:53:37] [Music]
[1:53:39] laying down lord our willing down
[1:53:41] ourselves
[1:53:42] before your feet Lord
[1:53:46] God made our lives Lord I pray just so
[1:53:49] capturing
[1:53:51] the heart of this message
[1:53:55] to where the heart of this message can
[1:53:57] be projected
[1:53:58] right back to you
[1:54:00] and be projected to others
[1:54:03] [Music]
[1:54:05] this message has never come
[1:54:07] [Music]
[1:54:08] to bring death
[1:54:10] it's come to bring life
[1:54:14] oh sure sometimes Lord when things don't
[1:54:16] go our way like it was in the city of
[1:54:19] Samaria
[1:54:21] when you had set your eyes and your mind
[1:54:25] to go to Jerusalem
[1:54:28] John arose in that time and said should
[1:54:30] we call fire down from heaven upon
[1:54:34] but once that same
[1:54:37] man
[1:54:39] God in your presence after
[1:54:42] the sacrifice had been offered and the
[1:54:45] coming
[1:54:46] of the Holy Ghost
[1:54:49] here came a man
[1:54:52] that was ready to avenge himself
[1:54:55] because somebody wouldn't receive him
[1:54:59] he was ready to call fire down
[1:55:02] foreign
[1:55:03] but you would let him know the son of
[1:55:05] man has not come to destroy
[1:55:08] lives
[1:55:09] but to give
[1:55:11] life
[1:55:15] what I believe is we stand here your
[1:55:18] Prophet has taught us and souls in
[1:55:19] prison in other places through the
[1:55:21] message we see it in the scriptures
[1:55:23] we've been committed to us a word of
[1:55:25] reconciliation by the indwelling of the
[1:55:27] Holy Spirit
[1:55:28] your Prophet Lord would speak we have
[1:55:30] been made co-partners with you in
[1:55:33] Redemption
[1:55:36] Lord the speaking and the living and the
[1:55:38] projecting of this word in this hour
[1:55:41] a word that has been spoken
[1:55:44] over this generation
[1:55:47] and here of Lord if we can say it in
[1:55:48] this way
[1:55:50] here's the Lord part of the Abigail that
[1:55:52] has responded to the king who is coming
[1:55:55] into power
[1:55:57] oh God May our hearts Lord be so
[1:55:59] tendered Lord
[1:56:01] recognizing your presence not living for
[1:56:04] this Earth this world this moment
[1:56:08] but may we lord God help us I pray that
[1:56:12] every action every decision may we lord
[1:56:15] God weigh it in the balance Lord of
[1:56:17] Eternity Lord to recognize oh God I want
[1:56:21] my character Lord to be so molded and
[1:56:24] fitted because your word
[1:56:27] is surely coming to pass
[1:56:31] I don't want no regrets
[1:56:34] I don't want no regrets
[1:56:37] I don't want to carry offenses
[1:56:40] I don't want to carry Lord I don't want
[1:56:42] to be a carrier of that I only want to
[1:56:44] be a carrier of the love of God
[1:56:47] Glory
[1:56:49] Lord of our life Lord would be so
[1:56:52] wrapped up
[1:56:53] [Music]
[1:56:54] in that bundle of love as your Prophet
[1:56:57] would bring that out from the scripture
[1:56:59] there
[1:56:59] [Music]
[1:57:01] help us Lord
[1:57:03] I know my brothers and sisters all
[1:57:05] around we feel the pressures Lord
[1:57:08] there's things that set all around us we
[1:57:10] see the Lord God of this world is
[1:57:12] falling apart but oh God let us Lord in
[1:57:16] this moment these closing moments Lord
[1:57:21] I want to be wrapped
[1:57:23] for rapture
[1:57:25] I want to be clothed for Rapture I want
[1:57:29] to be wrapped up Lord as your Prophet
[1:57:32] said that as that bride
[1:57:34] she nears the headstone
[1:57:36] she becomes more like him
[1:57:40] granted Lord I pray tonight
[1:57:45] character
[1:57:46] Nearing
[1:57:48] the throne
[1:57:49] [Music]
[1:57:54] I thought of how brother Branham said it
[1:57:56] like this
[1:57:58] he said you can take the meanest woman
[1:58:00] on this woman
[1:58:02] he said but here she is with child
[1:58:05] he said as he gets close to the time of
[1:58:07] delivery
[1:58:09] he said she becomes so sweet so nice she
[1:58:12] could be the most meanest woman there is
[1:58:15] he said but what it is there's a little
[1:58:17] spirit
[1:58:19] that begins to move around that's going
[1:58:20] to move right into that child when it's
[1:58:22] delivered
[1:58:23] [Music]
[1:58:25] and how he will tie that in with the
[1:58:26] bride of Jesus Christ nearing the time
[1:58:29] of the very change of our bodies
[1:58:32] as we're nearing him
[1:58:35] nearing him you want to know the effect
[1:58:37] of getting close to him drawing closer
[1:58:39] to him it's the same way we're near the
[1:58:43] time for the delivery of the son
[1:58:46] getting Kinder sweeter
[1:58:50] by what by his presence
[1:58:53] and our theophany Drawing Near
[1:58:57] like that little spirit that would hang
[1:58:59] around that little mama it's waiting for
[1:59:01] that baby to drop so is our theothenes
[1:59:05] right around us
[1:59:07] right near us ready for what to take one
[1:59:10] step from this Dimension into that
[1:59:13] dimension
[1:59:15] those that are alive and remain what
[1:59:16] will it be we will take our glorified
[1:59:18] body to meet our theophany those who
[1:59:21] have already entered into the theosomy
[1:59:23] will come right back and pick up a
[1:59:25] glorified body
[1:59:27] oh it's what a time of uniting that we
[1:59:29] are heading for
[1:59:31] I say
[1:59:33] God give us Grace Till They be lay aside
[1:59:35] every difference
[1:59:37] maybe really aside if there's anything
[1:59:39] in our heart that's not right that's not
[1:59:40] pleasing if there's anything within you
[1:59:43] that would even even seem to get even
[1:59:46] avenge yourself say Lord
[1:59:49] sweep down right here Lord let the love
[1:59:53] of God just so sweet down lord

[2:08:12] thank you Lord
[2:08:15] oh my I think is a song brother Brian
[2:08:17] had just sung take courage
[2:08:20] battle is the Lords
[2:08:23] God has spoken
[2:08:25] what he sees in you
[2:08:27] oh sure there's things that he deals
[2:08:29] with but the things that he's dealing
[2:08:32] with how could he deal with it without
[2:08:33] revealing himself
[2:08:35] and the true character of who we really
[2:08:38] are
[2:08:42] as I said moments ago what a paradox for
[2:08:45] Abigail to say no evil has been found in
[2:08:49] thee not just any action
[2:08:52] but he already has a contemplation a
[2:08:56] thought
[2:08:58] to avenge himself
[2:09:00] but there's something deeper
[2:09:02] aren't you glad there's something deeper
[2:09:04] in you
[2:09:05] something deeper me I'm glad there's
[2:09:07] something deeper that that says hey
[2:09:10] we're not going that way
[2:09:13] aren't you glad
[2:09:16] oh I'm so thankful something
[2:09:19] is holding me I'm so thankful there's a
[2:09:21] real pool in this hour I'm so thankful
[2:09:24] there's Grace that comes and loosens
[2:09:27] loosens our life I'm glad he goes down I
[2:09:31] want him to go down on the inside
[2:09:33] friends I want him to go down deep
[2:09:37] I want the spirit I want the ministry
[2:09:40] because the bride has a Ministry
[2:09:43] that reaches into the very heart it's
[2:09:45] not the bride it's Christ in the bride
[2:09:48] that reaches into the very heart I want
[2:09:50] a word that's not a sighting with my
[2:09:53] flesh I want a word that's bringing out
[2:09:56] a real son and daughter of God if it
[2:09:58] cuts me let it cut me because everything
[2:10:00] it cuts away is not me
[2:10:03] every chump that was left on the ground
[2:10:06] was not what Michelangelo had in his
[2:10:09] mind
[2:10:10] what remained is what he had in his mind
[2:10:13] every chunk that God takes away say God
[2:10:17] take it away
[2:10:19] let his grace just move and calm right
[2:10:21] down through our life
[2:10:23] because we cannot take anything like
[2:10:25] that with us and Lord
[2:10:30] I don't want it to even hold me
[2:10:31] EarthBound
[2:10:33] while I'm here
[2:10:35] even if I've only got one more day to
[2:10:37] live even if I only got one more week
[2:10:38] one more month one more year 10 years I
[2:10:41] don't want to stay down beneath my
[2:10:43] privileges because I'm holding something
[2:10:47] to avenge
[2:10:51] but Lord
[2:10:52] I accept your grace Lord God that I
[2:10:55] might live in Liberty as a character
[2:10:57] Nearing
[2:10:59] the throne
[2:11:02] oh blessed be his name
[2:11:04] Heavenly Father
[2:11:07] may you go with us tonight Lord
