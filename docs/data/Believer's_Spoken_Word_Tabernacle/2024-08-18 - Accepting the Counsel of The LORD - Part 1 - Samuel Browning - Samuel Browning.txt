different ones that are back from sickness and fighting the battle and pressing the battle and we are so thankful to the Lord for his mercies and uh that's I just want to continue to hold up I know brother um Carlos was just uh was here you seen him he greeted you and so I think they've come to the having to come to a decision with uh his father-in-law U there was a the lungs themselves had made a turn for the good on Friday morning and um but when he went into the hospital there and uh just so many strokes that he had while uh he was out and so when they went to uh bring him back and they were just testing that with taking the ventilator out and so forth uh they you know had told the the the family yesterday that it was in a state in a condition that you know uh a lot more of things they would have had to have done and so you know the family that's some of you have been there you've been in those decisions where you had to make that and I remember how it was with with with my dad when we had to make a decision and uh you know like that and and arrest others too you know I remember Sister Mary May for being there for that and um so there's a lot of things that can pull upon the heart but I just pray that God will just bring such a Unity because emotions we have our emotions we have our feelings is that right and Satan Satan's always an opportunist he likes to take situations and try to step into it you know it's just like brother bam says a bruised cell he said if can Satan can get in there then it creates a cancer so we just want to pray that the Lord will just give them a real PE peace and a direction uh when I spoke with brother um Carlos on Thursday when I had got here Brother Carlos had already had uh led him to the Lord so that's what's that's what's important that's what's really important uh that's that's a part that then we can we can have a real a real expectation praise God Amen and so we're thankful for that uh but we want to pray for them and even as they'll go to make that uh decision and those things amen let's just go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father Lord Jesus how we stand here this morning by your Sovereign Grace Lord as the song is the been sung here this morning we just throw up our hands and we praise you again and again because Lord Jesus you are so faithful Lord you are merciful Lord your love oh God is is overwhelming Lord it has taken a hold Upon Our Life Lord and like a great magnet Lord has drawn us into your presence and our lives oh God have been overwhelmed and changed by the love of God and that same love Lord by Your Grace it's held in our bosom Lord and it's that love that holds us Lord when we cannot hold ourselves it's that love that's greater Lord than that AAL love anything in our mind oh God I'm thankful there's an anchor Lord that anchor that enters within the veil and father as we just lift up these different requests the needs Lord there's been many requests that's been taken before you this morning and now Lord we remember Lord Brother Carlos remember Sister Irma Lord sister Carmen Lord and all of the family Lord I just pray and I ask oh God that may the great comforter the peace of God may you sweep Lord through that room that that little area Lord where they've been sitting at Lord And as a family and I pray that God that you'll just bring such a unity in the decision Lord father you know Lord even as I've asked you Lord Lord that God as he's ready Lord to meet you then I've asked you Lord that you would step in if you're if you're not going to raise him up if his purpose isn't finished then I've asked you oh God and we stand today Lord just asking God for your mercies Lord just to go ahead and guide him on home Lord we pray father Lord Jesus we love you father and we thank you for your mercy Lord may your presence be there Lord so so great May the peace of God lord just come on the scene and take control oh god of every heart Lord every emotion Lord and I pray that within it all God it's just like would be like you stepping in the midst of the ship that day Lord and you settled the whole entire situation Lord we ask that Lord and we ask you'd be with us in the remaining part of this service Lord that in everything oh God that would be said in done would be For Your Glory we ask these things now Lord in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen and amen amen and amen pardon me I have something I wanted to share share with you and have the wrong adapter it's the one for a previous day gone by but I had some some wonderful news we want to share with you on the uh church project um but in the meantime while Paul's getting my bag I want to go ahead and I want to have prayer for uh those that's beginning starting back in school uh the school children College uh different ones teachers uh and so we want to just offer a word of prayer and maybe we can come forward parents like to come with them as well and we'll just have a word of prayer would that be all right I don't want to keep you standing the whole time I promise I'll let you get seated here very quickly but um we' like to just just come and amen and just ask the Lord's blessing and his protection that we as we enter in there into those School doors and those places we know that you know right now this is our um you know responsibility you know one day you know you'll be uh caring for homes and working together and all of those things and uh but right now this is this is what what God has for you to do and it's important and so you know we want to just ask the Lord just to watch over you equip you give you the the direction and what you need you know the one way I always approach things when I went into a college course I said Lord just let me get what I need to get I don't want anything more just what I need to get and in this day and age I'm thankful if friends if we ever had a moment where we can look at that and say he's my Hiding Place amen he's my covert my protection from the time of storm this is an hour we can say thank you Lord that you're my protection cuz when we walk out there I'm grateful to know that he said he never leave us nor forsake us and he's right there with us Evil's all around but remember he's right there with you at all times amen let's just pray together Heavenly Father Lord You're mindful of every moment of our life and every season of our life Lord sees change even Lord things within it Lord change now Lord has Lord these young people Lord and Lord and even sister N is a teacher every every one of us Lord there's this is a new year Lord It's A New Beginning there's things Lord that as they take upon their responsibility right now to Lord glean the things that's needed Lord in order father to move forward Lord in their life because the desire is to serve you Lord we don't want any of these things Lord to hinder us so we just Lord want to give our very best Lord to these things right now and ask that God that you would just go with them as they walk into these School Halls Lord their internships Lord classrooms Lord at colleges I ask oh God that may the angel of the Lord just accompany them Lord I pray and oh God just to watch over them Lord just the protection Lord oh God even Lord with Lord those that you would Lord uh that Lord that would want to be Lord drawn to them may oh God I pray you be just a real buffer Lord a protection oh God Lord that everything is evaluated Lord based on Lord of what a real true friend is Lord I pray that God you'll guide him in their studies Lord give them the understanding your Prophet taught us Lord in that message key to the door there's a key to math there's a key to science there's a key to music and there's a key to Knowing You Lord and that's Faith so Lord we're asking you who holds all these Keys Lord that God you would give them understanding Lord for these things of the natural bread Lord oh God and that their lives Lord might be kept Lord strengthened by the spiritual bread of life may you give Lord just a real peace Lord as Dad and Mom and Lord as they would every day Lord sending them out or even if they're homeschooled there would be such a peace and a Resolute no Lord knowing that you have Lord every step Lord in your hands and you're there to watch over him Lord God Hallelujah Lord Jesus like Moses mother when she Lord put him out there on those infested Lord Rivers Lord a river lord of the Nile and it was infested with crocodiles but Lord she had done one thing Lord she had prepared Lord that place of safety Lord pitched it with tar Lord and your Prophet told us Lord when a crocodile would go up Lord as though it was going to moveed to that basket Lord it would take Lord God that pitch Lord and it would be repelled Lord and how the angels of God your Prophet also said was right there guiding that basket Lord you know these things the course of life that is they're going through now Lord we're asking for the accompaniment of the angels of God that Lord you would guide them through safely Lord Lord and that they would Lord gather the things that's needed for the next and further step in their life should you T we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you amen God bless you I'll let you have your seats here just for a moment so I think we're live now you kick it over for me please okay uh I want to just just for sake of time I want to uh just quickly we talked about this the last time with what the way and sidewalk project and obviously we see uh the completion of that and we're thankful to the Lord uh for providing on that and then we uh made this uh approach I'm looking at uh for the parking lot and driveway project because seeing that there's a there's been a need out there and we're at a point where as far as we could start looking at that because uh you many of you remember in the past you You' have to walk through water and that that that in itself would have just been a it have been chaos to try to put something down because that water it would have just broke up in no time so with that I think it was two years ago with that uh drainage put down the side over there so that water would channel that way as well as when the sidewalk and all that was put in everything was lifted so that when we would come to this place the water we could get that water to drain on over there to that side so this is why that it's kind of taken everything in steps um so I want to just quickly just um uh bring it up to where we're at here uh the the the whole project itself um the whole entire uh cost within it uh you can see here I guess we can see if I'm in your way just say move in a Godly way but the total cost for the project was is um 66,6 $49 now that's that's that's just doing what what uh that company uh needs to do obviously anytime you it was just like when we got into this there's always some extra cost and things that come our way of things that we have to do here and there U but I want to say this right here we um we just certainly want to uh bring an update here and just uh give thanks to the Lord this is right here this is presently the offerings that's been received towards that and um the thing that I had proposed with the trustees is um is to draw from the savings uh that that we have and obviously not to deplete it right we don't want that at all but then um if we add those two together offerings received and then withdrawing from the savings this brings our total towards the project up to 63,600 $97. 90 I tell you that's enough to say Thank You Lord that's enough we could just have Paul come back up here and sing another song and once again say I'll just throw up my hands and so I want to just say in this regards this remembering the total project cost and then this in itself this was the uh this is the total amount I showed you we've rece received towards it um when we added that 30,000 from the the savings so the difference needed is $2,652 now that's exact um so if anyone uh wants to write out a check for that amount Brother Richard is standing with hands open um but um I will say it in this way I'm going to ask you to pray uh pray about it and you just let the Lord just um just um move move upon your heart I would say it's tremendous to see where we're standing here right now it's a real miracle and so we just I just want to say like this is kind of like a Finish Line you know when you're running a race you don't just you don't let up when you get to the Finish Line you just want to run all the way through it uh so if everyone would get their checkbooks out just I'm just teasing you but but in in all seriousness I want to um just say it in this way I'd like to just have us focus in on to lift the special offering you can all you can give at any time uh by writing on those envelopes special offering towards the parking lot but uh I'd like to just really hone in an opportunity

there Brianna when looking at that whole Avenue right there before we like even how to set up the drainage in the parking lot that's been years talking about that just the drainage because knowing that's a need to get the the pavement and those things because you've seen what it is when we have someone come and plow the snow and we've had you know the gravel just gets pushed up no matter how many requests we make it it happens and some of them say no I don't want to put shoes on the plow and this and that so uh and that's been a that's been a real challenge as well as you can see even after a Time coming in and out of the driveway so we thank God for providing and making a way for us amen and so uh we're just certainly looking forward amen so if you have your checkbook out while I'm preaching I won't be bothered but um oh my it's just to me it's so it's just just I'm so thankful to the Lord I really am I thank God for his mercy and uh I'm looking forward to this morning after

that he had uh they spoke to me at the last youth meeting and he been already talking with um his dad and his mom and so we are just thankful to that and uh just thankful amen for God's work and moving on hearts and lives amen so uh without any uh further Ado here let's let's just stand and we'll get right into the word of the Lord and uh could we go in the scriptures here to Ruth chapter 2 and uh I want to pick up here in Ruth chapter 2 verse 19 I also want to say I appreciate all the the brothers and I know that uh I came that have over the years and are attending to the grass I'm thankful to have grass that's cut aren't you and I come out here the the one day now I brother Joy might be over here doing it still but I I don't always we don't always intercept one another but brother Joy just looked like he was just having a good time out there I'm just glad no deer walked in front of him it's not season anyhow so but uh I just I really appreciate that don't you I really appreciate that it looks really really nice amen verse 19 of Ruth chapter 2 and it says and her mother-in-law said un her now this is Naomi speaking where hast thou gleaned today and where roughest thou Blessed Be he that did take knowledge of thee and she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had rought and said the man's name with whom I wrought today is Boaz and Naomi said unto unto her daughter-in-law Blessed Be he of the Lord who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead and Naomi said unto her the man is near of kin unto us one of our next Kinsman and Ruth the moabitas said he said unto me also Glory Thou shalt keep fast by my young men until they have ended all my Harvest and Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law it is good my daughter that thou go out that thou go out with his maidens that they meet thee not in any other field so she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley Harvest and of wheat Harvest and dwell D with her mother-in-law amen we'd like to just speak here for a few moments on accepting the counsel of the Lord amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated accepting the counsel of the Lord I think it's evident as we read through the scriptures you can see that Ruth the character that Boaz uh was able to recognize and regard her testimony already prior to Boaz meeting her aware that she had made her decision that where you go I'm going to go where you Lodge I'm going to Lodge thy God shall be my God and to know that she was already in a place of how that the approach was made to go out and to glean in the field and uh they were to glean you know uh they were coming in line as though those who were poor or those who did not have their of a crop or anything of their own but we can see how Ruth was able to be advised and receive the counsel of Naomi brother Brown will take it in in two different ways and to understand it he says of Naomi he says as Ruth was gleaning in the field she was gleaning the the old the promises that laid in the Old Testament he spoke of because we recognize that we're not beyond the old it's a fulfillment of the new is a fulfillment of the old and the New Testament it's Christ fulfilling his word through our lives now because Christ was the Fulfillment of the old is that right this the what we call the Bible is two books old and new male female it may it's one Union is that right so then when we're looking at this Naomi also the prophet types Naomi to be that of as the Holy Spirit dealing with the Church of the Living God and giving counsel and advice and wooing the Heart of Ruth of the church into the place and provided way where she needs to go so we understand that you know within this that this is Naomi's councel that uh as the Holy Spirit would lead to a place of full surrender and that's what God desires and that's the only thing that can ever that's the only way we can ever serve God is through a full surrender and that's the only way we can continue to walk with God is as we continue to surrender and that's it's a yielding that word y we never get away from yielding and that's where the Holy Spirit comes to draw us into a place of yielding his his presence It Never Comes This is what one of the other ways you can always sense when God's presence comes near is presence never brings pressure but his presence comes to lead us are you hearing me it doesn't his presence doesn't bring condemnation his presence it will bring conviction when we're wrong but it will all but it's but it will always reveal that he's the way out are you with me so we don't anything we do uh we don't do it halfway because there's really a you know you you don't you never seen you know a drunk sober man you you can't do anything halfway you we where desire is as we're gathered here this morning we want to be full-fledged Christians and we want to be filled with the spirit of God so we notice that within this the value of heeding to that Council anytime you look through the scriptures uh you find any time from the very beginning even when the fall took place in heaven you had you had those angels that fell from their first estate they f failed to keep the counsel of the Lord and so there was another word that came and they were led by that other word and it led them away from their first estate then we find it takes place in the garden God gave his word his word is his counsel his word is his advice but then we find that how that Satan always will come in and is to divert that around and and present it in a way like he did in Eden well surely God you know God's just a great big God of love and God wouldn't do that he he he he wants to lead the people of God away from the counsil of the Lord so we can see what what really is the result when his counsel his advice is not received then judgment follows that and even prior to that of judgment I uh I mean they hadn't known fear of what it was in the the garden they didn't know fear they didn't know of these things they didn't have they didn't know anxiety they didn't know none of these things but when that departure from the counsel of the Lord it opened the floodgates you see one step away from the word is one step away from God yes because he is the word and so just one little one little opening you know just one little crack like when you know you talk to people who do the Exterminating for uh whether it's mice or bats or whatever more they'll tell you they they don't need a big hole all they need is something about the size of a dime and they can get in yeah that's right uh some of you right now don't don't go to your house in your mind right now just stay here with me and you didn't realize that even with how they can walk right up siding walk right up I mean brick would be understandable up siding they how they and all those things you think oh my you know but but you see it becomes an opening one departure just one little word one departure it was one word that brought all of this so it's where it comes to that place that we recognize that you know when we're looking at the counsel of the Lord that anyone that has ever amounted to anything are those who have taken God at his word we don't try to figure it out but we just want to believe what he says unto us and anytime you know as we said any anytime you get away from the word then you believe anything because remember the word of the Lord is your discernment amen it's what brings discernment to your life so God makes God makes his counsel known he God doesn't uh keep things obscure he makes his counsel known by revealing and vindicating it because in everything the Reason God does it in that way he'll reveal it and vindicate it can we say that together reveal it and vindicate it the reason he does that is because you or I would not know how to approach him we would not know how to even act or go upon anything but when God reveals Faith begins to be built in our heart and then when he vindicates that way then that becomes an absolute it becomes a certainty like the man who found that pearl of great price he sold everything else and held on to that and so that's how when God makes himself known and he does that then that's the counsel of the Lord that we might have an assurance in our approach which is Faith are you hearing me I know I'm going I'm just laying this in here this morning it's faith and that's what here God is God confirms his word by his Spirit that's what causes Faith to arise in our hearts the Bible said in Hebrews 11:6 without faith it is impossible to please him we want to please him don't we amen for he that cometh to God must believe that he is not was but is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him if he did it before and the same conditions are met then he's God he'll do it again amen amen so this is where that you know as the prophet would refer to this and I've got some quotes that I'm not going to put up there but I'm just going to read and refer to and he says you know it would matter it would matter not how graceful you could pray how much repentance you could do it's your faith to believe that he's done it for you that's what brings you forth every sinner is saved tonight in the sight of Jehovah God but it'll never do you any good until you accept accept it and believe it and confess it and then he's the high priest of your confession to make it right before God now I want you to think about that you know that advice and counsel Even in our opening part of our text Ruth she discloses this is the man's name it's Boaz and so when she discloses that name Ruth has no idea who this is she has no idea of the significance because remember it was in the Old Testament where it's all the way laid down on what was needed when when when persons would be sold into slavery or land would go into a holding place while a debt was being paid or or how could this with where there's no sons in a family how could these daughters come in to a place of inheritance and all of this was laid out these laws of the Kinsman that it must be one who is of near King and you see God is a spirit Spirit cannot die cannot bleed but this is why that God created a blood cell God created himself a body to come down and dwell with you and I take our our debt upon him to pay that price that he himself might mold in our lives his own character and his own image God became kin folks with us through Jesus Christ only one mediator between God and man and that's the man Christ Jesus is that right so God so all of this laid there all of it was laid out in the Old Testament all of these things you I I want you to see it I'm not going to dwell on it and labor on it today but I want you to see that God himself has included what his thoughts have been all along concerning you and I his thoughts have been Redemption and Redemption is where one that belongs to one is brought back to that one there has to be a price that is paid in order to release that one who belongs to this person yes sir and God did that God came down thank Jes and he did that for you and I now this character that Ruth has it's been displayed Naomi is instructing her when she says uh I've been instructed by him but this is what he said to me he said these wonderful words he said don't go in another field stay right here by my maidens Naomi catches that and realizes listen your character has already been noticed but now within this it's important that you be not found in another field it's important that you be found with his maidens in field now I want you to think of this Ruth at that point if she had not already have had a willing heart she could have just stepped back at that moment and said hey he's already taken an interest in me it's not you that picked up handfuls of purpose it's not you that's received favor but it's me that's received favor Ruth could have said that but her heart listen there was a humility that was already present in her life and a humility that was able to hear this advice and this Council let me say this friends we never want to get to a place to where we begin to feel somewhat comfortable in our walk that we no longer need to seek after and heed to the counsel of the Lord as God would speak through us through his veils through his word through the message we need him until the very change of our bodies and then we'll stand there be gathered together with others and will'll rise to meet him in the air but until that time we are going to need the counsel of the Lord every step of our life this is why we do not trust our own selves even when you remember the Bible said let him that standeth that thanketh he standeth take heed lest he fall knows thanth Hallelujah I don't even trust my thoughts I don't want I don't want my thoughts to present some form of a comfortableness I want my the whole desire is is I'm seeking to please him I'm seeking to please him if there's things that want to try to take me out of this field of the revealed word I don't want it it's not worth it it's necessary that he find me in the field of his word and she took that advice now all of this is all of this display and she dwelt with her mother-in-law she dwelt now Ruth 3:1 then naom me her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall I I want you to catch this shall I not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee remember I read to you I think it's Ruth one chapter chapter 1 verse 9 where when there orpa and Ruth are leaving to go and follow Naomi and Naomi says why will you follow me I have't I can't give you I can't give you another husband if I have a child and I'm to get married you'll be too old right so that was enough for Orphan she said no hope for me in this you see what they was saying it was all about Oran that's what it was about it had nothing to do but Ruth Hallelujah Ruth was not about Ruth Ruth was about her mother-in-law that's why another place in the scripture I think I remember one of the Minor Prophets it is I don't have it before me but it says all of them that love thee speaking of Israel speaking of those of of of that of that portion all of them who love thee I tell you what as the Bride of Jesus Christ we love the word of God we love listen you cannot you can't despise Israel and love God right right we're here because they were blind for our sake and what was written in the Old Testament was prophecy concerning us are you hearing me I'm not talking about getting caught up in news I'm talking about we rejoice in the Old Testament being fulfilled we rejoice and see that what Jehovah was of the old is Jesus of the new we can see our place that we were hidden there in the groom in the Old Testament we were hidden in him but when he went into Calvary those promises of the hidden Mystery of I will lay my arm bear before many nations all of those promises were hidden in the groom where was Eve at she was hidden in Adam it was a mystery in Adam's life the bride was hidden there in the Old Testament and now it's Christ in you that reveals you are always a part of the [Music] [Applause] word notice when she tells them go on back I read it to you last week and may you find rest security security safety in the house of your husband in other words your your first husband's dead the law is you can be remarried you can go back to your land you can go back to all of that that you once knew you're free remember the Lord Lord Jesus John 666 666 right he gave him the opportunity right you want to go back right go back and the Bible said after many Saw The Miracles many walked backwards and didn't go on that's why it's important the counsel of the Lord but notice this is I want you to notice this difference here now says to Ruth she's taking the responsibility to find rest for herall my daughter shall I not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee now notice Naomi is not going to do it for her but she's going to give her the counsel the word that has been laying there that will open up or tie them back into their inheritance or the blessings of The Inheritance that belongeth to IMC which she is a part of that household yes amen you see you and I could not tie ourselves back in it took one coming for you and I and then through the marriage Union we are brought back into the Covenant amen outside of a union with Jesus Christ we have no inheritance amen that's why the baptism of the Holy Ghost the token the Seal of the Living God is a sign that as we have United with him and I also have a home Over Yonder is that right that's a candidate for Rapture now notice Boaz in verse two is not now Boaz of our Kindred with whose maidens thou was see no doubt this is this conversation's been had this is who he is he's no doubt he's he's our Kindred remember the maidens you've been with behold he went with barley tonight in the threshing floor he's they're separating the seed from the shuck he's separating who's separating who's doing it who is it that separated the bride from organization it's Christ himself the word come down amen separating where's he at he's in the threshing floor why because the Harvest has come and the seed has been gathered in am do you understand friends it is Christ himself that's winnowing wi I I don't know how to pronounce that word winth in our life it's when Christ even coming into our life let alone in the beginning it's separating us from unbelief and when the word comes into our life that word separates you from you it identifies you with Jesus Christ it separates you from your own desires from your own will why he winth barley in the threshing floor Hallelujah your life is a threshing floor is that right here we walk here we walk in this sticky and this carnal and this first birth but inside when the New Birth has come it is Christ himself the hidden man of the heart and he is wi he is win with he's moving apart what shock and Seed he's identifying what is really you and what is really not he's separating your natural birth from the first birth amen why that you might have faith in your approach to Rapture verse three wash thyself you got to wash all your ideas that's right wash away all your thinking that's good as a matter of fact I want you to let the word wash away everything you've ever thought about yourself Lord in the Book of Psalms in the book of Song of Solomon how God would Express and speak that thou mayest forget the home of thy Nativity right who brings a strength for us to be able to forget first of all there has to be a forgiveness when there's forgiveness then forgetting comes in that's so good are you with me ah wash thyself an anoint thee Oh My she's got access and put thy reignment upon the she's got the right dress it's an address now watch Naomi I can't dive into this too much tonight or today but Naomi is not planting Ruth to be seductive no that's right that's not what this is about at all because you can't deceive the word oh Lord I I really want to serve you but remember he's looking not at our tears or anything that's coming out here he's listening to the call from our heart amen we can't deceive him is that right he's listening to where is our heart oh I say we want to say Lord let my heart say Amen Lord let my soul say so be it Lord is that right that's why the prophet could stand in the meeting he said I hear you saying amen with your mouth but I hear you in your heart saying this is telepathy same things coming out of one channel oh this is why I want to say Lord let everything be lined up my thoughts let all every part of me let it be lined with the word of God Amen oh my put the rment upon thee get thee down to the floor but don't make yourself known unto the man until he hath done eating and drinking you've got a time you've got to wait wait till he's done hallelujah now watch this in verse four what's the spirit of Prophecy and it shall be when he lith down that thou shalt Mark the place where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down watch this prophecy and he will tell thee what Thou shalt do in other words I can take you so far giving you the word and if you will come according to the word that's where he will step in and take you from there hallu oh now that's prophecy and she said unto her all that thou sayest unto me I will do so Naomi's taken this responsibility and I I think of how fitting when the prophet would preach invisible Union of the bride of Christ that he would open that message and the prophet would speak of how that he says this chapter of Romans 7 it pertains to marriage and divorce he said but I believe he says it tains attains to even a higher portion than that of just a natural marriage and divorce he says it pertains to that which is spiritual and so brother R would take among now think about this he standing in Jack Moore's Pulpit there in in treport Louisiana Pentecostal assembly it's where remember the gifts had come back on isua Street brother Bram has preached there at the at the uh 50 years after isua and brother BR preaches two important messages and he talks about uh uh return and Jubilee the first night and then he preaches the way back the second night and a man who was actually there at isua Street an older man comes up after the first night of returning Jubilee at the end of it steps up to the microphone he's trembling and it begins to say he said we got to get back we got to get back we got to get back to where we're at and he's just talking to brother Bram but you didn't realize that you and I and even that were Pentecost because the full word had not come they had received a restoration of the gifts but they could see the word was letting them see and show them you departed from the counsel of the Lord man look where they're at now but it was already pointing then is that right and yet now God is calling calling out of that church calling out of the of that lady oan age he's calling us into that place of surrender to his coming and he would say to them in this way he says this message I love this he says this message that we are about to speak he said it's to the church to the body of Christ that we're trying to lead to deeper thoughts and higher objectives believing that the coming of the Lord is at hand if there's ever a group of people if there's ever an hour that we need higher objectives deeper thoughts it's right now and how could you and I get there if not for the mercy of God to lead you and I to that place where it causes us to reflect and consider the moment and the hour according to the promise of where we're standing amen think about this the Bible said in Jeremiah 10:23 oh Lord I know that the way of man is not in himself in other words what God intends for man to be right sure parents they rais us and there's a there should be an admonition there should be a direction and because the Bible says in the nurture and the admonition means the full full counsel but yet that in itself how could we know what to do except God would instruct us the way is not in himself so in other words God did not bring us here and say you're on autopilot figure this out we can't we need him to guide us it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps oh my and this is why the prophet in that message would say oh he says when when this bride when she would begin to come back and line herself up with the word of God you watch he said at that time there'll be a message sweep out to catch that bride that woman that elect now I want you to think of something here in Ruth chapter 2 at verse 12 I I'm not going to dwell on this for for a lot but I want you to catch with this word in here because where Ruth is at in this in this moment in this time the Bible said the Lord recompense thy Work and a full this is Boaz talking to her when he first meets her and a full reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel so anything that's going to come it's got to come from him amen are you with me you see Boaz is a word man amen come on somebody Boaz is a Kinsman he's a word man under whose wings Thou Art come to trust you know what it was that swept over Ruth that caused her to make a decision that she made it's true there had to be something within her a predestinated seed and as the Winds of the Holy Spirit the season the time it swept over it pulled something in her to make a decision when she didn't even know how are the events going to unfold but the wings of Jehovah Eagle swept over her life and she trusted in the wings of the Lord wish we had some time there just for today but we'll get there but notice These Wings notice what God Said in Exodus 19:4 this is out of the message God who is rich in Mercy in Exodus 19:4 God told Israel I carried you notice I carried you away on Eagle wings and brought you to myself carried them On Eagle's Wings and brought you to myself there was other men in the middle of that sea out there trying to impersonate remember Pharaoh's Army followed him into the sea trying to impersonate but he carried them on Eagles Wings God always Likens His prophets to Eagles and what was it Moses was his messenger and they were following Moses and that was the Eagle wings that they were carried on because he was packing God's message they were following Moses let me read it again and that was the Eagle wings they were carried on because he Moses was packing God's message so you know what it was the message is what gave him lift Hallelujah not just something to come over you it's got to be coming underneath that Wing as well is that right it was a lift that's what this message come to do lift you it come to lift you from your thinking it come to lift you from who you are it came to lift you it came to give a lift when you couldn't lift yourself you couldn't even lift up your head but he came by the we K of Jehovah brought lift [Music] Hallelujah brother Bram said they perish not with them those who who went on they perish not with them who believe not those who followed that word God was rich in Mercy to them because they were following his Commandments and God wants us to follow his Commandments I say yes Lord amen even when it don't make sense to me that that don't matter it ain't about my sense it's about following there's things that you know we can Fellowship on this that we God has asked us to do it didn't make a lick of sense to us in our reasoning but you move upon it and you watch God step on the scene and it ain't just with us this Bible is filled of paradoxes tell me how marching around walls seven days and on the seventh day seven times tell me how marching around walls are going to bring the walls down it wasn't their marching it was their faith and obedience to the word and God brought the walls down God show you follow my Commandments I'll bring walls down I'll take walls down in your marriage I'll take walls down in your home I'll take wall I'll men I'll move Hall you believe that pise Lord Brother Bram said Moses know that he was to carry those children over into the Promised Land because the promise was given to him and he must Pat them to the promised land and he said today the holy spirit is here to vindicate God's word that's the eagle Wing that we're supposed to ride on not some man-made theology we are to ride upon the wings of the eagle to the promised land now remember that scripture I'm re reading from here drawing from where Naomi said shall not I seek rest for thee Hallelujah and John 1613 when he the spirit of Truth is come he will lead and guide you into all truth John 20 John 10 and verse 4 this Bible said the Sheep he says he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the Sheep follow him and they know his voice Psalm 1611 thou will show me the path of Life are you seeing this it's him thou will show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are Pleasures forever more how many know that he still shows you the path for your life decisions that we have before us that Lord you've been my choice I only want you so wherever you're at that's what the choice I want to make if you're not in this I don't care how religious I don't care how good I don't care how right it seems feels I don't want to walk by my feelings my sense says I want to walk by the word amen thou will show me the path of life this is a man who knows his God he never brought me this far to leave me amen oh Psalms 328 I love this scripture I will instruct Thee I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which Thou shalt go I will guide thee with mine eye you know what the eye is it's the pillar of fire it's the angel of the Lord amen it was the same one that led Moses and Moses followed it's the same one that they followed and it brought him to the other side it's the same eye that Joshua looked through and saw the walls of Jericho come down it's the same eye that came among the Church of the Living God and they begin to move and walk under the direct under unction of the very eye of God oh I'm thankful for the eye of God aren't you this is the admonition be not as the horse or as the mule which hath no understanding isn't it amazing how God will take things in his word remember you stay with the type as long as it's on the type and then get off of it in the song Song of Solomon Chapter 1 it said I have compared thee oh my love to one of those in Pharaoh's chariots in other words feral bread so the only thing that God wanted us to get out of there is your pedigree you got some papers your name has already been written on a book we can trace your birth back to the Lamb's Book of Life back to the mind of God but when it comes to the rest of it we don't want Horse Sense we want to live by that reality of our pedigree be not as the horse or the mule which have no understanding whose mouth must be held in with bit and Bridal lest they come near unto thee got to be held in position held in position God's desire is trust me and I will guide you all the way do you realize this is what it was it took relationship and I hope you're with me just a moment there was a relationship that was already between Ruth and Naomi right right there was a trust already being built oh yeah let me just pause for a moment don't let the enemy shame you for where you might be in your walk with God but I want to be very very clear with you this morning make sure in your life that Lord let that trust be built to where I can step out fully on your word are you hearing me this is this is how you pray remember brother BR say many times I'm going to pray and and you pray after me these are ways these are how you need to pray is Lord let that trust be built because when she is going into Boaz she's not going into a stranger right she knows this man not because they dated but but she has known got to known his character are you hearing me so the word and the character all is lining up but notice this we want to be harnessed to the to the word of God I I want to just I want to dropped us in in the message leadership brother Bram says it like this there's no one no one denomination can claim us a real Christian because you belong to God denominations are man-made and Christianity is Heaven Sent simply put you say how can you say that denomination because go to begin to press them on promises and what's written in the word and that will let you know very quickly that they do not believe the word of God they've got Parts they believe and parts they don't you know why because they're not following the pillar of fire they're following manmade traditions and that's why it looks like a man but real Christians look like God they look like Believers there's something different about their life you know why cuz it's not man-made yes it's heaven sent your new birth was Heaven Sent you say heaven sent yes a channel has been opened a place to get into shall I not seek rest for thee praise God but in all these things brother brah says this as good as they are as we find as we come together nice meetings we have social understanding we have we're each one confronted with eternal life and no matter how successful we've been in business how successful we've been and what a great church member we are how we work how we try to do things right if it's not done in the right way it is worship of God in vain Jesus said the same thing he said in vain do you worship me teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of man what happened just that little deviation from the counsel of the Lord and now it's vain worship one little deviation brings vain worship vain worship is lifeless that's right because where Life Is Life produces itself is that right now watch this now he says a sincere honest worship with the sincerity of your heart to God and still be in vain it began that way with Cain at the Garden of Eden sincere worship but was rejected very religious still rejected notice even when God pointed out to Cain he was upset he was upset he was the first person to ever got mad in church that's right he was mad I did all this work and nothing nothing and him he takes something that's already provided he didn't bring that little lamb forth he brought that up here and he put that lamb on there and now I I've seen what happened I see that Pillar of Fire come now and accept that sacrifice hallelujah what K should have done he said God thank you for correcting the eror of my way amen he should have just humbled himself right there instead he got mad because God didn't come to his sacrifice God didn't come to his way God's not obligated to come to our way he's only obligated to his word Cain was sincere right but he rejected even when God vind ated it and he said if thou doest well you want to be accepted worship like your brother if thou doest well Thou shalt also be accepted right but if you don't sin lies at the door what was he talking about the door of his heart oh my notice the prophet goes on to talk about same same message next paragraph down and refers back to the message that he's just preached in treport on doing God a service with without a being at his will this is this was just days before the Lord took him home he says you know that sounds strange but we've got to channel ourselves into God's provided Channel and God's way of doing it no matter how much we think it's right it's got to be according to the word of the Lord or it's in vain right he said Cain worship but it wasn't according to the word of the Lord see it wasn't the counsel of the Lord King knew or was fruit that took us out but it was natural fruit it was natural fruit they were taught that by their parents but because Abel was of the Heavenly parent God was not going to let him go in error amen are you hearing me God's obligated to his word don't just look at this Bible if you're a part of the word God has always been obligated to you been o obligated to me even when we were on and astray but God is obligated to his word he's the one that sought us out he's the one that brought us to himself because we were always a part of him Lord Proverbs 14:12 the Bible said there is a way which seeth right unto man but the end thereof that's right are the ways of death notice there is a way that seeth right to a man so one man has a way that he thinks right but then notice the latter part but the end thereof when he gets done going his his way singular the end thereof are the ways of death why because it not in man to direct himself he needs almighty God in his life let me tell you something friends God ain't calling you and I to a church God's calling you to a personal relationship with him are you hearing me not to where it's just a pastor you pack in your back pocket and the pastor is your holy ghost that doesn't mean you go out here and you just act on your own and do whatever that's not a son of God either but a Son of God will always recognize the leading of the Holy Spirit and the counsel of God's word and it'll follow according to that and when it doesn't then there's consequences there's decisions we can make and we'll reap the decisions from that is that right let me give you an example Joshua and them came in the land man they Jericho what a victory but because Council was not heeded and aen took a wedge of gold when that happened they went into Ai and they were defeated right if you notice AI God told him the treasures could pass through the fire and come into the camp but at Jericho he said I don't want you touching none of it burn it all it just shows you you got to wait on God's appointed time sometimes they're absolutely approved but you got to wait on God's appointed time and in God's appointed time the fire will be there for it to pass through that's what I want don't you I want the things that are before me Lord Lord you help me give me the patience until it's the appointed time because at the point of time he is there our the presence of God the fire of God and it can pull it right through because if it can't be pulled through I don't want it I don't want it there's curse attached to it what is Curse bondage well my deprived of Victory I don't want that I want Victory notice many the end thereof are the ways of death so there's many ways to death but there's one way to life One Way old song they used to sing one one one one way to God is that right too bad they forgot that sing it but forgot it second Timothy 2:5 if a man also strive for masteries yet is he not crowned except he strive lawfully that's it he's got to come according to the word is that right amen now now you come to Matthew 7 and Jesus tells us what will take place there that even before the white Throne judgment now the Bride of Jesus Christ is not going to stand in the white Throne judgment she'll be standing with him as his Queen but this is what will be declared in that hour not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord means master master you're my own owner you're my owner shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day Lord Lord master master have not we prophesied in thy name it means preached and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful Works notice notice what they are laying before him we've preached your word we've cast out Devils we've done many wonderful things in thy name but his response will come back I never knew you meaning the word knew I never had a relationship with you you lived under the rain that was coming off the rain falleth on the just and unjust the sun cometh on you lived on that and as a matter of fact he can look look look because he spoke it through the mouth of the seventh angel he will even point out to them you held to the gift in your life above the word you held to talents in your life you held to this and oh I feel the anointing this must be exactly right you check every anointing by the word come on friends as the Bride of Jesus Christ well I feel led to do this I feel led then it ought to check out with the word you see for the bride ofes Jesus Christ it ought to be something it's a desire in my life I don't care how good it feels because sometimes I feel L can be the a caveat for Lord I don't want to know what you think I don't we don't want to go that way we want to be prisoners this is what this message come to produce prisoners of Jesus Christ the kind of prisoners that the prophet was instructed by the spirit of God pick up your pen and write that the Bride of Jesus Christ will have the mind of Christ and they do only his will no one can persuade them to do otherwise are you with me I'm talking about the mind of Christ we're living in an hour friends we don't want to just be hitting the target we're here to hit the bullseye it's not up to you and I to configure it it's God has provided for us that the bullseye might be help if we'll look through the right channel hallelujah amen am I never knew you depart from me you work iniquity they accepted an honor let me see if I can get to a place here they accepted an honor and an approval above the word of God listen this message came to you and I I tell you you you hear you had said a lot you're going to continue here be said we are blessed that God God would send this message that he promised in his word to you and I because let me tell you what this message is this message is Jesus Christ revealed to be the same yesterday today and forever it's a promise in his word I I thought as I'm listening to the message in 1965 of leadership I thought of how the prophet takes that message and he deals with especially you find it he's he's honing in after the seals of open and showing us of how that that word it's got the anointing of the holy spirit it's got to come down to the inside to where there is a complete change of desires and nature to where it's not just something where we're going Upon A gift or a feeling or an emotion it's got to be something that brings rest the Christian life is not meant to be a life of turmoil up and down unsettledness it's a life to be established in Psalms 27 thou Hast set me upon a rock thou has healed me let me just try to wrap this my time is gone let me just wrap this point we'll pick it up here this is why God would speak to us with such Clarity in this hour it's for you and I when there's things that we can look at just as I said moments ago about rest and settlement these are things let me just say this to you now I'm going to just drop into maybe a counseling mode here when you're hearing the word come like that across your life let me tell you something God's not trying to run you out of the sanctuary what he's trying to do if there's things that you're seeing at that moment those are moments and times to say Lord I'm going to take this and pray about it Lord I want a settledness in my life I want rest in my life Lord this is what you've promised Lord You're The One Lord who makes it real Lord you're the one who does this you see what God is doing if we leave out of here and we don't pray about anything then I think we've missed it it ought to be things we leave out of here and just say Lord just be it unto me Lord there's things God spoke to our hearts that we can pray about let me just read this in closing my I wish I had much more time here and the reason I say that is because sometimes it's hard to get back into that same point that same vein but I have there's there's much here and I want to lay this in I don't want to just skip it I want to lay it in the prophet said Jesus alone can lead you to that eternal life there's no church no denomination no preacher no priest no nothing else can lead you to it you must be led by him the only one that can lead you could you imagine him now here's where he tested could you imagine him leading you out of his word which that's him if he is the word and you're a part of him won't you be part of the word the word that God wants to pour the Waters of Salvation upon today to identify him today like the apostles identified him Luther and Wesley and all the rest of them identified him in their day it was the word in that day and so the prophet said the things that we see taking place now is predicted in this hour so accept Jesus Christ and let him lead you to eternal life is to accept him and let him lead you I think that's probably a good place to just draw it up right there Hallelujah don't stop keep moving accept him let him lead you keep leading how far how how do how how long do I follow you follow until the very atoms of this body are changed until until you see your loved one standing before you following daily daily seeking Lord let thy will be done in earth even as it is in heaven Lord lead me you know it's before me today you know the traps that are out there today Lord lead me Lord I want to walk according to your counsel Lord Lord God I don't trust my feelings I don't trust my reasoning because listen I've gotten myself in trouble God never got me in trouble God has never ever led me wrong I've went under Impressions and oh I felt this or I felt that and all of it at the end of the day you realize Satan when he steps back after that then you'll come around and say see there's nothing to you look at you you can't even find the leading of the Holy Spirit what kind of a person must you be it's Satan wanted to lay a trap to try to destroy your confidence but let me tell you something it was not your good works that brought you where you are it was Boaz that took notice of your life and though you may have faltered though you may have failed though at times we went after wrong Impressions but that's a time to get back up and be lined right back up and say Lord forgive me Lord I'm going to walk on with you because remember your confidence can never ever be in yourself the prophet said you get to lifting even up a man he said God will let that man make a mistake to shake your confidence back to where it needs to be are you hearing me I've watched that I've watched those things take place because why people oh this man and we need to follow this man and oh this man is the one who needs to pray for us oh this man is the one and they what it begins to follow a man and toste of recognizing what is it that has touched my life has been God Amen well God just don't have one address he dwells in a many membered body is that right he dwells in a many membered body and you know what we can have that same kind of cry like David David said oh I have longed to see your glory and your power in these dry places like I have in your Sanctuary David you may leave that there can be a move of God in dryness even in times of dryness of where things might be in your life I absolutely do because I know him in that way I not only know him to be the god of his Sanctuary but I am a part of his sanctuary and I know that he's God right where I am you love him I want to accept the counsel don't you I want to go all the way with him those who walking in waters of baptism today just like just like the rest of us when you start out and you make that step you let that determination be I'm follow him all the way I F him all the way in the waters of baptism I'm following him all the way into the Holy Ghost I'm following him all the way step by step by step of the way until I stand there that day on the other side I'm going to keep going forward yeah amen and anybody any friend anything that wants to come my way that wants to get my eyes and get me to turn this way or that way I'm going to keep my eyes on him you know why the Bible said concerning Elijah spoke to Elisha he said if thou seest me when I go you shall have the promise all he had to do he had a lot of distraction he had a lot of things but the first thing that Elisha did he said I've got to take care of this that's holding me right here I've got to take care of this he he chopped up the wood he cut up the oxen he burnt every bridge back it one no such thing as if this don't work out I can always go back to plowing Fields nope you know what you know why God called Elisha cuz he's a man that could plow a straight road and God has called your life cuz there is a real path in your life for the glory of God to move down through and be made manifest in your life if you see me when I go then you can have that double portion a lot of things tried to distract him a lot of things tried to come his way is that right but Elisha even Elijah said you can stay right here hey you can stay right here Elijah said nope I'm going with you cuz you said if I see you when you go then I can get what is I'm Desiring well who told you I never told you you could have a abortion oh no you didn't per se as a man but when that mantle came across me when the wings of the Holy Spirit when it came across my life that was the voice of God that let me know that the promise of God is for me and that my purpose was not just to plow Fields behind oxen I was meant to be a vessel for God to make himself known through and live in let those are being baptized let others maybe here this morning where where you're at with god listen a lot of distractions try to come your way but you have to make up your mind and when you make up your mind and I'm not just talking about human mind I'm talking about make up your mind based on the word his presence that you sense right here the presence of the Lord let me tell you something this ain't a man there ain't no music going it is the presence of Our Redeemer our kinsman redeemer is in the building amen he's here to make good on his word and his promises and it's up to us if we'll take the advice and the counsel and say Lord I accept it Lord maybe you're praying about something in your life decision Lord I want your counsel Hallelujah maybe you're praying about the Holy Ghost Lord I want your counsel Lord maybe you're praying about healing in your body I want your counsel Lord I Want You Lord I want your thoughts Lord I want your thoughts you love him this morning morning aren't you thankful for the counsel of the Holy Spirit God's word come and breathed down upon this generation upon this word to where you and I look at this word and it's an absolute because it's a living person then I say give everything you've got to him amen turn loose of everything else anything you're holding on to it's not worth it look at him and look at what you're holding on to no comparison turn loose of what you're holding on to don't hold on to it turn loose of it and let him take a hold of you you love him let's pray Heavenly Father you see father all throughout the congregation Lord those that would be archiving streaming you see each one of us Lord and father we're standing here this morning Lord

appointed season this is the rest this is the way to rest this is the pathway this is that path of life and Ruth with complete trust in the wings of the Lord she was able to hear the same wings oh glory be to God a wonderful but one the same wings that Ezekiel heard that John heard that Isaiah heard she heard the voice oh yeah of when those wings were moving she heard it as it came through Naomi my daughter shall I not seek rest for thee Oh glory be to God a word a word Lord where she found not her name written no covenants no promises but yet the word spake out himself and said my daughter shall I not seek rest for thee Lord Jesus I pray right here this morning I know there's hearts Lord there's lives Among Us that Lord that are in need of that rest may they take that counsel Lord from your word father I pray that God right Lord with a real honest and sincere heart they would laid their way down right now and say Lord I want to enter into that rest Lord lead me into that rest I can't find it on my way I can't do it on my own Lord I realize that lead me Lord I'll follow like Ruth said in her closing remark to Naomi before she went to do an enter in there to the threshing floor she said all that thou sest unto me Glory I Will Do Lord grant it this morning may hearts and lives Lord even from this moment that we have been gathered together Lord God is the prayer that Lord would be uttered from their hearts Lord to say oh God remedy everything Lord in me that's unlike you Lord take it out Lord if there's anything Lord that's a hindrance if there's anything Lord that's keeping me Lord from that place of rest if there's anything anything Lord that's troubling the rest that I'm in Lord oh God let me be like Nehemiah and shut them away from the

I just I know that this is God or I feel and then all of a sudden at the end of it Lord you're left Lord and such a place and where Satan would want to ridicule him Lord would want to run them down but I ask oh God for the angel of Mercy this morning Lord that you would move back down may the great wings of Jehovah Eagle Lord when they can't even lift their head Lord God or have a confidence
