TRANSCRIPT
========================================
things in a moment and a twinkling of an eye and just as we're standing in that and expecting that hunt also comes with this promise a release of the anointing of the spirit of God where you and I are able to look at every opposition every obstacle no matter what it's been down through time we're able to stand there with a liberty and say who ought to hold great Mountain because the Rapture is not like a sieve in other words you're going in a Rapture and then everything just drops off of you that's not what the Rapture is well when the Rapture comes it'll just take me up through an elevator and I'll be a good boy and a good girl that's not what the Rapture is because brother random says it's so clear in recognizing his day in his message he said if you did if if you've got a you got a temper here you have a temper over there of course it won't be there because because the Rapture is a change of dwelling place it's not a seed that sifts everything away it's character that's being taken so in reality Satan has no ground to stand on but Samuel that's pretty bold that's where the word of God stands and we're standing with the word whoever is on the Lord's Side let him stand by me the word of God is here we're not here to pamper Satan we're here to address it I want you to notice who and thou who art thou old great mountain and thou shalt it's speaking to a being a being and that being is Satan that's what it's speaking to it's a Satan this is a spiritual Warfare in a battle now let me lay this in Ephesians 6 10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand so here it's speaking of a battle and the necessity to have the right equipment to fight this battle it's not a flesh and blood affair it is a spiritual battle there isn't a battle where there's an engagement between right and wrong between God and Satan and this battle has been going on down through every age and so just as much as the war is against principalities Powers spiritual wickedness in high places the whole armor of God is not something that is a flesh and blood origin or something that is outwardly but it is the armor of God which is God's word the holy spirit inside the life of the believer because he made a promise when the enemy comes in like a flood I the Lord will raise the standard against him and he makes the word more sure how can he make the word more sure well he'll he'll have debates debates don't make the word more sure come on debates can change a person's mind for a period of time but it's got to take something deeper than that and the standard we're talking about is when God himself his word his life comes down on the inside by the new birth then it is the standard of the word inside of our life here we are in this moment battles and remember that this battle that we are engaged in because we're engaged in it this battle the first battle was fought in heaven think of it in heaven not out in Skid Row alley in heaven Lucifer led a rebellion is that right and there were some angels that followed his lie right his tail not t-a-i-l the Bible says t-a-l-e he gathered him with his tail t-a-l-e his lie Satan gathers by lie God gathers by truth oh Hallelujah and this battle was thrown down to heaven and I want you to watch how the prophet says this this battle was thrown down from Heaven to Earth and it fell on human beings then the battle from Angels become human battles and Satan come to destroy God's creation what God had created to be for himself he Satan had come to destroy this that's what his purpose was was to destroy it remember that's his characteristic you can always evaluate when things want to come in your life I don't care if it's relationships I don't care if it's jobs I don't care what it is you need to look is this increasing my stature in the Lord or is it taken away come on Friends the devil's a slicker [Music] he's a slick tongue fella right smooth talker right he wanted to make her feel like she's somebody she's something he knows what he's doing but his intent and his purpose is destruction and you can look at and say well how do I know it's destruction what I'm feeling right now he felt pretty good when he was talking to her in the Garden of Eden but look at the destruction right now you and I have the pains in our body ambulances going up and down the street all because one listened to his lie and death entered in anything that reasons against the word of God is your enemy come on Friends anything that reasons against the word of God I'm talking to bride and material here this morning that's able to look there regardless of race Creed or color and evaluate things under the leading of the spirit of God is this adding to my life or taken away from my life I ain't talking about your personal life I'm talking about your life in Jesus Christ blessed Lord oh God help us this morning we're talking about an opposition are you with me I've seen too many things over the years where relationship s saying else take people right out of the house of God you know why they didn't never get really Anchored In Jesus Christ and it's to recognize you know let me tell you something you have to understand and know where you're at [Music] is that right this is why you don't go on the devil's Crown you have to know where you're at that ain't a sign of weakness that's a sign of knowing where you stand this is where I'm at and I'm not going on the Devil's Ground we've seen family have seen everything else you know what it all comes down to it's more than flesh and blood it's spirits oh glory be to God that was his purpose then the battle began here on Earth and it's beginning us it's been raging ever since so where is this battle where is this battle it's in the mind it's a Battleground the Battleground the mind is no man's land when they fight a battle there is a neutral place where you engage and the mind is the Battleground it's the Mind listen to me it's the mind that either accepts opens up and accepts what's coming or it closes and rejects are you hearing me now your mind oh my the mind is a gate it's just like if you have a gated community I know there's been you know things over the years you go to deliver things and you think I'm in a gated community and nobody's at the gate like you all had to go in a steel mill right right through a gate I don't even know if they put anybody out there anymore maybe they do but you understand that they don't they don't put nobody out there anymore what's a good having a gate right I mean if they had somebody come in there and do all sorts of things oh what happened you didn't stop them at the gate because in order to get through the gate they've gotta they've got work IDs you got to pass that off scan it or whatever they do you can't just get on they go through there but what happens become relaxed they come relax let me tell you something your mind my mind any of our mind you cannot become relaxed and Satan's Duty oh Satan's a misogynist just relax oh oh oh yeah right there oh that's Satan's Duty yeah to do to get it all take him down but when it comes notice it's your mind that opens or accepts it's your mind that opens the door or closes closes the door to listen to your conscience or your memory or your affections but when your mind closes itself and I want you to catch this when your mind closes itself to these things talking about to all of those other things conscience memory affection reason when it closes itself to whatever their whatever is trying to come through those Avenues when your mind closes itself to these things and let God the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of the stuff out every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of Doubt is gone every feeling is gone man we could preach a Month of Sundays on that when the spirit of the word you let it come in you say what is that him that's speaking to you dealing with your life what do I do let accept him accepted him and let the spirit of the word remember I was one who was awakened I like one wake and out of my sleep it was an angel It's the spirit of God that's opening our understanding to things right where the words going forth we just don't want to set their numb but when he's dealing with us say Lord tell me what you're trying to show me to me Lord God because if he's touched you it's his desire to reveal it to you [Applause] I just read a quota even last night brother REM said you are a blessed person if God has come by your way and knocked on your heart he said do you realize there's people that will never receive that knock what must I do you can take that knock and walk with an authority and say every promise and everything that God has intended for my life he came looking for me halleluia [Applause] but the statement what's going on we're receiving the spirit of the word to blow out sensations of fear blow out doubt I don't know I'm telling there's power in this word there's power in the word of God the spirit of God gets a hold of that word there's power in it oh he's nothing he said there's nothing that can stand but there but the word of God and Satan cannot battle against that he said these battles has raged since the day of the Garden of Eden the battle in the human mind now let me read here in First Corinthians 11. notice how Paul picks this up went to God that you could bear with me a little in my folly and indeed bear with me for I am jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband all right that I may present you as a Chase virgin to Christ but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subility now notice how did the beguiling come through his subtility show your minds should be corrupted for corrupted from so corruption sets in by what the satility and it corrupts us from something corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ can you say that with me the Simplicity that is in Christ for in he that cometh preacher another Jesus if they live in another Jesus come on now the Bible said use words when necessary otherwise your life preaches a sermon right if they preach another Jesus whom we have not preached all right or if you receive another spirit which he have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted so they've already accepted what is true but what Paul was letting them know that that Satan is not going to rest remember when he gathered all the the pastors around there and acts before his departure he said he said Satan is Desiring to come in as Grievous wolves among the flock now let me just tell you something Satan's not a lazy guy the Bible pogles on the talking about how that his Ministers of they transformed themselves to be angels of light like whoa I got new understanding but if it's understanding that's against the word of God you better forsake it you better call it a lie and you better run as fast as you can because it's not Liberty it's not understanding it's a lie it's deceived and will damn your soul to hell that's how powerful it is and I know hell isn't even preached on within churches no more because you know why there's some of them that have even preached it that it's done away with what nonsense hell is still real but the Bible said hell was created for the devil and his angels for human beings not for lives to go there amen but remember there was one and Jesus spoke of that rich young man that when he turned down his opportunity he lifted up his eyes in him are you hearing me now they're one of the guy that this guy that would lift up his eyes and hell wasn't a guy on Skid Row this was a guy who knew verses from Sunday School let's just stay with this for him to come and preacheth another Jesus let me just go on this is what you're in the the we are to do last part of it ye might well bear with him in other words endure it stand against it it's hard not to preach on every point but I'm talking about this some Simplicity now corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ corruption itself you you know you've seen things in some of you in the Medical Science and everything else too you know this corruption sets in little by little right and then eventually it's like we need to take that off hmm what's going on corruption it sets in little by little by little right remember I had a an individual one time a young man I'm about 12 years old he had this there you know he kind of had a cut on his leg you know how kids I mean I thought about it myself I thought man how many times I picked scabs you know I know it's not beautiful to talk about but you just stay with me okay the problem of it is he got into picking it because they itch sometimes right but all that itching and all that stuff is all part of healing going on but he would get to start picking that but the scab is also there it signifies healing's taking place and when it's finished the scab will come off are you hearing me oh my God glory be to God but he had they end up having to put him in the hospital for Mercer because he kept picking the scabs and infection set in y'all talking about a young man 12 13 years old they didn't know may have to end up making him taking his leg off just from a simple scab of picking at something and Corruption sets in that's how simple corruption is in our life but there is one who deals with corruption you don't have to pick at it he's a Healer [Applause] he not only come to set the captive free he not only is here to bind up the Brokenhearted but he's also to heal them that are bruised yes ma'am man oh man I wish I had a Month of Sundays to preach right now at this moment and I want you to understand this Satan's desire is to hinder or stop the move of God in your life he'd like to stop it and you're like I don't care who you are I don't care who I am he wants to stop it I don't care where you are in your journey his objective is to stop it yeah he knows let me tell you something he knows that he can't stop the work of the Holy Spirit but he wants to minimize the effect and the work of the Holy Spirit I know that once again I wanted to refer to a few scriptures here the Bible says in first John 4 1 Believe beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world trium whether they're of God not whether or not I felt good who good Lord when I took a shower I feel good when I when I eat something I like apple crisp I feel good when I ain't talking about the song either yeah you feel good about certain things but it ain't about feelings Satan can bring corruption just because of feelings because many false prophets are going out into the world hereby know you the spirit of God every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God this is not talking about 2 000 years ago he's the same Lord Jesus in a many-membered body to deny the Holy Ghost is a sign that's an evil spirit [Applause] he's the same God does the same things acts the same way his death didn't stop him Acts chapter 1 verse 1 of Theophilus the things that Jesus began to do and the prophet picks it up in the token and says and continues to do because his death didn't stop him it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever same God that's why even every believer down through every age did not just look back at the messenger but they recognized that what God did through the messenger it was a message that was being spoken a message that was being lived a message that was being released for them and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh help me now is not of God and that is the spirit of antichrist not anti-word oh no they told the Bible but Antichrist because you can have all the word you want but if you don't have the spirit of the word and the spirit of God this is nothing but a dead letter but it takes the spirit to bring it to life come on now the law was a good thing but it takes the spirit in order to bring the word to life this ministry of the spirit of God is the glory that excellence you know why because it's not bringing Just conviction conviction it's God coming in and rewriting lives Jude chapter 1 verse 3. beloved when I gave all diligence carefulness to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the Saints thank you I tell you what you're going to fight for something don't tell me oh I'm not a fighter you're a liar you'll fight for something sometimes you can take people be a man there'll be a passive could be touch their children they'll fight buddy even if their children is wrong as wrong can be they'll fight come on now but there's some things that we need to really contend for yep come on and Lord we need the Relic content for is the faith that was once delivered so if there had this was a faith that was delivered it was a faith that was not there but what was the faith that was delivered was the Holy Ghost that's the faith that's what comes in and moves our faith there's some things we need to fight for yeah I think we need to fight for families but fight for them in the right way and don't come under this anointing of this age out here at people's rights come on preach don't come out there with all this but we need to fight for what's right we need to fight with what on our knees when situations want to come in the home we need to go to God In Prayer we need to look to God he's a mighty God to address that need to address that situation not oh well they're just teenagers you need a whooping forgive me but I'll be a pastor you need a whooping for that that's a cop-out God don't need a bunch of cop come on now he don't need men that are being derelict in their Duty either he needs somebody that'll lead the house be an example come on my Lord have mercy the preacher came home this morning it's a time you've got to step up there's things that you've got to fight for it but in this it's an age that has stripped men to be no more than passive sissies you know why because it's the spirit that's upon it and a real man don't treat a woman like a doormat either a real man don't treat a woman like a sex object a real man he values that woman he don't touch her until he has accepted and walked down the aisle that's a real man [Music] foreign Hallelujah that's what I'm talking about a real man I'm talking about Godly standards I'm talking about biblical standards [Applause] my mama verse 4 and there are certain men that have crept in unawares just slipped in unaware they slept right in Undercover yeah we believe just like you believe yeah they crept in the Bible you know why they didn't come in the right way right if you come in the right way you got to come through the door and if you come through the door and you come through the door and that's Jesus Christ and he is the word and that's why we stand as Believers if it can't come through the word then it ain't for me mama maybe it would have been better if we just said amen after we read the text huh you don't help us I said it'll help us who were before ordained to this ordained to this condemnation ungodly men notice there it was already going in this direction already ordained to this God never made him go this way it was their choices God already saw their choices from before the foundation of the world wonder how many times some of these these same men that had crept in unawares set and heard the message the faith being preached yeah I wonder how many of them heard it knew about it but never submitted themselves to it ungodly men turning notice turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ turning the grace my Lord now I want you to think about this foreign when we look at anointing here let me just try to get to a place here this morning Satan as we said moments ago he transforms his ministers that's what the Bible says his ministers Satan's got a Ministry team he's got a Ministry team and they're not lazy they're deceitful workers they work Buddy they are false Apostles in other words they have not been sent by God because a true Apostle is one who is sent by God can I preach just for a moment when the Holy Spirit has come into your life oh I just heard the prophet here this week tell us he said when the Holy Spirit has come into your life you have become a pilgrim and a stranger he said God is sending you forth as an apostle you are running with a message from the throne [Applause] with him glory be to God and but Satan comes and he anoints his servants because I want you to talk I want to look here just a little bit about anointing Satan anoints his servants and what does he anoint them with unbelief Satan and his demons anoints Humanity to disbelieve God's word now he won't come in and say the Bible's a lie but what he wants to do is is misconstrue it or take away the effect of it and well God really didn't mean that God really don't mean that you know we've we've learned better now we've got we've got some things that God really don't he's not going to be angry with you you know he's a sweet Jesus everything just sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet but they're not other attributes in his life there's other attributes he is a god of judgment he is the god of his word he is a father he's not a Papal a poppy a grandpa or whatever more that lets you know man let him get by with certain things and just say well we'll just keep this here at Grandpa's house no at God's house he is our father and judgment begins at the house of God [Applause] there's a standard of the word he calls us to but Satan calls Eve that doesn't he just to kind of misconstrue it a little bit I want you to think about this here just for a moment you know when you think of how brother Brown would go on to say it like this he says I want you to look at how nasty he gets how he whitewashes the word that's I'll tell you that's something when I it just caught me the other day I'm looking at it look how nasty he gets isn't it amazing that some of the things that we can look at and we wouldn't necessarily maybe call that Satan tampering the with the word him getting nasty now come on now some of you after God got a hold of your life there are certain things that you remember that boy seem real well this thing seems really innocent you go back after God's delivered you go back and there's certain things that you thought when you were in the world that were man this was harmless you go back and hopefully you're like that was in there wow that was what's happened what's happened what changed changed what happened in here now it's nasty look how nasty he gets boy it raises it to a whole different level right what's he trying to do get into her mind he's talking to her I want you to watch this he's talking to her after the word has already fortified there wow so Satan doesn't look and say oh he's fortified oh the devil keeps trying now don't you let notice don't you let Satan fortify nothing you keep God's word fortified in your heart so you mean brother Samuel that I'm not a pushover no you're not you're not so don't let the devil paint that picture to you that you're a pushover because you're not it's what you allow it's what you allow don't let Satan fortify anything he wants to bring his Lumber wants to bring his building material wants to bring his accusations pass on by you got the wrong lot you're not building a storage shed here pass it on by come on friends I'm talking about in the mind pass it on by you got the wrong lock yeah no no no no no no no isn't this so-and-so's isn't this such and such a dress now well you've got the right physical address but the guy who ordered that don't live here right on down the street because I'm sure you got the wrong person don't let him fortify nothing you keep God's word fortified in your heart now watch out brother Branham I'm gonna come back up and pick this up what's he trying to do to this woman to Eve he's trying to anoint that precious woman there God's daughter with an unbelief in God's word and brother Brown turns to some to a little sister and turns to others that's how the greatest battle ever fought he says you realize he says honey he was even talking to a little girl that was there had a need he said that's what he's trying to get each of you to do out there is to anoint you Satan is trying to anoint you he'd like to anoint me he'd like to anoint us yes and the only thing you have to do you're a free moral agent right did you catch that you're a free moral agent you have a choice I have a choice now you can accept that if you want to yeah yeah right but kick it out if Eve hadn't stopped that moment to listen don't stop for nothing let me get back to the trying to come to this point here we'll try to type let me just try to find this point and just try to close on this this moment you know in the scripture here was Micah right Mike I got called into a situation and brother Ram's picking up right here in this spot and he keeps on in this particular quote you're a Micah you're a Micah you're a Micah now remember Micah or Micaiah however you want to say it he got brought into a situation where he's outnumbered and I'm telling you he's severely outnumbered matter of fact when they went to go get him he had strict orders we're going to let you join our coffee Club but don't you be talking none of that stuff don't you be doing none of that you can come be a part of this but don't you be talking on that stuff you say only good things about the king wow so in other words to Micah don't you go by inspiration of God we just want you to speak good things when you speak you might want to put some powdered sugar on your lips make sure you gurgle with Sweet Water sweet tea so when you speak it's just sweetness over the whole bunch so Micah got up there and you know the story Michael told him he said I'm only going to say what God puts in my mouth to say [Applause] it's what you wanted you asked me to come but see it was Jehoshaphat yeah hear me now Jehoshaphat was a real believer real believer but he got into a cold moment bye bye come on let's let's deal with the devil right now he got into a cold moment he got into a pact or an agreement that he should never have got into but look at the mercy of God he knows how to get his children out of trouble no doubt Joshua was there remember what he was under there he had word that was given to him hey we're all Israelites This Is Our Land remember all I guarantee you Ahab was quoting scripture you remember one shall put a thousand to fly two shall put ten ten thousand he was quoting the scriptures what was he doing isn't it amazing how family and others can bring scriptures and quotes and not just family others and just want to bring condemnation I thought you was a Christian but Christians don't compromise they still stand with the word [Music] [Applause] woo here he is oh this has been laid on him but how did Jehoshaphat here he is there's something that moves out of his heart that says ain't you got one more ain't you got one what was it Jehoshaphat only needed one where and even a believer that might be down and maybe has made me good packs or other things they shouldn't have done but a Believer only needs one word from almighty God thank you the least of this morning that we could do is say God have you got a word for me Lord [Applause] he's not here to shame us he's here to loosen he knows you are but flesh he's here to loosen You by his word faith and anoints with unbelief misconstring the word but the spirit of God takes those word under the true anointing and he works with a son and daughter of God and he lifts them right back up and they come right back into fellowship with him because you know why it's the goodness of God they'll be sitting right there listening to the word of God and right there in their heart they're repenting the whole time and they keep on climbing under the anointing of God you know why it's a spirit of God if it is they're just not one more [Applause] [Music] Micah came up there when Micah entered he was not the favored as a matter of fact why is she here I hate him you better not say nothing bad about me better not but Micah was really brought there for the call that was going forth in jehoshaphat's life [Music] [Applause] they thought they went and got him yeah God brought him there because one of his children need to come under the right anointing he had come under the anointing of cooperation consolidating into one image we're all alike we're all Israelites he come under that anointing to form the image unto the Beast he was that anointing was on but remember the spirit of God comes before he can never get into that come on now the message of the hour speaks to you and I if that image that's why I called us out of Babylon he still calls us out of packs and everything else [Applause] but here stands Micah all these thoughts that are on around him but Micah stood there with the word of God yeah and you're a mica this morning surrounded by thoughts obstacles all around opposition but the word of God is for you the word of God is greater than what you think about you the word of God is greater it's greater than all of your might your power your struggles it's greater the word of God is greater than all unbelief it's his anointing that comes right into the building just as Satan anoints I can't get to this but just as Satan comes to anoint God also comes to it God comes to anoint and he sends angels his servants as a flame of fire to those who are The Heirs of salvation and they come with the spirit of the word to anoint you to anoint us to do what Lift Us what's the way out of this the anointing will lead you the anointing of the spirit of God it'll Lead You Out it's the spirit of God that breaks every hope no matter what it's been who art thou oh great Mountain I wish I had more time I I need I need some hours here just to finish the laying this in but I know I'm a pastor I can come back and we we we would just get right back at it but it's to me this is between life and death but God lays out for you and I all I can see is is Victory that's all I see is Victory all I see is Deliverance all I see is who art to our great Mountain you that would want to stand and before God's people and accuse you who that would want to hold back who are you all right or opposition or obstacle before zerubbable in the presence of Jesus Christ in the presence of the anointing of Jesus Christ you shall become all it is God releasing God that anointing you know what the anointing does it breaks the spirit that's wanting to bring over your life those thoughts are not just thoughts there's not a dictionary flapping near you and releasing words it's spirits right it's spirits when thoughts come in it's Spirits that's wanting to whisper and that's why you cannot entertain them can't take it in you got to stand with the word nowhere you stand with the word and you stand right there something has come your way disease Affliction whatever it is it's a spirit yes it is but the spirit of the Living God has already overcome that yes and you can look square at that this morning I don't care what it is I don't care it's heightened this age I don't care what it is who art thou old great Mountain all right Thou shalt become a plane before it's a rubable amen we're not to exalt anything I don't care what's going on out there it is not exhausted the house of God the only one that's exalted in the house of God is Jesus Christ and when Jesus Christ is exalted he exalts his people by his word in his spirit and let you and I know you're an overcomer you're more than a conqueror people that's lying to you accept your freedom accept your Liberty Hallelujah let the anointing of the spirit of God let it fall upon your life [Applause] we're not slaves we're not found servants we are free children of the Living God who are tall great mountains Hallelujah I'm looking at Micah's this morning this morning you didn't ask to come in this age but you're here and it's the greatest time the coming of the Lord is upon us but you've been equipped by the Mighty God to stand in this hour [Applause] greater is he that is in you oh sure Satan can come and attack your body he can bring disease he can bring thoughts to your mind he can do but there is a word [Applause] that comes to bring Deliverance freedom freedom what are you going to say now Micah I'll tell you what I'm going to say I'm only going to confess that he's my high priest you mean

come through the message of Elijah and he stood there Lord with the sureness with the strength and the inspiration as he stood with that word in his heart he stood upon that word and as he stood there there was one of your children by the name of Jehoshaphat that needed a word from the Lord and as he stood with that word he might have fumbled with his words at first in a text but then came the anointing the inspiration of God that would move down through that word that was in his heart and would speak to the heart of Jehoshaphat Lord I believe this morning you have spoken to hearts Lord you have spoken Lord to lives that God even Hearts can look around this morning and say what is holding me back what is the opposition who art thou old great Mountain Lord we're not enthused we're

one of the greatest Provisions that we can make is surrender one of the greatest Provisions yes Lord be it unto me Lord yes Lord Jesus Lord let your word Lord just let it saturate down the end let the words of the spirit of God go right down the inside to the Jehoshaphat let me stand like a Michael Lord God let me move under the anointing Lord now walk by my feelings anointing is not a feeling an anointing is the person of Jesus Christ hallelujah it's the anointing that moves upon your life that no matter all of these floods of doubts and everything else can come your way isn't it amazing how Satan can take scriptures and take quotes and if he gets a hold of them it'll bring fear it'll bring condemnation but you let the spirit of God get a hold of that same word through a man of God watch what will happen it don't bring fear and condemnation you know it does it says this is the way out it begins to lift you right up why it's the anointing of the spirit of God and it's the anointing that breaks the yoke it breaks the yoke hallelujah oh I love him don't you hey hey I live what I preach if I didn't I don't got no right preacher but you're living you're living what you're a manner amen hallelujah I'm not picking speaking to people without an experience I'm speaking to people that know this by experience and you watch how the spirit of God will begin to go and deal with hearts and deal with lies what does he do he uncovers Satan's working I'm glad that there is one who's bigger than me bigger than you he's bigger aren't you I'm glad that he can go right down and he can just take the cover right off the devil and you know what happens brother Rocco when that cover gets taken off the devil he does the same thing for me and you of what it's going to do for those leaders of the Nations on the other side when they stand and look and say you're the man you're the guy you're the one that's caused all these trouble you know why he's been brought right down and there's one thing that'll bring him down where he belongs and that is the anointing of the spirit of God by the word you say what do you mean where he belongs let me just say it pretty simple if the devil is out from under your feet he's out of his position it puts him right back right back in his position no matter whatever the whole sin indifference disease the spirit of God uncovers is working the movie can rise in the anointing of the Holy Ghost rise into our position Hallelujah oh thank God I know God's done some wonderful things right here this morning I want you to be in prayer this week as well let's be in prayer because I believe there's yotes to be broken [Music] sometimes you think of just a little thought sometimes it drops on your heart like here was on Friday morning little thing it starts out and I know how he's dealt with me in times past but I don't know are you dealing with me that for here for meeting what what's what is it is it for right now spirit of God just kept on building building praise God hallelujah then of course just so you understand how that the enemy would want to try to work why that's so simple you're right the people won't be able to stay with you on that and that's so simple there but you see there's been a little bit of training that I've been through a little bit I think right now I'm probably in kindergarten I made it through preschool right now all right I've told you before if you ever put a sign back there that says Pastor make sure you put in letters underneath it in training because really I'm his associate he's our pastor [Music] he's our pastor you take him out of a picture how to have there's nothing what could I do but he's the pastor yes but one little thing and he starts building and building aren't you glad yes aren't you glad yes and I opened a little bit like that to you that's the same way he'll try to work on you right setting in a service or you'll never get beyond that you'll never overcome that you'll never you'd really don't understand it this is what should I do stand right there amen him that has awakened you as one who was asleep and say Lord what are you saying to me speak my Lord yeah here's your servant here's your son here's your daughter say on my lord I can't make out what I'm seeing I could maybe look at it but Lord what are you saying all right and the same one that comes by and touches you and awakens you to wear things you know how it is when you're looking at a picture and you're sitting there at an art museum and you look and you're like you come back over this way and sometimes you you know you you're trying to find what perspective right right you're trying to find that right but you know brother Brian once you see it in the picture every time you walk past that picture yes that's all you can see that's all you can see and then you become messengers of what you see in the picture you've been worked to try to get others seeing that same thing that you see why because you see something and you're telling them look away look no wonder when brother Randall said when you once see the message you can't see nothing else foreign you know who you see Jesus Christ that's all I see I I don't see nothing but Jesus Christ I see him the Victorious Christ that's all I see the mighty conqueror and you know what we're seeing him was seeing him then as I keep looking I keep looking looking unto Jesus the author I'm finishing my faith I keep looking you know what i is I see me I say I'm a Son of God I see I'm a daughter of God no it didn't matter how I came into this world didn't matter what family didn't matter all that I am a son and daughter of God I come from God and I'm going back to God what's open to me to see that the anointing of the spirit of God who is it the same Pillar of Fire he's right here the same Angel of the Lord he's right here he's the one not brother Samuel not any other minister it's him that opens our eyes Flesh and Blood hath not revealed these things unto you but my Father which is in heaven and notice if he's revealed he's letting you know I'm your father you are my son you are my daughter because the secret things thank you Holy Spirit secret things belonging to the Lord and those things that he has revealed belong unto us and to our children and to our children's children he's revealed the secret things oh my don't you love me just bathe in this anointing he just let it just saturate amen oh brother Sammy no no listen what brings change the anointing of the spirit of God when a seed is planted in the ground if it just stays there like that it's all hard but if it can receive and allow that water to come down I've watched them in class I put them put them in little little baggies little baggies to put them bean seeds in with little baggies you put brown paper on them not even dirt but Brown you know that hard stuff they call paper towels you won't soak it with water and I put it around the bean seed it I don't I don't know if you all did this or not but I put this under there and you know what happens after a couple days all you got to do from where that wet paper towel has been around that seed eventually you take that paper towel apart right there the paper towel has acted like dirt you know what the dirt does it just keeps the moisture up around the seat and that old hard seat coat that's all around that bean seed you can take it and it just flakes right on and there's a little itty bitty green sprout that has come right out of that sea you know what that is because it's been right in absorbing the moisture it's absorbing the moisture no wonder brother Graham said you take a son and daughter of God they're built to absorb the moisture of the Holy Spirit and what does it do when we absorb it turns to be a son and daughter of God it releases what's on the inside what's the anointing doing it's releasing what's on the inside oh my what a presence what a presence here amen we're we're in the presence all things are impossible to them that believe we're in his presence right now I believe you've got a need right now just submit it before we could maybe slip brother to brother sister to sister and let's just lay hands on one another let's just pray you got to move out and get to where somebody is family whatever it is would you mind doing that I just just in my heart just feel to do this foreign I got confidence in the anointing the quickening power of God that's right here Among Us why wait heavenly father as we lord God have Lord our hands Lord hands Lord that are yielded into your presence oh God lord knowing that God that there are needs Lord Jesus that's right here Among Us Lord God and father I pray that God that Lord you would move Lord for every single
