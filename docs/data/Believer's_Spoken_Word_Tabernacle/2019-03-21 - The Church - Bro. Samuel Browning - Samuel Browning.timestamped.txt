[19:02] reading a quote today

[19:07] said when they pierced him in his side
[19:08] that blood came pouring out and then
[19:12] when the stripes on his back that blood
[19:14] came pouring out and then I began to
[19:17] think about the crown of thorns - that's
[19:18] why I did that that blood came pouring
[19:21] out and brother branham said that as it
[19:23] went down his legs it all became one
[19:25] blood as it hit the earth so when you
[19:28] receive salvation you receive healing

[27:42] oh praise the name of the Lord Jesus
[27:51] where would we be without him we were
[27:58] lost and we needed to be found it's not
[28:03] within us to be able to find our own way
[28:05] but I'm glad that he came he knew where
[28:10] we were I knew exactly where we were at
[28:13] and he found us truly none of us can say
[28:19] I was seeking for God the real truth of
[28:24] it breaks upon our hearts is that any
[28:27] desire that we had or any seeking was
[28:30] because God himself had already made a
[28:34] choice and he was the one dealing with
[28:38] our life already if it's one ounce of it
[28:43] one ounce of it one speck of it one
[28:45] little grain if it's one little grain of
[28:48] it that's us
[28:50] then that would be ninety nine and
[28:52] nine-tenths glory to him and one-tenth
[28:55] glory to us but there's Noth nothing we
[28:58] can glory to think of it of how that he
[29:04] would call us bring us to himself but
[29:07] then would put it in these terms for us
[29:09] that we could understand it of how that
[29:11] he would deal with our heart and give us
[29:14] a spirit so that we can even get along
[29:17] with ourselves then he would come and
[29:20] put his spirit on the inside aren't you
[29:24] glad he's the one in charge he knows
[29:27] just exactly what he's doing he's done
[29:30] it time and time again he's changed life
[29:32] after life after life after life and he
[29:35] will continue until their final name
[29:38] until that final moment
[29:40] [Music]

[32:03] amen god bless you thank you musicians
[32:07] if you'll turn with me to Daniel chapter
[32:11] 9 I just want to start there and then
[32:14] we'll move from there
[32:28] for the brian back there on the slides
[32:30] follow me from verse 25 down to verse 26
[32:34] and then i'll come back to some notes
[32:36] that i put in between verse 25 and 26
[32:39] okay
[32:44] so Daniel chapter 9 let's just start at
[32:49] verse 22 just saved just a little bit of
[32:52] time and he informed me and talked with
[32:54] me and said Oh Daniel I am now come
[32:58] forth to give these skill and
[33:00] understanding at the beginning of the
[33:03] supplications the commandment came forth
[33:06] and I'm come to show thee for thou art
[33:09] greatly beloved therefore understand the
[33:15] matter and consider the vision we could
[33:19] just stay on that scripture for a long
[33:21] time
[33:22] thou art greatly beloved think of this
[33:25] thou art greatly they love this is
[33:28] personally addressed and it lets Daniel
[33:31] know because thou art greatly beloved
[33:34] therefore understand the matter and
[33:37] consume to consider the vision in the
[33:39] tremendous how God will open and pour
[33:41] out of his love that our understanding
[33:44] does not work by demands or commands or
[33:47] law but the understanding of God breaks
[33:50] upon our life by the love of God in that
[33:54] wonderful 70 weeks are determined upon
[34:00] thy people speaking of the Jews and upon
[34:04] thy holy city Jerusalem to finish the
[34:07] transgression and to make an end of sins
[34:10] and to make reconciliation for iniquity
[34:13] and to bring in everlasting
[34:15] righteousness and to seal up the vision
[34:18] and prophecy to anoint the most holy
[34:22] know therefore and understand that from
[34:25] the going forth of the commandment
[34:28] to restore and to build Jerusalem unto
[34:31] the Messiah Prince shall be seven weeks
[34:34] and watch how this lays in here shall be
[34:37] seven weeks , and threescore and two
[34:43] weeks it's taking two portions two
[34:46] measures of time that would be separated
[34:50] and is a conjunction that takes two
[34:53] separated portions of time underneath
[34:56] the seventy weeks and joins them
[34:58] together the street shall be built again
[35:01] and the wall even in trouble sometimes
[35:05] verse 26 and after threescore and two
[35:09] weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not
[35:14] for himself and the people of the prince
[35:18] that shall come shall destroy the city
[35:20] and the sanctuary and the end thereof
[35:23] shall be with a flood unto the end of
[35:26] the war desolations are determined amen
[35:31] may God bless you bless the reading of
[35:33] the word as being seated
[35:38] we've been dealing with this and I know
[35:41] that sometimes the way that the Lord
[35:44] will lead us you might seem like we're
[35:46] off the path but I'm still dealing with
[35:50] the Red Sea right now but in this of the
[35:53] Red Sea there is much of that that
[35:56] speaks of a finishing work even in that
[36:01] there and if God helps us we look and
[36:04] continue to look at those types that lay
[36:06] in here for me I just want to follow him
[36:09] as he's leading us because it's
[36:11] wonderful to follow him it's wonderful
[36:14] the how how he opens the way and makes
[36:17] himself known to us I want to look at
[36:20] this here tonight just a little bit from
[36:22] Daniel 9 and the direction that I want
[36:25] to be able to draw from here is that
[36:28] which really pertains to us before we
[36:30] deal with this if however services that
[36:33] the Lord will lead us before we move
[36:36] move back over then to that of Israel
[36:38] but to look here and notice of how that
[36:41] God has made known to Daniel that 70
[36:44] weeks in verse 20 for seventy weeks are
[36:47] determined upon thy people and upon thy
[36:50] holy city so every the things that are
[36:52] spoken in here which is what would
[36:54] pertain to that of the Jews I wrote down
[36:58] a few notes I don't hope they'll make
[37:00] sense to you maybe as I would read
[37:02] through them but when we look at this
[37:04] here of the 70 weeks is there something
[37:06] between verse 25 and 26 in there if we
[37:09] look if we look within here 70 weeks
[37:12] itself for every every one of those
[37:15] weeks it is that of a seven years a day
[37:18] for that of a year and when we look at
[37:21] this here without spending a lot of time
[37:23] on it to find that how that the Prophet
[37:26] himself in this hour would be pressed
[37:29] you know to even go into that of Daniel
[37:32] 70 weeks and remember brother Branham as
[37:34] we read it last week in the fifth seal
[37:36] brother bream says I didn't even
[37:38] understand why I was going through that
[37:40] at the time he said that God knows that
[37:42] we would need it when we got here so you
[37:46] know to see times of how that God we can
[37:49] see even within
[37:50] this of how that God will open his word
[37:52] and when God will open his word it one
[37:56] thing that is certain about it we do not
[37:58] get and grasp everything nor everything
[38:01] that God would be maybe showing or
[38:03] displaying in that time or everything
[38:05] that God could but God will make sure
[38:07] that what it is that you and I need out
[38:10] of his word at that time when he's
[38:12] opening it that you and I get it because
[38:15] it's all about ministering to our needs
[38:16] it's it's not about accumulating
[38:18] knowledge or understanding it's about
[38:21] that we might be in sync with what God's
[38:24] desire is for this moment in this hour
[38:26] and myself I believe that any time that
[38:29] we are dealing with doctrine or we're
[38:31] dealing with mysteries if it stays out
[38:33] here and it never comes down to daily
[38:36] application we've missed it it's got to
[38:39] come down to where it becomes daily
[38:41] application because this is indeed his
[38:44] life that sealed that now is is open for
[38:47] you and I so when here the 70 weeks it
[38:50] would be that of 490 years that are
[38:53] pertaining to God dealing with the Jews
[38:55] and this is what he's making known to
[38:57] Daniel while that they are here in year
[38:59] 68 before they're coming out of Babylon
[39:02] now when we go on down to the next part
[39:04] that I read there you have that if we
[39:06] made mention in this scripture of verse
[39:08] 25 that there until as the scripture
[39:11] said that until to restore and to build
[39:15] Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince
[39:18] shall be seven weeks and we understand
[39:20] that there was a going back out of
[39:23] Babylon and returning back into the land
[39:25] and then there would be those of Israa
[39:28] and that nehemiah would come come forth
[39:30] and they would be given that of it be
[39:33] seven weeks which would be 49 years to
[39:36] where that here that the not only the
[39:38] temple would be raised up but then the
[39:40] city the walls the gates and all of
[39:42] those things you know to to think of
[39:44] that how that God would lay that out of
[39:46] even the years that how that that would
[39:49] lay in there so those seven weeks that
[39:51] then would be the forty-nine years then
[39:53] you have the next part of verse 25 and
[39:55] threescore in two weeks which is at was
[39:58] actually sixty-two weeks or 431
[40:01] for years and then with what that leaves
[40:04] us with is one week and in that week
[40:06] remember this is where that in the midst
[40:09] of the week that here the Ministry of
[40:11] the Lord Jesus starts here at that of
[40:14] you know the age of thirty and three and
[40:15] a half years then here he is lifted up
[40:18] he's crucified so here three and a half
[40:21] years as the scripture says that the
[40:22] Messiah would be cut off but not for
[40:25] himself so then with three and a half
[40:27] years that God in the midst of the week
[40:29] the Messiah's cut off then what that
[40:31] leaves then is that next part which is
[40:34] three and a half years or days three and
[40:38] a half days of that last week which are
[40:40] years that are left to the Jews which is
[40:43] that of Revelations eleven three where
[40:46] it gives you the 1260 days which divided
[40:50] by 360 days equals three and a half
[40:53] years and that 360 days remember brother
[40:55] Branham deals with the three calendars
[40:57] that of the Julian that of the Roman and
[40:59] then he brings it down to the prophetic
[41:01] calendar and he says it all comes down
[41:03] and it must come back to that of the
[41:05] prophetic calendar so you can see how
[41:07] everything the timing is laid down
[41:09] precisely and everything is laid out
[41:12] exactly perfectly that the where we you
[41:15] and I stand the only thing is brother
[41:18] Brentwood saves in 64 in other places he
[41:20] said the only thing that I can see is
[41:22] that the Gentile church the bride is to
[41:25] be taken in rapture and those two
[41:26] witnesses ready to step on the scene
[41:29] because where God has Paul's been
[41:31] dealing with Israel when they themselves
[41:33] rejected the Messiah the daily sacrifice
[41:36] was taken away we know how the Titus and
[41:38] them came in and stormed the city and we
[41:40] know that the judgment that was poured
[41:42] out but before that judgment could ever
[41:44] be poured out there was already prophecy
[41:46] of Ezekiel 9 where there would be the
[41:48] sealing angel that would go through
[41:50] Jerusalem and it would seal all of the
[41:53] elect of God and there was not one elect
[41:56] of God that was caught inside of
[41:59] Jerusalem you know why they were ready
[42:01] they were ready and they were watching
[42:03] and so at a moment's notice there were
[42:06] things that were made known to them and
[42:08] they were prepared and they were ready
[42:11] when judgment had strike and and so
[42:13] when we look at this here with with this
[42:16] of of Israel we find that within this
[42:19] here that there would be that which you
[42:22] know God as we've been looking at that
[42:24] he would make mention of in different
[42:27] times that in very little places here
[42:32] and there throughout the Old Testament
[42:34] prophets in regards to that of of
[42:36] calling out of the Gentiles and taking a
[42:40] people there for its namesake but yet
[42:42] all of that was hidden this was not
[42:44] known this was all hidden and to think
[42:47] of how where I want to go in this moment
[42:50] here is now going into the midst here of
[42:53] that week of where that the Messiah's be
[42:55] cut off and then in the midst of that
[42:58] week remember now here you find that
[43:00] there is an opening now of seven Gentile
[43:03] Church ages where God Himself will call
[43:06] out and calling out a bride and taking
[43:09] unto him his bride that he chose from
[43:11] the foundation of the world and as soon
[43:13] as that last one comes in because we
[43:16] know that we're living in the finishing
[43:17] up of time this is as the scripture
[43:20] would said the finishing up of the
[43:22] mystery of God and so we're living in
[43:24] the time that just truly at any moment
[43:27] here that we we are going to be caught
[43:29] away the reality comes down to it even
[43:32] from the song of a Gentile days are
[43:34] numbered they they truly are numbered we
[43:37] see everything approaching and you know
[43:39] it is a very sad time because when you
[43:42] think of it it is a bad time out in the
[43:44] world right now it's a hideous time but
[43:47] you know that is only like a crumb
[43:49] compared to what it's going to be like
[43:50] when he get into the tribulation when
[43:53] you look at how things will be in the
[43:55] time of the tribulation and our key will
[43:57] be a small little word it will seem like
[43:59] a kitten term in the time of the
[44:01] tribulation it's a time that brother
[44:03] Branham would say Oh God
[44:05] he said cut me open film before a family
[44:07] full of sulfur he said but don't ever
[44:10] let me be here in the time of the
[44:12] tribulation but it's a time you know at
[44:15] the same time for us as the bride of
[44:17] Jesus Christ when you are recognized you
[44:20] know who you are you recognize what God
[44:22] has done in this day and it means more
[44:25] than life to you and you
[44:27] have been born of the Spirit of God then
[44:28] you know it's a rejoicing in our heart
[44:31] we have tests we have trials all of
[44:33] those things are moulding they're all
[44:35] purposeful but yet we have within our
[44:38] hearts a hope and expectation something
[44:41] that we're looking for and I don't care
[44:43] how many comes along nobody can ever
[44:46] take that Hope away from the bride of
[44:49] Jesus Christ so when we look at it here
[44:53] let's break in just a little bit in the
[44:55] book of Acts and let's look tonight at
[44:57] the Church of the Living God the Church
[45:00] of the Living God in acts 3 verse 12
[45:03] that which comes forth in the midst of
[45:05] the week here now here in verse 12
[45:07] notice Peter here he is this is after
[45:10] the man was healed at the gate called
[45:12] beautiful and when Peter saw it he
[45:14] answered unto the people and he said ye
[45:17] men of Israel notice who he's addressing
[45:19] ye men of Israel why Marvel here this or
[45:24] why look you so earnestly on us as
[45:27] though by our own power or holiness we
[45:31] made this man to walk the God of Abraham
[45:35] and of Isaac and of Jacob the god of Our
[45:39] Fathers hath glorified His Son Jesus
[45:43] whom you delivered up and denied him in
[45:46] the presence of Pilate when he was
[45:47] determined to let him go you know what
[45:49] Peter is announcing here he's announcing
[45:52] that the fulfillment of promises has
[45:56] arrived that it was not us that healed
[45:59] this man you know it marveled those
[46:01] people but Peter was letting him know
[46:03] this is the same God that called out
[46:06] Abraham the same God that met Moses it
[46:10] was that same God that came down and
[46:14] moved in in fulfillment of his word and
[46:16] glorified his son Jesus do you realize
[46:19] brother Adam tells us that on the day of
[46:22] Pentecost when they were filled with the
[46:24] Holy Ghost that Satan never got off his
[46:26] bed that morning he said that it was
[46:28] right here when they begin to see that
[46:31] same power in demonstration be
[46:34] live for the lives of the people he said
[46:37] that got satan's attention and got him
[46:40] upset you see this is why but that same
[46:43] life living inside of you and I it will
[46:46] produce a life of a believer another
[46:49] Christian and brother it is a blight
[46:51] full of the power of Almighty God amen
[46:56] now notice this he says but you denied
[46:59] the Holy One and the just one and
[47:01] desired a murderer to be granted unto
[47:04] you and killed the Prince of life whom
[47:06] God hath raised from the dead where we
[47:10] are witnesses and his name through faith
[47:13] in his name hath made this man strong
[47:16] whom you see and know yea the faith
[47:19] which is by him hath given him this
[47:22] perfect soundness in the presence of you
[47:25] all and now brethren I wot that through
[47:28] ignorance ye did it as did also your
[47:32] rulers you see Peter he's aware of this
[47:35] this was through ignorance you did not
[47:38] realize you were crucifying the Prince
[47:41] of life but they had to be blinded is
[47:46] that right but those things notice which
[47:50] con I love this verse of scripture I'm
[47:52] out how to spell the other day but those
[47:54] things which God be for hath showed by
[47:59] the mouth of his prophets that Christ
[48:01] should suffer he hath so fulfilled to
[48:05] think of that God showed this by the
[48:08] mouth of the prophets these promises
[48:11] that already laid within it you realize
[48:13] that these prophets here and they had
[48:16] within them a chip off that diamond and
[48:19] there was a Victrola needle when there
[48:22] was music that was there that was
[48:25] contained within that word and there was
[48:27] a gift in their life the Bible says holy
[48:30] men of old were moved
[48:32] by the holy ghost hey man that same Holy
[48:36] Ghost it would move on that diamond chip
[48:38] in the light and there were promises
[48:41] that were sealed within here
[48:43] music that's to be broken in this hour
[48:45] there are people that are ordained to
[48:49] live out the symphony and the beats of
[48:52] the word he showed this he showed it by
[48:56] the mouth of his prophets you see every
[48:58] true prophet will refer back to the
[49:01] prophet you with me this is one of the
[49:04] qualifications it will never deviate you
[49:07] understand what I'm saying it never
[49:09] takes quotes and runs them quotes out on
[49:11] such a lie to where it runs and clear
[49:13] out of the scriptures that is an evil
[49:16] spirit that would lead it right away
[49:17] from the scriptures we do not dismiss
[49:20] Ajit's not an addition to the book this
[49:22] message is not outside of the book but
[49:25] this message comes to reveal those
[49:28] things that were sealed within their
[49:31] cover writing these seven thunders they
[49:34] reveal those things that are in there
[49:37] John writing not so then it must be that
[49:43] same God that will come forth in the
[49:46] same way now to think of it it would be
[49:49] that same mercy of God moving upon the
[49:53] ordained seeds of God how much you think
[49:56] of this Peter and them would have missed
[49:58] it they were walking around gloomy
[50:04] listen what Peter's saying right here
[50:07] before before he was filled with the
[50:11] Holy Ghost it was nothing but knowledge
[50:13] but now it's produced no power now it's
[50:18] produced no boldness knowledge did not
[50:20] let him know when stood he did not even
[50:23] know his position come on somebody Peter
[50:29] didn't just come on now this is just a
[50:31] chapter later
[50:31] you ain't going to tell me a chapter
[50:33] later all of a sudden Peter these things
[50:35] begin to be put together you say the
[50:37] Holy Ghost gotta put it together
[50:39] I agree but if you're gonna have a fire
[50:40] you've got to have wood there
[50:42] already and it takes a whole mighty
[50:43] cloth to take the wood the word that's
[50:46] being heard and being gathered that's
[50:48] why it's so important to be in the word
[50:50] and delivering that word it's a
[50:52] fellowship upon it to be in prayer why
[50:54] it's assembling word for the Holy Ghost
[50:57] to come down and bring it together and
[50:59] bring it in order and bring fire upon
[51:02] that that he will live and express
[51:04] itself in its power and grace in our
[51:07] lives there would be the God it would
[51:11] have missed it Peter and that one amidst
[51:13] the upper room and if they miss the
[51:16] upper room they miss the whole purpose
[51:20] of the message they miss the whole
[51:24] purpose of his first coming cuz his
[51:28] first coming was not an event it was an
[51:31] unfolding are you hearing me his first
[51:36] coming was not an event it was not the
[51:38] manger it was an unfolding to where when
[51:43] they themselves hear after the
[51:45] resurrection he himself comes as a
[51:48] faithful Shepherd which is according to
[51:50] the promise I will come and gather you
[51:52] up he gathers them up and takes them in
[51:55] the upper room all glory be to God you
[51:57] know that's what he's going to do to
[51:58] Israel when they get over there that
[52:00] 144,000 he himself to shepherd he's
[52:03] going to gather them together he's going
[52:05] to gather him to take him home then
[52:07] there would be the dog he's gathering
[52:09] them he'll gather him and prepare them
[52:12] oh girl and be to God to think of how
[52:15] that Peter in the moment in this time
[52:18] and the rest of the disciples if it was
[52:20] not for the mercy of God they would have
[52:22] missed what it was all about they would
[52:25] have had a knowledge of Calvary but that
[52:28] day of Calvary would have never been
[52:31] born in their lives
[52:33] amen Peter would have remained one
[52:36] filled with stories about being with him
[52:39] but never having that God who was there
[52:42] behind the sky
[52:44] inside of him though ramita God I tell
[52:48] you friends this message never came to
[52:50] point us to a man it never came to point
[52:53] us to a church this message itself it
[52:56] came to lift up already what God has
[52:59] declared this is my church very man
[53:04] there's one objective and that's to
[53:06] glorify the Lord Jesus Christ I'll tell
[53:11] you anything less so that's an evil
[53:13] spirit amen now notice this here here
[53:18] Peter goes on and that's three verse 19
[53:22] now watch what he says here to the men
[53:24] here's the mercy of God you did this in
[53:28] ignorance now watch God's mercy now
[53:30] repent ye therefore and be converted so
[53:36] here right away and I'm not going to
[53:38] deal on this a lot tonight but this
[53:39] already they've already established
[53:41] there's a difference between repentance
[53:44] and being converted you can have
[53:48] repented but you're still not converted
[53:50] when you're converted you're changed
[53:54] you can no longer be the same you're a
[53:58] new creature in Christ Jesus all things
[54:03] are passed away but before you can ever
[54:07] be converted you must first repent why
[54:12] that your sins may be blotted out when
[54:16] the times of refreshing that part
[54:19] pouring of the Holy Ghost
[54:20] when that times of refreshing shall come
[54:22] from the presence of the Lord and he
[54:25] shall send Oh glory be to God he shall
[54:28] send Jesus Christ which before was
[54:31] preached unto you how many believe that
[54:35] how many believe he's coming back like
[54:38] you said he would yes sir
[54:41] amen we are expecting to receive the
[54:45] Lord Jesus Christ in a corporal body
[54:49] glory be to God we're being made ready
[54:53] for that physical return the same way
[54:56] that the two witnesses will move down by
[54:59] the power of the Holy Ghost and they
[55:01] will make a hundred forty four thousand
[55:03] ray for his coming and he shall send
[55:12] Jesus Christ which before was preached
[55:15] unto you
[55:17] watch how Peter goes here whom to heaven
[55:19] must receive until the times of
[55:23] restitution of all things which God had
[55:27] spoken by the mouth of all his holy
[55:30] prophets since the world began
[55:33] here is preacher Peter here he is he's
[55:36] preaching the second coming of the Lord
[55:38] you know how he's able to do that
[55:41] because he's experienced the coming of
[55:43] the Lord personally in his life that's
[55:47] how he's able to preach the second
[55:49] coming of the Lord this is the full
[55:51] purpose this is what the Church of the
[55:54] Living God loops for longs for is the
[55:58] coming of the Lord and you know what
[55:59] because you long for his coming he comes
[56:02] he comes and he'll come
[56:04] he comes in he'll come and he
[56:06] we'll come in a corporal body to receive
[56:09] us unto himself
[56:11] think about it why does he come you
[56:14] don't come unless you're welcome
[56:16] there must be something that has taken
[56:19] place to change that nature on the
[56:21] inside that must be lambs of God on this
[56:25] earth that welcome back the Lamb of God
[56:28] hey man it welcomes him to come down in
[56:33] services it welcomes him to come and
[56:35] show up when we're on the job it
[56:37] welcomes him to come into our homes why
[56:40] we are part of that personal coming of
[56:43] the Lord where the baptism of the Holy
[56:45] Ghost
[56:46] has moved down in our life and lets us
[56:49] know he's coming for me how you know he
[56:54] already planted the kiss on my heart
[56:57] that's how I know that's how I know and
[57:01] I'm looking for him
[57:05] ho glory be to God
[57:08] here David you know Paul breaks this he
[57:11] really in Peter when Peters preached
[57:13] preaching this here in verse 21 you
[57:15] realize that this breaks clear over into
[57:18] that of the setting up of the Davidic
[57:19] rule in the Millennium it breaks clear
[57:21] over this very scripture breaks clear
[57:22] over in the new heavens and new earth of
[57:26] how that God he's going to bring
[57:27] everything together and God is going to
[57:30] completely restore everything that even
[57:34] Nick day he's going to restore it and I
[57:39] just want to be there don't you and
[57:41] along the way I had just enjoying it for
[57:46] Moses truly said unto the father's a
[57:48] prophet shall the Lord your God raise up
[57:51] unto you of your brethren look how he's
[57:53] moving this back to the prophets this is
[57:54] what the Prophet said lack unto me him
[57:57] shall you hear in all things whatsoever
[57:59] he shall say unto you
[58:01] and it shall come to pass that every
[58:03] soul which will not hear that prophet
[58:04] shall be destroyed from among the people
[58:07] yay and all the prophets from Samuel and
[58:10] those that follow after as many as have
[58:13] spoken have likewise foretold of
[58:16] these days you see what the Holy Ghost
[58:20] does he which was which is and which is
[58:25] to come he's able to take those things
[58:28] that were promises and identified and
[58:31] say that which was now is it was the
[58:35] same God now moving through Peter and
[58:39] them that move there in the life of the
[58:41] Lord Jesus when they gave him the
[58:43] Scrolls that day and he said the Spirit
[58:46] of the Lord is upon me for he hath
[58:49] anointed me he found that place in the
[58:52] word he knew exactly what he was
[58:54] supposed to do he stopped within that
[58:57] and that ministry was made manifest now
[59:00] to think of this how did Peter within
[59:02] this moment and the time led by the
[59:04] unction of the Holy Ghost these were not
[59:07] men remember brother Graham said Peter
[59:09] couldn't recognize his name rode on a
[59:11] boxcar are you with me they spent it one
[59:14] that they were to learn men but it was
[59:17] the Holy Ghost inside of them glory
[59:21] that's our rest is the Holy Ghost
[59:25] it's in heal to know him he that is
[59:29] among us and he that is in us Peter said
[59:34] in verse 25 ye are the children of the
[59:38] prophets remember he's talking to ye men
[59:40] of Israel ye are the children of the
[59:43] prophets and of the Covenant which God
[59:45] made with our fathers saying unto
[59:46] Abraham and in that seed child the
[59:49] Kindred's of the earth be blessed
[59:50] unto you first God having raised up his
[59:55] son Jesus sent him to bless you in
[59:59] turning away every one of you from his
[1:00:03] iniquities remember over and over Paul
[1:00:10] would even talk in Romans 1 I believe
[1:00:13] verse 10 into 11
[1:00:15] that the power of God is unto salvation
[1:00:18] unto the Jew first and Greeks also see
[1:00:25] even where the scripture comes in the
[1:00:28] beginning of Acts it said you shall be
[1:00:30] witnesses of me in Judea in Jerusalem
[1:00:36] you see Paul my mama you see here the
[1:00:40] promise was to be poured out in
[1:00:42] Jerusalem where the gospel itself where
[1:00:46] everything started brother it's coming
[1:00:49] back there I said it's coming back there
[1:00:52] it's gonna come right back to Jerusalem
[1:00:55] I believe with all my heart I believe
[1:00:57] them two witnesses are on earth how do
[1:01:01] you say thus saith the Lord on that but
[1:01:03] I'm just looking at how close we are how
[1:01:06] close we are you see all they're waiting
[1:01:10] is when that Gentile bride has taken up
[1:01:13] then that same Holy Spirit that same
[1:01:17] quickening power of God it moves from
[1:01:20] the bride and it moves there upon those
[1:01:22] two witnesses
[1:01:32] block and really preach on that one
[1:01:34] right now hmm
[1:01:39] you see they're gonna they're gonna need
[1:01:43] more than just knowledge of the
[1:01:46] scripture it ain't gonna be knowledge
[1:01:49] gonna turn them around come on somebody
[1:01:52] it ain't knowledge that turns you around
[1:01:55] it takes the power of God I don't care
[1:01:58] how much you know about healing it still
[1:02:01] takes more than your knowledge to bring
[1:02:02] healing it takes the power of Almighty
[1:02:05] God it takes God to manifest himself as
[1:02:08] Jehovah Rapha the Lord is my here it
[1:02:14] takes God comin on the scene to fulfill
[1:02:16] his word I want you to notice here in
[1:02:23] the scripture let me just let's work
[1:02:26] with this a few moments - not here home
[1:02:27] the church the Bible says in Genesis 41
[1:02:31] 45 that when failure notice now Joseph
[1:02:36] has received or he's attained a new name
[1:02:39] he's overcome you with me Amen there's
[1:02:43] an overcoming and this overcoming now it
[1:02:47] brings forth a revelation and notice I
[1:02:51] want you to I want to draw your
[1:02:52] attention to this that has his name he's
[1:02:54] given the name zaphenath-paneah and
[1:02:57] notice and he Pharaoh he gave him to
[1:03:04] wife essa not the daughter of Potiphar
[1:03:08] priest of on
[1:03:13] who could remove that title from her who
[1:03:19] can remove that title from her that's
[1:03:22] behind her name Joseph can Joseph can
[1:03:28] you see this title appears two more
[1:03:32] places in the scripture and you even
[1:03:35] look at and say well why does it steal
[1:03:36] brother well why is it still brought up
[1:03:38] in the Old Testament Rahab the harlot
[1:03:40] you know see sometimes when you think
[1:03:42] about that car that was stolen in that
[1:03:45] racketeering ring and it drove clear
[1:03:47] down the Bowling Green Kentucky and when
[1:03:49] run brother Adam the Spirit of God moved
[1:03:50] upon him said you'll find that car
[1:03:52] that's strolling down there and remember
[1:03:54] when you get down there of where it
[1:03:56] would have traveled to and so forth
[1:03:57] remember when they got that car he did
[1:04:00] not have a full tank of gas in it it
[1:04:02] only had a half a tank of gas but you
[1:04:04] know what that half a tank of gas was it
[1:04:06] was a reminder of what God had brought
[1:04:09] you from God will allow His grace to be
[1:04:15] made no to where in his mind he does not
[1:04:18] look at Rahab as the harlot but God
[1:04:21] would include that for you and I to
[1:04:23] remind you and I and let us see of the
[1:04:26] depths of the grace of God he can go
[1:04:28] deeper than you can ever imagine what
[1:04:35] changed a synapse why her union to
[1:04:39] Joseph it was not her choosing she was
[1:04:44] given to him so let's look at this a
[1:04:48] little bit he didn't earn he wasn't it
[1:04:55] wasn't something that he went out and
[1:04:56] chose she was gave to him you see even
[1:05:02] the choosing of a bride right now it is
[1:05:05] not Christ himself going forth and
[1:05:07] choosing or selecting on a bride he is
[1:05:11] choosing what he's already chosen
[1:05:15] remember when the anointing oil was
[1:05:18] poured out on David God had already
[1:05:20] chosen the anointing liable only for my
[1:05:25] mama the anointing oil only vindicated
[1:05:30] that David was God's choice been again
[1:05:36] on that one tonight
[1:05:38] but to think of this here but within it
[1:05:41] he's not going through the earth as we
[1:05:44] said selecting or choosing out a bride
[1:05:45] but rather he is drawing to himself
[1:05:49] those who have already been given to him
[1:05:52] to make up his body his bride his wife
[1:05:56] remember not one member or one age is
[1:06:00] the entire body but rather the ages put
[1:06:05] together John 6:37 let me just run
[1:06:08] through these scriptures here I hope you
[1:06:10] understand what I mean I don't mean just
[1:06:12] to run through them but I'll that the
[1:06:15] father giveth me shall come to me and
[1:06:18] him that cometh to me I will in no wise
[1:06:21] cast down and this is the Father's will
[1:06:24] which has sent me that of all which he
[1:06:26] hath given me I should lose nothing but
[1:06:31] should raise it up again at the last day
[1:06:33] verse 44 no man can come to me except
[1:06:37] the Father which hath sent me draw him
[1:06:40] you see it takes the power of God verse
[1:06:45] 65 in the same chapter therefore he's I
[1:06:48] say unto you no man can come unto me
[1:06:51] except it were given unto him of my
[1:06:56] father were given past tense amen so to
[1:07:05] see that this election of God you find
[1:07:09] of Howell that you know even here in the
[1:07:12] time where the Lord Jesus is preparing
[1:07:14] you know to go to Calvary you find in
[1:07:17] the scriptures in John 17 now I will
[1:07:19] read that tonight but you'll find in
[1:07:21] John 17 where the Lord Jesus himself
[1:07:23] would pray an intercession and he would
[1:07:26] just for our fellowship he would ask for
[1:07:29] that which those those which thou has
[1:07:32] given me that they themselves would
[1:07:35] behold my glory that they may be where I
[1:07:39] am ho glory be to God
[1:07:42] I tell you friends when we see this down
[1:07:45] through the scripture we're gonna just
[1:07:47] take the whole let the Holy Ghost take
[1:07:48] us you find that every time we're
[1:07:50] believers are even in that there of our
[1:07:53] Lord Jesus Christ when the word is made
[1:07:55] known within that hour it did not stop
[1:07:57] prayer but a matter of fact a prayer
[1:07:59] life turned out because when God begins
[1:08:01] to reveal it brings the believers in
[1:08:04] prayer because they are desiring for God
[1:08:06] to reveal those things which God hath
[1:08:09] revealed I don't want to just leave him
[1:08:11] in the heavenlies but I want to see it
[1:08:13] translated down to earth and those
[1:08:16] things that God has made known you see
[1:08:18] what good does it do to know all these
[1:08:20] things if it doesn't put something
[1:08:22] within you and I to give us a strength
[1:08:25] to give joy to give peace to give
[1:08:27] direction in our lives brother Sammy you
[1:08:36] don't know how much longer we got that's
[1:08:37] true I don't Harry that's contrary to
[1:08:40] the world he sent my peace I leave with
[1:08:43] you hey man I am come you know that you
[1:08:47] might have life and have it more
[1:08:48] abundantly
[1:08:50] listen tonight putting you down and
[1:08:52] letting you know your rights I'm letting
[1:08:55] you know as the son and daughter of God
[1:08:57] you've got a right to joy in your life
[1:09:00] if you say well I ain't done nothing
[1:09:03] wrong well listen the devil can sit
[1:09:05] there and try to twist all sorts of
[1:09:06] things he can try to get this and well
[1:09:09] this is wrong here he can get your eyes
[1:09:11] off of what you need to be looking at
[1:09:13] brother and sister if we can just look
[1:09:15] to him the scripture says looking unto
[1:09:18] Jesus the author and finisher of our
[1:09:21] faith it's when we get our eyes off of
[1:09:23] him it's when we get in trouble but it's
[1:09:28] when we keep our eyes on him
[1:09:30] he stabilizes us it being doesn't mean
[1:09:33] that we don't got tests and trials we do
[1:09:35] have tests and trials but
[1:09:37] strengthens us he stabilizes us he gives
[1:09:40] us joy and peace in the midst of the
[1:09:43] story and you know you can take the
[1:09:47] attitude that you want you can say well
[1:09:49] you don't know what I'm going through
[1:09:50] maybe I don't know what you're going
[1:09:52] through and please understand I'm not
[1:09:54] making light of whatever it is you're
[1:09:55] going through I respect that but I want
[1:09:59] to let you know right here tonight that
[1:10:01] this is a time where there ought to be
[1:10:03] joy in the hearts of God's people joy is
[1:10:08] not going to break just on wraps or
[1:10:10] morning so what I would do I would evict
[1:10:15] that devil out of my mind right now you
[1:10:20] thief you robber get out of here that's
[1:10:24] what I would tell him because I've got
[1:10:26] rats as a son of God I know what the
[1:10:29] Lord Jesus did for me sorts of things
[1:10:36] around sons and daughters of God you've
[1:10:51] got the authority to enforce said by the
[1:10:54] Holy Ghost
[1:11:01] well God likes to flex his muscles a
[1:11:05] little bit and God likes it when his
[1:11:07] children and moved upon by him and they
[1:11:09] begin to flex their muscles of faith in
[1:11:11] his presence the Lord Jesus here in the
[1:11:20] midst of this time he comes to the
[1:11:23] disciples it's a familiar passage of
[1:11:25] Scripture for us and he says who do men
[1:11:30] say that I am
[1:11:33] it's not of Matthew 16 you most most of
[1:11:37] us would know this there's a lot of
[1:11:39] answers they know there's something
[1:11:42] different about his life there's
[1:11:44] something supernatural something
[1:11:45] spiritual but here as he turns and asks
[1:11:49] Peter and Peter said thou art the Christ
[1:11:53] the Son of the Living God in verse 16
[1:11:55] jesus answered and said unto Him blessed
[1:11:58] art thou simon barjona for flesh and
[1:12:01] blood have not revealed it unto thee but
[1:12:04] my father which is in heaven and I say
[1:12:10] also unto thee thou art Peter and upon
[1:12:14] this rock I will build my church and the
[1:12:19] gates of Hell shall not prevail against
[1:12:24] him now think of these words here this
[1:12:28] is mentioned before the crucifixion
[1:12:37] these words are spoken do they
[1:12:40] understand them they don't they don't
[1:12:44] know what's being said here at this time
[1:12:46] but they're a part of something great
[1:12:50] that is taking place because you see
[1:12:53] even in the words that would be used I
[1:12:55] will build my church you would recognize
[1:13:02] that even build means to grow but then
[1:13:06] how that the Lord Jesus would use this
[1:13:09] term not Church now the word Church
[1:13:12] could not have been a foreign word to
[1:13:15] them because remember Stephen moved upon
[1:13:18] by the Holy Ghost he would refer to that
[1:13:21] same age of the Lord and say he was the
[1:13:23] one who was with them in the church in
[1:13:25] the wilderness so church itself was
[1:13:28] something that they would have an
[1:13:30] understanding of there according to all
[1:13:32] that they had been taught and they knew
[1:13:34] they knew that church itself was that of
[1:13:37] a group or gathering of people that were
[1:13:39] actually called out they were a group
[1:13:42] which that how that when Israel
[1:13:45] themselves were down in Egypt they could
[1:13:47] never be known as the Church of God but
[1:13:50] they were only known as the people of
[1:13:52] God at that time but once they came out
[1:13:54] of Egypt then they became known as the
[1:13:57] Church of God so in the church itself
[1:14:00] now think about it even that coming out
[1:14:02] of Egypt that it was something that God
[1:14:05] had assembled his church and got semble
[1:14:09] dis church by vindicating the promise
[1:14:12] that was made for deliverance and God
[1:14:15] would vindicate that promise through the
[1:14:17] offering of the blood it showed it was
[1:14:19] signs and wonders and how that God would
[1:14:21] deliver them with a mighty hand and once
[1:14:23] they would come out of there then they
[1:14:25] themselves would be known as as the
[1:14:27] Church of the Living God
[1:14:29] now you know I don't want to dwell on
[1:14:30] this a lot tonight but sometimes I think
[1:14:33] that in one thing that there has been
[1:14:35] some misunderstanding and the
[1:14:36] misunderstandings bairns that when the
[1:14:38] Spirit of God would move upon the
[1:14:40] Prophet and he would tell him so that
[1:14:42] you might understand and
[1:14:44] I'm gonna call you Church I'm gonna call
[1:14:47] you brah he was not overriding the
[1:14:50] scriptures that speak of the Church of
[1:14:53] the Living God but rather it is a
[1:14:55] certain word that lets the church know
[1:14:58] the season and the charity of time that
[1:15:02] we are living in and the bride herself
[1:15:04] who is the Church of the Living God
[1:15:08] she is alerted by the word now we'll
[1:15:15] leave that one alone tonight and we'll
[1:15:17] keep going
[1:15:18] so here you find that the Church of the
[1:15:22] Living God look here in acts 2:46
[1:15:27] you know they never believe that the
[1:15:29] church was some place you could join you
[1:15:32] can come to this church and you're still
[1:15:33] not a part of the church right because
[1:15:38] the church is his body
[1:15:42] it is the mystical bath of Jesus Christ
[1:15:46] glory be to God it's not many churches
[1:15:50] there is one church one Lord one faith
[1:15:55] one baptism one Holy Ghost one God one
[1:16:03] church but I've never said he's coming
[1:16:05] back after churches he's coming back
[1:16:08] after the church that he claims as his
[1:16:13] own and this church you can't join it
[1:16:22] and they in the early church they never
[1:16:26] believed that they never believed that
[1:16:29] they never taught such stuff they never
[1:16:31] taught such stuff that you grow up in it
[1:16:34] you're automatically in it hello
[1:16:36] somebody verse 46 and they continually
[1:16:40] daily with one Accord in the temple
[1:16:41] breaking bread from house to house did
[1:16:44] eat their meat with gladness and
[1:16:46] singleness of heart praising God and
[1:16:48] having favor with all the people and the
[1:16:51] Lord added to the church daily such as
[1:16:55] should be saved who added the Lord had
[1:17:00] it
[1:17:01] give me Peter 1 preaching it was the
[1:17:04] vessel was Peter the vessel was
[1:17:07] Bartholomew the vessel might have been
[1:17:09] Andrew because after all that's his
[1:17:13] dress wear his dress where Bill Graham
[1:17:19] said he is dressed up in apostles
[1:17:21] prophets teachers evangelists well that
[1:17:25] don't make you outside of it remember
[1:17:26] that's in the body you're in the body
[1:17:29] that's part of you and you're part of it
[1:17:32] glory be to God God works inside of his
[1:17:37] body his body is his hidden program no
[1:17:42] repeater God hallelujah
[1:17:45] that's why however God started the
[1:17:47] church he must end it the same way any
[1:17:50] so-called church that is not ended in
[1:17:53] the same way is not his church and the
[1:18:02] Lord added to the church daily no how do
[1:18:05] you catch these words such as should be
[1:18:09] saved already ordained of God here God
[1:18:14] is going and rounding up his children
[1:18:16] who's doing this the Lord's doing it but
[1:18:20] we could work with this maybe God had
[1:18:22] somebody down at the sawmill maybe God
[1:18:24] had somebody here what was it it was the
[1:18:26] Lord who was working you say they might
[1:18:28] not have been a preacher hey listen
[1:18:29] preaching sometimes isn't all together
[1:18:31] by that of a gift but your life actually
[1:18:34] preaches a sermon it's a living witness
[1:18:37] of the Living God people don't want to
[1:18:41] know doctrines when you witness job they
[1:18:43] want to know who is that reality behind
[1:18:47] your skin
[1:18:52] sometimes I wonder if we've educated a
[1:18:54] bunch of people instead of them getting
[1:18:56] born-again they can quote quotes they
[1:19:01] can recite things they studied in
[1:19:03] everything else but the Lord must add
[1:19:12] acts 5 verse 12 and by the hands of the
[1:19:16] Apostles where many signs and wonders
[1:19:18] wrought among the people and they were
[1:19:20] all with one Accord in Solomon's porch
[1:19:23] in that funny where the Holy Ghost was
[1:19:25] moving among the people of God they were
[1:19:28] in one Accord you know what this phrase
[1:19:31] one Accord means you'll only find this
[1:19:33] not every phrase one Accord but in every
[1:19:36] one of the times I believe it's three or
[1:19:37] four times it's used there in the book
[1:19:40] of Acts you know what it means it's some
[1:19:41] Greek Greek word begins where the H ends
[1:19:43] with an end it's a it's a five billion
[1:19:45] dollar word but it all means is that
[1:19:47] it's notes that those notes then come
[1:19:50] together and they themselves put
[1:19:53] together bring forth a harmony go over
[1:19:57] to be the God you see God knows how to
[1:19:59] bring the notes together how in the
[1:20:04] world could these people so different
[1:20:07] from one another being one of call it
[1:20:10] because they weren't trying to join with
[1:20:12] one another's personality there had been
[1:20:14] the real personality come down they were
[1:20:17] in tune with God and rather they were
[1:20:19] caught up in his presence they knew who
[1:20:21] they were and that was their focus Wow
[1:20:29] here look at this and of the rest
[1:20:33] Durst's no man joined himself to them
[1:20:36] but the people magnified them nobody
[1:20:38] joined him it was to be added by God
[1:20:43] this is how the church was started this
[1:20:49] is how the church
[1:20:55] coming back to that no man can join it
[1:21:01] is the Lord Himself adding verse 14 and
[1:21:08] believers were the more added to the
[1:21:12] Lord
[1:21:13] multitudes both of men and women who was
[1:21:17] added
[1:21:18] believers you see you don't become a
[1:21:20] believer
[1:21:21] you always were a believer if you always
[1:21:24] were a believer then the power of God
[1:21:26] moves upon your life he causes you to
[1:21:28] believe he that cometh to God must first
[1:21:30] believe that he is right it's the power
[1:21:34] of God that raises up that causes one to
[1:21:37] believe unto salvation that so then to
[1:21:42] see that it is that the believers that
[1:21:45] then are added because remember the Holy
[1:21:47] Ghost brings the seal to show that he
[1:21:51] has received your faith they'll think
[1:21:56] how Paul would pick this up in Ephesians
[1:22:00] 5 what watch how this is unfolding
[1:22:02] I read T on acts 15 last week where
[1:22:06] Peter is watching in the house of
[1:22:07] Cornelius then the question comes up
[1:22:09] more than where they were brethren who
[1:22:11] were questioning Paul in them and
[1:22:13] remember Peter speaks James refers back
[1:22:16] to it there and says of how that God
[1:22:18] made choice and there that he would call
[1:22:21] out of people from the Gentiles for his
[1:22:24] name's sake and notice how that Paul
[1:22:26] here now Paul would have this mystery
[1:22:30] would be unfolded to him and how that
[1:22:33] this mystery would be open you know
[1:22:34] Peter and them never struggled with that
[1:22:38] remember Peter said at the end of Peter
[1:22:40] he said look Paul beloved brother Paul
[1:22:43] he says some things that are hard to
[1:22:45] understand which many who are unlearned
[1:22:49] wrestle to their own destruction see it
[1:22:54] shows one thing if you're learned you
[1:22:56] know when to say you know our Lord I
[1:22:58] don't understand that place you said it
[1:23:00] you'll bring it to pass
[1:23:02] and you give yourself to the Lord
[1:23:06] friends I'm preaching my experience here
[1:23:09] I trust I'm preaching the people by
[1:23:11] experienced nurse thing sometimes we're
[1:23:13] questions without questions we still
[1:23:15] have but you know what God makes it
[1:23:17] known in his time if God carries if God
[1:23:21] carries even another month you'll have
[1:23:24] more understanding you'll be more
[1:23:26] understanding that'll break in your life
[1:23:27] then there is this month if it tarries
[1:23:30] another year there's more why is it's
[1:23:32] the illumination of the Holy Spirit
[1:23:35] coming upon the word we couldn't handle
[1:23:38] it all at one time here this breaks
[1:23:46] Ephesians 5:25 let me try to get this
[1:23:49] husband's love your wives even as Christ
[1:23:52] also loved the church and gave himself
[1:23:57] for it so this mystery that's opening up
[1:24:01] of the church that he might sanctify and
[1:24:06] cleanse it with the washing of water by
[1:24:09] the word so here he is going to Calvary
[1:24:12] with this mystery in him like Adam was
[1:24:16] on the seventh day he was going there
[1:24:21] with this mystery within him this
[1:24:23] mystery that laid there in the midst of
[1:24:27] that last week when the Messiah would be
[1:24:31] cut off the mystery that lay within him
[1:24:33] of taking that Gentile bride
[1:24:38] it lay there and he gave himself here's
[1:24:44] the mystery that he might sanctify and
[1:24:49] cleanse it with the washing of water by
[1:24:53] the word
[1:24:55] we could never made ourselves
[1:24:58] presentable it's by him that we are made
[1:25:04] presentable
[1:25:06] won't it be to God it's not like our
[1:25:11] Western customs in the east
[1:25:15] the bride receives the material for her
[1:25:20] wedding garment from the bridegroom she
[1:25:27] receives that that's why this Bible it's
[1:25:29] not a Western book it's an Eastern book
[1:25:33] she takes the material that's given to
[1:25:37] her and she makes herself ready
[1:25:40] can you bear with me a moment she knows
[1:25:44] he don't want no low-cut wedding dress
[1:25:48] she knows he don't want no low no slits
[1:25:51] of this wedding dress come on somebody
[1:25:53] there's a pattern in this word she knows
[1:25:55] he don't want no high heels to where
[1:25:58] she's mincing he wants her to come in
[1:26:01] humility and he prefer glory he provides
[1:26:08] for her the same fine linen that he is
[1:26:15] attired he provides for her so that when
[1:26:21] she comes the mystery of her life is so
[1:26:25] sealed in his presence that there's not
[1:26:30] one room I expect for the devil to get
[1:26:35] in there she is all glorious within and
[1:26:41] without
[1:26:48] verse 27 look at this that he might
[1:26:55] present it to himself a glorious church
[1:27:04] Jesus don't have a problem with the word
[1:27:07] Church a glorious church because there's
[1:27:13] a lot of churches that he don't clean
[1:27:16] every Church he only claims his own
[1:27:23] y'all know what I'm talking about
[1:27:26] it's somebody come through our
[1:27:27] neighborhood when we first built our
[1:27:29] house back in oh three oh four
[1:27:32] they came through there and this guy
[1:27:34] came in with a hatchback now you two
[1:27:37] have been an idiot to know this guy's
[1:27:40] selling what's that what's a famous guy
[1:27:41] out of them that paints him like
[1:27:43] pictures in bookstores Thomas Kinkade he
[1:27:47] came up to my doorstep first of all what
[1:27:49] are you doing carrying Thomas to Kincaid
[1:27:51] pictures in your little hatchback and
[1:27:54] you come up to my door and telling me
[1:27:56] we've got a special on these things were
[1:28:00] selling them for $30 apiece I didn't
[1:28:04] call him a liar I just said you know
[1:28:05] what and I'm not interested you're not
[1:28:08] interested no I'm not interested at all
[1:28:10] you know why they were cheap
[1:28:14] reproductions they weren't the original
[1:28:18] drawing
[1:28:20] they weren't authenticated Oh glory be
[1:28:24] to God brother let me tell you something
[1:28:26] there's one thing that cannot be
[1:28:28] replicated it is authentic through and
[1:28:31] through and that's the seal of the Holy
[1:28:34] Ghost
[1:28:35] hey it shows through through Inlet
[1:28:40] should be no this is not a treat
[1:28:41] reproduction you can't buy this out with
[1:28:44] cigarettes you can buy this out with all
[1:28:47] sorts of things this is an original
[1:28:49] production that he might present it to
[1:28:56] himself a glorious church over the sand
[1:29:03] of the churches so this and so that and
[1:29:05] so this and so that wonder world are you
[1:29:08] looking at I know what are you looking
[1:29:13] at
[1:29:13] [Music]
[1:29:15] that people would actually be in that
[1:29:18] kind of afraid it's a glorious Church
[1:29:24] [Applause]
[1:29:28] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:29:32] thing but that it should be holy and
[1:29:35] without blemish I mean let me just have
[1:29:41] a few more places here isaiah 52:13
[1:29:44] right before i was a at 53 behold my
[1:29:48] servant is a speaking of the branch the
[1:29:50] lord jesus behold my servant shall deal
[1:29:52] prudently he shall be exalted and
[1:29:55] extolled and be very high and as many
[1:29:58] Worth's toning at thee his visage was so
[1:30:01] marred more than any man and his form
[1:30:04] more than the sons of men so shall he
[1:30:09] sprinkle many nations house he sprinkle
[1:30:14] house he sprinkle because you see on the
[1:30:19] day of atonement in that time of jubilee
[1:30:22] when the blood was offered up there was
[1:30:26] a priest that went riding out through
[1:30:28] the land and he blew a trumpet the
[1:30:31] trumpet the sound that went out
[1:30:33] identified the blood that had been
[1:30:35] offered in let him know you can go free
[1:30:39] and the effect of that blood reached the
[1:30:44] ears of the hair and they could throw
[1:30:46] down their hose and go back to their
[1:30:50] possessions he shall sprinkle many
[1:30:56] nations and the Kings shall shut their
[1:30:59] mouths of him for that which had not
[1:31:03] been told them shall they see and that
[1:31:11] which they had not heard they shall
[1:31:14] consider
[1:31:18] Titus chapter 2 verse 11 for the grace
[1:31:22] of God that bringeth salvation hath
[1:31:25] appeared to all men teaching us denying
[1:31:31] ungodliness and worldly lusts we should
[1:31:33] live soberly righteously godly in this
[1:31:37] present world looking for that blessed
[1:31:39] hope and the glorious appearing of the
[1:31:42] Great God and our Savior Jesus Christ
[1:31:44] who gave himself for us that he might
[1:31:49] redeem us from all iniquity and purify
[1:31:52] unto himself a peculiar people zealous
[1:31:56] of good works
[1:32:10] first Timothy 3:14 these things
[1:32:15] radda unto thee hoping to come unto thee
[1:32:19] shortly but if I tarry long now may us
[1:32:24] know how thou oughtest to behave thyself
[1:32:26] in the house of God which is the Church
[1:32:30] of the Living God the pillar and ground
[1:32:34] of the truth do you realize what's being
[1:32:38] said here this is not about a physical
[1:32:40] building the house of God we call this
[1:32:45] the house of God
[1:32:47] we call that we meet here with the
[1:32:50] Living God but the order the house of
[1:32:53] God is where God lives you with me where
[1:32:59] God lives God lives in a house tell him
[1:33:04] somebody I'm gonna be to God when he
[1:33:07] came here on this earth hey here he
[1:33:09] found a body but think about it as far
[1:33:12] as any earthly house the Bible says that
[1:33:14] the son of man didn't even have a place
[1:33:15] to lay his head
[1:33:18] but brother he purchased unto himself
[1:33:24] the house of God then of the people of
[1:33:28] God that he himself he would dwell
[1:33:32] inside of us brother sister it's us
[1:33:34] dwelling in him and he is in us you
[1:33:40] shall know that I am in the father the
[1:33:43] father of me I am you and you in me
[1:33:47] God's chosen place of worship it is the
[1:33:52] house of God which is the church once
[1:33:55] again the Church of the Living God the
[1:33:59] pillar and ground of truth and without
[1:34:05] controversy great is the mystery of
[1:34:10] godliness
[1:34:16] God was manifest in the flesh justified
[1:34:18] in the spirit seen of angels preached
[1:34:22] unto the Gentiles believed on in the
[1:34:24] world received up into glory great is
[1:34:27] the mystery of godliness that mystery of
[1:34:33] God which is Christ in you the hope of
[1:34:37] glory great is the mystery of godliness
[1:34:42] can I have just a couple of minutes
[1:34:45] let's finish with the scripture in
[1:34:47] Ephesians 2 remember sons of God are
[1:34:53] born into the house of God servants
[1:34:57] don't abide there forever but sons that
[1:35:01] are born they abide in the house of God
[1:35:04] the Church of the Living God notice
[1:35:07] verse 11 wherefore remember that ye
[1:35:10] being in time past Gentiles in the flesh
[1:35:13] who are called uncircumcision that which
[1:35:18] is called circumcision in the flesh made
[1:35:20] by hands that at the time you were
[1:35:23] without Christ being aliens from the
[1:35:25] Commonwealth of Israel and strangers
[1:35:27] from the covenants of promise having no
[1:35:31] hope and without God in the world but
[1:35:35] now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes
[1:35:39] were far off are made nigh by the blood
[1:35:46] of Christ these types that laid in here
[1:35:52] what happened how are we brought in to
[1:35:56] the covenants there was a salmone that
[1:36:00] took us in salmone took Rahab after a
[1:36:05] battle was won
[1:36:07] Boh ass brought Ruth in after he
[1:36:14] suffered at the gate are you with me he
[1:36:18] paid the necessary transaction that was
[1:36:21] required because a gate in that day it
[1:36:24] was a place where two gathered to settle
[1:36:26] transactions he settled the transactions
[1:36:30] that was against your Ruth he brought it
[1:36:34] out the handwriting of Ordinances what
[1:36:38] would be to God that's why being in him
[1:36:40] and him in you the gates of hell can
[1:36:43] never prevail against you
[1:36:46] transactions that the devil would try to
[1:36:48] exact upon your life you are like a
[1:36:51] mighty arrow in the hand of a mighty man
[1:36:54] you turn the battle to the gate amen and
[1:36:58] say the transaction has already been
[1:37:00] made shake to take your hands amen go
[1:37:08] repeat a dog turning the battle to the
[1:37:10] gate bring it back where the
[1:37:13] transactions were settled are you with
[1:37:16] me tonight Harry was just sending up
[1:37:18] into glory there were some gates that
[1:37:21] needed to be opened these gates could
[1:37:24] only be opened when there had already
[1:37:26] been a victory and a conquering was led
[1:37:29] forth but you know there was a question
[1:37:31] and it went forth he said open up he
[1:37:34] everlasting gates
[1:37:35] it was those Old Testament Saints that
[1:37:38] were the elect of God that had been laid
[1:37:41] to rest in paradise they had been raised
[1:37:44] up at the resurrection of the Lord Jesus
[1:37:46] they entered in with him at the rapture
[1:37:48] and here they are moving up there to the
[1:37:51] gates and on the inside of the gates
[1:37:53] they said there must be a password and
[1:37:56] that password says who is this King of
[1:37:59] glory
[1:38:00] it says the Lord of Hosts below my day
[1:38:04] in battle necessary transaction had been
[1:38:10] fulfilled and the gates opened
[1:38:23] he's our peace he's our peace he broke
[1:38:35] down on the Bible says the middle wall
[1:38:36] partition that was between us
[1:38:41] he removed the chasm what you glad
[1:38:45] aren't you glad you could look across
[1:38:49] the chasm but he himself he himself
[1:38:53] became the breach he himself removed the
[1:39:00] castle and when that holy ghost has
[1:39:05] moved down upon our life it is the
[1:39:08] breach to that seed of God that ties
[1:39:12] that seed of God by the quickening power
[1:39:15] clears us ties us clear back to the mind
[1:39:18] of God you never did it in the first
[1:39:21] place
[1:39:30] Oh glory be to God
[1:39:34] notice how Paul would go on there you
[1:39:37] would say we are fellow citizens with
[1:39:42] the Saints and of the household of God
[1:39:49] right here as a church we're not the
[1:39:52] household of God but we are a part of
[1:39:56] the household of God there's one the
[1:40:02] household of God one the church were one
[1:40:09] of many outpost storehouses where our
[1:40:16] dried the room the Lord Jesus our Joseph
[1:40:19] he reveals himself he gives out grain
[1:40:28] I don't know about any of you I don't
[1:40:31] mind vegetable trees there all right
[1:40:33] sometimes
[1:40:34] I'm not really big on just be honest
[1:40:37] with you say where are you going with
[1:40:39] this well I appreciate stored up
[1:40:41] vegetables but we need having vegetable
[1:40:45] trays our Lord Jesus is preparing meals
[1:40:51] from what he's stored up are you with me
[1:40:56] not ministers he's preparing it but he
[1:41:00] has ministers to serve what he's
[1:41:03] prepared now we don't want that spirit
[1:41:07] to get on us well some of them had that
[1:41:10] idea I remember they had a dream and
[1:41:13] they seemed brother Neville serving food
[1:41:16] in the tabernacle oh brother Neville
[1:41:19] shouldn't be doing that see that same
[1:41:22] spirits around that same spirit is
[1:41:25] around it's not the Spirit of God it's
[1:41:27] an evil spirit but notice how the
[1:41:31] prophet of God under the leadership of
[1:41:32] the Holy Spirit he pointed out he's
[1:41:35] serving that same food that's being
[1:41:39] served
[1:41:42] it says same food we're not eating raw
[1:41:46] carrots we're not eating raw celery but
[1:41:53] our Lord Jesus who has prepared for us
[1:41:55] what we have need of he is supplying our
[1:41:59] every
[1:42:06] I'm glad about that and I'm not saying
[1:42:09] that because I don't like vegetable
[1:42:10] trace in the natural I'm just saying
[1:42:13] that he prepares a table he's got a
[1:42:18] table prepared the Church of the Living
[1:42:28] God mystery that he himself had hidden
[1:42:36] you know the reality of it is is that
[1:42:38] you know it's still a mystery to much of
[1:42:44] that to the world it's a mystery to that
[1:42:47] of church
[1:42:48] it's a mystery let me say to you don't
[1:42:52] let it stay a mystery to you if it's a
[1:42:56] mystery to you tonight
[1:42:57] don't let us stay a mystery just let
[1:43:03] your heart as its touched by God the
[1:43:05] scriptures that we read repent if you've
[1:43:10] never been baptized in the name of the
[1:43:11] Lord Jesus Christ don't be baptized and
[1:43:13] don't repent you repent first get your
[1:43:17] heart and I first let your heart be
[1:43:18] turned to God then walk into the waters
[1:43:22] of baptism believing that that promise
[1:43:26] that God has made he said that you shall
[1:43:31] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost I
[1:43:34] want you to think of this no matter the
[1:43:39] if we could say the goodest person could
[1:43:42] never earn it
[1:43:43] you can't earn a gift it's given it's
[1:43:49] given it's not something you merit it's
[1:43:53] the gift of God even to where God would
[1:43:57] prepare our hearts to receive him the
[1:44:02] real reality is it's not us receiving
[1:44:05] him it's him accepting us sometimes
[1:44:08] we've gone so customed to saying that
[1:44:11] brother Branham would tell us back into
[1:44:12] early 1959 he would bring it all the way
[1:44:15] up into future home and say you know
[1:44:16] what he said
[1:44:18] don't say I've received the Holy Ghost
[1:44:19] he said you say he accepted me what a
[1:44:26] difference it makes what a difference it
[1:44:29] makes this little bit of time that we're
[1:44:33] living and we're living in the closing
[1:44:34] moments of time he's finishing up his
[1:44:38] church and one of these days he's going
[1:44:43] to present to himself a glorious church
[1:44:46] without spot wrinkle blemish or any such
[1:44:50] thing
[1:44:52] he's gonna finish that up and then here
[1:44:56] you have the resume button for Israel
[1:44:58] the day breaks for jerusem and here we
[1:45:05] are at the wedding
[1:45:10] looking across the table I gotta look
[1:45:12] out here right now and I see many that I
[1:45:16] looked at when I was a little boy and
[1:45:20] see right now is battle-scarred soldiers
[1:45:23] but then that no matter what things took
[1:45:26] place sister Anna for the crash sister
[1:45:28] Elia different ones brother herb for the
[1:45:31] bill god bless you
[1:45:34] different lungs and then sister cress on
[1:45:38] and on
[1:45:40] mr. gomez oh my please don't get
[1:45:43] offended if I didn't call your name at
[1:45:45] each and every one you've been born at
[1:45:47] the Spirit of God friends I'll tell you
[1:45:49] right now even if it's just been a week
[1:45:51] you're still battle-scarred but you can
[1:45:54] look across and around just right here
[1:45:57] and see people where the Spirit of God
[1:45:59] has anchored when many times they let go
[1:46:04] but Hall how wonderful it is that the
[1:46:08] hold wasn't based on their hold it was
[1:46:11] his hold on their life something kept
[1:46:16] hold him day after day moment after
[1:46:19] moment something kept pressing them what
[1:46:22] is that
[1:46:22] it's the hope the hope of him coming
[1:46:29] home that day
[1:46:32] I hope I'd get to sit next to every one
[1:46:35] of you I don't know how that'll be
[1:46:37] possible but I hope that I'm able to sit
[1:46:40] there with you cellphone Samuel you
[1:46:42] fellowship with us but on that day
[1:46:46] [Applause]
[1:46:47] [Music]
[1:46:50] brethren let me tell you something when
[1:46:53] we look across the table and we see and
[1:46:57] that day see one another and say we made
[1:47:02] it it's grace it was sufficient we made
[1:47:11] it it was worth it all every test every
[1:47:17] smile it's been worth we look across and
[1:47:24] see one another
[1:47:25] oh my those that we have prayed together
[1:47:29] with we've joined shoulder to shoulder
[1:47:32] and fought battles and took mountains we
[1:47:37] took possession together we'll stand
[1:47:41] there on that day and say yes grace
[1:47:44] brother Brian it's amazing
[1:47:47] he gave us strength
[1:47:53] then he'll slip up come around
[1:48:00] and I don't understand it friends the
[1:48:04] Bible says heaven that he'll wipe away
[1:48:05] the tears from our eyes because the
[1:48:10] wedding supper is not a place of sorrow
[1:48:15] somehow he'll be able to remove from our
[1:48:19] remembrance all of the failures I know
[1:48:24] we'll be standing in our theophany I
[1:48:26] understand that but to think of how that
[1:48:29] he will wipe away all of those memories
[1:48:32] but yet the paradox is we'll have the
[1:48:36] memories of fighting battles and
[1:48:39] overcoming those same how's he going to
[1:48:43] do it I don't know it kind of sounds
[1:48:45] like it's the same one who comes down
[1:48:46] and separates the bone from the morrow
[1:48:48] right now he knows how to divide it with
[1:48:52] such precision I don't I don't need to
[1:48:59] know I just believe it when we get
[1:49:03] through that day we'll say it'll be
[1:49:06] worth it all can you sing it's on what a
[1:49:10] day it will be when my Jesus I shall see
