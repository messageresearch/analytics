[40:20] Genesis 31 tonight just have a few
[40:23] verses of Scripture and then we'll let
[40:26] you be seated amen
[40:30] so appreciated the Lord and services
[40:33] that he gave us here this weekend and
[40:35] yeah and I know you had some wonderful
[40:37] services while I was gone and that's
[40:40] wonderful amen because you know though a
[40:44] vessel might go but the Lord doesn't go
[40:46] and so I appreciate brother John just
[40:49] being right here and then I really
[40:52] appreciate our brother amen and we just
[40:57] want to just look to the Lord it's
[41:00] Genesis 30:1 we'll just read a couple
[41:02] verses scripture and let you be seated
[41:04] and he heard the words of Laban sons
[41:08] saying Jacob have taken away all that
[41:12] was our Father and of that which was our
[41:15] fathers hath begotten all his Aldus
[41:17] glory and Jacob beheld the countenance
[41:20] of Laban and behold it was not toward
[41:23] him as before and the Lord said unto
[41:26] Jacob return unto the land of thy
[41:29] fathers and to that kindred and I will
[41:32] be may the Lord bless you and bless the
[41:37] reading of the word as you're being
[41:38] seated I'd like to just speak to you
[41:42] tonight on a thought on a change of
[41:44] countenance and before doing that I want
[41:48] I had mentioned to when we were taking
[41:51] up the mission offering on on Sunday and
[41:57] I think the prayer requests had come in
[41:59] tonight about those things that are
[42:01] taking place there was Ben Rusch
[42:04] and the things that I reported to you
[42:07] was some things that I had received
[42:10] where my understanding was at that time
[42:13] from was a pastor who was over there who
[42:15] had come back from a convention not in
[42:17] Russia but there in Holland and had made
[42:21] me aware with other ministers that there
[42:23] had been a a stoppage as far as what all
[42:26] that he knew of of a container but what
[42:30] it ended up being as some of you maybe
[42:32] read it on the website of the voice of
[42:35] God recordings is that is actually in
[42:38] reference to a few tablets and there
[42:40] have been men that have rose up to you
[42:45] know go in and put different things
[42:47] quotes within the message and having
[42:49] brother Graham say this and say that so
[42:52] the request came and I didn't get this
[42:53] request until this morning from one of
[42:57] one of the brothers and that is that
[42:59] they're asking that if we would write
[43:03] letters and I've already I've already
[43:05] been on back today writing a letter just
[43:07] to express what really the my heart and
[43:11] it is the effectual working of the
[43:14] message in my own life and in the
[43:16] message of this local assembly and so
[43:18] that letter then will be Lord willing
[43:22] will be sent I'll finish it up this
[43:24] evening after service and then be sent
[43:28] to where that they'll translate it into
[43:30] Russian there's other there's some other
[43:32] pastors that's doing it as well and I
[43:34] just really felt on my heart I didn't
[43:36] see it it came out yesterday one of the
[43:37] brothers posted it on a little group I'm
[43:40] there with and and I didn't see it until
[43:42] this morning and something just rose in
[43:44] my heart and I so I just began to write
[43:47] and just begin to refer many places in
[43:49] the scripture to the things because what
[43:51] we see happening is something that has
[43:53] has always taken place there was there
[43:56] was how that the religious gathered
[43:58] against the Lord Jesus and a council and
[44:00] anytime that God has moved there's
[44:02] always been that where in the enemy
[44:04] always gets brought up and gets
[44:06] disturbed and his kingdoms just being
[44:08] disturbed even when in the book of Acts
[44:10] you look how many times they brought
[44:12] accusations against Paul and they would
[44:14] come against that and say the house of
[44:16] Jason is is you know causing a
[44:17] disturbance and it wasn't that at all it
[44:19] was these men that were hired in there
[44:23] that were causing a disturbance so they
[44:25] will the Lord willing translate this
[44:28] into this letter along with some others
[44:32] into the Russian language and then it
[44:34] will go there before the magistrates so
[44:36] that they can see that this is that the
[44:39] message within itself is not something
[44:42] as far as where it's ever been declared
[44:45] as far as within this assembly extremism
[44:47] you understand that's what they're doing
[44:50] and and I know we can look at and say
[44:51] well brother Samuel you know it's just
[44:53] it's just how God is moving well or how
[44:56] things are allowed to move well the
[44:57] thing of it is is that we also know that
[44:59] that is in God's hands we cannot change
[45:02] that we're not trying to orchestrate
[45:04] anything but we want to if as long as
[45:08] what God would Terry and what he would
[45:12] have to go forth there within that work
[45:14] there in Russia we want the Spirit of
[45:16] God to be able to move and God will move
[45:18] on our hearts in that way so you know if
[45:21] they rule and say that it is you know
[45:23] extremism and things like that then then
[45:25] so be it you know but if they don't then
[45:28] you know so be it as well because the
[45:31] one thing about it God is gonna have God
[45:33] is gonna have his way so I I asked you
[45:35] just to continue to keep me in prayer
[45:37] because I'm just gonna work on it here
[45:39] after we get out of the service continue
[45:41] and I've already got multiple pages and
[45:43] you know I I just asked you just to help
[45:46] them just pray for me that God will just
[45:48] help me you know I don't know but all in
[45:50] order to do is I just want to do my
[45:52] little part because to me that's what
[45:54] we're standing for is there is is the
[45:56] message that God has sent for us but I
[45:59] want to just I just want to deal with
[46:00] this thought here on a change of
[46:02] countenance and Lord begin to stir my
[46:05] heart on this before I had before I'd
[46:07] went on the trip and I began to look
[46:09] here in the scriptures of how that when
[46:12] we're looking at a a change of
[46:14] countenance it's something that at this
[46:16] point in time in the scriptures that we
[46:18] look at it it's nothing that Laban has
[46:20] expressed to Jacob that he is upset with
[46:23] Jacob or that he has a dislike for Jacob
[46:25] or anything like that but Jacob is
[46:28] noticing the countenance the person the
[46:31] presence of how those things have
[46:33] changed toward him so there's a measure
[46:36] of discernment to be able to see those
[46:38] things and be able to recognize that
[46:40] Laban is not acting towards Jacob as he
[46:44] did before then we find that here within
[46:47] the scripture that how that when Jacob
[46:50] recognizes this change of countenance
[46:53] that the Lord speaks directly to him and
[46:55] and and ministers to Jacob or says to
[46:58] him return unto the land of thy father's
[47:02] so Jacobs not in that land but Jacob is
[47:05] is instructed by God to return to this
[47:08] land and I want you just to think of
[47:10] this just to drop this just for a little
[47:12] bit tonight because I want to really lay
[47:14] some background here that there is a
[47:17] necessary change of countenance if there
[47:21] had not come this change of countenance
[47:23] it is very foreseeable as we can look in
[47:26] the scriptures tonight that undoubtedly
[47:28] Jacob would have continued and continued
[47:31] and continued
[47:32] but God allows a change of countenance
[47:35] to come about and that change of
[47:38] accountants everything is always working
[47:40] for God's great counsel and you know as
[47:43] as the people of God you know when you
[47:46] think of how that the Prophet mentions
[47:49] there of how that many would stand up
[47:51] and take the promise of the hour of the
[47:54] coming of the Lord and brother brems
[47:55] says they begin to make many predictions
[47:58] and begin to say many different things
[47:59] he says but one of the things he said
[48:02] that they fail to recognize is that
[48:03] there is also other conditions that must
[48:07] be present within that time so it's not
[48:10] just us looking because really the whole
[48:12] Church of the Living God if we had the
[48:15] accessibility to go back into let's say
[48:19] if they would have recorded Paul's and
[48:21] messages and others you would have heard
[48:23] Paul preaching the second coming of the
[48:26] Lord
[48:26] you would have heard that urgency that
[48:29] was not something where the church was
[48:31] just living in a manner and that well
[48:33] he's not going to come in our day but
[48:35] let's just do a little bit but know
[48:37] every time that the Holy Spirit as visit
[48:40] did the Church of the Living God even as
[48:43] God was moving to be there to send that
[48:47] messenger forth there was always a
[48:50] people who were designated to receive
[48:53] that word when it came and God would
[48:56] stir up and deal with the hearts of the
[48:59] people so that when that message came
[49:02] here there were people that were
[49:04] ordained to receive it brother Graham
[49:07] gives us that principle we see it in the
[49:09] invisible union he speaks of how that
[49:12] when God is getting ready to send a
[49:14] message there's a people on earth who
[49:16] are desiring to line up with that word
[49:20] it isn't something necessarily that a
[49:22] people can say you know in their
[49:25] churches we're out of line with the word
[49:27] and I want to line up with the word but
[49:28] it is an inward longing that God is
[49:32] responding to and that inner longing is
[49:36] what God has already sown there got
[49:38] placed there in that bed of time and and
[49:42] the Holy Spirit moving in that hour is
[49:44] bringing the condition that's needed for
[49:47] that word to come that it would be
[49:49] received that's the same way he did with
[49:51] Mary that's the same way with all the
[49:53] way down through listen that's the same
[49:55] way that God deals with our life day
[49:58] after day service after service what
[50:01] good would it do for the Holy Spirit to
[50:04] deal with the man of God and deal with
[50:06] this heart and give that inspiration
[50:09] that's needed to speak if he went in
[50:11] dealing with your heart dealing with
[50:13] morrow
[50:13] what good would it be we would have
[50:15] nothing but just protracted meetings and
[50:17] services but that's not the leading of
[50:20] the Lord it's God that's preparing our
[50:23] hearts that's why there's times that you
[50:25] can sit right here well the word is
[50:27] coming forth and all of a sudden you're
[50:29] thinking the Holy Spirit is bringing you
[50:31] back and tying things together that
[50:34] you've heard in the message and it may
[50:35] not be something verbatim that said
[50:37] right here but the Holy Spirit is
[50:39] bringing things together that he has
[50:42] spoken to you throughout the week maybe
[50:44] throughout the month throughout the
[50:45] years what is that that is the Holy
[50:47] Spirit confirming his word doing just
[50:51] what he said he would do
[50:52] he said the spirit of truth will lead
[50:54] and guide us into all truth
[50:56] and will bring to our remembrance those
[50:59] things which he hath said this is God's
[51:02] working they meant and he is the great
[51:05] one that is here among us and God has a
[51:08] timing for everything and and that's
[51:10] where that when we look at it that we we
[51:13] look at the promises of God and we have
[51:15] a desire to see those promises fulfilled
[51:17] but there's always a timing we think of
[51:20] how that Moses when Moses you know he he
[51:23] saw and he read and he heard that there
[51:26] was to come and deliver and he had even
[51:28] heard that part about his own life but
[51:30] yet it wasn't God's timing when Moses
[51:34] stepped on the scene the people were not
[51:36] in condition to receive it so you find
[51:39] that how there must be a receptive and a
[51:41] receiving of this in order for God to
[51:44] move on the scene and there's no party
[51:46] no land that can bring us into that
[51:48] place except God himself God will move
[51:52] right through his distinct gifts and
[51:54] offices and all things to bring
[51:56] everything about as a matter of fact
[51:58] when the scripture says in the book of
[52:01] Ephesians it stands out more and more to
[52:03] my heart how the scripture says he
[52:05] worketh all things after the counsel of
[52:08] his own will think of this of how that
[52:13] God's element of time look at how that
[52:17] when we look back in the scripture in
[52:19] Genesis 29 and let's look back here just
[52:22] a moment of how that Jacob when he
[52:24] arrived in Iran they find that how that
[52:27] Jacob here he is once again he is he's
[52:29] guided the same holy spirit that guided
[52:32] Abraham out of the land and you know as
[52:35] I've said it many times Abraham didn't
[52:37] have a GPS he didn't have an iphone to
[52:41] guide him but he said get me out into a
[52:44] land I will show thee where's it I'll
[52:47] show you where it's at the only thing he
[52:50] had to do was follow in obedience what
[52:53] the voice said do and here this is all
[52:56] that Jacob had to do you remember Jacob
[52:59] coming you say well he knows to go back
[53:01] to the land of Haram that's true but to
[53:03] know that he must return
[53:05] that household of the kindred of Rebecca
[53:08] that there would have to be God Liam the
[53:11] same God that would lead Eliezer is the
[53:14] same God that's leading Jacob into this
[53:17] place Laurie
[53:20] the Bible says of Hal in verse 12 that
[53:23] Jacob told Rachel that he was her
[53:26] father's brother and that he was a
[53:28] Rebekah son and she ran and told her
[53:30] father and it came to pass when Laban
[53:32] heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's
[53:35] son that he ran to meet him and embraced
[53:38] him and kissed him and brought him to
[53:40] his house and he told Laban all these
[53:43] things and Laban said unto him surely
[53:46] thou art my bone and my flesh and he
[53:49] abode with him the space of a month so
[53:53] here is the countenance when Jacob first
[53:56] arrives it's a countenance of great
[53:58] welcoming you know it's there there was
[54:05] nothing that was against Jacob at that
[54:07] time and so know that remember when
[54:10] we're looking at it that the change of
[54:12] countenance there's sometimes there's
[54:14] things that you know brother Anne tells
[54:16] us of how that the Wills of prophecy
[54:18] said the Wills of prophecy turns slow
[54:21] but sure and some of you that are aware
[54:27] you know of how long that you know when
[54:31] there are many things where many people
[54:33] that have stood around the message and
[54:36] when things haven't happened in a
[54:38] certain time many haven't there have
[54:40] been those that said why this just can't
[54:43] be and how many that you know they
[54:44] walked away in 77 and all those things
[54:47] like that but yet that did not take away
[54:50] from the program of God the vision
[54:54] itself has has been made known in the
[54:56] vision itself it will it speaks for
[54:58] itself in God's declared time it's not
[55:02] how men want to force it it's just like
[55:04] that way within God's Word understanding
[55:07] is given not by our strength
[55:10] understanding cometh when it's time for
[55:12] us to understand those things God moves
[55:15] on our hearts for us to yearn and pray
[55:18] and
[55:18] desire for that what good would it do
[55:20] for me to call you to a table and that
[55:23] is prepared no matter what kind of
[55:25] delicacies these are on it if you're not
[55:27] hungry you're not gonna you're not going
[55:30] to eat but if there is that which is
[55:31] prepared and you are hungry you will
[55:34] respond to the cold and God knows there
[55:39] has got to there there's a desire that
[55:41] reigns within the heart of a believer
[55:43] and so when we look at this this change
[55:46] of countenance is so it's God's doing
[55:49] it's God
[55:50] turning Jacobs heart fully to go back
[55:54] home look at how that God says this in
[55:58] Genesis 28 15 we referred to this place
[56:02] last time we were ministering here was
[56:05] God when he met when he met Jacob there
[56:07] and beth-el and J and here God lets him
[56:11] know behold I am with thee and will keep
[56:14] thee in all places whither thou goest
[56:16] and we'll bring the again into this land
[56:20] for I will not leave the until I have
[56:23] done that which I've spoken to the earth
[56:26] so God remember when God met him here
[56:29] remember as we looked at this this was
[56:32] not some of a place that stood out to
[56:34] Jacob but it was the place that God
[56:37] desired to make himself known to Jacob
[56:41] and it would be a place that God would
[56:44] refer himself to being as the god of
[56:47] Bethel returned back to this place so
[56:52] the hell that God would would speak to
[56:54] Jacob I'm gonna bring you again into
[56:56] this land that's the same thing that God
[56:58] let him know in the Book of Jeremiah
[57:00] he's let him know in the Book of Ezekiel
[57:03] I am gonna bring you back into this
[57:06] place I will cause these cities to be
[57:09] inhabited once again it is God's working
[57:12] and God's doing and God moving in a
[57:15] season of time what is this it just
[57:19] comes back to where the Prophet could
[57:21] say in the message masterpiece he said
[57:23] anybody that reads Jacobs life the only
[57:26] thing he said you can see is God's grace
[57:29] and you know was wonderful
[57:31] grace is nothing that we merit grace is
[57:35] what is provided because grace itself is
[57:39] that which God is God's extension to you
[57:42] and I to bring to pass what he has
[57:45] called for now watch this in the
[57:49] scripture here this is God's promise and
[57:51] I want to draw your attention back here
[57:53] into Genesis 27 verse 43 where Rebekah
[57:57] was speaking to Jacob before he moved
[57:59] into that place of coming before his
[58:02] father you know and and saying that I am
[58:05] he saw and so forth
[58:07] notice how Rebekah says to him
[58:10] concerning these things you know after
[58:12] this has taken place and she says to him
[58:15] in verse 43 my son obey my voice and
[58:18] arise and flee doubt to Laban my brother
[58:21] to her own and tarry with him a few days
[58:24] until thy brother's fury turn away until
[58:27] thy brother's anger turn away from thee
[58:29] and he forget with that which thou has
[58:32] done to him then I will send and fetch
[58:35] thee from fence why should I be deprived
[58:38] also of you both in one day
[58:40] Who am I who was that was that Rebekah
[58:43] or was that the Spirit of God I will
[58:47] send and fetch you Rebekah notice she's
[58:50] moving in line with the promise of God
[58:54] as we looked at that she heard the time
[58:57] of the blessing of that prayer was to be
[59:01] given and she moves and Jacob is
[59:04] prepared to go in and receive the
[59:06] pronouncing of the blessing upon his
[59:08] life and that of the birthright to
[59:12] receive that pronouncement of it but
[59:14] notice when this then this begins to
[59:16] arrive Esau's countenance and how Esau
[59:19] is looking about Jacob causes Rebekah to
[59:23] rise and she says get out of here and go
[59:26] but not just flee anywhere notice the
[59:29] word is not left open lose to where we
[59:32] become vagabonds and
[59:34] Wanderers the word holds a clear
[59:37] direction for our life hallelujah and
[59:42] here she speaks to him and she has and
[59:45] she makes the statement I will send and
[59:48] fetch me from fits yet he wasn't Rebecca
[59:50] who is fetching him but the same Holy
[59:54] Spirit is dealing with his heart to
[59:57] return back oh my hallelujah how that
[1:00:01] our desire is to say God helped me to be
[1:00:04] in tune and in line with you
[1:00:06] you realize sometimes there's many
[1:00:08] things that you and I listen friends
[1:00:10] there's many times I've stood right here
[1:00:12] or I've been in a youth meeting or been
[1:00:13] other places and I hadn't felt spiritual
[1:00:16] about a certain thing maybe but I'm
[1:00:18] saying on preaching you've been in that
[1:00:20] same condition too and you look at a
[1:00:22] situation come to find out if things are
[1:00:24] being spoken and said that are the very
[1:00:26] answers helpful needs in people's lives
[1:00:29] but I'll tell you how standing there
[1:00:31] amazed just as much as when I do feel
[1:00:33] very spiritual about something because
[1:00:36] it's God who is in control it's God
[1:00:39] teaching you and I'm not to rest on our
[1:00:42] feelings but to rest on him who have
[1:00:45] called us I hear how the Prophet looking
[1:00:49] there in the message third Exodus and
[1:00:50] he's talking about a painting that a
[1:00:52] brother has drawn for him and brother
[1:00:54] Bram says this brother he said perhaps
[1:00:56] didn't even know it when he was making
[1:00:58] this drawing he said but he goes into
[1:01:00] the details involving that drawing he
[1:01:03] said that every one of these things the
[1:01:05] Lord when I looked at that painting he
[1:01:06] said the Lord spoke to my heart God was
[1:01:09] directing even the brother who did the
[1:01:12] painting that that that painting itself
[1:01:14] would minister to the prophets heart
[1:01:18] something that would be deemed to be
[1:01:20] maybe not so significant but yet it has
[1:01:23] a significance to your eye
[1:01:29] Jacob's got a longing to return home
[1:01:33] notice in Genesis 30 verse 25 it came to
[1:01:39] pass
[1:01:40] when Rachel had born Joseph that Jacob
[1:01:46] said unto Laban send me away then I may
[1:01:50] go unto my own place and to my own
[1:01:53] country to my country now notice here
[1:01:57] Jacob has been there the whole time the
[1:02:02] Bible of the Bible says in in hosea 12
[1:02:04] 12 is a Jacob went into the land of her
[1:02:07] own but Israel served for a wife
[1:02:11] understand that was that you can look at
[1:02:14] Jacob but beneath Jacob there was always
[1:02:16] Israel but it would take God to bring
[1:02:19] forth Israel but in the mix of the time
[1:02:23] like Jacob was out in the land of Iran
[1:02:25] him meeting and and coming into that
[1:02:27] place of where that his love and desire
[1:02:30] was for Rachel but Halima comes into a
[1:02:33] place to where leah is the first one
[1:02:35] that's married and and then you see how
[1:02:37] that God orchestrates the order and the
[1:02:40] timing of all those things and you know
[1:02:42] friends if we're not careful we miss
[1:02:44] over and we run over things and we
[1:02:46] overlook little things in our life and
[1:02:49] yet God is ministering to you and I
[1:02:51] through the little things in our life
[1:02:53] that sometimes we look beyond because
[1:02:55] we're solely interested in something has
[1:02:58] to be big it isn't something that has to
[1:03:00] be big God himself had never came to the
[1:03:04] earth to make himself big but he came
[1:03:06] and he took the form of a servant and
[1:03:09] God Himself can minister and dust
[1:03:11] minister to our lives through things
[1:03:13] many times that are not big and high in
[1:03:16] whatever more by the world but it's God
[1:03:18] coming and ministering to you and I it
[1:03:21] might be through a special it might be
[1:03:23] through a word it might be through
[1:03:25] devotion it and God might send it
[1:03:27] through a brother through a sister what
[1:03:29] is it it's God ministering to the needs
[1:03:31] of his children this is the day this is
[1:03:36] the day where the attitude of the saints
[1:03:38] despise the small things
[1:03:42] but this is a time in an hour that we
[1:03:44] recognize the value because you catch it
[1:03:48] in the small things God reveals it in
[1:03:50] other things take up senseless in his
[1:03:54] spirit notice this right here God has
[1:03:58] not told him to go back God didn't tell
[1:04:02] him right here
[1:04:02] rise up but Joseph this you notice it
[1:04:06] was a birth that had taken place a
[1:04:10] breath that had come that caused him to
[1:04:12] long to return back home it was not just
[1:04:17] a birth it wasn't a birth of Judah
[1:04:19] it wasn't the birth of build a new one
[1:04:21] if it wasn't or you know I never Talia
[1:04:24] wasn't the birth of those that struck
[1:04:26] this but it was that birth but Joseph
[1:04:29] that caused him to desire to go back
[1:04:32] home
[1:04:33] glory be to God what what is that
[1:04:36] speaking of that desire that would be
[1:04:39] within the hearts of God's children
[1:04:42] listen that longing and desire has been
[1:04:45] for the second coming of the Lord been
[1:04:48] desire has been for for our Joseph
[1:04:50] Christ to make himself known in this
[1:04:53] time in this generation longing for our
[1:04:56] honeymoon our millennium not catching
[1:04:59] away has been a longing for that and
[1:05:01] notice it was the birthing of something
[1:05:04] of that of Joseph that put him in a
[1:05:06] place to where he desired to go back
[1:05:09] home
[1:05:10] hey man it's the same way when God sends
[1:05:13] his word God has sent his word in this
[1:05:16] hour it puts a longing and the desire
[1:05:18] that is in line with God's desire what
[1:05:21] is it it's everything lining up with
[1:05:24] God's time everything the Prophet tells
[1:05:31] us how that you know that they're in the
[1:05:34] Pentecost of hell that he speaks of how
[1:05:38] that that true church he says on the
[1:05:39] resume of the ages the true church would
[1:05:42] return to being the bride she was at
[1:05:45] Pentecost we know that there must have
[1:05:47] necessity be a return of dynamic power I
[1:05:50] don't want to elaborate on this too much
[1:05:52] but that return of dynamic power
[1:05:54] it is also in line with how God moved in
[1:05:58] the book of Acts every day you know I
[1:06:01] dealt with a little subject when I was
[1:06:03] over there how the Spirit of God just
[1:06:04] led me to speak in one of the meetings
[1:06:06] we were in and I just just took the
[1:06:08] inspiration and ran with it that you
[1:06:10] know sometimes we're so interested and
[1:06:12] we're focused on the object of the
[1:06:14] picture which is Christ within the bride
[1:06:16] but you know to really get also value of
[1:06:19] that you've got to see the background or
[1:06:21] the setting of which that object is
[1:06:23] walking in and that's where when you
[1:06:25] look when we stand there on the other
[1:06:26] side it's not gonna be where you know
[1:06:29] we're looking at that we think of the
[1:06:30] martyrs we think of many different ones
[1:06:32] but when we stand there they're going to
[1:06:34] be coming to you and I and say these are
[1:06:36] the ones that came out of that last
[1:06:38] stage how did you do it what was it what
[1:06:42] is it it was same Christ in them as it
[1:06:45] is in you and you could say well it's a
[1:06:47] greater master that is true but it's
[1:06:49] still got working but what is it that
[1:06:51] causes them to say honey these are the
[1:06:54] people who came out of Lady ousia it's
[1:06:56] the setting that you came through the
[1:07:01] pressures everything that surrounded it
[1:07:04] and to find that how that there are
[1:07:07] times as you know I was expressing to
[1:07:10] them and expressed to you that every day
[1:07:12] was not a day like when Paul was
[1:07:15] preaching and he perceived that man had
[1:07:16] faith and he walked up and you know and
[1:07:19] asked Oldham and erisa every day was not
[1:07:21] that kind of a day as far as where there
[1:07:24] was a miracle taking place like that in
[1:07:27] every ministry it's not rich and we're
[1:07:30] betting there were special miracles from
[1:07:33] this man's ministry and this man's
[1:07:34] ministry it's special miracles from the
[1:07:37] hands of Paul why was those special
[1:07:40] miracles to get the attention of those
[1:07:43] that they might believe and recognize
[1:07:46] God God steel moves the same way when
[1:07:50] the need arises he steps in and moves
[1:07:55] they're right as a people of God because
[1:07:59] look friends you know that was
[1:08:01] expressing there you take a man that is
[1:08:03] anointed by God such as Apostle Paul and
[1:08:05] here he is you know standing for the
[1:08:08] truth miracles being done and all sorts
[1:08:10] of things and yet here comes a time
[1:08:12] where we're a secret is told that there
[1:08:14] are men that are wanting to take your
[1:08:16] life Paul didn't go out there and say
[1:08:18] blessed God I'm the messenger of the
[1:08:20] hour anointed with the Holy Ghost I got
[1:08:22] the word I'll speak him out of existence
[1:08:25] no sir the wisdom of God called him in
[1:08:27] that moment and said get in the basket
[1:08:29] they'll let you down over the wall he
[1:08:32] didn't look like a brain man but he was
[1:08:34] in God's will it was the wisdom of God
[1:08:38] for that moment I wonder what the people
[1:08:41] of God would they have looked at it and
[1:08:43] said oh my the message has lost power
[1:08:45] the message didn't lose power it comes
[1:08:48] that that power could be harnessed
[1:08:49] inside of the wisdom of God very men
[1:08:54] glory be to God so there's some times
[1:08:56] where you know look at it in this manner
[1:08:58] as I said the little things looks like
[1:09:01] that
[1:09:01] God sent that man that he might tell
[1:09:03] Paul in there hey they're coming to kill
[1:09:05] you get in the basket and get over the
[1:09:07] wall so what are you saying by the same
[1:09:14] hell sometimes there's times for you to
[1:09:16] stand and other times get in the basket
[1:09:17] in standard
[1:09:19] that's what I'm trying to tell you the
[1:09:24] book of Acts 28 chapters but at 828 days
[1:09:29] come on somebody glory be to God he
[1:09:37] sensed and this is what we're talking
[1:09:38] about that that dynamic power that that
[1:09:42] life that would raise a church in his
[1:09:46] resurrection power where that life the
[1:09:49] life of Christ being displayed so
[1:09:52] perfectly within the hearts and lives of
[1:09:55] the believer
[1:09:55] that's God's promise and God's promise
[1:09:58] there were people who begin to pray for
[1:10:00] that the Prophet said the believers
[1:10:02] sense this in their spirits and begin
[1:10:05] crying to God for a new outpouring such
[1:10:09] as was in the first century that was God
[1:10:14] moving them to pray for that that there
[1:10:17] would be a restoration of the gifts and
[1:10:19] so they began to pray for that and we we
[1:10:22] understand those things that had
[1:10:24] happened what was that that's a longing
[1:10:25] to return back to the place from whence
[1:10:30] they had fallen it it was a Spirit of
[1:10:33] God stirring that up to where but there
[1:10:35] was people who were ordained to come
[1:10:38] under that word and they would send
[1:10:40] themselves would be there in that word
[1:10:42] would fell within that hour but remember
[1:10:45] we and understand that that in itself
[1:10:47] was not the full restoration many
[1:10:51] thought that he was the full restoration
[1:10:53] are you with me many thought that that's
[1:10:56] what it was but it cannot be notice
[1:10:58] God's timing let me just read it he said
[1:11:00] what seemed to be the answer came has
[1:11:03] many began to speak in tongues and
[1:11:04] manifests gifts of the Spirit
[1:11:06] it was then believed that this was
[1:11:08] indeed the long-awaited restoration it
[1:11:11] was not for the latter rain can come
[1:11:13] only after the former rain which is the
[1:11:16] spring or teaching rain see this is the
[1:11:19] word when the scripture says in the book
[1:11:21] of Mark it says concerning after they
[1:11:25] had been filled with the Holy Ghost it
[1:11:26] says they went about preaching the word
[1:11:29] the Lord confirming it with signs and
[1:11:33] wonders amen the spirit doesn't go ahead
[1:11:36] the spirit follows the word amen the
[1:11:40] spirit comes behind the word too quick
[1:11:42] in that word that's why it's receiving
[1:11:45] the word and we received that word the
[1:11:47] Spirit of God comes right behind that
[1:11:49] word to make that word of life it's God
[1:11:53] confirming his word notice the latter
[1:11:56] rain Ben is the harvest rain how could
[1:11:58] this be the real thing when the teaching
[1:12:00] rain had not come the Prophet messenger
[1:12:03] who was sent to teach the people turn
[1:12:04] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:12:06] Pentecostal father's had not yet come
[1:12:09] thus what was thought to be the
[1:12:11] restoration and the final quickening
[1:12:14] unto the rapture had not come in it was
[1:12:17] a mixture not listen it's not so much
[1:12:20] that the thinking of this is the final
[1:12:22] quickening but remember the Spirit of
[1:12:24] God is stirring the people up for that
[1:12:26] moment but God seeing the need according
[1:12:29] to his word and by his Spirit he brings
[1:12:31] leadership that the people themselves
[1:12:33] know firmly where we are planet in the
[1:12:37] junction of time in God's Word because
[1:12:41] if you're looking at one thing and
[1:12:43] saying this is it and that is not it
[1:12:45] then your expectation isn't something
[1:12:48] that God has not been declared to be
[1:12:51] this is it they're right so God brings
[1:12:56] that alignment so thus he says in it was
[1:12:59] a mixture of the unrighteous partaking
[1:13:02] of spiritual blessings and manifesting
[1:13:04] in the Holy Ghost as we kept pointing
[1:13:06] out to you and it was also devil power
[1:13:08] as men were under the control of devils
[1:13:11] yet no one seemed to realize it then to
[1:13:14] prove that it was not real these people
[1:13:16] even before a second generation had
[1:13:18] appeared organized and wrote their own
[1:13:20] scriptural doctrines and built their own
[1:13:22] fences as every other group ahead of
[1:13:25] them did oh my aren't you grateful that
[1:13:31] the Spirit of God cleanses
[1:13:35] aren't you glad for the washing of water
[1:13:37] by the word they meant that purchase
[1:13:40] ideas what brother Samuel when I was
[1:13:43] born again I lost all my dearest no you
[1:13:45] didn't because that's an idea that's
[1:13:46] still got to be washed
[1:13:47] you're being transformed your mind is
[1:13:50] being reviewed by Christ it's God
[1:13:53] removing any ideas or anything any
[1:13:56] hindrance that he would receive all the
[1:14:00] glory and preeminence notices Jacob
[1:14:04] rises in verse 26 of this chapter same
[1:14:07] thing where now after Joseph has been
[1:14:09] born and he's desiring to go give me my
[1:14:12] wives and my children speaking to Laban
[1:14:15] for whom have I served thee and let me
[1:14:18] go for thou knowest my service which I
[1:14:22] have done thee notice where Jacob sat
[1:14:25] Jacob is basing everything on his works
[1:14:30] you know what I've done
[1:14:32] my works validate me my service so he's
[1:14:39] still here
[1:14:40] his desiring to go but he's still under
[1:14:43] a place of service and Laban says unto
[1:14:47] Him I pray thee if I have found favor in
[1:14:50] thine eyes tarry for I have learned by
[1:14:53] experience that the Lord has blessed me
[1:14:56] for thy sake see Laban took knowledge of
[1:15:01] one thing that after Jacob has come that
[1:15:05] things changed around his home you know
[1:15:13] friends God even to where God would set
[1:15:19] you and I and have us to be God
[1:15:22] orchestrates everything after the
[1:15:24] counsel of his own will as long as
[1:15:28] Joseph was there in Egypt God blessed
[1:15:32] Egypt is that right god bless them it
[1:15:36] wasn't because Egypt was a great master
[1:15:38] man is because Joseph was there
[1:15:42] god bless labels of not because of Laban
[1:15:45] because Jacob was there I'd say here
[1:15:48] right now
[1:15:49] God will bless even the company and
[1:15:52] where you were because you're there
[1:15:57] that's absolutely the truth God can
[1:16:00] bless right there where a person is
[1:16:02] walking faithful to God and God can move
[1:16:05] upon that you say well why is this door
[1:16:08] closing that we commit that in the hands
[1:16:10] of God but friends let me tell you the
[1:16:12] greatest thing that a company could do
[1:16:14] was hire a real child of God it had all
[1:16:17] of me when it comes out the resume you
[1:16:19] can put on the resume and intellect out
[1:16:22] of God baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:16:24] that's it jobs yours as a matter of fact
[1:16:29] you're the CEO right now but they don't
[1:16:36] see it in that way but see God will
[1:16:39] allow things to be blessed but notice
[1:16:41] there are times we realize of how that
[1:16:43] things will arise even within the hearts
[1:16:45] of men to where they begin to look at it
[1:16:48] that it's them that's doing it's them
[1:16:49] that doing and God will allow all of
[1:16:51] those things because in this earth we
[1:16:54] have no continuing City and if there's
[1:16:57] not things that comes to us once in a
[1:16:59] while that would bring a trial hardship
[1:17:02] a suffering then we begin to become
[1:17:04] lacks we're just like what Jacob where
[1:17:07] Jacob says come on I want to go home but
[1:17:09] then we found here again that there is a
[1:17:12] something that is presented to him in
[1:17:15] regards to staying and Jacob accepts it
[1:17:21] does he have a desire to go home he does
[1:17:25] now here is God this is a fulfillment of
[1:17:29] what God had told Abraham that I will I
[1:17:33] will bless thee God had already told
[1:17:35] Jacob I will bless thee now notice in
[1:17:38] verse 28 here Laban says appoint me thy
[1:17:41] wages and I will give it and he said
[1:17:44] unto Him thou knowest how I have served
[1:17:47] thee and how that cattle was with me
[1:17:49] he's recalling asking Laban to look at
[1:17:52] his integrity
[1:17:54] port of those little which thou has
[1:17:56] before I came and it is now increased
[1:17:59] unto a multitude and the LORD hath
[1:18:02] blessed V since my coming whoa now it's
[1:18:08] not just Laban this testifying Jacob
[1:18:11] knows the reason everything's increasing
[1:18:14] is because I'm here this is not
[1:18:17] arrogance listen friends let me just
[1:18:20] share this with you when I was still
[1:18:22] teaching school there was a thing that
[1:18:24] came out here in the state of Ohio
[1:18:25] probably most of you wouldn't know about
[1:18:27] it that Iran involved in teaching or
[1:18:29] whatever more some of you might because
[1:18:30] it involved things more than teaching
[1:18:32] but it was what they called I think of a
[1:18:33] Senate bill 5 and in Senate bill 5 there
[1:18:36] are things that they wanted to do it was
[1:18:38] when right before Strickland had come
[1:18:40] into office there and when there was
[1:18:43] there was it so it's been over 12 years
[1:18:44] ago I think 12 14 years ago and in that
[1:18:47] Senate Senate bill 5 it was things you
[1:18:49] know where they were looking to break
[1:18:50] unions and all other sorts of things and
[1:18:52] the things that they were wanting to do
[1:18:54] is as far as when it came to myself as a
[1:18:57] teacher is strip rights away to where
[1:18:59] that after I'm finished with one year of
[1:19:01] teaching then I actually I'm not
[1:19:04] promised to go back and teach 4th grade
[1:19:06] next year but I have to almost
[1:19:08] re-interview for a job because well your
[1:19:11] kids they tested this way tested that
[1:19:13] way so we're going to see if we can
[1:19:15] place you into fifth grade it doesn't
[1:19:17] take a rocket scientist to know that if
[1:19:19] you even like on anybody in your job you
[1:19:21] establish a confidence you establish all
[1:19:24] of those things as time and years ago
[1:19:26] they say on average it takes forever
[1:19:28] egde of three years for a person to
[1:19:30] become comfortable and confident not
[1:19:32] just in your skill but in the
[1:19:34] surroundings that surrounds you so here
[1:19:36] how could it how could a person ever be
[1:19:39] successful at going this year you're
[1:19:40] teaching fourth grade next year you're
[1:19:42] teaching sixth grade next year teaching
[1:19:44] seventh grade and so forth but you see
[1:19:46] what it is it's people who never walk or
[1:19:47] in the boots on the ground in the
[1:19:49] classroom and you know I understand
[1:19:51] there's a lot of arguments with this and
[1:19:53] that and so forth but when I looked at
[1:19:55] it this is what I'm trying to tell you
[1:19:56] when I looked at those things there was
[1:19:58] an element of fear that wanted to grab
[1:20:00] my life because I looked at things of
[1:20:03] test scores that I had not
[1:20:04] my goodness I'll pour myself into the
[1:20:07] things I do I've never been one who just
[1:20:09] showed up and clocked out at a certain
[1:20:11] time I would work during my lunch time
[1:20:13] I would work after school staying to
[1:20:14] five five thirty what I'm saying I
[1:20:16] became I became consumed with that thing
[1:20:19] and thinking oh my goodness how how am I
[1:20:20] gonna do it but I remember standing that
[1:20:23] I'd come to a place I said wait a minute
[1:20:24] and I know it was God that brought it to
[1:20:26] my attention hold on I did not give
[1:20:29] myself this job I didn't open this door
[1:20:34] that happened the last year before I
[1:20:37] switched schools help to the other
[1:20:39] school and switching to the other school
[1:20:41] then all the sudden merit brighter
[1:20:42] pupils as a matter of fact in many of
[1:20:44] those cases out of those three years I
[1:20:46] had all of the IEP students and those
[1:20:49] who are also low performers in my
[1:20:52] classroom but to God be the glory
[1:20:54] I had tests within that room where they
[1:20:56] were passing their tests not just
[1:20:58] passing it but many even on the IV were
[1:21:01] considered accelerated who did that not
[1:21:06] me God there are things that I learned
[1:21:09] but you see it couldn't have even been
[1:21:11] that to be open to learning had it not
[1:21:13] been that God Himself would drop that
[1:21:16] upon my heart wait a minute who gave me
[1:21:18] this job sometimes you have to reverse
[1:21:22] it who you are and who's put you where
[1:21:25] you are because he now that has put you
[1:21:28] where you are it's up to him to keep you
[1:21:30] and to watch over you every door that he
[1:21:33] is open God will keep that door open
[1:21:38] hope you understand what I'm saying I'm
[1:21:40] bragging on me I'm bragging on him each
[1:21:44] time I stand up and then faculty means I
[1:21:46] testified of the Lord Jesus Christ when
[1:21:48] they read about the test scores I
[1:21:50] testified it was him
[1:21:53] but you see God had to deal with me
[1:21:56] first before I could ever be open to it
[1:21:59] notice and now when shall I provide for
[1:22:03] my own house also see he's got a longing
[1:22:08] for a house he's got a longing to
[1:22:12] separate from under labor there's a
[1:22:16] desire there's a long you see this
[1:22:17] longing to
[1:22:18] turn it's there it's present
[1:22:22] so then Laban ask him what what shall I
[1:22:25] give thee Jacob said thou shalt not give
[1:22:28] me anything if that will do this thing
[1:22:31] for me I will again feed and keep thy
[1:22:35] flock see Jacobs committing himself he's
[1:22:40] committing himself to what remain and
[1:22:44] labor but I thought he had a desire to
[1:22:47] go home he did it's just like their own
[1:22:50] over for God pouring out the gifts on
[1:22:54] the Zuza Street
[1:22:54] didn't they have a longing for that for
[1:22:57] the full restoration to come they did
[1:22:59] they did but how that they continued
[1:23:04] recalls remember look friends the
[1:23:06] doctrines that remained all of those
[1:23:09] things that remained still among the
[1:23:11] Church of the Living God doctrines of
[1:23:14] devils you with me
[1:23:18] baptizing in in and in titles that's not
[1:23:22] a doctrine of God God said that god
[1:23:25] there's one baptism one Lord one faith
[1:23:28] amen jesus said be baptized in the name
[1:23:31] of the Father Son and of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:34] the name being been of the Lord Jesus
[1:23:36] Christ God revealing his name that the
[1:23:40] name of the sacrifice the name of the
[1:23:43] true atonement the name of his children
[1:23:46] calling us by his name Jacob said I'll
[1:23:52] pass through all the flock today removed
[1:23:55] from thence all the speckled and spotted
[1:23:56] cattle and all the brown cattle among
[1:23:59] the sheep and the spotted and speckled
[1:24:00] among the goats and of all such shall be
[1:24:02] my hire some sell my righteousness
[1:24:04] answer from me and time to come when it
[1:24:07] shall come from my hire before thy face
[1:24:08] every one that is not speckled and
[1:24:10] spotted among the goats and brown among
[1:24:12] the sheep that shall be counted stolen
[1:24:15] from me Laban said Behold I would it
[1:24:19] might be according to thy word and the
[1:24:23] scripture tells us in verse 35 that he
[1:24:25] removed all of those that day that were
[1:24:27] the ringstraked and spotted and all of
[1:24:30] that among you know
[1:24:31] the the goats and so forth and gave them
[1:24:34] under the hands of his sons the Bible
[1:24:36] says in verse 36 he set three days
[1:24:38] journey betwixt himself and Jacob and
[1:24:40] Jacob fed the rest of Laban flocks three
[1:24:45] days journey between the flocks and here
[1:24:48] is think of what Laban is going through
[1:24:52] no doubt in his mind at this time wages
[1:24:57] remember Laban 's agreement Laban is not
[1:25:00] going to be outdone in a deal but Jacobs
[1:25:06] a shyster - Jacob had studied the tax
[1:25:16] code pretty well and Laban looks upon
[1:25:25] this and agrees to this term and you
[1:25:29] know I'm not going to take the time but
[1:25:31] the scripture goes on in verse 42 to
[1:25:34] tell us of how that the fee bore in
[1:25:37] verse 42 of that chapter were Laban and
[1:25:40] the stronger Jacobs after Jacob moving
[1:25:44] putting out the poplar branches you know
[1:25:46] and stripping him down and those things
[1:25:48] the scripture says in verse 43 and the
[1:25:51] man increased exceedingly and had much
[1:25:55] cattle and made service talking about
[1:25:57] Jacob and men servants and camels and
[1:26:00] asses but then at the beginning of the
[1:26:04] chapter we read for our text Laban sons
[1:26:09] start noticing this increase this is
[1:26:12] different they see and they view it that
[1:26:18] Jacob has stolen from our father and
[1:26:23] their words poison
[1:26:26] Laban see God allows it God allows it
[1:26:29] hey just like when the scripture says
[1:26:32] that there arose of Pharaoh who knew not
[1:26:35] Joseph brother brems says in 3rd Exodus
[1:26:38] that was the beginning of the beginning
[1:26:41] God had to allow that
[1:26:44] but you know when that arose the
[1:26:46] children of Israel increased during that
[1:26:49] time so here Jacob taking this direction
[1:26:56] and how that in verse four let me just
[1:26:59] go to verse four here and try to finish
[1:27:01] this up here for tonight jacob sins and
[1:27:04] he calls Rachel and Leah to the field
[1:27:08] unto his flocks he says I see your
[1:27:10] father's countenance that it's not
[1:27:11] toward me as before but the god of my
[1:27:13] father that's been with me and you know
[1:27:17] that with all my power I have served
[1:27:19] your father and once you think of this
[1:27:21] if there was any question Rachel and
[1:27:24] Leah Leah could have could have called
[1:27:26] his bluff on this could have said no you
[1:27:29] haven't
[1:27:30] you've done this and this and this no no
[1:27:32] but Jacob had a testimony that I have
[1:27:36] done all in my power even when your
[1:27:38] daddy wasn't looking I faithfully serve
[1:27:41] I was not an i pleaser but I faithfully
[1:27:47] served what was put out for me to do and
[1:27:52] your father have to save me and changed
[1:27:54] my wages ten times but God suffered him
[1:27:58] not to hurt me Jacob already knew God
[1:28:02] was watching out for him but now this
[1:28:04] becomes what God said in Genesis 28
[1:28:07] Jacob sees God fulfilling it in his life
[1:28:11] now there was a lot of things that was
[1:28:13] set forth to hurt me that God suffered
[1:28:17] him not to if he said thus the speckled
[1:28:20] shall be thy wages then all the cattle
[1:28:22] bear speckled and if he said thus the
[1:28:24] ring straits shall be the hire then bear
[1:28:26] all the cattle ring straight thus God
[1:28:28] hath taken away the cattle of your
[1:28:30] father and have given them to me
[1:28:33] notice who had noticed in verse 10 it
[1:28:36] came to pass at the time that the cattle
[1:28:38] can see I lifted up my eyes and saw in a
[1:28:40] dream and behold the rams which leaped
[1:28:42] upon the cattle were ring straight
[1:28:44] speckled and bristled and the angel of
[1:28:46] God spake unto me in a dream saying
[1:28:48] Jacob and I said here am I he said lift
[1:28:51] up now thine eyes and see all the rams
[1:28:54] which leap upon the cattle or
[1:28:55] ringstraked speckled and bris
[1:28:57] for I have seen all that label Laban
[1:29:00] doeth unto thee where did Jacob get that
[1:29:07] wisdom from God God directed him on
[1:29:16] those things to think about it these are
[1:29:20] not necessarily flocks that would be
[1:29:25] determined maybe to be weak or whatever
[1:29:28] because there was out remember those who
[1:29:30] were good in color there was some of
[1:29:32] those that were weak Jacob did not move
[1:29:35] in the same way so that that weakness
[1:29:37] would come on but he moved upon those
[1:29:40] that were of the strong so out of the
[1:29:43] strong then would come forth that which
[1:29:46] had been made of the ring straightened
[1:29:48] and all of those things notice those
[1:29:50] which Lathan willingly released so no
[1:29:55] value in but Jacob said I'll take those
[1:29:58] from my higher let me tell you something
[1:30:01] what the world rode off as an outcast
[1:30:04] what the world ruled out and said
[1:30:06] there's nothing to them but God said I
[1:30:09] will take them for myself I will take
[1:30:13] them I will purge yourself because it's
[1:30:15] not a decision that's been made in time
[1:30:19] but we were always a part of him a man
[1:30:23] and he came down and paid that price to
[1:30:26] bring you and I back to himself we are
[1:30:29] the purchase of his blood if the Prophet
[1:30:33] said in his sight if I had just even he
[1:30:36] said a vile concern to having the blood
[1:30:39] the literal blood he said do you realize
[1:30:42] in his sight I'm standing in front of
[1:30:46] him before something that is more
[1:30:48] precious to him in his sight than the
[1:30:51] literal blood
[1:30:53] I'm speaking to the purchase of his
[1:30:56] blood God was supplying Jacob faithful
[1:31:02] to his word belonging to returned home
[1:31:05] and all of these things God is
[1:31:08] orchestrating all of these parts to come
[1:31:13] into their place it's God's timing it's
[1:31:17] God's timing and friends when we look at
[1:31:20] this in how that God's timing is so set
[1:31:24] forth it's not God's desire for us to be
[1:31:29] anxious that's his word be careful for
[1:31:32] nothing right don't be anxious for
[1:31:35] tomorrow don't be anxious for this but
[1:31:38] the pressures and everything that around
[1:31:40] us within this age there's a lot of
[1:31:42] things that can come to try to bring
[1:31:44] anxiety and fear and anxiousness that's
[1:31:49] true the conditions that surround in
[1:31:51] Psalms 27 verse 3 those are conditions
[1:31:53] that are not conditions that are bright
[1:31:56] and shiny its conditions of darkness
[1:31:59] that are around demonic pressure but in
[1:32:03] the midst of it what what David focuses
[1:32:06] on is not that he sees it but David said
[1:32:09] in the midst of this time one thing have
[1:32:12] I desired and that one thing will I seek
[1:32:15] after that I may dwell in the house of
[1:32:18] the Lord amen it's what we choose to
[1:32:24] focus upon God is working everything
[1:32:28] after the counsel of his own will you
[1:32:31] know friends it's just wow you know it's
[1:32:33] just like we're you know a person could
[1:32:35] rise up and say well I'll tell you what
[1:32:37] it it won't do no good for the young
[1:32:40] people are not none of them to go to
[1:32:41] college or whatever more where that
[1:32:42] inspiration comes from men look at
[1:32:47] Scripture and look at these different
[1:32:48] things but the reality is is that we
[1:32:50] want to be found ready at all times the
[1:32:56] Prophet makes it very clear he said we
[1:32:59] live as if it would be a hundred years
[1:33:02] or so from now as far as in the planting
[1:33:04] and preparations
[1:33:06] but we live as if he could come within
[1:33:10] the next moment I'll tell you what to do
[1:33:13] that it takes balance because the things
[1:33:18] would want to pull you to go far out
[1:33:20] here and then there's things that could
[1:33:22] also try to push you back here you say
[1:33:24] could that could things push me back
[1:33:25] here yeah it could push you back here as
[1:33:27] well but there's a balance the Prophet
[1:33:30] told us he said if Satan can't keep you
[1:33:33] from something you're trying to push you
[1:33:36] beyond it we don't need radical ideas we
[1:33:41] just need the same God to give us
[1:33:43] strength to wait and to walk in what he
[1:33:49] has unfolded walking and just as God
[1:33:52] moved upon Jacob within those increments
[1:33:54] of time and everything had to get to a
[1:33:57] place to where Jacob no longer saw a
[1:34:00] welcoming place in the house of Labor
[1:34:04] God had to remove or see to it that the
[1:34:08] welcome mat was removed then Jacob knew
[1:34:13] is time to go home and he called his
[1:34:18] wives and said it's time to go he didn't
[1:34:21] speak to Laban he spoke to them it's
[1:34:24] time to go and they gathered themselves
[1:34:27] together and Jacob rose up God
[1:34:32] fulfilling his word all in God's timing
[1:34:37] amen you love him amen let's pray
[1:34:43] Heavenly Father or Jesus
[1:34:51] truly Lord Falls Lord in our hearts as
[1:34:55] we look at this Lord where Jacob's life
[1:34:59] we see our own life Oh God
[1:35:01] the Lord how that you move upon our
[1:35:04] hearts Lord and have moved and continue
[1:35:07] to move Lord
[1:35:08] oh my the Holy Spirit moving upon our
[1:35:12] hearts Lord there is a land beyond the
[1:35:16] river it's called the sweet forever Lord
[1:35:20] Father how we think you Lord God or the
[1:35:23] promise Lord Jesus that moves and fond
[1:35:27] our hearts Lord
[1:35:28] Oh God warming our hearts Lord in this
[1:35:33] our Lord everything Lord that is to be
[1:35:40] in its position every every little cog
[1:35:46] of the wheel Lord has a watch itself the
[1:35:49] Prophet refers to would have many wills
[1:35:52] and those wills Lord interacting with
[1:35:55] one another Lord
[1:35:56] Oh God to see these parts Lord all lined
[1:36:00] up father
[1:36:04] your prophet Lord would make mention and
[1:36:07] note at the very hour that the angel of
[1:36:11] the Lord commissioned him to go into the
[1:36:14] field and pray for the sick it's that
[1:36:17] same hour that same time Lord Israel
[1:36:21] becoming a nation Lord God these things
[1:36:24] Lord all in its timing go to when we
[1:36:27] bring it down into Jacob's life
[1:36:32] Jacob's desired timing was for Rachel
[1:36:36] first then Leah but your timing was Leah
[1:36:41] first and Rachel was to follow your
[1:36:45] timing Lord to wear that even you would
[1:36:48] seal up Rachel's room until Anna point
[1:36:54] of time Oh God everything it's all in
[1:36:58] your time lord help us Lord to be
[1:37:03] faithful help us to move

[1:37:18] the lives Lord every heart Lord has it
[1:37:22] set out before us what a time what an
[1:37:25] hour Lord as we walk in this hour this
[1:37:27] age where truly Lord it's a time where
[1:37:32] the promises that have been spoken are
[1:37:35] now being fulfilled in fullness Lord
[1:37:40] your God to where that we as the people
[1:37:44] of God are under expectation for the
[1:37:48] change of our body
[1:37:52] what I think of many of them older
[1:37:56] brothers sisters Lord that's lived Lord
[1:37:59] before us dear God how many Lord walking
[1:38:03] Lord in this way they're goners I
[1:38:07] remember Lord even before you got ahold
[1:38:11] of my life and then even after I would
[1:38:13] hear many say we never thought it would
[1:38:16] last to this time and Lord is true we
[1:38:21] look at these things Lord and we we
[1:38:24] don't see even when we look at in light
[1:38:27] of the scripture right now where the cup
[1:38:29] of iniquity Lord being filled Lord as we
[1:38:34] look at things we would look at it and
[1:38:36] say it's gotta be running over it's
[1:38:39] gonna be but Lord we know that it's not
[1:38:42] a pastime there were those Lord when
[1:38:46] Lazarus had went on Lord they said if
[1:38:50] you had been here he wouldn't have died
[1:38:53] but you were right on time right on time
[1:38:59] that God that they might see that
[1:39:02] witness that you are now not in the
[1:39:05] future but you are now the resurrection
[1:39:08] and the life
[1:39:10] Oh God help us Lord Father we don't want
[1:39:17] to try to make ourselves something we
[1:39:19] don't want to try to Lord God figure
[1:39:22] things out we want to be able to walk in
[1:39:25] the light with the desire Lord that you
