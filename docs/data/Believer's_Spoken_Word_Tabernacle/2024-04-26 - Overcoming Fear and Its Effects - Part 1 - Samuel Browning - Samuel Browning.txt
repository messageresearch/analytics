let's just approach him in a word of prayer here tonight Heavenly Father Lord how we just want to say thank you Lord truly Lord as the words of the song Lord would be pinned by inspiration Lord father it's in everything we see Lord even when David would write of it Lord and the sacrifices what would even be presented there Lord through Leviticus on and on Lord where even it would speak in worship Lord we just don't want you to have a part of our life we don't want you just to have our voice or just to have our hands our mind we want you to have every part of our being Lord Lord God most importantly Lord that you would have that of our soul Our Lives oh God and Father through there Lord Jesus where your presence Lord would so move to influence and give us strength through every other realm Lord in our lives to worship ship you I think Lord and mindful of how that Paul would write to the Corinthian Church writing to Believers Lord that dear God even in that instance Lord where they were standing with you and Lord where their lives had already been touched and been changed and Paul would remind them you're bought with a price glorify God therefore in your spirit and in your body Lord we want you to have every business B of us Lord your Prophet would remind us Lord of how that Samson gave his strength that he gave his heart elsewhere Lord we want you to have every bit of us Lord most important Lord is our heart Lord Jesus then everything will be under the right direction help us Lord I pray we just so love you Lord we appreciate you help us Lord even as we look at your word help us Lord May you search out our hearts Lord your desire is to help us Lord your desire is to minister to us Lord oh God the thoughts that you think toward us Lord not thoughts of evil but thoughts of Peace of an expected end and Lord God may you just speak to our hearts tonight in a special way may you continue to minister Lord to each and every one Lord thinking of the requests that we already Lord read here across this Pulpit Lord Brother Carlos there Lord in the hospital you see the need Lord in our brother's body Lord God we just ask that you would just continue to move Lord God for that need Lord for him Lord how we are so thankful God for your mercies we thank you Lord Brother Carlos ask that you would just touch him Lord we thank you Father for Lord how that you've

for her Lord we just ask Lord as well for sister Suzanne Keener Lord so thankful for the good report Lord that we've received and we just ask that you'll continue to strengthen her Lord and touch her Lord many other needs Lord no doubt Lord upon the hearts of your children Lord God there were many uplifted hands Lord undoubtedly when it was asked about unspoken request we all stand in need of you Lord and have different needs Upon Our Hearts and request and Lord we're thankful that God to realize that there's nothing that's greater or too hard for you father so Lord we just want to commit it Lord all into your hands and in these few moments you've given us Lord May every bit of Our Lives be so committed Into You Lord father you would just come Among Us and do the exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or think Lord we ask ask it Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen if you'll turn with me in the Bible to Job chapter 3 I um brother brother Greg kener he had um text me today and U sister Suzanne is doing uh much better she's on a walker right now it'll go from a walker to a cane and then getting back but as far as the pain that she had been dealing with in her back that's gone that's all gone but the you know how it is the pain from the surgery or the procedure that was done that's that's what she's uh just had to deal with right now but so they just wanted me to pass it along and just say thank you because they know it's just the prayers that's really just that's just holding holding her up and so we want to just uh remember her in prayer as well I want to read here from uh three verses scripture out of job and it's kind of going back um a little bit here but um dealing with this thought uh on worry and uh where job was at and that we've been dealing with that for some time and to remember as the prophet said and I have heard but now I see I started out reading that to you and that's where we kind of Drew some things from is that when things were not going as they normally would or job couldn't get an answer now I don't know how long it was just like you don't know or I don't know how long it is until we get an answer you might be facing something and you might been had other situations where you know okay it's been maybe days or weeks or months or something and then I've always got an answer somehow maybe it's when I've come to the house of God maybe I've been in prayer somewhere you've got an answer but then let's say here you've went on for days weeks months and it's it's gone in a manner that's just much different seemingly to you and yet this is where for job remember God he knew God by inspiration and so when he had not received that inspiration as far as what was taking place at that moment and what we'll call that inspiration is substance Faith because faith is a revelation it takes a revelation of what God has done for you through Calvary and that Revelation is the new birth and then from there every situation and things that we come to we trust God but yet there's times where we don't know what the outcome's going to be but we trust him is that right that's like the Hebrew children they didn't know that they were going to walk out of that fiery furnace but they trusted the Lord is that right so they they didn't have a thus sayith the Lord I'm going to walk out of here they did not have that of a substance that I'm going to walk out of here but they did have that substance they knew where they were standing with God that if this situation it's not going to separate me from God that's right I don't know I don't know how God's going to work this out but it's not going to separate me from God so that's why it's so important that faith is the victory that overcometh the world so when job he didn't he didn't remember he he wasn't getting that inspiration so he got worried and I'm sure everybody every one of us here have been through those times where you're not getting an answer or maybe something isn't coming in a way that you are used to coming and that's where the Prophet said it was worrying him so it was no longer just a concern it had become a worry a worry and a worry is an an anxiousness and anxiety now watch this back here in the beginning in Job 3 this is where I want to draw from for my sign cometh before I eat and my roarings are poured out like the waters for the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me wow job had fear the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me and that which I was afraid of is come unto me I was not in safety neither had I rest neither was I quiet yet trouble came I'd like to speak here tonight at least to start in on this overcoming fear and its effects may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I've often looked at this scripture and I think back to when I first started pastoring there in 2002 and we took a little series on job that the Lord would let L us into at that moment there's certain parts and things within the scriptures that I I just be honest with with you I don't I don't understand all the way or I don't sometimes it's just hard to as we look into it but I believe God would give us insight into these things and when we can look and pick these things up and sometimes we can put job and other men Elijah and so forth and others even brothers and sisters we go to church with and we can sometimes put people somewhat on a pedestal but we don't see the battles they go through behind the scenes it's not we're trying to the actors it's not that at all CU I know sometimes we can call one another and say hey I'm in a battle I'm I'm In the Heat of the battle I need some backup right now and we're able to stand there and pray for one another but we realize James would write very specifically you know James was a was one who would write um it was very much kind of in a way like a pastoral epistle because it always dealt with feet on the ground remember he would write about faith itself but he would write about faith differently than Paul would James would say that with you say that you have no works with your faith then your faith is in vain but he would say faith without works it's dead so James was was you know was was was feet on the ground type guy knowing that yes we're to be influenced by the Heavenly but whatever is in when we're influenced by the Heavenly then it will actually show itself out through our lives and so when we look at this scripture here in verse 25 the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me and that which I was afraid of is come unto me I want you to watch how brother branam brings this in perfect Faith he says in the Book of Job it says here job feared and what he feared it actually happened what brought it his fear that's what made it happen his faith would have kept would have kept him from it but his fear brought it to him he was scared it was going to happen and it did happen if he hadn't if he knowed it wouldn't have happened it wouldn't have happened now you know it's a Marvel I I'm not going to go into this tonight but it's a Marvel to give account after account that even you find that many times of how that fear will work upon the physical body where there's people there's one account that I have here in in my studies of one lady who was laying there in the hospital or exam room and a doctor came in with a special team of doctors and he he mentioned regarding that this woman that she they look at her and they're looking at the situation and he says to the rest of the doctors um this is uh TS now it's all he says this is TS and immediately she Begins the account of the situation is she begins to think TS you're in in a medical situation your things that you're wanting to know what's going on in your body and immediately the thought comes to her terminal situation and when that comes into her mind immediately her blood pressure Spikes all of these other vitals go up regarding this lady and as they they they they go about the situation and they come in and they begin to speak to her they looking at what what's taking place and they what it is is that she heard TS but actually what it was it had nothing else I I can't pronounce the name I don't I could pull it up it's here in front of me but I I wasn't planning on referring to it but it just comes where where she where she was at it was actually just a condition that wasn't even terminal wasn't even fatal but because she took that in and believed that it actually set things in Motion in her body in a certain way I tell you fear is a terrible thing it's a horrible thing that you know that even while we're here within this life from now until we're changed or go by the way of the Grave we will experience fear fear will come to us in many different forms and varieties but the thing that we want to be able to look at is to be able to discern the spirit of fear when it would come and be able to stand there with God's word and let the word drive it right back out he says now if you're afraid watch how brother Bram brings this application down in of what I just read about job he said if you're afraid when you come by the prayer line maybe I just haven't got the faith sufficient it'll never happen don't worry he says but if you know it's going to happen it'll happen now watch this it's a substance of something so when when that substance he's talking about is Faith when God reveals to you your suffering is over that is a substance for that situation are you with me we have a substance when we've been born again of the spirit of God we have a substance faith in that we know where we're standing with God we passed from Death unto life but as far as the substance when we're right reading this right here it's something that is so made known to you or something that is so personal and and you begin to be occupied by that it's a substance and notice it's a substance of something watch how he says this job had a fear that these things would come up on him and they did marvelous I mean it's incredible faith is a substance and so is fear both of them are substances so fear isn't just something of Simply of just well you know just just don't just don't think that way it's a spirit it's a spirit now watch if you have a fear that your disease won't leave you it won't if you have faith that it will now he says you can ask any medical doctor I I love this simple application the first thing he'll try to get you to do is to have confidence in the medicine he's given you is't that exactly what God does is always to bring our confidence in the word not not focusing on your disease but let's get confidence in what can take care of the situation it just shows us where to be looking at he's given it to you if you haven't got no confidence in it you better leave it alone he said well what is it then it's faith faith that does the healing it's faith that does it all the time now think of this job had no fear of his message being right no fear at all he had no fear of where he was standing with God because he knew even in this scripture the chapter we've been working out of in Job chapter 23 he said I've not gone back from the Commandment of his lips I have esteemed his word from his mouth more than my necessary food he knew where he was standing even when the attacks were coming in upon Him job you've done something surely and all of those things that we went through there about a year ago and bringing those things out and showing all of that but yet with job was able to stand as the prophet would say over and over and over flat-footed this is what I Marvel he is able to stand this way with such a resilient Faith but yet there were things that happened to him because he feared that's a Marvel it's a Marvel to me how how a person and how we and ourselves can have faith in that where we're standing with God but fear can move in there through one of those inlets and fear itself job said the things which I feared have come upon me what I was afraid of now no doubt he must have seen something seen these destructions seen other children being lost seen other things taking place and there had to be something that was presented an unknown something in his mind that he would begin to dwell on that he had no fear of where he was standing so when we think of this it's an aspect of fear that you know that you and I everybody has experienced fear we and fear itself if even after we know it entered in because of the fall but realizing that there's a part of that that's given to you and I for our protection when there's things you you hear a loud bang boom you Run for Cover you try to get away from a situation you hear tires screeching and you're driving on the road you quickly look around of where's the Escape Route or what's going on around me why there's a part within you that even after the fall where fear itself would set in God would place what they would call a response within you and I of how that we would see certain things just like when here you would you know you're walking maybe deep in thought everybody have had probably had this happen you're deep in thought and all of a sudden somebody just say something to you you just it startles you and you're think hey hey hey hey it's all right and you know you were out far away though sitting right there then you've had maybe somebody jump out and scare you and you immediately you know you maybe you jerk back you know to give them a little fivefold or or something you know and it it it's a scare a fear can come about us and sometimes there's things that can happen with a doctor's report can come around our way now I'm not saying that you've accepted it but I'm saying that when things come and things will come they continued even as God would address Israel I'll not get to that tonight but On and On Through the scriptures even when God would confirm his word to his children he would admonish them that there are things that's going to be fearful that's coming up just like when Paul was going to Rome the angel of the Lord visited him that night told him fear not Paul you're going to Rome but before you get there there's going to be a shipwreck and you're going to be up on an island now do you thinking that shipwreck that Paul just you know grabbed the board and just laid back and propped his feet up no he was probably paddling and swimming for his life like you or I would but he had a strength from almighty God that equipped him and helped him to push beyond the fear of present circumstances so it's not that fear won't come it's just we don't want to give a place to fear and give an occupancy or a part of it within our life now not notice when we think of this of how that fear itself and God would speak to you and I let's look at a few scriptures itself of how that God would speak to us about fearing the right thing and not to fear the wrong thing I like how David writes this I've always love the scripture in Psalms 56:3 what time I am afraid my here's a giant killer here's a man that faced a bear and a lion right but remember when he walked out there to face Goliath brother BR said he danced all the way to the battle cuz he already knew the outcome what did he have substance he had a revelation it was finished is that right same thing with the lion the bear so it wasn't just it wasn't just David just walking out there and saying well you know I I trust this takes place but he had a revelation yet there's times in our life there's things we face and say Lord I trust that you'll bring me out Lord I Trust You Lord I'm looking to you and what we're looking for God but sometimes where we and ourselves become so worried is because we don't have a revelation in that moment of a substance of what God's going to do in that moment but yet there is an element are you hearing me tonight there's an element of faith in our soul that will guide us with a true expectation that's called hope it will guide us with the true expectation that I know what God has done I know he's the the god of his word I don't have a direct Revelation regarding this situation but I've got his word on it and I'll take his word and what Revelation comes forth concerning this if God reveals something then I'll accept that but in the meantime I'm going to stand on his word that's why the prophet could say over and over greatest battle ever fought he said if I pray for 10,000 tonight and every one of them died he said I'd be standing on the platform tomorrow night praying for another 10,000 why I trust him look at this David said what time I am afraid my David you mean you had experience fear sure there's situations sometimes that can be very fearful but here's what I'll do I will trust in thee this is this is the battle so you see this isn't like this isn't pretty Texas picnics of you know with smiley white teeth and name it claim it religion that's not what this is no offense sister Lily she's not a she's not that way she's a Texan but she's not that way but you understand what I'm saying it's not this old picnic and and no easy no there's going to be battles but David said when fear comes this is how I'm going to face it amen I will trust in thee in God I love this I will praise His word in God I have put my trust I will not fear what flesh can do unto me so that's we don't want to fear that it's not what flesh can do to you remember it's just like somebody comes up to you on the job boss whomever it is or somebody oh you know this and this wait a minute you didn't give me this job you might have interviewed me but you didn't give me this job oh God gave me this job so I'm going to praise him in his word I'm going to trust him because this is not what I did see this is where we need to turn our attention because it isn't going to be we're going to walk around in a bubble and all of a sudden one of these moments we will be completely in a place where we'll never experience fear anymore that's not true at all we will experience it but this is the way that we handle it I will not fear what flesh can do unto me verse 10 in God will I praise His word in the Lord will I praise His word notice this is where it has to be in God in the Lord this is our place of safety that's our place of Deliverance in him in God have I put my trust I will not be afraid what man can do unto me notice in Luke 12:4 Jes Jesus said I say say unto you my friends be not afraid of them that can kill the body and after that have no more that they can do but I forewarn you whom ye shall fear fear Him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell yay I say unto you fear him so a rightful fear though because remember the fear that comes from the Lord is not a tormenting fear the Bible said the fear of the Lord is clean yes this is what love the love of God comes to do is cast out that ungodly fear and brings about a real reverence and a real trust to the Lord oh my notice when we look at this even in in verse six are not five sparrows sold for two farings and not one of them is forgotten before God now I think it's think to me it's marvelous how God would choose what he does to speak about he does not speak about two golden Mansions or two you know things that are so illustrious but he takes simple little things that you and I would say what would be significant in that I love how the prophet brings that how that God would bring that of two little sparrows even the very hairs of your head verse seven are all numbered fear not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows Revelations 17 when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I'm alive forever more and have the keys of death and of Hell or of hell and of death so with this is where over and over it's admonished even after the Lord Jesus would raise and he would speak to the disciples over and over and we see it all the way through the scriptures even through the New Testament he would admonish his children over and over fear not it's incredible the amount of times that God speaks to Joshua in the book of Joshua I'm not going to get on it tonight but many times not just in the first chapter but every time when they're coming into situations God will address Joshua again uh Be not Afraid be not fearful do not fear why these situations if you look at them they are fearful but don't be afraid don't be afraid that's good don't be afraid yeah now notice so over and over we see this don't fear don't fear don't fear but you see God is not just one is just telling us you know don't fear or don't Fe but but it's him it's him that's telling us this it's him when he comes through his word and speaks to us that's what stabilizes you and I that's that's what gives you and I Strength it's when God comes and God speaks to our lives it's God confirming his word listen you and I could not even walk in the hour hour that we're walking in had it not been for god making himself known that he's the same Living God this is what God did this is why God sends a message this is what this message of the hour is all about it's it's unlike any other message that's hit the face of the Earth because this message is not a rumor that he's alive that's what they had in isusa Street Pentecost it was a rumor that he's alive but when he came back in his fullness it was no longer a rumor he indeed was alive he was Arisen from the grave he proved himself to do the same things he did before he was crucified and what did it do it stabilizes them this is why that Revelation and this is why Walking with God it means so much to our life of where we to draw our strength from to overcome fear and the effects that it would want to bring amen God don't want to let don't God don't want anything to bother us now watch this with Paul in 2 Corinthians chapter 7 and verse 5 now Paul had many many dealings he had a lot of tight places he was in for bringing the gospel watch when Paul said when we were coming to Macedonia our flesh had no rest he didn't say his soul didn't have rest his soul had rest his soul was within the inner Veil but he said our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side without were fightings within were fears that's good oh my you see I I I I love how the scriptures you know Paul this is why brother brandom brother Ram could tell us he said this Bible he said it ain't the book of man book of man all us try to hide highlight man well I don't have fear and I don't that's highlighting man H George Washington never told a lie but God never God does not mind those things being wrote in the scriptures where David could say in what time I am afraid it's not glorifying fear it's glorifying God who through David's life who through Paul's life where they were able to stand there and being honest to somebody else and say what time I'm afraid I will trust in God that's so good hallelujah oh my without we're fightings within were fears Paul feared for his life in what in what way did was Paul fearing that oh no I'm not right with God I'm not ready to meet God no no that it was not the fears that he's talking about it was the fears of are we going to get out of this are we going to get out of this well brother Samuel he knew that was the prophet of God he didn't know that because in order to know that that would require a revelation from God that you are going to come through this everybody hearing me that's a substance that's where it becomes a substance that's where it becomes that Revelation that's where it becomes like the prophet said if the doctor said you were going to die and God were to tell you these things he said you would look at the doct doctor and laugh it would not be a laugh out of fear of no I'm a Believer the that that's not going to happen to me no it would not be that it would not be a laughter of no no no I I'm not going to die I don't want to die no it would be a substance faith and the only way it's a substance faith is by a divine revelation you've come here tonight no doubt faith has brought you here tonight right even every person has a Measure of Faith even now everybody else that's out there they've got a measure of human Faith they got in their car went to work this morning went to their jobs that's Faith fundamental foundation for Faith takes Faith to bring you here but to think about it there's things where you've come here but I could probably ask every one of you and say has it been revealed to you before you got here what God was going to say tonight and how God was going to move probably not but you come here with an expectation because he's moved before and he promised where two or three are gathered together in my name there will I be also these are the kind of people that God wants to worship him this is why the prophet says in three kinds of Believers he said that ought to be the achievement for every every believer is to believe every word of God whether I have a direct revelation of my sickness my disease my situation I've got God's word on it are you with me yes yes sir but sometimes if we don't have a direct thus sayith the Lord we walk around as though we're defeated right that's good don't worry that's how job was going around he was getting all worried cuz he wasn't getting any inspiration he was all worried well I've been praying about this and it's getting he was getting worried I'm glad that God included these things aren't you but watch watch how God deals with this in verse six nevertheless God that comforted those that are cast down comforted Us by the coming of Titus and not by his coming only but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you when he told us of your earnest desire fervent mind toward me so that I Rejoice the the more now notice when Titus comes to them God God does not look down upon Paul and say shame on you for having fears and wondering about what's going to happen God God understands these things but God knows how to work with it and deal with it he sent he didn't send Paul a book he didn't send Paul a tape we believe in books and tapes you ought to be in them but what he sent was the what was on the tapes what was on the books he sent the word made flesh another brother Titus he sent him with a word of comfort and that word of comfort was not Paul get out of your situation it was look it was pointing Paul to what the word was doing in the lives of the Corinthian Believers and when Paul could look at that he drew comfort from seeing God's work sometimes we're looking for answers and they're right before us that is so they're just not coming out in the exact phrases or statements but God will always encourage Us by making his Word Flesh Now watch how brother Bram I love that message greatest B fault it it covers all all basis notice brother B is talking about after the devil is put out of your life he says if he can get in there at all he's got your army routed right then now what is he talking about if if once a Believer has been sealed by the spirit of God Satan can no longer get there in that of the soul but these other two Realms he'll come and he'll attack he'll attack in the mind flesh spirit all that's attached now watch brother B says if he can get in there he's got your army routed right then you got five senses right five natural senses then we got five Spirit senses and notice that within all of those things if if reasoning we know how the prophet has taught us if reasoning agrees with the word of God okay then but if it's against the word of God I don't care how perfect it looks we walk away from it yes sir is that right this this comes to the scripture of Romans 8 that there is n nor for no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not according to the flesh but they walk after the spirit and brother BR picks that up I believe in Acts of the Holy Spirit he said if the doctor says and gives you a report that you can't get well and this situation he said well that's what the report says he said but when the spirit says you're coming out of that then we no longer walk by the flesh we walk by the spirit we've received a direct substance word that we didn't make happen you realize every Revelation we've got it a us that's pulled it down Revelation that's come for the healing in your body even Revelation that's come for the new birth you didn't pull it down I didn't pull it down even situations you're facing oh I fasted I no you have to understand you can't Merit that that is sovereignly given by almighty God it's sovereignly given it's not anything we work ourselves up into and I'm just going to go speak the word and you're going to fall flat on your face you've got to wait for an inspiration to come from God and that doesn't mean that I wait around and oh Lord I I Lord you don't you don't love me I I you know you usually reveal you no no no sometimes God wants to see are we going to stand up and begin to mature or are we going to stay down there in a way it's got to be my way or the highway you've always done it like this or are we going to trust him in the face of every situation even when it isn't happening or coming the same way I will trust in him hallelu my my my my if you're memory the prophet said if your imaginations if your conscience anything disagrees with what's on the inside get rid of it amen anybody ever probably everybody's cleaned house some of you went through everybody got a junk drawer no out in the kitchen I think every house got that what do you do with this put in the drawer what you do lay it over there but then you know what so everybody starts laying things around there then eventually somebody gets the wise idea to clean it we're going to empty that drawer out you know coupons from back when George Washington cross the Delaware all these things are just forgotten about you know over time cuz we're creatures of have we just kind of I don't want to worry about that right now I don't even think about that who cares about pizza maybe we'll give Pizza you know somebody and you just look at and all of a sudden you start going through it what do you do when you go through it you discard the things that are of no value and let me tell you something if there is anything that presents itself to you that takes down the value that God himself has spoken over your life and placed into your life I say get rid of it you have the word of a prophet that says discard it shred it burn it get rid of [Applause] itall Lord oh my then brother BR said what you got then you got a solar system oh Hallelujah he give God can set the stars in order and said hang there till I call on you they stay there there's nothing going to move them when God can get a man in his hands till his senses conscience everything cleaned out until it stands with God behind it in the spirit there's not a devil in the world can poke a doubt in there where's in there that Soul cuz doubts can come in your spirit come on I I'll get to the words of the Prophet you know I've already read to you quotes already before but here is job here was job even in this situation here was David now see we could take well job and David you know they Brother Sam they didn't have the Holy Ghost like we had but here was Paul a man who had the Holy Ghost like you and I had it let's take the Lord Jesus he Hebrews 5:7 when it came down to him to go to Calvary the Bible said he was heard in that he feared woo was he fearing where he was standing with his father not at all see that's what's important is that that fear is not in you is that you know where you're standing with God like the Hebrew children they knew where they were standing with God I don't know what's going to come out of this ver Daniel didn't know what was going to come out of that dying Lion's Den but he knew where he was standing with God that's the most important thing don't let the enemy try to worry you for an answer I got to have an answer for this I got to have an answer for this I got to have an answer for this don't let the devil that's a de listen you are not supposed to clown for the devil you don't owe him no answer that even includes your own mind your own taking we have the answer God he's alive he's the same yesterday today and forever he's the god of his word but notice how the devil he'll come around and say you don't feel any better probably nobody's ever heard that your conscience has even gone to that I I want it to stay gone don't you right I want it to stay gone to that you know that that's your and I's responsibility so that those Gates stay in a place our lives to where when things come about in Satan cuz he'll come around he did it to the Lord Jesus over and over he would come to the prophet over and over he would even tell the prophet you're nothing but a bluff you think he if he told the prophet that you don't think he's going to come around for you and I amen but you see here's here's the approach to it Lord help me to stay strong in you be strong in the Lord not in myself not in how many good days I've strung together be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might oh my your conscience has gone to that the flu is so clear it shouts Hallelujah the outlets blow a whistle glory to God it shines out just as clean and clear for the word of God to work through the power of God that's the main thing I read this scripture to you before 2 Timothy chapter 1 ver7 for God hath not given us the spirit of fear right but of power and of love and of a sound mind that's the spirit that God's given us but not the spirit of fear watch how brother Bram will say this in God's way that's been made for us he said the worst thing the devil can put upon you is fear Now watch how he says this the worst thing he can put upon you is fear if you even had a Cancer and didn't fear and believe God would heal you you would be in too bad a shape God can take care of that if you're sick whatever it is if you don't fear so fear is one of the worst things that Satan can place upon the person the prophet never said cancer is the worst thing fear is so circumstances will come you see Satan loves to exploit times in our life when situations happen does take for example somebody gets in a car accident then it becomes where just natural if you start thinking about that oh my goodness I don't know if I should let so and so go and I don't I tell you what you just stay on this road you do this and do that and and we we may do that but then we have to come to realize wait a minut here there's a part of wisdom and there's a part of it I trusted God all those other times before why am I going to stop trusting him now right that's good see it it CS us to look back on you say well how does that happen Brother Sam well it's not like a light switch you see remember he is the strength of our life it's not our mind over matter you know what I'm just going to turn this kind of thinking off no that's not what it is it's called casting it out so if it's something that needs to be cast out it takes a stronger Force than that Spirit that's there is that right many scripture we go on on that now notice brother R says I've tried to prove by the scripture that the man that's born again of the kingdom of God has nothing to fear you're absolutely safely secure in Jesus Christ think of on through the scripture he would say you you're you know you have been you have been brought to me no man can come come to me except it were given to my father and I will in know why cast you out you're you're you're here in the palm of my hand you cannot be plucked out you've been sealed until the day of redemption see over and over it's assurances the word are you hearing me tonight the word does not come to destabilize you the word comes to stabilize you and it comes to make known if there's ground that you're standing on that you feel unstable well get off that ground let's get on stable ground there's Solid Ground And there's no other ground as solid as the word of the Living God there's no other place more sure than that of Jesus Christ he is a sure Foundation my thank you Lord the Bible says in 1 John 4:8 there is no fear in love no fear in love but perfect love Now watch how this goes but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment now this love that we're talking about is the love of God it's the spirit of God remember Paul Jude would write it Paul would write over and over put on bows of mercy and the elect of God sink into Paul would even write in 1 Corinthians 13 expressing Love Is This Love Is This Love is not that love is this and I'm sure probably every one of us have read it when you go through that scripture you go through the scripture oh oh it's not this and Lord I I I Lord I you know oh man I've got to you know I need to be more patient no it's not it's not trying to mimic the attributes of love it's just realizing Lord I need more of it you know what I need in my life I need more of it you see that takes it away from you and I trying to do it when we look at the word to realize if we just say Lord I need more of it this is why Jude could say keep yourselves in the love of God Amen is that right keep yourselves in it we we need more of the love of God even as God's love would work to call somebody in Repentance then his love works it moves even deeper sanctification then into the baptism of the Holy Ghost and keeps on working all the way into maturity but watch what it's doing there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear because fear hath torment he that fearth is not made perfect or complete in love now when we think of that this is where God wants you and I to reside in our life to where as we said over and over here tonight is that where we're standing we know where we're standing with God and there is no fear of where we're standing with him that's where job was at job had no fear of where he was standing with God but evidently job had got into his mind of this is this could happen and it begin to dwell on it remember what I read to you the prophet said his fear is what made it happen his fear made it happen you let somebody go many many examples I have here where things have taken place in the medical realm and so forth even a man who thought he was going to die thought here it been you know a bullet had come in you know and and you know and somehow it had grazed him or or been a part of his clothing or whatever more and he thought he was fatally going to die he and the doctor was really you know looking at it but there was no blood he he wasn't bleeding at all but he in his mind he thought man I I've been shot I I'm going to die and and when he's taken off his clothes the doctor hears this on the ground and he sees a flattened bullet he picks up this flattened bullet now the man's heart rate everything else was going haywire at this time cuz he believed he was going to die although he had no wounds or blood coming out of of him but as soon as the doctor said here's the bullet and you don't there's no wounds around at all everything reversed well what changed that you see substance of fear is what caused his body to start to act in a certain way even where there's been other individuals that I could give you examples of things that was not even wrong with them but they believed it and they died why fear but think about faith though as soon as it was shown to him this is not what's happened look at this bullet there's nothing wrong with you now as soon as that happened that substance overrode that a fear what did it do it cast out that fear but how much more you and I even as Believers where perfect love can cast out all fear the devil might have you looking at a situation that looks so Bleak but just let God step in amen come on just let God step in on brother BR says you're always scared he said that's where the church is at you're always scared it's not going to happen and that's the reason it don't happen but love will cast love cast out fear and when you got love fear is gone but as long as you got fear love cannot Operate Now I want you to watch this statement as long as you got fear love cannot operate can love be there absolutely and fear can be there but love can't operate let me refer to the rest of this quote brother R goes in to talk about the bull right after this statement the bull he's walking in there he doesn't know that bull is there so he's not walking in there by faith I'm going to walk across this pasture no no he doesn't know that Bull's there but that bull remember had just killed a black man brother Bram talks about it it was there in the news but brother Bram didn't even know that bull was in there it had been sold moved from another place and all of a sudden this bull raises up and starts coming to him now brother Ram Will Tell Us in different plac of the message when he talks about this bull talks about the Hornets remember the Hornets in his backyard right the maniac you'll find it over and over in the message find the different accounts and brother br will say when those three different things rose up there was a fear that set in because the man was able to back it up the bull had already killed another man the Hornets could kill this is Brother Ram's own words he said I was afraid aren't you glad that brother brandom was not a show off aren't you glad he didn't say bless God I'm the messenger of the age I'm a real believer it's like I heard when Brother Carlos stood up here and told his little bit of his testimony on Vietnam he said these guys that get up and they talk about all these super stories don't believe them I've heard that from a lot of other veterans too he said we were hugging dirt to get out there were firing going on all around us you see sometimes when you hear things like that you know you just kind of look at say ah no this isn't just right at all you know it a't right because when we look at the prophet fear had come around him but brother Brown will make this statement I've always marveled at this brother Brown says at that moment he said I chose to think different thoughts I'm not going to die as a coward I've taken God at his word all the way through he said I'm not going to die as a coward I'll stand here right here in a challenge to that and you know what what was that was that brother brandom's own will that was The Sovereign Grace of God friends that's what it means to walk with God it isn't you or me Conjuring things up or Mar in a word from God it's just staying in fellowship with him and just like he lifted Enoch and like he'll lift you one of these days he'll lift you in situations and give you the strength you have need ofall watch out brother B we just I just read this as long as you got fear love can't operate that bull was getting ready to charge him and then it ran on up just like The Maniacs spit in his face and never you you know the stories but watch how brother Ram when he describes how that bull it got to his place it ran up and it just dead stopped what did it run into it sure didn't run into the genealogy of brandom it didn't run into the genealogy of brandom it didn't run into that DNA but it ran into I'll just say it to you plain it ran into the almighty God that's shouldn't be any power Marvel to us the Bible said the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him is that right so it ran so it was able brother R was able to S by God's grace take the grace to that he could come into a situation where he was there in that of love how many remembers brother Ram said over and over he said oh I wish I could live in that all the time is that right so when you go to reading about love don't don't read down through in first Corin Ians 13 and just start feeling all condemned remember there is an atmosphere to live in there is things listen for you to even forgive somebody to have patience and whatever more that is not you handling the word that is the word living its life through you that's right Hallelujah sure God came down and became tangible but he did not love you and I with human love he loved us with his undying love and he went to Calvary for you and I It's Supernatural Hallelujah watch how brother Ram says the very last line of this after this about the bull he said it was love go to that next one Brianna please it was love that took the fear away and God seen me through I don't know about you but I've been there I had been faced with Bulls I had been faced with Maniacs but I've been in situations where God came down and took the fear away and seen me through anybody else a witness on that God came down and seen me through situation we give testimony but God stepped in but God stepped in amen so to think of it of how that when when love itself you see when love is there when fear is gone then Faith becomes perfect let me just kind of move through some of these things of you know and this is where we if we can get get scare away brother BR would say place if we can get the scare away then love will come into its place and all of these these great these great uh placements remember when uh ji gyrus was on his way back to the house he had went he had persevered Faith had drove him to get the master it was revealed to him that he he is the Messiah is so good is that right that is so good but on the way back he gets him because he knows the word can handle the situation that's what his faith is saying you think it wasn't fearful no doubt many others had died many other children had died from whatever it was but there was something that took a hold of him and now is there on their way back to the house somebody comes out and says hey you don't even need to trouble him no more she's gone verse 50 of Luke 8 but Jesus heard it and answered him and said fear not believe only and she shall be made whole there he had a substance Revelation what was he doing before walking by faith but he was not revealed this is how it's going to be this is how going to come out but he had a revelation what I seen him do for others my situation is no different he walked and approached the word and on his way back walking with the word that was there to handle the situation fear wanted to come around him you see that fear didn't even say oh and then it's somebody oh you know somebody go to talk about the boss and they run out and there fear didn't stop it came right up to where he was and the master standing right beside him Satan don't have no respect no matter how long we've served no matter how many times the the power of God has moved on our life no matter how much of a change in our life Satan will try to come back I'm not talking about your soul when your Soul's been sealed and the love of God is entered there it doesn't matter where you are you can be an all Lion's Den you can be in a fiery furnace you are still a Christian you are still a genuine believer cuz you've got genuine substance faith in what the word has made you my my my my I feel like dancing right now in Mark chapter 11 let me try to try to bring this down here in Mark chapter 11 this is these are very key scriptures we're talking about with fear you know sometimes when we're let me just read the scripture and then we'll speak here a moment remember they're watching at this tree that the Lord Jesus had spoken he cursed the life of the tree and he it was dried up from its roots and Peter beheld it that it was withered up and verse 22 of Mark 11 Jesus said have faith in God so he was pointing him what did it was have faith in God so the life was speaking contrary now notice remember the Bible tells us it had leaves on it but it wasn't even the time of figs brother Ram takes us into the message hidden life he said see he said it was all this blowing and shaking he said but it didn't have the fruit fruit on it and he said when God comes to inspect his church he don't want to just see leaves blowing he wants to see fruit and so when the Lord Jesus came there it wasn't even the time of figs but you see something was bearing it was it was not moving in the right context and so what did he do speak against it I'm glad that he speaks to things that can be going on in my mind in my spirit my life I'm glad that he can speak to and said hey wait a minute that's that that that's how to season that's not in line with my word so what does he do address the life or the spirit that's there notice he says in verse 23 whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he sayth shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses so it comes down brother Bram would go over this remember this was a scripture that brother Bram said it stumped me for the longest time he said you know I just had thought about well yeah the prophets and how they would speak and when the word would come to him and those things but how that the Lord met him out in the woods and each of the times he met him because it wasn't just once where squirrels were created but each of those times he brought him back into that portion of scripture brother BR said I marveled upon that scripture for so long until the Lord began to reveal to me the prophets had the word in them and they spoke according to that word that was in them because it comes to say if ye say not not if he says if you say to this mountain so there must be some something come to drop in our hearts now watch what watch what Mark 11 is about Mark 11 is not us going out and just I'm going to speak this mountain out of existence it's about a sovereign word dropping in our lives that's so good this is why sometimes we've maybe went and we've been defeated because we thought well I I spoke to that mountain but first of all it's got to be a channel that's clear and that's open is that right the prophet just lays that out and I have heard but now I see a 1965 it's he place takes that whole message on job and dealing with being a clear open channel for inspiration to fall in and when we're dealing with that we know in order to be that kind of a channel where our lives has got to be lined up with the word and Satan is always busy to try if he can to put some little kink in our armor this is why the Lord Jesus would say when you stand praying forgive so what's he telling us faith is based on forgiveness that's what he's dealing with so he's dealing with all of he's not making it as though well well you know there's something you can't do anything wrong no when you when there is something that's done wrong conviction comes to your heart let's get into the City of Refuge let's make it right let's lift it off and put it back on the accuser notice do we want to be certain of God so if there's anything anything this is why listen to me very closely I'm just going to try to close on this point this is why when we're dealing with fear we're dealing with anxiety when I've worked with things whether it's in prayer lines or I I pray and ask God lord is there something that's there that's out of line you say why because listen in the presence of the Angel of the lord we can pray and that thing will lift but if there's something there that invites it back it'll come right back it's got to have the strength there to keep it away and remember we've got to stay fortified in the word Jesus said go and sin disbelieve no more right they said stay in the company of Believers is that right these are things God's not going to do for us we've got to do our healing means more to us My Liberty in my mind way means more to me so I'm going to keep my mind I'm going to keep company in the right things that believe the same way BR says it like this and what Dost thou hear if there's something in your life that condemns you he says you better make that right he says now you just can't operate right the Holy Spirit can't deal with you when you got prejudiced selfishness and all those things in you the Holy Spirit can never bless you now watch how he says this you might get some intellectual emotions some work up but see it's not a channel it's not an open channeled so you see where Satan's desire is to try to do what he can to clog that channel it's kind of like what they did in the days of Isaac where you had the Philistines and different ones the wells that Abraham dug they filled them up are you with me the Philistines filled them up kept throwing rocks down them rocks down them when Isaac his day came he said we're going and dig them out those places that God took our father are still the places that God wants us to be where the enem is trying to stop up the wells of God's word of real repentance of the baptism of the Holy Ghost those Wells of Our Father Abraham when a seven sealed book has come open those Wells have been emptied out those are still our god-given places and places where the enemy would want to try to fill up in your life f up complexes fill up fear fill up uncon un unforgiveness well so and so offended me and this what that's doing is it's blocking off a channelise Lord watch how brother Bram takes this here he says right the very next statement he said see what job said the things that I feared worse is come upon me see what was it it was something that was there that allowed that to attack if there's something that's unconfessed sin if there's something that's there if there's some sort of a fear or Scare that's what the word comes to do is to drive that out it comes to drive it out oh Lord how we need the word of the Living God how we need the word being alive in our services powerful a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and more than that Lord we want hearts that even if I've got some things that are clogged up I do not want to hold back because of stones that I have in my Channel I want those stones out because that's what he's come to do is to free us from All Fears all doubts because that brings paralysis let's stand watch how brother bam says this goes on to say in this quote he says you want to be above everything where there's no condemnation or nothing to you you got to live like real Christians live in the presence of God live daily hourly momently say nothing do nothing go nowhere let it be Christlike everything you do all your actions God requires us absolutely to abstain from the world and separation now I know that I'm reading I'm reading this to Believers we're Believers here tonight but I realize these statements what I've just read to live above everything live in the presence of God live daily hourly momently that's a battle you realize even we could pray 24 hours a day seven days a week and still have grudges offenses absolutely you know why because we've never got Before the Throne the prophet said as soon he said when you'll really get Before the Throne he said then you go to seeing what maybe that other brother has been through that other situation sometimes we wonder well I'm praying I'm praying but sometimes we stay so Earthbound in our prayers listen friends that's not it's not us it's not us trying to but it's to realize Lord when I'm coming into prayer I the real reality of prayer is for me to be able to look at somebody else like you look at them I tell you how I pray Lord I want to so love your people the way you love them over and over I ask God that I want to love him the way you love him I want to love him the way you love me brother Samuel you don't you don't feel you do no I I believe I do I I've got that I I believe that but I need more of it I need more of it because you see within this life sometimes you never lose your experience but sometimes we just need a renewing we need a refilling you know what a renewing a refilling a Revival you know what it does it washes out all the trash washes out all of the accumulated offenses and things that's just mounted up you know it just starts drifting down and hanging up on this and hanging up on this pretty soon you start hanging up on everything and I tell you I I don't want to be too big to go before God and say Lord I'm wrong if there's something I've done wrong I I I I want it to be right that's my prayer that's that's my prayer that's that's where I search I couldn't stand here and even have the confidence to stand here and preach that's why it's always blown my mind I I've never since just a a young boy even beforehand and then even starting to preach I I never could fathom in my mind how that sometimes you hear about these things where individuals go off and they do things and they go out here and live all kinds of immortally and then get up before the people I never understood that you say brother Sammy don't you believe in the Forgiveness of God I do believe in the Forgiveness of God but I believe in the full Deliverance I believe in that but when you see things it's just not it's just it's a Continuum I've looked at how could they have that confidence when I'm standing here no matter when I'm standing here when I'm in the office no matter what situation when I'm with my family and I've got to address situations in the home I don't have to feel his presence to know that he's there I know he's there he said he'd never leave me nor forsake me is that right right so when it comes to a situation dad this problem's rose up Dad this situation Dad we need to have prayer here I want to be able to stand there where my conscience is clear no condemnation and be able to stand there with the word Lord knowing I've done all that you've told me to do amen not anything on my account or any bragging but listen it's being a channel that he can move down in that's what God wants out of us friends that's that's the real victory in our life is living as a channel you're Victory is not confined to this building that where all of a sudden it has to be a service day and then all of a sudden we we're we got Victory no God wants to give you a deeper Victory than that he'll bring you Victory after victory in Services that's true he'll help you he'll encourage you but you've got to remember take that and continue to move on with god oh Lord take anything if there's anything that would hinder in my life I don't care what it is Lord I want to be a channel where the inspiration of the the Holy Ghost can drop into offended sure we've all been offended and we've offended other people but God let me have the same Grace for my brother my sister family whoever it is that you have for me Lord oh God help us anybody want to go with me before the throne say Lord I Want More Lord amen I want more of the love of God I want more like I described that months ago I think it was if I took a full hand Cube whole handfuls of ice cubes and you had a cup up here and I dropped them ice cubes in that cup you know what'll happen that water will go splash right out of that cup that's how I want the love of God to come in because the love of God will cast out fear it'll displace things that's not of God lord I just want I need a fresh baptism of the love of God a fresh refilling let's go to De prayer Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we're standing Lord God in need of you tonight once again Lord you come by way of your word to examine our lives and how thankful we are for it Lord Oh Our flesh Lord our flesh does not rejoice in that but Lord that inner man that Soul it hears the voice of Liberty it matches it matches as a son or daughter of God we were meant to live free Lord sometimes Lord with circumstances of life things can accumulate sometimes un known to us job even though he could say the things which I greatly feared he never said this in previous chapters this is only the third chapter but it was there it was something Lord that he had dwelt on a thought and allowed fear to attach although job had received in a previous [Music] chapter bragging on him and Lord the truth be known you didn't change your bragging on job you were the one that called the testimony meeting and invited the devil and bragged on him called him a perfect man not because he was perfect in his own self not because he did he was free and didn't make mistakes no he found his perfection in the word of the Lord in the sacrifice and that's where he rested but circumstances of life now Lord maybe there's Hearts here tonight whether here visibly or streaming maybe they've Lord never experienced that of the love of God down in their soul where Lord God that the fear of where they're standing with you has been dismissed I pray Heavenly Father May Lord God like your Prophet says at the end of the message the token oh Hallelujah Oh Glory when he asked the people Lord how many would want to receive that token then he said oh he said you feel he said just make everything right if there's anything in your life that's out of the line just make it right and he says oh he says now you feel that lovely Spirit coming in here that's the sweetness of the Holy Spirit he's wooing to Your Heart In A Love Affair it's love that does it oh he said just receive him now Lord Jesus Grant it tonight Lord and Grant it Lord for every heart that's here Lord that like mine Lord I want a fresh refilling [Music] Lord Lord sometimes we get to looking at the wrong things sometimes Lord we hear things or feel different symptoms and we can go to start reading something and all of a sudden we start entertaining and thoughts can come Lord Jesus you never said that they wouldn't come but you told us to trust you Lord in God I will praise His word in the Lord I will praise His word Lord we want to say thank you Father thank you Lord for how that you have cared for our lives thank you Lord for how that throughout countless times maybe it's where your word has come and maybe you've anointed a man of God whether it's stood behind this pool pit or maybe in another meeting somewhere else maybe it's been listening to a message and that fear what wanted to reside and take hold was driven out maybe it was the coming of a Titus to us Lord I'm thankful for when Titus comes help us to be able to receive that kind of a comfort as well when you send to Titus oh it may not be by the name of Titus but it might be by the name of of one of my brothers or sisters Lord help us Lord to receive you in the form of one of our brothers or sisters Lord we love you I pray tonight Lord if there be any fear any thoughts maybe there's a a diagnosis maybe there's a doctor's report that's right now Lord I pray Heavenly Father Lord as every heart and every life would be clear Lord we want to stand upon your word like the Hebrew children like Daniel Lord God we want to stand upon your word because you are faithful Lord the father I pray that as your word has come Lord you would lead us to this point in this service may we take Lord God the things that you've said Lord God where the clarity of the spirit of God has moved down to cast those things Lord from our life holds or anything Lord that would want us to remain or to try to occupy but now may the spirit of [Music] God dismissing every fear Lord Lord where Satan has stood over him to try to as he would come with that fear and then want to turn around and condemn them for being afraid but Lord You've exposed him and our hearts are settled on you whereas our army at one point was routed it's no longer routed we have heard the bugling call that says go forward my son go forward my son my daughter Grant it Lord I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen don't you love him oh my I just appreciate good pleas through it all through it all yes slow it down I've learned to trust in Jesus oh I've learned to trust in God oh through it all oh through it all i' learned to depend upon his word well I've had many tears and sorrows and I have questions for tomorrow have times I didn't know right from wrong but in every situation oh God his blessed come that my trial only come to make me strong oh yes singing through it all through it all oh through it all yes I learn to trust in Jesus learn to trust in God oh through it all oh through it all yes forever to depend upon his word brother R tells us when he raised and I referred to that to you and brother R will say it over and over again he'll say when he raised he told us over and over fear not would say fear not little flock it is the Father's will to give you the kingdom brother Bram said even when he came to them that day and began to make known the promise concerning their lives of the Holy Ghost he said they could go rejoicing not fearing that it was a certain promise God promised it for them brother Bram said the same way for your healing same way for Deliverance holy ghost on and on he takes that whole part within it and how they could go and they could begin to Rejoice because the word had told them fear not see the word will never take from you your Redemptive rights but the devil will always try to talk you out of them but your Redemptive rights the thing about it is he might be able to try to come and talk to you and he might get you thinking about things in your mind one thing he can't change he can't change what God Said and he can't change that you're a Believer he can't change that sir so coming into the presence of God oh it takes us just a moment you real wait a minute that wasn't being quoted to me correctly that wasn't being said right well it was a quote right out of the message yeah but it was who was handling it aren't you thankful to the Lord aren't you thankful to the presence of God Amen oh through it all yes through it all i' learn to trust in Jesus yes I have learned to trust in God through it all through it all through it it all yes I've learned to depend upon
