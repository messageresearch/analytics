invitation a welcoming Spirit that'll welcome him amen and that's what we want we want him to move in a very special way here this morning once again I'm going ask you to have your seats and uh brother Malachi would like to come and like to address you as an assembly and as our brother is coming just real quickly I need your attention out there on the prayer request table there is a sheet where it has everything as far as you writing your name address if we're if you're not on the address sheet if you changed an address we'd like to have it updated some of you I know that are not on the email list uh different ones in order to the notes that you see here uh those are sent out some of you write down your notes and things like that and that's wonderful as well but it's just always there for you so that you have that you can always pull it down what's what is displayed up here here right off of the email the copy and um so that that paper when you when you have that just have it completed just return it uh there to the library you can even hand it to one of the deacons or so forth but it's right out there in the prayer request table if you will um just do that would that be okay now we're not going we're not telemarketers we're not going to put you on a list and call you for we're not doing that okay so Amen brother Malachi e amen let's stand and go right into the word if we could let's go to Second Corinthians chapter 7 verse 12 the scripture we're getting ready to read it's kind of like at the end of things that we will I want to continue to work with here this morning but this is a result that Paul has witnessed in the lives of the people in that how that they have received correction and see the fruits of it of how that it has worked in their lives remember when Paul himself when he when Paul is writing this letter this is what's very important when Paul deals with the things that he has written and how he has addressed the church he's addressed it as father in the gospel that's very significant that's just not a title it shows that there in order for True correction to come there must be relationship if there's no relationship then all correction is is government are you with me so there must be that relationship so those words are not just words that are loose there when Paul would write concerning being a a father to them in the gospel and we'll look at some things how Paul will address this in verse 12 of second Corinthians 7 let's look at how Paul is writing this is the result of of the discipline and the correction that has been received wherefore though I wrote unto you I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong remember the the the young man who was living with his uh uh stepmother I believe it was he was living with with her and thou how that it was to where Paul had admonished the church church we were reading last week to address that situation and to attend to it Paul is letting what Paul is making known here is the motive that's been behind the discipline all along so he says not for his cause that had done the wrong so Paul's Focus was not just upon the wrong nor for his cause that suffered wrong but that our care for you in the sight of God might might appear unto you wow so you mean love if I have love and all the love is is Teddy Bears and chocolates and it doesn't balance with the other part with correction that's right that that's not real love no you're only manifesting a portion or a part of Love see it's got to be a balance there's a David said thy rod and thy staff they comfort me not just the rod but the staff as well so there's two parts Hearts within it so therefore he goes on to say in verse 13 therefore we were comforted in your comfort yay and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus because his Spirit was refreshed by you all for if I have boasted anything to him of you I am not ashamed but as we spake all things to you in truth even so our boasting which I I made before Titus is found a truth wow so Paul was actually bragging on him y'all with me Paul was actually bragging on the people yeah he didn't hate them correction he didn't dislike them what's he bragging about he's not bragging uh just about them but about how that they have responded to the word of the Lord that's Paul's Comfort that's his comfort that's what he's saying I've boasted to Titus of you all and you know what what I said to Titus he saw and what he saw refreshed him and when he was so refreshed he came back to me and I was refreshed and his inward affection is more abundant toward you whilst he rememberthe of you all how with fear and trembling ye received him I Rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things amen may God bless the reading of his word as you're being seated I want to just in in looking at this here there's a part that when we're when we're looking at it here within the in the scriptures there are are things that as we're going through it I want you to understand something very clearly and I'm speaking to you as your pastor this morning I want you to understand very clearly that even the course of how that the Lord took us last week through the word and even where we are at this week we are not on a sid track we are not on a side note we're right in line we've been looking at we've been looking at motives if those of you whove been paying attention to the Thursday services and the Sunday Services most of those things that I'm drawing from is where the spirit of the Lord just from about a month and a half ago begin quickening to my heart the message that the prophet preached called Hebrews chapter 7 part one and all things that I've been dealing with on the midweek as well as in here that's where the spirit of God has so inspired those things with motives I say that not to approve it but I say it in a manner so that you can see that when God when we're looking at discipline and we're looking at these things that we understand is how the Lord was taking us last week is that when the Bible speaks to us in the Book of Proverbs and it says that foolishness is bound in the heart of the child and the rod driveth it far from him so the rod is the instrument to remove the foolishness that's Bound in the heart that foolishness is is is there there and it must be removed that's a principle all of these parts that God gives to us even as parents and in other parts God does never he never says anything whereby that he's just saying it if he says it it must be a part of who he is and it must be identified in his characteristics meaning that it's not just something he's telling me to do and he doesn't do it himself you understand he is his word so this the the the Bible itself is not just something we look at as a instruction manual it's the Living God who comes down and this is not just a book of History it is a book of Prophecy because it is the same spirit of God who has moved down Through the Ages that brings the word to a live and a living reality I want you to think of this very closely because when you when we're looking at these things that some things I just want to lay in and really just kind of further teach on on these parts of it in that true M the true motive of discipline is that there is a real real responsibility that we must understand as a body of Believers but also as parents as a pastor grandparents and so forth all across the board the the the reality is is that you know when we look at these scriptures that I want to move back into in just a moment nothing within God's word is to be taken lightly nor is it to be applied lightly we don't apply things simply because it's black and white we must apply it with the love of God by the leadership of the Holy Holy Spirit if not then it becomes the government of Christianity you understand the prophet said we do not make converts out of the government of Christianity what is it by the New Birth the change of heart so when we're looking at it it's God God's desire is not that you or me would walk down walk around in a sense of trepidation like God's going to get me God's going to get me when you walk in that manner you won't do nothing that's why God had to address Joshua in chapter 1 he didn't want him walk around in fear when God said fear not it wasn't so much of the inhabitants of the land it was your own inabilities I want you to know Joshua I know your inabilities but I'm not called you based on your abilities I've called you because I placed that gift within you where you won't trust in your abilities you'll trust in my leadership it would make sense for God when he is wanting a purpose for us we look at in the carinal it would make sense that God would call someone in the days of Noah that was a master ship Builder he didn't call someone who was a master ship Builder he called a farmer Hallelujah it wasn't because of his skills that's why Peter said you don't speak according to your ability speak according to the ability and that whereby is by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven to minister the word so when we're looking at these parts in the word of God God doesn't want walking around in a in a fear of trepidation but God's desire is a fear and a holy fear which is a reverence it's a reverence that's what God desires ties is reverence so when we look at this it all it applies across the board when we're looking at it I'm going to work with some things here at first that are dealing with things that even of how that we work as parents even as a pastor as a church one thing that you find and I was ending up with this last week that we find in God's word in the very first chapter of the Bible God has boundaries discipline without boundaries is not discipline it's called confusion so boundaries must also be consistent so you know what to expect see see Satan wants to mess with boundaries God set boundaries in the Garden of Eden but Satan came in through the vehicle the tool of the serpent he wasn't slithering in a tree the Bible said he was a serpent a most subtle Beast not serpent beast of the field and he was able to speak what did he do he took the boundaries that God had said in the word and he said the boundaries don't apply surely God will not what did it do it brought confusion and confusion itself here she gives in boundaries God has always set his boundaries are clear his boundaries are his word his boundaries are him because we're not baptized into a church 1 Corinthians 12 says by one Spirit we are baptized into one body Hallelujah So within that we are in his house it's under his administration under his direction we are his responsibility so he has set the boundaries and I'll tell you this boundaries themselves understand boundaries are not something that you just look at and say oh oh you know like it's electric fence or something boundaries are security job said he set a hedge around about me the Bible says in the in the book of uh in the book I believe it's zechar a wall of fire around me that's boundaries Hallelujah boundaries are a comfort amen God cared so much about boundaries he said I said the Moon the Moon will watch over the boundaries the sea can only go so far what happens when the sea or something's troubled and it goes beyond the boundaries chaos destruction God has set the boundaries what causes that what is the typhoons all those things results of does God permit it God permits it but it is of Satan are you with me God all listen God is over he permits those things judgments and all those things to come but if but in in the new Heaven and new earth when we go into the Millennium and then the new Heaven and new earth there will be no storms yes sir because remember he had Justified baptized this Earth in Noah's day he dropped his blood at Calvary to sanctify it and then it's to receive his baptism of fire the Holy Ghost where he will sat down upon it and just as he did in your soul and what happens when he does that in your soul there's no more storms no more typhoons in your soul Hallelujah why because the seal is there the seal is God's boundaries that God has set there you cannot come over this bloodline you cannot cross the token you cannot cross the bloodline that's God's strength so boundaries consistent boundaries and they must be consistent it's just like you know what we understand with consistency I I I I I if this is a standard that has been placed within your home and the standard you hold to it and and whe whatever it might be that that you would you would call out maybe they know it's it you know crying and putting themselves in the floor whatever more if they get corrected on that on Monday and they do it on Tuesday guess what Tuesday correction again why it's driving it out of the heart you understand it's consistency we might be here three hours a day is that all right I'm not going to keep you but I want you to see listen friends sometimes we're not aware you we're not maybe as aware as we ought to be that this that the prince of power of the air it's it tampers with all of these principles to where you have things that and and and and I I don't mean anything any disregards to any parents or anyone whether it's streaming or whatever more but the reality is is that that is a common principle on consistency but you can see how the things within this world in this earth the way things have come to and got to a place it's like parents don't know what to do what do I do what do I do why is this taking place why is that going on there is a balance because remember it's not it's not to bring fear to where when you walk in the room oh gosh is he coming oh no okay let's go ahead and keep acting the way we're acting you know how I was in school they got to look out you know at the doorway some of y'all you know what I'm talking about you got to look out at the doorway and then the rest of everybody else is doing their thing but then when all of a here it comes and you can hear it coming down the hallway I mean I don't know how many times I can hear it coming down the hallway you can hear it sometimes i' have to stand outside my door and chuckle oh God help me help me Lord Jesus before I walk in there I know what you're doing God does it because you know why that's why listen Christianity just by taking the government of the principles and the laws of Christianity without a birth it only makes you a good person when it's Church time you can only stay as good as long as you adhere to the laws but once you had a new birth and it's written on the inside then you not walking by an outside government you're walking by an internal governance that's why Paul said our conversation that word conversation is our conduct our constitution of the Commonwealth is in heaven that's why Jesus can say now you see the son of man yet here he is and yet he's ascended up here he is on Earth you're walking in heaven when you have been quickened you're seated in Heavenly places and yet walking here on Earth and you're under the administration of the Holy Ghost in your life it don't matter where you go you're a Christian everywhere you go the token shows wherever you go I'm talking about the seal the blood so when we see it the principle of the scripture there's there principles in Scripture that deal with hate now when we look at the term hate uh when we we're thinking of it in terms of scripture when when here when God is speaking in the Book of Malachi Paul picks it up in the Book of Romans when he says uh Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated you would look at it and you say how can God hate but it's not the kind of hate that you think of that's associated with Satan that term hate is L less are you with me God detests sin are you with me now let's be clear here God hates hates sin but he loves The Sinner are you with me the word hate is lovess so let me read the scripture to you and I I I've got a but I've got a question first of all I want you to think about the question is it possible for a parent or parents to hate their children I know some of you look at me like man you tricking me I'm asking you a question I'm ask you a question I'm asking you a question not to trick you I'm ask you a question to think because I'm getting ready to say something or rather is it possible for a parent or parents to love in a lesser way than they should Proverbs 1324 he that spareth his Rod what's it say hateth his son now this isn't my word this is God's word so is it possible for a parent or so forth that they could have a lesser love or in terms of how God says it hate their children sure this is according to God's word y'all believe this right some of y'all got deer in the headlights and I know this is teaching I know I know I'm teaching but I I want us to look and I want us to look into the depth of not just looking uh just in the scope of church or parent pastor but look into the depths of our life but he that loveth him chasteneth him be times if every time you're with me or I'm with you I'm correcting you guess what you ain't going to want to be with me very long that's right and all the parents said help me Jesus those that have the teenagers help me Jesus you understand some of you that a little bit older you reserving that laugh you're like been there amen because what I what we're looking at discipline itself when we're talking about the rod it isn't always the belt the strap whatever it isn't it isn't always that discipline itself is a Living Image there can be things that are seen by the image and character of how you even conduct yourself and handle yourself that others can see that's why Paul could tell the the the older men speak to the younger men being sober minded in other things he told the older sisters they they were to speak to the younger sisters about certain things virtues and so forth he dealt with those things like that it chastening be times as as as often that is needed let me ask you this is it possible that that a parents love pastor's love a Church's love could be selfish is it Samuel love how could love be selfish when everything is about you abely Pastor says I'm not going to correct because I want them to keep coming wow wow I'm not going to do this because they might leave the church that's selfish love listen let me let me let me explain this friends everything that must be done must be done by the leadership of the Holy Spirit everything if if your application of the word is just simply letter you'll kill you'll kill it's got to be under his leadership because why the whole emphasis is is a that love from within to do what create an atmosphere are you with me the word spoken in the beginning in Genesis 1 didn't create more Darkness it dismissed the darkness so the word had an atmosphere in it of love it was the word that was needed but it created an atmosphere and brought separation so when we're looking at it sure I mean you know if if I want my boys man I want my boys to always think hi me but see you're you're fa to recognize that they think high of you or your girls or whomever they think high of you if you stay true to them they know when they're wrong and you don't tell them when they're wrong they know when they're wrong and you don't correct them it brings confusion when something goes wrong in school and all of a sudden you're running up to the principal's office and you're ready to rake somebody over the coals I'm right down where you're living right you're taking their word for it and you're ready to go to judgment first of all you don't even understand the situation but before that you haven't even prayed because you're going in there failing to represent Jesus Christ in the right way you have to be mindful of all of these things listen friends listen all of us have been around I taught with different things I taught with different needs taught with Ser so forth even in the teaching of the school the examples I used for I used there were situations of things that you know I I I've seen wrong I understand that but it doesn't make all wrong right you understand it doesn't make all wrong this is where we need discernment if there's things that you have from your past where there's things that as far as discipline was taken to such a place to where you're like I'm not going there with spanking I'll just deal with the Tantrums and timeouts what you need to do listen is ask the Lord say Lord give me the discernment and help me Teach Me Lord because he's given his word he'll teach you right and I don't believe that ought to ever be something that stops right my my my so love itself it's like you have the have the boy in the middle of the street how many times the prophet give you that example the person standing in the middle of the street what do you run out there and say now darling you love daddy right you do right you're going to love Daddy after this pow they're gone but you go and pull them out of the middle of the street why do you do that why would you why would you grab them by the arm and pulling that way because you love them you love their life why would you see a boat headed to toward the Falls do you just say be careful you got your life jackets on it's a it's a it's a bad fall this isn't a right to CER point this is reality friend let me say this to you and I say this just from my heart I tell you right now with parenting and everything else it's one I don't want to say just hardest jobs but I'll say it's one of those you stay on your knees and I don't mean that in a bad way I'm saying you're dealing with hearts and lives that God has entrusted to your responsibility when God gave the plans to Noah Noah was responsible to pray over those plans I've said this before if you think Noah just for one moment if you think Noah just simply just walked out there with the pattern the plan said oh this goes here this goes here and we get this here we get this here you miss it how many times that Noah had to get down on his knees and pray so I don't read that in the scripture but he's a man God revealed himself to a man and he's trying he's looking to God to find direction yes how many times he had to move and asking God God how do I make this turn how do I make this corner how do I approach this see he had he had the pattern in front of him but he's looking to the one who gave the pattern to bring him in those places and Junctions of time so when we look at it look how many times that Paul would write in letters to the different churches when Paul would write to those churches whether it's Galatians thessalonica Corinth the Philippi all of those churches there are things that if in any way if you begin to compare those churches in any manner as saying they no way I go to the church of Corinth I go to the church of Ephesians yes sir the Ephesians were deeper they were so deep they didn't even know how to treat their wives woo woo come on somebody they don't get hung up with some one quote balance out the whole thing there was none of those churches that were perfect but in every one of them God loved them and God had a man on the scene who had a desire with God's love fervently burning in his heart for those people you had people that came into the church of Corinth they didn't care about nobody they wanted to try to bring Conformity to their own ways bringing disturbances in the church so Paul come right back in on election and laid it right out and let them know you're not justified by works you're justified by faith in Christ are you with me now if that is the reality what Paul is dealing with is that that faith will manifest itself in Godly works are you with me Ephesians 2:9 we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus ordained under good works that's something that we're doing and forming out God already had placed it and swn it by election and under his presence it comes out what he's already placed there we're seeing a time where where where where plants are coming up the trees are blossoming the the apple trees have already had their blossoms and so forth and pretty soon they're going to have the apples which I'll be using for crisp but all of that every Apple that comes off that tree was in the little seed every leaf was in that seed what happened it had to come into the right atmosphere had to come into the ground have the right care and what does it do it is able to release what was already in it glory be to God that's what the presence of God does to a real child of God it releases who you really are amen it's unveiled who you really are and you begin to recognize I'm a son and daughter of God I'm not the Son and Daughter of whatever your parents name is I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God but without a word that comes forth to bring correction you keep going God in every generation when he sent his word his word has come with correction do all receive that word no many look at the word and say that's overboard Paul was just a woman hater or this and that it doesn't matter how you dress it doesn't matter with hair it doesn't M it doesn't the Bible says wh soever adds one word or taketh one away that isn't just cutting and pasting out the scriptures that's to that's to increase or deemphasize anything Hallelujah every word is yay and amen is that right so then when we look at it God sends a word of Correction why this is his discipline book but if God just doesn't give us a book and say okay you you'll be a good boy you'll be a good girl he's faithful because discipline is not being disconnected discipline is relationship you remember in the kingdom when David uh had to flee from Absalon you remember that yes and you remember how that that Absalon began to take counsel with the fitell remember that David zuk comes with David and David sends zuk he said go on back you go on back he said among there he said and he said perhaps he said that Absalon will hear you how in the world could David be confident in this because there evidently was a relationship that David did have with AB Absalon he knew him come on somebody he knew him or else he would have kept seducing his camp but he said go on back to him and it was the councel of zuk under the leading of the Lord that brought the defeat and brought David back in what was that it was a relationship David knew his child you understand that's why it's just like you know when you see things that take place within a church and and and I've learned I'll say I've learned I've learned to keep my mouth just shut when I look at other churches and look at other things like that cuz you know why it's not my problem that's right first of all I don't know those people but some you might have went and preached I don't that don't mean I know them God knows them so what I'm just saying within it is that I've recognized you know what it don't need my opinion here's people can look at things with this church or another church and say you know you should have done this you should have done that but do you know the hearts of the people see as the shepherd I know your hearts oh I know you that don't mean I'm going to be light on you but you understand it's like walking into a midst like when I went other places and I'm I'm there in a midst of other young people besides our young people I don't know those young people I might see certain things but I don't know their heart behind it what's going on I don't know so I have to wait and it might not even be something I say it might just be something if God's dealing with my heart God's telling me you be an image right now you with me it isn't only something you need to say it's be an image because if what you're saying you're not an image too it's hypocritical it must be image a durable substance behind it is that right what brings a reality within this word that God has sent is a life that is behind it it's a spirit that is behind it a real true Spirit of Christ that correction notice here in the scriptures uh where where it speaks in Proverbs 29:15 the rod and reproof give wisdom my belt has no wisdom in it Rod however you want it it has no wisdom how does it give wisdom there must be wisdom behind it that's why how does the word when the word is coming and there's correction coming how does the word bring wisdom into a person's life first we have to receive it but there must be wisdom in the administering of it wisdom wisdom for what wisdom so that the way is corrected and straightened out is that right I mean I don't know about you I don't want to keep getting whooped on the same thing yall I want to I don't want to I don't want it to be like where you show up the school and say come on I didn't know I know where you're going let's get on into this room right in here we'll go ahead and whoop you for the Day get started boy I don't want to get I don't want to keep getting whooped for the same thing why that's not glorious to my father what is Glory is that what he is doing it now comes out in my life it giveth wisdom look at this in verse 15 a Child Left to himself bringeth his mother to shame a Child Left to himself yes they don't come pre-programmed y'all know that right that's right I mean your phones might come programmed but your children don't and even as children of God having the seed of God within us and the spirit of God coming and quickened our lives it isn't that it's just automatic that's why you say well all the virtues are in me when I'm born of the spirit of God I'm brother Samuel I am a statue of a perfect man correction you're coming to it otherwise as the prophet said after you're born again you must these things must be born in you of the spirit of God otherwise you are adding peacock feathers you're putting feathers in so what must it be the nourishing the tutorship of the Holy Spirit as our brother prayed in the opening prayer Lord You Are The Potter we are the clay it's his molding it's his shaping it's his working in our lives so we need that's why Peter said as I was referring to those virtues that's why Peter could say in in 1 Peter chapter 2 I believe where it's at Peter could say while I am with you it is needful for me to stir up your pure Mind by way of remembrance that these things would abound in you so you mean just because I know it is not enough no remember the word is not just word that's being spoken when God speaks it's the spirit of God taking that word and it's God himself bringing release just as Genesis you recognize that each every service and the times the Junctions of times that we sat in it's the same holy spirit is saying let there be let there be let there be let there be it isn't things that all of a sudden just come come wow right after that service right there it is no what does he do a word of Correction shows you where you are and me and it shows us where we need to be but all of the all of the results of where we need to be relies on our heart whether it will receive it and our hearts receive it brother I have that virtue in me yes but you have to let go and let it come out let God bring it out of you amen yes sir a Child Left to himself you see this is where look in the in the Book of Revelations chapter 3 the Bible says concerning this time this age Jesus said behold I stand at the door and I knock If any man will hear my voice let him open the door I will come in unto him and I will s with him and he with me you say how could he s with me he's partaking of the word that he's already soon but he's knocking knocking is individually he's put out of his church listen friends having the Bible having some somebody just take a text out of the Bible doesn't mean that Christ is in the church is he preeminent is he welcome because he is the word he is the all of it is that right without him this is where it's at a Child Left to himself look where things are I ask you look where things are there are things that churches would never have dreamed of allowing and permitting but look at them now proven the homosexual agender approving all these other things making excuses you know why they don't have access to the power of the atonement that's why they have to find a way to compromise with sin because they don't have access to the blood hallah the way they view the blood is like cover me and I can keep on living the way I'm living that's not a blood [Music] covering the blood has the life and and the blood as Paul said speaketh better things this blood has a voice this Blood Revelations 1 it is a blood that brings a perfect loosening where you are no longer identified with who you are you are identified with who God knew you to be so you're no longer bound you are God God's free man God's free woman born of his Spirit born in the house of his word and he corrects us his children well don't don't stop rejoicing you ought to make that Rejoice even more as many as I [Applause] love Now understand if every time you came to church that was the that was was the thing every time where it's there's no growth that's why the prophet tells us in the adoption series they said you legalist Brothers keep the people tore up that's where he said after the preaching you need teaching to come in and stabilize the people God doesn't want you tore up I don't know about God Wants You stabilized and I'm glad that not only that that that he has done it that he's doing it that he will do it I'm grateful because if God takes me off the seat tomorrow it'll continue because it's his work amen don't you love himo well out of a 15 o steak we got about 12 ounces left that three was that 3 oz was pretty good notice these words here Psalms proverbs 29:17 correct thy son notice notice notice the term correct thy son where's the focus if all we focus is on that word correct you miss it thy son relationship relationship he corrects his own is that right in Proverbs and Hebrews 12 those who refuse it God says they're not mine cuz his children will refuse his they they his children receive his correction right they come out of confusion and what is it his children we as children we begin to hear the word ooo it's cutting o o that cuts but what is it boundaries oh my what is it it brings strength it brings security as God himself is coming and is Mindful and he's steading up and let you you and I know my boundaries have never changed hallu so relationship and he shall give thee rest correct th son and he shall give thee rest what's that mean brother Samuel well correcting then when it comes to other places you don't have to be on on edge I wonder if he's going to act I want oh Lord oh my we we oh my we better not go I I tell you I I don't know you don't have rest right that right you know I've said this before and and I I don't mean this anything to be funny but it's a truth you if they walk on the couches at home what do you think they're going to do on a church pew oh no they ought to know that's the house of God no that's your responsibility because see what's happening is your boundaries are not consistent well brother s that's just the couch who blessed you with it who's is that oh my God has allowed you to have it so you to honor the Lord in every thing but's see you want to have don't you want to have rest it's like how brother B tells us he said that every once in a while he said that the pastor has to hold down you know the the the the children he said like like a father a good father has to hold it down what it means to hold it down you want to get away come on friends no one of you line up and say I take it's a pinkin we didn't even do that when we growing up now you may not you may maybe didn't run cuz you knew you want to get away but the reality of it is is that you weren't lining up for it and saying please give me a whipping I need a spanking I need privileges removed you weren't because there was wisdom that knew what wisdom you needed the wisdom that was needed was not the spanking it was the wisdom that came through from the father the mother seeing the condition that if I don't get this corrected this this is what he end up being or she'll end up being later on down the line why because true discipline is with a vision the subject's amendment is in mind it's not just temporary look God is disciplining you and I why because we are to dwell in the future home and the Order of the home is the order of the family who dwells in it so God says they're my responsibility these are my youngs I'll correct them I know your flesh and my flesh we don't like correction but this on the inside says Thank You Lord thank you Lord is that right so here that relationship is gaining that heart and it's gaining the heart now listen to me now it's gaining the heart but in gaining the heart it's gaining favor but it's favor without compromise the Bible says in Hebrews chapter 2 that he took upon himself Flesh and Blood because why the children we the children were partakers of it his condensation and becoming one of us to redeem us through the shedding of his blood but that he also might be a merciful and faithful high priest are you with me so it's not things where you're coming to him and saying Lord you know I this is I'm tempted or Lord forgive me Lord in this or Lord he doesn't say that's not how he [Music] moves he knows what fear is all about Hebrews 5:7 he was heard with strong tears and crying in that he feared he knows what it is when the flesh doesn't want to yield but the inner man says I want to he prayed three times father if it's possible possible let this cup pass from me Lord why don't you answer all my prayers aren't you thankful those prayers weren't answered sometimes he doesn't answer the prayers it depends on where it's coming from where it's going to right but he had a full experience this is how God this is why the prophet could say than 18-year-old thoughts well sometimes that's hard not because you're so old it's it's hard because you have to try to think back how was that thinking you can't think of it as terms of a mature person who is 50 48 whatever and and 30 something and looking back on and saying come on can't no no it's working to bring that coming back to relate to all that just like all the things that you know they go through within their teenagers little things that embarrass them that you know you now I mean you don't care you come to church with ketchup stain on your shirt you don't bother you you understand now some of you won't you'll get there someday but you understand what I'm saying there's things that that mattered to you before yes it's being considered of that now it takes God this is not this is not something we just read and okay no no it takes the Lord it takes a lot of prayer this is like Noah Lord help me on the ark takes a lot of prayer so all of how that the Lord moves when all this you see this is where that even when we're looking at applying the scripture we must apply the word in faith we must now just a few moments in looking at how that God directs our attention with these things that even when we look at in Matthew chapter 18 if I can go go back to that just for a moment and let me just refer to a few points because where I want to move to is go into what Paul himself gives ad admonition to the people of God which is a part of discipline even in a home Church on and on it's all part of it Paul deals with this I for sake of time I'm just going to reference it it'll be in the notes but if you want to look at it in in your Bibles while I'm going through it you can it's Matthew 18:15 I know it's on the screen but I don't want to read every word this is dealing with discipline in the church if there's a brother that had trespassed against thee the Bible says you wait on him to text you and arrange a meeting it didn't say that if your brother has trespassed against you you go to him are you with me you go to him this with with with not moving within that it allows cancer to start growing one cancer breeds another cancer breeds another cancer and eventually people are wondering and saying wonder where the spirit of God is wonder where the Holy Ghost is wonder where the Lord is it's our responsibility you with me I've got the quotes I've just going to read them because I just want to refer to it so it's it's necessary and and here's the other part it's necessary when the Lord Jesus is looking at this here and giving this direction to the church that as he goes through it he says if he hear thee thou H has gained thy brother well wasn't he my brother before he was but that thing that was done was serving as a separation I hope I'm speaking to people that have heart of reconciliation this morning I hope you're understanding me Ephesians 5 if you read Ephesians 5 and you leave Ephesians 5 as just a scripture between husband and wife and say well as the H as Christ so loved the church so should the husband loved their wives as he gave and you read it in just that terms and you fail to recognize if Christ is your husband and his spirit is in you and you're part of his body then you nourish and cherish his body are you with me it has to be applied across the board no man having been born of the spirit of God call it Jesus a curse no man being filled with the spirit of God comes against his body is that right Ephesians 5 no man ever yet hated his own flesh but this is where God has to deal with our hearts to help us to see at times and say if I can refer back to Thursday's message get out of the ordinary and come back into into the greatness am that's not that's listen friends that's not an excuse to sin that's not an excuse to sin some people get nervous on those things I didn't make I didn't put the word I didn't I didn't write the book of Romans but I know the reality is when God is in Your Heart by the love of Jesus Christ you don't desire to do wrong are you with me hear many times of the brother brother Ram says over and over in the adoption Series in the Hebrew series he said now I know my legalist people that are sitting here he said many of you are legal he said this troubles you when I preach on these things it's true why it's a wrong slant it's as though you put the you through your works you put yourself in you don't put yourself in by your own Works neither do we look at because that's Armenian ISM neither do we look at Calvinism well once in Grace always in in Grace that's disgrace we believe that as long as that life is inside of you because the life inside of you will keep you in the boundaries of the word you love him if he doesn't hear you then take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three Witnesses every word may be established if he neglect to hear them tell it unto the church and if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a Publican I I I'm going through these things today because this is well first of all this is where God had led me and we started into it last week I'm going I'm I'm going further into it because we need this teaching because to see this in the right light where four four stages here first you go personally to the brother the sister if that's not then you take one or two more with you it didn't now let me be very clear in here it didn't say call the pastor preach thank you text the pastor no they didn't say that this is our this is the body of Jesus Christ you're a part of it just as in the Tabernacle in the wilderness they camped on this side this side this this side they protected anything that tried to come into the camp when the spirit of God is dwelling inside of you you are there to protect the working of the holy [Applause] spirit it's even like in your own home you're there to protect it this is where the scripture says I I want to deal with that last little part in verse 17 so we have an understanding of it he neglected here the church let him be unto thee as is a heathen man and a Publican in verse 18 whatsoever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven this is loosening from under the protection of the blood because what is it it's sin allowing to go on being tolerated instead of it being addressed listen to me very carefully now when Paul I read to you out of 1 Corinthians 5 when Paul spoke concerning that young man and what he was doing in living with his uh uh stepmother what did Paul say If any man be caught as a brother and all of these things are going on drunken whether it's a drunken a extortion or what you know what a is woo there some might running their mouth you see you have privileged to your own opinion but you're not a privilege to go around the church and spread it no sir this is part of a body we're a body of Believers you don't want to injure you want to try to protect you want to try to protect one another's testimony why I am My Brother's Keeper that doesn't mean I'm going to let him get by with things but it means that I'm going to also pray if I see something and I want to be moved by the Lord loose from under the protection why that God can't deal with them because we're praying for him holding them up in protection you know brother deal with the one situation in in in Hebrew series and I just got to reading over this the last week and I thought wow you know sometimes you read over things and I just I hadn't caught it before but there was a situation where an individual they brother BR talked about walking right out of the service and he said just walked off the platform and and these people were saying oh what a wonderful service what a wonderful time and he goes out in the parking lot and he overhears this other individual and this other person is saying that guyin nothing but an impostor brother B said what it was he said it was one who had backslid from the church now listen to to me carefully now one who had backslid from the church he said and had started running down the church and what we believe they had not went to another assembly yet I hope you're hearing me they hadn't went to another assembly they were still identified with falling from that assembly and brother Brown said he got up and he took the text they went out from us because they were not of us and then they went to him one went to them then two went these scriptures I just read to you they wouldn't come So eventually they loosed them from under the protection of the blood but Samuel did they ever return I don't know but this is what I'm trying to tell you if someone leaves here and they go to another church and then in that other Church they start running this down that scripture does not apply to that situation I hope somebody's hearing me some of you local know exactly where I'm at that does not apply in that manner see that's why it's important you're not giving your opinion when you don't know the full situation well whose responsibility the other assembly if God leads them to do it that way but let me just say this very clear so you understand it if you ever feel led you say brother Samuel I I just can't I can't come here anymore you know what God bless you I love you that doesn't apply here you might we might see things differently there might be different things but you know what let's go on for the Lord if you feel led to go somewhere else go somewhere else just go in the name of Jesus Christ amen just go and keep keep the opinions keep all those things don't go somewhere else and start spreading all of the negativity you understand don't go somewhere else just go on and say Lord cleanse everything this I thought this is perfect Church you thought wrong ain't nobody perfect including you just case you didn't know just want to remind you but God did send a gospel to perfect us hallelujah where does that Perfection begin in our soul and then God has Ministry and uned under that same Revelation to do what for the perfecting but that's not the same perfecting as the Perfection of your soul that perfecting is a thorough Furnishing which is what how many of you would want a house and you well look at the house I have and somebody where we sit down at oh I don't have no furniture how sad how sad you want to have furniture to set on remember Kim and I first got Sister Kim and I first got married hey we were happy to have the house we had we had them plastic lawn chairs man them things were like lazy boys to us we were just so happy it's true we were happy you know he had to hand me down tables and everything else but praise God we were happy I thank God for it I'm serious thank God for it this these two terms Heathen and Publican just so you understand it when it talks about the loosening from under the blood the Bible deals with that this is how that he is to be unto thee wow that's that's a that's a tremendous thing if it may made it if if things make it to a place of loosening of the blood but it's not to be looked at like oh no this is God's discipline but this is how God says this is how it is to be unto thee y'all believe this is a word this is how now notice this is where it takes the discernment of the spirit of God Paul says in 1 Corinthians 5 I was referring to moments ago Paul said put that Wicked one away from among you now listen to me this is where it takes discernment why is Paul saying Wicked he's talking about the spirit I I'm going to get to in just a moment Paul was dealing with the spirit that's where you have to have discernment and discernment does what that's why discernment with the correction it drives away foolishness that's Bound in the heart aren't you glad that God didn't destroy you the new birth does not annihilate you come on paramia what does it do the new birth does what you are A New Creation in the same old Temple is that right so when we look at then the scripture says let him be unto thee as a heathen and a Publican the word heathen if you think of heathen when you look at it we we have a real true worship is to be in our lives of the Living God see what what is heathenism heathenism where they don't believe it doesn't believe in the Living God the Living God dwelling in you it's going somewhere he's here in this Temple he's here in this Temple he's here in this Temple no but you recognize you are a temple of the Holy Ghost you conduct your life as a son and daughter of God see that's why it says he he's not conducting himself in the right way he refused all to hear all this that's what it says he's to be unto you as a heathen is he still a brother would they still be a sister yes but this is how they are to be unto you that that takes the real love of God the word Publican here uh just in my just just for me referencing it to you this word Publican this is God was dealing drawing their attention to how that tax collectors were detested not just by Jews they were detested by other nations they were remember hey you remember what what when when when God went over to uh U is it Matthew's house is it Ma who is the text ler Matthew or Andrew Matthew okay I'm sorry but we're gonna get the point okay Matthew we're going to get the point Matthew was regarded not you Matthew but Matthew was regarded as not a real great guy his own family looked at him with detest this is what Publican is because they detested them because they were harsh deceptive and greedy this is how God said is to look at it what was it about it's about the body because in all of these matters right here and which says be unto thee as a heathen and Publican is talking about their actions what were their actions actions that were injurious to the body if it's it's injurious to the body it's injurious to the Holy Spirit oh my can I have a few more minutes 2 Corinthians chapter 2 verse one I do want to read this to you my I you know brother brother Jerry's coming in here next week yes sir I know how you feel I always liked it when you know when when family came in after you got correction it always felt good no I know you're we certainly love brother Jerry and I know you all have been looking forward to that the Lord willing next Sunday he'll be here verse one and what I want you to look at here this is Paul after the people of God responded to the word and this is Paul speaking if I can say it like this to his children he's speaking even giving them guidance because look look guidance is not just guidance here was not Paul just saying do this no but there's the guidance is is that after in the restoring so what's what how Paul will do this let me just say kind of like this it's like this after the correction and everything is done it's just like when you have corrected your children you don't just have such a great distance and everything like that you let them know I love you I know they don't understand it I didn't understand it when my dad said this is going to hurt me worse than hurt you I never understood that I understand it now I'll tell you that much I understand that I told you last week there's times I've CRI cried I've cried right along with him but that crying has never made me to look back and say oh no I shouldn't have done this or shouldn't no no I know what's taking place but I can sit right there with them and say I love you I know you may not understand it but Daddy can't let you go this way I love you that didn't mean that all of a sudden I slip out you know within that week that that day and I'm thinking oh I feel so bad I got to go back and I say Paul do you love daddy do you still love daddy do you have flowery thoughts of daddy do you still think well of that you know what I'm doing I'm undoing all that was done Benjamin you're lucky you're back there not up here verse one but I determined this with myself that I would not come again to you in heaviness for if I make you sorry who is he then that maketh me glad but the same which is made Sorry by me now Paul the motive is Right Paul within this he's not saying I don't I don't want to make you sad because I always want to be happy that would have been selfishness right but Paul is letting it be known his motive and objective within it is that he would actually be able to receive Joy emanating out of their lives and I wrote this same unto you lest when I came I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to Rejoice having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all now notice he's talking about the writing this writing of correction that we read in 1 Corinthians 5 he's talking about this letter he said when I lest when I came I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to Rejoice so Paul is dealing with this if I had Paul said if this which has been reported to me if it had not been addressed then when I came among you all I would have sorrowed because I would have seen the condition of where things were but remember he being absent but yet present in the Spirit had already judged how could he judge by character of Christ now notice this in verse four for out of much Affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears I wonder within Paul's writing how many of the words might have been smudged from tears because when Paul wrote and told him what to do Paul's love was for the whole assembly he was not right in it that I tell you that that guy he hit no that let just no that F no it was out of Anguish out of love that he wrote not that you should be grieved notice the purpose of the discipline is not that you should be grieved but that you might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you what's Paul uncovering this has been the motive behind me it verse five if any have caused grief he hath not grieved me but in part that I may not overcharge you sufficient to such a man is this punishment which was inflicted of many now remember because the blood had been loosed they were at the final step Paul had admonished him don't even keep company with them and that's when they had went to the last step you hear me you know Paul in first Thessalonians when he deals with he uses the term Busy Body Busy Body he says you seen how we were among you we labored among you he said so as we said before he that does not work he doesn't eat wow that's the love of God really if he doesn't work he doesn't NE we'll say that for another time but Paul dealt there had to be correction within that situation as well verse 7 so that contr Wise you ought rather to forgive him now notice this direction that Paul gives here this is to the restoring of that young man who had been living with his mother-in-law so that contr Wise you ought rather to forgive him and and comfort him lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with over much sorrow wherefore I beseech you that you would confirm your love toward him appropriate times right it's appropriate times it's appropriate times even in the midst of Correction it can either be undone what was done or it can be solidified and it raises up up as a standard you love him verse n for to this end also did I write that I might know the proof of you whether you be obedient in all things to whom Ye Ye forgave anything I forgive also for if I forgave any to whom I forgave it for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ lest Satan should get advantage of of us for we are not ignorant of his devices Paul wanted the church to know that he says as you have forgiven so have I Paul also said I want you as a body to ensure you confirm your love toward him he not loving the behavior is not loving what the man was doing it's him you with me I know you look at this now tonight I'm not saying maybe you don't look at it but you might look at this and say this is not a real shouting service I don't know but I tell you what the presence of the Lord is so rich still and I'll tell you this right here if there's not real real true correction that comes into the church you can't enjoy yourself he that corrected his son hath rest is that right you want rest not I hope you don't you want you want rest can I read a couple more scriptures this is I'm I'm coming down I just I want to leave this with you here go to Second Corinthians 7:4 Paul is picking this same up same thing once again with the people and I want you to see this this this aspect great is my boldness of speech toward you great is my gloring of you I am filled with Comfort I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation ain't that wonderful I am refreshing he goes on to say for we when we were in Macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side without were fightings within were fears never nevertheless God that comforted those that are cast down comforted Us by the coming of Titus and not by his coming only but by the consolation Comfort wherewith he was comforted in you when he told us your earnest desire your mourning your fervent mind toward me so that I Rejoice the more so they were responding to correction but you know what that response to correction would not have been right if there hadn't been relationship because Paul's not here it's like the saying that you've heard when the cat's away the mouse will play Paul was not there but what they recognized is is that Paul sent the word and God is the word they what were they honoring they were not honoring so much as the person of Paul they were honoring the person of Christ for though I made made you sorry with a letter I do not repent though I did repent I don't repent but I did repent what was Paul saying well what's he saying it wasn't something I delighted to do I didn't want to make you sorry but yet I did want to make you sorry why why can you say you didn't but you did he didn't want to see him being sorry but yet at the same time there was a part the correction had to come no wonder the prophet could say I wish this message was not mine to bring as he stood there and said I've lost many friends after this service but aren't you glad he stood faithful a word that's come forth that's made you and I who we are sure enough a word that has come to release and reveal unto us the true boundaries of who we are for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry though it were but for a season now I Rejoice not that you were made sorry but that you sorrowed to repentance that's that's a key sorrowed to repentance not just sorrowed not just sorrow for ye were made sorry after a Godly manner I believe this is not only dealing with this in church I believe it's dealing in our homes it's after a Godly manner Godly manner listen friends I understand sometimes there's situation you can say Brother Sam I didn't have certain teaching like this or one more listen don't let the devil beat you up on it here's what you do you make sure that you're a faithful witness from here on out you understand me you can't do nothing about seeds that were swn back there but Esther you can tell your people to arm themselves sow good seed to counteract the bad where you were made sorry after a Godly manner that you might receive damage by us in nothing God doesn't want you damaged God doesn't want you walking out of church let me tell you this if you walk out of a church service at any time and you walk out and you're just so lethargic like and you're just something's wrong I know well I don't want some say that sometimes depending on people's backgrounds it PR it it it depending depending on backgrounds will actually cause a service to be a made or made made or broken form you understand if they're if things are not like that then it's like we didn't have church but then if it's not like this it's like oh you know then others it comes like this other oh we need the balance of the Holy Spirit you understand me God's Delight is not coming down and whooping us I want you to understand that God don't God don't say you know what I'm gonna give my Ser my servant something it's going to whoop him correction it tears you down listen to me now it's to do what separate you separate from what's wrong but God interested in just doing that CU if he does that all the time there's no building that's right but sometimes you got to get the stones out of the yard before you can sew the grass and to get the stones out of the ground you got to use a rock hound on a bobcat and get them out of the ground you with me it's not a fun job sewing a lawn but you get the rocks out of it raking and out of there and The Rock count don't get them all but once you get them all out all you can enjoy the grass verse 10 Godly sorrow this is very important Godly sorrow worketh repentance to Salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death I've watched conditions I've watched where you can see things within this world where the way the world is they're sorry I know some of you think I don't hear people say a lot of times sorry no no a lot of Sorrow is a lot of the sorrow is truly what it is it's worldly because the sorrow is I'm sorry because these situations are the way they are it has nothing to do with what they are judge I'm sorry that the policeman was there and he caught me when I was robbing the bank I'm sorry I'm sorry I robbed this bank and I didn't Rob the other one I'm sorry I don't know why everything it always happens to me I tell you I was my family everything was so messed up I just look at me I'm I'm all together a mess I you think the judge is going to give in on that and say release the guy he's a troubled fell no that troubling listen to me very carefully that troubling might be true there's no doubt there's marks and scars upon every one of our lives but listen to me you don't have to let that be your alabi and your excuse that might have worked before the blood of Jesus Christ and I say might have but since there's a blood that has come a strong bleach it doesn't listen to to me it doesn't do away with the memory or the past of it but it can take the sting out of it and it can bring healing to a wound that there's no threads to stitch it upall do you understand me because there's things that all the way through this room right here there's different ones of us has had things whether it's come from school parents or different people of things things that's happened but listen to me you don't have to live with that as an excuse and I don't say that lightly to you I'm telling you that there is strength and there's power in the blood of the Lamb if you can just submit yourself and say Lord this there's a this a situation but Lord God this is not going to be me I'm not going to live of that natural family tree I want the strain of predestination to move in my life Lord God that tree of life to move through me that doesn't just come just by us saying it it comes by us submitting ourselves giving ourselves to the word letting the word work in our life being a real Godly sorrow when God deals with our lives on things what does that mean that means take responsibility a pardon is not a pardon unless it's accepted as a pardon so real sorrow Godly sorrow I love that worketh repentance what is repentance if you repentance is where you're going this way but repentance is now turn that's repentance you can't be walking the same way and say you repented hello somebody you say I repented and gave my life to the Lord then there has to be a turn in your life and what do you start doing you turn to him who is able to cleanse you you keep walking on with him until you are united with him in a real spiritual baptism to where it changes your nature I tell you a church can't change your nature right no sir right man can't change in nature you can be under fear like I don't want this to be known I I don't want you're living under the fear right God doesn't want you living under the fear God doesn't want you living under the fear of Samuel Browning God forbid I don't want nothing like that you understand me I want you in love with the Lord Jesus Christ that's my desire because I tell you what if you love him in the right way I know you'll love me and you'll love me in the right way because whether I know it or see it or not he knows oh yeah he it's greater I have greater access than any Instagram account yes sir he always he always reveals the posts on his Facebook that are relevant for the day and when he is making him known he doesn't post them to tear people down he letting his post be known and say oh yeah this is my blog blog that blog's not new there's nothing new Under the Sun this is my blog Glory who's who's been blog for it's remind who are of the book of the book yeah they've seen my face Hallelujah theyve seen my face they have seen me face to face this is a real Facebook Hallelujah and I say like like like like like like like like I think that's how it goes is it right is that how it goes brother Enoch likes right there oh my the presence of God just the Holy Ghost just say I like that W Glory oh Hallelujah glory be to God I love you I have one more scripture say why you keep asking we love you you keep reading more scripture I'm just checking read one more scripture this is what I want you to see is this closing scripture this is what Titus has seen in the people it wasn't something that Titus had to make up but Titus saw the effect where discipline correction had went forth it had been received and now it had worked itself not only through that person that got right but it came within the church as well notice how Paul Paul says this here for behold the self-same thing that ye sorrowed after a Godly sword what carefulness it wrought in you yay what clearing of yourself yay what indignation indignation against what they separated said that's sin see what they were aligning themselves with God like David said I hate that which thou hatest oh God what fear Y what vinant desire vinant desire for what what's vinant the bubbling up a boiling what is it a fervent desire to please him what Zeal what Revenge Revenge Revenge yeah revenge on who the devil yes sir how do you get revenge on the Devil by being obedient to the Lord yes sir that's how you gain revenge on the devil you say something sharp and cut into your wife how do you get revenge you come with obedience and say forgive me I shouldn't have said it in that manner or if you said something to your husband in the wrong way how do I get how do I get revenge it's not revenge on him it's Revenge at the Devil brother you don't know how he you don't know how she I may not know how but what I do know is you're a Believer what I do know is greater is he that's in you what I you know is is that by the spirit of God in you you are given to be able to discern and try every Spirit woo Lord my my my my my we're done we're ending here in all things ye have approved yourself to be clear in this matter that's the word of a prophet and remember though Paul went off the scene the prophet of the hour stayed on the scene who the angel of the Lord the Holy Ghost Moses went off the scene but the angel of the Lord stayed on the scene right the angel of the Lord is present you believe that yes sir he's faithful he's a faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God the amen of God God is faithful so we can say today and looking at this and I ask I admonish you just as your pastor I know we have some visitors here may God bless you we appreciate having you in our gates this morning trust that you have felt refreshed in the Lord because the word that we're looking at it's a word God's word it always brings edification it'll cut but it edifies is that right sure it cuts but it also edifies as a matter of fact God knows how to encourage you in the right things and discourage you in the wrong things how does he know that because he knows you and he knows me God ain't just looking at numbers like a professor in a big seminar room on number 56 this guy he just kind of blew off the test that guy may have studied like crazy he doesn't know the guy brother same me that shouldn't make any difference with a grade whatsoever I don't w't go there he doesn't know the person God knows you he knows me let me tell you something let me tell you something how God knows you and me you know God he does not even have to say things in a certain way but he does for you and me I'm glad he does that you know what that does that lets me know even when I'm being corrected it lets me know he cares he's mindful he does doesn't want me to struggle with the words he wants me to yield to it I love him I love him because he first love me and purchase my [Music] [Applause] salvation on [Music] Cal Street I know today by the way that it places on the calendar it says Father's Day it's like they say Mother's day and those things I thank God for every every father in here but I want to take a moment as well to thank my heavenly father [Music] Hallelujah he set me free he redeemed me he shed his blood and he keeps working with me he keeps dealing with me correcting me edifying me showing me the way he is a faithful father he is truly friend that Stith closer than a brother he's not just somebody in distance that shows up but he's there with me he said Lo I'm with you always he knows how to condescend down to my level and talk to me he knows how to think 42 year old thoughts said Brother Sam he was only 33 years old but he knows the complexity of time you say he was only 33 Old 33 33 years old when he was crucified but when he stood before the Pharisees they said thou art a man no more than 50 years old he wasn't 50 but that shows the burden he was under that's he had come to such a place coming to dwell among us that he had such a burden on him that his age was beyond what his chronological age was Hallelujah so does he understand yes he does he's a faithful and merciful high priest I love him because he first loved me don't you love him I tell you if you hadn't surrendered your life to him wouldn't you want to surrender your life would you want to turn it over to the Living God and say Lord Lord Jesus you can hear him calling you what is that it's the voice of the father calling you what must I do surrender be like the prodal come back home come home say Lord even in the things we spoke about Lord let my life reflect the discipline of the word I want to walk I want to receive I want to walk in Lord in the chastening I want to walk in every part of your word I want to grow that Lord in my life I'm bringing glory to you in all things that's what Peter said they could see your good works and glorify who not you but your heavenly father because we are reflection of him like the older brother was talking to the younger brother and the younger brother said I don't know what daddy look like the older brother said well the older brother was on the scene the older brother brother said well they say I got his smile they say I I I I look like him in in in this manner and The Young and the little boy said ah now I know when I see you I've seen the father and let me tell you something the older brother is not a fleshly man the older brother is Christ himself because it is Christ who reveals the father no man has seen God at any time that the only begotten of the father he had declared him Lord so it takes the living image of the living Christ the true holy ghost moving in the church is what the true image of the Living God and that moving in you and I releasing and quickening that seed reveals the image of who our father is cuz you know why we look like him you love him amen God bless you this morning Hallelujah let's just have a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord just seeing Lord hearing the word this morning Lord we thank you Father dear God as our brother

taking these things praying over them Lord as true as your Prophet told us he said we don't apply these things in Matthew 18 with just a motive of wanting to get at somebody it must be out of love and Lord that's truly even as Paul gave the direction for the church in Corinth they had all the gifts but he let them know I'll show you a more excellent way the excellent way wasn't that the gifts
