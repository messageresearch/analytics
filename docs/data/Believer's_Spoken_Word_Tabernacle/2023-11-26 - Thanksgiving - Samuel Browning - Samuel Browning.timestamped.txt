[34:43] [Music]
[34:50] now you know we
[34:54] consider
[34:55] place
[34:57] you
[34:58] know in a moment that we're living in
[35:00] and when
[35:01] the lamb steps
[35:05] forward we know he Ste forward to take
[35:07] the book to reveal to make himself known
[35:10] to us in this hour we also realize that
[35:13] through this there's coming a literal
[35:17] Corporal coming there is yes sir and you
[35:21] realize
[35:23] that the moment that he changes those
[35:28] garments lays aside those
[35:31] garments and becomes the
[35:34] lion that signifies there's a change at
[35:37] the same time taking place on
[35:42] Earth amen that's good and to think that
[35:46] in in all of that in this moment it
[35:50] isn't just that we need him there as a
[35:52] lamb to cover all of our
[35:54] mistakes but I wouldn't want to be here
[35:56] a
[35:57] moment without his
[36:00] Mercy we need him every day the Bible
[36:05] said let us come before the throne of
[36:07] grace that we might find help in the
[36:09] time of need and I I don't know about
[36:11] you but I I find that scripture it means
[36:14] more to me than what it did even years
[36:17] ago I I don't just look at that
[36:18] scripture of looking at God helping me
[36:21] beyond my mistakes no I I look at that
[36:24] as
[36:25] God you're the one to bring to pass in
[36:28] my life the word that you've spoken over
[36:31] me and asking God let that word let it
[36:35] just live out in my life we're coming
[36:37] before the throne of grace that we find
[36:40] help in the time of need without him we
[36:42] can do nothing isn't that true amen it's
[36:46] so it's so good to be together and uh so
[36:49] good to see each and every one of you
[36:51] evidently you survived the
[36:55] holiday
[36:59] oh my one of my buddies on the on one of
[37:01] my threads that I'm on said man he said
[37:03] I hope we're okay to button our pants we
[37:05] Sunday morning you
[37:07] know but uh it's just it's just been
[37:10] good to be together and uh we're just
[37:13] grateful to the Lord for his Mercy amen
[37:16] for all that he has done and all that
[37:18] he's doing amen and we just um are
[37:22] grateful for that I tell you what the
[37:23] Lord has been so good to us we've had
[37:25] some wonderful services is here uh with
[37:28] brother Timothy there on on Thursday
[37:30] night and and I know sometimes it's a
[37:32] little it can be a little difficult to
[37:35] understand uh the language and sometimes
[37:37] those backgrounds and uh but um I think
[37:41] the point got acrossed and uh I I
[37:43] certainly believe it like this when I
[37:45] you know approach it and say God just
[37:48] help me to give me the understanding
[37:50] amen that we need cuz he's still the
[37:52] same God that loosens our opens our
[37:54] hearing and what needs to be gotten and
[37:57] I thought that was so powerful of what
[37:58] the Lord brought there through uh
[38:00] brother Timothy Amen in that night and
[38:03] if there was ever a time that we need to
[38:05] be United it's right now and you realize
[38:08] that that uniting itself is not
[38:11] something that we do on our own strength
[38:14] or our own accord but that's that's
[38:17] through God's working in our life it's
[38:20] just as much as we look at things and we
[38:23] say with lining up with God and as we
[38:27] line up with God then we'll be lining up
[38:29] with one another abolutely because we
[38:33] otherwise it's just us conferring one
[38:35] our thoughts on somebody else but if
[38:36] we're lined up with God then we can be
[38:39] lined up with one another amen and
[38:41] that's I believe that's God's desire and
[38:43] I tell you brother uh brother John
[38:46] Sanger I so appreciated amen the
[38:48] ministering of the word appreciated a
[38:51] gift amen that was there and uh how many

[38:59] um uh I'm I'm so glad to me I I've said
[39:02] this over and over and I mean it I'm so
[39:04] thankful for the variety that God has
[39:06] God doesn't want any of us he doesn't
[39:09] want you to be like somebody else he
[39:10] want you just to be you how he's made
[39:14] you and God has it's just so beautiful
[39:17] the bouquet and the ministry we have
[39:19] certainly been blessed I'll tell you to
[39:21] me the Bride of Jesus Christ is a
[39:24] blessed people oh yeah amen and with the

[39:40] Lord and I I certainly believe there are
[39:42] things that God has has done so
[39:44] specially Amen in these services and so
[39:48] we just want to look to the Lord this
[39:49] morning and just invite him that he'll

[42:09] amen if you turn with me to
[42:11] Psalms
[42:17] 100 I want
[42:19] to look here this morning want to say
[42:22] thank you to the
[42:24] musicians and uh
[42:29] so thankful to
[42:33] God Psalms
[42:36] 100 this is a very familiar Psalm to
[42:39] many of us and that many times we quote
[42:42] from this um but I want to read from
[42:46] here and just just drawing a little a
[42:49] little thought here this
[42:51] morning Psalms 100 verse1 this is a
[42:55] Psalm of
[42:57] praise says Make a Joyful Noise unto the
[43:00] Lord All Ye
[43:03] Lands serve the Lord with gladness that
[43:07] means joy and come before his presence
[43:11] with
[43:12] singing know ye that the Lord he is God
[43:17] it is he that hath made us and not we
[43:20] ourselves we are his people and the
[43:23] Sheep of his pasture
[43:26] enter into his gates with Thanksgiving
[43:30] and into his courts with praise and be
[43:33] thankful unto him and bless his name for
[43:38] the Lord is good his Mercy is
[43:42] Everlasting and his truth endureth to
[43:46] all
[43:48] generations amen I just like to speak on
[43:50] a simple word Thanksgiving may God bless
[43:53] you and bless the reading of the word as
[43:55] you're being seated
[44:01] this is a Psalm of of
[44:04] Thanksgiving it's a Psalm of Praise many
[44:06] of these different Psalms would even be
[44:10] rehearsed some of them at certain times
[44:13] not only in the year but some of them
[44:16] were were Psalms that were rehearsed in
[44:19] a daily manner some in a weekly
[44:22] manner but this is a Psalm of
[44:24] Thanksgiving and I want to just say it
[44:26] like this that Thanksgiving itself is an
[44:30] expression of gratitude yeah and
[44:34] thankfulness for what has already been
[44:36] done and you're a partaker of it that's
[44:39] right that's good you can't be thankful
[44:42] for anything that you've not experienced
[44:44] true but when you've experienced it then
[44:47] you can be thankful that's why the
[44:50] scripture could say oh Taste of the Lord
[44:52] and see that he is goodjah
[44:56] amen yes now if you'll notice this here
[44:59] as this Psalm of praise the Bible says
[45:02] in 1 chonicles
[45:05] 1634 oh give thanks unto the Lord for he
[45:08] is good and for his mercy endureth
[45:13] forever and say ye save us oh god of our
[45:18] salvation and gather us together and
[45:21] Deliver Us from the Heathen that we may
[45:24] give thanks to th holy name and glory in
[45:29] thy praise now I want you to notice as
[45:32] we're just a few scriptures that there
[45:35] is a reason for giving thanks and that
[45:38] reason for giving thanks of even how
[45:40] David has expressed this and this is a
[45:42] Psalm here of dedication is that of what
[45:46] God has done God has gathered us
[45:49] together God has delivered us so uh my
[45:53] praise is not empty my praise is full
[45:56] that's right in Psalms 30:1 when David's
[46:00] house was dedicated it said thou has
[46:03] turned for me my mourning into dancing
[46:07] thou Hast put off my sackcloth and
[46:11] girded me with
[46:13] gladness Oh Glory to the end that my
[46:16] glory may sing praise to thee and not be
[46:20] silent oh Lord my God I will give thanks
[46:24] unto thee forever that's right so David
[46:27] is declaring I I've got a reason to give
[46:30] thanks abely because you can't give
[46:33] thanks for anything if you haven't
[46:35] experienced it it would be like you
[46:37] giving thanks for uh the Thanksgiving
[46:40] meal in my house and you did not eat
[46:43] it but if you've been there and you ate
[46:46] it then you can say thank you is that
[46:49] right and this is why that when David is
[46:52] expressing thou in verse 11 turn my
[46:55] morning into dancing you have put off my
[46:59] sackcloth and gted me mlus aren't you
[47:01] glad when God is the one it's not you or
[47:04] I that's determined when to put off the
[47:06] sackcloth but God is the one who puts
[47:09] off the
[47:10] sackcloth God is the one who looks down
[47:12] into our life and he sees when that
[47:14] first Nature has so aligned with his
[47:17] word and it's God who brings about the
[47:19] change in our life thou H has turned my
[47:22] mourning into dancing some
[47:26] 107:15 oh that men would praise the Lord
[47:30] for his goodness and for his wonderful
[47:33] Works to the children of men now when we
[47:37] get into this Psalm here this morning in
[47:39] Psalm verse 100 verse one as we read in
[47:43] our text it says Make a Joyful Noise
[47:46] unto the Lord All Ye Lands uh very
[47:50] prophetic of what would take place we
[47:53] understand that it was the spirit of
[47:54] Christ in David as it was the spirit of
[47:56] Christ in the rest of the prophets when
[47:59] they would speak because in this time
[48:02] there is no other people who knows the
[48:04] Lord outside of that of Israel but
[48:08] notice he said All Ye Lands it would be
[48:11] where that God himself would be known
[48:14] among the people among his children that
[48:17] that mystery that would be hidden within
[48:20] him that he would take a bride out of
[48:22] many kindreds nations and tongues so
[48:26] this is the point that I get to is That
[48:28] Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord all ye
[48:31] land so there is no nationality nor
[48:34] excuse for us not to praise the Lord
[48:38] hallelujah now it's true that we all
[48:40] might worship a little differently but
[48:43] let all of us praise and give Glory unto
[48:46] God A Joyful Noise yes sir amen has he
[48:51] done something for you has you has he
[48:54] brought you from where you were to where
[48:56] you are
[48:57] now notice Make a Joyful Noise not just
[49:00] a noise but a Joyful Noise something
[49:04] that has substance something that has
[49:07] reality in it something that has
[49:09] significance that word joyful is a shout
[49:13] to raise a sound cry out to give a blast
[49:17] it's like that of a shout in a Triumph
[49:20] uh shout like an alarm to battle it's to
[49:23] shout in Triumph to shout for joy and
[49:27] let me just say it like this the only
[49:29] way even when Israel came around the
[49:31] walls of Jericho and it was on that
[49:34] seventh day that they were commanded
[49:36] after the seventh time around to shout
[49:39] the shout itself was already a shout of
[49:43] Triumph because God by his word had
[49:47] already declared the victory is
[49:51] finished so when they shouted it was not
[49:55] something something to where they just
[49:57] came under some type of a feeling but
[49:59] they were shouting because of a reality
[50:03] that God has already given us the
[50:06] victory yes sir is that right and there
[50:10] was a shout for Joy so there is a A
[50:13] Joyful Noise and the bible let me just
[50:16] say it like this a shout has a meaning
[50:18] in it it is a response to a certain
[50:22] reality that you've experienced the
[50:24] Bible says in Zechariah 4:6 it said not
[50:28] by might nor by power but by my spirit
[50:31] saeth the Lord of hosts who art thou oh
[50:33] great Mountain before zerubabel Thou
[50:36] shalt become a plain and he shall bring
[50:39] forth The Headstone thereof with
[50:41] shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it so
[50:46] not just shouting not just shout but
[50:49] these shoutings have meaning in them
[50:52] Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord
[50:55] in 1 Thessalonians 4:16 for the Lord
[50:59] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[51:03] shout voice of an archangel the Trump of
[51:06] God and the dead in Christ shall rise
[51:08] first now even these scriptures that
[51:10] I've read here it has meaning to you has
[51:13] meaning to me as Believers because we
[51:16] have received the shoutings of
[51:20] Grace yes sir amen where God has
[51:23] gathered a people and built them under
[51:25] the power of God back into a place a
[51:28] Powerhouse a temple of the Living God
[51:30] and hear The Headstone coming and it's
[51:33] shoutings of Grace Grace unto it let me
[51:35] just say it these shoutings are not
[51:38] empty noise but they have meaning in it
[51:43] is that right here stood a prophet in
[51:45] that hour he knew what he was talking
[51:47] about he had been somewhere and was able
[51:50] to tell you I've been there on the other
[51:53] side and I have saw it
[51:56] and millions shouted out we're resting
[52:01] on that yes
[52:03] sir amen there's a substance to my
[52:07] shout notice in Jo job 38:4 I hope
[52:11] you're getting what I'm saying in Job 38
[52:13] verse verse4 here God is speaking to job
[52:17] all of his trial everything he's going
[52:19] through but God does not take him to the
[52:21] trial God takes him to his victory which
[52:25] go before there was ever a trial before
[52:29] there was ever atom dust or molecule
[52:32] that job was found secured in the mind
[52:36] of
[52:37] God where was thou when I laid the
[52:41] foundation of the earth declare if thou
[52:43] Hast understanding who hath laid the
[52:46] measures thereof if thou knowest or who
[52:48] ha stretched the line upon it whereupon
[52:51] are the foundations thereof fastened or
[52:53] laid the Cornerstone thereof you might
[52:56] say well what does that have to do with
[52:57] my trial if you can recognize that there
[53:00] is nothing when you see yourself there
[53:04] there is nothing here in the temporal
[53:06] life that can alter your Eternal
[53:10] destination sir yes sir all of the
[53:12] things between here and there all of
[53:15] those things are things permitted by God
[53:18] all of those things that but they cannot
[53:20] alter the destiny of a child of God so
[53:24] in the midst of what I go through I can
[53:27] still have a Joyful
[53:30] Noise because I know in whom I have
[53:34] believed that's right good is that all
[53:37] right we believe that don't
[53:40] we notice this when the morning Stars
[53:45] sang
[53:47] together and all the sons of God did
[53:51] what shouted for
[53:54] joy now I don't think I have this quote
[53:56] up there but just listen to this out of
[53:58] the serpent seat opening quote dear God
[54:01] the Great and Mighty God who formed All
[54:03] Things by the power of His Spirit has
[54:05] brought Jesus Christ his only begotten
[54:07] son who freely died for we Sinners into
[54:12] this to reconcile us back into this
[54:14] marvelous Fellowship that we have again
[54:17] with God and as we're Tau in the Blessed
[54:20] word that we had fellowship with him
[54:23] before the foundation of the the world
[54:26] when the morning stars sing together and
[54:28] the sons of God shouted for Joy way back
[54:31] before the foundation of the world how
[54:33] do we know that that wasn't the same
[54:35] time that the lamb was slain that when
[54:38] God in his great thinking seen us
[54:41] shouting and rejoicing in our Salvation
[54:44] through
[54:46] Jesus so we were shouting for Joy
[54:50] because we seen our Salvation in the
[54:54] lamb of
[54:56] God that's why we can shout now because
[54:59] what happened there and I was a part of
[55:01] there now has struck down and it's
[55:04] caught up right here in my life I
[55:07] recognize I'm a part of it yes sir I'm a
[55:10] part of it that's what brings out a
[55:13] Joyful
[55:15] Noise are you hearing me I don't just
[55:18] get joyful when things are up and that
[55:20] everything's good and my bank account

[55:24] the world
[55:26] give Jesus said I give you a joy that no
[55:29] man can take from you then not a child
[55:33] can take it out of your life Hallelujah
[55:35] there's nothing can take this Joy away
[55:38] from you that's right glory be to God
[55:41] you ought to just say it's my joy that's
[55:44] right he gave it to me now it's
[55:47] mine oh my notice notice here Hebrews
[55:51] 2:11 for both he that sanctify and they
[55:55] who are Sanctified are all of one for
[55:58] which cause he's not ashamed to call
[56:00] them Brethren saying I will declare thy
[56:03] name unto my brethren in the midst of
[56:06] the church will I sing praise unto
[56:10] thee this is who he is that's right he
[56:13] is the Victor the mighty conqueror he is
[56:16] proclaiming his victory over Satan he is
[56:21] proclaiming his victory over the world
[56:24] where is he doing it declaring it in the
[56:26] midst of his church that's right let me
[56:29] just tell you something right now that
[56:31] maybe you don't see yourself as
[56:33] Victorious but what's important is is
[56:35] God sees you as
[56:37] Victorious and that's why God is
[56:39] speaking over your life because it's you
[56:42] and I coming to see what God knows and
[56:44] sees about you and I and the Bible says
[56:48] he will declare his name his life his
[56:52] character himself in the midst of his
[56:54] Church in the midst of his people and He
[56:57] will sing notice this sing praise unto
[57:02] thee notice what the spirit of God does
[57:05] it's praise unto the finished work of
[57:07] Calvary hallelujah it's finished I am
[57:11] redeemed the Bible said let the redeemed
[57:14] of the Lord say
[57:15] so amen singing A Hymn that's what that
[57:18] scripture means a hym a declaration of a
[57:21] hero I say there's no greater hero than
[57:25] the Lord Jesus Christ the almighty God
[57:28] come down Among Us and do the work and
[57:30] reveal himself to you and I notice this
[57:33] I will declare thy name unto my brethren
[57:35] in Psalm
[57:37] 751 he says unto thee Oh God do we give
[57:40] thanks unto thee do we give thanks now I
[57:43] want to just think the point right here
[57:45] David is certain here we know in whom we
[57:48] are
[57:51] worshiping we give thanks unto thee oh
[57:54] oh God isin't it wonderful to know your
[57:58] God isin't it wonderful to know the
[58:00] Living God I'm not talking about an
[58:03] imagination I'm not talking something
[58:05] that somebody's painted up but I'm
[58:07] talking about to know
[58:09] him oh God do we give thanks unto thee
[58:13] we give thanks for that thy name is near
[58:17] thy wondrous Works declare that's so
[58:21] good thy name is near that name is
[58:24] person his
[58:26] life it's near because who can do this
[58:29] but God that's right now the Church of
[58:31] the Living God we do not follow signs
[58:34] and
[58:35] wonders signs and wonders are to follow
[58:39] us so we're not running after signs and
[58:42] wonders no we're not looking for a
[58:44] Ministry to spring up that well this
[58:46] ministry would be like brother Bram or
[58:48] them we're not looking for that that's
[58:50] right we've already received our last
[58:51] sign that's right and the greatest
[58:53] reality is is to recognize that it's
[58:56] Christ in you recognize that God don't
[58:59] want us running here and there if I have
[59:01] this man pray for me or fact God don't
[59:03] want is not interested in that God is
[59:06] interested in that you and I can
[59:08] recognize Christ in our own lives so
[59:11] good that's the purpose of this message
[59:14] is to bring a living God to live behind
[59:17] our
[59:19] flesh and manifest Sons and Daughters of
[59:22] God in this hour yes well I'm talking
[59:25] about Thanksgiving who alone can do
[59:27] these things but God just got a call
[59:30] here this morning even from sister
[59:32] readen I know the prayer request was
[59:34] made keep her in prayer but the doctors
[59:36] even you know you heard the testimony
[59:38] she gave during the communion service a
[59:40] few weeks back but even the doctors here
[59:43] once again the doctors spoke to her and
[59:45] just here recently and said I don't know
[59:48] what's taking place but those tumors are
[59:52] shrinking Hall even more I tell you why
[59:56] sir it's God yes sir and God's got a
[1:00:00] purpose for Sister
[1:00:03] Rita who can do it but God I thank God
[1:00:07] for medical science but let me tell you
[1:00:09] something there ain't enough medicine
[1:00:11] that can heal
[1:00:13] anybody is that right if it could then
[1:00:16] you take a dying person put some put
[1:00:18] some heal or put some medicine on their
[1:00:21] wound it'll never heal because life is
[1:00:24] the healer right so I want to say it
[1:00:27] like this I'm so thankful for the time
[1:00:29] we're living in not because of the world
[1:00:32] not because of the world situation but
[1:00:34] I'm thankful to believing we're living
[1:00:37] in the time of the Finish we're living
[1:00:40] in a time of the end we're living in a
[1:00:42] time that all the prophets and all of
[1:00:45] them have looked forward to this
[1:00:48] time yes sir if Luther could have lived
[1:00:51] to this time he would have loved to have
[1:00:53] lived in this time
[1:00:55] but he fulfilled and responded to the
[1:00:58] anointing that he was under to do what
[1:01:00] God called him to do same thing with
[1:01:03] Wesley same thing with the zza street
[1:01:05] Pentecost but where we are living in a
[1:01:08] time to where there is a people on earth
[1:01:11] now that will not see
[1:01:15] death there is a people that's not
[1:01:17] looking at promises a far off but there
[1:01:20] is a people upon Earth where the Living
[1:01:23] God is declaring himself that I am the
[1:01:26] Fulfillment of all things we are living
[1:01:30] in a time where the word itself the
[1:01:32] Bible itself it is now an open book
[1:01:36] where we recognize and we're seeing our
[1:01:38] self our identity even in these
[1:01:40] scriptures that we are reading here this
[1:01:43] morning we find ourselves find this day
[1:01:46] find this hour how could we have done it
[1:01:49] without the spirit of God that's right
[1:01:52] brother brandom opens in the message the
[1:01:53] in the message the Rapture and he says
[1:01:55] oh you're hearing these brothers get up
[1:01:57] and make statements about the message of
[1:01:59] the hour he said what that is it's a
[1:02:01] promise that God has made to us in this
[1:02:03] hour and he I love what he says next he
[1:02:06] said we wouldn't even know where to go
[1:02:07] in the scripture but he's led us to
[1:02:09] those places that's right the spirit of
[1:02:12] God has quickened to us the places in
[1:02:15] the scripture those places that belong
[1:02:18] to us in this hour because here we are
[1:02:21] preparing to step into a new day and so
[1:02:24] with that in mind we recognize the Bible
[1:02:26] says in Revelations chapter 5 where we
[1:02:29] stand We're The Taking of the book and
[1:02:32] the taking of that book is the most
[1:02:34] Sublime Sublime event within history he
[1:02:38] took the book he paid the price of
[1:02:40] redemption for you and I is that right
[1:02:43] he prevailed In The Garden of Gethsemane
[1:02:46] he paid the price of redemption in other
[1:02:49] words to bring you and I back to the
[1:02:51] rightful life that we were intended to
[1:02:54] be in the beginning and down through
[1:02:57] time God you know even there in the time
[1:03:01] among you know uh the disciples at first
[1:03:03] not even aware that there was going to
[1:03:05] come forth a gentile bride but God had
[1:03:08] it in his mind it was a secret hidden
[1:03:12] Mystery amen that God was going to call
[1:03:15] a people out of the Gentiles for his
[1:03:17] name sake yes sir many different types
[1:03:20] we could run through in the scripture
[1:03:21] but I want you to notice the Bible said
[1:03:24] that this book it was written within and
[1:03:27] on the outside sealed with Seven Seals
[1:03:31] meaning that there is a meaning within
[1:03:33] here God himself his thoughts are
[1:03:36] written within his word God does not
[1:03:39] have to come up with a new message but
[1:03:41] it's God fulfilling his promised word
[1:03:45] that's God interpreting his word on the
[1:03:48] backside of the book backside meaning
[1:03:50] not outside but it's speaking at the end
[1:03:53] time yeah that here when there was a
[1:03:56] strong Angel proclaiming oh let there
[1:04:00] come forth if is worthy let him step
[1:04:03] forth or forever now hold his peace now
[1:04:08] to recognize that within this when the
[1:04:10] book was taken if I can jump to verse
[1:04:13] eight when he had taken the book The
[1:04:15] Four beast and 4 and 20 Elders how many
[1:04:19] know that's the four that's the that's
[1:04:20] the 12 apostles that's the 12 Patriarchs
[1:04:23] f down before the lamb having every one
[1:04:26] of them Harps and golden vials full of
[1:04:28] odors which are the prayers of the
[1:04:31] Saints you know you could take this
[1:04:33] verse right here and put it right back
[1:04:34] in the devil's nose where the devil said
[1:04:36] your prayers aren't working your prayers
[1:04:38] aren't affected you've been praying
[1:04:40] about your children but let me tell you
[1:04:42] something every prayer you prayed has
[1:04:44] not just went out and floated by but
[1:04:47] every prayer is reserved and God
[1:04:50] fulfills every word in his own time I
[1:04:53] think of how the Prophet baptizing
[1:04:55] brother Billy Paul he said oh God let
[1:04:57] Hope look over the banister of time
[1:05:00] right now brother brandom would sit
[1:05:02] there and baptize others and say here
[1:05:04] stands A Mother's Prayer that's been
[1:05:07] answered Hallelujah yes sir amen that's
[1:05:10] why we pray our prayers are not hope so
[1:05:13] our prayers are I know I'm a Believer I
[1:05:16] know where I'm standing with God and he
[1:05:18] said ask the father anything in my name
[1:05:20] and I'll do it that's right
[1:05:23] Goode verse n and they sung a new
[1:05:28] song Oh My Thou Art Worthy to take the
[1:05:32] book and to open the seals thereof so
[1:05:35] notice there come a change for thou was
[1:05:38] slain Hast redeemed us to God by thy
[1:05:41] blood out of every Kindred tongue people
[1:05:45] and nation and has made us unto our Gods
[1:05:49] Kings and Priests and we shall reign on
[1:05:53] Earth you're a king because he's made
[1:05:56] you a king that's right A King is a
[1:05:59] ruler that's right you're ruling over
[1:06:02] sin the flesh the devil and the world
[1:06:06] right now Hallelujah yes sir you're a
[1:06:08] king right now and you're also a priest
[1:06:11] you're bringing spiritual sacrifices
[1:06:13] unto
[1:06:15] God not just with your lips but with
[1:06:17] your
[1:06:18] life amen even in the moments and times
[1:06:21] that we don't feel like it but yet in
[1:06:23] our life there's a praise that's going
[1:06:25] up right are you hearing me now saying
[1:06:28] with a loud voice notice and I be heard
[1:06:31] I beheld and I heard the voice of many
[1:06:34] angels round about the throne and the
[1:06:36] Beast and the elders and the number of
[1:06:38] them was 10,000 times 10,000 and
[1:06:41] thousands of thousands saying with a
[1:06:43] loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was
[1:06:45] slain to receive power and riches and
[1:06:48] wisdom and strength and honor and glory
[1:06:51] and blessing and every creature which is
[1:06:54] in heaven and on the earth and under the
[1:06:56] Earth and such as are in the sea and all
[1:06:59] them that are therein heard I saying
[1:07:03] blessing and honor and glory and power
[1:07:06] be unto them that Seth on the throne and
[1:07:09] unto the lamb forever and
[1:07:13] ever
[1:07:15] amen John is worshiping here as he said
[1:07:20] unto him that sth on the throne and unto
[1:07:22] the lamb it's not two different people
[1:07:26] it's the same almighty God that has
[1:07:29] stepped down in
[1:07:32] Redemption
[1:07:33] hallelujah it's God become one of
[1:07:38] us and John is rejoicing oh my let me
[1:07:42] tell you something when John is writing
[1:07:44] this in Revelations 5 under inspiration
[1:07:48] John is caught up in the spirit yes he
[1:07:51] is he's in the spirit and he's receiving
[1:07:56] Revelation oh my he's hearing what's
[1:07:59] going on let me tell you that's why when
[1:08:01] I hear the word of the message of the
[1:08:03] hour I do not hear a word of defeat I do
[1:08:07] not hear a word of Doom and
[1:08:10] Gloom come on I hear a word that there
[1:08:13] is power in the blood of the Lamb amen
[1:08:17] Worthy is the Lamb to receive Power
[1:08:19] Glory and Honor you know what that says
[1:08:21] I ascribe Authority unto the lamb that
[1:08:24] he is more than enough to achieve and do
[1:08:28] what he said he will do he doesn't need
[1:08:31] man's intuition doesn't need man's
[1:08:34] thoughts he just needs his word to be
[1:08:38] received and believed and his word will
[1:08:40] perform itself I said Worthy is the
[1:08:44] Lamb oh my think of it John went from
[1:08:47] weeping to
[1:08:50] rejoicing he started out this chapter
[1:08:52] weeping
[1:08:55] Hey listen when God got a hold of our
[1:08:56] life we started out weeping right right
[1:09:00] we can go some other places in the
[1:09:01] scripture but let's just say here we had
[1:09:03] to start our weeping but notice who is
[1:09:05] it that changed our weeping to rejoicing
[1:09:08] who is it that turn my mour into
[1:09:12] dancing who is it that gave me oil for
[1:09:16] Joy instead of mourning who is it that
[1:09:18] gave me Beauty for Ashes who is it that
[1:09:21] took away the Garment of heaviness and
[1:09:23] gave me a Garment of

[1:09:49] the message the breach 303 he said talk
[1:09:52] about a happy time when them seals broke

[1:10:04] representation he saw his theoy he saw
[1:10:08] himself he saw his true
[1:10:10] identity what revealed his true identity

[1:14:17] and I Calvary seems like a simple term
[1:14:21] it seems like a term that would be
[1:14:23] presented well that's presented in all
[1:14:24] the churches no it's not this reality
[1:14:28] back to our sunship as Sons and
[1:14:30] Daughters of God it goes much deeper
[1:14:33] than us looking upon the cross and say
[1:14:35] thank you Lord for paying the price I'm
[1:14:38] glad that somebody came down and they
[1:14:39] paid the price but you see the reality
[1:14:42] that God does for you and I is break
[1:14:45] back the veil to realize you are a son
[1:14:48] and daughter of God and you are called

[1:14:54] life

[1:15:35] finished word you were Justified you see
[1:15:37] this word has taking you and I back back
[1:15:42] before Genesis 1 back into the back part
[1:15:45] of God's
[1:15:46] mind and when we can see that that
[1:15:49] reality then there is nothing when that
[1:15:51] is anchored in our heart there's nothing
[1:15:53] nothing present nor to come height nor
[1:15:56] death nothing can separate us from the

[1:19:23] no sir I can be walking and many times
[1:19:27] walking or driving down the road it's
[1:19:29] even in those moments you begin to think
[1:19:31] of the goodness of the Lord think about
[1:19:34] God's mercy think about him think about
[1:19:37] the word is the word you're hearing the
[1:19:39] word being preached and you're listening
[1:19:41] to it you're drawing from the devotions
[1:19:43] as you're reading the scriptures and
[1:19:44] then as you just go to start thinking on
[1:19:46] him my there's a praise that starts to
[1:19:48] bring up in your life is that right H
[1:19:53] yes sir right oh
[1:19:55] my oh brother Samuel I'd be careful
[1:19:58] about that you might keep your hands on
[1:20:00] the wheel well I'm not advise anybody to
[1:20:01] take their hands off the wheel but you
[1:20:03] remember when brother Hoover was here
[1:20:04] and I've heard brother Hoover tell this
[1:20:05] a number of times even when we were with
[1:20:08] him there in Jeffersonville of how then
[1:20:09] when brother Brandon would finally come
[1:20:11] out after being gone away from the in
[1:20:13] the meetings and after then fighting all
[1:20:15] those Devils when he would come home
[1:20:16] finally when he would come out and they
[1:20:18] knew at that time get the kids together
[1:20:19] we're going for a ride in the country
[1:20:21] and brother Bron would begin to testify
[1:20:23] of the goodness of God and you know what
[1:20:25] brother Bown never testified of it of I
[1:20:27] I did this or I did that but he
[1:20:29] testified I was there and saw the Lord
[1:20:32] do this I saw the Lord do this and as
[1:20:36] brother brand begin to testify even how
[1:20:39] that you know the sister would record it
[1:20:41] oh my here she would at that time in the
[1:20:43] presence of God she'd begin to speak in
[1:20:46] tongues and then you'd find brother
[1:20:47] randam his hands going up when he was
[1:20:49] driving and on those roads friends I
[1:20:51] know them roads then roads curvy up and
[1:20:54] down you think it's it's hard enough
[1:20:56] with two hands on the wheel and what I'm
[1:20:58] trying to say to you is is that in that
[1:21:01] moment of praise and thanksgiving for
[1:21:03] what God has done I believe listen to me
[1:21:06] now I believe that we can be so caught
[1:21:09] up in the presence of God that God will
[1:21:11] guide you through problems on your job
[1:21:13] God will guide you through problems in
[1:21:15] your home if you will begin to think of
[1:21:18] his faithfulness of his goodness he'll
[1:21:21] guide you in the sharp terms he'll guide
[1:21:23] you in the UPS he'll guide you in the
[1:21:26] Downs glory be to
[1:21:30] God hallelujah Make a Joyful Noise unto
[1:21:34] him with Psalms for the Lord is a great
[1:21:39] God and a great king Above All Gods he
[1:21:44] Psalms
[1:21:45] 921 it is a good
[1:21:48] thing to give thanks unto the
[1:21:51] Lord and to sing praises unto thy name
[1:21:55] oh most high now watch this to show
[1:21:58] forth thy loving
[1:22:00] kindness in the
[1:22:02] morning and thy
[1:22:05] faithfulness every
[1:22:07] night now notice this it's a good thing
[1:22:09] to give thanks unto the Lord to sing
[1:22:12] praise unto his name oh most high to
[1:22:14] show forth thy loving kindness which is
[1:22:17] his own life in the morning and thy
[1:22:20] faithfulness every night
[1:22:23] so in the morning you know it's no hard
[1:22:25] it's not hard to see things in the
[1:22:28] morning
[1:22:30] time many times you know depending on
[1:22:33] where you live you can see things you
[1:22:35] sat there at times Everything's kind of
[1:22:37] dark but then all of a sudden you start
[1:22:39] seeing that Sunrise then there's things
[1:22:41] that you start to see and you start to
[1:22:43] see little things that even sometimes
[1:22:45] even we've been out in the woods and out
[1:22:47] there real early and then you start
[1:22:49] looking at things you hear things moving
[1:22:51] you're out there you know cuz you go out
[1:22:53] in the dark if you're going to hunt in
[1:22:54] the morning and you go out there and
[1:22:55] you're looking and all of a sudden you
[1:22:56] think is that what is that I'm seeing is
[1:22:59] that a dog or is that a deer you know I
[1:23:02] mean you can only shoot at a certain
[1:23:03] legal time you know but still when you
[1:23:04] can shoot it's just 30 minutes before 30
[1:23:07] minutes right after there a 30 minutes
[1:23:08] before Sunrise yeah so when we look at
[1:23:10] it there's things that you can see so
[1:23:13] clearly in the morning but in the
[1:23:15] nighttime when you can't see things real
[1:23:20] clearly this is the time he says Thy
[1:23:22] Faithfulness it's a time we can declare
[1:23:26] not only the dawn that has arose the
[1:23:28] morning the light that has come in our
[1:23:30] life but what about in the night times
[1:23:32] in your life what about in the times of
[1:23:35] night times that's right the times to
[1:23:37] where when everything despair everything
[1:23:39] else is going around this is also a time
[1:23:42] to show forth his life but Samuel what
[1:23:44] are you saying that A Joyful Noise isn't
[1:23:47] always about the
[1:23:48] morning A Joyful Noise is at all times
[1:23:52] David said I Will Bless The Lord at all
[1:23:56] times at all times is that right so
[1:24:01] notice as it goes on upon an instrument
[1:24:03] of 10 strings upon the sultry upon the
[1:24:05] heart with a solemn sound for thou Lord
[1:24:08] Hast made me glad notice thou Hast made
[1:24:11] me glad through thy work I will Triumph
[1:24:14] in the works of thy hands oh Lord how
[1:24:18] great are thy works and thy thoughts are
[1:24:20] very deep now it with this in mind
[1:24:24] because when we're reading this here in
[1:24:25] the scripture Make a Joyful Noise unto
[1:24:28] the Lord I think those are things that's
[1:24:29] resonating in your heart right now that
[1:24:31] you realize that that Joy itself comes
[1:24:34] from knowing what God has done for
[1:24:37] you you are a partaker of his life and
[1:24:43] with being a partaker of his life you
[1:24:45] see how every one of us are all
[1:24:47] different I and I understand there's we
[1:24:48] can get excited we can go uh you know
[1:24:51] sometimes we reach way we would respond
[1:24:53] to different things but I just want to
[1:24:54] say it in this way right here that God
[1:24:57] has not made it so that every one of us
[1:24:59] act exactly just
[1:25:02] alike God's not done it that way no he
[1:25:05] has that's why I don't pray for people
[1:25:07] if well you know they're a little bit
[1:25:08] timid let's pray that they'll be
[1:25:10] boisterous I don't pray for that because
[1:25:12] God's made us the way he wanted us it's
[1:25:15] no more praise if you're not timid than
[1:25:18] it is if you are and so forth are you
[1:25:21] hearing me I'm talking about something
[1:25:23] of a depth that where we look at that if
[1:25:26] there's a shout like we've been looking
[1:25:28] at there is a substance to this are you
[1:25:32] with me John just wasn't you know John
[1:25:35] just wasn't around a situation but John
[1:25:37] notice when he saw the 4 and20 Elders he
[1:25:40] heard all the Angels heard all the
[1:25:41] worshiping what John was worshiping was
[1:25:45] not because the Angels were worshiping
[1:25:47] John was not worshiping because the 4
[1:25:50] and20 Elders were worshiping Shing John
[1:25:53] was worshiping because he saw himself
[1:25:58] that's
[1:25:59] right so John's worship was based on his
[1:26:03] own
[1:26:05] experience are you hearing me brother
[1:26:08] Samuel yeah what are you saying I'm
[1:26:10] saying that's how it must be when it is
[1:26:12] like that you'll be able to show his
[1:26:14] loving kindness not only in the morning
[1:26:17] but in the night
[1:26:19] time when pressures and everything else
[1:26:21] come around so I want want to just say
[1:26:22] it like this that you know I realize
[1:26:24] that some that might be very timid may
[1:26:26] not be real loud I know that listen
[1:26:28] friends I can stand right here it
[1:26:30] doesn't bother me I've preached in
[1:26:31] places now you know not everybody's
[1:26:33] expressive as we are as an assembly
[1:26:35] that's okay and neither would I want to
[1:26:37] try to make us them or them or them us I
[1:26:39] I don't want no formal Spirit coming in
[1:26:41] here that's right I'm sorry I don't want
[1:26:43] no formal spirit I I want listen I
[1:26:46] believe that the Church of the Living
[1:26:47] God ought to be led by the spirit of the
[1:26:50] Living God the prophet said that the
[1:26:52] Holy Ghost is to reign in the camp of
[1:26:55] the children of God and there is to be
[1:26:57] spontaneous
[1:26:59] worship that's a direct quote now what
[1:27:02] does that mean that means as God is
[1:27:05] moving upon lives
[1:27:08] personally right are you hearing me now
[1:27:12] now when I say it like that you may not
[1:27:14] be the one that maybe shouts the loudest
[1:27:17] you may not be one that really shouts
[1:27:19] right out but you know let me just tell
[1:27:22] you you something right now you've got a
[1:27:24] part and let me just tell you your part
[1:27:25] in a Joyful Noise the prophet speaks of
[1:27:28] this of the Throne of God Among Us and
[1:27:31] he says it like this in the Revelation
[1:27:33] series he said out of this Throne you
[1:27:35] know our Thunder's voice and voices and
[1:27:37] Lightnings he said oh there's voices how
[1:27:39] we need in Jeffersonville thousands of
[1:27:43] lived voices the Thunder of God
[1:27:47] thundering out in sweetness and Holiness
[1:27:51] purity undefiled lives walking around in
[1:27:55] the Earth today without a blemish yes
[1:27:57] sir real Christians that's Thunder
[1:28:00] against the
[1:28:01] enemy I'm talking about a Joyful Noise
[1:28:04] that's right every one of us are called
[1:28:07] to
[1:28:09] this the devil don't care how loud you
[1:28:12] can
[1:28:14] holler the devil don't care how much you
[1:28:16] can jump how much you can do this or
[1:28:19] shout but what hurts the devil is to see
[1:28:23] that Sanctified holy life consecrated to
[1:28:26] God yes sir now watch this say anything
[1:28:29] to him call him
[1:28:31] anything just as sweet as it can be and
[1:28:34] move right
[1:28:36] on that's thunder yeah that's a Joyful
[1:28:39] Noise unto the Lord that's good
[1:28:43] hallelujah oh my it'll take the temper
[1:28:45] out of an
[1:28:48] Irishman
[1:28:49] Glory oh it moves down Make a Joyful
[1:28:53] Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands oh
[1:28:55] brother BR said that throws evil way
[1:28:58] that's the Thunder that shakes the
[1:29:01] devil so I want to say we're called to
[1:29:04] live my next point a thankful
[1:29:09] life to live out a thankful life Paul
[1:29:11] said in Colossians 3 let the peace of
[1:29:14] God rule in your hearts to the which
[1:29:17] also you are called in one body and be
[1:29:20] you thankful
[1:29:23] now you where in the
[1:29:25] scriptures the Bible tells us as the
[1:29:28] Lord Jesus he was
[1:29:31] going out of the midst of Jerusalem
[1:29:33] there were 10
[1:29:35] lepers and these 10 lepers begin to call
[1:29:38] out to him now I want you to notice
[1:29:40] there's 10 of them and they call out to
[1:29:43] him and they ask him Jesus have mercy on
[1:29:48] us so they altto together they call out
[1:29:51] and they
[1:29:53] realize that he's able to help them now
[1:29:56] I want you to in the scripture I'm not I
[1:29:59] don't have this up there but I want you
[1:30:00] to think of this for a moment the Bible
[1:30:03] says that when Jesus Jesus turned and
[1:30:05] when he saw
[1:30:07] them now you realize they had
[1:30:10] leprosy brother Brian turn me down in
[1:30:13] these monitors just a little bit just a
[1:30:16] hair when he saw them he had to be close
[1:30:20] enough to see them
[1:30:22] right so sin ain't never intimidated
[1:30:26] Jesus that's that's right he had to be
[1:30:29] close enough to see him hey the Bible
[1:30:30] said that that many of them of the
[1:30:33] publicans and whatever more in the
[1:30:34] beginning of Luke 15 they came to him
[1:30:37] now they didn't come to him because
[1:30:38] Jesus was a compromiser but neither was
[1:30:41] Jesus shoot shooting machine guns at him
[1:30:42] as they were walking up to him but it
[1:30:45] was the
[1:30:46] life the presence of God the atmosphere
[1:30:49] let me tell you something friends what's
[1:30:50] more powerful than any words that you
[1:30:51] you and I could say is the
[1:30:54] atmosphere brother BR sister create an
[1:30:57] atmosphere that they'll drop
[1:31:01] into
[1:31:02] hallelujah oh my now notice he he he
[1:31:05] don't even he don't walk over to him
[1:31:07] brother Brian he didn't walk over to him
[1:31:08] and lay hands on him and said come on up
[1:31:09] here I want to pray for you we believe
[1:31:11] in laying on hands but he didn't do that
[1:31:13] he told him this is what he said he said
[1:31:16] go show yourself unto the
[1:31:19] priest and the Bible say says as they
[1:31:22] went on their way they got up and went
[1:31:25] on their way and as they went they were
[1:31:31] healed didn't even lay hands on them but
[1:31:34] the word spoken in the situation Jesus
[1:31:38] have mercy on
[1:31:40] me that's 10 of them you know 10's a
[1:31:44] worldly number 10's a carnal
[1:31:48] number is that right come on now
[1:31:52] but notice nine of them kept on going
[1:31:55] but there was one of them that turn came
[1:31:57] back he began to look he begin to see my
[1:32:01] walks changed maybe my ear this has come
[1:32:04] back my nose has come back there's been
[1:32:06] things restored to me that I had lost
[1:32:09] you know he he was thankful you know but
[1:32:11] the rest of them oh they went on they
[1:32:13] never returned back to give thanks and
[1:32:16] you say well why would God God knowing
[1:32:18] all things why would God heal them
[1:32:21] knowing they weren't going to go on and
[1:32:23] follow him because God loves Humanity
[1:32:27] that is good preaching yes
[1:32:30] sir yes the nine went on didn't bother
[1:32:33] Jesus he didn't lose one ounce of virtue
[1:32:36] as far as healing in terms of oh that's
[1:32:38] nine less people that can be healed it's
[1:32:41] already paid for there was one that came
[1:32:44] back and begin to give thanks the Bible
[1:32:48] said when he saw he was healed he turned
[1:32:51] back and and he glorified with a loud
[1:32:53] voice glorified God and he fell down at
[1:32:56] his feet and gave him
[1:33:01] thanks oh my you see how many I think
[1:33:05] when I look at through the prophet's
[1:33:08] life I think of over the years there's
[1:33:09] been people that's come and gone even
[1:33:12] when we were in the little church there
[1:33:13] at Gary Avenue remember seeing people
[1:33:15] get out of wheelchairs and services
[1:33:17] powerful things never went on to serve
[1:33:19] the
[1:33:20] Lord as far as knowing what you know I
[1:33:23] don't know really they what what they
[1:33:24] knew or where they were at they never
[1:33:25] walked maybe on into truth I don't even
[1:33:27] know if they went on to serve the Lord
[1:33:29] but I this is what I want to say to you
[1:33:31] is that when we look at it the reason
[1:33:34] that the Bible says serve the Lord with
[1:33:36] gladness we're not serving the lord out
[1:33:39] of
[1:33:40] Duty this this one returned back he
[1:33:43] didn't do it because he had to he
[1:33:45] returned back because he was thankful am
[1:33:48] you know what he did he recognized God
[1:33:51] was in in Christ he not only recognized
[1:33:54] and it heard about all the Miracles as
[1:33:57] the other nine had but he recognize
[1:34:00] right here this is none other than
[1:34:03] almighty God come down Among Us and you
[1:34:06] know what he was doing he was entering
[1:34:08] into his courts with Thanksgiving he was
[1:34:11] entering into his presence into the
[1:34:15] gates into the courts with a
[1:34:17] thankfulness in his heart you said
[1:34:19] brother Samuel how does that translate
[1:34:21] into a thankful life because you realize
[1:34:24] that it's by grace through faith that
[1:34:25] you're saved you can't work yourself to
[1:34:28] ever be we've read this already you
[1:34:30] can't work yourself to ever be good
[1:34:32] enough but it's by Grace you are saved
[1:34:35] and once you are saved Works themselves
[1:34:38] are in
[1:34:40] appreciation gratitude thankfulness for
[1:34:43] what he has done for you that's right oh
[1:34:47] my so we can see when we look at this in
[1:34:50] the scripture that's why why that in
[1:34:52] every part of our life every day of
[1:34:56] Thanksgiving is that right Jehovah
[1:34:58] Miracles brother bamon we are your
[1:35:00] people we're not under any bondage we're
[1:35:02] free the son has made us free we're free
[1:35:05] indeed to serve our Lord our Lord and
[1:35:07] our father we thank thee Oh you talk
[1:35:10] about a Thanksgiving Day for Freedom
[1:35:12] every day is a Thanksgiving Day every
[1:35:15] hours of Thanksgiving Day oh I who was
[1:35:19] once blind can now see I once was a
[1:35:22] sinner and now saved oh God how free we
[1:35:25] are how we can give you Thanksgiving and
[1:35:28] Thanksgiving from our heart that Jesus
[1:35:30] Christ the son of God is not dead but
[1:35:33] he's alive among us tonight proving
[1:35:36] himself alive so our Thanksgiving is not
[1:35:39] confined to a
[1:35:42] day is that right we recognize what that
[1:35:46] was all about is that right the woman
[1:35:49] fled the Bible tells us in the the
[1:35:51] Romans in Revelations 12 we realize what
[1:35:54] this was all
[1:35:55] about are you hearing me I'm not talking
[1:35:58] about now this modern history stuff I'm
[1:36:00] talking about the
[1:36:02] Bible the reason they came to pmth rock
[1:36:05] they were running from that Roman
[1:36:06] Catholic Spirit sure in order that they
[1:36:10] might worship God in
[1:36:12] Freedom it had pervaded and made its way
[1:36:15] into the church of England the angling
[1:36:17] church had went all around you there and
[1:36:19] let me just tell you when you begin to
[1:36:21] go back and study history you realize it
[1:36:23] wasn't just one short snapshot Journey
[1:36:25] these were people that actually time and
[1:36:28] time again tried to leave some of the
[1:36:31] first times were down there I believe in
[1:36:33] a ship right next to Turkey but notice
[1:36:36] they were ratted out and brought off of
[1:36:37] that ship and rock back right back into
[1:36:39] England but let me tell you something
[1:36:41] there was something in their heart let
[1:36:43] me tell you something it was more than
[1:36:45] their DNA it was prophecy that was to be
[1:36:48] fulfilled yes sir it was people that
[1:36:51] were Longing For
[1:36:53] Freedom are you hearing me it wasn't a
[1:36:56] freedom where I can just do what I want
[1:36:58] to do their freedom that they were
[1:37:00] thinking about was a freedom to serve
[1:37:05] God that's why they came here it want
[1:37:09] the freedom because they had an attitude
[1:37:11] against of England or attitude about
[1:37:13] this that is not what they came about
[1:37:16] that would still be
[1:37:17] bondage because you can be over here and
[1:37:20] still be bondage Happ hatred in your
[1:37:21] heart right here from somebody across
[1:37:23] the sea that's right come on you can
[1:37:26] still be bound from things from years
[1:37:28] ago if you don't allow the blood of
[1:37:30] Jesus Christ to give you Grace to go
[1:37:32] down in the depths of your life and
[1:37:34] bring healing and deliver you from that
[1:37:36] complex you can hold things in your
[1:37:40] life but there's Grace that can go down
[1:37:42] in your life that you can have a
[1:37:44] Thanksgiving a continual Thanksgiving a
[1:37:47] continual working of the word brother
[1:37:49] Samuel what do I do do exactly like the
[1:37:51] 10 lepers did oh it's true in your life
[1:37:55] you can be completely liberated from sin
[1:37:58] set on fire by the spirit of God Christ
[1:38:00] as the love of your life and how the
[1:38:02] word will come right down in your life
[1:38:03] and reveal certain things that are still
[1:38:06] hidden there maybe things that are put
[1:38:08] out maybe there was a a complex about
[1:38:10] this and God in his own time goes down
[1:38:13] in there and begins to bring those
[1:38:15] things forth do you realize I can't find
[1:38:17] mine you can't find yours but David said
[1:38:20] he hath turned my
[1:38:23] sackcloth he hath turned my morning into
[1:38:26] dancing he hath done this it takes God
[1:38:29] to reveal those areas in our life and
[1:38:32] then it's God as we submit it's God that
[1:38:35] turns the morning to dancing it's God
[1:38:37] that removes the sackcloth it's God that
[1:38:39] heals the complexes it's God that heals
[1:38:42] the wounds in the spirit it's God who
[1:38:44] does
[1:38:45] that and then I got just even more to
[1:38:47] thank him
[1:38:49] for thank you Lord Jesus
[1:38:53] oh brother Samuel that's a scar but you
[1:38:54] know what a scar is it's a sign you've
[1:38:56] been
[1:38:58] healed and I'm not living by my scar I
[1:39:00] ain't posting my scar hey everybody look
[1:39:03] at me let me post it on Instagram look
[1:39:05] at my scar look at this no no no as a
[1:39:08] child of God we are thankful for the
[1:39:10] grace of God that I'm no longer in
[1:39:14] bondage to
[1:39:18] that and let me end with this
[1:39:22] give thanks at all
[1:39:26] times if there's one that can be
[1:39:30] challenging it's this right
[1:39:32] here but you
[1:39:35] see in every
[1:39:37] situation it's not that every situation
[1:39:40] as we read here in the scripture in
[1:39:42] everything give thanks for this is the
[1:39:45] will of God in Christ Jesus concerning
[1:39:47] you it's not saying that
[1:39:50] everything the thing is thankworthy
[1:39:52] that's not what we're giving thanks
[1:39:54] about that's right we're giving thanks
[1:39:57] unto the
[1:39:58] Lord that Lord I don't know how all of
[1:40:02] this is going to come
[1:40:03] out but I know I'm
[1:40:06] yours I don't know how you're going to
[1:40:08] work all this out but I know I'm yours
[1:40:12] you know I just heard brother brandham
[1:40:13] here just just the other day brother
[1:40:16] baram is there and he's preaching on
[1:40:18] wings of a snow white dove and at the
[1:40:20] very end of that message brother Bram is
[1:40:22] so confident he's looking for his
[1:40:26] healing to come in this Dimension he
[1:40:29] makes the statement I don't know how
[1:40:30] it's going to happen I don't know how I
[1:40:33] don't know when but it's settled it's
[1:40:36] settled now it wasn't that he didn't get
[1:40:38] healed he just did not receive his
[1:40:40] healing in this
[1:40:43] Dimension good it would be in a few days
[1:40:46] where he would step across that dividing
[1:40:49] line of Time and Eternity right amen
[1:40:51] when he stepped from this body into that
[1:40:54] body there was no more stomach
[1:40:58] condition no more every seven years no
[1:41:01] more no more of that you know we all
[1:41:04] experience those every sevene Cycles but
[1:41:06] notice in everything give
[1:41:11] thanks now you know I know this is very
[1:41:15] simple but how many want your faith to
[1:41:17] be
[1:41:19] strengthened okay about five of of you
[1:41:21] 10 of
[1:41:25] you I want my faith to be strengthened
[1:41:27] don't
[1:41:29] you you know scientific research within
[1:41:32] this I'm going to read you something in
[1:41:34] a minute but scientific
[1:41:36] research actually shows your brain
[1:41:39] cannot produce chemicals for
[1:41:41] gratitude and anxiety at the same
[1:41:46] time
[1:41:48] wow think of that
[1:41:53] cannot produce gratitude and anxiety at
[1:41:56] the same time now let me ask you this
[1:41:57] question I wonder how I wonder what Paul
[1:42:00] and Silas were looking at when they were
[1:42:03] in that
[1:42:05] jail you see I understand sometimes when
[1:42:08] we look at things that we could think oh
[1:42:10] my this just something you know that
[1:42:12] Paul and Silas they just got all work no
[1:42:14] they just didn't get all worked
[1:42:16] up what what I've delivered to you here
[1:42:19] this morning is the same thing they had
[1:42:21] in their life you've got the same
[1:42:23] experience and if you don't you can have
[1:42:25] it this morning to where they can make a
[1:42:28] Joyful Noise unto the
[1:42:30] Lord when they came in there notice it
[1:42:33] was even their life that was a
[1:42:38] testimony their life was a
[1:42:41] testimony if I can say it like this it
[1:42:43] wasn't because they were the best
[1:42:45] singers that caused the Philippian
[1:42:47] Jailer to say hey I want what y'all got
[1:42:50] cuz y'all all really know how to sing
[1:42:52] nope that ain't what it
[1:42:54] was what was it well me saying Brother
[1:42:57] Sam you saying they weren't singing no
[1:42:58] they were singing it was something that
[1:43:00] was evident within their life that they
[1:43:04] were a part of to think about it
[1:43:05] individuals who were in
[1:43:07] bondage who had been beaten but they
[1:43:11] begin to worship about the Midnight
[1:43:16] Hour no wonder David could say I'm going
[1:43:19] to wake up and give you thanks in the
[1:43:21] Midnight Hour in other words at the
[1:43:24] first Breaking of Day Lord I want to
[1:43:27] give you
[1:43:28] thanks I know I'm not putting any un
[1:43:30] unbearable burden on some of you like
[1:43:32] good Lord midnight I'm just going to bed
[1:43:33] right then well it gives you a chance to
[1:43:35] give praise for you lay
[1:43:36] down but think about it even when we get
[1:43:39] up of a morning I wonder how many times
[1:43:41] when we roll out of bed of a morning we
[1:43:43] say oh Lord Jesus not another
[1:43:48] Monday not another week
[1:43:51] now our flesh feels like that right
[1:43:54] right our flesh feels like that I don't
[1:43:56] think anybody jumps out of the bed and
[1:43:57] says wo man I'm going to work this
[1:44:02] morning but you know in everything you
[1:44:04] can give things Lord thank you at least
[1:44:06] I got a job that's right that's right
[1:44:09] thank you Lord for giving me rest thank
[1:44:10] you for blessing me Lord with a good
[1:44:12] mind thank you Lord for giving me favor
[1:44:14] Lord thank you Father in everything give
[1:44:19] thanks Hallelujah
[1:44:21] now here's the
[1:44:23] reason brother BR talks about in his own
[1:44:25] self with that nervous condition he says
[1:44:28] I don't say too much about it around
[1:44:30] people this is what he says in uniting
[1:44:32] time and sign maybe I I'll read it to
[1:44:34] you he says I do not try to say too much
[1:44:36] about it you know around people
[1:44:40] complaining because I think one of the
[1:44:43] horriblest things is to see a man or
[1:44:46] woman that's
[1:44:48] constantly what's it say
[1:44:53] complaining yeah we all can say that one
[1:44:55] help me
[1:44:57] Jesus I've always thought God keep me
[1:45:01] from
[1:45:02] it that weakens Faith all the
[1:45:08] time what does
[1:45:13] complaining complaining that's wow
[1:45:17] that's true we got things we can
[1:45:18] complain about
[1:45:22] but Paul said like this he said I will
[1:45:25] glory in mine infirmities I didn't mean
[1:45:28] I I'm sure listen friends I'm sure Paul
[1:45:30] wasn't bubble dancing i a what Paul was
[1:45:33] talking about Paul's not talking about
[1:45:34] let me get worked up let me get I got to
[1:45:36] get then I got to get it no no no but
[1:45:39] Paul recognized that you know what that
[1:45:42] even though things are all around me
[1:45:44] that's taking place I'm going to make a
[1:45:47] Joyful Noise unto the
[1:45:49] Lord I'm going to going to worship God
[1:45:51] I'm going to I'm going to Worship the
[1:45:53] Lord I'm not going to let these things
[1:45:55] dictate my
[1:45:57] life are you hearing me there's times
[1:46:00] where reports can come fear can try to
[1:46:02] strike us sadness can try to strike us
[1:46:05] despair things that literally can knock
[1:46:07] the wind out of
[1:46:09] yourselves but if we can say God help me
[1:46:13] help me not to complain help me to
[1:46:15] remember that though I see these things
[1:46:18] around you've never failed me Lord
[1:46:21] you've never failed me Lord Lord I give
[1:46:24] you thanks right
[1:46:25] now when everything was taken from job
[1:46:29] the first infraction the Bible said he
[1:46:33] bowed his head and worshiped
[1:46:38] God the condition was not thankworthy
[1:46:42] but God was worthy of
[1:46:45] thanks when it happened the second part
[1:46:47] happened once again job worshiped and
[1:46:51] gave God thanks I say thanks be to God
[1:46:54] for his Mercy aren't you no wonder the
[1:46:58] Bible says rejoice in the lord always
[1:47:01] and again I say rejoice in Eep in
[1:47:03] Philippians 4:4 let your moderation be
[1:47:05] known unto all men the Lord is at hand
[1:47:08] be careful for nothing but in everything
[1:47:13] by prayer and
[1:47:15] supplication with
[1:47:17] Thanksgiving let your request be made
[1:47:20] known unto
[1:47:23] God be anxious for
[1:47:27] nothing I'm glad that he's a reliever of
[1:47:30] that aren't
[1:47:31] you I got another part I can't even go
[1:47:34] into it here the one thing I just want
[1:47:36] to add to that to say what I'm thankful
[1:47:39] for right at the beginning of the week
[1:47:41] and just just meditate and just strike
[1:47:43] Lord I'm thankful there's a
[1:47:44] place where I can let off the
[1:47:47] pressure I'm thankful there's a safety
[1:47:49] place
[1:47:51] that I can go and let off the pressure
[1:47:53] and matter of fact I don't leave and go
[1:47:55] out of this safety Place once you've
[1:47:56] ever come in to Christ he's brought you
[1:47:59] in you don't ever come out you don't
[1:48:01] ever go out and come back in you come
[1:48:04] into a place of safety this City of
[1:48:06] Refuge I don't want to leave no more I
[1:48:08] want to dwell here but you realize
[1:48:11] within dwelling there he's the place
[1:48:14] that I can let off the pressure because
[1:48:17] pressure itself brother Bram says it
[1:48:19] like this he says it makes the bad act
[1:48:22] that way it makes the good act that way
[1:48:25] it makes these churches out here act
[1:48:27] that way and he says it makes the
[1:48:29] Tabernacle act that way what is it
[1:48:33] pressure now no doubt some of you
[1:48:36] sisters had your pressure cooker going
[1:48:38] for
[1:48:39] Thanksgiving or maybe your up to-date
[1:48:44] instapot that is the classic around our
[1:48:48] house and you know my feelings on it
[1:48:50] it's not as
[1:48:52] instant it's pretty good though it can
[1:48:54] make some pretty good ribs and things
[1:48:55] like that but let's get to the
[1:48:58] point when it's done and all of a sudden
[1:49:01] I I'm sitting there in the office or
[1:49:03] maybe I've come out of the office I'm
[1:49:04] sitting there on the chair and when I
[1:49:06] hear
[1:49:10] that I
[1:49:12] know few more
[1:49:14] moments dinner's going to be
[1:49:18] ready but you see what if there wasn't a
[1:49:21] valve to let off the
[1:49:25] pressure you've got a valve a place to
[1:49:29] let off the
[1:49:30] pressure and I'm thankful for that
[1:49:33] because you and I are living in an
[1:49:36] age there's pressure all
[1:49:40] around our young people face pressure
[1:49:43] that I never even
[1:49:45] faced we're facing pressures that our
[1:49:49] parents Grand grandparents never
[1:49:52] faced that's
[1:49:54] right but in the midst of it
[1:49:56] all I thank
[1:49:59] God for his light for his life for his
[1:50:04] grace that he has made known to us and
[1:50:08] I'm thankful there's a place where we
[1:50:10] can let off the
[1:50:12] pressure where we can there in
[1:50:16] him I'm thankful aren't you yes sir
[1:50:19] absolutely
[1:50:22] Make a Joyful Noise unto the
[1:50:24] Lord in our walk in our life from our
[1:50:28] mouth you realize even as you speak the
[1:50:32] Lord help me on this test you realize
[1:50:34] that's Joyful
[1:50:36] Noise God help me today at work that's
[1:50:39] Joyful Noise Joyful Noise isn't just as
[1:50:42] I said right here Joyful Noise is your
[1:50:46] walk with God the bells and the the
[1:50:50] pomegranates on Aaron's robe moved
[1:50:53] together and it signified there was life
[1:50:56] and you may not be a real boisterous
[1:50:58] person here that's okay I don't want you
[1:51:00] to be a boisterous person I want you to
[1:51:03] be who God made
[1:51:05] you but if you're one to shout the house
[1:51:07] down I want you to shout the house
[1:51:11] down is that all right we are who God
[1:51:14] has made us to
[1:51:16] be but what's important is is that our
[1:51:18] response
[1:51:20] is out of the Thanksgiving of what we've
[1:51:23] experienced right I tell you you might
[1:51:27] have want you you know even for a person
[1:51:29] I've talked to people you have too that
[1:51:31] maybe they've only experienced just a
[1:51:33] little bit where they have repented of
[1:51:35] their sins but man they are thankful I
[1:51:38] remember I was there I was there it's
[1:51:41] something to be thankful for when you
[1:51:42] feel the sin you feel the load lifted

[1:54:27] was drawed up maybe a hand was drawn up
[1:54:30] maybe there were things Lord that maybe
[1:54:32] their ear because we know leprosy it
[1:54:34] just eats eats
[1:54:36] away it's a type of
[1:54:39] sin that God you spoke to him and said
[1:54:43] go show yourself unto the
[1:54:45] priest and as they went and did as you
[1:54:50] said they were
[1:54:52] healed now I don't know how many steps
[1:54:54] they took I don't know I don't know if
[1:54:56] it was 1 2 3 4 I don't know but all I
[1:54:59] know is they walked in
[1:55:00] obedience to what you
[1:55:03] said and your
[1:55:06] word went to
[1:55:08] work in their
[1:55:10] lives Lord we're standing

[1:55:20] million to say Thank You

[1:55:27] Lord I believe you're worthy we say a
[1:55:30] lot of other words we say a lot of
[1:55:33] things Lord
[1:55:35] but we can never praise you enough
[1:55:39] Lord but Lord like your Prophet told us
[1:55:42] in the Hebrew series he said you know
[1:55:45] you can worship God right there in the
[1:55:48] store when you expr Express to somebody
[1:55:50] else isn't it a beautiful day the Lord
[1:55:52] has given us yes sir
[1:55:57] Lord so many opportunities to worship
[1:56:00] you so many opportunities to make a

[1:56:04] Noise that our lives Lord can
[1:56:07] declare your
[1:56:09] goodness your mercy your faithfulness
[1:56:14] Lord granted Lord I pray this morning if
[1:56:17] there's anything
[1:56:18] Lord oh God if it anything at all let it
[1:56:21] be that lord it's you that's been lifted
[1:56:24] up that God every heart and every life
[1:56:27] can
[1:56:28] see see themselves in you Lord even more
[1:56:31] clearly and to realize Lord we're not
[1:56:34] defeated the circumstance we're in right
[1:56:37] now or the situation or the trial that's
[1:56:40] not the defining of our life and who we
[1:56:44] are no more than sin was the definition
[1:56:48] or the defining in of who we
[1:56:50] were but God it's you that
[1:56:55] reveals our
[1:56:57] identity what I know sometimes as young
[1:57:00] people and sometimes middle-aged and
[1:57:01] older too I you still find it especially
[1:57:04] with social media and things all
[1:57:06] together people come under pressure Lord

[1:57:10] feeling they need to have this
[1:57:12] particular name brand or have this all
[1:57:14] these things
[1:57:15] pressures but God I pray if there's any
[1:57:20] place to find our identity it's in
[1:57:24] you it's in
[1:57:27] you you're the one who gives real
[1:57:30] value to our lives

[1:59:56] on my heart in everything give
[2:00:00] thanks I didn't have time to relay and
[2:00:02] it just comes to me you remember the
[2:00:05] scripture says rejoice in the lord
[2:00:06] always I read that to you rejoice in the
[2:00:08] lord always and again I say
[2:00:12] rejoice these were not words that were
[2:00:16] just commands like well just rejoice
[2:00:20] but it's
[2:00:21] recognize where you draw
[2:00:24] from is not the situation or not what's
[2:00:27] taking place but joob where were
[2:00:31] you where were you
[2:00:35] joob going clear back from the
[2:00:37] foundation of the world see it always
[2:00:40] goes go back go back to the foundation
[2:00:42] that's why our Joyful Noise this is not
[2:00:45] a joy that the world has given to us no
[2:00:50] that's why that I I don't have to know
[2:00:52] the outcome of this or how this is going
[2:00:53] to work out or how this is I can just
[2:00:56] say Lord I Thank you for grace for this
[2:00:59] moment I thank you that you're in
[2:01:01] control Lord I Thank you Lord for your
[2:01:04] reminders Lord how you come Lord daily
[2:01:07] and remind me of your goodness Lord I
[2:01:10] Thank you Lord for leading me it's just
[2:01:13] step by step hallu cuz sometimes you're
[2:01:15] not you're not gloring in the end result
[2:01:19] you're giving thanks to
[2:01:23] him so it isn't something we're just
[2:01:25] ignoring like well I'm going to ignore
[2:01:26] this problem that's not what this is but
[2:01:29] it's saying God I don't know how you're
[2:01:31] going to work it out but I'm going to
[2:01:33] continue to give myself to
[2:01:35] you I know one thing in this situation
[2:01:37] I'm going to give myself to you I want
[2:01:39] my attitude I want my thoughts I don't
[2:01:41] want to be a
[2:01:43] complainer I don't want to talk about
[2:01:45] the situation and negative I you know
[2:01:47] sometimes we can talk so much about the
[2:01:50] negative I wonder if we had a meter
[2:01:52] around our house at times I wonder if it
[2:01:54] was a meter that could come up and talk
[2:01:55] about how much was negative and how much
[2:01:57] was positive I think it would scare
[2:01:59] us now you know that talking don't come
[2:02:02] out without there being negative
[2:02:08] thoughts you just begin to think
[2:02:11] about who he is to you Hall what he's
[2:02:15] done for
[2:02:17] you and to know
[2:02:19] like David said the Lord is my
[2:02:23] shepherd I shall not want he leadth me
[2:02:28] beside the Still Waters he maketh me to
[2:02:31] lie down in Green
[2:02:34] Pastures he anointed my head with oil
[2:02:36] aren't you glad he anoints your head

[2:02:41] anoints my head with oil you know what
[2:02:42] that is to keep away the parasites I'm
[2:02:45] glad he anoints my hair my not my hair
[2:02:48] but my head was loyal you say Brother
[2:02:50] Sam way you're talking about I'm glad
[2:02:52] that when I don't have the thoughts that
[2:02:54] are necessary but God

[2:03:00] Bram said you just start to get on your
[2:03:02] mind you need healing in your body I'm
[2:03:04] the Lord that Health thee he said you

[2:03:16] a test or a trial or a situation begin
[2:03:19] to think upon the goodness of God and
[2:03:21] say God I don't know how you're going to
[2:03:23] work this out there's a lot of avenues
[2:03:25] to be cleared out there's a lot of

[2:03:31] enough in

[2:10:40] praise Sunday
[2:10:42] service and the week before Wednesday I
[2:10:45] started experiencing itching on my legs
[2:10:47] and I didn't know what it was so I took
[2:10:49] a benad drill and then I took uh some
[2:10:52] htis hyd cortisone and cream and I
[2:10:54] started and then but instead after Rel
[2:10:57] the uh the alleviation of the cream I
[2:10:59] started itching and then um as the days
[2:11:02] progressed by by Sunday it got too far
[2:11:05] so it started to spread it's in my body
[2:11:07] and so I got to go find out what this is
[2:11:09] so I went to the emergency room Sunday
[2:11:14] morning they administered
[2:11:17] medicine and then I said well it took
[2:11:19] away some alleviation well I said just
[2:11:20] take this and you'll be fine I said it's
[2:11:22] a contact of some sort they didn't know
[2:11:24] I don't know if they knew what it was or
[2:11:25] ever found
[2:11:26] out
[2:11:29] so over the months I've been taking
[2:11:33] shots I've been getting sick things been
[2:11:36] happen but then it would go and uh like
[2:11:38] one uh brother darl war was here my eye
[2:11:41] was infected and I prayed they then they
[2:11:43] prayed for me that night and then all
[2:11:45] they left me they went to Friday when I
[2:11:48] was sick this past Sunday it was
[2:11:50] Wednesday when I started and 5 days L I
[2:11:52] can't stop it I got to make sure this is
[2:11:54] not contagious I said it's just Conta
[2:11:56] you'll be fine it's not contagious so I
[2:11:57] decided to go service Sunday evening but
[2:12:00] at at the hospital do over over the
[2:12:02] times that I've been there I would leave
[2:12:04] and I look and I would see
[2:12:11] people the world's suffering it's crying
[2:12:14] he needs
[2:12:16] help and so I seen children at times I
[2:12:18] said and I wondered and I said where's
[2:12:20] my heart at so this last time I was
[2:12:24] leaving I saw this boy and his mother I
[2:12:26] wrested with us and I kept ring so I
[2:12:30] walked
[2:12:31] over I looked mother in the face I said
[2:12:34] listen I go to church we pray for the
[2:12:36] sick I said you want to pray for your
[2:12:38] boy I said her eyes illuminated said yes
[2:12:42] I looked at the boys in this delirium
[2:12:43] going in and
[2:12:44] out I Lay My Hands On I say a simple
[2:12:47] prayer said God help him just alleviate
[2:12:50] whatever is bothering him I said he's in
[2:12:51] and out he said I don't know what's
[2:12:53] going on but God please help him when I
[2:12:56] was leaving I spun to my left and there
[2:12:58] was a
[2:12:59] man he looked like big Burly fell like 6
[2:13:03] foot 250 pounds and in his face had
[2:13:06] looked at while he was pleading for help
[2:13:10] and I thought I said I thought I didn't
[2:13:12] know whether to perceive that to be
[2:13:14] selfish or maybe that he would want
[2:13:17] prayer too he I believe he heard it and
[2:13:20] I hope that he took that God don't
[2:13:22] forget me but when I saw him I said look
[2:13:26] massive gu said I fell I left I lo I
[2:13:29] walked out I said Lord please be with
[2:13:31] him as well and the people are suffering
[2:13:34] they're and they have more faith than I
[2:13:36] give them credit for they're willing to
[2:13:39] reach out they need everything all
[2:13:41] resources that the devil does to to us
[2:13:44] God has resources to with medicine to
[2:13:47] doctor through science through prayer
[2:13:49] faith and we need everything that we can
[2:13:52] must that God has put in our Arsenal to
[2:13:53] share with others and so I thought when
[2:13:56] I left I said well I miss service but
[2:13:58] then I said wait a minute you can
[2:13:59] archive it how do you know that God
[2:14:01] didn't bring you here for that reason
[2:14:02] for that
[2:14:03] boy so we just want to take a chance we
[2:14:06] don't miss opportunities that God
[2:14:08] presents us that we can reach out to
[2:14:11] someone who may be suffering that we may
[2:14:12] consider ourselves and put ourselves in
[2:14:14] that position and that's what Christ did
[2:14:16] and we want to be the same thing as Sam
[2:14:18] was preaching he said those things as
[2:14:20] said they were just highlighting what I
[2:14:22] was going through what I want to seen I
[2:14:24] said let's not be forgetful that God has
[2:14:26] reached out to us and the Bible also
[2:14:28] says how do you know that you're not the
[2:14:30] hand of Mercy to that the god of hand of
[2:14:32] Mercy to that person who's in need so I
[2:14:34] want to thank God for what he's done for
[2:14:35] me and that the battles and trials may
