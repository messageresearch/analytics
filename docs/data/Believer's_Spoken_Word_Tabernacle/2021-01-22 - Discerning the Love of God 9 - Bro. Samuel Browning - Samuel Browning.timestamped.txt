[35:47] into your hands may you help us lord may
[35:50] you guide us may you speak to our hearts
[35:52] tonight
[35:53] lord minister to every need we pray both
[35:56] in the visible
[35:57] and the invisible audience as well we
[36:00] ask all these things
[36:01] lord for the glory of god in jesus name
[36:04] amen amen one verse of scripture here
[36:07] tonight in first corinthians
[36:09] 13 verse 4.
[36:13] the scripture says charity
[36:17] suffereth long and is kind
[36:21] charity envieth not
[36:24] charity vaunteth not itself is not
[36:28] puffed up and i want to just draw from
[36:31] that i've read from this portion in the
[36:33] amplified
[36:34] bible just to say the time of definition
[36:38] sometimes but just that second part is
[36:40] where we've been looking there
[36:42] is love never is envious
[36:46] nor boils over with jealousy
[36:50] amen may god bless you bless the reading
[36:52] of the word as you're being seated
[36:56] i certainly believe that as we would
[37:00] look at this in the scripture and we've
[37:02] been as the lord has taken us
[37:04] in this for some time we're living in an
[37:08] age that
[37:10] where god has has called us into that
[37:13] place
[37:14] of of the perfect love of god
[37:18] and to where that in an age of such
[37:21] deception
[37:22] an age where we see of such hatred
[37:27] but yet in the midst of that age god
[37:29] would call
[37:30] you and i to a place in perfect love and
[37:34] to
[37:34] manifest that perfect love we realize
[37:38] that
[37:38] in in the time that in the season that
[37:41] we're living in there will
[37:42] always any time that when it's time for
[37:45] the word to be made manifest there's
[37:47] always
[37:48] opposition there's always conditions
[37:51] there's always
[37:52] things that would arise to try to hinder
[37:55] or try to thwart or to come against that
[37:58] but this is where that when we look here
[38:01] in this
[38:02] portion of the scripture there's a lot
[38:04] of things that
[38:05] paul went through that a person could
[38:07] actually
[38:09] do and have quite a i could say quite a
[38:12] resume they could
[38:13] understand all mysteries they could
[38:16] you know just be able to lay everything
[38:18] out perfectly they could even have
[38:21] faith to move mountains so to even be
[38:24] able to tap into a place of faith to
[38:26] move mountains
[38:28] but yet it would not be the qualifying
[38:31] faith of the faith of god which is the
[38:35] love of god
[38:35] in the heart of the of the person or the
[38:39] individual so
[38:40] all of the mighty acts and things that
[38:42] could be done but yet
[38:44] what is the ultimate is that of charity
[38:47] to have that of the love of god
[38:50] that's that's that's the ultimate within
[38:53] any life in any heart
[38:55] and we know that's a that's a great
[38:58] treasure
[38:58] amen for that to be placed within our
[39:01] lives and
[39:02] i want to just just come back into this
[39:04] place in the scripture where we were at
[39:05] last week and
[39:07] ah we we ended here around this around
[39:10] this
[39:11] scripture in proverbs 14 30.
[39:14] and we were just how the lord took us
[39:16] and i certainly
[39:17] just how he took that and went with it
[39:19] but we seen where
[39:21] envy itself is a very very cruel thing
[39:25] uh we whitney you see it there as we
[39:28] begin to take each of those examples and
[39:30] you see through the scripture
[39:32] of how the envy can so get among as it
[39:35] was
[39:36] among uh joseph uh between
[39:40] joseph's brethren and him and then we
[39:42] see even when they came against the lord
[39:44] jesus we see it between cain and abel
[39:46] we've seen it there of lucifer coming
[39:49] against michael and we see it
[39:51] all the way as it it continues to move
[39:53] on down
[39:55] down through the scriptures even where
[39:57] jesus would say
[39:59] that it would come to a place to where
[40:01] he said
[40:02] men he said they will kill you and think
[40:05] they are doing god a service it's john
[40:08] chapter 16. so we find that there is a
[40:12] envy is a very is a very horrible thing
[40:16] it's something that there is no envy
[40:19] within love not within that of perfect
[40:23] love when a
[40:24] person has been born again
[40:27] by the spirit of almighty god that old
[40:30] nature is completely gone
[40:34] and god sets down right in the midst of
[40:37] that life
[40:38] and there is a governance that takes
[40:40] place there's a new ownership there's a
[40:42] new administration
[40:44] there is a new king that is residing
[40:47] there one who is directing that
[40:50] not that temptations are not that things
[40:53] will not
[40:54] come but there is one on the inside
[40:58] who is greater than any temptation
[41:02] and when we look at this in the
[41:03] scripture of proverbs 14 30 it says
[41:06] a sound heart this deals with not just
[41:09] talking of a healthy heart
[41:10] but it's talking in terms of a spiritual
[41:13] condition
[41:14] a sound heart is the life of the flesh
[41:17] and when we look at it you know brother
[41:20] brandon would make many statements and
[41:21] he would deal with how
[41:23] that many and he's pulling from research
[41:25] in that time
[41:26] but he says 60 of all the sicknesses
[41:29] are derived from temper it's derived
[41:33] from a lot of these things
[41:34] worry and these are things that brother
[41:36] branham said brother rams said back then
[41:38] you find it right now
[41:40] among science and among doctors that
[41:42] there's many times where they are trying
[41:44] to
[41:45] uh set forth medicine but the medicine
[41:48] itself
[41:48] will not override underlying
[41:52] uh situations such as envy or
[41:55] grudge or resentfulness it won't
[41:57] override that
[41:58] and this is why brother brown said worry
[42:01] it causes cancer
[42:03] these are things that lay within it and
[42:05] you know these are things that you know
[42:07] brother brahman says
[42:08] you come to a place and he says you find
[42:10] yourself you know rising up and
[42:12] my i'm going to give him a piece of my
[42:14] mind and brother brad simply says that
[42:15] he says
[42:16] you'll be the one that'll suffer for it
[42:19] because of allowing things to reside
[42:22] in a person's life sometimes they don't
[42:25] even realize
[42:25] why is this person so why are they so
[42:28] sick or why is this
[42:29] you know many times there's things that
[42:31] is it's greater
[42:32] than just a sickness or a disease it
[42:35] comes down to there's
[42:37] actually a root cause that's inviting
[42:39] that there in that life
[42:41] a sound heart now understand we i want
[42:44] you to take that all in a balance
[42:46] because
[42:47] a sound heart is the life of the flesh
[42:51] it will actually give strength and life
[42:53] like brother brown talked about that
[42:55] sister
[42:55] who who was there in the wheelchair but
[42:58] brother brandon said he looked at her
[42:59] and what joy that she had she wasn't
[43:02] upset
[43:03] that she'd been prayed for and countless
[43:05] times but there was a joy
[43:07] what gave her life of the flesh what was
[43:10] it that gave her strength
[43:12] she had the joy of the lord in her life
[43:15] you know when you look at somebody who's
[43:17] walked a little bit with the lord
[43:19] sometimes you can look around you know
[43:21] the assembly and see veterans you see
[43:22] others
[43:23] it isn't that they haven't come through
[43:25] some of the same pathways
[43:27] and obstacles and tests and trials it
[43:30] isn't that
[43:31] well you know what's going on with me
[43:33] nobody's ever had that before
[43:35] that's nonsense everybody has come in
[43:37] across certain pathways
[43:39] you know we need to get rid of and say
[43:41] god don't let me begin to
[43:42] operate by a complex and to recognize
[43:45] like it's on me oh my
[43:47] well we're just going to go with it now
[43:48] we just don't want to operate in that
[43:50] manner because we're never going to get
[43:52] help
[43:52] we need help from god and to recognize
[43:55] that when you can look sometimes
[43:57] at older ones and veterans and different
[43:59] ones anybody that's been in the way
[44:01] in any length of time you recognize you
[44:04] know by your own life you can look at
[44:06] that life and say
[44:08] they have come through many things that
[44:10] i'm experiencing
[44:11] and they're still standing you know what
[44:14] that is
[44:14] that's the grace of god in their life
[44:17] it's a testimony
[44:18] that no matter how old or how long it
[44:21] goes on there is the grace of god
[44:23] a joy of the lord that the world didn't
[44:25] give and the world can't take it away
[44:28] it's a real reality in that life that
[44:31] keeps them going steady
[44:32] through opposition through tests through
[44:34] trials through things that are sent
[44:36] against them through things that are
[44:38] done wrong but yet the joy of the lord
[44:40] is present there
[44:41] that their life is conducted that's
[44:43] where i can look at older ones and know
[44:45] if there's things that i've been through
[44:47] and here i have just you know
[44:49] just been walking with the lord for this
[44:51] time and there's others all along i say
[44:53] oh god
[44:54] thank you for my brother thank you for
[44:56] my sister because they have went through
[44:59] many battles how did they do it how did
[45:01] they do it how are you doing it here
[45:03] tonight
[45:04] and not sitting here full of bitterness
[45:06] and not sitting here full
[45:08] of resentment i'll tell you hi the grace
[45:11] of
[45:11] almighty god it's god's mercy
[45:14] that even when we had a right to set
[45:16] with resentment
[45:18] or bitterness but god rich in mercy
[45:21] would minister to our hearts and we say
[45:24] oh god
[45:25] i don't want that in my life
[45:28] [Music]
[45:30] this is where it comes the next part of
[45:31] the scripture but
[45:33] envy the rottenness of the bones
[45:36] this ain't something you can see right
[45:37] away you know what the scripture tells
[45:40] me about envy
[45:41] is that it's a conniving slick subtle
[45:44] devil it needs the spiritual
[45:47] mra mri of the skin of the holy ghost
[45:52] which is why we need the living word to
[45:54] discern our lives
[45:56] punish through a scan what to say what
[46:00] about this right here
[46:01] [Music]
[46:03] the reality when our life has been
[46:05] changed
[46:06] we don't want envy in our life we don't
[46:09] want
[46:10] things to be out of sorts in our life
[46:13] but you see how
[46:14] subtle there's such a subtlety the way
[46:16] the enemy can work
[46:17] that things sometimes can come in but
[46:20] thanks be to god
[46:22] that there is a living word
[46:26] that discerns the heart because god
[46:29] knows what our desire is
[46:31] is to please him above everything else
[46:36] so when we look at this the bible would
[46:39] say it
[46:40] like this in proverbs 3 31
[46:44] envy thou not the oppressor and i'm just
[46:46] going to take here just for
[46:48] just just a moment here on that
[46:52] that that where of the things that we
[46:54] come in contact the things that we see
[46:56] on the outside and so forth but so i
[46:59] want you just to look at this here in
[47:00] the scripture because
[47:02] um the bible will expressly tell us in
[47:04] the book of
[47:05] thessalonians and we realize without
[47:07] that and we don't even need that written
[47:09] there
[47:09] it's just it's just the love of god and
[47:11] that is that we're to show that love
[47:13] toward all men
[47:15] it's not so well we love those you know
[47:18] uh who love me or i love those you know
[47:20] of our assembly aren't no we're to love
[47:22] all men
[47:25] that this is the scripture not meaning
[47:27] that we love look
[47:28] brother brown would say we don't love
[47:30] the sin but we love the sinner
[47:32] we don't love the sin but we love the
[47:34] sinner so here
[47:36] look what look look what here the the
[47:38] the writer by the spirit of god
[47:41] envy thou not the oppressor
[47:44] and choose none of his
[47:48] ways
[47:51] so the oppressor is one who is
[47:54] oppressing
[47:55] and how that solomon would write this
[47:58] listen this wisdom of solomon
[48:00] is not solomon himself it's the wisdom
[48:03] of god
[48:03] that god has given to solomon and
[48:06] remember that was a time in israel
[48:08] where it was a time of peace in david
[48:11] there were wars that were fought is that
[48:12] right
[48:13] you see now in the time of solomon it
[48:16] was a time
[48:17] of peace as brother branham would put it
[48:19] it was that
[48:20] likened to that of a golden age like a
[48:23] time of a millennium
[48:25] there was wisdom here envy thou not the
[48:27] oppressor and choose
[48:28] none of his ways simply put we are not
[48:32] of the world
[48:33] neither are we to act like the world
[48:35] acts
[48:36] or to respond like the world responds
[48:40] like dog eat dog we're not to respond in
[48:42] that way
[48:44] we're of a different kingdom
[48:49] the lord is our creator we're under it
[48:52] we're under a banner it's not a bender
[48:55] of hatred or malice or fear this is a
[48:58] banner
[48:58] of divine love and divine love realizes
[49:02] where was i when he came and found me
[49:06] and look where i am now i didn't make
[49:08] myself aware of that condition
[49:10] he came to me
[49:14] he picked me up he brought me
[49:17] where i am he gave me the strength he
[49:20] stimulated my faith
[49:22] to believe that i could be saved he
[49:24] moved upon my faith
[49:26] operated on it that i could receive him
[49:29] into my life tim
[49:33] it's him so here in thee thou not the
[49:35] oppressor this word
[49:37] means do not be jealous
[49:40] envious or zealous
[49:43] toward the oppressor choose none of his
[49:46] ways
[49:48] see the bible over and over we could
[49:49] come
[49:52] the bible says if they what does it say
[49:54] at the scripture
[49:55] if they sue you for your coat give them
[49:57] the other
[49:59] go ahead it's all right you say help me
[50:01] jesus
[50:04] you see all of these things how the
[50:06] scripture would say
[50:09] in the book of romans be not overcome
[50:11] with evil
[50:13] but overcome evil with good
[50:17] sometimes when it don't seem to be
[50:19] working ah that ain't working you had
[50:21] the wrong motive to begin with
[50:24] the motive was all about you making your
[50:26] life easier
[50:28] this is why if your motive's not right
[50:31] the word will not operate
[50:33] even in what you're doing is correct but
[50:35] your motive must be right in doing it
[50:38] is that right so the bible says but
[50:41] do good thereby you might heap coals of
[50:45] fire
[50:46] upon their head is that right it's not
[50:49] something we're doing
[50:50] out of vengeance but we recognize let me
[50:53] just tell you this let me just say this
[50:54] very clearly
[50:56] when jesus i'm just just you know just
[50:58] looking over these things
[50:59] and hear the lord jesus knowing that
[51:02] judas is the one to betray him
[51:05] and he says he that dippeth his hand
[51:08] in the sock with me jesus didn't cut him
[51:13] off
[51:13] true amen
[51:20] when polycarp
[51:23] was to be taken and they were after him
[51:28] they found where he was at polycarp was
[51:31] in the upstairs
[51:33] they came where he was at he made
[51:36] his captors sit down and he had a meal
[51:40] prepared for them
[51:42] are you with me the bible says then he
[51:45] asked me says would you mind if i go
[51:47] pray not the bible but history records
[51:49] this when you
[51:51] he went and prayed for not just one hour
[51:53] two hours and he prayed for his captors
[51:56] hallelujah they felt so ashamed
[52:01] should we take him apolly karp says i
[52:04] must go with you
[52:07] and talking about the stock we come from
[52:10] polycarp they did not have the
[52:13] revelation
[52:14] that god has given us in this hour and
[52:17] if what they had
[52:18] it wasn't less it wasn't weak it
[52:20] operated according to the anointing of
[52:22] the word
[52:22] that was upon their life and they
[52:24] responded according
[52:26] to the spirit of god they were under
[52:28] polycarp in them here they were
[52:30] under that that ox anointing they
[52:32] responded
[52:33] to the spirit of god operating
[52:36] in the word in that time amen
[52:40] my he served his enemies he prayed for
[52:44] them it's all right whether you're
[52:46] saying out loud or in your heart but we
[52:48] ought to be saying
[52:49] help me jesus help me lord because let
[52:52] me tell you something
[52:53] he didn't come from a different tree
[52:55] it's on that same tree of life
[52:57] that you and i are born of this is why
[52:59] we need the grace of god
[53:01] so greatly in our lives
[53:05] oh my god glory oh i love that mom
[53:09] you know polycarp i could just keep
[53:10] going but we need to move on here this
[53:13] is where the scripture would say
[53:14] choose none of his ways and romans 12 14
[53:18] said bless them
[53:20] which persecutes you
[53:23] bless and curse not think of saul and
[53:26] david
[53:28] saul was the people's choice
[53:33] david was god's choice
[53:36] is that right god showed
[53:40] here a life that would be fit for the
[53:44] throne
[53:44] to rule david david never received it
[53:48] with a silver spoon in his mouth
[53:52] as a matter of fact when david david's
[53:55] desire
[53:56] was for israel it was for
[53:59] we say the body david went out there
[54:02] under the leadership of the lord
[54:03] and it fell on his ears who is this
[54:06] uncircumcised philistine
[54:07] making his bluff then we understand
[54:11] as what transpires but then you have
[54:14] then
[54:15] the women come out singing oh saul has
[54:18] killed his thousands
[54:19] david his ten thousands and right there
[54:26] you see this is why listen not just in
[54:28] the things i think how god was taking us
[54:30] last week but it's also very very much
[54:33] so
[54:34] that we you can never it's never to let
[54:37] down your guard but in always at all
[54:38] times
[54:39] say god help me to be sensitive to you
[54:41] you can hear
[54:42] things said or things you could say it's
[54:45] important to say god
[54:46] order my lips lord order the words that
[54:50] said
[54:50] at least i don't want to provoke anybody
[54:52] to hear i don't want to set up
[54:54] a condition where envy could set in and
[54:57] i don't want lord envy to set in on my
[55:00] life
[55:04] god uses god uses us and he uses every
[55:07] one of us according to his purpose
[55:09] god might prepare us brother iran tells
[55:11] us a man
[55:12] for just a moment's worth of work
[55:17] but that that part is just as vital
[55:22] as a person or man whomever that god
[55:25] would use
[55:25] countless time and time again
[55:29] god doesn't put one above another it's
[55:32] for us to be
[55:33] in our place oh my
[55:36] yes this is why we need the spirit of
[55:41] god
[55:41] as david you think with david it's a
[55:44] paradox
[55:46] i mean i don't know
[55:49] i don't know if i would go back to
[55:51] somebody's house if they were throwing
[55:52] things at me
[55:55] i mean you wouldn't say man i they
[55:58] love me that's why they're whipping them
[56:00] javelins at me
[56:02] no sir right i mean we're doing good
[56:06] enough if somebody disagrees with us
[56:10] let alone javelins but the bible says
[56:13] david escaped out of it
[56:16] and then the bible would say david would
[56:18] come back and submit it himself
[56:21] one thing that david listen this is
[56:23] where brother adam takes us in the
[56:24] message respects
[56:30] could look at saul but you never find
[56:34] david in the scriptures running saul
[56:36] down
[56:38] i saw him fit to be king what the
[56:40] world's he doing you see you know what
[56:41] he did to me you know
[56:42] you never find that you even find
[56:45] different ones to try to instigate and
[56:47] say
[56:48] hey here he is take his life you've
[56:50] already been anointed king
[56:52] look what he's doing to you he's running
[56:53] you down chasing you down like a dog
[56:55] treat you like this man come on this is
[56:57] your time
[56:59] but david's desire was to please god
[57:03] more than himself
[57:06] hallelujah this was a man after god's
[57:10] own heart
[57:11] this was a test before he come to the
[57:14] throne
[57:14] if he himself would be able to continue
[57:17] to look at saul in the right measure
[57:19] it's no doubt
[57:20] saul had lost his credibility as a king
[57:23] but david still recognized this is the
[57:26] office
[57:27] this man holds and that's why brother
[57:29] brown says no matter what office it is
[57:31] even if it's an office in a public place
[57:34] you're going to respect the office
[57:37] hello because if you don't do that where
[57:40] does it end
[57:42] we're not talking about when you agree
[57:44] with it where does it end
[57:47] amen
[57:50] we're tested whether you say a man or
[57:54] not we're tested
[57:57] i think the prophet showed exemplary
[58:00] character
[58:01] when everything happened in 1960 he
[58:03] showed exemplary character
[58:06] are you with me where he would take time
[58:08] and pray
[58:09] for the president even in what was
[58:11] disputed
[58:12] and was clearly laid out that was false
[58:14] but he still prayed
[58:16] all right these were not listen those
[58:19] things were not by chance
[58:20] he was laid out for you and i it's not
[58:22] putting brother branham here it's to
[58:24] show you and i
[58:25] this is the character of the message
[58:28] that you and i
[58:29] have received challenging yes it's
[58:32] challenging
[58:33] but god has prepared a people in this
[58:36] hour
[58:36] that their eyes are fixed on the rapture
[58:39] and they're
[58:40] under an anointing that i'm not going to
[58:42] let anything
[58:43] get in my way even a wrong feeling
[58:47] i'm not going to let that keep me out of
[58:49] the rapture
[58:53] [Music]
[58:59] what a paradox you know with david and
[59:01] saul but this was one who who god
[59:04] was preparing to put on the throne
[59:08] let me just let me look at this you see
[59:10] this is why brother branham would say
[59:12] let me just refer to this
[59:13] out of the message shalom the the first
[59:16] one that brother brown preaches there to
[59:18] the group of believers there in
[59:19] ceravista
[59:21] and brother branham makes a statement
[59:22] within there i i just
[59:25] just some time ago just taken with this
[59:27] now brother branham you know how it is
[59:29] when you hear something and it just
[59:30] it just resonates with you it just
[59:34] resonates with you it's just something
[59:35] that just
[59:36] you know when you look at oh god and you
[59:39] just say lord help me
[59:41] anybody been there i mean i'm not just
[59:44] listening to the message to be a a
[59:46] spectator
[59:48] i find myself no matter where it's at
[59:49] sometimes that maybe have to turn down
[59:51] another eye or
[59:52] or here i am and brother adam said oh
[59:53] god help me lord
[59:55] help me lord jesus brother brahms talks
[59:57] about the people
[59:58] he says it's a time that's upon the
[1:00:01] people that he said it's the most
[1:00:03] pathetic
[1:00:04] time he talked about he says how he says
[1:00:07] this is something he says that i've
[1:00:09] tried my best to
[1:00:11] that even in times of disagreeing he
[1:00:13] said sometimes where it's been
[1:00:14] very strong he said but if i couldn't at
[1:00:18] the end of it
[1:00:19] be able to shake hands with that
[1:00:22] individual
[1:00:23] and feel the same way
[1:00:27] he said then i know something's wrong
[1:00:28] with me
[1:00:34] brother brown would say it like this he
[1:00:36] says even after he says
[1:00:37] what's been said could be disagreeable
[1:00:39] or dishearten and you know this is one
[1:00:41] of the this is one of the things
[1:00:43] i mean i don't know where it's like
[1:00:47] sometimes we get in a thought well
[1:00:49] everybody's got to agree
[1:00:50] everybody don't have to agree everybody
[1:00:53] don't have to think the way you think
[1:00:55] hello well the agreement that we have to
[1:00:58] have is the agreement with the word of
[1:00:59] god
[1:01:00] that's an absolute there might be little
[1:01:03] things here or there that we disagree
[1:01:05] but just because i did disagree with you
[1:01:07] doesn't make me some sort of a wow this
[1:01:09] guy is really off his rocker no
[1:01:11] that's my that's where i stand
[1:01:14] is that right yes did you see this or
[1:01:18] brother brown would make a statement and
[1:01:19] he would say it in this manner he says
[1:01:21] he says you know and after something he
[1:01:23] said is said real sharp
[1:01:25] if i had one thought look at this if i
[1:01:28] had one thought
[1:01:30] that i didn't like that person let's
[1:01:32] separate it
[1:01:33] not that a thought came to him
[1:01:37] thoughts will come to you come on now
[1:01:39] this flesh
[1:01:40] is a place brother and described it even
[1:01:42] after you're born again
[1:01:43] there's a carnal sticky nature
[1:01:47] i don't know you know i'm taught my
[1:01:48] brother joey you walk through the woods
[1:01:50] sometimes even back here in other
[1:01:52] places sometimes i'm walking and there's
[1:01:54] certain things that get stuck
[1:01:56] there's certain little prickers and
[1:01:58] things and would anybody want to walk
[1:02:00] through a rose bush
[1:02:01] not at all would you want to walk
[1:02:02] through stickers no not at all
[1:02:04] you and i are a pile of stickers
[1:02:08] come on now that carnal sticky nature of
[1:02:11] the first birth
[1:02:12] that's why there's got to be a new birth
[1:02:14] on the inside
[1:02:15] where god takes that that that pucker
[1:02:18] boil he
[1:02:18] opens it up and he places that germ of
[1:02:21] wheat life
[1:02:22] on the inside you might look like a
[1:02:24] cocker barrel
[1:02:25] on the outside but inside it is weak
[1:02:28] life
[1:02:29] [Applause]
[1:02:31] hallelujah and that weak life on the
[1:02:33] inside is greater than that nature of
[1:02:35] the tucker barrel that was there
[1:02:38] hallelujah certain things sometimes get
[1:02:40] stick where are you get unstuck
[1:02:44] right don't let them accumulate on your
[1:02:46] life
[1:02:48] don't let things build up go through an
[1:02:50] unsticking process
[1:02:52] go through that of the word the washing
[1:02:54] of water
[1:02:55] by the word that'll help you and
[1:02:57] removing
[1:02:58] those things sometimes it gets stuck
[1:03:03] oh brother samuel i just can't wait till
[1:03:06] the time here where i'm unsticky
[1:03:08] oh you're wanting the body change i do
[1:03:10] too
[1:03:12] i do too but i'll tell you there's a way
[1:03:14] that you can help things so it's
[1:03:16] not so sticky that's the more we stay
[1:03:19] in the presence of god in fellowship
[1:03:22] with him
[1:03:24] the points aren't as sharp and catchy
[1:03:29] i said if i got one thought i don't like
[1:03:31] that person then i know one thing
[1:03:32] the spirit of christ has departed from
[1:03:35] me
[1:03:36] if i can feel that i don't like that
[1:03:38] person there's something
[1:03:40] wrong with me not the person
[1:03:45] something wrong with me so if he's
[1:03:47] departed
[1:03:48] what do i have to do become a lamb
[1:03:52] again
[1:03:55] is that brother brandon right think of
[1:03:58] here he says here he was
[1:03:59] he said i believe he said we're living
[1:04:01] in this time once again
[1:04:03] he said his own people jesus own people
[1:04:06] were driving the nails in his hand
[1:04:09] and he cried out and brother brahman
[1:04:11] emphasized with a heart full of love
[1:04:13] father forgive them
[1:04:17] they know not what they do and i'm
[1:04:20] telling you friends brother branham
[1:04:21] preached this message
[1:04:23] here in 64. darkness upon the people
[1:04:27] and brother brown makes it so clear in
[1:04:29] there said people they've lost their
[1:04:31] reasoning
[1:04:32] have people he says forgot they have
[1:04:35] they have the opportunity
[1:04:36] to make a choice between right and wrong
[1:04:40] we're living we're living in a time
[1:04:42] we've been seeing compiling
[1:04:44] we are living in a time it's a very
[1:04:47] pathetic thing
[1:04:48] but i'm telling you people do not
[1:04:51] realize the choices
[1:04:52] they're making let me just say this
[1:04:55] even while sitting in the house of god
[1:04:58] let alone the decisions that they're
[1:05:00] making out there
[1:05:03] it's choices that we have that's before
[1:05:06] us
[1:05:07] it's a pathetic time to where that it's
[1:05:10] to
[1:05:11] to recognize people don't know what
[1:05:13] they're doing they they wouldn't make
[1:05:14] the decisions they're making
[1:05:16] it's spirits it's spirits that's at work
[1:05:22] and i'll say it to you like this
[1:05:25] don't try to reason with them
[1:05:30] are you with me you're off of your
[1:05:33] god-given ground don't try to reason
[1:05:37] with them
[1:05:37] don't try to explain it let me tell you
[1:05:39] something there's a lot of things things
[1:05:41] that are present
[1:05:42] in this world right now let me tell you
[1:05:44] what brought it
[1:05:45] sure satan came and brought hurts and
[1:05:48] everything else and all these things
[1:05:50] then he comes right around
[1:05:51] and exploits those things and everything
[1:05:54] is division
[1:05:55] divisiveness division divisiveness
[1:06:00] they ought to be the spirit of god
[1:06:02] within our heart
[1:06:04] united with jesus christ that says
[1:06:08] my heart is for that man or for that
[1:06:12] woman
[1:06:13] my heart is for my brother or for my
[1:06:16] sister amen
[1:06:19] are you with me
[1:06:24] brent said i don't believe that people
[1:06:26] know what they're doing said they become
[1:06:27] such a subject to evil
[1:06:29] until it's a pathetic thing we're living
[1:06:33] in a time
[1:06:34] where good is called evil
[1:06:37] and evil is called good yes
[1:06:41] we're here i said we've
[1:06:45] we've arrived what you want to make sure
[1:06:47] is that you're standing on the side of
[1:06:49] the word
[1:06:52] i'm not interested in trying to prop up
[1:06:54] the world
[1:06:56] i'm interested in leaving it
[1:07:01] you're saying brother samuel let your
[1:07:02] ambition be set completely on god
[1:07:05] on his word on his working lord i'm
[1:07:08] ready and i want to continue to make
[1:07:10] ready to go
[1:07:12] see this is where even when the lord
[1:07:14] jesus as they came remember
[1:07:16] his his face i want you to catch this
[1:07:18] i'm not i'm not going to put this up
[1:07:19] there but remember
[1:07:20] when he was going by samaria he had set
[1:07:23] his face to go to jerusalem
[1:07:26] there was a purpose he was going to
[1:07:28] jerusalem
[1:07:29] not just for the feast of the passover
[1:07:31] but he was going there
[1:07:33] this was a journey where this was going
[1:07:35] to take him
[1:07:36] there wasn't going to be entering into
[1:07:38] jerusalem and a leaving now
[1:07:39] here was coming to the climax of the
[1:07:42] purpose
[1:07:43] of his life and here he comes into a
[1:07:45] situation
[1:07:46] the conditions that are around and they
[1:07:48] in samaria
[1:07:50] wouldn't receive him those around him
[1:07:53] listen to me those around him what did
[1:07:55] they say
[1:07:56] lord what do you want us to do should we
[1:07:59] call fire down out of heaven
[1:08:01] and consume them as elias did
[1:08:06] big difference elijah was not operating
[1:08:10] out of a selfish motive amen
[1:08:13] though they were walking with the word
[1:08:14] made flesh they still had selfish
[1:08:17] motives
[1:08:18] hello and that's not elijah elias did
[1:08:22] not call fire down
[1:08:24] to consume people
[1:08:27] that didn't agree with him as a matter
[1:08:29] of fact the mercy of god
[1:08:31] even in that time where god threw
[1:08:34] elijah by the word he prayed for
[1:08:38] israel did not even call him jacob
[1:08:42] he prayed a prayer that could say
[1:08:45] condemnation
[1:08:46] can be released from israel in this hour
[1:08:50] he called for the fire to fall you see
[1:08:52] he was in complete
[1:08:53] harmony with god and the fire came down
[1:08:56] to do what
[1:08:57] vindicate the living god
[1:09:01] what they were wanting had nothing to do
[1:09:04] with god
[1:09:06] it had everything to do with we haven't
[1:09:08] been accepted
[1:09:10] so because we haven't been accepted let
[1:09:12] me see what promise we can use against
[1:09:14] them
[1:09:17] see how you see how how look you see how
[1:09:20] that first
[1:09:21] nature and how that first part you can
[1:09:23] always try to use things to try to
[1:09:25] conveniently
[1:09:30] jesus said the son of man has not come
[1:09:32] to destroy lives
[1:09:34] but save amen proverbs 23
[1:09:38] 17 look at the scripture says let not
[1:09:41] thine heart
[1:09:42] in these sinners
[1:09:48] you catch it let not your heart right
[1:09:52] out here it could seem er but remember
[1:09:54] your heart right
[1:09:55] this is why the bible says the heart is
[1:09:57] deceitful above all things
[1:09:59] but i the lord try it
[1:10:03] this is why david said search me o god
[1:10:05] yes lord
[1:10:07] let not let not thine heart envy sinners
[1:10:10] not this ain't all about saints right
[1:10:14] it said sinners but be thou
[1:10:17] in the fear of the lord all the day long
[1:10:20] this is the remedy
[1:10:25] boy i'm gonna get a lot of amens on it
[1:10:27] but i'm gonna preach it amen
[1:10:31] envy do not be zealous boiled up can you
[1:10:34] believe
[1:10:37] all right
[1:10:40] be not envy not the center
[1:10:43] why they're just simply acting like a
[1:10:47] sinner hello somebody
[1:10:51] hey that's why you know you don't
[1:10:54] condemn the drunkard for drinking
[1:10:56] he's a drunkard
[1:11:00] hello somebody they're only doing what
[1:11:02] they are
[1:11:08] but be thou in the fear and in the
[1:11:10] reverence of the lord
[1:11:12] all the day long for surely there is an
[1:11:15] end
[1:11:15] and dying expectations shall not be cut
[1:11:18] off
[1:11:18] i tell you i love this statement brother
[1:11:20] branham makes in the church age book
[1:11:22] just looking at this here the whole of
[1:11:24] the christian life
[1:11:26] is to be in the spirit john son i was in
[1:11:29] the spirit on the lord's day
[1:11:32] paul said if we're going if we live in
[1:11:35] the spirit
[1:11:36] let us also walk in the spirit
[1:11:40] amen amen let's read this here in psalms
[1:11:43] 37 i
[1:11:44] i just couldn't get away from this it's
[1:11:45] just been so i
[1:11:47] had it down just to refer but i want to
[1:11:49] just couldn't get away from
[1:11:51] from reading that's so pressed on my
[1:11:52] heart i want you to look at this here in
[1:11:55] the scripture in psalms 37
[1:11:58] a psalm of david fret not
[1:12:02] thy south because of
[1:12:06] evildoers
[1:12:08] neither be thou envious
[1:12:11] against the workers of iniquity
[1:12:16] this is david's admonition but not david
[1:12:19] is the spirit of god notice this was a
[1:12:22] psalm of david
[1:12:24] or a psalm of samuel psalm of brian
[1:12:29] psalm of joey you know what that meant
[1:12:31] this is me
[1:12:32] this is for me god gave this
[1:12:36] for me it's a psalm of drake
[1:12:39] psalm for me this is what david had to
[1:12:42] live
[1:12:43] when he ran from cave to cave when he
[1:12:46] couldn't even live
[1:12:47] in israel had to flee to the philistine
[1:12:50] country
[1:12:51] was not accepted there but david didn't
[1:12:54] get his sights
[1:12:56] he didn't become overtaken you think of
[1:12:58] times that david didn't cry
[1:13:00] he didn't weep he looked at things he
[1:13:03] looked at conditions
[1:13:04] i'll tell you he cried and he wept no
[1:13:06] doubt many times
[1:13:07] he wept himself to sleep but he had a
[1:13:10] promise
[1:13:11] there was an anointing upon his life
[1:13:15] he didn't know how he was going to get
[1:13:17] to the throne but he knew
[1:13:18] i'd been anointed for rapture
[1:13:23] and that's what kept him that's what
[1:13:26] drove him
[1:13:27] that's what kept david and gave
[1:13:29] authority to force
[1:13:31] everything else out of his life
[1:13:37] and if david a man without the holy
[1:13:40] ghost
[1:13:42] because it hadn't been given yet could
[1:13:44] live that kind of a life devoted to god
[1:13:47] how much more when we who have been
[1:13:51] purchased by his blood
[1:13:54] and filled with his holy spirit
[1:13:58] neither be thou envious against the
[1:14:00] workers of iniquity
[1:14:01] for they shall soon be cut down like the
[1:14:04] grass
[1:14:05] and wither as the green earth
[1:14:08] look at this in verse 3
[1:14:12] trust in the lord i'm not going to be
[1:14:14] much longer but
[1:14:15] the engine's a little worn right now
[1:14:18] trust in the lord feels good though
[1:14:21] trust in the lord
[1:14:22] and do good amen wait a minute dave wait
[1:14:26] a minute david
[1:14:27] you mean when everything's going my way
[1:14:31] there's no evil doers there's no wicked
[1:14:36] you're wanting the millennium right now
[1:14:38] that you can have something greater

[1:14:55] that old nature

[1:15:04] that used to be the way that i act but

[1:15:24] i'm telling you god's talking tonight
[1:15:28] these this portion of scripture i just
[1:15:29] had a reference to it but i couldn't get
[1:15:31] away from this even though it deals
[1:15:33] within me
[1:15:34] but and the more as i look at this
[1:15:36] delight thyself in the lord
[1:15:38] and he shall give thee the desires of
[1:15:40] the heart you've got to be careful what
[1:15:42] your desires are
[1:15:44] god will give you the desires of your
[1:15:46] heart he gave bala
[1:15:48] what his desires were god asked him and
[1:15:52] finally god said
[1:15:53] go ahead that's what's in your heart go
[1:15:55] ahead and do it and they'll say praise
[1:15:57] god
[1:15:57] i got a yes after 35 no's but god was
[1:16:01] finally saying you know what
[1:16:02] i've told you no once that should be
[1:16:04] enough
[1:16:06] but that's what's in your heart go to it
[1:16:10] right david balaam didn't have
[1:16:12] discernment
[1:16:13] right but that ass had discernment
[1:16:16] you know why it was redeemable
[1:16:19] hallelujah he could recognize the
[1:16:21] presence of god
[1:16:22] he could recognize god speaking it might
[1:16:24] have been regarded as a foolish
[1:16:26] dumb animal but remember it could
[1:16:29] recognize
[1:16:30] the god standing there
[1:16:34] hallelujah i believe there's a god part
[1:16:37] in my life that can recognize
[1:16:40] there's a path then maybe you could be
[1:16:42] going a certain way but the god part
[1:16:44] steps up and says
[1:16:46] stop
[1:16:53] amen delight thyself also in the lord
[1:16:57] and he shall give thee the desires of
[1:16:59] thine heart
[1:17:00] commit thy way unto the lord
[1:17:04] trust also in him
[1:17:07] and he shall bring it to pass what what
[1:17:11] you've committed
[1:17:13] and he shall bring forth thy
[1:17:15] righteousness who will bring it forth
[1:17:17] he will as the light and thy judgment
[1:17:20] as the noon day rest in the lord
[1:17:24] and wait patiently for him fret
[1:17:27] not thyself because of him who
[1:17:29] prospereth in his way
[1:17:31] because of the man who bringeth wicked
[1:17:33] devices to pass
[1:17:36] this word rest in the lord sometimes you
[1:17:38] know when you you just okay rest
[1:17:40] this word rest here means to become as
[1:17:42] one who is dumb

[1:18:38] peace or trouble it ain't god's fault

[1:20:27] jesus christ
[1:20:28] is going to inhabit not only during the
[1:20:31] millennium when
[1:20:32] that system will change you know god
[1:20:34] will even allow it to be in the
[1:20:35] millennium
[1:20:36] just even in a change of administration
[1:20:38] and when other parts will even be raised
[1:20:40] in that time remnants that have been
[1:20:42] left that have come up against that of
[1:20:44] israel and god will even
[1:20:46] is show and display in that time that
[1:20:48] even
[1:20:49] an administration an administration over
[1:20:52] the earth
[1:20:52] can have such an effect to bring peace
[1:20:55] where the plow shears where swords will
[1:20:58] be built in the plowshares where things
[1:21:00] are changed where
[1:21:01] people don't get sick this is in the
[1:21:03] millennium where there's even a harmony
[1:21:05] among nations and among people i'm glad
[1:21:08] to be serving a god
[1:21:10] and to know him in a personal way that
[1:21:12] he does that work right now
[1:21:14] inside of our life and that same god
[1:21:16] that's done that work
[1:21:18] that's resolved these things in our life
[1:21:20] is the same god
[1:21:21] that's taking us into a place of the
[1:21:24] millennium
[1:21:27] and into the future home wherein
[1:21:29] dwelleth
[1:21:30] righteousness don't let anything don't
[1:21:34] sell it short for nothing

[1:21:39] little while and the wicked shall not be
[1:21:41] yea they shall diligently consider his
[1:21:44] place
[1:21:45] and it shall not be but the meek
[1:21:48] shall inherit the earth amen
[1:21:52] me means give place to
[1:21:57] dwight moody walking down the street and
[1:22:00] the man stood right in his way
[1:22:04] and just mocking him he wasn't going to
[1:22:08] move the white moody you've heard the
[1:22:11] story
[1:22:11] he tipped his hat walked off the
[1:22:14] sidewalk
[1:22:15] walked all around because the guy said i
[1:22:18] don't get out of the way for fools
[1:22:20] dwight moody said i always do you know
[1:22:23] walked on around
[1:22:25] you're not going to be entertained with
[1:22:27] that
[1:22:29] that's right the meek shall inherit the
[1:22:32] earth
[1:22:32] and shall delight themselves in the
[1:22:35] abundance of peace
[1:22:36] i do not believe that we just have to
[1:22:38] wait to the millennium
[1:22:40] to delight ourselves in the abundance of
[1:22:42] peace jesus said my peace
[1:22:44] i leave you yes not a peace that the
[1:22:47] world giveth
[1:22:49] right but this is the real peace
[1:22:52] that peace that's from him he is the
[1:22:54] prince of peace
[1:22:55] but notice the admonition that's in here
[1:22:58] delight thyself in the lord
[1:23:02] commit thy ways unto him trust
[1:23:06] in the lord you see just in those three
[1:23:08] verses
[1:23:10] just in that three alone right there it
[1:23:12] brings into a place
[1:23:14] of our focus and where we need to be
[1:23:17] sure have jobs and other places i'm
[1:23:19] talking about sinners and these things
[1:23:20] out here
[1:23:21] have has there been times where things
[1:23:22] have come our way
[1:23:24] sure and no doubt if times carries
[1:23:26] there's things that will come our way
[1:23:28] but we're not the first we're not the
[1:23:31] first we're not even right now
[1:23:33] even when we consider our brothers and
[1:23:35] sisters in other parts of the world
[1:23:36] they are they experience oppression that
[1:23:38] you and i
[1:23:39] do not experience as of yet
[1:23:43] are you with me and whatever degree that
[1:23:45] we will and whatever
[1:23:46] all of those things that's in god's
[1:23:47] hands but you recognize
[1:23:50] our desire what god would speak don't
[1:23:52] fret yourself
[1:23:54] with the evil doers why charity
[1:23:57] envious not
[1:24:02] let me leave you with this point i can't
[1:24:04] get no further than this but let me
[1:24:05] leave you with this one
[1:24:06] still dealing with that on the outside i
[1:24:09] can't get to the inside
[1:24:14] psalm 73 this psalm has been one of
[1:24:17] those psalms that was
[1:24:18] years ago one of the first winter youth
[1:24:19] retreats i ever did i came in and got in
[1:24:21] there at the time
[1:24:23] brother burley williams was preaching
[1:24:24] that night and he preached out of this
[1:24:26] chapter never forgot it you know it's
[1:24:27] one of those servants that just so
[1:24:29] how the spirit of god took brother
[1:24:30] burley and began to work with the young
[1:24:32] people that night
[1:24:33] and deal with it's one of those things
[1:24:34] that's never it never never left me
[1:24:37] not the memory so much of it but as it
[1:24:40] spoke
[1:24:40] as god spoke in that hour and as it
[1:24:43] deals with
[1:24:44] in psalm 73 it's a psalm of asa asaph is
[1:24:46] a
[1:24:47] is the chief musician in that
[1:24:50] of of that of of among the musicians
[1:24:53] that was there within jerusalem
[1:24:55] he's a chief musician so in other words
[1:24:58] he's one that
[1:24:59] would have i don't want to just say
[1:25:00] stature but he but
[1:25:02] he has a responsibility it's not just
[1:25:04] you know he has a responsibility even in
[1:25:07] and you know worship and music and
[1:25:09] things like that
[1:25:10] and every one of us have a
[1:25:12] responsibility too
[1:25:15] and here's what asaph says truly god is
[1:25:17] good to israel
[1:25:19] even to such as are of a clean heart
[1:25:23] but as for me my feet
[1:25:27] were almost gone
[1:25:30] my steps had well
[1:25:33] and i slipped
[1:25:39] asap's still showing up still leading
[1:25:42] singing or
[1:25:43] you know still going he's going on
[1:25:46] but what is he telling us his feet
[1:25:50] his ground that was under him he had
[1:25:52] almost slipped
[1:25:55] once you appreciate somebody to be
[1:25:56] honest
[1:25:59] why why was this verse three for i was
[1:26:03] envious at the foolish
[1:26:08] when i saw the prosperity of the wicked
[1:26:13] first thing he's got wrong he's looking
[1:26:16] at the wrong thing
[1:26:17] and he's looking at it in the wrong way
[1:26:20] he's
[1:26:20] looking at it in envy how can this be
[1:26:26] how can they prosper
[1:26:30] and what he doesn't realize is
[1:26:33] his footing it's starting to slip
[1:26:38] it might just started to slip just a
[1:26:39] little inch his prayer life
[1:26:42] started to kind of go aside
[1:26:46] his time of really maybe focusing of his
[1:26:49] family
[1:26:50] him and his wife maybe children on the
[1:26:53] right things
[1:26:54] he got to looking at this and he started
[1:26:56] to focus
[1:26:58] on the wrong things let me just say this
[1:27:01] very clearly
[1:27:04] let me say very clearly the message of
[1:27:07] the hour that god has sent
[1:27:10] did not just restore us to the faith of
[1:27:13] this hour unto the faith that was once
[1:27:15] delivered to the saints
[1:27:18] but it also addressed issues
[1:27:22] that were present it addressed how we
[1:27:25] are to respond
[1:27:27] brother samuel are you getting ready are
[1:27:28] you storing up food
[1:27:30] i've been storing up food spiritually
[1:27:34] i'm not planning on being here
[1:27:37] hello god that has provided for me
[1:27:41] up to this day he'll provide for me all
[1:27:43] the way through
[1:27:44] that has never been a direction in the
[1:27:47] message of the hour
[1:27:49] but if you listen to the wrong source
[1:27:51] you'll find yourself
[1:27:53] preparing for something that the message
[1:27:55] has never pointed us to
[1:27:58] what are you telling me watch your feet
[1:28:01] watch your feet yes yes
[1:28:04] that your feet do not slip the same i
[1:28:07] thought this on love it is on love
[1:28:10] charity envious not
[1:28:17] it's to steam the rapture above
[1:28:19] everything else
[1:28:22] when we esteem the rapture above
[1:28:23] everything else to esteem the lord to
[1:28:25] esteem his presence
[1:28:26] to esteem that of one another the love
[1:28:28] of god and brother a lot of other things
[1:28:30] it loses sight
[1:28:31] if there's one thing that we ought to be
[1:28:33] storing up on we ought to be storing up
[1:28:35] more of jesus
[1:28:37] and the other thing we ought to be
[1:28:38] emptying up a lot of our own selves
[1:28:41] god help me let me be as light as i can
[1:28:43] be
[1:28:44] is that right for i was envious at the
[1:28:47] foolish
[1:28:48] when i saw the prosperity of the wicked
[1:28:51] now
[1:28:51] you can read this psalm when you go home
[1:28:53] but asaph he begins to see everything
[1:28:55] he sees them even of how the wicked they
[1:28:58] he says
[1:28:59] you know there's no bonds in their death
[1:29:00] they just the way that they just kind of
[1:29:02] go through life they
[1:29:03] they pride themselves they're puffed up
[1:29:05] and everything else they
[1:29:07] act as though there's no god he's seen
[1:29:09] all this
[1:29:11] but the problem is is that he's not
[1:29:13] realizing it
[1:29:15] it's overtaking him
[1:29:18] and god's letting him know they're going
[1:29:20] the way they're going
[1:29:22] but don't you
[1:29:27] oh i love this verse 16 and 17 we'll
[1:29:29] close when i thought
[1:29:31] to know this it was too painful for me
[1:29:36] until i went into the sanctuary of god
[1:29:40] then i understood
[1:29:44] their end where
[1:29:47] in the sanctuary of god in the presence
[1:29:50] of god in a
[1:29:52] spiritual mri that god was moving upon
[1:29:56] asaph
[1:29:57] asaph you know he's my singing oh
[1:30:01] love of god how rich and pure
[1:30:04] how can they be doing that they
[1:30:06] shouldn't be
[1:30:08] how measureless and strong
[1:30:11] oh my goodness i cannot believe it's
[1:30:14] shall for
[1:30:15] a7 what you're singing about
[1:30:18] and what you're doing isn't matching up
[1:30:24] what's happening asap's not even
[1:30:26] realizing his feet
[1:30:28] is slipping the ground that he should be
[1:30:31] standing on where he should be
[1:30:32] positioned
[1:30:33] from within is slipping
[1:30:36] but here's where the love of god comes
[1:30:38] on display
[1:30:40] he can't understand it how is this going
[1:30:42] on
[1:30:44] but god comes as a scan
[1:30:51] oh lord i thought it's going to be an
[1:30:53] x-ray no x-rays sometimes we'll pick
[1:30:55] this up
[1:30:57] what'd you have to do well i had to
[1:30:58] shoot some spiritual dye
[1:31:01] i had to have have him minister certain
[1:31:03] things so that he would
[1:31:04] see and when it gets in there it pops it
[1:31:07] up and there it shows right there on the
[1:31:08] scan
[1:31:11] but as a believer of the lord you say
[1:31:13] lord
[1:31:14] purge cleanse me lord jesus
[1:31:19] help me lord god let me how do i get
[1:31:23] from that lord
[1:31:24] by focusing on me delight thyself in the
[1:31:28] lord
[1:31:28] and he shall give thee the desires of
[1:31:30] thine heart say lord let every desire of
[1:31:33] my heart
[1:31:33] be for you trust in the lord with all
[1:31:37] thine heart
[1:31:39] commit thy way oh my don't you love him
[1:31:43] let's pray heavenly father
[1:31:48] truly oh love of god
[1:31:51] how rich and pure
[1:31:54] lord as i looked at this
[1:31:59] lord even in psalms 37 as i expressed to
[1:32:01] him
[1:32:02] i couldn't get that off my heart but
[1:32:05] lord
[1:32:05] you know that where you placed this on
[1:32:08] my heart it's
[1:32:09] it's set here though studied on and on
[1:32:12] but
[1:32:13] it's been there lord god for weeks if
[1:32:15] not for months
[1:32:17] and where this has been
[1:32:21] dear god is you would see to it
[1:32:24] that here in this service tonight
[1:32:28] that lord you would you would have me to
[1:32:29] bring it
[1:32:31] lord
[1:32:34] we stand in need of you
[1:32:38] and father as we see lord god is
[1:32:42] these examples these are things that are
[1:32:44] not lord dealing with
[1:32:46] so much within the church among the body
[1:32:49] of believers these scriptures lord here
[1:32:51] tonight
[1:32:53] that we were able to get to it deals
[1:32:56] with
[1:32:58] oppressors it deals with things lord
[1:33:02] that come
[1:33:02] on the outside that we experience
[1:33:08] the lord jesus as you've so
[1:33:11] mentioned to us so clearly
[1:33:15] we realize lord there is no weakness
[1:33:17] inside of you
[1:33:19] lord when the new birth has come there's
[1:33:22] no weakness in the new birth
[1:33:25] but what it does is it shows up the
[1:33:28] weakness
[1:33:29] in our humanity it shows
[1:33:33] that lord we need you
[1:33:37] we need the living word to come
[1:33:40] and lord to discern our hearts to
[1:33:43] discern our lives
[1:33:45] sometimes lord wrong thoughts wrong
[1:33:47] feelings lord things like this we look
[1:33:49] at asaph
[1:33:51] now lord perhaps a person could say and
[1:33:53] make the the argument and say well
[1:33:55] that's just the old testament
[1:33:56] but no we recognize lord god it still
[1:34:00] speaks to us even in that part of
[1:34:01] humanity
[1:34:03] are things lord god that i couldn't even
[1:34:05] get to that brother brown himself would
[1:34:06] go into
[1:34:08] and deal with things that he was
[1:34:10] recognizing
[1:34:11] [Music]
[1:34:12] lord jesus
[1:34:16] i always think of how your prophet when
[1:34:18] he says it there
[1:34:20] and there's a series of meetings in 1962
[1:34:24] in grass valley california jehovah jireh
[1:34:27] he talks about what a success those
[1:34:29] meetings were
[1:34:30] and he narrowed it down to one statement
[1:34:33] he said it's because
[1:34:35] there were honest hearts that when god
[1:34:38] was dealing with their hearts
[1:34:41] they were honest and it invited you
[1:34:44] lord this is i believe here tonight lord
[1:34:48] i trust
[1:34:49] lord this is what you find
[1:34:52] honest hearts hearts that are lord god
[1:34:56] open or able to say yes lord help me
[1:35:01] lord i need help lord i need strength
[1:35:04] lord god
[1:35:06] i realize lord god that though it may
[1:35:09] not have showed on the outside but
[1:35:11] it's true envy is the rottenness of the
[1:35:14] bones it can
[1:35:15] show up what's on the inside that if
[1:35:17] it's not really addressed
[1:35:20] it can affect relationships
[1:35:23] first of all to affect our walk with you
[1:35:26] lord
[1:35:27] it'll affect everything else around us
[1:35:31] help us lord lord we're living in a
[1:35:33] world that's filled with bitterness
[1:35:36] filled with hatred lord god a world that
[1:35:40] preaches tolerance
[1:35:42] but it actually is intolerance it's
[1:35:44] hatred
[1:35:47] lord jesus you knew we would be here in
[1:35:50] this hour
[1:35:52] we don't need another message
[1:35:57] we just need more of you lord
[1:36:00] more of you lord than god
[1:36:04] in more of ourselves more of our lives
[1:36:06] that
[1:36:07] we might surrender more and more to you
[1:36:12] lord we're not perfect in ourselves but
[1:36:15] in christ
[1:36:16] our redeemer we are complete in you lord
[1:36:20] lord jesus as that
[1:36:24] oil is within the dove a dove doesn't
[1:36:26] have to take a bath
[1:36:28] but there's oil that comes from the
[1:36:30] inside
[1:36:32] out that oil comes from deep within
[1:36:36] and it's able
[1:36:39] to remove all that dirt and things that
[1:36:42] can
[1:36:42] come up on those feathers so it can fly
[1:36:46] lord jesus here this evening
[1:36:50] this is our desire lord
[1:36:54] is that that oil of god
[1:36:58] lord god the holy spirit in our lives

[1:37:05] lord as we step
[1:37:06] behind and allow lord that to move
[1:37:09] cleanse lord and clean out
[1:37:13] any anything that's tried to take a hold
[1:37:16] lord
[1:37:19] or jesus things that we experience
[1:37:22] things that we go through but father
[1:37:27] you're faithful lord
[1:37:30] help us lord to take that admonition
[1:37:33] that
[1:37:34] example of the scripture that is asaph
[1:37:37] would give that personal testimony
[1:37:39] perhaps it would be like asaph standing
[1:37:41] up in an assembly
[1:37:44] and he would admonish us as believers
[1:37:48] as we read from that tonight would be so
[1:37:51] open
[1:37:53] to let us know he got his eyes
[1:37:56] if we could say eyes or emotions
[1:37:59] so tied to the wrong thing
[1:38:03] his feet almost slipped out from under
[1:38:07] him
