[41:46] your seats just for a moment and just
[41:48] want to it's just so good to be here
[41:51] before we turn to the word and it's good
[41:54] to see CH and every one of you and you
[41:57] know we go through this the season that
[42:00] we are in right now and I'm not just
[42:04] talking about winter but there's times
[42:07] where we to go through and we battle
[42:09] sickness and we battle different things
[42:12] in our bodies and it's just a it's a
[42:14] blessing to be able to come together to
[42:17] be in the house of the Lord you know
[42:20] sometimes there's things that we look at
[42:22] and we wonder why does this happen or
[42:25] why did that happen but you know if in
[42:28] our life and our journey here if
[42:30] everything was smooth and it was easy
[42:33] and our flesh wants that if if if if it
[42:38] was that way we would have no longing to
[42:40] get out of here
[42:41] but God lets little reminders come to
[42:45] you and I whether it comes there in our
[42:48] body or it comes in our spirit or things
[42:51] that come our way he lets he reminds you
[42:54] and I this world is not your home we can
[42:57] see all around us the world is in decay
[42:59] but I think God's mercy and grace that
[43:03] he allows us to know that there is
[43:07] indeed another body that is waiting on
[43:10] us there is there is that which in just
[43:13] a moment we will step right into a
[43:16] matter of fact the Bible says not in it
[43:19] says in a moment and a twinkling of an
[43:22] eye and that word a phrase in the
[43:24] scripture in a moment it means that
[43:26] which is unable to be divided it is that
[43:30] quickly
[43:32] amen I'm grateful that we've got living
[43:36] evidence in our heart that quickly of
[43:40] how God can change when he changes a
[43:42] life just that quickly amen that's a
[43:46] that's a foretaste of glory divine amen
[43:49] aren't you glad about that this morning
[43:51] we miss one another we miss you when
[43:53] you're when you're not here and and and
[43:57] that is true we you know and the
[44:00] sickness and things but we thank God
[44:02] that he's provided for us in this hour
[44:05] for he still is the Lord that healeth
[44:07] all thy diseases amen aren't you glad
[44:10] about that amen
[44:14] well I want to welcome brother Josh and
[44:17] sister Ann Mariah I don't know how y'all
[44:20] got that baby over here
[44:30] with Brian and brother Brian grinning
[44:33] like a possum up here and you know one
[44:35] sister Barbara I'm sure they're they're
[44:37] happy that I know they're happy about it
[44:39] and so we just be glad to have little
[44:44] Eleanor here with us Josh and him
[44:47] arrived glad to have brother Alexander
[44:49] and sister Maria here with us good
[44:51] friends amen amen brother Alexander is
[44:58] really not even a guest here he's stood
[45:03] here in stood here so much in this in
[45:05] this pulpit and I just so appreciate
[45:08] brother brother Alexander sister Maria
[45:11] they're family I appreciate our brothers
[45:13] gift in the Lord and his burden for the
[45:16] people and you know for me as a pastor I
[45:20] just don't look at and most of you know
[45:22] this by now I just don't look at getting
[45:24] somebody in here and I don't go chasing
[45:26] names and I know that when I say that it
[45:29] isn't that we have anything against
[45:30] names but I realize that within every
[45:33] situation and every service who we need
[45:35] to hear from is Jesus and now whatever
[45:38] vessel he's going to use he might choose
[45:40] one that's complexions a little darker
[45:42] than mine might have a little bit more
[45:44] hair than me the who we want to hear
[45:46] from you sin and that is the things that
[45:50] I would I appreciate his how that
[45:52] brother brother Alexander within his
[45:54] ministry within the services that he's
[45:56] been here and I don't just say this
[45:57] because he's sitting here he knows us
[45:59] how I feel our others the Assembly has
[46:02] been benefited by the ministry and
[46:05] that's what I that's my point that I'm
[46:06] making I want ministry in here that
[46:09] benefits the Assembly of the Assembly
[46:12] that don't mean that at times that maybe
[46:15] I hadn't you know with other brothers or
[46:16] other times but I want ministry that
[46:19] have that blessed the Assembly and when
[46:20] I've been away I know one thing that
[46:23] brother Alexander he has has your heart
[46:26] and on upon his heart and I don't have
[46:28] to worry when and when that when when
[46:31] I'm away I know that no matter what
[46:33] would rise here what I've got confidence
[46:35] in is not in the flesh a brother
[46:37] Alexander McCool is I got confidence in
[46:39] in his contact with God so I really I
[46:41] really appreciate that and
[46:43] Alexander we love you you sister Maria
[46:46] god bless you this morning you if you if
[46:54] you're gonna get him get at me for that
[46:56] right there you meet me at the dessert
[46:57] table at the fellowship and we'll
[46:59] sweeten you up amen we want to remember
[47:06] here I want us to remember as most of
[47:08] you probably are aware of that little
[47:12] Liliana we've been praying for that we
[47:18] know that if God doesn't intervene even
[47:21] even now and that's the part that even
[47:23] when I prayed the other night even even
[47:26] now because it's not up to us it's not
[47:29] what what in terms as far as that that
[47:32] we would would say or declare it's God
[47:34] whatever the will of God is these things
[47:36] many times when they happen it's is
[47:39] sometimes the way a situation will go
[47:41] sometimes our mind it's things that we
[47:44] can't understand that this is we're
[47:46] trusting the Lord it comes in and we had
[47:50] prayer there the other night and and I
[47:53] want you to pray for them that's why
[47:55] brother Richard and sister Maria they're
[47:57] not here they'd been up there since
[48:01] Friday and back and forth and we're up
[48:03] there on Friday and we after just having
[48:08] prayer there in the room the group that
[48:10] was all gathered around and just a
[48:14] presence of the Lord so sweetly to come
[48:16] in there and what they were mentioning
[48:21] as I was standing right outside of there
[48:22] right after we even in the moment had
[48:25] had had come forth from prayer she she
[48:29] came to for a moment and she said it's
[48:32] okay
[48:35] so that's that was the part when I was
[48:38] standing there talking with brother
[48:39] Richard and sister Maria and sister
[48:40] Rachel
[48:41] now you say brother Samuel what does
[48:43] that mean I don't know I don't try to
[48:44] figure that out but I know one thing
[48:46] that if it is if it is of her time to
[48:51] cross on over I know one thing that
[48:53] death is not her master
[48:56] it's a servant can I move from this body
[49:00] right into that other body that is the
[49:04] comfort that we know and so we want to
[49:07] pray I want you to pray for for Joshua
[49:12] mr. Joshua - Joshua Sanchez that's the
[49:15] it's a daddy and brother Richard sister
[49:17] Maria one of their sons and also the
[49:20] mother Jaime and asked me to come in and
[49:24] pray and so we want to remember them in
[49:29] prayer within this time and you know I
[49:32] just say it like this I don't look at
[49:35] any situation as though it's over I
[49:37] still come to that city I still come to
[49:40] that even as I prayed that Friday my
[49:42] Friday before going to the hospital I
[49:44] thought of their standing in Lazarus and
[49:46] where Lazarus was there in the tomb and
[49:49] hear the testimony was even now even now
[49:54] and so we we we believe that as as as
[50:00] children of God and whether our healing
[50:03] comes here in this body or it comes when
[50:06] we stand there on the other side either
[50:08] way he's the Lord that he live all our
[50:10] diseases and so I also want to announce
[50:16] here brother
[50:18] brother Shane and sister Lily
[50:21] they have made their agreements to one

[54:17] Ephesians chapter 6 verse 10 I want to
[54:19] go and read there in Ephesians 10 verse
[54:24] 6 this is finally my brethren be strong
[54:32] in the Lord and in the power of his
[54:36] might put on the whole armour of God
[54:41] that you may be able to stand against
[54:44] the wiles of the devil for we wrestle
[54:48] not against flesh and blood but against
[54:52] principalities against powers against
[54:55] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[54:57] against spiritual wickedness in high
[55:00] places
[55:01] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[55:05] of God that you may be able to withstand
[55:08] in the evil day and having done all to
[55:13] stand stand therefore having your loins
[55:16] gird about with truth and having on the
[55:20] breastplate of righteousness and your
[55:24] feet shod with the preparation of the
[55:27] gospel of peace above all taking the
[55:30] shield of faith wherewith you shall be
[55:33] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[55:36] the wicked and take the helmet of
[55:39] salvation and the sword of the Spirit
[55:43] which is the word of God praying always
[55:45] with all prayer and supplication in the
[55:50] spirit and watching thereunto with all
[55:52] perseverance and supplication for All
[55:55] Saints may God bless you bless the
[55:58] reading of the word as you're being
[55:59] seated
[56:05] we've been looking at the thought and
[56:09] I've asked I asked brother Brian we'd
[56:13] sent out in the email when my notes had
[56:15] went out to you a visual that perhaps
[56:19] would help of where Paul would looking
[56:24] at one of these of the soldiers and Paul
[56:27] would the Holy Spirit would begin to
[56:30] inspire to him the armor that is given
[56:34] to us now just like in in in in the
[56:39] natural army and I've never been in the
[56:41] natural army navy or whatever more but I
[56:43] can only imagine that what they would
[56:46] release to you is exactly what you have
[56:49] need of now I don't know if in the
[56:52] natural if they you know if they just
[56:54] give you your you you know your fatigues
[56:57] or BTUs whatever you want to call them
[56:59] before they give you the obviously the
[57:01] dress blues a dress greens of things
[57:03] you're used to dress up and win that
[57:05] they release the weapons I I don't know
[57:07] all of that but I do know one thing
[57:08] that's for sure is that when God
[57:12] releases to us this armor he gives us
[57:16] every part of the armor when he makes
[57:20] the issue of his own life and we're
[57:23] talking about putting on the whole armor
[57:25] of God we're when when Paul is in
[57:28] speaking of this here he is dealing with
[57:31] that of where it is God's own life being
[57:36] filled with the Spirit of God where the
[57:40] word itself becomes flesh within our
[57:44] lives there's no way that you or I would
[57:46] be able or are able are to stand against
[57:50] the enemy or the wiles of the enemy or
[57:53] his deceptive tactic
[57:54] there is no way within our flesh or our
[57:57] mind none of that is a match for the
[58:01] enemy but there's only one that's more
[58:03] than a match for the enemy and that is
[58:06] the Lord Jesus Christ that is the Holy
[58:09] Ghost he can listen he can outsmart he
[58:11] can outfox us in our natural mind and
[58:15] our way of thinking but there's one one
[58:17] there's one that he cannot
[58:18] I do and that's the Holy Ghost he can't
[58:21] outdo the Holy Ghost and when you think
[58:24] of this when you look at it in our life
[58:26] you would look at this when we would see
[58:30] that of a soldier we can see all of that
[58:32] in itself that is is covered there on
[58:36] the outside with all of those different
[58:38] parts and yet when we're looking at it
[58:40] we think of we think of David as we've
[58:43] been looking at this parallel and
[58:45] running this as well because David was
[58:47] indeed one who was anointed to be king
[58:51] of Israel and through David through that
[58:53] anointing then it brought the strength
[58:56] of Israel it brought Almighty God back
[58:59] into power back into position has indeed
[59:03] the king of Israel David would be one
[59:06] that would declare he said he is my king
[59:09] Saul never said such a thing
[59:11] Saul everything was what Saul could do
[59:14] but David let it know that that though
[59:17] I'm King here but yet the king of here
[59:20] I'm only King because he has made me
[59:22] King and this is why that you and I can
[59:24] look at it when the scriptures where it
[59:26] says and that he hath made us kings and
[59:30] priests unto our God we have not made
[59:33] ourselves kings but he has made us kings
[59:35] and priests unto our God he is the king
[59:39] of saints he is our king that now that
[59:43] we are a part in that spiritual Kingdom
[59:45] think of it when David himself would
[59:48] come to that of the battle when David
[59:51] would come to that place in the you know
[59:53] coming there and and and Saul would see
[59:56] him David comes to before Saul with a
[1:00:00] testimony his testimony before Saul is
[1:00:04] the Lord hath delivered me out of the
[1:00:06] paw of the lion and out of the paw of
[1:00:09] the bear let me just say it like this
[1:00:10] this was not long-distance shooting he
[1:00:15] said out of the paws are you with me
[1:00:18] this was not like you know David having
[1:00:21] a rifle you know and being able to take
[1:00:23] that thing out you know it may be 350
[1:00:26] yards away no he was close enough back
[1:00:29] the breath was upon him
[1:00:32] you know what I'm talking about when
[1:00:35] tests and trials and things come that
[1:00:37] you can actually feel the breath of the
[1:00:40] enemy but David let it be known the Lord
[1:00:43] hath delivered me out of the paw of the
[1:00:46] lion out of the paw of the bear and he
[1:00:50] let's eat let's he let's all know that
[1:00:53] he's the same God
[1:00:54] he'll deliver me out of the hand of this
[1:00:56] Philistine sometimes there are things
[1:00:58] what we know as variables things that
[1:01:00] change but then there's a constant
[1:01:02] variable and that constant is God no
[1:01:05] matter what situation it is he still is
[1:01:08] the same hallelujah now we're looking at
[1:01:15] this remember when Saul here's David
[1:01:18] talking and immediately Saul would turn
[1:01:20] around and say hey go get my armor now
[1:01:23] Saul's armor was not something that was
[1:01:25] just kept out here outside of his tent
[1:01:27] there would be a place within a Saul's
[1:01:30] tent where this armor was kept there
[1:01:33] would be people who would watch over
[1:01:35] this armor and when it came time for
[1:01:37] Saul to go to battle they would come
[1:01:40] forth with a coat of mail they would put
[1:01:42] it on him they would they would put
[1:01:44] everything and hand to him what was
[1:01:47] needed when he was going to go into
[1:01:48] battle Saul was not going to go out
[1:01:50] there and fight Goliath but Saul calls
[1:01:53] for no doubt his armor bearer we would
[1:01:55] know that term in the scripture and here
[1:01:57] none doubtedly that armor bearer would
[1:02:00] bring all of these different instruments
[1:02:02] or our weapons of warfare and Saul would
[1:02:07] be arming David he put on the coat of
[1:02:09] mail the scripture tells us that all of
[1:02:11] these things David put along but David
[1:02:15] stood there in the midst of it and David
[1:02:17] said I can't go out with this armor on
[1:02:20] because I've not proved this you know
[1:02:23] what David was saying he said Saul you
[1:02:26] might be able to fight in this armor
[1:02:28] what's he narrowed it down to
[1:02:30] everybody's got to have their own
[1:02:32] personal experience with God you've got
[1:02:36] to know that that armor
[1:02:38] was not just a hand-me-down that armor
[1:02:41] was personally fitted for you and for me
[1:02:44] for the battle that we would engage let
[1:02:47] me tell you something the same God that
[1:02:50] fitted David the same God that fitted
[1:02:53] Peter that fitted Paul let me tell you
[1:02:55] something he's never changed the issuing
[1:02:59] of this armor he's never ever had to
[1:03:03] change his armor he's never had the
[1:03:06] study to update that how can we temper
[1:03:09] it more how can we make it better but
[1:03:11] this this very armor is the same armor
[1:03:14] this morning that you and I have the
[1:03:17] privilege to be clothed in with this
[1:03:19] same armor it has stood the test of time
[1:03:23] there are memorials all the way down
[1:03:26] through scripture that have stood there
[1:03:28] with this armor of the Lord and clothed
[1:03:30] there his spirit and they have remained
[1:03:34] victorious hallelujah the time we're
[1:03:40] living in you say this time is different
[1:03:43] but God is still the same God don't ever
[1:03:47] let the devil try to sell that to you he
[1:03:51] sold that bill of sale to many of people
[1:03:54] you'll never get over this you can never
[1:03:57] overcome that he's a liar I said he's
[1:04:02] alive because Jesus Christ stripped him
[1:04:05] of every power of every authority I want
[1:04:10] you to understand this this morning that
[1:04:12] devil is a defeated being he has been
[1:04:17] defeated by Lord Jesus Christ I mean put
[1:04:25] it in the words of the Prophet he said
[1:04:27] you're disputing with a defeated death
[1:04:32] you said what should I do and say come
[1:04:35] let my backbone be increase let
[1:04:38] everything rise in my heart and you
[1:04:40] stand there and call him a liar
[1:04:43] let us and you he seems this big what
[1:04:46] should i do say boo back
[1:04:48] foo-foo-foo-foo food and you watch that
[1:04:53] devil that seems so big I'll never get
[1:04:56] over this this mountain is so great take
[1:04:58] the word of God and safe boot devil boo
[1:05:02] devil now you might only be able to get
[1:05:07] out it ain't how loud you are here it's
[1:05:12] what's back here loose and I don't feel
[1:05:20] like I got that much faith silence that
[1:05:22] right now my question to you is do you
[1:05:25] believe that God keeps all this word do
[1:05:28] you believe that what God keeps all
[1:05:30] these word that God fulfills every
[1:05:32] promise that's the faith you need right
[1:05:35] there faith in something way out here
[1:05:39] faith is right there this is where the
[1:05:49] admonition comes to us in the hour as
[1:05:53] we've been looking at this where the
[1:05:56] Holy Spirit would write to the
[1:05:59] Philadelphian church age which we know
[1:06:01] that's the age of brotherly love that is
[1:06:05] the age where God would take a man by
[1:06:11] the name of John Wesley not John
[1:06:12] Wesley's choosing this was God that
[1:06:15] chose and here's the message that would
[1:06:17] fall upon that age you see you see when
[1:06:20] we read this where it says in
[1:06:22] Revelations 3:11 behold I come quickly
[1:06:26] we know that that was there has been
[1:06:28] hundreds of years as a matter of fact
[1:06:30] this scripture was written there it was
[1:06:33] given by inspiration to John while he
[1:06:36] was on the Isle of Patmos remember what
[1:06:38] John was witnessing on the Isle of
[1:06:41] Patmos
[1:06:41] is the coming of the Lord of how that
[1:06:44] God coming back in the form of his word
[1:06:47] and he would be clothed within his pride
[1:06:50] he would redeem his bride he goes in to
[1:06:53] break forth of how that God will come
[1:06:55] for his bride it moves into the place of
[1:06:58] how that God will come to visit the
[1:07:00] 144,000 how that God will even bring you
[1:07:04] know a Salvation there to those you know
[1:07:07] that would stand before the white throne
[1:07:09] judgment in all of these things it
[1:07:11] speaks of the coming of the Lord and yet
[1:07:13] you and I can look and say it's been
[1:07:15] hundreds of years but we know that that
[1:07:17] is a trick of the enemy because if he
[1:07:20] can cause you to look as far as in time
[1:07:22] of our time then we begin to get relaxed
[1:07:25] with things but if you can recognize
[1:07:27] that even though we look at 2000 years
[1:07:30] and even that of Calvary that was just
[1:07:33] like brother Brown will say like this he
[1:07:35] said that was just like that to God it
[1:07:38] was just like that to you and I look
[1:07:40] back in time and some of you that have
[1:07:42] had a little bit of years you know
[1:07:44] that's mounted up on the treads of your
[1:07:46] tires so to say in your alive you look
[1:07:48] down and then many times you wonder
[1:07:50] where did the last five years 10 years
[1:07:52] 20 years 30 years where in the world did
[1:07:54] they go tan moves on quickly and to
[1:07:57] recognize the ammunition of the Holy
[1:07:59] Spirit behold I come quickly
[1:08:02] hold fast which thou has and that no man
[1:08:06] take thy crown he's talking to sons and
[1:08:11] daughters of God its sons and daughters
[1:08:14] of God that will respond to the urgency
[1:08:17] of the Word of God it is something
[1:08:20] within you not that you have esteemed
[1:08:24] within yourself to make yourself but it
[1:08:26] is of the quality of the DNA of the
[1:08:29] election of God that when the Spirit of
[1:08:31] God moves on your life and your heart
[1:08:33] that's why you can't settle with just a
[1:08:36] status crawl life it's not enough for
[1:08:40] you just to be a part of of a group of
[1:08:43] people and come to church and it's
[1:08:45] something greater than that you see it
[1:08:47] much deeper in your life and you and you
[1:08:50] witness to it that the coming of the
[1:08:52] Lord is upon us I I want to live every
[1:08:55] day victorious for him I want to live in
[1:08:57] a manner to where there's no question
[1:08:59] who's sad I'm all and who I'm
[1:09:02] represented let me tell you something
[1:09:04] that is the move of the Holy Spirit upon
[1:09:07] that seed that's there on the inside not
[1:09:12] of him that we'll know as him that
[1:09:15] runneth but of God that shows mercy
[1:09:20] hallelujah it's impulses it's
[1:09:23] inspiration of the Holy Spirit that
[1:09:26] moves upon our life this is why brother
[1:09:30] Branham would pick up that statement and
[1:09:32] he would speak to us and say we've got a
[1:09:35] word for this hour it's to persevere
[1:09:39] don't give up put on the whole armor of
[1:09:42] God use every weapon he has given us
[1:09:48] we're not in a parade that comes on
[1:09:54] resurrection morning come on now we were
[1:09:59] not in a parade right now we're in a
[1:10:03] battle just so you know you don't even
[1:10:09] come to church with your dress blues on
[1:10:12] there'll be a day for you to put them on
[1:10:15] there'll be a day when there's a change
[1:10:17] coming but in the meantime you're
[1:10:20] hearing your fatigues and your btus
[1:10:22] you're here reporting for duty
[1:10:24] you've got shoes that need to be shot
[1:10:27] you've got a belt that's kind of get
[1:10:29] tightened up every once in a while gets
[1:10:31] a little slack gets a little loose and
[1:10:33] you've got to tighten it up is that
[1:10:37] right all of these parts together that
[1:10:40] wants the army issues these weapons
[1:10:43] there is not a sergeant going to come
[1:10:46] around you know that's why for many it's
[1:10:48] good you know and then maybe they go
[1:10:49] because now mama ain't gonna be coming
[1:10:51] and straighten them up and mama ain't
[1:10:53] gonna be doing this and mama ain't gonna
[1:10:55] be doing that it's okay for a mama to do
[1:10:57] some things but there is a part of it
[1:10:59] where it comes to a place you
[1:11:01] got to be able to stand on your own two
[1:11:02] feet the sergeant is not going to come
[1:11:04] in there and say hey hey you know what I
[1:11:06] got your boots for you you got a busy
[1:11:08] week I'll take care of your boots for
[1:11:09] you the sergeant said you're busy this
[1:11:11] is life as a soldier but still other you
[1:11:14] know my shoes you know it's been a
[1:11:16] hectic week there will be inspection
[1:11:19] outside of the barracks and I expect
[1:11:22] your shoes to be shod with the
[1:11:24] preparation of the gospel free ends why
[1:11:28] would that sergeant that would be a
[1:11:30] platoon sergeant why would he make such
[1:11:33] a stand in that way he said because he
[1:11:35] does not love his men no quite the
[1:11:37] contrary he loves his men to such a
[1:11:40] place to wear when there's times that
[1:11:43] they don't feel like going just to let
[1:11:46] him know you must go on and every detail
[1:11:50] is important for victory because after
[1:11:55] all it is the little foxes that spoil
[1:12:01] the vine so we want to say get rid of
[1:12:08] that carefree attitude or well count on
[1:12:09] mind
[1:12:10] God understands and God cares and every
[1:12:15] once in a while the Lord has to drop us
[1:12:17] for some push-ups you know push-ups our
[1:12:20] humility face before the dirt to let us
[1:12:24] realize you have no strength and no
[1:12:26] power on your own
[1:12:27] I am your strength I am your defense I
[1:12:30] am your all-in-all oh you say brother
[1:12:33] Samuel we don't need that oh yes we do
[1:12:35] need it Paul needed it Paul matter of
[1:12:38] fact packing around the revelation of
[1:12:40] Jesus Christ greater than any of those
[1:12:42] other men that had it but he would say
[1:12:45] to you and I that he said there was a
[1:12:47] messenger of Satan that was given to me
[1:12:50] to buffin me in the flesh he would pray
[1:12:53] get better then it would come back pray
[1:12:55] get better then it would come back why
[1:12:57] was this lest I should be exalted above
[1:13:01] concerning the abundance of revelation
[1:13:04] that's given to me I'll be honest and
[1:13:07] you can be honest too if it was up to
[1:13:08] you and I to try to keep ourselves in
[1:13:11] that place I believe that we all just
[1:13:13] say law
[1:13:14] helped me to stay humble but God knows
[1:13:16] exactly what you and I have made out
[1:13:18] that you and I can even be equipped and
[1:13:20] be helped to stay in a place of humility
[1:13:22] oh boy I don't get somewhere today I
[1:13:27] don't want we'll get somewhere notice
[1:13:30] this use every weapon he has given you
[1:13:34] so these are not weapons that you put up
[1:13:36] on the wall and I'm going to mount these
[1:13:38] on my wall no you got to use them and
[1:13:40] use every gift at our disposal and look
[1:13:46] ahead with joy because we are going to
[1:13:49] be crowned by him who is our king of
[1:13:51] kings and Lord of lords now let's look
[1:13:54] at this let's break in on this here
[1:13:56] we've looked at some of the first part
[1:13:57] of our armor let's look in here into the
[1:14:00] shield of faith enact in Ephesians 6
[1:14:03] verse 16 it says above all taking the
[1:14:06] shield of faith and that word above all
[1:14:10] it was not so much speaking of that it's
[1:14:11] more important than the rest of them but
[1:14:14] the word above all means to put this
[1:14:16] upon or before there were times where
[1:14:20] the shield would have to be up because
[1:14:22] the flights of arrows and things were
[1:14:24] becoming from above there are times
[1:14:26] where it's got to be moved to the side
[1:14:28] there are times where it's got to be in
[1:14:30] front of the soldier but notice above
[1:14:33] all in other words above or in position
[1:14:36] between you and the enemy taking the
[1:14:39] shield of faith wherewith you shall be
[1:14:42] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[1:14:44] the wicked Balarama would pick it up
[1:14:46] like this and greatest never fought
[1:14:47] makes just a simple statement that's the
[1:14:50] one he says that knocks off the darts
[1:14:53] now if you notice when we look at the
[1:14:56] shield let's look at the shield here
[1:14:58] just a few moments in Genesis 15 1 here
[1:15:01] is where the Lord would speak to Abraham
[1:15:03] in a vision and says fear not Abram I am
[1:15:08] thy shield and thy exceeding great
[1:15:13] reward now think about this when this is
[1:15:17] made known to Abraham this is exactly
[1:15:20] when Abram remember heard about lot was
[1:15:22] taken captive and lot had nope
[1:15:25] our to withstand the enemy but Avram
[1:15:27] because of the separated life notice his
[1:15:30] name had not even been changed yet are
[1:15:32] you hearing me this morning his name had
[1:15:34] not even been changed yet if we can say
[1:15:37] like this Abram had not even received
[1:15:39] the Holy Ghost but it shows the power of
[1:15:42] a separated life before God when you
[1:15:45] will separate yourself according to the
[1:15:48] Word of God you receive authority of the
[1:15:52] word backing you up and the Bible says
[1:15:55] Abram took his trained armed servants
[1:15:58] and they went after all those kings
[1:16:00] these were kings these were rulers but
[1:16:03] Abram was under the leadership of the
[1:16:06] king himself and notice after coming out
[1:16:10] of this panel fear not I am thy shield
[1:16:14] wonder how many times that Abram but
[1:16:17] there were things that came along his
[1:16:19] pathway that tried to take his life will
[1:16:21] be life suck you and me I wonder if God
[1:16:23] would let us know how many times this
[1:16:25] week where Satan has attempted to try to
[1:16:28] take our lives whether it's this week or
[1:16:31] the week before but to think about how
[1:16:33] that God himself has been right there as
[1:16:35] a shield around our life we walk every
[1:16:38] day when you step into the schools you
[1:16:41] step into the hospitals you step into
[1:16:43] the stores you walk in your
[1:16:45] neighborhoods there are demons all
[1:16:47] around there are spirits all around it
[1:16:52] isn't just saying well we don't live
[1:16:54] near this section of town there ain't so
[1:16:56] many Devils over here know some of them
[1:16:58] educated devils are more worse than all
[1:17:01] the demons of prostitution and alcohol
[1:17:04] and everything else it's those old
[1:17:06] religious demons they are some of the
[1:17:09] worst devils that there are but he let
[1:17:14] it be known to Abram don't you worry
[1:17:17] about where you go when I moved upon
[1:17:19] your heart I want you to know that I am
[1:17:22] thy shield aren't you glad you've got a
[1:17:25] shield Oh hallelujah Deuteronomy 33 29
[1:17:31] happy art thou o Israel
[1:17:35] some you need to let your face know that
[1:17:37] this morning who is like unto thee o
[1:17:40] people saved by the Lord the shield of
[1:17:45] thy help second samuel 22 verse 1 and
[1:17:51] David spake unto the Lord the words of
[1:17:54] this song in the day that the Lord had
[1:17:58] delivered him out of the hand of all his
[1:18:00] enemies and out of the hand of Saul
[1:18:03] now this inspiration for this song it
[1:18:06] came out of a victory and want nothing
[1:18:09] against the songs that David already had
[1:18:11] in the songbook but David received the
[1:18:13] fresh song from God of an experience in
[1:18:16] his life and David said you know what
[1:18:18] since Bob just gave me this inspiration
[1:18:20] I think I'll sing it for a special are
[1:18:24] you with me well he may not have been in
[1:18:27] the only belief songbook but it came
[1:18:28] from only believed in God in the day
[1:18:35] that the Lord had delivered him out of
[1:18:37] the hand of all his enemies and out of
[1:18:39] the hand of Saul and he said the Lord is
[1:18:43] my rock and my fortress and my deliverer
[1:18:47] the god of my rock in him will I trust
[1:18:52] he is my shield not was not will be he
[1:18:57] is my shield in him will I trust and the
[1:19:03] Horn of my salvation in my high tower my
[1:19:06] refuge my Savior thou save us me from
[1:19:10] violence Psalms 1830 and then funny when
[1:19:13] we begin to read this right here so
[1:19:15] looked at David and said boy you ain't
[1:19:16] got no armor David said you just can't
[1:19:19] see it
[1:19:21] David's testifying out his armor this
[1:19:24] was not something that David was you
[1:19:27] know a soul man showmanship
[1:19:28] David was testified on his armor from a
[1:19:32] personal experience if you can really
[1:19:35] look at it this morning the shield of
[1:19:37] paint that you're carrying it might be
[1:19:40] ever so tattered there might be parts of
[1:19:43] the leather opponent letter somewhat
[1:19:45] ripped but I'll tell you it has kept you
[1:19:48] safe this far that Shield of faith has
[1:19:51] quenched many fiery darts and when the
[1:19:54] enemy says get up give up it ain't no
[1:19:57] use that ain't workin you said the belts
[1:19:59] on tight I'm standing here by the grace
[1:20:02] of God I am not letting down my shield
[1:20:06] [Applause]
[1:20:10] well let's let him testify a little bit
[1:20:12] more Psalms 1830s for God his way is
[1:20:17] perfect the word of the Lord is trying
[1:20:20] he is a buckler that shield to all those
[1:20:24] that trust in him somes 28-7 the Lord is
[1:20:29] my strength and my shield my heart
[1:20:32] trusted in him and I am helped my heart
[1:20:39] trusted in him and I am helped therefore
[1:20:42] o my heart greatly rejoice it there's
[1:20:49] the difference bestia if it's trusting
[1:20:52] in ourselves it's fear but if we can
[1:20:56] just have it so it trust in him then we
[1:20:58] can rejoice what the victory already
[1:21:00] belongs to us Lord I'm going to trust in
[1:21:05] you well I don't understand it trusting
[1:21:08] is not about that you understand you
[1:21:10] simply know that we sing this morning
[1:21:12] we've got rivers that are impossible
[1:21:14] we've got mountains that we can't tunnel
[1:21:16] through but our trust is in the Lord
[1:21:20] how's this gonna be I don't know how
[1:21:22] God's going to bring it to pass but it
[1:21:24] is in his hands he is my help therefore
[1:21:29] my life greatly rejoices and with my
[1:21:32] sound o glory be to God with my song I
[1:21:36] will praise him David but you don't see
[1:21:41] every II don't see every enemy defeated
[1:21:44] oh no yes I do in
[1:21:46] him I am help he is my strength there
[1:21:49] might be things that I'm dealing with
[1:21:51] right now but my song is going to praise
[1:21:54] him see what needs to happen is you need
[1:22:01] to get your hearts off your willow trees
[1:22:04] some you've been taken captive in your
[1:22:06] minds come on like Israel got taken
[1:22:09] captive down into Babylon we might have
[1:22:12] got taken captive in our minds there
[1:22:14] might have been places where you've been
[1:22:15] taken captive don't don't you let that
[1:22:17] heart sail on that willow tree you go up
[1:22:20] there and get that heart down and say
[1:22:21] I'm going back to Zion I'm going back to
[1:22:24] the place where I can sing the songs of
[1:22:26] Zion I'm going right back to that place
[1:22:28] you might say right here well I'm still
[1:22:31] hearing this remember it is your heart
[1:22:33] when your heart makes contact with God

[1:22:45] you Psalms 91 one he that dwelleth in
[1:22:55] the secret place of the Most High shall

[1:23:34] refuge my fortress my god in him will I
[1:23:40] trust surely he shall deliver thee from
[1:23:45] the snare of the Fowler Oh God
[1:23:47] did you rehear what that you said it
[1:23:50] didn't say that you would not fall into
[1:23:52] snares and traps along the way it said
[1:23:55] he shall surely
[1:23:57] deliver me from the snare of the flower
[1:24:01] blow repeat Oh God
[1:24:03] and from the noisome pestilence he shall
[1:24:08] cover thee with his feathers and under
[1:24:11] his wings shalt thou trust his truth
[1:24:15] shall be thy shield and buckler thou
[1:24:21] shalt not be afraid for the terror by
[1:24:25] night nor for the arrow that flies by
[1:24:29] day brother Brennan was said just like
[1:24:32] this with that shield of faith in one
[1:24:34] place of the message he said oh my this
[1:24:36] great armor of God all he said that
[1:24:39] helmet of salvation this great big
[1:24:42] shield the size of a door of faith the
[1:24:49] actual word and term of shield is first
[1:24:53] known as a door before it ever became an
[1:24:59] instrument of protection where a soldier
[1:25:02] would wear it it was first known the
[1:25:05] word that is used was first known as a
[1:25:08] door and let me tell you something there
[1:25:11] ain't a wolf that can get in the
[1:25:14] sheepfold it's got to come through the
[1:25:17] shepherd the Shepherd he don't have up a
[1:25:21] wooden door with all kinds of gates and
[1:25:23] bars the Shepherd is the door him set
[1:25:27] the Shepherd lays down in the door
[1:25:31] there's not a wolf there's nothing can
[1:25:33] get by him he is there laying in the
[1:25:36] door it would have to cross over him to
[1:25:39] be able to even get to you he is our
[1:25:43] shield so we're not fighting with a
[1:25:48] little you know looks like a little dish
[1:25:50] as we'll get into in a moment this is
[1:25:53] not the Sun this is not the shield's
[1:25:55] that was given out that after the Romans
[1:25:57] many years we read in 300 BC these are
[1:26:00] not the little round shields that we're
[1:26:02] talking about or Paul was descriptive
[1:26:04] describing to you and I notice in David
[1:26:07] solves three one I'm sure we can relate
[1:26:08] to this
[1:26:09] when David was fleeing from Absalon this
[1:26:13] was not Seoul now this was things within
[1:26:16] the family come on now it was important
[1:26:21] that remember remembered tests and
[1:26:23] trials will come but remember don't use
[1:26:26] your armor on one another that sword is
[1:26:29] deadly no use it on one another just
[1:26:32] redirect how do I recognize many times
[1:26:34] how brother branham would tell us he
[1:26:36] said recognize it's not your brother
[1:26:38] it's not your sister that's doing that
[1:26:40] it is a spirit that is doing that this
[1:26:43] is spiritual warfare oh my that's where
[1:26:48] it comes down with families and
[1:26:49] everything else well we could just
[1:26:51] preach a family message right now notice
[1:26:54] this Lord how are they increased that
[1:26:58] trouble me let's just be honest every
[1:27:02] one of us been there
[1:27:04] Lord how are they increase that are
[1:27:06] troubling me shield of faith many are
[1:27:15] they that rise up against me many there
[1:27:21] be which say of my soul there is no help
[1:27:27] for him in God now let me remind you

[1:27:41] post de life let's say man what are you

[1:27:50] never lets up he doesn't say he foreknew
[1:27:54] defeated alot he'll be right back there
[1:27:56] the next day many there be that say of
[1:28:04] my soul there is no help for him in God
[1:28:11] right now it would be a good time to
[1:28:13] have a good praise break right now
[1:28:14] because there were a lot of Devils that
[1:28:17] wrote you and I all if said there ain't
[1:28:19] no help for him
[1:28:21] you can't help him his life is too
[1:28:23] messed up his life is in too much
[1:28:25] shambles look at their life their life
[1:28:28] is a mess merely said of my soul there
[1:28:31] is no help for God for him in God but
[1:28:36] here's the response but Thou O Lord are
[1:28:40] a shield for me my glory and the lifter
[1:28:45] of my head hallelu you are not the
[1:28:51] devil's punching bag

[1:29:03] where is enemy trained with knockout
[1:29:08] punches don't sit there and take it on
[1:29:11] in David ends that scripture in verse
[1:29:15] tell with an important Lord said but
[1:29:21] Thou O Lord art a shield for me my glory
[1:29:24] and the lifter up of my head every one
[1:29:35] of us sitting here have been in this
[1:29:36] place not just way out in the past you
[1:29:41] know he's the one that gives you the
[1:29:42] strength to lift your head encouragement
[1:29:48] to keep going on and as a faithful
[1:29:52] soldier here you are your use and every
[1:29:54] gift at your disposal Lord at Northam an
[1:29:56] of God you know what I've got need of
[1:29:59] right now if my shoes need to be
[1:30:01] tightened up if my belt needs to be
[1:30:03] tight enough Lord whatever this need is
[1:30:05] in my life because sometimes we don't
[1:30:07] even know exactly what they need is but
[1:30:09] we simply know that we're needed we said
[1:30:11] Lord that gift that you place there that
[1:30:13] gift is for me that gift of healing is
[1:30:16] for me that gift of tongues is for me
[1:30:18] that gift of a pastor apostle teacher
[1:30:21] evangelist prophet every one of those
[1:30:23] gifts are from me the gift within the
[1:30:25] song leader that's for me
[1:30:28] every one of those gifts are at my
[1:30:29] disposal no repeater God
[1:30:36] sums 511 but let all those that put
[1:30:41] their trust in thee rejoice huh let them
[1:30:47] ever shout for joy
[1:30:49] Wow is this a workup no it's not a
[1:30:53] workup because thou defend us then how
[1:31:01] in the world can you have junk because
[1:31:03] of who's defending me if I'm looking at
[1:31:09] myself I've got enough reason to be down
[1:31:11] but I'm looking to him who defends me
[1:31:14] let them also that love thy name be
[1:31:19] truthful in the Psalms 5:12 for thou
[1:31:24] Lord will bless the righteous with favor
[1:31:29] wilt thou compass him surround him
[1:31:33] as with a shield sounds like David knew
[1:31:39] what battle he knew this was warfare he
[1:31:43] knew this was a constant war but the
[1:31:45] Greg he knew he was engaged every day of
[1:31:47] his life
[1:31:48] that's why brother Ram will take it in
[1:31:50] the message contest he said many people
[1:31:52] believe he said he said that you know
[1:31:54] the Holy Ghost is nothing but a good
[1:31:55] thought he said them same people believe
[1:31:57] that the devil is no more than a bad
[1:31:59] thought he said that once he said God
[1:32:01] got a hold of my life he said I run
[1:32:03] headlong into him every day we run
[1:32:06] headlong into the devil every day but
[1:32:09] listen our life is not bound up in fear
[1:32:12] I don't know what tomorrow holds I don't
[1:32:15] know what the next day holds but I know
[1:32:17] who is defending me
[1:32:20] [Applause]
[1:32:22] the devil wants to shoot his darts of
[1:32:25] worry try to make us worry try to get it
[1:32:30] upon us mind trying for us to think
[1:32:32] about it but remember who's defending
[1:32:35] you Psalms 119 114 thou art person
[1:32:41] thou art my hiding place and my shield I
[1:32:45] hope in time word proverbs 30 verse 5
[1:32:51] every word of God is pure he is a shield
[1:32:56] unto them that put their trust in him oh
[1:33:01] my brother Brendan would pick it up like
[1:33:04] this or he says the name of the Lord or
[1:33:06] there is a tower where the righteous run
[1:33:08] into and are safe he said aren't you
[1:33:10] glad to be in there tonight the great
[1:33:12] safety zone where all the devil's darts
[1:33:16] are passed away by our Shield of faith
[1:33:19] to know that we are standing in that
[1:33:22] safety zone anchored in Christ safe as
[1:33:26] we can be in there not even death itself
[1:33:30] can harm us we've already died
[1:33:33] our lives are hidden God through Christ
[1:33:35] sealed in there by the Holy Ghost what a
[1:33:43] shield that we have what a protection
[1:33:49] that we have around our lives now watch
[1:33:54] how David you know David would bring
[1:33:56] this even more personal I believe it's
[1:34:00] personal but notice how David would
[1:34:02] bring this around in science second
[1:34:04] Samuel 22 verse 35 he teaches my hands
[1:34:11] to war no wait a minute brother Sammy
[1:34:15] you said I'm to have joy in him because
[1:34:18] he's the one that's defending me he is
[1:34:21] but he's using you it's not so much he's
[1:34:27] using your flesh he's seated there in
[1:34:30] the seat of power in the throne of your
[1:34:33] heart he's not seated in your spirits
[1:34:37] come on now but he is seated right there
[1:34:40] as the ruler of this city this is why
[1:34:46] the Bible would say in the book of
[1:34:47] Proverbs greater is he that rule of his
[1:34:50] city than he that taketh the city
[1:34:52] [Music]
[1:34:53] because there's gates into this city and
[1:34:56] you've got a rule over those gates of
[1:34:57] imagination conscience reasoning and so
[1:34:59] forth but we rule by the power of God
[1:35:03] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:06] the armor of God in our soul what are
[1:35:14] you saying
[1:35:15] we need the shield of faith when our
[1:35:18] soul has been sealed it's got the shield
[1:35:20] of God right over it the devil can never
[1:35:23] I don't care what the devil came to you
[1:35:26] with once that seal had once that seal
[1:35:28] of the Holy Ghost has moved on that soul
[1:35:30] and that nature has been changed there
[1:35:31] is nothing that can touch that soul and
[1:35:35] as a matter of fact before the seal was
[1:35:38] ever put on there what nothing could
[1:35:40] touch it the devil tried to take your
[1:35:42] life come on now it was just like Moses
[1:35:46] Moses was a little baby and here is mama
[1:35:48] put him there in that Ark and she put
[1:35:51] pitch Oh glory to God
[1:35:53] she put pitch on that little art and she
[1:35:56] sent that little Ark down the river
[1:35:58] there were alligators or crocodiles
[1:36:01] forgive me for not being politically
[1:36:02] correct they were glowing right down
[1:36:04] that river there were crocodiles in that
[1:36:07] school I mean in that climbing in that
[1:36:08] collagen and I made it down that Street
[1:36:10] there were crocodiles all the way but I
[1:36:13] will tell you something
[1:36:14] there was a token
[1:36:16] that middle I look pitch of the Holy
[1:36:20] Ghost has been applied holiday Bella
[1:36:27] bottom said when every crocodile would
[1:36:30] come up on that he said that crocodile
[1:36:32] would go to open its mouth and get a
[1:36:36] little whiff of that pitch turn away I'm
[1:36:43] telling you he's a shield on your family
[1:36:48] he's a shield on your family how alone
[1:36:55] he teaches my hands toward so this is
[1:37:00] evident that you and I have something to
[1:37:03] do so we just didn't get this armor that
[1:37:07] they've been displaying up there we just
[1:37:08] didn't get this armor and we come around
[1:37:10] and sit down I mean really sitting
[1:37:13] around in that kind of armor that's
[1:37:14] uncomfortable you don't want to sit
[1:37:17] around that kind of armor and say hey
[1:37:18] let's go for a steak dinner not in that
[1:37:19] kind of armor that armor is put on to
[1:37:22] fight with brother Samuel it seems like
[1:37:26] test after trial after test after trial
[1:37:30] when do I get rest you ask the question
[1:37:35] on me the time said we ask God for the
[1:37:40] rest for peace and he gives us the best
[1:37:43] that he can give us tests and trials
[1:37:46] tests and trials he said but what he
[1:37:49] does he said those tests and trials are
[1:37:51] like horses he just puts bits in their
[1:37:54] mouth and he makes them obey Him you see
[1:37:57] it's working out for purpose of God for
[1:37:59] his glory he said right here we're going
[1:38:02] through tests and droughts but our rest
[1:38:04] comes just across river in the meantime
[1:38:09] he teaches my hands to war
[1:38:15] verse 36 of that same chapter valve
[1:38:19] hast also given me the shield of thy
[1:38:27] salvation
[1:38:30] so this he is our shield
[1:38:33] he is our protection those who put their
[1:38:35] trust in him those who trusting in his
[1:38:38] word he is our defence and he has given
[1:38:43] us a shield let me tell you the same
[1:38:45] kind of shield he's given it's not a
[1:38:47] lesser quality this is the same shield
[1:38:49] that the second Adam came with hey Matt
[1:38:55] wear one of God's daughters in the
[1:38:57] beginning in the Garden of Eden she let
[1:38:59] go on that shield but here is one who
[1:39:01] stood right in the midst of battle with
[1:39:04] the issue remember the Bible said he
[1:39:06] came with righteousness as a breastplate
[1:39:08] he came with the shield of faith he
[1:39:12] never defeated the devil as one who was
[1:39:15] in mighty power he never defeated the
[1:39:18] devil with a divine gift or the
[1:39:20] supernatural in his life he defeated him
[1:39:23] as a son of God by the Word of God
[1:39:34] he's our shield
[1:39:35] he's our protection now notice this let
[1:39:40] me just try to bring this in here just a
[1:39:42] little bit we'll see where we can maybe
[1:39:44] just to get to a little spot here this
[1:39:46] morning and saw Amen in Ephesians 6 16
[1:39:50] again above all taking taking the shield
[1:39:55] of faith wherewith you shall be able to
[1:40:01] quench
[1:40:03] Oh somebody say all the fiery darts of
[1:40:08] the wicked not just some of them brother
[1:40:12] joy all of them all of them
[1:40:18] this shield of faith above all in
[1:40:21] position in between upon our lives in
[1:40:26] between us and the enemy notice as it
[1:40:32] said the focus that Paul draws we
[1:40:35] understand that a shield this times
[1:40:38] where you're going to have swords
[1:40:41] they're going to be sword fighting going
[1:40:43] on but Paul doesn't draw the attention
[1:40:46] to that of the sword Paul draws the
[1:40:51] attention that with this shield of faith
[1:40:53] you'll be able to quench all the fiery
[1:40:56] darts of the wicked one that word quench
[1:40:59] it means to extinguish or to put out
[1:41:03] things that are caught on fire so I need
[1:41:11] the shield of faith you need to seal the
[1:41:13] faith to do what is sting guaa sh or
[1:41:16] quench the shield of faith does not stop
[1:41:20] the devil from firing fiery darts but
[1:41:24] the shield of faith can put out the fire
[1:41:28] that's why we need it now let's look
[1:41:31] here just a little bit here at this
[1:41:32] shield just for a few moments this
[1:41:35] shield itself
[1:41:36] it was rectangular in shape just like
[1:41:38] what brother brian has up there
[1:41:39] it was rectangular in shape it was about
[1:41:41] two foot wide and four foot long this
[1:41:43] shield that that was given and Paul was
[1:41:45] taken this inspiration from it was a
[1:41:47] shield that was given to protect the
[1:41:49] body it was a shield that many of the
[1:41:51] Roman mothers would tell their boys when
[1:41:53] they went out they would say let that
[1:41:55] shield not only protect you but if there
[1:41:57] should happen to be conflict let it be a
[1:41:59] buyer ABI ier which would be like that
[1:42:01] which would carry back to your body and
[1:42:03] bring your body back home to me for a
[1:42:06] proper burial this is how large or how
[1:42:09] big that this shield was you can
[1:42:11] understand with just even if it was a
[1:42:13] smaller shield but let alone it's a big
[1:42:15] shield like this you
[1:42:16] to have everything else in place and
[1:42:18] tightened up the belts got to be tight
[1:42:20] you can't afford to be dragging your
[1:42:22] sword you can't afford that because you
[1:42:24] have this shield that is in front of you
[1:42:26] now the shield itself oh my it would
[1:42:28] weigh you know a great amount already I
[1:42:31] think it was you know somewhere well I
[1:42:32] don't want to quote exactly the figure
[1:42:34] this morning but within that the shield
[1:42:36] itself would be made up of that of wood
[1:42:39] and it would have a certain thickness of
[1:42:42] it of wood it would be on the on the
[1:42:44] part of the shield that you and I would
[1:42:45] see right there that part he would be
[1:42:48] all covered on the outside with leather
[1:42:50] it would cover it with leather now in
[1:42:52] the midst of the battle when they were
[1:42:54] in the midst of let's say a sword fight
[1:42:56] they would actually take that leather
[1:42:58] and they would point or put oil upon it
[1:43:01] and anoint the leather with oils so that
[1:43:03] the swords would just move off of that
[1:43:05] shield very quickly and that wonderful
[1:43:08] how powerful it is to be under the
[1:43:10] anointing of the Holy Ghost it takes
[1:43:12] more than just being in a good service
[1:43:14] you need to say Lord let the leather of
[1:43:16] this line let it absorb the oil of the
[1:43:19] Holy Spirit because I'm gonna be in
[1:43:21] hand-to-hand combat no doubt this week
[1:43:24] but I want my shield oil up real good to
[1:43:27] wear when I meet the devil and he tries
[1:43:29] to run that sword he tries to wear me
[1:43:32] out with quotes tries to wear me out
[1:43:34] with scriptures I want that seal to be
[1:43:37] Psalm 19 there with the oil of Almighty
[1:43:40] God that the sword will slip right off
[1:43:42] of him there was also more care to this
[1:43:49] shield when the soldiers were aware
[1:43:52] because there was things that you would
[1:43:55] realize that between the warfare there
[1:43:57] was advancements in their techniques
[1:43:59] that they would use so they would come
[1:44:02] into ways to try to counteract this
[1:44:05] advancement so there would be what Paul
[1:44:07] was talking about firing darts when the
[1:44:11] soldiers themselves before going into
[1:44:13] battle knowing that they might be
[1:44:15] possibly heading into or before an enemy
[1:44:17] where there's gonna be fiery darts even
[1:44:19] when they did not know this they would
[1:44:21] take their shields and they would set
[1:44:23] their shields down the in water and they
[1:44:27] would leave them shields in water over
[1:44:30] night they would go to sleep and leave
[1:44:32] him in water overnight you know why
[1:44:34] because the shields would soak up the
[1:44:37] water now the shields would be heavier
[1:44:40] to carry but they would have water in
[1:44:42] them that when that fiery dart would go
[1:44:44] to come they'd be able to hold up that
[1:44:46] saturated shield that was saturated with
[1:44:50] water and that would actually absorb or
[1:44:53] it would establish that fiery dart that
[1:44:57] would come but then as the day would
[1:44:59] wear on sometimes
[1:45:04] maybe lunch time comes around dinner
[1:45:08] time comes around it's no longer Southie
[1:45:12] wet no more and about that time you're
[1:45:17] on your way home or you're getting ready
[1:45:19] to leave and here comes you should
[1:45:23] shield faith and it's not saturated with
[1:45:26] water no more lights on it it starts to
[1:45:31] burn
[1:45:32] you know the tendency and the reason
[1:45:35] that this was used among soldiers why
[1:45:37] beginning me would use that is because
[1:45:40] when they would fire that fiery dart it
[1:45:42] would be me would look like they're just
[1:45:44] like a comet that was going through and
[1:45:46] if you get light upon that shield and
[1:45:48] the shield it looked like oh my goodness
[1:45:50] it's on fire
[1:45:51] it would be a temptation for the soldier
[1:45:53] to throw down his shield you understand
[1:45:59] me now
[1:45:59] it ain't Sam that very fiery darts that
[1:46:02] won't hit you humor times you'll feel
[1:46:05] the flame no doubt you have you feel the
[1:46:08] flame of those charts sometimes they
[1:46:10] come all around your like my goodness
[1:46:12] this flame but remember you have a
[1:46:15] shield that's able to estill
[1:46:24] this fiery darts these things were
[1:46:26] amazing very amazing when you think of
[1:46:34] it why would we need the shield of faith
[1:46:39] to quench the fiery darts of the enemy
[1:46:43] why would we need them we have on the
[1:46:46] whole armor of God well the whole armor
[1:46:47] of God part of it is the shield of faith
[1:46:50] it's because when you got the Holy Ghost
[1:46:52] one part of you got sealed there's two
[1:46:56] parts of you that's still highly
[1:46:59] combustible there's still two parts of
[1:47:04] you that went fiery darts come that can
[1:47:07] be inflamed come on now
[1:47:13] now these fiery darts this is really
[1:47:15] this is really something here you look
[1:47:18] at how that they would study this and
[1:47:20] they would take pieces of cane I guess
[1:47:24] like sugar cane they would take pieces
[1:47:26] of cane someone would use some different
[1:47:28] things but they would make sure that it
[1:47:29] was Hollow and they're thin that hollow
[1:47:32] part they would actually put flammable
[1:47:33] liquid many would use alcohol they would
[1:47:35] use combustible liquid and they would
[1:47:37] fill up the actual shaft of that arrow
[1:47:40] just so happens I've got one here they
[1:47:44] would fill up the shaft of that arrow
[1:47:49] with flammable liquid they would take
[1:47:52] the end of it and the tip of it they
[1:47:56] would take that tip and they would wrap
[1:47:58] it or dress it in tow or pitch so they
[1:48:04] could light it on fire and it was tied
[1:48:06] here on the inside so what would happen
[1:48:10] when they would fire out these arrows
[1:48:12] were the Joey what would take place as
[1:48:14] soon as that arrow would hit it was made
[1:48:16] in such a way that the tip itself having
[1:48:19] all of that would disengage when it
[1:48:22] disengaged as soon as that arrow hits
[1:48:24] you the liquid would go over you and the
[1:48:28] fire that was on the pitch would ignite
[1:48:30] the liquid that they put in there sounds
[1:48:34] like the devil don't he knows how to
[1:48:39] fire temptations he knows how to fire
[1:48:42] things that are like come on now he
[1:48:44] feels it with flammable liquid
[1:48:47] but remember greater is he that is in
[1:48:50] you glory be to God now let's look here
[1:48:56] just a moment let me let me just you
[1:48:57] know skip here just just for a moment
[1:49:00] brother branham would make a statement
[1:49:02] like this when when we're looking at it
[1:49:04] within that of temptation and things
[1:49:08] that would come our way and when look at
[1:49:10] this and how than in our lives we would
[1:49:13] face or feel these fiery darts that
[1:49:16] would come our way he would he would go
[1:49:18] on and he would speak of how that the
[1:49:20] fiery darts themselves would try to come
[1:49:23] at us he would speak of how that in our
[1:49:25] lives once our lives we have been filled
[1:49:28] with the Spirit of God or he would go on
[1:49:30] to say when you say you've got the Holy
[1:49:33] Ghost he said you have become a target
[1:49:38] you walk around I walk around with the
[1:49:41] target on us and that target is the seal
[1:49:45] of the Holy Ghost let me read this to
[1:49:47] you
[1:49:48] is it possible brother Ram says for a
[1:49:50] Holy Ghost field person to be driven to
[1:49:52] do minor things influence to do minor
[1:49:54] things that he doesn't want to do he
[1:49:57] said oh yes sir a Holy Ghost field
[1:49:59] person you're writing the place
[1:50:01] then to be drove by these things you
[1:50:02] just put yourself up a target when
[1:50:05] you're down there serving the devil he
[1:50:07] just lets you slouch around any way you
[1:50:09] want to but once you take a stand for
[1:50:12] Christ you've got on the other side then
[1:50:14] he trains every gun right around on you
[1:50:19] you ever think he's picking on you guess
[1:50:23] what he is every temptation everything
[1:50:28] that could be thrown to you then you got
[1:50:31] it
[1:50:31] but what have you got greater is He that
[1:50:34] is in you than he that's in the world
[1:50:37] now notice he says you wasn't in a
[1:50:40] battle here you was just slopping along
[1:50:44] but now you've cleaned up you've dressed
[1:50:47] up you shaved you clothes your hair you
[1:50:49] put on a uniform you got a gun in your
[1:50:51] hand let's go you're in a battle not to
[1:50:53] show off but to fight fight sure when
[1:50:57] the temptations rise winter with the
[1:50:59] spirit the shield of faith buck it off
[1:51:01] and move on notice have simple buck it
[1:51:07] off and move on
[1:51:11] don't try to out quote the devil Jesus
[1:51:15] never tried out quote the devil because
[1:51:18] I'll tell you right now you and I try to
[1:51:19] out quote him he ain't come out for you
[1:51:22] and all you say it's just the scripture
[1:51:28] oh no he knows how to put the message
[1:51:29] quotes together too he knows how to put
[1:51:32] scriptures and quotes together and come
[1:51:35] at you well well well
[1:51:38] he said below you put on that whole
[1:51:41] armor of God why do you put on an armor
[1:51:43] if you're not gonna fight
[1:51:44] that's a good question in it all
[1:51:48] soldiers are dressed to fight not to
[1:51:52] show off walk out and say I'm so-and-so
[1:51:54] I'm a Christian see Who I am
[1:51:56] I'm belong to so-and-so hallelujah I got
[1:51:58] the Holy Ghost here they're not sure
[1:52:00] nothing bothers me anymore he said
[1:52:02] brother I believe you better go back and
[1:52:04] try again I'm telling you when as soon
[1:52:11] as you
[1:52:12] hey you got the Holy Ghost Satan's got
[1:52:15] every gun right on you shooting you but
[1:52:19] then you got the whole armour of God
[1:52:21] take the shield of faith the sword of
[1:52:22] the Spirit take the buckle shod yourself
[1:52:24] with the gospel take the old middle
[1:52:26] piece here the breastplate and pull up
[1:52:28] the shin the cinch on it pat yourself up
[1:52:30] a little bit and get ready cuz it's
[1:52:32] coming don't you worry
[1:52:33] you're gonna have plenty of trouble but
[1:52:34] once again he says it but remember
[1:52:37] greater is He that's in you than he
[1:52:41] that's in the world now notice the
[1:52:46] scripture let me just try to bring this
[1:52:47] down here to one part of it this morning
[1:52:50] the scripture tells us in the book of
[1:52:52] Hebrews chapter 11 verse 1 now faith is
[1:52:57] the substance of things hoped for the
[1:53:01] evidence of things not seen for by it
[1:53:05] the elders obtained a good report now
[1:53:11] the good report wasn't that they never
[1:53:14] got down the good report wasn't that
[1:53:17] they didn't have any fiery darts shot at
[1:53:19] that's not the good report the good
[1:53:21] report was is how the faith itself in
[1:53:24] their lives equip them with overcoming
[1:53:26] power they were at the end of the
[1:53:31] chapter at the end of Hebrews 11
[1:53:33] God's Hall of Fame they subdued kingdoms
[1:53:37] there's some statements that are within
[1:53:39] there there are certain phrases in there
[1:53:41] that if you or I had the choice it'd be
[1:53:43] just like in our own lives we would take
[1:53:45] all the subdued kingdoms we would take
[1:53:47] the part man they stopped the mouths of
[1:53:49] lions about remember they were in the
[1:53:52] lion's den I'm all about it they were
[1:53:58] there and Daniel could feel their hot
[1:54:00] breath on him God could have slayed
[1:54:05] every one of them lions but he didn't he
[1:54:08] just came down and had fellowship with
[1:54:10] Daniel in the lion's den come on now
[1:54:14] everybody knows that animals are afraid
[1:54:17] of fire let me tell you something he who
[1:54:22] wants to portray himself as a roaring
[1:54:25] lion he
[1:54:26] the fire to come on somebody I'm talking
[1:54:31] about the devil he who roars and roams
[1:54:33] about seeking whom he may devour
[1:54:39] but this plant within the scripture
[1:54:41] these brothers and sisters they felt the
[1:54:45] fiery darts but the shield of faith that
[1:54:48] they were given it was a present tense
[1:54:51] faith it was that faith that was
[1:54:55] delivered to them and their faith would
[1:54:57] date the shield of faith and hold it in
[1:55:00] that hour of temptation let me close
[1:55:08] with this
[1:55:13] but the Bannerman's praying here he said
[1:55:17] lord maybe there's some here that's sick
[1:55:20] and weak and needy Lord they're
[1:55:25] Christians Satan has shot his arrows
[1:55:29] they've connected to and he went over
[1:55:33] the top of their shield of faith and
[1:55:35] anchored but thou art the great doctor
[1:55:39] come Lord Jesus and remove the dark pour
[1:55:43] in the soothing healing oil and bandage
[1:55:47] it up by the word and may they go out of
[1:55:50] here tonight well granite Lord thou art
[1:55:52] al-sharia the breast had won the breasts
[1:55:54] of God the life giver the nurturer the
[1:55:57] sustainer of life and the all sufficient
[1:55:59] one he said there may be those who have
[1:56:06] grown weary in the way this is another
[1:56:11] quote you know when they would fight
[1:56:16] them when they would fire these fiery
[1:56:17] darts after at the beginning of that
[1:56:20] campaign when you studied when this
[1:56:25] these opposing forces would come at one
[1:56:27] another the enemy would take fiery darts
[1:56:31] it was just one fiery dart they would
[1:56:33] fire here's the wording a barrage of
[1:56:37] Pyrrha darts and it was so dead in such
[1:56:40] a way to where it wasn't just you're
[1:56:43] looking and saying oh yeah well there
[1:56:44] was a fire here you see a fire and our
[1:56:46] lunch over there anybody could see it
[1:56:48] coming head-on at yet but they were
[1:56:50] fiery darts coming from this way fiery
[1:56:52] darts coming this way fiery darts coming
[1:56:55] this way tests and trials coming this
[1:56:57] way sickness coming this way temptation
[1:56:59] coming this way pain coming this way and
[1:57:02] seemed like all around you know why they
[1:57:04] did that
[1:57:05] what's to induce panic why does the
[1:57:10] enemy fire you say brother Samuel
[1:57:12] it seems like I'm battling with sickness
[1:57:15] or I've been battling with this why it's
[1:57:18] a barrage of fiery darts what's it
[1:57:24] what's the whole tactic is to get us to
[1:57:26] us we throw down a ship what's it's on
[1:57:29] fire you've got the shield of faith not
[1:57:33] that he would not not that fire itself
[1:57:35] wouldn't try to start but a shield of
[1:57:37] faith will put it sickness can burn then
[1:57:44] your body temptation can burn down into
[1:57:47] your spirit the fairy is a shield of
[1:57:50] faith that is able to quench the fiery
[1:57:54] darts I don't know about you but
[1:58:01] sometimes when those darts go to fly
[1:58:07] let's Emmie how often they fly just like
[1:58:13] they fly on you sometimes those darts
[1:58:17] get the flying all around and the first
[1:58:19] thing you know tested trials coming this
[1:58:21] way situations here how you gonna handle
[1:58:23] this how you gonna deal with this well
[1:58:25] now how are you gonna dress this it's
[1:58:27] things all over all around that's going
[1:58:29] on now what I can do which sometimes I
[1:58:33] do
[1:58:34] and you do probably do not know what
[1:58:38] about doing have I done someone in mind
[1:58:40] I'm out of your will and the enemies
[1:58:43] like he's paying attention to the fiery
[1:58:44] darts they're getting it's inducing
[1:58:47] panic you see the vibration coming off
[1:58:50] of him right now he's not praying in
[1:58:52] peace he's anxious somebody help me
[1:58:55] preach him out
[1:58:56] what's happenin devil said look he's
[1:58:58] questioning he's questioning he's lookin
[1:59:01] Lord am i pleasing to You Lord Am I
[1:59:03] there you know what did I do some wrong
[1:59:04] why is this coming around a barrage of
[1:59:09] fiery darts sometimes as soldiers we get
[1:59:18] weary
[1:59:21] now be honest with you and I don't take
[1:59:24] anything away from a young Christian but
[1:59:26] when I was a young Christian I never
[1:59:28] understood that as a matter of fact my
[1:59:31] dad was preaching one time at the other
[1:59:33] church we were renting and he was
[1:59:35] talking about how beginning me would
[1:59:36] come in him I was sitting on the front
[1:59:37] row many of you would that were part in
[1:59:39] that today over there gathering at a
[1:59:40] church and I just it just came out how
[1:59:43] loud I said you got to be kidding me
[1:59:48] you know why I said that because I had
[1:59:51] not been in that part of the battle yet
[1:59:54] but here was a battle-scarred veteran
[1:59:58] that was standin victorious that new one
[2:00:01] it was locked when he was get up in the
[2:00:02] morning and the devil say God don't love
[2:00:05] you look at you sick again look at you
[2:00:09] gotta take these pills
[2:00:10] look at you he don't even care about you
[2:00:13] he'll heal others you've laid your hands
[2:00:15] on others and look at you you still walk
[2:00:17] in these conditions preach with me now
[2:00:21] you say what does that have to got to do
[2:00:26] with the shield of faith faith worketh
[2:00:29] by love love produces faith
[2:00:37] [Applause]
[2:00:40] just so you know I don't care what you
[2:00:42] already know I don't care how long
[2:00:44] you've been serving the Lord you don't
[2:00:46] get a golden Buckeye card that you can
[2:00:47] hand in and say this is break day devil
[2:00:54] see how long I've been in a message 35
[2:00:58] years break day every Friday's break day
[2:01:00] for me you know that every Friday in
[2:01:03] your nose sound like an wearing my sweat
[2:01:06] shirts on Friday this is day off devil
[2:01:10] do D day off devil or when you get to a
[2:01:18] certain place in your walk with God and
[2:01:20] how the enemy look want to come around
[2:01:21] and tell you you ain't got no experience
[2:01:23] with God you ain't got no power with God
[2:01:25] you said brother sender would he do that
[2:01:27] he came right in the prophet's bedroom
[2:01:30] and said you don't have one bit of power
[2:01:33] with God but the Rebbe said he was like
[2:01:36] the old Ali you found the cartoon
[2:01:38] characters cackling in the corner come
[2:01:46] on now with all that being said tighten
[2:01:49] it right up and realize you're not as
[2:01:53] odd as you thought you were that's only
[2:01:56] a devil's tactic to try to single you
[2:01:58] out and make you feel like nobody else
[2:02:02] goes through this you must be an oddball
[2:02:04] he's a liar he is one who's come time
[2:02:07] and time again he is a liar
[2:02:10] don't let your shield of faith down take
[2:02:13] that shield of faith
[2:02:17] I'm gonna renew my strength in the Lord
[2:02:23] haha he does care about me he does love
[2:02:28] many he sends me his word he encourages
[2:02:32] me I'm gonna use every gift at my
[2:02:35] disposal what are you saying pick up
[2:02:38] your shield soldier that shield will put
[2:02:41] out that poverty I just love you what I
[2:03:10] love you I love the Lord let me read
[2:03:26] this as you stand
[2:03:35] there may be those here Lord who've
[2:03:38] grown weary in the way weary where you
[2:03:49] mean a real soldier of God can grow
[2:03:51] weary yeah but there's one part of you
[2:03:56] there is no weary when you've been born
[2:04:01] of the Spirit of God you can have joy in
[2:04:05] the midst of your trial now that don't
[2:04:07] mean that you're you know dancing and
[2:04:09] shouting and your rejoicing is in that
[2:04:11] way but your rejoicing is Lord you're my
[2:04:16] deliverer you're making a way through
[2:04:21] this
[2:04:22] you know what's happening sister Rita
[2:04:25] you know what happens when you say it
[2:04:26] like that it's taking that shield of
[2:04:27] faith and those fiery darts for the joy
[2:04:30] it's been fired and Men that blaze
[2:04:31] coming behind it and comes upon you and
[2:04:35] that flammable liquid bricks all over
[2:04:37] you gets in your mind you get to
[2:04:38] thinking it gets in your feelings in
[2:04:40] your spirit but the shield of faith says
[2:04:43] I've never seen the righteous forsaken
[2:04:47] God knows just how to give you the word
[2:04:50] that you have need of in that hour he is
[2:04:54] my shield I will say of the Lord he said
[2:05:03] let them know Lord I love this I know it
[2:05:06] simple let them know Lord that we never
[2:05:09] come to a picnic went through a
[2:05:12] battleground
[2:05:15] that statement may not I hope it means
[2:05:17] something to you but it might seem like
[2:05:21] you and look at say well yeah we're in a
[2:05:22] battleground I know I'm not the picnic
[2:05:24] no know what that was meant let them
[2:05:26] know Lord that the battle they're not
[2:05:31] odd they're not strange they're not
[2:05:32] different they're in a battle let them
[2:05:35] know the fighting bet they're in right
[2:05:36] now how did the wearisome you know the
[2:05:39] Bible says be you're not weary in
[2:05:41] well-doing all right placing six
[2:05:45] sometimes we get weary we get weary and
[2:05:48] warring things off a soldier gets weary
[2:05:51] gets tired that's why we have to have
[2:05:57] refreshment we've got to come back to
[2:06:01] the house of God we've got to get our
[2:06:04] shields anointed with oil we've got to
[2:06:09] take that shield off we can put it right
[2:06:11] there in the water that fountain that's
[2:06:14] open in the house of David and let it
[2:06:17] soak up and become saturated in his
[2:06:21] presence Lord let him know we never come
[2:06:26] to a picnic but to a battle ground
[2:06:27] fights every inch of the way give them
[2:06:31] courage strengthen them there's some
[2:06:35] here Lord that's been wounded the enemy
[2:06:38] has shot darts of sickness into their
[2:06:41] body and afflictions their warriors
[2:06:44] laying here on the battlefield that
[2:06:47] would be up and going if they could but
[2:06:50] they must be taken to the inn where the
[2:06:53] caretaker is at father may the ambulance
[2:06:57] of God carry them to a real genuine
[2:07:00] faith this afternoon that they will be
[2:07:03] healed
[2:07:05] [Music]
[2:07:09] he's a doctor he's the chief physician
[2:07:13] and he don't have to refer you over to a
[2:07:17] specialist it just so happens he is the
[2:07:21] specialist you're wary you're wounded
[2:07:28] maybe this we stop right here where he
[2:07:30] may be in your mind weary in your spirit
[2:07:32] may be wounded maybe a dart has hit
[2:07:36] there in one of the flammable parts of
[2:07:39] your life in your body and then the
[2:07:41] enemy will want to work upon that dart
[2:07:43] that contact and with that flammable
[2:07:46] liquid well God's feelings others with
[2:07:49] that you say what the problem of speed
[2:07:51] your faith must not be great at all
[2:07:53] there must be some in your life that's
[2:07:56] wrong come on somebody where the devil
[2:07:59] would want to work with that flammable
[2:08:00] liquid Stratos with the sickness but as
[2:08:04] a child of God you've got a right to
[2:08:06] stand there to know that God will not
[2:08:08] hold anything from you if it's something
[2:08:11] even that's not right in your life you
[2:08:13] can be as simple as this right now and
[2:08:15] say Lord forgive me and cleanse me right
[2:08:18] now and you know what that does that
[2:08:20] invites the ambulance of the Holy Spirit
[2:08:22] to move you off the battlefield and into
