that she refuses to leave the house even for tests scans or doctor's appointments our friend may be so bound that she refus refuses to leave the house but I know that my doctor Jesus makes house calls I know that what he has done for me he can do he can and will do for our friend because she's in a dark place and unable to believe for herself please join your faith with mine in order to bring the Lord God Almighty on the scene for he is the God of All Flesh and there is nothing too difficult for him amen how many believe that this morning uplifted hand and any unspoken prayer requests let's just all go together with our [Music] brother with that last prayer request just remind me that my uh something the Lord just dealt with me with just earlier this week um just kind of in prayer about some things you know and I was just asking the Lord why you know not um out of bitterness but just out of seeking understanding you know just we we all have that you know why why uh certain things happened and even um from childhood and on up uh and uh the Lord just kind of gave me a song you know um and it I I can't remember the song real well but it it says we'll talk it over in the buy and by we'll talk it over my Lord and I I'll ask the reason he'll tell me why we'll talk it over in the buy and by and just I'm so looking forward to that day just him and I just I can just imagine just a stroll together and and I can just ask him uh all the questions and then he just kept dealing with me a little bit about it and uh reminded me of Jesus on the cross said what's the the next the last thing he said he said my God my God why has Thou forsaken me and he just said I went to the cross with the question why on my heart and the scripture never tells us whether that question was ever answered on this side or not you know so sometimes we know why even sometimes beforehand sometimes afterwards we say oh that's why this happened and sometimes it might be that that that strug with Jesus before we actually know the reason why but he just said just don't feel guilty about asking why because that's that's a question that he he he knows deeply and and intimately so just oh that last prayer request just hit my heart and I just wanted to share that with with everybody we may not know why but don't ever let you know the devil bring fear and condemnation on you because you're asking he he knows and he understands that question very much so let's just go before him in prayer and just hold these needs on your heart and this before the Lord dear Lord Jesus we come before you in prayer Lord and it's just it's such an honor Lord to be able to approach you Lord but also to be able to bind Lord our face together Lord with each other's face just like brother Rocko had said just bind our face together for one that that Lord may be destitute and in a dark place right now Lord but that's why you came to shed the light is to drive away the darkness Lord and and allow us

to Genesis 21 Genesis 21 amen sure love to see you all amen and uh and we bring greetings from uh TR word as well brother Wayne and Ray bring bring their love with me and so forth and we just appreciate and love you all in the Lord God surely is good ain't he amen God surely is good and we're just so thankful Amen to be to be able to speak the words of life amen for What Little God's given me we can be able to share it amen and I say the same thing for you as well amen whatever God has given to you make sure you're sharing it that's right gift ain't for yourself a gift is for other people right right I mean listen I already know I can preach all right I can talk in a mirror amen but what used to be if there was nobody to give it to that's the same thing with you you're just as important you're just as important there's no part of the body of Christ that's weak there really is it amen you say oh you know you know I could probably make it without the fingernail on my pinky finger I could probably make it and still live but if somebody ripped it off boy I would not like that I would I really like my fingernail there I really like it if somebody would take it away I get upset about it oh what are you doing that's my fingernail that's the same thing with you you're oh you're insignificant you ain't that insignificant you're part of the body of Christ amen every part of Christ is important amen I just feel like praising the Lord amen Genesis 21 Genesis 21 and we're going to read 1-7 Genesis 21 and verse1 and the Lord visited Sarah as he had said the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken for Sarah conceived and bear Abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which God had spoken to him and Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom Sarah be to him Isaac and Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being the eighth eight days old as God had commanded him and Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born unto him and Sarah said God hath made me to laugh so that all that hear will laugh with me and she said who would have said unto Abraham that Sarah should have given child suck for I have borne him a son in his old age can we bow our heads for to prayer most gracious kind Heavenly Father Lord we thank you Lord for your grace and your mercy this morning Lord we thank you Lord God for your presence here Lord the children of God whom you have saved out of all Nations and tongues Lord have gathered together and according to to your word Lord they've gathered together to hear the preaching of your word amen so they're not tossed to and fro but they will be built up into the statue of a perfect man Lord God the the world may call this foolish but to them that believe this is the power of God and the wisdom of God so we're asking you Lord according to your word may you just continue to anoint this service Lord and speak only that which you you want to speak to each hearer Lord God if we got got to get off my notes and change the entire service Lord let us all be open to the moving of the Holy Spirit we're trusting that and believing Lord we want to commit this service into your hands for it is in your name the name of your son the Lord Jesus Christ we pray the church said together amen God bless you you may be seated you love the Lord God surely is good amen boy we're already taking the coat off amen must be warm in the Holy Ghost amen amen you love the Lord I want to preach a message called God hath made me to laugh God hath made me to laugh as we read in verse six there this is the promise that they've been waiting for for 25 years brother R would talk about about this promised son and now the promised son has shown up and this is the first thing that comes out of Sarah's mouth when she gave a child in her old age as as well was that God hath made me to laugh and then it says and and all that hear will laugh with me now see this is interesting what are they laughing about it's important to understand the point in which why is she laughing as a matter of fact Isaac's name means [Laughter] laughter so what so why is Sarah laughing well did God say a good joke you know was there something humorous that happened see it's important to understand why she's laughing here now before we get into it a little bit I want to express a principle that brother Ram taught us about this story so that we can take the story and relate it to ourselves okay about what this promised son meant amen I mean it's good that God gave a promised son to Abraham and Sarah but you could sit there and go okay that's great and I believe God can do that amen is it just a good testimony in the Bible no God actually did it for very specific reason to even teach us about a thing in our day so brother said in that first quote and Abraham and his seat after him brother Abraham says this he says and look what did he do he had to change Abraham and Sarah's body I'm going to tell you something I I thank God for the message of the hour people thought it was a literally 100y old man and a 90y old woman give him birth but then when brother breaks it down for a little bit and you go well and he goes God had to change their body you you almost look at and go yeah of course of course God had to have done that amen amen we would not have got that with prophetic guiding without prophetic eyesight amen listen there's theologians out there all the denominations they can't see this they thought it was a 90 year- old woman giv birth and they can't make understanding of it but when the prophet was able to look through the word and notice their body had to be changed it lined up with the rest of the word cuz what's going to happen to us eventually our bodies are going to be changed as well you see the pro this is not going see there's more to this story that God's trying to express to us than just oh that's a neat thing in the Bible you know an old couple having a kid amen watch he had to change Abraham and Sarah's body what's the next thing after the sign was shown that he know the secret of the heart the next thing was the change of the body in order to receive the promised son and that's what's next in line now is the rapture of the church the changing see he's typing the promised son to the Rapture that we're going to experience before we meet the promised son in the air our bodies have to be changed as well see there's more to that promised son than just a neat testimony God's trying to show us something that what Abraham and Sarah experien is the same thing we're going to experience ain't that's something oh my praise the Lord we're get into it don't worry listen we got to start in first gear first then you go into second year then third year okay that paragraph next paragraph in paragraph 225 and look what if he just turned them back to a young man and a woman like they were at the first time they couldn't have that baby anyhow because they lived together when there was a young man and a woman you see if he would have just reverted them back they still couldn't have a kid well because they didn't have the kid before so so what did he have to do he said he had to change their body in a different way in order to receive the sun their body had to be changed in another way to receive the sun I'm going tell you something you're not just going to revert it back to what you look like 18 years if God just reverted you back to 18 years old you just keep growing again and eventually you would die of old age again he's not just going to revert you back to an older sin sinful condition he's changing something else about you what's he doing he's taking sin out even out of your bodies [Applause] amen amen listen think about it for a second why don't we live forever right now I mean think about it for a second when you go eat an apple right it puts energy in your body well if it puts energy in your body your body should be able to keep going but those apples don't do the same thing they did 20 years ago do they amen you're still for some reason even though you're putting the same energy in your body and the same amount so forth some of us a little more than others that's that's my problem amen but what I'm saying is is you're doing the same thing when you were a young kid and you were growing them but for some reason now when you do it you're eventually now dying and you're getting older and grayer what happened what's the difference it is a not a natural reason there's sin you were constructed in sin and sin has to die so he can't just revert you back to an old thing he has to change your literal body and burn all the sin out in order for you to receive the promised son Abraham and Sarah not only did God had him break them younger again he had to heal their bodies and change them from the what they were before in order to receive the promised son you see this story is applying to us a lot more than we realize amen when it just like us our bodies have to be changed in a different way so that when we meet the we can go and meet the sun in the air then we can't meet the sun like this we can't meet the Suns like this but he's going to change your body in a different way so you could read seeed the son now watch this so we see Abraham and Sarah were in the same situation we are and when Sarah finally received the promised son what did she say God hath made me to laugh so what's she laughing about what's she laughing about what's causing her to laugh and I think that's a good question and so I think we're going to follow Sarah a little bit here I hope you want to come with me amen because when we look at the story of Abraham and Sarah we do focus a lot on Abraham and that's good and we love the Lord but I think sometimes we forget about Sarah's walking in these same steps as well amen matter of fact God technically and I the the Bible doesn't necessarily declare this but as far as the Bible is concerned there's only one time God ever speaks to Sarah so when she's hearing about this promised son coming and she's hearing about these promises she's hearing it from Abraham amen and yet she still believed you remember this Sarah believed with Abraham as well here let's go to the first scripture I want to read some of these scriptures with you if you don't mind in 1 Peter 21 to I'm sorry it's first Peter 3 1-6 likewise you wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be won by the conversation of the wives you're that strong wives sometimes wives think they're they're insignificant do you know you can save unbelieving people just said it right there amen some see sometime oh well oh I didn't I I was trying to avoid the whole wives and husband thing but now we can't because the world makes an impression on when a wife obeys her husband that it's a prison now that that it's going to hurt her and make her less of a person yet When God says the wife obeys the husband God says that wife can save her husband by simply doing what God called her to do Hallelujah see you remember something we don't care what the world has to say about it glory to God we don't care their opinion about it we don't even care about our own opinion the Bible says let every man's word be Al liive and my word be true and yet now we're finding out there's plenty of women out there and they've done studies women are more depressed than ever I wonder why cuz they're going contrary to the word it's not a prison it's salvation not only to you but to your family as well amen hallelujah your wives are a lot more important than you think sometimes what did Brother Bram call you called you the Fifth Gospel Matthew Mark Luke John mothers you're a lot more important than and you realize you just got to do it the way God called us to do it here let's keep reading while they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning a plating of the hair and a wearing of gold or a putting on of a Peril but let it be the hidden man of the heart thought we're talking about a woman here and yet there's a hidden man in you still who is that that's Christ amen glory it's Christ Christ in you and this is how you're expressing Christ to the world remember a real woman of God preaches a thousand times more than even me amen they're way better at it than me too they just have to walk in the store they don't have to say a single word but a real woman can walk into a store and preach to every single person in that store they don't even have to open their mouth I got to at least say something you know what I mean in I got to say hi by the way I'm a Christian do you got Jesus I got to wear a shirt that says who fool are you right I got to wear shirts that talk and things like that a real woman of God can speak more words than I can uh uh testimony me and car used to work at a solder warw workking plant and she would go in their skirt and things like that I did multiple Bible studies for people because they thought she was Amish they would come up to her and say are you Amish or something no I just believe God if you want no more ask my husband and I had multiple Bible studies with people because she was preaching more than me you see what I'm saying see the world says this kind of preacher puts women in prisons but the word says amen it's freedom and salvation to not only you but to your family to those that see you as well amen I say we change the script amen change the script forget what the world says about it they just want them die in their own lust and so forth like that that's stuff is nothing but death out there don't you dare let that like he said like let the ornament be of of the Hidden man of the heart let it not be on the outward appearance amen it's just a lie of the devil amen you already look pretty as it is just ask your husband amen listen I'm well I'm going to be real with you hopefully this doesn't sound too much of a joke but it is kind of funny okay if every woman in the world stopped wearing makeup tomorrow men would still be talking to women right y makeup is not for men and I know people think like that and the only men they're worth they're not even men they're dogs if if a man wants a woman to look like that and things like that he ain't no man he might be a beast as brother br called him but he's not a real man and you don't want that kind of stuff anyways amen you need to present yourself in what you want to attract yep amen amen if you're not in business don't advertise you know what I mean like like that's what that world offers that's what it's doing to them and yet they think it's for looking prety and stuff like that you don't look any pretty remember it's not how the world thinks of it this says this amen amen but let it be the hidden man in the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price maybe not in the sight of the world but in the sight of God that's a real queen that's a real princess we don't need no Disney Princesses amen remember we're going to read a little bit but Sarah means princess amen oo that's pretty good amen the world offer us all these other princesses with earrings and gold and things but God's going to show us a real princess right here first Peter 3 cool glory to God and hallelujah amen yeah Disney ain't got nothing on the word amen amen that was free okay amen I really like that actually I was in the back office howan princess into this just found it amen hallelujah verse five for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God adored themselves be in subjection to their own husbands verse six even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters ye are as long as you do well and not afraid with amazement or with fear that's what that word means so see what did we just describe there is how Sarah acted with Abraham she wasn't dressing up and trying to look pretty for everybody else she believed her own husband she believed her husband so much when they when he backslid and called Sarah his sister she didn't open her mouth whoa heyo you ever think about that story you ever think about that remember CU Abraham's going to do it twice now Abraham's goingon to do it twice and you ever wonder about that brother Bill she's like what are you talking about Abraham I'm not just your sister I'm also your wife and yet you're selling me to another guy right now she didn't open her mouth once you see how Paul is able to say this in the word how Sarah obeyed her husband in the Lord even calling him Lord amen she believed D what Abraham said amen she believed of a promised son she believed this amen remember we're talking about how she's going to start laughing here amen ver uh Hebrews 11:1 through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful Lord who had promised Lord remember Sarah believed the word amen she believed what Abraham said she believed something was going to happen amen now we're going to go to Genesis 16 here because remember she knows what that this is the word she knows she's going to have a son amen but sometimes those promises can be kind of hard to believe especially in certain circumstances and so forth amen so remember this Sarah believes what God told Abraham so we go to Genesis 16 verse1 now this is before she even got her name changed as well now Sarah Abraham's wife bear him no children and she had a handmade an Egyptian whose name was Hagar now remember she has the word she believes it she believes what her husband said she obeys her husband she doesn't Adorn herself she's holy and chased amen coupled with fear as we just read amen and so she's looking at the word and she's like I can't have children though but there's a law in the land that allows a wife to offer her handmade and then she could receive children through her that so she's trying to understand the promise and she comes up with a way to fulfill it amen she comes up with a way to there's a law in the land I hope you're hearing me now there's a certain thing that you're allowed to do that goes oh maybe that's what God meant amen maybe that's what God meant so we can do it like this verse two and Sarah said unto Abram behold now the handmade the Lord hath restrained me from bearing I pray thee go into my maid and maybe that I may obtain children by her why is she doing this she's doing it because she believes but yet she's trying to understand and fulfill it you ever been there you ever been there amen when you're trying to understand and believe something and you're going yeah okay I believe it but then your mind starts traveling a little bit and and then you go but how could it possibly happen how could the Rapture happen listen I I really get straight here don't I I almost get scared of myself amen but I actually believe that's why some people who have mistaken us being in the Millennium that's why they're doing this they're trying to understand certain quotes of the way brother B would say things and so then they're going well then maybe it's already fulfilled maybe it's like this or like that amen that's why they get caught up in those things is because they're trying to interpret it but brother B said God don't need any help interpreting his word God don't need no help he can do it himself he's big enough to interpret his own word hallelujah but you see so you see remember we're typing Sarah with us now you see how she can get caught up she believes she's a good wife amen she called Abraham her Lord things like that and she's trying to figure out the word right so verse three oh and Abraham hearkened to the voice of Sarah verse three and Sarah Abraham's wife took Hagar who made the Egyptian after Abraham D 12 years in land Canon and gave her to husband Abram to be his wife and when he went in onto Hagar and she conceived and and when she saw that she had conceived she had a jubilee cuz the word's fulfilled that's what she was trying to do she was trying to fulfill the word but then when the child showed up her mistress was despised in her eyes well what's going on remember she had the hidden man in the heart the word knew that wasn't the word right there glory to God this is how every denomination starts in case you're wondering this is do denominationalism 101 right up here amen they think they're coming up with a good plan they think yes this is a great program this is how it's going to work and then we come to find out it was death true that even Sarah looked at it and said nope that's not it we're gonna skip just to save some time but we find out that she even kind of blames Abraham for it you know what let's read it let's read it you didn't believe me there for a second so let's read it here real quick it's in verse five and Sarah said unto Abram my wrong be upon thee whoa I have given my mate into thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived I Des I was despise In Her Eyes the Lord should judge between me and thee it wasn't the word it wasn't the word she was standing there and this was her big plan and had to come to find out it wasn't it matter of fact we know who she had it was ishmail and we go down to First vers to Genesis 16:12 the Bible says about ishmail and he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his Brethren do you know that this problem of Ishmael still exists today did you know that this problem of ishmail Amen matter of fact we'll read it a little bit later in Galatians 4 ishmael's type is the natural seed and Isaac's types is the spiritual seed and Paul says that as the natural persecuted the spiritual so it is today this natural seed which persecutes the spiritual seed started right here and guess what it still ain't over it still happens to Israel today it literally started a couple months ago again didn't it you look at the thorn in Israel's side and who was it it's still ishmail you want to talk about vindication of the word you can't make that up you know what I mean you can't just sit here and you know people like to accuse the Bibles written by man and things like that and and it's like man how do you write a better thing than that then he said he's going to be a wild man and his hand will be against everybody natural persecutes the spiritual and we come to find out it's still happening today you can turn on Fox News and find out you can turn on CNN and they're quoting the word see everything this has to be fulfilled there's nothing in this which won't be fulfilled it has to be fulfilled even the world don't even see it sometimes remember even uh the high priest even says shall one man die to save the whole country he didn't realize he was prophesying the whole time do you even know and we come to find out yeah it took one man to die to save the whole world Amen Hallelujah you see they don't even know what they're doing and yet they don't realize when they putting that stuff on the uh uh uh on the news and things like that they're just proving God was right the whole time and you come to wonder why Jewish people are starting to get more hated and hated in this day than ever before why it's the word being fulfilled every nation's going to be against them so the Bible says amen see it's just happening right before our eyes and look where it started it started when somebody tried to figure out the promise when somebody was trying to figure out the promise of God that's when it started all the problems I hope you're hearing me what's going to what happens with our problem sometimes it's because a lot of times it's because we try to figure it out it may not just be a prise you're just trying to figure out different aspects of your life and and you sit there and you contemplate and you go well if I did this and that means I'd be a better Christian right you ever do that mind battle with yourself sometimes when you make a mistake and you go well the reason why I made that mistake is because I did this and this so then therefore if I take that part out I won't make the mistake again you take that part out and what happened you made the mistake again anyways you know why that happens to you sometimes I'll tell you why cuz God allowed it yeah you know why God allowed it to prove to you that you're figuring out don't work you can have the best will lay PLS and they all Fall to Pieces amen but let God show up one time and he'll settle it all [Applause] amen I got so many testimonies of that amen when I would sit there and read a certain scripture and I'd sit there and go what does this scripture mean and I would struggle and struggle and think and think and study and study and read and read I remember one time I was studying about Phineas and I don't mean to go on this thing I'm just trying to prove a point here I won't get in the point maybe I'll bring it later maybe that maybe they'll have Sam you invite me again who knows put a little plug in you know I'm I'm G to get in trouble in here one of these days God one day I was really struggling about the story of Phineas it made no sense to me I didn't understand understand it him stabbing that girl and so forth like that just none of it made sense to me amen and and and and I got to pray about it thinking about it I found out his his name means mouth of brass or mouth of serpent that's what it meant and I was okay that's great who cares you know it didn't make any sense to me and I kept praying and praying I studied I read I looked at all things and then I finally realized and said you know what I don't think I prayed one minute about this [Laughter] so I got down on my knees and I said God I do not understand what this story means I don't understand what's going on here what's going on with fans I don't get it why did he stab that girl and so forth that why was why did it make him become a priest after an Everlasting Covenant and then all God spoke to me and he said the mouth of the brass Serpent and I went what huh and all a sudden I said maybe I should read about the brass serpent come to find out it's eight chapters before Phineas showed up and so God brought the brass serpent as a sacrifice but then when it came to cleanse Israel again of sin you didn't need another brass serpent the brass serpent now had a mouth and his believer named Phineas and so there was no more sticking up more brass serpents now the brass serpent had a Voice Hallelujah and Jesus Christ died on the cross amen but we don't need another Jesus Christ to come again amen where is the word the Bible says the word is nigh even in thy mouth and you go amen and you can say yes that's the word did you know that took no figuring out on my part I sat there for hours trying to figure it out got on my knees and God did it five minutes more than I could do in a whole day amenl and if God does that just for those little questions you have of the word what makes you think anything part of your life's going to be any better am than just letting go and let God have his way the Bible says they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength listen I'm I'm going to tell you why you're getting hurried hurry hurried all the time it's because this is what the world pushes out here this is the this is their uh gospel if you will y amen sometimes people get accused of being lazy because they're not doing anything and it's like well you do know the Bible says you're supposed to wait so sometimes amen sometimes you ought to wait and listen yeah did you ever do a prayer I want I encourage you about something why don't you try this do a prayer one of these days where you don't talk and just listen you ever listen just sit there and listen amen and you go H yeah but if I start listening then I have all these things but then you start working those things out you separate from those things and just listen if then all sudden you'll hear hear a s Small Voice creep up in your heart you go oh that's just probably my thought no it ain't amen you got the Holy Ghost who got the Holy Ghost listen if you got the Holy Ghost I'd figure that out today if I was you yeah but if you got the Holy Ghost where is it so where else would The Voice come you got it right here I mean what what we just read it Sarah had the hidden man in the heart amen you have a hidden man right here and then you're expecting some Thunderbolts to come out here why would it this is the voice he's right here too glory to God hallelujah why don't you go pray and next time you pray just be quiet for a second and allow God to speak to you you remember when Elijah was going through his trial when he thought 7,000 uh he thought he was the only believer left in the church and he was struggling amen what happened there was a big earthquake but God wasn't in the earthquake there was a big fire god was in the fire there was a big wind but God wasn't there but a still Small Voice showed up [Applause] Hallelujah and what did that voice say there's 7,000 that haven't bowed the knee to bail amen he wasn't the only one Hallelujah and God was able to deliver encouragement to his Prophet because he stopped listening to all the Ruckus on the outside and listen to the still Small [Music] Voice you remember that remember how Joseph even came about the testimony brother Braham with Joseph how you found out he was going to have a son he was in prayer one time and he said it wasn't a voice if anybody heard the voice of God it was brother BR and he he said this time it wasn't like that he said he had a voice in his heart speak that say you're going to have a son and his name is Joseph and then yet Bea goes to have a child and a girl remember they joked around about him oh is it Josephine see that would have been the human brain trying to figure it out but he said nuh he said it's a son and he stayed on it m gets has another child the girl again uh brother B you sure that was right remember he was never a voice but it was a still SW voice in his heart but it was just as much the word that's what you read here remember if what's the word God spoke it God spoke it so it's the same thing as the word and the Word was speaking and said you're going to have a son the doctor even tried to get him to uh stop me from having kids say you can't have that woman have a child he said sorry can't do it God said I'm having a son and all of a sudden he asked a son he said Joseph it took your time to get here but he showed up amen that's a great testimony isn't it praise the Lord that that he was able to believe the word and hold on to it Hallelujah I said praise the lord we ought to act like that but where did that word come from a still Small Voice in his heart it came from the hidden man in the heart and he held on to that promise I'm going to tell you something I hope you're encouraged today the same thing can happen to you you can have a promise just like that given to you what are you going to do with it amen you say oh it's impossible yeah I bet Abraham and Sarah said the same thing matter of fact we're going to find out she struggled with that she did struggle with how impossible it is because we found out so she she caused Ismael to come about amen became a wild man all sudden Hagar and Sarah hate each other now they're despising each other and so forth Calla a Ruckus In the church o Preacher Brother Stephen why it's when people start trying to figure things out yeah when you start trying to figure out and put man's intelligence in it and man's thinking in it that's where you get in trouble but look at Sarah here now this does seem impossible and we're g to go to uh Genesis 18 verse 9 here I want to show you something here because this is the part of story remember the three men came was it no Trinity three men came but Abraham said my Lord no s showing what he knew there was God wasn't three people amen I love that I love sneaking that in a little bit amen give that to your trinitarian friend next time say well Abraham didn't believe it and he had three people walking up to him with just just made bodies right there right amen remember brother R taught us God just came out and bring up some dirt it wasn't like the same birth as Jesus who came through a woman came under the law but this body was just there was a body and then he stepped right into it and there was uh two bodies for the angels as well and when Abraham saw three people walking up he didn't come up with the Trinity Doctrine did he he said my Lord he saw there and there a no way there's three people there God's only one person there might be angels I may not be able to explain everything but I know there's one Lord One Faith one baptism amen yeah you take that put in your pocket next time you have a Baptist talk to you all right but watch this here because we know then that this is when Abraham is going to receive the promise matter of fact God's going to say according to the time of life I'm going to visit you and brother R said that's the natural cycle for a woman amen so that's when so it's going to be in about a space of a month he said here it's coming here's the promise it's coming Hallelujah didn't explain it to him he said according to the time of life I'm going to visit you amen Genesis 18 :9 they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said be be behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son remember before this they even thought it was ishmail because God comes after ishmael's mour God comes to Abraham and said you're going to have a seed you're going to have a seed and Abraham sits there I'm dramatized a little bit so give me some Liberty amen he he just he says he says Lord oh that Ishmael live before thee he said it's not ishmail it's not him amen it's coming through Sarah it's going to be your child and his name's Isaac Hallelujah I like that oh we think it's Ishmael they came up with all their Theology and all their doctrines and all their thinking they said yep here's the son his name is ishmail by the way God he said what you talking about that's that's not your son's seed's name right amen man God's plan was different than their plan who that happens to us sometimes too sometimes your plan ain't God's plan so what are you talking about you're see his name Ishmael it's Isaac you remember something about this story what's the difference between ishmail and Isaac in ishmael's birth there's not one Supernatural event that happens there's absolutely nothing Supernatural about ishmail but Isaac's going to have a whole bunch of it amen Isaac is going to have a supernatural birth not a church birth not just a church conversion amen just coming to church and just having a normal Church experience and thinking that's going to get you into heaven it ain't that's right and we believe in coming to church but just because you come to church and pay your tie don't mean you make it and you ought to do that just so you know you ought to be doing that stuff but that's there's no stuff nothing Supernatural that's just you doing what you're supposed to be doing but when you get really born again again of the spirit of God that's when the supernatural shows up amen something that you can't put on a plate and give it to somebody else you know that's what brother R said about perfect faith brother B said the difference about perfect faith and all the other senses is that you can't hand it to somebody else I can't sit here and take the experience that saved me that changed me that put me behind this Pulpit today I can't put it in a plate and hand it to you it won't do you any good amen but the supernatural God that showed up to me and gave me my experience and changed me the reason why I'm up here preaching this morning when God handed it to me that's what changed me and that's how we preach that Supernatural experience I'm not telling you that you got to fast for three days and then read the whole your Bible and don't forget the church the seven uh seals and then you can finally have the Holy Ghost that's not how it comes it's a supernatural God and you got to be able to yield yourself unto it and surrender your life to it amen that's how you'll find out what I'm talking about if you would have seen me 20 years ago you would have thought that guy never has a chance you would have been like Sarah there ain't no way he can have a child amen if you saw the muck that I was in and I tell young people this all the time amen I said I'm jealous of your chance I'm jealous of your chance of your opportunity because I know when I preach about the world I'm preaching from experience I've dealt with the world I've rubbed shoulders and shoulders with the world I've done the bars and the drinking and the drugs I've done it I've Seen It All I've seen crazy people I've seen it and I'm GNA tell you something it ain't worth anything it's not even worth your testimony amen amen listen I know it's a trick of the of the devil for some message people so let me just get this across again real quick okay listen to me you do not need to go into the world to get a testimony that's that's right amen you don't need it you don't need it you say brother Stephen though you were delivered from drugs and alcohol and cigarettes yes I was and I wish I never would have had it you know why you know why I it just shames me to even say this but I just got to tell the truth okay smoke you know how you get sometimes you go into a bad place and there's smokers you go terrible and you get all set I don't smoking doesn't bother me I'm used to it it's happened to me I've done it so I get around a bunch of smokers it doesn't affect me and I'll go home and I'll start condemning myself because I'm going Lord it should upset me more why doesn't it upset me and yet it doesn't upset me I want to cough like you all cough but I can't because I'm I plagued my body with that stuff there's a reason why God prevented brother Brandon from even experiencing smoking and drinking there's more reasons in this whether you would have believed it or not it helped Brother Brad because he had such a calling it would have affected his mind and his body too I know it did it to me amen and that and and it was God's mercy to brother Brandon because God knew what that man was going to have to go through even without the smoking and drinking he had double bind battles again oh the grace and mercy of God and can I tell you young people you got the same chance amen you do not need the world for a testimony your testimony is way better than mine mine just looks fancy but it's it's it's more of just because of circumstances and what God had to send me through amen my experience won't work for you right that's what I'm telling you run away from the world you don't need it amen the world will never be an advantage to you I'm really I'm really saying that seriously maybe it's a young and old now I think about it maybe some of your old people maybe experienced some of the things I did maybe gives you a little more understanding of your struggle sometimes and maybe then you'll be able to receive a little more grace in your life too cuz a lot of times s Satan likes to use your memory to bring up those bad things you did oh yeah and you go Bo you're a terrible person weren't you you'll probably just be terrible tomorrow no you won't you got God on your side hallu no you won't you got God on your side amen hallelujah but remember that colored woman gave that testimony I know I ain't what I ought to be amen I know I should be more whatever it is but I know one thing I ain't what I used to be see give yourself we're going to talk about in a little bit why don't you just be able to receive more grace in your life Lord instead of using your past sins to decide what happens to you now listen I'm going to tell you something man let's just be real okay you can't change what you did yesterday right what are you trying to change what you did yesterday you did it okay what are you going to do about it amen what are you going to do about it just wall in your Despair and just keep doing it why don't you put it on the blood and try better today am and let's say you fail today again doing it okay get it on the blood let's try again tomorrow right sometimes God's going to get you going through that sometimes just you realize why don't you quit trying just give it to God why don't you just quit trying and give it to God Amen give God those trials give God those problems amen just get on your knees and say God I can't do it I've tried and maybe you got to do it another hundred times before you do listen God knows how to do things better than us right you know you know look at the story and we're going to finish it don't worry Lord willing but you look at Abraham and Sarah here amen could God have healed Abraham and Sarah when Abraham was 75 and she was 65 when he first came to Abraham could he have healed their body then and they have the sun right now sure they could sure he could but God said that wasn't a big enough miracle I need this miracle to be even bigger so he waited 25 years years years Paul how old are you 23 23 he would be if he God came the same promise to you he'd be 48 by the time it's done just think about that for a second and he's gonna well he I was going to say he's gonna have gray hair but I know his daddy he might he might not have no hair Zach I know you'll keep your hair buddy hopefully Brother Sam doesn't get to this part of the sermon forgive me buddy where are the C forgive me buddy oh Lord forgive me I crack up too much sometimes but you see 25 years it's it's one thing when you just sit here and look in your Bible and you go and you waited 25 years uhhuh and then you keep reading go to the rest of the story you kind of have to put yourself in the story for a little bit uhuh think about waiting for 25 years believeing the same promise over and over and over again and all you're doing is get older and older and older there was a chance it could have happened now it looks like there's no chance at all so let's keep reading this here in Genesis 18 Genesis 18:10 and he said I will certainly return unto thee according morning to the time of life and though Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now now watch how the Bible says this because it explains the doubts she has watch in verse 11 now Abraham saying we're old and whale stricken in age yeah they were a 100y old man and a 90-year-old woman yeah now hey he's say he's saying Sarah heard this now remember case you forgot Abraham Sarah old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women menopause amen so she hasn't had anything she's an old lady and you think about it put yourself in Sarah's shoes for a second what would you have said some of you think you would have been like oh yeah bless God I'm still going to have it anyways look how tough of a Christian I am the Bible is somewhat justifying what Sarah's thinking it's saying yes in the natural in the world it makes no sense how can't she have a child so no wonder she's doubting no wonder this is hard to grasp watch this in verse 12 therefore Sarah laughed within herself she laughed this is a kind of different laugh than we're going to read about later though this is a different kind of laugh right here amen she's laughing going how can this be therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I wax old so I have pleasure my Lord old also listen yeah according to the Natural according to the world according to every single one of her senses there's no way this can happen no wonder she chuckled within herself wonder she laughed what a come on it's been 25 years I'm that's old how is this going to happen look at me look at all the wrinkles look at all the gray there's no way now watch therefore oh actually let's read this quote real quick we'll go back to that scripture brother said in birth pains watch what God said about this doubt now remember we look at this down we go yeah it kind of makes sense she's having this doubt but look what happened birth pains 65 but the one that was with the group that was pulled out done a miracle before Abraham to show that who he was and was with Abraham and he said why did Sarah laugh concerning this baby and Sarah come forth and said she didn't and said but you did and he would have killed her right there if she wasn't a part of Abraham so would God slay us if if we wasn't a part of Christ the mercy of Christ all holds us [Applause] together look at Sarah here you can see her doubts and go it makes sense it does make sense amen but watch What God Says to her here verse 13 and the Lord said unto there wherefore did sarus laugh saying shall I surely bear a child which I Watch What God Says verse 14 is anything too hard for the Lord I want you I want you to take this home with you this is part of the sermon I want you to take home stick in your pocket and take it out and think about this some more sometimes we treat Faith as oh if I could just muster up more faith if I could just get to this value of Faith then I could finally believe these promises then I could believe it but you you got the whole wrong thing about faith there it's not faith in yourself it's faith in God God so it's not trying to muster up enough faith I want to ask you the question why don't you believe that's what I hope you understand that's what God's doing to Sarah right here think about it why don't you believe it why why do you think sometimes it's too hard it's because you're thinking how you're going to do it you're thinking how nature can do it you're thinking how the government can do it but did you start thinking how God could do it and that's why he asked the question is anything too hard for the Lord right and then you have to sit there and go well wait a minute then I keep questioning how why don't I believe more the question is why don't I believe it if I really believe in God then why can't it happen what is anything too hard for the Lord no is anything too hard for the Lord no no really are you sure cuz sometimes how you pray says otherwise oh Preacher Brother Stephen see look at Sarah here Sarah's in the same boat we are a lot of times aren't we Sarah's in the same boat she's looking at the promise going how can this happen what and he and God comes around says wait a minute is that anything too hard for the Lord is that anything too hard for God Amen there's nothing too hard for God why can't she have a child then amen could you imagine that morning remember we know what happens thank God for the message of the hour can you say Amen there's a lot of more ways to prove this but I'm just going to try to save a little time but you look at this and you go wow could you imagine that morning waking up when God showed up remember they're still old and well stricken age at this point and then God says at the time of life I'm going to visit you and you're going to conceive so that's about a space of a month is okay so they're going to go from a hundredy old man back to a 20y old man in the space of one month this ain't just a gradual thing this happened in a moment in an instant Amen in a twinkling of an eye this happened glory to God boy could you imagine waking up that morning no doubt Abraham had a had a bad shoulder or something you know how it is getting older right now I'm getting a little bit of a bad knee because of of an accident I had at work so my left knee just feels a little weaker than my right so every time I wake up it's a little cranky you know what I mean work it out you know how it is when you get older just things start hurting and things like that but I wonder if Abraham woke up one day brother Bill amen he just woke up all say he goes what in the world where's that where's that pain in that shoulder glory to God I can't wait for this day Friends Hall glory to God what's that pain in that shoulder I had what in the world going on that I wonder if he rolled over in the bed and just saw the back side of a lady with nothing but black hair jump out of the bed whoa who's that lady in my bad Oh Glory to God and maybe you jumped a little hard that day it's like whoa I jumped really far normally I would have fell over by now being a hundredy old man he goes what's going on who's that lady maybe got a mirror on the side of the wall all a sudden he looks and whoa I'm back to my buff self you know what I mean look at look oh could you imagine that day I'm going to tell you something you ain't going to have to to imagine it one of these days amen we're going to experience this hallelujah we're going to have a body change too amen glory to God Sarah get up she's back to be a young woman again the promise came fulfilled amen and she was able to conceive and do you understand Sarah did nothing to deserve it she doubted we we didn't get to that part but remember she even told God he was a liar but because she was connected to Abraham God couldn't touch her y why because the promise was through Sarah no matter what happened do you remember the story of when Abraham sends a m a a lies sck the king abik that that's my sister not my wife and the King takes Sarah to be his wife and all of a sudden that night comes and he says you're good as a dead man right and I say what are you talking about I did this in the T did he not say that's Sarah his sister I didn't know it was his wife he says that's why I witheld Thee from sinning against me that's why you haven't done anything further do you know why God's doing this he says if you don't give that woman back to that man amen I'm going to destroy your whole nation I will destroy every you have why is he so IM intimate about this why is he getting on to it it's because the promise was through Sarah Hallelujah even when she remember she was obeying her husband and it she found herself in this condition and yet God showed up and got her out of the situation why the promise Hallelujah was that Sarah was going to have the child and no matter what Abraham did no matter how much Sarah unbelieved amen God was still going to fulfill his word through Sarah and he did Hallelujah and he did no wonder Sarah was laughing no wonder Sarah laughed when she finally had the son prise God God in all of her doubts I hope you hearing me I hope you can put you see yourself in the word a little bit here even in all your doubts sometimes and all your fears and the and in the days that you have bad days and you feel like Sarah calling God a liar to his face God is still going to fulfill his word through you so much that you now know why Sarah was laughing do you know why you know how why Sarah is laughing it's the same reason why you got to laugh sometimes you sit here and you think about the stuff that you did in your life and all the judgments that you deserved and you know you do I know I do I know the stuff that I did and I know the stuff I still do today to be honest with you and I need Grace just as much I hope you understand Sarah in the end had to laugh to herself and receive the son despite her feelings of inferiority and despite her feelings of not feeling worth it she still had to Humble herself and receive the grace for her sins just like you sometimes you think that you have to punish yourself I think I shared this with you last time I don't remember it might have been another church I don't remember but I remember one time I did something really stupid boneheaded thing and I knew I shouldn't have done it the Bible says if the Lord should Mark iniquity who could stand but I hated myself I just hated myself and I was like I can't believe I did that I I feel like a failure I got down on my knees and I said God you need to punish me I said God I need to be in trouble for this I need to Bear my body's the mark of Jesus here I got on I said God I was praying for punishment and this you know what God spoke to me it a still Small Voice and God can still do it yes he can he said no he said because you would have more faith in punishment than faith in me and do you know what I had to do I had to lay aside my pride because that's what it was I wouldn't feel safe saved until I got punished but I had to lay aside my pride I can't take it back I can't take it back remember I hope you're hearing me you can't go back tomorrow and take it back you can't do it right but can you receive Grace for it and just say Lord Lord I I failed Lord I failed Lord I doubted Lord some of my actions have called you a liar I ruin my testimony sometimes Lord listen I hope you understand my hands are up right now too I failed God and I can't go back and change it Lord but Lord God I'm willing to lay aside my pride I'm willing to lay all my ambitions my opinions say God you're right and I was wrong and I need your grace in order to receive the promised son Hallelujah that's what I need you see why Sarah laughed the law and the rules can't make you laugh it makes you more depressed but when you start getting that kind of an attitude you have to just say God I give my all to you wo I give my all I can't do it wow this sermon is going a little different now than I [Music] thought listen this this kind of thinking isn't just applying to our attitude towards the Rapture I wonder if this is why we're messed up on our day-to-day sometimes being able to receive how many times have you spent condemning yourself I wonder how many times times have you tried to get yourself in trouble oh brother I got to reap what I sowed listen God gives the increase you remember remember what what did Paul say Paul said Paul planted apoll watered but God gives the increase listen we don't decide who gets the judgments when you reap what you sow you reap what you sow God is the one that reaps God's the one that's going to reap it God decides the increase it's not up to you how much trouble you should get into like I said how often do we spend time condemning ourselves oh this is going way different I want you to open up to Romans 17 oh you forgive me Church uh let's just let's just read Romans 17s and we're going to try to wrap it up here but I really I really feel this impressed now Romans chapter 7 we're going to read Romans chapter 7 and we'll make it to verse uh chapter eight and then we'll see what the Lord does Amen but I want you to really start be able to receive this Grace this is why Sarah laughed and that's is why you can understand why when you look at Sarah you could laugh with her because you have to experience the same kind of Grace and I'm going to show you something listen you need to quit trying to throw yourself under the bus quit trying to punish yourself and get you listen that's why sometimes you don't get down your knees and pray because you don't feel worthy so then you go well there's no point in approaching God look how much sin I did there's no point in approaching God now and then what happens it just turns into a cycle now you're not even approaching God about anything then it's hard to go to church you just sit there bored to church because because it's it's going to go right through any one not the other that's why these bad things happen a lot almost all the time is because of this condemnation Spirit true I want to show you something here I want to show you something here about yourself here Paul said this about himself in Romans 7 verse 15 for that which I do I allow not for what I would that do I not but what I hate that do I all right Paul Paul something wrong not you Paul this Paul maybe you too though you got to put yourself in the word though so we'll use you anyways you forgive me I was just saying Paul and I looked right at him so what is Paul saying here is there two people standing here how can you do something you hate and yet he's saying those things that I hate that do I verse 16 if then I do that which I would not I consent unto the law that it is good remember that that's part of repentance is being able to admit the words right and you're wrong so you we don't lose that even when you're not necessarily fulfilling it and you're not living up to Snuff in your own eyes this is still right and you're not that's what he's saying that if I do that which I would not I am consenting that this is right see a lot of people think that oh you can sit and do whatever you want it's okay no it's not okay you're at see it's more than just what you're doing it's your attitude towards the word they're saying oh I could still smoke and be a Christian no that's wrong now let's let's take another smoker who tries to be a Christian he goes I know this is wrong I'm just praying I stop yet they're both smoking yet one's going to be okay and one's not going to be okay what was the difference it was not the action it's their attitude towards it one didn't admit the word's right one did admit the word's right there's a lot more chance for that guy than this guy a whole lot more chance so what does Paul say here now so he's sing unto the law that it is good verse 17 now then it is no more that I do it but sin that dwell within me huh he just said he did it yet now he's saying he didn't do it how does this work what's going on who did it then that's a good point so he's going to explain it Verse 18 for I know that in me that is my flesh now we got the bad guy now we found the bad guy you know I had somebody argue with me about predestination one time and and and I was teaching about predestination and so forth he came up to me and said I just don't understand that predestination Stephen I don't get it I'm like well what do you don't get I'm here to help he said well the Bible says for there's no good thing in me and I said uhuh you didn't finish that scripture you didn't finish what Paul said he said for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing wait a minute there's something good in you then there is something good in you amen it's the hidden man of the heart there is something good about you and Paul is saying I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing so now let's take it to the other side did you know there is no good thing about your flesh at all right there is nothing not one ounce of your flesh that's good it's all evil the Bible says you were born born in sin shaken iniquity you came for for the wo speaking lines there is no good thing about your flesh Peter said abstain from fleshly lust which war against the soul we just sang that song huh we're going to war or whatever it was that's the war we're talking about we're not talking about the war where we fight each other we're talking about the war that the flesh before the soul amen so you see what Paul's saying here for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for the will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do I tell you a brother I've been there I think I'm here just about every day of my life it's not even that bad sometimes it's just those stupid YouTube shorts you know what I I mean well maybe some of the younger crowd knows what I mean or the Facebook reals I hate those things man some of them are catchy so it's funny for 20 seconds and then all of a sudden you're swiping and you're stuck for 20 minutes and you go what did I just do for which I would do not that do I don't you to hate that stuff it's just a waste of time too you probably didn't even see nothing bad a lot of times mine is just a denomination preachers preaching and stuff like that some make good points some make bad points that's true but see I I just look at it and then I just wasted 20 minutes and I go where'd it go I didn't want to do that and yet here I am doing it you see what I hope you understand you got put yourself in the word okay Paul but watch what he says here now if I do that which I want not not it is no more that I do it but sin that dwelleth in me wait a minute so where's the sin it's not listen when you get circumcised by the Holy Ghost it separates you your soul is separated from your flesh amen so see you are a new creature in Christ you're different oh hallelujah oh here let's keep reading here because I want to get to one more point and we'll be done verse 20 again now if I do that which I would not it is no more that I do it but sin that dwelleth in me I find in a law that when I would do good evil is present with me for I Delight in the law of God after for the inward man a hidden man of the heart but I see another law in my members Waring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity the law of sin which is in my members oh wred man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death you ever felt like that before what is he talking about I hope you understand he's talking about this oh you forgive me church for this I'm listen listen did you know they even proven this scientifically that your flesh fights your uh your choice who you are your flesh can fight you that you even take um uh you take dieting and so forth A lot of times when you start trying to like keto diets or whatever like that and you start start losing carbs or whatever you're and you you'll find yourself start wanting sweets and yet you think about it your body doesn't actually need sugar you know what you actually lose when you go on those low carb diets and things like that you actually lose salt you actually lose a lot of salt and sodium that's why you get leg cramps and things like that but yet your body was trained into thinking where did it get the salt all the time from those sweets and so it mixed up those things and that's why you're getting a sweet cake craving even though your body actually needs salt your body can lie to you y That's right listen listen take addiction for a second we were talking about smoking earlier did you know there's nobody in the world addicted addicted to nicotine did you know that do you know what happens when you take a cigarette and it puts nicotine in your body you know what your body does it reacts to that nicotine by releasing hormones they're called the Feelgood chemicals listen and that's what listen I hate doing it like this but it's a truth people if you never experienced it don't ever even try to figure it out please don't but they call it a buzz that's what happens is that when the chemicals go up into your brain and you start feeling good you get a buzz and that's what's happening it was not the nicotine that did it it was the hormones that your own body produced and you know what happens so you'll take a cigarette and you go oh I feel good oh I feel good and then you keep doing it over and over again oh I feel good but guess what guess what happens after a little while see see this is where the devil don't tell you the whole story this is where the world don't tell you the whole story don't worry God sent an angel to tell you the whole story cuz you know what's going to happen to you later all a sudden you stop feeling so good and guess what now you start feeling terrible you'll wake up every morning with what they call smoker's lung and it's a real thing because I've done it what happens is you wake up you start hacking up along and the only way to fix it is to light it up it's the only way to fix it and you got to take another cigarette and guess what you don't feel good anymore when you do it it's normal now see and what happens now you're in a prison you're in prison now see that's the rest of the story y amen we don't want listen they and listen can I say this where did that stuff come from what's the chemicals that the body's looking for it's the chemicals out of its own self what is it oxycotton and and do and dopamines and things like that that's what the body's looking for so then when those chemicals leave the brain the body goes Hey where's my chemicals where's my hormones and how do you get the hormones back you got to do a cigarette they've done that with alcohol that's why you have drunks did you know they' proven this with gambling see it's not just a substance thing it's not just a substance thing because people think oh it's because you're putting a certain chemical in your body that's triggering the hormone like I said they proven it with gambling they've proven that when you gamble and things like that and that's why listen you oh well maybe I'm just giving you some little tools to fight later or something like that amen you remember something about gambling there's a saying The House Always Wins y if you gamble you're nothing but a loser right you may win a couple times in the beginning why are you winning a couple times in the beginning to get you addicted you'll get the dopamine hit you'll get the chemicals in your brain but guess what happens later all a sudden you'll start losing and start losing and start losing and what do you keep chasing you're not even chasing money anymore if you were you'd keep your money if you were really Chas if there people addicted to gambling did you know in order for gambling to be allowed in the state of Ohio they had to create a hotline to help people being addicted to gambling crazy what a stupid world we live in you know you know what they call it the syntax right you know what the syntax is for cigarette smokes and then they start programs in those schools because they use the syntax to pay for the schools and in those schools they create dare programs to get people off smoking and drinking Y and yet they need the smokers and drinkers to pay for the Dare program to start tell people see the world's insane when they come up with plans they can't come up with a good one can they that's why they want to start legalizing marijuana so they can make more money off of it the Bible says fear those that make merchandise of you that's right what the world does all they do is you're just a person to make them more money y That's all gambling's going to do for you too well this this is going a lot different I hope you forgive me amen we're supposed to about how great grace is and everything like that amen but I'm going to tell you something amen fleshly lust which war against the soul that's what Paul's talking about did Paul have a micro a microscope to see all those enzymes and things like that no he knew how the world operated he knew these things happened and then science broke into more and found out huh Paul was right the whole time you can do things that you would not do amen your flesh can desire something that you don't want you're a body hear me Church your body can lie to you amen just because you don't feel good don't mean you're wrong preach it brother Stephen we always talk about it God's not about emotions God's not about feelings and yet we use feelings to almost justify everything in our life oh I was feeling bad that's why I need to do this oh I'm feeling bad that's why I need to do that are you sure are you sure if it's contrary to this it don't matter what you feel that's why sometimes when you come to church you don't feel good afterwards you know why it's just like what B's mama said they have their bath and after their bath what you have to get that shot of castor oil and brother R brother R was said to Mom said Mama I hate that stuff why we got to take it said if it don't hurt you it don't do you no good right that's why sometimes you go to church it's not a big old joyous time and everything's okay sometimes it's time to get down in the Rubber and face the fact that you got problems that need to be fixed amen amen thank you Lord see brother Stephen you think we deal with that I have no idea to be honest with you but I'll say this you may not deal with it today but it might come up tomorrow it's so sneaky folks and it's getting worse and worse to this day just you know I left my phone in the office just those phones Al low and have one ad they're doing it with sports betting now and things like that trying to hook you into gambling I I get them because I'm a I'm a you know 35 to 40 year old male so they assume I like sports a lot and so you get those ads on your Facebook and things like that or on YouTube or something like that about DraftKings and things like that and and and and what are they trying to do they're trying to get you into sports betting to just try here here's $1,000 worth of bets there ain't nowhere they're handing thousand bets to everybody if they ain't making a dime see it's getting worse and worse and all it is is just one little ad on your phone boom you see why it's so important to have the Holy Ghost in this day and age it is so important and you say brother Stephen I've had the Holy Ghost for 30 years well then you better make sure you have it 30 years in one day the Bible says make your calling and election sure how often didn't say you know why you probably ought to do it every time you wake up I hope you I hope you love brother Stephen after this amen but I hope you understand what brother see I'm going to invite the musicians up because I want to I just really feel a solemn time right now in my heart especially because I'm feeling it too a little bit it's so easy for us Americans to get caught up in politics World stuff listen I'm not even fully against Sports and stuff like you know what I mean like throwing around a pig skin I don't whatever you know maybe the a lot of stuff around it it's wrong that's the truth ain't it a lot of that stuff around that stuff's wrong but the idea of just that and things like that a lot of times the things in our life are just those small little things like that and we come to find out they're wasting our time yeah and as soon as you stop doing it listen I've even tried to challenge myself and I don't know how much I succeed can you go without an electronic for one day you know what I mean I ask my myself these questions I don't think it's going to make me any more saved you understand that I don't think it's going to make me any more saved than the next person I'm saved because of Grace of almighty God who died on the cross for my sins that's why I'm going to make it but just think about that for a second could I go one day without electricity you know what I mean just one day and not even electricity just Electronics in general you know what I mean like could I actually do it and here's the thing folks I'm gonna be real with you I don't know my whole life's wrapped around it true you know what I mean yeah and then we wonder why we're not closer to God sometimes why church can be hard sometimes to go to in the morning why sometimes it feels like we're fighting fighting uh uh uh when the preacher says something and you just sit there and go well he doesn't know everything about it he don't need to know everything about it maybe you need to know more about it why why do we do that sometimes we're blaming everything else but sometimes we got to face the miror folks sometimes we got to face it because I I want to end with this can you bring up Romans 81 we read all that stuff I want you to understand something we're talking about this but I want you to remember about this in Romans 8 verse1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit that's what I want to be said about me and I want to challenge us this morning I want to challenge myself as well to be honest with you what does it mean when we say we walk not out of the flesh but after the spirit When God Says something in the spirit to do it we ought to do it true amen if God's leading us a certain way and I'm not I'm just using the electronic S as an example I hope you understand I'm not condemning there's no condemnation to Christ so there's no condemnation to us we're in Christ what I'm saying is if the spirit would ask us to do something are we willing God you forgive me Church what is what does it mean when we say we surrender all to God when we surrender all you know take things that you like oh let's take something I like I really like Taco Bell I shouldn't eat Taco Bell shouldn't do it but I like it okay now if God would come to me one day and said Stephen I am now calling you to eat Taco Bell every day of your life from now to Forever I'd be like well I better yield to the Lord I better yield to the Lord Jesus he said eat taco well every day you see that'd be easy for me to do there'd be no complaints for me either but see is that real surr what if God asked you to do something you don't want to do right you know what I mean what if God asked you to do something you don't want to do can you surrender to God I'll give you a little example of this and we'll close with this even witnessing about the gospel when you're at the grocery store sometimes I don't I know this happen because I felt it you get scared to say God bless you yeah why because you don't want to offend anybody and it's getting really bad out nowadays to be honest with you it's so easy to offend somebody nowadays what if God told you to do it could you even just say a simple God bless you to somebody could you yield to that who knows you might save a soul doing it what if that one little God bless you could save somebody's life oh my goodness you forgive me for this one more testimony I hope you don't mind let me I just called you guys up and everything sometimes you don't even know what those words are going to do to people a couple times I brought a family with me the Delaney family Steve Delaney and so forth I worked at solder word workking the first day I worked there I met a girl named Jessica and I started witnessing to her about the gospel I witnessed to her for the whole shift about the things God did for me it was third shift and I went towards the end of the shift I was walking out the door there was a Mexican man that approached me he said God nice to see you what's your name I'm Stephen his name was Eddie he said are you a Christian and I said yes sir I'm a Christian and he said well I already knew you were a Christian how did you know I was a Christian already he's like there was a third shift forklift driver driving around and overheard you talking to this lady about Jesus wow he said that third shift driver and me get together every day and pray with each other he said would you want to pray with me pray with us I said yes sir I'd love to pray with you he said we do a Tuesday men's bible study for the first and third shifters said would you like to come to that sure I'll come to that that third shift driver was named Steve Delaney and we started talking to each other I would go to the men's bible studies and one night we started talking about some end time things started talking about some end time things and I said you know God can't do these end time things until he first brings a last sign to the Gentiles and it was get close to the end and he said and I said can I bring it next time they said yes Stephen bring the we want to hear what you got to say it was up a good 15 men there so I went there the next Tuesday and I taught brother Brandon right out of the Bible listen you don't need quotes to teach brother bam brother bam was already in the Bible before brother bam showed up before anybody else showed up in this room brother bam was already in the Bible amen so I just took my Bible and said see there needs to be a name Nam brother Bram and I handed them all Church age books that day all 15 it was 20 it was like 15 or 20 that night that night all a sudden I hear a forklift [Music] Drive I worked on the highman line so it was a lamentation line for the boards and so forth and he drove right up with me and he started talking to me all night said Stephen I need to know more about this man named brother brandham something in him told him there was something right about what I said he said and we started talking started talking took about a year and a half until finally he said Stephen I got it I want to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can I say this when I met him he had three daughters he ended up getting a son all of a sudden Ashley gets saved filled with the Holy Ghost believ in this message Mary's a preacher at Paul's Church Josiah cornette his second daughter Aura when she was 12 years old receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost she was the only one to do it that day she received the Holy Ghost got changed married a boy over there at Paul's Church Aubrey when she was was about 11 years old got saved and filled with the Holy Ghost and got baptized at my brother's church amen they're having children and those children are being raised according to the word those that entire family and those families that Branch off of them were saved because one man talked to somebody else hallelujah oh glory to God you remember something I wasn't looking for Steve but when God wanted Steve saved he made sure Steve came right there and because I was willing to say the name of Jesus God was able to save another soul and not only save his soul but his wife's Soul his kids Souls they're married and their children Souls will be saved as well you don't know what that God bless you going going to do you don't know why don't you bring it up next [Applause] time I look at that testimony I've said that testimony a thousand times but yet when I say it every time all I can do is laugh all I can say is God has made me to laugh God is so good ain't he his grace is so prevailing it's so real it's so rich it can overcome any sin amen it can overcome any fear Hallelujah and anxiety and depression and anything the devil is trying to handle [Music] you let's bow our heads for a prayer most gracious kind Heavenly Father Lord oh God we thank you Lord for your grace and your mercy Lord God we thank you Lord for your love we look at Sarah and we look that through her doubts and her fears Lord you still brought the promise to her God no wonder Sarah had a laugh and Lord I wonder if we can look at our lives for a second as well and just say thank you Lord for I look at these moments in my life where I could have easily been destroyed easily been dead but yet somehow Lord I'm still here this morning and I'm so thankful for it God we're so thankful and no and I pray Lord God if we have any sins any besetting sins my hands are up as well Lord any sins that we got to get under the blood Lord I pray in the the name of Jesus we lay it aside right now humble ourselves before the might of almighty God and be able to receive Grace and receive strength as Sarah did for the Bible says that they shall approach the throne of grace boldly that they may find the grace and the mercy in the time of need Lord here's your church here's the time of need right now Lord God we approach your throne of grace boldly God say we believe in all your word we believe it God yes Lord though my actions may not have been all right Lord I admit you're still right your word is still right and I'm sorry and I'm wrong for all those things that I've done and now I humble myself before you Lord say God I don't have a chance without your grace and your mercy Here I Am Lord lifting my hands Here I Am Lord saying I can't do it without you lord I give up Lord I give up on myself and I said Lord I ain't got a chance but with you Hallelujah Lord the Bible says with men it's impossible but With God all things are possible and I pray God you would change these bodies Lord first change that soul that change my spirit then one of these days you're going to change my body not just to a younger self but you'll change the very molecules of my body Lord but before that day comes here we are Lord we can't change the past but we can put it all under the blood and now we can cry as the bride there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ I pray if there's any sin left Lord they would just start bearing it Lord God putting it under the blood Lord God I pray not one single person would leave this place condemned we talked about some hard things this morning Lord we talked about tricks of the devil and WS of the devil lord and no doubt if nobody was spoken to surely it was me Lord cuz I know that I've been tricked I've experienced those WS of the devil but I pray God as we sift through all that we just take them one at a time and put them under the blood I don't want to take a chance Lord God without you lord we want to surrender all to you Lord give it all to you God yeah I pray not a single soul under the sound of my voice will leave condemned I pray I pray those who don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost I pray in the name of Jesus today will be the day where they change their decision they change the direction there is a chance for them yet they've experienced the world they experienced pain and suffering but there's hope and glory in Christ and I pray they would just change their ship right now Lord God and allow Mercy to come in Lord Lord I pray those with the Holy Ghost who may have forgotten God that Lord you would send a Revival fire in their souls Lord as brother B taught us the Revival is given to us to wash up all the dirt and all the sins out of us Lord all the doubts and the fears Lord God I pray a Revival would spring up in our souls Lord God not just for a move of the church but for each individual under the sound of my voice would just reach up and say Lord I need a shake it up in my heart I need the sins purged out of me I need the doubts and the fears to be erased from me oh God it doesn't matter how high high the pile's been packed Lord God you are An Almighty Creator and you can take care of it all for you said cast all your care upon him for my yoke is easy and my burden is light oh oh God help us Lord help us Lord so that we by the time we leave this morning we can be like [Music] Sarah that though you though I've done all these wrong things though I've done all these terrible things God still hasn't left me and he still fulfills his word in my life and I could

and your mercy Lord Lord Brother bam said If God Was changeable we couldn't believe him but because you're unchangeable that means your grace and your mercy will never change so that means when we experienced it first it never goes away that no matter the sins and the issues that we do your grace and mercy Mercy will never be changed and we can be like Sarah now the Lord has made me to laugh it's because of his grace is so great to me that it just brings me to laughter I just I have to help I can't do anything else no matter how much I try to do I can't do anything else but simply accept it that this is the grace God gave for me and I accept it and I put it in my heart and I allow it to change me Lord for you're unchangeable you're unshakable Your Grace is Unstoppable you're healing is Unstoppable your promise will never fail your deliverance it's unshakable when God delivered God delivers nobody can shake you back into it we can have faith of that and now we can finally say now we understand why Sarah was laughing why was Sarah laughing it's because of all of her things God still gave her grace and gave her the promise anyhow oh God that's how the Rapture will be to us brother man called it rapturing Grace to us it's not going to be because of our actions one of these moments we're going to be changed and it'll be Rapture in grace to our hearts and we'll be able to finally do that that one laugh when when Sarah finally had that son when the promised son finally came there was no time for Tears there was not time for sadness all the pain was behind her now cuz she had the son one of these days Lord the Bible says we will meet the Lord in the air we'll meet you in the air Lord God and we'll leave behind all the pain and the Suffering The doubts and the fears the depression and the anxiety we ain't taking a one with us Lord and we take we leave it all behind and we'll finally be up with you in the air and forever the Bible says forever shall we be with the Lord and in that day there'll be no more time for crying there won't be no sadness and I wonder if we'll finally say God hath made me to laugh when we finally make it thank you Lord Jesus for your promise Lord we thank you Lord for your promise you've given to us today Lord God I pray in the name of Jesus that we continue to keep pressing forward we can't change the past but we can change today for the Bible says today is the day of salvation may we leave as a new person Hallelujah not just change to a formal self but a different kind of change a change when the Holy Ghost comes into our hearts and changes us from the inside out Hallelujah don't you love the Lord let's just give him a little time and let's just thank the Lord for his goodness and his grace Lord we lift our hands and we say to you Lord Jesus we thank you Lord for your grace in your mercy Lord we understand that we have done nothing to earn it as a matter of fact we can point to a lot of things that tells us we don't deserve it and sometimes we walk this life we feel unworthy but Lord we lift our hands as a sign of surrender saying Lord I receive your grace and I want your grace and mercy to work and change in my life more and more every day let the Bride of Jesus Christ say so let the bride just claim the grace that she has let the bride know let the the bride declare it amen that I'm without spot and without wrinkle I'm the sinless Bride of Jesus Christ not because of what I've done but because of what the blood did to me and I stand here and I claim it as my promise and I walk in Freedom I walk in Freedom this moment Lord I walk in the Liberty as Paul said Stand Fast in the Liberty wherein Christ has made you [Music] free and we walk a changed person I want to thank you Lord for this morning's service Lord as we all bow our heads and pray together Lord I Want to Thank You Lord for this time you've given to us God it's been such a precious time even to me Lord you you really spoke to to us today and maybe maybe in some ways where we don't see the fruit of it yet maybe in some ways where we do now Lord but Lord we believe in the sovereignty of God we believe Lord that you are always in control Lord God and we want to thank you Lord for your spirit coming by and vindicating your word to our souls Lord Lord as we pray together as we come to the closing of this service we pray God In The Name of Jesus Lord Lord God it's so easy to believe in grace in here but it's when we go out in the world Monday where we're going to need this grace to come by again Lord where we're going to need this sweeping of the Holy Spirit I pray God In The Name of Jesus these the bride will not forget not forget who's the one in control and when they're going when that depression Spirit comes and makees makes them nervous again oh God I pray you raise the standard of the Holy Ghost in their heart and they'll remember the words of this servant God and they'll remember Lord God that it was Grace that saved them and it'll be grace that keeps them and it'll be grace that raptures them and so they don't have to fear anymore they don't have to be depressed God's on their side and God's watching them help us Lord as the Bride of Jesus Christ to keep pressing forward to keep marching on in your grace until that one day when we receive the promised son and we'll be able to say like

their minds by the way of remembrance that God it's the word that keeps them it's not psychology it's not better instruments and better music and a bigger building but Lord they'll be the word that'll
