[31:52] and i i believe
[31:54] that's the reality
[31:56] of the son of man
[31:58] in bridefort
[32:00] it's god with skin
[32:03] it's what it is it ought it all comes
[32:05] down to because with all of
[32:07] the mysteries and the opening all of
[32:09] those
[32:10] of the seals coming off of the book is
[32:12] so that we might see
[32:14] ourselves
[32:16] our position
[32:18] and come into that in christ
[32:20] and then it's lived out what is it it's
[32:23] christ it's jesus christ
[32:25] living that same life through your life
[32:27] through my life
[32:29] all of those avenues and all those
[32:31] different ones that we would touch and
[32:33] come in contact with
[32:34] i believe that because this gospel is
[32:36] not it's not a complex gospel man's made
[32:39] it complicated but it's simple
[32:41] i just
[32:42] i know there was
[32:44] just hearing different comments and
[32:46] reports and different ones that you know
[32:47] that were outside of the family or maybe
[32:50] was connected and they're they're seeing
[32:52] that display of love but we didn't do it
[32:55] for a display we did it because we love
[32:57] them
[32:58] and we love god's people
[33:00] and
[33:01] i just want to say thank you for all of
[33:03] those that come together
[33:05] to make that day possible
[33:08] knowing that was that'll not not only
[33:11] would be a difficult day but
[33:13] you know just something was so
[33:15] it was so precious
[33:17] you know i had different brothers
[33:19] praying
[33:20] and um
[33:22] to see how the holy spirit and all of us
[33:24] were praying but you know right there
[33:25] from the very beginning of that service
[33:28] yesterday he came
[33:32] he came
[33:34] and that's what made the difference
[33:36] he came in the room
[33:38] and we just so thank god for that
[33:41] and he's we want to continue to remember
[33:43] the walker family in prayer because
[33:47] every day
[33:48] and moment by moment just when as i
[33:50] mentioned to him at the very beginning i
[33:52] said we just don't we can't think a day
[33:54] we can't think a day ahead we just have
[33:56] to ask god for grace for this moment we
[33:58] just need strength from this moment this
[34:00] minute we'll get to the next minute when
[34:02] he gets here we'll get to the next hour
[34:03] but we need grace for just right now we
[34:04] we can't look ahead
[34:07] and i'm glad that god gives sufficient
[34:09] grace aren't you
[34:10] amen so we just
[34:12] just know that even now that even as we
[34:14] go forward in that
[34:16] um with
[34:18] the walker family and just continuing
[34:20] just to reach out and love
[34:23] amen to
[34:25] reach out to them
[34:27] and just to encourage them and to check
[34:29] on them
[34:30] will we do that
[34:32] amen let's continue to do that amen also
[34:35] remember i just when i spoke with sister
[34:37] michelle yesterday
[34:39] uh brother bobby had been telling me you
[34:41] know he was getting better and and we
[34:43] had even had prayer for him here last
[34:44] thursday night and and he is he's doing
[34:48] he's doing much better we want to
[34:50] continue to keep him in prayer
[34:52] sister linda when i mentioned to you
[34:54] last thursday
[34:55] my aunt linda she was supposed to go
[34:57] remember i said to therapy from the
[34:58] hospital
[35:00] they sent her straight home on friday
[35:01] morning
[35:02] and so we just thank god for that
[35:05] that probably had more to do with
[35:07] insurance but we'd still thank god for
[35:09] that anybody would rather be at home you
[35:11] know than being at the hospital and
[35:13] somebody say hey hey hey excuse me are
[35:15] you resting well
[35:17] i was
[35:21] but uh we so we thank god for that she
[35:24] thanks you
[35:25] for for your prayers and so we just have
[35:29] been in communication with her there
[35:31] also remember brother joseph and sister
[35:33] ethelene in prayer
[35:35] i don't know if i had mentioned to you
[35:36] but a couple weeks ago or maybe as a
[35:38] week and a half ago my times are all
[35:40] over the place on this
[35:42] but sister ethelene had to go to a
[35:44] funeral in south carolina did i mention
[35:45] this to you or she got in a bad accident
[35:48] so on the way back so on the way home
[35:51] uh
[35:52] coming home from that
[35:54] uh
[35:55] funeral where she had to go to in south
[35:57] carolina for one of her uncles
[35:59] and really she was very close to him
[36:00] well she went drove by herself well
[36:03] on the way home
[36:04] she fell asleep next thing she knows her
[36:07] car's airborne
[36:09] and she wakes up
[36:11] so it's the grace of god that
[36:13] there's quite a bit of damage on the
[36:15] vehicle she was able to make it home
[36:18] and um
[36:20] and so we just want to remember continue
[36:22] to remember her in prayer as well
[36:25] i don't know why
[36:26] it wasn't maybe it was when we had that
[36:28] service change or whatever more but
[36:30] that's why i have my wife helping me
[36:32] with even certain things and that wasn't
[36:33] even about this but
[36:36] i i need all of you to remind me that's
[36:38] why when somebody tells me hey brother
[36:40] simon i said just text me
[36:42] because if i don't put a reminder on the
[36:43] phone
[36:44] it's out of sight out of mind
[36:51] not really but i feel that way
[36:55] so don't ever think that your need or
[36:56] whatever is not important it's important
[36:58] it's important and know this
[37:00] that though it may slip my mind it never
[37:03] slips god's mind
[37:05] never slips his mind so
[37:07] also this coming sunday lord willing we
[37:09] plan on having the fire pit fellowship
[37:10] out here just
[37:12] just to get around just the fire
[37:14] fellowship testimonies seeing to have a
[37:16] little bit of time

[39:59] and i'm just going to read two verses of
[40:01] scripture and we'll let you have your
[40:02] seats
[40:03] boy i hear all those bibles turning
[40:10] if you have your phone use your phone or
[40:11] your tablet
[40:13] i know some people get sticky about that
[40:15] but it's all the bible
[40:18] it's all the bible
[40:20] it doesn't matter if it's on your ipad
[40:22] or your phone and and i get it i like my
[40:24] bible at home that i study out of i
[40:26] write i write notes in it i write i do
[40:29] all my i write cross references of
[40:31] things that as i'm going through it you
[40:33] know i i like my bible but i i get it so
[40:37] we just were able to do that so don't
[40:39] think you won't ever offend me or
[40:41] whatever i'm not
[40:42] you you know me by now i'm not like that
[40:44] like oh
[40:46] we're gonna throw you in the message
[40:47] prison because you're using a phone for
[40:49] you know here uh we're gonna exile you
[40:52] because you're using a phone to look up
[40:53] the scriptures now
[40:58] job chapter one verse nine
[41:01] then satan answered the lord and said
[41:03] doth job feared god for not
[41:07] past thou hast not thou made an hedge
[41:12] about him and about his house and about
[41:14] all that he hath on every side
[41:17] thou has blessed the work of his hands
[41:20] and his substance is increased in the
[41:22] land
[41:23] may god bless you bless the reading of
[41:25] the word as you're being seated would
[41:27] you turn also right to the next chapter
[41:29] job chapter 2
[41:33] and what we're just referring to is
[41:35] where
[41:36] here was a council
[41:38] sons of god come to present themselves
[41:40] for the lord and
[41:42] satan
[41:43] came also and
[41:45] hear that remember it was a testimony
[41:48] that was going on in heaven job wasn't
[41:50] aware of it
[41:52] and
[41:53] it was where that satan already knew
[41:55] this about job but here in remember in
[41:58] verse 10
[41:59] satan points out to god what we just
[42:01] read for our text
[42:02] that i can't get to him i can't get to
[42:05] anything about his life i can't get to
[42:08] anything physically matter of fact satan
[42:11] says i can't even harm a blade of grass
[42:14] on his property
[42:17] are you hearing me
[42:20] he said bill samuel doesn't say that it
[42:21] does say that because the first petition
[42:23] is let me affect his environment what's
[42:27] around him
[42:29] and so
[42:30] that's where god had said or satan had
[42:32] said i i you know
[42:34] you've got a hedge around him that's why
[42:36] i can't do it and you know so
[42:38] then in verse 4 of job chapter 2 let me
[42:41] just go straight for there
[42:43] this is where that satan is is come
[42:46] after you know job's sons have been
[42:49] taken and daughters
[42:51] and where you know all of the livestock
[42:54] and
[42:54] everything that's all around servants
[42:57] all of those things have been taken
[42:59] and satan here is once again requesting
[43:04] and says in verse 4 skin for skin yea
[43:07] all that a man hath
[43:09] he will give for his life but put forth
[43:12] thine hand now and touch his bone and
[43:15] his flesh and he will curse thee to thy
[43:18] face
[43:19] and the lord said unto satan behold he
[43:22] is in thine hand
[43:24] but save his life
[43:26] so now satan's received permission
[43:30] to come against job's body
[43:34] see
[43:34] when we understand this
[43:36] satan
[43:38] has to receive permission from god
[43:42] if there's anything
[43:44] that
[43:45] when we see the reality
[43:48] of election and predestination i'm not
[43:50] going to go so heavy upon that part
[43:52] tonight but you can't preach the gospel
[43:55] without preaching predestination and
[43:57] election
[43:58] because the gospel is the message of
[44:01] redemption that is sent from the mind of
[44:03] god to claim those thoughts
[44:06] sons and daughters of god that god had
[44:09] in his mind and his wrote in the lamb's
[44:11] book of life
[44:12] so that's the whole purpose of the
[44:14] gospel
[44:15] but thanks be to god that for there are
[44:17] many others that are not in the plan of
[44:20] redemption
[44:21] but they receive salvation
[44:24] are you hearing me because there is the
[44:26] lamb section of the book of life and
[44:29] then there is the book of life
[44:31] so the lamb section that the lamb
[44:34] section if we can put it in this way the
[44:35] lamb section would be like if i could
[44:37] give an example would be like my
[44:39] children they're my children they they
[44:41] have come from my loins
[44:43] but then the book of life would be like
[44:46] your children i love your children now
[44:48] don't don't go don't misread i'm just
[44:50] trying to give you an example don't say
[44:51] oh you're saying my children the book of
[44:53] life that's not what i'm saying i'm
[44:54] giving an example that my children that
[44:56] come out of my loins they would be that
[44:59] which is the example of the lamb's book
[45:01] of life they've come to express me they
[45:04] they're not going to look like you
[45:06] uh they're going to look like me they're
[45:07] going to have attributes and those
[45:08] expressions of me but you know what your
[45:11] children i would love your children
[45:13] right i love your children and that's
[45:15] that's god the children of god of that
[45:18] of the election is that which was in god
[45:21] before the foundation of the world but
[45:23] because of the fall then the book of
[45:27] life comes into view
[45:28] and in the book of life there will be
[45:30] many that not in the bride but will
[45:33] receive salvation
[45:37] is that right
[45:38] and so that clarity is so set before us
[45:41] because even
[45:44] we can see how brother branham had to
[45:45] address that so but i want to just kind
[45:47] of track back to the point
[45:49] when we're looking at election and
[45:50] predestination
[45:52] that to recognize that satan it's you're
[45:56] not here by chance tonight
[45:58] it's not whoo i got lucky today there's
[46:01] no such thing as luck
[46:04] we are here by design
[46:10] election makes it clear it makes it sure
[46:14] that satan cannot
[46:16] touch
[46:18] anything unless he first
[46:20] gets permission from god
[46:24] not even a blade of grass on your
[46:26] property
[46:30] satan had to go get permission let me
[46:32] touch his livestock let me touch let me
[46:34] touch his dog let me touch his day he
[46:36] had to get permission first of
[46:38] everything that is connected with job
[46:44] and satan has to get permission
[46:46] and he asked that the hedge would be
[46:49] removed so he could touch his
[46:50] surroundings and then he asked to touch
[46:53] the hedge that was regarding his job's
[46:57] physical body
[46:58] and that hedge that was but there was a
[47:01] hedge around job's life satan could only
[47:03] go so far with
[47:04] whatever you know we know it was boils
[47:06] that he that that he came that came upon
[47:09] his body but it wouldn't matter what it
[47:11] was you could take the most deadliest of
[47:13] disease
[47:15] and satan could say i'm going to come at
[47:18] job with this deadly disease
[47:21] but if god has said you can't touch his
[47:25] life
[47:26] it can only go so far and god said
[47:29] that's far enough
[47:36] hallelujah so
[47:39] you know and and the thing of it is as
[47:41] far as our physical life which is this
[47:44] life or the life that we have and god
[47:47] has said you can't touch his life
[47:49] that cannot be touched until the purpose
[47:53] of god has been served or fulfilled
[47:58] and i want to speak tonight on the
[48:00] untouchable
[48:03] the untouchable
[48:04] you see when we look at this
[48:06] satan has given permission
[48:09] to touch he has to get permission to
[48:12] even touch the part of us that is
[48:14] touchable
[48:16] there is a part of us that's touchable
[48:18] that's our flesh
[48:20] it's our mind
[48:22] that's her spirit
[48:24] that's touchable but he still has to get
[48:25] permission
[48:27] he has to get permission of all of our
[48:30] surroundings he had to get permission
[48:32] remember because and i think of and it's
[48:34] not just ministers sometimes the way
[48:35] satan will work i find a lot of times
[48:37] within ministry but you know you you
[48:40] find it how satan if he can't come maybe
[48:44] directly at you or he's not coming at
[48:45] you he gets permission let me touch
[48:47] their child
[48:49] remember sister rebecca the condition as
[48:52] a little girl that she had and that
[48:54] condition where it just couldn't keep
[48:56] anything down it was just the sickness
[48:59] and finally as it as god made it known
[49:01] to his prophet remember brother braham
[49:03] stops the car takes her out and he prays
[49:06] for and never again did she suffer from
[49:08] that
[49:10] see god had permitted that and it was
[49:13] satan that it touched some of his
[49:15] surroundings so sometimes it isn't even
[49:17] satan coming at us as far as in our
[49:20] flesh or in our mind or in our spirit
[49:23] but he'll ask let me touch their
[49:24] surroundings
[49:26] because he believes that if i can do
[49:29] something to affect them i can get them
[49:31] off track
[49:33] i can move them off track but let me say
[49:35] this
[49:36] i i've been mentioning this just as it's
[49:38] burning on my heart
[49:39] god's purpose can't be defeated
[49:43] we might get off track somewhere but
[49:45] there is the grace of god to bring us
[49:47] back on track
[49:49] and grace is given for us to say lord
[49:52] help me and to teach me lord because to
[49:55] realize as long as we're in this life
[49:58] there's going to be times where our
[49:59] surroundings
[50:01] are touched
[50:06] so
[50:08] he can come in any of those areas those
[50:10] are touchable areas but he has to get
[50:12] permission
[50:14] but once the soul is sealed it's an
[50:17] untouchable part let me just say this
[50:20] until a life even is made ready to go
[50:23] soul hasn't been sealed
[50:25] but until that life is made ready to go
[50:27] in the economy of god
[50:29] i don't care how many devils want to
[50:32] come against it it cannot take it until
[50:36] it's ready to go
[50:39] it can't happen
[50:41] because god is in control of it all and
[50:45] god's got a purpose you and i can't
[50:47] always understand or see the purpose in
[50:50] some things
[50:52] sometimes the purpose itself
[50:54] we we
[50:55] we look at purposes and we look at
[50:57] achievement sometimes even in longevity
[51:00] of life sometimes we look at longevity
[51:03] of life or if i can get to retirement
[51:05] and that's an achievement there is an
[51:07] achievement in that but that isn't that
[51:09] in itself is
[51:12] is is is uh subject to the eternal
[51:15] purpose and that is the eternal purpose
[51:18] is serving god's purpose to be filled
[51:21] with the spirit of god and then that
[51:23] life to operate through you and i the
[51:26] purpose that he's called us here for
[51:30] there's a reason
[51:34] there's a reason for all of it i just
[51:36] just trying to go very slow with this
[51:39] so there's a reality let me just deal
[51:41] with that untouchable part
[51:43] the reality
[51:44] that untouchable part
[51:47] is the real you
[51:51] that seed of god that
[51:54] satan wanted there was something about
[51:56] your life that even from the beginning
[51:59] that satan could seek after it to try to
[52:01] destroy it
[52:03] even when he knew what was coming on
[52:05] with moses he sought to destroy and he
[52:08] just said i don't know which one it is
[52:10] we'll just swipe them all out
[52:12] it would have looked like oh my goodness
[52:15] how are they going to make it he just
[52:16] made a blanket statement and we'll just
[52:18] wipe every israelite baby out but it
[52:21] just goes to show god's got a purpose
[52:26] and god himself his purpose will not be
[52:29] defeated
[52:31] but god allowed it to be displayed that
[52:33] in the midst of it all that here moses
[52:36] comes forth in the time of the lord
[52:38] jesus we already knew when you and i can
[52:41] look back and see the prophecies that
[52:43] were already spoken regarding his life
[52:46] and how that their things have
[52:47] transitioned down in egypt and so forth
[52:50] and what was spoken jeremiah regarding
[52:52] rama all of those things that was
[52:54] speaking of that but yet when it came to
[52:57] be notice there was one that was present
[53:00] herod and he was moved at that moment we
[53:04] here a spirit of jealousy just comes
[53:06] upon him and he says there's nobody
[53:09] going to be king but me
[53:11] and here comes another blanket statement
[53:15] just kill all of them from i can't
[53:18] remember the age was it three years and
[53:20] down or
[53:21] two years and down okay so don't don't
[53:23] don't put me out yet two years in doubt
[53:25] i just don't remember that point but at
[53:27] any rate you know this you know that's
[53:29] always the point that also uh
[53:31] validates and puts forth he wasn't a
[53:33] baby when the when the wise men came to
[53:35] him
[53:37] because because the the the description
[53:40] was to put it that it's got to at least
[53:42] be two years old and down when when did
[53:43] this appear to you
[53:45] so when you look at a blanket statement
[53:48] we would look at it and say oh my
[53:49] goodness how is it going to make it now
[53:51] that would be you or i
[53:54] sometimes we don't feel like we're going
[53:55] to make it but let me just assure you
[53:57] you're going to make it
[54:00] there is nothing that can take you or
[54:03] touch you until god's purpose has been
[54:06] fulfilled
[54:10] nothing
[54:11] there's an untouchable part of you and
[54:12] that's that seed of god that gene of god
[54:15] that son and daughter of god that came
[54:17] predestinated from the mind of almighty
[54:20] god that's a part of him it's a part of
[54:22] the word there is a part to be expressed
[54:25] when the bible says he gave unto them
[54:28] power to become the sons of god that
[54:31] phrase become means to come to pass
[54:34] and you were a part of the prophecy that
[54:37] was to come to pass that seed in you is
[54:40] a part of the word that is to come to
[54:42] pass so when the holy spirit has come to
[54:45] your life what is it it's god bringing
[54:48] his word to pass
[54:51] hallelujah
[54:53] so here
[54:54] all of this
[54:55] with the holy spirit moving
[54:58] and directing our lives this is why in
[55:00] job 14 5
[55:03] it says concerning man who's born of a
[55:06] woman is a few days old and full of
[55:07] trouble seeing his days are determined
[55:11] the number of his months
[55:14] are
[55:15] with
[55:16] thee
[55:18] thou has to point at his bounds that he
[55:20] cannot pass i emphasize that the number
[55:24] of his months are with thee
[55:26] with who the lord
[55:29] there's no bartering on that there's no
[55:31] altering on that satan can't say let me
[55:33] just remove a few days in a few months
[55:35] he cannot bark or barter on that
[55:38] god's got a purpose that is to be
[55:40] fulfilled and nothing can thwart that
[55:42] purpose
[55:46] his months are with me thou has to point
[55:48] in his bounds that he cannot pass
[55:50] hallelujah turn from him that he may
[55:52] rest till he shall accomplish as a
[55:54] hireling his day
[55:59] in psalms 34 7 you make maybe just let
[56:01] me read and refer to these places i know
[56:03] we're so you i'm and i'm used to
[56:05] everything moving that's one of the
[56:07] reasons i had them do the scriptures on
[56:09] here i said because on the midweek
[56:11] services i want to move
[56:13] but you can write them down psalms 34 7
[56:16] the angel of the lord encampeth round
[56:18] about them that fear him
[56:20] and delivereth
[56:22] them
[56:25] deliberate ongoing
[56:28] the ongoing delivereth them there's
[56:30] things that you and i have been
[56:31] delivered of no doubt today we're not
[56:33] even aware of it
[56:38] sometimes there's things that can come
[56:39] to your attention and somebody can bring
[56:41] it to your attention say oh you were
[56:42] driving this car like this
[56:44] you didn't want anyone aware of this
[56:46] you were driving this fast and your tie
[56:48] rod was like this
[56:50] tell me somebody because i know i'm
[56:52] preaching i've got some people right
[56:53] here that have told me those testimonies
[56:56] and there's other times that we don't
[56:57] even realize it but it's god delivering
[57:01] us
[57:02] it's not because we're better than
[57:04] nobody else
[57:06] because he can sit in the same church
[57:08] and god delivered you from being in an
[57:10] accident and somebody else was in an
[57:11] accident it isn't god loves one more and
[57:13] one less
[57:14] but god's got a purpose
[57:16] because there's maybe for one hey
[57:18] there's something you need to go do and
[57:20] take care of and god will have somebody
[57:22] else to be a testimony in the midst of
[57:24] it to say that you know what no matter
[57:25] what comes or goes god is still worthy
[57:28] of all my praise
[57:32] the counsel of god is beyond you and i
[57:35] figured out our understanding and
[57:37] putting everything together but i'm just
[57:38] glad that we can just trust him
[57:40] psalms 34 19 many aren't the afflictions
[57:43] of the righteous but the lord
[57:46] delivereth
[57:48] him out of them all
[57:50] ongoing delivereth them out of him all
[57:54] oh my this is why brother braham said
[57:55] after you get past 25 years old
[58:00] i'm 46 how are you
[58:03] 29 how are you
[58:05] don't worry sisters i ain't going to my
[58:07] 24
[58:11] 38 he said 34. you say 34 others said 25
[58:14] i'm going to say jesus forgive him
[58:16] once you get that's 25 years old death
[58:19] sets in
[58:21] wrinkles sets in
[58:23] gray hairs start coming in i would be
[58:25] thankful for them
[58:27] it's going to cause death is after you
[58:32] and one of these days it's going to take
[58:34] you no matter who you are it's going to
[58:37] take you
[58:38] so death doesn't show up and say uh oh
[58:41] they got a good stocks we'll back off
[58:43] from them no debt don't care
[58:47] but notice no matter who you are it's
[58:49] going to take you you'll get in the
[58:51] corner here
[58:52] god will get you out of that corner
[58:54] you'll get in this corner here death
[58:56] will almost have you over here but after
[58:58] a while it'll get you
[59:00] but then what can death do after it
[59:03] takes its full toll
[59:05] and it's done the best it could do
[59:07] god brings you back in the resurrection
[59:09] and he removes everything that death
[59:12] ever set in
[59:15] boo devil
[59:17] hallelujah
[59:18] the only thing death can do he said it
[59:21] because it'll it will pull you into this
[59:24] corner into that corner after a while
[59:25] it's going to take you but that's all it
[59:28] can do
[59:29] paul would write in second corinthians
[59:31] chapter 11 verse 23 he would write in
[59:35] testimony to the corinthian church
[59:38] of letting just not bragging but let
[59:40] them know
[59:42] of everything that has has taken place
[59:44] in order to bring this gospel and he
[59:46] made this statement i was in depths
[59:50] plural oft
[59:53] i was in depth
[59:55] plural
[59:56] oft
[59:59] remember paul writing his conversion
[1:00:02] after he receives the holy ghost in acts
[1:00:04] chapter 9
[1:00:06] he begins to preach the word and all of
[1:00:08] a sudden some of the of the jews were so
[1:00:12] stirred up that they wanted to kill him
[1:00:14] and they purposed in themselves we're
[1:00:17] going to kill this man
[1:00:19] that god
[1:00:20] wasn't finished
[1:00:24] so god i'm just going to say it god
[1:00:27] anointed some men to catch this
[1:00:30] same ears caught this
[1:00:33] can i preach a little bit some ears
[1:00:35] cough is that this department's getting
[1:00:37] ready to shut down you need to build bid
[1:00:40] over to this department come on and
[1:00:41] preach with me now
[1:00:43] you see sometimes we wonder about things
[1:00:45] that we're doing and fail and sometimes
[1:00:47] fail to recognize it's under the
[1:00:49] oversight of almighty god god had people
[1:00:53] catch this and move at that moment and
[1:00:56] paul was let down over a wall in a
[1:00:59] basket
[1:01:01] here's god's mighty prophet being let
[1:01:03] down over the wall in a basket
[1:01:06] but you know what that was the way of
[1:01:07] escape
[1:01:08] right it was a way of escape in that
[1:01:11] moment how was that made possible
[1:01:13] because god's purpose wasn't fulfilled
[1:01:17] and god had everything arranged just
[1:01:19] like god has it arranged that if it
[1:01:21] ain't your time to go don't worry faith
[1:01:23] is coming to bring you out of that
[1:01:25] circumstance
[1:01:28] glory be to god
[1:01:30] oh hallelujah
[1:01:32] notice
[1:01:33] paul would go on in another place here
[1:01:35] he was
[1:01:37] paul was such a loved man that when he
[1:01:38] would come to preach they greet him with
[1:01:40] stones
[1:01:42] so here he is he's being let down by
[1:01:44] basket
[1:01:45] here in paul is in another place he's
[1:01:48] drug out of the city and stoned to death
[1:01:52] now think about when he's heading to
[1:01:53] that place he knows the results from
[1:01:55] being stoned
[1:01:56] because he has held the coats
[1:02:00] of others while they did it
[1:02:04] right if there was one thing about it
[1:02:07] there were some professional stone
[1:02:08] throwers in that day too
[1:02:14] he was left for dead now you let's look
[1:02:17] at it just a moment
[1:02:19] paul could have had he could have had a
[1:02:21] right
[1:02:22] for his life to draw back and go back in
[1:02:24] a cave and say i ain't going nowhere
[1:02:28] i don't know what's out here man they
[1:02:30] might kill me the next place i go
[1:02:32] you think those thoughts didn't come
[1:02:35] you think those thoughts didn't come
[1:02:37] holy if this happens it might kill me
[1:02:39] this might take me this might this and
[1:02:41] this man all those things were all
[1:02:43] around but paul also you can read this
[1:02:45] clearly what paul writes he writes by a
[1:02:48] divine expression that when he could say
[1:02:51] oh death where is thy victory it wasn't
[1:02:54] just at that moment
[1:02:56] paul lived with that reality because he
[1:02:58] knew by being in the predestinated plan
[1:03:01] of god
[1:03:02] nothing can take me until god is
[1:03:06] finished
[1:03:07] it didn't cause him to be arrogant what
[1:03:10] it did it brought a rest
[1:03:15] it brought a rest
[1:03:18] paul could write in second corinthians
[1:03:20] chapter 1
[1:03:23] when he writes concerning the pressure
[1:03:24] that had come
[1:03:26] to them when they were in asia in second
[1:03:28] corinthians 1 and verse 8 brethren we
[1:03:30] will not have you ignorant of our
[1:03:31] trouble which came to us in asia
[1:03:34] that we were pressed out of measure
[1:03:36] above strength in so much that we
[1:03:39] despaired
[1:03:40] even of life
[1:03:42] but we have the sentence of death
[1:03:46] in ourselves
[1:03:47] that we should not trust in ourselves
[1:03:51] but in god which raiseth the dead
[1:03:55] now watch this what's this application
[1:03:57] paul knows that god is the one who
[1:03:59] raises the dead not because of just a
[1:04:01] historical event paul has experienced
[1:04:04] this same resurrection in his own life
[1:04:06] so paul knows that it's god who raises
[1:04:09] the dead now watch it come down into
[1:04:11] this place right here why did god raise
[1:04:14] you me who were dead in sin and
[1:04:16] trespasses because god had a purpose
[1:04:20] it wasn't that we became seed we always
[1:04:23] were seed of god and god had a purpose
[1:04:26] to raise us up
[1:04:28] and paul is cooperating by that in the
[1:04:31] midst of all of the environment and all
[1:04:34] that pulls around let me tell you it
[1:04:35] wasn't a comfortable place it was a
[1:04:37] hostile time in many of those cities
[1:04:40] think about even when paul no doubt he
[1:04:42] wanted to get out of corinth but god
[1:04:44] told him fear not stay right here i got
[1:04:47] much people in this city
[1:04:50] right there was lives that needed to be
[1:04:53] quickened by the spirit of god they had
[1:04:55] to hear that gospel trumpet sound they
[1:04:57] had to receive that word of
[1:04:59] reconciliation they had to receive that
[1:05:02] reality of the atonement that i was
[1:05:04] included in redemption
[1:05:07] and because of that reality god which
[1:05:09] raised up the dead verse 10 paul could
[1:05:11] say who delivered us from so great a
[1:05:15] death
[1:05:16] and doth deliver
[1:05:18] in whom we trust that he will yet
[1:05:22] deliver us
[1:05:25] glory be to god delivered over and over
[1:05:28] again
[1:05:29] this is why the scripture when it could
[1:05:31] say in ecclesiastes 8 8
[1:05:34] there is no man that hath power over the
[1:05:36] spirit to retain the spirit neither hath
[1:05:39] he power
[1:05:40] in the day of death
[1:05:43] brother brown says it like this i just
[1:05:46] these things are so burning on my heart
[1:05:48] here for these times but i was talking
[1:05:50] about healing
[1:05:54] and he goes through
[1:05:56] all of this with healing and how that
[1:05:58] healing is of god he talks about where
[1:05:59] doctors have their parts and all those
[1:06:02] things and he says
[1:06:03] god alone has purchased for us our heal
[1:06:06] it's up to us to do everything that we
[1:06:08] can in our life and in every way that
[1:06:10] god has given us for our healing
[1:06:12] but it's god that heals
[1:06:14] so notice brother branham because
[1:06:15] brother brahm you you know this by now
[1:06:17] brother brown was number one who taught
[1:06:18] against doctors neither did brother
[1:06:20] branham teach the doctors and surgeons
[1:06:22] surgeries and medicines that that's for
[1:06:24] the weaker faith brother brahman never
[1:06:26] made that difference
[1:06:27] that's men's traditions from
[1:06:28] denominations that have tried to come in
[1:06:32] but to recognize it doesn't matter if
[1:06:34] it's surgery medicine it doesn't matter
[1:06:36] if you're standing here the matter
[1:06:38] all healing comes from god
[1:06:42] and i'll tell you if i had to go through
[1:06:44] surgery or you or anybody else is just
[1:06:46] as glorious as standing right here
[1:06:48] as a matter of fact brother branham
[1:06:49] tells us in the message that he preaches
[1:06:51] in erie pennsylvania it takes greater
[1:06:54] faith
[1:06:55] for that endurance over the long haul
[1:06:57] than it does for a miracle
[1:07:00] because over the long haul guess what
[1:07:02] you're going to have the oh really
[1:07:04] you're going to have a baby
[1:07:05] are you buying diapers for abraham
[1:07:08] you guys know this is not possible
[1:07:12] that's why it takes greater faith it
[1:07:13] takes greater faith to take a promise
[1:07:15] and say god said so
[1:07:17] and walk with all sorts of things around
[1:07:20] us but see our way of thinking about it
[1:07:23] is that the miracle is greater but it's
[1:07:25] all a
[1:07:26] miracle it's a miracle day by day that
[1:07:29] you can stand right there with the
[1:07:31] promise of god and say god's word is
[1:07:33] true i don't care how i feel i don't
[1:07:34] care what thoughts are coming through
[1:07:36] god's word is true and what god has said
[1:07:38] he will fulfill
[1:07:40] though i don't see it he's working
[1:07:45] now notice brother braham says this if
[1:07:47] god calls you home tonight
[1:07:51] there isn't enough medicine in the world
[1:07:52] that'll keep you here
[1:07:59] can i read that again
[1:08:00] if god calls you home tonight there
[1:08:03] isn't enough medicine in the world we'll
[1:08:04] keep you here
[1:08:06] there is nothing going to keep you here
[1:08:09] and if he determines if he determines
[1:08:12] you to stay on earth no matter how many
[1:08:14] physicians says you're going you're
[1:08:17] dying you're not going
[1:08:19] it's all up to god
[1:08:22] see sometimes we get so fast with things
[1:08:25] instead of recognizing it's god in
[1:08:28] control
[1:08:29] oh of that doctor this this church and
[1:08:31] this and this this and this who's above
[1:08:33] all of that
[1:08:35] the devil
[1:08:37] is above it all
[1:08:40] when i when you
[1:08:41] no matter who it is go into anything we
[1:08:43] are looking for god to be present there
[1:08:46] the doctor is not the final word he is
[1:08:49] not the amen of god the amen of god is
[1:08:51] the amen of god it's jesus christ
[1:08:58] hallelujah
[1:09:01] brother brown let me go on now it's
[1:09:03] those crucial hours that press us under
[1:09:05] those sacred sands
[1:09:07] it wasn't the bible and remember no
[1:09:09] matter how great the distress is
[1:09:13] satan cannot take your life until god
[1:09:16] has finished with you
[1:09:19] there's nothing can happen to you unless
[1:09:21] god permits it there is no evil can come
[1:09:24] unless god permits it and it's for your
[1:09:26] good he is working that
[1:09:31] the flood
[1:09:32] couldn't destroy
[1:09:34] no
[1:09:37] because noah had a purpose to serve
[1:09:42] the lion
[1:09:43] the big kitty cats would mean
[1:09:48] could not destroy
[1:09:50] daniel
[1:09:52] because there was a purpose to be
[1:09:53] fulfilled
[1:09:57] the fire could not destroy the hebrew
[1:10:00] children there was a purpose to be
[1:10:02] fulfilled
[1:10:08] god's purpose can't be defeated
[1:10:10] i would say god if you just help us all
[1:10:13] of us
[1:10:14] resting within that reality because
[1:10:18] who was it that came in the lion's den
[1:10:21] the reason the angel of the lord came as
[1:10:24] he did as a deliverer that night was
[1:10:27] because
[1:10:28] daniel's purpose was not fulfilled
[1:10:32] if daniel's purpose oh i can't dwell on
[1:10:34] this tonight but if daniel's purpose had
[1:10:36] been fulfilled the angel the lord would
[1:10:39] have still been there for he is the
[1:10:41] light to guide me through the valley of
[1:10:43] the shadow of death
[1:10:47] hallelujah glory be to god in the
[1:10:49] highest
[1:10:51] it couldn't do anything because there
[1:10:53] was a work for him to do brother brown
[1:10:55] said now we don't want to be mistaken
[1:10:56] satan has a has a power
[1:10:59] satan has a power and that power is
[1:11:01] death
[1:11:02] satan is the one who takes your life
[1:11:04] when god will let him
[1:11:07] do it
[1:11:08] but god can hold your life
[1:11:11] and satan can't take it until god lets
[1:11:13] him
[1:11:14] do it
[1:11:16] he can only use that power
[1:11:18] as god will let him use it
[1:11:24] i'm just trying to stay on this tonight
[1:11:25] and not get hit
[1:11:27] he can only use that power as god will
[1:11:30] let him use it you know
[1:11:32] that's why they said you know what death
[1:11:33] is it's god harness death up to a bug
[1:11:37] and the only thing death can do is pull
[1:11:39] the believer in the presence of his
[1:11:41] maker
[1:11:42] brother brown said hey it ain't a bad
[1:11:44] thing after all he said i wouldn't want
[1:11:46] to live in this old guest house all the
[1:11:48] time
[1:11:56] remember and paul standing here just
[1:11:58] just throwing these examples
[1:12:00] here's paul
[1:12:02] he's
[1:12:03] you know been brought in
[1:12:05] you know what accused him of being a
[1:12:07] rebel rouser
[1:12:10] and here he stands there
[1:12:12] in that whole division between sadducees
[1:12:14] and pharisees in acts 23
[1:12:17] and uh you know between
[1:12:19] the nia high priest he's there and so
[1:12:21] forth but after when god has
[1:12:25] remember there was men that was sent to
[1:12:26] take paul
[1:12:28] and bring paul out of that mess that was
[1:12:30] going on there with the with the
[1:12:32] pharisees and sadducees and
[1:12:34] and they they brought him there to
[1:12:35] safety but that night god spoke to paul
[1:12:38] and he told paul
[1:12:40] be a good cheer
[1:12:42] paul
[1:12:42] for as thou has testified of me in
[1:12:45] jerusalem
[1:12:46] so must thou bear witness also
[1:12:49] at wrong
[1:12:50] now god tells him in the midst of
[1:12:52] conflict
[1:12:54] god doesn't tell him the conflict's
[1:12:56] going to go away but he lets him know be
[1:12:58] of good cheer
[1:12:59] because what you what's been done here
[1:13:01] in jerusalem i'm taking you to rome so
[1:13:03] that you can testify in rome as well
[1:13:05] god doesn't need to let him know i'm
[1:13:07] going to remove everything here i'm
[1:13:08] going to take away trouble there i'm
[1:13:09] going to no no god just lets him know
[1:13:12] gives him that that word and lets him
[1:13:14] know hey i'm not finished yet
[1:13:18] i'm not finished yet all right
[1:13:24] oh lord have mercy
[1:13:28] think of this now paul here he goes and
[1:13:31] remember you remember even after this
[1:13:33] particular moment when this was made
[1:13:35] known to paul by the lord remember there
[1:13:38] was also men once again right here in
[1:13:39] this same chapter that were conspiring
[1:13:41] against paul they were waiting
[1:13:44] when this guy walks out the city we're
[1:13:46] getting him
[1:13:48] right they already had they had the mob
[1:13:50] set up they were ready they had men that
[1:13:52] were planted
[1:13:54] but
[1:13:55] the purpose wasn't fulfilled
[1:13:58] and god let it be
[1:14:01] that there was one who was there
[1:14:04] that heard overheard this discussion
[1:14:07] passed it on to the young man her son
[1:14:10] and he went and he told the keeper of
[1:14:12] the garden they passed it on and then
[1:14:14] they got paul out even the time of the
[1:14:15] day you say how was that done you said
[1:14:18] samuel these are people that were
[1:14:19] getting him out that were not believers
[1:14:21] but it was all in the hand of god
[1:14:24] god will have people sometimes you were
[1:14:26] looking remember god can come in many
[1:14:28] different forms
[1:14:30] the bible said be not forgetful
[1:14:35] to entertain strangers
[1:14:37] for some have entertained angels
[1:14:39] unawares
[1:14:43] hallelujah
[1:14:45] glory be to god
[1:14:46] i've been the way god will come and god
[1:14:49] is letting you and i know what it what
[1:14:50] is it all about it's not about you or me
[1:14:53] it's god what's he doing all of that
[1:14:55] when god would say about your job or
[1:14:57] this or that it's god whole thing
[1:15:00] letting you and i know i've got this
[1:15:04] i've got it covered you don't have to
[1:15:06] worry about it your life is in my hands
[1:15:08] i just want you to serve my purpose
[1:15:12] what a rest that brings to our lives
[1:15:20] so paul after this he's delivered once
[1:15:23] again
[1:15:24] now here they are on the way to rome
[1:15:28] and you know remember the account in
[1:15:29] acts 27 here they come sailing and they
[1:15:32] come to a place uh the fair i can't
[1:15:34] remember fair havens they shouldn't have
[1:15:36] left there paul told him he don't leave
[1:15:39] here
[1:15:40] don't leave here there's going to be bad
[1:15:42] things coming down the road don't leave
[1:15:43] here
[1:15:44] he was a prisoner on the ship
[1:15:47] but
[1:15:48] the centurion listened to the ship
[1:15:52] master and captain
[1:15:54] before he listened to paul but we could
[1:15:56] preach on that while but
[1:15:58] at any rate
[1:16:00] they loose
[1:16:02] and then hear that great wind that comes
[1:16:04] up like a typhoon is how they describe
[1:16:06] it
[1:16:07] and to notice that within that here the
[1:16:11] people are you know they're throwing
[1:16:12] things overboard they're lightening the
[1:16:14] load and all that but paul
[1:16:16] here he is
[1:16:17] that whole
[1:16:19] is paul god bringing paul to rome
[1:16:24] if i can say it like this if there was
[1:16:26] one ship to be on buddy that's a ship
[1:16:28] you want to be on
[1:16:32] you wanted to be on that ship you know
[1:16:33] why
[1:16:35] oh i know they said the titanic was
[1:16:36] unsinkable
[1:16:39] i know they said it but man said that
[1:16:44] man said that in his bragging and his
[1:16:46] post
[1:16:49] but when god's in the boat
[1:16:53] it ain't going down
[1:16:56] we're going to the other side
[1:16:58] oh we could preach right now
[1:17:00] this message ain't defeated
[1:17:05] this word is not defeated we're going to
[1:17:07] the other side
[1:17:10] amen your walk with god he's not
[1:17:12] defeated we're going to the other side
[1:17:16] we might have to throw out some things
[1:17:18] out of our life that are weighing us
[1:17:19] down in the midst of a storm that's a
[1:17:22] time to evaluate and say really don't
[1:17:25] need this really don't need that really
[1:17:27] don't need this really don't need that a
[1:17:29] storm brings evaluation
[1:17:33] glory to god he brings evaluation to
[1:17:37] what's really important
[1:17:42] and the angel of the lord shows up to
[1:17:44] paul
[1:17:45] paul
[1:17:47] be of good cheer
[1:17:49] fear not
[1:17:51] verse 24 for thou must be brought before
[1:17:54] caesar and lo god hath given thee all
[1:17:58] them
[1:17:59] that sail with thee
[1:18:03] they may not be serving him i mean they
[1:18:04] may not be in the ship right now but god
[1:18:07] has given all
[1:18:09] that sale with thee
[1:18:12] the word of god is so precious isn't it
[1:18:14] i love when he comes on it and just
[1:18:16] starts putting that bow on that violin
[1:18:18] and just starts stroking there and
[1:18:20] bringing out the promises and the
[1:18:22] reality of god
[1:18:24] hallelujah be of good cheers my brethren
[1:18:28] for i believe god that it shall be even
[1:18:30] as it was told
[1:18:36] what they got to do paul just stay in
[1:18:37] the ship
[1:18:40] now the ship was gonna it suffered a
[1:18:42] breakup
[1:18:44] right
[1:18:45] the ship suffered a breakup
[1:18:48] but no lives were lost
[1:18:53] the ship was touched
[1:18:55] but nobody's life was touched
[1:18:58] it don't say that these men who were
[1:18:59] with him went on and served god you
[1:19:02] would think
[1:19:03] here's a man that has just said that the
[1:19:06] angel of the lord came to me and i don't
[1:19:08] believe it was just words
[1:19:10] if when paul said it there would have
[1:19:12] been an identity you know there was
[1:19:13] something there was a presence on this
[1:19:15] boat last night
[1:19:17] come on somebody
[1:19:20] and here they were they make it to an
[1:19:23] island
[1:19:24] no surprise it's what god had said
[1:19:29] i wonder
[1:19:30] how the thoughts and things would have
[1:19:32] come to their mind
[1:19:33] even thoughts would have tried to come
[1:19:35] to paul's mind
[1:19:36] and then
[1:19:37] here is paul
[1:19:39] getting wood on the island of moline all
[1:19:42] part of this journey
[1:19:44] reaches in to get
[1:19:46] wood to help out with the fire
[1:19:50] a viper
[1:19:51] latches on not just anybody this wasn't
[1:19:53] a garden snake
[1:19:57] this was a vibe
[1:20:00] deadly viper as a matter of fact they
[1:20:01] were waiting for paul to fall over dead
[1:20:05] but do you realize
[1:20:06] unless god would have given permission
[1:20:09] that viper would have had to sit right
[1:20:10] there while paul wretched
[1:20:14] are you with me but god gave permission
[1:20:16] you know why god said i got some people
[1:20:19] here on this island and they need to see
[1:20:22] something more than a man
[1:20:30] you're an actress oh my gosh he's been
[1:20:33] bit by a snake oh
[1:20:35] he's been bit by a snake oh you've been
[1:20:37] bit by a snake quick quick quick he's
[1:20:39] been bit by a snake and god said i've
[1:20:41] got this
[1:20:47] i got this
[1:20:49] you know why
[1:20:51] because god's purpose can't be defeated
[1:20:54] but wasn't a snake handler he just was
[1:20:57] doing what god told him to do and satan
[1:20:59] got permission and that vapor struck out
[1:21:02] but
[1:21:05] it couldn't take his life
[1:21:11] but the same wonder what kind of
[1:21:13] anti-venom that
[1:21:17] i see every drug company and everything
[1:21:19] would like to get a hold of that they
[1:21:21] might start writing shots out of it
[1:21:25] but you see god has everything under his
[1:21:28] control
[1:21:29] as i bring this down here think about
[1:21:31] brother branham
[1:21:33] he wants that
[1:21:35] weatherby magnum rifle
[1:21:37] right
[1:21:38] one brother said he can get it bored for
[1:21:39] him just the right way
[1:21:41] brother branham and he preaches a
[1:21:43] message out of this letting off the
[1:21:44] pressure
[1:21:45] dumb devil
[1:21:47] dumb devil
[1:21:48] brother brandon brought examples out of
[1:21:50] that message it was so powerful out of
[1:21:52] that i mean out of that experience
[1:21:54] because when he's shooting that rifle
[1:21:58] it was a i went into what what
[1:21:59] winchester and him had said it was 6 900
[1:22:02] pounds of pressure
[1:22:04] that's going off when that shot is fired
[1:22:06] the bolt brother tells us the bolt went
[1:22:09] flew behind him and went clear down to
[1:22:11] the deer conservation floor
[1:22:14] it blew apart
[1:22:17] his head shouldn't have been on his body
[1:22:20] are you hearing me
[1:22:21] it shouldn't have been on his body this
[1:22:23] wasn't a cat gun
[1:22:25] it was an explosion
[1:22:28] but you know what brother randy tells us
[1:22:29] about it he said satan i've realized he
[1:22:33] said i'm standing here tonight and he
[1:22:34] said boy it's good to be here he said
[1:22:36] well i realize this satan tried to kill
[1:22:38] me but he can't
[1:22:41] he can't do it until god is finished
[1:22:44] with me and he said when he's finished
[1:22:47] i'm ready to go
[1:22:52] lord be to god you know why because
[1:22:54] we've been made a possessor of death
[1:22:57] he have freely given us all things
[1:23:01] and brother branham ties it in and he
[1:23:03] ties that in and says death is given to
[1:23:05] the believer because we're not under
[1:23:08] death
[1:23:08] but death is servant to us it's not us
[1:23:12] saying death get back but we are serving
[1:23:15] the purpose of god and until that
[1:23:18] purpose is served death can't touch us
[1:23:23] i could read you the quote right here
[1:23:24] tonight he said even death we possess
[1:23:26] death he said possess death brother
[1:23:28] branham brother said well glory i don't
[1:23:31] forgot about the explosion of the gun
[1:23:34] why didn't why didn't he kill me because
[1:23:36] he couldn't
[1:23:37] god wasn't ready see any brother brandon
[1:23:39] made me brother brown's not saying i'm
[1:23:41] untouchable
[1:23:43] i'm a believer
[1:23:44] you know a believer can't get sick what
[1:23:48] like some nonsense well if you're a real
[1:23:50] believer you'll not get coveted
[1:23:53] really
[1:23:55] let me know let me let me know when you
[1:23:56] get it
[1:23:58] because your flesh is no different than
[1:24:00] anybody else's flesh
[1:24:02] are you hearing me friends
[1:24:04] it's no different than anybody else even
[1:24:07] in the spirit do you realize brother
[1:24:09] braham said that a person can be totally
[1:24:12] insane in their mind and yet sealed with
[1:24:15] the holy ghost
[1:24:17] what is it an affliction in their mind
[1:24:20] mentally
[1:24:22] are you hearing me
[1:24:24] this is why satan can come with
[1:24:26] depression he can come with anxiety he
[1:24:28] has to get permission
[1:24:31] it isn't that oh well somebody's so weak
[1:24:34] it ain't that it's satan has to get
[1:24:36] permission and the devil will exploit
[1:24:39] situations
[1:24:42] not gonna go there tonight
[1:24:44] but god is still a deliverer
[1:24:51] so the untouchable part
[1:24:53] is that of the soul
[1:24:55] and we're here until that purpose is
[1:24:57] fulfilled when the purpose is fulfilled
[1:25:00] then comes down radio from on high
[1:25:03] mission completed come home
[1:25:06] and like enoch
[1:25:08] we walk home
[1:25:13] hallelujah he said god wasn't ready he
[1:25:16] said he could come as much as he want to
[1:25:18] talking about satan he could come as
[1:25:19] much as he want to but he can't
[1:25:21] take
[1:25:24] because death on the grave's already
[1:25:26] been conquered
[1:25:28] think of the lord jesus
[1:25:32] then in pilots hall
[1:25:35] pilot you know pilate has a position on
[1:25:37] earth
[1:25:40] don't you know i have power to release
[1:25:42] you
[1:25:44] jesus standing there
[1:25:46] here's the work of election and
[1:25:47] predestination where it's working at
[1:25:49] quickening power it's a rest in his life
[1:25:52] he knows because you know why they tried
[1:25:54] to take him many other times and they
[1:25:55] couldn't take him
[1:25:57] because his time hadn't come yet
[1:25:59] are you with me in a corner got out of
[1:26:01] it in a corner got it you had to be
[1:26:03] fulfilled and here is jesus standing not
[1:26:05] arrogant as a believer we're not
[1:26:07] arrogant it's a rest to us
[1:26:10] that jesus could say you should have no
[1:26:13] power over me
[1:26:15] unless it was given to
[1:26:17] from
[1:26:20] above here was one
[1:26:22] [Music]
[1:26:24] that was able to express
[1:26:26] that authority that was
[1:26:28] to be delivered to the sons and
[1:26:30] daughters of god and understanding
[1:26:31] because they didn't have that
[1:26:33] understanding before
[1:26:35] but this understanding has come by a
[1:26:36] living reality
[1:26:38] that you could have no power unless it's
[1:26:40] given
[1:26:42] satan can't touch it unless he's given
[1:26:43] to you this is why satan would love to
[1:26:45] bring and
[1:26:47] that's why he likes to try to bring us
[1:26:48] to worry
[1:26:51] worry's not from your soul
[1:26:54] worries you get a thought in here oh
[1:26:56] this is going to be
[1:26:58] could this be and could that be and we
[1:27:01] can get to thinking about those women
[1:27:03] now listen let me just stop here without
[1:27:05] i don't want to preach them because
[1:27:07] sometimes we can say ah brother brian
[1:27:09] don't worry let me pull your strings on
[1:27:11] the things that you worry
[1:27:13] don't go around here higher mighty don't
[1:27:15] worry don't worry let me pull the
[1:27:17] strings on things that you worry about
[1:27:18] because there's things that you can get
[1:27:20] worried about
[1:27:21] oh have faith we could tell you the same
[1:27:23] thing have faith in the midst of that
[1:27:25] time you see god knows we're all made up
[1:27:28] in a certain way and there's certain
[1:27:29] things that can come to you and i we
[1:27:32] should encourage one another but every
[1:27:34] one of us
[1:27:35] every one of us experience those things
[1:27:37] from time to time
[1:27:39] but god
[1:27:40] delivers us
[1:27:42] no doubt i'm right here standing before
[1:27:44] people right here tonight that you've
[1:27:46] been delivered right here in service
[1:27:49] you've been delivered right now during
[1:27:50] this day
[1:27:52] there's things that god has delivered
[1:27:53] you may not have been a sickness but it
[1:27:55] might have been tormented in your mind
[1:27:56] it might have been something in your
[1:27:57] spirit it god couldn't write even in
[1:27:59] your body things that can be delivered
[1:28:03] glory be to god
[1:28:06] oh hallelujah don't you love him
[1:28:11] notice when paul could
[1:28:12] announce the time
[1:28:15] i depart
[1:28:19] not at this very moment
[1:28:21] but at hand at hand means i'm aware it's

[1:28:47] see
[1:28:48] of what was coming even down the road
[1:28:51] and so you know god has a way of
[1:28:52] preparing us
[1:28:54] god has a way of preparing us
[1:28:57] sometimes we don't even realize and it
[1:28:59] isn't always an age you understand me it

[1:30:39] 1999 a february
[1:30:42] he goes to have a heart cast on it
[1:30:44] and as he and they're going into it
[1:30:46] finally they come down to a little room
[1:30:47] where we're sitting
[1:30:49] something's going on
[1:30:51] something's going his body's filling
[1:30:53] number one
[1:30:54] walking around
[1:30:58] we begin to pray there in that room
[1:31:01] mall browning was there
[1:31:03] um
[1:31:04] like
[1:31:06] catholic priests in there too
[1:31:09] same you little catholic real sure we'll
[1:31:11] take all the first we can get
[1:31:17] but we're sitting there praying
[1:31:19] and my dad had just been preaching a
[1:31:20] series
[1:31:21] in the midweek services of
[1:31:25] behold it is on me
[1:31:28] let's begin to pray
[1:31:30] that came out
[1:31:32] that statement came out about that time
[1:31:34] just as i'm sitting in my into your leg
[1:31:36] your trouser legs are like this and all
[1:31:38] of a sudden i just felt the freezer
[1:31:42] and dad was at the end of the hall down
[1:31:43] there we were in a little room
[1:31:45] but then about five minutes or so they
[1:31:47] come back and
[1:31:48] say hey
[1:31:50] i don't know what happened
[1:31:51] but everything's good
[1:31:52] we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna let
[1:31:54] you come back and see him right now that
[1:31:55] we're gonna go ahead with the heart cath
[1:31:56] go from there
[1:31:58] when we went down to see my dad
[1:32:00] my dad said and begin to talk to him
[1:32:04] and he said
[1:32:06] where were you sitting
[1:32:08] he said well we were setting get down
[1:32:09] the hallway he was laying on the table
[1:32:10] like this we said we were out this whole
[1:32:12] way right down there to that little room
[1:32:14] he said that's the direction he came
[1:32:18] he said it was like brother bradham
[1:32:19] describes he said that death he said is
[1:32:21] a fog that fog was rolling in a thumb
[1:32:24] he said but when he came he said he came
[1:32:26] walking from that way
[1:32:28] and he said he walked in and said
[1:32:31] you're going back
[1:32:32] because your work
[1:32:34] is not finished
[1:32:37] and the wall death had to let go
[1:32:44] i thought you know
[1:32:45] just so many different examples even
[1:32:47] right here in the congregation of things
[1:32:50] that how
[1:32:52] right here we're live
[1:32:54] by accident or others i could go on and
[1:32:57] on
[1:32:58] but nothing
[1:33:00] been taken
[1:33:02] until god is fine
[1:33:05] nothing
[1:33:06] can take us into a goddess family
[1:33:09] but there's one thing we can take from
[1:33:11] there
[1:33:12] the reason i i looked at this and i
[1:33:14] thought just how's god was bringing this
[1:33:15] to me even over a week of going so
[1:33:18] this began i was kept on meditating on
[1:33:20] these things and looking at it putting
[1:33:22] it putting things down as it's coming to
[1:33:23] me
[1:33:24] jesus was so pulsing anymore i said god
[1:33:27] if we can all take a hold of this
[1:33:29] that's perfect love that drives home
[1:33:33] it drives out the fear satan's business
[1:33:37] is to try to bring fear and worry matter
[1:33:39] of fact brother brown says that's what
[1:33:40] his imps
[1:33:42] do
[1:33:43] is bring fear worry and disease
[1:33:47] but god's army
[1:33:49] cast them out
[1:33:51] so they're going to come but we're
[1:33:52] anointed to cast them out
[1:33:54] satan gets permission
[1:33:56] but we're anointed to cast them up
[1:34:00] and there's not one not one blade of
[1:34:02] grass and satan time
[1:34:06] unless he gets permission
[1:34:11] what a rest
[1:34:12] that god help us to operate in that rest
[1:34:15] to operate in this time even that where
[1:34:18] we've been lit there's a rest you're not
[1:34:19] going anywhere i'm not going anywhere
[1:34:21] there's no such thing as oh brother
[1:34:23] so-and-so would have been here but they
[1:34:24] were so ignorant about this nonsense
[1:34:28] you're not going anywhere until god's
[1:34:30] finished
[1:34:32] are you hearing me oh brother samuel i
[1:34:34] know so-and-so committed suicide brother
[1:34:36] branham tried to twice
[1:34:40] he grabbed a hold of the electrical line
[1:34:42] guess what it wasn't his time to go
[1:34:46] it doesn't you understand we're not
[1:34:48] taking these things lightly but when
[1:34:50] recognizing that if it's god's purpose
[1:34:52] for you and i to be here no matter what
[1:34:54] condition you're in god is going to
[1:34:56] anoint your faith get ready for
[1:34:59] deliverance
[1:35:02] because he delivers and delivers and
[1:35:04] delivers
[1:35:06] and that's why no matter what it is
[1:35:08] expect and look for deliverance
[1:35:12] because god is a god who delivers
[1:35:15] what a rest
[1:35:17] one of the greatest deliverances is a
[1:35:19] deliverance from worry
[1:35:21] deliverance from fear that recognize you
[1:35:23] know what god's got this in his hands
[1:35:26] hallelujah oh my i remember even my wife
[1:35:29] and i were going you know to have
[1:35:31] children and things like that and how
[1:35:32] the enemy wanted to try to different
[1:35:34] times try to come and get in my mind
[1:35:36] about different things in our mind and
[1:35:37] try to say this but thanks be to god
[1:35:39] god's a deliverer
[1:35:42] i said god's a deliverer
[1:35:44] he can try to come in any way to get
[1:35:46] your mind tangled up to where we become
[1:35:48] occupied with this
[1:35:51] we become occupied but to realize
[1:35:53] nothing
[1:35:55] nothing
[1:35:56] can stop god's purpose
[1:36:01] paul's not on the other side and the
[1:36:02] rest of them say ah
[1:36:04] paul shouldn't have said what he said
[1:36:05] did what he did he went too early no he
[1:36:07] went right in the time of god
[1:36:11] oh elijah shouldn't no no in right in
[1:36:14] the time of god see you and i look at
[1:36:16] things like that oh brother so-and-so oh
[1:36:18] such a so-and-so oh you know how they
[1:36:19] are you know how this wait a minute
[1:36:21] it didn't matter oh how they are they're
[1:36:23] not going anywhere unless god's purpose
[1:36:26] has been fulfilled
[1:36:31] oh
[1:36:32] we can rest these are not just these are
[1:36:34] not brother samuel's words this is the
[1:36:35] word of the law
[1:36:37] we can rest nothing
[1:36:39] can come our way unless god permits it
[1:36:42] and if god permits it he's there to
[1:36:43] deliver
[1:36:46] god help us like they did on the ship
[1:36:48] throw out things that are unnecessary in
[1:36:49] that time let it be a time of evaluation

[1:39:28] let's just stand if we could
[1:39:31] amen
[1:39:35] i know it's things that we
[1:39:37] already know but like peter said there's
[1:39:40] as long as i'm with you to stir up your
[1:39:42] pure mind by way of remembrance
[1:39:44] sometimes it's not just even that the
[1:39:46] statements of and we're not going
[1:39:47] anywhere until god's purpose is finished
[1:39:49] but i think the other part is as i said
[1:39:50] that sometimes we're always looking out
[1:39:52] of oh if you know the doctor hadn't done
[1:39:55] this and the doctor hadn't done this and
[1:39:56] this and that
[1:39:58] nobody's going anywhere unless the
[1:40:00] purpose of god is painful
[1:40:03] nothing
[1:40:04] and that's a rest that it brings to us
[1:40:06] because that rest is him
[1:40:09] it's in him
[1:40:11] we're here
[1:40:12] for a purpose
[1:40:14] that word is to be fulfilled in our life
[1:40:18] you may not be a preacher you don't have
[1:40:19] to be you just
[1:40:21] you you're still the word you're just as
[1:40:24] much the word as the preacher would be
[1:40:25] the book you're no less
[1:40:27] god has a purpose in what he's doing
[1:40:29] our lives it's it's christ being
[1:40:32] reflected in our lives
[1:40:34] it's him making contact
[1:40:37] with his people
[1:40:39] and i'm just i'm so grateful i'm just so
[1:40:41] thankful just just taking this in just
[1:40:43] even today just thinking upon us oh god
[1:40:46] thank you lord
[1:40:47] once again it shows the predestinated
[1:40:51] plan of almighty god
[1:40:57] no doubt like i said we could go through
[1:40:59] this maybe you have no doubt personal
[1:41:01] testimonies loved ones father mother so
[1:41:04] we could probably
[1:41:05] maybe we share some of that on sunday
[1:41:06] evening i i don't know but i know beyond
[1:41:09] the shadow but that we have
[1:41:11] testimonies here that we could say if it
[1:41:14] hadn't
[1:41:16] been for the mercy of god
[1:41:19] and i would not be
[1:41:22] but god has you here
[1:41:24] for a reason
[1:41:26] so if god spares your life it isn't that
[1:41:28] he's giving you more life
[1:41:30] god spares your life and you're still
[1:41:32] here
[1:41:33] to serve his purpose
[1:41:35] so if it can't take me until his purpose
[1:41:36] is served if i'm still here i said lord
[1:41:39] what would you have me do this moment
[1:41:41] what would you have me do today because
[1:41:42] i'm not just here just on to take up
[1:41:45] time
[1:41:46] every moment is precious because your
[1:41:49] purpose is precious
[1:41:53] if you're loving
[1:41:55] the brain
[1:41:59] can we just wash it in just a few
[1:42:00] moments
[1:42:01] and then just give him thanks
[1:42:06] we are often tossed and driven
[1:42:10] on the rest the sea of time
[1:42:14] somber skies and howling tempest
[1:42:18] off succeed a bright sunshine
[1:42:22] in that land of perfect day
