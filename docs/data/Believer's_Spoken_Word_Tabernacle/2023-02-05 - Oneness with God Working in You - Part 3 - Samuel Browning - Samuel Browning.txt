amen um I believe it's f ancy hey man uh just real quick before we sing the stone cold for the same I wanted to just a quick announcement Brandon go ahead and show the so I don't know if you all have seen this before if you ever come into church uh if you're coming to church early you guys know how we have the board out there that has the normally it just shows the uh weather coming up for the weekend uh because it's been a while since we've been able to keep it up to date uh and it would show announcements from like two years ago you know hey brother Jerry's coming to visit us two years ago so it was not very useful so most people probably been ignoring it and the announcement's up here but I've got a new hiring I'm not going to mention who it is I got a new hirie who's helping me keep this up to date so if you come into church early um if we're not playing like a quote or something you'll you'll be able to see this on the board so we're going to be keeping this up to date more now going into the future and also of course you can still look and they usually have in the bathroom they have a a sheet lined up where you can see all the upcoming Stuff Plus we get emails so uh like I said just come a few minutes early to church if you haven't read your email or you haven't looked in the bathroom you can you can see it up here now we're gonna be blasting it everywhere so everyone can know everything that's going on with that I didn't know there was special meetings next weekend you know come on it's right there so you know we just just letting you know if you've kind of ignored that before I did too because we didn't want to keep it up to date now we're keeping it up to date so keep your eye on that so if is that all right amen how many says all my hopes is in Jesus Hallelujah let me see you I sing this every now and then but this song is my if I had a theme song I got like three or four theme songs but this would be my this is one of my favorite ones Hallelujah makes his way forward [Music] good I've been held on your s and I felt fire from above [Music] who I've been down to that River testify now well I'm saying [Music] enter [Music] [Applause] [Music] my yesterday [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] lost [Music] as hell yes Lord prison [Music] but I've been freedom Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] my yesterday [Music] amen [Music] thank you [Music] same tried his best Keep Me Down [Music] [Music] is in Jesus oh thank God [Music] forgiven ESS been washed [Music] praise the Lord Jesus good to be a Christian isn't it it's good to serve the Living God what a privilege he's given us Amen in this hour amen we are our very privileged people amen and we don't take that lightly it's not like anything that we have done I think of how that God would speak in the book of Deuteronomy to Israel reminding them of what he did in bringing them out of Egypt God was letting him know you know because there was those that brought back an evil report and Israel wandered for 40 years in the wilderness it still it didn't diminish the promise of God one bit when God makes a promise God keeps his promise and I'm grateful for that because we can all Fellowship around this thought we've had our thoughts our ideas or whatever but in the midst of it all because you see the same thing in Abraham you see it all the way through that's just not an isolated event but it shows to you and I and what a rest this brings to us is the prevailing power of Revelation that God will and he does fulfill every word and I don't care how much unbelief Paul writes of this in the Book of Romans will unbelief hinder God no though many did not believe will it hinder got no no it's not going to stop God God is moving with a purpose and so then when we we come into that place God would remind Israel that the reason you're here is not because you and yourself are better than somebody else but he lets them know the reason you're here and what I've done is because a promise I made to your fathers and what was that promise that's his word and he is the word is that right that's why brother Bram says that when anything comes up and he's taking us from Moses where Moses stood there and when the people had sinned and Moses did Moses put himself in the breach for the people now who was that it took more than a man because of a man before ran is that right when when they when they came against Moses down in Egypt he ran but there was something different about Moses life now it was Christ in Moses I tell you I this is this is you know to say well brother Sammy this might be your thought or your idea no I believe this is the word of God you talking about a one great display of Redemptive Grace I that right there is one I would rather have in my heart and in every heart here than if we could sit here and testify I walked on the water I did this I did that but if we can have her my heart I stood in the gap how can we stand in the gap because it must be Christ in us standing he stood for us now he and us we yield to him and he stands amen and that's why coming back to that place brother ramp said see when God has made a promise in his word he said like Moses Moses put God's word right in his pathway God was going to come down and smite Israel but he said God Moses put the word in God's pathway and God will never overstep his word why I'm gone and I change not he comes to fulfill it not overstep it not bypass it no matter what is going on no matter what situations where others could in this age that God would speak and require and speak to you and I of a brotherly kindness of a perfect love in an age when hatred is so rampant right but who can do it you and I would not have wrote the surrounding backgrounds for this to be the setting for that to be made manifest but the Difference Maker is who it is in US doing it that's all the difference in the world amen don't you love him this morning amen and amen so I want to just mention to you today is that the Christian family event the RSVP if you haven't signed up out there on the on the table please do that at the end of the service because at that point then I have to take it and we've got to I've got to process through a lot of things before then I start um opening it in in for the other churches because as I told you before I just can't we can't uh just wide open it uh open it wide because there's only seed we're only going to be seated for 200 and there's got to be working room in there and that's what we've spoke to them and so keeping it in that manner um also the fellowship dinner and before I make that a comment um the Christian family event the reason when brother Barry and I just took the guidelines that he had given within that and asked them the questions on who should be there and I think I mentioned this to you uh over the past two weeks uh the reason is the that when we say in it should be a 20 years old and up and really with children because it's not it's not like an actual service and we just want you to be able to be attentive and interactive with things that are going on so we're not just running around like like at a fellowship which we all well I've done when I had little ones and some of you that have little ones and so if you're I mean if you have little ones that are running around if you uh wood if you can find a babysitter and that's why we've let it be known here weeks in advance to try to get that orchestrated because it's not going to be it's not going to be like a fellowship dinner but it's going to be an interactive and a working time that's there and you might say working time every one of you probably every one of us have been to things even on our jobs trainings right hello anybody ever been to trainings on that you didn't go to sleep on me already my timer's not even started yet this does not count [Laughter] but we've all been to that right yeah the only thing different about this is a lot different for if you were like me when I would go to the trainings and uh when I was teaching you know you when you're first I was the the new guy on the Block you you have to learn who to sit next to and who not to sit next to because you've got some people in there they want everybody else to be quiet like teachers everybody to be quiet when I'm teaching in the class if you're doing I'll send you the office and you want to get up and say why don't we send you to the superintendent's office because you can't seem to zip it when everybody else is presenting you know I I've looked at that so you learned to kind of who to sit next to and who not but there's been in trainings and things like that at times where there's you know your information and thing is going on and then it's broke out and then it's coming back and forth and um so we we are we just want to be able to do that we could have done it right here in the in the assembly and just allowed the ministering just to take place right here but we want it to be in that manner to wear that even where it's open with questions and answers and you can write anything down and that pertains to that that would be beneficial so we just want to say that the fellowship dinner will be on Sunday February 19th so that's two weeks from today Lord willing will have a fellowship dinner the email has been sent out for February and there's also upcoming events that have also been laid out in there for the calendar I'm not going to ask how many read your email and I know there's been a little bit of with that of the email sister Roseanne takes care of that for us but she's there's been a lot that she has uh been really juggling even with some Transitions and things like that so that's why that maybe in January we didn't get a calendar it was posted on the board in there so if there's anything at all hey these things we take a lot of pictures with them am I right I mean when I go to a parking garage at a hospital anymore as soon as I get out of the car level three snap that's the last thing I'm thinking about is where I parked at so that's what I do why you do that so I'm not going to be the last guy there walking over every floor that's why I do it so uh oh brother Sammy you come up with a good night no I borrowed that from somebody else but even if you you go in the in the restroom there and you see the calendar in there you can take a picture of that and then get the things into your uh calendar there so you're well aware of what's going on and I also want to say um to the the brothers I just I wish I could have been there I'd worked to try to set myself as much as I could to be there yesterday morning and I didn't want to text you at the time it I knew I wasn't going to be there because it was about 3 A.M Saturday morning and um Benjamin Had injured his his foot and so coming back out of emergency room and things and I just I wanted to be there but I want to say this I appreciate you brothers getting together that does me well I'm saying that that rejoices my heart to see the body wanting to get together and so as you put that together and I don't know exactly who's responsible for that but I say God bless you amen because you say well how could that make your heart feel well same way when brother Branham in the beginning of the first Shalom message he preaches he was so thankful he said I see some of you have brought lunches here and you're going to fellowship with one another after the service oh he said that makes my heart feel good right amen well there wasn't a real strong Amen on that but uh but the grace of God helps us to overcome self doesn't it amen so I I like I said I just want to say to the brother and I appreciate that and Lord willing uh you know we'll be able to be there the next time because I certainly want I I certainly want to support it I really appreciate that so uh you for the brothers God bless you carry on amen carry on and say it's it's wonderful so without taking any more time and I've taken some unless if we could stand and we want to turn to the word of God and um we just want to turn our hearts here and just this morning amen brother Ryan is Maddie here today she is okay so it's good to have and I'm sure sister Rachel's here too so it's good to have uh brother Ryan sister Rachel and Maddie back here the this morning and so thankful for how God has just brought her through and good to see each and every one of you some of you from vacation I haven't seen some of your faces but it's good to be gathered here together amen John chapter 17 verse 20. Hallelujah neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word now we know that our word cannot be a different word but it must be his word that draws and causes Hearts to be moved toward him so neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word I was included in that prayer how about you and this is where it may be that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I indeed that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou Hast sent me and I want you to catch this this is the heart of God loves Unity God loves Unity but remember he likes Unity that's true remember he came down upon the Tower of Babel and smote all of that but what they were able to achieve by just being unified but I'm grateful there's a greater power than the intellect of man that's uniting us together it has to be look how different we are right look how much grace we need for one another is that right my verse 22. and the glory which thou gave us me I have given them so that Glory that has come that has unfolded in my life of that of who I am that they may be one even as we are one so that same Glory I've given them and here it is in verse 23 i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me thank you Lord let's just bow our heads just for a moment of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord we're gathered here this morning Lord and we're in need of your grace Lord we're in need Lord of you this morning that you would just Lord come Among Us Lord come to every every life and Lord Grace that Lord that every door might be open Lord and that you would just speak and Minister Lord to every need that's gathered here Lord father we need your grace this morning Lord we ask that you will come Lord and take control Lord in every in the furtherance of this service Lord as we give ourselves to you in Jesus precious name amen amen God bless you as you're being seated I want to just take back and read just a few places out of the message Oneness and I mentioned that to you last week that if you haven't listened to that message Oneness if you would do so that's drawing quite a bit from there but the theme runs through the whole message it runs through the whole Bible so it's it's the theme the theme doesn't change the theme is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that that doesn't mean that doesn't change the veils or The Masks the form the vessels change but he never changes so he's the theme all the way through it so then but the Brahman says Jesus prayed that the church and he would be one like he and the father were one that the church we as members of the body of Christ would be one together just like he and the father are one and then he quotes the scripture from John 14 and at that day we would know that he was in the Father the father in him and he and us that together we were one what a union a Oneness that would be to see God in his church till every member is just perfectly in harmony with each other and God that's the church that Jesus is coming for that's when his prayer will be answered that we will be one and I even as I read this here the only thing that can ReSound from my heart is is oh how it will take and is taking the grace of God to achieve this man cannot achieve this this is God's achievement but you say what is our part in it our part is to yield and allow him to do what he has ordained to do amen and I'll tell you it's supernatural you you know many times we think and we should uh and we consider the Red Sea we consider the Jordan but remember this Bible the Holy Spirit Has Lifted it from just a book of History which it does contain history history and lives and events but it makes it known that he's the same God of what he did there and sometimes we can look at it in our in our own life but remember the same God that opened the Red Sea that made them made a way where there wasn't no way where their back was up against the wall our backs were against the wall and if we can we really look at it in this manner that we need the same God continually moving in our life to open and to make a way because when it all comes down in our un individual life in the local body in the body around the world there's not one man not one person that can take credit for what has been done but it is all to the glory of almighty God remember those that will stand and say Lord didn't I do this didn't I do that that's after the Rapture that's standing at the white Throne judgment and presenting to God that this is why I'm worthy I preached I did this I did that but you see for the bride for his wife the I on Syria's name got taken off amen by the coming of the Glorious revelation of Elohim himself hey let me tell you there's nothing that could remove the eye out of you and I except the greater eye amen it's the only grounds of Fellowship that God has ever laid down for himself and his church is the Oneness of himself in the people that's the only grounds of fellowship and the only way that you can have those grounds is by Union to be United with him forever and we read this last week this is God's Oneness when the spirit that you got agrees with this word there's a lot we could preach just from on that part but it's more than you or I just standing here and saying yep everything I've not made any mistakes I'm not no but to agree with the word of God is where the spirit of God within us then it's lining with the word even when the word comes across to correct us it recognizes the word and agrees with it are you hearing me now and Manifest this word and makes this word power to act the same way it did there and brother Brian said let's say it together so let's let's do that let's say it together Oneness with God is to have God's spirit in you agreeing with the word all the word the whole word and to make it manifested in power I want to just deal with this desire and purpose because when Jesus is praying it's what a what a um uh a layout of how that we are to pray because remember the disciples even had asked him the time teach us how to pray and prayer itself was to be solemnly uh uh overshadowed with the desire for God's will to come down for his will to be done in our life that's what prayer was all about is thus submitting to the will of God and I know we have requests that we have to make we we have needs you we read requests right here before uh the assembly you take up the prayer request and you're praying and I'm praying and you know whether it's in our prayer closet even throughout the day is different needs texts and so forth so there's always requests and petitions that we have and needs and there's things that that we might we would desire to see in our life and it's the holy spirit that stirs these things up in our lives to begin to ask for God to fulfill his word in our life and it's something that we give ourselves to it's something to be diligent about so Jesus is praying here he is at this moment he is praying for the work of what God's desire has been from before the foundation of the world and that is that God might dwell fully in his children in that of redemption he had that in Adam and Eve he was dwelling in them they had his holy image in him is that right that's what they had but when they sinned they got away from the word that Holy image it left their life right but within that now what was in God the whole time to be a savior to be a redeemer to be and deliver all those attributes were within him all the time now the condition is what calls for those attributes to be made manifest and God would show it down through the scriptures in type he would all the way through I don't have time to deliberate on that but God desired first of all to express himself in other words they had down through the scriptures you could there hear us through Isaiah hear us through Jeremiah hear us through Abraham all of these that were down through the scriptures and it was just a portion of God revealing himself like a rainbow a rainbow is divided up into seven colors is that right and each one it's a portion that is made in there but where all of that those divided colors they come together other and it actually is a part and makes that of white light or white light broke apart is those seven colors is that right and that's how God even through the church ages they each had their dip of the Holy Spirit but at the end time it would not just be one color but it would be everything has been brought together to manifest the Living God and he would descend as he did in Revelations 10 with the Covenant rainbow around his head and he's a covenant-keeping god it would be the fullness of Jesus Christ once again on display through the ministry of Malachi 4 and now in a bright body it could never have moved to a bright body without being manifest through Malachi 4. that's God has a way because what it was what did he call us to it never called us to brother Branham it never called us uh to a church but what was it it was God stepping down and God issuing a bridegroom call to the Bride of a message that would have an effect upon Rebecca and would call her to the True Image and character that God ordained for her to be that's why Paul could say that there is a crown a new body a theophany laid up in glory for all of those who love his appearing not his coming his appearing but see is appearing in this hour it's not his Corporal coming it is the coming of the fullness of the Holy Spirit once again now in Bride form so first he is to express it's he wants to reveal himself and so now once he's revealed let me just uh as it comes to me to make this uh statement regarding that uh when you those brothers that were traveling to Sandusky yesterday um you saw the first sign if you were coming from here you saw the first sign that would have spoke of Sandusky and then the hearing it would have been right past Baumhart Road I know that because I used to travel that to work and you would know that now when you see Sandusky wrote on the sign you do not stop at the same right the sign tells you keep going the sign says you're headed the right way and here you fine going from 33 miles at that marker then you'll find yourself going further on down the line and here it comes it's no longer 33 miles it's closer why because of the direction that you're headed till eventually you make an exit into Sandusky and that's what the sign of Malachi 4 was it was a sign to let us know Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever his Nature has never changed his power has never changed is that right because the same God that can stand right there and move down through a veil and say I see you over here this was what was wrong in your life but in the name of Jesus Christ you are healed and Cancers would drop diseases would drop you know what that was speaking of that there was an ever-present power to change the life of a believer that changes from Death unto life it shows us there's a present power that is here to change our bodies oh my it shows there's a present power that can deal with situations they're not alive I say glory be to God In the Heights what's your confidence brother Samuel my confidence is in the Lord [Applause] I tell you that no bones about it my confidence is in the Lord what are you going to do about this my confidence is in the Lord [Applause] right the second part is that he might have the preeminence now you Bible readers you know I'm going drawing even from Colossians 1. from where the Prophet had preached Christ the mystery and that preeminence is to where that he would Express himself through us and then that would lead to a restoring of the Kingdom to its rightly position let me just say this before I go any further the kingdom of God has come in to the Life by the baptism of the Holy Ghost then through that that moving into our life what does it do it directs us and moves us we are delegates of that Heavenly Jerusalem it is an announcement you realize in our life when the token life is on display it's an announcement to Satan one more time I'm going to remind you through another life you have been defeated the keys were stripped off of your side and then God lays claim on another and displays his grace through their life and what is it it's a testimony devil listen up you lost again oh he's on the losing side he's not on the win inside amen we're on the winning side and the wind inside is the Lord's Side [Music] Glory so secondly is to have the preeminence in his body of Believers that is his bride that he might live in people now you understand that here we are I want to read this to you out of the message things that are to be maybe to draw from here this morning speaking of this portion of scripture we read out of John 17. Jesus only asked for one thing in his prayer to the father you know what that was one thing after all of his sacrifice that he did here on Earth the life that he lived the path that he walked he asked for one thing that where I am they may be also but something he could have asked I know he could have asked for a lot of things I know he could have asked according to his physical needs [Applause] he could have asked according to his Spirit if we could say that were things where he was put he could have asked for that right but not this is what I'm saying when you consider how he was praying listen his reproach the mocking the spitting everything criticism that did not cease or lessen the closer he got to Calvary it intensified and that's why brother round could take us in the message identification and he says oh I see him going up to that and they said carrying the cross of the mountain I see one little blood spot now it's joining together with another one another one oh he finally his back is covered over with blood and he said oh how Satan no doubt looked at that and said there ain't no way that could be the Son of God because the Son of God wouldn't stand there and take that but brother Graham said oh yes a Son of God will when the Son of God knows he's doing the will of God he will stand there and he knows it's just the devil trying to get him out of line that's why when Peter rose up and Peter said they ain't gonna crucify you Jesus never said the Lord rebuked you Peter but he said Satan the Lord rebuked you because he knew it was Satan trying to hinder him from the plan and program of God tell you we ought to call the devil's name we ought to call here we ought to call him down I'm here for one purpose and that's to serve God and devil even get in my way I'm gonna put my feet on your neck I'm gonna take your head off well I'll do this and I'll do that but I ain't giving up let me tell you when the enemy has come around and whatever more I'll tell you what I've said in prayer I say it right out in prayer I'm going to turn up my praise you think I'm going to hold something back I'm going to turn it up I'm going to pray more I'm going to study more I'm going to be more diligent you're not shutting me down [Applause] how can you say that because there's something on the inside that's moving me he is the strength of my life [Applause] Jesus only asked for one thing in his prayer to the father you know what that was one thing after all the sacrifice that he did on Earth the life that he lived the path that he walked he asked for one thing and that's where I am they may be also he asked for our fellowship Lord have mercy he asked for our fellowship and we was guilty as a fox in a hen house but he wasn't he wasn't asking to join up with the fox he was asking to join up with his children he was asked for our fellowship and that's the only thing he asked the father in prayer was your companionship forever oh my I didn't notice brother Brown says then how much at the end of that paragraph then how much should we desire him he desired this this was a request now watch brother Brown says oh if you really are born of the spirit of God that means everything to you it ain't some Book of Rules you don't live any laws and so forth you live by the grace of God the spirit of God so it's God's desire that now comes down into the very heart of the believer Hallelujah what was once in his mind is now in the heart of his children what Grace who put that there not me not you he did that we're his workmanship Hallelujah Romans 2 11. for there is no respect the persons with God now I want you to watch how Paul goes into this in verse 12. regarding this no respecter of persons for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law so the holy spirit is letting it be known it basically we could just put it right here there's no excuses that's just what it took away there's no excuse of God there's no respect to a person those that have perished without the law and then Paul's letting them know just because you've got the law if you're not walking in it you're also going to be judged is that right for not the hearers of the law are just before God but the doers of the law shall be justified for when the Gentiles I love this scripture which have not the law do by Nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves now notice what he's saying the Gentiles which don't have the law but are doing by Nature that which is contained in the law so it's by Nature now as it goes on which show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel so to do by Nature now remember under the law man was judged righteous even based on of he did this and I did this and I did not do that but because remember Romans 8 the law was weak through the flesh but God was going to make a way that that law that word his nature would come into a people and it would not be uh just a keeping of laws but what it would be it would be the righteousness of God not because of what a man is doing but because of the nature that is within him you're with me we could spend we could go through the whole scriptures on that first John second John third John on and on but notice notice by Nature because now it is the righteousness of God within the heart of man acting himself in and through man and you know at one point our natural desire was to want to do the things of the world right that was natural that's why brother Brown tells us he said you take a young person he said unconverted he said that rock and roll he said we'll catch him sure is the world why because it's the nature that's there that's why I didn't come follow me when he's speaking to a small group of graduates and he says you know he said it wouldn't matter if you took this young person and put him in a remote Indian Camp whatever is on the inside is going to come out right that's why and that's why it's got to be a change on the inside are you hearing me now because it's not just being conformed to the message to all the you know we do this and we don't it's it's deeper than that it's gonna be a life on the inside is that right amen and that can only come by the new birth so your natural desire is to cut your hair your natural desire to wear shorts paint your face natural desires to be intellectual smart man know something better than the other so I mean my person may not have you know well this and that but but if it if this is still there a smart man you got to know something better than somebody else that's still part of the natural sinful desire are you hearing me now I'm quoting out of invisible Union because remember that's what it was that Drew the fall it's what Satan was wanting to present to Eve because you know it's there to love the world the things of it to desire it but something happened in our life what was it that changed us not our efforts or our works we do have to yield ourselves to God God's not going to pull us and and we you know are sitting around like dead weight that ain't yielding but when we yield we're you were moved by the love of God and God is drawing us and and bringing us to himself there's a yielding to the work of Calvary that the spirit of God might come forth in our life in Romans 8 10 notice this if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness so the only way Christ can be in US is the body is dead my now we've worked with this a little bit last week the body is dead what is Paul dealing with he's talking about that first nature right because there's people that could remember me from high school or before a lot of times you got to show them pictures because I had hair back then right but you know the thing of it is is that the same body but what's different is what's on the inside that's real Christianity are you hearing me now what's on the outside what's on the inside so if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness is that right so the nature because remember the nature of the spirit is the soul remember it wasn't our body that died it was in our spirit that died but it was that soul that died that nature but you say well why did that have to die because remember God won't marry us when we've got a living husband come on now Romans 7. he's got to follow his word there's got to be a death not just a divorce because a divorce that God can come back again whether he's 15 years in the message 20 years in the message 30 years in the message if he's never dead and just divorce he'll come back hello now you know I'm preaching to you now it might get hard but let's get through it now but you see not notice this but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you I love that he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you did you catch that raise you up raise you up when the Holy Spirit is come and he's dealing with your life the holy spirit is not putting you down he's trying to lift you up it's sin and traps of the enemy that's got you where you're at but the quickening power of God comes by to do what encourage you to try to lift you up there is no other spirit that can lift you up in the right way to the right position outside of the quickening power of almighty God I'm not talking about lifting you into a church I'm talking about lifting you into position in Heavenly places and the same way it raised him up on that Easter morning is the same way it'll raise in an Easter in our lives therefore Brethren now because of this we are debtors but not to the flesh to live after the flesh so the flesh is going to try to exact some things but you're not in debt to it you've got to remember there's there there has to be a Liberty on the inside are you hearing me now and if you live after the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body you shall live everybody with me not through our efforts but through the spirit what are you talking about I'm talking about a son and daughter of God that he is ruling and reigning oh brother Samuel we're going to do that in the Millennium I'm telling you right now there won't be no Millennium for you if you don't have it here and ruling over it right now because it's got to take a quickening power that brings this guy in subjection to the word man come on now because you let somebody cross you the debt of the flesh will raise right up get even with them is that right but there's got to be a greater power on the inside that says shut up get back here that is not Who We Are [Applause] come on Friends [Applause] my Lord have mercy we did not when we got the Holy Ghost this did not become a glorified body you have got to bring it in subjection please tell me what do you say I'm saying that every thought is to be judged by the word of God bring it subject to the Judgment seat of Christ and if you've got the Holy Ghost he's in you [Music] whom I mortifying the Deeds of the body ye shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of God they're the sons of God now watch your brother around brings us he said this outside is sin now let me just sometimes I don't feel like I have to quantify it to I shouldn't have to to a group of Believers but I do not believe stuff is saying well you know I I'm born again on the inside but this outside you know he just that's that's not true because what you're saying is there's a power on the outside that's greater than what I got I just read a scripture if the spirit that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in you not on you not around you not a feeling it's got to be in You by an inborn nature [Music] this outside is sin see it's to recognize what it is that right when we can really recognize what that is over the same I thought we're preaching on Oneness with God working in us that's right have to do that before I can never get to the body because you know why we need to understand ourselves so we can be able to help and to understand one another because we sure need the grace of God for ourselves and we need the grace of God for one another is that right I think of how the prophet said in the message of Grace he said oh it taken Grace to hold Jehovah's family together the grace of God and we sure need God's grace don't we this outside is sin that what that means is is that I do not trust this guy right I don't trust him I'm not afraid of him but neither do I trust him is that right do you know that you know your body is sin that's the reason don't try to perfect that body it's sin do you know that it was born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies and that soul is the same way until the soul died and then was born again of God then that Soul can't die the soul that Sinners shall die but he that believeth on me has everlasting life then there is an immortal life watch out brother and places this then there is an immortal life living in that body so the body is not the immortal life but Immortal Life Has Come and is projecting itself through this body and this body is sin wow but Samuel what a contrast I agree what a contrast right what a contrast to think the glory of God the glory that would be unfolded to you and I that would uncover and reveal who you and I are that portion of God coming to you and I have the Holy Spirit to bring about the new birth on the inside what does it bring forth a son and daughter of God and here is a son and daughter of God which is who you really are you're not really the person that you brush his teeth comb his hair if you've got it that is not the real you when you have been born of the spirit of God the real you this is only the veil that is used to display the invisible son or daughter of God an attribute that came from his thinking and has been projected into a body of time is that right so here it's Immortal Life living in a body what a contrast and it's a continual contrast is that right it's a continual contrast in our life when the spirit of God has moved into our life now notice that's like a stream coming from heaven and that's where it had to come from like a core on the inside of a man now what's at the core that's the seed right and you get the seed the seed is what will produce more of the same kind right so that life coming down into the core which is where the seed which is where the heart of it is at now notice that stream coming from heaven like a core on the inside of a man that's the part that's Godly that operates this body we could just stop right here and have a prayer meeting and say Lord if it's not there in me yet Let It Be and Lord where it is in my life let me yield to The Godly part because The Godly part has never led me wrong once I've been born of the spirit of God that Godly part has never made me never let me wrong you know what I've never had to ask somebody to forgive me for something The Godly part did because The Godly part didn't do it wow am I preaching to Angels this morning are you all just shell-shocked listens to sin but you see what it is neither is it remember as he said don't try to perfect this body because you can try to perfect this body you've got this down this down this down and yet you're missing what's the most important thing is on the inside you can have all the other right and if you don't have the life on the inside you'll never come up is that right now watch before this body can ever be perfected in other words changed the spirit will bring it in submission to God so you realize what the Rapture is it's a final subduing of our body to the promise and glory of God that is already dwelling in our lives because the Rapture is not going to be like wow this is an amazing day everything's just right the toast came out right Pop-Tarts are just right this morning mine's got frosting all over him man I mean she fixed the eggs perfect this morning my goodness that you know the workers got donuts and I got the freshest one let me tell you something there can be perhaps on the Rapture morning it might be one of the worst mornings that you have been faced with trials that have been all around you but what will it be it will be another day in the life of a Believer where you have looked around at trials where you have looked around at things around you and said ain't gonna hold me back ain't gonna stop me I'm gonna go on whether I feel like praising him or not I'm gonna praise him I'm going to declare he is worthy what are you doing I'll tell you what you're doing Enoch you're taking another step you're going beyond your feelings you're going beyond your thoughts how am I doing that because the quickening power within you keeps quickening Quicken and Quicken and quicker wow takes you right away don't it because sometimes we come into a service let's just bring it down here sometimes we come into a service and my if it seems like the song leaders had the struggle if it seems like the keys aren't hitting right if it just seems like well this is too loud and that's too hard and that's too cold and what you come to church for anyhow huh what do we come for anyhow but listen this goes to show you and I what if and we are battled within a service come on even when you go out into other meetings or whatever more right see somebody or whatever more and God dealing with hearts and so forth but notice what is it you don't allow that to hold you back are you hearing me Church what is it it's an overcoming power that is moving within you to overcome your feelings your flesh your thoughts there's got to be a greater is he that is in me my bringing me in submission to the word of God so you know what that causes me to do that if tomorrow morning I wake up and guess what my coffee just doesn't taste just right I'm not going to say steamed milk was on top instead of the bottom and building it up can't be a Rapture Day oh no on the contrary because remember when God visited Abraham's tent the prophet said in the tent that morning Abraham and Sarah had just had a little fuss but I can't keep he can't keep God away from fulfilling his word listen what are you saying I'm telling you that you shouldn't let buses keep you from church you shouldn't let well things didn't go right at home don't let anything Satan will do anything to keep you away from the promise of God but the promise of God Is So Much Greater why because he who made the promise is faithful and he abides faithful even when we don't but before this body can ever be perfected the spirit will bring an in submission to God now you think you have to do that preachers have to do that as well too it doesn't get any easier everything has to go all of us we all have our sacrifice to make how many knows it's true sometimes it's easier in the house of God sometimes it's easier to press through sometimes you have the song Services where it's almost like somebody just went to act like they were going to touch the piano and man it's just like and it isn't the piano it's the spirit of God but what created that oh my neighbor no not your neighbor oh brother no I'm not brother so and so you had a spirit of expectation and whatever you come expecting that's what you're going to get but the spirit will bring us in submission to God watch this it'll let me make sure I get my glasses on make sure I gotta read this right it'll War all the time a constant Oh My Flesh just loves to pray I hate to call you a liar but I'm going to call you a liar on my flesh just love me no it is in my flesh My Flesh at times don't want to study My Flesh at times don't want to Pray My Flesh at times don't want to get in to the message my flesh sometimes maybe don't want to shake this hand or shake that hand or do this come on now I'm preaching to you but what is it there's something there on the inside that moves us forward all right oh brother Samuel you're just too plain well we need plainness in this hour because the devil is not laying underneath the cloak the devil is very intentional in shoving his agenda down people's lives and I believe we're living in the hour of the revealing of the son of man each time to be intentional it's time to speak it plain is that right there ain't no holier than thou there ain't no person up here here that's better remember it is all in need of The Sovereign Grace of God to Reign Over in our life you say what do you mean by that when you can really see that in your own life then you can have Grace for somebody else in their life preach brother Samuel think a will Paul said we'll never get more than him he said when I would do good what did he say evil is near me and that's a part-time sometimes what's it say constant War so if the devil ain't taking off no days what does that say hey the devil's faithful man come on now the devil listen the devil's faithful he comes right around he's faithful to come faithful you know what listen he does the same thing he's always done he tries to do the same things only he's Faithful is that right if the devil can be that faithful and you and I have a greater spirit inside of us the spirit of God because it wasn't the devil that made God it was God that created the devil is that right and you've got the deity of Jesus Christ in you hello your brother Samuel what's the problem right here right here we baby this guy too much we say he's our worst enemy oh boy but don't touch him see sometimes we really don't believe what we're saying we say God help me Lord because he is he's our worst enemy now if you're already there you pray for us sorry folk that we'll get to where you're at okay because I'm so glad that when God gave you the Holy Ghost he gave you a glorified body but that ain't the truth First Corinthians 4 20. remember not a license to sin it's got to be the spirit of God on the inside notice First Corinthians 4 20 for the kingdom of God is not in Word but in power it's not the message Oneness what's what he says here the kingdom of God is God's word me power what is the kingdom of God it's within you the Kingdom's in you now watch the statement and when the word comes in there notice where when it comes in there what was the there not just here but it will start there in the mind is that right amen that's how the new birth comes it starts in the mind first agreeing with the word accepting opening the mind which is the womb opening up and allowing the word to come in beginning to accept the word of God agreeing with the word of God what God has said and then allowing the spirit of God to come behind and bring the word down to its rightful resting place now I want you to keep this in mind as we'll talk about these things for a few minutes when we're talking about the word I am talking about this but we're not all together just talking about this we're talking about the person of the word himself is that right when the Lord Jesus came if there would have been one prophecy unfulfilled or was something in his life that was not hitting up with the Fulfillment of the word he would not have been the Messiah are you hearing me now he could have it could have been 99 and nine tenths it would not have been the Fulfillment of the word but it had to hit on perfectly is that right because it is the word himself and when the word comes in there what does that word what does this word begin oh I love this it turns itself into Power making it say just exactly what it said you say you can't say it says this and it says that and make it work so splashing quotes splashing scripture to make it fit your life it won't work I'll be on the days of splicing tape but you can't Splash quotes either picking out our favorite quotes and favorite things it's got to be a life that lines up with the word is that right because that's what it's about it's about a Word in Life notice you can't say it says this and it says that and make it work you've got to say the same thing it says that makes a confession not saying well it's polished up here a little and I'll have more wisdom and I'll be in better understanding over there no what it has to be is the Amen on the inside expressing the word of God is that right oh bless Samuel that's awful time you remember how brother Ben tells a story about them recruits when they come into basic training and he talks about how them sergeants will just rake them good man getting them out of the bed kicking the can down and everything getting right in their face and oh I know now that everything's become a bunch of sissies you can't get in their face and you can't correct people and you can't do this and you can't do that I know that stuff started way back there but you understand you got all these things that's come all the way down and brother Brown lays it down in this way he said you take that recruit oh my he'll say that's Sergeant oh here he comes again this Sergeant's so nitpicky he wants her boots looking like this and he wants to see his reflection he wants my rifle like this he wants you why do you think that he's doing that do you think that Sergeant is doing that because he just wants to do that because he's picking on you now maybe you will think that if you've had somebody pick on you but that's where you're going to need the grace of God to say help me get over this thought because if not you'll put everybody else back in the box of anybody who's got any little bit of 40 over you you'll put them right back there but there is a true Authority is that right but when it comes down to the battlefield and they're crawling underneath them bullets and then bullets are shooting over and they're running let me tell you something brother Brandon said it very clear and I know there's been those who stood in the battlefield sitting right here this morning you know what they are not complaining about that Sergeant then you know why because they have been prepared for the battle and let me tell you something the preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ what is it doing it is preparing you for a battle we must be able to stand in the end time having done all to stand stand therefore handle your lines gird about with truth yeah Hallelujah it don't take patch on the back and well you're a good guy you're a good messy believer you can know it takes it down let the word bring discernment in our life if we need to be born again let's line up with a word if there's something in our life that's not right let's line up with the word let's bring in its subjection to the word of God why because whatever is said here must be said from here that's a True Confession Hallelujah going down to paragraph 89s Mr Brianna what is it he said you've got to get with the word and get yourself killed out wow get with the word and get myself killed out when's the last time you ever wanted to get with somebody who was going to kill you come on I'm not mentioning words we're not mixed when's the last time you would go but you see what it is he doesn't approach you that way it's the love of God drawing you to what Calvary well brother Samuel he went to Calvary for me he did because without him going to his Calvary we could never go to our Calvary because Jesus wrote about our cross a whole lot more than he ever did about his own take up your cross and follow me right Paul writes of it over and over through the scriptures Galatians Romans on and on why because it is a crucifying of self you've got to get with the word and get yourself killed out and I'm persuaded that many of us friends have received the Holy Ghost but we just receive enough holy ghost in US to make us to a place where we don't want to lie we don't want to steal we don't want to do anything brother brown one's saying we just don't want to do anything he just says we don't want to do anything I mean he means I want to do nothing wrong but God wants to fill every fiber of his church can we say Amen not just enough not just I got enough I got enough I got enough I got enough I had enough well I don't wanna I don't you know I quit smoking but be careful that quit wasn't you quitting because if it's you quit and that's a new spirit is that right but see just to receive just enough I don't I don't want to receive just enough I know what he did in my life it's not just enough it's something about it when God begins to touch and draw upon your heart what is it it's the love of God this is not listen a church this is not a church demand it is Christ himself where he said if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me it's him that's drawing us on it's him that's encouraging you and I it's God that gives you and I the grace for ourselves to get killed out let me just try to finish this quote here but God wants to fill every fiber of his church he wants to feel your thinking he wants to fill your mind he wants to fill every bit of you and just make you completely totally dead to yourself or to your thinking I don't know about you but I could say Lord I need another refilling it's one feeling when you have been filled with the spirit of God that listen when the spirit of God when there's been an initial feeling a real birth on the inside listen the things of the world is gone and it puts your desire completely toward Calvary but what does it do there's a longing for more of God it's like when they talk about individuals and they have to be so careful at the hospitals I think about you know I've never never had it but I think about the times that probably you've heard brother Jewell talk about this and brother Jewel Forney when right before God had got a hold of his life and you know the ways and things like Eddie was running and Manny had shot himself right through the leg and so forth and here he was in the hospital and he said I'll tell you he said they started letting that morphine drip down because he was in such excruciating pain and he said you know what he said I find myself he said very quickly I became addicted to that morphine in there I began to ask them nurses I need some more I need some more you know how now they'll give you those little pumps and they give you like a joystick you can you can rapid fire it but it's only going to release so much at a time I pray God he's put it in our hands he's put in her hands the Holy Ghost is just not limited it's not limited of what it can do and what he desires to do in your life but he wants to fill every fiber he wants to fill every fiber I'll tell you what I do I just I keep on I keep on pressing I keep on moving forward and say Lord every fiber of my life if I'm not there yet that's what I'd be asking God not just casually but to see the hour demands it the time we're living in requires it this is token time it's not enough for a church we all can see that it's not enough to be around something it's not enough to know it we have got to have the word on the inside of us it's got to be a personal experience between us and God where we are no longer the same people is that right notice this totally dead to yourself or to your thinking just so surrendered in God till his words just living right through you and you don't know nothing else but God's word just stay right with his word it is life the kingdom of God this is what Jesus prayed for he prayed that this Oneness would be in our life where that he would dwell in every individual child of God he this is the very desire of God what was Jesus it was the heart of God on display and the display was for Oneness a Oneness how are they going to be one the glory you have given me I have given them that same Glory that has brought forth the manifestation of the word in my life revealed as the Son of God that same life that same Glory I have given to them the Holy Spirit had not even been poured out yet but their eyes were being opened did they understand they didn't even understand the events that was taking place right then but remember God's word would be fulfilled God would gather his children up that was confused at what had happened I don't understand why did this happen we thought he was the one that should have redeemed Israel what's going on here I don't know what's taking place but what did he do as a faithful Shepherd fulfilling his word he went and he gathered his sheep and directing them to the promise of Pentecost when that life would be poured out that's what he directed him to that now that God himself this desire that God would now come back in to dwell inside his people think about it filling every fiber of their being because the holy spirit will come and he he'll deal with our life he brings about repentance what's he doing he's moving into where it's touching our heart it's causing us to do what instead of walking this way repentance comes and there's a real turn that's what repentance is you're no longer going that way right what do I do let him feel some more fibers well what's filling more fibers where he he cleanses the desires he puts he changes your thinking about things of the world he changes your thinking about that of sin and unbelief I don't want to do that I I don't want to do this I don't want what is that he's feeling more fibrous are you hearing me now new heart new spirit but he said I will put my spirit in well brother Samuel why did he give me a new spirit because you couldn't even get along with yourself you know I'm quoting that across many quotes right now we couldn't even get along with ourselves much less God he had to give us a new spirit and then he comes by his spirit and sits down in the middle and he begins to control and feed from that innermost part God wants to fill every fiber until it's him being reflected in US I said granted Lord Jesus granted Lord God fill every fiber of me feel every fiber Lord I need more of you I need more of you I I want more of the Holy Ghost I want more I want a refilling I don't want just enough I need it say brother Samuel why do you need it because I still pack this sticky guy around I need more of Jesus I need more of him but the Samuel what does that do for you I'll tell you what it does for me instead of allowing stuff to get stuck on me so easily having a refilling of the Holy Spirit allows things that want to get stuck on me and allows it to keep moving on why because that's the power of the revealing of the Holy Ghost but Samuel I want scripture for that Jude my beloved keep yourselves in the love of God that's responsibility I'll be the same in my path no you keep yourselves in the love of God building yourselves up on your Most Holy Faith what's the most Holy Faith not your faith it's God's faith behind your faith so what is it it's building the stature of a perfect man it's Christ coming forth in our life it's growing more into His Image so building yourselves up how do I build myself we have access to the word of God that's been stored up we have access to the nutrients in this hour God knew there would be a battle in this hour and God has provided what you and I have need of the battle might look great but what do I do build myself up on your Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost oh Jude knew what he was talking about why he roped up that book and said how good that you would earnestly contend for the faith that was earnestly delivered to the Saints what is the faith it's God's own life the baptism of the Holy Ghost I would you would earnestly contend for it you knew what it was to fight for the right things God don't let me be caught fighting for the wrong things let me fight for the right things if I'm going to give my energy I want to be fighting for the right things are you hearing me Feel Me Lord afresh Feel Me Lord afresh amen brother Samuel I just feel like if I've gotten maybe a little bit loose that's where brother Brown describes he says you take that buckle and he said when you feel like you've got a little lacks in your Christian walk just tighten up the buckle come on now I'm quoting to you tighten it up and say Lord I need a good refilling of the Holy Ghost why because I'm on a journey I'm not eating this word preparing to stay here in Egypt I am eating this word I have been dressed I have been clothed I have been anointed and I got Baroda but deity of Jesus Christ and I'm here I'm ready at a moment's notice to be caught away I'm eating this word I'm expecting as I'm eating this word as I'm feasting on this word it might be what I'm setting to church it might be why I'm listening to a message it might be while I'm at work and I'm meditating on the things of God and hear the sweep of the Holy Spirit comes over what happens Enoch I'm gone we're gone [Applause] don't let nothing nothing stop you well I don't know if I don't let nothing stop you nothing holds you back if you don't have it press in and get it press in why it's time to make sure you got oil in your lamps it's time to make sure you got oil in your lamps it's time to make sure they're trimmed and burning why because the bridegroom announcement has already been made we're at the Midnight Hour we don't know how many more days how many more services how many more times that's why it's time to say nothing else matters when we stand there on the other side that day and stand in the love of God I ask you right here this morning tell me when we stand there on the other side if you plan on being there you've got to have that life in you right now but when you get there on the other side the things that seem to matter right now will not matter so if they won't matter then why let them matter now how should I pray Our Father Who Art in Heaven have it be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in Earth even as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread lead us not into temptation is that right forgive us as we forgive those who trespass against us and Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom the power and the glory forever and ever amen so how should I be praying let that character from the other side move down here Lord because what happens then it sweeps away all the this really matters it sweeps it away sweeps it away I tell you friends when we find the ones out but the same what's the secret what's the secret in your life as a pastor the Holy Ghost that's what's a secret is is staying in his presence even when you don't know what to do oh that's especially the time when I don't know what to do is to stay in his presence and let what let him sweep let him move let him direct because this is not my church it is not my body I know it gets referred to over to the Samuel's Church it ain't my church it's his church it's his body you are not Redeemed by my blood or by my sweat we have been redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ we are the his purchase he has rants from his blood for you and I and sent the Holy Ghost to call us to himself oh what Glory what Glory how precious I say Lord refill a sword for hearts it's never been filled film Lord let them see that real Victory that'll stabilize their lives let them see that rather say no what must it be it's got to be something you desire you've got to see your need you've got to see the part like Jacob saw in his own life Jacob realized he had had an encounter with God but that one encounter did not change him he was still Jacob he still pulled the same kind of deals he still acted the same way he was a deceiver is that right but when he came back and what was it it was God that told him let everything else turn around him labor who had been his buddy his father-in-law his countenance changed toward Jacob and Jacob God spoke to him and said come back to the land of Bethel you know what it was you might sit here as a young person or as an older person and you say I've experienced God before in my life that experience was necessary because why you can come back to a place and say Lord I experienced you this way I know you're a living God but I need you to change me from Jacob to Israel [Applause] what is it you know there's a living God he's touched your heart he's touched your life but Lord I want to meet the god of Bethel the god that can change that of Jacob and bring forth Israel what a mighty God we serve oh I'll tell you it's a quickening power comes to do what to Lift Us Lift Us lift up your head lift up lift up your life lift it up to the Lord and say the Lord take me Lord take all I am let the consuming fire of the Holy Spirit Lord let it come down for our God is a consuming fire but the Samuel what must it be it's got to be where you are tired of trying to dress Jacob up trying to make Jacob livid trying to make Jacob do right and making excuses for all of Jacob's habits and say Lord I just need you Lord I'm tired of being Jacob I want to be changed that's the promise that belongs to us hallelujah how will it come you'll have to press that means it'll have to be with all that's within your heart that you want it because when you want him he said if you seek me with all your heart then I will be found of you let's pray Lord Jesus Lord our commitment Lord is always to follow your leading that's our desire Lord father you see Lord Jesus right here this morning there Lord we are sitting here not as a people without needs but rather Lord we are a people that are very we're very needy Lord and father there's lives and hearts Lord no doubt setting here some streaming some will archive it Lord I pray that God as you in other situations Lord where we've witnessed you never even let boundaries distances Dwelling Places you never let that stand in the way for a heart that's really crying out and hungering for you Lord I pray right here this morning Lord May there be such a determination that would strike a Heart Lord that father as they can look and see that God how that you are making yourself known by by the revealing of your word your character your nature and what you're calling to Lord in each of Our Lives that Lord it would rise within their hearts Lord to really surrender to you Lord May Lord it not leave them Lord may it be Lord that of it real determination like Jacob oh God the wrestling outlord was where Jacob was dying to himself that Lord you might fully bless him and change him Grant him Lord and I pray father this morning Lord throughout this building once the Lord of heart and a life has met you well we're not just courting anymore but Lord we've been United in a union as bride and groom and what you prayed for I would that where I am they may be also Lord that desire was not just to dwell in the future home but Lord it was to dwell in Heavenly places right now in Christ Jesus and that was a prayer you asked for our fellowship you asked for our companionship and Lord it truly is a delight to our hearts when we think of that but I'm sure Lord just as within every marriage every husband and wife we know how that is here sometimes the Lord the cares of life sometimes Lord things that we don't realize little things can slip little things Lord of just Lord little gestures and little things Lord of time we just Lord not meaning to but in the course of this life we can become so busy and where we have to sit down sometimes and say hey who are you and we have to become Lord reacquainted oh we've said at the dinner table we talked we've sat down and maybe just passing by drinking coffee with one another but Lord sometimes Lord as we realize wait a minute in the busyness of life we need a heart to heart and Lord Jesus foreign that's the Lord in our lives Lord as we come into those places and you don't you don't come Among Us like this to condemn us but you come Among Us the Lord to whisper to speak to us to draw us Lord out of a Gloom to draw us Lord we can Lord we rise from our hearts and say Lord have I been neglecting you have I been letting the Lord just for passing by and things just kind of passing by but you come and say hey we need a heart to heart we need a heart to heart no wonder in the Song of Solomon it said let us flee away into the hills let us take our loves hither Lord a place where we can get away a place of solitude a place where we can just begin to have our hearts just hearing one another Lord I know that happens Lord God father in every marriage Lord It's work it's not something that's automatic it takes work it takes work and it's not something that Lord God that we don't like doing but Lord Jesus it's what we we love it's like Jacob when you look at how Jacob served for Leah he thought he was getting Rachel but then when he realized he'd got Leah he asked why have I been deceived but Laban told him and said it's not proper us to give the younger before the older so as he had labored for Leah she being a type of the Old Testament but here Jacob he was made known for seven years you must also labor for Rachel and I think of what the scripture said it seemed as but a few days to him because of his love for Rachel Lord Jesus the same to your bride and Lord from our hearts this is our desire Lord it's not lord it's not living by a law it's not I have to do this and I have to do this and I've got to go to church I've got to do this and I've got no Lord I pray God let it be this morning Lord if there's one that the Lord is still under that part of it would you grant them Lord the grace to move Lord from that place of just where it's miserable Lord and let them see let them experience the joy Lord God that presence that the Lord is all around their lives right now that is what you desire to do is dwell in their lives Lord God to where it's not I have to uh I have to but Lord it raises from the inside I get to I love to it's my desire to and it's through that Lord that brings this flesh into subjection it's through that desire of that inner man on the inside that gives an order to this body and says I need to borrow your knees because I'd like to pray it gives an order to this body I need to borrow your hands to raise and surrender to gesture how my heart is on the inside I need to borrow your lips to speak out of praise that's from within me I need to borrow your feet to get to church I need to borrow I need to borrow your eyes to read the word of God I need to borrow your ears to read the word of God I need to this is my desire granted Lord God I prayed this morning Lord right here Lord in her heart to heart moment with you Lord that we're Lord everything can be cleared out granted Lord we pray for us granted Lord God May Lord refill Lord our hearts Lord refill us Lord I I need to refill I want a refilling lord lord it's something that Lord God that sometimes we let too much space of time go between Lord it should be daily Lord God lord daily Lord God that we ask for refilling Lord what it means in our lives Lord God as you come down lord and move in our hearts Lord it gives us Grace and strength it helps us the Lord to look at things Lord God not through our own eyes not through our own intellect not their own reasoning it helps us to look through the eyes of God help us Lord help us father you're the strength of Our Lives Lord and as David said this one thing this one thing have I desired and that's what I'm going to seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord forever to behold the beauty of his Tabernacle He Shall Set me upon a rock glory be to God and to behold his Beauty to behold his Beauty to inquire in his Temple oh Lord as we look upon you the lovely one Lord God in your presence it's like Esther and the queen Lord and the king and the Lord as we're standing here Lord God and we lord are asking you Lord Lord continue to change me Lord continue to mold me and save me Lord oh God that that character of the word that I'm beholding Lord I want to see it Lord God living in my life Lord I want to see more of you Lord and less of Samuel Lord more of you Lord God where you said ask the father anything in my name and I'll do it granted Lord we pray in the name of Jesus Christ thank you Lord Hallelujah well let me just sing something what's on your heart amen if you'd like to stand you're more welcome to Ola can we just worship him a little bit let's just let the Holy Spirit just let him just saturate down how brother Brandon would speak so many times in the message how that after the word had went forth in the reign of the Holy Spirit just coming down said brother Samuel why why would that be so important well I'll tell you why because the word is a seed and that seed is went forth but you see on the outside of that seed it's got a coat on the outside that needs to be broke down see I don't I don't want to leave here with just a seed but I want the moisture of the Holy Spirit that's here present that's brought the word I want him to start breaking down Lord God let it break down and you realize it's not the word that needs to be broke down it's my will it's my will because the word don't need no Perfection the word is perfect but what I need is it's the word Lord let my will be broke down let my will be broke down let my thoughts about it be broke down let my thoughts rot about this Lord let it just saturate you know what it is it's a jump start that's what it is many times those of you know you've taken seeds maybe in school when I had to do with the kids you'd put them in them brown paper towels and you put them little bean seeds in there and you'd soak them overnight and by the next time the next day you come in and those seeds you'd be able to start peeling the outer coating off and it's almost like a translucent a transparent you know you can't completely see through it but it's like that coating on the outside it starts coming off and so then as you keep it in that brown paper towel or it don't look like much but you see what that towel does it keeps moisture around that seed and eventually what happens we would open up them paper towels like that and you would see a little part of green that had started to come out of that little bean seed but the same how did that happen it was in it the whole time but what it is something kept the moisture around it and that's what the Holy Spirit does in our life it's keeping that moisture around the word Lord let the word come forth let that germ of life let that expression come forth Lord I just want to stay in your presence and we know his presidency we don't leave when we leave the church we don't leave his presence question when we leave one another we don't leave his presence he said I'll be with you even in you to the end and you know even when you clock in at work you don't have to leave his presence he's right there with you Jesus doesn't stop at the locker while you walk in the plant if he's in you he's in you you know what that means you can have fellowship with him at all times invite his presence at all times what is it doing it's breaking down our will so what that the word itself might come forth don't you love him Hallelujah go ahead brother Brian lead us
