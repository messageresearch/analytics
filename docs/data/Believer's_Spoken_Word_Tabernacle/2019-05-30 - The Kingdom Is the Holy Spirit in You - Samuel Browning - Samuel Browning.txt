dog Oh hallelujah hallelujah glory be to God you love him amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen we want to go to Acts chapter one tonight a man just so thankful for the mercy of God amen what uh what a weekend that we had you know I I don't know I don't know how many of you read the even the other email that I sent out to you but there's so much that I feel and follow up with with the things that God has done in our midst and I just believe with all my heart that you realize what God's desire is and to see that you know the meetings themselves brother Tim even mentioned it and I had sent it out to even on the quotes and things before but you know the meetings themselves it would not have it would not have had the effect that it would have had if hearts had not been praying and expecting and we realized that our prayer and our expectation was for God to come on the scene I want you to think of what happened because you know here we've already entered back into the the workweek and everything else that we have to attend to but it still just lets you and I know that our focus and I've everything let it be solemnly and focused on the Lord you know there's times when we're looking at it in prayer and as we're praying you don't always have to be in your prayer closet I believe in having time away with the Lord I believe that with all my heart because there there's an effect upon our lives it's it's an effect when Jesus said we're praying we're asking for our daily bread we're asking for his leadership we're asking for his will to be done in earth even as it is in heaven and when we we look at that that expectation of even even from even this time forward I just say God let us be in a in a channel of expectation you know brother Branham he talked about it he would many different places in the message even when you listened to the messages expectation but the remm talks about at times he said he would just walk to the platform had not even prayed for nobody and he said people started getting up off the cots and you know you know what it was it wasn't about there hadn't even been in discernment take place whatsoever it's just people were already in an expectation and I just say it like this you know what we we want to take a hold of what God has put in our in our possession amen and don't let the devil take it take it away you realize we've said it over and over you have more control over these services than what you realize you know we come into service we we come in with a real purpose in our hearts and you know and brother Tim he made mention of that even in the the second Saturday service when he opened that service and he said you know I said I just feel such a Liberty here and that Liberty that that is that is felt you know he was prayed up but here we are as prayed up brother brimstone when you get the minister prayed up and the congregation prayed up he said things are going to happen the bream said when the people are prayed up and the ministers prayed up he said you don't have to he said the people he said they come through the prayer lines he said you just cast the spirit off he said and they go ahead and go on because people are already prayed up and in tune with God amen now that doesn't mean we're not going to have battles we're gonna have battles I don't know if I get to this tonight but there's nothing that God does that Satan won't try to contest it and he's permitted to do that but you know when he's permitted to do that that only shows the good that taken place that's what it shows amen so we want to look into the word of the Lord tonight just so so appreciate everything that was done and this weekend maybe I'll say more about that on Sunday of all day every all the efforts that went into make the weekend possible and we just I want to read just one or two verses of Scripture I'm gonna go to Acts chapter 1 verse 8 but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer tonight or Jesus how think for we are Oh God for your mercy and grace how thankful we are God for the Holy Ghost we're so thankful God for your working lord in our midst and it just it thrills our hearts o god as we Lord are just looking lord to you we see Lord and God the effects of your working Lord in our midst and how we thank your lord for the testimony of brother William Lord and and to know God oh my lord many other testimonies Lord to be given here on Sunday evening or God how our hearts are stirred within us Lord God and father we just ask that now that you'll come Lord and just take us Lord in your word Lord and speak to our hearts O God and I pray that father that your presence would just move among us in a special way tonight O God and Father just that our faith with just so rest Lord in the Eternal Word of God we pray Lord we just ask all these things in the name of Jesus Christ for the glory of God amen amen god bless you as you're being seated I I want to if you'll turn with me to John chapter 3 as well I want to go there and we'll just kind of take this tonight I want to I want to speak on tonight the baptism of the Holy Ghost but I wouldn't want really what I want to focus on within this and if I really could have a title to it I want to deal with the kingdom is the Holy Spirit in you and this is what I want to deal with we'll see how far we get and and I want to just look at this and lay just laying the things in just what God has done in our midst here within this past week I'll tell you right now I was ready to come to church on Monday you say what were you going to preach they're gonna preach the Bible I mean now I was ready to come to church on Tuesday night you know there's so much that does recognize that within it and you know that that's not anything that is kind of odd with me i you know i've said the different ones I said we just don't have enough services I just feel like there's so much that God just is opening that you seem like you don't have enough services you know to to go through everything I don't know anybody get nervous like oh my he's gonna stack the weak on us but I believe with all my heart that you know what if we can really look at it like like job would say when job would say that I i esteem his food i esteemed the Word of God more than my necessary meat and that's the absolute truth we draw strength from the Word of God and you know with with where God has brought us here within this this past weekend I I just you know many of some of these I was already studying and had on my heart and just begin to move them over you know after the weekend and how God led it I just thought well let me just put on Stinnett some other things on pause and we want to just we want to just nail nail the things down here and just looking at it of what God has already done and and I look at how that you know within the scripture this the coming of the Holy Ghost was a promise that was given clear from the Old Testament that after the Messiah would be offered up this is what this is what the church was to be looking for they were to be waiting on and yet we find that when he came they were not looking for that as a matter of fact they did not look at their lives as though that they needed a change they only looked at it in a manner that when he comes that is just something you know just to bring us on in you know to to the kingdom and what is already here because remember when Jesus would speak to him they let him know very quickly when they went back and they would look at their natural genealogy and they said we are Abraham as our Father and even when they approached John the Baptist remember the Spirit of Truth that was there through John the Baptist he could tell him in that time when they came out to the baptism he said you know who have warned you to flee from the wrath that is to come and you know as they hear they were reasoning within their hearts and John would let him know he would point to the same stones of memorial that was carried out of the Jordan River there when Israel crossed and John would point at those stones that were standing there and say God is able to raise up stones in this place see God has a living witness a living a living reality of what God himself has done they did not see the need that there was needing a change in their life they only went by just a natural stock but Jesus let her know that you know you need to be born again he made it in a statement to let him know that that he who is a servant of sin you your servant but he said the servant does not abide in the house forever but whosoever the Sun is made free is free indeed they needed to be made and free and so when we look at this you know the promise and the scripture brother branham would take it like this and I think it's very very fitting that it would place it in this way brother Brandon would put out three questions when he would go to preach the Holy Ghost series and brother Branham would take it what is the Holy Ghost what it's given for and then he said and then the last the the other service that he would speak on it how do I get the Holy Ghost and how do I know when I have it I'll be honest with you I think that way God moved on Sunday in such a way with such clarity and just to take it from the aspect of to realize that the Holy Ghost you know it's things you always preach but it's just how God has a way of just holding things in and polishing it up because when you look at it the Holy Ghost is never anything that you can merit you do not deserve it it's nothing that you become worthy of it because it is God there's nothing that we can do but it's what God does and I like how it was placed here on Sunday but it is having faith in the very righteousness of God then it's not something that I deserve but it is what God freely gives because the Holy Ghost is not a reward the Holy Ghost is a gift of God it is the promise of God that's given to you and I and even for you and I had to ask for it and to receive it it is because the Holy Ghost has already been dealing with our life to even bring us to a place to actually hunger after that to tell you the truth when you and I were walking out in sin or whether you lived on a church view there was a longing for something that was greater and there was something in your life that you could not explain but there was something that you were desiring and what that desire was that was the very foreknowledge of God there was a seed that was down on the inside that was longing for the waters of life to come to it and raise it up you see it was God that was drawing you and I that's why nothing could satisfy in the world that's why we could not find our place out there no matter what we did there was nothing that was satisfying because there's only one that can satisfy and that is the Lord Jesus Christ you know how it is when you come away from a table after eating when you're satisfied you're satisfied it wouldn't matter what else does that offer you are satisfied that's what the baptism of the Holy Ghost brings in the life of the believer is complete satisfaction it's satisfied now I want to just you know dealing with that even a little more on how do I know when I have it I want to just work here in the scriptures here just a little bit so if you'll just bear with me here we'll see where we get to tonight but in John chapter 3 here is here is Jesus you know brother Branham would lay it out he said this is a fundament this is the most fundamental doctrine here in in the Bible and here you find where one of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews he came to Jesus and verse 2 and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him and jesus answered and said unto Him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God that that's to understand it he can't see the kingdom of God Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born and jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God amen that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee ye must be born again the wind look at this and with a wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth so is every one that is born of the Spirit notice this for every one that is born of the Spirit is just like that of the wind it bloweth where it listeth you hear the sound of it but you cannot tell from whence it cometh and whither it goeth your life is a mystery it's nothing that can be placed within the ID logs of man but it is alive that is placed firmly in the Word of God it is a life that is the very mystery of God the Holy Ghost that has taken a hold within your life to where you in yourself cannot even explain what has taken place but you know that something has happened in you hello and no matter what the enemy would try to say you always wind right back to that place of where you have met God on the sacred sands of God's grace that is your white stone that you have been parted you have received that of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ when there was a court there and the court itself when they would actually take in hear all the accusations when a stone itself would be given there to the to the actual one who was being accused and after the court would render its judgment when the court would render its judgment that there is nothing found against this person they would give to that person a white stone with the name in it and it spoke to them you are innocent you are free and you have been made free and are innocent by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ identified that he has taken your place you know it takes two to make a birth it takes a father and a mother amen this is light when Jesus could say must be born in the water in the spirit you see it's got to be born of the written word confirmed by the spirit you see God brings his word and the word itself what does the word do the word speaks and it draws us it brings conviction to the heart the Holy Spirit brings conviction to the heart the Bible says that man believeth unto salvation and so the Holy Spirit deals with the heart - even that you and I by the gift of God could actually even have faith to believe and then after we believe because you can't get anything from God how do you first believe but then to think how that God would bring that about in our life to where that you and I would believe then this is where Paul could say after he says have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed or having heard the truth the gospel of your salvation after you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise glory be to God now let me just go on here just a moment you know there was some times when we look at it you look at the the direction and I uh you know III know just exactly where you know brother Tim when he was dealing with you know you look at some of the earlier messages in 1960 and I just want to call your attention remember he said I can't do away with them earlier messages you remember that when we recognize this how that brother branham brother Bantam himself never got away even though brother Ram at one time he would talk about the being born again and then he would talk about an endowment of the Holy Spirit and power coming but after the seals were open here I know years ago I went through this here but yeah after the seals were open brother branham to begin to understand in the message the token but the RAM said they are one and the same event he would lead it down into the church age book and let us know he said they are one and the same event but you see there has to first be like brother BAM was calling it they're born again there's got to be a belief or a faith first he that cometh to God must first believe that he is right so it see this is where we must have the discernment of the Holy Ghost because it is true we're not throwing anything away there's no message as we throw away it's got to be divinely placed are you with me because there has to be belief within that word and how that God would bring relief to our lives in our hearts now when you you look at this here in in in you know in in that of the new birth and being born again we recognized that within it it's the same God that's coming to work and to move within our myths because I say it to you like this you know some were kind of you know talking to me there and we were fellowship a little bit you know on Sunday evening in other places and and you know that the reality of it is I think that we can all be in agreements there has been way too much and there has been way too much of just simply things being said I believe the message there's been too much to that this just I believe and that's what the Holy Ghost is trying to point out and declare that that is not enough you must first believe but you know as I preached it over the years and of the unveiling of God the Prophet said if you say you believe it and don't live it then you really don't believe it you're only saying you do you see there's got to come one on the inside of your life I'm talking about the a man of God I'm talking about the Holy Ghost of God that is the punctuation in your soul that says I am a believer and it identifies within there that the word is the truth and our hearts desire is to that word it ain't enough just to know the doctrines this is where many times within the statements here of things that's been made that's been made an error where you heard brother Tim and a lot of these things I've kept from you I've not went through them for things that I have free for a few years here I don't even circulate it I don't put it out here in the church I don't do that but yet there's things that I know that's been said and statements that continue to be said that the tapes are the token that is an error that is not the truth that's a life from the pits of hell it closes people to sell short of the blood of Jesus Christ amen of the Prophet would hear he was skinned the hide off of that thing but he don't have to be here the same one who gave the message his residing in that floor and there's a real experience God's got some gate keepers as it speaks in the Book of Ezekiel that will stand in the gate and say there is a true genuine birth have the Holy Ghost hallelujah hey man and huh you know I don't have nothing against anybody but there's some times where these things and how things can be said of just you know well you know we just believe the message and whatever more you see the scripture let let me just use this here for a moment you recognize that Paul when he would talk about that you know you are sealed he said you you are sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise in Ephesians 1 30 or 113 in Ephesians 4:30 he would go through that now remember the gospel itself would have to be sounded the gospel would have to go out we find that how then many times we've been were statements of brother Branham made in the message the token and the statements that are made such as you know the message is Christ but you see it takes the Holy Ghost to break that out now I know then I know their spirits don't like that because it looks like you got to come to a man to get understanding but there is only one man you got to go to and that's the man Christ Jesus you got to know the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is a discerner he's the one that rightfully divides the world so to say that the message is cries is to recognize that that life the word has pointed you and I the light that is showing in this hour the message points us to a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ that's what it calls us to if not anything less is just an organism of man it's got to be the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and I can't echo it enough of the things that even brother Tim I've stood for that I believe that with all my heart I've had to take I've had to take a stand on those things and it's cost me sometimes but I don't care I love people but friends when you asked me to choose between the Word of God and you I'll take the word Amen there is no one that's to be exalted to the level of the Lord Jesus Christ nobody amen nobody at all how we thank God I thank God for the messenger that he sent through us I thank God for the message but it never came to lead us from the Lord Jesus if it's received right it brings us into a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ well let me get to what else wolfy preaching on now understanding the kingdom that's in you brother Brandon says this improving his word I want you to listen to the statement here he said when you understand it you believe it jesus said except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom in other words understand the kingdom because the kingdom is the Holy Spirit in you so you have to understand what this is in you and the only way you understand it is compare what it makes you do with what the Bible said it would make you do then your problem solved and then he is that Holy Spirit it's like this you get a seed packet and you plate those seeds and say oh boy we're gonna have some good old lettuce here I can just taste the lettuce and tomato and that big ol thick sliced bacon oh my and you go planting them seeds you're looking at the packet that green leaf lettuce you know they put it on there it's got water dripping off of it it just looks so lush and you plant the seeds and when you plant them you don't have green lettuce you end up with red lettuce now when you get to looking at it you're looking at what's coming up and you look at the picture and say that don't look the same you turn it over and the writing that's on there what's coming up does not match the writing so you see when God Himself brings an experience within its life God brings an experience so that that experience that would be so divinely placed in the word so that you're that experience that lets say if the Lord it is placed within the Word of God and it's there that the daffle can't move you off of that now I'm gonna tell you this straight out when you've got the Holy Ghost you can't lose it let's just settle that one right now when you've been sealed you're sealed to the day of your redemption better manna would put it like this you already gone to your eternal destination you see before you've got the Holy Ghost you were a pilgrim and a stranger to the kingdom of God you are of this world but once the Holy Ghost has come that same life that you've been bumping into all your life that you couldn't figure out why this or why that and all of that then finally the Holy Spirit moves down as he deals with your life and he lifts you into that place of that Kingdom that becomes a reality then you become a pilgrim and a stranger to this earth you become a mystic to everybody else and then because we got lights around us I believe that there's times God can show lights around us I know he does that things were people you know they can come over in restaurants or whatever more but Bigard regardless if none of that was done there's a life that ticks out on the inside of us so it is imperative that you understand that you're not leaning to your own understanding any men my ID well you know the devil can try to come and come at you and make you think well that was nothing but you see what when God has done something he can't talk you out of it he cannot take from you what God has given to you no man added to it or taketh away it's what God has done hmm I wish I had about four hours tonight then I might get started with this it's imperative that you understand don't get nervous that you're not leaning to your own understanding but rather to find the place of rest and God's Word that's why the Prophet would Express in the Holy Ghost series you must know what it is what it will do for you and what it is and what it's given for that you that way that you know that you've received it now let me just say this it brings a motion but it's not emotion I wish I could preach on that one a long time maybe Sunday we'll sit down on that it brings emotion brother ban tells us that over and over and over through the message we understand that the Holy Ghost is not emotion the Holy Ghost is the person of Jesus Christ but brother where he's at it's joy Avenue where he's at there are shouting where he's at there is joy unspeakable and full of glory glory be to God so you can't hand me nothing but in any emotion you know I know a person who can say well brother Simon you're just emotional well yeah I am emotional but I'm emotional about the right thing amen I know you know people lack time this preaching I know sometimes people actually take those quotes and they like to run those quotes in the ground well you know you gotta watch what church you're fellowshipping with because you see how the pastor acts the rest of the congregation acts well let's apply this right now would you rather be in a church where a pastor is dead as a doornail and doesn't desire the passion for the Word of God and the presence of God that is my passion I thought you to share in my passion that is my delight that is what I've desire every time we come together the Holy Ghost come right among us [Music] it brings emotion I'm not gonna go through all the quotes on that but brother man would put that in over and over here there's 65 I believe in that I believe you get get alone with God you get the praying don't worry you'll break into another language I don't know you I believe he's the same yesterday today and forever what God put in the church is stealing the church and I'll say it to you like this brother Graham would tell us over and over I'd rather have a little wildfire than no fire at all you condemn heat you can church order Jesus to where he sits with dirty feet I'm not holding back you can do it - he's such a dirty feet everything's got to be this way in that way in everything so uniform I tell you friends it's time to break out of the uniformity it's time to let go and let Jesus have this way so many times people worried about being in order that they need to get loose from that and get out order of their own order samy they're gonna classify you phonetic I don't care I don't care I really don't care I'm not trying to fit into anybody's camp I'm not trying to get into anybody's pulpit it's God's own life coming in you that transforms you from a creature of time to a creature of eternity so then we must as brother Graham tells us they're compared what it makes you do with what the Bible said it would make you do I mean no Paul went down into the deserts of Arabia after he had his experience he went down to the dinner to the deserts of Arabia he wanted to see that experience in the word right you see God will confirm what he has done within the word it's just like what God has sent the message in this hour it is a message that is confirmed by the scriptures it's not outside of the Bible it is confirmed his working in this last day is confirmed in the scriptures and then as it moves in you and I and you and I are in Christ then you and I are placed in the word and this word is confirmed and vindicated through our lives then your problem solved he said that's a Holy Ghost so he says what the person of Christ in you what it makes you do well as I said this is more than believe in every word of God to be true it's more than believing the message is right it's more than believing that brother Branham was a prophet and we believe all those things but it's to identify the working of Christ in your life according to the Word of God in this hour amen so now let me just deal with this just a little bit here the coming of the Holy Ghost you know it's according to the word and it will produce the result of the word in your life you know brother Tim which I appreciated what he shared I appreciated what he shared because you know brother Branham described that it was like filtering rain you know for some it's like fire some of us got electrocuted but then there's others I can go through I've got just a whole study on things it's been four years of things and I've dropped it here and there with you there's times where he can come brother Bram talks about in such a steel form but the brem said it's like that star and when he preached why I think it's why we have seen his stars the one in 63 we have we have seen his star and come to worship Him brother Bama in the latter part of that message brother Brent said old God he said let it be he said like the wise men who saw that star and they followed that star and it passed over every absorb Ettore and nobody knew nothing about it he said God let the star come into the building just now and he said in that steel form he said they pass from death unto life you see it's your experience it's your experience that's exactly right it's your experience that's why they come it I want you to think of this how was so clear there is no set pattern hey man it is personal so that you know and when it happens let me just say like this there's many examples within the message that has taken place where people were going around and you know even different ones you know we're looking like you take sister Bruce sister Bruce asks for the ragam she said brother rammus she said I don't have an experience that I could put my foot on that I got the Holy Ghost so what did brother Adam do he did what I'm doing here tonight he took her to the word he said sister Bruce normally in a person's life you would love the things of the world he sent but no me said normally and naturally that's the way you would be inclined he said but what has happened he said what has happened he said that has changed you that you're not like that she said Christ he said that's your answer that's your answer amen the trans machine because it's his word it's something you can't get away from it's not something you're trying to put on or pretend or make up but it's something that's real on the inside of you I feel like preaching it's God the personal experience with you and even in the refilling of the Holy Ghost I wish I could preach on this one tonight but thank God for the refilling of the Holy Ghost I'll tell you right now has believers I think we realize just how far we've been living beneath our privileges sometimes when we get a little bit of indifferent or this or that I'll tell you what if we don't need to wait to that time to get a refilling but we need to ask God Lord for a refilling a fresh experience every day in our life I'll tell you right now I say this in the name of Jesus Christ I believe this with all my heart that no matter all these things that they have going on out here and these spirits enter a round of oppression and depression and all that I ain't making a lot of nothing like that but friends let me tell you something our real joy and deep satisfaction it's in the Lord Jesus Christ and if we could evaluate and say when's the last time I had a real breakthrough with God then I really set aside I'll tell you right now I believe this with all my heart as he inspires it to my heart right now that God will give you strength and grace and renew the joy of your salvation I believe that with all my heart you must stand on that and believe that amen I believe that this is our god-given rights hallelujah it's the person the Holy Ghost is the person of Jesus Christ coming into our lives that's exactly what it is coming into our lives Amen that quickens that seed it brings it to life there's no other waters can bring it to life amen there's no other waters that can do that but the Holy Ghost amen it's an experience that's founded on the Eternal Word of God that's why our faith would would rest you know the Bible tells us here in Exodus 12 and I'm not going to read long out of this one right here I just want to get get get something here out of Exodus 12 you know God had told him here that in Exodus 12 in verse 5 he told him you you should take a take your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year and you shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats and it goes on to say how you to keep it up and and in the congregation of Israel are killing in the evening verse 7 and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper doorpost of the houses wherein they shall eat so what God's asking them to do is take the life of that lamb and let the life beyond the end let the life be the witness you see the life is a witness death has already visited this house hallelujah it's already visited here then it goes on to talk about the eating of that lamb so your eating of that lamb where the life has come now it goes on to let them know here in verse 12 for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are when I see the Blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt this was God's covenant promise there was nothing do you realize that the death angel it could come right up outside of that door but it could not cross that boundary it could come right up to it brother brems said it like the holy go he said um pardon me he said the devil he said when that seal is upon your life he said the devil can tease at it he can tease at it he said he can try to make you think you're not sealed and then he takes us right down into the evidences but you see what it is he can tease with that but there is something that is real that seal of the Living God that's there upon your soul and Satan cannot cross that he can get close and try to whisper but he cannot cross that blood line God has already spoken this one belongs to me this one is my firstborn grow a metre gone you see it's where then the token itself is the life of God that life that was within that blood now coming coming now back upon the worshiper you know to think of it I just wanted to stay without going into the types in this in this day and age we're living in but in the hour that we're living and you know Luther and Wesley and even pinnacles it was not the time of the seal of the Holy Ghost but now is the hour where the seal is coming on the body because the seal itself is that which signifies a finished work it's time for the bride body to be sealed away for rapturing grace brother God don't send nobody else to seal you he's the one that seals you it's like when they go to Brandon calves and cows and stuff you know I didn't really know they still did it but when I was up at brother Eugene bran he had a little videos of him and ruther Ron Peterson you know they went out there just for what they called relax and man maybe it would be relaxing I don't know but you know they were out there riding the horses those two and and they were out there you know roping you know the calves calves and things like a they didn't have an interest in it it's just they were doing it for you know it has an outlet so you're a roping these calves you know upon this this roundup and you know here they are bringing them right over to the fire and they have to you know one of them has their horse and they're keeping back that mama cow and they bring that one over there to the fire they've got that Brander it is white-hot and when they take it off that fire before that time that calf you could look at that calf and there could be a lot of arguments about who that calf belongs to but once the brand goes on that brother the brand comes from the fire and once the brand goes on it all doubts are settled when the brand goes on it it is God claiming what belongs to him and he impresses his own seal his own life his own the image into that calf no matter where that calf goes its marked put it in this pasture its marked move it from this department at the job to this department still marked you can't get that mark off you don't want to get it off you have been branded by the Holy Ghost amen that blood was on the door was only a type there had to come a lamb an innocent one that would be offered up but then that lamb that lambs blood that was offered up would pay the price and then when that life in that blood it comes back upon you as the worshipper and me and it brings us into that blood cell so then what we have then as brother Branham would play said he said you have it to where now the judge oh my the judge himself has stepped down and become our attorney amen we were under the sentence of death but I judge became our attorney amen his life was shed and now that lie the blood was shed and now that life is set back upon the worshiper listen brother sister for you and I to even believe and how that God has dealt with our life it has not been us that is brought us along when I did this and I did this and I did that that is not true it is what God has done when the Israel comes back into the land for the 144,000 then God said at that time you will recognize me as Jehovah said canoe the Lord is our righteousness he is high righteousness Amen it's him that gives us strength it's him that causes our faith to rise within the promise it's him that directs our eyes away from ourselves like brother Tim was point out so good what I can't wait to preach on another part on that position in practice we might just have to have a revival of services here but you see that token when it's come your fare is paid if the strain ticket cost you five dollars when you you have got the ticket and that ticket you have got the token and what's needed to board that train or that airline or whatever it is and everything that is there belongs to you y'all still with me hey this ain't no pipe dream I'm preaching but some you ever get weary oh I get weary but I'm some when I get weary the Holy Ghost is my joy we get weary you'll get down we get down but listen friends what I'm trying to tell you is just if you begin to call out to God and ask God says Lord restore to me the joy of my salvation you may not even be able to say it real strong you may not even be be able to pray maybe more than five minutes but if from your heart let me tell you something your heart calling out for the Living God like David could say I have longed to see his power of old then I saw in the sanctuary and you have that desire in your heart you might not only be able to get out one sentence but brother and sister what he's listening and looking at is your heart's desire and it's your heart's desire that draws Jesus on the sea now brother branham hearing the message desperation and remember he just preached this message right after the token he's going through the first little bit here where he's dealing with the token what he just preached in the morning listen what he says now he goes he says now not just know certain evidence he makes that statement because when he opened within this he said it was likened to you know in the past he said it was lacking - just accepting Christ as your personal Savior in the Methodist said when you get happy enough to shout the Pentecostal said speaking in tongues you got it and brother Graham said we find out that all of that is wrong so brother Branham you look at he says now not just know certain evidence you're with me but it is alive that is to be founded in the world let me just read to you yeah that would just be better only you say look at this discernment you say brother branham I feel it in your mind's he said why will I know which we would say how will I know how will I know the tokens of what how will I know look what you were and what you are that is how you know what you were and what you are now that's how you know what once you humming what was you before this token was applied what are you after its applied what was your desires before and what is your desires after then you know whether the token is applied or not and these other things speaking in tongues and on and on and these other things just automatically go with that complete package the Holy Ghost is not like picking out a car does it have power windows I know this is like way back in the dinosaur days but does it have a tape deck in it or does it only have an AM radio in it you know I'm saying there's this leather or vinyl does it have air-conditioning in it brother let me tell you something the Holy Ghost is still the same it's not a downgraded package it is the same original package that was torn out on the day of Pentecost save power amen it's the same person the Lord Jesus Christ in this hour you see the Scriptures would say it like this regarding the seal of God it would let us know within the Scriptures even in when it would express in John 627 labor not for meat which Parris's for that meat which endureth but for the meat that endureth unto everlasting life which the Son of man shall give you for him hath God the Father sealed I'm lujah when he came up out of the River Jordan he got branded come on somebody he got branded the same way it happened there is the same way it happens to every son and daughter of God God was claiming what belonged to him this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased brother Brent said where did the Holy Ghost fall in Corinth own sons where did it fall on the day of Pentecost own sons and daughters see this is why however the Holy Ghost if it's at if it's at an altar let it be in an altar come on now if it's at your seat let it be at your seat you know the Bible right here through the book of Acts I'm so glad that was included that way it was included that way to let you know there ain't no set pattern but it's when the heart itself begins to cry out for the Living God because we could cry out here but brother it ain't here that he's here and it's down here on the inside he was hearing that asking on the inside that's what it was when he went to the house of Cornelius and it began to preach the word and the Bible says while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them you know why the Holy Spirit that was there within Peter and Muslim Jim was there ministering that word there are hearts that were open they were ready to move with the word and the Holy Ghost it's all within their heart a complete obedience in the word are you with me now they hadn't even been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but God already saw their obedience remember he gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey Him and God looks at the obedience of the heart because what's in the heart will come out in the actions [Applause] clover be the god this is why he was sealed remember he let him know I have not honor of myself but my father honoureth me this is why Paul could say for all the promise of second Corinthians 1:20 for all the promises of God in him are yay and in him Amen unto the glory of God by us now he which stabbed lathis established us with you in Christ and hath anointed us is God who has also sealed us and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts Colossians 3:3 for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall you also appear with him in glory so Christianity that token that life that new birth it shows wherever you're going it don't matter if you go to school it don't matter where you work it don't matter where it's that it declares itself in your life you've been branded you've been sealed by the Holy Ghost of promise you know the Bible says it like this in first Corinthians 12:3 he said no man can call Jesus Lord but by the Holy Ghost he is the Lord of my life and you see as even as we proclaim that our lives proclaim that he is the Lord of my life he came in and he overthrew all the things of the world in my life amen he sat down on the throne of my heart he is the love of my life and as what we just read Christ who is our life he is our life you see that's why that's why what God did on Sunday what he's done in other services but loving just Helen in our own Sunday it's not something that you can just walk away from you know why because you've been united you've got United with the person of Jesus Christ maybe if we suddenly got reacquainted Amen revival struck in the hearts and said you know what everything else nothing else matters he's the love of my life that's what matters more than anything else you love him Oh glory be to God it declares in our life that he is the lord of this temple oh my you know we're not pretending I remember that I said I remember that I remember when I was trying to do right but I also remember when he came I didn't even know what it happened I didn't even know what had taken place but you know what God would show me eventually what had taken place in my life but you see the reality was that the fruits had come in my life oh go to be to God oh he says but once he comes it's just as easy to live a Christian life as it is to live any life because you're in Christ and nothing else but just so full of the Holy Spirit it leads you guide you and direct you hallelujah amen glory be to God Amen hallelujah can let me announce to you you have reached the point of no return there is no going back once you come out of your mother's womb in the natural in your first birth there's no going back and once you have come out of the loins of God's word you've been born in the Spirit of God there's no going back brother you have been born again you've been changed by the quickening power of Almighty God there's no going back greater is He that is in you than he that's in the world hallelujah glory be to God in the highest there's no point of no return hallelujah hallelujah will repeat of God no longer the same again your nature has been changed by the power of the Living God amen though we had no Christ in the flesh though we have known the flesh henceforth we know him not after the flesh therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new [Applause] you're a creation of the Living God always was a son and daughter of Almighty God but the Holy Ghost has told you he bids you come home the angel of the Lord dealt with your heart get with my heart he brings us back to himself and that Holy Ghost moving down there in that life oh it calls a lot it cleans that life it feels that life it changes that life there's a new outlook on life oh the old things are passed away all things have become new you're a paradox then I said you're a paradox then glory be to God it isn't what you did it's what he did amen this is what Jesus could say I've come that you might have life and I come that you might have it more abundantly oh brother and sister you think it was a paradox when they crossed the Jordan when they crossed the Red Sea brother let me tell you something that was only a tight and a shadow of the great paradox of the new birth where the Lord Jesus himself moves down because every time there is sheep born the Shepherd on duty he is the chief attending physician on duty he gets the dripline going hey man he gets the dripline going the contractions start coming the contractions start coming the contractions start didn't closer together everything start getting closer together what's happening everything's lining up amen amen amen and they're getting closer together and about that time here it comes fourth and then on the certificate of birth brought to life by Jesus Christ himself hey hey man the chief Shepherd is on duty bringing life to his children something happened brother Brennan said something happened to you that changed your whole being and anyone could look at that and know what a paradox that is oh my glory he said unless that happens you can't be a Christian there's got to be a paradox for you to be a Christian it's a miracle how that God can take a man's thinking his ways his life everything and change it from what it was to what it can be and what he can make it jesus said through John he said love not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world or the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father but is of the world you see it takes God to bring that deliverance in that change in our lives and he he doesn't baptize us into a church he baptizes us into himself and he is the word he don't ask us to try to understand it he just says believe it let me tell you something when the prodigal son go I'm getting ahead of time now when the prodigal son hear I didn't we'll deal with this tonight but in the prodigal son come back you see there had to be that of the mercy of Almighty God his father and you know what it would raise him to places he never even imagined possible or thought that he was deserving of brother let me tell you something the Holy Ghost it raises you and I to a place that we never even thought of we never even looked at and can never even brought ourselves to deserving of it but you and I were like him I have sinned I had come short but in the midst of that time the father said bring forth the best robe I want you to put shoes on his feet I want you to put a ring on his finger you always a son always a daughter you might have went a long time before you could be recognized as one but it takes the seal of the Holy Ghost to come upon you and say this one's mine this belongs to me and when he does that it positions you in him in the word and you recognize yourself dead you are alive in him and you are a son and daughter of God let me tell you something you don't get a little trickle of the Holy Ghost you're a full-fledged member let me just finish this out here a little bit hallelujah brother Brown would say like this and standing in the gap and I got to read this little part here so I can get to the last part he said you know he said he's the only mediator between God and man and we're freely pardon and forgiving God don't even know we ever sinned our sins were put in the sea of forgetfulness never to be remembered no more we cannot do that ourselves we're finite he's infinite and I find that we can still remember because we're not big enough let me just pause it right here if he tries to bring up your past I think the word of the Lord already went forth here Saturday morning you tack his hide with Ezekiel 18 he can't bring up anything from the past because once the only ghost has come rather your past you're not even connected to it I don't care what it is that has been done when the Holy Ghost has come you know what the Holy Ghost does the Holy Ghost it is that of that hidden man in the heart he has your years he's there and your life and the word are connected together there's no longer a breach a chasm between you and the word but he has spanned that chasm there is no longer anything hidden there her cat between you and God you have been brought back into fellowship with God you say wonder what if I make a mistake you've got an advocate with the father and I ain't even preaching on that tonight you see why we need to have we need to have a whole month of services but I'm sure we'll get to it Gloria you know I want to capitalize on these things I'm gonna do I'm gonna capitalize on let's try let's drive the nail down so happy as we're walking because let me tell you something I told I reminded some on Sunday night and at the house I said you remember I said years ago now that was the back in 2009 or 2010 in a youth meeting it was 2009 here it was at that time brother Brian he's one of them that remembers he was there in that youth meaning back in 2009 in my house we were upstairs in that floor and I had been ministering to them about you know moving on into the things of God and just really just calling out to God and that God would open our eyes of understanding and God would you know reveal himself we begin to just you know those things and then I think it was Brian Brian was given a testimony and then as he was given a testimony I tell you as he was given that testimony within that if I recall it correctly here all of a sudden within that little place in that other house then we were living in the Holy Ghost came right down in that living room there were some that were sitting in chairs they hit the floor within that time the power of God fell it broke into a prayer meeting I mean it was just an all-out prayer meeting when we came to out of that I don't know how long it was but I told him at that time I said from now on these youth meetings will never be the same brother they ain't never been the same since then oh we've had a lot of opposition then the devil has wanted to try to rattle his head here and there but I'll tell you what I think God for there are young people that say we're gonna stand shoulder to shoulder we're gonna stand Co to tell and let me tell you something right now the same God that did that there I believe that and I declare that right here for this church the church can never be the same never be the same brother branham said he's so great that he forgets sin we are sons and daughters in his presence he become your sin that you might become his righteousness so he said God cannot see no sin in you as long as your confession is in Christ Jesus you know why because your desire is to please him I do only those things which please the father now brother family let me just let me just finish it he said now somebody said to me after brother remedy that statement if I believed a thing like that how would ever I turn the steam on I paint the town red I'd go to every dancehall I'd get so drunken everything for the breath said why you're already secured in Christ what difference does it make he said I told I told that person that shows you haven't got it if I really okay if I had that kind of Liberty I would do this and I would do that but you see when real Liberty has come you do what you want to do the only thing your wants has been changed oh yeah glory to God if the love of God ever struck your heart in the tenderness of Jesus Christ you would be so in love with him the world would be dead as your sin that's how you know you have the Holy Spirit not because you scream shout speak in tongues or whatever it is and we believe all that I said we believe all that but when sin becomes dead and you're alive in Jesus Christ old love of God how rich and how pure let's just stop with that tonight over and over when Jesus when he when he come Psalms forty know I come in the volume of the book to do that which is written to me I delight to do thy will O God so here it was a delight the desire to do that will have not come down from heaven to do mine own but the will of my father what you say see the Spirit of Truth when he has come the Bible says he will lead us into all truth he opens and unfolds the word to our heart you say no brother Sam I don't understand everything that's not what we're talking about it's where he begins to take the word and make it real to you you're a part of it he's a part of you [Music] it's a love-letter the Bible says His commandments are not Grievous you still how to battle this but that's why you gotta have power power you're in dude with power from on high it brings this guy in line remember Paul said I die daily is that right Jesus said that a man should take up his cross daily we've got a died to self daily but because of that death and that life was come then it equips us to continue to die to self that he might live his life through us [Music] they ask the chief one time after he got the Holy Ghost they asked the chief they said chief how you doing he said well sometimes me good sometimes me do bad so what do you mean well is that since we got the Holy Ghost I got two dogs I've got a white dog and a black dog well chief which one wins he said it depends on which one she feeds the most now feeding that black dog isn't always where isn't always where you're feeding it sometimes it's the neglect of the white dog give your attention to the white dog let him be the pick and you see [Music] as you have that white dog you feed it on the things of God now this is the way that you'll starve that black dog to death don't give place to the devil see what do you mean by that if he raises his tongue but raises his tongue in accusation and he wants to raise it as though nothing even has transpired or taken place I know he can't remove that seal but you want to remain our an effective witness cast down imaginations you just got all excited you call him a liar don't you entertain that if there's something that comes even by the word something even as you're reading your hearing or it is something that God comes and he speaks to your heart and it challenge your heart what do I do take that to God in prayer say lord I don't understand this but has a son of God or a daughter of God lord help me to understand this because it's personal between you and him let that white dog rise in strength don't have nothing to do with the things where God has brought you from oh that's gone the things of the world has passed away feed that white dog think on things of a good report meditate on the Word of God pray read get into the message get into the word the sign I can't figure it on it's not about you figuring it all out just feed your experience you start feeding your experience and pretty soon that white dog boy it's more muscular than a pit bull in a Rottweiler put together it just starts growing their muscles pretty soon that old black dog it turns into one them little old miniature - Wallace running around and yet you get you feed that Holy Ghost feed that Holy Ghost amen later - see that is in you than he that's in the world you see you know there's a difference you know there's a difference that even when you would go to when you would get down or you get discouraged you can't deny the life that is in it's a living reality it breaks every hold every hole is a powder I hope it made a little sense tonight you can look right there in the word my experience is founded in the word it's not emotion but it brings the emotion you know friends I just want to even more fervently serve God I want more I want more I want more of him Oh hallelujah is free dear Jesus more tonight under the sound of my voice their God if there's one that doesn't have that life tonight father may be a young person may be old I don't know that God tonight may they just reach up Lord may they take a hold by faith and let them see their God what's for may then be so determined never to live below their god-given privileges god I pray tonight as your word Lord would come Lord you interpret your own working in our lives it's solidified you know where we're standing standing in you Lord Jesus we turn our eyes to you we're not even focused or not to even entertain what others might think we just love you Lord Jesus what do we don't want no formalities we just want more of you Lord God how we thank you in these services you

Ghost Lord Jesus and access a fresh experience day by day Lord their God I pray may it be so resolute and determined in our hearts not to live below our god-given privileges but maybe Lord God every day every day Lord looking to you every time when we come to the house of God Lord we're not trying to reproduce another service we're more we're more mature than that we realized that would only be a tradition but what we realize the Lord is that we can have more of you and we want more of you Lord God we're asking Lord God the Father as you would come Lord through your word by your spirit that
