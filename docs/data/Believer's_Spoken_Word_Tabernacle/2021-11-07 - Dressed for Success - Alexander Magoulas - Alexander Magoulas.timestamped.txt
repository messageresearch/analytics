[38:43] people they must be a praying group of

[38:49] things yesterday for the service and i
[38:51] had a direction i wanted to go and the
[38:53] lord spoke to me about a different kind
[38:55] of a thought and
[38:56] well i'll just be real honest i'm like
[38:58] well that you know it wasn't what my
[39:00] opinion was so i just assumed it was my
[39:01] imagination

[39:05] but as the lord just began to deal with
[39:06] deal with me and stuff and i got up this
[39:08] morning i looked i said well that's just

[40:02] and peter knew
[40:03] father today how we're needing soldiers
[40:06] how are we needing men and women of god
[40:08] with a backbone to endure hardness to
[40:10] soldiers and to stand and having done on
[40:13] this evil day to stand may they put on
[40:16] the whole armor of god even today as
[40:18] they've risen up out of their pews may
[40:20] they rise above the things of this world
[40:22] may they rise above the expectations
[40:25] that the enemy has placed upon them for
[40:27] for defeat
[40:29] for for for them to go down in flames
[40:31] but today there's a bride of christ
[40:33] that's been ordained to rise above the
[40:35] things of this world father i pray in
[40:37] jesus name you just bless the minister
[40:39] of the word help me now to move out of
[40:41] the way come and speak that which is

[40:48] you'd receive great glory and honor in
[40:51] our midst may you watch over the pastor
[40:53] today as he's out ministering may you
[40:55] help him to deliver the heart of god to

[41:11] praise now in jesus christ's name
[41:14] amen god bless you the book of second
[41:17] kings this morning
[41:20] have you turn here
[41:23] into
[41:26] the second chapter
[41:29] thank you lord jesus
[41:38] second kings in the second chapter we're
[41:40] going to read verses 8 to 14.
[41:43] so
[41:44] i preached this a while back at the home
[41:46] church
[41:47] brother brian erickson he comes up to me
[41:49] afterwards and he says you know you used
[41:52] the same title for another sermon one
[41:53] time i said oh well that's embarrassing
[41:56] i said what did i preach about i said i
[41:57] don't remember i said well i guess you
[41:59] need to hear it again
[42:00] so i don't think i've used this
[42:03] but it was just it's interesting how god
[42:04] can take a text
[42:06] the word of god is amazing god you could
[42:08] he can take the same scripture and it
[42:09] just unfolds into a different thought
[42:11] all the time i thought you know it's
[42:12] amazing how god can take this and go so
[42:14] many different directions with this and
[42:16] so i believe god come to right where
[42:18] you're at today whatever your direction
[42:20] is god is not ignorant of your address
[42:22] or where you live you can go right there
[42:24] amen you can take the same scripture
[42:25] that men have read for thousands of
[42:27] years and it can make it personal to you
[42:29] today amen so that wasn't a warning that
[42:32] was an encouragement to you
[42:34] second kings in the second chapter we
[42:36] would read verse 8 to 14 here
[42:39] and hopefully my coffee kicks in here
[42:41] soon not too much um let's see here uh
[42:45] verse 14 it says so he departed from
[42:47] elisha and came to his master who said
[42:50] to him what said elisha to thee
[42:53] i'm sorry i went to the last verse see i
[42:55] told you i'm i'm a mess here verse eight
[42:59] you know what i'm in the wrong chapter i
[43:01] even bookmarked it well you pray for
[43:03] this old guy i told you i was a mess but
[43:05] i didn't realize there was a hot mess
[43:06] here
[43:08] and elijah took his elijah took his
[43:10] mantle and wrapped it together and smote
[43:13] the waters and they were divided hither
[43:15] in feather so that the two they too went
[43:18] over on dry ground and it came to pass
[43:20] when they were gone over that elijah
[43:22] said unto elisha ask what i shall do for
[43:25] thee before i be taken away from thee
[43:28] and elisha said i pray thee let a double
[43:30] portion of thy spirit be upon me and he
[43:33] said thou hast asked a hard thing you
[43:35] know i think god likes it sometimes when
[43:37] we ask hard things amen everybody asks
[43:39] him for easy things somebody's going to
[43:41] ask him for something impossible because
[43:43] god wants to show he does the impossible
[43:44] amen
[43:45] thou has asked me a hard thing
[43:48] nevertheless if thou see me when i am
[43:51] taken from thee it shall be so unto thee
[43:54] but if not it shall not be so and it
[43:57] came to pass as they still went on and
[43:59] talked to behold there appeared a
[44:01] chariot of fire and horses of fire
[44:04] imparted them both asunder and elijah
[44:06] went up by a whirlwind into heaven and
[44:09] elisha saw and cried my father my father
[44:12] the chariot of israel and the horsemen
[44:15] thereof and he saw him no more and he
[44:18] took hold of his own clothes and wrapped
[44:20] them in two pieces he took up also the
[44:23] mantle of elijah that fell from him and
[44:26] went back and stood by the bank of
[44:29] jordan and he took the mantle of elijah
[44:31] that fell from him and smote the waters
[44:35] and said where is the lord god of elijah
[44:38] and when he also had smit in the waters
[44:41] they parted hither and thither and
[44:44] elisha went over may the lord bless the
[44:46] reading of his word and shall be seated
[44:48] this morning
[44:49] i'd like to take from my text or my
[44:51] thought this morning dressed for success
[44:54] i've been dressed for success
[44:56] amen we look at brother branham he he
[44:58] speaks about the adoption and of course
[45:00] throughout the series in his ministry he
[45:02] speaks about adoption and he mentions
[45:04] that there's a special robe that is
[45:07] given to a son when he's being
[45:08] recognized as a as an adopted son he
[45:11] makes different illusions to this robe
[45:13] and the scripture makes different
[45:14] illusions different places when we look
[45:16] at christ and his own transfiguration
[45:19] and his appearance and his reignment
[45:20] changes and he's glorified before his
[45:22] disciples and we see adoption in christ
[45:25] in the changing of his appearance even
[45:28] his identification as the son of god
[45:30] amen and we we look at this as a group
[45:33] of believers the scripture tells us that
[45:35] we also are going to be clothed in
[45:38] immortality with glorious bodies likened
[45:41] unto his own well that i feel better
[45:43] about that already because i know how
[45:44] confused this one was you just saw it
[45:46] amen man i just have a hard time getting
[45:48] out of bed amen but one day i'm gonna be
[45:50] clothed upon from on high with
[45:52] immortality i'm not gonna get mixed up
[45:55] in my words i'm not gonna have to worry
[45:56] about back pain and heartaches and
[45:58] discouragement and all this the stuff
[46:00] that this pest house carries i'm gonna
[46:02] have a glorious body likened unto his
[46:05] own amen the scripture says for we know
[46:08] that if our earthly house of this
[46:10] tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[46:13] building of god and house not made with
[46:16] hands eternal in the heavens for in this
[46:19] we groan
[46:20] earnestly desire i tell you what i'm
[46:22] earnestly desire and i desired it before
[46:24] but the older i get the more i earnestly
[46:25] desire it i really want it i'm really
[46:28] fed up with this one
[46:30] hey man i've got i've got all this stuff
[46:32] boiling in me from my ancestor and i'm
[46:34] just sick of it amen
[46:36] amen but i'm earnestly designed we are
[46:38] earnestly desiring amen
[46:40] earnestly desiring to be clothed upon
[46:44] with our house which is from heaven if
[46:46] so be that being clothed we shall not be
[46:50] found naked for we that are in this
[46:52] tabernacle do groan
[46:54] being burdened
[46:57] not for that we would be unclothed but
[46:59] closed upon that mortality might be
[47:03] swallowed up in life
[47:05] amen so this idea it's an exhaustive
[47:08] subject i couldn't get to it all one
[47:10] service amen but this idea there's so
[47:12] many different illusions even throughout
[47:13] the scripture of garments you look at
[47:15] the garments of high priests and the
[47:17] blind bartimaeus and these different
[47:18] things and you know jesus tells a story
[47:20] about the wedding and we know about the
[47:21] wedding garment amen i believe we have a
[47:23] wedding garment today the holy ghost is
[47:26] a wedding garment for the believer that
[47:27] when the wedding supper comes we don't
[47:29] have to be ashamed and then there's not
[47:31] gonna be one fault in the believer amen
[47:33] when christ when god looks at us through
[47:36] the veil of the blood of christ he
[47:38] doesn't see your faults he doesn't see
[47:40] your mistakes he doesn't see your
[47:41] mishaps he doesn't see the things that
[47:43] you see
[47:45] you see things in you and sometimes you
[47:47] would disqualify yourself said i don't
[47:50] know how it's gonna be lord he's not
[47:52] looking at what you're looking at he's
[47:53] looking at the sea that's laying on the
[47:55] inside
[47:57] amen he has a desire to clothe that with
[48:00] immortality because it's his seat amen
[48:04] listen it's not you the person it's the
[48:06] attribute he placed in you the attribute
[48:08] in you is greater than your humanity
[48:11] it's greater than your misgivings it's
[48:13] greater than your flesh it's greater
[48:14] than your inability
[48:16] praise the lord somebody
[48:18] well you ought to feel pretty good about
[48:20] that amen
[48:21] that we're not going to be final wanting
[48:22] amen listen you can have a position in
[48:24] the church you can quote every quote and
[48:27] you can be gifted amen but only that
[48:29] wedding garment is going to count on
[48:31] that day he wants to see it represented
[48:33] there amen
[48:35] praise the lord somebody
[48:37] listen he haven't he even had a friend
[48:39] show up but the friend didn't have the
[48:41] garment on and was cast out amen so we
[48:43] want to make sure like queen esther we
[48:45] want to come before the king according
[48:47] to the commandment of the king what does
[48:49] he desire what is he looking for if he's
[48:51] looking for the holy ghost
[48:53] if he's looking for this message to be
[48:55] on display in our lives then the only
[48:57] thing that's going to matter to him is
[48:59] the token over our lives amen it's not
[49:02] enough to preach about a token it's not
[49:04] enough to say we believe in a token it
[49:06] must be on display in our lives it must
[49:09] adorn us we must adorn this gospel in
[49:13] our lives
[49:16] amen
[49:17] you know brotherhood tells this story
[49:18] we're familiar with it this boy he uh he
[49:20] come from the armor company there and he
[49:22] was coming back in a year to marry that
[49:24] girl we know that story and we we preach
[49:25] about that story and you know the people
[49:27] they made fun of this girl and you know
[49:29] brother bam talks about you know she
[49:31] couldn't even afford the dress
[49:34] i want you to understand this garment
[49:36] that we're talking about this this
[49:37] wedding garment you couldn't even afford
[49:39] to buy it if you wanted to
[49:42] see sometimes we try to pay the price
[49:44] sometimes we think we're going to buy
[49:45] our way in well you know there's many
[49:47] that will come to him in that day well
[49:48] i've done this and i've done that listen
[49:51] she couldn't even afford to buy the
[49:53] dress amen
[49:55] but brother braham says he was looking
[49:57] for virtue not clothes
[50:00] he had enough money to buy all the
[50:02] clothes was necessary he says god don't
[50:05] care how big your fancy things you have
[50:07] he owns everything in the world so he
[50:10] wants virtue he wants something that's
[50:14] real
[50:15] [Applause]
[50:16] listen don't ever take that for granted
[50:18] well i don't have this and i'm not that
[50:19] you know brother branham talks about
[50:20] this well i wish i was a billy graham i
[50:22] wish i could be an oral roberts and he
[50:24] said sometimes the devil just laughed at
[50:26] that
[50:27] and then but life is what makes the
[50:29] difference
[50:31] i mean don't ever take that for granted
[50:32] because the world will will wave every
[50:34] kind of a thing in front of you today
[50:35] it'll laugh and call you names and say
[50:37] listen we can provide you with the
[50:39] material you need to make a better
[50:41] looking dress but the only material
[50:43] that'll clothe you is this word
[50:46] amen he doesn't need anything that human
[50:49] instrumentality can offer amen we don't
[50:52] lack for the material tonight that's
[50:54] what the message has come for right amen
[50:56] and then it astounds me men they'll read
[50:58] this message they'll listen to the
[50:59] prophet and then they begin to look for
[51:01] other things why they're looking for
[51:03] something else listen i've got
[51:05] everything i need
[51:06] to make it into a wedding supper
[51:09] i've got everything i need for the
[51:10] garment amen this bride she has taken
[51:13] the material this word she has taken
[51:15] this message she has fashioned this
[51:17] garment she has made herself ready
[51:21] with what's been provided to her
[51:24] amen
[51:26] i believe that's what the bride's been
[51:27] provided amen brother bam said that that
[51:29] the scripture tells us amen the ministry
[51:32] of malachi fort brother graham said what
[51:33] was it his great hope he said that that
[51:36] god would allow me to take the clothes
[51:38] of this word and dress this bride with
[51:40] the clothes of this word now i want to
[51:42] ask you the question did he do it
[51:46] see this is the question it's not could
[51:48] he do it or will he do it did he already
[51:51] do it
[51:53] because if he already did there's
[51:54] nothing else for you to do he's provided
[51:56] everything that's why the prophet said
[51:58] when you receive the baptism of the holy
[52:01] ghost everything you need is in you even
[52:04] the rapture is already in you
[52:07] so we don't have to go look for we're
[52:08] not looking for him in the desert we're
[52:10] not looking for him in the bed chamber
[52:12] the kingdom is in you now
[52:14] by the holy ghost
[52:17] amen
[52:19] amen brother man preaches the sermon the
[52:20] seed shall not be heir with the shock is
[52:22] that listen did they separate is the
[52:25] question today amen they're not
[52:27] separating they've already separated
[52:30] amen the life has already left the shock
[52:33] and gone into the sea there's nothing
[52:35] left out there for you to find life
[52:38] amen i asked you the question they asked
[52:40] him at the grave that day when jesus got
[52:42] out of the grave why would you seek the
[52:44] living among the dead
[52:47] if there's no life in it then it's not
[52:49] worth nothing to you amen
[52:52] praise the lord somebody it's all in the
[52:54] seed now and what is the seed but the
[52:56] representation that the life that went
[52:58] in the ground has come back in its full
[53:00] maturity
[53:02] it's come back in the fullness of its
[53:03] power it's back in the fullness of its
[53:05] maturity amen it's identified by the
[53:08] seed amen the tear and the wheat were
[53:10] not identified till the seed come out
[53:13] amen
[53:14] you look at abram and this type of
[53:15] adoption and brother bram talks about
[53:17] how he nurse from el shadda el shaddai
[53:20] the breasted one because it looked like
[53:23] it looked like in the natural he was
[53:24] getting weaker all the time
[53:26] amen see you look at the natural you
[53:28] look at yourself i feel like i'm just i
[53:30] i'm getting weaker all the time well we
[53:32] are naturally speaking i mean once you
[53:34] hit 25 brother bram said you can eat all
[53:36] the right foods you can you can do all
[53:38] the right things you can run on the
[53:39] treadmill you can do all this but
[53:40] somewhere your body's on a decline
[53:42] somewhere
[53:44] how we'd like to stop that how we'd like
[53:46] to turn back the wheels of time and go
[53:48] back but listen you and i can't do that
[53:50] but we're getting a body one day
[53:52] and listen it's actually better
[53:55] this picture that was taken to you
[53:57] before the foundation of the world it
[53:58] wasn't taken when you were 18 it wasn't
[54:01] taken at your best it was taken before
[54:03] the foundation of the world
[54:06] you're actually going back you're
[54:07] getting something better man it looks
[54:09] like you're getting weaker but you're
[54:11] nursing from the blessed one else to die
[54:14] gaining strength all the time
[54:16] your body might be weak your your
[54:18] abilities might be weaker but your faith
[54:21] is waxing strong
[54:22] abraham's faith grew with an expectation
[54:26] as time went on he knew the promise
[54:28] would be fulfilled in his life amen amen
[54:32] god comes along brother talks about this
[54:34] god comes along says i'm the father of
[54:36] all creation elohim and now i'm going to
[54:38] take abram i'm going to make him a
[54:40] father of nations i'm going to put my
[54:42] own name into his name
[54:45] i'm going to breathe my own life into
[54:46] his name and place it there i'm going to
[54:48] place think about it i'm going to place
[54:50] my name in his name and i'm gonna place
[54:53] him and i'm gonna put my breath into him
[54:55] that's what paul says in the fourth
[54:56] chapter of the book of galatians he says
[54:58] a child when he's just a child he
[55:01] doesn't differ anything from a servant
[55:04] amen there's no identification the wheat
[55:06] looks just like the tears it looks the
[55:08] same amen we can look through seven
[55:10] church changes and sometimes we can
[55:12] scratch our head because it looks like
[55:14] there's so much carnality it looks like
[55:16] there's so much of man involved how
[55:17] could god bring this forth to pass but
[55:19] it wasn't their humanity it was the seed
[55:22] that was in them it was moving forward
[55:26] all the time and in this day
[55:29] in this hour you sitting here today in
[55:32] 2021 the seed is no longer just being
[55:35] carried it's been manifested
[55:40] amen
[55:42] brother brahm says this
[55:44] he said that he came to place abraham
[55:46] and he did it by changing his name he
[55:48] placed him why it was an identification
[55:51] to him amen paul says when that child
[55:53] becomes of age he's no longer a servant
[55:56] but he's a son and if a son he's an heir
[55:59] of god through christ
[56:02] amen today we are the sons of god behold
[56:05] now are we the sons of god it doesn't
[56:08] appear what we shall be but when he
[56:10] shall appear
[56:11] i believe he's appeared to us i believe
[56:13] christ has come by the message of the
[56:16] hour to give us an identification
[56:18] because who he is is who she is
[56:21] she is right now bone of his bone word
[56:24] of his word flesh of his flesh powers
[56:26] power she's the flesh of him and the
[56:29] spirit of him she is him
[56:32] the same word that spoke of this
[56:34] bridegroom it speaks of the bride today
[56:36] she's been identified as an heir of god
[56:39] and a joint heir with christ
[56:42] amen but the brahman says we've had
[56:44] churches churches we've had bride's
[56:46] brides listen everybody claims to be a
[56:48] bride or a church or something amen
[56:50] everybody makes claims but this is not a
[56:53] man making a claim this is not even a
[56:55] prophet making a claim this is god
[56:57] making a claim over you
[56:59] you didn't make this claim about you you
[57:01] didn't call brother bill you didn't call
[57:03] yourself the virtuous sinless bride of
[57:05] jesus christ he called you that amen
[57:08] is that right brother paul he didn't say
[57:10] oh you didn't sit here and i got you
[57:12] know what i wrote this book i said all
[57:13] these good things about myself everybody
[57:15] does that
[57:16] and then every every october and
[57:18] november we hear a bunch of politicians
[57:20] tell us how good they are
[57:22] hey man well we're gonna do this and
[57:23] we're gonna do that and the buck stops
[57:25] here except when it doesn't
[57:27] hey man oh they all can they can all
[57:29] pronounce their own virtue but this is
[57:32] something that god has said about you i
[57:34] didn't make this claim i didn't make
[57:36] this promise you didn't say this listen
[57:39] you're not obligated to fulfill it god
[57:41] spoke it god put it in your life brother
[57:44] brian god pronounce this it's god's it's
[57:48] it's his that he has to bring to pass
[57:49] amen
[57:51] listen a child don't raise himself
[57:53] can you imagine some child who live in
[57:54] arizona no god said the tudor
[57:57] god brought a church through church ages
[58:00] and what was it to do this was god think
[58:02] about this this bride that's sitting
[58:04] here today you are god's achievement
[58:10] you got to wake up in the morning look
[58:11] in the mirror
[58:12] after you
[58:13] get your coffee and pull all the sleep
[58:15] out of your eyes so you know what
[58:16] there's god's achievement
[58:19] some of you felt that way before you got
[58:20] saved
[58:22] you ought to feel that way once you do
[58:23] get saved amen praise the lord somebody
[58:27] oh my she's a dennis listen and i want
[58:30] you to understand this idea of
[58:31] identification because this this shows
[58:33] the maturity of the identification there
[58:35] is no identification of the child until
[58:38] they come of age
[58:40] and then so it shows the spirit of the
[58:42] age that we're and we're not just under
[58:43] justification under luther
[58:44] sanctification we've come to the
[58:46] maturity of the word
[58:48] amen he's placed his name in you listen
[58:51] he made the distinction that's why
[58:53] brother branham says i don't call you
[58:54] church i call you bride he made the
[58:56] distinction you didn't do i'm not
[58:58] calling myself bride the prophet my
[59:00] inspiration called me the bride i'm not
[59:03] just a bridesbridge you're not just
[59:04] another church another bride you're the
[59:06] bride of christ
[59:08] your missus jesus christ put his name in
[59:11] you you're the provided place of worship
[59:14] what makes you the provided place of
[59:15] worship he put his name in you
[59:19] like he did with abraham he placed you
[59:22] and he called you out seven church
[59:24] changes they didn't know who they were
[59:26] in the scripture but a ministry comes at
[59:28] the end time and places them and it
[59:31] places us we're not walking around
[59:33] presuming and probing and wondering but
[59:36] today we know who they are and who we
[59:39] are under the opening of the seals we
[59:41] know who we are
[59:43] god's not left one thing off today
[59:46] praise the lord somebody
[59:50] but the ramp says his reign talk about
[59:51] christ
[59:52] they're on the mount transfiguration it
[59:54] says his raiment shine like the sun a
[59:56] special robe a special anointing
[59:59] amen listen you've got a special
[1:00:00] anointing the rest of the world chases
[1:00:02] all these anointings wow we need this
[1:00:04] anointing we want the anointing hitler
[1:00:06] was anointed
[1:00:08] khrushchev was anointed but you've got a
[1:00:11] special anointing
[1:00:13] this is the anointing that come down
[1:00:14] from aaron's beard
[1:00:16] this is where god commanded the blessing
[1:00:18] even life forevermore amen
[1:00:22] he says when they looked up they saw him
[1:00:24] shining in the glory of god and the
[1:00:25] voice said this is my beloved son hear
[1:00:29] ye him
[1:00:31] he says oh my what god wants to do with
[1:00:33] the church tonight wants to do with an
[1:00:35] individual find somebody he says the
[1:00:37] holy spirit is searching to find men
[1:00:41] probably heard me say this before but i
[1:00:43] make i've made this statement the past
[1:00:45] said you know if you think about it
[1:00:46] satan's just imitating god they're doing
[1:00:48] the same thing
[1:00:49] hey man satan's looking to and fro
[1:00:52] is that right he's looking to and fro
[1:00:54] trying to find somebody to devour but
[1:00:55] the eyes of the lord are also looking to
[1:00:57] and fro he's looking for somebody
[1:01:00] whose heart is perfect toward him to
[1:01:03] show himself mighty
[1:01:05] why did god look for you
[1:01:07] why did god come to you it wasn't to
[1:01:10] leave you in defeat it wasn't abandoning
[1:01:12] you he wants to show himself mighty on
[1:01:15] your behalf
[1:01:18] that's his purpose he didn't come to
[1:01:20] show you failure and inability and
[1:01:23] weakness and fear he came to show you
[1:01:25] courage and ability and power
[1:01:28] [Applause]
[1:01:31] he says what god wants to do with the
[1:01:33] church what he wants to do with an
[1:01:34] individual find somebody the holy spirit
[1:01:36] is searching to find men he can take him
[1:01:38] out to a certain place speak to that
[1:01:40] person anoint them and give them
[1:01:42] something special great powers and gifts
[1:01:44] to work his will
[1:01:46] notice why to work his will and to do
[1:01:48] his will
[1:01:49] again he says he will put his rope of
[1:01:52] power upon you you adopt you to then
[1:01:55] by the the adoption give you power to
[1:01:58] work for him now brother van damme i'll
[1:01:59] just throw this out here he uses the
[1:02:01] idea of a mantle and a robe
[1:02:02] interchangeably amen
[1:02:04] but you i want you to think about this
[1:02:06] and we i didn't read all through the
[1:02:07] scripture but you're probably familiar
[1:02:09] with this story
[1:02:10] amen but he comes back he's got this
[1:02:12] mantle or this robe or whatever you want
[1:02:13] to call it it wasn't a flip-flop i guess
[1:02:16] but this this mantle that he's wearing
[1:02:18] and at this time there's a school the
[1:02:19] prophets in this school the prophets
[1:02:21] they are they're sitting there and they
[1:02:24] are looking and when elijah comes back
[1:02:27] they said that we're gonna go look for
[1:02:28] elijah notice the attitude of the school
[1:02:30] the prophets these were anointed men
[1:02:32] these are preachers they went to a
[1:02:33] certain seminary or something i don't
[1:02:34] know what these religious prophetic
[1:02:36] educated men when elijah leaves the
[1:02:39] scene what do they look to do they look
[1:02:41] to imitate or define elijah
[1:02:44] well you know i guess the spirit of god
[1:02:46] just carried we gotta go find elijah
[1:02:48] wherever our lives at we gotta go be
[1:02:49] where elijah's at and they missed that
[1:02:51] that wasn't about elijah anymore
[1:02:53] the anointing that had been on elijah
[1:02:55] was on elisha
[1:02:57] amen you've got people i'm not gonna get
[1:03:00] all this but you look at you look at
[1:03:01] your charismatic your pentecostal
[1:03:02] churches they've got people it's like
[1:03:04] this guy well praise the lord i'm i'm
[1:03:06] going here now i guess i don't have this
[1:03:07] in my notes so hold on pray for me
[1:03:10] like you've got this guy who's down in
[1:03:11] florida here a few years ago and he's
[1:03:13] preaching and he said that the lord
[1:03:15] called him he said two angels to him he
[1:03:17] said he sent william branham's angel he
[1:03:18] sent the money angel i don't know what
[1:03:19] that money angel's about i haven't found
[1:03:20] him yet amen but they found this look
[1:03:23] they're all claiming this anointing oh
[1:03:26] listen they don't want to accept the
[1:03:27] teaching william branham but they all
[1:03:29] want the ministry of it
[1:03:31] that's all come down they're one of the
[1:03:32] benefits but they don't want to have the
[1:03:34] accountability they don't have to stay
[1:03:35] with us saith the lord they said this
[1:03:38] school the prophets is no different
[1:03:39] they're looking around for elijah
[1:03:41] where's elijah we'll go find him and
[1:03:43] elijah told him there's no need for you
[1:03:45] to go luck
[1:03:47] right
[1:03:48] they compelled him to the bible said he
[1:03:49] was ashamed fine go live for him because
[1:03:52] well we couldn't find him i know you
[1:03:53] couldn't i told you you couldn't
[1:03:54] big ol i told you so man i tell you what
[1:03:57] you know i used to feel so bad about
[1:03:58] that you know people come up
[1:04:01] praise the lord
[1:04:02] people come up and this and that and
[1:04:03] stuff and you know you don't want to
[1:04:05] tell them i told you so
[1:04:06] but you did
[1:04:08] and i thought about well that's what
[1:04:09] they did in the bible i told you so
[1:04:13] well you can use that if you want listen
[1:04:14] paul dealt with that one time they go to
[1:04:16] loose off this boat and he and they're
[1:04:18] out there on the seat for 14 days
[1:04:19] they're about to drown and paul comes
[1:04:21] back said i told you you should not you
[1:04:23] should have listened to me
[1:04:25] when i said don't leave chris that's
[1:04:26] what he did i'm big oh i told you so
[1:04:28] listen i told you you should listen to
[1:04:29] me the first time but fear not
[1:04:32] the aim for the lord stood by me this
[1:04:33] night and he's told me that there'll be
[1:04:35] no loss of life on this well praise
[1:04:37] god for his mercy
[1:04:40] hey man
[1:04:41] it's interesting to me because we had a
[1:04:42] prophet come and tell us certain things
[1:04:44] in this day and people they want to
[1:04:45] leave the pattern of the word or the
[1:04:47] pattern of the message the thing that
[1:04:48] was sent to dress us they want to leave
[1:04:51] it and then when they leave it and
[1:04:52] everything falls apart you're just
[1:04:53] you're trying not to be like
[1:04:55] he told you so
[1:04:56] i told you so
[1:04:58] you know you got kids you know listen
[1:05:00] sometimes you got kids and you're trying
[1:05:01] to praise the lord
[1:05:03] and you're trying to get to them and
[1:05:04] they won't listen you gotta you gotta
[1:05:06] drive them at home brother graham said i
[1:05:08] told you that was gonna happen
[1:05:10] you're not doing me caddy or maybe you
[1:05:12] are
[1:05:13] partly maybe your motivation's a little
[1:05:15] a little skewed there but the reason is
[1:05:17] not to try to rub it in their face the
[1:05:19] reason is you're trying to say listen i
[1:05:21] told you for a reason i tried to warn
[1:05:23] you i'm trying to help you out
[1:05:25] listen elijah was just trying to save
[1:05:27] them a lot of time they're running
[1:05:29] around looking for elijah but listen
[1:05:31] praise the lord they were looking for
[1:05:33] the wrong thing
[1:05:36] why because elisha knew where elijah
[1:05:39] went
[1:05:40] he watched him the whole time he watched
[1:05:42] the ministry he saw the fulfillment he
[1:05:44] recognized what it was he didn't have to
[1:05:47] go find elijah he knew he wasn't going
[1:05:49] to find him anywhere on this earth
[1:05:51] because he saw him take it up
[1:05:52] [Music]
[1:05:55] but what i love about this is elisha
[1:05:57] asked the right question amen right you
[1:05:59] know many times in life i've just
[1:06:01] dropped this in here many times in life
[1:06:03] our situation that we're dealing with
[1:06:06] what we're trying to contend with or
[1:06:07] what we're trying to understand
[1:06:09] it's not a matter of us getting the
[1:06:10] right answer
[1:06:11] we're always trying to find the answers
[1:06:13] to our questions but we actually have
[1:06:14] the answer
[1:06:15] amen we have the answer to the devil's
[1:06:17] question
[1:06:18] amen the problem is not the answer we
[1:06:20] have the answer but are we asking the
[1:06:22] right question right amen sometimes we
[1:06:25] go well i'm just gonna like i said i'm
[1:06:26] just gonna be real i'm gonna fly up here
[1:06:28] a little bit now amen sometimes in my
[1:06:31] own life maybe you can relate to this
[1:06:32] sometimes you're looking for direction
[1:06:34] in your life and you're praying to god
[1:06:35] what should i do here where should i go
[1:06:36] there we're trying to find direction
[1:06:38] we're asking god should i do this or
[1:06:41] should i do that and i've learned this
[1:06:42] is what i'm getting to i've learned in
[1:06:44] my life to change the way i asked god
[1:06:46] questions
[1:06:47] god should i do this should i do that no
[1:06:49] god what do you want to do what is your
[1:06:50] purpose god help me to see the bigger
[1:06:53] picture because many times we're missing
[1:06:55] the bigger picture we see what we want
[1:06:57] to see we see what we envision we have
[1:06:59] our ideas and our goals and our opinions
[1:07:02] and we throw up to god we want him to
[1:07:03] spike it in the ground for us
[1:07:06] but what we're going to do is expand our
[1:07:07] question lord what are you trying to
[1:07:09] show me in all this whether i'm
[1:07:11] suffering whether i'm distressed whether
[1:07:13] i don't know which way to go it's not
[1:07:15] just a matter of direction but god what
[1:07:17] are you trying to show me in this what
[1:07:19] is god trying to teach me amen amen
[1:07:23] well i hope that's all right
[1:07:24] amen we whatever your question is today
[1:07:27] we have the answer amen there was an
[1:07:29] answer to their question they're looking
[1:07:31] for elijah elijah's gone
[1:07:33] elisha knew the answer amen
[1:07:36] we ask ourselves you know it's like
[1:07:37] people let give you an example in our a
[1:07:39] young man's life you know you you talk
[1:07:41] to young men they want to know what do i
[1:07:42] have to do to be successful in life
[1:07:45] that's not the question the question is
[1:07:46] what is success
[1:07:48] amen listen you can a success is not
[1:07:51] based on your bank account or your
[1:07:53] popularity or this see they ask the
[1:07:55] wrong questions well would i get it to
[1:07:56] be rich or famous or this or that no
[1:07:59] you're missing the point what is real
[1:08:01] success
[1:08:02] what is the real point of it all right
[1:08:04] amen they're asking us where's elijah at
[1:08:07] but elisha knew the secret the question
[1:08:09] wasn't where's elijah where is the god
[1:08:12] of elijah
[1:08:13] the god of elijah is the one that parts
[1:08:15] the waters the god of elijah had already
[1:08:17] come back and parted the water for him
[1:08:21] he didn't need to know where elijah went
[1:08:23] he had to know where the god of elijah
[1:08:25] was and let me say to you today just
[1:08:27] because william branham is gone just
[1:08:30] because the prophet is going off the
[1:08:31] scene god is still here today
[1:08:35] we don't have to ask wasn't going to
[1:08:36] come back and fly around the world and
[1:08:38] go on a tent and do this that's not
[1:08:40] important the important question is
[1:08:43] where is the god of this prophet
[1:08:45] [Applause]
[1:08:47] do we know where he's at i know where
[1:08:49] he's at he's the jordan of my life when
[1:08:52] i was bound for a lottery grade he made
[1:08:55] away from me
[1:08:58] i know what he's done in my life amen
[1:09:01] the right it's the right question
[1:09:03] it wasn't i mean that was that's my
[1:09:05] testimony as a center i was trying to do
[1:09:07] this i was trying to do that i couldn't
[1:09:09] figure out why does everything backfire
[1:09:11] it seems like no matter what i do
[1:09:14] i do what everybody else does but
[1:09:15] doesn't work for me that's because i
[1:09:17] wasn't like everybody else
[1:09:19] god corrects his own children he doesn't
[1:09:20] correct the other children of the world
[1:09:22] but he corrects us out god won't let me
[1:09:24] get away with one thing
[1:09:27] sometimes you go along man why why do i
[1:09:29] get stuck every time i try to get away
[1:09:31] with one thing god's right there why
[1:09:34] because he loves you
[1:09:36] might not seem like it might not feel
[1:09:39] like he loves you that's why
[1:09:43] listen no chastisement seems pleasant
[1:09:46] that's a notice that said oh praise god
[1:09:48] i'm getting a whooping today
[1:09:50] hallelujah god give me another let
[1:09:52] nobody does that
[1:09:53] we act all spiritual i'm just doing this
[1:09:55] for the yeah whatever
[1:09:58] i'm biblical
[1:10:00] nobody likes it when they get spanked
[1:10:02] but it's for your good
[1:10:04] amen
[1:10:08] praise the lord somebody
[1:10:10] brother i didn't come here get beat up
[1:10:12] today well listen i'm not trying to beat
[1:10:13] you up or anything i'm just saying
[1:10:14] listen if god correct i'm getting ahead
[1:10:16] of myself a little bit but if god
[1:10:17] corrects you that means he loves you
[1:10:20] it don't mean he hates you
[1:10:21] listen i don't go to other people's kids
[1:10:23] and and whip them and now i might feel
[1:10:25] like it sometimes
[1:10:27] but i don't go out there but i do it to
[1:10:29] my own and i don't do it to my own just
[1:10:31] because i'm mad at them or i want to
[1:10:32] work them over and let them know who the
[1:10:34] boss is i do it because i love them
[1:10:37] i don't want to grow up and be a misfit
[1:10:38] like i was when i grew up
[1:10:41] well praise the lord
[1:10:44] listen this mantle this this mantle of
[1:10:47] succession these prophets like today
[1:10:50] they're all they all want you
[1:10:52] praise the lord i'm i'm just gonna be
[1:10:54] myself i guess for a moment i was
[1:10:55] talking about sister mita branham the
[1:10:57] other day and i thought you know that
[1:10:58] poor woman think about the things she
[1:11:00] went through
[1:11:01] you know brother brandon come home and
[1:11:02] he's seen the house a mess and this and
[1:11:04] that listen she has can you imagine
[1:11:06] waking up
[1:11:07] and you get out of bed and you walk in
[1:11:09] the living room and you got people
[1:11:10] staying in the living room that you
[1:11:11] don't even know who they are
[1:11:15] i believe in the second amendment i'll
[1:11:16] just say that but
[1:11:19] i mean but seriously though i mean you
[1:11:21] just walk in and there's some woman
[1:11:23] there god has told me that i'm to be the
[1:11:25] manager over your husband's ministry and
[1:11:27] if not thus saith the lord he's gonna
[1:11:29] you gotta deal with this all day long
[1:11:33] why everybody wanna control the mantle
[1:11:36] hey man they want control and listen
[1:11:38] we've had it even this message amen
[1:11:40] let's not get quiet now we've had eighth
[1:11:42] day messengers and ninth gay messengers
[1:11:44] and a brother bear made a foundation for
[1:11:46] my ministry everybody wants to be the
[1:11:48] successor oh we want the gift of god we
[1:11:51] want william bran's ministry no you
[1:11:52] really don't you want your ministry to
[1:11:54] be vindicated because you want god to
[1:11:56] validate your opinion
[1:11:58] amen somebody
[1:12:00] listen when god spoke to elijah and he
[1:12:02] told me i want you to anoint the prophet
[1:12:04] elijah in my stand elijah wasn't looking
[1:12:07] for it right but he was there pawing the
[1:12:09] field straight doing daddy's work and
[1:12:12] god said i chose him he didn't choose me
[1:12:15] i chose elijah
[1:12:16] listen to the prophet of this day you
[1:12:18] didn't go looking for this message you
[1:12:20] weren't seeking after it god chose you
[1:12:25] and this thing that all these men these
[1:12:27] people they want to claim it we've got
[1:12:29] we're the successor of this ministry
[1:12:31] we've got this anointing we've got this
[1:12:33] mantle everything they wanted everything
[1:12:36] they're looking for all these sons of
[1:12:37] the prophet they're looking for god give
[1:12:39] it to you
[1:12:41] you're over here on the other side of
[1:12:42] the river saying what are you looking
[1:12:43] for it for it's right here
[1:12:45] and they're looking at you going
[1:12:47] really
[1:12:49] i don't know about that listen how do
[1:12:51] you know you're wearing the same
[1:12:52] clothing
[1:12:53] you're clothed with the same word amen
[1:12:55] it doesn't matter how it looks to the
[1:12:57] people it doesn't matter what it looks
[1:12:59] like to the theologian you've been
[1:13:00] clothed with the word and the anointing
[1:13:03] of this ministry there was such power in
[1:13:05] elijah's ministry that even when he was
[1:13:08] in the grave
[1:13:10] it brought a dead man back to life and i
[1:13:12] believe the message of this hour in this
[1:13:14] bride even if you go by way of the grave
[1:13:17] today if you were to go home and die
[1:13:19] today the ministry that you've been
[1:13:21] given will raise you
[1:13:23] it will raise your family it will raise
[1:13:25] the seven churches out of a grave of
[1:13:28] death and darkness
[1:13:30] he said how do you know brother because
[1:13:31] he's already resurrected us out of north
[1:13:34] denominationalism he's already
[1:13:36] resurrected us when we were dead in sins
[1:13:39] and trespasses
[1:13:44] up here today claimed to be some
[1:13:45] successor
[1:13:47] to the ministry of william branham but i
[1:13:48] do believe that the same spirit that was
[1:13:50] on that man that was in paul that was in
[1:13:52] these prophets it's here today with me
[1:13:55] and with you
[1:13:57] what to do the same thing you did there
[1:13:59] fulfill the will of god right amen amen
[1:14:04] god is bringing up people into
[1:14:05] perfection by the word of the lord
[1:14:07] brother says he didn't alter his robe to
[1:14:09] fit elisha he ordered elisha to fit the
[1:14:12] robe amen
[1:14:14] see everybody's trying to be this guy
[1:14:16] and all you've got all wrong you have to
[1:14:18] make sure you fit grow into the road
[1:14:20] amen that's what he does today he
[1:14:23] altered he says he alters the rope and
[1:14:25] he corrects himself not the robe to fit
[1:14:26] us sometimes we want to make the robe
[1:14:29] fit us but we can't do that
[1:14:32] we've got to be altered yourself for the
[1:14:35] robe
[1:14:36] it's god's robe and he made it perfect
[1:14:40] we've got he said he's got to bring us
[1:14:42] into that realm to make the robe fit us
[1:14:44] now for the sake of time i just want to
[1:14:46] skip down here
[1:14:47] to read this next part but in the same
[1:14:48] sermon he says this he says notice all
[1:14:51] these years as far as we know he's just
[1:14:53] had one baptism of the robe going over
[1:14:56] him amen but through the years god has
[1:14:58] molded the man's character into a place
[1:15:00] to where after his call
[1:15:02] after his call he would fit into the
[1:15:05] robe and be the servant of the lord amen
[1:15:08] amen so i i think this is important to
[1:15:11] us this is what we're looking at today
[1:15:13] we look at the promises of god we look
[1:15:14] at the church without spot or wrinkle we
[1:15:16] look at a catching away sometimes it
[1:15:19] looks like the garment isn't going to
[1:15:20] fit
[1:15:21] amen and men in the message have tried
[1:15:23] to make the garment fit well if you do
[1:15:25] this you do that well if you had
[1:15:26] rapturing faith there'd be a rapture
[1:15:28] that's not how it works
[1:15:30] i mean men have tried to produce a
[1:15:31] rapture they've tried to produce the
[1:15:33] move of god because they didn't have the
[1:15:35] character
[1:15:37] fit into the robe
[1:15:39] that's why they have to try to produce
[1:15:41] something it's they're trying to
[1:15:42] manufacture something
[1:15:44] that's why it doesn't work amen god
[1:15:47] fitted this robe of this bride amen when
[1:15:49] he made this robe he cut it to just the
[1:15:52] dimensions he was looking for amen
[1:15:55] he doesn't he listen he doesn't have to
[1:15:56] measure twice and cut once he knew the
[1:15:58] exact dimensions and he cut perfect the
[1:16:01] first time
[1:16:03] hey man i tell you what a lot better
[1:16:04] than me i cut three or four times then i
[1:16:06] got to start over and buy another thing
[1:16:09] and
[1:16:10] don't ask me to make a garment for you
[1:16:12] amen but i believe malachi forest
[1:16:14] provided a garment for us amen what was
[1:16:16] this ministry to do to dress the bride
[1:16:19] amen
[1:16:20] the father in adopting his son he places
[1:16:22] him in authority over the family
[1:16:24] business he has a robe and that robe is
[1:16:26] not fitted for that child at their in
[1:16:28] their youth it's fitted for them in
[1:16:30] their maturity
[1:16:32] that's why god couldn't send the message
[1:16:34] until this hour that's why he couldn't
[1:16:36] send a token until this hour there had
[1:16:38] to be a people that could receive it in
[1:16:41] its fullness
[1:16:43] so he grew them into this this this
[1:16:45] realm of maturity amen amen
[1:16:48] says this this at the end of the church
[1:16:49] age book resume of the ages because it
[1:16:52] makes this point i think sometimes we
[1:16:53] forget about this we we look at the
[1:16:55] other ages we just kind of well you know
[1:16:56] they they're whatever and this that no
[1:16:58] they were who they were supposed to be
[1:16:59] for their age
[1:17:01] and if we're not careful we discount
[1:17:02] them and you forget they're part of the
[1:17:04] adoption they're part of the
[1:17:05] resurrection as well yeah brother braham
[1:17:07] says this might make some wonder if we
[1:17:09] said that the lutherans didn't have the
[1:17:10] holy spirit because they taught
[1:17:12] basically justification it might make
[1:17:14] some wonder about the methodists etc he
[1:17:17] says no sir we're not saying that we're
[1:17:19] not talking about the individuals or the
[1:17:21] people
[1:17:22] what you realize now he's making the
[1:17:24] distinction here i want you to make this
[1:17:25] for yourself amen you you look at the
[1:17:28] age you're in amen you look at these
[1:17:30] people in their age he's talking about
[1:17:32] we're not he says we're not talking
[1:17:33] about the individuals or the people but
[1:17:36] the age
[1:17:37] he said luther had the spirit of god
[1:17:40] yeah hey man
[1:17:42] i thought i'd give you more amens on
[1:17:43] that well listen if god can give it to
[1:17:44] luther he can give it to you
[1:17:46] praise the lord somebody
[1:17:48] with his smoking and drinking and hating
[1:17:49] the jews god give it to him
[1:17:52] so he can give it to you
[1:17:53] praise the lord
[1:17:55] well first of all he says here but his
[1:17:57] age was not the age of full restoration
[1:18:00] by another outpouring like in the
[1:18:01] beginning it was the same with wesley
[1:18:04] booth knox whitfield brainerd jonathan
[1:18:07] edwards mueller etc surely they were
[1:18:09] full of the holy ghost yes they
[1:18:12] certainly were but the age in which they
[1:18:15] lived was not the age of restoration
[1:18:18] neither was any age but this last edge
[1:18:21] now he's telling you where you're at
[1:18:23] you're not coming into the age of
[1:18:24] restoration you are in the age of
[1:18:26] restoration now
[1:18:28] i'm making i'm laying this out for a
[1:18:30] point because we tend to put this stuff
[1:18:31] out somewhere but he's saying it's here
[1:18:33] now they actually had everything that
[1:18:35] you have they just didn't know it
[1:18:38] the potentials was laying in him the
[1:18:40] whole time but the potential is not just
[1:18:42] laying in you it's been expressed
[1:18:45] through an identification in the message
[1:18:48] listen you didn't know you were an eagle
[1:18:50] until you saw what an eagle looked like
[1:18:53] i didn't know eagles could soar that
[1:18:54] high we've seen one sword that high i
[1:18:57] didn't know an eagle could rise above
[1:18:58] that i didn't know an eagle could love
[1:19:00] its enemy like that we've seen one
[1:19:03] we've got a witness today you can fly
[1:19:06] that high you don't have to stay down
[1:19:09] here they didn't know but we know
[1:19:16] he says neither was any age but this age
[1:19:19] that's what he identifies this age as
[1:19:21] the age of complete blackout in apostasy
[1:19:24] this is the age of apostasy and
[1:19:27] this is the age of restoration amen
[1:19:30] it is the age of the finished cycle
[1:19:33] with this
[1:19:34] it's all over
[1:19:36] amen
[1:19:38] so all the potential is there but when
[1:19:40] the message came it's over there that's
[1:19:42] why there's nothing else to come
[1:19:44] it's finished amen
[1:19:47] praise the lord so they they have in
[1:19:49] them the same potentials brotherhood
[1:19:50] talks about it goes to the it was dr
[1:19:52] reed head that luther and dean said do
[1:19:54] we have the holy ghost said well
[1:19:55] potentially
[1:19:57] the potentials was always there
[1:19:59] amen luther is no less the son of god
[1:20:01] than you and i are but he just didn't
[1:20:03] have the full revelation of it like you
[1:20:06] and i do like we have today
[1:20:08] we have it today we have by divine
[1:20:11] vindication the perfect interpretation
[1:20:14] to this word
[1:20:15] amen
[1:20:17] god didn't give it in that asian it's
[1:20:19] fullness why because he couldn't right
[1:20:21] that's what isaiah 28 talks about it was
[1:20:23] here a little and there a little that
[1:20:25] what isaiah said it's lined up online
[1:20:27] it's precept upon precept here a little
[1:20:29] there a little amen listen it was the
[1:20:31] same thing i tie this into the adoption
[1:20:33] the promised land it was the same thing
[1:20:35] when israel come into the promised land
[1:20:37] to take their position there what did
[1:20:38] god say to them in deuteronomy 7. he
[1:20:40] said don't be afraid about these people
[1:20:42] he said the lord god is among you is he
[1:20:44] is he among us today
[1:20:46] he said a mighty and terrible god notice
[1:20:49] the lord that god will will put out
[1:20:50] those nations before thee little by
[1:20:52] little all right
[1:20:55] thou mayest not consume them at once
[1:20:57] lest the beasts of the field increase
[1:20:59] upon thee but the lord shall thy god
[1:21:01] shall deliver them unto thee thou shalt
[1:21:03] destroy them with a mighty destruction
[1:21:05] until they be destroyed brother bram
[1:21:08] says this he says god said i'm not this
[1:21:10] is in testimony 53 he says i'm not going
[1:21:12] to give it to you all at one time
[1:21:14] if i give it to you one time it says the
[1:21:16] whole land will be swept bare then the
[1:21:18] wild beast will multiply against you and
[1:21:21] will overcome you i'm just going to give
[1:21:22] it to you little by little as you're
[1:21:24] able to possess
[1:21:26] the land i'm just gonna drive them out
[1:21:28] and give it to you little by little now
[1:21:30] i think this is really important and
[1:21:32] it's noteworthy to me
[1:21:35] why didn't god just do it all at once
[1:21:36] like that because god ordained to give
[1:21:38] it to you little by little because that
[1:21:39] was the only way they could bear it amen
[1:21:42] think about that loser had the nature
[1:21:44] but he didn't have the revelation to
[1:21:46] have what you have today
[1:21:48] because god ordained something better
[1:21:50] for us that they without us should not
[1:21:53] be made perfect
[1:21:55] man
[1:21:56] you think about this uh
[1:21:58] well i don't mean to get political but i
[1:21:59] guess we're i'm in ohio i'll be okay
[1:22:04] we look at this foreign policy disaster
[1:22:07] that is afghanistan
[1:22:10] praise the lord brother
[1:22:12] amen some some of y'all gonna be running
[1:22:14] around yeah you know
[1:22:15] listen i wouldn't
[1:22:17] i'm i'm a christian first not a
[1:22:18] democratic republican amen but you look
[1:22:20] at this foreign it's a does that let's
[1:22:22] just call it it's a disaster it's an
[1:22:24] absolute disaster
[1:22:26] why looks and they went in there and
[1:22:28] they blew up people and they machine
[1:22:30] gunned them down and they rolled in
[1:22:32] tanks they flew jets and we've got the
[1:22:34] greatest military on the face of the
[1:22:36] earth but we couldn't possess the land
[1:22:40] hey man listen that's that's the
[1:22:41] american way of doing things we're just
[1:22:43] going to go in that carpet bomb
[1:22:44] everything into the stone age we'll show
[1:22:46] them
[1:22:46] listen you can't live in a land like
[1:22:48] that
[1:22:49] it's not fit to occupy listen when god
[1:22:52] called these people in this promised
[1:22:53] land he didn't just come in there to go
[1:22:55] lay at waste and wipe it out and bomb it
[1:22:58] with an atomic bomb he said no i want
[1:23:00] you to go there and possess the land
[1:23:03] you're not just there to destroy these
[1:23:05] guys you're there to occupy this land
[1:23:08] i want you to take the wilderness and
[1:23:10] make it blossom like a rose i want you
[1:23:13] to take something barren and make it
[1:23:15] live
[1:23:17] you say what are you getting god's not
[1:23:19] just trying to just feed our enemy today
[1:23:21] and blow them out of the sky
[1:23:23] right that's our american mindset we'll
[1:23:25] go in there we'll show that we'll blow
[1:23:27] them all up you can't live there
[1:23:28] afterwards
[1:23:29] god likes this land this land that we
[1:23:32] want to blow up he likes it he actually
[1:23:34] wants you to live there he wants your
[1:23:35] children to live there he wants your
[1:23:37] children's children to live there he
[1:23:38] doesn't want you to utterly destroy it
[1:23:41] he just wants you to drive out
[1:23:42] everything that doesn't belong to him
[1:23:46] hey man you say where are you going with
[1:23:47] this i'm going somewhere amen listen if
[1:23:49] we were called to inhabit listen they
[1:23:51] were called to inhabit houses they
[1:23:53] didn't build
[1:23:54] listen we're called to inhabit a
[1:23:55] building
[1:23:56] not made with human hands god's given us
[1:23:59] something amen amen
[1:24:01] and sometimes you gotta take it one step
[1:24:02] at a time right
[1:24:05] listen i i i'm just gonna not presume
[1:24:08] but i'm just gonna drop this in here
[1:24:11] i i would assume or i would say this
[1:24:14] god told them not to utterly take the
[1:24:16] land all at once because that was
[1:24:17] probably in their mind to do that
[1:24:19] amen listen guys now i know when you
[1:24:21] think you get in there you're just going
[1:24:22] to flip every table over and burn every
[1:24:24] bridge down and blow everything up but i
[1:24:26] actually i want you to know i'm not
[1:24:28] going to do it that way i'm gonna do it
[1:24:29] little by little he said the same thing
[1:24:31] through isaiah about revelation
[1:24:33] amen i want you to know i'm gonna do it
[1:24:35] little by little it might seem like it's
[1:24:38] just one step at a time and we as human
[1:24:40] beings sometimes we get discouraged
[1:24:42] because progress doesn't come
[1:24:44] in our own lives now talk about
[1:24:46] possessing your vessel now hey man let's
[1:24:47] talk about you for a moment we've talked
[1:24:49] about israel we've talked about abraham
[1:24:51] let's talk about you for a minute
[1:24:53] sometimes in our own lives we we look at
[1:24:55] the the slowness of progress and we say
[1:24:58] why why why am i still wrestling with
[1:25:00] this why do i solve this complex from
[1:25:02] when i was a child why do i still seem
[1:25:04] to wrestle with this because god's doing
[1:25:06] it a little bit at a time sometimes
[1:25:08] listen because god doesn't want to
[1:25:09] destroy the land he actually wants to
[1:25:11] live in it
[1:25:12] amen so he can't just wipe you out amen
[1:25:15] because listen when you receive the holy
[1:25:17] ghost you still have a nature
[1:25:19] man but man talk about honey said god
[1:25:21] didn't take that out when i got born
[1:25:22] again there's part of you that god likes
[1:25:25] he don't want to blow it up he likes
[1:25:27] that part of you so he says listen if i
[1:25:30] have to give it to you a little bit at a
[1:25:31] time that's how i'm going to give it to
[1:25:33] you because i don't want you to just
[1:25:35] obliterate that guy
[1:25:37] i like that guy he's my son he's my
[1:25:39] daughter
[1:25:40] amen well praise the lord is that all
[1:25:42] right
[1:25:43] listen when you when you make a claim to
[1:25:46] this promise it doesn't matter how long
[1:25:48] it takes amen if you speak to the
[1:25:50] mountain
[1:25:51] and it moves one grain of sand at a time
[1:25:54] that's still one more grain than the
[1:25:56] that move than there was yesterday
[1:25:59] it's like i always say if you can move
[1:26:00] in an inch you can move it all the way
[1:26:03] it's just a matter of time and patience
[1:26:07] i mean you can claim your deliverance
[1:26:09] today you can claim your loved ones
[1:26:10] today you can speak to your mountain
[1:26:12] today and even if it doesn't look like
[1:26:14] it's moving real fast remember god took
[1:26:16] seven church ages just to get you here
[1:26:19] god is not in a hurry in your life
[1:26:22] [Applause]
[1:26:23] we get in a hurry well god i got so much
[1:26:25] to do listen he's not sitting there
[1:26:27] sweating because the time's almost up
[1:26:29] listen saint's the one that's sweating
[1:26:32] he knows he's got a short time and he
[1:26:34] can't do anything about it
[1:26:36] god's not worried about the time it's in
[1:26:38] his hands
[1:26:40] [Applause]
[1:26:42] well praise the lord brother bram said
[1:26:43] you might not even be able to notice it
[1:26:45] moving so he say
[1:26:48] amen
[1:26:49] but it's moving why because god said so
[1:26:51] amen so listen we have to come we have
[1:26:54] to be patient with ourselves
[1:26:57] amen
[1:26:58] because god wants to have the right
[1:27:00] character
[1:27:01] amen for this adopted son this adopted
[1:27:03] daughter he wants to make sure they have
[1:27:04] his likeness and his character so he's
[1:27:06] going to take his time whether you like
[1:27:08] it or not and you probably don't
[1:27:10] amen we probably don't like it when god
[1:27:12] takes his time with our neighbor we're
[1:27:13] like man i wish god hurry up with this
[1:27:14] guy
[1:27:16] i wish god hurry up with the deacon or
[1:27:17] the pastor my brother my sister my
[1:27:18] husband listen god's taking his time
[1:27:21] just on you like he does anybody else
[1:27:24] well praise the lord
[1:27:26] listen i believe let me just i'm gonna
[1:27:28] make a statement here and this might not
[1:27:30] be popular but this is how i feel about
[1:27:32] people's approach to church you know uh
[1:27:34] people we we get in a place like these
[1:27:36] israelites we get in a big hurry amen
[1:27:39] we'll go and we'll go to church and
[1:27:40] we'll chase one ministry we'll chase
[1:27:42] another we'll go from special services
[1:27:43] to special services we'll go from
[1:27:45] revival to revival and i marvel because
[1:27:47] people that go to these things and they
[1:27:49] come out and all it was just so great it
[1:27:50] was amazing it was life-changing it was
[1:27:52] so dynamic and yet they lived the same
[1:27:54] kind of life they've always lived before
[1:27:56] i'm like
[1:27:57] life change was like the worst adjective
[1:27:59] to use there
[1:28:00] like it was almost life-changing
[1:28:03] it was borderline life-changing
[1:28:07] you say where you're going out with this
[1:28:09] i what i'm saying is this we can go and
[1:28:11] chase things and go after things but
[1:28:13] people's lives if they're not
[1:28:14] spiritually different they're no
[1:28:16] stronger than they were years ago
[1:28:17] something's wrong with the picture
[1:28:19] amen and i realize this is why i say
[1:28:21] this people that go with this
[1:28:22] expectation they want great sweeping
[1:28:25] changes in their life we expect this
[1:28:27] great sweeping change in our life
[1:28:29] because they don't have the patience for
[1:28:30] little changes
[1:28:34] amen
[1:28:35] we want god to which god's just going to
[1:28:37] come in and boom just flip it well he
[1:28:38] could do it that way but do you have the
[1:28:40] patience if he does it a little bit at a
[1:28:41] time
[1:28:43] amen see we despise the days of small
[1:28:46] things
[1:28:47] oh i can't wait for this preacher and i
[1:28:48] can't wait for this what about your
[1:28:50] pastor preach on the midweek
[1:28:52] we have the patience to come in and be
[1:28:53] changed a little bit at the time er see
[1:28:55] what we gotta we got to have everything
[1:28:57] set see it's like amazon
[1:28:59] we don't get in two days i ain't over
[1:29:00] internet

[1:29:04] boy
[1:29:05] hey man he'll give it to you when he's
[1:29:06] good ready
[1:29:08] i shall give it to you when you're good
[1:29:09] and ready you just think you're ready or
[1:29:11] not
[1:29:13] oh praise the lord
[1:29:16] well i told it's not pop it's true
[1:29:18] though
[1:29:19] people that go to church
[1:29:20] they're like junkies they're looking to
[1:29:22] get some high from a church but they
[1:29:24] forget the fruit grows with the valley
[1:29:27] hey man it's not the big great things
[1:29:29] it's the little things we leave undone
[1:29:31] it's that little bit of land that we
[1:29:33] just neglect it and it falls into
[1:29:35] disarray in our lives and we get so
[1:29:37] upset but i remind you that god is
[1:29:39] hidden in the simplicity of it amen
[1:29:43] see we want to come on our own like god
[1:29:44] just carpet bomb this thing in my life
[1:29:45] no
[1:29:46] listen maybe god wants to make a
[1:29:48] testimony out of that yes
[1:29:50] amen well praise the lord like i said we
[1:29:53] and listen well that's the truth anyhow
[1:29:55] amen we'll do that in church

[1:29:59] in here and we preach against the devil

[1:30:55] against him we're going to show him this
[1:30:56] and we're bigger than the door listen

[1:31:00] kicking a gun when he's down that don't
[1:31:02] prove nothing
[1:31:04] that's not what god's trying to possess
[1:31:06] he wants this vessel
[1:31:10] and we don't get excited and we don't
[1:31:12] shout about us dying out daily
[1:31:15] because nobody likes dying daily
[1:31:19] we don't enjoy that we don't oh praise
[1:31:21] god i got to suffer
[1:31:25] word of god he's trying my character

[1:31:32] that
[1:31:34] that's what we need
[1:31:36] oh we love running down everything else
[1:31:38] but ourselves
[1:31:39] you're your own biggest obstacle
[1:31:44] we make such a big deal out of this
[1:31:45] listen
[1:31:47] actually people i'll just say this i'm
[1:31:48] going to say this that people give the
[1:31:50] devil too much credit
[1:31:51] right
[1:31:53] you're actually glorifying him
[1:31:56] well you know i was driving 65 in the 55
[1:31:58] and i got pulled over oh the devil no
[1:32:00] you did that
[1:32:02] hey man well praise the lord that's what
[1:32:04] brother brahman said who the devil made
[1:32:06] me do he said no he didn't you went out
[1:32:07] to him because if you got him here and
[1:32:09] got sealed he couldn't get to you
[1:32:12] you made the mistake you got carnal you
[1:32:15] got away from god and you paid the price
[1:32:18] you've got well praise the lord
[1:32:20] [Music]
[1:32:22] listen to zeal this hours not to sit
[1:32:23] here and run over the devil who's
[1:32:25] already defeated the zealous hour not
[1:32:27] just to sit here and trump it and be
[1:32:28] whatever we're just so great it's to
[1:32:30] repent
[1:32:31] right
[1:32:33] it's like the one thing nobody wants to
[1:32:34] do what is the lord
[1:32:36] everybody wants to blow up the devil man
[1:32:38] watch the size of this nuke
[1:32:42] you know it's like i've got this 50
[1:32:43] caliber
[1:32:44] the car blows up yeah i'm a real man i
[1:32:47] don't take a real man although i would
[1:32:49] like to do that sometime
[1:32:50] i would like to try that once brother
[1:32:52] brian you're gonna have to help me out
[1:32:53] there
[1:32:54] seems really cool but listen that's not
[1:32:56] what makes a man a man's not based on
[1:32:58] the size of his his muscles and his arms
[1:33:00] it's the bags in his knees
[1:33:03] it's how much he can submit himself to
[1:33:04] god amen
[1:33:06] listen nobody wants to die
[1:33:09] after a while this has become
[1:33:10] entertainment showmanship right amen
[1:33:14] but it's submitting yourselves a little
[1:33:15] more to god each day can you submit
[1:33:17] yourself to god more today than you did
[1:33:19] yesterday
[1:33:21] amen it might not seem like much but if
[1:33:23] it's a little bit it's better than
[1:33:24] nothing
[1:33:26] yeah man praise the lord amen listen
[1:33:29] giving him premise that's true power
[1:33:33] it's not about how much you can do it's
[1:33:35] about how much you can surrender
[1:33:37] because a man that is fully submitted to
[1:33:40] god is omnipotent all right
[1:33:43] amen
[1:33:44] well president i told you it wasn't
[1:33:45] popular with the truth listen i'll just
[1:33:47] tell you do you know what the scripture
[1:33:48] says even the 70 went out
[1:33:51] the 70 that jesus sent out they'd come
[1:33:53] back and they rejoiced all the devils
[1:33:54] are subject unto us yeah we showed the
[1:33:57] devil and she said don't rejoice about
[1:33:59] that
[1:34:00] rejoice that your names are in the book
[1:34:01] of life
[1:34:03] and listen they couldn't even be blotted
[1:34:04] out
[1:34:06] listen they were rejoicing about the
[1:34:08] wrong thing oh we can show it
[1:34:11] no rejoice your names are in the book of
[1:34:12] life that's what's something to rejoice
[1:34:14] about
[1:34:15] listen they could do that in their names
[1:34:16] we blot out that wasn't special
[1:34:20] amen even the pharisees jesus said well
[1:34:22] your father's catholic
[1:34:24] that's not special in and of itself
[1:34:25] what's special is that god has for
[1:34:27] ordained you for this robe
[1:34:29] amen
[1:34:30] that's what makes you different
[1:34:33] amen well praise the lord
[1:34:36] listen what identifies you brethren
[1:34:38] talks about identification now i was
[1:34:40] identified with isaiah i was identified
[1:34:42] with noah when he went to the ark i was
[1:34:44] identified with uh with john there on
[1:34:46] the jordan river what identifies you
[1:34:48] with christ is your character
[1:34:51] because the character in you if you had
[1:34:53] lived back there you would have done the
[1:34:54] same thing they did
[1:34:56] that's how you're identified with him if
[1:34:58] they lived in your day they would that's
[1:35:00] why luther if he lived in this day he
[1:35:02] would have heard it he would have
[1:35:03] received it you have the same nature the
[1:35:06] same character that's your
[1:35:07] identification
[1:35:09] amen
[1:35:10] that's why jesus tells the jews he said
[1:35:12] listen you you garnish the tombs of the
[1:35:14] prophets but your fathers killed him
[1:35:17] where for your witnesses
[1:35:19] your witnesses that you do the deeds of
[1:35:21] your fires
[1:35:23] praise the lord
[1:35:25] well
[1:35:26] i'm about halfway through here
[1:35:28] [Laughter]
[1:35:31] brother brown says now we have a token
[1:35:33] in this day amen
[1:35:35] we've been given a token which is the
[1:35:36] anti-type of that type listen you're not
[1:35:38] you're not pointing towards something to
[1:35:40] be fulfilled you're the fulfillment
[1:35:44] of that natural token we've been given
[1:35:46] the supernatural supreme token
[1:35:49] all that foreshadowed has been given to
[1:35:52] this generation
[1:35:54] given this token now we have the holy
[1:35:57] ghost is our token and it is our
[1:36:00] identification that we have accepted the
[1:36:03] death of the lamb amen
[1:36:06] not only was jesus just a human life to
[1:36:08] come back on us it was god himself
[1:36:11] manifest in flesh that brought back upon
[1:36:13] us the adoption of sons that now we are
[1:36:16] sons and daughters of god
[1:36:18] that is the token
[1:36:22] hallelujah praise the lord so you've got
[1:36:24] to have the authority of a son to place
[1:36:25] the token over household
[1:36:27] amen
[1:36:29] praise the lord it's the our
[1:36:30] identification of the passover it's our
[1:36:32] identification that we have believed god
[1:36:36] and god has accepted how many is
[1:36:38] accepted in the beloved yes that's why
[1:36:40] he gave you a token it's your
[1:36:42] identification that christ your passover
[1:36:44] has identified you with him amen
[1:36:48] so character is the evidence that the
[1:36:49] robe fits for us today amen this is the
[1:36:52] hour when the character of christ is
[1:36:54] manifested in the bride amen
[1:36:57] he you you think about brother brandon
[1:36:58] features the choosing the bride how does
[1:37:00] he choose his bride does it choose her
[1:37:02] based on the size of the building or or
[1:37:04] her wealth or what he looks at her
[1:37:07] character
[1:37:09] so that means that god looked at this
[1:37:11] age and he looked at you in this age as
[1:37:12] a son or daughter of god and he saw
[1:37:15] something you said that's that's what
[1:37:16] i'm looking to marry right there
[1:37:19] i mean i'm not looking to marry some
[1:37:20] sort of a some sort of a floozy that
[1:37:22] runs around or some just some church or
[1:37:24] some whatever he's looking for a mature
[1:37:26] bride that looks to him and only him
[1:37:29] that's faithful to him that's what he's
[1:37:31] looking at his character right amen
[1:37:34] praise the lord
[1:37:36] brother says we've been invited
[1:37:39] it's quite an invitation now
[1:37:41] we've been invited to be shaped into his
[1:37:43] character
[1:37:45] it's quite an invitation isn't it right
[1:37:48] listen if if you handed me an invitation
[1:37:51] paul hands me this invitation
[1:37:54] sorry
[1:37:55] henry this invitation says i have
[1:37:57] invited you to suffer
[1:37:59] for my namesake
[1:38:00] i wouldn't
[1:38:02] he'll be real honest with you this is
[1:38:04] all right i probably wouldn't be real
[1:38:05] excited
[1:38:07] praise god hold on
[1:38:10] we get to suffer for his name
[1:38:13] in the natural we would look at this
[1:38:15] invitation and say
[1:38:17] i'm going to click on there i'm not
[1:38:19] going
[1:38:22] we we don't value the importance of
[1:38:24] invitation
[1:38:26] because this is what i want you
[1:38:27] understand not everybody's been invited
[1:38:28] to this all right
[1:38:32] i don't know if i really want to go
[1:38:34] listen not everybody's invited it's just
[1:38:36] a special people
[1:38:38] the fact that you've been invited means
[1:38:39] you're special
[1:38:41] he doesn't invite he only invites family
[1:38:44] he's kind of like that i guess
[1:38:46] he just wants his children there that's
[1:38:47] who he invites amen listen it's
[1:38:50] i love how brother daryl ward put this
[1:38:52] years ago he said if i come up here on
[1:38:53] the platform i put a stack of gold up
[1:38:55] here on one side and said here's your
[1:38:57] sufferings and your trials over here
[1:38:58] which one would you pitch
[1:39:01] i'd be real honest with you i probably
[1:39:03] picked the gold
[1:39:05] well let me just say that let me
[1:39:07] rephrase this if i put a bunch of if i
[1:39:09] put a stack of gold up here on this
[1:39:10] platform and i offered it to you all we
[1:39:12] probably wouldn't have to really
[1:39:14] question the invitation so much
[1:39:17] you would come up here and grab as much
[1:39:18] school as you could carry and i wouldn't
[1:39:20] blame you i would too
[1:39:22] i mean i'm not saying there's anything
[1:39:23] wrong with the goal but what i'm saying
[1:39:24] is but this over here is worth more than
[1:39:27] the gold that's going to perish because
[1:39:29] your faith is going to be trotted by
[1:39:30] fire it's going to withstand the trial
[1:39:35] the trying of your face
[1:39:38] it's worth more than gold
[1:39:42] we've been given invitations worth more
[1:39:44] than all the gold in the world it's
[1:39:46] worth more than bitcoin or ethereum or
[1:39:48] whatever else
[1:39:51] trials
[1:39:53] sufferings the reproach yeah it's worth
[1:39:55] more than gold
[1:39:57] cause not everybody's invited to deal
[1:39:58] with it
[1:40:00] well it sure doesn't feel like it's
[1:40:01] worth more than gold does it
[1:40:03] listen if it felt like it was with more
[1:40:05] than gold everybody would want it
[1:40:07] all right yeah
[1:40:09] you know brother brand preaches about
[1:40:10] birth pains but you know what else he
[1:40:12] talks about growing pains
[1:40:14] we had growing pains
[1:40:15] he said suffering for his namesake is
[1:40:17] growing pains of his grace
[1:40:20] suffering for his words growing pains of
[1:40:22] his grace just remember it's the grace
[1:40:24] of god has been given to you
[1:40:27] man so many times we look at the growing
[1:40:29] pains and we we we get so despondent and
[1:40:32] upset about it and god's actually trying
[1:40:33] to do something for us we don't realize
[1:40:35] it all right
[1:40:37] i had a brother come to me a while back
[1:40:38] and this brother he
[1:40:40] uh he's got a real complex a guilt
[1:40:42] complex every everything he does he
[1:40:44] feels guilty he stops going to church
[1:40:46] this that he's just he's up and down all
[1:40:48] the time
[1:40:49] his conscious bo he does i tell you what
[1:40:51] i mean we'll talk about sincere this
[1:40:52] brother he's just so sincere he's way
[1:40:54] more sincere than i am i just be real
[1:40:55] honest this guy he just
[1:40:58] he's just he's the guy
[1:41:00] every little thing he does he compares
[1:41:02] himself and he's like i'm just not good
[1:41:03] enough i'm thinking
[1:41:05] you never were right neither was i i had
[1:41:07] nothing to do with it right
[1:41:10] maybe some maybe this is for somebody i
[1:41:11] guess but
[1:41:12] his conscience bothers him so much and i
[1:41:14] began to i began to talk to him one day
[1:41:16] i said i said you realize that not
[1:41:18] everybody deals with that
[1:41:19] right
[1:41:21] you sit there and you feel condemned and
[1:41:23] you feel beat up and your conscience
[1:41:24] bothers you and and you you don't feel
[1:41:26] like you're listen i said the world
[1:41:28] doesn't feel that way about
[1:41:30] god amen the world doesn't sit there and
[1:41:33] feel bad that they offended god with
[1:41:35] their blasphemy and their heresy and
[1:41:37] their heart they don't feel bad about it
[1:41:40] i said i want you to think about this
[1:41:41] the very thing in your life
[1:41:44] that you let condemn you is actually
[1:41:46] meant to bless you and you don't even
[1:41:47] realize it the fact you have a
[1:41:49] conscience the fact that you want to
[1:41:51] serve god you want to be right with god
[1:41:53] and you feel bad about it that's not
[1:41:56] meant to condemn you it's actually a
[1:41:57] blessing and you don't even realize it
[1:41:59] all right
[1:42:03] amen
[1:42:04] see we have to be careful we don't look
[1:42:05] at blessings as an evidence amen because
[1:42:08] i'm talking about growth and i'm talking
[1:42:09] about spiritual growth now i use this
[1:42:11] analogy as the home church here a while
[1:42:12] back i said to give an example about
[1:42:14] growing i said when i was actually just
[1:42:16] talking this morning about it when i
[1:42:18] talked about my height which as you can
[1:42:19] notice is
[1:42:20] is less than
[1:42:22] um
[1:42:23] average
[1:42:25] it's just no there's just no nice way to
[1:42:27] say this i'm vertically challenged
[1:42:30] [Laughter]
[1:42:32] my god i have a 13 year old son in the
[1:42:34] back and he lets me know all the time
[1:42:35] dad i'm going to be taller than you and
[1:42:36] i'm like
[1:42:37] that doesn't mean a thing
[1:42:39] everybody's taller than me
[1:42:43] that's not an achievement
[1:42:47] listen when i was 17 18 years old i got
[1:42:49] to 5 foot 9 and i stopped that was not
[1:42:52] my choice
[1:42:53] it was not my decision i would have
[1:42:56] six one or two you know be humble still
[1:42:58] but
[1:43:00] i would have chosen to go a little bit
[1:43:01] further but this is the this is the lot
[1:43:03] i was given praise the lord
[1:43:06] five foot nine with shoes on
[1:43:12] god didn't ask me if i wanted to be six
[1:43:14] foot tall right or i would have told him
[1:43:16] sure
[1:43:19] but i stopped growing at a certain spot
[1:43:22] and i made this point i said you know a
[1:43:24] remarkable thing happened i got to be
[1:43:25] about 24
[1:43:27] 25 years old
[1:43:28] i said something amazing happened i
[1:43:30] started growing again
[1:43:32] the problem was i wasn't growing this
[1:43:34] way
[1:43:37] it's grown this way
[1:43:39] it's been a fight ever since
[1:43:42] there's there's my son again you know he
[1:43:43] sits there and he
[1:43:45] you get a pumpkin pie or something kiss
[1:43:47] the season
[1:43:48] sister eats this whole pumpkin pie
[1:43:51] thin is a rail
[1:43:54] and then there's me i look at a donut i
[1:43:56] gained five pounds
[1:44:00] you say what's this guy do with anything
[1:44:01] listen i didn't ask for this i never
[1:44:03] asked for this in my life this is what i
[1:44:05] got okay
[1:44:06] somewhere that's a blessing i haven't
[1:44:08] figured out quite where yet but somehow
[1:44:09] that's meant for my good
[1:44:12] i started growing again but i grew the
[1:44:14] wrong way
[1:44:16] amen
[1:44:17] sometimes churches grow sometimes people
[1:44:19] grow but they grow the wrong direction
[1:44:22] instead of growing in the stature of
[1:44:23] christ we begin to grow in affluence
[1:44:25] we're going to grow in popularity we
[1:44:26] begin to grow in in our ability or all
[1:44:29] our church and our achievement you're
[1:44:31] growing the wrong way
[1:44:32] you're not getting taller you're just
[1:44:34] getting fatter
[1:44:35] take it from me i know
[1:44:38] hey man we've got to be careful when we
[1:44:40] look at our spiritual growth we're not
[1:44:41] just looking at the blessing the
[1:44:42] blessing is not an evidence of maturity
[1:44:45] some definite evidence you got good
[1:44:47] tastes and donuts that's all that is
[1:44:50] well praise the lord
[1:44:52] amen
[1:44:53] the character that he's looking to
[1:44:54] clothe our spiritual stature is not
[1:44:56] based on the amount of blessings we have
[1:44:58] it's based on the character that we have
[1:45:00] amen in christ amen our maturity amen
[1:45:03] the character is the thing he's going to
[1:45:06] clothe amen
[1:45:09] are we still seeing souls say do we do
[1:45:10] we pray for one another these are you
[1:45:12] know this is basic stuff well do we do
[1:45:14] it because most churches don't
[1:45:16] pray for your pastor pray for one
[1:45:18] another
[1:45:18] pray pray for soul are we giving christ
[1:45:20] the preeminence see what kind of a
[1:45:22] character are we presenting to him to
[1:45:24] clothe
[1:45:25] amen i'm not looking to wear an inflated
[1:45:28] sense of self-importance i'm not looking
[1:45:30] to be an elite group or i'm right and
[1:45:32] the rest of the world's wrong but this
[1:45:34] scripture says to be closed with
[1:45:36] humility
[1:45:38] amen
[1:45:39] god resists the prophecy of grace to the
[1:45:41] humble humble yourselves therefore
[1:45:45] under the mighty hand of god
[1:45:47] that he may exalt you in due time the
[1:45:49] scripture says in colossians 3 put on
[1:45:51] therefore as the elect of god holy and
[1:45:54] beloved bowels of mercies kindness
[1:45:57] humbleness of mind meekness
[1:45:58] long-suffering forbearing one another
[1:46:01] and forgiving one another if any man
[1:46:04] have a quarrel against any even as
[1:46:05] christ forgave you so also do ye and
[1:46:08] above all these things put on charity
[1:46:13] which is the bond of perfectness amen
[1:46:16] listen we can have faith through
[1:46:17] mountains we can know mysteries but if
[1:46:18] we lack charity it profits us nothing
[1:46:22] god is looking at our character he's
[1:46:23] looking at us as sons and daughters of
[1:46:25] god he's not inquiring how well we
[1:46:27] understand the message intellectually
[1:46:30] he's not looking at how gifted we are
[1:46:32] god's not gonna ask us how loud we
[1:46:34] shouted or if we jumped high see we
[1:46:35] compare ourselves with ourselves
[1:46:38] that's not what god's looking at god's
[1:46:39] not asking brother alex did you preach
[1:46:41] the house down that day or this that no
[1:46:43] he's looking to see what kind of
[1:46:45] character we have
[1:46:47] that's what he's looking at amen brother
[1:46:49] bram says this is as you fall in love
[1:46:51] with god fall in love with god with all
[1:46:53] your heart and when you do that you'll
[1:46:54] fall in love with every member of your
[1:46:56] church
[1:46:57] and every member of everybody else's
[1:46:59] church
[1:47:00] with all your heart amen
[1:47:02] see god's not god's love is not like our
[1:47:05] human love amen
[1:47:07] i was thinking of the scripture this
[1:47:08] morning i believe it's in the 114th
[1:47:10] psalm
[1:47:11] the bible says let the righteous smite
[1:47:14] me it shall be a kindness
[1:47:16] amen we look at the hardships the
[1:47:18] difficulty of our christian life
[1:47:20] and it it like i said we we let it we
[1:47:23] let it bother us so much amen the love
[1:47:25] of god
[1:47:27] what you think about this just first
[1:47:28] thing the love of god can seem so cruel
[1:47:30] to a man
[1:47:32] amen
[1:47:33] you're like
[1:47:34] brother i know what you're talking about
[1:47:35] listen we
[1:47:37] it was it was not even 100 years ago 80
[1:47:40] years ago
[1:47:41] there was a group of jews that lived in
[1:47:42] germany lived in eastern and western
[1:47:44] europe and these people were brutalized
[1:47:47] and they were murdered families were
[1:47:48] separated
[1:47:50] putting gas chambers experimented on
[1:47:53] treat all kinds of horrible treatment
[1:47:55] torture ungodly untoward things just the
[1:47:58] most wicked vile things happen to these
[1:47:59] people
[1:48:01] so brutal and
[1:48:03] human
[1:48:04] it was the tender hand of jehovah
[1:48:08] well there's a quote we don't use every
[1:48:10] day that was the tender hand of jehovah
[1:48:12] bringing the people to the promise
[1:48:15] it looks so cruel looks so brutal and
[1:48:16] vicious sometimes god will put you in a
[1:48:19] place in your life and it looks so it
[1:48:21] looks so despondent
[1:48:23] you might feel like you're further away
[1:48:25] from god than you've ever felt in your
[1:48:26] life
[1:48:28] well praise the lord
[1:48:30] for the rest of that saint in the third
[1:48:32] exit is that same tender hand it's
[1:48:33] leading us to the tree of life
[1:48:37] the bible says the song of solomon set
[1:48:39] me as a seal upon that heart a seal upon
[1:48:41] that arm for love is strong as death
[1:48:44] there's a jealousy that's as cruel or
[1:48:47] severe in the hebrew it's as severe as
[1:48:48] the grave
[1:48:50] listen god is a jealous god he's jealous
[1:48:52] over you yes amen
[1:48:55] he's so jealous over you
[1:48:58] amen
[1:48:59] that's why he won't allow you
[1:49:02] to go to your own devices i remember
[1:49:03] when i first got saved i was reading
[1:49:05] smith wigglesworth's memoirs and you
[1:49:07] know all it's interesting me there's
[1:49:08] another man a great anointing ministry
[1:49:11] people always wanted his a man told his
[1:49:13] anointing that would have a ministry
[1:49:14] like his but you know what his own words
[1:49:16] were about it he said everybody looks at
[1:49:18] this ministry they see the gift of god
[1:49:20] they see the blessings what they don't
[1:49:22] see
[1:49:24] is that god has broken me
[1:49:26] over and over and over again to get me
[1:49:29] this place a thousand times he's broken
[1:49:31] me to get me here
[1:49:34] you think about brother brandon this man
[1:49:37] what he went through to have this mess
[1:49:39] it's all we wish we had his anointing no
[1:49:41] you really don't
[1:49:43] you're not willing to drink from this
[1:49:45] cup all right not talking about you i'm
[1:49:46] talking about people
[1:49:48] hey man
[1:49:50] it looked cruel
[1:49:51] what he went through
[1:49:54] that was his own testament god has
[1:49:56] broken me amen bill's worth over and
[1:49:58] over and over again
[1:50:00] sometimes it feels like we spend our
[1:50:01] whole time in the potter's wheel we're
[1:50:03] wondering are we ever going to get off
[1:50:04] the wheel it's just spinning around
[1:50:06] everywhere man i'm getting dizzy i need
[1:50:08] to take some pills or something over and
[1:50:10] over and over he's just mashing it down
[1:50:12] oh we get oh man it's looking pretty
[1:50:14] good smash
[1:50:19] it seems cruel
[1:50:21] almost doesn't it
[1:50:24] what's the pure honestly the crew to
[1:50:25] jeremiah when he was in that pit right
[1:50:28] it looked cruel to isaiah i look cruel
[1:50:30] these men look cruel to moses god why
[1:50:32] why have you even treated his people
[1:50:35] we mistake the kindness of god for
[1:50:37] cruelty many times
[1:50:41] amen
[1:50:43] it seems so cruel to us
[1:50:45] because god's jealous over you is why
[1:50:48] amen
[1:50:49] his love is not how much you're blessed
[1:50:51] it's not the the bright skies or the
[1:50:53] stormy clouds that's not his love what
[1:50:55] is his love the proof of his love is
[1:50:57] what in your election
[1:51:02] i mean i know he loves me he elected you
[1:51:06] praise the lord amen i want to remind
[1:51:08] you this today god did not elect you
[1:51:10] because you believe in him
[1:51:13] the devil's believing tremble
[1:51:15] god did not elect you because you
[1:51:17] believe in him god elected you because
[1:51:19] he believes in you
[1:51:23] god puts something in you that even when
[1:51:25] you don't believe it anymore god
[1:51:27] believes in you
[1:51:29] god looks at your life from before the
[1:51:31] foundation of the world god looks at you
[1:51:33] where you're at today and he sees the
[1:51:35] real you he's not discouraged he's not
[1:51:38] upset he's not ringing his hands he
[1:51:41] looks at you and he sees a masterpiece
[1:51:43] where others see trouble where you see
[1:51:45] chaos where you see discouragement
[1:51:48] he says there's somebody i can trust
[1:51:50] with my power
[1:51:51] amen
[1:51:53] you gotta be kidding me
[1:51:55] the proof of his love is an election
[1:51:57] amen think about this all these prophets
[1:51:59] they coveted with elijah had
[1:52:02] they coveted what he had
[1:52:04] but god didn't give it to any of them he
[1:52:06] gave it to one
[1:52:08] amen you're one in a million today
[1:52:11] amen you're a chosen vessel you might
[1:52:13] not have an easy life god did not ordain
[1:52:15] you to an easy life he ordained you to
[1:52:18] eternal life
[1:52:21] in order to chase one thing he ordained
[1:52:24] you to plant you and settle and
[1:52:25] establish and make you steadfast
[1:52:27] in the position that he has called you
[1:52:30] too
[1:52:31] hey man

[1:52:39] don't know who where everybody's at amen
[1:52:40] but you you might just i don't know what
[1:52:42] your week was like
[1:52:44] i know where i spent the last part of my
[1:52:46] week was under my house
[1:52:47] the geniuses who built my house decided
[1:52:49] to put a crawl space in there that's
[1:52:51] about two inches
[1:52:52] wider than i am
[1:52:55] there's that weight thing again man it's
[1:52:56] always coming back to bible at least i'm
[1:52:58] short enough
[1:53:00] man i don't know how see you know what
[1:53:01] there's a
[1:53:02] praise god here's the blessing i was
[1:53:04] short enough to fit in there now i
[1:53:05] finally come back i'm here in church
[1:53:06] getting the revelation
[1:53:09] hey man as i sat under my house
[1:53:11] and i watched the water gush out like
[1:53:13] the rock in the wilderness
[1:53:16] i sat there and i thought what a
[1:53:17] blessing
[1:53:20] listen i i make like you know what we
[1:53:23] get so worked that's not a big deal you
[1:53:25] can fix plumbing oh i sort of can
[1:53:29] plumbing can be fixed but
[1:53:31] some of us are going through real trials
[1:53:33] you you might have lost loved ones you
[1:53:34] might listen you might have gone through
[1:53:36] the worst trial your life you might have
[1:53:37] went to work this week and beat your
[1:53:38] head against the wall and you might have
[1:53:40] wondered why you're even still on this
[1:53:41] earth but i want to remind you listen
[1:53:44] the proof of his love is in your
[1:53:45] election
[1:53:46] you're here today and you've heard the
[1:53:48] word and you've accepted it you believe
[1:53:50] with all your heart that's god's love to
[1:53:53] you don't ever forsake that
[1:53:56] that's worth more than gold it's worth
[1:53:58] more than fame it's worth it more than
[1:54:00] anything you can come up with or esteem
[1:54:03] amen
[1:54:05] that's what i'm getting at earlier amen
[1:54:07] we god give us a position god give you a
[1:54:10] position to give me a position
[1:54:13] not to compete with each other's
[1:54:14] position
[1:54:16] that's what brother bam talks about in
[1:54:17] the adoption series ephraim wants
[1:54:18] manassas land and they want this and
[1:54:20] that
[1:54:21] see where we get in troubles we compare
[1:54:23] ourselves with ourselves
[1:54:25] that's right
[1:54:26] amen
[1:54:28] well it's just me i guess
[1:54:31] you know you see elon musk here with all
[1:54:33] this money well i could have done that
[1:54:34] yeah sure whatever
[1:54:38] well i wish i could do this i wish you
[1:54:39] could achieve listen god give you a
[1:54:41] position because he wants you to fulfill
[1:54:43] that position he don't need you to
[1:54:45] fulfill mine and he sure don't want me
[1:54:47] to do yours and i don't want your job by
[1:54:48] the way you can keep it
[1:54:50] i got enough on my hands
[1:54:52] amen
[1:54:54] listen the scripture says they that
[1:54:56] compare themselves with themselves
[1:54:58] they're not wise amen god gave you your
[1:55:00] position god give you your land for one
[1:55:02] purpose for you to cultivate your
[1:55:04] position
[1:55:06] you call you cultivate the police the
[1:55:07] piece of ground that god gave you you
[1:55:10] sanctify you present your vessels as a
[1:55:12] vessel of honor to him amen
[1:55:15] amen i speak about this frequently but i
[1:55:17] want to remind you again
[1:55:18] matthew 25 jesus talks about the talents
[1:55:21] he gave one man too and gave one man
[1:55:23] five you get the same commendation
[1:55:26] amen
[1:55:27] he's not looking at how much you make
[1:55:29] he's looking at did you multiply what i
[1:55:31] gave you if it's two talents if it's
[1:55:33] five you get the same commendation
[1:55:36] see we compare ourselves with each other
[1:55:38] well i wish i was so
[1:55:40] probably nobody wishes they were me but
[1:55:43] i wish i was so and so i wish i was that
[1:55:44] but it's not wise amen
[1:55:47] i like how i heard somebody put this the
[1:55:48] problem when we do that is we always we
[1:55:50] always compare our worst outtakes to
[1:55:52] somebody else's highlight reel
[1:55:54] we see the highlights of their life we
[1:55:55] see the outtakes in the bloopers like oh
[1:55:57] man i i can't measure up you're looking
[1:55:59] at two completely different things
[1:56:01] you're comparing yourself with somebody
