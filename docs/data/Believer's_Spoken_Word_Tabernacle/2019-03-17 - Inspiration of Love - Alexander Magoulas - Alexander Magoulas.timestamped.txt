[37:27] that the mountains that seems so tall
[37:30] Amen even when we were in sin and in
[37:33] darkness and we weren't looking for him
[37:35] yet he was holding us a man surely
[37:38] goodness and mercy have followed us all
[37:40] the days of our life amen there's
[37:41] something that's held us when we weren't
[37:43] keeping ourselves Amen well I'm a
[37:46] witness to that I don't know about you
[37:47] all but I wasn't born born again a man I
[37:50] had to get born again so there's lots of
[37:53] things in my life I'm not real proud of
[37:54] that as a sinner when I was away from
[37:56] God remember he was keeping me all that
[37:58] time even when I wasn't when I wasn't a
[38:01] Christian yet I was a son of God he knew
[38:03] me he knew you before the foundation of
[38:05] the world and he's a great Shepherd and
[38:08] Bishop of your soul is that right he
[38:10] won't suffer you to fall into the snare
[38:12] of the enemy this morning I believe he's
[38:14] faithful a man god bless you good to be
[38:16] with you this morning if you have your
[38:18] Bibles we're looking to the scripture
[38:19] 2nd Timothy and the third chapter good
[38:23] to see each one that could make it and
[38:25] we just pray the Lord would bless you in
[38:28] a special way you know I just just think
[38:33] God's so good amen I couldn't tell it
[38:37] all if I had the time the whole world
[38:39] could contain it and that's just in my
[38:41] life and in your lives and to think
[38:43] about all that God has done what a great
[38:45] God we serve and I don't believe he's
[38:48] done yet with us I believe the best is
[38:51] yet to come do you believe that amen
[38:53] praise the Lord second Timothy the third
[38:55] chapter and we're gonna start in the
[38:57] fourteenth verse a familiar portion of
[38:59] scripture this morning and hopefully if
[39:01] you read your Bible it says here in the
[39:03] fourteenth verse 2nd Timothy chapter 3
[39:06] says but continue thou in the things
[39:08] which thou has learned and has to be
[39:11] assured of knowing of whom thou hast
[39:14] learned them and that from a child thou
[39:16] hast known the Holy Scriptures which are
[39:18] able to make the wise into
[39:20] salvation through faith which is in
[39:23] Christ Jesus all Scripture is given by
[39:26] inspiration of God and is profitable for
[39:30] doctrine for reproof for correction for
[39:34] instruction and righteousness
[39:36] why do you see this worth that you know
[39:38] there's a purpose behind it why that the
[39:41] man of God may be perfect thoroughly
[39:44] furnished unto all good works amen let's
[39:48] just bow our heads for word of Prayer
[39:49] this morning Lord were thankful as we
[39:53] bow our heads and our hearts before your
[39:55] throne this morning to know that you've
[39:58] given an inspired word the the the the
[40:00] Greek it means it's been breathed by God
[40:02] that you've spoken father to your
[40:05] apostles and prophets and times of old
[40:07] that they could take and to write down
[40:10] these inspired words they were not the
[40:12] words of their own thinking or their own
[40:14] ability but like that pen in their hand
[40:17] they were used by you father - - just to
[40:20] give the will of God that your children
[40:22] might be able to read and to understand
[40:24] that they might be thoroughly furnished
[40:26] unto all good works and Lord you've
[40:29] preserved this inspired Word through
[40:31] persecutions and afflictions and dark
[40:34] ages and through the test of trying it
[40:37] you've you've preserved an inspired Word
[40:39] and you've even given us a translation
[40:42] that we could learn and to have this
[40:44] morning and father I'm thankful that you
[40:46] would preserve this inspired Word but
[40:48] Lord I'm just as aware this morning that
[40:50] you have the Word of God made flesh this
[40:52] morning in your children that are here
[40:54] and you've preserved them through their
[40:56] lives and through trials and situations
[40:59] and even when their forebears and their
[41:01] ancestors were in danger you spared
[41:04] their life that your children might be
[41:06] made manifest this morning and just as
[41:09] you've protected the scripture in these
[41:11] words from certain destruction and from
[41:14] the hands of men so to have you
[41:15] preserved your children you've brought
[41:18] us here this morning that we might hear
[41:20] this revealed word that we might hear
[41:22] the message of the hour and have an
[41:24] understanding of what you have for your
[41:27] children that would be profitable for us
[41:29] that you might be blessed in our myths
[41:31] that you might
[41:32] fight your people father now knowing
[41:34] these things we just want to commit this
[41:35] service our lives and our hearts into
[41:38] your hands this morning that you would
[41:39] come in a special way and that your
[41:41] spirit have preeminence in our hearts
[41:44] and in this service that we might have
[41:46] eyes to see ears to hear hearts to
[41:49] receive all that you would have for us
[41:50] father we don't want to miss one thing
[41:52] this morning that you have for your
[41:54] children and the cares of this world and
[41:56] the distractions and the vanity made
[41:58] they'd all be cast aside this morning me
[42:00] may the Holy Spirit sweep in with a
[42:03] mighty fire and an unction to drive up
[42:05] darkness or to drive out confused and in
[42:08] doubts and move mightily and your
[42:10] children father Fuger leave you've got a
[42:12] great purpose in each one that have
[42:14] gathered this morning and we believe
[42:16] that you come because you keep all your
[42:17] appointments we actually bless this word
[42:19] now and your children and moving the
[42:21] service father may you just find a place
[42:24] in our hearts that's been made ready
[42:25] that you might come and move in a
[42:27] special way and father that all that
[42:29] said and done may you receive great
[42:30] glory and honor in our myths for the ask
[42:32] it in the mighty name of our Lord and
[42:34] Savior Jesus Christ and the bride says
[42:36] Amen god bless as you see that amen
[42:40] I want to speak about a simple maybe
[42:42] kind of a thought or direction from this
[42:46] scripture the inspiration of God as I
[42:50] said it means it's been breathed upon
[42:51] her God breed the word inspiration she
[42:55] only occurs twice in the Bible and I'll
[42:57] read the other one here in a little bit
[42:58] but it actually occurs twice in the
[43:00] Bible but as we know the idea of
[43:03] inspiration is all through the Bible the
[43:05] whole thing's inspired amen
[43:06] praise the Lord so it's the whole
[43:08] thing's inspired that's my brother Brent
[43:10] could say when you read the Bible if you
[43:12] don't see Christ and every scripture go
[43:14] back and read it again so Christ is
[43:16] revealing himself from the entire body
[43:18] of the Word of God he's revealed himself
[43:20] in this day the seals have been open and
[43:23] it's like a new book to us can you
[43:25] imagine you look at maybe a Hebrew
[43:28] scholar and some of them you know you
[43:30] can read your Scofield if you have a
[43:31] Scofield some of them look at the book
[43:33] of Esther and they dispute whether it
[43:35] should even be in the Bible why is
[43:36] what is the purpose of it it doesn't
[43:38] even mention the name of God in it and
[43:40] yeah to the Christian when this book is
[43:42] open to you and it's become a new book
[43:43] you realizes the tender hand of Jehovah
[43:46] the entire time even though his name
[43:48] might not be mentioned specifically yet
[43:50] you see the nature or the life of God in
[43:53] the entire story when you see Esther and
[43:55] you see her tribulation what she's going
[43:57] through you realize it's talking about
[43:58] Christ in a bride and how she would be
[44:00] used amen
[44:01] she was born for such a time as this so
[44:04] you see the hand of God in every
[44:05] scripture even in the disappointments
[44:08] and the failures and the discouragement
[44:10] these men and women in the Bible go
[44:12] through yet it was the hand of God
[44:13] trying to show the people something
[44:16] showing them Christ in his people amen
[44:19] and so the whole Bible the Bible tells
[44:20] us that prophecy came not in the old
[44:22] time by the will of man but holy men of
[44:24] God wasn't the man that was holy or the
[44:26] mountain that was holy was the God in I
[44:28] mean men holy men of God spake as they
[44:30] were moved by the Holy Ghost
[44:32] so they were inspired by this spirit a
[44:35] man I'm thankful this morning to be able
[44:36] to preach to you I'm grateful to be here
[44:38] again you know this is uh this is one of
[44:40] the finest groups I get to preach to
[44:41] just be real honest with you and and you
[44:43] have that you have that welcoming spirit
[44:45] that brother man talks about but a
[44:47] Christian supposed to have that and I
[44:49] like it because you all come here and
[44:51] many you come early to pray amen and
[44:54] even I this in my notes and then they
[44:55] come back so we're gonna pray this more
[44:57] he's a lord well I knew I was inspired I
[44:59] know about the rest you what you think
[45:00] about it but I was inspired I was just
[45:02] thinking about this idea we come
[45:03] together because the Prophet said to
[45:05] come together and the pray the different
[45:06] officers come together the musicians
[45:08] come together and they begin to pray
[45:09] before the servicing you come in here in
[45:11] your last side the way to the world and
[45:13] your distractions and your cares and you
[45:15] begin maybe a half-hour whatever you
[45:17] come and early you begin to seek the
[45:19] Lord amen and yeah and you're not just
[45:21] doing it hopefully because the Prophet
[45:22] said to do it so I better do it but you
[45:24] doing it because you have a recognition
[45:26] that you'll be creating an atmosphere
[45:28] it's create an expectation that God
[45:29] could come by inspiration and so we're
[45:33] looking for the inspiration because
[45:34] listen I've been to churches I'm just
[45:36] bureau honest with you I've been the
[45:37] message churches well they all show up
[45:39] five minutes before service starts well
[45:41] praise the Lord well that's not you
[45:43] hopefully so she fits I guess they come
[45:46] in five mins for service starts
[45:48] everything together and I'll tell you
[45:50] from my experience now such as my
[45:52] experience it's the word so brother
[45:53] Graham says but from my own experience
[45:55] it makes a difference in the service the
[45:57] attitude that you come in with and if
[45:58] you prayed if you seek the Lord the
[46:00] atmosphere that you're setting makes a
[46:02] difference whether you realize it I
[46:03] realize it anyway I had a man come to me
[46:06] one time and he'd been in the brown
[46:07] tabernacle when he was young he said
[46:09] well you know sometimes brother Ram came
[46:10] to service maybe even later maybe five
[46:12] minutes for service started he said I
[46:14] said well that's true probably because
[46:15] at the hospital praying for the sick or
[46:17] visiting somebody at home not because he
[46:19] hit the snooze button five times and
[46:21] then that wasn't why I look stupid he
[46:24] was God hey man I know why he showed up
[46:26] late it wasn't because he was too tired
[46:28] to get up and show up and pray that's
[46:30] not what he was doing a member he
[46:32] understood is that right and this way
[46:33] he's telling the people not being a
[46:34] hypocrite but he's telling that people
[46:36] when you come together and you seek the
[46:39] Lord and you create an atmosphere and
[46:41] expectation of the inspiration of God is
[46:44] going to come down to the service and
[46:46] he'll take the preacher claw off as
[46:47] notes you know walk right into your
[46:49] living room and walk right into your
[46:50] personal life when you maybe you weren't
[46:52] even expecting it and he'll come and
[46:54] speak to you he'll read your mail I'll
[46:55] let you know where you're at in life now
[46:58] you know where you're at
[46:59] Amen people come up with a prayer London
[47:01] brother Brent oh my their address and
[47:03] their past they knew all that there was
[47:05] a new information to them but there was
[47:07] a recognition that God was speaking
[47:09] through that man that God knew about
[47:11] them and God was mindful of them and
[47:13] you've come with the same now listen
[47:15] we're not up here this more for me to
[47:16] have a discernment line but the same God
[47:18] still gives inspiration through the
[47:21] ministry through his people he still
[47:23] speaks today and if you believe that
[47:26] that's why you dad and you come together
[47:28] amen amen so I'm like I said I've been a
[47:31] witness of it let me say this I've been
[47:33] places you know I think about these
[47:35] prophets like I talk about these men of
[47:37] old they didn't always have a great
[47:38] group of people like you to preach to
[47:39] that most the times the people's ever
[47:42] preached to one to kill him her psalm in
[47:43] half or stone them or whatever else and
[47:46] fortunately that's not been my
[47:47] experience most of the time now I've
[47:49] been overseas before I had did actually
[47:50] have to have armed guards come protect
[47:52] me one time that's a whole nother
[47:53] situation listen I've been places where
[47:56] the church had to inspect the water ball
[47:58] before it drink because they poison
[47:59] preachers where I was at
[48:01] not send it to compare myself to these
[48:03] men of all but listen these men they
[48:05] they they had to preach the people that
[48:06] didn't want to hear it most of the time
[48:08] a man and we're so blessed
[48:10] just even unnatural to have a place like
[48:12] this in this country where the doors are
[48:14] still open to come and seek his face and
[48:16] hear this word of God were right blessed
[48:18] this morning to be able to do this and
[48:19] I'm very blessed to stand before you and
[48:22] not a bunch of people in the world that
[48:23] when an ass against me with their teeth
[48:24] and take up stones amen
[48:26] praise the Lord well anyway and the
[48:30] reason I say this is these people that
[48:32] these prophets would come and speak to
[48:33] these people and they would say things
[48:35] that would make them unpopular and they
[48:37] would say things that would cause maybe
[48:38] the people to even want to kill them and
[48:40] why would they do that why would they go
[48:42] listen nobody in the right mind says you
[48:44] know I'm gonna go to a big group of
[48:45] people that are looking to kill me and
[48:47] I'm gonna make him more mad by telling
[48:49] that this will be God and there's
[48:51] stiff-necked and their uncircumcised
[48:53] well why did they do that it wasn't
[48:54] because they wanted to do it but they
[48:57] found that there was a spirit that
[48:58] inspired them something constrain them
[49:01] in their life beyond their own ability
[49:03] even the Prophet Jeremiah he was
[49:05] discouraged one time as a preacher
[49:06] preachers get discouraged too and he was
[49:09] discouraged one time as a preacher he
[49:11] said you know I'm not gonna administer a
[49:13] preaching this name or make mention of
[49:15] his name anymore he said I don't want
[49:16] anything to do with him every time I
[49:18] stand up and open my mouth that people
[49:20] come against it they criticize it they
[49:22] were throw me into jail they call me all
[49:24] kinds of names but he finds what he
[49:26] tried to restrain it he tried to hold it
[49:29] back he said I was like a fire shut up
[49:31] in my bones and they begin to smolder
[49:34] and they begin to burn his life and
[49:36] nobody tried to hold back the less he
[49:38] could control it and finally he begin to
[49:40] speak in the name of the Lord he said I
[49:42] can't help myself there's something on
[49:44] the inside it's moving me
[49:49] maybe popular but I'm in the hand of
[49:51] Almighty God and the Holy Ghost movin
[49:56] hallelujah I want you to send the Spirit
[49:58] of God in that mansion and these
[50:01] prophets it's so move them brother rest
[50:03] until he acted out the very life that
[50:06] was in that they would go and march
[50:08] through the streets with yokes of iron
[50:11] on and laid on their side for days
[50:15] here's a man by the name of Moses
[50:18] training the wisdom of the Egyptians and
[50:20] the people honed their hearts and made a
[50:22] golden calf and then he finds himself
[50:25] standing in the gap pleading before God
[50:28] to God do not forsake this people if you
[50:33] do this the Egyptians will say you are
[50:35] not able to deliver this people don't
[50:38] remember your promise don't remember
[50:40] your promise to Abraham and to Isaac and
[50:43] to Jacob is it God if you would not
[50:47] deliver them then take me home on Paul
[50:54] said his brother were blinded for our
[50:56] sakes is that I could wish myself
[50:59] accursed that they might have him in
[51:01] somebody listen that's not a man that's
[51:05] not a man and a man says you know what
[51:07] forget them people I preached in him and
[51:09] they won't listen and they don't care
[51:12] about anything about God
[51:13] I must you know what they got what they
[51:14] deserved but there is something on the
[51:18] inside that man there was something on
[51:22] the inside of Moses brother is Christ it
[51:25] Moses and that spirit seized upon their
[51:29] lives to Christ
[51:34] some of their own thinking but getting
[51:37] down in their lives you think about
[51:42] Moses the type of Christ to deliver you
[51:44] they want Joseph in a prison for 13
[51:46] years a perfect type of Christ these men
[51:49] weren't thinking to themselves man now
[51:51] what do I have to do today to be a type
[51:53] of Christ I'll make sure to do this on
[51:56] this day these men were not biologists
[51:59] but
[51:59] something had come upon their lives they
[52:02] constrain the house and they begin to
[52:04] move by the Holy Spirit
[52:10] hey man listen if God could do that in
[52:14] their life through the blood of bulls
[52:17] and goats then what about a born-again
[52:19] word washed sanctified believer filled
[52:23] with the Holy Ghost whose nature has
[52:26] been changed to the nature of God what
[52:30] can he do in your life can you break the
[52:33] chains of sin he can throw off the
[52:35] oppression it's in there not so easily
[52:38] beset us he's more than able help
[52:42] somebody he is more that he can do it
[52:47] for you to him and he's not a respecter
[52:53] of persons
[52:54] hey man but they were so anointed by
[52:56] that spirit they begin to act that
[52:58] Miliband says this and looking from
[53:00] Jesus he says every prophet every divine
[53:04] men that come from the presence of God
[53:05] always worked under certain inspirations
[53:09] which was directed by God he says
[53:11] ministers tonight preached under
[53:13] inspiration directed by God seers
[53:16] tonight work under the inspiration of
[53:17] visions directed by God I can do nothing
[53:20] he said except the father shows me and
[53:24] whatever the father shows me I go do it
[53:27] you think about this because I got said
[53:30] you got a man like Moses his natural
[53:31] education the wisdom of Egypt did not
[53:34] deliver those people and the wisdom of
[53:38] media was unable to deliver those people
[53:39] hey man the wisdom of Egypt did not
[53:42] teach him to stand the gaff and
[53:45] intercede for her people and acid praise
[53:48] the Lord somebody there was something in
[53:50] his life that was great a hurry man that
[53:52] they didn't even know think about them
[53:54] how many times you do something in your
[53:56] life as a Christian he said what was I
[53:58] thinking
[53:58] and nothing was ever talked about this
[54:01] as many times you feel inspired to do
[54:03] something and you go do it and you begin
[54:05] to question what was I thinking he says
[54:08] time you may think you did exactly what
[54:11] you should not have done he said but if
[54:14] you'll be patient and you watch it was
[54:16] God the whole time so don't you say a
[54:19] little something that no time I see your
[54:21] foot in your mouth
[54:22] hey man I'm talking about the
[54:24] inspiration to God you'll move you do
[54:26] something maybe it's just something
[54:27] maybe you don't even realize it you say
[54:30] certain something to somewhere they come
[54:31] back that was just what I needed nobody
[54:33] mouths what I was gone brother sister
[54:35] nobody knows what I was struggling with
[54:37] but God did something just sent me a
[54:40] little card ooh you send a little
[54:41] something to me to church and let make
[54:43] something to me it's not inspiration if
[54:46] you're believer that's more than gold or
[54:49] silver or popularity so now it means for
[54:54] your soul oh yeah
[54:57] praise the Lord I believe today the
[54:59] bride of Jesus Christ has gathered many
[55:01] places around this country many places
[55:03] in the world many of you gathered here
[55:05] this morning under the inspiration of
[55:07] God amen praise the Lord now we didn't
[55:11] gather here just because there's a man's
[55:13] ideal hopefully we're just to socialize
[55:15] but we gathered here not to hear some
[55:18] lecture because I'm not a good lecture
[55:20] well you probably already feel like
[55:21] what's he doing and then not to hear a
[55:24] lecture on some thought or whatever is
[55:26] what we believe that this word of God is
[55:28] inspired that's why you're here the Lord
[55:31] said to assemble yourselves together we
[55:33] believe that the word is inspired is
[55:35] that right see you've gathered together
[55:37] under the inspiration listen the
[55:40] inspiration is no longer just on the
[55:41] page hey man I'm bringing you somewhere
[55:44] now the inspiration that was on this
[55:46] page is no longer just on the page but
[55:49] it couldn't find a place it drop down
[55:51] into your heart and something begin to
[55:54] stir inside of you like these men and
[55:56] women vocal so now I'm gonna gather
[55:57] myself together let us go into the house
[56:02] of the Lord I'll enter his gates with
[56:04] Thanksgiving I don't courts with praise
[56:14] mommy told her cuz daddy told you but
[56:18] there's something you're like now the
[56:19] inspiration has found a residence that's
[56:28] why you pray before service that's why
[56:30] you do these things you haven't
[56:32] understanding I want that same
[56:34] inspiration that was in the prophets
[56:37] meetings that same inspiration pen this
[56:39] Bible I mean in my own life
[56:42] listen 1990 probably some percent of the
[56:45] time Bible tells you what to do but
[56:46] there's things in your life if I don't
[56:48] say well you know and when you go home
[56:49] this way go a certain way that you
[56:51] wouldn't normally go to avoid a car rack
[56:54] or go work at a certain job even though
[56:55] it looks bad good work the Bible don't
[56:57] tell you those things but the God that I
[57:00] wrote this Bible inspired these men
[57:03] could inspire you with the same
[57:05] inspiration with the same power before
[57:08] tell things to discern things amen my
[57:12] mom has you've been in his presence see
[57:16] when you when you've been in his
[57:17] presence if you've ever been in his
[57:19] presence you know what it's like to be
[57:21] there you know it's octiline and you
[57:23] know it's like when you're in his
[57:24] presence to receive that inspiration is
[57:26] that right listen the program said we
[57:29] put too much stress on the mechanics he
[57:30] says a nothing on the dynamic hey man
[57:33] he said no nervous is anything wrong
[57:35] within the Canon there's nothing wrong
[57:36] with mechanic but we leave it on the
[57:38] page and we don't talk about that now
[57:40] listen the dynamics more than just
[57:41] speaking in tongues promise I'm shouting
[57:43] and dancing that's good that's fine the
[57:45] time that makes you do that but it's the
[57:47] very life behind it that will make this
[57:49] word live in your life cuz listen I'll
[57:52] be honest with you I can't make this
[57:53] live in my life and neither can you
[57:55] but there's a god that can live inside
[57:58] of you and make this word less
[58:01] he can make us work do the things he
[58:03] said it would do he said these signs
[58:05] shall follow them that believe is that
[58:07] right you're not producing it did not
[58:09] manufacture it follows you because the
[58:12] God that is supernatural
[58:14] he's a supernatural God in the
[58:16] supernatural things and your lives is
[58:18] supernatural because you're born again
[58:20] of the spirit
[58:25] that's that dynamic whether we said it
[58:27] throws this mortal body into subjection
[58:30] what to his word hallelujah
[58:35] the balance is listen here you hear 1956
[58:37] he says if our nature becomes converted
[58:41] from the things of the world to the
[58:43] nature of the Holy Spirit God will take
[58:46] his stand he will abide on us now watch
[58:48] what he says this is really important
[58:49] and what she cats this he's has inspired
[58:52] believers taking the inspired Word and
[58:57] men inspired believers raise your hand
[59:00] inspired believers got some inspired
[59:02] believers this morning inspired
[59:04] believers not just make believers not
[59:06] just carnal believers inspired believers
[59:08] taking the inspired word those two
[59:10] together brings the results it brings
[59:13] the word to life it's how much the world
[59:17] little my life get inspired and then get
[59:20] inspired listen this Bible does not need
[59:21] to be inspired any more than already is
[59:23] this Bible this Word of God is as
[59:26] inspired as it's ever gonna get but the
[59:28] question is today not is the Bible
[59:30] inspired but are you inspired it's the
[59:34] inspiration in our life because if the
[59:35] inspiration is in your life inspired
[59:37] believers take the inspired Word and
[59:40] that's what brings the results say I'm
[59:45] suffering with addiction but I got
[59:46] sickness get inspired the inspiration
[59:49] will take you out of that situation and
[59:51] put you in the promised land of God look
[59:55] as you can take a grain of corn and laid
[59:57] on a desk I'm a golden desk he says no
[59:59] matter how else polished it might be 14
[1:00:01] carats it will never produce any more
[1:00:03] corn no matter how pretty the desk is
[1:00:05] how genuine gold is it's laying on or
[1:00:07] how real how Germa ties the corn is the
[1:00:10] cores got to
[1:00:11] on rich fertile dirt to bring forth the
[1:00:14] results hey man
[1:00:15] notice the problems not the seed hey man
[1:00:18] you go back and read the Bible the
[1:00:20] problem the parable of the seed sir
[1:00:21] the problem is not the seed the promise
[1:00:24] where did you plant it you planted much
[1:00:26] a formal denomination and man's ideas in
[1:00:28] your own thinking a bunch of formalism
[1:00:30] or do you plant it in the promise and
[1:00:33] then you put it in a pretty desperate
[1:00:34] supreme destiny ground it's prepared
[1:00:36] ground do you put it in that
[1:00:38] predestinated ground and allow it to
[1:00:40] grow hey man look you didn't water you
[1:00:44] didn't plant octave increase he gives
[1:00:46] his spirit and gives inspiration and you
[1:00:49] begin the water with prayer and you
[1:00:50] begin to water with praise and you watch
[1:00:52] it take on a life of its own something
[1:00:55] you couldn't do within yourself do I
[1:00:57] witness somebody man
[1:00:58] adopted things in your life you could
[1:01:01] not do but what was it God spoke to you
[1:01:04] one day he dealt with your heart and you
[1:01:06] become inspired if God can do it for
[1:01:08] that man if God can do for that sister
[1:01:11] if God can do it for them God can do it
[1:01:14] for me it's not a respecter of persons
[1:01:18] huh that inspiration amuses stir on the
[1:01:22] inside of you and then begins to be
[1:01:24] willing up inside of you like a well of
[1:01:26] water something on the inside working on
[1:01:29] the outside a man listen I think it's
[1:01:32] fair to say this morning let me say this
[1:01:34] inspiration is the lifeline of the
[1:01:36] church hey man say why don't you say
[1:01:40] what cuz the profit Center preached
[1:01:42] about a lifeline he says when you think
[1:01:44] this is the third Exodus is when you
[1:01:45] think you can set a church and order
[1:01:47] more by your intellect better than the
[1:01:49] Holy Ghost is you've taken the life line
[1:01:51] out of the framework hey man you
[1:01:55] understand what I'm saying we can read
[1:01:57] this Bible we can study these quotes and
[1:01:59] we could put everything together just so
[1:02:01] amen praise the Lord somebody
[1:02:03] mother bear said you got to watch out
[1:02:05] for education cuz I'll leave you to this
[1:02:07] the demon of education I'm not setting
[1:02:10] us in education but if you're not
[1:02:11] careful it'll either the demon of
[1:02:13] education
[1:02:14] he says Italy to me I know all well you
[1:02:16] think you know everything
[1:02:18] that many people I hate to say it this
[1:02:20] way but I met many people that think
[1:02:21] they can set the church in order a lot
[1:02:23] better by their own intellect than what
[1:02:25] the Holy Ghost can do but when you've
[1:02:27] done that you've taken to their last
[1:02:29] line out of the church brother Rams head
[1:02:32] the very things not given to preserve
[1:02:35] them from death your lifeline is right
[1:02:37] say guys on the water and he's dropping
[1:02:39] need a preserver well you don't wanna
[1:02:41] jump in there with him and pull you
[1:02:42] under so you put it on a line and you
[1:02:44] throw it out there can you imagine a man
[1:02:46] grab an almond saying you'll love this
[1:02:47] rope I don't like the color no I don't
[1:02:50] like what's made I'll write oh you know
[1:02:51] I don't like this lad about I'm gonna
[1:02:53] cut it off that's the very thing that's
[1:02:55] saving his life and this inspiration of
[1:02:58] God the moving of the Spirit in the
[1:03:00] church so I'm gonna help me out hairy
[1:03:01] man the moving of the Spirit
[1:03:04] I'm just I'm at the letter now the
[1:03:05] letter will kill but the spirit that
[1:03:07] wrote this letter gives life if you if
[1:03:10] you take that spin out so you know I've
[1:03:12] got a better idea
[1:03:13] you've cut off the lifeline of the
[1:03:16] church hey man what about you take it
[1:03:22] right out of the framework so I want you
[1:03:24] think about this if you're believer
[1:03:25] whether you're a husband a wife a
[1:03:26] minister whatever is if you're a
[1:03:28] Christian you need the inspiration of
[1:03:30] God amen brother that said you can't
[1:03:33] read this Bible like it's a newspaper
[1:03:35] and then this is not a bunch of data
[1:03:38] about God and historical facts and
[1:03:41] events that took place it's more than 90
[1:03:43] men if you read it like a newspaper
[1:03:45] that's all it'll ever be to you it'll be
[1:03:47] old news
[1:03:48] it may not always be something that
[1:03:50] happened and not something that's
[1:03:51] happening a man it always been news
[1:03:54] it'll never be prophetic you'll never
[1:03:55] take root in your life and then it'll be
[1:03:59] like a newspaper you listen it's no
[1:04:01] different than me paying you a picture
[1:04:02] of fire this morning
[1:04:03] I can get up here and tell you stories
[1:04:05] about the Prophet and that's fine that's
[1:04:07] good and father I can tell you stories
[1:04:09] about the Prophet I can tell you stories
[1:04:11] in the Bible about a Smith Rock and a
[1:04:13] pillar of fire and as long as they're
[1:04:15] just stories to you that's all they'll
[1:04:18] ever be and I can paint the prettiest
[1:04:20] picture of a fire maybe the best picture
[1:04:23] you've ever seen but when you are in the
[1:04:25] cult today they want to keep you on
[1:04:28] what you need is to come down here the
[1:04:30] doctor and get a couple sticks and start
[1:04:33] rubbing them together and say you know
[1:04:35] I've heard about fire I've talked about
[1:04:37] fire but I gotta have some fire for
[1:04:40] myself I don't forget a couple rocks and
[1:04:42] strike them together I gotta have
[1:04:45] something to keep me warm when I go on
[1:04:47] the church today
[1:04:47] I need that speaks to me not just in
[1:04:50] this building
[1:04:53] what a shame that some of us only hear
[1:04:55] from God on Sunday what a reproach Amen
[1:04:58] somebody that something must only hear
[1:05:00] from God once a week you won't hear from
[1:05:02] that all the time maybe that are the
[1:05:04] sons of God their letter the spirit the
[1:05:07] Bible says God is leaving us he's taking
[1:05:09] us somewhere hey man praise the Lord we
[1:05:14] come here with that somebody paints a
[1:05:16] picture of fire we become art critics
[1:05:19] hey man you ever see this guy walk
[1:05:22] through having the museum there well I
[1:05:24] like this guy's use of color more on
[1:05:26] this guy's pastel yada yadi whatever
[1:05:28] anymore and we put on our tricks well I
[1:05:30] like how this preacher preaches better
[1:05:32] well he's more exciting well he's less
[1:05:34] sweaty
[1:05:34] well he's boring intellectual well he's
[1:05:36] less formal and we've become art critics
[1:05:39] and we begin to look at what how a man
[1:05:41] preaches instead of what is being said
[1:05:44] what is the inspiration I don't care if
[1:05:47] the guy can't preach his way out of a
[1:05:48] paper bag
[1:05:49] but can you cast the inspiration of God
[1:05:52] behind it and then yeah we got a lot of
[1:05:57] painters let's stand the pulp and the
[1:05:59] paint a picture man but I don't want to
[1:06:01] paint you a picture this morning mostly
[1:06:03] because I'm not good at painting
[1:06:05] remember what I want you to do is
[1:06:07] realize that the same fire that elect
[1:06:10] these men up lippies went up in this
[1:06:14] Bible when they wanted his sheep skins
[1:06:16] and in deserts and they received their
[1:06:18] dead to life again and they quenched the
[1:06:20] violence of fire and shut the mouths of
[1:06:22] lions these people whom the scripture
[1:06:25] says the world was not worthy it wasn't
[1:06:30] them but the God that was with them and
[1:06:33] the girl that's in you these people
[1:06:35] today you gather
[1:06:37] here listen the world's not worthy in
[1:06:39] here the world's not worthy of your
[1:06:41] testimony the world's not worthy of the
[1:06:43] grace that God is giving you because
[1:06:46] emergency think about that now you say
[1:06:51] you know ain't no good right word that
[1:06:53] God kept me nothing mean God says nah
[1:06:55] you're my child the world's not worthy
[1:06:58] of you they're not worthy of you
[1:07:01] listen something is taking residence in
[1:07:03] your life there's an inspiration a man
[1:07:08] more than a picture to us or a photo ID
[1:07:11] the identification has to live in I say
[1:07:13] man the RAM says this several places in
[1:07:16] the message where we this of the ark
[1:07:18] 1955 they said there's three elements
[1:07:21] that people live in he says first is the
[1:07:23] humanistic the second is divine
[1:07:26] revelation he said the third is vision
[1:07:27] he's an eye like in prayer when you pray
[1:07:29] for anyone in the humanistic we say well
[1:07:31] I hope you'll get well I'm hoping I'm
[1:07:34] believing with you trying to use all the
[1:07:36] faith that I can't says that's Humana
[1:07:37] he's but the second is divine revelation
[1:07:40] when something is revealed to you you
[1:07:43] know in your heart listen that killer
[1:07:44] come from God
[1:07:45] and then I can get up here and preach
[1:07:48] but like God can give you the
[1:07:49] inspiration of it behind this to show
[1:07:51] you what is being revealed to you a man
[1:07:53] hey man he says you know your heart it's
[1:07:57] going to happen yeah there's nothing but
[1:07:59] the revelation he said the Third's of
[1:08:00] vision it's the set the Lord
[1:08:02] it's when it becomes positive he said
[1:08:03] that's perfectly positive really man
[1:08:05] when he's telling this he tells a story
[1:08:06] many of you probably familiar with this
[1:08:08] story but he was at home one day reading
[1:08:10] his Bible that's a good place to get
[1:08:11] inspiration by the way she didn't know
[1:08:14] where to go here's a holiday written his
[1:08:17] body's reading the book of Genesis about
[1:08:19] the story of Joseph that I talked about
[1:08:20] a few moments ago and how he was
[1:08:22] rejected about his brother and how he'd
[1:08:24] been in prison and how he become to the
[1:08:26] hand the right hand of Pharaoh and all
[1:08:27] these things and he was just so inspired
[1:08:29] by this type of crime what a great man
[1:08:31] he was and brother Mendel's in his
[1:08:32] prayer closet and he begins to pray a
[1:08:35] little your place to get inspiration and
[1:08:38] while he's there and I listened while
[1:08:40] he's in that closet God because to speak
[1:08:41] to him you're gonna have a son amen
[1:08:45] you're gonna have a son
[1:08:46] and
[1:08:47] names gonna be Joseph uh-huh listen we
[1:08:50] have the benefit of knowing that
[1:08:50] happened a man this man didn't nobody
[1:08:52] know the voice of God he knew that God
[1:08:55] could foretell these things he'd sent
[1:08:57] happen time and time again and while he
[1:08:59] was praying God said you're gonna have a
[1:09:00] son and his name is gonna be Johnson hey
[1:09:04] man well he goes along for a couple
[1:09:06] months assume he's pregnant and they're
[1:09:07] all excited and she is birth to a girl
[1:09:09] well now here come the gainsayers
[1:09:12] calling what they do today
[1:09:13] whoa brother Brad so this could happen
[1:09:15] didn't happen well maybe didn't happen
[1:09:16] yet well you said you're gonna have a
[1:09:21] boy he said a man call him up one day on
[1:09:23] the phone said you said that you're
[1:09:25] gonna have a Joseph did you mean
[1:09:26] Josephine Omar they've done the same
[1:09:30] thing today oh well yes said we're gonna
[1:09:33] have a Joseph yes invincible right but I
[1:09:37] don't see it I see a bunch of be not
[1:09:39] discouraged people go to church they
[1:09:41] never gonna be any better than they are
[1:09:42] now they're never gonna be any more
[1:09:44] messed up than they are now
[1:09:46] y'all can't use them people God can't
[1:09:48] touch them people don't use that message
[1:09:51] are you sure you didn't mean Josephine
[1:09:53] the been said the man eventually died
[1:09:55] actually
[1:09:56] buddy Megan said this he said when he
[1:09:58] said that I said listen he said I was
[1:10:00] gonna have a son because there was gonna
[1:10:02] be Joseph he didn't say this one and I
[1:10:06] find it curious what brother man says he
[1:10:08] says I could have had six more girls
[1:10:10] beside that think about it seven girls
[1:10:14] seven church ages looking for the prom
[1:10:17] God's gonna rock let's ponder wanna look
[1:10:20] at this church age
[1:10:22] look at this ministry look at Luther
[1:10:23] look at Wesley look where they want God
[1:10:25] said he was gonna come for a holy back
[1:10:27] God said he's gonna have a perfect
[1:10:29] Church and I ain't seen it don't matter
[1:10:32] how many girls go by her church changes
[1:10:34] go by God's gonna have a promise son hey
[1:10:41] man it don't matter huh if I have six
[1:10:43] more God said I'm gonna have a son his
[1:10:46] name's gonna be Joseph my
[1:10:49] well time begins to past little bit like
[1:10:52] I said I think it's significant hey
[1:10:54] Manny went to the doctor one day with
[1:10:55] sister median the doctor he told him he
[1:10:57] said the doctor came up said rubber and
[1:10:58] I'm gonna tie those tubes now how I said
[1:11:00] he said don't you do it I said now watch
[1:11:03] what the doctor says well maybe you'll
[1:11:05] get married again trying to help him out

[1:11:17] gonna have a son and his name's gonna be
[1:11:19] Joseph hey man listen you brother brems
[1:11:24] like you look at Abraham actually
[1:11:25] Abraham tried to bring the promise to
[1:11:27] pass without the full inspiration he
[1:11:30] knew is gonna have a child but God said
[1:11:32] no you're gonna have a little Sarah but
[1:11:33] he didn't wait on the inspiration and
[1:11:35] when he did it away and producing
[1:11:36] Ishmael that produces a carnal believer
[1:11:39] they produce a child of bondage is that
[1:11:42] right I'm gonna bring him come on the
[1:11:44] scene preaching about a revival of the
[1:11:46] Pentecostal stock that's this healing
[1:11:48] ministry that's what this is that's the
[1:11:49] impersonation and we see into that

[1:15:43] are you with me they had their own
[1:15:44] expectation instead of the inspiration
[1:15:47] of God they thought it had to come a
[1:15:49] certain kind of away I'm gonna bring it
[1:15:52] down now it's gonna be just so in such a
[1:15:55] way I'm gonna have just such a thing in
[1:15:57] my homework just the right kind of a job
[1:15:59] or the right kind of a pastor deacon I
[1:16:01] want to be just so and so if they don't
[1:16:02] sing the songs I like every service if
[1:16:06] they don't paint the gifts the walls a
[1:16:07] certain color we gotta have it just so
[1:16:11] you see you some ridiculous listen the
[1:16:13] Pharisees the Sadducees they saw the
[1:16:16] word manifest before them and they
[1:16:19] rejected it not because they were
[1:16:21] ignorant but because it didn't come the
[1:16:24] way that they wanted they come through a
[1:16:28] little five-foot what four or five foot
[1:16:30] six looking Jewish man looking maybe 50
[1:16:32] years old the age of 30
[1:16:34] hey man well this is the carpenter song
[1:16:37] from gal from Nazareth can any good
[1:16:40] thing come out of Nazareth then come the
[1:16:43] way they're warned so they begin to say
[1:16:45] I can't be we reject it we reject this
[1:16:49] this this this can't be this Messiah
[1:16:53] see God always comes a different way
[1:16:55] than we expect but I want you to say
[1:16:57] something their problem was not just
[1:16:59] that God come a different way than
[1:17:01] expected because God's done many things
[1:17:02] in my life and I thank God he's done
[1:17:05] many things in my life I didn't expect
[1:17:06] it that way but I think God it happened
[1:17:08] that way can I get a witness a man
[1:17:10] caused amazing love so I don't know how
[1:17:12] girls gonna work that out and he did a
[1:17:14] completely different way than my fly and
[1:17:16] what happened I said praise God that was
[1:17:19] so much better than what I had in mind
[1:17:20] you know what I'm talking about
[1:17:23] listen the problem was not all together
[1:17:25] then it come a different way the problem
[1:17:28] was it come a different way and they
[1:17:29] rejected it they didn't like the way it
[1:17:33] come they said oh no not that way you're
[1:17:37] hard you can have this you can you can
[1:17:39] have the kitchen you can have the living
[1:17:41] room but stay out of my bedroom stay off
[1:17:44] my search history on the computer stay
[1:17:46] out of my personal life you stay on my
[1:17:48] job you sound my relationship with my
[1:17:50] kids you can have everything else but
[1:17:52] stay out of this part oh no you ain't
[1:17:54] coming in here I'll let you have this
[1:17:58] part but this is for me and don't you
[1:18:01] dare try to change the way I want to be
[1:18:02] done well tell you what my pastor is
[1:18:09] preaching hear it on Sunday and he
[1:18:11] started to bring a little correction in
[1:18:13] the church and he said you know you
[1:18:14] gotta be careful he correct people
[1:18:15] because I clam up on you I thought God
[1:18:17] bless my pastor cuz these aren't dating
[1:18:20] to do that and it's such a shame because
[1:18:22] like you said some people you correct
[1:18:24] them once you never see them at church
[1:18:25] again oh they want the word to be
[1:18:28] preached just don't amen what we left
[1:18:32] it's like I was taught my wife that I
[1:18:33] said people love it when your preacher
[1:18:34] gets in here you're preaching in sinners
[1:18:38] alright then Bob had just balls and
[1:18:41] they're learning with their shorts
[1:18:43] on this and that and then you preach my
[1:18:45] their sin and their backbiting in the
[1:18:47] gossip and this is all that pastor ain't
[1:18:50] got no business telling me what do money
[1:18:52] preacher hunt lions oh that man got no
[1:18:54] business coming to my bed now
[1:18:56] well the man's not doing it you just
[1:19:00] don't like the way God's doing it
[1:19:02] come on now somebody I tell you when you
[1:19:05] please message people Oh hallelujah
[1:19:07] where are we is message people get such
[1:19:09] thin skin so we can't be corrected
[1:19:12] anymore well the Bible says is
[1:19:15] profitable for correction listen that's
[1:19:17] not for the world because they won't
[1:19:19] receive it listen there's only one
[1:19:21] people who would even receive correction
[1:19:22] it's got to be us so if it come to say
[1:19:25] God it's from a guy well none of us like
[1:19:29] being corrected you know we talk kids
[1:19:33] this is good we tell our kids you know
[1:19:36] what you better have to sit where we're
[1:19:38] gonna correct you they don't like being
[1:19:40] corrected and then we grow up and we say
[1:19:46] you know what I don't like been
[1:19:47] corrected either differences they got to
[1:19:49] deal with and I don't I'll leave Church
[1:19:50] I won't listen to tapes no more come on
[1:19:53] somebody we we spent so much time
[1:19:55] telling our kids they need to receive
[1:19:57] correction I mean they act a certain way
[1:19:58] and behave a certain way and then we
[1:20:00] grew up and do the things we tell them
[1:20:01] not to do and then we wonder why we're
[1:20:03] not blessed and we wonder why they think
[1:20:04] we're a hypocrite
[1:20:06] well daddy told me I should receive
[1:20:08] correction but he gets up seven anytime
[1:20:10] somebody preaches up and down his aisle
[1:20:12] hey well hallelujah mommy says that we
[1:20:15] should receive correction we should
[1:20:17] soften our hearts but they get like a
[1:20:20] big old pump fish any time you preach my
[1:20:21] lamb listen I'm not here to preach about
[1:20:24] everybody but it's the idea we don't
[1:20:27] receive it because we don't like the way
[1:20:29] it comes that's why they won't receive
[1:20:32] it they wanted a messiah would come and
[1:20:35] pat him on the back it's a good sound
[1:20:37] Pharisees waiting to putting them people
[1:20:40] in order waiting to stick them over your
[1:20:42] thumb under bars that's great it says
[1:20:47] ridiculous with the dead the Bible says
[1:20:49] they had the key knowledge listen the
[1:20:52] people they didn't know what to do but
[1:20:53] these men had the key of knowledge and
[1:20:55] that was they not entering themselves
[1:20:57] they hindered those who
[1:21:01] that's powerfully mana they didn't like
[1:21:05] they didn't like the veil it was behind
[1:21:10] listen sometimes we don't like the veil
[1:21:12] that's sometimes you're the veil that
[1:21:14] you don't even like well there's a tough
[1:21:17] one for you sometimes you say God God
[1:21:20] what are you to do the situation God
[1:21:22] would he send somebody do something

[1:22:11] spirit begin to inspire her go print

[1:22:23] bones I finally said you know what just
[1:22:26] from her a did she wasn't that good

[1:22:54] I can't use me hook I can use listen if
[1:23:01] I can use a donkey here better than the
[1:23:03] donkey

[1:23:12] let's cut down tomorrow if he's feeding
[1:23:15] the swallows that's the nesting mark and
[1:23:18] she was more than many sparrows here
[1:23:21] we're more than a donkey you morning
[1:23:23] you're a child of God listen your song a
[1:23:27] daughter of God this morning God can use
[1:23:30] you to do whatever he wants you feel him
[1:23:33] - his inspiration I'll tell you what
[1:23:37] praise the Lord
[1:23:39] knocking see see it's not just the
[1:23:44] inspiration it's how we receive it and
[1:23:46] you can tell you can tell them you say
[1:23:48] this you can tell what kind of
[1:23:49] inspiration you're under by how you
[1:23:51] receive inspiration see those men were
[1:23:55] inspired those Pharisees were inspired
[1:23:58] by they're inspired on a Hell by their
[1:24:00] daddy the devil they weren't inspired by
[1:24:02] God hey man so you can total kind of
[1:24:05] inspiration your honor listen if you're
[1:24:07] bored of the word you cook with the word
[1:24:09] you don't respond to the word you won't
[1:24:11] reject it because you're under the right
[1:24:13] inspiration you're born of an
[1:24:15] incorruptible seed even the Word of God
[1:24:17] amen so you watch that somebody responds
[1:24:20] the word especially that rubs in the
[1:24:22] wrong way and I'll tell you what kind of
[1:24:24] inspiration there you get some people
[1:24:26] some time I can't say well you know
[1:24:27] preacher I'm I know more about it than
[1:24:29] you do
[1:24:30] I'm a couple yeah well I'm not a
[1:24:34] preacher well you might you might know
[1:24:36] way more about me and that don't even
[1:24:38] mean you're saved you say what you mean
[1:24:42] rather the Bible says you can understand
[1:24:44] all mysteries not even have charity the
[1:24:46] Bible says that knowledge puffeth up but
[1:24:48] love edifies when somebody comes along
[1:24:51] her own idea or their own revelation or
[1:24:54] their own doctrine and it puffs them up
[1:24:57] over the people you know where their
[1:24:59] inspiration come from he say what do you
[1:25:02] mean you look at Moses Amen that speak
[1:25:04] face-to-face with God and the Bible says
[1:25:07] he was the meekest man in the whole
[1:25:08] earth you that I'm messing you're a
[1:25:10] problem this day he was not some great
[1:25:12] man that promoted himself all others he
[1:25:14] says a great man makes you feel great
[1:25:19] so if you're really inspired by God it's
[1:25:21] not gonna cause you to push everyone
[1:25:23] else down there cause you to lift him up
[1:25:25] cuz love edifies but knowledge puffs up
[1:25:28] hey man
[1:25:28] well praise the Lord yet some of these
[1:25:31] people they sit there and they cross
[1:25:32] their arms a preacher you can't tell me
[1:25:35] anything I don't already know you can't
[1:25:37] do anything to help me and you know what
[1:25:39] they're right I can't do anything to
[1:25:42] help them and probably God can't either
[1:25:45] because of their attitude hey man
[1:25:53] God can't even well you don't have any
[1:25:55] business talking like that who's talking
[1:25:57] who's talking man see it's well I'll
[1:26:03] tell you what I was talking something
[1:26:05] about this I said it's quite a
[1:26:06] revelation to me as a young Christian
[1:26:08] when I realized that God can talk to me
[1:26:10] through somebody else besides my
[1:26:12] favorite preacher what a revelation
[1:26:16] y'all could use someone else like my
[1:26:18] Fairbridge he talked to me yeah
[1:26:20] I can use anybody oh yeah you don't have
[1:26:25] to use the preacher you like he's only
[1:26:26] not like hopefully you don't have that
[1:26:29] problem
[1:26:29] not today boy duck here
[1:26:34] the RAM says in my commission he says
[1:26:37] when the angel or moves down it becomes
[1:26:39] an a voice of God to you he says if I
[1:26:42] offended you by saying that forgive me
[1:26:44] but I thought that might that might have
[1:26:45] been resented but I am God's voice you
[1:26:47] notice they resented it here's a man a
[1:26:50] prophet you stand in the pulpit saying
[1:26:51] when this angel comes down with this
[1:26:53] inspiration of God comes oh I'm God's
[1:26:55] voice to you he says now I felt that
[1:26:57] some of you resent that but it's true
[1:26:59] anyhow listen
[1:27:03] William Brandon's the seventh angel
[1:27:04] whether you like it or not you're
[1:27:07] lacking in a reject me it doesn't change
[1:27:09] who he is
[1:27:10] buddy you're mine but he don't change
[1:27:13] who he is in front of God that's God's
[1:27:15] voice to you
[1:27:17] he said that time was under inspiration
[1:27:21] yeah
[1:27:22] [Applause]
[1:27:23] he said that was under inspiration I'm
[1:27:26] God's voice too he said he said I felt
[1:27:29] bad about the first time but it repeated
[1:27:31] it to a medium subsidy I didn't really
[1:27:34] feel bad not saying that within God
[1:27:36] don't say it again tell that spirit that
[1:27:39] resents that it's true anyhow say it
[1:27:42] again and that's my heart through my
[1:27:46] this message when the enemy comes in and
[1:27:48] tells me these thing you know this is
[1:27:50] just a bunch of makeup
[1:27:51] this must work up this is your
[1:27:52] imagination and this is a bunch of
[1:27:54] fanatics and say no am I saying again
[1:27:56] what the Prophet said let's say if the
[1:27:58] Lord
[1:27:59] this message is Christ it come from God
[1:28:01] it's for me I'm not standing here today
[1:28:05] carrying about my dreams I'm not more
[1:28:09] shook up I'm more settled than I've ever
[1:28:12] been when other preachers and other
[1:28:14] Christians they're fallible and they
[1:28:16] don't know so I believe this should I
[1:28:18] believe that little prophets I believe
[1:28:20] it now more today than I ever had in the
[1:28:23] whole line he says this on the platform
[1:28:33] and the Holy Spirit is speaking and he's
[1:28:35] speaking through Maura lips he always
[1:28:36] does that now I believe these are
[1:28:39] ministers behind me says and brethren
[1:28:42] you never preached a sermon in your life
[1:28:45] well I don't know I'm sweating so hard
[1:28:47] you never preach the sermon your life he
[1:28:50] says the Holy Spirit preached through
[1:28:52] you a sermon hey man that's right
[1:28:58] seaweed up preach the Holy Spirit does
[1:29:00] the speaking oh we might write something
[1:29:01] out and read it but that isn't preaching
[1:29:03] preaching is when the inspiration comes
[1:29:05] its preached by inspiration and the Holy
[1:29:08] Spirit gives the out chin he says now we
[1:29:12] can read something and it just doesn't
[1:29:14] matter
[1:29:15] amen we'll have you ever read your Bible
[1:29:18] like a newspaper probably have one I
[1:29:20] didn't read the scripture and maybe
[1:29:23] you've read the same script maybe we're
[1:29:24] at the same chord a hundred title
[1:29:26] brother call me you're just earlier this
[1:29:27] week he said you know I I've written out
[1:29:29] he used to do the messages put him in
[1:29:31] the books he helped do that this brother
[1:29:33] took the tape
[1:29:34] and typed it up put on monkey said I
[1:29:36] typed this quote years ago and didn't
[1:29:39] realize it was there until the other day
[1:29:42] hey mo so good I'm a preach on it I
[1:29:47] typed this out years ago I've heard it
[1:29:50] maybe a dozen time probably more but
[1:29:52] just the other day something struck and
[1:29:56] it stood out to me that's what we need
[1:29:59] not just the readers to memorize it but
[1:30:02] let something take ahold of that and
[1:30:04] preach to us you say I'm not a preacher
[1:30:07] let it live us zooming through us if you
[1:30:10] can't preach the sermon we have a sermon
[1:30:13] I've such an inspiring live in Christ to
[1:30:17] gunk and preach out of your life no
[1:30:22] doubt these men that wrote the Bible you
[1:30:24] think about Isaiah version shot conceive
[1:30:26] he probably scratched his head what in
[1:30:29] the world did I just say oh man I hope
[1:30:31] they don't write that one down
[1:30:32] oh that was God amen oh my we can read
[1:30:38] something that just doesn't matter but
[1:30:39] when the Holy Spirit gets a hold of it
[1:30:41] and takes it out to the people then
[1:30:43] something takes a hold hey man and
[1:30:47] that's the Holy Spirit
[1:30:49] that's not your pastor preaching that's
[1:30:51] the Holy Spirit preaching in your pastor
[1:30:53] out to you giving the message hey man so
[1:30:59] see it's the veil like I said back that
[1:31:02] can be the pastor preaching or that can
[1:31:04] be the Holy Spirit in the pastor
[1:31:05] preaching it all depends on what
[1:31:07] inspiration you're under amen
[1:31:11] well listen I was I've been I was in the
[1:31:14] service one time I've been a lot like
[1:31:16] this but I was in a service one time
[1:31:18] there's a young man I think maybe he's
[1:31:20] just newly married and he was preaching
[1:31:22] and this young man you know this 20 CPU
[1:31:25] I say young I'm not that old myself 36
[1:31:27] but uh this young man is preaching about
[1:31:31] marriage and children raising raising
[1:31:33] children well you know what happens some
[1:31:36] of the old people in church they they
[1:31:38] shut down on him
[1:31:42] candy don't know nothing about what's he
[1:31:44] saying I met you laughs cuz you know I'm
[1:31:47] talking MA oh here we go
[1:31:50] he thinks he's an expert on marriage now
[1:31:51] he's gonna preach to us about marriage
[1:31:53] I'm too married 50 years whatever I've
[1:31:58] been married a hundred years what's he
[1:32:01] gonna tell me a lot it well he ain't
[1:32:03] gonna tell you nothin hey man no more
[1:32:08] than Paul Paulette married law
[1:32:10] what's he preaching marriage in Devon
[1:32:11] for Paul one here now about Paul didn't
[1:32:13] know nothin now I know I know there's
[1:32:17] some young guys there there's got some
[1:32:19] bravado and they think they know I'm not
[1:32:20] talking about that guy I'm not talking I
[1:32:23] got it thinks he knows it all he's some
[1:32:24] young kid I'm talking about we just
[1:32:26] assume some people assume that here oh
[1:32:29] hey God can't speak to me about my
[1:32:31] marriage to that person they don't know
[1:32:34] anything about it maybe that's why
[1:32:36] they're qualified I don't I appreciate
[1:32:42] marriage advice but I'd rather have it
[1:32:43] come from God than one of you and that
[1:32:47] maybe that quote sometimes that
[1:32:49] qualifies him to speak about it cuz he
[1:32:51] don't know if this inspiration comes
[1:32:54] from praise the Lord somebody I love you
[1:32:57] are their hope that's okay say God can't
[1:33:00] speak to me to that person Oh God amen
[1:33:02] and they shut down and listen you say
[1:33:05] that's ridiculous that's what Paul told
[1:33:07] Timothy all right he said Timothy don't
[1:33:10] let any man despise your use you know
[1:33:13] people say here that God can use you too
[1:33:15] hey man it's not just for old fogies
[1:33:18] like me God can use young people God
[1:33:21] could use a Timothy he said Timothy
[1:33:23] don't let man despise your youth now why
[1:33:27] would he say that
[1:33:28] unless somebody was gonna do it listen
[1:33:31] Timothy was called just like Paul he was
[1:33:34] cold as RIT was a son of God he was
[1:33:37] ordained he had a ministry hey man
[1:33:40] while he was saying what the messenger
[1:33:42] said listen we keep hearing preach
[1:33:45] marriage divorce and I'm not gonna do
[1:33:46] that today
[1:33:47] that's your pastors job all right touch
[1:33:49] that with a ten-foot pole
[1:33:51] if I get married something out of
[1:33:53] marriage once a brother man said he
[1:33:54] don't have a business saying that it's
[1:33:56] what the Prophet said it's what the
[1:33:59] messenger said That's not me that's not
[1:34:02] even him
[1:34:03] that's God speaking to you a man
[1:34:06] somebody
[1:34:07] he said don't let men despise you why
[1:34:09] because that's what they do say well
[1:34:12] praise the Lord brother that's a good
[1:34:14] example give you another one hey man
[1:34:15] this happened in the Bible one time in
[1:34:18] the book of Job well I'd say what job's
[1:34:20] still in the ash heap this is time a
[1:34:22] decision brother Rams head
[1:34:24] you know Joe was out there one day he'd
[1:34:26] been smitten and he lost his children
[1:34:28] and all this stuff you know the story
[1:34:30] and here come through his friend from
[1:34:32] church good old buddy so the good old
[1:34:35] boys from church come and then these
[1:34:38] were not young man these were the wise
[1:34:40] these are the a understood something
[1:34:42] about God and they tighten up their
[1:34:43] belts now let's say these men were
[1:34:45] sincere sincere could be they sat there
[1:34:48] with this man for seven days but at the
[1:34:50] end of that begin to speak to John hey
[1:34:52] man a woman gets up and said well job
[1:34:55] you know the reason you're sick is it's
[1:34:58] because there's sin in the camp now
[1:35:01] let's see you could take your quote and
[1:35:02] verify that come on somebody Norma
[1:35:05] there's sin in the camp if you're sick
[1:35:07] and there's a sick person in the church
[1:35:08] there's sense somewhere in the church
[1:35:10] and there's obviously a secret sitting
[1:35:11] in your life job obviously you've sinned
[1:35:14] somewhere and that's why you're like
[1:35:16] this
[1:35:16] now that quotes true and that's a
[1:35:19] possibility
[1:35:20] but that wasn't his case he meant some
[1:35:24] money come on now so no can say well you
[1:35:27] know what brother Brennan's head that's
[1:35:29] the right mental attitude toward any
[1:35:31] promise of God we're working to pass she
[1:35:33] you must just have the wrong attitude
[1:35:36] you must not have faith that's why
[1:35:38] you're sick now listen that quotes true
[1:35:40] and that's right
[1:35:42] but that wasn't his problem are you with
[1:35:46] me never know and you know the
[1:35:48] troubleshooter I like all
[1:35:49] troubleshooting they're trying to shoot
[1:35:52] trouble so they're shooting Joe he come
[1:35:56] up there said well Joel
[1:35:57] Bava says if you can't forgive you can't
[1:36:00] be forgiven so clearly you're in this
[1:36:03] situations as haha here in this
[1:36:05] situation because there's unforgiveness
[1:36:06] in your life joke and if you just
[1:36:08] forgive that person you have a nought
[1:36:10] against God would heal you now it's true
[1:36:13] they don't forgive us can cause you
[1:36:14] trouble is that right that's true that
[1:36:16] scriptures too but that wasn't jokes
[1:36:19] problem see when you take these
[1:36:23] scriptures we can make it support our
[1:36:25] idea amen well so so obviously you know
[1:36:31] because they didn't shake my hand Church
[1:36:32] that's why they got in a car wreck this
[1:36:33] week well so so you know they you know
[1:36:38] they they made fun of me so that's why
[1:36:40] that's what we do say we know all this
[1:36:44] this looks like that and then but the
[1:36:47] problem was they lack the inspiration to
[1:36:50] follow it
[1:36:51] hey man see what we need to know what we
[1:36:54] need this morning is not just more
[1:36:55] learning because we can learn so much
[1:36:57] sometimes till we lean on our own
[1:36:59] understanding and these men begin to
[1:37:03] lean on their own understanding well I
[1:37:05] saw this happen one time so this must be
[1:37:07] it but that wasn't it was it
[1:37:09] my mom we could talk about inspiration
[1:37:11] for hours so this is why it's the
[1:37:13] difference between life and death
[1:37:15] hey man so finally this young guy his
[1:37:19] young guy shows up named Ally her
[1:37:21] brother Brent is a representative of
[1:37:22] Christ he talked about his name breaking
[1:37:24] it down the Hebrew Ally who shows up a
[1:37:27] representative Christ and he's just
[1:37:29] something young kid some young preacher
[1:37:31] you don't know he's talking about I'm
[1:37:33] not puffing myself this isn't a
[1:37:34] promotional pitch this young guy gets up
[1:37:37] here he says you know I waited till
[1:37:40] these old guys were done because wisdom
[1:37:42] should speak in the number of days
[1:37:44] should you have a voice she said oh I
[1:37:46] read to you here he said this the Bible
[1:37:50] says in job 3:2 then was rat kindled the
[1:37:52] wrath of Allah who the son of bark held
[1:37:54] the booze I though of the kinder Ramius
[1:37:56] job in his wrath kit was and against Jo
[1:38:00] was his wrath killed because he just him
[1:38:02] saw justify himself rather than God also
[1:38:04] against his three friends was his wrath
[1:38:06] killed because they had found no answer
[1:38:07] and
[1:38:08] had condemned Joe hey man
[1:38:11] now Allah who had waited till Joe had
[1:38:14] spoken because they were elder than he
[1:38:16] and when Elijah saw that there was no
[1:38:19] answering off these men then his wrath
[1:38:21] was kindled in a line of the son of bark
[1:38:23] held the booze I'd answered and said I
[1:38:25] am young and you are very old I don't
[1:38:28] know if that was a dig or not I'm young
[1:38:31] you're very old ladies mad
[1:38:37] wherefore I was afraid and Durst not
[1:38:41] show you my opinion but there is a
[1:38:43] spirit in man hey man here's the other
[1:38:47] inspiration and the inspiration of the
[1:38:50] almighty giveth them understanding and
[1:38:55] then don't you notice this the reason
[1:38:57] they lacked understanding is because
[1:38:59] they didn't wait for the inspiration
[1:39:00] inspiration gives the understanding here
[1:39:05] they thought German messed up they
[1:39:07] thought job and found and here God is
[1:39:09] bragging on the man the whole time
[1:39:12] and then are you're going through some
[1:39:14] things maybe you're in a situation you
[1:39:17] say why my don't lose them maybe you've
[1:39:19] got some of jobless friends trying to
[1:39:21] give you counsel listen they're trying
[1:39:23] to be helpful they're trying to help out
[1:39:25] but we have to have the inspiration that
[1:39:27] gives us the understanding what to say
[1:39:29] and what not to say
[1:39:34] hey man praise the Lord you believe that
[1:39:38] it's just great man it's pretty good
[1:39:43] right here
[1:39:44] great men are not always wise
[1:39:49] neither do the age understand judgment
[1:39:51] listen it don't matter if you're eight
[1:39:53] years old or 80 you can look up to a man
[1:39:56] see that's the he's the best preacher in
[1:39:58] the message well he'll make a mistake
[1:39:59] somewhere too I've made mistakes I'm not
[1:40:03] that one but I'm saying I've made
[1:40:05] mistakes you make mistakes and then if
[1:40:08] we're not careful we lift up a man hey
[1:40:11] man we're no longer looking at the
[1:40:13] inspiration we're looking at a
[1:40:14] personality or certain way we do things
[1:40:17] and maybe the pastor jerks had a certain
[1:40:19] weight we all jerk our head a certain
[1:40:21] way so brother Ram said that we give
[1:40:24] each other spirits listen even a great
[1:40:27] man is not immune to this it don't
[1:40:30] matter what you've been a Christian for
[1:40:31] five minutes or 50 years you're not
[1:40:33] immune to what job's friends did you're
[1:40:36] not immune to the idea of leaning on
[1:40:37] your understanding even great men are
[1:40:39] not always wise a man think about that
[1:40:44] what we think is great God thinks his
[1:40:46] foolish is that right prophet says this
[1:40:49] an investment 63 he says no man has a
[1:40:53] right to preach the gospel until
[1:40:54] secretly on the back on the backside of
[1:40:57] the desert he stood on the ground with
[1:40:59] him and God alone is there's no
[1:41:03] intellectual being in the world could
[1:41:04] explain it away from you
[1:41:06] no city must be knowing something and
[1:41:08] meeting God once you've met God there's
[1:41:11] no one that can explain that away from
[1:41:13] you and then he says that's right you
[1:41:16] were there you know it happened no
[1:41:20] matter how much they can explain it but
[1:41:22] wait something happened you know it did
[1:41:26] you saw with your eyes you talked to it
[1:41:31] he says and it talked back to you
[1:41:34] hold on somebody listen this is it talk
[1:41:39] back to you see you know it's big and
[1:41:42] you become a part of that listen hey I
[1:41:46] can't speak for all you that's why I'm
[1:41:48] here this morning that's why I preached
[1:41:50] this message and I believe this word of
[1:41:52] God I know what it did for me didn't
[1:41:55] talk about psychology he can talk about
[1:41:57] fanaticism you can sell these things
[1:42:00] I know where I was maybe you heard my
[1:42:04] testimony I think I was here a couple
[1:42:06] times go hey man listen let me say this
[1:42:08] way it amazes me how somebody can send a
[1:42:13] message search for years and they grow
[1:42:14] up and they'll walk out and tell them to
[1:42:16] come even atheists or something like
[1:42:17] that don't even believe that don't exist
[1:42:20] and you know what I say I don't see you
[1:42:22] up there too much I'm gonna have such a
[1:42:26] life before my family and before my
[1:42:29] church but if they decide they don't
[1:42:31] want to serve God and they want to walk
[1:42:33] out god forbid and do whatever they want
[1:42:35] let them never deny there was a God in
[1:42:37] their home hey man say brother man when
[1:42:40] he was tempted his little girl died said
[1:42:41] the devil knew he couldn't tell me God
[1:42:43] didn't exist I'd seen did too much
[1:42:45] already
[1:42:46] listen you can criticize this message
[1:42:49] you can say it's a bunch of nonsense but
[1:42:51] I've seen gone through too much of my
[1:42:52] life to disbelieve now if I were the
[1:42:56] backside that'd be me back saying but I
[1:42:58] know that God is real I know what he's
[1:43:00] done I know he's done for me this
[1:43:02] message is more than doctrine or just a
[1:43:05] bunch of words on tank it's a person of
[1:43:08] Jesus Christ Christ is spoken to me I
[1:43:12] owe my life even naturally I'll owe my
[1:43:14] life literally to this God that spoke to
[1:43:17] me hey man my testimony was hearing in
[1:43:24] my life and then listen what I should
[1:43:26] have passed God come to me how can I
[1:43:39] deny that God is still Savior he's still
[1:43:45] revealer I've been sick of money and let
[1:43:48] me testify God is still a healer I'm not
[1:43:52] just preaching because I read it
[1:43:54] somewhere it's a reality of my

[1:46:07] preacher I said she said I saw a man
[1:46:09] stand by you on the platform I said
[1:46:12] thank God for it I've never seen him do
[1:46:15] that but I believed it because I
[1:46:17] wouldn't be up here if I thought I was

[1:46:29] that's for the believer with the ends of
[1:46:31] the Lord and kept us round the back then
[1:46:34] that fear him and delivers them is that
[1:46:36] right he's going off the deep end he's
[1:46:40] lost his mind
[1:46:41] yeah and I found the mind of Christ it's
[1:46:45] so beautiful and so beautiful and so
[1:46:47] some of you you'll find the mind of
[1:46:49] Christ
[1:46:52] he's not just a God of history man
[1:46:54] praise the Lord listen listen if the
[1:46:56] Queen of Sheba if the Queen of Sheba
[1:46:59] would hear about a gift of wisdom in the
[1:47:03] life of Solomon and she traveled halfway
[1:47:05] around the world to meet this man with
[1:47:08] this gift listen that Old Stone had
[1:47:10] never talked to her the idol she'd
[1:47:12] worshipped her whole life she prayed day
[1:47:14] after day to that stone and it never did
[1:47:16] talk back she had her idols they never
[1:47:19] did speak to her but she found something
[1:47:21] she found something there Jerusalem
[1:47:24] there's a God in that man that speech Oh
[1:47:27] hallelujah listen he said that's a great
[1:47:30] thing and she would travel halfway
[1:47:32] around the world
[1:47:33] don't witness that gift but let me tell
[1:47:36] you this woman there's a greater than
[1:47:38] Solomon the team
[1:47:41] That's not me it's the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:47:48] you didn't have to travel halfway around
[1:47:50] the world this morning you just had to
[1:47:51] get up out of bed and come and prepare
[1:47:54] your heart didn't go to him he come to
[1:47:56] you oh my see I said cuz I want you to
[1:48:05] recognize who's here who's here not what
[1:48:08] we're doing who's here this morning he's
[1:48:10] here the Prophet said my ministry is
[1:48:13] just a little different than a pastor of
[1:48:15] teachers in my ministry is to declare he
[1:48:18] is here now listen if you don't
[1:48:22] recognize his here you'll walk right out
[1:48:23] of the same trouble you had when you
[1:48:25] come in the building here if Moses saw
[1:48:28] that burning hood said you know what I
[1:48:29] got too much going on down here in the
[1:48:31] real world you go up see that pill they
[1:48:33] would have been in the same condition
[1:48:35] that the day after that and the day
[1:48:37] after that listen no get so sidetracked
[1:48:40] that you miss what God's doing there's
[1:48:42] an attraction on the mountain if you go
[1:48:45] up and see this God he'll speak back to
[1:48:47] you my my you say brother you sound like
[1:48:54] you're not brother Alex he's a terrible
[1:48:56] preacher preaches we're out of a paper
[1:48:58] bag
[1:48:58] well that might be true but I'll tell
[1:49:01] you one thing I know in whom I have
[1:49:02] believed and I was not disobedient to
[1:49:05] the heavenly vision and I'm persuaded
[1:49:08] I'm persuaded he's able to keep that but
[1:49:11] I've committed unto Him until that day
[1:49:14] he meant he didn't have to be the most
[1:49:17] eloquent speaker you don't have to be a
[1:49:19] preacher or a deacon you could just be a
[1:49:21] son of God a dollar god there's nothing
[1:49:23] greater than that doesn't this play
[1:49:26] preaches that I am the sons of God I
[1:49:27] don't do them no good
[1:49:29] hey man to be called a son or daughter
[1:49:32] of God to have God living on the inside
[1:49:34] of the end hey man that's what I want
[1:49:39] you to recognize this morning this
[1:49:40] inspiration is no longer just in this
[1:49:42] Bible today but he wrote it in my heart
[1:49:46] I couldn't read here where he told me to
[1:49:48] come and preach here today but he wrote
[1:49:50] something in my heart all them years ago
[1:49:51] they brought me here today he loved me
[1:49:56] when I was unlovable
[1:49:58] he saved me when I was unsinkable and
[1:50:02] tell me that his arm is not like shorter
[1:50:04] than a swatch short they can't save
[1:50:06] anymore
[1:50:07] don't tell me is there's growing heavy
[1:50:09] and then he can't hit anymore I know
[1:50:11] he's the same I praise the Lord
[1:50:16] I turn my back and then when I turned my
[1:50:21] back on his grace his mercy time after
[1:50:24] time after time yet he never took me he
[1:50:30] never forgot about me he said he's
[1:50:33] engraved in the palm of my hands that
[1:50:36] buried blood I shut camera he's written
[1:50:38] into my DNA that blood testifies that's
[1:50:41] one of my children that bloods testified
[1:50:45] for you you're one of his children he
[1:50:47] can't forget you a suckling mother can
[1:50:50] forget her child but God can't forget
[1:50:52] about you

[1:52:42] didn't forget you I've been praying this
[1:52:46] whole time you know it's a great thing
[1:52:49] that we can pray for another but you
[1:52:51] know what Jesus prayed for me before I
[1:52:55] was even born when he was in that garden
[1:52:58] he begin to pray he said I pray not only
[1:53:01] for these but for those that believe on
[1:53:03] Sun Olney through the word that they
[1:53:05] would speak he prayed for me before I
[1:53:10] was a speck of dust that was a thought
[1:53:13] in the mind of God and he took a picture
[1:53:15] of me he saw me sinless he saw me
[1:53:18] roaring to us I didn't know I was the
[1:53:20] son of God in the world I didn't know
[1:53:22] what it meant to be Daniel John I've
[1:53:23] heard an Eagle scream I thought we just
[1:53:26] stop pecking on the ground it ain't a
[1:53:28] bunch of seed but when I saw that eagle
[1:53:30] in the sky screaming his cries and
[1:53:33] inspired me hey maybe I can fly like
[1:53:37] that too
[1:53:38] I would have never thought it was the
[1:53:40] inspiration come my way and I saw son of
[1:53:43] God
[1:53:45] I saw a wave chief lifting up the bumper
[1:53:48] things in there and it inspired me I can
[1:53:51] fly like that eagle I'm not a chicken
[1:53:53] and there was a chicken I didn't know
[1:53:56] what was different about me but I saw
[1:53:58] something today they look like what I
[1:54:00] was looking for and it inspired me to
[1:54:04] rise up a little chicken yard out of the
[1:54:07] Pigpen but I wasn't raised in a
[1:54:13] Christian home I'd seen churches that
[1:54:15] walk by all the churches on my recorder
[1:54:17] but there's nothing there that I could
[1:54:20] respond when this message come flying by
[1:54:22] my way something stirred in my heart and
[1:54:26] begin inspire me this is what the Bible
[1:54:28] talks about it's something begin to stir
[1:54:34] my heart tell you what these gainsayers
[1:54:38] they can come make fun of this and they
[1:54:40] can talk about all they want let them
[1:54:41] produce the life and then maybe I'll
[1:54:44] listen to them show me another life that
[1:54:47] lines up like this show me another
[1:54:49] witness to the Messiah like we've had
[1:54:52] and then maybe I'll even listen to you
[1:54:54] there's nothing like it
[1:54:56] you see come up with the rhythm yeah I'm
[1:54:58] talking about me too and talk about you
[1:55:01] they cannot give me what this Bible
[1:55:04] promised there's no righteousness there
[1:55:07] there's no power over come a
[1:55:09] psychologist their own idea but this
[1:55:11] message listen that eagle flies because
[1:55:18] it's sustained by an invisible power
[1:55:20] he's not flapping his wings and jumping
[1:55:23] so hard there's a power that's lifting
[1:55:26] him up to places he can't go by himself
[1:55:29] that's what I saw Oh hallelujah
[1:55:33] the inspirations in me I pray there's
[1:55:35] somebody here knows I'm talking about
[1:55:36] this morning
[1:55:37] inspired believers take the inspired
[1:55:39] word the band says this well house will
[1:55:44] you build me 1965 he says I appreciate
[1:55:46] men that will follow the leading of
[1:55:48] Christ regardless of the cost that costs
[1:55:51] them though the whole world may be your
[1:55:55] very best friends think that you're
[1:55:56] wrong but is it wrong to you as long as
[1:56:00] you feel there's something behind it
[1:56:02] it's God moving you it's never wrong it
[1:56:05] always pan out right
[1:56:09] hey man it's God moving you know pain
[1:56:14] out right go work out you know that hope
[1:56:18] you're inspired this morning when I say
[1:56:20] that to see yourself as part of it I was
[1:56:22] in a brother there's a brother in
[1:56:24] Defiant for their antique wrestling I've
[1:56:26] known him since I first got saved and
[1:56:28] the first time I went I think was 2000
[1:56:31] 2012 I believe it was I went over to
[1:56:33] Uganda the first time I had meetings
[1:56:34] overseas I come back and I print off a
[1:56:37] report and had some pictures and stuff
[1:56:39] and I don't have time to tell you about
[1:56:41] all the miracles but God was he opens
[1:56:44] blind man's eyes and raised up a lame
[1:56:46] woman and just all these different
[1:56:47] miracles and I had some pictures one of
[1:56:50] the brothers have taken and I shared
[1:56:52] that and you know and he put it up in
[1:56:54] his office now in his office here about
[1:56:57] a year ago and I notice he had put it up
[1:56:58] and I'm reading the story and the
[1:57:00] testimony man that's really good didn't
[1:57:04] realize it's talking about me
[1:57:05] [Laughter]
[1:57:07] amen and then I flip it over and I see
[1:57:10] my picture with the next page like oh oh
[1:57:12] I was there it was really inspiring but
[1:57:16] it was even more inspired when I was it
[1:57:17] was talking about me I said what are you
[1:57:21] getting at brother it's one thing for
[1:57:22] you to say man that's a real good
[1:57:23] thought what a good service but what a
[1:57:26] power thought it's nothing when your
[1:57:27] eyes I'm talking about you I'm talking
[1:57:30] about you I'm not talking about me it's
[1:57:34] human time huh
[1:57:35] when I talk about all these great things
[1:57:37] that God does I'm not talking
[1:57:38] me as a man talk about you as a believer
[1:57:42] that's one thing to see a vision but
[1:57:45] something to see yourself in the vision
[1:57:47] I thought man whoever this walnut golf
[1:57:51] just used them in a mighty way I saw it
[1:57:53] I thought now that can't be no I thought
[1:57:57] that about myself I'm reading the paper
[1:57:59] but that can't be
[1:58:01] see what we do oh I believe that God
[1:58:04] heals the sick just don't nothing can do
[1:58:06] it for me I'll believe it dog him
[1:58:10] deliver just don't know if it can do it
[1:58:12] for me
[1:58:13] oh I've watched people in church get
[1:58:16] blessed I've seen God do mighty things
[1:58:18] in people's life but I don't know if he
[1:58:21] can do it for me
[1:58:23] and that's where we missed our blessing
[1:58:25] hey man listen if I had gotten up here
[1:58:29] this morning as the musicians come let's
[1:58:34] add gotten up here this morning and I
[1:58:38] take my text I'll just read few quotes
[1:58:40] my I talk like this to you oh and I just
[1:58:45] kind of let you for a little bit you
[1:58:46] would have been disappointed amen
[1:58:48] I said no we come to hear inspired
[1:58:50] preaching we want we want to hear the
[1:58:52] message of the hour we want something
[1:58:55] with with some power in it some life in
[1:58:57] it
[1:58:58] maybe you've been to that dead old
[1:59:00] formal thing like that Queen of Sheba
[1:59:02] you don't want to go back said I've seen
[1:59:04] enough of idols I've seen enough I love
[1:59:06] religion
[1:59:07] I don't nothing do with it if I got up
[1:59:09] here and I preached without an
[1:59:10] inspiration this morning you'd have been
[1:59:12] disappointed you two walked out said man
[1:59:13] I hope he never comes back maybe some of
[1:59:16] you feel that way anyway hoping huh
[1:59:18] Judah said I would you would be so
[1:59:20] disappointed if you come here just hurt
[1:59:23] me just talk to you for a while there's
[1:59:26] no inspiration behind it amen you'd have
[1:59:30] been so upset if I just did that just
[1:59:33] come here and just kind of spread stuff
[1:59:35] to you amen because you had an
[1:59:40] expectation
[1:59:41] the inspiration of God would speak you
[1:59:44] say yeah that's good that's fine and
[1:59:45] you're right to do that but what I want
[1:59:47] to ask you is this how many of you were
[1:59:49] inspired this morning you would be
[1:59:51] disappointed if I wasn't but where are
[1:59:54] you at what was the last time you let
[1:59:58] God just deal with you you just laid in
[2:00:01] the presence of God and and let him
[2:00:03] begin to deal with your heart and speak
[2:00:05] to you and give you something you didn't
[2:00:06] just make up in your mind or just give
[2:00:08] you your own opinions a different voice
[2:00:09] hey man where's the Lord somebody was
[2:00:13] last time he just laid in the prends of
[2:00:15] God and he he spoke to you something
[2:00:17] define your own ability defied your own
[2:00:20] reasoning defied your own thinking
[2:00:24] because like I said God's always
[2:00:26] speaking but so many times we get
[2:00:29] discouraged in life God's trying to
[2:00:33] speak to us and we're we're busy trying
[2:00:35] to hold everything together and we're
[2:00:37] trying to fix fix our lives I put all
[2:00:38] the broken pieces back we're trying so
[2:00:42] hard and then maybe you're sick and body
[2:00:46] and you've run over here and you've done
[2:00:48] this and you're seeking an answer and
[2:00:50] you've tried everything you can stop
[2:00:51] trying for a second I start listening to
[2:00:55] God and then maybe you're going through
[2:00:58] the trial of your life and you've prayed
[2:01:01] and you ask people to pray and you've
[2:01:03] studied you ask the pastor you've done
[2:01:05] everything that you can do I want you to
[2:01:08] stop for just a moment amen where you're
[2:01:12] at right now we should stop for a moment
[2:01:15] and say God I want you to speak to me
[2:01:18] I've been so busy looking for the answer
[2:01:21] and you've been trying to give it to me
[2:01:23] this whole time
[2:01:24] [Music]
[2:01:27] and then stop for a moment said God
[2:01:31] speak to me moving me prevail upon me
[2:01:35] take preeminence in my life amen
[2:01:39] president Laura listen this is the time
[2:01:42] there's an altar open this morning it's
[2:01:44] not the time to shoot got a text message
[2:01:46] it's not the time to send them a
[2:01:48] postcard it's time to call conference
[2:01:50] with God and get down Sagada I'm
[2:01:53] clearing my schedule for the date I hear
[2:01:55] from you god I have a need in my life
[2:01:58] I've got something I need to hear from
[2:02:01] you I've studied I've looked at it but I
[2:02:03] need something more I need that
[2:02:05] inspiration and then I don't leave we
[2:02:09] get such a big hurry
[2:02:10] I'm not trying to tell you what to do
[2:02:12] with let's call it conference with God
[2:02:14] let's say God I I need to hear from you
[2:02:17] today if I gotta lay here and there's a
[2:02:20] pile of bones and you come so big and
[2:02:24] I've got to hear from God today
[2:02:25] I'm tired listen if you I'm tired
[2:02:29] maybe you sound I'm tired of living this
[2:02:30] life free of inspiration listen that's
[2:02:34] why we're get in a rut because this
[2:02:37] becomes going to church to us
[2:02:39] this becomes doing our duty just just
[2:02:41] doing whatever Amen we we lose that the
[2:02:44] unction the inspiration behind it we
[2:02:47] need it today it's our lifeline to
[2:02:49] refresh us do you believe that huh
