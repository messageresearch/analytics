[0:00] and this but are you a lamb
[0:07] because a lamb doesn't love to root in
[0:09] dirt and mud
[0:11] notice the dove takes its flight the
[0:13] Holy Spirit leaves and many times you
[0:15] wonder why we can't have the peace that
[0:17] we used to have there's something took
[0:19] the devil away let me tell you something
[0:20] it's not the other person's fault
[0:24] sometimes we live in such a day and age
[0:26] and a civilization that you wonder
[0:28] sometimes are there any grown-ups
[0:30] anymore
[0:31] it's just like the time where Cain well
[0:34] well Lord no you lay so much on me but I
[0:37] can't even bear it ain't so-and-so's
[0:39] fault if peace leaves your life
[0:42] you don't know my co-worker you don't
[0:43] know my wife you don't know my husband
[0:45] it's not their fault
[0:47] it's you've got an access to a source
[0:50] it's your choice whether peace leads you
[0:53] or not
[0:54] you can live in this world and not be of
[0:57] this world do not allow the enemy to
[1:00] sell you short we're either Sons and
[1:02] Daughters of God and we've got a
[1:04] jurisdiction and an authority and we've
[1:07] got an authority over our own mind
[1:10] I've got an authority over my spirit
[1:13] come on Church
[1:16] and even the greatest thing that no man
[1:17] have been able to entertain and that's
[1:20] our big fat mouth
[1:21] our tongues
[1:27] sorry maybe you got a little fat mouth
[1:31] notice this time remember I'm saying no
[1:33] wonder we can't have the type of
[1:35] meetings that we used to have
[1:36] you got to come back to being sheep and
[1:39] the devs sitting on the roost
[1:45] Hallelujah glory to God you know that's
[1:47] why I tell you it all to be such a place
[1:49] that things that oh so and so made me do
[1:52] it oh this made me do it the no nobody
[1:54] made you do anything
[1:56] remember both of them said you cannot
[1:58] say the devil made me do it he said all
[2:00] you're saying is you weren't sealed in
[2:04] because if you're sealed in he can't get
[2:06] to you
[2:08] come on Church
[2:10] but we're living in a day it's easy to
[2:13] blame somebody else so you mean somebody
[2:15] else's spirit is greater than the spirit
[2:17] of God in you that's if you've got the
[2:19] spirit of God
[2:21] hello help me preach now
[2:24] oh brother Samuel that's hard but it'll
[2:27] help us remain useful
[2:29] he's still the Dove and notice said you
[2:31] can't snort and fuss and Grumble and
[2:34] back bite and everything else and expect
[2:35] him to stay there he won't do it because
[2:38] he's not natured that way
[2:42] let me just move on from here
[2:45] in First Peter chapter 3 verse 8 finally
[2:48] be all of One mind that's a challenge
[2:53] now that being all in one mind it
[2:55] doesn't mean that we're all going to be
[2:56] thinking the same way
[2:58] we all have our preferences on worship
[3:00] all have our preferences on Ministry
[3:02] have our preferences on all these other
[3:04] things you know why because the Holy
[3:06] Ghost does not change the preferences or
[3:08] our inclinations he only sits down in
[3:11] the middle of it
[3:12] are you hearing me but what does this
[3:14] mean to be of one of mine does that mean
[3:16] that brother Bill and I have got to
[3:18] think exactly alike that is not what
[3:20] it's saying it is saying the same thing
[3:23] it did in Acts 2 before the holy ghost
[3:26] ever came they were in one mind and one
[3:30] Accord and you know what that brace
[3:32] means one mind one Accord there in the
[3:35] book of Acts it means a variety of
[3:37] different notes that have surrendered
[3:39] their notation into that of a music
[3:42] sheet in order to make a harmonious flaw
[3:46] if I got up here and started planking
[3:48] the same note on the piano you say get
[3:50] down man there ain't no song being
[3:52] played there
[3:53] you sound worse than a preschooler up
[3:55] there trying to plan something out you
[3:57] want something that's got notes highs
[4:00] and lows it's a Melody is that right
[4:02] that's how it is in a body so notice in
[4:05] order for God to move to be of one mind
[4:08] now what does that mean I've gotten my
[4:10] Little Goat my note might be a sixteenth
[4:13] you might be an eighth yours might be a
[4:15] hole yours might be a quarter but let's
[4:17] surrender it it's already a part of the
[4:21] music sheet of God I don't want to take
[4:23] it back I don't want to take it back
[4:26] under my own rights I want to surrender
[4:28] it
[4:30] bet this Symphony
[4:32] can go on
[4:36] having compassion one of Another Love
[4:40] as Brethren be pitiful be courteous
[4:43] not rendering evil for evil or railing
[4:46] for raring railing but contrast blessing
[4:50] in other words evil comes we come right
[4:53] back with evil
[4:56] how can I do you on that one
[5:00] you're gonna post it on me like that
[5:01] I'll show you
[5:03] I put a post on you
[5:06] and we ain't talking about basketball
[5:07] either
[5:09] oh yeah because it's got to a place it
[5:11] in face to face anymore it's just
[5:13] somebody has a disagreement they just
[5:14] make their laundry known on Facebook and
[5:16] Instagram
[5:18] I'm gonna tell you what you need to do
[5:20] with that dirty laundry because sooner
[5:22] or later if you don't get that dirty
[5:23] laundry cleaned and get whatever it is
[5:26] that's causing you to be a continual
[5:28] dispenser of dirty laundry if you don't
[5:30] get that cleaned out it will stand
[5:32] against you at the day of judgment
[5:36] because the Bible says my Bible says
[5:39] blessed are the peacemakers for they
[5:42] shall be called the child of God
[5:47] my mama knowing that ye are there unto
[5:50] called that you should inherit a
[5:53] blessing now notice how Peter is giving
[5:55] this to the individual that this is an
[5:57] entrustment in our lives that we would
[6:00] make sure that the inner man is clear
[6:03] nothing is built up because you know
[6:05] what build up equals build up equals
[6:07] blow up
[6:08] like a pressure cooker you know that's
[6:11] one thing that scared me about pressure
[6:12] cookers you know we didn't we didn't
[6:13] have it for a while we did have a
[6:14] pressure cooker we never used it we had
[6:16] a pressure cooker I thought my wife and
[6:17] I well you know we had a pressure cooker
[6:19] but finally when the instant pot came
[6:20] along and we got the instant pot well
[6:22] that's a pressure cooker I guess it's a
[6:23] little bit more safe than the other ones
[6:25] because I heard all kinds of stories
[6:26] about pressure cookers and them things
[6:27] just blowing up and potatoes going
[6:29] everywhere and all I thought Lord I
[6:31] don't want nothing like that going off
[6:35] so you know what I I will fix potato
[6:37] some other way it might be really good
[6:39] in the pressure cooker you fix them I'll
[6:41] eat them but I didn't want that thing
[6:43] blowing up I know it tenderizes meat
[6:44] real good but we'll just stick with the
[6:46] instant pot right now but how many knows
[6:48] that there is a little valve on that
[6:50] pressure cooker that all of a sudden
[6:52] when it says instapot it might take 10
[6:55] minutes to cook your meal but it takes a
[6:57] whole lot of time to build up the
[6:59] pressure for a little bit of time of
[7:01] cooking and then you've got to wait for
[7:03] that
[7:06] sometimes when I ask my wife honey is it
[7:09] almost ready because by that time it's
[7:11] been hours since I've eaten you know and
[7:13] there's some of that angry strip coming
[7:15] up in there is it almost ready and you
[7:17] know she says just hold pot papa bear
[7:19] and all of a sudden all you hear is
[7:23] it seems like that
[7:26] goes on and on and on oh friends we have
[7:30] a release valve in Jesus Christ
[7:34] it's not just for a moment or two but we
[7:38] can release the pressure in him so we
[7:41] don't blow up on everybody else
[7:44] [Applause]
[7:49] for he that will love life how many of
[7:52] you love life
[7:53] I do
[7:55] I do and see good days how many like
[7:58] seeing good days
[7:59] I mean I love the beautiful weather
[8:00] we've just had the past few days at
[8:02] sunshine and things like that but I'm
[8:04] just talking about more than just
[8:05] beautiful days I'm talking about good
[8:07] days
[8:11] now here's the secret to it let him
[8:15] refrain his tongue
[8:17] from evil
[8:19] and his lips
[8:21] that they speak no guile
[8:26] once again how many we love life love
[8:28] good days this is the recipe right here
[8:35] let him verse 11 is skew evil that that
[8:40] word Askew means to depart from it it
[8:42] doesn't necessarily mean that you turn
[8:44] and walk the opposite way but evil
[8:46] itself can be coming towards you being
[8:47] projected towards you but don't turn
[8:49] around and project the same thing back
[8:52] let them depart from Evil rescue it and
[8:55] do good let him
[8:57] seek peace
[9:00] and ensue it
[9:03] I love peace
[9:06] I love peace as a husband I love peace
[9:08] as a father I love peace in my home
[9:13] I tell you it bothers me I know it
[9:16] bothers my wife too that if we've had
[9:18] some
[9:20] intense discussion
[9:23] I don't like that to stay there
[9:27] I don't like that I'm not telling you
[9:28] that to build my I just don't like it
[9:30] you know why because I know one thing
[9:32] for sure no matter what it is it's
[9:35] displeasing to the Lord and he he gave
[9:38] me that home I want him to be in that
[9:40] home because without him it nothing else
[9:44] matters
[9:49] so that's why I always apologize first
[9:52] I'm just tease
[9:57] how's that for humility
[10:02] but I don't
[10:05] I like pieces of pasture
[10:07] I love peace
[10:10] why Amber the same you love peace well
[10:11] you can say well that's in your makeup
[10:13] to be peaceful but there's something
[10:15] deep deeper than my makeup
[10:18] it's the peace of God in my life that's
[10:21] what it is in your life
[10:23] we love peace as a Christian you love
[10:25] peace even at times in order to have
[10:28] peace it means sometimes not even saying
[10:31] something that you might know something
[10:33] about
[10:36] why I'm pursuing peace
[10:44] and I go just a little bit further
[10:48] watch out brother Branham he picks this
[10:49] up and he's in this quote he's talking
[10:51] about this real Display of Power
[10:54] talking about how they put a rag these
[10:56] what I just read to you in First Peter
[10:58] they're how they put the rag on his head
[11:01] beat him tell us who hit you
[11:03] tell us who hit you if you're the Son of
[11:05] God pulling
[11:07] hairs from his beard
[11:10] spitting on him
[11:12] on him and yet he opened not his mouth
[11:14] and reviled back
[11:18] now that may not be them pulling your
[11:20] beard hair because you may not have
[11:21] beard hair or you may not have hair like
[11:23] me
[11:24] but sometimes it's pulling our chains
[11:27] pulling on the buttons or pushing them
[11:30] come on now
[11:34] if those buttons didn't work we would
[11:35] doubt whether the remote worked or not
[11:36] in our life
[11:40] but think of this
[11:42] watch how brother Brown puts this out
[11:44] what was it
[11:46] a paragraph there from from that time
[11:49] how could Satan
[11:51] sit that man be God in the message from
[11:54] that time
[11:55] a man that could take the challenge of a
[11:58] priest
[11:59] I don't know who's back there
[12:02] run it for me please
[12:04] a man that could take the challenge of a
[12:06] priest and let a drunken Soldier spit in
[12:09] his face
[12:10] today we got the wrong conception of
[12:13] power
[12:14] power is overcoming
[12:17] returning good for evil that's real
[12:21] power
[12:23] now he didn't talk about real powders
[12:26] real power
[12:27] because we're all sometimes maybe more
[12:29] of us some of us are better powders
[12:31] enough if things go our way
[12:33] everybody knows and if it's not
[12:35] everybody knows it
[12:38] it's silent treatment
[12:45] how's it doing it's okay
[12:58] this is real power
[13:01] every one of us will sign up for the
[13:03] power of when I lay my hands on them and
[13:05] I prayed for them oh brother Samuel What
[13:07] miracles but what a miracle to be
[13:09] overcome our own will
[13:13] to bring this man in subjection
[13:17] when evil
[13:22] evil are you hearing me
[13:25] that you can love your enemy do good to
[13:29] those that do evil to you that's real
[13:32] power that's God power
[13:35] how many want God's power that's what I
[13:38] want God power
[13:40] Maniacs can break chains
[13:42] but it takes a real man to return good
[13:46] for evil from his heart
[13:49] not I love you
[13:54] here have this
[13:57] thank you
[14:02] Maniacs can break chains we don't want
[14:04] that kind of power
[14:06] we don't want that kind of power
[14:08] but it takes a real man to return good
[14:11] for evil from his heart not because of a
[14:14] religious duty but from his heart
[14:21] I mean he knows the love of God displays
[14:23] convicting power
[14:26] can I have just five more minutes
[14:29] okay
[14:30] go ahead you can time me on it
[14:34] Paul refers to the
[14:35] scriptures in the Book of Romans
[14:36] read them out of proverbs
[14:39] Proverbs 25 21 if thine enemy
[14:43] you know their name be hungry
[14:46] give them bread to eat
[14:49] not the stale moldy thrown out bread not
[14:53] the bread that you wouldn't well I'll
[14:55] give this to the dogs no give them the
[14:56] bread that you would give
[15:01] them bread to eat and if he'd be thirsty
[15:04] give him water to drink
[15:08] for Thou shalt he calls a fire upon his
[15:12] head now this this whole phrase is not
[15:15] being vindictive I'm going to give you
[15:17] bread and I'm going to burn you up
[15:21] I'm gonna roast you here you want some
[15:25] water
[15:28] you want some bread
[15:31] pick it
[15:33] and by doing so you'll keep coals of
[15:35] fire on their head of
[15:37] eat it
[15:39] drink it and enjoy it
[15:43] no
[15:47] you know what I'm saying is the truth
[15:48] you know what I'm saying is the truth
[15:50] here
[15:51] that's why all that nervous laughter is
[15:53] going on
[15:54] for Thou shalt eat coals of fire upon
[15:57] his head and oh I love this part and the
[16:00] Lord
[16:01] ciao reward be
[16:07] who gets rewarded they receive
[16:10] nourishment strength you know why
[16:12] they're making the noise they're making
[16:14] because they're hungry
[16:16] brother Branham said the person who
[16:18] makes the most noise means they're a
[16:21] sick person and they need to be attended
[16:23] to by the doctor and what they need is a
[16:26] good attention with the Holy Ghost
[16:29] so what should I do live so that the
[16:32] Holy Spirit can be there for their lives
[16:35] that they can say that's what I want
[16:40] and the Lord shall reward thee oh my my
[16:43] my my my my
[16:45] notice
[16:47] I I told you five minutes I've only been
[16:49] two minutes here I can tell
[16:53] so Mr Patsy you didn't have your timer
[16:55] going anyhow
[16:57] notice this
[16:58] remember what Paul said at the end here
[17:01] in Romans 12 21
[17:02] Paul referred to those scriptures out of
[17:05] proverbs
[17:06] he said be not overcome of evil
[17:09] but overcome evil
[17:11] with good
[17:13] foreign
[17:17] I refer to this one here and I am going
[17:20] to close
[17:23] how many remember the
[17:25] the infidel
[17:27] the brother Branham led to the Lord
[17:30] remember up there with the apple tree
[17:32] and
[17:33] he remembered that remember that story
[17:38] I got to listen this and I've listened
[17:40] to this throughout the times of years
[17:42] and I'd Ponder on it you know and I just
[17:43] never went back and picked it up but I
[17:45] thought
[17:46] he I think he's talking about that
[17:49] that particular
[17:51] wife of that man that he had led to the
[17:54] Lord and he was
[17:56] but the brand will tell it in two
[17:58] different couple different places but
[18:00] he talks about how he went back up there
[18:01] squirrel hunting because remember you've
[18:02] been given permission to go up there and
[18:04] squirrel hunt
[18:05] and so brother Brandon went up there and
[18:07] he's coming back to the car after
[18:09] hunting
[18:10] him and maybe brother Woods was with him
[18:13] that time he didn't he didn't say here
[18:14] but she comes out on the porch
[18:19] and she just starts in on brother
[18:22] Branham
[18:23] reverse
[18:26] she is just like you young people
[18:29] think you can walk all over us older
[18:31] people think you can do this I know what
[18:33] you was going to do you drive through
[18:35] this property you tear it up and brother
[18:37] Brandon he's dramatizing it in that way
[18:39] she's going through that way and she's
[18:40] going and brother Brahm is standing
[18:42] there and he's dramatizing he's telling
[18:43] I said
[18:44] ma'am sisters that I no he said that's
[18:46] not something we came to he said but if
[18:48] you look over there he says if I drive
[18:50] through that area you're telling me to
[18:51] drive through our car is going to get
[18:54] stuck
[18:55] we can't make it through that field but
[18:57] remember said she just kept on going on
[18:58] kept on going on kept brother Graham
[19:01] says he began to talk to her
[19:04] she kept on you know with this and
[19:06] saying these things and going in you
[19:08] know she was troubled I mean you know
[19:10] look she was an older person she was
[19:13] also troubled and everything but look
[19:15] how she had jumped to that conclusion
[19:20] all just jumping and we're going to fire
[19:22] away right now
[19:25] but once
[19:28] his brother Brian started talking to her
[19:30] and she realized she said my husband
[19:33] he said yes sister he said I got
[19:36] permission he said we have permission
[19:38] from your husband he said is he still
[19:40] living He said all of a sudden her lips
[19:42] started quivering
[19:43] she said oh you're not brother Branham
[19:46] are you
[19:47] and she said brother Brandon she said I
[19:49] want you to know
[19:51] he died singing the Praises of God
[19:54] he went on home to be with the Lord and
[19:56] this is what she said if I can read this
[19:59] and why people are so tossed about she
[20:01] said forgive me her lips started
[20:04] quivering she started crying she said
[20:06] I'm a backslidden Methodist I'm ashamed
[20:09] of the way I acted the way I did
[20:13] and I said God bless you Sister
[20:15] go back to church won't you serve the
[20:18] Lord Jesus now watch this counsel
[20:20] brother Ram said see if you had jumped
[20:23] out there and started fussing at her
[20:26] telling her you did have a right and so
[20:28] forth you see what you'd have done
[20:31] but just a few words of love
[20:33] goes on down
[20:35] to the heart
[20:41] I don't want to be a fuss bucket
[20:45] who was saying I got rights now remember
[20:47] remember brother Brandon knew he had
[20:48] rights he had that signed right but what
[20:51] was he doing not rendering evil he did
[20:54] not enter in Under The Same Spirit
[20:58] that he was being attacked
[21:00] but he stayed
[21:03] veiled
[21:04] in the presence of God let me just say
[21:06] this that's not only for the prophet
[21:08] that's for you and I brother Brandon
[21:11] didn't that was not told for you and
[21:12] either we would say oh brother Branham
[21:14] no God was letting you and I see this is
[21:17] what a Son of God was able to do you're
[21:19] a Son of God you're a daughter of God
[21:21] you have the same god-given Authority
[21:24] and ability
[21:26] aren't you grateful for that to know I
[21:29] say Lord I want I want to surrender to
[21:31] that inward man I want to surrender to
[21:33] that inward man yes rights but I don't
[21:36] want my rights because my rights if I
[21:39] will go after my rights it'll grieve you
[21:42] away
[21:44] from me
[21:46] so help me in the midst of this time
[21:49] help me Lord help me to stay here in the
[21:51] midst of this time
[21:54] Samuel this didn't have to happen or
[21:55] that didn't I know that
[21:57] I spent countless times sometimes even
[21:59] with those that I got in my classroom if
[22:01] this would have only been sorted out the
[22:03] right way I wouldn't have got them
[22:06] but God knows I needed some of them
[22:12] and you heard me tell the story
[22:15] years ago I don't know 18 years ago or
[22:18] whatever and the Holy Spirit I begin to
[22:20] pray about it sitting there and you
[22:21] would think a little little person could
[22:23] hide
[22:23] I loved I love those kids so you know
[22:26] you you love doing things you love
[22:28] teaching them you love seeing them grow
[22:29] you love but then things that are coming
[22:31] at you and coming desk and cursing at
[22:33] you and things that are coming your way
[22:35] and I looked at it and you know what I
[22:37] had become bitter
[22:40] and the Holy Spirit I never forget it
[22:42] Monday morning getting ready to go back
[22:44] after Thanksgiving break
[22:45] he said you better release that
[22:47] bitterness out of your life
[22:49] it'll affect everybody
[22:52] now one that had become so grown and
[22:55] mounted up but I'm thankful to God that
[22:57] it was able to be identified what it was
[23:00] because think about it not only would it
[23:02] affect in my marriage it affected my
[23:03] home it affected the church
[23:05] it affected everybody around me I don't
[23:08] want that
[23:09] God help me I've got to place you and
[23:11] I've got a place where we can go to
[23:13] there is a fountain open
[23:15] in the House of David
[23:19] Glory there's a place open that we can
[23:22] go we can bathe we can clean we can let
[23:25] off the pressure in him and say Lord you
[23:29] understand
[23:34] let me close here
[23:39] prayer God help me help us Lord help me
[23:43] help every one of us
[23:45] help me Lord to move into that place
[23:48] help me Lord to operate to live in that
[23:50] place you know brother Randy he talks
[23:52] about many other places I've got to go
[23:53] into but one of the things that
[23:55] continues to come over and over and over
[23:58] is standing in prayer
[24:00] and I think our brother ran them two
[24:01] different places that I have founded
[24:03] here within the message familiar quotes
[24:06] to as many of us we've referred to when
[24:08] brother Brown talks about when something
[24:10] has happened somebody's done you wrong
[24:11] somebody's done the evil or something
[24:13] brother Brian says when you can take
[24:15] them to the throne of God and stand
[24:17] shoulder to shoulder with them
[24:21] before the presence of God not face to
[24:24] face no but shoulder to shoulder
[24:28] this is my brother oh my brother Samuel
[24:31] they don't deserve to be brought in the
[24:33] prince of God you are I
[24:36] have not deserved to be brought into
[24:38] Prince of God
[24:40] but here to be useful
[24:42] a useful moment
[24:45] to live
[24:47] for somebody else
[24:50] that's the kind of life I want to live
[24:53] or it may not be we may not walk on
[24:55] Waters we may not you know may never
[24:57] speak in tongues or you may never do
[24:59] this but you know what I want to be a
[25:01] useful life
[25:02] because when it's all said and done I
[25:05] want to know that my life has been
[25:07] useful has been helpful along the way
[25:10] helpful in a manner maybe it's keeping
[25:13] something to myself
[25:15] maybe it's overlooking it's going Beyond
[25:18] something I want to be a useful life God
[25:22] knows
[25:23] that we need him
[25:25] you love him tonight
[25:27] God bless you tonight
[25:29] may he help us that's my prayer may he
[25:32] help us this is a tall task but I'm
[25:35] grateful there is one in US
[25:38] greater is he that is in US
[25:41] it's a tall task but greater is he
[25:43] that's within us remember if I could
[25:45] just give my hand if this is the way
[25:47] he's directing me if I'll just lean into
[25:49] him he'll guide me in that's overcoming
[25:54] now that might not be the overcoming
[25:56] that you ever give up and give a
[25:57] testimony about you know brother William
[25:59] I'm going to give a testimony to the
[26:01] glory of God I had some bad thoughts
[26:03] about you but to the rest of the church
[26:05] I want to say God gave me those Grace to
[26:08] overcome those thoughts against you no
[26:10] those are not the kind of things that we
[26:12] will do you see so much of the
[26:14] overcoming that goes on in our life will
[26:17] never ever testify about it
[26:22] but it's just as glorious
[26:25] because it makes a way for those things
[26:27] that God wants to be testified of
[26:31] amen let's pray
[26:34] Heavenly Father
[26:37] Lord how we thank you for your mercy
[26:39] Lord tonight
[26:42] I thank you Lord for helping us here
[26:45] Lord and looking over some of these
[26:47] things Lord
[26:49] your God even as you begin to direct me
[26:52] Lord some time ago and not knowing Lord
[26:55] when we would enter into this of a
[26:56] useful life if this would be a certain
[26:58] Avenue but Lord as I think of it knowing
[27:01] that in our lives there is a battle that
[27:04] is Raging a battle that is on
[27:07] and Lord I believe I'm talking to
[27:09] Children Of God tonight as myself that
[27:12] want to remain
[27:13] useful
[27:15] not for our Glory
[27:17] but Lord as long as I'm here upon this
[27:20] Earth
[27:21] I don't want to go off in a corner
[27:24] I don't want to go off and get in the
[27:26] toolbox and say I ain't letting nobody
[27:28] put their hands on me again
[27:30] I don't want Lord I Want To Live every
[27:33] moment
[27:35] for your glory Lord
[27:38] to think of it clear up to the last
[27:40] moments on the cross
[27:43] there was a usefulness
[27:47] when there were two mouth actors
[27:51] and one was their mocking
[27:54] and the other turned and said Lord
[27:59] remember me
[28:01] when you come in
[28:04] to your glory to Paradise
[28:07] remember me remember me
[28:10] and that life that would remain useful
[28:13] Lord
[28:14] even while all of the accusations was
[28:18] still going on well you were nailed to
[28:21] the cross
[28:24] Thou shalt be with me this day in
[28:28] paradise
[28:30] even to the last moment Lord
[28:34] that's the kind of lives Lord that we
[28:36] want to live we don't know our last
[28:38] moments we don't know the longevity of
[28:41] our life
[28:42] but now we are here
[28:45] we believe there's a purpose that we're
[28:47] to serve For Your Glory
[28:49] and we want to remain
[28:51] useful Lord
[28:54] would you help us every one of us I Lord
[28:57] I've got my hands up my heart up the
[28:59] Lord
[29:00] help us Lord Satan with love to Lord
[29:03] pack things in and bring in encroachment
[29:05] in our life
[29:07] Lord God like plaque would build up on
[29:10] the Lord the inner walls the lord of the
[29:12] arteries leading to the Heart Lord so
[29:15] Lord God With the Enemy Lord love to
[29:17] cause build up to come in our life Lord
[29:19] build up and build up and build up to
[29:22] where we're no longer able Lord God to
[29:25] handle the flow
[29:27] to know he no longer able Lord God to be
[29:31] a real useful
[29:32] Channel
[29:35] Lord
[29:36] our usefulness is not that we have to
[29:39] stand in front not that we even have to
[29:42] be noticed
[29:43] but to what you have ordained us for
[29:47] sometimes the Lord
[29:49] maybe you've ordained our life
[29:52] to witness to one person
[29:55] maybe our life has been for that person
[29:58] on the job
[30:00] may be Lord for a spouse
[30:03] maybe for a loved one
[30:06] we don't know
[30:08] because you don't base things upon
[30:10] numbers as though that everybody's got
[30:11] to have so many we're all gifted
[30:15] differently
[30:16] Lord even sitting right here in this
[30:18] assembly there's my brothers and sisters
[30:20] and I thank you for the gifts there are
[30:23] Lord God so many in this assembly that
[30:25] Lord God there's so many people that
[30:27] lives just like such a it's such a
[30:29] natural thing for them just flowing and
[30:31] witnessing the Lord
[30:33] I thank you for that Lord
[30:35] we have oh Lord God I'm so thankful for
[30:37] everyone in the body of Jesus Christ
[30:40] every part every part is so necessary it
[30:46] is just as essential Lord as the next
[30:49] part
[30:49] help us Lord I pray
[30:52] we want to remain useful
[30:55] help us Lord that when we're in the
[30:58] midst of a battle help us that Lord God
[31:00] may we lord Jesus
[31:02] go
[31:04] to that Fountain of Life Lord
[31:06] that place as it were where we can bathe
[31:09] Lord God lack of a purification Lord God
[31:12] where we can Lord God allow the washing
[31:15] of Water by the word Lord to cleanse us
[31:17] the Lord
[31:19] there's sometimes Lord things that we
[31:21] pick up that we do not mean to pick up
[31:23] things that we hear we do not mean to
[31:25] hear Lord and Lord how we need that
[31:28] washing of Water by the word we're
[31:30] thankful God that there is that place of
[31:32] water lord Jesus where there is a
[31:35] running water lord God like you had
[31:37] Moses to place there in the Tabernacle
[31:39] Lord where it would be they could turn
[31:41] that spigot Lord there underneath that
[31:44] Lutron Lord and that water would come
[31:45] out and they could wash their hands they
[31:47] could wash their feet so they could be
[31:49] able to worship Lord we are so thankful
[31:52] tonight Lord that there is a place we
[31:54] can go
[31:56] and Lord as I read how your Prophet will
[31:58] tell us Lord he will speak of many of
[32:01] these things and I can see Lord God that
[32:03] even in his life he is instructing us
[32:05] and speaking to us by experience in his
[32:09] life Lord so much to where there are
[32:11] things that he would even make a
[32:12] statement Lord in the beginning of super
[32:15] sense and said if you don't feel that
[32:17] way that you ought to just stay a little
[32:19] bit longer in prayer until that
[32:22] cleansing and that sweetening till you
[32:24] get the feeling the way you're ought to
[32:25] feel oh God I'm grateful there's a place
[32:28] Lord God that father where we lord God
[32:31] can bathe Lord Jesus to where father
[32:34] that all of those things of life that
[32:37] would like to stick and cling but I'm
[32:40] grateful
[32:42] I'm grateful that there is no Gall in
[32:44] the Dove
[32:46] the dove does not have the ability to
[32:49] digest the world
[32:51] but there is an oil inside of that dove
[32:54] that that Dove can put that oil out
[32:57] and Lord it'll go over her wings
[33:00] his wings it'll go over and what does it
[33:03] do it cleans
[33:05] all the stuff that's got into the
[33:07] feathers
[33:08] help us Lord
[33:10] May Lord the Holy Spirit
[33:13] as we would just yield of ourselves
[33:15] right now yield every thought could you
[33:17] just say Lord God help me right now I
[33:19] want to just make a journey right in to
[33:22] the inward Throne Room Lord oh God that
[33:24] that oil of God would just move forth
[33:27] Lord through my life Lord God as a
[33:29] cleansing Lord to wash away Lord as that
[33:32] oil would move all of the debris out of
[33:34] my feathers all of those rights all of
[33:36] those thoughts all of those feelings God
[33:38] let the oil of God
[33:41] overflow Lord Jesus
[33:43] granted Lord we pray
[33:46] in the name of Jesus Christ

[36:01] smile oh fill my way every day with love
[36:10] I don't know if you've ever heard this
[36:12] or not but brother Billy Paul was asked
[36:14] you know brother Billy Paul brother
[36:15] Brown's son oldest son he was asked a
[36:18] question what was it in seeing meeting
[36:21] and seeing healing after healing and
[36:22] seeing the things not just on the
[36:24] platform but you know sometimes in the
[36:26] home what was it what was it that was so
[36:28] amazing what was the most amazing thing
[36:30] you'd saw
[36:31] and this is Brother Billy Paul's
[36:32] testimony
[36:33] he said you know he said I saw a lot of
[36:35] things he said but to me what was the
[36:38] most amazing thing is
[36:40] is how I watched brother Branham
[36:42] in how he treated his friends and his
[36:45] enemies he said because he didn't treat
[36:47] them any different
[36:50] he said the way he treated people you'd
[36:52] have never known who his enemy was
[36:54] and who his friend was
[36:57] now I've Got Confidence in this right
[36:58] here I don't believe that God put that
[37:00] out there for us to say guess what you
[37:03] can have no
[37:05] I've Got Confidence
[37:07] that the same Holy Ghost and what it did
[37:11] and what it produced through that life
[37:14] that was a wheat that came to maturity
[37:17] there's more in the field
[37:21] remember whatever has been don't don't
[37:23] look back well oh brother Samuel I'm
[37:25] already struck off the barrel right
[37:26] there no begin fresh right here tonight
[37:30] you can't do nothing about the past the
[37:32] devil would love to trap you in the past
[37:34] but what about right here tonight where
[37:36] the grace of God has come to you and I
[37:38] to recognize that that's a Godly thing
[37:41] it's not godly to mistreat somebody or
[37:44] if they do something wrong to you I'm
[37:46] going to let them know that they did
[37:48] something that's not godly
[37:50] but it's Godly to forgive
[37:53] I think of one philosopher said it this
[37:55] way I know it seen a message uh you know
[37:57] a message preacher I know it's in a
[37:58] quote but it's a good statement here
[38:00] about forgiveness to air is human to
[38:03] forgive is divine
[38:05] I like that statement I like that
[38:07] statement to air is human but to forgive
[38:10] is divine
[38:11] I want to be divine don't you
[38:13] amen now here here's here's the whole
[38:16] secret keep me close to the side of my
[38:22] savior and God let me never
