[26:34] god bless you church
[26:36] good morning we just uh just real quick
[26:38] gonna take a couple minutes as you can
[26:40] see the project phase one is uh complete
[26:44] um so brooks concrete from lorraine
[26:47] finished that all the walkway and phase
[26:49] two will begin here shortly all the wood
[26:52] that you see up
[26:53] is uh
[26:55] gonna be
[26:56] rod iron railings
[26:58] and then where the wood steps are right
[27:00] now will be concrete steps
[27:02] and then once those are completed we'll
[27:04] have the metal
[27:05] roof extension
[27:08] over the front porch and the ramp so
[27:10] this is an example of the railings
[27:13] now we can't install these
[27:15] until two weeks that's just the way that
[27:18] brooks told us the concrete has to occur
[27:20] cure and harden
[27:22] so the wood's going to be up for quite a
[27:24] while
[27:25] but just know that it won't look like
[27:27] that forever
[27:29] and then last offering on 612 we
[27:32] received
[27:33] eight hundred ninety seven dollars and
[27:34] fifty seven cents so that put us a total
[27:36] of fifteen thousand
[27:38] a dollar and fifty seven cents so let's
[27:41] [Applause]
[27:46] so phase one has been paid for we have a
[27:48] leftover balance of
[27:50] 201.57 cents
[27:53] for the railings in which i have uh
[27:56] the two steps that will go on both sides
[27:59] and that also be brother samuel's back
[28:01] step and then the step
[28:03] right here out this exit and then this
[28:05] exit
[28:06] all for seven thousand four hundred and
[28:08] thirty five dollars a lyria concrete
[28:10] step will take care of that and then
[28:12] we're still working on the metal roof
[28:14] extension so the special offerings will
[28:16] continue for a couple more months
[28:18] and we'll keep you updated on that and
[28:20] then i just wanted to share some
[28:22] pictures
[28:24] just

[40:16] this morning
[40:18] amen
[40:19] praise the lord
[40:21] and god is so good to us
[40:24] we're just so thankful for his mercy
[40:26] amen once again this morning
[40:29] good to see you amen the joshua and
[40:31] mariah god bless you good to have you
[40:33] here with us
[40:35] amen other visitors god bless you amen
[40:38] good to have you here
[40:40] amen
[40:41] it looks good out there doesn't it
[40:44] and uh
[40:46] i just you're so thankful amen for what
[40:48] the lord has done and what he's doing
[40:51] and
[40:52] i heard brother shane going over that
[40:54] with you to know that
[40:56] if we left it like it is right now it
[40:58] would look like it did before it does
[41:00] now
[41:02] so
[41:04] all of that's coming in process so
[41:06] we just want to turn our hearts and our
[41:08] attentions to the word of the lord and
[41:11] certainly want to greet
[41:12] all the fathers today
[41:14] may god just richly
[41:16] bless each and every one of you
[41:19] and
[41:21] just
[41:22] just a thought on my heart this morning
[41:25] that we want to
[41:26] speak on and kind of go along that
[41:28] direction but
[41:32] some things that has a real application
[41:34] to us
[41:34] in all parts of our lives because the
[41:37] word that god sent us
[41:39] and not just what he sent us in this
[41:40] hour but every age
[41:43] it is the pulsation of our heart
[41:45] that that word
[41:47] is preeminent in our lives
[41:50] and becomes expressed in our life
[41:54] the brandon made a very tremendous
[41:56] statement in the church age book when he
[41:58] spoke about
[41:59] the amount of truth that came
[42:02] in luther's day
[42:05] they said there was enough truth it
[42:06] would have revolutionized the world
[42:11] but here's what prevented it
[42:13] you know we can say well well the seals
[42:15] had to be opened the truth but what
[42:17] brother brown was talking about
[42:19] is the truth that had been given at that
[42:21] moment
[42:23] he said what men begin to do with it
[42:26] is they begin to listen to it
[42:29] in order to debate
[42:33] and he said instead of listening to it
[42:36] for a practical
[42:37] outworking
[42:39] in their lives
[42:41] that's what makes that's what separates
[42:44] a believer
[42:46] from just an ordinary person
[42:49] because a believer desires that christ
[42:51] would be preeminent in her life that
[42:54] is the goal and what we are put here for
[42:58] is that
[42:59] wherever we go
[43:02] wherever we are homes and everything
[43:05] that they can know
[43:07] that a christian has been here
[43:10] in other words we put it plainly
[43:13] it's once again god
[43:14] with skin
[43:17] you know the christian bookstore sold a
[43:19] lot of they sold those
[43:21] bracelets and different things ww jd
[43:24] what would jesus do well let me just put
[43:26] it very personal if you want to know
[43:27] what he would do
[43:30] look at what he is doing
[43:32] and look where he has veiled in his
[43:34] bride right now
[43:37] because that can be left up to
[43:38] interpretation to any man but god
[43:41] declares himself
[43:43] his attributes and who he is
[43:45] so that we can know
[43:47] in a reality this is what he's doing
[43:51] this is our our call i must be about the
[43:54] father's business
[43:56] amen
[43:58] as we stand and pray we want to also
[44:01] remember i think prayer requests i
[44:03] didn't hear
[44:04] all of those so maybe it was in there
[44:06] i'm sure it was we want to just continue
[44:08] to remember her sister doris
[44:10] she's been in the hospital here for
[44:13] through the week
[44:15] and
[44:16] she's
[44:17] doing
[44:18] she's doing much better she just needs
[44:20] her
[44:21] appetite and
[44:23] things to come back and
[44:25] she's
[44:26] what the doctors have said at this point
[44:29] they
[44:30] were able to identify
[44:32] by yes yesterday is that she
[44:34] does have
[44:36] i think brother mark was telling me here
[44:38] i can't find the text on here right now
[44:40] but
[44:41] where it was a
[44:43] slight pneumonia there in the lungs so
[44:46] the greatest thing we can do
[44:48] is and i know the prayer request that
[44:49] already went out is just to keep her in
[44:51] prayer
[44:53] also sister linda i want to just
[44:55] continue to lift her up in prayer and
[44:58] i've said this i say to you many many
[45:00] times but i think it bears repeating
[45:02] when you hear a report
[45:05] of what god is doing like when we talked
[45:07] about sister linda she was
[45:09] supposed to go home on june 17th but she
[45:12] didn't go home on june 17th
[45:15] and
[45:15] so they're just you know they were
[45:17] wanting to do a little bit more
[45:19] tests and things like that she's she's
[45:21] strong
[45:22] and i told her the other day on the
[45:23] phone when i as soon as she texts me
[45:25] about
[45:27] everything and i i just said it this way
[45:29] i said
[45:29] i
[45:30] don't look for satan to show up
[45:34] but i know
[45:36] with all these reports he's going to
[45:38] rear his ugly head
[45:40] but we are armed
[45:43] with the sword of the lord
[45:44] wherever his head comes up it's coming
[45:46] off
[45:49] brother samuel you you shouldn't speak
[45:50] that way brother branham takes a
[45:52] statement in 1965 the message of shame
[45:55] he said i feel in myself he says i've
[45:58] almost got to a point it's like i'm
[46:00] asking the devil to leave instead of
[46:02] adjuring him to leave
[46:05] his room what's he reminding us of and
[46:06] that message ashamed
[46:08] if we are ashamed of the son of man in
[46:11] this generation we should not be ashamed
[46:13] of this word this word has come to let
[46:15] us know who we are
[46:16] our god-given rights in this hour we
[46:19] don't have to back up we don't have to
[46:21] beg we don't have to plead we have
[46:22] god-given rights in this hour
[46:25] that we can stand there and the prophet
[46:27] could say and mighty god unveiled before
[46:29] us when that word has become foreign in
[46:31] our life then doom devils are on the run
[46:34] and he could say in 1962 wisdom versus
[46:37] faith when he's speaking of this word
[46:39] becoming prim in our life he says satan
[46:41] be careful with that group
[46:42] [Music]
[46:45] this is what the son of man has
[46:46] announced that's the power of this word
[46:49] it's not me it's not you it's christ in
[46:53] us
[46:55] and recognizing like david goliath was
[46:58] more than a match for david but he
[47:00] wasn't more than a match for god
[47:04] [Music]
[47:06] hallelujah
[47:08] that's why when we're lifting up this
[47:10] message we're not lifting up a man we're
[47:12] lifting up the son of man jesus christ
[47:17] oh my i'm not even going to preach on
[47:19] that this morning
[47:20] but i think it bears it bears mind when
[47:22] these things come up still keep on
[47:24] praying even more the earnest not oh
[47:27] oh praise the lord she's going home on
[47:28] june 17th we can just pull back on the
[47:30] prayers we keep praying
[47:33] we keep praying we keep swinging that
[47:34] sword
[47:36] we keep pursuing going right after it
[47:39] and i believe with all my heart we're
[47:40] not waiting on the bride to become a
[47:43] mighty army she is now a mighty army
[47:47] that satan's trick is to push something
[47:49] way out here
[47:50] right now
[47:52] right now right now
[47:54] so let's just go to the lord in a word
[47:56] of prayer
[47:57] maybe if you have an unspoken need a
[48:00] request you just like to make it known
[48:01] to the lord
[48:03] say father pass by my way you know the
[48:05] need lord
[48:07] heavenly father
[48:09] we are standing here this morning god

[49:10] greater than the other we can look at

[51:00] amen
[51:01] if you'll turn with me to first john
[51:03] chapter 2
[51:06] amen
[51:10] first john chapter 2 and i'm just going
[51:12] to read just
[51:14] a few verses of scripture
[51:17] this morning
[51:26] and verse 12
[51:32] i write unto you little children
[51:35] because your sins
[51:37] are forgiven you
[51:39] for his name's sake
[51:42] verse 13 i write unto you fathers
[51:46] because ye have known him
[51:49] that is from the beginning
[51:51] i write unto you young men because ye
[51:54] have overcome
[51:55] the wicked one
[51:57] i write unto you little children
[52:00] because you have known the father
[52:03] and i have written unto you fathers
[52:05] because ye have known him that is from
[52:07] the beginning
[52:08] and i have written unto you young men
[52:10] because you are strong
[52:12] and the word of god abideth in you
[52:15] and you have overcome
[52:17] the wicked one
[52:19] so i'd just like to speak this morning
[52:21] on i write unto you
[52:23] fathers
[52:25] may god bless you bless the reading of
[52:27] the word as you're being seated
[52:31] i realized sometimes that when we
[52:34] could begin to look
[52:37] going over
[52:38] looking at messages and
[52:41] dealing with family and everything else
[52:43] i realized sometimes that we all could
[52:45] get our toes ready to draw up in our
[52:48] shoes
[52:49] because of things that we can look at in
[52:51] our own selves and say
[52:53] well i'm not perfect
[52:55] or i haven't been perfect or maybe i
[52:57] didn't come out of a perfect home or
[52:59] maybe you said and say well i didn't
[53:01] really do a great job let me just say
[53:03] this to you i've learned this over the
[53:05] years of times of setting with with
[53:07] individuals where they would come after
[53:09] services when i would deal with things
[53:12] first of all
[53:13] the word of god
[53:15] is to be applied in every aspect
[53:17] and every part of our life
[53:20] secondly
[53:21] don't let the enemy condemn you to where
[53:24] you close off to where he can't to where
[53:26] god can't minister to you
[53:29] because no matter what has been done
[53:32] you can't live in the past
[53:35] god doesn't keep you in the past
[53:38] but what he does when he comes with his
[53:40] word is where we're able to identify we
[53:43] can see the wrong but also see the grace
[53:46] that we can move forward and no matter
[53:48] where we're standing at here this
[53:50] morning you might say well i'm no longer
[53:52] a father but you're many of you are
[53:53] grandfathers and there's still a
[53:55] responsibility that goes along with all
[53:57] of that so but there's the things that
[53:59] we can do because there's also young
[54:01] ones that's coming on others the
[54:03] children those that will and so forth
[54:05] these things are all necessary in the
[54:07] word of god they are not things when
[54:10] brother branham himself it's all the way
[54:12] through the message brother brown never
[54:13] handed people books and said well just
[54:15] look at this right here brother brahm
[54:17] didn't do that that's not what this
[54:18] message come to do
[54:19] matter of fact the lord jesus never did
[54:21] it paul never did it either
[54:23] paul took many many many chapters and
[54:26] wrote of how the life should be
[54:28] reflected in the home and how things
[54:31] should be conducted now i know the
[54:33] logical thing we could say is as well
[54:35] you know just get the people to the holy
[54:36] ghost and i agree
[54:38] getting the people to the holy ghost but
[54:40] you know what it doesn't then become
[54:42] something on autopilot
[54:45] this is why the word of god is
[54:48] ministered in our life to speak to that
[54:50] innermost part of our being and to give
[54:52] us direction in our life
[54:54] we we i'll say it like this we are
[54:56] people that are not to walk with
[54:58] presumption or assumption we are to be
[55:01] intentional people in this hour
[55:04] satan is not just assuming and whatever
[55:07] goes he's intentional
[55:09] everything that he's built even up to
[55:11] this time to think how things move from
[55:14] movie theater to television now here to
[55:17] the media the internet and everything
[55:18] else it keeps on he's intentional even
[55:21] with the things that he has done and
[55:23] placed out there even advertisements you
[55:26] can say i don't have none of those
[55:28] things but even advertisements and
[55:30] imagery that's put before us it can i'm
[55:32] just talking about advertisements and
[55:34] i'm not talking about advertisements for
[55:36] beer and cigarettes i'm talking about
[55:38] advertisements for things that'll even
[55:40] be put on a label of going to get your
[55:43] first mortgage
[55:45] i pay attention to a lot of things what
[55:47] are they putting before people on on
[55:49] marriage and everything else what are
[55:51] they putting before how are they doing
[55:52] this because you see satan wants in a
[55:55] way he doesn't come right out and wham
[55:57] like that but satan has a way that he
[56:00] wants to come to where it just becomes
[56:02] something you've seen enough to where it
[56:04] just becomes acceptive but we are called
[56:07] by the children by the by as the living
[56:09] god that the world should not be the
[56:12] influence on our lives
[56:16] god has set a standard in this hour and
[56:18] the standard is not a book it's not a
[56:21] tape it's not even a bible but the
[56:23] standard is christ who is the word now
[56:27] made flesh in our lives
[56:30] and that's a standard that speaks
[56:32] against the enemy
[56:35] hallelujah
[56:37] god said when he speaks in the natural
[56:39] that that our children are to speak at
[56:42] the gate god has children that speak at
[56:44] the gate
[56:46] the gate is jesus christ have a place
[56:49] that we can speak we we know where we
[56:52] are standing and i want to speak here uh
[56:54] just this morning just for a little bit
[56:57] and on on this thought
[56:59] uh the lord had placed on my heart
[57:01] probably a month ago or so i don't
[57:02] remember just one day in the middle
[57:04] studying the inspiration just dropped i
[57:06] laid everything else aside other outline
[57:08] and just
[57:09] went through it as god was just bringing
[57:11] it and
[57:12] i want to speak on that i write unto you
[57:14] fathers and if we could
[57:16] go back to verse 13 and i want to draw
[57:18] your attention here in this verse
[57:21] of how john would write this
[57:23] and he would specifically say i'm
[57:25] writing to fathers
[57:27] i'm writing to young men and i'm writing
[57:29] to children
[57:30] the holy spirit is writing here to all
[57:34] that are present fathers meaning those
[57:37] not just that have children but fathers
[57:40] meaning
[57:41] men who are established in the word of
[57:46] god
[57:48] men that others can look at and not just
[57:51] look at but can even go to and are in
[57:54] example and if they are an example
[57:58] fully and established now we can look
[58:01] and say well what about the young men
[58:03] well paul did write and say that we're
[58:05] not to despise our youth is that right
[58:08] and john is not by the spirit of god
[58:10] discretion
[58:12] minimizing that of the young men and the
[58:14] children but he's showing
[58:16] that there is all levels of maturity
[58:20] and it's all as the as the lord tarries
[58:23] that will continue to be in every
[58:26] assembly
[58:28] it should be there should be fathers
[58:30] here
[58:33] and the father is not well i've been in
[58:34] the message for 50 years you might be in
[58:36] the message for 50 years and you're
[58:38] still a child
[58:47] that all
[58:48] right i mean you you realize this in the
[58:51] world that there's individuals that they
[58:53] might be 30 years old and you get around
[58:56] them or 40 years old and you realize
[58:58] these people are chronologically 40
[59:00] years old but they're so
[59:02] immature
[59:04] there's no stability in their lives
[59:08] right
[59:09] they get their you know they have uh
[59:11] disagreement with their boss well fine
[59:13] i'm leaving immaturity they've not been
[59:15] taught how to handle conflict
[59:19] we can go on and on and pull from this
[59:20] the conflict's always going to be around
[59:22] you you don't run from conflict but you
[59:25] learn how to submit yourself in the
[59:27] midst of conflict conflict isn't you
[59:30] rising up it's submitting to one who is
[59:32] greater than you
[59:35] i'm writing unto you fathers those who
[59:38] are established so there's a
[59:39] responsibility that is fathers that we
[59:42] have
[59:43] young men meaning those who have such
[59:46] zeal and strength they've got stamina
[59:50] now every one of us you could take
[59:51] somebody here in my you know youthful 46
[59:55] years of age
[59:56] and there could be others that they
[59:58] might be 50 they got more stamina than
[1:00:00] me you can't compare me to them
[1:00:03] others it might be 30 and they have less
[1:00:05] than you you we do not compare that god
[1:00:08] has made every one of us
[1:00:10] differently for a purpose
[1:00:16] is that all right
[1:00:17] but a young man this is why writing in
[1:00:19] the scriptures it is good for a young
[1:00:22] man to serve the lord in his youth
[1:00:26] young men and so forth have strength and
[1:00:29] stamina that's why you know i had a
[1:00:30] brother ask me one time and you know he
[1:00:32] was wanting me to go to it wasn't a
[1:00:34] brother who comes here from india but
[1:00:36] they want me to go to india's one i was
[1:00:37] in some meetings with them and oh i want
[1:00:39] you to go to indy you know sometimes
[1:00:41] we'll go over there for six weeks i said
[1:00:43] brother i said you're you're an elder to
[1:00:45] me i said and you realize i said i'm a
[1:00:47] pastor
[1:00:48] i said let me also tell you with being a
[1:00:50] pastor i'm a homebody as well
[1:00:54] i like to go drop it and come back
[1:00:57] but i'm a pastor i've got other
[1:00:58] responsibilities i can't do that and go
[1:01:00] for six weeks on end but i said you know
[1:01:02] what some of the evangelists
[1:01:05] and get some i said the younger ones he
[1:01:07] said we're sending some of the young
[1:01:08] ones i said well you know what we keep
[1:01:10] sending them and praying that god that
[1:01:13] that effectual which it is having an
[1:01:15] effect i said that's what we need to do
[1:01:17] we utilize we're not trying to do it all
[1:01:19] ourselves we want to utilize everything
[1:01:21] that's around us
[1:01:24] right
[1:01:26] i mean can you imagine if the pastor is
[1:01:27] the one the pastor's the trustee the
[1:01:29] pastor's the deacon the pastor's the law
[1:01:31] and creditor the pastor's this the
[1:01:33] pastor's that
[1:01:35] wow i don't know where this is just
[1:01:38] it's all sorts we you know this is where
[1:01:41] we all should be in a place and saying
[1:01:43] god what would you have me do
[1:01:46] right here in this assembly what would
[1:01:48] you have me do
[1:01:50] what would you have me do
[1:01:54] is that right
[1:01:57] now
[1:01:59] fathers
[1:02:02] young men having strength and children
[1:02:04] newborn babes
[1:02:06] all of these parts to me this is
[1:02:08] incredible because
[1:02:11] with the father
[1:02:13] a father has seen things as it comes
[1:02:16] along even in stages and is there to
[1:02:19] minister nourishment along the way
[1:02:23] every one of us as fathers have got
[1:02:26] get and we'll get frustrated
[1:02:30] sometimes you're expecting more maturity
[1:02:33] or more things than what you're seeing
[1:02:35] right now
[1:02:38] i'll say amen for everybody lord
[1:02:42] it's true
[1:02:43] all right we're going to do this we're
[1:02:44] going to do that we're going to do this
[1:02:46] the room's going to be picked up here
[1:02:47] this and all
[1:02:50] of all these things
[1:02:51] right
[1:02:53] now as a father
[1:02:56] you realize
[1:03:06] i love you all but
[1:03:07] i told my boys i said look if god
[1:03:09] tarries
[1:03:10] i'm gonna have some daughter-in-laws
[1:03:13] and they are not gonna be your maids
[1:03:20] that's what i tell them you can ask them
[1:03:22] right now take them out and ask them say
[1:03:24] let me hear everything oh there's more
[1:03:25] than just that statement but there's
[1:03:26] things because you also want them to
[1:03:28] recognize you're a part of what goes on
[1:03:32] you just don't bring home the bacon the
[1:03:34] ham the pork chop whatever you want to
[1:03:35] call you just don't bring that home and
[1:03:36] say well i did my part and kicked my
[1:03:38] feet up you don't do that but a father
[1:03:40] is there to direct and to lead that
[1:03:43] household to be a help
[1:03:47] are you hearing me our heavenly father
[1:03:49] when he came down our heavenly father
[1:03:52] came down and says i did not come to be
[1:03:55] ministered to
[1:03:57] i am come to minister
[1:04:00] show us the father
[1:04:02] show us the father
[1:04:04] i write unto you fathers because you
[1:04:06] have known him
[1:04:08] that is from the beginning so paul is
[1:04:10] we're seeing this here because in a
[1:04:12] church my i'm just trying to get moving
[1:04:13] but i ain't even got off this this
[1:04:15] scripture but this this part of it all
[1:04:18] are present within an assembly fathers
[1:04:22] young men and children and you can put
[1:04:24] within that category just don't leave it
[1:04:27] for men but even across believers
[1:04:31] and we as believers it's working it's
[1:04:34] laboring it's ministering to all those
[1:04:36] parts because if god parries
[1:04:40] for those of us who stand as fathers now
[1:04:42] the young men will become fathers
[1:04:46] those who are children moving from young
[1:04:48] men uh to to fathers moving it's always
[1:04:51] it's a cycle you say listen how is it a
[1:04:54] cycle the scripture says in revelations
[1:04:56] 10 8 that we're to eat this book this
[1:05:00] word become one with this word and thou
[1:05:03] must prophesy
[1:05:05] again
[1:05:07] and the word again means that of a cycle
[1:05:10] or cyclic in nature
[1:05:14] in other words whatever you sow when
[1:05:16] they sow wheat over here in this field
[1:05:18] they they they are going you take from
[1:05:21] the crop that's coming in there's part
[1:05:23] you partake of and then there's a part
[1:05:25] you take and you sow back for another
[1:05:28] crop this word will reproduce jesus
[1:05:31] christ in every generation if he
[1:05:34] continues or tarries a hundred year from
[1:05:37] now i pray to god that it pulsates in
[1:05:40] our heart i want my children to be
[1:05:43] higher than i am
[1:05:46] i want them to be further along than
[1:05:48] what i am
[1:05:50] because that's the pulsation of this
[1:05:53] word
[1:05:56] when brother branham made the statement
[1:05:57] you know how he makes it things that are
[1:05:59] to be and other places in the message he
[1:06:01] said young men would take this message
[1:06:02] and sweep it sweep it onto the coming of
[1:06:04] the lord they'll take it higher
[1:06:06] it didn't mean the young men would
[1:06:08] become
[1:06:09] smarter
[1:06:10] it doesn't mean the young men or they'll
[1:06:12] know more than the prophet that's the
[1:06:14] problem sometimes
[1:06:16] sometimes people feel like that they
[1:06:18] know more than the messenger
[1:06:21] well brother branham made a mistake here
[1:06:24] brother bannon made an opinion there
[1:06:26] god never called anybody
[1:06:29] no one to do that
[1:06:31] i'll tell you what happens when you do
[1:06:32] that you're setting a pathway for your
[1:06:34] church you're setting a pathway for your
[1:06:36] home if he hadn't this happened here
[1:06:38] what about the rest of it
[1:06:41] well say you shouldn't be that bold oh i
[1:06:43] should be that bold because let me tell
[1:06:45] you there's others being bold calling
[1:06:47] things out
[1:06:49] [Applause]
[1:06:51] the bible says we ought to be able to
[1:06:52] rightfully divide the word but let me
[1:06:54] say this to you and i is to recognize
[1:06:56] who was revealed to us in this
[1:06:59] generation it was the son of man the
[1:07:02] lord jesus christ revealing himself
[1:07:04] through a son of man
[1:07:10] when jesus could say when you have seen
[1:07:12] me you have seen the father
[1:07:16] [Music]
[1:07:19] can i say this
[1:07:20] brother branham through his ministry
[1:07:22] could declare when you have seen this
[1:07:25] ministry jesus christ being reproduced
[1:07:28] again you have witnessed the same lord
[1:07:31] jesus christ
[1:07:32] beyond the veil
[1:07:35] beyond the veil
[1:07:37] for the randomness not jesus christ but
[1:07:39] it was jesus christ veiled behind badger
[1:07:42] skins
[1:07:44] [Applause]
[1:07:45] because with the purpose and intent that
[1:07:48] what is veiled when this message was
[1:07:50] being delivered that that same message
[1:07:53] would be conveyed in a bride badger
[1:07:56] skins it would be god with skin on it
[1:08:01] oh they would start as children
[1:08:06] you know when you start with your child
[1:08:09] they're staggering they're walking
[1:08:11] assembling this
[1:08:12] maybe they applied this a little wrong
[1:08:14] but you're right there you don't say ah
[1:08:16] you did that wrong no no
[1:08:19] you know how it is with the fingers you
[1:08:20] know you
[1:08:22] the training wheels you know you
[1:08:24] you take one off and
[1:08:26] leave one on and
[1:08:28] then eventually take that off and you've
[1:08:29] got a hold of their seat and
[1:08:31] you do that a number of times and any
[1:08:33] kids who have training those cover years
[1:08:35] right now
[1:08:36] eventually you know as you you get into
[1:08:37] a certain spot and they're used to you
[1:08:39] holding on the back of that seat holding
[1:08:41] on the back of that seat and pretty soon
[1:08:42] you know you're feeling are they
[1:08:44] balancing it
[1:08:45] you let them go a little bit and you're
[1:08:46] checking that out
[1:08:48] then eventually you know when to let go
[1:08:54] they might get a sting up near a knee
[1:08:56] get stung up but that's why they still
[1:08:57] sell peroxide
[1:09:02] but samuel this is this is not a
[1:09:04] mother's day message well it applies to
[1:09:05] us all but if mama had her way mama
[1:09:08] would have mattresses set all along the
[1:09:09] sidewalks
[1:09:12] oh junior don't fall they might be 40
[1:09:14] years old junior don't fall
[1:09:17] why that's the heart of a
[1:09:18] mother are you hearing me that's the
[1:09:20] heart of a mother
[1:09:22] and let me tell you something god is our
[1:09:24] father and he's also our mother
[1:09:29] [Applause]
[1:09:36] all these parts exist
[1:09:38] i don't i'm not i'm not bothered by
[1:09:40] brother saying aren't you down no i'm
[1:09:42] not down at all
[1:09:44] there we should be in an assembly
[1:09:46] children young men and i'm not putting
[1:09:48] you here and putting you there and
[1:09:50] putting me here i'm saying that should
[1:09:52] be
[1:09:54] if we have all fathers then we've got a
[1:09:56] problem
[1:09:59] then maybe fathers aren't doing what
[1:10:00] they need to be doing
[1:10:03] come on now but you see all the way
[1:10:05] through god has
[1:10:06] these set in place and each have
[1:10:10] their responsibility
[1:10:13] now the word known means
[1:10:16] to become acquainted with that's what
[1:10:17] this word knows you have known the
[1:10:20] father you become
[1:10:22] so acquainted with him
[1:10:24] you know what that speaks of
[1:10:26] relationship
[1:10:32] i can't dive that deep into that today
[1:10:33] but it speaks of relationship
[1:10:36] you see to the greeks it was all about
[1:10:39] knowledge this word known it's i know
[1:10:41] this and i know that and i know this and
[1:10:44] they knew they knew it
[1:10:46] but to the jews
[1:10:49] one did not know something
[1:10:51] until it was
[1:10:53] a practical or an outworking in their
[1:10:56] life
[1:10:58] now let me just say this to you
[1:11:01] there's things how when we're looking in
[1:11:03] the word
[1:11:06] from children to young men to fathers
[1:11:08] fathers did not become fathers
[1:11:11] because they were hearing the word and
[1:11:12] not praying over it
[1:11:16] let me preach now
[1:11:18] fathers did not become fathers because
[1:11:21] well they just were in the church long
[1:11:23] enough
[1:11:25] and i know the message
[1:11:27] they become fathers because praying that
[1:11:30] that word
[1:11:32] will become so preeminent god clear out
[1:11:34] traditions i have in my mind
[1:11:38] lord you're the father i never had
[1:11:42] you can say that
[1:11:44] you can also say lord jesus
[1:11:47] you are the one to instruct me there's
[1:11:49] examples around but lord if there's
[1:11:52] anything in my life that would hinder it
[1:11:54] see it's a relationship between you and
[1:11:56] god you don't become fathers without a
[1:11:58] relationship
[1:12:00] and look a person can say well i'm a
[1:12:02] child of god that's wonderful but you
[1:12:04] ought to want to become a young man in
[1:12:06] other words where you are now are moving
[1:12:08] with a zeal and a courage to move within
[1:12:12] the kingdom of god and then as a father
[1:12:15] one who's able to stand there with
[1:12:18] stability and strength to be an example
[1:12:21] to be a help to somebody then maybe
[1:12:23] let's say going to a brother and you
[1:12:25] don't have to go over and say hey
[1:12:27] brother you know i noticed by the way
[1:12:28] you're doing this and doing that and
[1:12:29] doing that sometimes i didn't know the
[1:12:30] earth here because that just goes
[1:12:35] but it's operating see a father is one
[1:12:37] who operates by wisdom
[1:12:40] sometimes it ain't even saying the
[1:12:42] noticeable
[1:12:46] paul said i have become
[1:12:48] all things
[1:12:50] to all men
[1:12:52] that i might win some
[1:12:54] to christ
[1:12:59] why the objective i just heard brother
[1:13:00] branham yesterday on my way home
[1:13:02] brother braham said in in shows the
[1:13:04] father
[1:13:05] listen to those messages and brother
[1:13:07] branham said and once again you've heard
[1:13:09] this he said there's nothing wrong with
[1:13:11] the product that we have
[1:13:14] he says but it's our presentation many
[1:13:16] times
[1:13:18] you see listen when you have the
[1:13:19] objective the goal is that a life is
[1:13:22] fully converted but you can't always
[1:13:24] come at a person and say
[1:13:26] you need to be converted
[1:13:28] sometimes you need what you need what we
[1:13:30] must have is let the effectual working
[1:13:33] of your conversion
[1:13:35] start to whet their appetite
[1:13:46] hallelujah
[1:13:50] practical outworking now
[1:13:52] in the message the token
[1:13:54] let me refer to a few of these places i
[1:13:57] think we're settled on that we recognize
[1:13:58] as a father a young man and a child we
[1:14:00] all have that as a congregation we have
[1:14:03] it within our lives the main thing that
[1:14:04] we want to do is is say god let this
[1:14:07] word be so
[1:14:09] preeminent in my life
[1:14:11] that's why different ones of you
[1:14:13] different ones i've told you i've said
[1:14:14] it right from the platform
[1:14:16] get in the message
[1:14:19] get in the message put the message of
[1:14:21] the hour on
[1:14:23] play it in your home
[1:14:26] you have it on phone we have it right
[1:14:28] before us over the same i don't
[1:14:30] completely understand let me tell you
[1:14:32] something what the message is the
[1:14:34] message is not a new idea
[1:14:38] [Applause]
[1:14:42] we have
[1:14:44] over i don't know how many thousands and
[1:14:46] thousands of man-made ideas
[1:14:50] this is not the message is a call out of
[1:14:54] babylon you know what babylon is it's
[1:14:57] confusion
[1:14:59] it's confusion
[1:15:02] telling oh jesus christ he's the
[1:15:04] greatest thing and then they're out here
[1:15:05] living any old way you see him outside a
[1:15:07] church and you realize church is only a
[1:15:10] club
[1:15:13] it's no more than the moose lodge or
[1:15:15] uawr being a member of whatever
[1:15:18] political party
[1:15:20] i'm preaching straight this morning
[1:15:24] but the message is a life
[1:15:27] it's the reproducing of the lord jesus
[1:15:30] christ
[1:15:31] according to his word in a body of
[1:15:34] believers not a man's idea
[1:15:38] [Music]
[1:15:43] this message come to call us out of
[1:15:45] confusion
[1:15:54] you know
[1:15:56] brother braham tells us in the token
[1:15:58] here and i just want to refer to certain
[1:16:00] places here
[1:16:02] it speaks of how jacob
[1:16:04] would tell his wife and all them
[1:16:08] to wash up their clothes and put
[1:16:10] everything put away their gods
[1:16:13] see it was in preparation
[1:16:15] right for a meeting with god
[1:16:18] see everything with prayer
[1:16:20] get everything ready
[1:16:21] get ready
[1:16:22] for this meeting with god
[1:16:25] joshua would say before crossing over
[1:16:27] wash your clothes come not at your wives
[1:16:30] and so forth get ready for within three
[1:16:32] days we'll cross over jordan
[1:16:35] he was getting ready and was applying
[1:16:37] the token
[1:16:38] but the brand says get ready
[1:16:41] apply it
[1:16:43] believe it
[1:16:44] clean up
[1:16:46] let your children let your family let
[1:16:49] your loved ones see it
[1:16:52] in you
[1:16:53] that's right
[1:16:54] it'll take an effect
[1:16:59] you catch what he's saying
[1:17:01] let them see
[1:17:02] it what's he talking about the token
[1:17:05] the life of jesus christ let them see
[1:17:08] it in you and it will take effect
[1:17:13] we all right now in this building could
[1:17:15] say god help me to die more to myself
[1:17:18] oh no don't put that on me
[1:17:21] thank you are you very
[1:17:23] what a wonderful brother-in-law
[1:17:26] [Applause]
[1:17:30] after service if we're sitting down
[1:17:31] somewhere you can grab one of those fans
[1:17:32] like the ten commandments
[1:17:34] [Music]
[1:17:41] i'd say
[1:17:42] he's a good guy i just i would be i i'd
[1:17:45] be i'd be sick tomorrow if i have that
[1:17:47] blowing on me right now
[1:17:49] but notice let him see it in you it'll
[1:17:51] take an effect sometimes when we get
[1:17:53] confused is we're wanting our knowledge
[1:17:56] to have an effect our knowledge will not
[1:17:57] have an effect
[1:18:00] and knowledge doesn't have an effect
[1:18:03] it's not knowledge that produces change
[1:18:07] it's relationship let them see it in you
[1:18:11] so so first of all it's having that
[1:18:13] relationship with god
[1:18:17] then that relationship with god then
[1:18:19] it'll have an effect on them when here
[1:18:22] when the lord jesus come what did he say
[1:18:24] his purpose was i am come here for this
[1:18:28] one purpose to reveal the father
[1:18:32] brother graham said it this way in the
[1:18:33] church age book he said the sun did not
[1:18:35] come to reveal the sun
[1:18:38] the sun came to reveal the father
[1:18:42] i love that statement man
[1:18:44] he came to reveal that that's that's
[1:18:45] where you and i are called is to reveal
[1:18:49] the lord jesus christ
[1:18:51] [Applause]
[1:18:53] that's why people ask what you believe
[1:18:55] where do you go to church you know what
[1:18:56] they're trying to find what husband are
[1:18:57] you united with
[1:19:02] and all of a sudden you begin to speak
[1:19:03] and say
[1:19:04] well you know uh we believe the full
[1:19:07] gospel okay uh that's narrowing it down
[1:19:10] you're definitely not catholic um
[1:19:12] you see it starts funneling it on down
[1:19:14] okay so now we got all these thousands
[1:19:16] that's still out there maybe upc jesus
[1:19:18] only maybe then you narrow then you're
[1:19:20] narrowing it on down and saying
[1:19:22] well we believe that a person must be
[1:19:25] born again
[1:19:26] still leaves you out there well you know
[1:19:28] the baptists believe that the
[1:19:29] pentecostals believe that
[1:19:31] but how do they believe it
[1:19:34] do they believe it the way the word
[1:19:36] teaches it or do they believe it the way
[1:19:39] that their factory seminary puts it out
[1:19:44] are you hearing me you know why they
[1:19:45] have to have seminaries because they
[1:19:47] don't know the holy ghost
[1:19:50] and jesus said when he has come he will
[1:19:53] teach you
[1:19:55] that's why no man has a right to stand
[1:19:57] in the pulpit until he has met the
[1:20:00] pillar of fire jesus christ face to face
[1:20:05] because otherwise it's his ideas his
[1:20:07] theories and he's not under the
[1:20:09] leadership of the holy spirit because
[1:20:12] the church of the living god is not led
[1:20:15] by man's ideas man's creeds
[1:20:18] they're led by the holy ghost
[1:20:23] [Applause]
[1:20:28] in this hour that's a foreign thing
[1:20:35] i'm not getting what i minister
[1:20:37] from my mailbox
[1:20:40] or my inbox
[1:20:46] coming straight from the throne of god
[1:20:48] like it does to every other
[1:20:51] every other minister of god
[1:20:54] because it's not one me or me trying to
[1:20:57] figure or find things out
[1:20:59] sometimes i can see needs and i've got
[1:21:01] to pray about it for so long
[1:21:04] sometimes god will address it here
[1:21:05] sometimes you address it in a different
[1:21:07] way
[1:21:09] but the time you've had to learn that
[1:21:10] yes and you could probably put that in
[1:21:12] capital letters i've had to learn that
[1:21:17] what a beauty it is when you learn and
[1:21:19] you can realize
[1:21:20] god's got this in control
[1:21:25] sometimes men are their
[1:21:28] sometimes men are their own stress
[1:21:29] factors
[1:21:32] is that right
[1:21:34] i mean pastor can be stressful but
[1:21:35] sometimes pastors are their own stress
[1:21:41] that's a separate one
[1:21:45] lord remind me of that one tomorrow
[1:21:47] [Laughter]
[1:21:49] notice this it'll take an effect how
[1:21:50] many believes them
[1:21:52] the holy spirit will have an effect
[1:21:55] you don't have an effect it has an
[1:21:56] effect in our home and in our lives let
[1:21:58] me just continue reading here then apply
[1:22:01] the token in prayer
[1:22:03] so
[1:22:04] letting them see it
[1:22:06] and then also applying it in prayer
[1:22:10] why do we pray
[1:22:12] do we pray hoping god's going to do
[1:22:14] something
[1:22:15] that ain't prayer
[1:22:17] prayer is you ask
[1:22:19] in believing
[1:22:22] you believe that why that's why you're
[1:22:23] asking
[1:22:24] right
[1:22:25] we're saying i ain't seen no different
[1:22:27] that's why the scripture says
[1:22:30] uh in the book of luke i think it's also
[1:22:32] in matthew when jesus is talking about
[1:22:34] the unjust judge we read that i think on
[1:22:36] the thursday night and then in another
[1:22:37] place he said he that knocketh
[1:22:40] he that asketh
[1:22:42] sometimes we think we're so i'm so big
[1:22:44] in faith i just asked one time and bless
[1:22:47] god i'm not going to ask no more
[1:22:50] you need a pen to deflate your air
[1:22:53] but a real child of god asks keeps
[1:22:55] asking keeps asking keeps asking keeps
[1:22:56] asking keeps asking
[1:22:58] keeps asking keeps asking keep saying
[1:23:00] ask keeps asking
[1:23:02] why do you keep asking it's not because
[1:23:04] of you have a lack of faith
[1:23:06] you're asking because i believe that god
[1:23:09] is the one to take care of this need
[1:23:15] because i can't do it but christ in me
[1:23:18] and what does prayer do prayer is not
[1:23:20] just asking him but through prayer when
[1:23:23] we get before the throne of god we start
[1:23:26] entering in
[1:23:27] to the footsteps of one another
[1:23:32] not god change so and so change so and
[1:23:34] so change so and so
[1:23:37] never work
[1:23:38] brother ram said when we really get
[1:23:39] before the throne of god he said what
[1:23:41] maybe somebody wronged us he said we'll
[1:23:43] actually start getting before the throne
[1:23:45] of god if we get there we will start
[1:23:47] saying lord
[1:23:49] my brother they didn't mean to do that
[1:23:54] my sister you see you start moving why
[1:23:57] you're in the atmosphere of the redeemer
[1:24:02] the high priest one who moves and is
[1:24:04] merciful and is faithful you begin to
[1:24:06] start put your because you can never
[1:24:09] ever move or allow the flow of
[1:24:11] redemption to move through your life
[1:24:14] without getting in the shoes of others
[1:24:19] oh they hurt me i know they meant to do
[1:24:21] it they might have
[1:24:23] maybe they did
[1:24:24] but a believer
[1:24:26] gives the benefit of the doubt
[1:24:31] now we're talking about
[1:24:33] when brother carmel is here and he
[1:24:34] preached on bitterness
[1:24:36] we're talking about where chambers in
[1:24:38] our lives
[1:24:39] we want treasuries of god's love
[1:24:42] treasuries of goodness i don't want
[1:24:44] treasuries
[1:24:46] like them guys when nehemiah was coming
[1:24:49] back and he found some of them was in
[1:24:51] cahoots with others and they were
[1:24:52] storing up their stuff in the tabernacle
[1:24:54] of god we stand as children of god and
[1:24:56] say uh-uh not in this temple
[1:25:02] the bible's told us offenses
[1:25:05] will come
[1:25:08] you have to look for them they come
[1:25:11] like a mailman delivering
[1:25:13] letters oh
[1:25:18] and they're more sure than publishers
[1:25:20] clearinghouse too
[1:25:28] apply it in prayer with consideration
[1:25:31] and with believing
[1:25:33] apply it with such love
[1:25:37] and so forth
[1:25:39] till you know it's going to take
[1:25:41] place
[1:25:43] just you catch what he's saying here
[1:25:46] apply it with such love
[1:25:48] that you know it's going to take place
[1:25:52] you see love remember the book of
[1:25:54] galatians
[1:25:55] faith
[1:25:57] worketh
[1:25:58] by
[1:25:59] love
[1:26:02] you can't have faith in your
[1:26:04] but this is where prayer listen to me
[1:26:06] now don't don't get oh brother samuel
[1:26:07] i'm i'm there i've been in that no
[1:26:09] listen this is where it has to come down
[1:26:11] to a place
[1:26:12] you can't address
[1:26:14] needs in your home and other place
[1:26:17] if you're not in love with the lord
[1:26:20] like you ought to be
[1:26:25] that relationship has got to be strong
[1:26:29] between you and god
[1:26:31] it's where we when situations come up
[1:26:34] really the first thing we want to do we
[1:26:35] need to do before we ever start praying
[1:26:37] about the situation is this lord
[1:26:40] take control of me
[1:26:42] come on if we just be honest here and
[1:26:44] you know and stop you know glorifying
[1:26:45] these
[1:26:47] natural elements are only worth 84 cents
[1:26:49] and i've got this down god take control
[1:26:51] of me take control of my thoughts and my
[1:26:53] emotions because
[1:26:55] there might be certain feelings or
[1:26:56] certain thoughts but that's first of all
[1:26:58] it's surrendering ourselves in the hands
[1:27:00] of god
[1:27:01] so many times we can quote the scripture
[1:27:03] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[1:27:04] but we miss the first part of that
[1:27:06] scripture
[1:27:08] which is the strength to resist and that
[1:27:11] is submit yourselves
[1:27:14] to god
[1:27:17] submission means our feelings our
[1:27:20] thoughts our attitudes are being
[1:27:23] submitted all
[1:27:24] to him
[1:27:30] he could probably preach a month or
[1:27:31] sundays on that last statement i made
[1:27:33] with letting our loved ones see it in us
[1:27:35] so how many times brother branham took
[1:27:37] questions of even between where you had
[1:27:40] a spouse serving the lord one not or one
[1:27:43] going to
[1:27:44] a methodist church and and one wanting
[1:27:46] to come to the tabernacle and brother
[1:27:48] brahma dressed he addressed that all you
[1:27:50] know i'm glad god had him address that
[1:27:52] what wisdom
[1:27:54] brother samuel how can you say it
[1:27:55] because i know sometimes
[1:27:58] that no where we're at in our journey
[1:28:00] sometimes
[1:28:01] i can look back even in certain things
[1:28:03] and look back and say
[1:28:05] god has given me grace to grow not that
[1:28:07] you become loose but that you realize my
[1:28:10] perspective on that just wasn't exactly
[1:28:13] where it needed to be
[1:28:17] see part of maturity is being able to
[1:28:20] recognize the greatness of our need in
[1:28:22] him
[1:28:24] and that we within ourselves can do
[1:28:26] nothing
[1:28:28] and you see brother brandon because
[1:28:30] think about it i mean brother joyce it
[1:28:31] maybe have been us we had been saying
[1:28:33] you make sure
[1:28:35] he's got to come with you
[1:28:38] bless god if he don't you divorce him
[1:28:43] i got pages and pages and pages on those
[1:28:46] things
[1:28:47] you know what brother brahms said to
[1:28:48] them when we're not having service here
[1:28:51] go with them
[1:28:53] it ain't because you're looking for food
[1:28:57] but what is it
[1:28:59] doing to win that life
[1:29:03] oh brother samuel they want to go to a
[1:29:04] family barbecue on sunday that don't
[1:29:07] apply
[1:29:09] that don't apply
[1:29:12] that don't work well i'm going to win
[1:29:14] them to cry win them to what
[1:29:18] when them to sunday's a special day
[1:29:20] we'll just be religious around the grill
[1:29:22] we're going to have a good family time
[1:29:24] without jesus christ being the center
[1:29:27] you see without him and your life being
[1:29:30] the center where is the drawing power
[1:29:33] what are you trying to draw them to well
[1:29:35] i want us just to be a nice family i
[1:29:36] want us just to be this it should be
[1:29:38] that god i want your life to lay touch
[1:29:42] an impression
[1:29:44] upon their lives
[1:29:46] like to smell when they're cooking those
[1:29:49] hamburgers
[1:29:50] or them steaks and they're just getting
[1:29:52] them seared and putting the garlic salt
[1:29:55] on them and the butter so it'll sizzle
[1:29:57] and all of a sudden you're there going
[1:29:59] lord have mercy boy i want hungry but
[1:30:01] now i'm ready is everything ready to go
[1:30:04] you're not saying it in a take charge
[1:30:06] voice you're saying it in angry is
[1:30:08] everything ready
[1:30:11] why you're s everything's got perked up
[1:30:14] there
[1:30:15] that's that's that's how
[1:30:20] christ living through our life
[1:30:23] is to be
[1:30:25] right
[1:30:27] but i want
[1:30:29] what you got
[1:30:35] right
[1:30:37] you better all right
[1:30:43] apply in confidence
[1:30:46] believing it's going to help
[1:30:50] when you talk to that child when you
[1:30:52] talk to your husband talk to your wife
[1:30:54] talk
[1:30:57] don't worry i got my timer
[1:30:59] i always do but
[1:31:08] when i look at this as i'm reading
[1:31:09] through it and i've prayed god
[1:31:11] just take the lord as we're standing
[1:31:13] here as i do each time and
[1:31:14] amplify what needs to be
[1:31:16] amplified
[1:31:18] talk to
[1:31:21] not lecture
[1:31:26] husband
[1:31:27] you should never
[1:31:29] talk
[1:31:31] to your wife
[1:31:33] as though she's your little girl
[1:31:38] and sisters
[1:31:39] you should not talk to your husband
[1:31:42] as though he's a little boy
[1:31:46] god didn't call you to raise him
[1:31:48] either way i know miriam young and raise
[1:31:50] him as you want him to be no that that
[1:31:52] that's not a quote
[1:31:57] train them in the way that they should
[1:31:58] go no that's not that don't apply to
[1:32:00] marriage
[1:32:04] but come on sometimes we're good
[1:32:06] lecturers
[1:32:07] daddy's too
[1:32:09] lord you know
[1:32:15] as we have to change as our kids get
[1:32:17] older and you start recognizing wait a
[1:32:18] minute here and
[1:32:21] i'm just it's hard
[1:32:22] it's hard
[1:32:24] because you're trying to find that
[1:32:25] because their steel has to be let me
[1:32:27] tell you something i can't get into all
[1:32:29] this today
[1:32:30] but standards and boundaries start from
[1:32:32] when they are young
[1:32:35] and all the way till they're older
[1:32:39] just because they're 18 does not mean
[1:32:41] well
[1:32:42] they just do what they want you know if
[1:32:44] they want to go to church
[1:32:46] i should have a paddle and take you in
[1:32:48] my office
[1:32:51] but you know what that because that has
[1:32:53] become
[1:32:54] the attitude of the home
[1:32:57] optional
[1:33:08] brother samuel don't they all have to
[1:33:09] have their own they do have to have
[1:33:10] their own experience but this is what
[1:33:12] i'm talking about fathers
[1:33:14] young men and children all are on
[1:33:17] different levels fathers know those same
[1:33:21] boundaries and standards have to be put
[1:33:23] in place that you just don't say well
[1:33:25] they're young men now
[1:33:28] i mean they're young men they're a
[1:33:29] marine age
[1:33:30] i mean come on autopilot but paul
[1:33:33] through titus said older brothers
[1:33:36] fathers
[1:33:38] not just older ones but fathers
[1:33:40] get a hold of those young men
[1:33:43] speak to them about being sober-minded
[1:33:44] in other words their minds all out here
[1:33:46] but try to draw it in and you can't go
[1:33:49] up and just say well you shouldn't be
[1:33:51] that way you shouldn't be this way how
[1:33:53] do i know that because you condensed to
[1:33:57] remember
[1:33:58] when you and i
[1:34:00] had 18 year old thoughts
[1:34:03] am i preaching the message
[1:34:06] that was what sister meaty had a problem
[1:34:08] with when rebecca ran out the door what
[1:34:10] do you expect me to be some wallflower
[1:34:12] in here
[1:34:14] playing rock and roll music on the piano
[1:34:15] in the house
[1:34:19] watch how brother branham approached
[1:34:21] that boy i tell you
[1:34:28] brother branham did not say she's 18
[1:34:30] years old she can listen to whatever
[1:34:31] kind of music she wants to listen to in
[1:34:33] the house
[1:34:34] not at all
[1:34:35] but listen to me neither was brother
[1:34:37] brown i'm a dictator
[1:34:45] that's why everything starts when
[1:34:47] they're little
[1:34:49] and goes all the way up so by the time
[1:34:51] they get to that and then pressures are
[1:34:53] coming they're experiencing music out
[1:34:55] there experiencing this there has been
[1:34:59] standards and boundaries all along you
[1:35:02] say boundaries
[1:35:04] tell me what keeps the ocean in check
[1:35:09] is it a new standard
[1:35:11] no same moon and what is the moon the
[1:35:15] moon is the type of the church
[1:35:19] keeps things in check
[1:35:21] i put it to be an ornament there in the
[1:35:24] seasons and to declare the different
[1:35:26] seasons that's why we need
[1:35:28] as parents as husbands as wife is let
[1:35:31] the light shine on me because god has
[1:35:34] placed me here to be a father to be a
[1:35:36] mother to be a wife to be a husband all
[1:35:38] those parts of grandfather let the rays
[1:35:41] of the light so shine so that might
[1:35:43] emanate through my life
[1:35:51] over the time i walk on the water and
[1:35:53] walk on your wife's heart
[1:35:58] walk all over your husband
[1:36:02] this gospel produces a life that goes
[1:36:04] outside a church
[1:36:08] that's the effect that's what the gospel
[1:36:09] that i preach it has an effect i'm not
[1:36:12] preaching something that i'm not a
[1:36:13] partaker of
[1:36:15] i'm preaching what i know to be the
[1:36:17] truth
[1:36:21] that's why brother branham lays it so
[1:36:23] clearly by the word of god
[1:36:25] you marry someone who believes like you
[1:36:27] believe
[1:36:29] [Applause]
[1:36:32] the problem with ahab and jezebel ahab
[1:36:34] did
[1:36:36] ahab was a wishy-washy guy
[1:36:40] we're just loving jesus you know
[1:36:43] and he married jezebel
[1:36:47] she's so beauty
[1:36:49] she's so pretty brother braham said that
[1:36:51] had to be the only thing she got going
[1:36:52] for her because she was a cruel woman in
[1:36:54] heart
[1:36:57] so what are you really marrying not this
[1:36:59] because this gets aged i mean
[1:37:01] [Laughter]
[1:37:05] comb went out of my cabinet a long time
[1:37:06] ago
[1:37:09] but where do you what do you marry
[1:37:11] character
[1:37:14] that's what you set your anchor in is
[1:37:16] real character
[1:37:22] i'm just going i'm going to preach while
[1:37:23] i'm here
[1:37:29] i don't care if a young man or a young
[1:37:31] lady comes to church with you
[1:37:35] i watch them how they behave in church
[1:37:38] and if this is the most boring thing in
[1:37:40] the world for them let me tell you what
[1:37:41] your home's going to be
[1:37:43] your home will be hell
[1:37:50] you want somebody that'll walk with you
[1:37:53] be a help with you
[1:37:55] somebody who loves the lord with you as
[1:37:58] a matter of fact you want somebody who
[1:38:00] loves the lord even in a greater way
[1:38:02] than you do so it'll challenge your walk
[1:38:04] with god
[1:38:06] [Applause]
[1:38:07] you don't want to have to pack them and
[1:38:09] pack them and pack them you weren't
[1:38:11] meant to be anybody's pack mule and even
[1:38:14] if your spouse isn't serving the lord
[1:38:16] you're not their pack mule be thou an
[1:38:19] example
[1:38:23] because i'm putting anybody down from
[1:38:24] decisions but these things i got to
[1:38:26] speak plain as it's coming to me
[1:38:32] girl might be the nicest person in the
[1:38:33] world doesn't mean that that should be
[1:38:34] your husband or your wife
[1:38:40] whoo
[1:38:42] mama
[1:38:46] apply it
[1:38:55] now watch this effect here i'm going to
[1:38:57] end on this quote but you know that can
[1:38:59] be deadly
[1:39:00] i got just a little bit more to go here
[1:39:06] apply it
[1:39:08] and create that atmosphere around you oh
[1:39:12] so applying it
[1:39:15] there's an atmosphere that comes
[1:39:20] that'll just that they'll just
[1:39:23] drop
[1:39:25] right into it
[1:39:27] before anything ever started coming out
[1:39:29] of the earth in genesis 1
[1:39:34] the spirit of the lord applied himself
[1:39:39] he didn't stand way back he applied
[1:39:42] himself
[1:39:44] that's what it means he began to
[1:39:47] he began to make love laying over now
[1:39:49] that didn't mean he's just letting the
[1:39:50] earth go no he there there is standards
[1:39:53] there is that which coming he's applying
[1:39:55] that word but notice there is with such
[1:39:57] a love that it's going to come to pass
[1:39:59] there is an atmosphere
[1:40:02] that must be present
[1:40:06] that's why in your homes
[1:40:08] all of our homes
[1:40:11] your atmosphere
[1:40:13] is very important
[1:40:17] things that you give yourself to what
[1:40:19] you allow in your home i'm just saying
[1:40:22] this to be very clear
[1:40:23] spirits travel by words
[1:40:33] it's very very very little samuel this
[1:40:36] is so simple i know i know
[1:40:38] i know
[1:40:40] i know
[1:40:42] but you know i kind of feel like brother
[1:40:43] branham when they kept on probing him
[1:40:45] and i'm hearing this all the way when i
[1:40:46] was traveling brothers
[1:40:48] brother branham you need to be teaching
[1:40:50] these people
[1:40:51] uh algebra come here i'm going to pray
[1:40:53] for you brother brian said i appreciate
[1:40:56] that brother
[1:40:56] i want to go on with god but if you'll
[1:40:58] let me return the favor too and let me
[1:41:00] pray for you
[1:41:02] because how can they learn algebra if
[1:41:04] they don't know their abcs
[1:41:10] that's it brother bill always believe
[1:41:11] christ
[1:41:13] simple
[1:41:14] it's simple but god help me to be simple
[1:41:16] this message does not cause us to be
[1:41:19] i know and bless god you gotta come to
[1:41:21] our church and we've got the unfolding
[1:41:22] of the fold of the unfold and we fold
[1:41:24] and we fold and we
[1:41:26] i do too when we fold sheets and towels
[1:41:28] and everything else but when i consider
[1:41:30] an unfolding i'm looking at when god
[1:41:32] unfolds himself he is coming to fold
[1:41:34] himself into somebody
[1:41:40] wow lord this is
[1:41:44] they'll just drop right in if you got
[1:41:45] the token you create a spirit around you
[1:41:48] a power
[1:41:50] a power
[1:41:52] that when you walk
[1:41:54] people know that you're a christian
[1:42:00] they love you for love for you to say
[1:42:02] something to them they believe your word
[1:42:04] and what you say they hold on to it
[1:42:06] that's it
[1:42:07] apply
[1:42:08] the token
[1:42:10] and then walk with it
[1:42:14] prayer
[1:42:17] with a such a love
[1:42:19] such a confidence
[1:42:24] being salty
[1:42:26] and that appliance let me say this right
[1:42:28] now
[1:42:32] the strength of your relationship with
[1:42:34] the lord
[1:42:35] will also translate
[1:42:37] to that of your household
[1:42:41] are you hearing me
[1:42:43] it it translates to that it has in other
[1:42:45] words
[1:42:46] there there's an effect
[1:42:48] that comes from with that
[1:42:50] let me just maybe that's i don't mean
[1:42:52] the same thing but i don't want that to
[1:42:53] be algebra let's just bring it down here
[1:42:55] for people like me
[1:43:00] in other words a people a person cannot
[1:43:03] say
[1:43:04] i'm got such a wonderful relationship
[1:43:06] with the lord my prayer life's so good
[1:43:08] and they're bitter
[1:43:11] that that don't work
[1:43:13] oh i got such a wonderful prayer life
[1:43:15] that i'll tell you brother so-and-so and
[1:43:16] sister so
[1:43:18] you're going through the motions
[1:43:20] but you're really not praying
[1:43:27] this is why listen who we're trying to
[1:43:28] uncover here is the enemy
[1:43:31] you're not the enemy i'm not the enemy
[1:43:33] let's let it be known satan is the enemy
[1:43:37] his objective is to try to come and
[1:43:40] hinder
[1:43:41] relationships because he knows the power
[1:43:44] of christ being revealed through a
[1:43:46] father through a mother through a
[1:43:48] husband through a wife through a brother
[1:43:50] through a sister he knows the power of
[1:43:52] that
[1:43:54] that that itself will have more effect
[1:43:57] than every word that we can say
[1:44:01] that's why i would be
[1:44:02] just encourage us and i'm just going to
[1:44:04] stop here that's why i just encourage us
[1:44:07] we didn't get very far
[1:44:13] page two
[1:44:15] that's because we had a big definition
[1:44:16] on page one
[1:44:19] and we'll pick it up at another time
[1:44:20] here
[1:44:22] but if applying it
[1:44:24] let me just stop with this say this
[1:44:28] see sometimes on the stop we're doing a
[1:44:30] rolling stop
[1:44:37] like i tell my boys when i'm in the past
[1:44:38] you see
[1:44:39] uh
[1:44:40] you stop
[1:44:42] i hadn't seen the white line yet so it
[1:44:44] made me thrown up here
[1:44:46] am i right brother rocco i'm not just
[1:44:48] looking for a stop sign i want to know
[1:44:49] the white line so it's not right here
[1:44:50] maybe it's up there i need to roll on up
[1:44:52] there a little further
[1:44:54] but to apply it but joy to apply it
[1:44:58] this word that god has given us
[1:45:01] you know what i love about this
[1:45:03] we don't have to be the smartest person
[1:45:04] in the world
[1:45:06] i don't have to know every quote in
[1:45:07] other words i've got to be able to give
[1:45:09] that and i recite the quote i don't have
[1:45:11] to know every verse now that's not
[1:45:12] excusing us not giving ourselves to the
[1:45:14] lord
[1:45:15] but what's important is that our lives
[1:45:18] what we are hearing and we're reading
[1:45:21] it's soaking in down here
[1:45:23] it can come right in right here but
[1:45:25] remember as it comes down here so god i
[1:45:27] want it to sink down in here
[1:45:31] listen i want to apply it that is part
[1:45:33] of applying it
[1:45:35] lord i want this word lord teach me lord
[1:45:38] show me the things i i'm seeing some
[1:45:40] things right here this morning but i'm
[1:45:42] asking you lord to teach me and to show
[1:45:44] me you know what that is that's
[1:45:45] relationship
[1:45:47] with the lord jesus christ he's not
[1:45:49] given you a word
[1:45:52] and he's not present to make it live
[1:45:57] that's brother aaron when when satan
[1:46:00] came to eve in the form of the serpent
[1:46:02] he came to her and said yea hath
[1:46:05] god
[1:46:06] said
[1:46:08] god meaning object one whose
[1:46:10] self-existence far off he wasn't
[1:46:12] self-existent
[1:46:15] not at that time remember he existed
[1:46:17] with his thoughts now his thoughts have
[1:46:18] become
[1:46:19] manifest and god had already revealed
[1:46:21] himself as lord god
[1:46:24] jehovah
[1:46:25] one who's not it's not existing with his
[1:46:27] family but one who has become family
[1:46:32] and what satan was trying to do is your
[1:46:34] daddy don't understand it your mama
[1:46:36] won't understand it oh they're so far
[1:46:38] off and they're so this and let's just
[1:46:40] be honest as parents that's where i
[1:46:42] believe the holy spirit would take the
[1:46:44] prophet and tell us regarding that was
[1:46:45] sister rebecca and she ran out that way
[1:46:48] and brother brown could tell sister
[1:46:49] meaty
[1:46:50] meaty
[1:46:51] she's 18 years old and he didn't say
[1:46:55] well we just need to let her do what she
[1:46:56] wants to do you know she's an 18 year
[1:46:58] old she can vote
[1:47:01] i could make some comment i won't
[1:47:04] she can vote
[1:47:05] you know she can do this
[1:47:08] we're not letting society determine
[1:47:11] maturity
[1:47:13] that's a big problem right now
[1:47:17] preach brother samuel
[1:47:19] you got mature men maybe drawing social
[1:47:21] security in a basement playing a video
[1:47:23] game
[1:47:25] whoa i see that stop line i see it way
[1:47:27] on out there
[1:47:32] but what did he say you gotta think 18
[1:47:36] year old thoughts
[1:47:38] you know what sister meat he said sister
[1:47:40] amanda she's gonna say glory to god who
[1:47:42] pray you know what she said
[1:47:44] that's my daughter
[1:47:49] she didn't realize you know what brother
[1:47:50] brown had to tell her
[1:47:51] meaty
[1:47:53] i am your husband
[1:47:54] father of the children
[1:47:57] but what's been spoken is the same thing
[1:48:00] that god has spoken to other parents
[1:48:02] he didn't say those exact words but he
[1:48:04] told her he said he's letting her know
[1:48:06] this is not just
[1:48:07] a dad and mom conversation
[1:48:10] god the prophet looks like friend this
[1:48:13] message is not from the mind of a man it
[1:48:16] came from the mind of god
[1:48:20] so everything that in our homes
[1:48:23] it should be with the application of
[1:48:25] everything the principles
[1:48:28] should be from the word of god
[1:48:31] not subtly intentionally
[1:48:35] not something we nail up on a wall
[1:48:38] but something that we is within our
[1:48:40] lives
[1:48:45] you've got to think 18 year old thoughts
[1:48:49] yay hath god said
[1:48:55] he doesn't even understand you
[1:48:57] look at him
[1:48:59] he's off looking at his phone and you're
[1:49:01] in your bedroom and there's no
[1:49:03] relationship

[1:49:12] somebody keep moving that strip on the
[1:49:14] floor
[1:49:15] you understand what i'm saying what's he
[1:49:17] trying to do
[1:49:18] trying to put it in a manner god had
[1:49:21] already revealed himself as one
[1:49:24] with his family
[1:49:27] other words you're tempted come to me
[1:49:31] come to me
[1:49:32] i'm not going to look and say how could
[1:49:34] you joy how could you be tempted that
[1:49:36] way boy you ought to know god wants to
[1:49:38] so make himself known by his word that
[1:49:41] the word is not something that's
[1:49:42] canceling you out but if there's
[1:49:44] something that's wrong in your life you
[1:49:46] have a place to come to somebody

[1:50:53] even when i was looking this morning
[1:50:55] just sensing lord
[1:50:59] but i'm always
[1:51:00] father
[1:51:03] and i know lord your children they feel
[1:51:04] the same way and that's what they desire
[1:51:06] lord as a pastor as any man of god any
[1:51:09] ministry that stand here is just obey
[1:51:11] the lord
[1:51:12] because lord this
[1:51:14] this spiritual food
[1:51:16] its nourishment to us
[1:51:19] now father would you help us lord
[1:51:22] i'm asking you lord humbly
[1:51:26] as a father
[1:51:28] and as a husband lord in the natural
[1:51:31] i'm asking you lord god as a pastor i'm
[1:51:34] asking you
[1:51:35] all of these things
[1:51:38] and i believe there's others lord that
[1:51:41] they'd like to join in the same request
[1:51:45] help me lord
[1:51:47] to apply
[1:51:50] this token
[1:51:53] in the right way lord
[1:51:55] because it can't just be applied anyway
[1:51:58] it's got to be applied as your prophet
[1:51:59] put it
[1:52:01] he said in prayer with love
[1:52:03] and consideration
[1:52:06] applied in confidence
[1:52:08] applied in such love
[1:52:12] lord help god every
[1:52:13] [Music]
[1:52:14] each and every one every parent every
[1:52:16] spouse every child of god right here
[1:52:18] this morning
[1:52:21] lord i'm sure we all can look under the
[1:52:23] great
[1:52:24] mri
[1:52:26] of the word of god as it searches the
[1:52:28] very intense things of our heart
[1:52:31] or maybe there's one here this morning
[1:52:32] that they still have ought in their
[1:52:35] heart against
[1:52:36] maybe a parent
[1:52:38] but may they recognize god and enter in
[1:52:40] right now
[1:52:42] and realize lord that they can't carry
[1:52:44] that on in their life not not just me
[1:52:47] telling them lord but to realize that
[1:52:49] satan would love that scar to so affect
[1:52:52] them
[1:52:53] and how that they would relate to others
[1:52:55] raise their children or
[1:52:57] it goes on and on how they would relate
[1:52:59] to others in the body of christ
[1:53:01] they might lord god be a wonderful
[1:53:04] believer wonderful brother and sister
[1:53:06] but maybe lord god recognizing like paul
[1:53:08] would say don't give no place to the
[1:53:10] devil if you recognize there's something
[1:53:12] and you might even have a right
[1:53:14] to have that ought or to have that hurt
[1:53:17] but as a lamb of god why don't you just
[1:53:19] forfeit it to the lord
[1:53:21] and say lord i just give it over to you
[1:53:24] i committed to you lord
[1:53:26] i i surrender
[1:53:29] i don't want anything lord to hinder
[1:53:31] that relationship i want you to teach me
[1:53:33] papa
[1:53:34] help me lord god
[1:53:36] maybe he is sitting here this morning
[1:53:38] maybe 70 years old maybe 80 i don't know
[1:53:41] i don't know the exact ages and things
[1:53:43] like that
[1:53:45] but i pray
[1:53:48] i look at it here in this year as of
[1:53:50] this day this very day
[1:53:53] father's day in 1995
[1:53:56] is where the holy spirit
[1:53:59] took a hold of my life
[1:54:01] [Music]
[1:54:04] 27 years later
[1:54:06] [Music]
[1:54:10] i love you more now lord
[1:54:14] and i know i realize i need you more now
[1:54:18] lord god i need you lord and i'm sure
[1:54:21] that every one of our my brothers and
[1:54:23] sisters can say the same thing lord as
[1:54:26] we
[1:54:27] as we grow in you
[1:54:29] [Music]
[1:54:30] we learn
[1:54:33] to rely less upon
[1:54:35] the flesh
[1:54:37] and rely
[1:54:38] upon the holy spirit
[1:54:41] [Music]
[1:54:43] lord we're thankful we don't all like
[1:54:44] your prophet would teach us over and
[1:54:46] over
[1:54:47] we are not born
[1:54:49] fully matured
[1:54:50] [Music]
[1:54:51] even spiritually
[1:54:53] your prophet would take us lord all the
[1:54:55] way through the message
[1:54:59] showing us how we grow even how paul
[1:55:01] would write that in the scriptures we
[1:55:03] grow
[1:55:06] lord god that's our desire we want to
[1:55:07] grow i want to grow lord
[1:55:10] in every capacity lord god that
[1:55:13] as a son of god
[1:55:15] as a husband as a father
[1:55:18] i don't want to just lord you know
[1:55:21] i've asked you and i continue to ask me
[1:55:24] help me to be a better daddy
[1:55:27] teach me father
[1:55:29] teach me to be a better husband help me
[1:55:31] lord show me
[1:55:33] i'm not coming to i don't want a plateau
[1:55:36] no
[1:55:38] plateau that's the same as being
[1:55:40] backslidden
[1:55:41] you come to a spot you're no longer on
[1:55:43] fire and moving forward but lord god i
[1:55:45] want to keep moving
[1:55:46] [Music]
[1:55:48] i find where your prophet could stand
[1:55:50] there and on the wings of a snow white
[1:55:52] dove in 1965
[1:55:54] and he could refer
[1:55:56] to after the seals had been opened
[1:55:59] and he would stand there where he would
[1:56:01] wrote in rock
[1:56:03] in white
[1:56:05] eagle
[1:56:07] right there on that mountain in arizona
[1:56:11] he would speak let the let the dove
[1:56:14] the holy spirit in eagle time prophetic
[1:56:17] time let it lead us
[1:56:20] let it guide us
[1:56:22] eagle the sharp eye that's able to reach
[1:56:24] down and uncover things in our life that
[1:56:27] has been hindrances things
[1:56:30] that god could say i'm here to free you
[1:56:32] my son i'm here to free you my daughter
[1:56:34] oh we can be fully brother samuel are
[1:56:36] you saying i'm not sealed i'm not saying
[1:56:38] you're not sealed you can be a sealed
[1:56:40] away believer in jesus christ and the
[1:56:42] holy spirit can go down and begin to
[1:56:45] deal with complexes
[1:56:47] deal with things
[1:56:49] that maybe you've carried as a child
[1:56:51] scars and other things
[1:56:53] and he can go right down remember he is
[1:56:55] jehovah rafa
[1:56:57] not just when you've got a cut on your
[1:56:59] body but he could go down
[1:57:01] and like no other
[1:57:03] he can minister to your spirit
[1:57:07] won't you just let him do it the prophet
[1:57:10] would say in that place think of it one
[1:57:13] growing and maturing
[1:57:15] and in prayer to the lord jesus he could
[1:57:17] say
[1:57:18] lord
[1:57:21] this
[1:57:22] word this revealing of yourself has led
[1:57:25] me
[1:57:27] to a faith
[1:57:28] i've never
[1:57:30] had
[1:57:31] before
[1:57:35] this is where lord as our faith must
[1:57:37] continue to grow
[1:57:39] our lives as children of god must
[1:57:41] continue to grow
[1:57:44] help us lord no matter where we would
[1:57:46] fall at
[1:57:48] children young men or fathers no matter
[1:57:51] i'm glad to be here and i want to keep
[1:57:53] pressing on
[1:57:54] if i'm a child i'm glad to be here i'm
[1:57:56] glad my sins are forgiven
[1:57:58] i'm glad to be here a part of the body i
[1:58:01] want to keep pressing on
[1:58:05] if i'm a young man i'm glad to be here
[1:58:09] things that god has begun to open and
[1:58:11] show me
[1:58:14] i want to use the zeal and the strength
[1:58:17] under his
[1:58:18] leadership if i'm a father
[1:58:22] i want to be effectual
[1:58:25] because a father is not somebody who has
[1:58:26] on a designated long robe
[1:58:29] or badges on the sleeve that recognize
[1:58:32] i've been around the message or i've
[1:58:33] been in this church for so long right no
[1:58:35] no that's not a father
[1:58:37] but i went out to consider the prodigal
[1:58:39] son when he came home
[1:58:40] this is what i see as a father
[1:58:43] one
[1:58:44] who was willing
[1:58:46] to take his garment
[1:58:48] and pull it up
[1:58:50] and tuck it
[1:58:51] [Music]
[1:58:52] as one who is girded
[1:58:54] so that he can run to meet his son
[1:58:58] it was a shame for a patriarch that his
[1:59:01] legs would be shown
[1:59:04] but lord that was only a great type
[1:59:07] of how that in humiliation
[1:59:10] you came down
[1:59:13] to rescue me
[1:59:15] rescue my brothers rescue my sisters
[1:59:17] lord god help us
[1:59:18] help us lord
[1:59:21] help us a lot
[1:59:23] help us to apply it lord
[1:59:25] the applying of the word lord sometimes
[1:59:27] the applying of the word or it may not
[1:59:28] seem real real spiritual
[1:59:30] but the word is the word
[1:59:32] and the holy spirit would give us
[1:59:34] direction
[1:59:35] no no
[1:59:36] this is not done in the house but it's
[1:59:38] not just we don't do this we don't do
[1:59:39] that but it's
[1:59:40] it's there sometimes that application of
[1:59:42] the token oh it isn't quoting
[1:59:44] revelations chapter 8 and there was a
[1:59:46] half hour of silence
[1:59:48] no
[1:59:49] but the application of it
[1:59:52] well i'm going to set it down and i'm
[1:59:53] going to play a tape so they can hear it
[1:59:54] that's wonderful but the application of
[1:59:57] it it comes down how do you apply it
[1:59:59] when they're three years old four years
[2:00:00] old you apply the word
[2:00:02] the living before them there's
[2:00:04] boundaries there's judgments there's
[2:00:06] justice there's that within the word of
[2:00:07] god even the simple things of obedience
[2:00:10] and respect
[2:00:12] [Music]
[2:00:13] that's applying the token
[2:00:17] oh god help us
[2:00:19] sometimes lord we've made the applying
[2:00:22] the token we've made it so
[2:00:25] way out there and so deep
[2:00:28] that we've missed the opportunities
[2:00:31] and our responsibility that that
[2:00:33] application
[2:00:35] it comes down
[2:00:37] in every facet of our life
[2:00:43] god grant us the strength anybody want
[2:00:45] to be remembered say lord help me
[2:00:47] i got both of my hands up if i had more
[2:00:49] hands i'd put them up
[2:00:50] i'm not saying that to cause you to do
[2:00:52] it i'm just saying god help me maybe you
[2:00:53] don't even have children right now maybe
[2:00:55] this isn't just about whether you have
[2:00:56] children or not you might be a
[2:00:57] grandfather might be whatever as a
[2:00:59] believer all across the board lord
[2:01:02] help me lord help me lord god in the
[2:01:04] application of the word teach me lord
[2:01:08] grant it lord god
[2:01:10] may you just move lord across every need
[2:01:12] you know where that need is specifically
[2:01:14] in each of our lives you're that kind of
[2:01:16] a father
[2:01:17] that you know your children
[2:01:20] lord god not one who's distant from us
[2:01:23] not one who can't understand us
[2:01:26] but one who's right here with us
[2:01:30] thank you father
[2:01:31] minister to your children lord
[2:01:34] god even as we would leave from this
[2:01:36] place here in the lord in in in a time
[2:01:38] and
[2:01:39] i pray that god even through the week
[2:01:41] through the day lord as we meditate upon
[2:01:43] that and that's a that's the heart's cry
[2:01:44] lord help me to apply it lead me direct
[2:01:47] me lord
[2:01:48] in the name of jesus christ
[2:01:52] amen amen
[2:01:54] don't you love him
[2:02:00] hallelujah
[2:02:02] amen i want to share something with you
[2:02:04] but i
[2:02:04] let's just sing let's just sing we'll
[2:02:06] we'll get to it at another time
[2:02:08] don't you love him amen
[2:02:11] oh i just appreciate the lord so much
[2:02:15] maybe i will go ahead and share it real
[2:02:17] quick
[2:02:18] [Music]
[2:02:23] you know when billy brother billy paul
[2:02:24] he once serving the lord
[2:02:28] brother billy paul tells his testimony
[2:02:31] he came in and brother brown think of
[2:02:32] this brother iran was preaching the
[2:02:33] message
[2:02:34] the prodigal son
[2:02:36] [Music]
[2:02:38] and in the midst of that message
[2:02:41] a deacon feels so impressed
[2:02:45] he goes and sits down by brother billy
[2:02:46] and says
[2:02:48] you need to give your life to the lord
[2:02:49] you need to do this
[2:02:54] brother billy paul
[2:02:56] after the service walked
[2:02:58] on
[2:03:00] but the next day
[2:03:02] brother branham had a meeting with
[2:03:03] brother billy palm
[2:03:06] and he said billy
[2:03:07] i want you to know he said i talked to
[2:03:09] that deacon
[2:03:11] he said because what he did was not
[2:03:13] right
[2:03:20] brother braham said i told that deacon
[2:03:22] when god deals with his heart god deals
[2:03:24] with his heart but see god's dealing
[2:03:26] sometimes we're not seeing the
[2:03:29] movement right there and we're just
[2:03:30] saying jesus here here it is he's not
[2:03:32] moving is this all right he ain't gonna
[2:03:33] trip are you he ain't moving so jesus
[2:03:35] i'm just gonna bring him along jesus i'm
[2:03:37] gonna jesus i'm helping you you ain't
[2:03:39] helping jesus
[2:03:42] you ain't helping jesus
[2:03:46] you think i could do that did you
[2:03:48] you ain't helping jesus like that
[2:03:51] but see i'm going back where you were
[2:03:54] but here's what brother branham did when
[2:03:56] brother billy paul he wasn't living
[2:03:58] there in the house he was living down
[2:03:59] with his grandma
[2:04:01] that one brother brown that was he went
[2:04:03] down there
[2:04:05] brother branham every tuesday
[2:04:07] was fishing day with billy paul and it
[2:04:10] went because brother branham liked
[2:04:11] fishing
[2:04:12] it was because
[2:04:16] [Music]
[2:04:19] he won't come to where i am
[2:04:22] i gotta go to where he is
[2:04:25] [Music]
[2:04:30] it didn't mean that brother branham
[2:04:31] walked over there to him and said
[2:04:35] all right we're going to spend time
[2:04:37] together chapter 3
[2:04:40] she must be born again
[2:04:42] god take a hold of my no
[2:04:45] i'm not saying things to be funny i'm
[2:04:47] trying god's given direction on how to
[2:04:49] apply it
[2:04:50] if if brother branham had done that
[2:04:52] billy paul would have been further on
[2:04:54] away
[2:04:55] you know what he needed he needed
[2:04:57] contact with god
[2:04:59] sometimes it's not what we're saying
[2:05:01] remember apply it and let it create an
[2:05:04] atmosphere
[2:05:06] sometimes we're wanting to see come on
[2:05:08] again sometimes we're wanting to see
[2:05:10] this on out here lord i want to see this
[2:05:13] but genesis 1 said
[2:05:15] the spirit of the lord
[2:05:17] god said
[2:05:19] let there be light
[2:05:21] what was he speaking to
[2:05:23] the need that was present to address the
[2:05:25] darkness
[2:05:27] there are seeds that's down beneath that
[2:05:29] darkness
[2:05:31] you got to believe that there's a son
[2:05:32] and daughter of god beneath that child
[2:05:34] of yours there's a son and daughter of
[2:05:36] god beneath that wife or that husband
[2:05:38] yours you've got to believe it that way
[2:05:41] you say why do i have to believe it that
[2:05:43] way because then you can recognize if
[2:05:46] that's what it is that the desire is
[2:05:48] then you operate by the things of god
[2:05:50] and recognize your words matter
[2:05:54] your words matter
[2:05:56] [Music]
[2:05:58] words create an atmosphere is that right
[2:06:03] but then after after those words the
[2:06:05] bible said after the words went forth
[2:06:07] remember the spirit of god travels with
[2:06:09] the word
[2:06:14] [Music]
[2:06:17] this is why
[2:06:19] the words must be spoken
[2:06:22] and it isn't always quote in scripture
[2:06:24] sometimes you need to be the scripture
[2:06:25] in flesh
[2:06:26] [Music]
[2:06:27] but they need to be born again be an
[2:06:29] example of born again
[2:06:33] we're not people aimlessly wandering
[2:06:35] around
[2:06:36] are you hearing me now
[2:06:39] i don't want people to sh i don't want
[2:06:40] people to shut me out
[2:06:44] but then we're not talking about
[2:06:45] appeasing people but i'm talking about
[2:06:47] letting that life make contact
[2:06:50] it's an atmosphere what brother graham
[2:06:52] say that atmosphere they'll drop into it
[2:06:55] it might be your grandson or your
[2:06:57] granddaughter and here you are sitting
[2:06:59] on the bank
[2:07:02] hey house think going to school
[2:07:03] [Music]
[2:07:06] what are you doing opening up
[2:07:07] conversation
[2:07:09] i have become all things
[2:07:11] through all men then i might win some
[2:07:13] to christ
[2:07:18] man
[2:07:19] it keeps opening
[2:07:21] that's part of our application it don't
[2:07:24] that don't seem you're okay you can go
[2:07:25] on back
[2:07:26] maybe for now that don't seem real
[2:07:28] spiritual does it brother aaron man
[2:07:30] that's real i'll tell you what i'm
[2:07:32] really deep
[2:07:33] i'll let them
[2:07:35] i'll let them know about the white horse
[2:07:36] rider and the raiders right now i'm not
[2:07:37] making light of those things
[2:07:41] but sometimes what what it is they need
[2:07:42] to see is they need to see the power in
[2:07:44] you that's already overcome the white
[2:07:45] horse the red horse the black horse and
[2:07:47] the pale horse
[2:07:48] and let him right in in power in our
[2:07:51] life
[2:07:52] for the seals are not a teaching the
[2:07:54] seals are not a doctrine the seal is the
[2:07:56] uncovering of satan's attempted
[2:07:58] destruction and the revealing of the
[2:08:00] mighty conqueror who's in our midst
[2:08:03] that's what the seven seal is it brings
[2:08:06] him down to earth in perfection
[2:08:09] in bright form
[2:08:12] if i can put it this way it's now jesus
[2:08:15] walking in shoe leather with a lunch box
[2:08:18] to your job
[2:08:22] the seventh seal
[2:08:24] brother adam preached the seventh seal
[2:08:26] to the infidel with the apple tree
