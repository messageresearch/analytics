[0:00] It don't matter situations going on,
[0:02] their job. You know, sometimes the only
[0:03] time you hear or see from people is when
[0:06] their life is turned upside down. AND
[0:08] THE ONLY TIME THEY WANT PRAYER, the only
[0:10] TIME THEY WANT GOD IS WHEN THEY WANT GOD
[0:13] TO REPAIR the mess.
[0:15] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME? NOW, I BELIEVE IN
[0:17] REACHING OUT TO LIVES AND HEARTS, BUT I
[0:19] I ALSO WANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT FRIENDS,
[0:21] GOD IS MORE THAN JUST SITTING AROUND AND
[0:24] JUST SIMPLY WANTING TO PATCH THINGS up
[0:26] and then send US ON BACK. GOD WANTS US
[0:28] TO SERVE HIM, but to think his love is
[0:31] so great that he would answer prayer and
[0:35] do things even for people that won't
[0:38] serve him.
[0:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:41] &gt;&gt; They want to be healed.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; They want his blessings, but they don't
[0:45] want him.
[0:47] &gt;&gt; And yet, God would even pour out OF HIS
[0:50] BLESSINGS. GOD WOULD EVEN GIVE TO THEM
[0:52] EVEN UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCRIPTURE AND
[0:55] GIVE THEM UNDERSTANDING. BUT THEY don't
[0:57] want him
[0:59] &gt;&gt; because they don't want him to be in
[1:01] control of their life.
[1:03] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:04] &gt;&gt; They don't want him.
[1:05] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:06] &gt;&gt; But who wouldn't want this love?
[1:08] &gt;&gt; Who wouldn't who wouldn't want this?
[1:09] This is not about dos and don'ts. It's
[1:12] about God's divine love being revealed
[1:15] to us. But I I got confidence in this
[1:17] way. If they can ever see it in that
[1:19] right light, they'll realize that God's
[1:21] more than a handme-
[1:23] God's more than a bread line. God's more
[1:25] than that. They'll recognize that who he
[1:27] is. HE IS THE DEPARTER and deliverer of
[1:30] their sins. He's more THAN A PATCHWORK
[1:32] QUILT. HE WILL TOTALLY TAKE YOUR LIFE
[1:34] AND ABSOLUTELY CHANGE IT AND PUT A POWER
[1:38] ON THE INSIDE THAT'LL RAISE THAT LIFE UP
[1:41] from a life that's lived down here in
[1:42] sin. That is the power when the reality
[1:45] of Jesus Christ can strike A HEART. YOU
[1:48] SEE, THIS IS WHY THAT EVEN SOMETIMES
[1:50] WITH PEOPLE WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE
[1:51] MESSAGE, all they see is dos and don'ts.
[1:55] All they see is, well, I can do this and
[1:57] we better NOT DO THIS. YOU'RE NOT SEEING
[1:58] THE PICTURE. AND I REALIZE THAT JUST
[2:01] SAYING THAT DOESN'T GET YOU TO SEE IT.
[2:03] BUT TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE TO SEE
[2:05] GOD AND HE'S THE ONE THAT WILL CLEAN UP
[2:08] YOUR LIFE. THE VERY GOD THAT CAME DOWN
[2:12] AND BECAME ONE OF US WITH THAT SAME
[2:14] BLOOD THAT WAS SHED IN ORDER TO TAKE
[2:16] CARE OF YOUR SIN DEBT. HE DON'T LOVE YOU
[2:19] ANYMORE TONIGHT THAN THAN HE DID BACK
[2:21] THEN. HIS LOVE IS THE SAME. BUT WHAT IT
[2:24] HAS TO DO IS COME TO THAT PART THAT HIS
[2:27] LOVE PERMEATES BEYOND EVERY BIT OF our
[2:30] reasoning,
[2:31] &gt;&gt; our imagination,
[2:33] &gt;&gt; our thoughts about it
[2:35] &gt;&gt; and receive his thoughts.
[2:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39] Lord
[2:39] &gt;&gt; because it's not dos and don'ts.
[2:42] &gt;&gt; It's m you've missed it. It's not I
[2:44] don't care how how it's been
[2:46] represented. It's not dos and don'ts.
[2:48] It's Christ.
[2:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50] &gt;&gt; It's a love of God being revealed
[2:53] &gt;&gt; to our lives.
[2:54] &gt;&gt; So this is God's desire within our
[2:58] hearts is that Paul would would speak
[3:00] this to be rooted and grounded in love.
[3:05] that there would be such a a confidence
[3:08] &gt;&gt; that would be had within our life.
[3:12] &gt;&gt; Does God mind questions? Not at all.
[3:15] &gt;&gt; God don't mind questions.
[3:18] God don't mind at times that where when
[3:19] we would come to him, Lord, I I don't
[3:22] understand this, Lord. I I don't see. He
[3:24] doesn't mind questions. He doesn't mind
[3:26] us even looking and coming to him and
[3:28] saying, Lord, would you help me? Help me
[3:30] to see
[3:32] &gt;&gt; how I need to see it.
[3:34] Lord, would you would you make yourself
[3:36] real to me? As a matter of fact, that's
[3:37] very complimentary of him because it
[3:39] shows there's an element of faith that's
[3:41] really starting to work. If we can even
[3:44] ask him and have a confidence that when
[3:47] we ask him, I know many times we say
[3:49] there's no such thing as a dumb
[3:50] question. But let's just be honest.
[3:52] Sometimes with questions we've had, we
[3:54] felt pretty dumb in asking them.
[3:56] &gt;&gt; Is that right? And sometimes we've just
[3:58] pulled back from it. But let me tell
[4:00] you, in the presence OF GOD, BEFORE GOD,
[4:02] YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL DUMB. You don't
[4:04] have to FEEL PUT OUT. ASK GOD. YOU KNOW,
[4:06] IT'S JUST SIMPLE IN THIS WAY of a person
[4:08] that could even hear this AND SAY,
[4:10] "LORD, HELP ME TO SEE IT IN THE RIGHT
[4:12] WAY. HELP ME THAT I'm not seeing you as
[4:15] a lawgiver, but I can see you as the
[4:18] fulfillment of the law and the
[4:20] RIGHTEOUSNESS THAT IN MY LIFE THAT
[4:22] THAT'S WHAT YOU DESIRE TO BE IS THE
[4:24] ATONEMENT in my life."
[4:28] God desires to make himself so real cuz
[4:31] what what does it do? It has an effect a
[4:33] governing effect upon our lives.
[4:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To know to perceive the love
[4:43] of Christ which passes knowledge. So
[4:47] it's not something that we we can
[4:49] explain. You cannot explain it. But it
[4:52] is something that is so real
[4:54] &gt;&gt; that is right there in the midst of our
[4:57] life. You say, "How do you know?" Well,
[5:00] you watch. You watch how the way that
[5:02] you live.
[5:04] &gt;&gt; Watch how your life is conducted. You
[5:06] know, like brother Rab says, who's on
[5:08] the control tower of your heart by the
[5:09] desires that's in your heart.
[5:12] &gt;&gt; So when we look at this this faith,
[5:15] God's desire to bring confidence within
[5:18] our hearts as believers. So perfect
[5:21] faith and this is a familiar statement.
[5:23] Perfect faith is a master of all
[5:27] circumstances. Brother Brandon would say
[5:29] it it masters no matter what it is,
[5:32] it'll master it. It'll when you believe
[5:35] anything, do anything, you got faith in
[5:37] what you're doing. And no matter what
[5:38] the circumstance is, that don't have one
[5:41] thing to do with it. It masters that
[5:43] circumstance. A room full of sickness
[5:46] and the Lord's revealed that a certain
[5:47] thing is going to happen, you just speak
[5:48] it and go home. Don't you don't ask any
[5:51] questions. It's all right. You just keep
[5:52] going. It masters all circumstances if
[5:55] you do this and so and so's going to do
[5:57] that. It's already got it mastered.
[6:00] Faith believes that God will work it
[6:04] out.
[6:05] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW HOW HE'S GOING TO DO IT,
[6:08] BUT HE'LL DO IT ANYHOW. It masters all
[6:12] circumstances.
[6:14] &gt;&gt; And faith and love is relation. Because
[6:18] you can't have faith unless you got
[6:21] love. Because your faith is in a God who
[6:24] is the very essence of love. And faith
[6:27] and love works together. That's what the
[6:30] Bible tells us. Faith workketh by love.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; And so, as we were looking at that LAST
[6:36] WEEK, YOU CAN'T HAVE the the right kind
[6:39] of faith without the divine love of God.
[6:42] &gt;&gt; Could a person have faith to move
[6:43] mountains? Yes. But that's not the faith
[6:46] that God's that God's speaking of. The
[6:48] faith this faith that is can only be
[6:51] produced by that of of the love of God
[6:54] dwelling in our life that it governs
[6:56] every circumstance. Now I read a few
[6:58] statements in there that were even
[7:00] before where brother Ram says you walk
[7:02] into a room of sickness and the Lord
[7:04] reveals this and reveals this and this
[7:06] be over here and this be over here. But
[7:08] I want you to remember, I'm not I didn't
[7:09] put the quote in here, but brother Ram
[7:11] goes into the same message, perfect
[7:12] faith, and he says, "Now," he says, "now
[7:15] these things have taken place by a
[7:17] vision from an angel of the Lord." And
[7:19] then he takes his Bible and he holds it
[7:22] up and he says, "But this right here,"
[7:24] he says, is greater than ANY VISION
[7:27] BECAUSE THIS IS THE WORD OF GOD. AND HE
[7:29] SAYS, "THIS IS WHAT GOD WANTS YOU and I
[7:32] to take from." Remember, I think it was
[7:33] brother Collins asked Brother Brandham
[7:35] the one time, "Brother Brandham, would
[7:36] you pray and ask God to let me see a
[7:39] vision?" HE SAID, "BROTHER, LET ME TELL
[7:40] YOU, EVERY time that you open the Bible,
[7:44] you see a vision."
[7:45] &gt;&gt; SO, SO WHAT IS IT THAT IT WAS COMING
[7:48] BACK TO IS GOD WOULD lead us by his
[7:51] word. So, that there's THERE'S THINGS
[7:53] THAT COME UP WITHIN our life that we're
[7:56] not always going to see things and so
[7:58] and so had a dream and this and that. Of
[7:59] course, it all to BE PROVEN OUT. BUT YOU
[8:02] KNOW, THERE'S THINGS WITHIN OUR LIFE
[8:03] THAT AS SITUATIONS ARISE THAT FAITH BY
[8:07] the divine love of God will actually
[8:09] bring confidence to actually take a HOLD
[8:13] AND SAY, "I don't know how God's going
[8:14] to do this, but I know God's going to
[8:16] work it out. THERE'S NO DOUBT. I'VE GOT
[8:18] things right now that I know that the
[8:20] Lord has spoke TO MY HEART. I DON'T KNOW
[8:22] HOW HE'S GOING TO WORK IT OUT. MATTER OF
[8:23] FACT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. I
[8:26] DON'T SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. BUT THERE
[8:27] ARE PROMISES THAT I AM HANGING ON TO
[8:30] TONIGHT. AND LET ME JUST TELL YOU ABOUT
[8:32] THE HANGING ON TO THEM THAT NO MATTER
[8:34] EVEN WHEN I COULD FIND MYSELF OF
[8:37] REASONING WANTING TO MAYBE SAY BUT BUT
[8:39] THERE IS SOMETHING THAT WILL NOT ALLOW
[8:42] that to take place. I I don't know,
[8:44] maybe I'm I don't think I'm odd or
[8:46] strange, but I find myself just sitting
[8:48] around and my wife and I would talk
[8:50] about different things and and looking
[8:52] at that and I thought, my lord, of how
[8:54] there is something it cannot be
[8:56] overthrown within our hearts, OUR LIVES.
[8:59] I DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S going to look.
[9:00] THERE'S THINGS I'M PRAYING ABOUT. I
[9:02] DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO BE, BUT I
[9:04] KNOW THAT GOD IS GOING TO WORK it all
[9:06] the way out.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; You see, it's when we would know
[9:09] everything, then that's longer faith.
[9:12] BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW, THEN IT NO LONGER
[9:14] FAITH. BUT FAITH IS that evidence and is
[9:17] a substance of things not seen. Yet it's
[9:21] seen in the terms of that God has made
[9:24] himself known or revealed himself to you
[9:27] in regards to a situation. But love will
[9:31] actually create that confidence to move
[9:33] forward in that life. So watch how that
[9:37] when you know this love and faith and it
[9:40] doesn't matter how circumstances come
[9:42] you know brother random he would talk
[9:44] about even a young couple he says you
[9:46] know you take a young man and a young
[9:48] ladies and you put them you know far
[9:50] apart but their hearts begin to meet as
[9:53] beat as one and yet they're not husband
[9:55] and wife BUT THEIR LOVE BINDS them
[9:57] together and they have confidence in one
[9:59] another and he says and if you really
[10:01] love one another you know that this girl
[10:03] loves you and she knows that you love
[10:05] her. YOU'VE GOT CONFIDENCE OR A FAITH in
[10:07] one another if you got faith in one
[10:10] another. And if you don't, he said, "You
[10:11] better not marry her." And then he says,
[10:13] "NOW YOU'VE GOT TO have faith and you'll
[10:16] separate them," talking about that man
[10:18] and woman, "and put one extreme south
[10:20] and one extreme north. They're still
[10:23] that love beats for one another." No
[10:26] matter where they're at, they're just as
[10:28] true to one another as they can be
[10:30] because they love one another. And if
[10:33] you love the Lord, not just TRYING TO
[10:35] DODGE HELL, BUT if you love the Lord,
[10:38] THEN YOU CAN HAVE FAITH IN GOD. SEE, if
[10:41] you love him. So, we're not we're not
[10:44] this is not about dodging hell. If if
[10:47] IT'S ABOUT DODGING HELL, THEN THE
[10:49] PERSON'S very unstable already in their
[10:51] walk.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible said a
[10:53] double-minded man,
[10:54] &gt;&gt; right,
[10:55] &gt;&gt; unstable in all HIS WAYS.
[10:57] &gt;&gt; IN ALL his ways.
[11:00] I always think of the story brother Tim
[11:02] Puit told when he was here
[11:05] and he talked about how that man
[11:08] ran out of gas on a country road and he
[11:11] saw this light up in his house up there.
[11:15] Well, I better go on up there. I ran out
[11:17] of gas. He he started walking AND THE
[11:20] MORE HE STARTED WALKING FINALLY he said
[11:22] them people don't know me from nothing.
[11:25] They're going when I get up there,
[11:26] they're probably going to think, "Who's
[11:28] this crazy man coming off the road like
[11:30] like he wants gas? He probably wants
[11:32] something else. He's probably here to,
[11:34] you know, to do us harm. HE'LL PROBABLY"
[11:36] AND HE KEPT ON ENTERTAINING THEM
[11:38] THOUGHTS AND THINKING ABOUT IT THE WHOLE
[11:40] TIME. AND FINALLY, you know, you'd have
[11:42] to just imagine Brother Tim telling it.
[11:44] And brother Tim, you know, standing
[11:45] right here and he said, "Finally," he
[11:47] said, he said, "the man got up to the
[11:48] door, you know, and all this still going
[11:50] on. He rang the doorbell or knocked on
[11:52] the door. And when they open the OPENED
[11:54] THE DOOR, HE SAID, "GUESS, KEEP YOUR OLD
[11:56] GAS. I DON'T WANT IT ANYHOW."
[12:00] HE TALKED HIMSELF OUT OF THE HELP THAT
[12:05] WAS THERE FOR HIM.
[12:10] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS HELP FOR HIM. BUT IT SHOWS A
[12:12] DOUBLE-MINDED MAN IS UNSTABLE IN ALL HIS
[12:15] WAYS. GOD DOESN'T WANT US TO BE
[12:18] UNSTABLE. GOD COMES TO MAKE HIS WORD SO
[12:22] REAL THAT WE CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE IN HIM.
[12:27] &gt;&gt; NOT IN YOURSELF, IN HIM.
[12:33] &gt;&gt; MY NOT JUST TRYING TO DODGE HELL, but if
[12:36] you love the Lord, then you have faith
[12:38] in God if you love him. NOW, NOTICE THE
[12:41] FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT, THE VERY THE VERY
[12:45] FIRST PRODUCT is love. Right?
[12:48] &gt;&gt; If you notice how really how three of
[12:50] these are within there, it's inward,
[12:52] outward, and then character. Love, joy,
[12:55] peace, longsuffering, gentleness,
[12:57] goodness, faith. But that love, but the
[13:00] fruit is love. There's there's a love.
[13:03] Now, Brother Brandon would take an
[13:05] example in perfect faith. He picks it up
[13:08] also in uh standing in the gap. They're
[13:12] just some weeks apart. And he talks
[13:14] about the relationship because that's
[13:17] what faith and love is. It's husbands
[13:18] and husband and wife. And he's talking
[13:21] about this this of a of a young lady
[13:25] that was there in Louisville. And I just
[13:27] want to read this to you. And he says,
[13:29] you know, she'd been a qu Christian for
[13:32] many years, but her husband, they had
[13:34] just, you know, she had just fallen in
[13:36] love with this man. He had been a
[13:37] Christian a couple years. And so they
[13:39] got married and they loved and had
[13:41] confidence in one another and got
[13:43] married. And so the woman said to the
[13:45] man, "Hubby, it must be hard on you.
[13:47] You're just a young Christian. You've
[13:49] had so much to go through. Drinking is
[13:51] what it was. You've had so much to go
[13:53] through with. I know you're bound to be
[13:56] tempted awfully hard." So I want you to
[13:58] know one thing. If you happen to fall,
[14:00] if you happen to fall into temptation
[14:03] and is overcome, don't stay away from
[14:05] home. You come on back. You come right
[14:09] here because I'm going to be right here
[14:11] waiting for you. I'M GOING TO HELP YOU
[14:13] PRAY through again until you get
[14:16] victory. I'M GOING TO STAY WITH YOU
[14:18] BECAUSE WHEN I MARRIED YOU, I married
[14:21] you because I loved you. AND NO MATTER
[14:24] WHAT YOU ARE, I STILL LOVE YOU.
[14:31] I there's a lot that that I could speak
[14:33] and preach from within there, but I
[14:35] think of what an expression AND THAT WAS
[14:38] FELIO LOVE,
[14:39] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[14:40] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT AN EXPRESSION THAT AS SHE'S
[14:43] SAYING, I DIDN'T I didn't I didn't marry
[14:45] you BASED ON HOW GOOD YOU WERE.
[14:47] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[14:48] &gt;&gt; THE MARRIAGE WAS BASED ON LOVE.
[14:53] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[14:55] &gt;&gt; This is WHAT THIS IS WHAT IT WAS ALL
[14:57] ABOUT. AND IF YOU IF YOU HAPPEN YOU
[14:59] COULD BE TEMPTED and we we know that
[15:01] temptation's not sin heeding it is but
[15:04] to understand that within this of of of
[15:07] of the temptation and things coming. I I
[15:10] think that the one point IN HERE IS
[15:13] DON'T STAY AWAY FROM HOME. LOOK WHAT THE
[15:15] LOVE OF GOD CALLED OUT. THE LOVE OF GOD
[15:19] YOU KNOW WAS SOMETHING THAT CALLED OUT
[15:20] AND SAID NO MATTER IF YOU FAIL COME ON
[15:24] BACK HOME. WHY? THERE'S SOMEBODY WHO
[15:28] LOVES YOU AT HOME.
[15:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[15:31] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT THE REVEALING OF CHRIST
[15:33] IS TO BE IN OUR HEARTS, IN OUR ASSEMBLY.
[15:36] COME ON BACK. YOU MIGHT SAY, "WELL, THIS
[15:38] ONE'S FALLEN AND THIS ONE'S FALLEN." I
[15:40] DON'T CARE IF THEY FELL ON THEIR FACE 70
[15:42] TIMES. GET UP. THERE'S A 71ST TIME.
[15:47] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME, FRIENDS? AMEN.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES WE LOOK AT THINGS AND YOU WANT
[15:52] TO DEFINE THIS AND DEFINE THAT AND
[15:54] DEFINE THAT AND WE FORGET HOW GOD HAS
[15:57] BROUGHT US ALONG.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[16:00] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME?
[16:01] &gt;&gt; I KNOW GOD MAY NOT HAVE HAD TO BRING US
[16:03] ALONG AND HE was 53 TIMES PICKING US UP.
[16:06] BUT GOD MIGHT HAVE FILLED US, CONVERTED
[16:08] US, AND THEN HE HAD TO BRING US TO THE
[16:10] PLACE TO SAY, "HEY, I want to use your
[16:12] temple.
[16:13] &gt;&gt; Do you mind loaning it to me?
[16:16] &gt;&gt; Do you mind if I could use it? Do you
[16:18] mind if I use it?" and you're not so
[16:19] wrapped up in this. SEE, SOMETIMES IT'S
[16:21] DIFFERENT OF HOW THAT GOD HAS TO work
[16:24] and deal and GET A PERSON'S ATTENTION.
[16:26] BUT, YOU KNOW, GOD GOD HAS A WAY. AND
[16:28] THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART,
[16:30] IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW LONG, WELL, WELL,
[16:32] THIS PERSON WENT ASTRAY, YOU KNOW, 10 10
[16:34] years and and you know, they've been up
[16:36] and down and UP AND DOWN. BUT THERE IS
[16:38] THE SAME GRACE THAT BROUGHT STABILITY TO
[16:41] YOUR LIFE.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME, FRIENDS? IT WASN'T
[16:45] YOUR GOODNESS. IT WASN'T HOW LONG YOU
[16:46] SAT IN THE MESSAGE, CHURCH. OH, I WAS
[16:48] UNDER THE RIGHT MINISTRY. IT'S BECAUSE
[16:50] THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST THROUGH
[16:53] THE WORD STABILIZED YOU WITH A
[16:56] CONFIDENCE TO SEE WHAT HE'S DONE FOR YOU
[16:59] AND YOU BELIEVED it
[17:01] &gt;&gt; and IT HAD AN EFFECT ON YOUR LIFE.
[17:04] &gt;&gt; IT REMOVED IT REMOVED A SLAVE LIKE
[17:07] MENTALITY.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[17:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Sam, you believe that? Yeah, I
[17:14] believe that. There's examples setting
[17:15] all around this church.
[17:17] Absolutely. I believe that that God's
[17:19] GRACE IS GREATER. BUT NOTICE THIS MAN,
[17:23] this is what was expressed by his wife.
[17:26] If you Oh, come on back.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; Now, of course, there's a way to come
[17:31] back.
[17:33] &gt;&gt; I won't deal with that, but there's a
[17:34] way. I won't deal with that tonight, but
[17:36] there's a way to come back,
[17:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[17:39] &gt;&gt; I mean, you you you want to come back
[17:41] the right way so you can get what you
[17:43] need to get.
[17:44] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[17:46] Now you see within it you know that's
[17:49] why you don't just come back and say
[17:51] well you know I just had an old weakness
[17:52] of the flesh and you know we just now
[17:54] that's not the right that's not
[17:55] repentance
[17:57] &gt;&gt; repentance is the way back
[18:00] &gt;&gt; and repentance is more than I'm sorry
[18:04] it's a sorrowful heart
[18:06] &gt;&gt; that will lead to a humble life
[18:11] &gt;&gt; in all things
[18:13] &gt;&gt; now this man's response. This is what I
[18:16] want you to watch. What here? A few days
[18:18] after it, he was eating his lunch with
[18:21] fellows down in the boiler room and he
[18:23] was telling them, "How could a man do
[18:26] anything wrong when somebody loves you
[18:28] like that?"
[18:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, wow.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; How could you do anything wrong when
[18:31] somebody loves you like that? Brother
[18:34] Bram says, "There you are. How could you
[18:36] trespass
[18:38] that confidence?" Amen.
[18:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says you multiply that by a
[18:42] billion and then you'll get some idea
[18:44] what the love of God is. When you could
[18:47] think of what he did for you in the
[18:48] light of the scripture, not some
[18:49] emotion, but in the light of facts, then
[18:51] there's something happens in you. The
[18:53] new birth comes and he says, when we
[18:56] were sinners, now let's just just think
[18:57] of this. When we were sinners,
[19:01] alienated without God, it doesn't matter
[19:03] if you were in a message church or
[19:05] outside of a message church, we were all
[19:07] born sinners,
[19:08] &gt;&gt; right? Doesn't matter if you had all the
[19:10] taxs in a row on the Sunday school
[19:12] chart. You were a sinner.
[19:15] &gt;&gt; Didn't matter if you could finish quotes
[19:16] or brother Brandham. I could. Didn't
[19:18] matter. I was still a sinner. I needed a
[19:22] conversion.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? A change of nature. So
[19:26] when we were sinners, alienated without
[19:28] God in the world in that muck of mud, as
[19:31] I talked ABOUT THIS MORNING, GOD COME TO
[19:34] US. THINK ABOUT THAT. YOU DIDN'T FIND
[19:38] GOD,
[19:39] &gt;&gt; GOD FOUND YOU.
[19:41] &gt;&gt; I KNOW THIS IS SIMPLE. IT'S A THEME ALL
[19:43] THE WAY THROUGH. BUT IT'S THE VERY VERY
[19:46] PART OF UNDERSTANDING GOD'S LOVE THAT IT
[19:49] WAS NOT YOU THAT FOUND GOD. GOD CAME
[19:53] DOWN WHERE YOU WERE. GOD CAME DOWN AND
[19:56] ADORNED HIMSELF IN HUMILIATION
[19:59] &gt;&gt; BY BECOMING ONE OF US.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; WHY DID HE DO THAT? HIS LOVE FOR US.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN. DON'T JUST LEAVE HIS LOVE FOR
[20:07] THERE AT CALVARY. THERE IS THE ULTIMATE
[20:09] OF THAT. BUT for him to even come down
[20:11] and adorn a garment of humiliation that
[20:14] he would experience
[20:17] what it is to have a headache.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; I know it's simple except when we got
[20:21] one. that he would experience
[20:24] frustrations
[20:26] &gt;&gt; and to know what it was to be frustrated
[20:31] &gt;&gt; and then be able to empty that out so
[20:34] that would not become the motivator of
[20:37] why he was or was not doing something.
[20:40] He experienced tempted in all points
[20:44] such as we are. Why did he do that? That
[20:47] he might understand us. Because see,
[20:49] after Calvary, he would ascend right
[20:51] back up and send back the Holy Ghost
[20:53] that he might be a faithful and merciful
[20:56] high priest and the right kind of a
[20:58] mediator. So when you and I would go to
[21:00] him and say, "Lord, I'm tempted in this
[21:02] awful bad. Lord, the feeling I've got a
[21:05] feeling like this, maybe it's this wrong
[21:07] feeling against a brother, against a
[21:08] sister, or there's Lord this in the
[21:10] home. Lord God, help me, Lord.
[21:13] &gt;&gt; I need your strength, Lord. I because
[21:15] you know what? He knows how it feels. HE
[21:18] UNDERSTANDS TEMPTATION. HE UNDERSTANDS
[21:21] HOW IT FEELS. HE UNDERSTANDS HOW IT
[21:23] FEELS TO BE MISUNDERSTOOD. HE
[21:26] UNDERSTANDS HOW IT FEELS TO BE REJECTED.
[21:28] HE UNDERSTANDS HOW IT FEELS TO BE
[21:30] DESPISED. HE UNDERSTANDS.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; He understands what it is to be tempted.
[21:37] He understands what it is to turn his
[21:39] head. He understands, as the prophet
[21:41] said, he was tempted with drinking. He
[21:44] was TEMPTED WITH WOMEN. HE EVEN
[21:45] UNDERSTANDS WHAT IT'S LIKE for pride to
[21:48] want to come and take a hold and to
[21:50] display yourself before your brethren.
[21:52] Cast yourself down OFF OF THIS TEMPLE.
[21:54] HE UNDERSTANDS THAT. He allowed himself
[21:58] to be subjected
[22:01] &gt;&gt; in the humiliation
[22:03] &gt;&gt; of the likeness of sinful flesh
[22:06] &gt;&gt; that he might understand you and I.
[22:09] So when we would sit down in the living
[22:12] room of God's revealed word and begin to
[22:15] speak to him, he does not take it a
[22:18] threat when we say, "Lord, help me.
[22:21] Lord, I'm tempted." He doesn't say, "How
[22:24] could you be? How could this?" No, he
[22:27] doesn't. He's right there to minister
[22:30] to us what we have need of.
[22:33] &gt;&gt; You know what that does every time? You
[22:34] know what that does? It builds
[22:36] confidence. Amen.
[22:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:37] &gt;&gt; It builds confidence in our life.
[22:42] God sought you. You never sought God. No
[22:46] man can come to me except the father
[22:48] draws him. God came down in that muck
[22:51] what you were and sought you out and
[22:53] brought you out.
[22:55] &gt;&gt; I always think about the woman at the
[22:56] well, too. You know,
[22:58] &gt;&gt; I mean, he came right where she was.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; He didn't tell her, "If you want me to
[23:02] touch your life, come on down to the
[23:04] synagogue. Make sure you put on disguise
[23:06] because I don't want nobody know that
[23:08] who I'm affiliating with.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; He knew what was beneath that darkness.
[23:13] &gt;&gt; He w He wasn't ashamed.
[23:15] Hallelujah. Oh, he wasn't he wasn't
[23:18] petting her sin, but he wasn't ashamed
[23:20] of that daughter of God down on THE
[23:21] INSIDE. ALL SHE NEEDED WAS A LITTLE BIT
[23:24] OF attention in the presence of God.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Ain't that what
[23:30] happened to you and I? It was a little
[23:32] bit of attention in the presence OF
[23:34] ALMIGHTY GOD.
[23:36] &gt;&gt; GLORY BE TO GOD. YOU SAY, "BROTHER
[23:38] SAMUEL, WHY DID HE GO DOWN INTO HER LIFE
[23:40] AND SAY, YOU KNOW, AND AND she comes
[23:42] forth and says about her husband and the
[23:44] one THAT SHE'S LIVING WITH, THAT WAS ALL
[23:46] TO GET AWAY ALL PRETENSE, TO GET AWAY
[23:50] ALL THE CONFESSION, TO GET RIGHT DOWN TO
[23:53] WHERE IT NEEDED TO BE." GOD LEADS US
[23:56] INTO THE PLACE THE BIBLE SAID, "THE
[23:58] GOODNESS OF GOD LEADS US TO REPENTANCE."
[24:01] IT'S WHY SO THAT GOD THEN CAN BEGIN TO
[24:04] MOVE DOWN and work within our life.
[24:06] There was nothing that was hidden
[24:09] &gt;&gt; from him.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; She knew it and her life was open before
[24:13] him.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; So good.
[24:21] &gt;&gt; Back that last quote that
[24:25] ought to create a perfect love. What
[24:28] should that he came down in the muck you
[24:30] were in? Oh, it may not have been
[24:31] prostitution. It may not have been like
[24:33] the woman at the well, but every one of
[24:35] us where we were at in our situation, in
[24:37] our needs, in our sin, it might have
[24:40] been right down in your reasoning. It
[24:42] might have been right in your mind all
[24:43] twisted around, but God came right down
[24:46] to where you were.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; He sought you out. He sought me out.
[24:52] That ought to create a perfect love.
[24:55] Look what you was and LOOK WHAT YOU ARE.
[24:58] WHAT DID THAT? CAN I JUST PAUSE HERE A
[25:00] MOMENT? Look what you were. Oh, brother
[25:03] Samuel, I I I I'm not what I OUGHT TO
[25:06] BE. I'M ASKING YOU, LOOK WHAT YOU WERE
[25:10] &gt;&gt; AND LOOK WHAT YOU ARE NOW.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; QUIT LOOKING WAY ON DOWN THE ROAD.
[25:18] RECOGNIZE THAT THE GOD WHO CAME TO SEEK
[25:21] YOU OUT, HE'S ALREADY STARTED A CHANGE
[25:24] IN YOUR LIFE.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND YOU'LL NOT GET ANY
[25:28] FURTHER WITHOUT RECOGNIZING THAT GOD HAS
[25:32] EVEN BEGUN THAT CHANGE IN YOUR LIFE.
[25:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[25:39] &gt;&gt; Somebody that loves you. Can't you have
[25:40] faith in what he's promised you and real
[25:43] love will create a confidence in his
[25:45] word.
[25:46] &gt;&gt; He caught me when I was nothing. I'm
[25:48] still nothing but I'm in his hand. HE
[25:50] CAUGHT ME AND HE LOVED ME WHEN I was
[25:52] unlovable. He loved you when you was
[25:54] unlovable, but he changed you. And just
[25:57] like THE COLORED SISTER SAID THAT TIME
[25:58] IN her testimony, "I'm not what I ought
[26:01] to be, NOT WHAT I WANT TO BE, THEN I'm
[26:03] not, but then I'm not what I used to
[26:06] be."
[26:07] &gt;&gt; She knowed she had come somewhere.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; Something
[26:11] &gt;&gt; had happened.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; And then the prophet picks it up and
[26:16] says, "Won't your love reach back to
[26:19] him?"
[26:20] &gt;&gt; And there's a love affair.
[26:23] No matter what the situation is,
[26:26] its circumstances
[26:28] is governed by this love that creates
[26:30] faith. That God loves you and you love
[26:33] God and you love one another and that
[26:36] brings the faith.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; Then it can't keep from bringing out
[26:40] just exactly what God promised it would
[26:43] do.
[26:45] See this dwelling in our lives
[26:50] and that reality it brings then the
[26:52] confidence in the promises of God. The
[26:56] confidence to even to press on
[27:00] &gt;&gt; confidence that
[27:02] &gt;&gt; be honest. We all have loved ones we're
[27:04] praying for.
[27:06] &gt;&gt; We'll have different ones that we've got
[27:07] on our hearts. You got children,
[27:09] &gt;&gt; have a spouse.
[27:12] But see this right here to see what God
[27:16] has done for you and how he sought you
[27:18] out.
[27:19] &gt;&gt; I know sometimes it it you know
[27:21] sometimes it maybe could help us if we
[27:22] see a little glimmer, but I'm going to
[27:24] tell you faith itself doesn't need a
[27:27] glimmer.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; No,
[27:28] &gt;&gt; it might look like things are going the
[27:30] opposite way. That's right.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; It might seem like the more you pray
[27:33] that things are getting worse.
[27:34] &gt;&gt; Good preacher.
[27:35] &gt;&gt; But don't stop praying.
[27:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[27:39] Because let me tell you, the same thing
[27:41] that turned your heart around and your
[27:43] life around is the same thing that'll
[27:45] turn your children's heart.
[27:47] &gt;&gt; It's the same thing that'll turn your
[27:49] spouse's heart.
[27:50] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[27:52] &gt;&gt; You have the same kind of confidence for
[27:54] what God has done in your life. Just
[27:56] like even when it comes to sickness and
[27:58] things. Oh, I mean my, you know, we
[28:00] would all love to have where something
[28:01] would come forth as a vision and my I
[28:04] would love to be able to see this and I
[28:06] would love to be able to know this.
[28:07] somebody speak a word over me and I
[28:09] would we we would there's many of those
[28:11] things that we could say I would like to
[28:14] do that or I would like to have where I
[28:16] don't have to go through that surgery or
[28:18] I have to go through this man I would
[28:20] love for it to happen this way but
[28:21] sometimes it beg it begs the question
[28:23] why would we love for it to happen that
[28:25] way
[28:27] is that about God or about us
[28:30] &gt;&gt; and what I mean is it's not just about
[28:32] pride but it's also something about is
[28:34] it about I don't feel like going through
[28:37] that. I don't want to go through that. I
[28:39] mean, nobody nobody I don't think
[28:40] anybody does. I don't I don't think
[28:42] anybody ever said, "Hey, I really want
[28:44] to go through a surgery. If they do,
[28:45] they need their brain baptized
[28:47] &gt;&gt; because nobody wants to go through that,
[28:50] right?" But, you know, there's things
[28:51] about that even in the human element and
[28:53] all those things that we say, "God, help
[28:55] me, Lord. I I need I need I need your
[28:58] strength. I I need Lord, what is it that
[29:00] you would have me to do?" And you're
[29:01] praying about it. You're looking to the
[29:03] Lord. And here you are. You just
[29:04] continue on in your walk with God. And
[29:07] daily you're walking with God. You're
[29:09] you're continuing. Here you are staying
[29:11] right in the presence of God. And
[29:12] through it all, you don't have maybe a
[29:14] direct answer. You go ahead and set the
[29:16] date for that surgery and how
[29:18] everything's going along. What what is
[29:19] absolutely taking place,
[29:22] faith
[29:23] &gt;&gt; is mastering
[29:25] &gt;&gt; the circumstances of life.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; So that you don't walk paralyzed. Oh, I
[29:30] just need a word from the Lord. If God
[29:32] would just give me a vision. If God
[29:34] would just give me this, if God would
[29:35] just do me this, if God would just
[29:37] Brother God didn't even do that for
[29:38] brother Brandham.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; I got a lot of quotes on that. I could
[29:42] read that to you.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; It caused people to think that. But
[29:46] brother Brandham says, "I have to work
[29:48] out and find God's will just like
[29:50] &gt;&gt; you do."
[29:52] &gt;&gt; Right? And he also goes on to say in the
[29:54] revelation series, he said, "Many times
[29:56] we make decisions that we think are the
[29:59] greatest mistake and it turns out that
[30:01] it's right the will of God that's been
[30:03] worked out the whole time."
[30:06] &gt;&gt; Now, don't anybody take that and twist
[30:07] that one now.
[30:10] But notice, let me let me let me let me
[30:12] get to this place here within this.
[30:15] Paul would write and say,
[30:18] &gt;&gt; "Cast not away, therefore, your
[30:19] confidence,
[30:21] &gt;&gt; which hath great recompense of reward.
[30:24] For you have need of patience after
[30:27] you've done the will of God, that you
[30:28] might receive the promise. For yet a
[30:31] little while, and he that he that will
[30:33] come will come, and will not tarry." Now
[30:36] the just shall live by faith, but if any
[30:38] man draw back, my soul shall have no
[30:40] pleasure in him. But we are not of them
[30:43] who draw back unto predition, but of
[30:46] them that believe to the saving of the
[30:49] soul.
[30:51] You know, Satan Satan loves to come and
[30:54] try to break confidence
[30:57] &gt;&gt; in the word of God.
[31:00] There's a quote I want to I want to
[31:01] leave you with. I'm just I don't have it
[31:02] here, but I want to refer refer it refer
[31:05] you to it. In the revelation of Jesus
[31:09] Christ, the prophet tells us how Satan's
[31:11] desire is to break that confidence and
[31:15] to work to destroy
[31:19] all the way until the time he's cast
[31:22] into the lake of fire. And he has many
[31:24] different ways that he can do that. Some
[31:27] of the ways that he'll do that is to try
[31:29] to point out to you, well, I thought
[31:34] you felt it was going to happen like
[31:36] this.
[31:38] Oh, I thought so and so said this would
[31:41] happen and it didn't happen.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; I thought I thought, you know, I I
[31:49] thought God cared about you. I thought
[31:52] he loved you. Remember like he told the
[31:54] prophet, I thought he cared for you and
[31:58] he'll work and he'll try to break
[32:01] confidence
[32:02] within the word of God.
[32:05] I want to just say it in this way that
[32:07] when God
[32:10] through all of the examples, it doesn't
[32:12] matter like the prophet when he spoke
[32:14] about that confidence, he said it didn't
[32:16] matter. He said, "If I prayed for 10,000
[32:19] tonight and every one of them died in
[32:22] the morning," he said, "I'd be right
[32:24] back on the platform
[32:25] &gt;&gt; praying tomorrow night."
[32:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? You know why? Because
[32:30] it's not a life that's lived just based
[32:32] on outcomes.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; It's a life that's lived based on
[32:36] confidence in God's word.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; See, this is where what God come to do
[32:43] is bring our confidence in the word of
[32:45] God. So that no matter what takes place
[32:48] and no matter where we're standing, we
[32:50] have the promise, you'll never be
[32:52] ashamed.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; You'll never be ashamed for standing
[32:57] &gt;&gt; on God's word.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[33:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's stand together.
[33:08] You'll never never be ashamed. Let me
[33:11] read just a just a couple scriptures
[33:13] here.
[33:18] Peter said it's contained in the
[33:19] scriptures. He's pulling from Isaiah.
[33:21] Behold, I lay in Zion a chief
[33:23] cornerstone, elect and precious, and he
[33:25] that believeth on him shall not be
[33:28] confounded or ashamed.
[33:32] Psalms 37, the Lord knoweth the days of
[33:34] the upright, and their inheritance shall
[33:37] be forever. They shall not be ashamed in
[33:41] the evil time,
[33:43] &gt;&gt; right? and in the days of famine they
[33:44] shall be satisfied.
[33:48] Peter said, "If any man suffer as a
[33:50] Christian, let him not be ashamed, but
[33:52] let him glorify God on this behalf."
[33:56] Paul would write, "According to my
[33:58] earnest expectation
[34:00] and my hope, that in nothing I shall be
[34:04] ashamed, but with all boldness, as
[34:07] always, so now also Christ shall be
[34:10] magnified in my body, whether it be by
[34:13] life or by death."
[34:16] As a believer
[34:19] standing on God's word, we can never be
[34:22] ashamed. Right.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; God God sees to that. We're standing on
[34:27] his word, standing in his word. You'll
[34:30] never be confounded.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; You know what that means? That means
[34:35] that even when you don't have an answer,
[34:38] but you're standing right there.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; It wouldn't matter like it was in the
[34:42] days of Noah. They they shot the moon
[34:44] and proved there wasn't any moisture up
[34:45] there. You wouldn't be ashamed.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; Because it's not about what you can
[34:51] explain. That's right. That's right.
[34:53] Come on.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; It's about what you know.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; That love of Christ,
[34:59] &gt;&gt; the love of God in your heart.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't matter how much that they could
[35:03] try to explain it away, it doesn't
[35:05] matter.
[35:08] What about what about what about
[35:09] standing right here someone as we're
[35:12] praying and looking for healing
[35:15] and let's say as we're praying for
[35:18] healing and God takes them on home,
[35:22] they've been healed.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; They've been healed.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; But it just wasn't how we were expecting
[35:31] it.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you this,
[35:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown. I'm standing right there
[35:35] coming right past I went I went right
[35:36] past that area where that black where
[35:38] that black squirrel jumped out. Walked
[35:40] right past that. Traversed right by
[35:42] right right by that as it was going down
[35:44] over to Eagle Rock there in Arizona a
[35:46] year ago. And right where that would
[35:48] have jumped out seen one of them chulo c
[35:51] cactuses right there and how that how
[35:52] that is seen and was able to see that.
[35:54] And now I want you to think when brother
[35:57] Brandham
[35:58] walked off of there wings of a snow
[36:01] white dove is where he tells it. How
[36:03] does he say that? That healing did he
[36:06] say, "Oh, it's going to come a day from
[36:08] now or two days from now."
[36:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; When he had come off of that mountain
[36:13] that was in Arizona, he preaches Wings
[36:16] of a Snow White Dove down in Shreveport.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "It's over.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; It's over.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; I want you to think about it. He never
[36:29] received his healing until he stepped on
[36:32] the other side.
[36:34] But he was healed.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; He was healed.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; You know why? Never be ashamed.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Never be ashamed.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; You think Brother Ram's ashamed over
[36:47] there? No, he wasn't ashamed. When God
[36:49] has made When God has made known his
[36:51] word, you can stand on his word.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, the devil will try to make you feel
[36:55] small. Well, look at it. You're You're
[36:57] claiming your children. Look at the
[36:58] direction they're going. Never be
[37:00] ashamed. God's word is still true.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; Believe on the Lord, and thou in thy
[37:04] house shall be saved. They and their
[37:06] offspring shall be there with them.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Samuel, HOW FOOLISH WOULD I LOOK
[37:10] walking around and quoting the word of
[37:12] God? I wouldn't worry about looking
[37:14] foolish. I would walk around and quote
[37:16] God's word. I would quote that promise.
[37:19] YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS? EVERY TIME YOU
[37:21] COME BACK AND the enemy wants to TRY TO
[37:23] BRING DOUBT, JUST SAY, "STICK AROUND.
[37:25] I'VE GOT A TESTIMONY service for you."
[37:27] BECAUSE WITH ALL THEM SCRIPTURES, GUESS
[37:29] WHAT? I AM A product of somebody that
[37:32] was praying for me. AND WHAT GOD DID FOR
[37:35] ME, HE'S GOING TO DO FOR THEM. Will
[37:37] never be ashamed.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[37:42] &gt;&gt; No matter what the enemy would try to
[37:43] show, our love reaches right back and
[37:46] says, "I don't know how he's GOING TO DO
[37:47] IT. I DON'T KNOW HOW HE'S GOING TO TURN
[37:48] THEM AROUND. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S
[37:50] GOING TO DO TO GET THEIR ATTENTION. I
[37:51] DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S WHAT HE'S GOING TO
[37:52] HAVE TO DO, but I know the same God and
[37:54] what he did for me. He'll do it for my
[37:56] daughter. He'll do it for my son. Do it
[37:58] for my children. He'll do it for THIS
[38:00] LOVED ONE. WHATEVER THAT IT TAKES, LORD,
[38:02] to turn their lives around, you know
[38:04] them, Lord.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; Before you ever gave them to me and I
[38:08] had them, held them in my arms and
[38:10] walked with them AND EVERYTHING ELSE,
[38:11] YOU already knew him, Lord.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; And you see, this is why you can have a
[38:17] confidence cuz you knew it was a
[38:19] supernatural experience that turned your
[38:20] life around.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; It was something that was schooled into
[38:23] you. when somebody somebody taught you
[38:25] or reasoned you into but you just know
[38:28] I'm different.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm not I'm not not what I used to
[38:31] be.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; What did that?
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; The revelation that somebody loves you.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Don't you love him?
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Love produces a confidence, don't
[38:48] it?
[38:50] &gt;&gt; That I don't have to know. It just it
[38:51] governs the circumstance. I don't have
[38:53] to know how this is going to work out,
[38:55] but I just know that God's got it in
[38:57] control.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; I don't know how this is going to take
[38:59] place, but I know God's got it in
[39:01] control. Don't you love him, friends?
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[39:06] &gt;&gt; it's not a shot in the dark. It's
[39:08] reality.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; This is This is faith.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Faith doesn't need to know how.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; Faith says God will do it. Amen. As
[39:17] &gt;&gt; a matter of fact, brother Bam says in
[39:18] the message, look, he said that thought
[39:20] of how is God's business.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; It's not yours.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; It's God's business.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; But just believe his word. Say, "Lord, I
[39:28] believe it.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; I believe it. Lord, let it let it sink
[39:32] down so in my heart
[39:34] &gt;&gt; to where it affects even all of the
[39:35] actions in my life." Let's pray.
