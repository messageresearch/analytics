[34:29] where would we be

[34:33] us
[34:34] and that Grace just becomes more amazing
[34:37] every moment
[34:39] each day of Our Lives
[34:43] you know I like how brother Brown said
[34:44] it and I don't know who the brother was
[34:46] but he said brother Mike
[34:48] he said to think about it God looked all
[34:50] the way down through time
[34:52] and he saw even all of our mistakes and
[34:54] all our failures and everything and yet
[34:56] he chose us
[34:59] because choosing was not based on any
[35:02] human Merit whatsoever
[35:05] we were always let me just say it simple
[35:07] we were always his youngins
[35:10] we were always his children
[35:12] we always belong to him
[35:15] God never came to that Revelation you
[35:17] and I have come to that Revelation a man
[35:21] of who God is and he's our father I'm
[35:23] his child oh my God
[35:26] when that Revelation strikes within our
[35:28] heart there's no devil there's no demon
[35:31] that can stand on any of those grounds
[35:33] any longer because at that moment all
[35:36] the grounds have been restored to that
[35:38] believer personally
[35:40] amen Calvary paid for every Redemptive
[35:42] blessing and so here we are this morning
[35:45] enjoying the Redemptive blessings
[35:48] of calvary
[35:50] amen because of God's Amazing Grace he
[35:53] sent back the Holy Spirit to draw us and
[35:56] bring you and I to life oh what a people
[35:59] full of the joy of the Lord
[36:02] as we said last night
[36:04] brother Brandon said that little fishy
[36:07] if it looked at that water and said I
[36:09] better be careful I might drink up all
[36:11] this water
[36:13] and brother Brandon goes on to say he
[36:15] said he would be more easily done for a
[36:18] little fishy to do that than you could
[36:21] ever do that to God you can never
[36:24] exhaust the inexhaustible Fountain of
[36:27] almighty God I don't care what the need
[36:30] is
[36:31] we might think it's too high ask for big
[36:33] things
[36:35] you might think it's
[36:37] God Specializes even in showing you and
[36:40] I he took a little fishy
[36:43] not a trophy Bass
[36:45] not a trophy bass a little fishy I don't
[36:48] even know what it was maybe it was a
[36:49] panfish a bluegill I don't know it was a
[36:51] little fish
[36:52] but I'm grateful because you know why
[36:55] he still moves on little me
[36:57] he moves on my little needs they don't
[36:59] have to be trophy needs God just shows
[37:02] that I'll take situations where it looks
[37:03] like the whole inside of your life has
[37:06] been ripped out but I'm The God Who
[37:08] restores
[37:09] [Applause]
[37:10] that's what this word does for you and I
[37:12] it's a word of restoration
[37:15] oh my God is moving

[42:02] thankful we are for that nice spiritual
[42:04] lift

[42:07] don't you
[42:09] amen praise the Lord let's stand
[42:11] together this morning
[42:14] man God is sure mindful of us isn't he
[42:19] brother Wayne I didn't pay close enough
[42:22] attention to the
[42:24] to the flyer as I said last night I
[42:26] thought this whole time I was preaching
[42:28] Friday night Saturday night and Sunday
[42:30] morning and yesterday afternoon I
[42:32] realized oh service is Saturday morning
[42:34] and I was expecting to have all day
[42:36] today to study
[42:38] and so uh that didn't happen but thank
[42:40] God and got to preaching last night and
[42:42] the people started pulling I didn't even
[42:43] get to half of my notes from last night
[42:45] so we got a part two this morning so God
[42:49] knows even when we don't but
[42:51] some of you may have heard but brother
[42:53] Roy Shrewsbury passed away yesterday so
[42:56] we want to want to remember his family
[42:58] in prayer 98 years old
[43:00] he preached till he was 95.
[43:04] I thought my I guess us preachers don't
[43:05] get to retire do we
[43:08] 95 he preached to passed away at 98
[43:11] years old so we thank God for his
[43:13] Gallant soul and every effort he put
[43:15] forth for the kingdom of God want to
[43:17] remember his family in prayer this
[43:18] morning and no doubt there's been needs
[43:21] already mentioned and represented but
[43:22] let's just go ahead and go to the Lord
[43:24] and I don't normally do this before we
[43:26] go to the scripture but let's go ahead
[43:28] and just go to the Lord in prayer this
[43:30] morning Heavenly Father Lord we are
[43:32] truly thankful
[43:34] Lord for your word
[43:37] for your promises Lord because we know
[43:40] that Lord every promise is true and
[43:43] we're depending on those this morning
[43:45] we're resting on that and we thank you
[43:47] for every believer gathered here this
[43:49] morning and those that are listening in
[43:51] by way of streaming and Lord we we thank
[43:55] you for your presence that we feel here
[43:57] this morning
[43:59] truly Lord we're blessed to be able to
[44:01] to serve you in spirit and Truth Lord
[44:06] Lord we we just want to thank you for
[44:09] the Gallant soul of our brother Lord
[44:11] that spent so many years ministering
[44:13] this gospel and and every effort he put
[44:15] forth and the things he did for the
[44:17] kingdom of God and I pray that you'd
[44:19] Comfort his family during this time with
[44:22] brother Ron Lily there in the church
[44:24] Lord and just Comfort them in a special
[44:27] way and I pray that she would just have
[44:30] preeminence in this service this morning
[44:33] may may each individual receive a
[44:37] Special Touch from you Lord and may we
[44:40] be able to look beyond the The Vessel
[44:42] that's that's
[44:44] been selected to speak this morning and
[44:47] may we see Jesus Christ and
[44:50] Lord because I I have nothing in myself
[44:54] to bring but but I'm depending on you
[44:56] this morning
[44:58] and Lord as Ministers of the Gospel we
[45:01] recognize the Lord we we are inadequate
[45:04] we're enabled to do anything that would
[45:08] that would be of Eternal value but we
[45:10] depend on you for those parts Lord and
[45:13] so Lord we we do the only thing that we
[45:16] can do as brother Branham said he had a
[45:18] gift and that gift was to get himself
[45:19] out of the way so I pray this morning
[45:21] Father that you'd help me to pull into a
[45:25] gear or a channel where I could get out
[45:27] of the way Lord where you could speak
[45:29] something that would encourage people
[45:31] we're not here just to to waste
[45:33] someone's time we're not here just to be
[45:35] seen or to be heard or but Lord we we
[45:38] want to put forth every effort that we
[45:41] can to do something to encourage the
[45:43] Bride of Jesus Christ and that'll take
[45:46] you to do it father so we commit the
[45:48] service to you we thank you for your
[45:51] promise that you said you'd never leave
[45:52] us nor forsake us you said wherever two
[45:55] or three were gathered together you'd be
[45:57] in our midst and so we commit the
[45:59] service to you Lord and thank you for
[46:01] all things that you do in Jesus Christ's
[46:04] name amen we're truly blessed aren't we
[46:08] amen let's turn back to Acts chapter one
[46:10] and and pick up where we left off
[46:14] last night and we looked at David and
[46:17] Moses and Gideon and different
[46:20] characters of the scripture but we got
[46:22] to
[46:23] um just beginning to look at this and
[46:25] and Lord will take this and look at it
[46:28] this morning Acts chapter 1 verse 21
[46:32] this is after Judas has has went and
[46:35] hung himself and the disciples are in
[46:37] the upper room they realize there's a
[46:40] need for
[46:44] for God to move on the scene and do
[46:46] something I think we've let me try this
[46:55] well
[46:58] we might be better off to do it that way
[47:02] we had the format right there for a
[47:04] minute and then I messed it up it was
[47:06] cutting off on us last night but
[47:08] let's see what we can do
[47:11] God's good isn't he technology is good
[47:14] when it works
[47:23] well we'll just do that and you can kind
[47:25] of see
[47:26] a little better I think if we do it that
[47:28] way I don't think you can squint hard
[47:29] enough to read my other slides there
[47:31] anyhow but get it get ahead of me
[47:33] Acts chapter 1 and verse 21 wherefore of
[47:37] these men which have accompanied us
[47:42] all the time that the Lord Jesus went in
[47:44] and out Among Us beginning from the
[47:47] baptism of John
[47:49] unto that same day that he was taken up
[47:52] from us must one be ordained to be a
[47:57] witness of us of his resurrection you
[47:58] notice the disciples their stipulation
[48:01] that they were choosing to to pick this
[48:04] man they had it all in their mind of how
[48:06] it was to be and what type of man this
[48:09] would be to take judas's place and and
[48:12] they wanted a good old boy they wanted
[48:13] somebody that had been around since back
[48:16] in the day when when John first baptized
[48:19] Jesus and this was in their mind what
[48:21] the qualification was but you realize
[48:23] this is before the baptism of the Holy
[48:26] Ghost came and God had a different plan
[48:28] and so it says they gave forth their
[48:31] lots and the lot fell upon Matthias and
[48:34] he was numbered with the 11 Apostles God
[48:38] bless you you can be seated this morning
[48:39] we want to continue on with this thought
[48:41] of God's choice
[48:48] God's choice we found that as brother
[48:51] Bannon tells us man's Choice many times
[48:54] is not the same as God's choice he says
[48:57] in Hebrews chapter 6 part 2 and 1957
[49:01] when they selected a man to take judas's
[49:04] place they got the wrong man they got a
[49:09] gentleman Matthias a great scribe a
[49:13] scholar a diplomat they said he'll just
[49:17] take the real place boy he looks like a
[49:20] real man but it wasn't God's choice
[49:25] they with the best of their ability and
[49:28] 120 of them in the upper room and they
[49:31] narrowed it down to two men that they
[49:33] thought well it's got to be one of these
[49:34] two and they cast slots and they chose
[49:37] the wrong man brother Brandon said he
[49:39] never did anything that was recorded in
[49:41] the scriptures yet probably a good man
[49:44] probably would have made a great Deacon
[49:47] or a great Sunday school teacher a great
[49:49] man but wasn't called to this place that
[49:52] the disciples thought that he should be
[49:54] chosen and that was their choice but
[49:57] God's choice as we looked at it last
[49:59] night I want to look at this scripture
[50:00] again this was God's choice Acts chapter
[50:03] 8 verse 3 asked for Saul he made Havoc
[50:07] of the church entering into every house
[50:10] and hailing men and women committed them
[50:13] to prison
[50:15] that was God's choice
[50:17] and if you or I had been there if we'd
[50:19] be honest with ourselves this would have
[50:21] probably been one of the last men that
[50:23] we would have chosen
[50:25] but that was God's choice
[50:27] Moses if we had chosen someone to be a
[50:31] deliverer for the children of Egypt if
[50:33] you or I had been there we wouldn't have
[50:35] chosen the man that had tried years
[50:37] before it had failed and had been
[50:40] labeled as a murderer we wouldn't have
[50:42] picked Moses but that was God's choice
[50:46] and many of the characters in The Bible
[50:48] will be honest with ourselves I know
[50:50] sometimes you know we we read it and
[50:52] sugar coat it and and we look at it you
[50:54] know through just our our carnal
[50:57] backwards looking of all my if I'd have
[50:59] been there I would have chosen this
[51:01] manner that man but if we'll be honest
[51:03] with ourselves most of these men as we
[51:05] look at even what is shared with us in
[51:07] the scripture about them many of their
[51:09] flaws and things in their personal life
[51:12] and in their human nature that I'm
[51:14] thankful that the Bible doesn't say
[51:16] those things about me I'm thankful that
[51:19] it hasn't been written for me thousands
[51:21] of years like it was about Samson and
[51:23] David and Moses and Abraham and
[51:26] different ones things that the Bible
[51:27] shares about them but I'm also thankful
[51:30] that it's in there because then with our
[51:33] human Frailty and our human weakness
[51:36] when the Devil comes and begins to beat
[51:38] us over the head and says you'll never
[51:40] make it you're not worthy you're not you
[51:42] know sometimes we make the devil out to
[51:44] be just an absolute liar but there's
[51:46] many times that the devil will use the
[51:48] truth against you yes sir brother banham
[51:52] sat there when little Sharon Rose was
[51:54] dying and he called it his Gethsemane
[51:56] his darkest hour he said he could
[51:59] understand his white dying but to see
[52:01] that little baby go and he said he was
[52:03] standing there and he knelt by the bed
[52:05] and he began to pray and begin to beg
[52:08] God for this child's life and he said it
[52:11] was just as though a dark seat came down
[52:13] beside the bed and as if God had ignored
[52:17] his prayer as if God had refused to
[52:20] answer he said then the devil came up
[52:23] beside the bed and began to whisper in
[52:25] his ear and he said and you say he's a
[52:27] good God
[52:29] and you say he's a Healer and you say
[52:33] that you know he's done all these things
[52:35] and and he said but look at what he's
[52:37] done he's taken your wife from you and
[52:40] he's taking your daddy from you and your
[52:42] brother from you look at all these
[52:44] things that he said everything he was
[52:46] telling me
[52:48] was the truth
[52:51] the devil was
[52:59] and twist it to his own perverted means
[53:03] yes sir a lot of false doctrines got
[53:05] started because somebody took the truth
[53:08] and twisted it to their own perverted
[53:11] means
[53:12] most false doctrines that are out there
[53:14] if you go back and find out how they
[53:16] originated they originated on the truth
[53:18] but then somebody began to sow their own
[53:20] interpretation to it and begin to twist
[53:23] the truth the devil when he met Eve he
[53:26] told her 99 of the truth but then he
[53:28] just added one word
[53:31] and many times the devil will use the
[53:34] truth against us and he'll come and
[53:37] he'll tell us things about ourselves
[53:38] that God would never tell you about
[53:40] yourself
[53:44] you say was the devil more honest with
[53:46] me than God no it's just that God
[53:49] doesn't remember some of those things
[53:50] about you that the devil remembers
[53:54] some of those things that the devil
[53:56] throws in your face God has cast in the
[53:59] sea of forgetfulness and he doesn't even
[54:01] remember anymore
[54:03] but the devil will use those things
[54:06] about you things that are true about us
[54:08] he'll use those things and he'll remind
[54:11] you but remember when you used to be
[54:13] this way and remember when you do this
[54:15] and remember yesterday when you had that
[54:18] thought and remember last week when you
[54:20] you you responded to somebody in a way
[54:23] that you should have just got away and
[54:24] prayed really before you sent that text
[54:27] or before you sent that email or before
[54:29] you made that that phone call and so you
[54:31] responded out of reaction you said
[54:34] something you shouldn't have said and he
[54:36] reminds us of those things and he points
[54:39] us back to those things and many of
[54:40] those things are true about us
[54:43] but that's not God's thoughts of us
[54:48] you see there were many things that
[54:51] David could have thought about himself
[54:52] as we looked at him last night and and
[54:55] some of his human weakness and human
[54:57] errors and there were things that David
[55:00] could have thought about himself there
[55:02] were things that the devil no doubt said
[55:04] to David about himself but it didn't
[55:06] matter what the devil thought about
[55:08] David it didn't even really matter what
[55:10] David thought about David it mattered
[55:12] what God thought about David
[55:16] you know David when he goes down there
[55:18] to fight Goliath and he looks so so uh
[55:22] an uneven match against this Goliath
[55:26] against this giant and he goes down
[55:28] there to fight Goliath and it looked
[55:31] like all the odds were against him but
[55:33] hey I just I'll just say it this way I
[55:36] believe David could have laid down there
[55:38] on the battlefield and just put his
[55:41] slingshot in his pocket and Goliath
[55:44] would have tripped on his way down to
[55:45] him and broke his neck or something
[55:49] it was impossible for David to lose
[55:52] against Goliath
[55:54] it was impossible
[55:56] and and Saul and different ones in the
[55:59] Army looking at it there no doubt they
[56:01] thought it's impossible for this young
[56:03] man to win but it was impossible for him
[56:06] to lose take you until God is done with
[56:10] him
[56:12] brother random was saying the message I
[56:14] know he said oh Trials come he said why
[56:16] did they come he said it's to bring us
[56:19] into a closer fellowship with God he
[56:21] said God takes trials and puts a bit
[56:24] sentence him out and makes the trials he
[56:26] said so no matter how great the trial no
[56:29] matter how great the opposition he said
[56:31] Satan cannot take your life until God is
[56:34] finished with you
[56:37] he realized when when Satan comes up
[56:40] against us it'd be like if he was in
[56:42] school and the bully at school came down
[56:45] knocked on the door
[56:46] some some of brother Samuel's Sons here
[56:49] if they if they were in school and they
[56:52] they the bully came up and knocked on
[56:54] the door said Mr Browning
[56:57] I'd like to take your son out in the
[56:58] street and work him over a little bit
[57:01] but there's a law that I've got to get
[57:04] your permission first would it be okay
[57:06] so you get out of here you crazy thing
[57:09] or you'll have a Manning on this ordeal
[57:13] and you realize that's what it is with
[57:15] Satan he has to go and ask my father
[57:18] permission
[57:20] there's a little sister was sitting back
[57:22] there in the hallway with the headache
[57:24] that we we want to remember in prayer
[57:26] this morning that God will just touch
[57:27] her and deliver you realize Satan had to
[57:30] go and knock on the father's door and
[57:32] say is it all right if I give her a
[57:34] headache this morning
[57:36] and you realize if God allowed it to
[57:38] happen that even though maybe it's
[57:40] causing her pain and discomfort there
[57:42] was a reason and a purpose for him to
[57:43] allow that you realize no matter how
[57:46] dark the storm no matter how bad the
[57:48] trial if God has allowed it to come he
[57:50] didn't just do that to punish you he
[57:52] didn't do that because he's an unjust
[57:54] judge he did that because there's a
[57:57] reason and a purpose and we look at a
[57:59] moment in time and we get caught in that
[58:01] but God looks down through eternity and
[58:03] says this is what's best for my child
[58:08] amen things that happen tragedies and
[58:12] things that we don't understand
[58:15] and most people would look at things
[58:16] like the Holocaust even Ministers of the
[58:19] Gospel during that time turned away and
[58:22] became atheists because they couldn't
[58:24] they couldn't reconcile how that God
[58:27] could sit up there in heaven that man
[58:29] wrote the book The Silent God that
[58:31] brother Adam talked about and how did a
[58:33] man could how that God could sit up
[58:35] there and and could just remain silent
[58:37] and watch his children slaughtered by
[58:40] the millions they couldn't understand it
[58:42] but we had a Prophet come and say it was
[58:44] the gentle hand of Jehovah
[58:47] getting his children back in their
[58:49] Homeland well thank God for prophetic
[58:52] insights
[58:53] that we have the ability to look at
[58:55] things differently than some people look
[58:57] at them
[58:58] the gentle hand of Jehovah How could a
[59:01] statement like that be made because
[59:02] that's what it was
[59:04] it's that God has a way of doing things
[59:06] and sometimes they look terrible
[59:08] sometimes circumstances in our life
[59:10] let's just be honest there's probably a
[59:12] lot of us here this morning that right
[59:13] now maybe things don't look good but I
[59:16] promise you they're working together for
[59:18] your good
[59:20] maybe they don't look good for you this
[59:22] morning maybe the finances are bad maybe
[59:24] your health is bad maybe you've been
[59:26] oppressed or tormented or maybe the
[59:28] devil's tried to come at you with
[59:30] depression or or anxiety and maybe the
[59:33] doctors give you up or maybe there's
[59:36] trouble in the home maybe broken
[59:37] families and things and it doesn't look
[59:39] good but I promised you this morning
[59:41] that Romans 8 and 38 or Romans 8 28 is
[59:45] is true in the face of anything
[59:48] things
[59:51] it's easy to say all things when we get
[59:53] that bonus check all things work
[59:55] together when Biden was sending all
[59:57] those stimulus checks all things weren't
[59:59] together
[1:00:00] for the good of them they love the Lord
[1:00:03] amen when you meet that lovely young
[1:00:05] lady finally and Wedding Bells Are
[1:00:07] Ringing you standing there at the altar
[1:00:09] all things work together for good but
[1:00:11] fast forward a few years and brother
[1:00:12] Brandon said when you first get married
[1:00:14] everything's just wonderful but he said
[1:00:15] but then the trials of Life begin to
[1:00:18] come and that's when you've got to
[1:00:19] understand one another that's when you
[1:00:21] got to love one another
[1:00:23] in the middle of the trial
[1:00:26] when she's disappointed in you and
[1:00:28] you're disappointed in her can you stand
[1:00:29] there and say all things work together
[1:00:31] for good
[1:00:32] when the baby's sick in the hospital
[1:00:35] when the bank account's overdrawn and
[1:00:37] you're getting those overdraft fees can
[1:00:39] we stand there and say all things
[1:00:42] work together for good job had one of
[1:00:45] the worst days anybody could ever
[1:00:46] imagine happening and his result his
[1:00:49] response was not well if that's the way
[1:00:51] it is I'll just quit church if that's
[1:00:53] the way it is I'll just leave the
[1:00:55] message if that's the way it is I'll
[1:00:56] just stop serving God and be an atheist
[1:00:58] his response to the worst day that we
[1:01:01] could imagine was he fell on his face
[1:01:03] and he worshiped God
[1:01:06] all right
[1:01:09] David's response to the greatest sin
[1:01:12] that he ever did when he falls as we
[1:01:15] looked at it last night it was he falls
[1:01:17] into this adultery with Bathsheba and
[1:01:20] she gets pregnant and he goes and he
[1:01:22] allows little Uriah there to be killed
[1:01:25] on the battlefield and his men draw back
[1:01:27] from him and leave him out there by
[1:01:29] himself brother said when I get to
[1:01:30] heaven I want to shake your eye as hands
[1:01:33] he didn't say that about a lot of people
[1:01:35] if he had said that about me I'd have a
[1:01:38] t-shirt printed
[1:01:40] when I get to heaven I want to say
[1:01:42] brother Nathan saying I'd go around
[1:01:43] you've seen this quote
[1:01:47] stick or whatever yeah
[1:01:49] home I'd be handling them out in
[1:01:51] services
[1:01:54] but he said that about Uriah when I get
[1:01:57] to heaven I want to shake his hand and
[1:01:59] David's response to his greatest mistake
[1:02:03] and when the prophet has come and expose
[1:02:05] this on him and said David you're the
[1:02:08] man
[1:02:09] you're the man that you're proclaiming
[1:02:11] judgment about when it's not us see
[1:02:12] we're quick to judge somebody else and
[1:02:14] say oh yes they deserve bring them up
[1:02:16] before the church and all exposes when
[1:02:19] it's us Grace Grace cried the Capstone
[1:02:22] when it's our family
[1:02:24] that's why as a pastor when I'm sitting
[1:02:26] there counseling somebody or trying to
[1:02:28] encourage somebody or dealing with the
[1:02:30] situation at church I try to picture
[1:02:32] what if that was my son or daughter that
[1:02:34] I was sitting there handling that
[1:02:35] situation with because someday it may be
[1:02:37] and if I'm going to handle it different
[1:02:39] with them because well they're the
[1:02:40] pastor's child then I am going to be
[1:02:42] with somebody else then people will see
[1:02:44] a double standard we see that in a lot
[1:02:47] of message churches that say well that's
[1:02:49] the Deacon's son or that so they get to
[1:02:51] do this but this brother over here oh my
[1:02:52] when his child did it they just about
[1:02:54] ran him out of town on a board but
[1:02:55] David's response he didn't say well uh
[1:02:58] now now people know that I'm a sinner
[1:03:01] and so I'm just going to stay home for
[1:03:02] about three years and stream but it said
[1:03:05] he went to the temple and he worships
[1:03:08] he went down to the Tabernacle there and
[1:03:11] he begins to worship God because even
[1:03:13] though he was a failure God was still
[1:03:16] worthy of worship
[1:03:20] we make it about us
[1:03:22] well I worked all day and I'm tired it's
[1:03:24] Wednesday night I don't feel like
[1:03:26] worshiping
[1:03:27] Paul I'm sorry I didn't realize it was
[1:03:29] all about you wow
[1:03:31] wow I'll let the song leader do it for
[1:03:33] me I'll let the pastor preach me into it
[1:03:36] all but there's something brother Adam
[1:03:37] said but your priests and Kings with the
[1:03:40] sacrifice of praise on our lips that
[1:03:43] when we come to church I don't feel like
[1:03:44] raising my hands well that's the time we
[1:03:46] should do it
[1:03:48] Finish Line
[1:03:49] I don't feel like praising him well he's
[1:03:51] worthy of it whether I feel like it or
[1:03:53] not
[1:03:54] I'm thankful that my dad growing up
[1:03:57] brother Samuel I'm thankful he didn't
[1:03:59] only go to work to provide for his
[1:04:00] family on days that he felt like it
[1:04:04] there are a lot of days I'm sure he
[1:04:06] didn't feel like it he still rolled out
[1:04:08] of bed and a lot of times when I was a
[1:04:09] little boy he was driving 90 miles each
[1:04:12] way to work in a chemical plant there
[1:04:14] and dad's not a fan of heights but he'd
[1:04:17] go right up in those smokestacks and
[1:04:18] work because he had a baby and some
[1:04:20] other children and a wife back home that
[1:04:22] needed to be fed and he was traveling
[1:04:24] back and forth working days with pain in
[1:04:26] his body and sickness in his body but he
[1:04:29] had an obligation that he had to provide
[1:04:31] for his family so he went even when he
[1:04:33] didn't feel like it now that's in the
[1:04:35] natural but I want to say there's times
[1:04:36] as Believers we probably don't feel like
[1:04:39] going to church we probably don't feel
[1:04:41] like worshiping God but as a Believer I
[1:04:43] have an obligation to love him and to
[1:04:46] serve him and to worship him whether I
[1:04:49] feel like it or not
[1:04:51] hey he didn't feel like going to Calvary
[1:04:53] for me but he did it anyhow
[1:04:56] this man Saul was a persecutor of the
[1:05:00] church
[1:05:01] he was going about and putting them in
[1:05:04] prison and consenting unto little
[1:05:06] Stephen's death as we looked at it last
[1:05:08] night standing there holding the coach
[1:05:10] and God looks down through eternity and
[1:05:12] he says I choose him
[1:05:14] that wouldn't have been our choice
[1:05:17] it wasn't the apostles Choice even when
[1:05:19] he began to preach they said hey we
[1:05:21] don't know about this man and Barnabas
[1:05:22] had to bring him and kind of encourage
[1:05:24] him hey the Lord's really doing some
[1:05:26] mighty things for him I know maybe I
[1:05:28] know all about his past but you ought to
[1:05:29] come down to the meeting that you ought
[1:05:30] to see what the Lord's doing something
[1:05:32] has got a hold of this man and changed
[1:05:34] him
[1:05:36] so that wasn't their choice they chose
[1:05:38] Matthias and they chose wrong but this
[1:05:41] was God's choice
[1:05:43] Acts chapter 9 and verse 13 this is when
[1:05:46] God tells ananias to go and pray for
[1:05:50] Paul because he's been blinded by this
[1:05:52] Supernatural light that others couldn't
[1:05:54] even see but it was so real to Paul that
[1:05:56] it blinded his eyes
[1:05:58] and ananias does like us a lot of times
[1:06:00] God tells us to do something and we want
[1:06:03] to explain all the details to God
[1:06:06] we want to inform God but God do you
[1:06:08] really know about this situation all he
[1:06:10] knows
[1:06:11] but God you just don't understand no he
[1:06:13] understands but God if you'd only been
[1:06:16] through what I've been through oh he's
[1:06:17] been through more than what you've been
[1:06:18] through
[1:06:19] God you just don't know what type of
[1:06:21] person all he knows better than you know
[1:06:23] in fact he knows better than they know
[1:06:26] you see many of the trials that God
[1:06:28] allowed the Believers to go down through
[1:06:29] Through the Ages you realize Abraham
[1:06:32] when he he's placed in that test and he
[1:06:35] draws back his hand to slay Isaac God
[1:06:38] did not need for Abraham to do that to
[1:06:40] prove Abraham to God God knew what was
[1:06:43] in Abraham but I believe he wanted
[1:06:45] Abraham to realize what was really down
[1:06:47] in Abraham
[1:06:48] God didn't need to prove job so that he
[1:06:51] had to test him and make I just
[1:06:53] I just want a job I want to put
[1:06:56] she'll really serve me God had already
[1:06:58] spoke over job to the devil that he said
[1:07:01] it don't matter what you do he won't
[1:07:03] turn against me God knew but he wanted
[1:07:06] job to have that Assurance
[1:07:09] there's trials we go through and come
[1:07:11] out the other side we think oh my God
[1:07:13] there's no way I could have held on
[1:07:15] through that so I know it was you that
[1:07:17] was holding on to me
[1:07:18] and God allows us to go through those
[1:07:21] times not to prove us to him but to
[1:07:23] prove us to us
[1:07:26] so really what the quality that we're
[1:07:29] made of and it's molding and building
[1:07:30] that character in a Christian brother
[1:07:32] Brown said character is not a gift it's
[1:07:34] a victory
[1:07:36] all right and so now God tells ananias
[1:07:39] go pray for this man and ananias
[1:07:40] answered the Lord Lord I have heard many
[1:07:43] I've heard by many of this man how much
[1:07:46] evil he hath done to thy Saints of
[1:07:48] Jerusalem and here he hath Authority
[1:07:51] from the chief priests to bind all that
[1:07:53] call on thy name but the Lord said unto
[1:07:55] him go thy way for he is the chosen
[1:07:58] vessel unto me to Bear my name before
[1:08:02] the Gentiles and Kings and the children
[1:08:04] of Israel
[1:08:06] he's a chosen vessel God's choice
[1:08:10] God's choice he realizes it's easy for
[1:08:12] us to look back there and say that about
[1:08:13] Paul but can you say it about yourself
[1:08:14] this morning
[1:08:17] I didn't choose me God chose me all
[1:08:20] right
[1:08:21] as we said last night people want to
[1:08:23] complain about brother Branham being
[1:08:25] Malachi 4. hey don't don't come and
[1:08:26] complain to me don't come and complain
[1:08:28] to brother Branham I didn't choose him
[1:08:30] he didn't choose him God chose him you
[1:08:32] got a problem with it take it up with
[1:08:34] God God why didn't you choose somebody
[1:08:35] else well that same Spirit was back
[1:08:37] there in Saul's day you think there were
[1:08:39] people that were happy that that's who
[1:08:41] God chose God why didn't you choose my
[1:08:42] uncle my he's he has it hardly it's done
[1:08:45] anything his whole life he's he's been
[1:08:47] there he's been faithful in the
[1:08:48] synagogue and all my he walked right
[1:08:50] with Jesus all the way from the baptism
[1:08:52] and he was there at this and he was
[1:08:54] there at this and he did this and he did
[1:08:56] that he sacrificed over here he gave us
[1:08:58] in this man's the persecutor of the
[1:08:59] church and you chose him but God knew
[1:09:02] there was something down on the inside
[1:09:04] of Paul that was exactly what he needed
[1:09:06] to get to the people that he was trying
[1:09:08] to reach a quality inside of Paul we
[1:09:12] look at it and say well this brother is
[1:09:13] a little different than me his
[1:09:15] personality is a little different his
[1:09:16] style is a little different his his way
[1:09:19] of ministry or the way their worship
[1:09:21] service is or something is a little
[1:09:22] different than us so I guess we'll just
[1:09:24] write them up but God has a way of using
[1:09:26] people like that to reach somebody that
[1:09:27] maybe we can't reach he's a god of
[1:09:30] variety
[1:09:31] yes here my I had a sister at our church
[1:09:36] she's going through a battle and
[1:09:39] she got some family members telling her
[1:09:42] she's going to hell because she believes
[1:09:44] the message
[1:09:45] then she's got other people other family
[1:09:48] members on the other side telling her
[1:09:49] you're going to hell because you go to
[1:09:52] the church you do they're message
[1:09:53] Believers but they think she picked the
[1:09:54] wrong church so she's going to hell
[1:09:56] because of that
[1:09:57] she said what do you think brother
[1:09:58] Nathan I said I think they've forgotten
[1:10:00] the Simplicity of John 3 16.
[1:10:06] that we don't go to go to heaven because
[1:10:07] of where we go to church
[1:10:09] or we don't go to heaven because we
[1:10:11] believe a Doctrine the right way but we
[1:10:13] go to heaven because Jesus Christ paid a
[1:10:16] price for us
[1:10:17] 2 000 years ago that I couldn't pay and
[1:10:21] because I have accepted what he did for
[1:10:23] me I'm going to heaven no matter what
[1:10:25] anybody thinks about me
[1:10:28] you didn't put me in you can't take me
[1:10:30] out
[1:10:33] I get to go to heaven because Jesus
[1:10:35] paved the way for me
[1:10:37] [Applause]
[1:10:38] so he believes the wrong thing or he
[1:10:40] picked the wrong church or he did this
[1:10:42] or he did that he don't see it like me
[1:10:44] oh you know I'm so thankful that God
[1:10:46] draws the circle bigger
[1:10:49] amen
[1:10:51] my
[1:10:53] [Music]
[1:10:55] from that time 19
[1:10:57] 60. brother bam says this is the quote
[1:10:59] we finally got to it this is the quote I
[1:11:02] said yesterday I was pushing the
[1:11:04] lawnmower around the yard and praying
[1:11:06] about what to preach listening to tape
[1:11:08] and the Lord just dropped this title
[1:11:10] into my heart as I was listening to this
[1:11:12] tape brother man said when Paul got
[1:11:14] converted perhaps the church said oh
[1:11:16] look what we got now
[1:11:18] we got this great big ball we know that
[1:11:21] that man said under gamalia
[1:11:24] he's one of the greatest teachers in the
[1:11:26] land
[1:11:27] and he's a Pharisee he's oh he's a great
[1:11:30] man we we'll put him up at Jerusalem and
[1:11:33] we'll make him the head of the church up
[1:11:35] there and we'll take Peter of course the
[1:11:39] Bible said he was ignorant and unlearned
[1:11:40] and he's got the keys and we'll send him
[1:11:43] out to the poor dumb Gentiles that's the
[1:11:46] one we'll send him to because he does a
[1:11:48] lot of Miracles but this great
[1:11:50] intellectual man will bring up here at
[1:11:52] this intellectual crowd huh he says the
[1:11:56] Holy Ghost sent Paul out to the dumb
[1:11:58] ones and made him forget all he ever
[1:12:00] known and took Peter to Dublin and sent
[1:12:03] him up to the educated ones
[1:12:06] what's the matter
[1:12:08] they met God and from that time on the
[1:12:11] intellectuals didn't count that's right
[1:12:13] from that time on the record was changed
[1:12:15] how God does things just contrary to
[1:12:19] man's thinking
[1:12:20] [Music]
[1:12:22] now we look at that and we can look we
[1:12:24] we're so good as human beings that
[1:12:26] looking back at history and said oh well
[1:12:28] praise God yes I would have known that
[1:12:29] if I was there but Spirits don't die and
[1:12:32] so whatever your attitude would have
[1:12:34] been back there is what your attitude is
[1:12:36] now I've got people you know relatives
[1:12:38] and things out in the nominal world all
[1:12:40] they don't have a problem recognizing
[1:12:41] Noah and Moses and and David and
[1:12:44] characters like that of course they were
[1:12:46] prophets but when it comes to today and
[1:12:48] a man does more signs and wonders than
[1:12:50] what David did and it's more Vindicated
[1:12:52] and takes us back to the original Earth
[1:12:55] they have a problem recognizing that but
[1:12:57] yet they would have followed a man who
[1:12:58] said God told me to build a boat
[1:13:02] when it never rains
[1:13:04] they would have followed that but
[1:13:07] couldn't follow brother Branham
[1:13:09] they would have followed a man who said
[1:13:11] hey God came supernaturally and spoke to
[1:13:13] me out of a bush
[1:13:15] and I walked by and it was burning
[1:13:17] but it wasn't being consumed and he
[1:13:20] spoke out of that bush and he said I am
[1:13:22] that I am
[1:13:24] did you get a picture of it Moses
[1:13:28] didn't have my Polaroid with me
[1:13:31] did you get a sample of that leaf and
[1:13:33] bring it back to the chemical uh plant
[1:13:37] to be able to break it down and see what
[1:13:39] was causing that maybe it was just a
[1:13:41] maybe it was just a freak of nature
[1:13:43] maybe it was something maybe there was a
[1:13:45] chemical on it that did that no I I
[1:13:47] didn't do that did you get a recording
[1:13:49] of God's voice saying I am that I no I
[1:13:51] don't have that you're just going to
[1:13:52] have to take my word oh I would have
[1:13:54] believed that man but a prophet at our
[1:13:57] age no I can't believe that
[1:14:01] you wouldn't have believed back then
[1:14:02] your action today shows that
[1:14:08] we've had more Vindication more evidence
[1:14:11] than any other age
[1:14:13] people have a hard time with it why
[1:14:14] because there was nothing in them to
[1:14:16] believe they wouldn't have believed back
[1:14:17] there
[1:14:18] that's right
[1:14:19] God takes this man whose name was Saul
[1:14:22] which meant desired oh my we like that
[1:14:25] don't we oh my brother's would invite
[1:14:28] him to Great conventions and things all
[1:14:29] we we desire this man to come he's
[1:14:31] friends with K Ephesus and and my he's
[1:14:34] got a name among the brother and look
[1:14:36] what he's doing my he's he's really
[1:14:37] putting the pressure to this Christian
[1:14:39] Movement over here and my he's a great
[1:14:42] man he's powerful he's got he's got it
[1:14:44] in with the governor there to where he's
[1:14:46] writing him letters and giving him power
[1:14:48] and authority he was desired and God
[1:14:50] takes him and says that I can't use you
[1:14:53] with that name but I'm going to take
[1:14:55] that s off and make it a p and that's
[1:14:57] going to mean small or little
[1:15:02] amen but Lord
[1:15:07] I'm going to take you from being this
[1:15:09] desired one from being this popular and
[1:15:11] I'm going to take you and you're going
[1:15:13] to be put in prison and you're going to
[1:15:15] be stoned with rocks and you're going to
[1:15:17] be beaten and you're going to be almost
[1:15:19] drowned in the sea on multiple occasions
[1:15:22] and you're going to be kicked out of
[1:15:23] towns and out of synagogues I'm going to
[1:15:25] take this one who was desired and make
[1:15:28] you small or little how many well I want
[1:15:30] to ask you to raise your hands but how
[1:15:31] many of us would have wanted a Ministry
[1:15:33] like Paul's always say oh praise God my
[1:15:35] he smote a man blind and he did this and
[1:15:38] he did he he he told that lady turned
[1:15:40] around cast that devil out of her and
[1:15:42] and he look at all the signs oh yes but
[1:15:44] look at what else followed his ministry
[1:15:47] he didn't write a lot of his emails to
[1:15:49] the church from a nice kissy office in a
[1:15:51] 300 chair but he was in prison
[1:15:53] down in Dungeons and things
[1:15:57] he takes this man he says he's going to
[1:15:59] be a chosen vessel
[1:16:01] to the Gentiles no way we would have
[1:16:03] chosen Paul if we had been the ones
[1:16:05] choosing oh we would have probably been
[1:16:07] right there voting for Matthias or one
[1:16:09] of the other brothers oh yes that's a
[1:16:11] real man of God but when it came time to
[1:16:13] choose Paul my no doubt the church was
[1:16:15] shocked but that was God's choice
[1:16:17] you realize it wasn't just those men in
[1:16:20] the upper room that would have been
[1:16:21] shocked by this no doubt it was a shock
[1:16:23] to Paul that Lord after all this he
[1:16:25] comes and Paul doesn't just say this to
[1:16:27] be humble I I hear people all the time
[1:16:29] brother Wayne they said Oh Brother
[1:16:30] Branham just made these statements to be
[1:16:32] humble well then how can I follow that
[1:16:34] how do I know then when he was being
[1:16:36] humble and when he was being real and
[1:16:39] when it's a quote they don't like or
[1:16:40] they think that it takes away from
[1:16:42] something oh well we just we think he
[1:16:44] was just being humble there well why
[1:16:45] don't you just say we feel like he lied
[1:16:48] he was just lying to make people happy
[1:16:50] no you must be following a different man
[1:16:52] than me
[1:16:54] that's right brother no when he would
[1:16:56] stand there before 300 of the
[1:16:58] Ministerial Association of Chicago and
[1:16:59] say just bring your Bible and show me he
[1:17:03] didn't compromise with them because of
[1:17:04] popularity or political pressure so no I
[1:17:07] don't believe he said things just to be
[1:17:08] humble I believe he said what he meant
[1:17:10] he meant what he said and so I believe
[1:17:11] the same thing of Saint Paul because he
[1:17:13] was the same caliber Prophet a prophet
[1:17:15] messenger for that age and he comes and
[1:17:18] he says my he said I'm the least among
[1:17:21] you because I persecuted the church
[1:17:25] Paul wasn't saying that so people would
[1:17:26] think Oh my he is so humble look at look
[1:17:29] at how humble that man is Paul really
[1:17:31] felt that way and no doubt he'd maybe
[1:17:33] wake up in a cold sweat sometimes in the
[1:17:35] middle of the night hearing this Stephen
[1:17:37] stand there and and say father lay not
[1:17:40] this to their charge and he'd wake up
[1:17:43] and think how could I do it how could I
[1:17:45] stand there and hold the coach of those
[1:17:47] men you think he didn't feel unworthy
[1:17:48] you think the devil didn't get on his
[1:17:50] shoulder sometimes to say who do you
[1:17:52] think you are Paul
[1:17:54] who do you think you are to write these
[1:17:56] letters to these established churches
[1:17:59] and these men of God who have been
[1:18:01] Believers way longer than you have who
[1:18:03] do you think you are to stand there and
[1:18:04] correct a man like Peter who our lord
[1:18:07] Jesus said had the keys to the kingdom
[1:18:10] foreign
[1:18:11] but it was God's choice
[1:18:13] [Applause]
[1:18:15] perfect strength by Perfect weakness
[1:18:17] again we're going to look at several
[1:18:18] quotes from this tonight or this morning
[1:18:20] I thought it was going to be tonight but
[1:18:21] it's this morning
[1:18:23] 1961. one of the important things that
[1:18:25] we must Master now he says remember this
[1:18:28] and especially you young preachers and
[1:18:30] lay members alike there's one thing that
[1:18:33] we've got to master if we expect to
[1:18:36] fulfill God's desire in our life that is
[1:18:38] we have to master the thought of human
[1:18:42] ability
[1:18:43] if ever if we ever get to a spot where
[1:18:47] we think that we can do it with our own
[1:18:48] intelligence and our own abilities we've
[1:18:51] got to master that in such a way that we
[1:18:53] can get rid of the thing and lay it
[1:18:55] aside so that God can use us
[1:18:58] if we get to a spot we come out as
[1:19:00] Minister bless God well I've got a gift
[1:19:02] in my life and I've got this and I've
[1:19:04] got that when I come to a Pulpit I thank
[1:19:05] God if you don't show up this is going
[1:19:07] to be a mess if you don't show up then I
[1:19:11] don't have anything to say but I found
[1:19:13] out that he's faithful
[1:19:15] I found out that he shows up every time
[1:19:18] there's been times I've got right down
[1:19:19] to the wire where I thought Lord I have
[1:19:21] no idea what I'm going to say when I
[1:19:22] step out there but he's never failed me
[1:19:24] yet
[1:19:25] and he shows up and so we depend on him
[1:19:27] in that way that it is not our human
[1:19:29] ability it is not my human ability it is
[1:19:33] not something in me that that I can come
[1:19:35] out and say oh my I have this as a
[1:19:37] preacher of the Gospel or as a message
[1:19:39] believer as as this or that I have
[1:19:42] nothing to brag on of myself
[1:19:45] but it's Jesus that does the work
[1:19:49] brother Branham didn't have anything in
[1:19:51] his family history to brag about
[1:19:53] Paul didn't have anything of his great
[1:19:55] choices that he could brag about but it
[1:19:57] was God that got a hold of these men and
[1:19:59] used them because it was God's choice to
[1:20:02] do so
[1:20:03] and so as I said last night we can get
[1:20:05] to a spot where we let the devil take
[1:20:07] these things and if we're not careful we
[1:20:10] just become so self-deprecating that we
[1:20:13] just want to say so many terrible things
[1:20:15] about it said well I'm just a failure
[1:20:17] and I'm just no good and I'm I guess I'm
[1:20:20] just a weak Christian and I guess I just
[1:20:23] don't have much Faith Brotherhood said
[1:20:24] that's exactly how the devil wants you
[1:20:26] to talk
[1:20:28] he wants you to have that type of
[1:20:30] confession over your life but then if
[1:20:32] the devil can't push you to that extreme
[1:20:34] he'll push you over here well bless God
[1:20:35] I'm the bride and I I've got bride power
[1:20:38] and I can do this and I can do that I'll
[1:20:40] go out here and I ain't going to do
[1:20:42] nothing without Jesus
[1:20:44] yes
[1:20:45] amen hey I believe there's power in the
[1:20:47] bride but it is not of her own thinking
[1:20:53] we talk about the third pull watch out
[1:20:55] brother Branham uses the third pull
[1:20:57] it wasn't name it and claim it
[1:21:01] you see there's a great difference
[1:21:02] between the Pentecostal thinking and
[1:21:04] what brother Madam actually taught us
[1:21:05] now there's men in the Pentecostal
[1:21:07] Realms oh naming and claim it and
[1:21:09] prosperity Doctrine I Don't Preach
[1:21:10] Prosperity but I do preach provisions
[1:21:14] and man God didn't promise me a Ferrari
[1:21:16] but he promised that he'd provide for me
[1:21:18] God God didn't promise me a 5 500 000
[1:21:22] square foot mansion or something like
[1:21:24] that but he did promise me that he'd
[1:21:26] provide for me
[1:21:27] and so when you look at men like uh uh
[1:21:31] I'm trying to remember who the man was
[1:21:34] oh was it Norman Vincent peel that wrote
[1:21:36] that book
[1:21:38] power of positive thinking
[1:21:41] and brother man talked about Norman
[1:21:43] Vince appeal I've seen his church there
[1:21:45] in New York where he pastored brother
[1:21:46] Brandon talked about how he how reverent
[1:21:48] it was when they went in and out and
[1:21:50] dismissed Services he'd have three
[1:21:51] services on a Sunday because they had
[1:21:53] such great crowds and things and and but
[1:21:55] Norman Vincent peel would take if you've
[1:21:57] ever read or heard his book there The
[1:21:59] Power of Positive Thinking Norman
[1:22:01] Vincent Peale had a wonderful concept
[1:22:03] but he placed it in the hands of man
[1:22:06] that just if you take it and you think
[1:22:09] about it and and you claim it and you
[1:22:11] confess it well that's wonderful if you
[1:22:13] have a scriptural promise
[1:22:15] if it's in the word then absolutely we
[1:22:18] can claim that with authority because
[1:22:20] God's word said so but there's things
[1:22:22] that people go out and claim that is not
[1:22:24] in God's word for them to do and so it's
[1:22:26] not just mind over matter it's not just
[1:22:29] the power of positive thinking but it is
[1:22:31] taking the promises of God and
[1:22:34] confessing those over your life
[1:22:37] see how close it was but yet then we
[1:22:41] place it in the hands of man brother
[1:22:42] Bannon would say it this way listen I
[1:22:44] hope I hope you you understand this
[1:22:46] morning what he's saying to us he said
[1:22:48] I'm not a Healer he said If I Was A
[1:22:50] Healer their laser my mother dying
[1:22:53] he said If I Was A Healer I'd go heal
[1:22:54] her
[1:22:55] but he said I can only do as he says
[1:22:58] Jesus
[1:22:59] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:23:02] stood there and he said I only do that
[1:23:04] which the father shows me
[1:23:06] brother Brown said in 20th century
[1:23:08] Prophet there he said it showed that he
[1:23:10] didn't do anything without a vision from
[1:23:11] the father
[1:23:13] so there are times as brothers we get
[1:23:15] under inspiration and there have been
[1:23:17] things that I've said that I thought
[1:23:18] goodness gracious if that was me I'd be
[1:23:19] scared to death to say it
[1:23:22] but God brought it to pass because it
[1:23:24] wasn't my thoughts it was something he
[1:23:26] impressed on me over and over and over
[1:23:28] sometimes as a minister we're standing
[1:23:29] there saying God Don't make me say that
[1:23:31] God I don't want to say that he keeps
[1:23:33] impressing it and impressing okay God
[1:23:35] then I know that's not me that's not my
[1:23:37] thought so I'll say it and if it's him
[1:23:39] better watch out devil every demon out
[1:23:42] of hell can't stop it but remember
[1:23:44] brother Neville he had a gift of
[1:23:46] Prophecy and brother Branham sets him
[1:23:47] down and says brother Neville you need
[1:23:49] to be careful and it wasn't that he
[1:23:51] didn't have a gift wasn't that he wasn't
[1:23:52] a Godly Man wasn't that he didn't have
[1:23:54] the Holy Ghost he said you need to be
[1:23:55] careful because the people are pulling
[1:23:57] on you so much they're going to pull
[1:23:59] something out of you humanly that you'll
[1:24:01] get in the flesh and just say something
[1:24:03] to try to help them that little girl
[1:24:04] came there the Simpson girl I think it
[1:24:06] was and said well brother Branham I had
[1:24:08] a dream tell me what it is and every
[1:24:10] time she'd get around and brother banned
[1:24:11] him you got the interpretation for that
[1:24:12] dream brother Brandon you got the
[1:24:14] interpretation she began to get a little
[1:24:15] frustrated with him and he said what if
[1:24:17] I would tell you he said I think I know
[1:24:19] well bless God he's a prophet that's
[1:24:21] good enough for me
[1:24:23] he said I think I know
[1:24:25] but he said but what if I said so and
[1:24:29] that was just me and then it's not so
[1:24:31] then what if there's a need and she
[1:24:32] comes around how can she have confidence
[1:24:34] in me
[1:24:37] so I believe it's the bride of Christ we
[1:24:39] will speak things
[1:24:40] and they will come to pass but brother
[1:24:43] Branham said it's not men that's leading
[1:24:45] the church now some people ran off on a
[1:24:46] limb and said well we don't need anybody
[1:24:48] then but read the rest of the quote he
[1:24:50] said it's the Holy Spirit leading the
[1:24:52] church through man
[1:24:53] [Applause]
[1:24:57] and so if a man will surrender to the
[1:24:59] Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit will
[1:25:01] work through him and speak through him
[1:25:03] watch out Satan but if that happens and
[1:25:06] then we get in ourself then we say well
[1:25:07] bless God look what I did it wasn't you
[1:25:09] it wasn't you that said that and if we
[1:25:12] begin to depend on our own ability and
[1:25:14] say well uh look what look what I
[1:25:15] accomplished and then we go out and try
[1:25:17] to do it you better be careful
[1:25:18] [Applause]
[1:25:20] David was a giant slayer because Jehovah
[1:25:23] was with him
[1:25:25] but you take Jehovah out of the equation
[1:25:27] I doubt David could have whipped very
[1:25:29] much at all
[1:25:30] Samson was a mighty man of Valor fought
[1:25:33] a thousand men but they cut his hair and
[1:25:35] a little woman led him awaited some
[1:25:37] Philistine men
[1:25:38] like a little whipped puppy
[1:25:40] there was a difference in Samson under
[1:25:42] the anointing in Samson without the
[1:25:44] anointing
[1:25:47] sir
[1:25:48] there's something about it God can
[1:25:51] anoint a man and you talk about my as a
[1:25:53] minister of the Gospel these Minister
[1:25:54] Brothers Here know what it's like and
[1:25:55] can relate to it and when we hear
[1:25:57] Brothers make statements and and then we
[1:25:59] know in our own little Ministries what
[1:26:01] it's like what it must have been to him
[1:26:02] to where there's been times that you
[1:26:05] know you feel such a brother man would
[1:26:06] call it a super anointing and you feel
[1:26:08] so anointed of God and you see God do
[1:26:10] things I've stood in prayer lines and
[1:26:12] seen demons cast out of people brother
[1:26:14] brother Wayne's been in in Indians seen
[1:26:17] demon-possessed people the spirits cast
[1:26:19] off of them and delivered when you stand
[1:26:21] in a prayer line and pray for somebody
[1:26:23] with a huge tumor on their head and the
[1:26:25] next day they send you a picture and
[1:26:27] that tumor is not there anymore you say
[1:26:29] oh God thank you that that power is
[1:26:32] still there of the resurrection and then
[1:26:34] you come out from under that and you're
[1:26:35] just Nathan Brian again
[1:26:38] when you felt like you could run through
[1:26:40] a troop and leap over a wall
[1:26:42] and then the Devil comes and says who Do
[1:26:44] You Think You Are
[1:26:49] it's a battle yes right
[1:26:52] yeah yes sir and you take our humble
[1:26:54] Ministries and you compare that to
[1:26:55] brother randoms where he said he said an
[1:26:58] hour of preaching be like eight hours
[1:26:59] with the sledgehammer and then he said
[1:27:01] one of those Visions would do more than
[1:27:03] preaching preaching two or three hours
[1:27:05] and he'd have maybe a dozen Visions
[1:27:07] maybe 20 30 Visions a night I need to go
[1:27:10] out and be so delirious they'd have to
[1:27:11] drive him around try to get him back to
[1:27:13] himself hey so now when you're way up
[1:27:14] here it's fine and when you're way down
[1:27:16] here it's fine but when you're coming
[1:27:17] down between those two that's when it's
[1:27:18] hard
[1:27:19] and we recognize what this that's like a
[1:27:21] little bit in a and maybe an amateur
[1:27:24] form as Minister brothers that you come
[1:27:26] out from another day I've walked off the
[1:27:27] platform at our church and gone out and
[1:27:29] there's a little stairwell you go out
[1:27:31] the back side of the pulpit here and go
[1:27:33] down the stairs I've sat on the stairs
[1:27:35] and wept after a sermon and think oh God
[1:27:40] why because I felt like I was could run
[1:27:42] through a troop and leap over a wall up
[1:27:43] here but you get down there and then the
[1:27:45] devil begins to bombard you
[1:27:48] who Do You Think You Are
[1:27:50] as Believers and especially as ministers
[1:27:53] and as pastors many times the devil will
[1:27:56] will bombard us with an imposter
[1:27:58] syndrome
[1:27:59] oh yeah yeah yeah you look at what
[1:28:02] you've done but all those people really
[1:28:04] knew if they knew who you used to be or
[1:28:07] if they knew some of the things that you
[1:28:09] battle in your mind how that the devil
[1:28:11] tormentioned things and he'll get on our
[1:28:13] back but you know what I say I didn't
[1:28:15] choose me
[1:28:16] he chose me
[1:28:22] a brother stood out here in this
[1:28:23] entryway last night he said brother he
[1:28:25] said there's no doubt in my mind that
[1:28:26] God chose you to be in the area that
[1:28:28] you're at and I said oh but it was I
[1:28:30] wouldn't have chosen I wouldn't have
[1:28:33] chose it
[1:28:34] I won't say I there was nowhere else in
[1:28:36] the world that uh that I wouldn't have
[1:28:38] picked over it I guess I would rather
[1:28:40] Pastor where I'm at than Siberia or
[1:28:42] China or Russia there's places but I
[1:28:45] don't know anywhere in the United States
[1:28:46] that I wouldn't have picked over where
[1:28:47] God called me to I grew up there I knew
[1:28:51] what I was up against I didn't want to
[1:28:52] choose that but God chose it and we look
[1:28:55] at it many times and we try to figure it
[1:28:56] all out but God does the choosing
[1:29:00] perfect strength again 1961. we've got
[1:29:03] to get away from that human ability
[1:29:05] we got to get to a place where we can
[1:29:08] surrender our souls and lives even to
[1:29:10] the housewife to the farmer to the
[1:29:13] mechanic or whoever we are got to
[1:29:15] surrender completely to God and know
[1:29:17] that we are nothing
[1:29:21] me and myself I am nothing but me and
[1:29:24] Jesus that's a different story you and
[1:29:26] yourself you're nothing but you and
[1:29:28] Jesus that's a different story
[1:29:30] then let God start from there he says
[1:29:33] then he starts moving working and that
[1:29:35] includes all of us everyone that's the
[1:29:38] thing that we got to do we've got to get
[1:29:41] to a spot where we realize God it's not
[1:29:44] me I can't just walk out here and pull
[1:29:46] myself over the Moon by my bootstraps
[1:29:49] and say look what I've accomplished and
[1:29:51] look what I did but if I can get in a
[1:29:52] spot where I'm so surrendered to him and
[1:29:54] maybe sometimes we say oh God please
[1:29:56] don't make me do that God please don't
[1:29:58] make me say that but he's leading us and
[1:30:00] he's moving then we say well God it's
[1:30:02] you and Lord even if it's hard sometimes
[1:30:04] there's times as pastors we sit and
[1:30:06] counsel people and you know what they
[1:30:08] want you to tell them but you can't tell
[1:30:10] them that because it's contrary to the
[1:30:12] word
[1:30:13] and knowing that they might get mad and
[1:30:15] walk off and leave the church I've had
[1:30:16] people they want you to tell them that
[1:30:18] they can get remarried and all these
[1:30:20] things and marriage and divorce
[1:30:21] situations and if you don't tell it to
[1:30:22] him they're going to go find somebody
[1:30:24] that'll tell it to him but you have to
[1:30:26] stay with the word
[1:30:29] and people think oh you're so cruel no
[1:30:31] I'm just doing my best to stay with the
[1:30:33] truth
[1:30:34] and it's hard the decisions we have to
[1:30:36] make sometimes as Pastor Brothers people
[1:30:39] don't realize as we were talking about
[1:30:40] last night about covet and different
[1:30:42] things and decisions that you have to
[1:30:44] make knowing there'll be people sitting
[1:30:46] there that absolutely disagree and
[1:30:48] knowing no matter what you do you're up
[1:30:49] against the situation there's going to
[1:30:51] be somebody that disagrees with it no
[1:30:53] matter what you do
[1:30:55] so you just do what the biggest
[1:30:57] tithepayer says right no
[1:31:00] now you have to follow the leading of
[1:31:02] the Lord
[1:31:03] you have to get to a spot where you say
[1:31:06] God this may not be popular this may not
[1:31:09] be received well but I know this is the
[1:31:12] direction that you're leading and then
[1:31:14] you can sit back and say it was you Lord
[1:31:15] so I put it in your hands
[1:31:20] there's things many times I wish that I
[1:31:22] could say I wish that I could just come
[1:31:23] out and just take it under control and
[1:31:25] say well bless God this is the way it's
[1:31:27] going to be and I wish sometimes I can
[1:31:28] just take a situation and just
[1:31:30] straighten it all out and say here it is
[1:31:32] but God if God didn't call you to do
[1:31:33] that you be careful you'll be like that
[1:31:35] man that reached out and said all the
[1:31:36] ark's fall and I'm going to reach and
[1:31:38] grab it and fix this situation and it
[1:31:40] got him in a lot of trouble
[1:31:42] yet with good intentions
[1:31:45] but contrary to the word of God
[1:31:49] I want to look at this scripture this is
[1:31:51] during the Last Supper
[1:31:54] the scripture we read it you know at the
[1:31:56] communion Services over and over many
[1:31:59] times scriptures like that that we read
[1:32:00] a lot it just becomes common to us and
[1:32:03] we lose the depth of what it's really
[1:32:04] saying but Saint John Chapter 13 Verse 3
[1:32:07] it said Jesus knowing that the father
[1:32:11] had given all things into his hands and
[1:32:14] that he was come from God and went to
[1:32:15] God I asked our church recently if this
[1:32:18] verse if this was said about you
[1:32:21] if this was written up here and Nathan
[1:32:24] knowing that the father had given all
[1:32:25] things into his hands and then he was
[1:32:27] come from God and went to God what would
[1:32:29] the next part of this verse say about us
[1:32:32] what would the next verse say if God had
[1:32:34] given all things into our hands and we
[1:32:36] had power to do what we want to do what
[1:32:38] would the next verse say would we Smite
[1:32:39] our enemies blind or or or would we run
[1:32:42] somebody out of the church or or would
[1:32:45] we go heal somebody that we wanted to
[1:32:46] see healed or what would we do but look
[1:32:49] what he does knowing this
[1:32:51] knowing that all things had been given
[1:32:53] into his hands that he was come from God
[1:32:55] and went to God he riseth from supper
[1:32:58] and laid aside his garments and took a
[1:33:02] towel and girded himself
[1:33:04] knowing that he had absolute power and
[1:33:08] authority he humbles himself and he gets
[1:33:11] down on his knees and he begins to wash
[1:33:13] the feet of disciples
[1:33:16] and I want to say they hadn't been to
[1:33:18] Bed Bath and Beyond or Bath and Body
[1:33:21] Works or whatever it is and got him some
[1:33:22] nice lotions for their feet their feet
[1:33:25] didn't smell nice
[1:33:27] their their feet hadn't been bathed and
[1:33:30] manicured that stinking fisherman
[1:33:33] they didn't have nice paved roads they
[1:33:35] were out there on mud roads they didn't
[1:33:38] have a they didn't have Teslas or Fords
[1:33:41] they had some old uh donkeys that they
[1:33:44] didn't fill them up at the gas station
[1:33:45] but they might empty out there on the
[1:33:47] road
[1:33:48] and they walked on those roads
[1:33:51] and they put their feet in that water
[1:33:52] sometimes the sisters you know it's
[1:33:54] Brothers at church the sisters go down
[1:33:56] and watch feet first in the basement
[1:33:57] there and then the brothers come down
[1:33:58] and sometimes you can tell a sister had
[1:34:00] a new pair of stockings because they're
[1:34:01] just lint floating all in that tub
[1:34:03] I think well at least it's not donkey
[1:34:06] manure
[1:34:10] didn't say they had
[1:34:12] 12 basins there where every disciple got
[1:34:15] a fresh Basin of water
[1:34:20] that 12th disciples said oh Lord
[1:34:27] and we we think something oh I don't
[1:34:28] want to watch this brother's feet or
[1:34:30] that sister's feet
[1:34:32] and the King of Kings and the Lord of
[1:34:34] lords
[1:34:35] knowing that he came from God and
[1:34:38] knowing that he was going back to God
[1:34:39] and that all things had been given unto
[1:34:41] him he kneels down and he begins to wash
[1:34:44] the feet of the disciples why because he
[1:34:46] was the right kind of leader he wasn't
[1:34:48] leading by saying now you go do this and
[1:34:50] you go do this and you go do that and
[1:34:52] I'm going to lead from behind like a lot
[1:34:54] of these so-called leaders but he led by
[1:34:56] example that he said I've given you an
[1:34:59] example that as I've done to you you
[1:35:01] also ought to do to one another
[1:35:03] I know he was talking about washing feet
[1:35:06] but I don't believe he was just talking
[1:35:07] about that he said the perfect example
[1:35:10] of how we should treat one another how
[1:35:12] we should love one another how we should
[1:35:14] pray for one another how we should be
[1:35:16] long-suffering with one another he set
[1:35:18] an example that we should be that same
[1:35:20] type of Christians
[1:35:23] knowing that he had this power and he
[1:35:26] humbles himself to be a servant
[1:35:29] God help us
[1:35:32] God help us again perfect strength by
[1:35:34] Perfect weakness we've got to get
[1:35:37] ourselves and our abilities out of the
[1:35:40] way and surrendered to the will and
[1:35:41] power of God say well brother I can
[1:35:44] preach he can't use that as long as you
[1:35:46] can preach
[1:35:48] that's sort of I can do this I can do
[1:35:50] that you can't do nothing
[1:35:53] amen
[1:35:55] well then God can't use it but if you
[1:35:57] yield yourself to God and let him do you
[1:35:59] know I'm a teacher well as long as
[1:36:01] you're the teacher why he won't get very
[1:36:04] far
[1:36:06] what is it it's the Holy Spirit doing
[1:36:08] those things
[1:36:10] brother Banner would say it this way to
[1:36:11] a group of preachers there at the
[1:36:13] Tabernacle one time they're having a
[1:36:14] little meeting and he's answering some
[1:36:16] of their questions and he said Brothers
[1:36:18] he said if you've really been anointed
[1:36:21] he said then you never preached a sermon
[1:36:23] in your life
[1:36:25] he didn't mean that away the way that
[1:36:27] some message folks would take it today
[1:36:28] oh they had got up behind a Pulpit and
[1:36:31] they had preached but it wasn't them
[1:36:33] that was doing the talking
[1:36:35] it was the Holy Spirit anointing them
[1:36:38] again perfect strength by Perfect
[1:36:40] weakness so as long as we're trying on
[1:36:42] ourselves and depending on our own
[1:36:44] ability and so forth while we'll do
[1:36:46] nothing
[1:36:48] but when we get to a place where we know
[1:36:50] we're nothing then God can use us
[1:36:55] remember he would save that man
[1:36:58] he said that that preacher got up before
[1:37:00] the Pentecostal preacher and began to
[1:37:01] use all these great swelling words and
[1:37:03] things and he said he realized it wasn't
[1:37:05] going over with the people and he said
[1:37:07] he came down off the platform with his
[1:37:08] head down and his shoulder slumped and a
[1:37:10] man sitting in front of brother Brandon
[1:37:12] turned around and said if he would have
[1:37:13] went up the way he came down
[1:37:15] he would have came down the way he went
[1:37:17] up
[1:37:18] you see the Way Up Is Down
[1:37:21] First Corinthians chapter 2 verse 1
[1:37:25] . Saint Paul says and I came and I
[1:37:27] Brethren when I came to you
[1:37:29] came not with Excellency of speech or of
[1:37:33] wisdom declaring unto you the testimony
[1:37:36] of God now if Peter had said this we'd
[1:37:38] say well yeah we know Peter you don't
[1:37:41] have the ability but see Paul had the
[1:37:43] human ability to be able to do that he
[1:37:46] could have got up and preached a great
[1:37:48] sermonette and brother Branham said
[1:37:49] we're getting tired of sermonettes by
[1:37:51] preacherettes and all that you know and
[1:37:53] and he said oh he could have he could
[1:37:56] Paul could have got up and said these
[1:37:58] things he had great swelling words and
[1:37:59] he had wisdom and he had the speech and
[1:38:01] the vocabulary and the knowledge of
[1:38:03] multiple languages and things but he he
[1:38:05] didn't use that when he came to tell him
[1:38:07] the testimony of God for I determined
[1:38:09] not to know anything among you saved
[1:38:11] Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was
[1:38:14] with you in weakness and in fear
[1:38:18] and in much trembling
[1:38:20] when we think of an evangelist to invite
[1:38:22] those are the three qualities that we
[1:38:24] automatically think of right
[1:38:27] I want a guy that's going to come in
[1:38:28] weakness
[1:38:29] and in fear and in trembling
[1:38:33] this is how Paul came to them why
[1:38:35] because he wasn't depending on Paul's
[1:38:37] ability
[1:38:40] and my speech and my preaching was not
[1:38:42] with enticing words of man's Wisdom but
[1:38:45] in demonstration of the power of the
[1:38:48] spirit and of power that your faith
[1:38:50] should not stand in the wisdom of men
[1:38:52] but in the power of God
[1:38:56] my desire is that people would not look
[1:38:59] and say oh my what a great something
[1:39:00] brother Nathan oh look how he can
[1:39:02] memorize look how he can do this without
[1:39:03] my desire would be that when I leave a
[1:39:05] meeting whether it be back at home or
[1:39:07] out like this that somebody would say I
[1:39:09] know that wasn't that man
[1:39:11] I know that man didn't know those things
[1:39:13] about me I know that man didn't know
[1:39:15] what I needed so I know that that wasn't
[1:39:18] that man then I don't get the glory but
[1:39:19] he gets the glory that your faith
[1:39:22] doesn't Rest In the Flesh of a man
[1:39:24] because let me tell you if you place
[1:39:25] I've seen Brothers you know we place it
[1:39:28] off in the Catholic Church sir we place
[1:39:30] it off in the denominations but there's
[1:39:31] men right around the message that they
[1:39:33] begin to place their their their trust
[1:39:36] and their confidence in the arm of Flesh
[1:39:38] and they begin to lean on other brothers
[1:39:39] and then when that brother fails or it
[1:39:41] leaves the message or makes a mistake or
[1:39:44] disappoints them or discourages them
[1:39:46] then their whole spiritual walk is just
[1:39:48] devastated
[1:39:50] because they were looking to the Flesh
[1:39:52] of a man instead of looking to Jesus
[1:39:54] Christ
[1:39:56] I've had people come to me and say
[1:39:58] brother Nathan we were baptized by
[1:39:59] brother so and so he doesn't even
[1:40:01] believe the message anymore or we were
[1:40:03] married by brother so and so on he he
[1:40:05] fell into sin out here should we go be
[1:40:07] re-baptized again or should we go get
[1:40:09] remarried again I asked him well was she
[1:40:11] baptized in that man's name
[1:40:14] no I was baptized in Jesus name
[1:40:17] well then that man didn't have anything
[1:40:19] to do with it he was just standing there
[1:40:20] when it happened
[1:40:23] did you marry that brother no he just
[1:40:25] read some vows over me and my wife then
[1:40:27] it had nothing to do it was not a union
[1:40:29] with that man it was a union between you
[1:40:32] and your bride
[1:40:33] when you got saved in that man's meeting
[1:40:35] did he save you no Jesus saved me well
[1:40:37] then it wasn't him and you he was just
[1:40:39] creating an atmosphere that you happen
[1:40:41] to get hatched out under
[1:40:44] oh I got the Holy Ghost and brothers
[1:40:45] so-and-so's meeting and he's an atheist
[1:40:47] now well can you imagine being in the
[1:40:49] upper room 120 of them sitting there and
[1:40:52] you lean over here hey brother how did
[1:40:54] you hear about this well I'm a little
[1:40:55] ashamed to say it but Judas came by our
[1:40:57] village one day
[1:41:00] and signs and wonders was following as a
[1:41:02] Ministry and I never heard anything like
[1:41:05] that before
[1:41:06] and it got my attention
[1:41:09] and that's how I got here
[1:41:11] hey God used a god used an old donkey to
[1:41:14] speak through one time
[1:41:18] that donkey didn't even have a soul
[1:41:24] but we put God in a box you've got to
[1:41:26] come this way Lord you got to do it this
[1:41:28] way and do that way
[1:41:29] hey I
[1:41:31] I'll just be a little transparent here
[1:41:33] this morning we're working to a close I
[1:41:35] promise give me about five more minutes
[1:41:36] and we'll that's our estimated time of
[1:41:39] departure
[1:41:40] ah
[1:41:42] I'm not a big Joel Osteen fan I'll be
[1:41:44] honest
[1:41:46] I'm not in his fan club but
[1:41:49] but I I used to you know be a little
[1:41:50] derogatory in things and say you know
[1:41:52] different things but we got a family at
[1:41:54] our church that they had they'd been
[1:41:56] raised in the message and they went way
[1:41:58] out in the world way out in the world
[1:42:02] and they begin to visit our church
[1:42:04] because their daughters have began to
[1:42:05] get into some trouble and they wanted to
[1:42:07] get them around good Christian friends
[1:42:08] and their plan was just we were just
[1:42:09] going to drop them off and then we're
[1:42:11] going to go do our own worldly thing and
[1:42:15] and the man would sit in the back of the
[1:42:17] the congregation the song service tears
[1:42:20] would be begin to run down his cheek and
[1:42:22] think what Earth am I crying and God
[1:42:24] began to get a hold of their life and
[1:42:25] begin to turn him around but prior to
[1:42:27] that they'd been in a situation in their
[1:42:29] marriage where they they had almost got
[1:42:31] divorced several times and things that
[1:42:33] got bad and he'd left the house several
[1:42:34] times and and stayed away and then he'd
[1:42:37] come back sometimes and she'd tell him
[1:42:38] you can come back but you're sleeping on
[1:42:39] the couch in the basement and and that
[1:42:41] their marriage was in a bad place and he
[1:42:44] went down to Texas with a worldly
[1:42:46] co-worker
[1:42:47] and they began to work at a job that
[1:42:49] they were Contracting at down there and
[1:42:51] the guy said hey I'm just going to go
[1:42:52] over this Joel Osteen guys church and
[1:42:54] check it out and the man got saved at
[1:42:57] Joel's team's Church
[1:42:58] and the man came back to Louisville
[1:43:00] Kentucky and he began to go to eat at
[1:43:02] him they've branched out into some other
[1:43:04] things but but anyhow this man began to
[1:43:07] attend that church and when there when
[1:43:08] when the couple from our church before
[1:43:10] they started attending our church and
[1:43:12] their marriage was almost just
[1:43:13] completely devastated and they they left
[1:43:16] each other the man left the house and he
[1:43:18] said I'm done I just give up this man
[1:43:20] who'd been saved at Joel Osteen's Church
[1:43:22] begged him said will you please just let
[1:43:24] me sit down and talk to you and her and
[1:43:27] he began to talk to him he said can't
[1:43:29] you see how much that she's hurting and
[1:43:31] that she just doesn't understand you and
[1:43:33] you just don't understand her and he
[1:43:34] began to work with them and got their
[1:43:36] marriage restored
[1:43:38] didn't come the way I would have planned
[1:43:39] it
[1:43:40] didn't come the way I expected it didn't
[1:43:42] come the way I would have chose it but
[1:43:44] God can use whatever he wants to use
[1:43:47] [Applause]
[1:43:52] brother banham had a friend there in New
[1:43:53] Albany
[1:43:54] near where our church is at at Main
[1:43:56] Street Methodist church he called him
[1:43:58] brother Johnson he was a Methodist
[1:44:00] preacher he said brother Johnson when
[1:44:01] he's witnessing to somebody and and they
[1:44:03] want to get baptized he said well go
[1:44:05] down to my friend Billy he'll drown you
[1:44:07] and then he said when I'm witnessing
[1:44:09] somebody and they said well I was raised
[1:44:10] Methodist and I want to go to Methodist
[1:44:12] Church he said I sent him down to
[1:44:13] brother Johnson say it's a little dry
[1:44:14] down there not a whole lot of water but
[1:44:16] you can go on down there
[1:44:18] you mean a prophet of God would do that
[1:44:21] look at the example of our Lord Jesus
[1:44:26] everybody couldn't be a Peter
[1:44:29] he didn't hand the keys to the kingdom
[1:44:31] to everybody
[1:44:33] but there were 10 lepers one time and he
[1:44:35] healed all 10 of them knowing that only
[1:44:37] one was going to come back and he was
[1:44:39] going to be able to help him further but
[1:44:41] he helped the other ones as far as they
[1:44:43] would let him help them I wonder if
[1:44:46] that's our attitude or if we say well if
[1:44:48] you'll come this way and you'll do it
[1:44:49] this way and you'll do that then we'll
[1:44:50] have you I want to help anybody I can
[1:44:52] just as far as they'll let me help them
[1:44:54] yeah
[1:44:55] there's people in our area that'll
[1:44:58] probably never sit at our church maybe
[1:45:00] never sit under my Ministry but there's
[1:45:02] been times maybe three or four o'clock
[1:45:03] in the morning get a phone call brother
[1:45:05] Nathan please pray my son or my daughter
[1:45:07] has run away from home I could say hey
[1:45:09] you don't go to our church
[1:45:11] that'd really be the spirit of Christ
[1:45:12] wouldn't it
[1:45:14] hey you don't even believe like me
[1:45:17] but I go to prayer for him why because
[1:45:19] that same spirit that was in Christ
[1:45:21] compels me I'll help you just as far as
[1:45:23] you'll let me help you
[1:45:26] second Corinthians chapter 12 and verse
[1:45:28] 7 and lest I should be exalted above
[1:45:31] measure through the abundance of the
[1:45:33] revelations that there was given to me a
[1:45:35] thorn in the flesh the messenger of
[1:45:38] Satan to buff at me lest I should be
[1:45:40] exalted above measure for this thing I
[1:45:42] besought the Lord Thrice that it might
[1:45:44] depart from me and he said unto me my
[1:45:48] grace is sufficient for thee
[1:45:51] for my strength is made perfect in
[1:45:53] weakness
[1:45:55] you realize this is one of the great
[1:45:57] things that separated Judas from the
[1:45:59] rest of the Depo of the Apostles brother
[1:46:01] random said that that where Judas lost
[1:46:04] out was at Pentecost
[1:46:05] yeah
[1:46:06] but Jesus didn't even make it to
[1:46:08] Pentecost so we think well how does that
[1:46:09] even make sense but see Judas got to a
[1:46:12] spot he he I just read it to the church
[1:46:14] Wednesday night if you go back and read
[1:46:15] the Bible it actually says that when
[1:46:17] Judas realized what he had done he came
[1:46:20] and repented
[1:46:22] anybody know that Judas repented
[1:46:25] and I looked at that word and I thought
[1:46:26] surely to goodness brother Duane that
[1:46:28] can't be the same word that's used in
[1:46:30] Acts 2 38 so I looked it up and it's two
[1:46:31] different Greek words and one is brother
[1:46:34] random talks about is a change of heart
[1:46:36] a change of mind a changing of
[1:46:38] directions that's what happened on the
[1:46:40] day of Pentecost but the other is that
[1:46:42] after the fact they regret what they did
[1:46:44] and they're sorry for it and that's
[1:46:47] where I think a lot of people don't get
[1:46:48] to the Holy Ghost they come to an altar
[1:46:50] and they say I'm sorry for what I did
[1:46:52] yesterday Lord and I'll probably do the
[1:46:54] same thing again tomorrow but here I am
[1:46:56] I'm repenting
[1:46:58] come on brother
[1:46:59] it's real good and Judas regretted what
[1:47:01] he did but he was going to be Judas the
[1:47:03] next day
[1:47:04] he didn't want to he loved Judas too
[1:47:07] much to change Judas and he didn't think
[1:47:10] that that his grace was sufficient to be
[1:47:13] able to forgive a guy like him he didn't
[1:47:15] think there was enough Grace to forgive
[1:47:17] what he had done but Peter denied him
[1:47:19] three times and he said go tell my
[1:47:22] disciples and Peter
[1:47:25] Paul prays three times God take this
[1:47:28] thing from me and he didn't say okay
[1:47:30] Paul because you asked I'm just going to
[1:47:31] take it away he said my grace is
[1:47:34] sufficient
[1:47:36] I want to say this morning his grace is
[1:47:38] sufficient for whatever you're going
[1:47:39] through
[1:47:40] his grace is sufficient to cover your
[1:47:42] past his grace is sufficient his grace
[1:47:45] has made a way back for you this morning
[1:47:48] his grace provided a way back to Calvary
[1:47:51] for us my grace is sufficient for thee
[1:47:54] for my strength is made perfect in
[1:47:56] weakness most gladly therefore I will
[1:47:58] rather glory in my infirmities that the
[1:48:01] power of Christ May rest upon me that
[1:48:04] man there they said was it his sin or
[1:48:06] his daddy's or his mommies they wanted
[1:48:07] to figure out who was to blame and Jesus
[1:48:09] said it wasn't none of that it was that
[1:48:11] God could be the glory of God could be
[1:48:13] made manifest
[1:48:16] many times in our life we go through
[1:48:17] things I've had people come to me and
[1:48:19] and come and sit in our church maybe
[1:48:20] move from other areas or come from other
[1:48:22] churches and things and and they said
[1:48:24] brother I feel like I've wasted the last
[1:48:26] 12 years of my life because things
[1:48:27] didn't wind up exactly the way they had
[1:48:29] planned at their old church I said you
[1:48:32] didn't waste your time the footsteps of
[1:48:33] the righteous are ordered of the Lord
[1:48:36] the Lord has to bring us my dad was
[1:48:38] raised Pentecostal and then he backslid
[1:48:40] and then he married a Methodist girl and
[1:48:42] they went to a Methodist church and then
[1:48:43] he started going to the Pentecostal
[1:48:44] church and then they came to the message
[1:48:45] why didn't God just bypass all that and
[1:48:47] just bring him to the message you think
[1:48:49] those years were wasted no God Was
[1:48:51] preparing them and bringing them along
[1:48:53] and taking them from truth to truth
[1:48:56] because that's what the Holy Spirit
[1:48:57] promised he do he'd lead us and guide us
[1:48:59] into all truth and there's some people
[1:49:01] that couldn't have just received this
[1:49:02] right away God had to kind of ease him
[1:49:03] into it
[1:49:05] there are some people that maybe they
[1:49:07] could have received it but they had to
[1:49:08] meet people along their way that they
[1:49:10] could be a help to once they saw the
[1:49:12] truth God knows what he's doing
[1:49:15] these things aren't always our choice
[1:49:17] but God's choice is exactly right let me
[1:49:20] read you this last quote musicians if
[1:49:22] you'd come we'll close this morning
[1:49:25] again perfect strength by Perfect
[1:49:27] weakness God's strategy
[1:49:30] is to take empty human vessels
[1:49:33] and shake the world with them
[1:49:36] that's what God is doing in this age
[1:49:39] if you're full of yourself if you're
[1:49:42] full of doctrines or full of ideas or
[1:49:45] full of your own ability he can't use
[1:49:47] you but when you get so empty that God
[1:49:49] I'm sick of it all I'm sick of my own
[1:49:51] thoughts I'm sick of my own failures I'm
[1:49:54] sick of my own opinions I'm sick of my
[1:49:56] own ideas it always winds up wrong I
[1:49:59] wind up like Moses out there trying to
[1:50:01] take things in my own hands but God I'm
[1:50:03] so sick of it I want to lay it all here
[1:50:05] and just leave it and I want to empty
[1:50:07] out so much that then you can come in
[1:50:09] then God can do something with you
[1:50:12] his strategy is to take empty-human
[1:50:15] vessels and shake the world with them
[1:50:18] that's Bower heads this morning
[1:50:21] wonder how many slip up your hands say
[1:50:22] brother Nathan
[1:50:24] I don't want it to be me
[1:50:26] I know there's nothing in me that's good
[1:50:29] but help me to be that kind of vessel
[1:50:31] that you're talking about this morning
[1:50:32] help me Lord let me empty so completely
[1:50:35] out that he could come and fill me so
[1:50:38] that he could do something through me
[1:50:40] God there's people at my at my work
[1:50:43] there's people at my school there's
[1:50:44] people in my family that they need to
[1:50:47] see the truth Lord how will they see it
[1:50:49] if they don't see it in me maybe they'll
[1:50:52] never pick up a Bible maybe they'll
[1:50:53] never attend the message church but God
[1:50:55] may they see a little bit of Jesus in me
[1:50:58] hands all over the building the Lord
[1:51:00] sees each one let's go to prayer
[1:51:02] Heavenly Father
[1:51:03] Lord Jesus
[1:51:06] so many times Lord we we get so educated
[1:51:10] even of things that are truth
[1:51:12] if we're not careful it begins to be
[1:51:14] about us and what we know
[1:51:17] and what we can do but God help us
[1:51:20] help us Lord to stay humble
[1:51:23] help us to realize it's not within us
[1:51:26] it's not our ability it's not within our
[1:51:28] power it's not within our grasp
[1:51:31] but it's only what you can do if we'll
[1:51:33] empty ourselves up
[1:51:35] so that you can do something through us
[1:51:37] help us to conquer that thought of human
[1:51:40] ability that Lord we we get to a spot
[1:51:42] where we recognize lord it's not us
[1:51:45] it wasn't because we were better than
[1:51:47] the Baptist or better than the Methodist
[1:51:49] or better than the Catholic it wasn't
[1:51:51] because we were smarter than the
[1:51:53] Presbyterian or The Seventh-Day
[1:51:55] Adventist or the Jehovah Witness but
[1:51:57] lord it's just because you chose us
[1:52:01] it was just your choosing there were
[1:52:03] people in our area that were better than
[1:52:06] me they had a better record they had a
[1:52:08] better history than me God you could
[1:52:10] have chose them
[1:52:12] God but you chose me
[1:52:14] what can I say except thank you Jesus
[1:52:17] for your grace
[1:52:19] thank you for your mercy
[1:52:22] thank you that you'd look down on me and
[1:52:25] you look beyond my faults
[1:52:27] and see that there was a need there that
[1:52:29] there was
[1:52:31] there was a predestinated seat as you
[1:52:33] had need to go by Samaria
[1:52:36] Lord you had need to go by these other
[1:52:38] places and pick us up maybe you found
[1:52:39] some on a bar stool may you maybe you
[1:52:42] found some in an alley Lord somewhere
[1:52:44] all muddled up maybe you found them on a
[1:52:47] denominational Pew or maybe you found
[1:52:49] him in a message Church all confused by
[1:52:51] false Doctrine Lord wherever it was Lord
[1:52:54] I'm so thankful that you reached down
[1:52:56] your hand and found us
[1:53:00] so then what can the clay say oh my look
[1:53:02] what a what a beautiful vase I've made
[1:53:05] myself into it wasn't us it was just the
[1:53:08] gentle hand of the Potter taking us back
[1:53:10] to the wheel and molding us and shaping
[1:53:13] us
[1:53:14] into what he had seen in his eyes into
[1:53:17] what his choice for us would be help us
[1:53:20] Lord may we may we be flexible that the
[1:53:24] Potter can mold us into his image
[1:53:26] into what he saw this as brother random
[1:53:29] would say there God had an image of you
[1:53:31] in his mind before the foundation of the
[1:53:33] world
[1:53:34] God may we step into that image of what
[1:53:37] she'd have us to be may we step into the
[1:53:39] calling you'd have for us not just to
[1:53:41] pastors and evangelists and and teachers
[1:53:44] Lord but to the housewife to the
[1:53:46] mechanic to the plumber to the carpenter
[1:53:48] to whatever it be Lord to the computer
[1:53:50] programmer or whatever it would be
[1:53:52] father may they find their place in the
[1:53:54] body that they have a part to do they
[1:53:56] can come and pull on the gift in a man's
[1:53:58] life they can come and raise their hands
[1:54:00] and worship you and create an atmosphere
[1:54:03] that when the minister steps to the
[1:54:04] platform they'll be such a presence of
[1:54:07] the Holy Spirit and such an atmosphere
[1:54:09] of the Lord that it just makes it so
[1:54:11] easy for him to step into a channel and
[1:54:13] begin to use their part of the body
[1:54:16] God help us may we not fight against
[1:54:18] each other may we not be fighting
[1:54:20] against those that are packing the ball
[1:54:22] but may we get behind it and support it
[1:54:24] the Lord these brothers that are
[1:54:26] represented here Lord bless their
[1:54:28] churches Lord and may their churches get
[1:54:30] behind them and support them and and
[1:54:32] instead of trying to be contentious or
[1:54:34] or trying to question and tear down
[1:54:37] everything they do may they catch a
[1:54:39] vision of Lord the the desire in that
[1:54:41] man's heart and and Lord the motives and
[1:54:44] the objectives that he has for the
[1:54:46] kingdom of God and may they get behind
[1:54:48] it and support it with their prayers and
[1:54:50] their tithes and their offerings and
[1:54:52] every ability that they have to put
[1:54:54] behind it Lord may we work together as a
[1:54:56] body may we not be some disjointed
[1:54:59] confused something but Lord may we work
[1:55:01] together for the kingdom of God
[1:55:04] help us Jesus
[1:55:07] Let each one do their part Lord and then
[1:55:09] may they not look at the other and try
[1:55:11] to judge their part by theirs and
[1:55:12] compare one to another may we not get a
[1:55:15] spirit of jealousy Upon Us Lord but may
[1:55:17] we say thank you God for my brother
[1:55:19] thank you for my sister Lord if you're
[1:55:21] using them in that way Lord maybe you
[1:55:23] couldn't use me in that way but thank
[1:55:24] you for it God bless them continue to
[1:55:26] bless them thank you Lord and if they're
[1:55:28] down or they're discouraged Lord help us
[1:55:31] not to push them down further but Lord

[1:55:35] help us to encourage them when they need

[2:11:39] [Music]
[2:11:43] you know I
[2:11:46] is here this weekend
[2:11:47] I was out mowing the grass as well
[2:11:50] wasn't pushing it riding it
[2:11:53] but you know just something struck in a
[2:11:55] way with the brand said when John
[2:11:59] he said what John looked and saw
[2:12:03] John saw himself
[2:12:06] he saw his representation
[2:12:10] John said I see me
[2:12:14] you know that's a reality when we
[2:12:16] see our name
[2:12:18] it's not a name that's wrote out here in
[2:12:21] the scripture
[2:12:22] but we see the very character of the
[2:12:24] word of Christ himself
[2:12:26] being made manifest and it just
[2:12:28] resonates and identifies right here
[2:12:30] [Music]
[2:12:31] and just like John the prophet said when
[2:12:35] you have heard
[2:12:36] this message
[2:12:39] you've left the other thing and it has
[2:12:42] become Eagle food to you
[2:12:45] then
[2:12:46] heard from your theophany
[2:12:49] what is that I looked and seen me my
[2:12:54] representation
[2:12:56] and that's what the word of God
[2:12:59] continues to Hold Up Before You and I
[2:13:02] there's only one thing that can divide
[2:13:04] and separate you from you and that's him
[2:13:08] because that part that he placed in you
[2:13:11] and I that's really him
[2:13:14] that's really him and just like you can
[2:13:17] look down pictures and begin to see oh
[2:13:20] I got Mama's nose or I got Daddy's ears
[2:13:24] or I got this stature this or that but
[2:13:26] you know when we look in this time that
[2:13:29] we're living in and we see our lives
[2:13:31] it's the same Jesus Christ being made
[2:13:35] manifest in our lives
[2:13:38] and there's certain things you can see
[2:13:39] in pictures now that you might have said
[2:13:42] oh I don't want Daddy's nose
[2:13:44] or I don't want Mama's ears but you just
[2:13:46] give time
[2:13:47] and certain things begin to show up
[2:13:51] and that's the same way it is within our
[2:13:53] life the Bible said grow in Grace
[2:13:57] and we continue to yield to him it's God
[2:14:00] bringing out that choice
[2:14:02] his choice on the inside
[2:14:06] oh God is so good it's all about us
[2:14:10] yielding and getting out of the way we
[2:14:11] we want the man of God we want the
[2:14:13] minister to stand here and yield and get
[2:14:15] out of the way and that's the same way
[2:14:16] that when we're listening to the word in
[2:14:18] every moment of our life God help me to
[2:14:20] get out of the way because just as a
[2:14:23] minister could stand here in their
[2:14:24] things that
[2:14:25] God sometimes will keep from him that
[2:14:27] he'll say when he's standing right here
[2:14:29] sometimes it'll keep pressing like
[2:14:31] brother Nathan had said and then there's
[2:14:32] other times where he's studying on
[2:14:34] things oh God he's praying God give me
[2:14:36] Grace give me Grace the whole thing
[2:14:38] within it is to yield and I'll tell you
[2:14:41] to me those are examples when God would
[2:14:43] allow that even for his ministers and
[2:14:45] the prophet to set that before us that's
[2:14:48] not just for the prophet it's not just
[2:14:50] for the ministry it's God himself
[2:14:52] letting you and I see the Simplicity
[2:14:55] that he's called us to there's things
[2:14:58] that all there's everything we have to
[2:14:59] do is yield and say God help me to get
[2:15:01] out of the way
[2:15:03] and you know what you know what brings
[2:15:04] us to that we can't do that on our own
[2:15:06] self it's the word of God delivered by
[2:15:09] the spirit of God and he's drawing us to
[2:15:12] that place of submission it's not a
[2:15:14] demand it's not a command it's not a
[2:15:16] dictatorship it's the love of God taking
[2:15:19] hold upon the children of God
[2:15:22] oh how precious is our lovely Lord Jesus
[2:15:26] amen he's so wonderful he's so wonderful
[2:15:29] to us so good to us what what a word
[2:15:33] that we have received from the Lord amen
[2:15:35] and I'll tell you friends listen when
[2:15:37] God delivers a word when he delivers it
[2:15:39] it's not just something that we take in
[2:15:42] this very moment but I'm going to tell
[2:15:44] you you take that word and you're going
[2:15:46] to be tested on the word you receive but
[2:15:48] I want you to remember you're not
[2:15:50] standing alone remember the example he
[2:15:51] gave about somebody coming to my
[2:15:53] doorstep and wanting to pick on my boys
[2:15:58] I got some double Barrels in there too
[2:16:02] you come we're going to go to war
[2:16:05] but I want you to remember you're not
[2:16:07] alone
[2:16:09] I don't care how you feel you're not
[2:16:11] alone he said he said I'll never leave
[2:16:15] you nor forsake you

[2:16:20] that word
[2:16:21] you say Satan
[2:16:23] you you might have had me on that before
[2:16:25] I might have been entertained that
[2:16:26] before but too late
[2:16:29] my father spoke to me
[2:16:31] there's a word that's delivered you have
[2:16:34] no power over that in my mind or my
[2:16:38] spirit anymore

[2:16:54] oh my my I tell you the joy of the Lord
[2:16:58] is certainly our strength
[2:17:00] amen
[2:17:01] I I want to say is brother Nathan he
[2:17:04] mentioned that about brother Roy and uh
[2:17:07] you know brother Roy is such a
[2:17:09] such a veteran brother Roy Shrewsbury
[2:17:11] that went on home to be with the Lord
[2:17:12] and I think about when my wife and I we
[2:17:15] got married and
[2:17:17] you know we as soon as we got married
[2:17:19] then the next on that Sunday we were
[2:17:21] there went to be there in in Beckley and
[2:17:24] that morning brother Roy you know it
[2:17:27] spoke to us and
[2:17:29] then he wanted to take us out to lunch
[2:17:30] and have some time there with us and
[2:17:33] things and
[2:17:34] brother Roy just to me just such a
[2:17:37] an ambassador a representative of this
[2:17:40] message
[2:17:41] and always to me my wife and I were
[2:17:43] talking on the way to church she said
[2:17:44] brother Roy she said there's just one
[2:17:47] word you can always think about and I
[2:17:49] know there's many
[2:17:50] but a man of integrity and I know maybe
[2:17:52] some of you didn't get a chance to meet
[2:17:54] brother Roy Shrewsbury but
[2:17:56] I really really appreciate brother Roy
[2:17:58] and I know different ones brother Wayne
[2:17:59] you preached their regular almost every
[2:18:00] month for so long
[2:18:02] many different things and
[2:18:04] but you know another soldiers went on
[2:18:06] home to the reward
[2:18:07] [Music]
[2:18:09] and how we thank God
[2:18:12] for the faithfulness
[2:18:14] and I wanted to say that you know I if
[2:18:18] it had been I think brother Ray had
[2:18:19] pointed out here it was because I was
[2:18:21] asking about ministers and I get in
[2:18:22] trouble and I start calling out brothers
[2:18:24] and
[2:18:25] y'all have to forgive me sometimes I
[2:18:27] overlook different ones you know I don't
[2:18:28] mean to do anything like that
[2:18:30] but even with brother Daniel sitting
[2:18:32] right there here I am looking right over
[2:18:33] but
[2:18:34] I sat down there and I thought here was
[2:18:36] brother Jim shumi
[2:18:37] and I tell you I really love brother Jim
[2:18:40] sister shumate just real real good
[2:18:42] friends and I appreciate brother Jim
[2:18:44] there's a lot that I've I've told him
[2:18:46] this over the years I appreciate his
[2:18:47] stand and how that God gave him such
[2:18:50] Grace and holding things together and I
[2:18:52] just love him amen we're just it just
[2:18:55] it's just good to be a part of the
[2:18:56] family of God and
[2:18:58] I don't know I'm glad that God's have
[2:19:01] got a variety aren't you
[2:19:03] I'm glad that he didn't make everybody
[2:19:05] like me
[2:19:06] because I can't even put up with me
[2:19:10] but I'm glad that God's a god of variety
[2:19:12] aren't you
[2:19:13] amen it sounds like somebody I was
[2:19:16] really saying Amen on that one
[2:19:18] God bless you so much amen I we just
[2:19:22] want to invite you or the address out
[2:19:26] there to Mill Hollow where we're going
[2:19:27] to have the fellowship dinner at shelter
[2:19:30] number one
[2:19:31] the address is on the bulletin board
[2:19:34] brother Richard's going to be standing
[2:19:35] in the lobby for the whole service the
[2:19:38] rest of the service and he's going to
[2:19:39] hold it with two hands that's Brother
[2:19:41] Richard Sanchez
[2:19:43] no take a picture of it if you need to
[2:19:46] for the address
[2:19:47] I'm just teasing him brother Jim would
[2:19:49] you come and dismiss us in a word of
[2:19:51] prayer amen and it's just been good to
[2:19:54] be here in the house of the Lord
[2:19:57] I believe God has done many things right
[2:20:00] here in this service I believe that
[2:20:02] because you the word can't be spoken and
[2:20:04] it not take effect
[2:20:06] it will find
[2:20:08] and hit the mark
[2:20:10] sometimes it isn't what we see
[2:20:13] but God is moving
[2:20:15] the Bible said the kingdom of God cometh
[2:20:17] without observation you know God works
[2:20:20] in such a precise way and you know what
[2:20:23] he was doing here once again this
[2:20:24] morning is Jehovah Jireh the same God
[2:20:27] that provided the RAM on the mountain
[2:20:29] the same God that provided the squirrels
[2:20:32] in the woods and even I love
[2:20:35] how brother Brandon would go in and be
[2:20:37] so transparent he said I'm you know I'll
[2:20:40] use the word radical he said I'm going
[2:20:42] to call for a squirrel to come out of
[2:20:43] this because there ain't no way that a
[2:20:46] squirrel is going to come out of this
[2:20:49] what do you see brother Samuel I see my
[2:20:51] own life that's what I see
[2:20:54] who would have thought a Son of God
[2:20:56] coming out of here
[2:20:57] a daughter of God coming out of there
[2:20:59] but what brought us out the word
[2:21:02] the word has brought us out
[2:21:05] oh my what is it Jehovah Jireh providing
[2:21:10] for himself I couldn't help myself
[2:21:13] but God provided
[2:21:16] to lead you and I out into full Victory
[2:21:19] don't you love him this morning
[2:21:22] amen he has been so good to us brother
[2:21:24] Jim come and dismiss us in a word of
[2:21:26] prayer amen God bless you so good to
