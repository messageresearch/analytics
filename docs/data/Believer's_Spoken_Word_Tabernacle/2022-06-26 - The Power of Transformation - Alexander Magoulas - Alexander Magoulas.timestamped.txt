[2:19] god
[2:21] when shall i come and appear before god
[2:24] my tears have been my midday and night
[2:26] while they continually say unto me where
[2:28] is thy god
[2:30] here's the verse i love
[2:33] when i remember these things
[2:35] i pour up my soul in me
[2:37] for i had gone with the multitude i went
[2:40] with them to the house of god with a
[2:43] voice of joy and praise with the
[2:45] multitude that
[2:47] kept the holy day
[2:49] isn't that beautiful

[43:04] been to ourselves that we've been to
[43:06] each other lord i pray today as you
[43:08] extend
[43:10] such an abundant grace and mercy and
[43:13] peace to us that we
[43:14] we could be partakers of the same that
[43:17] we could afford
[43:18] the same toward one another and lord as
[43:21] we've gathered together in the name
[43:22] above every other name
[43:24] your mighty matchless name we just asked
[43:27] that you would come and perform and do
[43:29] that which only you can do lord it it
[43:31] doesn't seem meat to us that you the
[43:34] master
[43:35] should serve us but lord time and time
[43:37] again in our lives we just find
[43:39] lord we need you more and more and you
[43:41] set the example for us lord you set the
[43:43] example for us that the greatest
[43:46] should serve so we come to you the
[43:47] greatest one although we ask you
[43:50] humbly now as we approach your throne
[43:52] you would come and give grace and mercy
[43:54] once more to your children lord there
[43:56] are needs here present today
[43:58] that i don't know about perhaps the
[44:00] person themselves
[44:02] is not even aware today what will go on
[44:04] in their life maybe even this afternoon
[44:06] but father you see each need before we
[44:08] asked you saw each situation before the
[44:11] world began and you made a way for us i
[44:13] thank you for this word of god today for
[44:15] you bless the ministering of the word of
[44:17] god may just strengthen establish and
[44:21] settle each one and father as always
[44:23] we're careful to give you all the praise
[44:25] and glory and on we thank you for these
[44:27] these are your children
[44:29] these are your children today that
[44:30] you've purchased
[44:32] with a great prize
[44:34] lord i'm keenly aware today of what they
[44:36] mean to you and lord i just i ask for
[44:39] your help now as i endeavor to to see
[44:41] them blessed may you give utterance i
[44:43] pray and father we give you the praise
[44:45] in jesus christ's name amen god bless
[44:47] you once again as you turn you're in
[44:48] your bibles today we're going to look
[44:50] into romans
[44:52] the 12th chapter
[44:54] the first three verses here and
[44:56] as you're turning there we just
[44:59] i say we
[45:01] me and the lord anyway but uh i just
[45:03] find this word of god it's always so
[45:05] rich amen
[45:07] it's it's it's so past our finding out
[45:09] and you know sometimes
[45:11] sometimes we we look at situations and
[45:15] we we wonder why things are the way they
[45:17] are
[45:18] but you know i believe god always has an
[45:20] answer if there's a bible question
[45:21] there's a bible answer you know the
[45:22] secret of the lord is with them that
[45:24] fear him he said and he will show them
[45:27] his covenant and so i thank god we we we
[45:29] are partakers of the secret things of
[45:31] god
[45:32] there's lots of churches getting
[45:34] together today lots of people getting
[45:35] together today lots of people that
[45:37] aren't even religious they got together
[45:38] in halls of congress or
[45:41] you know some secret place or whatever
[45:43] we've been gathered into this pavilion
[45:46] in the time of trouble he's hid us
[45:48] in the secret of civilians so we're just
[45:50] so glad to be feeding on the unfailing
[45:52] body word of the son of man romans the
[45:54] 12th chapter we'll read the first three
[45:55] verses here and i'll have you be seated
[45:57] the scripture says this it says i
[45:59] beseech you therefore brethren by the
[46:02] mercies of god that you present your
[46:04] bodies a living sacrifice
[46:07] holy acceptable unto god which is your
[46:11] reasonable service and be not conformed
[46:14] to this world
[46:16] but be transformed by the renewing of
[46:19] your mind that ye may prove what is that
[46:22] good
[46:23] and acceptable and perfect will of god
[46:26] for i say through the grace given unto
[46:29] me to every man that is among you not to
[46:31] think of himself more highly than he
[46:33] ought to think but to think soberly
[46:36] according as god hath
[46:38] dealt to every man
[46:39] the measure
[46:40] of faith may the lord bless you as you
[46:42] be seated today
[46:47] the brother random uses this text
[46:49] preaches out several places and i'd like
[46:51] to speak on it again today
[46:53] or on the same kind of a thought today
[46:54] speak on the power of transformation
[46:58] brother makes a statement in 1953 and
[47:01] the sermon israel in the church is like
[47:02] the first part he says this
[47:04] he says now we've got to come to full
[47:07] doctrine
[47:08] he says i like good old shouting
[47:09] meetings where we just clap our hands or
[47:11] shout and have a good time have great
[47:13] powerful services and things dance on
[47:16] the bubbles as it were he says but wait
[47:18] then when the showdown time comes you
[47:20] don't know where you're standing so then
[47:22] he makes this uh i guess we call it an
[47:24] injunction or maybe a commandment but he
[47:26] says let's get back and find out
[47:30] let's find out what's making us do that
[47:32] and so i want us to just take a few
[47:34] moments this morning and this afternoon
[47:35] and examine this idea
[47:37] why we are doing the things we do
[47:39] because as he said we can have powerful
[47:41] meetings and shout and clap and dance
[47:43] and yet not know where we're standing so
[47:45] we want to go back and find out why why
[47:47] are we excited about the things of god
[47:49] why do we shout and dance why is it if
[47:51] we here in that condition we come to
[47:53] showdown why is our attitude the way it
[47:55] is where people don't know where they're
[47:57] standing now we of course we appreciate
[47:59] great powerful services as the prophet
[48:01] said amen
[48:02] uh but to show you what i'm talking i
[48:04] want you to consider this you know i'll
[48:06] say it this way when i was a young man i
[48:07] come in the message and i first i'm
[48:09] listening to the tapes and i listened to
[48:11] brother and make a statement on tape he
[48:12] said that jesus christ in this day he
[48:15] said jesus christ had more success
[48:18] in my meetings in my ministry than he
[48:20] did back in galilee
[48:23] he said jesus christ had more he had
[48:25] more success in nazareth than he did
[48:28] back
[48:28] i'm sorry in jeffersonville than he did
[48:30] in nazareth and i'll just be honest with
[48:32] you as a young man i you know i come out
[48:33] of the world i barely knew anything and
[48:35] as a as a young man i hear this and it
[48:37] sounds almost sacrilegious to for a man
[48:39] to stand there and say well he's had
[48:41] more success here but i want to show it
[48:43] was jesus christ that had more success
[48:46] it wasn't the man william branham
[48:48] but he said jesus christ had more
[48:50] success here than he did in nazareth and
[48:52] i want you to understand today that's
[48:54] not sacrilegious that's absolutely the
[48:57] plan of god
[48:59] not only did it happen that's how god
[49:01] wanted it to be
[49:03] we're looking in our humanity and we
[49:05] think while a man is taking glory on
[49:06] himself no god wanted it that way jesus
[49:09] said the works that i do you will do
[49:12] them also
[49:14] and greater than these you'll do because
[49:15] i'm going to the father it was always
[49:18] god's plan that's why jesus said it's
[49:20] expedient for me to go
[49:23] so we look at that a carnal person or
[49:26] person that's maybe just religious and
[49:27] they're thinking they're looking at this
[49:29] the wrong way because that's actually
[49:30] what god wants to do amen
[49:33] and so we see this many times you know
[49:35] we we talk about powerful services i
[49:37] want you to understand some of the most
[49:39] powerful services that have ever been on
[49:41] the face of their took place in
[49:42] jeffersonville indiana
[49:44] they took place in bakersfield that took
[49:46] place in california there was a prophet
[49:48] of god he was anointed by god to bring
[49:51] forth this message and in those meetings
[49:53] the devil was defeated time after time
[49:56] after time
[49:58] we could talk about powerful meanings
[50:00] but here's some of the most powerful
[50:01] meetings probably ever been on the face
[50:04] of the earth amen blinded eyes were open
[50:06] the sick were healed thoughts that
[50:08] people didn't even know about themselves
[50:10] a prophet of god by inspiration through
[50:13] a prophetic gift he would open the
[50:15] secrets of the hearts he would reveal
[50:17] the might of god to the people but i
[50:19] want you to understand despite
[50:20] everything supernatural despite being
[50:22] the greatest meetings that were ever on
[50:24] the face of the earth many people that
[50:25] came for miracles
[50:28] many people came to see what was taking
[50:29] place maybe they came to criticize maybe
[50:32] they came for loaves and fishes whatever
[50:34] it is the the magnitude and the
[50:36] inspiration and the power of those
[50:38] meetings as great as it was many people
[50:40] come because they love fellowship or
[50:42] whatever else and they miss the purpose
[50:44] of god
[50:46] and by and large most of the people that
[50:49] sat in those meetings completely missed
[50:51] it
[50:52] they walked away or they criticized they
[50:54] went after something else
[50:56] so we thank god for these meetings we
[50:57] thank god they're on tape we thank god
[50:59] that they're recorded but as long as it
[51:02] stays on a recording
[51:04] if it's just a man in the pulpit
[51:05] speaking it'll never bring transforming
[51:07] power but when you recognize it's the
[51:10] voice of the son of man speaking through
[51:12] a prophet there's transforming power in
[51:15] that for your life
[51:16] because the same god that spoke back
[51:18] there he's speaking today not just to
[51:20] you but he wants to speak through you by
[51:23] the same inspiration
[51:26] amen
[51:28] by and large most people they heard they
[51:30] saw the sign but they disbelieved the
[51:33] voice that followed the sign amen and
[51:35] like i said they did the same thing with
[51:36] jesus they came for loaves and fishes
[51:38] they came for miracles and many people
[51:40] they go to church even today because
[51:42] they love the feeling of the anointing
[51:44] they love the worship service they love
[51:46] the fellowship amen and all those things
[51:48] are good and fine but unless they come
[51:51] into this place
[51:53] it'll never change their lives
[51:57] so there's lots of people i say this way
[51:59] many people worship god and a lot of
[52:00] people worship worship
[52:02] amen they worship the idea of worship
[52:03] they love the anointing and the service
[52:05] and the music and they love the
[52:06] atmosphere but when they walk out
[52:08] there's no there's nothing to follow it
[52:11] and if there's nothing to follow their
[52:13] lives their obedience their service to
[52:14] god it looks no different
[52:17] so the bible says for us to be
[52:18] transformed how not by an exciting
[52:21] worship service not by formal theology
[52:24] or a bunch of excitement you're
[52:25] transformed by the renewing of the mind
[52:29] as a christian amen now this is a greek
[52:31] word metamorpho it means to be changed
[52:34] from one form to another form and
[52:36] brother brandon uses the example i love
[52:37] the example he uses of a tadpole and you
[52:39] look at a tadpole and it's in its early
[52:42] state it's a little got a little wiggly
[52:44] tail and this and that the final end of
[52:46] that that frog it looks very dissimilar
[52:49] from what it started out as
[52:51] and in your own life you can look at
[52:52] where you started out at not just in
[52:54] this life but hopefully even as a
[52:56] christian you can look at what you
[52:58] started as and you can look at where
[53:00] you're at now and say you know what i'm
[53:02] not what i want to be but thank god i'm
[53:04] not what i used to be
[53:06] god has done something in my life that
[53:08] tadpole had no power to live in two
[53:11] atmospheres at the same time but when
[53:13] transformation come and he began to
[53:15] sprout a leg here and he began to that
[53:17] tail would fall off he he gained some
[53:19] things and he lost some things but what
[53:21] did it put him in a condition where he
[53:23] could live above the water
[53:25] he could come and live in another
[53:26] atmosphere that he was unable to live in
[53:29] before that
[53:30] right and so god is metamorphic he's
[53:32] transformed it's like a like a butterfly
[53:34] you think about it has no power it's a
[53:36] caterpillar you know if you if you see a
[53:38] butterfly going around unless you get
[53:39] real close you're like oh it's so pretty
[53:41] it looks so great but you get close to
[53:42] that caterpillar man you just want to
[53:43] squash it out
[53:45] now you shouldn't do that that's one of
[53:46] god's creatures
[53:47] you feel bad about that
[53:49] it looks so hideous in its form and when
[53:52] it begins to shroud itself in a cocoon a
[53:55] person that didn't know would wonder
[53:56] what was going on but god is
[53:58] transforming it by the nature
[54:01] which it catches now the nature that was
[54:03] already inside of it
[54:04] was going to produce a change on the
[54:06] outside and give it the ability to do
[54:09] things it could not do before
[54:13] god is transforming us to producing us
[54:16] the ability to do things we could not do
[54:19] in our humanity
[54:21] amen
[54:23] praise the lord
[54:24] it's changing and that's why i use the
[54:25] example i love the example of the frog
[54:27] because like i said the change is so
[54:28] drastic this word metamorpho it's
[54:30] actually the same word that's used in
[54:32] the bible when jesus is transfigured his
[54:34] outward form is so changed that his face
[54:36] it shines like the sun
[54:39] and i believe that this transformation
[54:40] i'm talking about today i believe it's
[54:42] transforming us not just in an instant
[54:44] but it's already transforming us here a
[54:46] little and there little you and i are
[54:48] already being changed from glory to
[54:51] glory
[54:52] and the same transformation that's in
[54:55] you that has caused you to overcome the
[54:58] situations in your life that you
[55:00] couldn't deal with
[55:01] that you couldn't overcome on your own
[55:03] that same transforming power is what's
[55:05] going to change this body one day this
[55:08] corruption it shall put on incorruption
[55:12] this mortal it shall put on immortality
[55:15] it can't be bound by its first birth
[55:18] it's not bound by circumstances
[55:20] it's transformed by the word of god
[55:24] hallelujah
[55:25] i believe that same theophy that you've
[55:27] heard from one day it's going to come
[55:29] right down here and pick up the uh it's
[55:31] going to pick you up and take you to
[55:32] that glorified body amen it's the power
[55:34] of transformation notice when you're
[55:37] transformed you act different you look
[55:39] different you walk different you talk
[55:41] different
[55:42] amen the power of transformation and
[55:45] this is why i'm saying this and i
[55:46] believe this is paul's point here in
[55:47] romans the 12th chapter he says i
[55:50] beseech you to present your bodies a
[55:52] living sacrifice
[55:54] it's holy it's acceptable to god it's
[55:57] your reasonable service
[56:00] i want you to present your whole life
[56:02] not not just your uh your just your
[56:04] sunday morning
[56:05] and remember to present your body as a
[56:07] living sacrifice listen if
[56:09] transformation just stays on the inside
[56:12] of us and that's all the further it goes
[56:14] we've missed the plan of god
[56:16] because god wants to present your entire
[56:18] spirit and your soul and your body
[56:20] blameless and his coming
[56:22] amen so i will you remember i want you
[56:25] to remember the literal life of jesus
[56:27] christ the token for this day it's of
[56:29] none of fact if it's not on display
[56:32] amen so it's got to be displayed
[56:35] in our lives amen
[56:37] now i want to look at this for a moment
[56:39] because when we read the book of
[56:40] jeremiah the 17th chapter and you don't
[56:42] have to turn there but
[56:43] we we look at the book of jeremiah the
[56:45] 17th chapter and there's a familiar
[56:47] scripture i use it quite a bit but the
[56:49] bible uh jeremiah says that the the
[56:51] heart is it's desperately
[56:53] wicked
[56:54] above all things
[56:56] i mean the the human heart is
[56:58] desperately wicked i can take a whole
[56:59] another thought on that but your human
[57:01] heart and your humanity it will fight
[57:02] its way
[57:03] through any obstacle to avoid the will
[57:05] of god if possible
[57:06] it does not want to serve god it does
[57:08] not want to submit to god your heart
[57:10] will find every excuse to serve god
[57:12] halfway or not serve god at all but one
[57:14] a man is changed not a mate believer now
[57:17] not an unbeliever when a man has really
[57:19] changed brother branham he talks about
[57:20] in the future home that that serpent
[57:22] nature that's in there there's a big
[57:24] eraser coming down from heaven amen
[57:26] praise god
[57:27] not what brother brain had on the
[57:28] blackboard but the hand of god come down
[57:30] and he took that serpent nature out of
[57:32] your heart
[57:33] and he transformed you he put the nature
[57:36] of a dove in there and you're not being
[57:37] led by a serpent anymore
[57:40] that's not who you are now your flesh
[57:42] doesn't want to recognize that maybe
[57:43] your friends don't want to recognize it
[57:45] maybe family doesn't recognize it but
[57:47] inside of you transformation has already
[57:49] taken place
[57:52] amen
[57:53] now if you're just a make-believer if
[57:55] you're just an unbeliever their heart is
[57:56] still desperately wicked that was
[57:58] israel's problem in the wilderness that
[58:00] paul talks about in the book of rome uh
[58:02] i'm sorry it's uh first corinthians the
[58:04] first corinthians the 10th chapter he
[58:06] talks about how they all led they left
[58:08] it they left the will uh
[58:09] egypt to go into the wilderness amen and
[58:12] they all left there this and they were
[58:14] all under the pillar of fire
[58:16] they all were under the pillar of the
[58:18] cloud they all drink from the rock in
[58:20] the wilderness they all ain't manna but
[58:22] with them all god was not pleased
[58:25] because their hearts the bible said
[58:27] their hearts had never been changed
[58:30] their hearts lusted after evil things
[58:32] can i put it this way to you today
[58:34] listen many people follow the prophet
[58:36] back there and they'll follow the
[58:37] prophet today
[58:38] they'll follow the prophet they've got
[58:40] the pillar of fire hanging up in their
[58:41] house they can believe in signs and
[58:43] wonders they've got all these things
[58:45] they drink from the same waters they
[58:46] listen to the same message but their
[58:48] hearts until their hearts are changed it
[58:50] doesn't do them any good
[58:54] and many people have settled to have
[58:56] another experience and say well listen
[58:58] we believe that god sent a prophet so do
[59:00] the pharisees
[59:02] that was their excuse with jesus well
[59:04] listen we're moses his disciple but if
[59:06] you believe what the prophet has said
[59:08] you recognize the word made flesh
[59:12] because the word made flesh tonight is
[59:13] not in a grave in jeffersonville this
[59:16] right here this bride right now in 2022
[59:19] she is now the word made flesh
[59:21] you're the word made flesh today and if
[59:23] you can't recognize that and walk it it
[59:26] will never do you any good
[59:30] amen praise the lord
[59:33] so you have to understand that the
[59:34] change has already begun somewhere and
[59:37] that's what paul talks about romans the
[59:38] second chapter he said that you've
[59:40] received a circumcision amen not a
[59:42] circumcision made with hands in your
[59:44] flesh but you've received a circumcision
[59:47] of the heart
[59:48] which is made by god god changed that in
[59:51] you amen so what is the circumcision
[59:54] it's a separation from the flesh god
[59:56] separated your heart from the nature of
[59:59] your old birth of this flesh that's not
[1:00:02] who you are anymore
[1:00:04] you say why are you saying all this
[1:00:05] brother because what i want you to
[1:00:06] understand is many people they wrestle
[1:00:08] with condemnation they wrestle with
[1:00:10] insecurity they wrestle with a wrong
[1:00:12] attitude towards themselves because they
[1:00:14] recognize that they've got problems in
[1:00:16] their life like we're the only ones
[1:00:18] we come to church we hang our heads man
[1:00:20] i got problems today well praise god
[1:00:22] you're the only one at church
[1:00:25] we can get you fine we'll all be great
[1:00:28] we look at problems in our life we look
[1:00:29] at hang-ups we look at complexes and we
[1:00:32] disqualify ourselves because we think
[1:00:34] well there got to be something wrong
[1:00:36] with me well there's something wrong
[1:00:37] with your flesh
[1:00:39] that's why it needs to be changed we're
[1:00:42] trying to fix this flesh and if you
[1:00:43] could fix it it wouldn't have to be
[1:00:45] changed to go in the rapture
[1:00:48] listen god's not even taking this past
[1:00:50] house he's given you a new one he's
[1:00:52] going to rearrange these atoms to where
[1:00:54] there's never another doubt there's
[1:00:56] never another insecurity there's never
[1:00:57] another heartache
[1:01:01] but we look at these things in our own
[1:01:02] lives to say well there must be
[1:01:04] something wrong with me well it's not
[1:01:05] necessarily something wrong with you
[1:01:09] there's something wrong in your flesh
[1:01:10] but listen if you've received the nature
[1:01:12] of christ i want you to catch this amen
[1:01:14] if you receive the nature of christ if
[1:01:16] he's changed your heart listen he's not
[1:01:19] going to do that if you're a believer
[1:01:20] he's already done that
[1:01:22] that was the very covenant that he made
[1:01:24] what is the new covenant that jeremiah
[1:01:26] prophesied of paul talks about it in the
[1:01:28] book of hebrews he says i will put my
[1:01:31] law in their inward parts i will write
[1:01:33] it in their hearts and i will be their
[1:01:36] god and they shall be my people
[1:01:40] amen
[1:01:41] so the whole promise is i'm going to put
[1:01:42] it in them
[1:01:44] it's there already by the baptism of the
[1:01:47] holy ghost
[1:01:48] that's why again romans 2 says you have
[1:01:50] been made a law unto yourselves
[1:01:54] it's amazing to me you look even at this
[1:01:55] country and i i probably use this
[1:01:57] example before but we we tried to do
[1:01:59] what israel did sometimes we tried to
[1:02:01] legislate righteousness well if i could
[1:02:03] if we can make a certain law if we could
[1:02:04] change the laws in this country but as
[1:02:06] long as evil is in the heart of a people
[1:02:08] as long as their heart is fixed on evil
[1:02:10] they'll do whatever evil thing they want
[1:02:12] whether there's a law or not
[1:02:14] but paul says the law is not made for a
[1:02:16] righteous man it's made for the
[1:02:17] unrighteous you and i don't need one if
[1:02:20] the law of god is in our heart
[1:02:24] see the carnal mind would say well
[1:02:25] listen we need more rules and
[1:02:27] regulations and ideas and creeds but
[1:02:30] listen this is a better way
[1:02:32] just to put it in your heart that the
[1:02:33] nature of god in you wants to follow the
[1:02:35] will of god
[1:02:37] it's better it's not worse listen this
[1:02:39] is not worse than stoning tables from a
[1:02:41] mountain you've got something better
[1:02:43] than moses had you've got the power of
[1:02:45] transformation
[1:02:47] the power of transformation lies in you
[1:02:49] it can do for you what what moses
[1:02:51] couldn't do with his own temper
[1:02:56] where is the love of god shed about the
[1:02:58] scriptures in your heart
[1:03:00] amen
[1:03:02] paul says in romans 7 i delight to do
[1:03:04] the law of god after the inward man it's
[1:03:06] the law of sin in my members see it's
[1:03:09] another law it's not you
[1:03:11] and that's paul's whole point listen
[1:03:12] that's not you that's sin in you doing
[1:03:15] it god doesn't impute it to you anymore
[1:03:18] because that's not your desire that's
[1:03:20] not who you really are
[1:03:22] who you are is what god put in your
[1:03:24] heart which is him
[1:03:26] that's why the same word that speaks to
[1:03:28] the bridegroom speaks to this bride it's
[1:03:30] his righteousness his power his
[1:03:32] authority his faith
[1:03:38] say well listen brother what if my heart
[1:03:39] condemns me well the scripture says god
[1:03:40] is greater than your
[1:03:43] oh heart i just wrestled with
[1:03:44] condemnation i feel so bad i did all
[1:03:46] these things

[1:03:50] while back he it was a brother i just

[1:04:09] just the sweetest dearest person in the
[1:04:12] world
[1:04:13] and i'm talking about this this this
[1:04:14] brother just he just wrestles with
[1:04:16] condemnation he make one mistake and he
[1:04:18] just stayed out of church and he
[1:04:19] wouldn't talk to people look him in the
[1:04:21] eye
[1:04:22] just condemned all the time by his own
[1:04:25] life and i spoke to him when i said
[1:04:26] brother you realize something
[1:04:28] i said the way you feel the world
[1:04:30] doesn't feel that way
[1:04:32] i said you realize the fact i'll praise
[1:04:34] the lord that'll help somebody out
[1:04:36] the fact that you're convicted when
[1:04:38] you're wrong about something and you
[1:04:39] recognize it and you feel bad you
[1:04:41] realize not everybody feels that way
[1:04:44] amen god gives you a conscience that
[1:04:46] works it's not been seared it's not it's
[1:04:49] not affected by the world god gives you
[1:04:51] a conscience and that conscience lets
[1:04:53] you know when you do the wrong thing
[1:04:55] because god loves you
[1:04:57] not because he hates you
[1:05:00] if we're not careful like this man we
[1:05:02] allow this this conscience god give it
[1:05:04] to you to bless you we'll let the devil
[1:05:06] condemn us with him
[1:05:08] that's not why god give it to you god
[1:05:10] give it because he loves you
[1:05:12] the fact that you've got unconscious the
[1:05:14] fact that you feel bad would you do
[1:05:16] something wrong that's the evidence that
[1:05:18] god loves you because the law is written
[1:05:19] in your heart
[1:05:23] and if we're not careful we allow what
[1:05:25] god ordained to be a blessing to us to
[1:05:28] become a place the adversary will defeat
[1:05:30] us
[1:05:31] because we look at it the wrong way
[1:05:34] amen
[1:05:36] i thank god
[1:05:38] god by his by the blood of christ the
[1:05:40] scripture says in hebrews chapter 9 he
[1:05:42] has purified our conscience from dead
[1:05:44] works to serve the living god
[1:05:47] listen if your conscience works because
[1:05:48] god purified it that's a good thing
[1:05:51] it's not a bad thing
[1:05:53] amen praise the lord
[1:05:56] god has put that there and that's why
[1:05:57] again in hebrews chapter 5 god is
[1:06:00] teaching us to distinguish between good
[1:06:02] and evil
[1:06:03] right
[1:06:04] milk belongs to them that are not of age
[1:06:06] strong me i believe that's what we're
[1:06:08] feeding on today strong meat belongs to
[1:06:10] them that are of age who even by reason
[1:06:13] of use of their senses
[1:06:16] know how to discern between good and
[1:06:17] evil
[1:06:18] you're not sitting here looking at
[1:06:19] murder and abomination stuff saying well
[1:06:21] i wonder if that's right or bad i wonder
[1:06:22] how god feels about that you know how
[1:06:24] god feels about it because you're not a
[1:06:26] bunch of babies
[1:06:27] you're not a bunch of infants you know
[1:06:29] the will of god you're wise
[1:06:31] understanding the will of the lord
[1:06:35] i tell my children this often i didn't
[1:06:37] realize this i got i guess i got it from
[1:06:38] charles spurgeon but
[1:06:40] discernment is not just being able to
[1:06:41] tell between evil and good it's being
[1:06:43] able to tell between what is right and
[1:06:44] what is almost right
[1:06:47] amen
[1:06:49] what what looks right and what actually
[1:06:52] is right they're so close sometimes amen
[1:06:55] listen this is the most deceiving age
[1:06:56] it's ever been
[1:06:58] you're facing things paul didn't have to
[1:06:59] face
[1:07:01] you're facing things peter didn't have
[1:07:02] to pace in her
[1:07:03] face in iranians and columba they dealt
[1:07:06] with many things but this is the most
[1:07:07] deceiving wicked age there's ever been
[1:07:10] because what looks like it's right is
[1:07:12] wrong it could be 99 right and still be
[1:07:15] wrong but praise god he sent us a
[1:07:17] message he's given us his spirit you can
[1:07:20] tell the difference
[1:07:22] transforming power in your life let you
[1:07:25] see it quickening power reveal it to you
[1:07:29] oh hallelujah
[1:07:32] i believe this bride
[1:07:34] we know she has to be at a full maturity
[1:07:36] that's how she can discern and withstand
[1:07:38] between the antichrist spirit and the
[1:07:40] spirit of god now you read that in the
[1:07:42] church book he's not just talking about
[1:07:44] a preacher somewhere he's talking about
[1:07:46] you and i today
[1:07:47] you and i have to be able to discern
[1:07:49] amen that belongs to those that are full
[1:07:51] age amen
[1:07:52] i read this here again in hebrews
[1:07:54] chapter 10 i want to read it for just a
[1:07:55] moment
[1:07:56] he says this is the covenant that i will
[1:07:57] make with him after those days saith the
[1:07:59] lord i will put my law into their hearts
[1:08:03] and in their minds will i write it
[1:08:06] amen now i'm bringing this back to being
[1:08:08] renewed in the spirit of your mind but i
[1:08:09] want you to catch this real quick i will
[1:08:11] put my law into their hearts and in
[1:08:13] their minds i will write it
[1:08:15] and then he says this i love this part
[1:08:17] and their sins
[1:08:19] and iniquities will i remember no more
[1:08:24] did you catch that amen if god has put
[1:08:26] his law in your heart your sins your
[1:08:30] iniquities he doesn't remember them
[1:08:32] anymore
[1:08:34] they say how can i know if i've been
[1:08:35] forgiven because he said it and you
[1:08:38] received it and his law is in you as in
[1:08:40] evidence your sins and iniquities he
[1:08:43] will remember them no more
[1:08:46] amen if you ever recognize that that
[1:08:48] you've been forgiven you're not just
[1:08:50] forgiven you're justified
[1:08:52] like you never did it in the first place
[1:08:57] listen we don't need a catholic priest
[1:08:59] today to intercede for us
[1:09:02] we don't need some man to stand the gap
[1:09:04] we've got one mediator between god and
[1:09:06] man
[1:09:07] the man christ jesus he's come in our
[1:09:10] hearts he dwells there he's places blood
[1:09:12] on the altar and you and i are justified
[1:09:15] today
[1:09:16] like we never did the first place and
[1:09:18] that's why i tell people all the time
[1:09:19] listen if you're a believer today if you
[1:09:21] receive that today you're just as
[1:09:23] righteous today as you'll ever be
[1:09:25] when you get a new body and the new
[1:09:27] heavens and earth and you don't have one
[1:09:29] temptation you don't have one problem
[1:09:31] you don't have one sickness you'll be
[1:09:33] just as righteous than as you already
[1:09:35] are right now
[1:09:37] because it's his righteousness in you
[1:09:42] oh my
[1:09:45] blessed is the man that's what david
[1:09:47] said blessed is the man now listen if
[1:09:49] you've got the right spirit in you you
[1:09:50] won't go the wrong way with that you
[1:09:52] won't turn grace into disgrace because
[1:09:54] the law of god is in your heart to stop
[1:09:56] that it's not your desire to do that
[1:09:59] your desires let's see how far away i
[1:10:01] can get from god your desire is i want
[1:10:03] to stay just as close to god as possible
[1:10:06] why would i want to go anywhere else i'd
[1:10:08] rather live one day
[1:10:10] in the courts of the lord in the house
[1:10:12] of the lord i'd rather be there one day
[1:10:14] than to live a thousand in attempts of
[1:10:16] wickedness
[1:10:17] i'd rather be a door keeper
[1:10:20] i'd rather be the lowest i'd rather be a
[1:10:22] full wash flunky than to live without
[1:10:25] the lord
[1:10:27] some people make their whole life they
[1:10:28] find a way to live without god well i'll
[1:10:30] do this without god i'll do that i don't
[1:10:32] want to go one minute i'd rather be the
[1:10:34] lowest to the level for one minute with
[1:10:36] god than to have a thousand years
[1:10:37] without god
[1:10:39] listen i've been in the tents of the
[1:10:41] wicked i don't want to go back
[1:10:44] i'd give it all up for just one moment
[1:10:46] with god
[1:10:50] oh my
[1:10:53] i like this here when paul writes about
[1:10:55] this in the
[1:10:56] in the greek here in the book of hebrews
[1:10:59] and i won't get into all the different
[1:11:00] words but
[1:11:02] he says i'll put my law in their hearts
[1:11:05] and this word in the greek it means that
[1:11:06] he's going to bestow it as a gift it's
[1:11:08] the gift of god to you
[1:11:10] you didn't earn the spirit of god you
[1:11:11] didn't work your way up to it he gives
[1:11:13] it as a gift
[1:11:14] that's what peter said in acts 2 38 you
[1:11:17] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:11:19] that's your gift to you
[1:11:21] he bestows it as a gift
[1:11:24] but then he says and i will write it and
[1:11:26] it's a it's a greek word epigraphio like
[1:11:28] an epigraph i will inscribe or write it
[1:11:31] in their minds
[1:11:33] in other words god's going to gift you
[1:11:34] with his nature
[1:11:36] by the spirit amen i believe that's what
[1:11:38] malachi 4 is about what did he say i
[1:11:40] will restore what the hearts
[1:11:43] of the children the heart's not the
[1:11:44] problem today then
[1:11:46] if you've got the the revelation that
[1:11:48] was given according to the prophet
[1:11:49] malachi 4. if you receive this message
[1:11:52] the heart's not the problem the problem
[1:11:54] is it needs to be inscribed
[1:11:57] he doesn't just bestow that it's got to
[1:11:59] take there's something that has to take
[1:12:00] place in other words god has to rewrite
[1:12:02] the way you think
[1:12:04] god has it because listen brother bran
[1:12:06] tells us in the greatest battle ever
[1:12:08] fought what satan chose as his
[1:12:10] battlefield he chose this that's why the
[1:12:12] battles the battle is not here for the
[1:12:14] believer it's here for the unbeliever
[1:12:16] it's here for the make believer but this
[1:12:18] is not your problem as a believer your
[1:12:20] problem is right here
[1:12:22] about two feet away you've got this big
[1:12:24] blockage up here that says you're no
[1:12:26] good and you'll never overcome and
[1:12:28] you're not as good as so and so and you
[1:12:30] can't believe god and you can't do this
[1:12:32] and i want to tell you today this is a
[1:12:33] lie
[1:12:36] the nature of god inside you is the
[1:12:37] truth and the nature of god says that
[1:12:39] you all things are possible to them that
[1:12:42] believe
[1:12:47] so we must allow god to rewrite our way
[1:12:49] of thinking i'll give you a good example
[1:12:51] here well i think it's a good example
[1:12:55] but john speaks about this in first john
[1:12:56] the second chapter in verse 20 he says
[1:12:58] you have an unction it's the same word
[1:13:00] anointing you have an unction or an
[1:13:02] anointing from the holy one and you know
[1:13:04] all things and i've met a lot of people
[1:13:07] i think they know all things
[1:13:10] they let me know they know all things
[1:13:11] especially when they're a teenager or
[1:13:13] something i better not get into that
[1:13:15] that's all i know some older ones too
[1:13:17] but you know it all they got to know all
[1:13:19] spirit brother bran said watch it when
[1:13:20] you get to know all spirit
[1:13:22] god can't even deal with that person
[1:13:24] when they got to know all spirit
[1:13:26] so that talk about somebody knows it all
[1:13:27] up here like some people
[1:13:30] it says you know all things it's not
[1:13:32] here it's the unction
[1:13:34] the spirit in you knows all things he
[1:13:36] tells you go down to verse 27 he says
[1:13:38] the anointing which you have received of
[1:13:40] him abideth in you and you need not that
[1:13:42] any man teach you now you can go to the
[1:13:44] carnal direction with that but if you
[1:13:45] spiritually understand
[1:13:47] god is giving you the discernment of his
[1:13:48] word
[1:13:49] amen there's a pulsation that identifies
[1:13:51] with the word that's how it teaches you
[1:13:54] amen the same anointing teaches you of
[1:13:57] all things and is truth and is no lie
[1:14:00] and even as it hath taught you ye shall
[1:14:03] abide in him
[1:14:05] so the anointing in you knows
[1:14:08] and when you don't know that's where you
[1:14:10] go
[1:14:11] i mean you're not praying to a god
[1:14:12] that's a stone idol or a god that's a
[1:14:14] million miles away the god in you knows
[1:14:17] the answer if you'll turn there and not
[1:14:19] rely on your own thinking don't lie or
[1:14:21] don't rely on your
[1:14:23] understanding or lean in your own ways
[1:14:25] but trust in the lord acknowledge him in
[1:14:28] all your ways he shall direct your paths
[1:14:33] amen praise the lord
[1:14:35] so it's the spirit of the mind that
[1:14:36] needs renewed that's why the prophet of
[1:14:38] god said to the right mental attitude
[1:14:41] is that what he said the right mental
[1:14:43] attitude toward any promise of god will
[1:14:47] bring it to pass
[1:14:50] you know i talk some people say well
[1:14:51] that almost sounds like psychology well
[1:14:53] it would be if it wasn't god doing it
[1:14:55] amen
[1:14:56] and listen that's not just regard to
[1:14:58] psychology i thank god for for licensed
[1:15:00] people that know what they're doing but
[1:15:01] we're talking about the gospel now amen
[1:15:03] this isn't a man's psychology
[1:15:06] but the brahman says i'll tell you what
[1:15:07] the prophet said about it brother-in-law
[1:15:08] says this in 1963. he said psychology is
[1:15:11] all right as long as psychology don't
[1:15:13] deny the word
[1:15:15] but when psychology denies the word then
[1:15:17] psychology is wrong it gives an
[1:15:19] uncertain sound
[1:15:22] you know i was reading like i said i was
[1:15:23] reading through the church's book here
[1:15:25] and it's funny i found that brother
[1:15:26] branham endorsed a psychology book i
[1:15:28] thought well is it the dsm-4 well they
[1:15:30] wouldn't have that back then
[1:15:32] five or whatever brother actually
[1:15:34] endorses one this is great he said there
[1:15:36] is a textbook on psychology
[1:15:39] one we all need
[1:15:41] it is the bible
[1:15:46] i tell you what it's on a best-seller
[1:15:47] list and everything you can go buy it
[1:15:49] for a dollar dollar 25 now
[1:15:52] at the dollar tree if you want amen
[1:15:54] there is a book on psychology we all
[1:15:56] need it's the bible
[1:15:58] amen it's written by god and contains
[1:16:01] god's psychology
[1:16:04] well i feel pretty good about that
[1:16:06] we don't need a psychoanalyst we've got
[1:16:08] the holy spirit here to discern what's
[1:16:10] going on in your life amen no disregard
[1:16:13] to psychologists now but we've got
[1:16:14] something that when we get out as far up
[1:16:16] as we can get on the tree of knowledge
[1:16:18] of good and evil we can reach over to
[1:16:20] the tree of life we don't have to be
[1:16:21] stuck on that one tree
[1:16:23] we've got something that can not just
[1:16:25] help you deal with the problem it can
[1:16:27] change the situation altogether
[1:16:30] because you can learn to cope you can
[1:16:32] learn to deal with things in your past
[1:16:34] your history but god can put something
[1:16:37] in you
[1:16:38] that'll remove the problem completely
[1:16:42] so we thank god for whatever god wants
[1:16:44] to do amen so transformation comes by
[1:16:46] the renewing of the mind in other words
[1:16:49] we must reconcile
[1:16:50] the divine facts about what god has said
[1:16:53] about us in our christian walk
[1:16:56] brother man makes a statement i'm going
[1:16:57] to take just a few moments to read it
[1:16:59] it's a longer quote here it's in 1955.
[1:17:02] it's in the sermon the fundamental
[1:17:04] foundation for faith it's one of my one
[1:17:05] of my favorites actually brother bam
[1:17:07] says this
[1:17:08] and what you really catch is that man
[1:17:10] was made as a secondary god on earth
[1:17:12] praise the lord
[1:17:14] that was man in the beginning
[1:17:16] in other words that's man in the end as
[1:17:18] well
[1:17:19] because god's not gonna halfway redeem
[1:17:21] it amen
[1:17:23] man was made a secondary as a secondary
[1:17:25] god on the earth he was given the power
[1:17:27] to control
[1:17:29] all things
[1:17:31] all elements of the earth that was adam
[1:17:33] adam was given these great powers
[1:17:35] is it the power that he was given to
[1:17:37] make himself is it's where he fell so
[1:17:39] notice in other words the power that he
[1:17:41] has actually the way that he fell you
[1:17:44] catch that
[1:17:45] listen
[1:17:46] satan didn't just the the bible tells us
[1:17:48] is that right and i believe it's the
[1:17:50] first timothy 3 the woman was deceived
[1:17:52] but the man wasn't deceived
[1:17:54] in other words he had to have the
[1:17:55] authority to give it up in the first
[1:17:57] place he had to do it willingness so he
[1:17:59] had the power and he chose by that same
[1:18:02] authority to forfeit it
[1:18:04] he forfeited it wasn't wrestled from him
[1:18:07] he forfeited his right to life to his
[1:18:10] inheritance to his fellowship he forces
[1:18:12] the book of redemption
[1:18:14] amen
[1:18:15] adam could speak to the winds and it
[1:18:17] would stop
[1:18:18] he could speak to the trees and they
[1:18:20] would obey him he could speak to
[1:18:21] wildlife it would obey him he could
[1:18:23] speak to the waters ever what it was
[1:18:25] everything obeyed adam he says now this
[1:18:28] is the beginning of man that's what god
[1:18:31] gave him power over everything on the
[1:18:34] earth now through the fall he lost that
[1:18:36] power then he becomes unconscious
[1:18:40] of the fact
[1:18:42] after losing his relationship and
[1:18:44] fellowship fellowship with the father he
[1:18:46] lost that and all of his great channels
[1:18:49] become clogged up and he couldn't get
[1:18:51] through now brother ben calls it flues
[1:18:52] in other places talk about your channels
[1:18:54] your conscience your reasons affections
[1:18:56] memories imaginations they get clogged
[1:18:58] up through the unconscious and he
[1:18:59] forgets what he is
[1:19:02] he forgot what he was
[1:19:04] brother man says this now what adam was
[1:19:06] in god christ has
[1:19:09] not going to not in the process of
[1:19:13] christ has redeemed us back to that
[1:19:18] a redeemer to redeem anything is to
[1:19:20] bring it back to its origin again adam
[1:19:23] never had to be sick he never had to die
[1:19:26] never had to worry he never had a
[1:19:29] heartache he never had a fear
[1:19:31] he just climbed up in the arms of the
[1:19:33] father just like a child everything was
[1:19:36] his and whatever he asked why he just
[1:19:38] got it everything obeyed him because he
[1:19:40] was god's child and the child is heir of
[1:19:43] all things now he's not just talking
[1:19:44] about adam now
[1:19:46] i hope you catch he's talking about you
[1:19:47] and i today amen
[1:19:49] he says now when man fell he lost us and
[1:19:51] when he lost the fall christ come as a
[1:19:53] redeemer did you ever stop to think
[1:19:57] what christ redeemed us for
[1:20:00] he gave us everlasting life he brought
[1:20:02] us back to the eternal fellowship and
[1:20:04] relationship to god to be his sons and
[1:20:07] daughters again to restore back all the
[1:20:10] adam lost in the fall
[1:20:12] we say what doesn't look like that well
[1:20:14] that's what hebrews the second chapter
[1:20:15] says we don't see all things under his
[1:20:17] feet why
[1:20:20] he says now the thing of it is since he
[1:20:22] has restored man back to his place man
[1:20:25] in the fall has lost his conscience
[1:20:28] of what the father put him on the earth
[1:20:30] to do in other words all the plumbing as
[1:20:32] it was in our brain and the outlets the
[1:20:35] faith has been become clogged up with
[1:20:38] business affair with home life domestic
[1:20:41] things it's also clogged up until god
[1:20:44] can operate through those channels he
[1:20:47] made a man for praise the lord
[1:20:50] now i want to really just labor on that
[1:20:52] for a second amen because the channel is
[1:20:54] being clogged up the engine is not the
[1:20:55] problem amen i use this example i i
[1:20:59] i always have to qualify this i heard
[1:21:00] one time
[1:21:02] that you know you take an engine and you
[1:21:04] stuff a potato or something there in the
[1:21:05] exhaust or something blocks like blood
[1:21:07] you know you block the exhaust up i've
[1:21:09] heard it'll affect how the engine runs i
[1:21:10] do not necessarily need saying i know
[1:21:12] that by experience
[1:21:14] but it affects how the engine runs amen
[1:21:17] the engine is not the problem the outlet
[1:21:19] is the problem
[1:21:21] amen and so it's the same with the man
[1:21:24] god made men with these human outlets
[1:21:27] and he made them for the man to operate
[1:21:30] through amen
[1:21:31] so then the problem is not the heart
[1:21:33] it's the outlet it's not letting it
[1:21:35] through it's clogged up with business
[1:21:37] affair and domestic things troubles at
[1:21:39] work and home life or entertainment or
[1:21:41] whatever we let it get so clogged up god
[1:21:43] can't move through it anymore
[1:21:46] but i think it's really important to
[1:21:47] notice because god made those channels
[1:21:49] to use them
[1:21:51] amen i'm saying that for a reason
[1:21:53] because many times in the message even
[1:21:55] we take our mind we take our conscience
[1:21:57] our reasons our affections our memories
[1:21:59] our imaginations and we treat it like
[1:22:01] it's the enemy but it's only the enemy
[1:22:03] if it's carnal minded to be carnally
[1:22:06] minded is death
[1:22:07] but to be spiritually minded his life in
[1:22:09] peace amen this doesn't have to be your
[1:22:11] enemy if you'll let god work through it
[1:22:15] and i use an example a lot of times but
[1:22:17] you take a young man you take a young
[1:22:19] woman they they get to be a you know a
[1:22:20] teenager and stuff and and a young man
[1:22:23] he begins to notice certain people he
[1:22:24] didn't notice before
[1:22:26] young girl she because of those people
[1:22:28] in her life that maybe she's played with
[1:22:29] her whole life stuff and she begins to
[1:22:31] notice them maybe they look a little bit
[1:22:32] different all of a sudden because they
[1:22:34] you know they become an adolescent and
[1:22:36] if we're not careful as a parent we we
[1:22:38] we either won't instruct that child or
[1:22:40] help them or we give them bad advice we
[1:22:42] just won't talk to them at all
[1:22:44] and this is why i'm saying this a lot of
[1:22:45] times that young person they they don't
[1:22:47] know how to handle a situation and they
[1:22:50] feel condemned or maybe we condemn them
[1:22:52] well you shouldn't feel that way about
[1:22:53] so-and-so and this and that but i want
[1:22:54] you to understand that young person has
[1:22:57] a natural affection
[1:22:59] and we live in an age where people have
[1:23:00] lost natural affection
[1:23:02] and people that lose their natural
[1:23:04] affection it's worse than when they had
[1:23:06] it
[1:23:07] the bible tells you what kind of
[1:23:08] reprobates they are
[1:23:10] so their affection is not the problem
[1:23:12] the problem is they don't know how to
[1:23:13] submit it to god
[1:23:16] listen son listen daughter listen person
[1:23:18] what you're feeling is normal but
[1:23:19] there's a right way
[1:23:21] and there's a wrong way to handle it and
[1:23:24] our job as christians as leaders as
[1:23:26] parents is to show them the right way
[1:23:28] not pretend it doesn't exist listen if
[1:23:31] they're becoming adults they have to
[1:23:33] deal with an adult situation so let's
[1:23:35] teach them like they're adults
[1:23:39] and when you when you when you when you
[1:23:40] you give them the brush off or you don't
[1:23:42] give them instruction where else are
[1:23:43] they going to go but the wrong way
[1:23:46] so we don't want to deny that listen uh
[1:23:48] your memory is a a great example i think
[1:23:50] of of the memory the human memory most
[1:23:52] many people live and defeat because of
[1:23:54] their memory they think about the things
[1:23:56] in their life they used to do they they
[1:23:57] look at other people's failures they
[1:23:59] look at other churches they look at all
[1:24:01] these things and it holds them back but
[1:24:03] david said i will not forget
[1:24:06] all his benefits
[1:24:08] amen his memory was surrendered to god
[1:24:12] god could use his memory to speak about
[1:24:15] the testimony of what god has done in
[1:24:17] his life now once you remember for you
[1:24:19] and i the only way we're going to
[1:24:20] overcome in this age is by the blood of
[1:24:22] the lamb
[1:24:24] and by the word of your testimony
[1:24:27] you've got to have a testimony god wants
[1:24:30] to use your memory
[1:24:32] not as a place of defeat not as a place
[1:24:34] of condemnation but to bless you to make
[1:24:37] you an overcomer
[1:24:40] so your memory is not the problem if
[1:24:41] it's submitted to god amen
[1:24:45] so we can allow this to be our enemy or
[1:24:47] we can be renewed
[1:24:48] in the spirit of the mind and god can
[1:24:51] use your memory god can use your
[1:24:52] affections god can use your imagination
[1:24:54] thank god for all the different songs we
[1:24:56] get to sing
[1:24:57] we got to sing all these great songs
[1:24:59] this morning and i just i thank god god
[1:25:01] inspired somebody's imagination to do
[1:25:02] that
[1:25:04] yeah we understand the days and all
[1:25:05] their imaginations
[1:25:07] we're continually evil but that doesn't
[1:25:09] have to be you and i god can transform
[1:25:13] god can redeem that god can use it for
[1:25:15] his glory
[1:25:18] so let's not just throw out the baby
[1:25:20] with the bath water so to speak we don't
[1:25:21] want those things that are bad no we
[1:25:23] want god to use them
[1:25:26] that's god's psychology that's what god
[1:25:28] thinks about it
[1:25:30] amen
[1:25:33] i like this scripture at the beginning
[1:25:34] we're the first two verses but the verse
[1:25:36] the third verse that i read paul says
[1:25:38] this he says i say through the grace
[1:25:40] given unto me to every man that is among
[1:25:42] you to think of himself
[1:25:43] not to think of himself rather more
[1:25:45] highly than he ought to think but to
[1:25:47] think soberly according as god has dealt
[1:25:50] to every man
[1:25:52] the measure of faith now brother bram
[1:25:54] talks about this in the pregaming church
[1:25:55] age it's not different measures it's not
[1:25:58] a measure it's the measure
[1:26:01] amen in other words there is a measure
[1:26:03] that's given to the believer it's
[1:26:05] actually christ's faith in you
[1:26:09] so why you say what's this guy with the
[1:26:10] mind we many times think well i don't
[1:26:12] have faith for this well i wish i had
[1:26:14] faith for that i don't have faith that's
[1:26:16] the enemy lying to you because this
[1:26:18] message has a rapturing faith in it
[1:26:23] so you've got faith whether you
[1:26:24] recognize it you might be unconscious of
[1:26:26] it that doesn't change the fact that
[1:26:28] it's there it just changes the fact of
[1:26:30] how you're going to use it you say i
[1:26:32] wish i had more faith listen jesus own
[1:26:34] disciples said that one day they said
[1:26:36] increase our faith he said listen if you
[1:26:38] had faith the size of a mustard seed you
[1:26:41] can move a mountain
[1:26:43] hope you catch what i'm getting at today
[1:26:45] what you have in you today is enough to
[1:26:47] move a mountain it's enough to change
[1:26:49] your body it's enough to change the
[1:26:51] circumstances in your life if you just
[1:26:53] accept it
[1:26:55] don't fight it don't wrestle against it
[1:26:57] believe that god and you believe his
[1:26:59] word of course he believes his word he
[1:27:01] believed his own word at the beginning
[1:27:03] and he spoke everything into existence
[1:27:05] by it
[1:27:08] praise the lord
[1:27:11] i want you to notice this if you want
[1:27:13] you can turn there
[1:27:14] ephesians chapter one
[1:27:18] i'm gonna read verses 15 to 19 ephesians
[1:27:20] chapter one
[1:27:22] i just want to take a moment to lay this
[1:27:23] out here
[1:27:24] because paul is praying for the ephesian
[1:27:26] church now brother branham has made the
[1:27:28] point this is the most uh orderly church
[1:27:30] in the new testament and when he writes
[1:27:32] this their church is in order they
[1:27:34] understand mysteries they have doctrine
[1:27:36] they've got all these things lined up
[1:27:37] they're they're they're the church that
[1:27:39] we are to approximate ourselves to
[1:27:41] amen and paulie begins to pray for the
[1:27:44] ephesian church and i want you to notice
[1:27:46] how he prays because he does not pray
[1:27:48] the way lots of people pray
[1:27:50] about their church about their ministry
[1:27:51] about whatever it is
[1:27:52] paul does not pray for them to have a
[1:27:54] greater
[1:27:55] more gifts or a greater revival or some
[1:27:57] special anointing to come but watch what
[1:27:59] paul prays for the ephesian church
[1:28:02] he says this in verse 15 says wherefore
[1:28:04] i also after i heard of your faith in
[1:28:06] the lord jesus and love unto all the
[1:28:08] saints i cease not to give thanks for
[1:28:11] you making mention of you my prayers
[1:28:14] that the god of our lord jesus christ
[1:28:16] the father of glory may give unto you
[1:28:18] what the spirit of wisdom and revelation
[1:28:22] and the knowledge of him the eyes of
[1:28:25] your understanding be enlightened that
[1:28:26] you may know what the hope of his
[1:28:28] calling what is the riches of the glory
[1:28:31] of his inheritance in the saints what is
[1:28:33] the exceeding greatness of his power to
[1:28:36] us word who believe according to the
[1:28:38] working of his mighty power that is his
[1:28:41] wimpy defeated weak blown away power his
[1:28:43] mighty power
[1:28:46] so let me just summarize this for you in
[1:28:48] other words paul is praying for the
[1:28:49] ephesian church to recognize by
[1:28:52] revelation what they already have
[1:28:57] they don't need something new they don't
[1:29:00] need something greater they need to see
[1:29:01] what god's already given them
[1:29:04] you know not today we don't need another
[1:29:05] message we don't need another messenger
[1:29:07] we don't need a greater something or
[1:29:09] whatever god is given us by the message
[1:29:12] by his spirit everything we need
[1:29:15] all things that pertain to life and
[1:29:17] godliness it's yours now
[1:29:20] everything you need for your earthly
[1:29:22] journey you just have to recognize that
[1:29:24] god i pray today would give us eyes to
[1:29:26] see
[1:29:28] that's why the prophet said there's
[1:29:29] nothing of such prevailing power as
[1:29:32] revelation
[1:29:33] revelation in your life
[1:29:36] not in another man's life in your life
[1:29:38] revelation is prevailing power
[1:29:42] they say i need a greater prevailing
[1:29:43] power today get a greater revelation of
[1:29:46] what he's already done for you
[1:29:48] because what he's done for you it's
[1:29:50] enough
[1:29:51] listen it's not just enough it's more
[1:29:53] than enough
[1:29:54] he has done more than enough for you to
[1:29:57] overcome every adversary
[1:29:59] to over to surround any obstacle he has
[1:30:02] done more than enough for you
[1:30:05] if you can recognize it
[1:30:06] and that's what paul prays for them god
[1:30:08] made the spirit of wisdom and revelation
[1:30:11] open the eyes of their understanding
[1:30:14] to see what the greatness of his power
[1:30:16] it's in you
[1:30:17] the same power that spoke the worlds
[1:30:22] the same power that raised up christ
[1:30:24] it's in you right now
[1:30:28] and you think you need more power
[1:30:30] you think you need something else you've
[1:30:32] got the greatest thing that ever
[1:30:33] happened
[1:30:34] he's in you we are in our easter right
[1:30:36] now
[1:30:38] by the holy ghost
[1:30:41] god help us to see what he's already
[1:30:43] done in our lives
[1:30:45] because many times we miss it from
[1:30:46] domestic affair and business affair and
[1:30:49] the day-to-day of our life and we
[1:30:50] despise the days of small things and we
[1:30:52] forget that god is in us doing something
[1:30:55] and listen god's purpose in you it's not
[1:30:57] a little thing it's not an obscure thing
[1:30:59] god's purpose in you is greater than
[1:31:01] anything you could ask or think on your
[1:31:03] own
[1:31:05] god in you is capable of so much more
[1:31:08] than you let him do
[1:31:10] [Music]
[1:31:14] paul says in colossians chapter 2 you
[1:31:15] are complete
[1:31:17] this word in the the
[1:31:18] the greek it actually means you are
[1:31:20] filled or you are full you are filled in
[1:31:22] him or full in him who is the head of
[1:31:25] all principality and power
[1:31:28] that's why hallelujah that's why satan
[1:31:31] hates revelation
[1:31:33] because there's nothing that has such
[1:31:34] prevailing power in it that's why the
[1:31:36] prophet said he knows satan knows if the
[1:31:39] people get the true revelation of the
[1:31:41] true church and what she is
[1:31:45] can i take my liberty for just a moment
[1:31:47] i believe he's saying the same thing
[1:31:48] paul said watch this
[1:31:50] what she is the hope of his calling
[1:31:52] that's who she is it's the hope of his
[1:31:54] calling
[1:31:56] what she stands for the riches of the
[1:31:58] glory of his and your inheritance in the
[1:32:00] saints that's what we're standing for
[1:32:02] today
[1:32:03] that's why we preach the mysteries of
[1:32:04] god before we preach his promises that's
[1:32:06] our stand we're standing on it just like
[1:32:09] they did beyond the curtain of time
[1:32:13] you preach the same thing paul preached
[1:32:15] real this shouldn't surprise you
[1:32:18] and that she
[1:32:22] we all believe christ can do it she
[1:32:26] let me say this way you
[1:32:28] she can do
[1:32:30] the greater works
[1:32:34] the exceeding greatness of his power to
[1:32:37] us
[1:32:38] who believe that's what paul said
[1:32:40] she can do why his power is in her to do
[1:32:43] it
[1:32:46] she will be an invincible army
[1:32:51] praise god we're not having to dig up a
[1:32:53] bunker and store three and a half years
[1:32:55] of canned goods
[1:32:56] i don't got to get a bigger flak jacket
[1:32:58] and buy more bullets i wish i could but
[1:32:59] they're expensive
[1:33:01] silver and gold i ain't gotten huh
[1:33:04] i praise the lord
[1:33:06] well listen i've got something that they
[1:33:08] don't have with all their bunker busters
[1:33:10] and their bunker buster bomb bunk proof
[1:33:12] bunker buster whatever
[1:33:14] they've got bigger bunkers and bigger
[1:33:16] bombs they've got bigger plans and plans
[1:33:18] within plans but i have something they
[1:33:20] don't have i've got a way of escape
[1:33:26] you've got something the most protected
[1:33:28] the most wealthy people in the world
[1:33:30] don't have the power of transformation
[1:33:34] you don't need an f-15 you don't need a
[1:33:36] space shuttle you don't have to get
[1:33:38] something from some mega millionaire
[1:33:40] somewhere you've got power in you to fly
[1:33:43] you've got power unit rise up
[1:33:46] it's in you now if you let it transform
[1:33:48] you you can rise above anything
[1:33:51] you can rise to any occasion you can do
[1:33:54] all things through christ jesus that
[1:33:57] strengthens
[1:33:59] [Applause]
[1:34:02] you should finish this quote
[1:34:06] if they get a true revelation
[1:34:08] of the two spirits within the framework
[1:34:11] of the christian church and by god's
[1:34:13] spirit
[1:34:14] discern and withstand the antichrist
[1:34:15] spirit satan will be powerless
[1:34:21] so i don't know why people make such a
[1:34:22] big deal out of him well the devil this
[1:34:24] the devil that well he's powerless
[1:34:26] before a believer
[1:34:28] that discerns his spirit
[1:34:31] vote you've recognized satan and
[1:34:33] overcoming him is recognizing him in his
[1:34:35] tricks
[1:34:37] if you can recognize that you've already
[1:34:39] defeated it as a christian because
[1:34:41] greater is he that's in you than he
[1:34:44] that's in the world
[1:34:47] i'm gonna get up
[1:34:49] listen i i remember one of the first
[1:34:50] times i ever i dealt with somebody that
[1:34:52] had a spirit on him and stuff and and i
[1:34:54] won't get to the whole story but you
[1:34:55] know different people trying to do
[1:34:56] different things they were confused and
[1:34:58] i went and i spoke and i recognized it
[1:34:59] was an evil spirit and when i addressed
[1:35:01] that spirit that spirit spoke back i
[1:35:03] said you're going to come out in the
[1:35:04] name of jesus and that spirit said i
[1:35:05] will not come out
[1:35:07] that was his mistake
[1:35:10] [Music]
[1:35:12] well if you're really an evil spirit
[1:35:14] then i'm really greater than you
[1:35:16] by identifying yourself that you're in
[1:35:18] somebody you just made an easier target
[1:35:20] now i know i'm not gonna give up
[1:35:22] you know if you just sat there and and
[1:35:24] not said anything i had a question well
[1:35:26] maybe maybe i misread the situation
[1:35:28] maybe that was my imagination but as
[1:35:30] soon as that spirit identified itself it
[1:35:32] identified there was one greater there
[1:35:34] as well
[1:35:35] listen the devil's not afraid of me
[1:35:37] he's not afraid of you he's afraid of
[1:35:39] the one we represent
[1:35:43] and no wonder the devils tremble when a
[1:35:45] real son of god
[1:35:47] when a real daughter god walks in the
[1:35:48] room they recognize
[1:35:53] listen they know who paul was they knew
[1:35:55] who jesus was satan you might wonder who
[1:35:58] you are but satan knows exactly who a
[1:36:00] believer is
[1:36:02] and as soon as the devil begins to speak
[1:36:03] you've got him right where you want him
[1:36:05] you can't do nothing but lie anyway
[1:36:09] i said you will come out in the name of
[1:36:10] jesus christ
[1:36:12] he would deliver that same night
[1:36:15] i see all this for a reason amen he's
[1:36:17] powerless before you
[1:36:19] when you recognize who he is and what
[1:36:22] you've got
[1:36:24] how powerless is he was he kind of
[1:36:26] powerless
[1:36:27] i don't know how that would work it's
[1:36:28] powerless not sort of powerless
[1:36:31] but just in case you missed it
[1:36:33] he clarifies he will be as definitely
[1:36:36] thwarted today as when christ withstood
[1:36:40] his every effort
[1:36:42] to gain power over him in the desert
[1:36:47] how defeated is he he's that defeated
[1:36:50] he couldn't find one inch to get in
[1:36:52] there and he actually departed oh my
[1:36:55] praise the lord
[1:36:56] will the devil bother me here and the
[1:36:57] devil's chasing me here listen you can
[1:36:59] run him off that's what jesus did with
[1:37:01] us saith the lord
[1:37:03] [Applause]
[1:37:05] not some great gift not some great
[1:37:07] anointing and it is written
[1:37:09] and it is written today will defeat the
[1:37:12] adversary just as definitely today as it
[1:37:15] ever has
[1:37:18] oh my he says yes
[1:37:20] satan hates revelation but we
[1:37:23] love it
[1:37:24] [Applause]
[1:37:26] now you know why i love it so much
[1:37:29] i tell you what when you dip you around
[1:37:30] that honey and you taste it it tastes
[1:37:32] pretty good it's pretty good to get some
[1:37:34] victory ending amen i tell you when
[1:37:36] you've got victory over the enemy in
[1:37:37] your life there ain't nothing like it
[1:37:40] i can smell the scent of victory i can
[1:37:42] taste it on my left tell you what you
[1:37:44] get a taste for victory you won't want
[1:37:46] nothing else
[1:37:50] glory to god
[1:37:55] my my mind
[1:37:57] god is good
[1:38:00] oh he's good all the time
[1:38:03] there's honey in the rock today man
[1:38:05] there's something for you to dip your
[1:38:06] rod in here man
[1:38:09] ooh glory to god
[1:38:12] i'm not gonna get through this right now
[1:38:14] let's let's go here let's move brother
[1:38:16] all right
[1:38:18] real quick i want to touch on this word
[1:38:20] there's a word here it occurs
[1:38:22] multiple times in the new testament
[1:38:24] when paul's praying for the spirit of
[1:38:26] wisdom and revelation and the knowledge
[1:38:27] of him this is not the normal greek word
[1:38:29] uh gnosis for knowledge it's not a head
[1:38:32] knowledge this is not oh i went to
[1:38:34] seminary i studied it enough it's a
[1:38:36] different word epignosis
[1:38:38] amen it's the same root word as our as
[1:38:40] the greek word epiphaneo where we're
[1:38:41] getting epiphany from it's a full or a
[1:38:44] revealed thing it's something that god
[1:38:47] gives and it's perfect unto itself
[1:38:50] in other words god doesn't have to
[1:38:51] qualify it it doesn't have to he doesn't
[1:38:53] have to it has its own authority because
[1:38:55] it's given by revelation it's an
[1:38:57] epiphany you ever had an epiphany you
[1:38:59] know you wake up you're like
[1:39:00] whoa oh you know
[1:39:02] something come here
[1:39:04] that that perfect realization that's how
[1:39:06] brother brahma explains in the
[1:39:07] philadelphia church age there's a
[1:39:09] partial realization but there's a
[1:39:10] perfect realization
[1:39:12] listen when israel ate the bread in the
[1:39:14] wilderness and they ate that bread jesus
[1:39:16] said i'm the true bread he wasn't saying
[1:39:17] that wasn't bread
[1:39:19] that's not what he's saying he said
[1:39:20] that's the partial that's the type he
[1:39:23] says but i'm the anti-type i'm the true
[1:39:25] bread i'm the perfect realization
[1:39:28] i am what that was trying to declare
[1:39:30] unto you epinosis this is what it's
[1:39:33] about
[1:39:35] this is the full or the true or the
[1:39:36] faithful witness of it amen
[1:39:39] so in other words epinosis god is going
[1:39:41] to display
[1:39:44] his perfect realization about what he's
[1:39:45] spoken about this bride
[1:39:47] amen
[1:39:49] colossians chapter 3 verse 9
[1:39:51] now paul says you put off the old man's
[1:39:52] stuff here verse verse 9 says you've put
[1:39:54] on the new man which is renewed we're
[1:39:56] talking about renewing today the
[1:39:58] renewing of the mind it is renewed in
[1:40:00] knowledge or epinosis
[1:40:03] after the image of him that created him
[1:40:06] in other words whatever that image of
[1:40:08] him looks like that's what you're gonna
[1:40:10] look like so the more you see what this
[1:40:12] is the more you're gonna be like it
[1:40:15] because this testifies of you
[1:40:18] listen the whole word is actually
[1:40:20] testifying of christ and his bride his
[1:40:23] plan of redemption from cover to cover
[1:40:26] from chapter one to the last chapter is
[1:40:29] speaking about his great love affair his
[1:40:31] purpose in redeeming a bride
[1:40:37] again ephesians chapter 4 be renewed in
[1:40:39] the spirit of your mind that you've put
[1:40:41] on the new man which is after god
[1:40:44] created in righteousness
[1:40:46] and true holiness
[1:40:48] it's his holiness amen
[1:40:50] i mentioned this earlier but i want you
[1:40:51] to remember the token of today
[1:40:53] it's only effective
[1:40:55] if it's on display
[1:40:58] it's not just enough to have a new man
[1:40:59] you must put on a new man
[1:41:02] what does that even mean it means to
[1:41:03] take upon you the identity of christ you
[1:41:06] have his potentials you have his not
[1:41:09] you're not the person of jesus christ
[1:41:11] but you are identified in his nature
[1:41:14] you're identified as his bride amen
[1:41:18] brother man talks about this in the
[1:41:19] supreme church change in the chapter i
[1:41:21] don't quote from the church's book a lot
[1:41:23] is that all right
[1:41:24] you know i go someplace to start
[1:41:25] throwing rocks at me
[1:41:28] praise the lord he said something about
[1:41:30] his book he's got a book somewhere
[1:41:32] amen
[1:41:34] brother man talks about he said
[1:41:35] pentecost believe that when you receive
[1:41:36] the new birth he said that they believe
[1:41:38] subsequently later
[1:41:40] you get the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:41:42] and the problem was that their idea of a
[1:41:44] new birth it was an intellectual
[1:41:46] conception
[1:41:48] well we got a new birth we acknowledge
[1:41:49] god but then later we're going to
[1:41:51] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:41:53] and then we'll have power but brother
[1:41:54] brown makes the point life and power
[1:41:57] come together
[1:41:59] in other words if you have his life you
[1:42:01] have his power you don't have one and
[1:42:04] not the other amen to have his power is
[1:42:07] to have his life to have his life is to
[1:42:09] have his power that's why they're one
[1:42:11] and the same
[1:42:13] praise the lord
[1:42:15] so the problem is our worldly thinking
[1:42:17] amen but the man makes this statement
[1:42:19] humble thyself 63 he says just get away
[1:42:21] from all your worldly thinking humble
[1:42:24] yourself before god and you've got more
[1:42:26] power than the man that runs all over
[1:42:28] the building and makes a big lot of
[1:42:30] noise see because you have been able to
[1:42:32] conquer yourself
[1:42:34] [Music]
[1:42:38] what's stopping me from realizing who
[1:42:40] i'm supposed to be in christ is it the
[1:42:41] pastor the deacon brother so-and-so my
[1:42:43] wife my husband i hope you don't feel
[1:42:45] that way
[1:42:46] but if you do that's not who it is
[1:42:48] your biggest obstacle is you
[1:42:52] when you can conquer you you've got more
[1:42:54] power than a man that can run around
[1:42:57] you've got more power than a man that's
[1:42:58] been elected you've got more power than
[1:43:00] a dictator you've got power to conquer
[1:43:03] yourself
[1:43:06] and he that rules his spirit he's
[1:43:07] greater than them that can rule a city
[1:43:10] he that is slow to anger is better than
[1:43:12] the mighty
[1:43:14] real powers power over your own flesh
[1:43:18] he says that's really power you show me
[1:43:21] a church you got to show it to him now
[1:43:23] gotta be on display now amen you show me
[1:43:25] a church that's humble real humble not
[1:43:28] an arrogancy a church just a sweet
[1:43:31] humble church i'll show you a church
[1:43:33] that has the favor and power of god in
[1:43:37] it
[1:43:38] i pray god let it be here today
[1:43:40] if the world don't see it may that be
[1:43:42] god's testimony
[1:43:44] that god sees a church here today with
[1:43:46] the humility and the character and the
[1:43:49] power of christ on display
[1:43:53] people that praise for revelation
[1:43:56] because like i said the image you're
[1:43:57] looking at
[1:43:58] is the image you're going to reflect
[1:44:01] familiar scripture here
[1:44:03] ii corinthians the third
[1:44:04] chapter paul says now the lord is that
[1:44:07] spirit and where the spirit of the lord
[1:44:08] is there is liberty
[1:44:12] get ready to go to liberty here hey man
[1:44:14] get ready for july 4th listen you've got
[1:44:16] a greater listen we got liberty from the
[1:44:18] british 200 and i'm not going to count
[1:44:20] it right now i should have counted for
[1:44:21] the sermon
[1:44:22] it used to be a little bit faster this
[1:44:24] lesson in in just under 300 years look
[1:44:27] at the direction of this country look at
[1:44:29] the things that have happened the
[1:44:31] liberty they they bled for and they
[1:44:33] suffered for and they died for it's not
[1:44:35] what it was back then but you've got a
[1:44:37] liberty
[1:44:38] where they put you in the darkest cell
[1:44:41] they can put you in jail like paul and
[1:44:43] silas but you're the freest people
[1:44:45] that's ever lived on the face of the
[1:44:46] earth because you're free in christ
[1:44:51] where the spirit of the lord is i ask
[1:44:52] you is he here today
[1:44:54] if he's here today where the spirit of
[1:44:56] the lord is there is liberty
[1:44:59] [Music]
[1:45:00] don't be entangled again stand fast in
[1:45:03] this liberty
[1:45:06] we all with open face beholdings in a
[1:45:08] glass or a mirror the glory of the lord
[1:45:10] were changed in the same image from
[1:45:13] glory to glory
[1:45:15] even it's by the spirit of the lord now
[1:45:17] some people stop there and they say well
[1:45:19] you know i i see the tapes i read the
[1:45:21] bible i do all these things
[1:45:23] but james talks about the same thing i
[1:45:25] want you to notice how he qualifies this
[1:45:26] here in james chapter two i'm sorry
[1:45:28] chapter 1 verse 22.
[1:45:30] he says but be doers
[1:45:33] of the word and not hearers only
[1:45:36] deceiving who your own selves
[1:45:39] who's deceiving you your own self
[1:45:42] your own self's the problem deceiving
[1:45:44] your own selves if any be a hearer of
[1:45:46] the word and not a doer he is like unto
[1:45:48] a man be holding his natural face in a
[1:45:50] glass or a mirror again same thing paul
[1:45:52] was talking about
[1:45:53] for he beholdeth himself
[1:45:56] and he goes his way and straightway
[1:45:58] forgetteth
[1:46:01] he forgetteth what manner of man he was
[1:46:04] but whoso looketh into the perfect law
[1:46:06] of liberty and continueth
[1:46:09] therein he being not a forgetful hearer
[1:46:12] but a doer of the work this man shall be
[1:46:16] blessed in his deed
[1:46:19] so in other words if your knowledge of
[1:46:20] the word of god exceeds your obedience
[1:46:22] to the word of god you're backslidden
[1:46:25] it doesn't matter how much you can shout
[1:46:26] or jump or dance amen you you must
[1:46:29] conform yourself not to the world but to
[1:46:31] this word of god
[1:46:33] this is a second handed robe you you
[1:46:35] don't cut it to fit you you've got to
[1:46:36] grow into it amen
[1:46:39] we've we've got a capstone ministry
[1:46:41] listen the whole world's looking for
[1:46:43] this you say why why does it seem like
[1:46:44] things are getting worse and worse all
[1:46:46] the time because the world's getting
[1:46:47] worse and worse
[1:46:49] but why it's groaning
[1:46:51] it's travailing
[1:46:53] because it's trying to produce something
[1:46:55] and the same thing's in you
[1:46:57] it's waiting for the manifestation
[1:47:01] of the sons of god
[1:47:04] it's waiting for something to come on
[1:47:06] display
[1:47:07] it's waiting for transforming power
[1:47:10] that's in the sons of god now
[1:47:13] amen praise the lord
[1:47:16] peter says this if he talks about the
[1:47:18] statue of a perfect man he says if these
[1:47:20] things be in you and abound they make
[1:47:21] you you shall neither be buried nor
[1:47:23] unfruitful in the knowledge epignosis of
[1:47:26] our lord jesus christ but he that lacks
[1:47:29] these things is blind and cannot see
[1:47:31] afar off and has forgotten he does it
[1:47:34] again forgotten that he was purged from
[1:47:38] his old sins
[1:47:40] wherefore brother give diligence to make
[1:47:42] your calling an election sure for if you
[1:47:44] do these things ye shall never fall
[1:47:49] i believe that's why there's a bride
[1:47:50] predestined not to fall in this age
[1:47:52] she's predestined because the word says
[1:47:54] if these things are in you
[1:47:56] and they are by the message
[1:47:57] you say how do you know because the
[1:47:59] capstone of it came down
[1:48:01] if it's in you ye shall never fall
[1:48:04] you're not talking about your naturality
[1:48:06] he's talking about the power of
[1:48:08] transformation you can fall seven times
[1:48:10] and get right back up
[1:48:13] because the power is in you to do it
[1:48:17] praise the lord
[1:48:18] i want to read this here a quick token
[1:48:19] message 63 brother ram says not only was
[1:48:22] jesus just a human life to come back on
[1:48:24] us it was god himself manifested in
[1:48:27] flesh that brought back upon us the
[1:48:29] adoption of sons that now amen
[1:48:33] now we are the sons and daughters of god
[1:48:35] that is the token
[1:48:39] what are you saying brother the life of
[1:48:40] christ on display that we are now
[1:48:43] somebody say now now we are now the sons
[1:48:46] and daughters of god that's the token
[1:48:49] so let me say it this way if there's no
[1:48:51] adoption there is no token
[1:48:54] because they come together it's for the
[1:48:56] same purpose the manifestation of the
[1:48:59] sons of god
[1:49:03] see other seeds have had an anointing
[1:49:05] but they didn't have sonship
[1:49:07] amen that's why there's no token outside
[1:49:10] of adoption because there's no life to
[1:49:12] bear witness according to galatians 4
[1:49:14] his spirit in you bears witness
[1:49:17] it is a representation or a token that
[1:49:20] we are the sons of god whereby we cry
[1:49:22] abba father
[1:49:24] i'll give you this i want to talk about
[1:49:26] this for a second here when abram when
[1:49:28] he goes by the ward of the lord and
[1:49:29] decaying and he leaves the land of ur
[1:49:32] and he comes the land of canaan he found
[1:49:35] that when he was in that promised land
[1:49:36] though god told him to be there he
[1:49:38] lacked the ability to produce the
[1:49:41] promised son
[1:49:42] and and years go by and he realizes that
[1:49:44] as the years go by he gets weaker all
[1:49:46] the time
[1:49:47] here's abram he knows he's called there
[1:49:50] and god comes and speaks to him and he
[1:49:52] lets him know listen i'm going to put
[1:49:53] myself into your name you're no longer
[1:49:56] to be called abram i'm going to call you
[1:49:58] abraham a father of nations
[1:50:01] now this is a man that's almost 100
[1:50:03] years old
[1:50:05] i call you a father of nations
[1:50:07] i'm changing your name i'm giving you a
[1:50:09] different identification
[1:50:12] and abram's looking himself abraham how
[1:50:15] am i going to do this i think i go
[1:50:16] charles this eleazar he's the air my
[1:50:20] house
[1:50:22] god says i'm going to do it i'm going to
[1:50:23] perform it according to the time of life
[1:50:27] at the appointed hour i will produce it
[1:50:31] listen abram and abraham in his own
[1:50:33] strength he tries to do it and he fails
[1:50:35] and listen abraham doesn't even want to
[1:50:36] go along with it
[1:50:38] he's oh god that ishmael might live
[1:50:40] before you forever no
[1:50:42] you're going to have a son
[1:50:44] it's not going to be according to your
[1:50:45] ability
[1:50:46] but in your weakness and your inability
[1:50:48] i will produce a promise
[1:50:51] you and sarah
[1:50:53] she shall conceive and you shall have a
[1:50:55] child how was he going to do it by the
[1:50:57] power of transformation
[1:51:00] their bodies were unable to produce the
[1:51:02] promise but god had a transformation and
[1:51:05] when they were transformed they would
[1:51:07] find the ability to overcome they would
[1:51:10] find the power to produce the promise
[1:51:12] that was not there before
[1:51:17] a father of nations brother represent a
[1:51:19] type of the adoption he said abraham h a
[1:51:22] m god added his that the the letter in
[1:51:25] there we put it in our our modern
[1:51:26] english h.a.m brother said never throw
[1:51:29] out all the church history have you ever
[1:51:30] had one h.a.m seven letters we've had a
[1:51:33] gram but when this one comes
[1:51:37] h.a.m seven letters i believe we've had
[1:51:39] it in this age william marion branham
[1:51:42] b-r-a-h
[1:51:44] p-r-a-n-h-a-m
[1:51:46] i should really put this stuff down
[1:51:49] well they were ignorant unlearned too i
[1:51:50] guess
[1:51:54] listen this prophet this messenger this
[1:51:56] is unlike any other ministry we've ever
[1:51:58] had it's a representation of the same
[1:52:00] thing that abraham received will kill it
[1:52:03] come and discern the thoughts and
[1:52:04] intents of the heart
[1:52:07] this prophet
[1:52:08] this prophet is different than other men
[1:52:10] he received an everlasting sign when
[1:52:13] brother brown was running on the truck
[1:52:14] one day brother baby said look at that
[1:52:16] mountain range over there look at them
[1:52:17] seven peaks that represents your life
[1:52:19] your ministry i'm gonna give you an
[1:52:21] everlasting sign
[1:52:23] i do believe i don't believe god just
[1:52:25] gave that sign for the man william
[1:52:26] branham i believe he give it for us who
[1:52:29] under this ministry are caught in the
[1:52:31] adoption of sons
[1:52:37] what makes us different than any other
[1:52:39] group of people on the face of the earth
[1:52:42] or even other groups that just claim to
[1:52:43] believe the message
[1:52:44] well the church
[1:52:46] the churches
[1:52:47] go into the tribulation for their
[1:52:49] purification but we don't
[1:52:51] why because we've been identified
[1:52:54] by a prophet look we didn't identify
[1:52:56] ourselves that way
[1:52:57] we've been identified by a messenger
[1:52:59] h.a.m as the bride of jesus christ
[1:53:02] that's what makes it the same
[1:53:04] melchizedek
[1:53:06] that spoke back there has taken a veil
[1:53:09] in this day and spoken to us and
[1:53:11] performed the same works to call you
[1:53:14] under the fullness of adoption
[1:53:18] he's visited us again according to the
[1:53:20] time of life amen
[1:53:22] notice abraham's overcoming was found in
[1:53:24] transformation
[1:53:26] he could not overcome he could not
[1:53:28] produce the promise till he had been
[1:53:29] transformed amen
[1:53:32] listen god couldn't give abraham he said
[1:53:34] well yeah ishmael good job man
[1:53:36] that's totally i i think of that god
[1:53:38] doesn't need your thought
[1:53:40] god has it all thought out already amen
[1:53:42] his thought was before the foundation of
[1:53:44] the world
[1:53:45] abraham didn't need to produce a promise
[1:53:47] in his own strength he needed to try to
[1:53:48] help god he needed transformed according
[1:53:51] to the word of god
[1:53:52] transformation brought the ability to
[1:53:55] produce the promise
[1:53:58] amen
[1:54:00] god waits till they're in their
[1:54:01] feebleness to transform them back to
[1:54:03] their youth
[1:54:04] amen i submit to you
[1:54:06] as i'm closing here this afternoon i
[1:54:08] submit to you that many of the things in
[1:54:09] our life
[1:54:10] that we wrestle with we wrestle with it
[1:54:12] because god is wanting transformation in
[1:54:15] our lives
[1:54:17] we look at problems we look at fires we
[1:54:18] look at things say we need to pray about
[1:54:20] this and fix this and fix that
[1:54:22] many times we miss the biggest obstacle
[1:54:24] is our own will about it
[1:54:27] our own attitude about it
[1:54:29] because god's not just wanting to fix a
[1:54:31] problem he's willing to transform you
[1:54:34] to where you can overcome the problem
[1:54:36] like he did with abraham
[1:54:39] you know i think of peter when he was
[1:54:40] there in the garden with jesus
[1:54:43] and they they come to take our lord as a
[1:54:44] robber you know
[1:54:46] peter sees a problem
[1:54:48] he does what most
[1:54:49] pulls out of the sword and chops the ear
[1:54:50] off
[1:54:52] that'll show him
[1:54:54] we'll run him out of here
[1:54:56] jesus like no put that away you're
[1:54:58] missing the bigger picture
[1:55:00] listen jesus if jesus wanted to now
[1:55:02] remember this he's quite capable
[1:55:05] it's not outside of his ability
[1:55:08] he is able to change the situation in a
[1:55:10] moment
[1:55:11] he can call for 12 legions of angels and
[1:55:14] change the whole scene he could wipe out
[1:55:16] the whole earth the problem is not as a
[1:55:18] lack of ability
[1:55:20] but peter was missing the bigger picture
[1:55:22] it's not about how big the sword is it's
[1:55:25] not about if i can wipe these guys out
[1:55:26] jesus has to go there
[1:55:29] he's missing the bigger picture
[1:55:32] listen the biggest problem that night
[1:55:34] the the only thing that stood between us
[1:55:36] redemption that night was not peter
[1:55:39] it wasn't judas
[1:55:40] it wasn't the guards there was one thing
[1:55:42] that stood between redemption for us or
[1:55:45] damnation it was jesus christ's own will
[1:55:51] his own will
[1:55:54] there was this i'm talking about the
[1:55:55] savior and i'm not talking about a man
[1:55:56] born in sin his will was the only thing
[1:55:58] that would have stood in the way but he
[1:56:00] prayed and he said father
[1:56:02] nevertheless
[1:56:04] not my will
[1:56:06] thine be done
[1:56:08] and when he prayed that and he made that
[1:56:10] his stand there was enough powers in
[1:56:13] hell to stop him that night
[1:56:15] [Applause]
[1:56:20] oh my
[1:56:22] how many times in our own life we look
[1:56:23] at the problem
[1:56:24] maybe your will your own idea
[1:56:27] because i want you to remember what we
[1:56:28] read at the beginning be transformed
[1:56:29] that you might prove what is that good
[1:56:32] acceptable perfect will of god not your
[1:56:34] will
[1:56:35] his will in other words you cannot prove
[1:56:37] the will of god until your mind is
[1:56:39] transformed
[1:56:40] and must be transformed so you can prove
[1:56:44] the good
[1:56:45] acceptable and perfect will of god
[1:56:47] many times in our own will
[1:56:50] we go about trying to remedy whatever
[1:56:52] problems in our way we we say
[1:56:53] circumstances and and we know how we
[1:56:55] want it resolved and we miss what god's
[1:56:57] trying to do amen
[1:56:59] but i believe that the more god lives in
[1:57:01] you and the more god sees through you
[1:57:03] the more you'll see him at work amen may
[1:57:05] god help us
[1:57:06] i pray today to transform our way of
[1:57:09] thinking about that person that
[1:57:10] persecutes us
[1:57:12] man
[1:57:13] about our attitude uh may god transform
[1:57:15] our attitudes towards our circumstances
[1:57:18] at home or at work or whatever it is
[1:57:19] amen listen we might face a lot of
[1:57:21] criticism in our life but i want you to
[1:57:23] understand god sees something in you
[1:57:26] that he can transcend that
[1:57:29] god's not looking to take away the
[1:57:30] critics
[1:57:31] he's looking for you to live in a place
[1:57:33] where it doesn't affect you
[1:57:35] can i tell a story here real quick i was
[1:57:37] just talking to brother yesterday about
[1:57:38] this we're talking about people with
[1:57:39] complexes and how they get an attitude
[1:57:41] and you know some people they some
[1:57:43] people just won't like you no matter
[1:57:44] what you do and when you get to a place
[1:57:46] in your life you stop trying to please
[1:57:47] everybody you're a lot further up the
[1:57:48] road
[1:57:49] but i was talking about a certain person
[1:57:51] i didn't tell him who and i'm not going
[1:57:52] to tell you don't ask
[1:57:57] this this person's got like nothing nice
[1:57:59] to say about me well i don't have a
[1:58:00] whole lot to say either i guess so not
[1:58:02] me not them
[1:58:04] no they they said this about me and
[1:58:06] they've called me this name they've
[1:58:07] they've said to other people
[1:58:11] all these things about me i was talking
[1:58:13] to this brother about i said you know
[1:58:14] what that person realized they were
[1:58:15] blessing me the whole time
[1:58:18] say really brother how's that i said the
[1:58:20] bible says blessed
[1:58:21] are ye
[1:58:22] when men shall revile you
[1:58:25] and persecute you
[1:58:28] he didn't know he was blessing me the
[1:58:29] whole time every time he opens his mouth
[1:58:31] and calls me another filthy name i said
[1:58:33] he's just blessing me he don't even
[1:58:35] realize it
[1:58:38] blessed are you when men shall revile
[1:58:40] you
[1:58:41] and persecute you and say oh man
[1:58:43] interview about you falsely for my name
[1:58:44] sake don't get upset
[1:58:47] don't cry about us oh god i wish i
[1:58:48] wouldn't say those things rejoice
[1:58:52] you're missing the point god's blessing
[1:58:54] you
[1:58:56] rejoice and be exceeding glad for so
[1:58:58] persecuted they the prophets which were
[1:59:01] before you
[1:59:02] god is allowing you to be identified
[1:59:04] with the same reproach that the prophets
[1:59:07] and men of old word identified with yes
[1:59:10] you know brook i'm about you but praise
[1:59:12] god
[1:59:14] praise god they had something to say
[1:59:15] about me today
[1:59:18] now don't give them something mean to
[1:59:19] say about you
[1:59:21] listen if they say it about you and
[1:59:22] there's no reason to say it you are a
[1:59:24] partaker of the same thing that christ
[1:59:26] was a partaker of
[1:59:28] the reproaches from them that fell on
[1:59:29] thee they fell on me
[1:59:33] see you you don't have to you don't have
[1:59:35] to stop what they're saying you just
[1:59:37] transcend
[1:59:39] trent you don't you know what praise god
[1:59:40] they're blessed listen if they say
[1:59:42] something nice about you they're
[1:59:43] blessing you they say something mean
[1:59:44] about you they're blessing you
[1:59:46] either way you're just blessed all the
[1:59:48] time if you can see it
[1:59:52] well that helps somebody today amen
[1:59:56] next time somebody calls you something
[1:59:57] like praise god thank you for blessing
[1:59:58] me
[2:00:00] just look around the i tell you what
[2:00:03] that'll probably make him more mad than
[2:00:04] anything actually it usually does
[2:00:06] well you're just such a such thank you
[2:00:08] so much
[2:00:10] god sure loves me god i sure used you to
[2:00:13] bless me
[2:00:18] it's all right take a break for a minute
[2:00:21] praise the lord
[2:00:23] listen if you can't transcend
[2:00:26] criticism
[2:00:27] and embrace our attitude you can never
[2:00:29] be a partaker of that blessing
[2:00:32] if you can't rejoice and be exceeding
[2:00:33] glad that persecutions you can't ever
[2:00:35] partake that blessing there must be a
[2:00:37] transformation because listen i'll be
[2:00:39] honest my old man in that situation had
[2:00:41] a deck the guy
[2:00:44] that wasn't me
[2:00:46] there's a new man on the inside doing
[2:00:47] that
[2:00:48] that's not you enduring it christ in you
[2:00:51] he's the one doing it rejoice and be
[2:00:54] exceeding glad great is your reward
[2:00:58] oh my listen the power lies in you by
[2:01:01] the holy it's not about special meaning
[2:01:02] it's not about special anointing the
[2:01:04] power of transformation in you will make
[2:01:07] you a partaker of that blessing amen
[2:01:10] how many here are witnesses of the power
[2:01:11] of transformation
[2:01:13] because you're not what you used to be
[2:01:14] listen lots of people change in their
[2:01:16] lives we see people change all the time
[2:01:18] and lots of times it's not for the
[2:01:20] better
[2:01:21] well listen the transformation i'm
[2:01:22] talking about for you it's for your good
[2:01:25] amen it's not it's not a replacement
[2:01:27] it's an upgrade
[2:01:29] there's no downside to it this isn't
[2:01:31] like when then microsoft updates you
[2:01:33] update your computer that crashes for
[2:01:34] three weeks i thought that's not an
[2:01:36] upgrade they ruined my computer
[2:01:39] i had to restart the whole you know
[2:01:40] praise god so you know what i'm talking
[2:01:41] about oh here we're going to upgrade
[2:01:43] your computer takes five minutes that
[2:01:44] was the worst thing i ever did with my
[2:01:46] computer
[2:01:48] and throw that thing out they ask me
[2:01:50] about once a month you want to upgrade
[2:01:51] to windows 11. no i don't
[2:01:54] been there but sure is bad it was my
[2:01:56] computer whatever
[2:01:58] listen there's no downside to this
[2:02:00] upgrade amen amen god's power of
[2:02:02] transformation
[2:02:04] it's an upgrade for us we thank god for
[2:02:06] it amen
[2:02:07] you're not what you used to be but
[2:02:09] you're gonna be what he wants you to be
[2:02:10] listen if you're in the hand of god
[2:02:12] you're exactly what he wants you to be
[2:02:14] you might not feel like but you're
[2:02:15] exactly what he wants you to be right
[2:02:17] now
[2:02:18] if you can accept that and thank god for
[2:02:21] it think about how much how much lighter
[2:02:24] the burdens get you know the scripture
[2:02:25] says
[2:02:26] jesus said that my yoke is easy
[2:02:29] my burdens light
[2:02:31] a lot of us we find ourselves encumbered
[2:02:33] all the time with just loads of care i
[2:02:35] just don't i'm gonna make it you're
[2:02:36] carrying a yolk he didn't put on you
[2:02:39] lay it down
[2:02:41] you weren't meant to carry that you're
[2:02:43] some you're
[2:02:44] transformed you're you're not there to
[2:02:47] bear those kind of that's the world amen
[2:02:49] you've got something else to bear his
[2:02:50] yoke
[2:02:52] amen the power lies in you the rapture
[2:02:54] lies in you it's the power of
[2:02:56] transformation the power
[2:02:58] to transform
[2:02:59] it's the power to transcend
[2:03:02] amen not just overcome a problem but
[2:03:04] transcend it
[2:03:06] amen god bless you just stand to your
[2:03:07] feet
[2:03:11] oh i believe the seed of abraham is
[2:03:13] present today
[2:03:15] like their father abraham this
[2:03:17] transforming power in them
[2:03:21] to transcend the situations
[2:03:23] and the inabilities
[2:03:25] and the complexes that they're wrestling
[2:03:27] with today
[2:03:30] church i believe there's a great liberty
[2:03:32] here by the spirit
[2:03:34] it's the greatest liberty you'll ever
[2:03:35] know
[2:03:36] it's the freedom from yourself
[2:03:38] the freedom from your past
[2:03:40] the freedom from your own misgivings
[2:03:42] the freedom from pride
[2:03:44] the freedom from whatever would would
[2:03:46] trouble you in your lives
[2:03:51] as you bow your heads maybe today you
[2:03:54] we're all we're all dealing with
[2:03:57] something i don't have to ask for a show
[2:03:58] of hands every one of us
[2:04:00] is dealing with something if we weren't
[2:04:01] we
[2:04:03] we'd probably already been glory i guess
[2:04:05] as you bow your heads though
[2:04:08] meditate today
[2:04:10] what you're going through i want you to
[2:04:11] realize god put something in you
[2:04:14] [Music]
[2:04:17] to transform
[2:04:20] our attitudes
[2:04:22] the way we look at things
[2:04:25] our perspective
[2:04:27] so many times we're limited by how we
[2:04:29] look at a situation i pray today we just
[2:04:31] look to god and say lord
[2:04:34] show me the bigger picture
[2:04:37] lord help me to see what you're trying
[2:04:39] to do in my life
[2:04:41] lord i've let so many things distract me
[2:04:44] i want my heart to be fastened after
[2:04:46] your will
[2:04:49] i want to be steadfast unmoving always
[2:04:52] abounding in the work of the lord
[2:04:58] as we pray i just want you to pray
[2:05:00] yourselves as well pray with me today
[2:05:04] for that need in your life god help us
[2:05:06] as we pray heavenly father
[2:05:10] what i'm so thankful today
[2:05:13] when i go through certain situations in
[2:05:15] my life
[2:05:16] i recognize there's been a change
[2:05:20] there's been a change in me
[2:05:23] but i've made many mistakes
[2:05:26] i've missed the picture many times
[2:05:29] but it seems like we're just full of
[2:05:30] mistakes like your prophet said
[2:05:33] a prophetess told us that god could even
[2:05:35] take these mistakes in our life
[2:05:38] and use them to fulfill his purpose
[2:05:41] lord i pray for each one today as
[2:05:43] they're praying
[2:05:44] the different needs in their lives or
[2:05:46] their homes and families
[2:05:47] [Music]
[2:05:49] many times we go through things and we
[2:05:50] wonder lord
[2:05:51] [Music]
[2:05:53] why am i going through this
[2:05:54] [Music]
[2:05:56] why is this come upon me
[2:05:59] but lord you're you're changing us
[2:06:01] you're bringing us up a little bit
[2:06:02] higher
[2:06:04] you're putting us in a position to have
[2:06:05] a testimony
[2:06:07] of overcoming
[2:06:09] it might be a help to another believer
[2:06:10] here today it might be help to a wayward
[2:06:13] loved one whatever it would be lord
[2:06:15] you're using our lives
[2:06:18] and it's transforming power
[2:06:20] to transform others as well
[2:06:23] lord we
[2:06:24] may we lay down once again our wills
[2:06:26] today
[2:06:29] may we allow the power of transformation
[2:06:31] to change the way we think
[2:06:33] about ourselves about others
[2:06:36] about your will
[2:06:37] may we not read this bible like a
[2:06:39] newspaper
[2:06:41] with our own ideas
[2:06:42] and trying to find our opinion in these
[2:06:45] pages
[2:06:46] but may we allow the word of god to
[2:06:48] shape
[2:06:49] and to mold and to fashion us from glory
[2:06:52] to glory
[2:06:54] from faith to virtue to knowledge
[2:06:59] all the way into this capstone
[2:07:01] i believe perfect love it's the greatest
[2:07:03] thing we could ever ask for it's the
[2:07:05] greatest gift we could ever receive
[2:07:07] it's the only thing that has the
[2:07:08] transforming
[2:07:10] the overcoming power to take us into
[2:07:12] that dimension
[2:07:14] lord i pray for each one here today may
[2:07:15] you bless them
[2:07:17] surely blessing may you bless the seed
[2:07:19] of abraham
[2:07:20] may you exceedingly abundantly bless
[2:07:22] them
[2:07:23] and cause your face to shine upon them
[2:07:25] lord we give you the praise and the
[2:07:27] glory and the honor now
[2:07:28] we thank you for this
[2:07:30] beautiful group of people your children
