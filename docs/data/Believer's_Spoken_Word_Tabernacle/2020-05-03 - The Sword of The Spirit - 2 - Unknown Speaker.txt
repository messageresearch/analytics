just some of the things and haven't exactly set on a date right right now but it's very very soon the Lord willing and so I want just to be Tuesday I want to address some of those things so I just asked that you just continue to keep us in prayer and just for the leading of the Lord so be watching your email be also there with us on Tuesday evening in the chat because those are I'm gonna use that platform to make these things known we just want to turn our attention to the word of the Lord here this morning and so thankful for the grace of God that has come to us and if we could we want to just look here right into the scriptures and I'm just gonna read one verse of scripture and then we'll just ask the blessing of the Lord upon the word and that's out of Ephesians 6 verse 17 I want to just draw from that scripture and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God and we want to just deal with that a little bit more here this morning the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God let's just bow our heads and our hearts before him Heavenly Father Lord as we are just so thankful Oh God for your great mercy we're thankful that Lord that Calvary is not just something Lord of a historical event but God there is victory that was released that day on Calvary and when that that day becomes a reality Lord in our hearts Oh God then the joy bells ring Lord what Liberty sounds within our hearts and Lord we're thankful God Lord to be partakers of your divine nature Lord and we just asked this morning that Lord that your presence would just come among us Lord visiting every home and every heart in a very personal way I pray that God that you would just just take control now Lord minister to our hearts Lord as the songs of Zion have been sung oh God we just ask that you'll come and not if there be anything any spirit or anything that would be contrary we ask God may the Holy Spirit just drive that out oh God because the Lord in reality the person or individuals Lord they wouldn't want to be that way so we ask God if there be anything that's contrary Lord to your nature to your word Lord we ask that God that the Holy Spirit Lord would just soul drive that out Oh God that the word might find its mark and its place God in every heart in every life Lord we just ask that God your blessing Lord just visiting every heart in every home Lord where they are gathered Lauren Lord as we look into your word now we ask these things Lord all in the precious name of Jesus Christ for the glory of Almighty God amen and amen amen god bless yous are being seated I want to continue to look at this with the sword of the Spirit and we're looking at our our armor our warfare and what belongs to us as the children of God and Paul is speaking to the Ephesian believers admonishing their hearts and their lives to be strengthened with the power of his might we know that it must be God's strength inside of us that is a promise all the way in through the scriptures that it must be God's strength and when we say God's strength we know that even within that it's that God is just working within our hearts and our lives as we are yielded to him and when we we come into this place as Paul remember taking inspiration from looking at the soldier of which he was he was chained to there when he was there in Rome awaiting his trial and he would be able to examine the different parts of this armor and he would be able to take inspiration from there now that in itself we understand the inspiration that's given it comes into a supernatural part for you and I because though a person can look at us and say you don't look no different than anybody else but yet remember David had on an armor but yet it didn't look like he had on armor he didn't have on armor like Saul had but he did have armor and David David's armor was actually greater than the armor that saw had and the armor that David had was the Word of God that had been anointed in his life and that's what the real armor of God is is when the word has been wrapped up in our lives and has been expressed that's the full armor of God so there's a full issue and with this in mind when we think of that of the sword of the Spirit and I just keep moving with him these these points and being deliberate in it and when this sword by was thereupon that Roman soldier when they would look at that sword that sword Paul maybe Paul asking you know the the man was the sword and maybe talking about it I don't know but at any rate the sword itself that was upon the side of that soldier was it was what they called the gladium it was 24 inches long and the end the change that had come about is that it was sharp on both sides so we would cut coming and going and this sword when it was given to that Roman soldier it was noted it was a symbol of his full citizenship so these things that I'm just saying it in this manner that there are things of what God has done that we must take account of in our lives and you never get away from the simplicity of the working of what Christ has done in our lives what he has done is the strength that gives the you and I the strength to stand in this moment it is that courage you see it's something it's a work that's not a work of man Solomon would say under inspiration in the book of khaleesies whatsoever thing thou do us is perfect when God does something it's perfect this is why the confidence in the word it brings us to what is the real new birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost being born again all one in the same it brings us to the real reality of what it is and showing us so that our confidence it is not placed in emotions or experiences but whatever experience it comes into the word and we see the word present in our life that's where our courage is drawn from because you can have an emotion you can have an experience you can have a feeling and the very next day or this day you don't feel like it and we all remember Bill Duran talked about in his early even in his walk early walk was God and he had to recognize feeling does not mean anything he said for if we walk by feelings he said the devil can beat us around the stump every day but he said where I had to come to rest is you rest in the word see this is the goal of what the message of the hour has come to do it is that original message to establish us in the atonement by the baptism of the holy ghost so then we're then we recognize by the seal of the Living God in our hearts we recognize our full citizenship full authority so this is where the scripture how it comes in as we were looking here last week in the book of Galatians chapter 5 and verse 6 faith worketh by love that's how faith is operative now remember the scripture said though I have faith to move all mountains and I have not charity it's nothing so let me just say to you like this it shows there is a dividing line where a person can have great faith and yet be missing what is necessary are you with me they can have great faith this is the thing sometimes then in our minds we trying to figure out this person the miracles performed or they prayed for this person or this and then you see after some period of time here they are shipwrecked or they walk away from the truth and in your mind a mind cut tries to comprehend how was that done remember it was faith jesus said many will come to me in that day and they will say did not I cast out Devils in thy name is alright but Jesus will show the dividing line I never knew you you workers of iniquity you see what it did it built a false confidence in something that was not true you see this is why when the scripture said God is love remember the Holy Ghost and God are not two separate people it is the same person this is where that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the love of God oh I tell you it's hard I just feel like just moving here but you see this is where our as the Prophet would put it our try up for capstone it comes down upon our lives that we were always sheep we were always sons and daughters of God now we come to the realization by the Holy Ghost because he gives the Holy Ghost and the spirit it comes upon sons and daughters who did it come upon that a pentecost sons and daughters of god who did it fall upon chlorin sons and daughters of god who did it come upon on the river Jordan it came upon the Lord Jesus this was the tabernacle that was that was ordained of God to bring Redemption is that right you see the Holy Ghost is a claiming work but the claim is revealed in our hearts that the claim that God has made and it becomes revealed as the seal of the Living God that I belong to him Oh glory hallelujah you see it becomes an absolute which is an end of all strife this is where the dividing line faith worketh by love so this the dividing line is not just about as we said faith to move mountains miracles and say and listen miracles are a part of the real word you're in signs and wonders said they shall follow them that believe you understand what I'm talking about but this right here faith worketh by love we're talking about inheriting and taking the promises that belonged to us as believers we're not talking about just coming to church and my you know we see this miracle let me see that miracle I had prayed for this winner this was done or that was done but it must be faith that is taking promises this hour and the only way you can take promises for this hour it must be a faith that is governed by the love of God hallelujah glory be to God and now think of this this is where in this hour it's going to take a greater faith than what has been previously who can produce that man can produce that this is let me just say that this is God's responsibility are you with me it's God's responsibility to bring forth what is needed to move our faith into that of rapturing faith that is the responsibility of our husband of our bridegroom and I'm gonna I'm saying that like this he is performing his word in our lives this word this anointed word it is it listen I love to feel the presence of God but brother this anointed word it's doing more than a feeling it's driving away doubt and unbelief it is driving back the clouds upon our minds and upon our eyes this word that's why there is a prevailing power in this word that you know there's something in you that is greater hallelujah I feel like preaching a little bit this is where our confidence our confidence is in his love for us that's how promises are taken now it's not a confidence of just looking out there and say well he came down and he died on Calvary that's an expression of love you realized before you can ever love somebody else and really move into that there's got to be an expression of love or vice versa you express right the Bible said he that have friends truth himself friendly right even an expression of love you begin to pursue your wife maybe she started to pursue you who knows but you understand it was an expression are you with me now this is what Paul is trying to in the book of Romans and John is anointed by the Spirit of God to point out in the book of John that we are to understand the manifestation of God's love but remember God's love his manifestation he did not come here haphazardly he came here for redemption redemption is not an afterthought redemption is a reality from a forethought amen redemption to claim to buy back what rightfully belongs to one glory be to God so this is where that our our love see faith and love as brother Brandon would put it in perfect faith they are kinfolks they go together and to recognize listen this there this is a real real solid ground that you can stand on you can look has the Prophet says look what you were and look what you are he said then if you can see that then you got confidence he seen something in you and it's confidence what his covenants trust what is trust it is faith what are we resting it in his love and his love is conveyed from Calvary revealed by the spirit of the atonement that you are chosen and beloved of Almighty God that is the work of the atonement in the life in the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah what an evidence to stand on that's an evidence in your life then you know we're not just looking somewhere let me just say this morning if you the first thing you do must have and understand is he did die for your sin debt you've got to believe that first you've got to start somewhere you've got to start somewhere now listen to me you can stand right there on that word and you can start even with that word and say I'm saved oh my Oh glory be to God I feel so good I feel like just running well glory be to God in the highest this is ground for you to stand on but you know what you was but look what you are now and you say what does that have to do with the sword of the Spirit the sword of the Spirit must be handled with the strong hand of faith and there's only one thing that can bring real genuine faith and that is the love of God and God revealing his word by his Spirit that you are included and you are always a part of me brother and you see the effect it's not just a message that is passed through you it's a message that has taken a hold upon your life it has changed you the love of the world has passed away what are you saying I'm saying get out the gladium you're a full citizen whoo hallelujah you see God wants to make these things so clear and real his life he keeps reminding you and I he keeps showing you and I he keeps making it more and more real and just look at that that simplicity that what he has just spoken right here this morning that is enough for you to stand on it takes you it takes your attention away from your goodness and it brings it to the place it needs to be when Shamgar beat back the enemy with an ox code what did he do it based on that covenant he knew I'm a circumcised Jew hey man Shangri was not looking on was that good how good was I this week or how was like this or how was that that hinders faith come on now it hinders faith but faith is aware Paul dealt with the Galatian Church faith must rest in the sovereign complete work of Almighty God of what God has done in you what do you say sometimes you may not feel but you stand upon the word that you know the love of the world has passed from your life Luther sent me why don't you say I'm telling you quit looking at yourself you'll never get anywhere listen even in the initial beginnings where God is dealing with the life and they might feel so low and the devil just porn it on like you can never be you can never tell an you God will never tell you that that's a laugh and the pits of hell Satan is afraid if you start listening to the spirit and start yielding he will be driven out of your life because brother this word pacts authority whether it's believed in the heart the devil he begins to turn loose why faith causes him to turn loose what would you do I would receive his love that's what I do I just say man lord help down my unbelief I'd say Lord clean me up Lord God I'd accept I'd say Lord I receive your grace that's what I do and in doing that you black the devil's eye notice this here in the book of Solomon see this is where let me just work with this thought here a little bit this is where this this reality comes as it moves into our heart it's settled on that solid ground of who we are in Jesus Christ Song of Solomon 6 8 there are threescore queens and four score concubines and virgins without number my dove my undefiled is but one she is the only one of her mother did you hear what he called you my dove who's that doubt the death is the Holy Spirit come on now it's that which brings forth to manifest the feminine form that was hidden in mystery in the groom and he calls her my dove which what is dove it is that of the Spirit of God the life of Jesus Christ now revealed in a mini membered body revealed in your life what's he looking at my dove you certainly can't call this his dove he's calling the reflection of his life his image that has come forth from your womb my dove my undefiled is from one my first birth and your first birth cannot claim being undefined that's not what the blood of Jesus Christ does the blood of Jesus Christ don't kill up don't don't you know clean up our first birth no I don't the blood of Jesus Christ comes in and it annihilates or removes that old man that's why the scripture would tell us over and over Paul would write up in Colossians and Romans and refer to it that old man he would refer to Allah he's got addy he's got to die you can't clean that guy up it's like putting the pig inside of a house putting the bow tie on and cleaning him up and he'll look out the door and he'll wait for one chance to get out in that mud hole why because he still got the nature of the pig on the inside but if you can ever ignite the nature of a lamb on the inside of that Pig brother you don't have to worry about him wallowing in the mud no more on the outside this still looks like the same old temple but brother there's been a new nature set on the inside you'll look at him and say looks just like the rest of the pigs well why is he actin different it's because of the character of life that's on the inside of him and he's only responding and hapten glory be to God to the character of the life that's on the inside of him my undefiled is what one she is the only one of her mother she is the choice one of her that bear her but daughter's saw her and blessed her yeah the Queen's and the combines they praised her who is she verse 10 that look at forth as the morning fair as the moon clear as the Sun and terrible as an army with banners then they read another scripture that it is spoke of her just like that in the same same scripture chapter thou art beautiful oh my love has tearsa comely as Jerusalem terrible as an army with banners so to see the beauty of the love of God revealed in the feminine form my dove my undefiled one and to see that beauty what delicateness what grace but yet when it comes to stand for all that her husband is all that her lover is she will stand and then the approach is she's terrible as an army with banners terrible meaning awesome dreadful what she knows who she belongs to she's acting with a genuine courage that she knows that it is not Ivan liver but Christ that liveth in me my love my dove my undefiled one all my love you see she is taking in of what he's saying you know friends it will make no difference it'll do no good by just hearing the word you've got to receive it you might look at it and say we're both saying I just can't seem to see that for my life but it isn't about whether you see that right now for your life but it is to accept what he is saying about you let's get it on the right track it's not your eyes and then God's going according to your eyes but it is God's eyes that are set forth upon us that we might be able to see ourselves as God sees us and it all starts out sometimes it starts out with the simplicity of us receiving and confessing even what we don't even feel or even that we don't even believe clear down into the depths yet but remember simple simple statement I know but brother Bantam told us he says your confession your positive confession will make will bring your body into subjection it'll drop from here down here that's what we want Solomon Song of Solomon to verse four he brought me to the banqueting table notice he brought me here to the lying house now this this chapter it's written about love that that part of love and where that he is the bridegroom is bringing her into this place to be able to make himself known to her and she herself would make him make herself known to him notice he hath brought me to his banqueting table his the wine house the place where the wine is offered up and truly in this our brother we have been brought to the banqueting house we have been brought to that of the time of a wine that has actually been given out they could not say this in the days of Luther they could not say it in the days of Wesley they couldn't even say this in the days of Azusa Street but brother it's a time right now where there is a word that has come about an evening time light to produce evening time results there is a bride on earth not she will be the bride there is the bride right now on this earth and she is clothed she is concealed beneath the blood of Jesus Christ he has brought me to his banqueting house her glory and his banner over me was love Oh glory be to God and no wonder we need more wine no wonder we need more wine what does it do it what what do they you know they'll tell people well you know if you just take a little bit of wine it'll help you relax how they tell people those things and maybe you know it actually does with on somebody's body but all how much greater in the natural when we talk about real stimulation brother in charge taking hold in our life it causes you to love people you can't even understand it you can today they're totally different from you temperaments makeups or whatever more but there's something that just gets ahold of you you just love everybody and you realize the more and more that you will stay at the banqueting house staying in the presence of God brother this is what Jude said keep yourself in the love of God oh my and his banner his standard how but he has brought me here he's been loved how has God brought you how is he brought me to that of the new birth for where we are now even as adopted sons and daughters of God how has he done it did he do it out of you know hammering us did he do it out of judgment no his word comes to correctors but we perceive the word in that is love it's love letting us know hey there's a hold on your life but you don't have to submit to that hold any longer what is it it's the love of God that is sounding within the heart that lets us know that we can be free what's happening love is drawing us to him and the bride says stay me with flagons comfort me with apples for I am sick or overcome of love now let's look here at an example in the scripture and we have you just just look at the example of Queen Esther for just a few moments here this morning we find that here when Esther we know the situation that had come up were Queen Vashti she refused to come at the king's call he wanted her to come at an appointed time but she said I'm not going up there you're not going to show me off in front of all of the rest of those people up there you see she still had her own will but here comes the time for that of Esther you see this is where the reality of the word has it as brought four children down through the ages think about the bride being made up down through the ages it's been the body of Jesus Christ every time that the word has went forth it is that before the overcomers in that age to where their will has absolutely been overcome or they have submitted their to the will of God and they have reflected that portion of the word that of the body that was in that day in that time and now we come to a place to where this scripture here that was wrote that of Esther we realize this is a time it speaks of this time that we're in because remember in the Book of Revelations it says I stand on the door and knock and remember he speaks of how that the actual spirit of this age is one that says I am rich i'm increased with goods i have need of nothing but yet the Spirit of God would point back and say but you're naked now they might have been fully physically clothed but you see that ain't the clothing you go buy it you know a person might be so clothed let me just put it on down they might be clothed with quotes they've clothed with scriptures but it's being covered by the blood you're still under the judgment you must come under the blood the token must be applied this is the hour that we can see for Esther where the church themselves has put him out they have rejected him from being the same they do not want to be displayed they do not want the display of his divine power and nature will they want his blessings they want his miracles they want all those Saints but they don't want him because in order to have him he comes in and takes rulership over that life but remember he'll never do it forcefully it must always be willingly and here is Esther coming on the scene now we recognize that within this here that hair as Esther comes into this time she comes to her appointed meeting there before the King and the Bible tells us here in verse 15 that when you know she asked her it says the daughter of I beheld the uncle of Mordecai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go in unto the king she required nothing but what Haggai the Kings Chamberlain the keeper of the women appointed so a note in right away you see it's not she's not taking what she feels the King would like she's not saying well he'll like this if I if I do this or if I do that you see she's listened to me now she's in herself it's not trying to present things that would please him she is wanting to walk in there with the word covering her life because it will be that word reflected in her life that will please the king it's what he already has in his palace all glory being a God God has already provided in his word that's why the Prophet could say in marriage of the lamb in 1962 he said we have the material on the earth now to make the bride ready we have that material what is it that genuine holy goes the word coming to prepare her you see God did not add a new Bible the seven seals the opening of the seven seals on the back side of the book it was not another book it was not something that was contrary but John was instructed by the Spirit of God writing not John but seal it up and when those seven thunders would begin to sound brother it would be the seven thunders sounding the literal voice of Almighty God in Revelation that would turn the very hearts of the children back to the Apostolic fathers hallelujah glory be to God what was it it was already here Oh blessed be his name so after look at this Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her she was taken under king a haze raised in his house royal in the tenth month which is to Beth in the seventh year of his reign she goes in she goes into him revelations Tim seven are you with me she's taken there into the presence of the King you must become one with this word and the king look at this the King loved Esther above all the women oh let me preach on this a minute he didn't say the King didn't love the other women he didn't say that those other women went back out into the rest of the provinces no they came to him he loved them but they went to the house of the concubines they never went back out into the world well I'll tell you you're talking about saving grace there are many that will be saved if there had not been a decree for that a decree that had been made letters that had been made if there wasn't a gospel to go forth because of the flow there would have been many there would have been no house of a concubines but remember the rest of these women they were virgins now foolish but they were did not they were placed into the house of the concubines but there was something about Esther that he loved her more than the rest of the women you can see why the real election of God it's called loving his own children that came out of the loins of his mind of his word God loves them above those that are saved he loves them because why they are of his own self and the King loved Esther above all the women now watch this and she obtained Grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins now here's what he did she now could see this no doubt it would be something that would be witnessed in their conversations something about it that is so inclining to her but he wants to make it personal to her right now he wants his love to be made personal so here's what he did his love is now displayed so that he set the royal crown upon her head and made her Queen instead of Ashton so she actually has a crowning ornament of his love she is queen she is Queen because of his love that one now he has seen reflected in her she had a meekness about her life meekness meaning that it was not concerned or consumed with self she had a meekness about her remember that of the Bible says that a meek and quiet spirit is a high precious price in the side of Almighty God so here he or she has obtained favor and grace and force so that she might know this how would she know it because many women have went into his house and come out now you might say well you know he ain't sending her back to the house of the concubines but what is it that separates her from the rest that went into the house of the concubines what separates it it's because of the love that he has bestowed upon her and he has placed the crown upon her head all you see this is why listen to me now this is why that the revelation of Jesus Christ it is a very personal thing let me just kind of drop this in here just a little bit though the message goes forth remember the message was letters that went to all the provinces the message went to all of them now many many gathered that men there are many virgins that came now remember this the message itself it goes forth to all but the message is received individually behold I stand at the door and knock he's talking to an individual is that right he's put outside of the church but now notice be call goes to an individual let let he him that hath an ear that whosoever will hear my voice and open notice individual it is though a message that goes forth to all but it is actually received by individuals brother man would put it like this he said the message is received individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way each individual of that group is one who has the ability to hear what the Spirit is saying by the way of the messengers those who here are not getting their own private revelation nor is a group getting their collective revelation but each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from God so let's just bring it simple here we come let's just say to our little church right here here we come into this church and a person can come and sit right here right under the preaching of the word proclaiming the message of the hour and the Spirit of God is breaking forth and he's revealing his word and his presence but remember what God is doing for the group he must be pressing for your life individually this is not just this is not a group revelation you see that's that's organizational ISM that's denominationalism we're walking by somebody else's previous thought that's how organizations thoughts it starts remember what light that Luther received he received that personally but there were many who came in behind him they never met that same God in the same way that Luther had met him and what does it become it becomes an organization it becomes a group revelation but remember a group revelation will never keep the wrath off of you you've got to be under the blood personally in your life this is why it takes the endowment of the Spirit of God to be able to open our ear and let me just tell you something the devil would like nothing more for you to look at and say my to seem like nothing makes sense I don't seem like I understand this let me just tell you something right now before God got ahold of my life I didn't understand it either I knew it was the truth but I didn't understand it but brother when he begin to open my eyes these are things they are not confusing to me this message regardless of what the unbelievers have said they wanted to make it as though it don't make sense the problem is their eyes were never anointed their hearts were never fully turned back and restored that's why they couldn't see it is doesn't matter how much a person studies it all has to do with the openness and the willingness and the Spirit of God to sovereignly revealed this word so it's not something there of just a group this is why it is personal vindication in the days in the days of lot in the days of Abraham it was personal vindication God coming down personally and how did God come down personally he appeared in flesh it's the way the same God has appeared in these last days let me just say something though the prophet has left the scene the mighty angel never left that same one remember it wasn't the Prophet that brought the mighty angel it was the mighty angel that was already come on now the Prince of God was already here now we find that dissent in Revelations 10 but what is it to make know that same one is here to lead us and to direct us into every promise that has been given to us and ministered to us in this hour so he's right here he's to be in our flesh this is what we were talking about earlier that personal vindication of the life of Christ being inside of our life his presence in our lives as an individual it was not it's not a membership it's not being around something I hope everybody's hearing me even out there on the internet that's why I'm preaching to all of us here it's about a group membership well I go to believer spoken word Tabernacle let me tell you something if you're not under the blood of Jesus Christ in the meeting you've never been sealed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are under the wrath of Almighty God I don't care who you are I don't care who you related to you are under the judgment of Almighty God it's got to be personal personal vindication or glory this is personal vindication when you go to cash the check you don't have a family family family driver's license you got a personal ID when you go to have that ID made they don't ask can you have them okay we want to run in your family today we want to take a family picture no sir but you are part of a family but you've got to have your own personal identification this is where it's not a group it's a personal vindication of a pregnant out of God filled with the Holy Ghost well you're so surrendered and his life is pulsating through you this is where it takes to use that sword but I'm not I've overcome smoking there's a lot more thank God for it but there's a lot more than smoking Booth's and I overcome adultery is a lot more than just adultery thank God for that there's a light mom that goes over come let us a nice be a pothead thank God that you've overcome but there's a lot more I'm not just talking about a life well I used to you know I used to do this I don't do that no more I'm asking you the question is Christ alive in you remove saying I'll just be a cook for them we don't need a cook for the army we need people with swords in their hands they men the Holy Ghost provides every meal we've got need of and brother there's a whole supply wagon full of them hallelujah I want you to think of this Mordecai Mordecai here's what Haman is going to do he begins to weep the hearing they hear him in the rest of the Jews you know what Esther does Esther sins out verse four she sent Mordecai a change of raiment to take away his sell off but he received it not hallelujah you see this is why it's not the church telling him what to do he's the one leading the church Mordecai was a messenger personally to Esther and Esther would have been one to say hey man yo this disturbance you're causing in the kingdom here take this change of raiment but Mordecai says I will not be falsely comforted cappucci comfort she Oh Sian I will not be falsely comforted there's only one thing that can comfort the believer and that is the comforter himself the garment of the Holy Ghost of his word taken hold terrible God what if Monica had not stood this way this would read much differently but Monica said now I'll not receive a church garment Oh glory so her Chamberlain comes back and he begins to tell Esther what's going on this decree that Haman has made out of envy out of bitterness out of hatred for Mordecai he has appointed that there would be a destruction and everyone who had raised their hand to destroy the Jews there would be silver coming to their coughing I would say something but some of you might take it the wrong way Haman was trying to put out a stimulus bill don't go line and don't go lining things up you understand what I mean what is it people can be bought off with money come on friends though nations and the kingdoms of this world have been bought off with her riches that's why when her destruction cometh in an hour the Bible says they will wail and lament and mourn why she hath made us rich oh my but notice what is mentioned to Esther declared to her in verse 8 and charged her I'll just declare it but charge her you see what this word does it Commission's it Commission's that she should go in unto the King to make supplication unto him to make requests before him for her people you know what this word is doing it's calling her out of her comfort zone Esther has got comfortable being the queen she'd been hearing message after message of hope praise God I'm the queen oh praise God I'm the queen but you have not been anointed Queen just to be clean you are here for a purpose so now it changes to declare and charge her gone are the days of just coming and just rejoicing around God sent a message oh my in this wonderful in this wonderful this is a time to move and to act upon the word personally I believe that I believe listen to me believers forward Tabernacle I believe with all my heart it's one of these things right now but even as this has come and we've had to separate for a while your victory should B died to weather whooping Sedna I've been able to come to church for a month but Jesus had left you you ought to be just as victorious cuz it's not like you're being kept out of church but you can be just as victorious in the presence of Almighty God if it's anything less you've got a church experience and you need a real baptism of the Holy Ghost what are you doing I'm charging you repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ receive ye the Holy Ghost you see how personal vindication this is the Bible says for the rapture two will be in the same bed one will be taken the other will be left it brings it that close in the same house can be in the same bedroom put it in the same bed it's that close why because the Holy Ghost that's how real he is when he falls in a congregation he falls to deal with hearts so if he's dealing with your heart remember Jesus don't play games Jesus don't play games he comes to tap you on your shoulder he's letting you know he's letting you know he's talking to you you see the Holy Ghost he's not just something that comes out listen friends the Holy Ghost can fall in an assembly and people can look at anything wow wow that's wonderful did God be with in the yard no it was just wonderful my the music today mother this today you missed it it ought to bring genuine reflection in your life whoo I'm preaching I don't know anybody I want to come back to church now but I'm telling you it I'll bring genuine reflection in your life we do not come to the house of God just to feel good that is not what the outpouring of the Holy Ghost is about that you might feel good that is selfishness the Holy Ghost is to come to bring a reflection that our lives would be turned over to him just or take over more of Samuel take over more of my life that you might be reflected in my life I think of how I read just yesterday night when the Prophet said Lord as we have worshipped you in song he said now we come to worship you as the sword of the word will move through us and in us so here Esther she calls for a time of solidness fasting she tells Mordecai go gather the rest that had used together I want you to tell him to fast I want you to fast and me and my maids are going too fast too and on the third day we're gonna come we're gonna go in before him I'm gonna go in before him well glory be to God because you see he has told her listen to me now let me just back up just a moment here Mordecai listen to you just I want you to catch this here if I've got to stop somewhere in here that's fine I want you to catch this here this is how God deals with our lives she lets Mordechai know if I go in there and I've not been invited to come in we're talking about where the King sets on his royal throne if I go in there and I've not been summons to go in there he whoever goes in there is not summoned they die remember the sons of Aaron went in there with strange fire and they died is that right and God told Moses tell Aaron that he should not come at all times there's an appointed time and one time the veil was closed up but in Christ the veil has been rent in tow and the mercy seat is in plain view at one time it was death to go in but now it's death to stay out the message is telling her get into the hidden place get in there to the inner courts notice she's reasoning with her if I go in there he's not bidding me to come in there if I do that well what could happen to me Esther like many of us she still needs to be continually delivered of Esther so they told Mordecai looking at this dialogue it's going on so Mordecai this is what he tells her think not verse 13 that you're going to escape in the king's house I don't care Esther if you're sitting in the king's house you're sitting under a king's message preach with me now I don't care where you're setting up if you don't act right now you're ain't gonna be saved you understand what I'm saying it isn't just will please God I've been born into this thing and I've been around this thing you know what I think the doctrines are right that ain't and that ain't it that ain't it they're taught to debate these doctrines in seminaries but there's one thing that the devil can't debate and that's the life that's the life he can't debate that and here's what it tells her if you hold your peace if you don't speak the word you got to speak the word come on Esther you're full citizenship speak the ladder you see what is this message doing his telling Esther speak Esther as the first image was smitten and Michelangelo sent speak so is the word come in this hour when a bride she is the identified masterpiece of cloth we have been struck by the Spirit of God and it tells you an hour speak Esther speak Esther speak Esther what is it the sword of the Spirit speakest her speak Esther there holds your peace but mother but Esther go like this Esther yeah what what's that well that's part of surrender okay and go like this well what is that you feel oh well that's that's that that's the royal crown he put on my hand that's your confidence he has set his love on you when looking at yourself whether you're worthy or not well if I can do this but if I can do that Esther you're looking at the wrong thing see wonder what she was dealing with his fears she was dealing with fears what was the message of Mordecai doing casting out fear but how letting her know who she was he was casting out fear about letting her know of her election for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place oh you know what I love about this Mordecai is letting her know if you ain't going believe it God will raise up some stones to believe this if your ain't going to receive it I want you to slam this Esther I don't wanna hurt your feelings but if you ain't gonna rise up and stand in this time God will have somebody because God's made a promise of his word and God is not going to go back on his word God is going to fulfill his word he will fulfill it through believers what's he letting her know it's not about you it's God proving his word it's God fulfilling his word he just wants to borrow you you don't do it somebody else is I mean you say it to you if you don't take promises somebody else's if you don't take your place somebody else will take it but saying I thought nobody could take my place if your place is ordained in Jesus Christ I say in the name of Jesus Christ rise and take your inheritance [Applause] Alleluia and amen brother Sandra it's you and Jesus it's your inheritance Joshua is to divide the land the inheritance in the land you arise that's what this message come to do this message never come to make a social event a social club oh we have such a lovely church we have such a lovely that's not what this message can to do that is seeds of organizational ISM this message comes to brain a real genuine birth of the Holy Ghost it charges you take your position I don't know if it's for me the Bible says it is for all and as many as are far off as many as the Lord our God shall call my family brother Samuel don't hold your peace Esther my children don't hold your peace Esther my loved ones don't hold your peace speak the word remember your commission who know who knows whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this so here's where Esther comes said you are fast I'm gonna be fasting on the third day I'm going in let me read this scripture and I'm more close here verse 16 go gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan and fast II for me and neither eat nor drink three days nor night you see there's a cloud of many witnesses there's a gathering that's going on the rest of the shushing the rest in Shushan don't know what's going on this message does not have an effect upon the rest of Shushan but it's having an effect upon the Jews God for the bill is from the land of their nativity though they were their internship they were Jews they were citizens from another Kingdom glory be to God gather yourselves together and fast and pray for me no wonder Paul would open up every one of the letters Thessalonians Ephesians Philippians Colossians what would Paul open with within the first chapter and many of those prayer that you might be filled with all understanding and strengthened with his might it was an intercessory prayer according to the will of God I also in Don maidens will fast likewise and so will I go in unto the king which is not according to the law you see what she's doing grace is lifting her above the law she's now walking in disobedience she's going to come in humility but what has happened grace what's been minister to her grace grace grace shoutings of grace I wonder how many days brother Richard was she had to go but the Gomez I wonder how many times when she got down and prayed that she was praying she was she could feel that crowning of his love you see you and me we don't have a natural clown on our head but he has crowned our soul he has sealed us with the Spirit of God and how do we come we present our token when we come into his presence we present the token it's not a worthy nespresso because of my worthiness it's the token for the son what are you saying I'm saying damned and day out how do you stand and speak the word because you have the crowning seal upon your life he has set his love upon you you have been sealed unto the day of redemption nothing can break that seal Satan can come in please at it the Prophet said he can punch at it he said but you know you've passed from death unto life the things you once loved you love no more he said in this word is everything to you Jesus Christ is everything to you or a bit of God what is that the token life you see the outworking of this token life in Esther it's drawing Esther to think beyond herself say how close this is the thinking of herself it wasn't like she was thinking of well you know I'm better than somebody on this on that you know that can come along but it wasn't that her she was pulling her beyond the thoughts the thoughts of her humanity she could see her humanity she was held in this humanity but the word was causing her look beyond their first birth to the supernatural birth girl repeater God in the highest that's the rapture right there that's what takes the rapture she been lifted in Greece and this is her statement and if I perish I perish what is it she came to an end of Esther she came to an end of Esther where did the lamb prevail in Gethsemane he prevailed and he took the book is that right here is Esther what's happening her faith is increasing her faith is growing well huh brittleness how's it grown growing she's being reminded it's me see she continued once where's her shots or would it be to God her shots is in his sovereign action upon her life and here she stands if I perish I perish if we could see Esther now oh she's beautiful as the morning clear as the Sun witness of the fullness of the moon but terrible as an army with banners she's under the standard of the full Word of God I say this morning no matter where you're at and who you are let that be the desire and take the charge of the Spirit of God upon your life if I perish I perish what do you mean give it all give it all don't hold your peace but take your position take what rightfully belongs to you take the sword out of the sheath if it's not been given if you're looking for it you still have a right to stand upon that promise and take this charge and encouragement of the Spirit of God and say Lord I want that portion that belongs to me you have an authority by the Word of God it has charged you and I for our position it calls us beyond it calls us beyond being a part of a group it calls us from being associated with the message into being United with Christ who is the message what mercy let's pray Lord Jesus right here this morning Lord o God with these words that you've spoke to our hearts just beginning Lord to look at these things Lord and more and more Lord just seen how that our lives Lord it must be rooted and grounded in love Norden it's clear Paul would give us such direction having faith to move mountains it's not enough an individual person could have all great faith [Music] but it isn't Lord something of great faith as a matter of fact when you wrote of faith and one way you would you would speak and you would minister to that of the disciples and say oh ye of little faith but then you would Lord as you come right around and you'd let us know but that which moves mountains it begins with mustard seed faith faith that is the smallest of all faith that's what you said mustard seed it's the smallest of all herbs but it grows it will not mix with any other thing it won't highbreed it stays true Lord Jesus I pray this money right here Lord among the Assembly all of us together Lord connected Lord even by way of the Internet I pray Lord Jesus if there's one Lord that has not really experienced that of the love of God in their soul that Lord would lift them above all the things of the world maybe they've experienced a drawing a pool of the love of God may they continue to submit and surrender to you because Lord it must be the responding to your love or a yielding to you I ask Lord God that you would just continue to deal with that heart and that individual bring them Lord into that place to where like Esther was there willing to completely lay down their life or Jesus I pray this morning as we're gathered together here like Esther we are reminded of our humanity every day every moment the Lord your word it comes to lift us where our focus our dwelling our thoughts are not entertaining this humanity but where the word brings a discernment between our humanity and in between the real divinity of God on the inside Nord Jesus I pray this morning that you would help us help each and everyone that's listening or will listen to this Lord your dawn if they've got discouraged in their life for their walk if there's things that they're standing steal upon right now may I pray God by the Spirit of God may they Lord God receive a renewing by the Spirit of God Lord God where you will direct as it were their hands spiritually but they might be able with go God to move back into the place of the sacred sands of God's grace well Lord Jesus they met you face to face Lord to where they know within their hearts and their lives I have been changed maybe Lord God of taking a hold upon the love of God that's taken a hold upon their life may there be a renewing maybe they got a little cold Lord they drifted away from the fire of your love they've letting that love grown a little cold Lord like a husband and a wife can let that love grow cold [Music] embers sometimes embers are white-hot but if you're not careful they'll eventually it just starts cooling off what must I do keep putting on more wood keep receiving keep taking in of the love of God hallelujah keep taking in of that word you might say brother sandal I feel like I feel like I'm so cold you don't have to stay that way this morning you don't have to say that way this morning let's aim fire that lit your life up is present well once he's lit your soul you don't ever have to light it again there is no wind that can blow it out there's no trial that can take it away even in slothfulness it cannot be removed it's a sale of the Living God but from your heart this morning you would say Lord renew me renew my renew me Lord renew my vision I'll take the charge of the word the Lord God what might be clogging my mind or my eyes or God I'll accept that renew of the word Lord I've been holding my peace too long there's things I need to be speaking about [Music] or Jesus granite lord I pray Oh Papa right now in the name of Jesus Christ father I ask Lord gob had made the same warming race then Lord God that would come Lord father to bring these promises Lord God from word to flesh bring him real and alive Lord God is a living sword of the Living God that would go down Lord God and circumcise hearts and ears Lord God I ask Lord God that the same holy spirit Lord God that father Lord is anointing me and has anointed me in the service and these children of yours Lord I ask in the name of Jesus Christ according to their desire Lord God that that coldness Lord would be driven back from their life Lord God right now Lord God and they would experience Lord God that of the love of
