wonderful privilege to be in the house of the lord amen to be gathered together with saints of god of like precious faith and i tell you you know the reality is is we've we certainly have come to recognize even over the past year and a half that no matter where where you come from my goodness some of the things that perhaps that we took for granted just the just the time of being able to to come together and what a you know it's something when something like that takes place you you realize my goodness what a great value it is to be able to come together because right here tonight that throughout this assembly there's so there's different ones many that already have that that part of their inheritance that of the lick of fire dwelling in your heart and you've come to yield that lick of fire and and more where that's at there's more of the pillar of fire that's present amen and we just we we long to see just more and more of god in each of our lives and in for every life that's gathered around us there's needs we've come here tonight there's needs that we're aware of there's needs that you have in your life and there's needs that you have on your heart of maybe individuals that are not even here but god is mindful of every single need and you know just like when brother wayne was praying here tonight we've invited him into this meeting and you know when there's one thing about it when you invite him you want to welcome him and we want him just to take his liberty we want him to be god here amen we've not put him in a box and he has to act this way or he has to do this or he's only allowed to do this he comes and we want him to do everything that he's promised in his word and all he asked us to do is simply to believe amen that's the greatest compliment that we can give him amen i certainly believe it's just a wonderful atmosphere for the holy spirit just to move on in in his word amen so i want to say thank you to each and every one that my goodness there's different ministers that's here you know and i think brother jim and some of the saints from there and we just appreciate you brother jim and then your wife and different ones brother randy and sister alice and different ones you know brother wayne and sister karissa and if i've missed anybody else and you're a ministry it's not that you're not important i just forgive me i just don't oh brother jonathan my goodness god bless you amen so brother jonathan martin we just we just so appreciate having each and every one of you and just coming here amen amen you know we we have a we have a family that's visiting here from uh they've come up to this meeting and and um they actually bear the last name of this particular place where our church is at sheffield brother and sister sheffield we just certainly appreciate having you all and amen the different ones that's come with you and we just want to pull on the gift of god tonight amen god is mindful he knows what our needs before the foundation of the world god knew that this meeting would be here tonight even before you ever made plans to be here god already knew you would be here and because you were here that's why he accepted the invitation to come so we're just looking to him and we want to draw amen from him tonight el shaddai whatever your need is god is greater than your need he's got every part of it covered tonight i believe right now i've asked the lord i've told different ones i said i'm expecting big things because we serve a mighty god he told us to ask for big things i'm asking that god fill every heart with the holy ghost i'm asking that god healed every sick person i'm asking that god free all that are bound and i'm asking god we'll refill each and every one of us amen i'm asking god for those things how many stand with me on that amen say lord jesus doward welcome lord amen let's just if we could we just want to invite amen brother andrew and we appreciate brother andrew and sister mariah i appreciate that they would come and be with us here in this service and we just want to make make our brother welcome and most importantly we want the holy spirit to be welcome here to speak to our hearts amen so let's just if we could once again i don't mean to have you stand up and down but give you a chance to stretch your legs amen so let's just let's turn our attention to the word and let's sing that little song he touched me i was shackled by a heavy burden amen [Music] i was shackled [Music] [Applause] why of was and shame but in the hand of jesus touch me and now thank you lord no longer the same he touched me [Music] oh he touched me oh the joy that floods my soul for something oh has happened wonderful and now i know he touched me let's testify now ever since ever since i met this said savior hallelujah and ever since he cleansed and made [Music] made me whole and i shall never [Music] cease [Music] he touched me he touched me oh he touched me [Music] the joy that floods my soul yes all some things happen and now i know he touched me and made me whole since i sing that second verse again oh since i met this plan anybody met him here tonight oh and since he cleansed and made me whole oh yes shall never cease to praise him hallelujah i'll shall it while he turning oh yes glory more time now oh he touched me [Music] the joy that floods my soul is all oh something happened and now i know he touched me and made me whole amen is there any witnesses here tonight that's been touched by the hand of the lord amen there's one thing about it if he ever touches you you won't have to hope anymore you won't have to guess you won't be thinking possibly somebody touched you but if he ever touches you you'll know you've been touched amen it's not a temporary touch it's an eternal touch amen when he touches the heart of a sinner it makes it a saint makes it a believer a holy ghost filled individual when he touches a sick person he makes him well touches a bound person sets them free and i believe that same god is here in this building this weekend let's just buy our hearts together and humble our spirits and his presence tonight let's just ask him to come and you know the needs of your life the situations as we enter these meetings this weekend just ask the lord to come by in a special way and touch your heart heavenly father lord as your believers have gathered here lord on this friday afternoon lord when the world is going about their lord daily routines doing their things father lord been preparing all week lord for this when they could lord go partake of the world and ungodliness and unrighteousness the lord here stands a group of believers it's been preparing lord been praying been seeking your will and your mind lord and preparing their hearts for these meetings now lord i am a firm believer that you don't call a group of people together lord without having something for him lord and there's there's nothing that i as a man can offer this group of people tonight but lord i believe that you're still the same yesterday today and forever and i believe that you're here to offer healing you're healed are here to offer answers to questions deliverances to lives lord i pray tonight as we come together in one mind and one accord i pray that you would drive out every spirit that would be unlike the holy spirit lord every demon that would try to hinder these meetings in any way father may you drive it out of the building lord lord we just want to say thank you for this opportunity and privilege you've given us lord after we come through the year like we come through last year and how lord meetings lord and things are canceled lord and a father just to have this opportunity together with believers of like precious faith lord our hearts are over joy tonight god now as we endeavor to look into your word may you come in a special way may you help me to get myself out of the way lord may you help the hearer to get their self out of the way as well or that you could come take preeminence among us lord father and whatever is accomplished here in these meetings we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for to the wonderful name of her lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believers said amen amen god bless you this evening i mean if you have your bibles while you're standing with us we'll invite you to the book of proverbs the fourth chapter the book proverbs the fourth chapter and we want to look here in the 23rd verse and while you're turning there we want to greet you this evening in the name of the lord jesus christ we sure counted an honor privilege to be here with you all once again and good to see everyone out in the house of god tonight all the visiting all the visiting ministers we say god bless you all and appreciate brother samuel the invitation to come we're just under expectation of the lord this weekend amen we believe that when believers get together that something good is bound to happen amen and i believe something good is going to happen here this weekend amen the book of proverbs the fourth chapter and the 23rd verse and something has changed up here i've it's it's gotten muffled i'm losing everything in my ear so if you can turn that up i'd appreciate it perfect proverbs 4 and verse 23 keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life that heart's a very important thing isn't it keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life and put away from thee a forward mouth and perverse lips put power put far from thee let thine eyes look right on and let thine eyelids look straight before thee ponder the path of thy feet and let all the ways be established turn not to the right hand nor to the left remove thy foot from evil i also want to look in the book of john the seventh chapter there solomon is writing about the heart and he says out of the heart floweth the issues of life and you look here in john the seventh chapter and just one verse i want to read here this evening john the seventh chapter and i want to look here in the 38th verse maybe we could just begin with the 37th verse i know this is a very very familiar scripture speaking about christ being the water of life and it said in the last day that great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water we ask the lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you may have your seats here this afternoon for just a few moments from those scriptures tonight if i could take just a few minutes of your time to speak to here on something that's up on my heart just to open these meetings up with tonight i want to speak to you for a few moments on unclogging the channels unclogging the channels and i realize we're living in the time right now we we know we have four seasons of the year we have fall winter spring and summer and we're living in a time right now that we could call spring and it's a time where people call it spring cleaning or getting rid of things or making room for more i know some people call it purging out their closets purging out garages purging out sheds all kinds of things you can call it and i believe that what is happening in the natural is only a sign of something that would be happening in the spiritual i believe if the world is cleaning out things getting ready for more stuff to come in of the natural then i believe the church of the living god is making room for more of the things of god amen to come into their lives and and you look in the book of psalms 19 verse 12 just lay a foundation here david said who can understand his heirs cleanse thou me from secret faults he says in psalms 51 verse 2 wash me thoroughly from my iniquities and cleanse me from my sin verse 5 behold i was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me in verse 7 he says purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean wash me and i shall be whiter than snow he comes along in psalm 79 and verse 9 and says help us o god of our salvation for the glory of thy name and deliver us and purge away our sins for thy name's sake how many could just say tonight lord i want to be purged amen i i want to i want to purge you know i don't want to leave here the way i came i don't want to leave with the same thoughts or the same maybe the same ideas or the same directions i want to leave here changed amen i want to leave here purge now we begin to talk about purging and how can you not talk about purging but think about the word purgatory and the prophet of god said this in the way of a true prophet he said i do believe in a purgatory he said but i believe it's right now he said you purge your own soul he said purgatory means to purge so when you see that you've done something wrong he said get out there and clean it out of you by confession and crying and fasting and praying he said someone even laughed at me when the lord came here not long ago and give me a vision i always wanted to see about binding that serpent i always wondered how to i should step out like that when that's what i've wanted all my life then i began to fast and pray and said what you do that for and i said in there he said i was not sincere enough after he came then i wanted to purge myself not wait till you die and let some priest try to purge you but purge your soul see but see they took it out of the authoritative word put it over in the hands of some man-made dogma to bring money into the church because they took out the look at the worldly things in the worldly church great powers in the world political powers amen but god looks at his word amen so we're not here tonight amen to purge ourselves by the ideas of a man or by the traditions of denomination amen or the creeds of religion we are here amen to purge ourselves by the word of god in any word amen that's contrary to god's word is wrong as far as i'm concerned it's the word or nothing yes sir as far as i'm concerned it's the word or nothing he said yes sir now when brother branham preaches the message you know he'll actually preach a message on doors and he clearly identifies he meant that there are many doors in the heart of the human being that god himself wants to gain entrance to there is the door of pride there is the door the private life there is the door of faith there's all kinds of doors he meant in the door of the heart so rem calls it door to the heart or doors in a door he meant and he's showing you that god is wanting to get in there and he's wanting to make room for himself there there's possibly something in those compartments he mentor in those areas of your heart that is occupying he meant a place that god desired for himself to dwell now in proverbs 4 solomon instructs us amen to keep thy heart with all diligence in the message the word became flesh india report he said listen my christian friend if there is any alt in your heart against anyone amen go to them now and be reconciled forget all the past and if you've been having up and down life remember something amen has come into that heart something has moved into those thoughts no matter who your enemy is love him amen love him no matter what's happened let it go amen after all you're in a field with weeds we realize that but we must both grow together we've got to come up together for a good whale amen cannot put forth evil waters and neither can an evil whale amen put forth good waters a tree cannot bring forth corrupt fruit and good fruit at the same time he said so let's either make the whole well clean or let's make the whole well dirty one or the other see amen for it's dirty to begin with so let's clean it out amen the whales and say lord pour in your spirit amen and lead me o god lead me so the prophet is saying amen that a whale could not put forth dirty water he meant in clean water a tree could not put forth corrupt fruit he meant an incorruptible fruit and therefore he meant a church cannot put forth a good spirit and a bad spirit it's either putting forth a good spirit amen or it's putting forth a bad spirit now there's got to be an origin amen where those spirits are coming from and when you get a church and then there's full of ideas and full of traditions and full of religion and full of all kinds of things it will put forth he meant a dirty whale it'll put forth a whale that there's no power to wash the center there's no power to clean up the unbeliever there's no power to set the captive free amen but what about it tonight on the first night of this meeting why don't we amen let the holy ghost clean out the well amen let the holy ghost clean out the church let the holy ghost clean out the young people listen amen i'll tell you what we need is a good old-fashioned nester and amen to where everything that we've been bogged down with is gone amen when the wind of god begins to blow do you realize when the wind blows amen things are laying down if they are not bolted and anchored it's going to blow away with it amen look outside the wind's blowing a lot today right amen and i say tonight amen if you've anchored down a bitterness if you've anchored down an unforgiving spirit amen if you bolt it down some old thing that the devil's holding over you why don't right now amen you let the holy ghost unbolt that thing and let the wind of the holy ghost come blow him through this church until it blows out everything that's unlike god and makes room for more of god amen a hybrid well amen is a well that is mixed with clean and dirty water hey amen the bible says in james 3 for every kind of beast and a birds and of serpents and of things in the sea is tamed has been tamed to mankind amen but the tongue can no maintain it is an unruly evil full of daily poison amen therewith we bless god even the father and therewith curse we man which are made after the similitude of god he said out of the same mouth proceeded blessing and cursing brethren these things ought not so to be amen these things ought not so to be amen do if a fountain sent forth at the same place amen sweet and bitter water amen can the fig tree you brethren brethren bear all that berries either a vine fig so can no fountain amen both fields salt water and fresh amen so what we need tonight is not a halfway conversion amen to where we're trying to live for god and live for the world and speak the things of god and speak the things of the devil amen but we need a conversion to come into our souls he meant to where what we speak is not positive one day he meant and naked to the next now i'm going to take the breaks off here and preach for a second amen because what we need is people with convictions amen amen we need preachers with convictions we we need young people with convictions we need we need housewives with conviction we need young men amen with conviction we need somebody amen that believes what they believe and they're not ashamed of what they believe listen we've got preachers and they'll get around certain people and they'll quote the prophet and get around others and you don't even know they believe in a prophet amen they'll get around some people and say brother branham's message is the truth and get around that amen i say the days of wishy washy our lives amen if you're gonna be a message preacher get a backbone and preach what the prophet said amen if you're gonna be a message believer amen get a backbone and preach what the prophet said and believe what the prophet said what are you saying i'm saying out of the church of the living god cannot flow the ideas of this message and the ideas of pentecostalism outside of this word there is no anointing there is no inspiration amen therefore church why don't tonight we clean everything out of the church that is not in the message clean everything out of the church that was not taught by a prophet listen you're looking at one preacher that don't care what your grandma said i don't care what your baptist pastor said i care about what a prophet said and if a prophet said it there ought to be some people that's got to cut amen to believe it and to preach it listen this is not a baptist church this is not a denominational church this is a house of worship this is a house of god where he desires amen that his spirit would flow through the church hey the days of trying to be identified with one thing one group and identify with another them days are long gone church amen you gotta believe this message amen there is no rapture you got to believe this message or there is no anointing hey now don't don't start bumping me amen let me preach here for a second you've got to believe what the prophet said or your church will be as powerless as 900 denominations amen but thank god for this message amen thank god for this prophet that we're not sitting on the fence tonight amen wondering what to believe and wonder where to go we have been purged amen by the word of almighty god and it's not bitter water here it's not corruptible fruit here it's not figs one day and buries the next it's the saith the lord that is flowing through the church [Applause] to think tonight that we have seen the results of the life of somebody that said they serve god one day and believe the message one day and then serve the devil the next day and believe the devils lie the next day the problem of god picks this up in jehoshaphat and says all that together making it under consideration he said jehoshaphat had purposed in his heart he meant to serve the lord and declined to the things that his father david did he meant at the beginning and the prophet said i like that he meant at the beginning let's say that together at the beginning amen at the beginning see in other words he went back to the old landmark and they clean out all the roles it would be good for pentecost they meant to go back to the old landmark it would be good for all of us to go back to the old landmark and clean out the rose he said i'm talking supposedly to mostly pentecostal here this afternoon what would happen if actually this church went back to the old landmark he said you talk about it cleaning up amen there'd be one around here it sure would he said you would be acting different you would be dressing different you would be talking different it'd just be all together a different church if we went back and then to the old landmark where amen we started from amen so the devil wants to put something between you amen in the old landmark amen because if you lose sight of the old landmark amen you'll lose sight of your future you'll lose sight of your conviction you'll lose sight of your hope amen but if you keep the road clean amen between you and the old landmark amen that no matter what you go through amen you can always look back of the old landmark and say there is where it happened amen and i wonder tonight is there anybody here says i know i've got a landmark amen i know i've got somewhere amen that the pillar of fire amen came down into my soul and i drove the stake down amen i know i've got a landmark but there's been some things amen that's got between me and the landmark amendment i believe the holy ghost amen is sending a stick of holy ghost dynamite he met into these meetings this weekend he meant to clean out everything that is between you and the old landmark which is the word now when you begin to think about channels amen you'll find that there are many channels in the body of christ amen that he himself placed there amen that he himself wants to flow through when you look at what a channel means it is a prepared route somebody say a prepared route it is a prepared route amen for something to pass through into something else it is something that has been prepared he meant for something to pass through into something else amen so god works through channels and god prepares the channel and the devil does everything he can he meant to clog up the channel amen god prepares the channel and the devil does everything he can a meant to clog up the channel now when a channel becomes clogged up it actually means it's blocked amen so that little or nothing amen can pass through to unclog something means you've got to remove all the accumulated matter that is built up in that channel amen i believe another word for unclocking amen is revival amen i believe another word amen for unclogging the channels meant he was reviving the channels amen i believe a revival a minister washed out all the unbelief amen washed out all the sin amen and let the people come out amen and see that god is still god and his word is still true and his power is still here and his anointing is still upon the church and the message is still thus saith the lord and the message is still the absolute amen outside of it we are a confused group of people amen but with it tonight amen there's nothing the devil can send in the church amen it'll cut the flow off listen he may send something in amen but if there's an anointing there it'll pick that thing up and blow it to kingdom come now how many says lord clean out the channels amen amen lord clean out the channels amen let me see that god is still god the bible says amen that i am the lord and i change amen not amen therefore ye sons of jacob are not consumed now when you begin to look at channels you've got to realize the channel of god is always open amen the channel of god is always open but god's channel is never caught amen the channel of god is always open he said remember church god's words are true i believe the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of god amen will bring it to pass if you can look at it in the right way but remember here's been my standard in life he says i have tried amen to do this what have you tried to do brother branham the first thing i want to find out whether it's the will of god or not then i know it's god's will then the next thing is my objective to it and my motive in doing it then if it's the will of god and my objective is right and my motive is right i have faith that it will be done because first it is the will of god and my objective is to glorify him and my motive is to give him all the glory see there's no selfish motives about it you have a selfish motive it won't work he said if your objective is to make money for yourself or something you'll never succeed he said so there is genuine faith but you must come into the right channel the real channel of god to have the genuine faith there's human faith amen then there's the faith of god let's let's separate that there's human faith then there is the faith of god and you must have a godly faith to believe now then to have godly faith you must have the mind of christ in you see then that's how god projects to you amen visions and revelation and all these things comes amen by the mind of christ being in you see then that opens another channel to say where is the mind of christ is the mind of christ in heaven is the mind of christ in a grave in jeffersonville is the mind of christ stuck out in the mountains of arizona amen the prophet said amen we have the mind of christ now you will never find the channel of god without the mind of god without the mind of god you'll never find the channel of god that's why paul would say for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have let's say this together we have the mind of christ amen we're not looking for it we're not trying to find it amen we have the mind of christ amen here is the secret of this amen the word is in the pride as it was in mary amen the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what he wants done with his word amen she performs the command of his word in his name amen for she has thus saith the lord amen aren't you aren't you thankful to know tonight we're not looking for thus saith the lord and we didn't just have thus saith the lord and we're not just going to have the saith the lord but right here brother jim tonight in the house of god we have the saith the lord you say well you're not a prophet and i don't see brother branham here but this message amen is thus saith the lord if the prophet said there is one god we say amen because that was thus saith the lord if the prophet said you were born amen a gene seed of almighty god we don't question it we don't back up on it we say amen to it because that's thus saith the lord if the prophet said the seventh seal is open we don't back up on it we don't bury our heads in the sand like a bunch of ducks without a direction to go we stand here and say we've got the safer come on church the devil's been pushing and the devil's been pushing and the devil's been pushing but it's time somebody ain't then rise up and start pushing back and then we're not a bunch of hybrid christians here trying to mix some concoction together to bring a revival in the church we have got to saith the lord tonight we have got the word of the lord in the church and the mind of christ is here to fulfill the will of god listen church we're not looking for direction we've got direction we're not looking for revelation we've got revelation we're not and he said with andrew we want more yes we do but we don't want any revelation outside of what a prophet has said now ah the devil don't like that but he ought to know by now i really don't care we have clogged the channels long enough with man's ideas we have clogged the channels long enough with brother adam told brothers soul and soul and sister so and so 50 years ago amen we've clogged the channels long enough you realize we got people sitting in message churches that's afraid to read message books because of some false doctrine that's been taught we got young people afraid ain't meant to turn a tape hey i'm gonna preach right through it tonight amen we got young people afraid to turn a tape on amen because they're afraid they'll be confused listen you'll be confused without a prophet amen but when you hear a prophet it'll move you from being confused into being anointed and revelated with a vision before you now we're not here tonight trying to find the mind of god we've got it we all agree we've got it tonight amen we are not here like cain and abel who in genesis 4 amen was trying to find the channel of god the bible said by faith abel amen offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice amen than cain by which he obtained what witness that he was righteous amen god testifying of his gifts and by it being dead amen yet speaketh now watch this the prophet said cain was just as religious as abel was both made altars both loved god both made sacrifices both worshipped they both paid tithes they both done everything just alike he said but able by faith which is what is the revelation he meant the word of god revealed made plain showed out and vindicated brother brown even got happy brother samuel and said glory amen cain made an offering but god didn't vindicate it amen god required worship amen but by the true channel think about this prophet said by the true channel you say well my church is it he said wait a minute god interprets his own word by its terms that he spoke him he said cain said i am religious i am a lover of my maker i offer thee this fine altar i offer to you this sacrifice i built all these things up for because i love you and abel the same thing amen watch us now it's the one that's vindicated it's the one that's proven and god come down and received abel's sacrifice because by revelation he had struck amen the true channel of god that was accepted they've been both boys doing the same thing amen but there was a big difference here there was a seed difference amen cain was of that wicked one amen abel was not of the wicked one hey are you in the church amen therefore cain was probing and pulling and picking trying to find he'd been the channel of god amen but able by revelation amen that tapped in to that true channel and i'll say this the message of the hour amen has reopened amen the true channel of revelation to the church amen that had been clogged up with theology and man-made theories and seminary ideas had clogged up the revelation in the church so where people didn't even believe in prophets they didn't even believe in divine healing they didn't even believe in the manifestation of the gifts they didn't even believe that god amen can still anoint a man and speak to that man and squirrels come into existence amen but god said in the last days help me church amen i will open up the channel again i will open up the channel that i can flow into the church listen this message didn't come amen for a personality amen to flow in the church this message didn't come amen for a preacher's idea amen to foe in this church this message is a channel amen that is prepared from the almighty god that has been prepared for his spirit amen to flow back in the church oh somebody shout thank you lord for opening up the channel amen thank you lord amen for sending a prophet with the backbone to stand there and say there is no such thing as three gods there is no such thing amen is putting your name on a church roll and being a part of pride there is no such thing as putting your name on a church card the only way these things come is by a birth of the holy ghost coming in the soul oh thank god amen for opening up the channel and then god opened up the channel of this prophetic gift in this generation how did he do it brother samuel by the fulfillment and the interpretation of the word the prophet said we please we placed me he said he placed me in this channel of this prophetic gift whatever it might be he said i don't know but it being some prophetic gift where he opens up to me i try to glorify our heavenly father wherever i can help his people that's what i do so the prophet come he meant not to hurt the people amen but to help the people he didn't come to hurt the church and then he come to help the church well is this all right amen god sent he meant that prophetic gift to who he didn't send it to the world he didn't send it to denomination he sent it to the bride of christ you know why he sent you a prophetic gift even because you had a prophetic womb amen that was going to bring forth prophetic promises amen you are a prophetic bride who received a prophetic gift because you had a prophetic womb amen to bring forth prophetic promises listen you may have a lot of troubles and you may have a lot of disappointments and you may have a lot of things going on in your life but you got something tonight and then it ought to make you shout your sea heels huh you've got a prophetic room ain't meant to receive amen a prophetic promise in this last day you say what kind of promise is it here it is amen we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed amen that is not a natural promise and it's not a man's promise amen that is a prophetic promise coming to a prophetic class of people oh when we recognize amen the time and hour we're living in amen it ought to put a child in the church in ought to put an amen hey let me just preach her for a second amen if you are a message believer here tonight every time a quote is mentioned there ought to be an amen on your lips if you are a message preacher here tonight every time something is preached about this message there ought to be a hallelujah in your heart if you are a young person here that believes this message there ought to be a joy they've been bubbling up on the inside of you come on church i'm gonna preach here for a second i'm sick and tired amen i'm sitting around letting the devil clog the channels up amen we ought to stand up and let the devil know we are not ashamed amen of the holy ghost we are not ashamed of the power of god we are not ashamed of the anointing of the holy ghost we are not ashamed amen that god sent a message in this generation to open up our womb amen to receive this prophetic promise that we would be alive and remain and bring forth oh you've been ordained amen to bring forth christ this is the hour this message didn't come to move the church into a corner and to be ashamed and to be embarrassed this message come to move the church into action somebody shout action amen move the church into action listen do you realize the bible said amen but now he has obtained hey when somebody give me hebrews 8 in verse 6 amen i want you to look at this under this message it has opened up the channels amen of god it has brought back the spirit of revelation it is revealed amen who you are god it is revealed what you are it revealed who you'll be it revealed where you come from it revealed where you're at it revealed where you're going it revealed what you've done it revealed what got you in the condition you was in it revealed what would take to get you out of the condition you was in oh i feel like preaching here for a second amen let me set the way out best way i can this message is perfect this message is perfect it's prophet's message amen it's not flawed it's not full of your interpretation well the bride needs me to make sense of this if the prophet said it he didn't expect somebody to raise up and correct it he expected it to open amen of power in the church come on friends amen i know people get all wadded up and tore up if you say third pull and seventh seal in the opening of the word amen but those are not cliches and then those are sticks of dynamite they meant to open up a power in the church of the living god amen that the same melchizedek that appeared to abraham amen could appear in the church in the last days oh what's wrong with them people on their feet they've recognized their day they've recognized their message brother jim they recognize they're not under anointing of a man they're under a prophetic anointing now look here amen but now he has obtained a more excellent ministry i can't even read my notes for preaching a more excellent ministry amen by how much also he is the mediator what's that say of a better covenant which was established up on better promises are y'all here i'm not reading about a day coming i'm not reading about a day gone by i'm reading about your day amen you have obtained a more excellent ministry amen you were under amen the mediator of the better covenant and you are established upon better promises hell brother andrew i don't know about that the prophet said miriam and them looking back saul that separation can you leave that there for me and it annihilated from their enemies forever how long was they going to be safe from them he said these egyptians that you see today you'll see no more forever amen these egyptians brother that you see today amen let's just preach a minute brother amen these egyptians you see today you'll see them no more forever [Applause] are y'all hear me and when miriam heard that amen she heard that they were put in the sea of forgetfulness we'll remember them no more are you ready for this ain't anybody been carrying something let me say this has the devil been carrying something over you that you really want to get rid of is there something been clogging up your fellowship with the lord has there something been clogging up your vision of your future well let me tell you what a prophet said he said what kind of a god do we have he don't go and dig it up again and hold it against you he said i forget about it that shouting point right there he said i forget about it amen i forgot about it amen that thing that clogged up the channel of worship he said it's gone i forgot about it i'm not going to dig it up and put it before you again when god puts it in the sea of forgetfulness it's gone annihilated forever are you all ready for this are you ready for this he said oh my no wonder miriam had a hot spell well i think we're going to have some hot spells around here this weekend i think we're going to have some old-fashioned amen holy ghost hot spells now i know when you get to preach about shouting and you get to preach about the holy ghost moving in the church i mean you get all kinds of arrivals out of people amen brother samuel i've actually realized we don't realize it amen but we've got some professional flesh detectors around our message they are professional flesh detectors when the spirit of god comes in the church they fold their arms and they can tell you who's in the spirit and who's not they can tell you who's got it on the right way and who don't they can tell you who should be dancing and who shouldn't they can tell you who should be speaking in tongues and who shouldn't they can tell you what's of god and what's not amen can i ask you something how in the world would you know what is of the spirit of god or not when you ain't ever even been in the spirit of god what right do you have he meant to tell a young boy he ain't got a right to dance what oh don't let's preach a minute amen what right do you have amen to tell a young girl that's been bound by a complex and the spirit of god set her free that she ain't got a right to praise god i'll tell you what you got on you you got a devil on you and you need to get it cast off and let the liberty of the holy ghost not only come in the church but come in your life flesh detectives well that was in the spirit and that was in the flesh and that was oh you would have been there on the days and told miriam she's probably in the flesh too but you know what she had done what i'm getting ready to tell you i don't care she picked up a tambourine and she began to jump and dance up and down the bank he said why because the holy spirit amen likes to catch he meant from one to another like an atom in a relay race it began to jump from one to another and they all got tambourines brother jim they all got tambourines and just had a real jubilee he said if that ain't the holy ghost i don't know what it is there they were singing in the spirit amen dancing in the spirit beating all the music and clapping their hands what a time they was having he said why they was annihilated from their enemy they was annihilated from their enemy now can i tell you what they were doing that under an old covenant got to quote right here in front of me they miriam was dancing amen brother under an old covenant brother vernon miriam had a hot spell under an old covenant amen the prophet said he still does the same thing under a new covenant he said way better than the old covenants well if they were shouting under the old covenant and they were dancing on the old covenant don't you thank the church of the living god tonight has got a right he meant to shout under a new mediator under a better ministry established upon better promises yes sir i'm talking about the god he said i forgive all thy iniquities and i heal all thy diseases hey i forgive all that iniquities i heal all thy diseases do you realize in the old testament they had one prescription under the old covenant i am the lord that healeth all thy diseases but today the prophet said today we have some 600 or better promises on divine healing alone if miriam could shout on one promise then don't you think we got a right to shout on 600. if he did it under the old covenant then how much greater is the covenant today he said if he did it under the top what will he do under the anotype he said see you know what i began to believe christian friend that we're just living in the beginning of the greatest time that the world has ever witnessed are you ready for this somebody say i'm ready preacher i'm ready i just believe that all of the lines are getting unclogged you know clogged up with all kinds of doctrines and theologies and all kinds of unbelief that's been handed down amen from generation amen to generation now amen they get bumpy here but put your seat belt on we'll get through it amen there's more than just there's more than just sin and ungodliness amen that clogs up the generations that clogs up the channels amen do you realize if you pass down amen can i take some liberty here if you pass down the idea amen to your children and your grandchildren that this message is another idea on the shelf and brother bannon was a prophet but there were certain areas you couldn't preach and there were certain things you couldn't say i tell you what you ought to be you ought to be ashamed of yourself amen because you've just passed down something that'll clog up the channels amen of their minds and of their spirits but i say tonight is there any new generation here that says the old fighters are dying off amen but we're a part of the generation that's going to take the land is there anybody going to take the land listen is there anybody they'll say amen you know people say precious spirits are passed down from generation to generation and somewhere it's got to stop amen somewhere it's going to be broken somewhere it's going to end do you realize the same day of hope amen passes down unbelief about this message from generation to generation to where if you've got an old man saying that it was brother brown's opinion about a boy wearing shorts you'll have a young man saying the same thing if you've got an old man saying it was brother brown's opinion about the word you'll have a young man saying the same thing amen but god is looking for the seed of abraham who will separate themselves from all five senses and will let the holy ghost amen awaken the supersense and say lord there's things i don't understand there's things i can't make sense of amen but i am a believer i'm a part of this new generation if the prophet said it i believe it that settles it and i get a witness here that says if the prophet said it amen i believe it and that settles it down brother jonathan if a prophet taught it we believe it that settles it [Applause] [Music] well you slept with andrew i don't i don't agree with that well the prophet said here's what they say they say there's no such a thing as divine healing and the days of miracles just pass he said and we just automatically believe that because it come down from a former generation god don't heal the days and miracles has passed and we automatically believe that i read something the other day about shouting my shoehills off it said the demon of alcoholism he then ran in my family until it ran into me now that right there's a good point amen the demon ran in my family until it ran into me amen you know what the prophet said he said the devil ran into moses he ran into david he ran into all of them until he ran into christ and he hit 150 volt wire and he said he got sins real good because everything that was in god he poured into christ and everything that was in christ amen he poured in the church what are you saying brother andrew i'm saying you ain't got to live under generational curses you ain't got to live under besetting sins you ain't got to carry habits that family members have carried for years there is an anointing in the message of the hour he meant to break the sin curse to break the strongholds of addiction they meant to make a man a man to make a woman a woman to make a boy a boy there is a power in this message to unclog the channels and let the flow of the supernatural god come in the church until it blows out every cobweb it blows out every superstition it blows out every skepticism and christ christ comes flowing in the church yes sir it's come to a place where god not man there's a key point we're god not man we'd still be back there in the old formal way if it had not been for god then do you realize what the channel of this message has done it is fulfilled john 14 it is fulfilled john 16 where he said i will send the spirit of truth unto you do you realize the spirit of truth has returned in this age to let the church i feel like preaching brother justin to let the church know you are no longer subject amen to believe the devil's life are y'all hear me tonight you are no longer subject amen to believe the devil's lie you believed his lie long enough how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will lead you he will guide you into all truth he will not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come the prophecy we got what we call a lie detector you see what this message is brother it's a lie detector amen you put it on your wrist you set it across your head you can get in there and try your best to make a lie sound like the truth it'll register negative every time because a human was not made to lie listen brother jim if a human was not made to lie then i can say this with assurance that a human was not made to believe a lie either [Music] oh preach brother andrew think i believe i will amen a human was not made amen to lie and he was not made to believe a lie either do you realize what we do we believe a devil's lie over god's truth i've seen a prayer line the other day brother samuel and a young man come in the prayer line and he said the devil told me i'm always going to be depressed he said i'm always going to be like this i'm never going to get free i'm never going to get victory he said i always have this anxiety i'll always have this nervousness he took brother wayne about five minutes he been to tell me everything the devil told him brother michael before i could catch myself i said young man do you realize what you just did he said what i said you just spent five minutes repeating to me everything a liar told you you just spent five minutes repeating everything a liar the devil is let's say this together the devil is alive and that the devil is a liar he was a liar from the beginning he's a liar here tonight he'll be a liar in the end time the devil is a liar that whatever he tells you the holy ghost says you are not subject to belief now come on church he tells you you're always going to be like that but let me tell you what the word said the word said and i saw them that had gotten the victory over the mark of the beast over the number of his name are y'all hear me amen let's say what the spirit of truth said the devil said you'll always be sad but the word said you can have joy unspeakable and full of glory the devil said you'll always be weak but the word said i'll give you power the devil said you'll always be nervous but the word said i'll give you the spirit of love and of power and of a sound mind oh come on church we are not subject tonight any longer to what the devil says what the devil thinks we are the sons and daughters of god that is received amen the spirit of truth the mighty shout thank you lord for the spirit of truth where the spirit of truth comes amen now there's one thing the devil loves to do there's one of his favorite channels that he loves to clog up it's the channel of inspiration the devil loves to clog up the channel of inspiration because he knows if a church loses the inspiration it won't be long and they'll be expiration if a church the devil didn't like that but i really don't care if the devil can get you to believe this message is not inspired it's only a matter of time before your young people are swept out in the world if the devil can get you to believe that the holy ghost amen is not still with the church then it will be a matter of time till the church will turn into more than a place of change it will turn into a place of cycle continuation are y'all hear me amen but i believe the bible says that there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the almighty giveth them understanding now when the prophet preaches this message i have heard but now i see he actually takes time to go back and refer to the previous message called trying to do god a service without it being his will he said there was david just aspired as he could be all the people shouting glorifying god he meant that he was the wrong person he said the inspiration should have come to nathan now watch this he said but they never consulted nathan he said in job's day job was the prophet of his day he said the only thing god had done to job was give him wisdom and the word and inspiration but he could get no inspiration but he knowed all of his mechanics he had offered the burnt offering he had done everything he knew to do was right but he couldn't get a word from the lord but the devil couldn't move him the devil couldn't move him there you are see when you know you've done exactly what god told you to do see he said then wait for the channel of inspiration to open up to you and now i'm healed watch how he turns that so quick he said when you know you've done all that you could do the word is revealed to your heart he said then wait for the channel of inspiration to open up and then you'll say now i'm healed when it drops in there it's all over see he said you don't need no prayer lines or nothing else it's over brother michael it's revealed it's been revealed to you oh glory if you are sick tonight and the preacher is preaching healing and you're hearing the promises and you're hearing the promises but nothing is anchored amen you know what you need you need a prayer line you need an altar call but when the word strikes the seed inside of your soul opens up the channel and the same inspiration that is dropping on the preacher drops inside of your soul then you'll scream out now i am healed it's all over oh i believe i'm going to decree and i'm going to declare this weekend is a weekend some things are going to be over help me now i declare depression is over i declare suicidal spirit is over i declare anxiety is over i declare nervousness is over i declare cancer is over i declare bit backbiting infested and i declare it's over tonight by the word of the lord that's inspired by the spirit of truth oh somebody shout it's over it's over he said now when it's revealed to you yourself has received god's promise the inspiration you being christians it struck you he said you don't even need a prayer line i believe in prayer lines i believe in having them but i believe what the prophet said here the only thing you need is an open heart oh god hey hey hey the only thing you need is an open heart now do you see why the devil wants to clog up your heart now do you see why the devil wants to clog up the heart of the church is because if the heart is clogged then nothing can pass through there's no power can pass through no inspiration can pass through but if it ever becomes unclogged you'll see john 14 12 manifested in the church of the living god oh and the inspiration drops and then nothing can change your mind you have got it now brother andrew are you sure about this message are you sure about what you're preaching i am so sure i am willing to die for it i am so sure that what i'm preaching out of tonight is inspired can i tell you what a prophet said amen he said men of old to the ages has read this bible it's inspired congregations ever since it was written [Applause] it's inspired congregations ever since it was written he said it's like a love letter he said but once god has spoke for the entire human race it's just as fresh tonight as it was the hour it was spoke god spoke and said that christ was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world and when god drew his program in his mind and spoke it amen christ was slain right there [Music] though he wasn't actually slain for four thousand years later he said but notice this and god in there threw for knowledge seen who would be saved and who would not and there our names were written in the lamb's book of life from the foundation of the world and associated with the slain lamb oh church are you all hearing me tonight then that tells me the one that was inspired amen the word to be wrote was the same one inspiring amen the interpreter of the written word is the same one inspiring the church of the living god tonight when you catch the inspiration now the prophecy when a man is inspired amen he reads the inspired word and he set the two inspirations together somebody shout together gives the result no matter how well you study it'll never do good till you are inspired yourself the words already inspired so what we need today is an inspiration over us god sweeping down with a new inspiration breathing over us his power and his love and himself that it might inspire us to quicken us and to awaken us to his word see and then the word being brought into the spirit of inspiration then you'll see miracles things happen because the two amen just comes together now watch this when the two comes together the miraculous takes place when the two comes together the miraculous takes place all right let's go to mark 14 where there was a woman who came in and she washed the feet of jesus right she comes in to wash the feet of jesus and the prophet said notice she had a service to do for him she had heard of him now she's seen him with her eyes she had a service to do she had nothing to do it with but she rushed forward anyhow to do the service and god furnished amen the towels and the water because there was an inspiration there oh god oh her channels weren't clogged up even her mind wasn't clogged up even when she laid eyes on him brother jonathan she said that's him that's him that's the one that can forgive sin that's the one that can heal the body that's the one that raised the dead that's the one they've been there stopped by bartimaeus and opened his blinded eyes that's him what happened inspiration amen fell down on her heart and when inspiration fell on her heart it moved her into action now are y'all hear me and i preached you for a second the prophet said she had the elbow she had to elbow her way to the crowd to get to the feet of jesus do you realize when somebody would stop her and say what are you doing she would say i'm going come on i'm going to wash the feet of jesus are you awake they would look at her and say what are you going to do it with where's your towel where's your water i don't know but there's a pulsation in my heart there's a pulsation in my heart that if i just get at his feet amen he'll supply the water he'll supply the town what are you saying brother andrew i'm saying tonight if you'll just let the holy ghost open up the channels he'll supply the inspiration he'll supply the refreshing he'll supply the revival she rushed forward he meant to do him a service why because there was a pulsation in her heart there was an inspiration there was a channel there opened to receive it now i want to say it like this in the old testament one of the water tactics of the enemy was to come in and stop up the water channels if the enemy could stop off the water channels it wouldn't be long before the entire camp would die if you look in genesis 26 17 the bible says isaac departed pence pitched his tent in the valley of guerrilla and dwelt there and i'm just going to read through this quick and isaac again the wells of water which they did the days of abraham his father for the philistines had stopped them after the death of abraham and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them and isaac's servants digged in the valley and found their wealth spring and water and the herdsmen of guerrero did strive with isaac's herdsmen saying the water is ours and they called the name of the well esec because they strove with him then they dig another well and they strove for that also when he called the name of it sitna but i love verse 22 and he removed from fence and digged another well and for that they strove not and he called the name of it rahul both and he said for now the lord notice what he said here before abraham's will and isaac's well and isaac digged and his servants dick but now he says the lord has made room for us amen and we shall be fruitful in the land so what he was showing you here is the time would come when there would not be a power strong enough to drive you away from the whale that god had opened up and the water in it to flow through you the promise in the public utility if you don't pay the bill they'll cut the water off you'll drive around the house and he said that's what's the matter with god's people tonight in the last few minutes the evangelist is coming out okay that's what's the matter with the people tonight they just didn't pay the price amen and the water has been cut off he said you know what he said that's reason some full gospel church members and so forth don't believe in divine healing because the water has been cut off and where there's no water it gets stickers where there's water that same plant will soften up and make leaves now let me say like the prophet said that when they found out there was without water and when you're without water you're without life when there's no water in the church there'll be no joy in the church when there's no water in the church there'll be no hand shaking in the church when there's no water in the church everything the preacher says was aimed at me and my family when there's no water oh i hit something right there when there's no water in the church amen every sermon is condemnation to you every song it's kind of when there's no water in the church there's no joy in the church and the devil knows that so he'll do everything he can ain't meant to stop up the channels that the water can flow through amen but i say devil get out of here because the holy ghost is here with a stick of dynamite ain't meant to open up the channels in the church now let me say it like this we do not enter these things amen i want to lay some word in here for a second we do not enter the spiritual things by fear amen but by faith now watch this the prophet said i'd like to have this afternoon meeting on instructing man just in the way of the spiritual things that i understand i'm not a teacher but let me tell you how to enter into this spirit he meant a more spiritual way so the prominent are saying i'm not a theologian i'm here as your brother to instruct you on how to enter into the things in a more spiritual way look here in second timothy 1 7. the bible says god has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind then the promises of god are not the promises of man they are divine promises that are accompanied with divine power now in here in second timothy 1 we find these three divine promises of god the spirit of power the spirit of love amen and the spirit of a sound mind the spirit of power spirit of love and the spirit of a sound mind let's can i take a few minutes here the spirit of power micah 3 verse 8 shows us there is a spiritual power to rebuke sin but truly it says i am full of power by the spirit of the lord and of judgment and of might to declare unto jacob his transgression and to israel her sin in luke 4 14 we see the spirit of power comes upon jesus as an example that the spirit of god is superior somebody shout superior is superior to every other spirit and jesus returned in the power of the spirit in the galilee and there went out of fame of him through all the region round about acts 4 33 and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all acts six and eight and stephen who was full of faith and power did great wonders and miracles among the people see then the prophet of god will say lord amen take every young man amen and let him rise up and get anointed with the spirit the spirit of love the spirit of fellowship the spirit of power that they might help take the gospel into all the world see then the gospel travels by the spirit of power by the spirit of love and the spirit of fellowship and what three channels does the devil love to shut up in the church the spirit of power the spirit of love and the spirit of fellowship now don't get clyde on me we just saw this through cove and he shut up the spirit of fellowship amen amen not now well let me just say like this for the vernon he tried his best to shut it up [Applause] hello the spirit of fellowship to where a brother can't shake a brother's hand and a sister can't hug his sister's neck amen and the believers can't come together they may notice this but the spirit of power amen is here tonight to open up the channel of fellowship come on church we need the fellowship of believers of like precious faith oh i'm a preacher for a second you know what amazes me is we got people that won't come to church because they say they can't get along with somebody in the church but they go to the party at christmas time with their boss and they go to the uh they go to the company's party and you mean to tell me you get along with all of them well then i just put up with her i just put up with their ways amen now if you can be forbearing with a bunch of sinners and a bunch of drugs and alcoholics then don't you think it's time amen to get a love in your heart for the fellowship of the believers of like precious faith my bible says that light has no fellowship with darkness amen and sin has no fellowship with righteousness and faith has no fellowship with unbelief come on church we need the spirit of power amen to open up the channel amen of fellowship in the church again the prophet said our heavenly father i'm gonna read this may they every superstition leave the people that devil that tries to keep them in darkness he said truly they are designed to be the seat of abraham and i ask that you'll go send away this evil or give me the spirit of power oh brother jonathan i love that here's a preacher standing there praying are you awake here's a preacher praying and he says lord give me the give me the spirit of power or i ask you'll send this evil away and just like this because the channel was not clogged up for the samuel he could turn and say satan i wish to speak to you you see you're exposed your time is nearly over your condemnation of that day i stand here ask god's servant you're not afraid of me but you are of him and i represent him in his death in his burial in his resurrection these people represent him and you got your demons all bound to these people and you think you can hold them anybody want to talk to the devil for a second devil you think you can hold this church you think you can hold this bride you think you can hold this young man you think you can hold this young woman but you are just a bluff you are stripped of every privilege that you have you have no legal right the spirit of jesus stripped you of every power you had at calvary you are nothing but a bluff you ain't bluffing us no longer jesus is here and you are rebuked glory when the channel of power is open he said thou spirit of doubt come out of this people in the name of jesus christ leave this people go out of this building and may every one of them be healed in jesus christ's name are you ready for this next statement if you're ever going to believe you'll believe right now is there any believers here tonight is there any believers here tonight if you're ever going to believe you're going to believe now if you're ever going to believe you're saved you're going to believe now amen if you're ever going to believe you've got the holy ghost you're going to believe now if you're ever going to believe the devil that has held you as annihilated you're going to believe now is there any believers here tonight that can stand up and say i believe there's one amen i believe i believe the devil is rebuked and jesus is here i believe sin is forgiven i believe the channels are opening up the spirit of god is blowing out the blowing out the lines
