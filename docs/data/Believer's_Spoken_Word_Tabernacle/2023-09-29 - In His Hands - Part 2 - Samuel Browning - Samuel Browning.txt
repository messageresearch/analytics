God hallelujah woles hallelujah you believe oh he's at all time [Music] God well yes he is Joseph may not come when I want him to but there all time oh yes he is all time God yes [Music] he I'm I'm a witness to that he's on time amen not always on what my time that I'm looking for him but he's on time amen and you know it's just uh so many times sometimes we are praying and we're looking to the Lord for things and and we we don't seem to have an answer right away but that's where patience God is molding and building patience in our lives and you know I what I'm thankful for it's very simple but just as God is moving and working in each of Our Lives I'm glad that he gives us Grace Amen to go through the tests and the trials it's like when brother Bram you know was was asking in uh the three kinds of Believers and he says Lord he said don't keep the tests and trials from me that's ordained for my life but just give me the grace am to go through them because God knows what we have need of and uh he knows his grace is there to bring us through all the way I remember one time brother brandham was he was praying and he was just saying Lord I just want to come on home I want to come on home and he says the spirit of the Lord just spoke back to him and says are you trying to dodge your trials but you know God is he's molding he's molding and he's shaping us here in this in this moment and I tell you truly standing over there it it the things that we deal with now do not compare with the glory that shall be revealed in US it doesn't compare and you know everything that God brings us through that he permits we come out stronger you know there's a great difference when we look at with trials and tests because trials and tests we understand are not correction it's things that God's working out to bring character in our life there's time times where things where God can use other means to bring correction on our life but no more than you or me you know you you don't correct your children in whatever manner you do you don't just correction is not just something where you just say go sit down there for what correction comes because there's been something that has been stepped over and that's the how God works with us so test and trials is not that of God coming to correct us is God coming to bring out of our Lives what's needed but how you know within the midst of it all we still come into that place don't we as Believers where brother Bram he shows us that principle in the scripture where we can look in the word and examine our hearts to be certain of God to be certain where we're standing and to know that if there's any there's nothing between us and God then we can stand we're standing firm on the promise and we're just looking to the Lord to come to fulfill his word and to bring us through so I just thank God for that and I I tell you I believe with all my heart in this hour uh this could you know stand here for some hours in time to speak on it but I believe that there's one one thing that we could we all benefit from and that is real real spiritual reflection in our lives and looking at the word of God and when we see in our lives areas that Lord I need I need to come up in this area of my life and you know we couldn't see it if unless God shows it to us friends unless God shows CL it to us we we don't see it uh sometimes you know you and that's where we need his grace to show us these things and I as my heart's desire is is God I want to I want to not only look into the mirror of your word and when I see I want to see where I'm short at I want to see where I'm short I want to see those areas that Lord I need I need to surrender that your strength can be poured into it I we want to walk in that kind of a way amen and I believe God in this hour he's provided for us truly a mirror um you know I think back as I say that now uh years ago brother Dan daisley He preached the service and he preached it throughout the world actually and it was he preached entitled it Cinderella and he was dealing with you remember s Cinderella mirror mirror on the wall and he talked about God has given us a real Mirror Has restored the mirror in this hour because there's been mirrors that have spoke and other things but they've not been true but God's given us a true mirror in this hour and there's a there's a True Fit to the word in our life amen so we just thank God for that just want to re remind you to keep remembering in prayer uh the different needs I know the requests that were mentioned here tonight and we just want to continue to hold one another up in prayer the Lord will just continue Amen to strengthen different ones I just had got that text earlier before coming from uh brother Mark regarding sister Doris there and so we want to continue with that also uh sister aah was there a request put in for that okay so we want to continue to remember how is she doing she's gone through two um radiation treatments okay just kind of Wai to see how the T looks okay so we want to just continue to remember Sister a in prayer the Lord will just continued just to move on her behalf that her body would also accept that treatment uh it's the same way with uh uh for sister Erica Parker and U you know she's on the same going under the same treatment that uh brother Ron Spencer is on as far as with that particular drug and that's where the doctors have directed in that moment and you see even in this right here God provided where that was going to cost them $40,000 a month just for that drug but God provided where the insurance said we're not going to cover this and things turned and the insurance is going to cover so you know God works and those are things that we just we take every little token and and here's the thing no matter how our healing comes it all comes from God whatever Avenue it comes through it comes from God and to God be the glory amen so let's just let's go to him in a word of prayer here tonight as we prepare to open the word of God and we we need more than the hands of a man to do that Heavenly Father Lord as we are thankful for this moment Lord that you have given us out of Lord the week and the days and the times that we have and Lord in these few moments Lord oh God there is so many different things Lord that God that you Lord are more than able and desirous to accomplish in our hearts Lord that father our faith Lord even here tonight for every request upon every heart and for those requests Lord that we've just mentioned Lord those that were read earlier father May Lord our faith Lord even tonight God may it just rise Lord as we are setting in your presence Lord I pray that you would just Lord move Among Us Lord in the Fulfillment of your word where you said of two or three be gathered together in my name I'll be there in the midst of them also and Lord we're just we're trusting Lord in you we are so thankful God for your presence Lord Lord thankful for this moment that we have and we just pray that Lord you'll just come Among Us and Lord just doing Lord Eternal things Lord God moving Lord for every need that's Among Us different ones Lord that are not able to be here Lord tonight may you move for every need God moving upon every heart Lord and I pray that God that you'll just Lord pour out of your spirit once again Lord may you just move Lord in a special way that for every heart Lord oh God our heart would be made to burn within us Lord and father that Lord as we would leave from this place Lord whether we see the evidence or not there is this certainty that burns in our hearts Lord that it's finished Lord that it's all over Lord we pray that God that you'll just take control Lord we place every need every request Lord every desire we place it oh God on the throne of God under the blood of Jesus Christ and Lord Lord we thank you Lord that you have Lord given us the promise Lord ask the father anything in my name and I will do it and Lord we're just looking to you tonight Lord anoint us together as speaker and hearer father that in all things you might be glorified in our midst Lord in Jesus name prise Lord amen and amen amen thank you musicians amen I want to just go here once again into the scriptures in job 23 I just want to read a few vers of scripture here tonight and I want to if the Lord will help us I mentioned to you last week that I wanted to go into this thought on in his hands and I would want to I want to continue with that tonight and just take another part of it and just to speak on that here just for a few moments in verse 8 job said behold I go forward but he is not there and backward but I cannot perceive him on the left hand where he doth work but I cannot Behold Him He hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him but he knoweth the way that I take and when he hath tried me I shall come forth as goldall amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated we look at how that job would Express this and job is aware that God is right there God is around he has heard from the Lord God is spoken to him he's got a revelation in his heart that he knows that he has met God and he's standing on the provided sacrifice of the Lord but job remember as the prophet would tell us the many of the things that were job what was troubling him is because job knew God by Revelation and what was taking place God had not spoke to him regarding this whole thing now however many days however many weeks it was I don't have that knowledge upon that but no matter what it is it was one to see things taking place and not to have an understanding on it you know how you and I feel sometimes when things are taking place around us and our minds can go 100 miles in less than a minute we can cover all sorts of ground within it what if it's this what if it's this what if it's about this or what if it's about that and all of those parts are all part of that of how that we would think and consider in our life because for us and our lives as a Believer when God has touched your heart and your life there is a desire to please him and that's the very thing that moves you and moves us day by day and Moment by moment the prophet said as a matter of fact he said he describes it like the belt on the pulley of a car that you have to have those those that that belt going around and it puts that tension on those pulleys and that's what causes that car to go down the road and he said that's how it is for us as a Believer is that we have a tension in our life and that tension is always am I pleasing to the Lord that's and so brother Bram turns it around he says so see after all tension is a blessing he said think about if we didn't have this tension what we would be that's right so God moving in our life our desire is always to know and where we're standing that we're pleasing to the Lord and this thought and in his hands when the Lord just moving upon that and I begin to look at this and matter of fact this scripture here in verse 9 I've pondered and I you know I've been preaching out of job 23 here for quite some time now a few months and even out of this section but and I've looked at that on the left hand and looked down on the right hand but how God begin to just deal with my heart here a few weeks ago and going in there because as job would would would move and draw the attention to that and I want to just draw our attention not so much to the first part of the verse tonight I want to just really focus on the the right hand of God now we know that God is a spirit we know that God does not have hands like we have but there everything that we see within the scripture it's all even um symbolic and it's all it's uh it's figurative and how that even God would even relate and make himself known to you and I when it would say the stretched out arm of the Lord or the mighty hand of God it's showing God's personal dealing with Humanity in the Fulfillment of his word and God loves to fulfill his word God loves to make his word known and God just doesn't do it just to show off uh but God has a purpose there's a people that's ordained to catch when that manifestation is made known there's a people that's ordained much like the film in a camera that is made to catch when that light is impressed against it that's the same way in our life that though we could go for a many many times and and wondering and pondering our our our journey here upon Earth what am I here for what's my purpose and a lot of those things but God holding that purpose all and once that light comes across our pathway and you know you might be setting under the light but when you get into that right angle of it and finally that light strikes and then he becomes the satisfying portion and it just it drops so in your life that you realize this is why I'm here I'm here to serve the Lord all of these other parts of life they're they're okay but that's not my main that's not my main purpose whatever your occupation or anything you're here for that's not the main purpose there main purpose is to serve the Lord that's the beginning of all things is to fear the lord and to serve him and then he says all these other things will be added to us and so there is a a blessing that we can see here within the word where job and I want to draw from this because this this scripture here where what resonated so much in my heart when the Lord began to deal with my heart some weeks ago uh before the Labor Day weekend was that we find ourselves so many times as Believers and as Believers in the hands of God and that's where we want our lives to be we want we want to be surrendered vessels in the hands of God As a matter of fact brother B says you can't even be in God's hands until you're fully surrendered to him now my life your life no matter where I was even when I was out in the world my life was still in its hands Satan couldn't touch it because I was ordained to eternal life that didn't take away all the decisions and scars and baggage and everything else but God had an ordained plan of when God as he would draw he would deal with my life and bring me to himself and it would come to a place to where that I just like you had to come to a place of surrendering our life into the hands of God cuz God won't take our life but God wants us to surrender it God wants us to come to that place to real realiz I can't do this I can't do this on my own I can't make this happen is because every time that I keep going on it nothing makes sense but Lord in your hands You're The God Who satisfies You're The God Who takes where just like we looked at last week of Five Loaves two fishes You're The God Who takes and multiplies what little I have what can be placed in your hands and that's the thing with our life we want our life to be placed into the hands of almighty God so when we look at this this part of left hand and right hand it's all about our life and how that God deals with us and so I want to just move in which we're very accustomed to and have no doubt a lot of understanding and background we hear the right hand of god mentioned quite often we never hear too much even in the scriptures of where even a reference is mentioned of the left hand but job catches something here and it's important but I won't get to that tonight but I want to just Express when job says he hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him notice as it says he hideth himself what job is expressing is that he cannot see him which he's not visible in manifesting himself in his glory and his power for this moment yet job knows he is present but he's concealed as if it was one who is covered amen that's good and this is something that job is not seeing his glory he's not seeing manifestations and that's something even in that job is saying this is the right hand of God and I'm not seeing it the very word that we look here in the scripture to see it's the very word uh that that is mentioned first of all in Genesis 1:3 when it says God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness in Genesis 18 many places I could go with this but I want to just stay with this and the Lord appeared unto him that word appeared saw unto him in the plains of mamory and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself to the ground so this was not a vision that Abraham was seeing God had stepped from that realm into this realm The God Who was right there now became visible it was a visible undeniable manifestation he saw God just as when God said let there be light and brother BR says if there never had come forth light and until that light comes forth there could be questions but once the light is made manifest of what was spoken that removes all doubt amen and so that's where God God speaks his word but then it's in God's hands to bring his word to pass and when God brings his word to pass it will it's never by the Ingenuity or the strength of man we've seen that Moses tried to do it in his own strength he took a promise of God but he couldn't do it in his own strength Moses had to be an instrument in the hand of God there were many men that raised up before the days of the Lord Jesus and led people out there into the deserts with Promises of Messiah well was it men rising up under their own strength but when God comes to fulfill his word it's not the strength of man doing it it's the strength of almighty God that's why in this hour we needed not the strength of man man I I tell you wonderful where man will labor and and everything but when man relies on his strength he always is limited and he gets in trouble because our reasoning can only go so far it can only move so far that's why it must be the supernatural strength of the Living God it has to be God come because let me tell you as you and I as Believers to be a real believer you've got to meet the supernatural God you've got to know that this is not just a word or just a letter or something you've been talked into or it's just a reasoning or it's something that well that makes sense or this is the truth but you've got to know him you've got to know the person of Jesus Christ he is the truth the life and the way it is the very strength of almighty God because if we're talked into something you can be talked out of it that's why we need something greater that's why God when he deposits his word he doesn't deposit it in our spirit he goes to the deepest most place in our life the the soul that's God's dwelling place that's the Tabernacle of God that is the temple not made with hands that's where the word must be deposited because if it's just in our spirit there's no overcoming power there if it's just on our flesh which would move there with the spirit as well there's no strength no overcoming power but when there moves to the inside when he's taking his place and there has come a rest then there is a strength that moves through that life amen and there are witnesses here tonight of that so you're seeing this looking and and seeing it's it's visible where God makes himself visible and known right among us this is where that even Jacob could say in Genesis 48:3 Jacob said to Joseph this is when Jacob is preparing to pass God Almighty appeared unto me at l in the land of Canaan and blessed me that's where he rested wrestled with the angel of the Lord he appeared to me so it wasn't just a vision you see what God told Abraham when he walked to Genesis 22 and Abraham went up there in Journey what Abraham slew on the altar was not a vision Visions don't bleed are you with me it had moved from this it had moved and become visible it had become a manifestation what brought that forth not man but the right hand of God it's God fulfilling his word let me just say this to you we can't have the left hand without the right hand I I wish I could just preach and hold you here tonight but I don't want to hold you here you understand but to understand we want God that God is working in our life but God works by his power amen and so it must be that meeting with god notice in Exodus 14:13 Moses said to the people fear you not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show to you today for the Egyptians whom you've seen today you'll see them again no more forever right so stand still and behold this so it isn't something that's obscure you actually see what has been tormenting you what's been after you stand still and see the salvation of the Lord and they turned and saw the Egyptian consumed it was not a figment of their imagination it was the power of God that moved down and consumed the Egyptians that were after themall the right hand of God that's right in Psalms 48 verse 8 it's David says as we have heard so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts in the city of our God God will establish it forever saah we have thought of thy loving kindness oh Lord in the midst of thy Temple according to thy name oh God so is thy praise unto the ends of the Earth thy right hand is full of righteousness verse Psalms 145:17 I want to just capitalize on that a moment the Lord is righteous in all his ways and holy in all his works hallah so remember God just don't show himself to put on a show that's right how many times you hear Brother BR I'm will bring it down in vernacular that we can understand God don't clown for nobody even when Satan came to the Lord Jesus and said if thou be the Son of God turn these turn these stones into bread he was in a moment of Temptation so he came to test him in a moment of weakness to see could he get him to surrender and use his power in the midst of a temptation but he stayed with the word why because God is not obligated to show off or to clown for anyone right this is why even when that man came to brother Bram and said you know when he was you know one of them that was doubting Divine Healing said here let me cut this little girl's arm and then you turn around and heal her and brother bandam just said it he was hitting some pretty nice words but that man was insane why would you say that let me destroy this little girl's arm and then you turn around and heal her it wouldn't matter do you understand it wouldn't matter even if that would have been done that man was not a Believer that's right friends there's sometimes where you God himself can stand right and before people and he is it's God in his people that's right amen and they don't recognize it amen God making his word known Healing The Sick delivering the captive filling with the Holy Ghost Discerning the hearts right where the words going forth and yet was sitting right there and look looking at it and not recognizing it it's not a man with hit and miss a man can't do that it's God doing that I don't ever come in here with the intention of let me see if I can just determine what's on brother Ray's heart or what's on so I don't have to do that if I just stay with what God has put on my heart and whatever track he wants to lead me on I am confident that God knows our need he is the chief Shepherd I am an UND sheeper Hallelujah just to follow him that's right God making promise known after promis known why does God do that to get the attention of his people amen I tell you what they're blessed people cuz there's many that can see the mighty miracles of God's hand and turn around and walk away lives that no doubt every one of us can give testimony of even I think over the years of different ones that have come oh I'll serve the Lord I'll do this I'll do that and God has moved in such a marvelous way and where they at right that's right where they at friends I'm not dting people I'm just trying to say who who but God could do that God showing his love and care you say why would God do that and God knew they were going to walk away that's because God loves Humanity that much that's right amen come on now you talking about the love of God I tell you we can't even scratch the service when we start looking at no wonder that the man that they found that wrote in that insane institution the love of God oh so rich and pure who can fathom it you can't we can't wrap our hands around it I'm glad I'm glad about that because it's wrapped you and I up it's got our soul our life wrapped up I can't figure it out I can't understand it but I'm overwhelmed true the Lord God's ways his god making himself known by his right hand his power his majesty his glory it works in continuity with the Fulfillment of his word god comes among us to do what not just to heal us but he comes to encourage us that's why testimonies are important that's why when we're praying for different needs and we see God moving on the scene that's god making known his love and his care right here among us see and this is why let me just refer to this here which I know we're aware of it but brother Brandon refers to it like this what does right hand mean in the Hebrews chapter 1 he says not that God's got a right hand that somebody's setting on but a right hand means the power and authority and he's got the authority of everything in Heaven and Earth and all the heavens and earth is made by him now I want you to think of what God had told you know even what the promise he had made to Abraham about bringing the Israel the children of Israel out of Egypt I want you to notice in Exodus 3:20 God told Moses he said and I will stretch out my hand as he said the verse before this they will not be brought forth no not by a mighty hand you could have took what would have seemingly been the mightiest Army it could have never delivered Israel no that's right right that's right it couldn't have take the mightiest hand or whatever mightiest Nation we know e Egypt was the mightiest at that time but find out whatever's the next in line it couldn't do it no amen only God could why it's prophecy to be fulfilled and when God has made a promise are you hearing me tonight don't just let it be for this right here take it down for your loved ones take it down for your children take it down for your husband your wife whomever it is that you're looking at and saying they're all out here if God has made a a promise and he has he said believe and thy and thy household shall be saved and he said they and their offspring shall be there with them that's a promise that a man didn't make God made that promise so God made that promise then it's up to God to fulfill that promise and it'll be fulfilled by nothing less than the supernatural strength of almighty God manifesting his right hand of power Exodus 3:20 said and I will stretch out my hand and smite Egypt with all wonders which I will do in the midst thereof and after that he will let you go so God breaking down their will boy man these things will preach you see God manifesting himself what was God doing he was breaking down cuz Pharaoh kept saying Pharaoh would come Pharaoh oh he was on the edge of his seat you know and then all of a sudden another service would go by God comes back around another service what's God doing breaking down the will that's right that's what leads to the New Birth is where the old man dies that's right that's what God does that's what God moves service after service Time After Time what's he doing it by his outstretched hand hallelujah oh my now notice when Israel came in and Moses after what I read in Exodus 14 here Moses sings the song uh that that is sung in Victory and verse six say says of Exodus 15 thy right hand O Lord is become glorious in power thy right hand oh Lord hath dashed in pieces the enemy wo in verse 11 is lack unto thee Oh Lord who is lack unto thee Oh Lord among the gods who is like thee glorious in Holiness fearful in Praises doing wonders thou stretches out thy right hand and the Earth swallow them Hallelujah I'll tell you where I take comfort in this right here that the same Mighty hand that moved down in Egypt and revealed the way out was thre and by the lamb oh my when they were looking are you hearing me what they were looking for what is my ticket out of here I wonder how long they have been raising those sheep that lamb that they had been feeding there for that period of time little did they know the blood of that lamb it would come under the divine order by God's revelation and being applied it would become the loosening liberating power of the word of almighty God where a promise was made but now has become visible and glorious in power amen and not only did God lead him out into the Wilderness but God was with them all along when the Egyptians rose up and wanted to pursue after them brother br will take this in many different types he'll type the Red Sea of sanctification then he'll type it as the day of Pentecost then he'll type it a sickness coming after us as Believers it's always follow following in those places of where it's to be applied in our lives at that moment and we see that here all the way through the all the way through the Journey God steps on the scene to make himself known that his power did not begin and end in Egypt so good so I'm going to say this God's power in this message did not end or begin and end with brother Bram that's right it did not begin and end right in when Us coming out of Egypt he's right here Among Us it's the same Living God and it's not just for not just for ministers you have access as Believers you have access to the throne of God that's why the preaching of the word the preaching of the word is not for us to look up to a man the preaching of the word is all about lifting him up and that we can see if there's anything that's getting in our pathway that's hindering our daily walk walk with God the word is there to reveal it that's God's love so we're not looking at a man and lifting a man up we're seeing him being lifted up and we're looking at that channel to make sure and see that there's nothing between us and him oh how we need him that's Joshua 4:23 and here's Joshua the testimony before they're going over the Jordan notice this rehearsal before they're going over the J Jordan for the Lord your God dried up the Waters of the Jordan from before until you were passed over as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea which he dried up before us until we were gone over that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the Lord that it is mighty that ye might fear the lord your God forever so God did it his mighty hand and of all the times in the world for God to pick going across Jordan it's the time when it's the worst it's flooded it's a time of Latter rain season it's a time when it's flooding but that was the very time that God declared it's time to go over amen and God Made A Way showing he the same God you see his characteristics are still the same and why did he do that he did it that the Earth might know the hand of the Lord that it's mighty did it help all the rest of the Nations no what was that when God made known his word that was a promise that God said I'll send the Hornet before you what would it be it would be the mighty acts of God being made manifest and when the people would recognize and see that it would be the angel of the Lord stinging against those individuals and what was it they would be in fear all the courage would be taken out of their heart but you would have people like Rahab that they would hear of the mighty hand of God and they would say if God can open the Red Sea the god that can open the Jordan surely God can make a way for me that I can walk in righteousness and Holiness and live and overcoming life my my my my what gave her that kind of an understanding there was something on the inside that could connect with the mighty hand of God hallelujah Psalm 168 David said I have set the lord always before me I love this scripture yes my I love this scripture it no matter what your promise is right listen friends this scripture is one scripture that I rest in after every service after every meeting because no matter what it is who I've seen or we've not seen if you can let the Lord be always before you that after we leave out of here or whatever that it's not my ideas that's in the Forefront anymore not my thoughts but I have put the Lord before me amen I love this because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved so whatever promise that I am seeking for he's at my right hand he's the one strengthening me when I get discouraged he's at my right hand he's encouraging me the promise is you the promise is for you this is your promise he is at my right hand I shall not be moved yes sir amen therefore he's at my right hand oh my my my therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth My Flesh also shall Rest In Hope for thou Willl not leave my soul in Hell neither wil thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption thou Wil show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy and at thy right hand are Pleasures forever more aren't you thankful for that am at thy right hand are Pleasures forever more oh if every day could be a right-hand day that's right I won't get there tonight but oh if every day could be a right-hand day yes sir but needless to say the pleasures that are at the right hand and having access to it and you know not allowing the enemy to keep you back even when you come into service sometimes you feel labored and loaden with the cares of life and burdens and the things that you've uh throughout the week you've come face to face with some things that nearly about knock the wind out of your CS that you we're not expecting but yet as you come into the presence of God and God begins to strengthen you God begins to minister to you God begins to comfort you in that moment what is that those are Pleasures from the right hand Hallelujah every one of us can testify of walking into a service and and we're down we're discouraged maybe I'll just preach for the five that feel that way sometimes but it is something that is within us to know that I I'm I want to get to the house of God it's not just so much of being in these walls it's being in the presence of other belever Believers where the presence of God is moving you may not be in a downtime but somebody else might be but that's a time to say Lord flow through me I want to be one that's an encouragement that actually will allow the spirit of God to create an atmosphere to move for needs that are present here in the body that to me is a responsibility that I have you have of God I'm here to create an atmosphere I don't ever walk out of the service and say I did not get anything from God there are things that God will speak to me but let me just say this to you if there was one time that I could ever walk out of service and say I never received anything at all I don't know how that would be but there's one thing that I do want to be able to declare I am here to be an instrument and a part of the body I'm talking about if I'm setting right there is to be a channel to bring the spirit of God on the scene I told told you many times there's sometimes the reason I sat in certain places even when I've gone into certain meetings or certain times here I sat in certain places just for a certain reason you know sometimes you get behind people that can be quiet and everything else get behind them and you start pulling on the gift of God I know that the spirit of God it'll reach right back there there's a connection that's going on maybe give away the secrets but they don't matter I would to God we all think of that like that and I could just come right up here and sit down I love in front but there's times where strategically listen friends I've done it in many different meetings I look over the situation and then I'll go set accordingly and just start come on man of God preaching man of God getting right in there why creating an atmosphere I'm not looking down on people we're here to be helped if there's anybody that can help us it's Jesus and that's the only one oh my so he is at my right hand that's why even when the the the symbol of how when the blood would be applied when Moses would take of the heer and of the sacrifice he would apply it on the right thumb he would apply on the right toe right ear all of that was the signifying through the strength and Authority I do not want to go Upon My Own Strength I want my strength to be under the governance of the Holy Spirit to where we're yielded to him that God can use our strength anytime he desires to now think about this in Psalms 44 now notice the Bible said Lord oh in verse one oh God our fathers have told us what work thou didst in their days in the times of old how thou didst drive out the Heathen With Thine hand and plest them now when I read my Bible I read where they had battles I read where Joshua didn't know how to approach Jericho but he knew this is what God Said said this has got to come down first so Joshua went out to meditate and to pray and Joshua went out God met him right Joshua asked now listen it wasn't a vision he met him Joshua drew his sword amen are you for us or are you against us yes right God makes himself known in that moment and God equips Israel with his word and you know how everything comes about with Jericho I don't have time to elaborate on that but then even as every city and each of those things when that whole Conquest notice it was God moving through the surrendered hearts of the people so all it is attributed is that thy hand Lord It's thy hand that drive out the the the Heathen and plant us them how did how how thou didst afflict the people and cast them out for they got not the land in possession possession by their own sword neither did their own arm save them and yet if you would look at them you could say hey that's your sword you're swinging but they're not swinging their sword underneath their own leadership their sword is yielded to the Lord oh my that's how we want to live our lives we want our lives to be surrendered to the power of almighty God we do not want our lives where we are swinging by our own power we'll never get anywhere that's right you'll never get one inch of land whatsoever but notice the promise neither did their own arms save them but thy right hand and thine arm and the light of thy countenance because thou had us a favor unto them now here's another thing to think about the right hand of God can anybody make the right hand come on display no you can't just make it come on display well I tell you what we're going to have a display of the right hand of God tonight he's faithful to his word I believe whatever need we have but you see God's not at our Command it's not it's not us commanding and US Desiring us doing this and us doing that you understand what I'm saying neither is it when it comes to things that are to be moved and dealt with in our life families and situations we cannot command the right hand of God remember brother Bram said he was listening to a man praying one time and says God I say to you heal this person you don't tell God what to do you don't tell God what to do he's not our servant we're to be his servants he he's not he's not our mascot boy that things we just want this done this is uncomfortable I want this done I want this change I want this change you know sometimes the situations and we all have been guilty within our Humanity that we want change we want it changeed cuz it's rubbing us the wrong way and it's not because the situation don't need to be changed but you know why God allows it to even Linger on on is to get rubbed out what needs to get rubbed out inside of us we're looking at the other person once they become sweet powdered sugar Everything Will Change with me that ain't how it works God works to change us well brother Samuel why is this lingering you might want to ask and say Lord if this is lingering in this way maybe there needs to be some sweetness coming my way I need to have a little bit more of the love of God I need a refilling I need a fresh trip to Calvary to remember that one love me who was the unlovable my my my so the right hand of God we can't force it what we're seeing here is the right hand of God works in Harmony and coordination with his word and the plan of God the program of God is that right so we find that the hand of the Lord I think of this in this measure you remember that as it was when there was the the drought that was there in the land of is Israel and Elijah had called for that there will not be Doom nor rain fall until I call for it and when it came time for that the the season of that to end remember Elijah sent Gesa up to the mountain and he said I want you to go to the top of this mountain and look over the sea he went it was seven times he kept coming back to Elijah and said I don't see nothing Elijah said go again came back I don't see nothing go again I don't see nothing well it could teach a lot there but finally Gesa came down and Gesa said I see a cloud like a man's hand that's rising up out of the sea Hallelujah and when he said that the Bible and a Elijah sent him to tell Ahab get down to jezrael so your chariot don't get stuck here cuz the rain is coming jezrael is 20 mil away and once he announces it the hand of the Lord comes upon him and he runs ahead of Ahab and meets him at the entrance of jezrael yes sir Hallelujah you say what was it that gave Elijah the strength to run like that you might look at that and say man I ain't seen nothing like that except it's on cartoons no we ain't talking about cartoons we're talking about a living almighty God that was a type for you and I that the prophet said when you see the hand of the Lord j s u s and Faith Rises he said when God makes it known in your heart you're healed I'm the Lord that Health it when it begins to pulsate in your life this is the truth he said run towards the holy ghost at that moment take off running sir it's certain Elijah all you saw is the is a a cloud oh Lord like the size of a man's hand that's all you saw but he said it's certain I done so the victory oh my I got to just stay right here I could we could go down trails and preach but I got to stay right here the hand of almighty God I'm thankful tonight for the God's hand I'm thankful like Jacob when he rest with the angel he was touched by the hand of the Angel he got touched he came out walking different Jacob was no longer Jacob right right but that hidden part mystery on the inside that was all sealed up having the name m having the name Israel but when the seal would be broken then the name could be called and he touched him there and the Bible said he blessed asked him there where did he bless him at down on the inside and Jacob left out of there with a different walk he came out of there different he was a changed man and the god that began the change there brought a change in his life it continued to change everything in Jacob's life is that right just like for you and I that that that one initial change in our life by the Holy Ghost what does it do it sets everything in change it's just like then it just starts everything like one domino falling over all the rest of them are gonna come amen oh my think about it of how that God had moved back the Red Sea I want you to think about this the Mighty God that moved back the Red Sea by his right hand his glorious power would Veil himself in this hour that we're living in and declare the promise behold I stand at the door right and knock the same hand that destroyed Pharaoh's Army that's good the same hand that's so that brought him out of Egypt the same hand has come and knocked on your heart's door the same hand wow has moved down in his glorious power to speak to woo to draw you and ijah what Grace it's a fulfillment you see what God is doing he's making on the Fulfillment of his word just just a few more moments here in Acts 2:32 I'm just going to skip a few scriptures but acts 232 I know we're familiar with it but here's Peter declaring this witness on the day of Pentecost after they've come into this place after coming out of the upper room and here he is giving witness of the word that has come to pass that not only is the true atonement here but it's been offered up amen now watch as he says this this this Jesus hath God raised up whereof we all are witnesses therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he ha shed forth this which ye now see and hear you are W he is is declaring you are witnessing the right hand of God Hallelujah at work what God promised in his word I will not leave my soul in hell hallelu what God promised God has fulfilled that word God hath raised him up that same quickening power raised up that body Seated on the right hand now we understand it's not a right hand like this we understand that's that's a symbol it means Authority and power because when Jesus says in Matthew 28 all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me if God's the one that has all the power now Jesus does somebody lost power and somebody gained power you see what a mess trinitarianism is it is yes sir you see the whole the whole part of redemption is God coming down amen and becoming flesh because with the whole desire not only to shed his blood for you and I but that his own life that he now can impart his own life and move inside of you and I as Believers so that we then can stand as Sons and Daughters of God and think it not robbery Hallelujah that's great to be what the word says I am I am what the word says I am I [Applause] am amen this is the promise which you now see and he because remember this word was taking effect on their lives what you're seeing is is the manifestation of now where this word has been received every promise all the Redemptive blessings all that were laying down through the scriptures everything that had been promised all of these things that had even been shown down through the times now here comes the Fulfillment where God had stepped forward and became man God became one of us to pay the ultimate price of redemption and there notice that here he he ascends back up and that Corporal body is Seated on the throne of almighty God it's there for you and I to lay claim on every Redemptive blessing thank you Lord hallelujah you realize he opened up the way every wall that was we were veiled off we were shut off he opened up the way for you and I to come back into the holiest of holies he opened up the channel for you and I what did that the right hand of God that's right this is why that Steven in the midst of his trial brother BR said he did not even feel one of those claws hit him in the head he being full verse 55 of Acts 7 being full of the Holy Ghost looked up stead flly into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God and said behold I see the heavens open and the son of man standing on the right hand of God he Not only was a witness in his own soul but here notice in that very moment in the time of trial when the when the clouds were getting ready and starting to fly but at that moment there was that opening and what that he saw he saw his Victor he saw the mighty conqueror he saw the lamb he saw the all-sufficient one the one that had redeemed him the one that had delivered him and the same one that was making Away by his redeeming power that stepen never felt one bit of a CLA Hallelujah Hebrews 10:12 but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from hence forth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool wow so good it's over it's already settled every Redemptive blessing the rights to it has already been purchased oh I don't see this yet let me tell you why the word is announcing and calling it out over your life cuz the word is expecting to see the word move in Victory in your life Hallelujah he's expecting until whatever it is that would be troubling you whatever be setting sin whatever sickness whatever it is until the word has come to a place in your life that makes that Devil bow and bow to the name of Jesus Christ the word is stand standing there is seated in power and [Music] Glory Brother Sam I don't feel too glorious John didn't feel too glorious either at a certain moment John on the aisle of patmas when he saw this Vision it took every breath out of him when he saw the revelation of Jesus Christ The Mighty conqueror he saw all of his attributes and John said I fell down and his feet is dead he couldn't take the effect of that Vision but in that moment he laid his right hand upon him and what did he say with his right hand what did he say with his right hand fear not Hallelujah yes sir fear not what does the right hand of God do it's dismissing fear from our lives it's God separating fear you say brother Samuel sometimes I've had fear come my way that that's why the right hand of God is right there with you to dismiss fear when it comes your way I got to share this I hope it's all right come on now I've been I had had this quote for for some years now and I had been waiting on this quote and I pray God let me preach on some some of these things at some point in time but i' had been searching for this quote I told my wife about it I said I don't know where that quote is at I have been looking for it I said I know I put it down in one of my files I tried to find my you know with my uh with searching and things in my different file folders and under things and so forth where is it at I couldn't find it and fin it this week I was sitting there matter of fact it was just yesterday I was sitting there and the Holy Spirit said go look up in the folder the folder that's titled this certain thing the tit folder I had titled menopause to go look that up and go look in a study that I had just you know I just accumulate studies over time and I got in there now here's what the quote was about it was about where brother bam is praying for sister Neville and how that the enemy was so working on sister Neville cuz she was going through a certain time of life and brother BR says it is this way he said for every woman to pass through this Valley they must pass through this moment of darkness he said now Lord Satan would like to take her from Brother Neville he said but God we know that as she's to pass through this Valley may you be right there with her and he said when the nervousness and fretfulness wants to arise May the mercies of God move in in that moment you see what what I'm saying with that quote was it wasn't just pow the nervousness and all of it's gone it wasn't that it was that she had an assurance that God was with her that when these things are coming your way there is The Tender Mercies of God to push back the nervousness and the fretfulness hallelujah boy I could help the doctors out with that quote they let me yes sir same he look it's the same bag I'm drawn from that Moses carried Moses carried a little doctor's bag all the way Moses what prescription you got I'm the Lord that Health all thine diseases somebody just broke their leg I'm the Lord that Health all thine diseases somebody just lost their eye I'm the Lord that Health all that is same prescription now man I don't know that that quote may not mean that much to you but it means a whole lot to me because I look at things like that and I I say God thank you because I know how the enemy likes to wear people out as though they feel like that their need has not been met let me tell you something when something wants to arise and come back that is not a sign that you're licked it's not a sign that you're not an overcomer it's a time you need to stand right there and remind that devil I've been delivered I've been set free I've been healed and you're not going to have dominion over my life how do I do that by the right hand of godall yes sir you may not even be able to get auditory words out you might have to lip them you might have to say in your heart but let me tell you something when you say in your heart God sees it and all Heaven stands behind it my Lord we're here we're at the end we're not at the end but let's just close his right hand how wonderful and we have access to the right hand of God we need as we've been looking at it we need the right hand of God we need the right hand of God in our services we need the right hand of God in our lives we need the right hand of God in our homes we need the right hand of God but can I just say this with you every day is not a right hand I don't sell you that to lower your expectations I tell you that so that you can realize the right hand is given and God makes himself known that you might be reminded that when you don't see him he's still there thank you Lord that when you move from a service you move from something that God has done in your life or another testimony of another individual listen friends testimonies that are given in this assembly it's for us it is I thank God for testimonies you know we share them from other assemblies too because I think they're wonderful it's what God is doing but you see God God's doing things right here in a local assembly and you know what that's for that's for us that's to encourage us now that test you might go out and be a blessing to somebody else but God's doing these things to encourage you and I let us not be like Israel when we come up to another situation we say bitter water what's going on here right huh what's going on here may we remember he's still on the throne yes he is and the right hand is just as glorious in power and let me just leave you with this even when you don't see his power I want you to remember David said his right hand upholdeth me amen that's so good so good so sometimes you may not see something you're looking at and you're being held by his right hand thank you Lord you would have give up a long time ago yes you would have given in but you're being held by the right handise God Amen Wonder like I said last week the stad sister she said oh I must not have had that much faith brother brah said oh no you had great faith right because when God decided not to heal your baby here but take it you stood faithful what is that being upheld by the right hand and I'm sure throughout this building we can have that testimony of when we've been faint God's been faithful amen yes Lord like when they asked brother brandham how are you holding your religion now he said I'm not he's holding me that's rightall he's holding me what's holding you his right hand amen the power of God his presence his glory oh ain't he wonderful and you know he wants to be that for every person if there's one that doesn't know him in that way he wants to be that way amen he wants to walk with you he wants you to put his desire is that you put your hand in his hand and let him lead you and he'll lead you to victory I can promise you that because that's according to his word he'll lead you to victory no matter what it is in your life he still The Great I Am let's pray Heavenly Father Lord thank you Lord thank you God for just how you Lord you you pass by our way Lord Lord as we take moments and we in these Precious Moments you give us Lord and we look into your word as you give us Grace To Do Lord father we are reminded Lord I I know even in just continuing to go over this lord of the right hand and the mighty hand of God and just looking at those places how many times through the book of Deuteronomy you reminded the people Lord where they were at they were standing before going across the Jordan and you reminded them of where you brought them from what you had brought them through and father how we look Lord and we see where you've brought us from Lord where you've brought us to Lord it certainly Lord is not it's not Lord our own word Works anything that we have done any works at all it's because Lord we've been surrendered to your voice to heed your voice Lord we just Lord desire every one of us Lord that's gathered here tonight those that streaming or will archive this Lord I pray that God whatever the need might be tonight Lord as we've seen Lord in your word you just don't show up to show up as your Prophet said you don't clown for the devil but you come to manifest your word and Lord even in all the way through the scriptures we see it we see it through the the prophets of old where you Lord would speak speak to the people through the prophets we see Lord as you became flesh and that Lord for Redemption you took upon a body of Flesh and here Lord what was manifested even the the young man that could testify who was blind and was healed his parents Lord under the pressure of the rulers of the synagogue they didn't want to answer the question who who did this but Lord as he stood there as a young man and he spoke to the religious of that day and he said this is a Marvel you don't know who this is but yet since the world had began there's never been this where the eyes of the blind have been opened father you were right in the Fulfillment of your word Mighty acts of power and the religious of that day could not recognize you could not see you for who you are but father there was a group there was Believers your Prophet put it like this in the message birth pains the church and that was which was waiting on you was a very very very very very small Church he labels that out there Anna Simeon few Believers that was looking God how you came and you manifested your word Your Glory your power to each of their lives to the disciples Lord here they were Lord their lives their lives were changed Peter's life on and on the woman at the well zakus Lord we can go on and on how Elizabeth prayed for zakus and it seemed like it got worse but your Prophet would look down and tell us when we're praying for our loved ones and it seems like they're getting worse and maybe more contener he said that's the time God's working what an encouragement Lord I pray that Lord as we look at that we see in our own lives how that God that you have drawn us Am Lord we're no better we're no better than anybody else as far as flesh same but God it's what you deposited on the inside Lord ordained to eternal life ordained to catch the revelation of your glory and your power and the Victory of Calvary of the mighty conqueror to be reflected through our lives Lord I'm glad we we don't have to just hear a story hear an account but I'm glad that Lord that we can be witnesses that he's the mighty conqueror in my life he's conquered he's conquered me not with Force but by Divine love he's conquered me my heart is overtaken with his love it's cast out the things of this world it's cast out dismantling desires Lord right here Lord I know Lord God as you go down through and your Mighty hand is working Among Us Lord I I ask tonight that may hearts Lord may they not be discouraged but may they look Lord and just continue to surrender to you and allow you Lord to dismantle every desire any hold or anything that's there may they Lord continue to give themselves to you Lord may they come Lord continue to that place to Lord to hate the things that Lord are around them that they would see Lord that would seemingly get in the way and hold them back lord and just surrendering Lord themselves to you may you continue Lord father only you can do this work Lord only you can open the eyes and Lord the same God that comes Lord to bring and transform us Lord You're the same God one of these moments one of these days the right hand of God is going to move down and Lord the dead in Christ will rise they'll appear to us and we'll know our change is on its way Lord God there'll be a Sweep come over will be [Music] changed we'll take that glorified body where Lord has been changed and meat our theophany oh God we've got a promise and like David had said Lord we're living we're not living here by our own right hand we're living by the right hand of
