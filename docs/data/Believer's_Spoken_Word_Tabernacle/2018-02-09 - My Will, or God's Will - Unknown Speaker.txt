you know when we come to the house of God we should always be expecting you know if we if we don't come expecting then this really we we only gonna get what we expected if we don't expect anything then we're not gonna get anything but if we can just expect and you know the thing of it is is that every service is always unique it's always under his divine leadership and guidance you never know how it's gonna go you don't even know as a minister you can study and then you find how that it's based on the needs of the people because it's God taking a gift that he's given and got using that gift to speak to his children and then God has a way in the after service to however that's gonna take place but what we do know is that everything that when we are in his presence there is change taking place there is things there were hearts are being turned hearts are being softened there are God is doing so many things there's you know there's so many things that God is doing that we're not even aware of but that's a confidence that we have in him that he is at work and the Bible says where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty and we are changed from glory into glory aren't you thankful for that that's just not words that's a reality we are being changed we are being changed into his same image well I'm so thankful never that tonight Amen so glad to have brother George with us I want brother George little George just to go ahead and come on and just take his liberty tonight wants to say once again good to have brother Randy and different Saints here with us somebody sure glad you brought your licks of fire and came I tell you what let's just let's just we don't know what God's gonna do but I know one thing he's gonna be God and that's what we want him to be loving tonight it's good to be here this evening we had a good fellow ship today thank you for the music very nice and I've you know learned more about brother Sam his family I didn't know you were up here had an idea there's Church right here but I'm glad to be here and let's stand together and open the scripture this morning that's did this evening the best sound a preacher can hear is the people looking for the scriptures now we're gonna look into where we had here proverbs 14 proverbs I'm sorry Psalms 143 first songs 143 we have three places we're going to read from the one get nervous psalms 143 and verse 8 caused me to hear thy loving-kindness in the morning for indeed do I trust because caused me to know the waiver and I should walk before I lift up my soul unto thee that make a good song when it verse 9 deliver me O Lord from mine enemies I love thee I flee unto thee to hide me teach me to do thy will for thou art my god thy spirit is good lead me into the land of righteousness quicken me O Lord for thy name's sake for that righteousness sake bring my soul out of trouble and over thy mercy and of thy mercy cut off mine enemies and destroy all them that afflict my soul for I am thy servant the servant totally submitted proverbs 14 and verse 12 there is a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death we're going to speak this morning it's evening on a subject my will or God's will we have a choice let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your goodness to us thank you Lord for the way you've led and directed all things we thank you for the music the Lords of those who come out with just pray that you'd bless them feed each one Lord I can only speak the words you gave me but your spirit would put it into their hearts let's each one Lord we ask bless those around the world that are gathered in your name this evening protect them help us Lord we ask in Jesus name Amen you may be seated there's one other scripture on read or in Jonah a few pages on over Jonah was an Israelite he was a prophet he was important to God's plan and the verse 1 now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of amita he's saying arise go to Nineveh that great city cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me so Jonah was you know a Jewish prophet he from he's from a little town called get temper which is in the north part of Nazareth up in Galilee and he was the first foreign missionary an apostle is one that had sent the disciples a follower and apostles one that sent so he was the first foreign missionary and our prophet said that's the highest calling I know so you don't want to hear that because you know prophets well he said the Apostle was the highest calling so will you that he also says here I believe every Christian is obligated not so much that you have to go to the old country and preach but if you can't go help send somebody else everybody should hear the gospel at least once I want to do my part he says there's something about missionary work that I just love it and just to know that what you're doing you're doing God's will when you're giving to missions so we don't even have to pray about it it's just like acts 2:38 you do even have to read it twice it says so do it along with a lot of other scriptures you just do it you know it's very very simple so missionary work is not only you know traveling to someplace where they don't speak your language where they don't have your food but I don't have your temperature of the water in the shower and all that kind of stuff that's not the only way to do missionary work you see missionary work is living for others right here in Ohio you've got a mission field right here you know now it doesn't mean you got to go through the mall passing out tracts just live your message you see so everyone wants eternal life nobody gets up in the morning symbolic see what I can do to get to hell no everybody wants to go to heaven well like the popular song says they just want to go today you know want to get there but not today so as a church and I know that you got a good pastor and he's got a vision but some churches don't have a missionary vision and they just kind of dry up you know but the scripture says without a vision that people perish it's in Proverbs you know it's a little bit loud up here knocking my head together here yeah got enough problems but might not invite me back you know in the message that day on Calvary he says he was just one man the perfect man he gave his life and he made an example for you now what must we do now the first thing I want to say Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others you ever notice that he could have had all kinds of things they live for others that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and do good that's fine but when you live your life for yourself you don't have eternal life eternal life is living for others not so much giving 100 dollars for the people in Africa just living it for here right here you know it proved that when he came in the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and when you receive a kind of life by receiving that day on Calvary you don't live to yourself no more you live for others now at this point we want to give a little bit of a missionary report to let you know what we're doing because we're down in Tennessee we mainly are dealing with the people in Latin America we travel some other places but you know in acts 11 and acts 11 27 they had a situation over there where that there was a famine in the land now God warned them by way of a prophet verse 27 and these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch and there stood up one of them named Agabus and signified by the spirit that there should be a great and darth or in other words a drought hunger throughout all the world which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar and you can go in history and you can find that it was true God warned him you know okay then the disciples in other words the followers of Jesus Christ every man according to his ability determined to send relief under the Brethren that dwell in Judea which also they did and sent it to the elders for the hands of Barnabas and Saul okay so they had a situation and the ones that could they gave their dollar their $20 for two rows and they sent this money and it helped the Saints in Jerusalem okay in Judea well today I don't know if you read the news or seen or anything but there's a great great hunger going on in the country of Venezuela now why is that they live in a you know in a tropical country it never gets cold how come up by Dustin have three chickens and a pig and you know an instant well there's live in cities a lot of them so anyway they're having these problems because they had president that tried to bring it into socialism socialism has never worked in any country around the world but just for the guys the top it's real nice so in the process of bringing the country into socialism he cursed nots people don't mention that name in church we call them the people with the red shirts and so he he said I hate them from the innermost part of my being a little bit later he got cancer in the inner most Peter part of his being so they have the world's greatest proven resources underground oil but it wouldn't matter if they paved the streets with gold it's not going to help because they are cursed thanks to him so now with all this oil other stuff they're starving there's no medicine you take your chitta sick childhood the doctor he prescribed something you go it's not available you know they closed the border with with Colombian with Brazil so people don't escape no go over there by nice stuff and bring home a lots of problems okay so what do we do just sit here and well pray for y'all know we help them we're sending thousands of dollars of rice beans soap toothpaste a lot of stuff from Miami to them and they're helping hundreds of families other people send them cash because there are some there's some food over there they can buy but they're their economy shot they're up to 4000 percent inflation it doesn't work so it's a so we're helping them okay that's one thing another thing that's going on we have a radio broadcast and I know it doesn't sound like much because Americans don't listen to the radio you know but Spanish people do listen to the radio there's two broadcasts ones in Honduras goes out all over Honduras and as the message goes out I think two or three times a week over the hills and the mountains they're listening and they say hey please send somebody we've got three people want to be baptized eventually there's about a group that will send a brother and now there's a church there that's happened many times so that's one broadcast that's working out real well another broadcast is over here on the border of Arizona and Mexico and it goes out every Friday night tonight for example and it's reaching out where we can't go people listen oh that's good okay so one of the men that heard the broadcast he was in jail maximum security and so he heard it somehow hey this is good I like that now what's on the broadcast well there's singing good music there's praying and there's prophet speaking translated tape so they're hearing in English in Spanish so the this fellow heard it and he said man this is good so he sent down through his people because he's in maximum-security so it has to go through his lawyer and everybody eventually get down to the brother that they can do something about it and he said you have any literature so they sent him the the little booklet my life story and the how the angel came to me it's got a little drawing on the front so they sent that to him man this is good well he just happens to be the number one bad guy of the world right now and he's got people everywhere he said I need 10,000 copies of this for my people well we don't have 10,000 copies so we put the text on a memory stick give that to his people and with his money he published 10,000 copies and a few other things now how many of you people here there's probably a hundred and ten people here right or less how many of you people have someone that you know that's on drugs and can't get off this ratio it's okay we're not going to turn you in to the FBI or anything okay so you know how desperate people are to have that stuff whether it's pills whether it's coming from the south or Horwitz from and so they've got to have it right somebody's got to bring it it's called supply and demand now the problem is that to get it from the growers the processors to your relatives and such there's a long process and so they're fighting over that who drives the truck we're in here people getting killed every day in Mexico alone just since the 1st of January there's over a hundred people being killed just in the trafficking of the drugs thousands have been killed over the last few years so this man's in jail the last thing he said when he was sent to New York when I get a little bit of Liberty I'm gonna call you guys come baptize me so his heart's already been turned he already realizes the value of the gospel he rises the value of this message he has put his money into it now there is cases like the thief on the cross never get baptized that's something in the world you know it happens some have repented and come to the Lord and when their bosses saw that cut their head off never got baptized yeah just the last few months well so this man has a wife over in California and she hasn't been able see him for a year because he's been in jail in Manhattan since 20th of January last year well anyway she says you know I've seen the change in him and I've seen the change in my dad was in jail in Mexico I want that same Jesus so he's our sister now she's been baptized she's studying the church age book she's seen what this is all about she almost got to church the Phoenix Sunday but didn't get there but anyway things are happening you know because of the gospel going out you know and so we just know that one of these days we're gonna call and we'll be able to go over and baptize this man so you pray now Jonah Jonah had a direct commission from God didn't have to pray about it you have to go consult anybody go preach to the enemy their wickedness has come up before me I can't stand anymore go preach to him okay only one problem Jonah was Jewish and the people of Nineveh were Gentiles very serious segregation okay now Nineveh at that time was the capital of Assyria currently northern Iraq very wicked sinful people very cruel violent city of over 120,000 people it was a large city took three days to walk around it and these Assyrians were constantly tormenting there's realigns so that didn't start in 1948 that started 3,000 years ago they're always insults or he's been the target okay so God was sending his prophet right into the jaws of danger to face the enemy goal cry against it okay it was time for repentance it was time for warning God always sends a warning before judgment nobody goes straight to hell you have to go by the cross to get there you see and so when Jesus was here he did many miracles in many cities but there was three towns in particular where he did miracles and ministered and they paid no attention uh-huh it was Bethsaida courts him and the worst was Capernaum it's in your Bible now Israel doing very well thank you they've come up from 0 to first world country in seven less than 70 years but those three spots are not inhabited it's a pile of rocks in Capernaum there's a monastery the Catholics have built some things don't get scared thanks to the Catholics there's something to go over there and see they're preserving it because my friends the brand of mites would have brought it all home by now now you think it's crazy I was over there and our dear friend Monaco cumbias was with me so we're in this place upon the Mount Carmel and that's where the Carmelite nuns come from now Carmel there's a big convent and everything so there's a cave this they say this is the cave of Elijah it may have been I don't know there's no sign you know it's just tradition so it's inside this church so we go in there to pray and just to see and take pictures and we get back on the bus and money goes hands are all black want to go what do you been doing bud well I was looking for a loose rock in that cave [Laughter] just want to wring his neck you know but thanks to the Catholics they have preserved these places that's nothing to be scared of I know the Catholics the the some relative of the main patriarch was a friend of ours but anyway Israel is doing fine they're in their homeland and if you want to go we got five trips going this year and we'll talk business after church just get your checkbook ready now the reason that I even say that is because brother Bram told me if you ever get to go your Bible with a new book well sure enough and all those hundreds that have been with me in the last 37 trips their Bible has become a new book now if you don't love the Bible then save your money and go to the Disney World stay out of my face you just go spend it somewhere else but if you love the Bible it will be more to you it's okay to laugh in church then we're here to have a good time okay so but when when God you know spoke this curse and you capernum the worst of all of them and give him the big blast nothing happened life went on 60 years later when nobody was thinking the earthquake came all into the dread into the Sea of Galilee when brother bran had spoken choosing my bride in Los Angeles in 1965 mm-hmm you know all he said about that and here's 60 years later almost and big chunks are falling in but he said it's gonna be a piece three to four hundred miles wide that goes in their zone almost 1,500 miles long the whole coast slide in and Hollywood got such a an inspiration they made that film 2012 they did a pretty good job now after seeing that what you want to move over there and put your kids in school I don't think so I guess what I've been down that Coast there's about a dozen churches just like you they have a different revelation okay so why is this important to us over in 2018 because first Corinthians 10 all these things happen to them for examples and they're written for our admonition for us to learn from upon whom the ends of the world are come the ends of the world weren't coming on them they're coming on us we're the endtime generation see the end the end of the ages is at the door all the signs are pointing that way you see and so the world is falling apart now once again we have a message of warning before judgment okay and it's very simple message right to the point repent or perish with the unbelievers you have a choice you see and so you can choose so what we need is a shaking we need to shake off the shackles of sin this attitude of who cares of non concern we need a trimming off you see a cutting away of the lazy idle no interest attitude and all the idolatry right in our Bible it's always and watch out for a dollar tree you know and so it's very important now we're far beyond a pill or now Excel sir and you're gonna be okay and just come to church and pay your $2.00 and you know my way past that we need some serious surgery you see so we need the truth we cannot afford to go on play in church it's high time that we actively seek each one of us seek the presence of the Living God and bring our lives into line with the scripture which harmonizes perfectly with the message of the hour it's not like our friends in Salt Lake City that it's you know stuck on to the Bible there's doesn't harmonize with the scripture ours harmonizes that's why we don't just have the Bible and a bunch of books no our prophets message is simply the advanced of the scripture it's the amplified version of the scriptures very simple okay so we have to find our closet find our prayer time how we completes him and find his will for our individual lives now we expect brother Samuel to live that life wall just right straight can't drive a brand new car can't have nothing fancy because you know pastor and all that what about y'all we're in this together you know and so Hebrews 13:8 is for everybody not just the Prophet it's for everybody you see now in 1st John 4:20 says if a man says I love God and hates his brother he's a liar and we're all it's one time another been real good Liars for he that loveth not his brother whom he has seen how could he love God whom he's not seen so however we treat each other brother to brother Sister to Sister that's how we treat God see your brother in need well then you drop everything go help him you know just like it was your own son so that's the way we treat each other you see so he's watching our reaction to every test now God could solve all your problems before the Sun comes up put money in your bank account you know polish your car and all the things you need before the Sun comes up it expects you to put in your part and so he lets these tests go on and on because you got a lot more patience than I have so he lets these tests these trials go on you know in he's watching your reaction he's watching the reaction of all the other people you know he can solve it all but he's watching you for the reactions you see so Jonah is God's man of the hour back then okay he had a clear-cut decision from God a commandment from God go cry against their sin and their corruption I know all about the segregation and all about your fears and your doubts go any way God equips when he sends God provides when he sends you know and so back over here in Jonah chapter 1 verse 3 but Jonah he was human prophets or humans I can show you where our prophet says anointed prophets make wrong decisions as scary but they're humans ok but Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord and he went down to Joppa and he found his ship going to Tarshish so he paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord as he missed it the first time he had a plan God told him to do certain thing it's like here we are in Lorraine and so God says my son I want you to go to Indianapolis and take care of you know I rather he says once you go to Toronto go northeast go up there and preach against it so he comes out of the house the next day I thought nobody was looking and instead of going towards Toronto he goes towards Indianapolis 180 degrees opposite and it says right there in the Bible and thank God we have a Bible with all the details whatever to guess and says he he went down to the coast went down to the where the boats are and you had to find one going from the presence of the Lord president the Lord was obey him go my way go this is the will of God go here but he says no I think I'll go this way so I had to look for that boat that's going the wrong way it's on the coast of the Mediterranean Israel because you don't remember the globe it's got the Israel there and so he found the one going there he got down his pocket guys $10 if somebody gave him and he paid the fare and I didn't have his prophet coat on he looked like everybody else he was trying to hide he's trying to be mr. cool and get by like our brother Peter at that time now well going to this just for a minute Peter is with the Lord they're there they're at the Garden of Gethsemane or they're going there and Jesus says now has anybody got a weapon well yeah we got two swords done so we get there because jesus knew what was coming see and so they get over there and he's already told him look it's gonna get tough guys they're coming after me and this and this and this is gonna happen so they get there and here comes these guys with these torches and they had Judas with him now Jesus looked like everybody else they didn't know who he was which one is he other one I kiss so he goes through and gives Jesus a kiss on the cheek now they know who he is bought Peter unrepentant Peter the one that had the keys the one that done all these great miracles and all the things that happen with Peter now comes up with him gets that sword out whack it takes this guy's ear off right now the years sitting on the ground and they're all looking geez picks up the near but something they all should have been on their knees right then you are the son of God no life goes on they took him and they got him over there it's about six hundred yards over to Caiaphas his house and they got him over there in a dungeon now somehow Peter got it sorry self into the courtyard now he's over there and it's it's it's a still early spring it's kind of cool so they got a little fire going it wasn't his fire it's the enemy's fire he's warming his fisherman's hand there by the fire and so he's remember he's from up in the north the country they got another accent it's like when the Canadians come over here you know they speak different so so he's from up there and so when she came by serving the tea when he said thank you oh you're one of them never heard of him big old curse word came out because Jesus already told him that Peter it's gonna get bad and and you're gonna curse me three times before the Sun for the rooster crows me Lord I'm Peter I know that's the problem of your Peter your unrepented and when you get straightened out help the Brethren but in the meantime you might want to just keep it shut but he couldn't do that so he sneaks in there he tried to sneak in and look real cool like like Jonah yeah how'd you sneak in you know there's a brother story they told me once about a fella that had a we got a job way off someplace and so he had you know leave the church and go go on this job for three months and they were people were really praying for him because one of the poor brothers over there and no fellowship or nothing no tapes no nothing so when he came back they they said well how'd it go on oh well just fine no opposition nobody make fun of it oh no they never even know I was Christian imagine that so anyway here's brothers Jonah he's down here he pays the fare and and he gets on this boat and it's like a merchant boat were there taking Goods you know from from Israel over to Tarsus I got bananas and all kinds of stuff and so he's down there he goes down he goes to sleep you know well they start to have a big problem because this guy's you know he's we're not gonna say he's out of the little Lord but he's made some decisions here you see him and so he goes down through there and in verse three he went okay fled from the Lord but the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea now these guys if they knew there was a storm coming they wouldn't have took off you're a little smarter than that they're gonna stay until it's good weather well they take off now the big storm comes up and they start pitching the stuff off the boat because they don't want to sink and they they're praying to their gods no response whatsoever where is that tourists we let on here let's go find here maybe he know something well he got a finally got up there and oh well he knew what the problem was he said look guys I know what you can do if you'll just throw me overboard everything will be okay so the scripture says that God had this this special fish time we're not gonna give what it was but it was a big special fish and so the fish comes along he's thrown ride along the boat he's waiting so when they pitched Jonah out he barely got wet because he went right in right so now he's in the fish and it's looking pretty bad you know and he's down in this fish now he didn't break relationship with God he was still God's son he's still you know believer but he broke the fellowship just like happens in our life when we break fellowship whether it's with mom and dad whether it's whoever it hurts now you're still a son and then we're gonna go get you but it's not good you see and so here he is in this in this fish now the the fact is there's no surprises with God God knew or you're gonna be tonight he knew who's not gonna be here because he y'all made the right decision not to come hear me but to be insurance I mean fellowship hear the word other people we don't know who they are the empty seats never scare me I'm just wanting everybody that's here to get something to take home to see but some you know it's Friday 9:00 well you know we got to do this go do that got a caught a Costco and got to go eat and all this stuff you know they say we're having a recession sometimes but you try to get in restaurants on Friday night well anyway so you made the right decision now he's in this he's in this fish and the miracle is that he could live in the fish see that there was oxygen in the fish that he could live okay now he's got seaweed all around him he's up to his waist in fish vomit it's bad yeah yeah and of course she couldn't see a thing it's dark it's Blacky you know every place he put his hand it's that soft fish-belly you know and he couldn't quit breathing but you know he just had to put up with it you know when you go into a bad situation where poor things don't smell good you notice that after you're there for about an hour you don't smell it so he kind of got used to that now he got he learned to keep his mouth shut because you just don't taste it now he could hear he can hear the growling of the other fish stomach you know because the fish is on the bottom of the ocean there breasting so the stomach's are rolling and he's in there it was bad he had bad symptoms so when you think you got problems yeah how big are your problems anyway nothing compared to his are they some of them you got your own self into like he did but if you're God's child he will bring out okay okay so symptoms everywhere and he had plenty of time to reflect on his actions and his decision up here in verse three to go from the presence of the Lord he did that willingly he knew exactly he went 180 degrees opposite to where the Lord told him so he had time to think about it and the other thing is he didn't know how long this is going to be no nobody told him it's three days he probably thought this is it well I don't know it's gonna last but I hope I survive somehow but he's in this fish and so he closed his eyes you know and closed his mouth he said these symptoms are all lying Vanity's that'd be hard to do when it's so real you know so he was very much alive he could touch taste couldn't see get here he can smell and God supplied the oxygen now so he prayed very earnestly that's when you really get serious you know and this wasn't part of the bargain I mean that ten dollars I spent look what I got you know wasn't part of the bargain unforeseen circumstances I thought it would be different how many times we heard that amongst these followers well I thought it'd be different I thought the Lord would come by now I thought we don't care what you think let's go to the word you know and I've heard people according to my calculations I don't care about your calculations and I got this all figured out well guess what every time figured out come down the bottom zero because it doesn't work Solomon was smart enough to say it's all vanity forget it so the symptoms are very real but he had to ignore the the present reality and focus his mind on the Word of God that he had stored he didn't have an iPod didn't have a phone to call you know headquarters nothing what he had stored that's why it's important not that you listened to score me on the radio but get into your Bible and read two pages every day real simple everybody can do it you see and so he had this story and he didn't have a Bible didn't have any prophetic manuscripts no pictures nothing he got serious so in chapter 2 one through nine he's praying now we didn't know he didn't know was gonna be three days but he's praying very very earnestly now our prophet says the devils tremble when the weakest of saints go to their knees the one that repented last night when he kneels the devil start to tremble he says what a power and a privilege has been given to the Church of the Living God when you fall to your knees in prayer even the Devils tremble to the weakest of them think about it in another place and the weakest Christian here tonight can defeat Satan anywhere any place any time under any circumstances with thus saith the Lord you just believe it God said so that conquers everything you don't have any problems did anybody walk to church tonight no we all come in a nice car right it's got a heater it's got wipers you know so we don't have problems not compared to what he's going through so why is he in this situation well apparently okay apparently he shirked away he tried to evade his duty he ran from his responsibility he ran from the presence of God right there the scripture he ran from the will of God he opted for his own will our subject my will or God's will is the only fellowship was broken not the relationship so every one of you made a choice to come here today and of course in every group there's three kinds of believers now I don't know who the make believers are you know I don't know who each category when brother Branham preached the message three kinds of believers he could have had three colors hats here white yellow and red maybe and he could have said now you Deacon put these on on those guys and put these on those guys he could have done that because he knew who's who he had discernment I don't have that discernment no he simply preached the gospel and then he said no when you leave here your commentaries about this service will show which one you are so when you get over there drinking coffee tonight and you make comments about the song leader or about me and the pastor not having enough hair will know which one you are okay Lord helps okay so we're past the believers now he made a choice Jonah made a choice he's willing to pay the price and go another way he just didn't have any idea how high the price was gonna be and we get ourselves into situations sometimes we think well we'll do this and that who would price gets real big we should have gone the other way you know well anyway he chose to go in the opposite direction okay and he probably thought well you know there's probably all kinds of sinful people or in tarnishes and you know they're they're more like me and and I could preach them without any hassle without in our position and God would have blessed his word okay he always blesses the preaching of his word but obedience is far better than sacrifice and I'm sure you got testimonies we could be the rest of the night talking about that but you know we have right here in this within a 20 mile radius we've got Catholics we got Baptists we got charismatic got all kinds of people we got some people say they believe in Malachi 4 they never darken the doors of any Church you know and so we got these kind of people around they're using the same Bible and many are being blessed they're getting healed miracles everything because they believed approaching God God honors faith there's Catholic churches we can go to they've got a room the size of this church lined with crutches where they've been healed walked away they believe they're approaching God God honors faith brother Brennan says in thirsting for life and this great pillar of fire the angel of God the logos that went out of God that led the children of Israel through the wilderness when it came among the people it separate itself and great licks of fire began to come up on each one as the pillar fire began to break up God dividing himself among his people that ought to tear the heart out of anybody God tearing himself apart that he might divide himself a little bit to each one of us and we look at it as blessing but he says it ought to shake us you know he says can you see now why I am standing for the unity of every church ok comma starts to narrow down every full gospel church every believer so we can cut to the chase can you see why I'm standing for the unity of every believer we ought to be of one heart one mind one Accord no matter how much we differ in the scriptures it's going to happen or our favorite quotations or our hero preachers he says that might be say one might see it this way but that way has nothing to do with it but in principle we have to stand one great mighty army of God marching on not standing still not going around a circle of marching on because each one of you in your peculiar injury now you're looking at one person I'm looking at all of yous I see all the peculiarities you see so in our peculiarities as God has proved that is ignoring your doctrine hmm because he gave you the Holy Ghost in the Bible said he gave them the Holy Ghost of those that obeyed him it's an acts 5:32 now if I obeyed him in my peculiar way and you obeyed him in your peculiar way he gave us both the Holy Ghost we ought to be Christian brethren and sisters enough to arm up together that means lock arms march forward arm up together and March on for the gray purpose the gospel there's our orders right there now you're listening to the same tapes and everything the same Bible I have why can't we do that because we're listening to certain things see we've been taught wrong you know but unto us you see he's trusted and revealed the mysteries of the kingdom we're not just anybody you see God doesn't hold those people out there accountable for what he's holding you accountable God has trusted you with the secrets of his word the fullness of the revelation see so God has a perfect will and he has a permissive will for each of us okay he says over here in 1965 we try to work on God's permissive will and he will permit it but also if we take his permissive will though it's not right he will make his permissive will work out to glorify His perfect will but there will be a price see you go wrong little costly get back in another message this God changed his mind we must submit ourselves to his will and his word don't question it believe it don't try to find a way around it just take it the way it is so many wants to go around get some other way when you do you find yourself going on find God blessing but you're working in his permissive will and not in his divine perfect will so I travel a lot see a lot of churches a lot of people thought I'm similar to you and they always have questions people have lots of questions and you would think that after you know being in the message a while that they would be solved no they have questions don't tell about the church and Africa yesterday about the ring okay so people have questions so one of the questions how can I know the will of God for my life everybody under 30 wants to know the perfect will of God for their life you know well there's a real simple formula God's Word and God's Spirit and God's will always run in parallel they don't find each other they run in parallel they harmonize you know and so the word the will in the spirit they agree now some people have a portion of the word memorized to the very letter they have their favorite parts you know Jesus wept or whatever they'll memorize those favorite parts and to the letter but the wires are crossed and they display a contrary spirit you see and there's no harmony with the rest of the word they have bad fruits the results are contrary to the word in John 4 23 and 24 says God is seeking those that will serve and worship Him in spirit and in truth and that's why that we bring this little level here we'll see if we have a place to put it that we must have balance let you pull that's good that's good okay [Laughter] without balance you're gonna get fanatical you go one way or the other you must stay balanced okay now brother brown says overhearing questions and answers how do you feel it's a question how do you feel is the best way to find God's will the Lord's will in some important matters well that would be for everyone it will sort of have that question here's the answer I'll tell you dear friend the best way to find the will of God and some important matters is prayer oh we already knew that now watch it you need to get a spirit like naman real quick here now here's the way I do it okay pay attention I take it before the Lord and it's always been my strength I wait upon the Lord and see what he says and I just let myself be neutral to it don't take either side now that's very hard to do especially when boy sees girl and boy wants girl and that's not God's will eventually proves out right and that's why like I said last night and I repeat it again I'll say it again tomorrow probably there's worse things than going through life single look around a lot of them work fine like brother Samuel like myself a few others but some of them don't worked real good okay so you got to be neutral about these things what's God want so if I was in your place and didn't have these visions from the Lord yeah he had a bit of a handicap I would just wait upon the Lord and say Lord now you show me what's the decision to make and then the way you feel led to do it it's not the end of it the way you feel led to do it then wait just a little bit prayer and wait that's not the 21st century way is it then wait a little longer and see which way he leans which way the spirit goes now father in my heart you know it does not matter but I want to know what you want to do about it so there's the formula to find God's will prayer and wait it will work okay now with Jonah God did make his permissive will turn around to accomplish his perfect well okay the special fish delivered Jonah on the shore and we'll stop right there because you'll listen to tape you'll find out the brother Bram tells the story about the fact that the people in Nineveh worshipped as God of the sea the water and so forth of God Dagon and so here comes - here comes the fish and Jonah walks out on the tongue and they all were believed okay listen again he says I read that in a book if Jonah is is deposited right there on the shore by Nineveh then why does the word say over here in or is that verse 1 of 3 chapter 3 and the word of the Lord came again to Jonah the second time saying arise go to Nineveh that great city because he wasn't there yet now this all happened in the Mediterranean now for the fish to get to Nineveh go study your globe you have to go down all the way around Africa and come up here and go through the Straits of Hormuz and come up the river to Nineveh but it just can't happen in three days you don't care how special the fish is but the he's a saltwater fish no he was vomited out right there on the shore near where he got on okay so now we got this this mighty prophet and he's he's covered in vomit smells really bad now he's pitched that into the sand and now he's covered in sand he take your kids Beach and how did they get well imagine a wall with sticky vomit and now they're rolling in the sand he had to go to the car wash just to get cleaned off before he could even get the new clothes you know he was in a bad way and so it came to him the second time now you might not have the luxury of a second time that's not promised everybody be better if you made the first time they see you got to get into action the first time he reveals it to you not when you feel like it I mean grandma gives you the green light no now now a long time ago 1955 some of you might have a memory that long sure you don't but the film came out the 10 commandments 1955 and so some people had seen it they commented to brother Branham and he maybe I'll take the family to see it ok so they went to this theater there's almost sizes Church small theater and so they're sitting there and he's Sam and his wife and the two girls Joseph wasn't born yet so they're in this theater and watching the film and you know how that does the pillar fire comes rolling in he jumps up takes off his hat cuz it was perfectly right Wow Oh then he realized it's a film he sits back down ok so they watch the film for four hours now they're going home and so Rebecca she would be like nine years old the time she's crying she's very sensitive little girl and so he said well what's wrong honey you know we just saw this film yeah but dad did you notice when when Moses said all that's on the Lord's side come with me well some people came but she was looking at those people back there that was dilly-dallying around those people that was kind of an ounce if we go what do you think you know earth opened up swallow so she was worried about those people and the fact that God wasn't just you know and so he saw this as a teaching moment he said well let that be a lesson to you young lady when God shows you something you move now you don't wait around take a vote go and so that would have been better for Jonah right but Jonah got a second chance okay so he got cleaned up he went over went to you know we were supposed to go and chapter three verses five through ten records the reaction of the preaching of the word of God it was the greatest revival in recorded history yeah entire city 120,000 turned to God and stayed back the wrath of God they had a choice repent or perish with the unbelievers but guess what about 150 years later which is you know it's a blink of an eye on God's time 150 years later these people forgot about all that they entirely departed from God and forgot the mercy forgot the forgiveness of God and God permitted the babylonians to come into the year 621 BC and utterly destroy the city okay yeah and so devastating was the destruction that the ruins weren't even discovered till just a hundred years ago now I don't know what they used but somehow they obliterated Nineveh and they just found it you know 2500 years later in such a hatred to destroy now when when they had the problems in Jerusalem and the Romans came in and destroyed because Jesus had said simply one day there in Matthew 24 you know they're showing him the man look at this what these people have built it was the biggest beautiful most thing beautiful thing there was at that time it was beautiful temple Hall is quite rock and everything in Jesus it's gonna come to pass not one Rock left upon another he spoke it I had to come to pass so just a few years later here comes the Romans and the smallest building stone that they used over there was four tons so they destroyed and they pushed it all down and they're still in a pile therefore they left him so just that that urge to destroy hatred well even Scofield says here in the Bible such as the way of God light rejected brings destruction 19:56 brother ran said now America is going to decide this year and I think they're going to decide wrong 1956 here we are all this time later or seeing the effects they turned away from God look at it you go through the airport then really know what bathrooms are going to it's so simple they got one with pants and one with dresses so everybody pants can go in there or dress is going here don't work that way doesn't utter confusion because in 1964 brother Brent said if this goes on the way it is now in 50 years that's four years ago in 50 years it'll be total insanity so it's not gonna fix it's gonna get worse okay so everything is working right according to God's plan now Jonah was in fact a very crucial part of a larger picture okay we're not gonna throw rocks at him he was just part of a big picture see so much so that Jesus repeated it over in Matthew 12 so when you don't fully understand an issue whether it's in your family or in the church or in the message at large or with dr. you know mr. Trump or whoever leave it alone that doesn't need your opinions when you don't understand something that's going on be careful it could be part of a bigger picture and God allows certain scenes to play out and to bring our reactions to the surface you say be careful so God has not called me he's not caught a brother Samuel or anybody else to straighten all the items that we think are out of order no this thing's gonna work out and God's gonna judge those that didn't walk according to his word the others he'll take home your Oh simple now I would seen the gods man God's proffered the Aged God's anointed messenger it was seen that he was back slidden and stepped out of the will of God he would seem that way right and it would seem that way because we as mortals with our little canary brain you know all small creatures that we are we make judgments when we don't have all the facts you don't know what that person's going through you don't know why he stayed home from a service something's going on people need the love of God see not judgment see so we make these snap knee-jerk reactions with partial information and we get in trouble leave it alone we're not God we're not the managers of God's bride if you want to you know act all high and mighty well we could be fruit inspectors but even fruit inspectors don't throw it all the way they they okay we're gonna put this over here you know watch out you see so very few people from any given generation recognize the value of God's message of the hour see hindsight is much greater than looking in the future let's see now Simeon for example live near the temple and every time there was that day of dedication a baby she'd go out and look look and of course people made fun of him what's the old man looking for now you know and so but he was spirit led he knew what he was looking for him and he was one of the few that recognized what God was doing in present tense he didn't worry about all the other stuff just pleasing God you know now brother Brown says in questions and answers in 1957 a long time ago this city jeffersonville at the day of the judgement will answer great price some day where there have been hundreds and hundreds of outstanding healings done right here signs and wonders and the appearing of the angel down on the river and the papers blasted at forth and everything and still people don't believe why is it now someday I'm going to leave here I'm going he says I'm 48 years old now why didn't the world recognize that picture you know the halo why didn't they catch these other things right quick why don't they catch these other things why don't they catch these prophecies and things you know they can't do it now but one day I'm going to leave this world and when I leave they will recognize it some of you young people will realize that after I'm gone this day these things are fulfilled in the harvest time but why did the say what did the Luthor's do after the death of Martin Luther they met with Satan and made a denomination out of it and died she never done anything else she's become a mass of people to tapes you need to listen to soon the world falling apart and gotten simplicity from Albuquerque New Mexico April 63 he says you might not believe that but this is taped listen to it a few years from today if there is such a time then you will know whether it's true or not one day when the evening lights are breaking forth and it's too late then you'll say that man could have been right but it's too late then just exactly like Jesus said when he was here on earth he said God sent you prophets down through the ages every time the world system got out of order you know and what did you do with each one God sent the Prophet you all put him in the grave in other words you killed him and then in about another generation you wake up and realize that that was a prophet and then what did you do you garnish the tomb make it nice and verse sorry you make a tradition of his life now you want to talk about every word you want to say what he said I dare you and that's exactly what Israel had done Moses they made a tradition of his life tomorrow is Saturday it's sundown tonight their Sabbath starts so they're there they're getting ready to go to church tomorrow morning around the world and they've got a portion of Moses that they read all of them read the same portion on that Saturday see they made her tradition of his life that's the way they did with Martin Luther John Wesley and other men we are always looking back making a tradition of their life garnishing their tomb and their message was for another day by the time they were by the time you wake up the day's don't live by and we're in another day the whole system has worked that way for since the beginning man-made systems certainly so my question today well brother Rams his life be the exception it's not proven out that way is it he's proven to follow that same tradition so many people are just now realizing the value of the message we've had the warning so what you don't understand what you don't think is right leave it alone because you don't have all the facts be careful so Jonah was God's prophet but as a human he looked for the easy way see he looked for the way of no pressure all to agree with him pat him on the back and many kind of times God will he will show us his will he only didn't indicate it to us then we go discuss it with the relatives and what do you think and so can we get a vote on this and we'll get a consensus to see if people to agree with us we're looking for the easy way like Jonah brother Brent says you have to struggle to do the will of God sometimes so it's not always easy but it will produce the best results Cynthia there in okay got to keep my people and so today we have many message believers now I used to think that everybody carrying these little booklets was message believers no we got a lot of book carriers and amongst the book carriers there's some believers okay so we've got these book carriers that is willingly you know by their own self-will they're climbing onto boats headed for Tarsus now with Jonah it was 180 degrees but today it's only two degrees up look good sounds good a little bit rock and roll but that's okay you know and anyway we go then guess what when it's too late because when you start off two degrees off it starts going like this and way out here when it's too late well it looks like this ship of Zion but it's not no the rock and roll music got worse the preacher starts saying things not needing to tape anywhere nope no message not even in the Bible and you're it's too late because you're way over here and you can't get across to the right boat you got to come back where you started you see and that's happening something that looks similar but it's way off so may God help us to be aware be sure you know what you're doing see we can have a leading you can have a doctrine you promise out of the pages of the Bible but if it's not in the proper cease flowing in the economy and the plan of God for the hour you will be fighting the will of God you'll be fleeing from the presence the Living God thinking and believing that you're right but you'll be choosing your will and not God's will see not having rightly divided the word of truth and that's why we need Ephesians 4 because God put it in and nobody can take it out you see so there will be a price to play now in dark later to see how dark is it it's very dark a long time ago 1959 and to tell you this before dinner okay that's one second time here so a long time ago 1959 brother Brown was preaching in Puerto Rico Haiti and some of those islands okay yeah he was there twice in Puerto Rico but anyway he's down there to Caribbean and one of the Americans with him said that he spent four hours with him one day and he asked him why do you say so much about 1977 well the first clue is that we don't have all the tapes right because we don't hear much back then but he had said some things and so brother Brennan said well it's real simple because when I looked through the stream of time of course when he's looking three sees numbers you know he's seen time he said when I looked through the stream of time and it was in 1977 you've got so dark I didn't see any believer could live in that darkness beside says 18 years out there of course the Lord's coming now so nobody's making plans well guess what we're 41 years the other side now very dark see just because you've got a smartphone doesn't mean it's high time snow it's very dark okay so now we're going to read something here that's very important in Revelation chapter 4 1961 nowadays they're so they said well we don't believe in saying hell on the pulpit we need men of God men who won't be cold back now ever now everybody can't be a preacher but you've got a voice if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people a sermon that your sermon be lived it's the voice that that lived life that you have God let me through you that's the voice of God that will bring reproach to them who reject it just live your sermon you ladies with the long hair you don't have to say a word just go through the shopping center they'll be taking pictures of you there's a lady that you know well you know Mindy Mark's wife so we went to Israel and she's she's only 5 1 and her hair is 5 foot long you know her so we go to Israel and she does everything with her hair down she works in the garden everything okay so we're getting Israel and here's people taking pictures of the church and taking picture of that they see Mindy's gonna take picture her well she doesn't say a word now the people speak against it well it says right here that's not gonna go good for him but you just just living your message he says the preacher is called to preach his and live it to if you can't live it then stop preaching it well about that but you're supposed to live your sermons how we need in jeffersonville now this is a quote has been so misused how we needed jeffersonville thousands of lived voices in other words manifestations of the grace of God the Thunder of God thundering out against those who don't believe it my way the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness holiness purity undefiled lives walking around the earth without a blemish that's the thunder of God yes sir real Christians that's thundering is the enemy the devil doesn't care how loud you can holler the devil doesn't care how much you how you can jump or do all this stuff and what hurts the devil ah what's gonna hurt the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything you want to him call him anything he's just as sweet as can be moves right on that throws him that's the thunder that shakes the devil okay so if we turn our back on the word maybe not openly like you know Jonah but just through indifference through a bad attitude well I don't see it his way so we're gonna you know we're gonna change churches we're gonna we're gonna go over here goes man those guys just a bad attitude you know then we're fleeing from the presence of God and following an antichrist spirit and an antichrist doctrine sinking real deep and soon you will be anointed with arrogance selfishness self-righteousness respective persons none of which came from God so if we deviate one degree off sinner now how many of us like to hunt got some hunters right okay whew well I got a real hunter out west my son but you know if we deviate one degree off a true center it's just gonna get worse see and so one degree off center you're not going to hit the target and you don't have to be 180 degrees off like Jonah just a couple of degrees off and you're not gonna get there you see now you remember the story of Mary and Joseph they had been they lived in Nazareth they went down to Jerusalem for the Bar Mitzvah and the big thing you know Jesus was 12 years old so they're down there and it's a big family thing everybody comes around it's a big deal well now they're going home so they didn't have any Holiday Inn so they get to the end of the first day and they're going to camp out and do their thing with her family and Mary says Joseph where's the boy oh I don't know weren't you watching him and they had a little bit of an argument you know he's not with them they thought he was with him all day traveling and here's Suns going down and they can't find him well they can't travel in the dark so they got to go to bed well I'll guarantee you need to one of them slept very good because there's you know you know you've married people you think that it's 50/50 that's not true does that 50/50 business is that when you put your head on the pillow you got a wonder at all let's see did I win or did she win who won today no it's 80/20 you give 80% hoping she'll give you 20 and she does the same thing it'll work real good yeah okay so back to our story here so they left him behind well I guess he's down there well the next day and on the third day they found him where they left him so you can think that he's with you you think that you're right because your little doctrine fits these two verses but what about the rest of it is it flowing with the Word of God you know so be careful so brother Brent says it's possible today that good men find men walking with Christ reading his word still don't recognize that this is the hour that certain things of this Bible must be fulfilled it's the hour that we're living in the time is at hand when these things must be done it's written and thus it must be fulfilled because God promised it yes our eyes must be open to see the word he says the Pharisees had the word drawn out just exactly he had it down to the degree just perfectly the way the Messiah was coming they had to figured out they believed they were right and here he was born walked amongst them and they condemned him when he told him you all need to search the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they testify of me and they said us search the Scriptures Hey so-called prophet we got a paper on the wall since we graduated from such-and-such it says we got ten of them we have searched the scriptures we are Moses disciples you know he said if you were Moses disciples you would know me because Moses wrote about me and he did you know the Lord your God so reasonable profit like in the me lawgiver and so forth and a prophet and him the people shall hear see if they had known wouldn't if they would have known Moses writings they would have known him they thought they knew Moses writings but they didn't know it they were blind to the very fact so just a few words from him like that what do they do sprung up this man has got a devil comes to teach us what school to even come from and so forth you know but they failed to look and see that the very god that promised the word was vindicating it right there through the person of Jesus Christ for he was the light of the hour he was the light for the walk people to walk in and only the Word of God produces light only God's Word God's Word produces the sunshine God's Word produces the earth God's Word produces the air everything is the Word of God made manifest everything got a reality to it and when he was here he said I am God and besides me there's no other so we don't have to argue whether Jesus Christ was God or not he says it was you know so what I could say to you here in finishing look around be sensitive you know discern your surroundings be sure that you're balanced in spirit and in truth we got look I know a lady she's got so much truth she's way over here like this 20 years ago she told me I have heard everything William Brennan said eight times over and you just try to push that further the other way bad and then we have the rock and roll people all spirit and no truth we got to have balance very important so be sensitive check up our life our doctor and our experience has to match God's Word for the present hour now you can be an expert carpenter and build a big boat like that got down Cincinnati and so what we're not going out of here in a boat no you know it's got to be God's Word for the hour and we don't care about matching you know imagination and explanations we can't afford any longer to live in a glare live for today prepare for tomorrow we're on a journey we have a goal we're going to the resurrection we're just going around circles you know so we we have the same spirit of Malachi of the Malachi 4 people you know we got religious tourists accumulating the accumulating religious souvenirs I'm giving stuff away I don't want souvenirs you know and and we're at the point of burning candles now some people come from the Catholic Church right and you know good Catholics and they got those candles we got people today not way off today in I know in Peru and maybe a couple other places they've got candles burning too William branham's picture they come right around again where they come from it's pathetic idolatry flee idolatry and so these people don't have any relationship with Jesus Christ they don't know the word you see okay I am finished and got done one page he says here well that's the way it is today with people who call themselves Christians you say oh I belong to church that's good but you see the reason there is so much trouble in the church the reason there's so much confusion in the church so much discontentment in the church you'll ever see a church like that everything's smooth here it's not because Jesus is not there it's because Jesus can't get ain't gain access to the places he wants to go we have these little compartments oh no don't touch that you can come into my heart that's far enough I'll join Church otherwise let me run my own business Jesus wants to be the supreme ruler of your being and the only way that he can bless you is when he becomes your Lord Lord is rulership ownership who made you who has the right to replace in your heart the Creator to open your heart you know and right over here in Middletown Ohio he said and when Jesus comes in he wants to be welcomed just like we have the man at the door you want to be welcomed welcome here can we happen to help you find a seat he says but we've got little secret doors little bitty doors in our heart we don't want Jesus in over on the right hand side of the human heart after Jesus gets in is a little door called pride oh I'll receive him as Savior but don't tell me the way I have to dress and the way I have to do and if I have to let my hair grow or I have to stop smoking cigarettes or quitting going to the pool room or just add your big list of that you know he says don't worry he won't stay too long pride so if he's not Lord of all your being you know then he's not Lord at all because we're not seeming serving a God of commune of convenience he's seen and if he's calling you yield to him we can pray for you now we can pray for you tomorrow whatever but there comes a time in everyone's life when this F state Lord it's all yours I'm as far as I'm going it's all yours I'll put all my stuff away follow you word of god says but as it is written I have not seen ear has not heard neither has entered into the human heart the things that God has prepared for them to love him but God has revealed them to us by his Spirit he sent us a prophet he's revealed these things and we've got an errant language we can read it we can hear it we can see it yeah we've got this confusion because we're not lined up amen let's stand together thank you for your attention if he musicians would come would like to sing Jesus be the Lord of all Lord we thank you for your love to us we thank you for your word thank you for the patience of your people Lord to put up with me I pray that you'd bless them reward their sacrifice the Lord just help us together to live what we have we love you Lord we need you help us in Jesus name you know a long time ago there was a preacher in Italy called Francis of Assisi that's where Pope Francis got his name you know but Pope Randy principe of us East was a gospel preacher Catholics say belongs to them but you know brother Brent says the gospel preacher among other things he said preach always use words when necessary brother Brent said the same thing live your message because what happens today we're so smart Oh blah blah blah blah blah and eventually all that doesn't line up with our testimony so just save all that and just live it amen Jesus be the Lord [Music] Jesus be the Lord of all or Jesus be the Lord of all the kingdoms of my heart all together Jesus I surrender oh Jesus I surrender all oh Jesus I surrender all the kingdoms of my heart will Samuel Jesus be the lord of all lords o Jesus be the Lord of all the kingdoms of my heart Jesus I surrender Jesus I surrender all Jesus I surrender all Jesus I surrender all look dance of my heart Jesus be Jesus be the Lord of all Jesus be the Lord of all Jesus be the kingdoms of my heart you know I'm gonna share a little something with you that probably share you to the church here in the Lord willing week's coming but listen or early Monday morning I'm just listening just listening to the message the invasion of the United States and you you know as many of you if you've listened that message you find how that the Spirit of God is is speaking how things so subtly as as the Lord was speaking through his through brother George will enter in and brother BAM is identifying of how that Hollywood has become he said the place to where streams of demons are going out of there then brother Branham in the middle of that message he steps forward and once again these are things that I love within the message brother bream didn't try to act he didn't try to portray that he didn't deal with issues in his life but in the middle of that message brother Bram says I find myself going back to the hotel room and wondering in my mind how many people are in my meeting and brother bream said that's wrong he found that in his mind going on and he said that's wrong and then he goes on to talk about how things suddenly were being said that you know this particular man is the man of the hour brother Ram said there's no man of the hour except the Lord Jesus Christ then you find brother man unclear at the end of the message come back around in prayer the last few paragraphs he comes right back around and he says the Lord forgive me he said because where I'm at right now with that thinking of wondering how many people and Counting the numbers of my meeting he said I'm getting out of the way he said forgive me Lord Jesus you know what it was was pride we're all in Our Lives there's nothing that all of a sudden that once we've been born again all we're completely we're aware and we're not susceptible no there's two parts of us that are not born again there's two parts that have to constantly be brought in line with the word and one of the greatest men that lived Apostle Paul God saw that he needed help so God allowed a messenger of Satan to do what keep him in a place of humility aren't you thankful God knows friends he knows each and every one of us he knows our makeups he knows our dispositions as brother George was reading that quote tonight he knows our peculiarities God knows what we have need of he knows everything about our life the greatest thing we can do is search me Lord David David did not even put it to his ownself David just said search me Lord you try my heart Lord God see if there's any wicked way in me oh my aren't you thankful to the Lord that's what we want in this hour and that's what the presence of the Lord among us it's the greatest it's the greatest MRI it's a spiritual MRI as we're listening to the word if we're just listening to the word and it's something we're looking off right out there we're missing the desire of what the word is to do I don't know about you but when I read in the more I read the scriptures when I'm listening to the message I mean this I wanted to examine right here I wanted to examine my life because that message it came from me there's a lot of others but it came from me and as I'm listening I'm listening all my and you know what even after you're done listening with the message you know if it continues to resonate you might find yourself on the job putting a bolt on or maybe all of a sudden something comes together for a program or maybe you're putting a fitting on for a washer of a plumber all of a sudden something comes to you what it is the Spirit of God bringing back to your remembrance what he said that's his love and his care oh I'm so glad he didn't leave it to flesh to perfect but he himself is here present among us all glory be to God aren't you thankful for that tonight say Lord keep me ever true Lord God Lord God let lemon Jimmy check the side so let me check the wind beach let me check everything in the sites or God let me be sure Lord God I'm lined up I'm right on the way don't you loving hallelujah Amen let's sing that song keep me true Lord Jesus keep me true amen you appreciate the word of the Lord tonight amen [Applause] keep me true

the pillar up on you leading each and every day surely true all of the sin that Jesus is the only way without lunch there is no salvation without the spirit [Music] what we need is the pillar fire

[Music] within the hearts of man hallelu amen I just just really you know we think of the word of the Lord that's come forth no matter what need it is would be present in your life tonight he's already provided for that man for salvation for deliverance amen God's already made a way for the Holy Ghost God has made a way if there's anything that is lacking anything that you have need of God has already provided but now it comes to receive and to accept it to reach out and and take it and make it yours amen and say Lord I receive I receive Amen whatever the need is even what we mentioned here in that particular message invasion United States and we just say Lord Lord just search me lord I don't want to be off I don't want to be off even in my attitude I don't want to be off because to be off in my attitude is to skew me in other ways but Lord God keep me true in all parts amen hallelujah could we just pray Heavenly Father you know the needs Lord God that I write here Lord God among us Lord Lord in each of our hearts in each of our lives father God we would not want to set here Lord or stand and Lord in any way have a thought that as though we we are just fine we have need of nothing Oh God that's an attitude Lord of this age this time Lord God that it sits by Lord in the very personna it is I'm rich and I have need of nothing but Lord God we've stood we've said here Lord to hear your word tonight and you know each and every heart Lord and father we've not come here Lord God to hear Lord of our strengths but we've come here tonight Lord to hear of our weak points Lord that those things Lord might be Lord just further made known and in your presence Lord these things are brought to light Lord God and father we ask Lord God that for every need that's here Lord if there's one year tonight Lord that doesn't know you Lord God they've never surrendered their heart and their life to you fully I pray tonight Lord in your presence Lord that they would sense Lord God that father in your presence there is true safety Lord God and father Lord to wear that it's just a time of surrender Lord where they within their hearts Lord repenting Lord and saying Lord what would you have me to do next Lord what's the next step Lord father knowing that all of these things Lord it's it's laid out in the scripture Lord many times but maybe there's lives that are here tonight Lord that's never heard it Lord but father we see it clearly in your word as brother George referenced it tonight Lord do repent lord if it's Lord God it's not our about it's not about our tears it's a condition of the heart Lord God and father were a hardest turn Lord where you begin to deal with returning it Lord it's a heart you can speak to Lord and it will respond to you and father as that I floored will live Lord and and move on junction to another Lord repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of their sins and Lord the promise is Lord that we shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Lord that's your word Lord God and father Lord as we Lord come Lord as you as a mention here tonight Lord submissive to that word Lord it isn't about whether Lord that we understand it Lord the understanding is to recognize it's your word Lord and we surrender to that Lord and it's you that performs that word Lord there's not a person in here tonight Lord including myself that hasn't walked already Lord in the waters of baptism been filled with the Spirit of God that can look back Lord and when they Lord have been baptized that has more of a meaning Lord it is more precious tonight Lord than the very moment Lord God they first believe Lord Oh God for we see it to be amazing grace Lord God that is sought us out Lord Jesus and brought us to yourself Lord in everything Lord God how that we desire Lord searches out Lord God Oh Lord of David said search me Oh God try me Lord and see Lord if there be any wicked way in me Oh God we believe Lord Jesus that Lord God that father as your search is made in our life and we allow Lord we submit our lives Lord to be open that way then God you're able to show us even Lord what would be the smallest of detail but we can see as was said tonight a two-degree variance now ends up to be a great variance later on Lord Oh God granite tonight Lord may there not be one Lord here may there not be one Lord that would miss it what God may not want Lord God but may lord every heart Lord I pray father may each life may every individual Lord may we Lord God even from the closing of the service or

Alleluia well I don't know how brother George is supposed to go over to Toledo and be over there tomorrow night I don't know really how to pray I don't know whether I should pray that the snow they get all the snow that they need because if they get all the snow that they need then we're just gonna have church so you think it'd be alright if we prayed that way mris not here is she you know they'll have to make a call there tomorrow but let's just let's remember you know brother George and prayer and I think it's just it's wonderful to hear what the Lord is doing sometimes we don't see you know so much or maybe hears so much beyond what we would say maybe our walls but you know what the Spirit of the Lord is moving God's getting his people ready he's getting every every last one just even the testimonies brother Randy was share with me from India God's doing a work God's doing a work the main part of it sometimes were you know even as a person we may not go but it's like the example brother George referred to yesterday the brother branham referred to the success of his meetings he pulled back the curtain and he showed John Ryan laying on the ground praying I'll tell you what prayer I'll say it like this prayer is so underestimated but prayer is the greatest weapon that God has ever placed into the hands of mortal man you know brother branham play he told us he said prayer is the radarscreen sometimes we can't see and even sometimes how we feel but prayer shows up you know show things up it may not seem like an answers coming you might have prayed and prayed but it's not about how long who were talking to he hears us he hears us and to think about it that when you go to start talking everything else he hushes because he wants to hear from you because his blood has paid the price that we might have access to the throne of God hallelujah glory be to God even that he deals with our hearts to turn our hearts in that manner to begin to go to him in prayer he loves to hear from you just like when you get a text from your you know your buddy or somebody text you in something they're getting ready to say thing I'll Meyer your wife or your husband and maybe sometimes you don't want to get those texts but you get certain texts from people like oh my the Lord loves to get a text from you he loves to and he has a greater Facebook account he has your face in his book and there's post after post after post about you and I in this book of redemption and every once in a while one of those posts he performs a private chat I don't even know about Facebook but every once in a while he has a little private chat about this and letting you know this is what I thought about you this is how I feel about you don't you love him oh my just makes you want to just Lord God I want to love you more I want to serve you more I want to want to be more dedicated Lord in every way hey man god bless you tonight why don't you turn around shake hands with one anothers you're being dismissed in the name of the lord amen god bless you thank you for all even the visitors come god bless each and every one of you amen thank you for coming putting your lick of fire in here tonight amen [Music] Oh within I gave ray oh I [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
