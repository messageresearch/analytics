awesome thing awesome reality amen that all of our lives could be pledged to him that's my desire you know we many times in in school and when I was still teaching one of the latter schools that I was in the last one we would obviously we did that Pledge of Allegiance we did it each morning and then they would play a patriotic song that particular school I was at and I thought that was good but I think that um it's something that we are we're standing amen each and every moment and every day of our life to pledge allegiance to the lamb Amen to the word of God the Living Word of God that Lord everything within me let you be glorified if there's anything in me that prevents that hinders that Lord take it out of the way I don't want anything but some like him you're loving this morning man it's so good to be in the house of the Lord so good to be gathered together if we could let's just go to the Lord and a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord as we are just so thankful for your grace and your mercy once again Lord we certainly are are standing here Lord father in need of you Lord God you know each and every need that's gathered here Among Us Lord You're mindful father Lord we believe that God as we hear your Prophet say it over and over Lord in different places through the message that God you had him standing at the pulpit at that moment and Lord live setting in that particular seat at that time Lord we realize evens here as we're gathered In This Moment Lord this is a predestinated moment Lord a moment oh God that Lord as we stand here Lord sitting there Lord in the pews in those seeds now Lord we pray that God May everything in us in our lives be so brought into the divine order Lord of what you have purposed Lord for this moment o God for Lord each moment Lord there's the influence there's Direction Lord for God even right now we're in a vision that's taking place Lord where the vision of the word has been opened in this hour Lord and oh God we cannot put ourselves there We cannot put other people in places but God how that we need to just rely on you and your influence that where the glasses need to be on the bed the handkerchief there this person sitting in the rocking chair this one here Lord we're trusting in you God Lord Justice within that may every area of our life God be fitted in place and position for the vision is sure father we ask that you'll just Lord direct us this morning bless your children as we've gathered together Lord father you said where two or three are gathered together in my name there I'll be in their midst also Lord we're counting on that and we believe Lord Jesus that you're here with us Lord we just ask that Lord that even as the word is going forth that God you'll deliver Lord those that are held captive that God that you will fill with the Holy Spirit oh God the hungry hearts and refill us Lord Jesus with your spirit may this be a moment Lord of an acts 4 moment where the spirit of God we receive our fresh refilling of the Holy Spirit Lord may you heal the sick Lord I pray o God that are Among Us those Lord that are dealing with things physically Lord spiritually oh God you're the Lord that healeth all our diseases Lord may you just take control Lord we pray we just give ourselves to You Lord For Your Glory in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen God bless you if you'll turn with me to Second Corinthians chapter 5 and uh verse one we'd like to look there and I certainly want to say also I I heard that regarding brother Dave Kress and we certainly appreciate brother Dave Mr Shirley I love them very dearly and um just so thankful for the testimony amen throughout the years Amen to consistency the solidness and we know that that's something that God does you know as good as a person's DNA could be it's got to be something more than good DNA it takes the DNA of the Holy Ghost amen because there's nothing we can lay on ourselves it's it's the grace of God Amen and um I think of that just as I think of brother Dave and brother Dave Jr he tells this story where when they were attending the little church that my my dad was pastoring in Rockford down there and uh brother Dave Jr was you know taken downstairs to be corrected and so uh he was going to be spanked and so his brother Dave senior asked him said David do you have any words before I spake you he said oh I want the Rapture to come laughs I'm sure that we're all not too much different when tests or trials or things come you know we say Lord just give me the Rapture you know all these things that we go through it's just reminders this world's not our home amen so I I just I thought that was all right I think you've thought it to a number but every time you tell it I get a kick out of it oh my kids know how to apply apply the word don't they uh amen God bless you second Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 1. for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we groan in this Earthly house that we are in earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house that is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked because God's provided the necessary garment the wedding garment the robe of righteousness that is called the baptism of the Holy Ghost and so that's the Garment so that that garment is the is is the earnest that we have a body that is waiting there and not just way out there but right here right Among Us this it's a dimension that's moving even faster even right now amen so to think of this for we that are in this Tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be uncloged but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life now he that hath brought us for the South same thing as God who also hath given unto us the earnest that's the down payment of the spirit therefore we are always confident knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord now what brings that confidence because we've received the earnest and the earnest it gives us a confidence to walk in this life that while we're at home here in this body we are absent from the Lord for we walk by faith and not by sight amen I say God grant that in every aspect and every part of our life we are confident I say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord wherefore we labor that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him for we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ now that's not the white Throne it's the Judgment seat of Christ this is where rewards are handed out that everyone may receive the things done in his body according to what he hath done whether it be good or bad now I'm not doing things and I know as a Believer you're not doing things to say I wonder how many rewards I can accumulate over there but you what we do we do is unto the Lord the Bible said of what we do let's do it heartily right it's unto the Lord our desire is to please the Lord I'm not interested on how many accolades or rewards that we receive but there's one goal that we have and that's where we want to please the Lord if there's one thing about it when it comes down if I could just put it in this kind of perspective when it comes down to that day I would hate to stand there in that place and God stand there and say you wasted a lot of time on Earth you were so occupied with so many other things instead of being occupied with my will I don't want to stand there like that but rather I want to be able to stand there and say you know there might have been stumblings there might have been failings fallings but you were occupied with my will Amen to the desire that you had to please the serve to do this to reach out remember the Bible says that even a cold cup of water given to one in need is not forgotten is that right God help us to be to recognize those things like that amen because everything else of this earth when we pass on none of those other things that matters it's not going to matter when when the Rapture comes we're not going to receive rewards of I tell you they were always they were always working overtime at the job and they were always doing this we're not going to receive those rewards there'll be no rewards like that whatsoever but the rewards that God will be handing out at that moment Upon Our Lives will be that because of the spiritual working of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives I say God help me help us to evaluate everything every step in our lives knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men but we are made manifest unto God and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences amen may God bless you as you're being seated this morning so good to be with you I want to say that we just so appreciate your prayers as we were there in the the Youth Camp my mind's kind of spending a little bit right now I told my wife yesterday evening I said I'm just having to try to grip in my mind that just two weeks ago I was we were opening the camp there in Australia and then that we've already now completed the other part and I just want to say thank you for your prayers I know that I think those those services are online even from this past um week and I know I said I would get the link to you uh if you wanted to see that of Australia and then the Believers Youth Camp that's down there the service is just the brothers just did a wonderful job in the in just how God moving in such a wonderful way and I certainly I certainly believe with all my heart there were real experiences in both places so deliverances in both places and where Spirits had wanted to to come and take a hold of young people's lives and you can just see you can the full spectrum and you know Satan doesn't look around and say oh these are young people in the message I won't come against them but Satan comes against young people that are around the message he would love nothing more than to pull them away and I just say this just an admonition to us even as parents brother Brennan would talk about how that the things that are right around us he said on the newsstands and everything else and he says all all of this that's out there is set to poison the minds of our young people and we don't have to go out on a newsstand there's things right around us here and in our hands and so forth and there's a there's a lot that could be said about that but when I think about statements that brother Branham made in invasion of the United States and in perfect strength by Perfect weakness when brother random could say all he says the lid has been taken off of hell and he said demons are streaming out of Hollywood then he would say that all these are the lids taken off of hell and he said and demon powers are streaming in let me just say this there's there's not been even over the years when I've I've been there to work with young people one-on-one in a prayer line or in the uh in the midst of praying with other brothers or things that God has given in my heart why we've been praying for him that I can tell you there's been almost every Spirit that's been dealt with but you know God makes himself to be known that he's still the mighty conqueror and that every generation receives its visitation and I just say it in this way sometimes we look at things and say well I wonder how this happened I wonder how this happened because even some different ones that we we worked with a young person that was there in Australia that God broke a spirit that was upon that life that was with homosexuality and God broke that Spirit we begin to deal with that very thing that you that it's mindful of the things that we're looking at because this generation the world that we have out there is a world that is continuing to just bombard and what it wants to do is desensitize and tear down if brother Brown would remind us over and over and over and over in the scripture that what molded Abraham Lincoln's character was the books that he read so it's mindful of experiences and the things that we have and and I believe with all my heart when we look at many times this isn't in my notes but many times we look at things with depression and anxiety and things and we all can experience certain things to a degree at different times different Junctions seasons of our life things we go through but you know I think it's very very very very very uh crucial that we as parents you watch and make sure and don't just say well this is my son or this is my daughter they're a good person they're I there's a level of trust but there's also a part that God calls you and I as parents not to be naive I know that's pretty straight but I'm just letting you know we are stewards to watch over them to help them to guide them throughout this whole time and you know what that I'm glad that the holy spirit is mindful of that to lead us Amen in those things so I I'd like to just uh speak here this morning we spoke on the thought last week on passing through where the Lord just give that inspiration as I was sitting on the tarmac there in Brisbane wedding waiting to lift off and as I began to look and just just ponder over those things uh this thought began to strike me as I looked into the message of who is this Melchizedek and I want to speak on the thought of life in the bypass life in the bypass and perhaps the title itself will become a little bit more clear to you as we as we journey in this but you know God makes known in our lives that your life my life we're not here by mistake I don't know what you might have been told by your parents I don't know and I don't think that would ever be fitting for a parent to say that but I don't know what you have thought or what you've been told but let me just say this there's no one here by accident the the Avenue that we have may have come may not have been God's desired Avenue but nonetheless we're here and God God has a way to bring us to where our faith is centered upon the word of God so that there's nothing that you and I can even look at within ourselves and say well I've done this and I've done this and I've done that but it comes back to it's the foreknowledge of God God himself knew of each and every one of us and God God within himself he he desired to be a father and God had a family his his his his thoughts that he had and God there as as we recognize when we see it displayed through Abraham God's desire where Abraham would say Lord that there would be an heir of my house he was displaying God's desire for that of an heir and we recognize that the children of God that we were with God before the foundation of the world the scriptures that we could spend the just months of just elaborating just on script scriptures where we were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world and simply put like this even when I look and consider you know my boys as they were standing up here they were there within within my father and grandfather on doubt but there there was a designated time and a betting ground for them to come forth for Fellowship to take place and God himself is desired fellowship with those of his kind those of his children those of his offspring and so when we when we recognize that then then how brother Brown would bring this in it is very much so in the message of who is this Melchizedek and he's dealing with how that we and ourselves are attribute sons of almighty God and how that when we in ourselves when we we came here we came here as an attribute In the Flesh and he's bringing the difference of when Abraham remember God called upon Abraham him and when Abraham comes into the land God opens the land to him and then God himself he makes himself known to Abraham when all the rest of the kings are coming out and Abraham has went down there he's defeated the Kings he's rescued lot brought him back home and as he's coming back before he gets back home he meets Melchizedek to think all the rest of the kings are gathered in that moment in that time uh brother and sister I believe like this when we look at this that scripture speaks of where you and I are at in this moment because he met he met the very fullness of the word made flesh the very fullness the person of God now you know where he hadn't become Jesus yet but here is the person the word that is there meeting Abraham and Abraham's followed this voice he's following it's laid hold on his life and now as he stands there here in in the veiled in that form he begins to declare to Abraham who he is Abraham you're of the most high God let me just say it like this there is nothing else that can tell or declare to you who you really are outside of the word of God and it's the word made flesh just like when brother Brown would use that example over and over in the scripture about the ego flying over the Barnyard it would have done no good to send a picture of an eagle it would have done no good just to talk about an eagle but it was the eagle himself flying over and when the eagle flying over it was it brought an atmosphere it brought a creation oh and and that's why brother Ram says when you feel that tug of the spirit of God moving in your life he said that's the Forney for knowledge of God taking place within you he said it's something in you that you and yourself couldn't even desire to be in there but God had placed that there and now Mama Eagle comes over it's not the music that's making the atmosphere it's not even the forcefulness or lack of by the speaker it is God fulfilling his word that makes the atmosphere let there be light and there was light it scattered the darkness and the Rays of the s-u-n begin to warm and bring forth seeds that had already been planted and in this hour it is not the s-u-n upon our life but it is the s-o-n Upon Our Life the son of man signs shining in his strength in this hour to bring forth a bride in Harvest so here stands Melchizedek before Abraham and brother random would say it like this I I'll get to it in just a minute Brianna I just want to refer to a few places here he says brother REM says concerning where he was he said we bypass that sea he here he come from thought here to the word and straight to flesh and as brother man will go into this we bypassed that we came from attribute and we became flesh and then why in the flesh we now are formed to the word now notice the bypass doesn't mean that something's not there how many of you have ever I did I didn't get a chance to give it to him but how many of you know when you're driving on the road you come into a major city you can take a bypass right I think when you go to Columbus you come to the 270 bypass it is the bypass itself you can be straight on 71. you can go right through the heart of Columbus or any other City on that Interstate but then they provide and usually that uh oh my that bypass has three numbers on it because it's within that bypass is where three stages of Grace will come forth you see within that bypass there it's a it's something that represents even where we are at in our walk with God we we didn't come the direct route the the the direct line but there's a bypass we came from the attribute to become flesh and now from flesh now the word in US is pressing itself it's bringing this flesh this life in subjection to reflect and match the word of God what's happening it's life in the bypass but if it had not been from him for him you and I would not even be able to have life is that right we when we went home we would be in the same place that the Old Testament prophets were in and the rest that we're looking forward to this fulfillment of the word they were looking forward for one that could stand in the Gap and be able to put their hand on a holy God and a sinner and bring them back together you realize when the spirit of God as it comes down in our life you know when the blood has been shed it doesn't make a bridge it actually does away with the chasm so there's not a need for a bridge that's how powerful the blood of Jesus Christ is to go in and dismantle every hold in your life and let me just say it like this how does it do that by going in and changing your desire and changing your nature and then you would then through that God continues to move through your life and there's a development as a son and daughter of God in the image of almighty God it's life in the bypass now let me just say it like this he says brother Brown would say it like this I'm just going to I'm going to read this I don't have it for you up there brother Brahm said you come like Adam and like me you became from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted right you say well I don't want to be tempted well I don't think any of us like being tempted paid tempted tested but you remember the reason of attempting and testing let's just set this up clearly the reason of the tempting and testing is also because there's nothing goes in a Hall of Fame until it's past the Hall of critics and the tempting in the testing it only declares There's real substance there are you hearing me oh you know I I may stumble but there's something in you that raises you back up because the same God that's raised you up is the same God that's in you you can't keep Resurrection Life down is that right that's why even in the midst of your times of Gloom come on we all get it brother REM said when I get gloomy I read Romans 4 and I draw encouragement it matters what you do with your Gloom if you get on the Facebook and the Instagram and Snapchat and everything else and just let everybody know you're wowzy wowzy Woos that we're not we're not handling it the right way but as a son and daughter of God are you listening to me you are given Dominion to bring this life this life in subjection to the word and it's not about your feelings the word is true the word of God has never been defeated Satan wanted to talk Eve out of it and he did but when he came to the Lord Jesus the Lord Jesus was pulled with his hunger he was pulled to take the kingdoms without suffering is that right he was tempted in the in all points such as we are so he felt the Temptation he at those places he felt that pull that spiritual pull the Temptation that comes upon our life but he showed you and I not just showing us but restored to you and I that a son and daughter of God can stand on the word of God and let's put it out the prophets put it the prophet said he showed us that the weakest Christian that can take the word of God will defeat the Devil at any time the weakest Christian I kind of like that phrase the weakest Christian goes to his knees he said Satan begins to tremble why because my help coming from the Lord the Lord is the strength of my life in this bypass I need him every day Hallelujah and when this life is finished here if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where we go that is the word talking about that theophany that Tabernacle we go to then we can look back and see what we've done now we don't understand it we have never become the word we've just become the flesh man not the word he's talking about that body Romans chapter 8 verse 17 if children then heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together amen say God help me we're here to be we're here to be tempted to be tested this is all part of it brother Brown called it like this in the Hebrew series he said this Earth is The Proving Grounds you know the big naval ships they have a Proving Grounds off of New Jersey they prove them to see whether they're able to withstand the storms and whether they're seaworthy and so all the tests and trials and sometimes you might feel like I'm going completely this way and by the way every one of those naval ships battleships aircraft carriers are built with the same proportions as Noah's Ark that's true I'm not making that up there's the videos within it they discuss that inside of their of their of their navel and their and their tanks and everything you know why because the ark was Unsinkable let me just tell you something right now no weapon formed against you shall prosper you've been fearfully and wonderfully made you've not been made the pattern of a man or a church or a man's idea but you have been built after the pattern of your heavenly father and though there be times in your life where you rock to 90 degrees but there's something in you that brings you back up you might pitch this way but it brings you what back up what is that that is the working of the holy spirit in your life God cannot be defeated Verse 18 for I reckon I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us we got something to look forward to for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who subjected the same and hope so we have been brought we have been brought in subjection to vanity why because of the fall in the beginning God placed man on Fremont agency man to make a choice just like you and everybody else me we have a choice that we make is that right and here we are pleased here up in this life and let me just go say it like this I think when we take all of this life together I believe God has placed things in our life to enjoy Paul wrote to Timothy about that I believe we ought to enjoy our family I believe you all enjoy the things that God has given us because truly if God's given to us something then I believe we can really enjoy it because God gave it to us God didn't give us God don't give us things and we got to turn around and stress out about him that's called traps and we learn from them his grace comes to teach us God don't strike us off give us demerits and say you're going back to another great nope it's just a learning moment in our life it's part of a growing time but everything that God would bring along even our way it comes down to realize that even in those things that God's provided in this life we recognize these things it's vanity it's temporary is that right but there's something that is eternal and that's what we want to make sure that we're a part of and it's a part of us because this world itself gold and everything else it'll corrupt it'll rot it'll give away but there's a that within our life it don't matter how old you get it don't matter what tests or trial comes your way it doesn't matter how high the waves get there's something in you that's greater than you and it is God fulfilling his word in your life that's what makes a real Christian that's what a real Christian is a real Christian is not somebody who can stand outright in the waves but it's somebody that when the waves come and can rock you this way but there's something in you to bring you back upright why because there is a life inside of you it's life in the bypass oh my because the creature verse 28 itself also oh my the creature that's you and me that's the Son and Daughter of God shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption but the same I kind of like this guy well you know I like him when you know he obeys what I want him to do but but you know what I get that this thing still gets sick and because I'm in this right here I can still get down now the Son of God on the inside never gets down the daughter of God never gets down but right on here and in my human spirit I can get down I can worry you realize fear could come that's why listen that's why it's the need and thank God for perfect love to cast it out they cast it out when it comes cast it out putting it right back in its place right so all those things that we deal with and it's to remind you and I man if everything was good and Harmony lined up and everything just right I would get really comfortable here but God knows how to bring things to Brown about in our life to where we realize I want out of this pest house there's something better than this pastiles there's something that I I'm longing for there's something greater than just this life from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God now brother Branham picks us up now I'm ready to go here on this he says look he said this makes it very clear you'll never be the word unless you was a thought at the beginning that proves the predestination of God you can't be the word unless you're a thought you had to be in the thinking first so in order to stand Temptation you had to bypass the theophany you had to come down here in flesh to be symptomed symptomed by sin and then if you stand all the father have given me will come to me and I'll raise him up at the first day at the last day see you had to be first now watch my brother ramble put it he said see he come down talking about him the word he come down the regular line so what is the regular line from attribute before the foundation of the world his name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life then from that he become the word the theophany that could appear and disappear and then he became flesh and return back again and resurrected that same body in a glorified condition but you bypass the theophany and become a flesh man to be tempted by sin bypassed it now you know there's sometimes there's things we want to bypass you know when you take a bypass I know the bypass itself sometimes that bypass well not sometimes it is it's longer it's a journey you know if you look at her on the map or or you know you trust uh Miss Google or sister Siri sometimes you can look at it that's a shorter route straight through sure it is it's a shorter route it's a longer Journey but you see God in his infinite grace has come in this hour for you and I this is an hour of rapture this is an hour of change this is an hour where those that have read the promises our brothers and sisters down through time and let me tell you something they were excited about this promise that we just read here this morning if this Earthly house be dissolved we have one waiting they were excited about it it was inspiration that they locked onto they didn't know there was going to be Seven Ages but they were just locked into God at that moment and they were awaiting his coming why because the coming of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives puts us into the channel of waiting and expecting the coming of the Lord that's why we must first experience the coming of the Lord in the coming of the Holy Ghost within our lives is that right it then puts our expectations it then affects everything about our life yeah right it affects everything I mean you let a young man and a young lady start talking it starts affecting everything it starts affecting you know decisions and goals and it starts affecting everything and that's the same way when the spirit of God takes a hold of our life he changes on the inside our desire our nature is to yield to him and then as he's working in our lives molding is shaping us it's affecting everything in our life there's things that the holy spirit says no no no no no this is not going to work this is not part of who you are and the Holy Spirit bringing correction he's directing you and giving you Grace to lay that aside and he's dealing with you in this life what's he doing he is tutoring He is building you and I up in the image of the word people look at you and wonder why you're making the decisions that you're making it's because you've experienced life the loving kindness of God in the bypass one thing we don't want to bypass is the Holy Ghost we don't want to bypass anyone because if we bypass any part of God's word then we're not really in the bypass are you hearing me there's not one word of God you see this is why it becomes a very pardon me I don't know what other word to say a very ignorant statement to say well I've got the Holy Ghost but if you can't agree with every word of God now when I'm talking about agreement with every word of God that even when there can be challenges in your life you're still there's a spirit of God in your life because you're being molded and shaped and you can look at the word and say Amen so be it Lord it's not you're looking at the word and thinking well no I don't that that's not you know that's how they did we we've got the more updated version no there's you can't because remember there are three that agree none that agree in one and then there are three that are one that three are a man that is one the Father the word and the Holy Ghost that's directly from first John is that right this is why when we are baptized God revealed himself it is the father who was above us now he was with us in there of the sonship of Jesus Christ now that same God through the way that's been made now is in you and I it's the same God unfolding himself back down into our lives and as God unfolds himself it takes the quickening power of almighty God to break the seals off of our life and to begin unfold his plan in our life that's why the prophet could say The Secret Of Our Lives is now before us amen that's why the coming of the Seven Seals about it's the coming of the lord it's the fullness of his presence what was it to do there was nothing could break the seals off of your life outside of Christ himself why he knows you blessed be Abram of the most high God and he gives you what you need he gave me what I need bread and wine on the day of Pentecost he gave him what they needed bread and wine spirit and in truth amen what has he done he has broken of himself he has given of himself to you and I not something that is an option like an option on a car it's the necessity we need his life right we are our partakers of his flesh the word made flesh right we eat of the blood uh we eat of the Flesh and drink of the blood we are partakers of the word and the spirit amen and amen amen that's our diet our diet is in not man shall live on Spirit alone no sir but the spirit of God has come to make the word alive and the spirit of God inside of our lives in anoints it quickens and brings forth the Son of God and that Son of God Son of God and daughter of God on the inside there's an appetite that's been changed it's an appetite for the things of almighty God it's a desire for his word it's a desire to have here from him it's a desire to live for him why because your appetite has been changed by the coming of the Holy Ghost oh my word got life in the bypass oh my and you know what it will stay and step with him God will give us Grace to bypass a lot of Heartache is that right we're not going to bypass every test on every trial but there's things that if we'll just we'll submit to him and look to him God will give us Grace in this bypass now I'm just going to be honest with you right now I you know yes there's something in my heart desirable in every believer I want to be pleasing to the Lord I don't like making mistakes I don't like making mistakes I'm probably you know maybe I'm just going to let myself be a little bit transparent sometimes when a mistake has been made Lord have mercy on me and I feel like God I need a crane to pick me up I don't want to disappoint him I don't want to let him down I don't want to let his people down I'm not talking about compromising now you understand what I'm saying it's just something that grips your heart let me tell you something that didn't happen in your life before that didn't happen in your life before right I mean you could just you know chew the fat with anybody and cut everybody off and Buddy you just cut them off and you're ready to go cut somebody the next day you might see when God has has moved into your life you can't act that way no more that's how the world Acts that's why it's important we have life in the bypass and it will follow him he'll buy we'll bypass a lot of heartaches but let me just say this God ain't going to make we know this God ain't going to make every decision for us we can as being predestinated in the economy of God God will not make every decision and neither does that mean that every decision that we make is going to be of God and that's where it puts us in a place not of looseness but it should put us in a place not a fear either but looking to him Lord I need your leadership there are certain things I can see before me I may not see the Trap line I may not see the tripwire I may not see what's before me everything before me can look plain can look clearer but I don't want to walk by sight I want to walk by the influence of that other realm I want to walk by faith right hmm so we bypass the theophany become a flesh man to be tempted by sin and if this Earthly Tabernacles dissolved we already have one waiting and we have not yet those bodies but when this body received the spirit of God The Immortal Life inside of you it throws this body in subjection to God foreign there's new there's a new Administration that showed up one time there was Administration on the inside that enjoyed the things of the world it could the body would the body would handle things say things and do things wear things but you see what had to happen is you could you could change everything here on the outside and it's still not be lined up right but you see that's why that's why the new birth brings a new Administration on the inside right you know you could clean up a person's house and clean up their outside clean up their flower bed take care of all the weeds and everything else but if they're the ones that let it get like that in the first place it's only going to be a little bit of time and they're going to be right weeds in it again and everything and if they usually I don't want pigs in the front yard well guess what if if they've got all that those things there there's only one way it's not you removing them you got to change who's on the inside because whenever you get a change of who's in the house let me just say this at one point in time even within our lives here we were brother Brown describes it like this in 1965 a communion I'm just going to follow him uh you brother Ben talks about he walked upon a fire now where a fire had been burning and then he he recognized that after that fire had burned away all you see is the the the you know the chars of the wood and everything that's there and brother Brown said where there had been a fire but he said now when I see those Charles I walked up and I seen a plant that had begun to come through those chars brother Brown said see what it was he said down on the inside of me on the inside of you was another nature the whole time it was another seed that was there dead in sin and trespasses is that right a lot of things of the world over above but one day the spirit of God comes by our way and what does he do he doesn't worry about trying to clear away the charge of that fire he just brings forth the life that's beneath there you see God is not trying to clean you up out here and I'm going to do this to you do this to you friends you find that only works so far I believe that we preach the standard of the word I still believe the gospel I believe in a real closed line religion I believe there's something in you that comes out against the word of God and you say you've got the Holy Ghost and can still wear short britches and wear the things of this world then you don't have what you profess to have because the Holy Ghost is not something different from the word it's not the third person it's the same person of Jesus Christ the word may flesh in you because if that can be then you've got whatever's in you is disagreeing with the word and then you have God disagreeing with himself ma what kind of a condition do we got then we have a big old mess don't we but I'm thankful for clarity in this hour a path to Glory you shall surely find amen life in the bypass you shall see the evening light in this hour when light itself is grayish and you know not exactly black and not exactly like but it's grayish where people can only see enough just to join a church just to be a good enough person but there shall be light in the evening time that light has come for the Bride of Jesus Christ for a predestinated listen it's to all if all will receive it but God knows there's seed inside of these Earthen vessels Hallelujah and it throws this body into subjection he that's born of God does not commit sin he cannot sin now you know that word commit means desire right Satan can come upon you and tempt you and make you think that's your desire my mind explaining the healing of Jairus daughter I think 1954. brother said here he says here goes a woman walking down the street and he said here he said the enemy picks it up and it says it speaks to the flesh look at that woman he said then the flesh suggested the spirit you'd think come on flesh stop it right there but you see your flesh and your human spirit is not on God's side that's why you got to bring it subject to the word that's why you need a greater Authority because this guy right here let me tell you something this guy in this spirit will always take the easiest path of resistance he's a compromiser let's just put it this way this guy is an unbeliever your spirit is a make-believer but on the inside is a Believer three kinds of believers Hallelujah and the spirit will suggest it there to the soul and if the soul is good fed upon God filled with the spirit of God is feeding that white dog then there's a strength on the inside what is it to resist the enemy and he Shuffling from you is that right brother said he goes on in that same quote he said here's somebody comes and says look at this old guy he's singing Tunes going down the street he said in first thing comes it Whispers to the flesh get even with them yes sir brother Sammy I'll take right to Facebook get even with them then he said then he said the spirit Whispers that to the soul but he said when he gets back to the soul the soul said vengeance is mine it might be come on now our spirit can build a little bit upset [Music] oh brother Samuel not mine oh Lord have mercy we're dealing with a different Spirit there listen frenzy you we sense this I'm not I'm not saying these things just to put things out I'm saying it as he bring it to me this word inside of us throws the body in subjection the body wants to be pulled over a certain way sometimes we have feelings and let's just be honest we have had to ask forgiveness because we've acted on impulses from other Spirits instead of the Holy Ghost but at least you ask forgiveness and didn't say that's what they get because if that's your attitude you need a deeper work in your life not condemning you I'm just telling you there's a better way amen you don't know how I was treated when I was growing up but let me point you back to before the foundation in the world you know I I know anybody else no amount of counseling can undo all the hurt and everything that's come your way but there is something that is a healing bone and if you're in the holy spirit will bring healing to your life I don't care what you were told I don't care how people ran you down I don't care how they mistreated you all those things listen they're all real but I can tell you right now they're an amount of drugs they're in a psychologist a psychiatrist psychologist that can never bring the healing you need but the healing bomb there is healing in the name of Jesus airs for you oh man in this bypass there's healing you might be sitting here this morning and you can stand in your life and say I know what God has done in me but there's things you still struggle with in your life and God said let me be your healer let me manifest my healing power let me go down in your spirit where you're wounded where you bruise and let me bring healing in your life so I'm glad Jesus cares aren't you oh my it throws this body subject brother Ram goes on the next paragraph said you don't have to say oh if I could just quit drinking if I could just just get in Christ it's all gone because your body's subject to the spirit it's no more subject to the things of the world they're dead they are dead your sins are buried in baptism and you're a new creation in Christ and your body becoming subject to the spirit trying to live a right kind of life it's within you it's within you oh brother Samuel I'm doing a pretty good job no it's not you doing a pretty good job it's God it's God we're by the same thing I'm not where so and so is the new birth listen to me the new birth does not make everybody on the same plane spiritually are you hearing me it's just like for a young person receiving the Holy Ghost it does not all of a sudden make them act like a 47 year old man there's certain things about a 47 year old man that longs for his recliner after the service is over maybe a piece of something sweet later on tonight God help me stay away from that right now but there's certain parts of it whereas young person can come out of here and they think man you know after service they're going to be ready to play volleyball basketball or do this or do that but you see the holy spirit in our life it does not bring us completely into that place but there is a growing there is a developing there is a molding in our lives right what are we doing we're giving ourselves to the Lord oh my is that all right now notice here so when we look and we recognize this even within our life I I just gotta I just gotta move on here in First Peter chapter one verse 3 if we can skip down to there Paul writes even or Peter writes of this body Paul would write of the hope that lays before us blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptable and undefiled and that faith is not away reserved in heaven for you I mean this guy's corruptable right this guy itself I mean is susceptible to sickness this body is still sin this is not my inheritance this is an Earthly house just like I have this coat on I've got other coats that I could put on but this coat that we are wearing this Tabernacle how Paul would write of it this Earthly Tabernacle this terrestrial are you with me this terrestrial has borne the image of the Earthly but now Paul would write it's time for us to Bear the image of the heavenly see it's God pressing himself through in our lives it's God pressing it's the light that's pressing this is why when light comes in your life brother says like a little white button and it presses itself right it presses itself until the whole being is overtaken with life you take light like for example before we used to have these windows in here and I would come in here to pray it was dark during the daytime it was dark sometimes I'd have to walk up here or step in there get my eyes adjusted to it but you know what if I turned on a little my little flashlight on my phone that I had back then that light itself would go and it would move it would it would just start to move and make a way so I could see where to get to and that's just I know a very simple carnal example but the same and but in a much greater way when the Holy Ghost is coming to your life it's God pressing himself through in your life he's pressing himself well what's he doing when he's pressing himself he's saying lay this aside lay that aside lay this aside lay that aside why there's not enough room for everything if our character of the previous molding to continue and the spirit of God is there to mold our character to match his word that's life in the bypass look at verse 5. boy we could sing the song something keeps holding me who are kept by the power of God through faith let's say now I don't even feel like I have faith don't don't even confess that faith is not about your feeling faith is not a conscious thing okay Faith is a settled something but you can't even explain it it's just something you just you just share there's something within you it's not what you can explain you're kept by the power of power of God through faith I'm too look at this unto salvation not until the next meeting but unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time now this this journey that we're on it's a longer Journey but it's necessary to rejoin that route you know when we we drive 71 I personally myself this is just an opinion it's not the gospel but I don't like 71. if I can avoid that route I will I don't know what it is about it I guess it's just when you get past Columbus you're in no man's land and you better make sure you gassed up or you know where your horses are going to die um I'm the kind of guy I like seeing things on exits every once in a while but you know it's the truth I don't know what it is about it it has nothing to do so those have lived close to 71 had nothing to do with you it just I don't know what it is but sometimes we have to take it and so sometimes when you have to take 71 it's just like when we went over to Youth Camp I didn't have to take that but I had a bypass to go around the city of Fort Wayne and I I went around I went around that of Fort Wayne it's a longer Journey it takes a little bit longer but it joins me back up to the route that I'm on and you see we didn't have that choice on this bypass but in this life the whole purpose of this life is to preparation for the next life this life's really not about this life it's not it's not and so with that in mind this is why that brother Brandon let me just let me just kind of read this here if I could everybody okay let me read this this this statement this quote to you it's also out of who is this Melchizedek and he refers to that scripture of second Corinthians 5 1 if this Earthly body be dissolved this Earthly Tabernacle we have another one we have bypassed that to come straight from God the attribute to be flesh to be tempted and tested by sin like Adam did but when testing of his word is over let me pause here right now when testing of his word is over we are tested we're tested by and tempted by all things around us there's testings there's trines and there's Temptations is that right listen when the Holy Ghost has come it don't remove Temptation it just it brings the advantage the Holy Ghost to the Son and Daughter of God on the inside then you can say I am not alone I'm not alone he's with me there's a United he's holding my hand he's got a hold of me but then there's other times there's promises that we are looking for within anticipation and we're looking for him how many remember Joseph Joseph about a 17 year old boy he had that dream he had those dreams here he was years later before they came to pass and the Bible says in the Book of Psalms until the word of the Lord came to pass the word Tried Him what Tried Him the word you see listen even during this time during the word I want wonder how many times did Joseph and when he we don't we don't get this in the scripture I wonder how many times he cried himself to sleep I wonder how many times he wondered why did they hate me I wonder I wonder listen friends in his life laying there in those moments you know what all that was for it was working out not only all those complexes that had happened but brother Bram takes us in the message of prisoner it took an eagle out to show you and I in this hour there was a little bit of pride in Joseph's life God knows how to work everything out in our lives there's things I'm sure that you and I listen and listen I was be honest there's things I didn't see in Me God knew was in me but God don't all of a sudden take you and I and run us through a washer right away but it's little by little by little by little by little by little by little by little they did not take the land all in one day the promised land of the Holy Ghost is the land of overcoming sometimes you can look and think you think it was hard to overcome the bottle wait till God gets into your life in the midst of your life and then you realize overcoming that character overcoming Tendencies overcoming family strength oh ain't no ain't no family in here an angel no family in here the standard there's only one family that's a standard that's the family of God [Applause] is that right I might be the pastor but the Browning ain't the Browning family ain't the standard Jesus Christ is the standard because we are flawed and have just as much as the rest we need God's Amazing Grace just as much as everybody else we all have our ideas we've got our thoughts our opinions and even though they might be my opinions it don't make them truth or facts whoa that was free but it's the truth we all are in need of almighty God and the word is testing us the word is trying us I wonder how many times where Joseph is laying there and praying but the word is trying him you know what as many circumstances that came Joseph's Way you couldn't get that promise of God out of his heart and that's the same way it is with you you might get put over here or put over there or put over there but once you have met God let me just say it like this even before you meet God you can't get away from the calling of God and then when you met God you can't get away from it there is something that's there sure you might say when they put me in this department why are they moving here why did this happen or why did that happen sure we all have our grumblings because you know what this guy likes comfort if you could have a little meme about this guy don't make none but if you could have a little meme about this guy it would be like what they were doing to Moses with the fans bringing you sweet bringing you diet Sun Joys and and feeding you Chick-fil-A man everything would just be sent just perfect but that ain't way life is life ain't a picnic it's a Battleground and I tell you who we're fighting we're not just fighting the devil we're contending with our own selves yeah Hallelujah but Grace has been given in the bypass of this life than in the midst of these times listen there is something within you and I let me say what God's grace leads us to do guide to ourselves that's the grace of God I tell you if there's something that we can say Lord thank you this morning it's Grace To Die to myself Grace To Die to my will that's what brought the quickening power to you and I [Applause] Brenda can you go to paragraph 80 there please here we are formed to the word image to be a partaker of the word and feed on the word I know some of you you knew me from when I was just a small chubby boy now I'm a big chubby guy I didn't state that little guy back there right let me just tell you something brother Bram uses these words when you're born again from Heaven you're a spirit babe and he takes that terminology Spirit babe and who is this Melchizedek he works it through the message and he says it's just like a woman he said you can take a woman that can be the cruelest woman indifferent all those things he said but when she's expecting a baby and it gets close to that baby to be dropped to be delivered he said there's a Angelic spirit that moves up next God's permitted a spirit to be given he and he said that woman become so sweet and kind and tender Stay With Me Now and he says that's the same way it is just as the natural body is being formed he said when the angel of the Lord has come into your life now a spiritual body it's growing inside of you and what it is there's a body right there that theophany that word that's prepared to receive it why because you'll never be naked yeah he's just made a way oh my we were naked we were hiding we were running lord lord I can't stand in your presence but God became me that I might become him he said Samuel I know you want to stand in my presence but you can't but I made a way here take the Garment [Applause] of my word be clothed in the Garment of the innocency how can it be innocency because that seed on the inside was dead but when the spirit of God comes it's a new creation it raises it up on the inside there's no tied to the world no more sure we battle with this that we have greater is he that's within me and we can sing that song He abides he abides Hallelujah he abides in me oh my don't you love him let me read this here in Psalms 39 12. I love this David wrote this hear my prayer O Lord and give ear unto my cry hold not thy peace at my tears for I am a stranger with the and a Sojourner as all my fathers were another words Lord you're a stranger to this world and I'm a stranger with you what statement's saying I am a pilgrim and a stranger David had had contact with the other Realm and having that contact with God it brought him to awareness this world it's not my home I'm just passing through oh sure there's some things that David was passing through the duty-free shop that he couldn't go around and he had to pass through there's some things that David he made some mistakes there's some things that David collected but notice God didn't let him get by with it is that right God never said oh David you're my patent this and that but he did choose David because he said he's a man after my own heart why because when David would be confronted with the word of almighty God it might take the wisdom of God it would to break down David's reasoning is that right he got David to a place and he talked about that lamb being taken and David man his righteous individual God rose up David said where is that guy God said you the man you the man you hear it right there in David's heart see God's wisdom friends listen don't you see even within our lives it takes the wisdom of God you and I can make so many excuses about so many things but thanks be to God for the presence of God the wisdom of God what's he doing trying to draw us out because God wants your fellowship your fellowship if there's one request he had brother Ram said one request he had of the father before his departure let it be that where I am that they may be also he asked for our fellowship oh sure David he had to repent yeah there was trouble that came yeah that's exact sword would not depart from your house but David accepted the grace of God is that right now the Bible goes on to say ah my goodness can I have just a few more minutes I hate to ask that because I don't want you going to sleep on me not that you're going to but I believe the thought's already God you know in Hebrews 11. let me just drop it down like this without trying to to move through it the Bible says in Hebrews 11 14 for they that say such things that they're looking for another country declare plainly that they seek a country in other words what's he saying it shows in their life you see your actions show what's first in your life whatever you do it don't matter what we say that's why listen friends listen to me this is why it's important for us to say Lord are my actions telling a different story now listen that requires some hard listen that requires reflection that requires reflection and let me just tell you something varying a church member with enough courage to stand in the mirror of God's word that's being revealed and to let their life be examined but the spirit of God will give you and I Grace to realize God's not condemning us he's not here to hurt us he's not to beat us down but God wants to free you and I because he doesn't want us walking by our image that we've walked by he wants the Heavenly to be reflected through our life and so sometimes we've got to look in the mirror and say yep that needs to be trimmed off right there you're right Lord amen to that Lord let it be and you know what we walk away out of the house of God we don't forget what we've heard we begin to pray over those things Lord guide me and direct me because I know through my everyday life I don't want to give strength to that area in my life I want to live by the strength of God that's my confession the Lord is the strength of my life it's the Overcomer in me that manifests through my life greater is he that's in me it's an overcoming life I need his strength is that right oh my so notice if they have been mindful mindful meaning still having all that oh man of the country oh boy oh that country oh boy oh if they'd have still been mindful of that country from which they came out of they might have had opportunity to have returned but now they what's that word verse 16 but now they what desire sorry he wasn't up there they desire a better country that is and Heavenly that word desire means to stretch oneself out in order to touch or to grasp something to reach after or desire something so I ask you what are you willing to stretch yourself out for what are you stretching yourself out for what do you stretch yourself because so many times we all have heard this phrase boy I'll tell you what you're burning a candle on both ends maybe that's just Southern expression means pretty soon you're coming from both ends or you're spreading yourself out too thin that'll mean you're on Weight Watchers it means just simply you're you're committing to too many other things right and listen friends I understand the day that we live in I know I know we're living in a time where they're asking you know to make uh you know bricks without strong we've heard that phrase as well I realize that but I believe that God has entrusted you and me God has not trusted me to go around to everybody and and you know sit down and have an evaluation with everyone God doesn't God has not entrusted that the Holy Ghost is the one to lead the church but I believe as a son and daughter of God I think about how God would deal with our life and say Lord I believe I'm really mature real maturity is God being able to take his word and put it before us on us make the decision according to the word isn't that right when they called Rebecca they they called upon her that they were not in there praying and fasting Lord I pray Rebecca make the right decision oh dear God I pray she'll make the right decision no they had confidence in her character that had already been displayed at that moment so they could say call the damsel and ask her whatever she says inquire in her mouth I believe God is calling son Sons and Daughters of God in this hour to a real place of manifestation sometimes we look at manifestation I'm going to walk on the water and the six going to be healed and listen there's always been signs and wonders that accompanies the Believers is that right if it doesn't then we're not believers is that right but I believe one of the greatest man a part of that manifestation his sons and daughters of God being able to take the word and let the word examine our life and the word thou coming out of our life would be able to say the same thing that God is saying just like when Adam in the beginning could say elephant when God brought it before him horse when God brought it before him lying when God brought it before him I believe the characteristic within our hearts as manifested Sons and Daughters of God is to be able to recognize our heavenly father his desire and the characteristic he desires to manifest in our life and I'll tell you that ain't gonna be a name and claimant that ain't a name and claimant it requires dying it required coming out of a service it'll require not only in a service as God deals with our life however God deals with it but it will require continual dying what God has given to you and I and speaks to our hearts it is it is pertinent that you and I take it and pray over it and give ourselves to it this is why the desire you can always check what's going on by the desire that you have within your life and I want to just say it like this you know before I went to Australia you know you always want to make sure you're ready to go and uh before I left that Sunday we were setting out to eat over here the place I like to go to and uh my brother-in-law looks over at me and he says hey Sam he said do you you have to have a visa for Australia I said no I don't think so I knew I had to have one for Africa and I thought well you know Australia is not a third world country anything you know see my mind my reasoning so I'm sitting there and I look it up on my phone I remember what I got to eat that day but I never tasted a bit of it really felt like I got cheated that day because my stomach was just like in one way because I realized I had to have a Visa two days less than two days I was once again on a plane to go if you don't have it you're not getting in so they said you can get a Visa like this so I had sitting at the table I text brother Nathan Erickson but then he's like oh yeah I forgot to tell you about that somebody you are he's got a lot on his mind but you know so I didn't long story short I tried to get in through this particular way or you should you know push the hyperlink and get everything nothing I couldn't it said like they came up on their sorry for the inconvenience but for the time being I told my wife what does time being mean sorry that's just part of My Flesh coming out we're not spiritual about it it was just part of mine what does time being mean my wife started looking at it on the way home and off all the way from Avon all the way home finally coming in she said here so give me your phone she said somebody on here said there's an app you can download if you're having problems there so we download the app when we download the app I got in there and got my office and I had to you know do all this take a picture answer some questions needless to say when I push that button to submit then within just a few moments I was granted a Visa to enter wow now those visas just how it's set up there for Australia you can get those I don't know what they call me I came here with the acronym that they use but this is what I'm trying to say I thought I was all ready to go I had my ticket I had my ticket for months months brother Daniel name was planning on when I was going to arrive and all these things and things had been laid out for the services and I was wrestling in myself because I didn't know about that Visa how am I going to tell brother Daniel but you know what let's let me tell you something there was something within me and I say this to God's glory I didn't know how that even when there was some frustration wanting to creep up some anxiousness but yet deep within I said God you've got this that ain't from my glory friends I can't explain that you understand what I'm saying that you have something within there's a piece but yet on the outside you're filling this wanting to come and it's wanting to try to I said Lord I don't know how I didn't you know I didn't even want to go it wasn't my choice I prayed about this for months since last June but it just it just dropped but God Made A Way and I thought I was ready to go but you see how God that was gone I told my brother-in-law I said that was the Lord that told you to say that to me and you ask him in no doubt he didn't feel like he was in a spiritual moment with a chip and salsa in one hand nope but you see sometimes the things that what we don't even realize but it's to take heed to what's being said and that's why I even say to you this morning where are you at because brother Bram says when you got the passport that's where you believe but the Visa is the token passport is you believing I believe but the Visa is the token you have a guaranteed entrance into that other country and God has provided that and see that's why I look this is why when the scripture says let me read this here and close Philippians 3 20 our conversation is in heaven I know we've got an Earthly Constitution at least we have had we've got a conversation our conversation is in heaven when we're living from we're living from that inspiration from whence we also look for the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ so that's that's where I'm looking that's where we're looking who shall change our body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he was able even to subdue all things unto himself our conversation our Constitution our inspiration this is why we act different look different because the spirit of that land has moved in US it affects everything it affects everything around us and you know what happens you go into another Nation they have their ways they eat things some of you looking at me they have their ways they eat things it'd be like can you imagine if a nation they come over here and take over our nation Everything Changes your food starts changing diet starts changing right why it matters what kingdom is in control and whatever kingdom is in control that's what influences your diet listen the Bible's clear this thirst to satisfy the desires of the flesh but that on the inside wants to please God there is therefore now no condemnation to them who are in Christ who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit what is our desire to please him to serve him and that's why when there's anything that contradicts or conflicts with that right there that's why as a son and daughter of God it's to bring its subject to the life inside of you and God gives us Grace for that this is life in the bypass soon and very soon we'll go back home we're in a journey on the bypass but he made a way amen though we don't see all things yet though we and though we are still in this Earthly house but there's a groaning in here there's a desire in here that I know this world's not my home it's like when I was in Australia I knew I was only there for just a little bit of time I knew that Tuesday night came around I was closer to seeing my wife my kids getting back home oh I was just I was ready to get on the plane right then as soon as soon as that last service was on let's go I love those people over there precious people but I'm ready to get back home how much greater is that in our lives this is why the Holy Spirit moving Among Us draws Upon Our Hearts but friends let me just be very clear with you make sure you've got all the documents you need because nobody will be getting in there on just a passport on a good old boy there's hell that's filled with good people the Rich Young Ruler was a good guy good good guy good guy but it ain't our goodness he turned down eternal life a passport we need more than a passport we need a visa we need the token and through that token it gives us strength in our lives to submit ourselves to him let's bear our hands Heavenly Father we love you this morning Lord thank you Lord for life in the bypass Lord we did not come to you you came to us Lord Father Here We Are In This Moment in this journey oh God I pray May there not be one this is my request May or not be one of us Lord that would miss it Lord father we want to be where you are Lord I pray that God if there's one Lord here this morning that doesn't know you in that way God that's just wandering around in this life may they come to that realization this life is a bypass this life is an opportunity with a purpose that our lives might be surrendered to you that God you make us ready and you bring us into that place to serve your purpose help us Lord I pray in every step in every phase of the journey Lord that we might love you more Our Lives o God be further changed to match Lord your desire Lord as you've given Grace we ask that you'll continue to give Grace Lord in our lives Lord continue Lord to shape us and change us give us courage Lord when the word is speaking to Our Lives May we lord God recognize that lord it's your heart your desire that's calling to us and father I pray Lord we just want to surrender to you we love you and we thank you Father in Jesus precious name amen amen amen don't you love him you know I had a I had a place in here [Music] there was a scripture that I thought about quite often remember where Paul talks about pressing towards the mark I may remember that where Paul said I pressed towards the mark toward the high quality and I like the very next scripture Paul said let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded let us be minded to press and if anything be otherwise minded God shall reveal this even unto you in other words if something's out of line God will reveal it to us [Music] I've learned a long time ago there's things at times you might be able to see in this one or seeing that one and it comes down to our own lives even we need God to reveal it we need God to reveal our weaknesses we might say well I know my weaknesses but but see God knows every part about us and God even knows sometimes the things that we can absolutely think I'm hitting right on the line foreign and then there's things that God will let us know hey wait a minute you're not really pressing towards the mark you can put a lot of things that you press towards you know you could press your children to be great Scholars that'll fade nothing wrong with an education but brother Bram says if we don't lead them lead them to serve the Lord then we missed everything so if there's something we want to be pressing we want to give ourselves too because we all have so much stamina right we all have so much strength and energy and it gets less the older we get right if there's anything we want to do Lord I want my life to be in the Press towards things of God and if there's something I'm trusting in you Lord if there's something that's lined if my mind is any other way I'm trusting in you to reveal it brother Brown took an example in the message countdown I think it's tremendous the first time he preaches it and he's just he's just had that experience with the brown bear [Music] and brother Brahm tells it right there that morning program said c says I've learned that whatever God says will come to pass well the ram tells us he said at that moment he said what it was he said God did his part in bringing the brown bear but brother Branham was supposed to be in the vision with the young men brother Eddie in different ones this is what he goes in to say but because he was afraid of what the older ones would say he said I went with the older ones instead now to me these are examples that show God's Grace to You and I you can see it right there God's word is going to come to pass the brown bear was there and brother Brown brings this in the message the countdown picks it up that night and in his presence and this is where he calls out to the people he says he said would you pray with me he says all of us together he said let us lay aside every weight and sin that does so easily beset us he said God forgive me for being dilatory dilatory means kind of Lacks and brother Ram's talking about that because he allowed the pressures of the older men they weren't saying nothing to him it was a thought boy this could preach do you realize brother Branham made a decision not based on bud and the rest of them saying these young whippersnappers it was brother branham's imagination his thinking nobody said that see sometimes how we can get in our thinking well I think so and so I think this or I think and we make decisions and nobody said nothing well I kind of felt this like let's just be honest I want to stand with the example that Elijah stood in this day when he could stand before the whole congregation he says I think it's good to get everything out in the open confess it lay aside every weight every sin that does so easily beset us let's lay it aside otherwise otherwise minded let's lay it aside God if there's one thing let me be centered in the Press to that new home if there's anything let all let everything be centered if there's certain things I got to cut away and it's not me but Lord you've given me Grace to say I don't need that I don't need that I don't need that remember the baggage thing I told you last Sunday you come there and they're saying you want this you say I spent money on that you want it see the spirit of God when God's dealing with things in our life I want to be able to look at things and God can look down our life and he'll ask us hey you got a three-quarter bottle full of bitterness you want this you got a half a bottle full of [Music] unforgiveness you got a tube of malice you want that you want certain things that the character Behavior you want that no Lord just put it right there in the bleach I don't want it I don't want it going any further in this carry-on baggage just put it there because you know what you're bringing it to my attention I don't want it I didn't see it as bitterness I didn't see it as a tube of malice I thought it was a tube of Crest toothpaste but I realized wait a minute what this is I want my way to be unimpeded life in the bypass God gives us Grace [Music] Lord let everything be unpacked out of my life that's unlike you I want him to go through my bag don't you I don't want him I don't want to just to go through their machine but I want him to open it up because sometimes what they'll do they'll kick them bags over to the other thing and they'll open it up and start going through pulling this out pulling that out because why there's questionable things let me tell you something the spirit of God will never pull out something that is okay but I think we ought to be the kind of people that you know what let's let it all out if the spirit of God comes and he deals with these things in my life maybe it's something that's not even sin but it's becoming a hindrance to the spirit of God in our lives I want to be able to say just drop it right there Lord I don't want I don't need it I don't need it no more for my journey I don't need it life in the bypass I don't need and I believe God you give me Grace I will walk from here I will pray God help me give me Grace Lord God to never pick that thing back up out of the trash can again I don't want it in my life you accept that this morning it's really that simple let it be settled there in your heart and whatever it might be the same I don't feel no different don't just say Lord I commit it to you Lord the besetting sin the weight whatever it is I let it go Lord I let it go [Music] Hallelujah I wonder we couldn't stand and maybe got brother to brother sister to sister maybe husband and wife if you're not next somebody maybe you can move around and that's just my hands on one another let's just have prayer together God knows our needs and I want you to pray for that brother or sister you've got your hand on pray for the need that would be in their life maybe it's healing maybe it's Deliverance maybe it's the Holy Ghost maybe it's for their heart to be softened I don't know but God does just be obedient to the Lord Heavenly Father thank you Lord God for your mercy this morning Lord as we're standing as it were passing through the great MRI and x-ray machine of the word of God Lord we see even in our lives while in the bypass that Lord God things that maybe has hindered things that Lord Even in our walk in our journey with you things that we've carried Lord up to this point but Lord God your grace is here standing that we would not Lord God Walk any further with that bitterness that malice that lack of forgiveness Lord God we will not walk no more Lord with that lust Lord we will not walk anymore would that be setting sin or that way about our lives Lord God we would not walk walk anymore with our minds set toward other things Lord God but Lord would come back in harmony with the spirit of God to seek that country Lord God Lord
