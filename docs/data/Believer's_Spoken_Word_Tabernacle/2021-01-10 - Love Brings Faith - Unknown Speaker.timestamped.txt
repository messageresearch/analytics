[32:52] i'm forgiven because you
[32:56] were forsaken thank you jesus hallelujah
[33:00] i'm accepted
[33:03] cause you were
[33:11] [Music]
[33:22] amazing is how
[33:26] could it be
[33:30] that you my king would die
[33:33] [Music]
[33:36] amazing amazing love
[33:40] i know it's true
[33:46] it's my joy to honor
[33:49] you
[33:52] [Music]
[34:04] but if you wouldn't mind being seated
[34:06] again
[34:07] i really do i know you sometimes it
[34:10] might be harder for some joints to get
[34:11] up and down than other joints but
[34:13] i should have maybe communicated that to
[34:16] brother brian just
[34:18] they usually have you to stand up before
[34:20] i come up here or another minister
[34:22] and i just so appreciate that and we're
[34:25] just so thankful to
[34:26] to be in the house of the lord together
[34:29] and be thankful for what god has
[34:31] provided and
[34:32] seeing different ones and different
[34:34] faces and
[34:35] you know i tell you there's nothing like
[34:37] like coming together and seeing the body
[34:38] of jesus christ
[34:40] you know it's just something about it
[34:41] when you you see one another even when
[34:44] you
[34:45] may not even be in church but you just
[34:47] see one another and it's just something
[34:49] that just
[34:49] it just strikes you you know sometimes
[34:52] it like i said it not even on
[34:54] a church day or you're not even here it
[34:55] might just be out here
[34:57] in the parking lot or some other place a
[34:59] store or a restaurant or it just
[35:01] it's just something it's just like
[35:02] refreshing amen just to be able to see
[35:05] one another and
[35:06] i'm thankful that there's a there's a
[35:09] reality that burns in our heart that
[35:11] we're part of the family of god amen
[35:14] it's it's greater than than this of the
[35:16] earth and
[35:17] the tie of the earth has has lost its
[35:19] hold
[35:20] amen we might be held down here by
[35:22] gravity right now but we're no longer
[35:24] held by sin
[35:25] amen we've been delivered by the grace
[35:28] of god
[35:29] just something about it that just to be
[35:31] a part of the family of god
[35:33] amen as brother branham would put it so
[35:35] clearly and
[35:36] in the message and he would say that
[35:38] when we come together he said what it is
[35:40] it is the fellowship
[35:41] of the attributes of god you've never
[35:44] really seen me
[35:45] all you see is the expression of the
[35:47] attribute of the son of god
[35:49] on the inside and we come together and
[35:52] he said so actually what it is he said
[35:53] it's the
[35:54] attributes we fellowship in the spirit
[35:57] of god
[35:58] amen that's that's a precious precious
[36:01] place that we have been called to
[36:03] in heavenly places and um we just thank
[36:06] god for that
[36:07] i want to just mention to you i felt
[36:10] that we i needed to do this
[36:12] um on behalf on just some things that
[36:15] are taking place here
[36:16] in the local assembly and i i would say
[36:19] that
[36:19] uh perhaps that many of you have noticed
[36:22] that there's different
[36:24] changes that are taking place within the
[36:26] building
[36:27] um there's some changes that have
[36:30] actually happened months ago that
[36:32] you you wouldn't even be aware of i kind
[36:34] of alluded to it
[36:35] a little bit ago on the baptismal
[36:38] service a few weeks ago but
[36:40] you wouldn't have even been aware of
[36:41] those changes uh
[36:43] if i hadn't mentioned it but because
[36:45] it's behind closed doors right back in
[36:47] that closet back there
[36:48] there is the uh there was we had a water
[36:51] heater there and then we also had a tank
[36:53] that heated this
[36:55] baptistery up here uh in other words so
[36:58] that when we came time to baptize they
[37:00] could
[37:01] have that heater going and it would take
[37:03] the water cycle it from here
[37:04] pass it back there cycle it back up and
[37:08] all of that was going on and we
[37:10] inherited that with the building so we
[37:13] you know
[37:14] we used it and brothers worked on it
[37:17] brother carlos took it a few years ago
[37:19] and just took it apart and
[37:20] filed the burner down and everything's
[37:22] because
[37:24] if you don't know it this is cold
[37:26] sometimes
[37:28] when you go to get in there to baptize
[37:29] now i i can take it up here
[37:32] but i've got to put people down in that
[37:35] and sometimes this is all suspended up
[37:37] and you know how it is in a crawl space
[37:39] it's it's just
[37:40] suspended up a big cement uh part down
[37:42] there but
[37:43] at any rate we we we replaced that it
[37:46] wasn't something we had a choice of any
[37:48] longer
[37:49] that heater went out and so what was
[37:52] done
[37:53] uh we we put in one of those on demand
[37:56] it's a pretty large one a commercial
[37:58] size one is that right brother carlos
[38:01] is it is it regular one okay
[38:05] it fits our needs and it's so we we have
[38:08] been looking at that for some years and
[38:10] we went ahead and did that
[38:12] so that right from back there not only
[38:15] did we replace the water heater there we
[38:17] also were able to take and replace that
[38:19] baptismal tank those are two things that
[38:22] constantly going even when we weren't
[38:24] here and we took
[38:26] that and brother richard and brother
[38:28] carlos worked on that and
[38:30] they not only replaced that but then
[38:32] they
[38:33] fixed it so that all we have to do is we
[38:36] pull a lever back there
[38:38] and we can send warm water hot water in
[38:41] here
[38:41] and then when it gets close to the time
[38:43] for the baptismal service they can kick
[38:45] it back
[38:46] on again and more water comes out the
[38:47] side you might say how was it done in
[38:49] the past
[38:51] well aside from running to the well with
[38:53] buckets
[38:55] we had a hose sitting under the floor
[38:57] where brother tommy's at you pull the
[38:58] garden hose out fill it up and then we
[39:00] had a
[39:00] a heater tank in the back that that was
[39:03] what was here
[39:04] when we got here in this church and and
[39:07] the lord blessed us with the building in
[39:09] 1997
[39:10] and so we are thankful that god has has
[39:14] worked it out that we were able to
[39:16] replace that and i thank god for the
[39:18] brothers you know
[39:19] we've we've never had to up to this
[39:22] point
[39:22] uh to to ask well i think one time we
[39:25] actually paid for some outside
[39:27] individuals to come in and do some of
[39:28] the drywall in the upstairs but
[39:31] other than that the brothers have have
[39:33] all done it and there's different
[39:35] brothers have different trades and
[39:37] different backgrounds and things
[39:39] and some of them just have the knowledge
[39:41] they just know what to do
[39:43] so we thank god for that because that
[39:44] certainly has saved the church
[39:47] a lot of money and yet if we had to get
[39:50] somebody you know i don't believe in
[39:52] cutting anybody i want to pay them
[39:54] because that that to me is a valuable
[39:55] skill
[39:56] if somebody can do drywall or lay
[39:58] flooring that to me is an art that's
[40:00] that's a gift and i that's how i've
[40:02] looked at it always even painting
[40:04] uh all of those things it just to me is
[40:06] a real gift and a real trade
[40:08] and so i want to say we we appreciate
[40:11] that you wouldn't even know about that
[40:12] if i hadn't
[40:13] we hadn't mentioned that but i wanted
[40:15] you to know about it because those are
[40:16] things that are taking place
[40:18] behind the scenes to make this uh this a
[40:21] little bit a little bit better
[40:23] some of the other changes that you've
[40:24] noticed is
[40:26] the lighting in the sanctuary and
[40:29] that lighting project this all came
[40:31] about
[40:33] because there was a need for more
[40:36] of ceiling fans to be placed in in order
[40:39] to really aid
[40:40] the air conditioning time during the
[40:43] summer months
[40:45] that was not something that the brothers
[40:47] came up with
[40:48] but it was what was recommended
[40:50] countless times through different
[40:52] heating and air conditioning men
[40:53] who came in and even when we had
[40:56] was it two years ago the the furnace
[41:00] and a new air conditioning unit put in
[41:02] for this part of the building
[41:04] three years ago soon before we had a new
[41:07] furnace and an air conditioning unit put
[41:09] for the back of the building and
[41:10] how many appreciate that air
[41:12] conditioning in the back of the building
[41:14] well i'll tell you i do when i'm in my
[41:15] office
[41:17] you know but i i really you know even in
[41:20] the latter parts i
[41:21] told the brothers don't even put one in
[41:22] my window and just make sure the
[41:24] nursery's taken care of so that
[41:26] they're comfortable in there with the
[41:27] babies and but i'm thankful that we are
[41:29] able to do that because it benefits
[41:31] uh it benefits here the building and
[41:33] benefits everyone but
[41:35] the lighting that all came about because
[41:37] there had there was a
[41:38] uh redoing of these um ceiling fans and
[41:41] trying to make these
[41:42] the air uh circulate a little bit better
[41:45] especially during the warmer months and
[41:46] we
[41:47] i tell you with the lighting let me just
[41:49] tell you how the lighting came about
[41:52] brother carlos's son victor god's
[41:54] dealing with him
[41:55] amen i can tell you that
[41:59] but he victor came victor even back
[42:01] there all those cam lights i'd have
[42:03] never asked anybody to put can lights in
[42:05] back there
[42:06] but he came and he said you all need cam
[42:09] lights back there and he said that's
[42:10] what we're going to do
[42:12] then when he came in here he got to
[42:14] looking at this everything
[42:16] and he said this is what we need to do
[42:18] he came in
[42:19] he measured this out then he came back
[42:21] over measured it again and
[42:23] i happened to come in the one day and
[42:26] everything was
[42:27] he took it personal he took it in a
[42:29] manner that this
[42:30] he wanted this to be done in a way that
[42:33] that was very very good
[42:35] and so even to where the blades would
[42:36] not hinder with the with the lights and
[42:38] things and i
[42:39] i just um i was just looking at that and
[42:43] you know victor started in with it uh
[42:45] and brother richard and brother carlos
[42:46] were here and
[42:48] you didn't see it i think didn't it
[42:49] start on on
[42:51] thanksgiving week wasn't that the first
[42:54] week
[42:54] that's when all these different holes
[42:56] were were
[42:58] were up here you know and so that all
[43:01] started you come i come in here and
[43:02] these and these brothers i walked in the
[43:04] one day
[43:05] and they're i got pictures of them
[43:06] they're up here on these
[43:08] on these platforms super high you know
[43:11] you walk in and they're taking a router
[43:13] and they
[43:14] had a template made out and a gentleman
[43:16] allowed us to borrow the
[43:17] the um the router and they're up there
[43:20] and i'll tell you they were a mess
[43:22] they were they were a mess and brother
[43:25] richard and brother carlos and
[43:26] and victor victor did a lot of these
[43:28] holes here and appear
[43:30] this part up here on the platform
[43:32] brother richard and brother
[43:34] carlos they uh they they just took over
[43:37] on that and started working on that
[43:39] completing and it's been one of those
[43:40] things we've just had to look at and go
[43:42] along and
[43:43] the part with the lighting you know
[43:46] sometimes i know sometimes we can look
[43:49] at it and say well why did you need to
[43:50] improve the lighting
[43:52] well let me ask you something do you get
[43:54] new furniture at your house
[43:57] i mean these are things that you buy
[43:59] maybe like you they see a new chair
[44:01] well this is the house of god
[44:05] you see there's a lot of things that can
[44:06] actually show what we what we think
[44:09] right now when we look here in this
[44:10] house
[44:12] we this is something we understand it's
[44:14] not about the brick and mortar but
[44:16] we we want to make it look nice
[44:20] we want to make it comfortable not
[44:21] extravagant but everything that's been
[44:24] done i can tell you from the lights and
[44:25] the things that's been done even from
[44:27] what we talked about earlier with that
[44:29] water heater and then even replacing the
[44:30] furnace everything
[44:32] that has been done it's been done with
[44:34] this thought let's make it
[44:36] more efficient so even when
[44:40] so that the the operating cost that
[44:42] those would start to go down so it
[44:44] becomes more efficient let's
[44:46] make it in that way and i think god that
[44:48] god has has allowed
[44:50] us to be able to to do those things and
[44:53] so we
[44:53] i tell you how many appreciate the the
[44:56] the lights
[44:58] i tell you i really appreciate that
[45:03] now for those of you that don't know it
[45:05] and and i never complained about it but
[45:07] this whole area
[45:09] you couldn't read a bible up here i
[45:10] don't know how the song leaders read
[45:12] read the prayer requests see i i preach
[45:15] with my ipad
[45:16] so i've got the light i can increase
[45:18] it's got its backlit
[45:19] so if you if you notice remember when
[45:21] brother john lafontaine was here the
[45:23] past few times when he preached
[45:25] and they had to bring that light from
[45:26] over there and put it here the reality
[45:28] is is that you couldn't you definitely
[45:31] couldn't read your bible because your
[45:32] bible's not really
[45:33] white white paper and there was a time
[45:36] up here that i
[45:36] i had i read this i read a scripture i
[45:38] didn't have it in my notes and i had to
[45:40] step out here and try to find a place
[45:42] where light was coming out so i could
[45:44] try to read
[45:45] the bible now like i said i had an ipad
[45:49] but brother john lafontaine remember
[45:50] what he said when he was here
[45:52] he said the trustees you need to get
[45:54] together
[45:56] he said we need to get these this is the
[45:58] and it was this was the darkest spot
[46:00] in this whole uh place we had a
[46:03] gentleman that
[46:04] we didn't ask him to come in didn't even
[46:06] know anything about him but he was here
[46:07] in one of the meetings
[46:09] and that brother does these things for a
[46:10] living and he said brother samuel can i
[46:12] speak to you a moment and he
[46:13] said the darkest spot in your building
[46:16] is
[46:16] your pulpit particularly your podium
[46:19] area
[46:20] and so you know what we've tried to do
[46:23] with the lighting is try
[46:24] to do everything that we can to make it
[46:26] a better um
[46:29] better and then also better quality for
[46:31] for video and
[46:32] streaming the archives and and all those
[46:35] things right there
[46:36] because we know that eventually the lord
[46:39] willing we'd like to replace
[46:40] the cameras and bring those things a
[46:42] little bit more you know
[46:44] up to date and i know some of you said
[46:45] hey brother samuel can you get rid of
[46:47] that bar on the side of the screen
[46:49] well brother bran brought my brother
[46:50] branham
[46:52] i feel like i'm getting ready to preach
[46:54] but brother brian brother brian put that
[46:56] bar in there because if brother brian
[46:57] didn't put that bar in there
[46:58] all it is is a four by three it's a
[47:01] standard screen you'd have black on
[47:02] either side so
[47:03] he just put that in there move that over
[47:05] so if you move that bar you don't see
[47:07] nothing
[47:08] but you know to the thing is we we knew
[47:11] that
[47:12] you you get a better camera but all the
[47:14] better cram the camera is going to do
[47:16] as many of the professionals and
[47:18] different ones have said it just shows
[47:19] up your
[47:20] your need for better lighting so we we
[47:23] recognize that something that is
[47:24] that is that is coming and and the light
[47:26] it seemed to be more a little bit more
[47:28] uh concentrated and so uh now with all
[47:32] these things
[47:33] changes and different changes in the
[47:34] past that has taken place like
[47:36] all of that back there that was done in
[47:39] the back of the church right there all
[47:41] of that was done
[47:42] all of that there was not one time even
[47:45] a special offering
[47:46] that was lifted for all of that in the
[47:49] back of the church and sometimes i
[47:51] realize that
[47:52] we we might look at and say well things
[47:54] are just happening but
[47:55] you know just to encourage you that um
[47:58] we're there there's not a money tree
[48:00] around here
[48:02] so you don't shake it in money and money
[48:03] just you know falls off you know my
[48:06] my mom my dad used to tell me i'd say
[48:08] hey mom i'd like to have this she said
[48:09] well money don't grow on trees
[48:12] and so i i you know we've never lifted a
[48:15] special offering at any time and i i'll
[48:17] take
[48:18] you know when we look at that i think
[48:20] there's times that we
[48:21] we should do that and perhaps we should
[48:23] have done that to allow you to be part
[48:25] of
[48:25] be a part of that a little bit more
[48:27] though you are a part of it and that the
[48:29] reason that we were able to do that
[48:31] and to do some of these other things to
[48:33] start on is because
[48:35] of the giving and it was beyond what the
[48:37] expenses were so
[48:39] what was done that money was just would
[48:41] be set there and then when needs arise
[48:43] because sometimes things like that water
[48:45] heater arose
[48:47] and it wasn't planned it was an
[48:49] emergency
[48:50] and thankfully we were able to take care
[48:52] of that without having to go into the
[48:54] building from the savings and god's
[48:56] blessed us there we
[48:57] we don't want we didn't want to have to
[48:59] go in there and pull from that
[49:01] so when i i'm saying that are you still
[49:04] with me
[49:05] okay i'm getting to some real important
[49:07] points now
[49:09] you know um and with that in mind i i'd
[49:12] really what i'd like to do is to
[49:14] encourage you
[49:15] to continue to support the work of the
[49:17] lord as you did
[49:19] prior even to the beginning of march now
[49:22] there is there are many many that you
[49:25] know what
[49:25] there's not been any wavering even
[49:28] during the times of the month of march
[49:30] we went into the
[49:31] we had to start streaming a little bit a
[49:34] different one you know as
[49:35] you just took up and you kept on sending
[49:37] you kept on supporting because the work
[49:39] kept on going on
[49:40] and you kept on supporting with your
[49:42] tithes and offerings and sending that
[49:44] and and the bills were being paid and
[49:47] all of that and we thank god for that
[49:48] and
[49:49] i'm not in any way saying this to you
[49:51] because we're in a crunch
[49:52] we're not in a crunch but i just want to
[49:54] encourage you because
[49:56] before when we would pass around the
[49:58] offering baskets and take up ties and
[50:00] offerings
[50:00] many times we would there would be in
[50:02] there cash that would also come in
[50:04] because people would just want to put a
[50:06] little bit more in
[50:07] well that really hasn't been taken place
[50:10] but you know
[50:11] those of you i know you send in things
[50:13] through the bank you'll send it it goes
[50:15] right into a lock box that's worked out
[50:17] really good but there's also a little
[50:19] red box back there
[50:21] and that box if you something you know
[50:23] you want to put a little more in or
[50:24] that's
[50:25] some of you put your ties and offerings
[50:26] back in and we've had to do that during
[50:28] this time when everything's going on
[50:30] i want to encourage you to do that and
[50:33] encourage you to
[50:35] really to you know as even though
[50:38] there's been changes within that
[50:40] but you know i i want to bring it to
[50:42] your attention that
[50:44] within this right here that we i know
[50:47] you're unable to respond to something a
[50:49] need if you're not aware of it
[50:51] and so i want you to understand that
[50:53] when these things that are taking place
[50:55] there's sometimes when you begin to
[50:56] see that or even i'm encouraging you
[50:58] don't pull back on your giving
[51:01] if anything at all say god what more
[51:03] could i do
[51:05] because an offering is something that
[51:07] you to pray about
[51:08] let me just say this to you very clearly
[51:10] this this
[51:11] church is not my church this is not my
[51:15] church
[51:16] this is your church
[51:19] this is where you have a responsibility
[51:23] i have responsibility and we've taken
[51:25] that responsibility
[51:27] but i just want to encourage you within
[51:30] this that
[51:31] in a blessing if you haven't been
[51:34] supporting in the tithes and offerings
[51:36] and that goes
[51:36] even for those that are streaming by way
[51:38] of the internet if you haven't been i
[51:40] want to encourage you
[51:42] in the blessing of god where god said
[51:44] prove me
[51:45] that's one of the first promises that
[51:47] god ever said
[51:49] prove me is that right in the book of
[51:52] malachi
[51:52] prove me said and see if i will not pour
[51:55] out a blessing
[51:57] now this isn't about pride this isn't
[51:59] prosperity gospel this is the
[52:01] this is the word of god but we want to
[52:04] encourage you because
[52:05] it's important to be a part of what god
[52:08] is doing
[52:09] it's important to be a part you realize
[52:11] that brother branham would lay it out so
[52:13] clearly
[52:13] you don't if you're not supporting
[52:15] entities and offering you don't even
[52:17] have a vote in the church
[52:18] on what goes in because you're not it's
[52:21] not really being a part of it but
[52:23] we want to be a part of those things we
[52:25] want to be invested in what god is doing
[52:28] we want to be a part of it that whatever
[52:30] part that you can do is god
[52:32] lays it on your heart you know the
[52:34] tithes and offerings and i'm not here to
[52:36] preach on that this morning perhaps
[52:37] sometimes we'll do some teaching on it
[52:39] but
[52:40] you know there's a difference between
[52:41] times and offerings the tithes
[52:43] that's you know that's the tenth of the
[52:45] first fruits of
[52:46] of of your of your harvest and that's
[52:48] that's what's given to god but the times
[52:50] does not go to
[52:51] putting in lights and everything else in
[52:53] the church
[52:55] that's the offering that's the general
[52:56] expenses the offering goes to that to
[52:59] bringing those things about and and all
[53:01] of those things taking place
[53:03] and so when we when we see that god
[53:07] god just i believe his desire is that
[53:10] our attention just to say
[53:12] lord let us pray over these things let
[53:15] us be mindful of it
[53:17] we don't want to become even if you're
[53:18] not here you know sometimes if you're
[53:20] not here for a week or two or three or
[53:22] a month or something comes up expenses
[53:25] keep on going on
[53:26] and i want to encourage you just to just
[53:29] to remain
[53:30] and faith and stay faithful and if you
[53:33] haven't
[53:34] come into that place i want to encourage
[53:36] you because that's part of being a
[53:37] christian
[53:38] that's part of being a real christian
[53:40] that's part of the blessings of almighty
[53:41] god now when i talk about blessings it
[53:43] don't mean that you
[53:44] you know you're going to give you know
[53:46] in your times and your offerings because
[53:48] and then you walk outside and there's a
[53:49] cadillac
[53:52] we're not from texas with smiley teeth
[53:56] you understand but what it is i've
[53:59] witnessed this in my own life and i know
[54:01] i can different ones could say this
[54:03] where where where god has made a way
[54:07] when it didn't seem like there was any
[54:09] way and it might be something
[54:10] later on down the line god will open up
[54:13] a pathway
[54:14] he'll open up a way how many witnesses i
[54:17] got in here
[54:18] gotta just open up a way and see what
[54:21] what is that
[54:22] that's jehovah jireh it's him
[54:25] providing for himself and that's where
[54:29] our faith that's where we
[54:30] we rest within that and i want to i want
[54:33] to just encourage you
[54:34] because the offering that's you know the
[54:36] offering that's a part
[54:38] that it comes from it's from your heart
[54:40] it's what you pray over it's a free will
[54:42] offering and you just pray
[54:44] you think about it like this this is how
[54:45] you evaluate it when
[54:47] perhaps maybe within the next month or
[54:49] so the trustee brothers
[54:51] they'll start you know showing you the
[54:52] different expenses and we do that just
[54:54] so that you're mindful of that
[54:56] but to think about it what if you didn't
[54:58] pay your water bill
[55:00] what if you didn't pay your gas bill
[55:02] what if you just said
[55:04] i'll just wait on so and so to do it but
[55:06] when you can look at it and say
[55:08] this is my part in this this is what i'm
[55:11] going to do
[55:13] this is if you take it personal you
[55:15] you're not taking it for granted
[55:16] you take it personal that you know what
[55:18] this is my church
[55:21] i'm a part of this work here and that's
[55:23] that is the that is the absolute truth
[55:26] this is the work of the lord and we are
[55:29] privileged to be a part of it
[55:31] let us let us let us get behind
[55:33] everything with all that's within us
[55:36] and what i mean that that you when i say
[55:38] all this within us i
[55:40] truly mean that from all that is within
[55:42] our hearts that
[55:43] you know that god we would just be able
[55:47] to
[55:48] further not only meeting and meeting the
[55:50] different bills at different times but
[55:52] also when there is things that comes up
[55:53] whether it's an emergency
[55:55] or other improvements like if the lord
[55:57] tarries
[55:58] we'd like to be able for the body to
[56:01] improve
[56:01] the things that are back there with the
[56:03] computer and
[56:04] and it's not just improving there are
[56:06] things right now that
[56:07] some of it right now it's running by a
[56:09] thread
[56:11] and there are things that some need to
[56:12] be improved and so
[56:14] i can tell you that we we want to we
[56:16] want to be in prayer about that and we
[56:18] we will not only as you continue to and
[56:21] give
[56:21] really pray about that but when there's
[56:23] time maybe for special offerings
[56:26] we'll be committed to that to bring that
[56:28] to your attention because there's times
[56:29] that we might
[56:30] have to pray and say you know what let's
[56:32] set a little bit more back
[56:34] for what for what's taking place and so
[56:36] we want to be able to do that
[56:38] and i've i've not come i these are
[56:40] things that i'll just be honest with you
[56:42] i get very uncomfortable in talking
[56:44] about you know why because i
[56:46] myself i don't care about money
[56:51] i don't i don't like my i don't for my
[56:53] own self i don't even like being tangled
[56:55] up with things that i have to
[56:57] think about it i'd rather not have and
[57:00] not think about it
[57:02] that's me i'd rather not have and not
[57:04] think about it
[57:05] and but that's just how that you know
[57:07] for me and how that operating i know no
[57:09] doubt there's many of you or
[57:10] if not all of you operate the same way
[57:13] and so these are things that we just
[57:15] we just want i want to encourage you as
[57:17] your pastor
[57:18] let's really look deep in these things
[57:20] let's really think about let's pray over
[57:22] it
[57:22] and say god i want to be a part fully
[57:25] and if you haven't been
[57:26] part fully i want to encourage you to be
[57:28] a part fully
[57:30] and just to really make that commitment
[57:32] there is that okay
[57:35] man now i've got to preach after this
[57:37] but i i don't i don't believe this was
[57:39] negative at all this is the word of god
[57:43] and these are things sometimes that we
[57:44] call i don't want to say
[57:46] house cleaning but it's things that
[57:47] sometimes that we need to we need to
[57:49] speak about
[57:50] we need to mention about and so i
[57:53] just want to uh just thank you for for
[57:56] your time
[57:57] we want to just look to the word of the
[57:59] lord here this morning
[58:01] and if you wouldn't mind standing with
[58:04] me
[58:05] once again
[58:09] now i know i've taken some time and i
[58:11] know that time will
[58:13] anytime i stand here i know a lot of
[58:15] times that time
[58:16] gets counted against me so
[58:19] i'll try to be mindful of that here this
[58:21] morning
[58:22] amen ephesians chapter 3 is where i'd
[58:25] like to go if we could
[58:26] i'm just going to read just a portion of
[58:28] scripture here this morning
[58:40] and maybe as we turn there we couldn't
[58:42] just maybe bow our heads
[58:45] in just a word of prayer and whatever
[58:47] your need might be
[58:48] just just know that god is mindful he's
[58:51] mindful of your need

[1:00:37] ask it for the glory of god
[1:00:38] in jesus name amen in ephesians chapter
[1:00:42] 3 verse 14
[1:00:45] the bible says for this cause
[1:00:48] i bow my knees unto the father
[1:00:52] of our lord jesus christ of whom the
[1:00:56] whole family in heaven
[1:00:59] and earth is named
[1:01:02] that he would grant you according to the
[1:01:05] riches
[1:01:06] of his glory to be strengthened
[1:01:10] with might by his spirit
[1:01:13] in the inner man that christ
[1:01:16] may dwell in your hearts
[1:01:20] by faith that ye being
[1:01:23] rooted and grounded in love
[1:01:26] may be able to comprehend with all
[1:01:30] saints what is the breadth and length
[1:01:33] and depth and height and to know
[1:01:37] the love of christ which passeth
[1:01:40] knowledge
[1:01:41] that ye might be filled with all
[1:01:44] the fullness of god
[1:01:48] amen may god bless you as you're being
[1:01:50] seated
[1:01:54] i want to read to you hold here out of
[1:01:56] the message desperation
[1:02:00] brother branham in beginning of that
[1:02:02] message he asked the people to put down
[1:02:04] galatians
[1:02:05] 5 and 6.
[1:02:08] and it's the portion as he
[1:02:11] relates there that faith worketh
[1:02:15] by love faith worketh by love
[1:02:18] and the only way that you can have faith
[1:02:21] is have love first
[1:02:24] because after all faith
[1:02:28] is love's incentive it's an incentive
[1:02:31] that's exactly what
[1:02:33] faith is it's an incentive to love
[1:02:37] if you don't have love you can't have
[1:02:41] faith so i want to
[1:02:45] in looking at these the scriptures here
[1:02:47] we have been
[1:02:49] dealing with or looking at the thought
[1:02:51] operating
[1:02:53] by the faith of this hour and we
[1:02:56] recognize that that faith that we're
[1:02:58] talking about
[1:03:00] is that same faith that was once
[1:03:02] delivered to the same
[1:03:04] it's the same faith that moved into
[1:03:07] early church
[1:03:08] it's the same faith that is moved down
[1:03:11] through the ages
[1:03:13] that faith is the faith of the son of
[1:03:16] god
[1:03:17] it's god's own life it is
[1:03:20] the love of god that moves into a heart
[1:03:25] into a life where you and i as we've
[1:03:28] looked at and just spoke just at
[1:03:30] different moments that
[1:03:32] indeed in our own life there is a faith
[1:03:35] that resides but when the faith of god
[1:03:39] begins to move down and begins to deal
[1:03:42] with our life and then it it drops into
[1:03:44] our life
[1:03:45] then it pushes our faith
[1:03:48] out onto the battlefront but we're not
[1:03:50] we're not without
[1:03:51] backing or authority or an absolute in
[1:03:54] other words our faith is not venturing
[1:03:56] without authority but our faith
[1:03:58] is backed up by our big brother the
[1:04:01] faith of the son of god
[1:04:03] so we've got an absolute we've got that
[1:04:05] which we can
[1:04:06] step out on the battlefront you know our
[1:04:10] faith
[1:04:10] love will push it out there because the
[1:04:13] faith of the son of god
[1:04:15] has moved down within our life and god's
[1:04:17] faith
[1:04:18] is not a dormant faith the faith of god
[1:04:22] is a living reality it's a person
[1:04:26] it's the person of jesus christ it's the
[1:04:28] same god
[1:04:30] who thought his word spoke his word and
[1:04:33] then
[1:04:33] came and became what he thought
[1:04:36] and spoke he expressed it that is
[1:04:40] that is all uh the great paradox
[1:04:43] of god's working and the faith of god
[1:04:46] and this is where paul as he's writing
[1:04:49] here
[1:04:50] in the book of ephesians and is the
[1:04:52] first part of that chapter
[1:04:54] that we read paul is declaring
[1:04:57] to the ephesians as well as to the
[1:05:00] gentiles
[1:05:01] that god has revealed
[1:05:04] himself to me the mystery that is to be
[1:05:08] preached among the gentiles which that
[1:05:11] mystery
[1:05:12] would be christ in you the hope of glory
[1:05:15] in other words you and i were not even
[1:05:18] aware
[1:05:18] of the covenants we were not aware of
[1:05:21] the
[1:05:22] promises but god had all of this
[1:05:25] reserved
[1:05:26] within himself it was a hidden
[1:05:29] mystery that was reserved there where
[1:05:32] god would come
[1:05:34] after there was a putting away by the
[1:05:36] jews where they
[1:05:38] rejected the messiah but all of that was
[1:05:41] in the plan and program of god
[1:05:44] because god himself was going to take
[1:05:48] a gentile bride and as we were looking
[1:05:51] at that last week
[1:05:52] it's not just god coming down and
[1:05:54] selecting people right now
[1:05:56] but god is omniscient god already
[1:05:59] knew the end from the beginning as an
[1:06:02] elect child of god
[1:06:04] we come from the very loins of almighty
[1:06:07] god
[1:06:08] and this is where now god he comes down
[1:06:12] by his word
[1:06:12] no other way that god has of redeeming
[1:06:16] than by his word and god came down
[1:06:20] he became one of us he paid the price he
[1:06:23] shed the blood which the blood
[1:06:24] was the payment or the ransom that was
[1:06:27] required
[1:06:28] in order that you and i might come back
[1:06:32] into an expression of the son and
[1:06:34] daughter of god
[1:06:35] because as long as there was a debt that
[1:06:38] was hanging over our head
[1:06:40] there's no way that god could call us to
[1:06:42] him and say
[1:06:43] it come be my son or come be my daughter
[1:06:45] although
[1:06:46] we already were sons and daughters of
[1:06:49] god
[1:06:49] you see what i'm getting at there had to
[1:06:52] be a way
[1:06:53] that was made in order to begin to
[1:06:57] call us in that way that we might come
[1:07:00] back
[1:07:01] into that expression now the spirit of
[1:07:04] god
[1:07:04] moved down through the ages it moved
[1:07:07] upon the prophets
[1:07:08] it moved upon abraham it moved upon the
[1:07:10] believers
[1:07:11] and they experienced that part of god
[1:07:15] that was allotted or given to them in
[1:07:18] that time
[1:07:19] but they never experienced the
[1:07:21] indwelling
[1:07:22] and abiding presence of the holy spirit
[1:07:27] that you and i have been privileged to
[1:07:30] be a partaker of
[1:07:31] when they fell in the beginning the
[1:07:34] prophet tells us in the message oneness
[1:07:36] that the image of god it left them so
[1:07:39] i just say it very clearly what adam
[1:07:42] had he was able to fall from
[1:07:46] but quite now for you
[1:07:49] when you have received the spirit of god
[1:07:52] it's
[1:07:53] impossible to fall away
[1:07:56] because the scripture would go on you
[1:07:58] see this is god's word
[1:08:00] all of this was hidden in the old
[1:08:01] testament it continues to come out
[1:08:04] in the new testament it was hidden in
[1:08:06] shadows and types
[1:08:07] of the security that there is in
[1:08:10] jesus christ paul would go on to call it
[1:08:13] a seal that's also an old testament word
[1:08:16] and to let you and i know the assurance
[1:08:19] the security
[1:08:20] that comes from the seal of the living
[1:08:23] god
[1:08:23] and that is where god has literally
[1:08:26] pressed his life into you to where now
[1:08:30] you're no longer known by your first
[1:08:33] birth
[1:08:34] but you are now known by your new birth
[1:08:36] that you
[1:08:37] are a new creation in christ
[1:08:40] jesus you you're the seal designates
[1:08:44] this is my personal property
[1:08:48] and the reality of that seal not only
[1:08:50] does it show coming and going
[1:08:52] but that seal it packs within it a
[1:08:55] transforming power
[1:08:56] you're no longer living by your own
[1:08:59] strength
[1:09:00] but now it is the very strength and
[1:09:03] dunamis of almighty god
[1:09:05] that is not coming upon you once in a
[1:09:07] while but
[1:09:08] now god has made his abode and his
[1:09:11] tabernacle his habitation
[1:09:13] inside of your life
[1:09:16] [Music]
[1:09:17] very precisely he came
[1:09:20] to claim that part that always
[1:09:23] belonged to him
[1:09:26] say it very clearly there's a part of
[1:09:28] you that's really him
[1:09:30] and that part of you that's really him
[1:09:32] is what he come to clay
[1:09:35] i'm talking about that seed we've been
[1:09:37] talking about that bedding ground
[1:09:39] that's the part that there has never
[1:09:42] been
[1:09:42] dirty traps on that seed
[1:09:45] because it wasn't alive before it was a
[1:09:49] seed
[1:09:49] but it was waiting for the time the
[1:09:52] season
[1:09:53] the inspiration that was needed in order
[1:09:56] to come
[1:09:56] and raise that seed to life who all can
[1:09:59] do that
[1:10:00] but our heavenly father who alone knew
[1:10:03] where we were at
[1:10:04] but our heavenly father he knew what age
[1:10:06] you'd be in
[1:10:07] he knew exactly where you would be at it
[1:10:09] was not a mystery to god
[1:10:11] but god was seeking you out and bringing
[1:10:14] you
[1:10:15] to himself
[1:10:18] it says why you can say i'm not my own
[1:10:21] work
[1:10:21] i'm not the work of a church i am his
[1:10:25] workmanship amen
[1:10:29] that paradox is a great precious
[1:10:32] reality that you can stand on
[1:10:37] when the doctor says i don't know what's
[1:10:38] coming next you've got solid ground to
[1:10:40] stand on
[1:10:43] hallelujah you've got an absolute an
[1:10:45] authority
[1:10:46] grounds that you know who you are
[1:10:50] very precious i say that's very precious
[1:10:54] it's very precious in this hour it
[1:10:57] becomes more precious
[1:11:00] hallelujah oh glory be to god
[1:11:05] faith so when we look at this
[1:11:09] i want to just speak a little a few
[1:11:12] moments here
[1:11:13] at least to try into this because i'm
[1:11:15] watching my time
[1:11:18] i want to speak on love brings
[1:11:22] faith these are some things that
[1:11:27] probably over a month ago i got ready to
[1:11:28] sit down on a
[1:11:30] saturday and finish and certain things
[1:11:32] and inspiration just
[1:11:33] dropped enough whole thought to come out
[1:11:35] and i didn't know
[1:11:36] that this was going to be today i didn't
[1:11:38] know when i would speak this but i just
[1:11:40] how god just began moving in my heart
[1:11:43] here even this week and moving different
[1:11:46] things and directions
[1:11:48] but i want to look at this about love it
[1:11:50] brings faith and i'm talking about
[1:11:53] the love of god it brings the faith of
[1:11:55] god
[1:11:56] because the love of god it is the faith
[1:11:59] of god
[1:12:00] brother brown would say it in many
[1:12:01] places like he goes on in the message
[1:12:04] desperation then you'll come in the
[1:12:05] message perfect faith
[1:12:07] and he'll speak love and he'll say it in
[1:12:09] this terms not you can't have
[1:12:11] faith without love and love and faith
[1:12:13] are kinfolks
[1:12:15] then they're related and so in the
[1:12:17] scripture first john 4
[1:12:19] 17 the bible said herein is our love
[1:12:23] made perfect that we may have
[1:12:27] boldness in the day of judgment notice
[1:12:30] this
[1:12:30] a love hearing is our love made perfect
[1:12:35] it's it's a powerful reality of how that
[1:12:38] god begins to deal with our heart
[1:12:40] we begin to fall in love with him it's
[1:12:43] all him working
[1:12:44] until it comes to a place that it is no
[1:12:48] longer
[1:12:48] just it's no longer just our love alone
[1:12:52] but
[1:12:52] god's love has completely moved behind
[1:12:55] it's entered in as paul could say in
[1:12:57] another place the love of god is
[1:13:00] shed abroad in our hearts
[1:13:03] it's where the love of god that passes
[1:13:05] all understanding
[1:13:06] it's where now that love of god it's
[1:13:09] what
[1:13:09] masters circumstances it's what causes
[1:13:13] faith to step
[1:13:14] out and when i say faith to step out
[1:13:17] we're not talking about
[1:13:18] lucy goosey we're talking about the
[1:13:21] things that say
[1:13:22] you know i don't know exactly uh what to
[1:13:25] do maybe in this
[1:13:26] in this but this is what god's word says
[1:13:29] amen
[1:13:29] i'm gonna stand on his word this is what
[1:13:33] this is why brother babies say
[1:13:35] what's the greatest compliment that we
[1:13:37] can we can give god
[1:13:38] is to believe what he said simply
[1:13:42] because he said that's the greatest
[1:13:46] compliment what brings it about
[1:13:48] love brings that about it
[1:13:51] [Music]
[1:13:53] so even for you and me even to come to a
[1:13:56] place
[1:13:56] of serving god you can never serve god
[1:13:58] under fear god doesn't want you to come
[1:14:00] and serve him under fear
[1:14:03] there can be fear that strikes the heart
[1:14:04] as far as like hey
[1:14:06] i realize i'm undone i realize i'm
[1:14:09] unclothed
[1:14:10] i'm talking about your soul i'm
[1:14:12] unclothed i'm not under the blood
[1:14:14] and it strikes your heart where would
[1:14:15] you be where would you where would you i
[1:14:17] can't say spend eternity because
[1:14:19] hell there's an ending of time there
[1:14:22] is that right the bible says it was
[1:14:24] created
[1:14:26] but you see it goes deeper than then
[1:14:28] then
[1:14:29] when then we begin to look at those
[1:14:31] things and we begin to
[1:14:32] you know in in in a manner begin to look
[1:14:35] and say
[1:14:36] for that of the love of god here is our
[1:14:38] love made perfect
[1:14:40] that we may have boldness that's a
[1:14:42] confidence that's not an
[1:14:44] arrogancy but it's a it's a confidence
[1:14:48] you ever tried to do something without
[1:14:50] confidence
[1:14:52] you might as well just quit right i
[1:14:55] don't care if it's shooting the ball
[1:14:56] shooting a gun
[1:14:57] working and plumbing or whatever you're
[1:14:58] doing you do try to do something without
[1:15:00] confidence
[1:15:01] just just set it down we know that's
[1:15:03] true
[1:15:04] you see because why listen to me real
[1:15:07] godly confidence
[1:15:09] is real faith and that is where you are
[1:15:13] rested in other words you become
[1:15:17] a channel a surrendered branch
[1:15:20] of the vine and you're aware it's not me
[1:15:23] doing this
[1:15:24] it's him doing it and you become rested
[1:15:27] not in your ability but you're resting
[1:15:30] in the confidence
[1:15:31] of the love of god where christ is
[1:15:33] dwelling in your hearts by faith that's
[1:15:35] why you can say
[1:15:37] regardless of anything i can do all
[1:15:40] things through christ who strengtheneth
[1:15:43] me
[1:15:47] hallelujah it's a confidence and that
[1:15:50] confidence
[1:15:51] that faith that we're talking about it
[1:15:53] does not cause you and i
[1:15:55] to go out and act on our own but it
[1:15:58] brings
[1:15:59] a rest in other words brother greg
[1:16:02] it brings an availability where we make
[1:16:06] ourselves
[1:16:06] available to god
[1:16:11] because look at this as he is so are we
[1:16:14] in this world
[1:16:16] as he is seated on the mercy seat but
[1:16:20] remember
[1:16:21] he came back in the form of the holy
[1:16:23] ghost
[1:16:24] in that body pilate looked at that body
[1:16:28] pilate looked at that life and said i
[1:16:30] find no fault in him
[1:16:32] he was a man subject to subject to
[1:16:36] the the temptations and things that were
[1:16:38] all around us
[1:16:39] in the likeness of sinful flesh but
[1:16:41] there was the life
[1:16:42] and the character that they could not
[1:16:44] put their finger on
[1:16:48] i find no fault in him you see he was to
[1:16:52] be
[1:16:52] the true passover sacrifice
[1:16:56] we're talking about there was no fault
[1:16:58] in this life
[1:17:00] or this character
[1:17:03] that not only threw him by the shedding
[1:17:05] of the blood
[1:17:06] the offering of that life would pay the
[1:17:09] ransom would pay the debt but it would
[1:17:11] make a way
[1:17:12] that that same life now comes
[1:17:15] back upon the worshiper and you are no
[1:17:18] longer recognized
[1:17:20] by your first birth you now are
[1:17:23] recognized
[1:17:24] by your new birth by the spirit of god
[1:17:28] frankly put when god looks at you he
[1:17:31] sees himself
[1:17:35] because it's his life that has bred back
[1:17:38] or raised up a son or daughter of god
[1:17:43] you are i have memories of the past but
[1:17:45] remember
[1:17:46] those memories of the past was not that
[1:17:49] of that seed on the inside
[1:17:51] that seed did not do any of those things
[1:17:54] but that seed has been raised up by the
[1:17:57] power of almighty god
[1:18:03] so as he is we are in this world
[1:18:07] see it's a perfection of his life
[1:18:10] it's not us trying to oh i got to bring
[1:18:13] myself into perfection
[1:18:14] stop you you can't do that right that's
[1:18:17] not what god wants you to do anyhow
[1:18:19] you're only fighting and struggling
[1:18:21] against him he don't want you to do that
[1:18:23] well i can't lay this down
[1:18:24] i can't do that he's not wanting you to
[1:18:26] do it on your own accord
[1:18:28] he's desiring that you would allow his
[1:18:31] love
[1:18:31] and fall in love with him to the very
[1:18:34] hold of it
[1:18:35] passes out of your life that's a work of
[1:18:39] almighty god i mean think of it
[1:18:41] i know some people think well we believe
[1:18:43] in arranged marriages the only arranged
[1:18:45] marriage i believe in is that which come
[1:18:46] from the mind of god
[1:18:50] i don't marry no i don't well i'm saying
[1:18:52] married cause i'm already married but
[1:18:53] you understand what i'm saying
[1:18:54] i don't want to marry nobody that where
[1:18:56] everything's arranged
[1:18:58] now if i'm speaking against anybody's
[1:18:59] culture or customer or whatever more
[1:19:01] you forgive me but you understand what
[1:19:03] i'm saying it's kind of hard
[1:19:05] if you don't love somebody but the whole
[1:19:08] purpose and the whole framework
[1:19:09] and groundwork that leads even into
[1:19:12] courtship
[1:19:13] into engagement and into a union it's
[1:19:16] got to be based
[1:19:17] on love sure it starts with an
[1:19:20] attraction
[1:19:21] but then you realize hey it's much
[1:19:23] deeper than just the attraction brother
[1:19:25] there's a character of a person behind
[1:19:28] that
[1:19:29] that you fall in love with
[1:19:30] [Applause]
[1:19:33] and then when you hear that uniting has
[1:19:35] come between us and christ
[1:19:37] remember it is god as a matter of fact
[1:19:40] brother battle we just had a dedication
[1:19:42] of a
[1:19:42] uh of little isaac here last week a
[1:19:45] little baby
[1:19:46] and brother i'm standing there and
[1:19:47] standing in the gap all right no no
[1:19:49] in the message look he says to think of
[1:19:51] it that when you've been born again of
[1:19:53] the spirit of god
[1:19:54] because everybody knows a baby's
[1:19:55] innocent right but when you've been born
[1:19:58] again of the spirit of god
[1:19:59] you're more innocent than a baby
[1:20:09] that's what the new birth brings it
[1:20:11] brings
[1:20:12] innocency
[1:20:15] innocency that's what the real
[1:20:18] justification of god
[1:20:20] is all about mom preaching all ahead and
[1:20:23] honor
[1:20:25] amen i want to be i want to lay this in
[1:20:28] as well
[1:20:30] this is where it comes there's no fear
[1:20:33] in love but perfect love
[1:20:36] cast out fear
[1:20:40] hallelujah because fear hath torment
[1:20:44] and you know what i'm talking about i'm
[1:20:47] talking about even
[1:20:48] even after you've passed beyond from
[1:20:50] death unto life
[1:20:51] there's things that can come up and if
[1:20:52] you listen to it
[1:20:54] or they're saying this at work right now
[1:20:56] right they're saying this about the
[1:20:58] economy right now
[1:20:59] they're saying this about this right now
[1:21:01] they're saying this about a new strain
[1:21:03] right now they're saying
[1:21:04] if you let it it'll take you over
[1:21:09] you go from like peter walking on the
[1:21:10] water you start looking at the waves and
[1:21:12] you start sinking all right
[1:21:14] that's right i'm talking to i'm talking
[1:21:16] to any of us now
[1:21:18] are you with me this is where then
[1:21:20] perfect love
[1:21:21] and it comes back into that place we
[1:21:24] have a confidence to say
[1:21:25] wait a minute god's word didn't change
[1:21:32] i respect science respect all those
[1:21:34] things but that ain't my god
[1:21:37] i am not going to bow down and worship
[1:21:40] it
[1:21:42] are you with me we're not being arrogant
[1:21:44] but this is god's word
[1:21:46] as a believer with rugged faith there is
[1:21:49] no compromising on the word of god
[1:21:53] brother this goes deeper than ability to
[1:21:55] quote ability to put this together
[1:21:57] i'm talking about a life
[1:22:01] i'm going to preach now judas had a
[1:22:03] ministry that was
[1:22:04] second to none he never even got
[1:22:08] questioned has been the betrayer but let
[1:22:10] me tell you something
[1:22:11] you look there were lives like simeon
[1:22:14] you read of simeon's life you read of
[1:22:16] anna's life
[1:22:17] you read of those down through the old
[1:22:19] testament brother
[1:22:20] they were not in the book of who's who
[1:22:22] matter of fact they weren't even who's
[1:22:24] who
[1:22:25] among the religious of that day they
[1:22:27] were thought to be
[1:22:28] nuts outcasts you know why they had
[1:22:30] direct contact with god
[1:22:32] it was a living faith that they
[1:22:34] themselves were like the salmons
[1:22:37] going upstream back to the birthing
[1:22:39] grounds
[1:22:40] they went upstream through all the tommy
[1:22:42] rock and all the trash
[1:22:44] and all the current of the day why there
[1:22:47] was a
[1:22:48] force behind them
[1:22:56] i'm trying to get somewhere now oh my
[1:23:00] you see this is where this is where
[1:23:03] perfect love
[1:23:04] it cast out fear
[1:23:07] i wish i could just preach more on that
[1:23:11] verse 19 we love him
[1:23:14] because he first
[1:23:18] loved us glory be to god
[1:23:22] we're rooted and grounded in love
[1:23:25] that that whole phrase rooted and
[1:23:26] grounded it means
[1:23:29] you're established amen amen
[1:23:32] you're growing in his love
[1:23:36] yeah it's a building up there's a
[1:23:38] rootedness there's a ground
[1:23:40] you know you can tell when you plant
[1:23:41] plants you can tell when they're rooted
[1:23:42] or not
[1:23:45] it's like when we you know you plant
[1:23:47] shrubbery or you plant other plants or
[1:23:49] whatever more
[1:23:50] forgive me if you you just need to ask
[1:23:52] god to give me different examples but
[1:23:54] you understand
[1:23:55] these things sometimes when they plant
[1:23:57] them trees and things like that
[1:24:00] when they're planted a lot of times
[1:24:02] during that first year
[1:24:03] sometimes the first couple years not
[1:24:05] only are they staked
[1:24:07] they've been planted they're staked
[1:24:09] because the wind
[1:24:10] direction of the wind and you've got to
[1:24:13] water them right
[1:24:14] why why don't you have to water them
[1:24:17] until they're established
[1:24:19] even sometimes certain bushels
[1:24:20] hydrangeas and on and on
[1:24:22] you've got to water them why are you
[1:24:24] doing that because their roots
[1:24:26] haven't got deep enough to where they
[1:24:29] actually
[1:24:30] can find that water that's well beneath
[1:24:33] the surface
[1:24:36] this is where when a life becomes rooted
[1:24:39] and grounded in jesus christ and look
[1:24:42] there's a growing going on in our life
[1:24:44] this is why you in your life you look
[1:24:47] back you can look back and say
[1:24:49] god through all the tests and the trials
[1:24:52] and everything in my life
[1:24:53] even the windstorms that had your tree
[1:24:56] going like this
[1:24:57] but you know why i think god you could
[1:24:58] go like this because every time you're
[1:25:01] moving like this
[1:25:02] what's happening the roots are being
[1:25:04] loosened beneath the trial
[1:25:07] so you can go deeper in jesus christ
[1:25:11] so the trials are not a curse the trials
[1:25:14] are a blessing
[1:25:16] as peter said they're more precious than
[1:25:19] gold
[1:25:20] tried in the fire
[1:25:24] glory be to god rooted and grounded in
[1:25:27] love to where
[1:25:28] it's all based on a love affair
[1:25:32] between you and god amen what does that
[1:25:35] create
[1:25:36] it creates faith
[1:25:40] i've read this scripture to you and who
[1:25:42] knows how long
[1:25:43] how many times i'll keep reading it to
[1:25:45] you as long as he keeps putting it in
[1:25:46] here
[1:25:47] but i like it i am crucified with christ
[1:25:51] nevertheless i live
[1:25:55] yet not i but christ liveth
[1:25:58] in me and the life which i now
[1:26:01] live in the flesh i live by the faith of
[1:26:05] the son of god
[1:26:07] who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:26:10] notice he notice what happened here
[1:26:14] the faith of the son of god that paul is
[1:26:16] now
[1:26:17] living by this is a living faith but
[1:26:20] notice how did this come about
[1:26:22] it's because that which was made known
[1:26:25] to paul
[1:26:25] has the spirit of god dealing with his
[1:26:27] life that he
[1:26:28] loved him that god himself had come down
[1:26:32] become one of them god had taken on the
[1:26:35] form of his word
[1:26:36] and he had expressed his love no wonder
[1:26:38] paul could write
[1:26:39] in the book of romans in colossians john
[1:26:42] could write about it
[1:26:43] first john 2 john 3 john in this was the
[1:26:46] man of man was the love of god
[1:26:48] manifested toward us paul said while we
[1:26:50] were yet
[1:26:51] sinners he loved us he died for us he
[1:26:54] gave his life wow this was something
[1:26:56] that was so real to paul that in order
[1:26:59] for paul's life to be
[1:27:00] changed there had to be another life a
[1:27:04] greater life
[1:27:05] come that could actually release the
[1:27:08] bondage
[1:27:09] and the imprisonment that he was in
[1:27:13] oh glory be to god and you know the only
[1:27:15] thing that could really release that
[1:27:16] imprisonment would be
[1:27:18] very really the manifestation of the
[1:27:20] name of jesus christ
[1:27:22] because that is the word that is
[1:27:24] redemption that is god coming to fulfill
[1:27:26] his word and when that word was made
[1:27:29] manifest to paul
[1:27:30] brother he he let loose of what he was
[1:27:33] tied to
[1:27:34] he had been tied to that pharisee post
[1:27:36] he matter of fact paul was resting
[1:27:38] on his natural birth i'm of the stock of
[1:27:40] benjamin
[1:27:41] i'm of this talk of me i'm a pharisee of
[1:27:43] the pharisee paul
[1:27:45] he knew so much there was so much
[1:27:47] knowledge he had
[1:27:48] but in the presence of almighty god he
[1:27:50] became
[1:27:51] like every one of us that had been born
[1:27:53] of the spirit of god
[1:27:55] we go from a know-it-all to a know
[1:27:57] nothing in a matter
[1:27:58] of nanoseconds it comes to a place to
[1:28:01] say god
[1:28:02] everything that i thought i knew and
[1:28:04] everything that i thought about the new
[1:28:06] birth
[1:28:07] everything that i thought were about you
[1:28:09] it changes in a matter of moments
[1:28:12] when he
[1:28:17] he makes this statement because we're
[1:28:19] we're dealing with faith
[1:28:21] and brother brandon would make this
[1:28:22] statement and he would say
[1:28:25] faith is based on forgiveness now he he
[1:28:29] he's bringing it from the book of mark
[1:28:33] where if you say to this mountain and
[1:28:36] you recognize
[1:28:37] that is the is an hour where the sons of
[1:28:39] god
[1:28:40] were living in a time where the sons of
[1:28:43] god
[1:28:43] coming to manifestation we're living in
[1:28:46] that hour
[1:28:47] the earth is groaning and travailing
[1:28:51] this is why the bible says earthquakes
[1:28:54] in diverse places
[1:28:56] the earth let me just say it right now
[1:28:58] the world
[1:28:59] is not the earth and the earth is not
[1:29:02] the world
[1:29:03] the world is the system of governance or
[1:29:06] administration
[1:29:07] that's upon the earth right now but god
[1:29:10] himself is come to in order to release
[1:29:14] that hold of the world upon the earth
[1:29:17] because the earth
[1:29:18] is a redeemable attribute of almighty
[1:29:21] god
[1:29:22] is that right the same way that he
[1:29:24] redeems the earth is the same way he
[1:29:26] redeems you and i
[1:29:27] yeah he started this redemption of the
[1:29:29] earth through
[1:29:31] noah's message right god saw the
[1:29:34] wickedness of man
[1:29:35] where their thoughts and everything else
[1:29:37] was filled
[1:29:38] with all with evil and wickedness and
[1:29:41] everything else
[1:29:42] and god sent a message that would lead
[1:29:44] this
[1:29:45] earth to a place of repentance i'm
[1:29:48] talking about the earth
[1:29:49] it would lead it to a place of
[1:29:51] repentance and god
[1:29:52] would baptize this earth under that
[1:29:56] message
[1:29:57] under the revealing of that word in that
[1:30:00] hour then we know
[1:30:01] it came to that of calvary and the
[1:30:03] shedding of the blood whereby the blood
[1:30:05] would drop upon the earth and then claim
[1:30:07] it and make it known
[1:30:09] that this is my redeemable attribute
[1:30:12] it's always belonged to me
[1:30:13] and even now after the blood has been
[1:30:16] shed god
[1:30:17] is working yet by his spirit and he will
[1:30:20] move through
[1:30:21] even in the time in the millennium when
[1:30:23] it will set forth in a further
[1:30:25] in a further portion of sanctification
[1:30:28] where the bible says
[1:30:29] the knowledge of the lord shall fill the
[1:30:32] earth
[1:30:32] land sea and sky and it makes ready
[1:30:35] there
[1:30:36] for the actual event after the
[1:30:38] millennium
[1:30:39] and after that there of the white throne
[1:30:41] judgment
[1:30:42] on the battle of gog and magog it then
[1:30:44] makes ready
[1:30:45] then it comes be cut back up and now
[1:30:47] comes that city down
[1:30:48] to where now the earth itself is
[1:30:51] absolutely
[1:30:52] cleansed and the fire of god the city of
[1:30:55] god sets down
[1:30:56] in this earth what is that that's the
[1:30:58] same way that he redeems
[1:31:01] you and i am there
[1:31:08] but faith itself is based on forgiveness
[1:31:15] watch out brother says this in the
[1:31:16] beginning of perfect faith and then as
[1:31:18] we said this morning
[1:31:19] trying to get the church into the place
[1:31:22] to where we could really see
[1:31:24] apostolic times moving among us that's
[1:31:27] what we all hunger
[1:31:28] it's just laying right at the door we
[1:31:30] see it
[1:31:32] but we want to see more of it
[1:31:36] we want it such a flow that it'll be a
[1:31:38] help to us
[1:31:40] and us flow out to others
[1:31:45] i say amen now you realize brethren will
[1:31:49] go into this
[1:31:51] in the message of perfect faith let me
[1:31:53] just read this here to you to where
[1:31:55] as we're dealing with some of this he
[1:31:57] says i want to speak to you now upon
[1:31:59] faith
[1:32:00] a different type of faith a perfect
[1:32:02] faith that's a great thing
[1:32:04] faith we're told in the bible faith
[1:32:06] cometh by hearing
[1:32:07] now you can't be saved without faith
[1:32:10] faith is something that you have to
[1:32:12] believe it's there
[1:32:14] and really nothing else will declare
[1:32:16] it's there but faith
[1:32:18] now i'm trying to bring faith to you so
[1:32:21] that you can be ready for this prayer
[1:32:22] line
[1:32:23] in the next few moments i want you to
[1:32:25] watch how brother branham is working
[1:32:27] with this here
[1:32:28] because not only is he trying to get the
[1:32:30] people in condition for the prayer line
[1:32:33] but he's trying but he's working that
[1:32:35] the people would focus
[1:32:37] on the right realities and the right
[1:32:40] foundation of faith
[1:32:42] and that if they're not ready they can
[1:32:44] be made ready
[1:32:46] now think of this he said i'm trying to
[1:32:48] prepare you for the prayer line that's
[1:32:50] going to be coming
[1:32:51] but you see we realize we're being
[1:32:53] prepared
[1:32:54] for more than just a prayer life now
[1:32:56] it's true if you've got a need in your
[1:32:58] life let me just say it very clearly
[1:33:00] you don't got to wait till the preaching
[1:33:01] is over to receive your need
[1:33:04] don't limit god i believe that the bible
[1:33:06] said they show their hands on the sick
[1:33:08] and they shall recover
[1:33:09] we believe that promise no question but
[1:33:11] the bible also says
[1:33:12] in the book of psalms he sent his word
[1:33:15] and he healed his people
[1:33:17] see it's not up to you and what i'm
[1:33:19] trying to say is don't try to put god in
[1:33:21] a box
[1:33:22] but just say god here i am i'm a
[1:33:25] believer
[1:33:26] this is your word lord and you know what
[1:33:29] if
[1:33:30] however that you would choose if it's at
[1:33:32] the end of service
[1:33:33] and god moves on your heart to be prayed
[1:33:35] for let me just tell you
[1:33:37] it is no less of faith
[1:33:40] to be prayed for we're interested in
[1:33:42] trying
[1:33:43] in being held maybe you need a little
[1:33:45] boost to your faith
[1:33:47] you know god's not ashamed to give you a
[1:33:48] boost god don't pull up you know with
[1:33:50] the jumper cables and say
[1:33:52] here i want you to come up here and my
[1:33:54] servant will pray for you
[1:33:55] man if you want so sorry if you want so
[1:33:57] weak in faith god's not
[1:33:59] interested in running you down because
[1:34:01] you might need a boost
[1:34:02] you might need a boost how many here has
[1:34:05] ever needed a boost in faith
[1:34:07] thank god that god will come by whether
[1:34:10] through the preaching of the word
[1:34:11] or while we're in prayer and god will
[1:34:13] give a boost as a matter of fact
[1:34:15] brother brown would say it like this
[1:34:17] when people are in need of a charge
[1:34:19] from god he said god may that theophany
[1:34:23] body of theirs come near where they're
[1:34:26] setting this morning
[1:34:27] and give them a fresh charge
[1:34:32] glory be to god hallelujah
[1:34:36] oh michael's heaven ain't somewhere way
[1:34:38] out there
[1:34:39] it's right here in a faster dimension
[1:34:46] faith notice he said he that cometh to
[1:34:48] god must believe that he
[1:34:50] is it's impossible to please god without
[1:34:52] faith
[1:34:53] you cannot please him if you say you
[1:34:55] believe god you have never seen him
[1:34:57] so then you've got to believe it by
[1:34:59] faith if you could see him listen to me
[1:35:02] now
[1:35:02] if you could see him it would be no more
[1:35:05] faith
[1:35:06] anything that the census declares is no
[1:35:09] more faith
[1:35:10] it's a scientific fact see it's
[1:35:13] not no more faith
[1:35:16] so if we're living our life by facts
[1:35:19] it's not faith
[1:35:22] if you're living by facts you might want
[1:35:23] to check where them facts are coming
[1:35:24] from
[1:35:26] because a lot of times scientific facts
[1:35:28] have to re-fact-check
[1:35:31] and redo this and redo that so what are
[1:35:33] you saying i would not
[1:35:34] rest my ground i would not rest my life
[1:35:37] i would not stake it upon science that
[1:35:40] is the god
[1:35:41] of this evil age how many times the
[1:35:44] prophet of god would tell us even the
[1:35:46] things
[1:35:47] that was sweeping down even around in
[1:35:49] this earth in this world he would talk
[1:35:51] about different ones that were motivated
[1:35:53] by a communistic spirit he spoke of
[1:35:55] these things
[1:35:56] that was coming on what is the god of
[1:35:58] communism
[1:35:59] science education well you see because
[1:36:02] it's godless
[1:36:03] it's got to have something that would be
[1:36:06] somewhat worship
[1:36:07] or to make it feel good remember now
[1:36:09] even though it's a science
[1:36:10] it's not without emotion you take people
[1:36:13] that'll believe in this
[1:36:14] and they'll do this and i'm doing this
[1:36:15] and you're not and i'm better than you
[1:36:17] and you're not what is that that is
[1:36:19] religious emotional
[1:36:21] worship but nothing is to replace
[1:36:24] the divine worship of in spirit and
[1:36:27] in truth and his sons and daughters of
[1:36:30] god
[1:36:30] in this age as they withstood science
[1:36:34] and the oppressiveness down through
[1:36:35] every age and told the believers
[1:36:38] it's not possible it's not so but there
[1:36:41] were believers
[1:36:42] that had the backing of jehovah god they
[1:36:45] had that god
[1:36:46] who failed himself in the pillar fire
[1:36:49] was so real to them
[1:36:50] it pushed their faith out on the
[1:36:52] forefront even when they didn't know
[1:36:55] how things were going to turn out but
[1:36:57] like the hebrew children
[1:36:58] they said god will not fail
[1:37:04] oh glory
[1:37:07] i believe i'm speaking to someone
[1:37:11] i'm one of them i believe
[1:37:15] meshech said wreck and abednego i know
[1:37:17] that's their babylonian names
[1:37:19] but they had real real hebrew names one
[1:37:22] of these days you'll find out your real
[1:37:24] name
[1:37:26] you see we were called this and called
[1:37:28] that but one day the word came by our
[1:37:30] way
[1:37:31] and the word began to call our name
[1:37:35] hey mary was in the garden she thought
[1:37:37] he was a gardener after his resurrection
[1:37:40] but when he called her name
[1:37:43] she said raponi rabbonai
[1:37:46] when he called her name they were
[1:37:49] speaking but the difference was
[1:37:51] when he called her name amen she
[1:37:53] recognized
[1:37:55] this is my master oh my god
[1:38:06] anything that senses declares it's no
[1:38:09] more faith
[1:38:10] it's a scientific fact is that right
[1:38:14] i mean it's like the if the doctor tells
[1:38:15] you take this pill take that pill
[1:38:17] or do this sure we'll take this pill
[1:38:20] we'll take that pill or whatever
[1:38:22] but we're not basing it on that
[1:38:25] we take that pill take it with water or
[1:38:27] what juice whatever you want to take it
[1:38:29] with
[1:38:30] chocolate milk lord jesus i take this in
[1:38:33] the name of jesus christ
[1:38:34] the lord you're my healer
[1:38:38] all healing comes from god
[1:38:41] [Music]
[1:38:42] is that right amen so this is how
[1:38:45] we approach everything respect it yeah
[1:38:48] i mean it's just like you know telling
[1:38:49] us drive down the road i respect
[1:38:51] stop signs don't you yeah i appreciate
[1:38:53] what other people do too
[1:38:56] is that right appreciate all that but
[1:38:58] you know when we look at this
[1:39:00] it's not no more faith but you have to
[1:39:01] accept him by faith
[1:39:03] and he that cometh to god must believe
[1:39:06] god
[1:39:06] and faith comes by hearing the word of
[1:39:08] god you
[1:39:09] must first believe this
[1:39:13] is god's word and you must come to god
[1:39:17] by the word you can't come to god
[1:39:20] outside of it being by the word
[1:39:24] just take the word what it says that's
[1:39:26] right
[1:39:27] everything else contrary to it is not
[1:39:30] right
[1:39:31] abraham had to believe just what the
[1:39:33] voice told him now watch how he goes
[1:39:35] here
[1:39:35] and when he was a hundred years old 25
[1:39:38] years later
[1:39:39] he was stronger believing it than he was
[1:39:42] 25 years ago when it was given to him
[1:39:45] why he was growing
[1:39:46] [Music]
[1:39:48] he was growing he believed it
[1:39:51] and he staggered not at the promise of
[1:39:53] god through unbelief
[1:39:54] but was strong giving praise to god
[1:39:58] knowing he was able to perform what he
[1:40:00] had promised and that's the way
[1:40:02] everyone must be that way
[1:40:06] you must come with an unfailing faith
[1:40:09] now watch this
[1:40:10] believing that god made the promise
[1:40:13] but now you have to be in a position
[1:40:19] to have that faith notice what he says
[1:40:23] in a position to have that faith
[1:40:27] and that's what we're going to talk on
[1:40:29] see to receive
[1:40:30] that faith all right now brother rabbit
[1:40:34] he goes on and continuing throughout
[1:40:36] the message he's dealing with because in
[1:40:38] our lives
[1:40:40] there's needs as we said throughout
[1:40:43] there's needs that come about in our
[1:40:44] life
[1:40:45] maybe you're praying about a job
[1:40:48] praying about family matters praying on
[1:40:51] and on and on and on
[1:40:52] you need an answer from god you need a
[1:40:55] direction from god
[1:40:57] you need his will and you're
[1:41:00] you're waiting lord you know sometimes
[1:41:02] the will of god
[1:41:04] it can come right across the platform it
[1:41:06] come right where you're reading
[1:41:07] you're listening to a message prayer
[1:41:09] closet
[1:41:10] believe it or not while you're walking
[1:41:13] down target that's not excuse to go to
[1:41:14] target now
[1:41:15] it can happen because in anywhere listen
[1:41:18] to me
[1:41:18] even when i go different places i don't
[1:41:21] i don't break contact with him
[1:41:23] there many times i'm walking sometimes
[1:41:25] i'll just try to get out maybe with my
[1:41:27] wife but on
[1:41:28] and on as i'm going there's things that
[1:41:29] still is upon my heart by the joy
[1:41:31] there's things i'm studying things
[1:41:32] within that god i just just have here
[1:41:34] before me
[1:41:35] and it's right there and it's just what
[1:41:37] i'm meditating on now i know as a
[1:41:38] minister
[1:41:39] there's ways and and things like that
[1:41:41] that you know as i'm able to do that but
[1:41:43] but i believe that that's the same way
[1:41:44] it is for all of us or else god would
[1:41:46] have just restricted it and said now
[1:41:47] just for the ministry
[1:41:48] meditate on those things but it's not
[1:41:51] it's for every one of us
[1:41:53] now you know how it is when you're in
[1:41:54] the word and you're feeding on the word
[1:41:56] you're listening to the word and then
[1:41:58] when you you know you have to put pause
[1:42:00] or stop
[1:42:00] and you go to work or you go to your
[1:42:02] other places you realize you might have
[1:42:03] put stop there or pause or
[1:42:05] close it up put your book marker there
[1:42:07] but it didn't stop that's right
[1:42:08] because you know why you're a feeder
[1:42:11] you're a feeder and you're feeding on
[1:42:12] living word
[1:42:14] and that word is alive and there's
[1:42:15] things that as it's just moving
[1:42:17] you know and it's not even something
[1:42:18] necessarily that maybe that you're all
[1:42:20] together thinking about
[1:42:21] but it's right there and then all of a
[1:42:22] sudden there'll be something that'll
[1:42:24] just drop and
[1:42:25] things will connect and you'll have this
[1:42:27] what's going on you're a feeder
[1:42:29] on the word and the word is actually
[1:42:32] ministering to your life
[1:42:33] you're taking that in and god is
[1:42:35] ministering to your needs you see
[1:42:37] when god wants to make known his will
[1:42:39] for our lives there's things that
[1:42:41] we can pray over and i don't know about
[1:42:42] you but i would love in every situation
[1:42:45] for god to come down like he has at
[1:42:46] times for certain decisions in my life
[1:42:49] and would tell me just things that just
[1:42:51] you know is like an olive voice that
[1:42:52] would speak to me but it hasn't happened
[1:42:54] that way every time it hasn't always
[1:42:56] come about
[1:42:57] in that manner sometimes it's just been
[1:43:00] in a manner to where i'm praying
[1:43:01] and i'm praying and then all of a sudden
[1:43:03] there is a deep peace
[1:43:05] that sets in upon my life and that deep
[1:43:08] peace regarding
[1:43:09] that situation it's not something you
[1:43:11] know i've had people tell me before
[1:43:12] when i asked him have you prayed about
[1:43:14] this did you pray about this well yeah
[1:43:15] god never told me no that don't mean he
[1:43:17] told you yes
[1:43:20] are you with me i mean it's like trying
[1:43:22] to get daddy's attention you know
[1:43:23] zachary's sometimes trying to get my
[1:43:25] attention or this or that daddy that
[1:43:26] just because
[1:43:27] that i am into something at that time
[1:43:30] and i'm not able to respond to him it
[1:43:31] don't mean hey go ahead dad don't care
[1:43:33] about it that's not it at all you better
[1:43:35] make sure you got papa's approval
[1:43:38] so the one thing that sometimes that you
[1:43:40] and i it regards what we're praying
[1:43:42] we're waiting on god we're looking to
[1:43:44] god but as a believer we learn a lot of
[1:43:47] times we learn this by experience
[1:43:48] as we go on in life sometimes we've done
[1:43:50] things hastily sometimes we've done
[1:43:52] things
[1:43:53] presuming well i'm going to preach
[1:43:54] sometimes we've done this this ain't
[1:43:56] even in the notes but we're just going
[1:43:57] to preach it
[1:43:58] these are things sometimes we've went
[1:43:59] along with it and then you realize
[1:44:01] afterwards oh
[1:44:02] boy i shouldn't have made that decision
[1:44:04] but you see god's grace will allow you
[1:44:06] to come back to that place not just to
[1:44:08] say lord forgive me
[1:44:09] but it teaches you and i one thing that
[1:44:11] they that wait on the lord
[1:44:13] shall renew their strength and they
[1:44:16] shall mount up with wings as an eagle
[1:44:18] it teaches you and i to be patient to
[1:44:21] look to the lord
[1:44:22] because god does not want us acting by
[1:44:24] our own ability
[1:44:25] that's not what faith is but faith
[1:44:27] itself
[1:44:28] is there when the peace of god has
[1:44:30] dropped down in your heart
[1:44:31] you cannot even explain where others
[1:44:34] would say
[1:44:34] what in the world are you doing but you
[1:44:36] see when faith has dropped
[1:44:38] there is a peace that passes all
[1:44:40] understanding
[1:44:41] as a matter of fact there is a peace by
[1:44:44] the faith
[1:44:45] of almighty god that sees obstacles
[1:44:48] but it doesn't consider them it doesn't
[1:44:51] focus the mind's eye
[1:44:52] upon the obstacles it's so focused
[1:44:55] upon that of god his program and his
[1:44:58] word
[1:45:00] this is what faith does and you see so
[1:45:02] being brought in position
[1:45:04] there's needs in our life to come up
[1:45:06] even after even after
[1:45:09] we have come into position by the new
[1:45:11] birth
[1:45:14] we've come into a position because
[1:45:16] listen for translation faith
[1:45:19] for rapture you've got to be in position
[1:45:23] the rapture is for those who's in
[1:45:24] position in christ jesus
[1:45:28] position is not something we come to
[1:45:29] after we're born again position
[1:45:31] is where we are placed positionally by
[1:45:34] the holy ghost
[1:45:35] in the body of jesus christ so being in
[1:45:38] position
[1:45:40] is that where our life is grounded it is
[1:45:43] that where christ
[1:45:44] is dwelling in our hearts by faith it's
[1:45:46] where
[1:45:47] that in the scripture as it would say
[1:45:49] there is therefore now
[1:45:51] no more condemnation to them that are in
[1:45:53] christ jesus
[1:45:54] who walk not according to the flesh but
[1:45:57] after the spirit
[1:45:58] it would also go on to say in the book
[1:46:00] of john if our heart condemn us we can't
[1:46:02] have confidence
[1:46:04] so you see what the work of the holy
[1:46:06] spirit does
[1:46:07] in bringing us in position as god would
[1:46:09] deal with our life and bring us in a
[1:46:11] place that we might
[1:46:12] have this perfect faith that then when
[1:46:15] situations arise
[1:46:16] we are in position as a channel to
[1:46:18] receive from god direction
[1:46:20] we must be free from condemnation now
[1:46:23] the greatest the greatest condemnation
[1:46:25] there is
[1:46:26] is that of the first birth there's got
[1:46:28] to be one who's able to lift
[1:46:30] us from that condemnation of our first
[1:46:33] birth it takes more than good morality
[1:46:35] good morality it's not lifting above
[1:46:38] condemnation
[1:46:38] there might be others that could look at
[1:46:40] you and say well they're a pretty good
[1:46:41] person
[1:46:42] but listen you can still be under
[1:46:44] condemnation
[1:46:45] you can take the finest man and the
[1:46:47] finest woman you may not even be able to
[1:46:49] put a finger on their life
[1:46:50] but yet if that life has not really
[1:46:53] truly been born again
[1:46:54] and come under the blood of the lord
[1:46:56] jesus christ it is under the judgment
[1:46:59] and the wrath and condemnation of
[1:47:01] almighty god
[1:47:03] but you see god's desire is to remove or
[1:47:06] leave or lead us out of that
[1:47:08] condemnation remember
[1:47:09] look in the scripture god never comes
[1:47:12] along and he gets
[1:47:13] down in the mess and the monk but what
[1:47:15] does he do he wants you and i
[1:47:17] to come out come out and be separate
[1:47:20] come out from under the condemnation
[1:47:22] come out you see
[1:47:23] his desire is to bring us out from where
[1:47:26] we are
[1:47:27] and bring us into him
[1:47:30] that's what redemption is all about it's
[1:47:32] bringing
[1:47:33] back into the rightful place and
[1:47:35] position
[1:47:37] what was lost so this position then it
[1:47:40] puts us in a place
[1:47:42] to where we're ready to go
[1:47:46] amen now i want you to think of this
[1:47:49] here do me
[1:47:50] have just just a few moments can i have
[1:47:51] just a few moments
[1:47:53] just to lay in a little bit of this
[1:47:54] because we're not even i'm just barely
[1:47:56] getting anywhere here but i want to just
[1:47:57] lay this in
[1:47:58] here this morning when we look at this
[1:48:00] here as brother brown was telling us
[1:48:02] here
[1:48:02] with the word of god is to take god's
[1:48:04] word and to believe it it's where god
[1:48:07] would begin to deal with our life
[1:48:08] because it takes love
[1:48:10] bringing faith in our life so it takes a
[1:48:13] real operation
[1:48:14] of almighty god this is where that in
[1:48:17] john 14 15 it says
[1:48:19] if ye love me keep my commandments
[1:48:23] and i will pray the father now notice
[1:48:25] this is before the holy ghost has been
[1:48:27] given
[1:48:28] if you love me keep
[1:48:32] my commandments and i will pray
[1:48:35] the father and he shall give you
[1:48:38] another comforter that he may abide with
[1:48:42] you
[1:48:43] forever even the spirit of
[1:48:46] truth whom the world cannot receive
[1:48:50] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[1:48:52] him but ye know him
[1:48:54] for he dwelleth with you and shall be in
[1:48:56] you how many know that jesus
[1:48:58] is a high priest that could be touched
[1:49:00] by the feeling of our infirmities
[1:49:02] remember that a high priest himself when
[1:49:04] god would have the priest the priests
[1:49:05] were set aside
[1:49:06] to be able to offer up gifts on behalf
[1:49:09] of the people
[1:49:10] that was only a type that would speak of
[1:49:12] the very
[1:49:13] life of the lord jesus christ it would
[1:49:15] also have a part to do with us
[1:49:17] as priests of god that have come in by
[1:49:19] the new birth but he
[1:49:20] is the high priest he is the one that
[1:49:23] offered up
[1:49:24] the the ultimate sacrifice by the
[1:49:26] offering of his life
[1:49:28] that would absolutely pay the ransom for
[1:49:31] you and i
[1:49:32] once and for all and then he would come
[1:49:34] back now
[1:49:35] in the form of the holy ghost to fulfill
[1:49:38] that part of the word
[1:49:39] that was left unfulfilled or that part
[1:49:42] that he would come
[1:49:43] and he would fulfill in redemption in
[1:49:46] the gathering end
[1:49:47] of his very own attributes his sons and
[1:49:50] daughters of god
[1:49:51] and so remember now as he would come his
[1:49:54] word would go forth and notice what he
[1:49:55] said
[1:49:56] if you love me keep my commandments so
[1:49:58] who is it if peace with people only
[1:50:01] focus
[1:50:01] on commandments you're missing the real
[1:50:04] reality
[1:50:05] well i got to do this and i got to do
[1:50:07] this and i got to do that
[1:50:08] you're missing the real reality this is
[1:50:10] where that many steal
[1:50:12] they struggle with things well well i
[1:50:14] love god and i love this but you see
[1:50:16] you're
[1:50:16] you're separating they're missing the
[1:50:17] point if you love him that's what was
[1:50:20] first
[1:50:20] if you love me then keep my commandments
[1:50:24] so you begin what happens is there
[1:50:26] begins to be
[1:50:27] a love affair that begins to take place
[1:50:30] in that life
[1:50:31] and love begins to work upon that heart
[1:50:34] it's god
[1:50:35] that's moving in that time let me read
[1:50:36] this again brother adam will take us
[1:50:38] back to this scripture
[1:50:39] in john 14 17. look at this even the
[1:50:42] spirit of
[1:50:44] truth whom the world cannot receive
[1:50:46] because it seeth him not
[1:50:48] neither knoweth him but you know him for
[1:50:50] he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[1:50:53] in the message the comforter brother
[1:50:55] brethren words it like this
[1:50:56] he said notice even the spirit of truth
[1:50:59] whom the world cannot receive
[1:51:00] the world as long as you love the world
[1:51:05] you'll never receive it
[1:51:07] [Music]
[1:51:09] see the world the world is that that
[1:51:12] administration that which is governing
[1:51:15] that which is upon that life as long as
[1:51:18] you
[1:51:18] love the world you'll never receive it
[1:51:22] so you see in order to receive it god
[1:51:24] listen to me now
[1:51:25] god will not go over i think we're
[1:51:27] starting to look at some of this last
[1:51:28] week
[1:51:29] but notice when we look at it god will
[1:51:31] not go over
[1:51:32] our own free will god will not save us
[1:51:36] against our will
[1:51:37] he don't grab us by the arm and you know
[1:51:39] pulling that's not how god works
[1:51:41] that would be slavery that would be an
[1:51:45] operation
[1:51:46] of fear that's not how god works
[1:51:50] god does not desire that we would serve
[1:51:52] him out of fear
[1:51:54] i'm talking about slavish fear there's a
[1:51:56] difference between
[1:51:57] that fear that was spoken in first john
[1:52:00] 4
[1:52:00] that fear that has torment that fear
[1:52:03] that's a slave is fear that
[1:52:04] if i don't do this if that's a slavish
[1:52:07] torment
[1:52:08] that is not what god intended when we
[1:52:11] talk about the fear of the lord
[1:52:12] the bible said the fear of the lord is
[1:52:14] clean
[1:52:16] the fear of the lord is reverencing him
[1:52:20] referencing his word notice this the
[1:52:23] world
[1:52:24] as long as you love the world you'll
[1:52:26] never
[1:52:27] receive it now in first john 2 14 look
[1:52:30] how
[1:52:31] the scripture with being was set forth i
[1:52:33] have written unto you fathers
[1:52:35] because you have known him that is from
[1:52:36] the beginning i have written unto you
[1:52:38] young men because you are strong
[1:52:40] and the word of god abideth in you and
[1:52:42] you have overcome the wicked one
[1:52:45] love not the world
[1:52:48] it's amazing how the word wrote love
[1:52:50] right here is agapa
[1:52:52] amazing in it love not the world but
[1:52:55] there's also
[1:52:56] a part that deals with this love right
[1:52:58] here that means to be content with
[1:53:03] are you with me love not the world
[1:53:06] neither the things that are in the world
[1:53:10] if any man love the world the love
[1:53:13] of the father is not in him
[1:53:17] for all that is in the world the lust of
[1:53:20] the flesh
[1:53:21] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[1:53:23] life is not of the father
[1:53:25] but is of the world and the world
[1:53:29] passeth away right
[1:53:32] aren't you glad it passed away for you
[1:53:34] amen
[1:53:36] hallelujah and though i and the world
[1:53:39] passeth away and the lust
[1:53:42] thereof so they're removing listen the
[1:53:45] removing of the world
[1:53:46] the administration the system if pat
[1:53:49] takes with it
[1:53:50] all of the unbelief or attributes
[1:53:54] of the world and the lust thereof
[1:53:58] but he that doeth the will of god
[1:54:00] abideth
[1:54:02] forever it's amazing you know how god
[1:54:05] god will work and deal with the heart
[1:54:07] and deal with the life
[1:54:08] but if there's things that you know can
[1:54:11] continue on and the person says
[1:54:13] well you know this it ain't that bad i
[1:54:15] got this under control and
[1:54:16] i got this and i've been doing this
[1:54:18] you're letting me you're playing around
[1:54:19] with that
[1:54:20] you're actually content with the world
[1:54:24] this is where the scripture says love
[1:54:26] not the world in other words
[1:54:27] you don't make excuse for it what about
[1:54:30] samuel that's just my weakness
[1:54:31] that's an excuse there is no weakness
[1:54:34] in the atonement amen
[1:54:38] you see this is why we must be
[1:54:40] strengthened with might
[1:54:42] in the inner man there's got to be
[1:54:46] a change on the inside a positioning
[1:54:50] for perfect faith a positioning
[1:54:54] for faith to drop into a positioning
[1:54:57] for god to lead us and you see it's got
[1:55:00] to be ground because remember
[1:55:01] what real faith does what does love do
[1:55:04] it brings confidence
[1:55:05] it brings us in a place to be available
[1:55:09] but you see as long as there is these
[1:55:11] things right here
[1:55:12] a person is still bound in condemnation
[1:55:16] they can never a god can never operate
[1:55:19] it can never move
[1:55:20] the way it needs to move in their life
[1:55:21] because they're still content let me
[1:55:23] just tell you right now
[1:55:24] don't try to take care of things in your
[1:55:26] life
[1:55:28] but surrender it to god but when i say
[1:55:31] that surrender to god
[1:55:33] god ain't gonna pry it out of your hands
[1:55:36] he won't pry it
[1:55:37] right it's got to be surrendered
[1:55:41] it has to come to a place to a person no
[1:55:44] longer
[1:55:45] is content with the world
[1:55:48] no longer wanting it no longer where it
[1:55:51] becomes an acquaintance or a body
[1:55:53] but where there becomes a transformation
[1:55:57] notice how jesus would say this i'm just
[1:55:59] just
[1:56:00] just a little bit more here matthew 16
[1:56:03] 24
[1:56:04] jesus said unto them if any man will
[1:56:05] come after me let him deny
[1:56:08] himself and take up his cross and follow
[1:56:10] me
[1:56:11] for whosoever will save his life shall
[1:56:14] lose it
[1:56:14] and whosoever will lose his life for my
[1:56:16] sake shall find it
[1:56:18] for what is a man profited if he shall
[1:56:20] gain the whole world
[1:56:22] and lose his own soul what shall a man
[1:56:26] give in exchange for his soul
[1:56:30] now think of this you know
[1:56:34] jesus would would write of it in this
[1:56:35] way remember when the disciples
[1:56:38] they were asking him we've
[1:56:41] we've left father mother house's lands
[1:56:44] and
[1:56:45] all this we we've done this
[1:56:48] what do we receive
[1:56:52] jesus goes on to let him know he said
[1:56:55] those
[1:56:56] that have followed me in the
[1:56:58] regeneration
[1:57:00] of the son of man he's talking about
[1:57:04] the new birth the regeneration
[1:57:08] shall receive life everlasting
[1:57:11] eternal shall set upon 12 thrones
[1:57:14] he's going into a place to show the
[1:57:17] positioning
[1:57:19] and those who will follow him now
[1:57:20] remember to follow somebody
[1:57:23] is where you let somebody lead you amen
[1:57:26] now you and i did not know this way we
[1:57:29] could not know this way
[1:57:30] remember the way into the holiest of
[1:57:32] holies was blocked off
[1:57:34] there was a veil right but that veil had
[1:57:37] to be opened
[1:57:39] but the veil that needed to be opened
[1:57:41] was not the veil that was in the literal
[1:57:43] temple
[1:57:44] the veil itself would be that of where
[1:57:46] god himself would come down
[1:57:48] in the veil of his own pitching
[1:57:52] that veil of his own body that then
[1:57:54] through the offering up of his life
[1:57:56] the bible would call it in isaiah 53
[1:57:59] when he offered up
[1:58:00] his soul he offered up his life
[1:58:04] we say i think sometimes they sing the
[1:58:06] song here his life for mine sister mercy
[1:58:08] sings it
[1:58:08] his life for mine there was an exchange
[1:58:13] that was made
[1:58:16] amen what we received
[1:58:22] because he was willing to drink his
[1:58:25] bitter cup
[1:58:26] amen i think my brother
[1:58:29] tells us he said he wanted our
[1:58:32] fellowship so bad
[1:58:35] that one of his last request was father
[1:58:39] granted that where i am they may be
[1:58:42] there also
[1:58:46] [Applause]
[1:58:47] that's the desire of our father that was
[1:58:50] projected
[1:58:51] in the life of the lord jesus christ
[1:58:54] to pray on our behalf
[1:58:58] to encourage as a life as he begins to
[1:59:01] deal with that life
[1:59:03] life begins to change it begins to
[1:59:06] dissolve
[1:59:07] he begins to move in that life you see
[1:59:11] brother brown would say it like this and
[1:59:12] believe in god
[1:59:14] i don't have all the quotes down because
[1:59:16] some i just want to refer to but just
[1:59:18] just listen i know this is simple
[1:59:25] he says
[1:59:29] no man could heal anybody christ done
[1:59:32] that when he died
[1:59:34] i couldn't save nobody or no one else
[1:59:37] can save anybody
[1:59:38] but god and god can't save you
[1:59:43] because he's already done it
[1:59:47] the only thing you have to do is accept
[1:59:50] it it's already
[1:59:54] done he said i wasn't safe 20 years ago
[1:59:57] i was saved 1900 years ago
[2:00:00] 20 years ago i received it and accepted
[2:00:03] it
[2:00:05] if it hadn't the first sin i did god
[2:00:08] would have wiped me off the face of the
[2:00:09] earth
[2:00:09] because he said he would he's kept his
[2:00:11] promise i was healed
[2:00:13] 1900 years ago but i've got to accept it
[2:00:17] you see that's what the preaching of the
[2:00:19] gospel is all about
[2:00:22] that's what god sent the message in this
[2:00:25] hour was to bring our faith
[2:00:27] in a finished work of calvary
[2:00:31] [Applause]
[2:00:33] it was an announcement it's finished
[2:00:37] [Music]
[2:00:39] it's a trumpet that is blown that sounds
[2:00:42] liberty brother samuel what do i got to
[2:00:46] do
[2:00:47] accept it
[2:00:49] [Music]
[2:00:53] let me say this to you now
[2:00:57] contentness with the world will never
[2:01:00] allow you to accept it
[2:01:03] there's a reason why hearts can set in
[2:01:06] church
[2:01:07] or on and on just dial in with me here
[2:01:10] just a moment
[2:01:14] and the reason sometimes when you're
[2:01:15] praying for loved ones
[2:01:17] you're praying for different ones i want
[2:01:19] to see god move on their life of course
[2:01:20] we do
[2:01:22] and we know it has to be god to do it is
[2:01:25] that right
[2:01:26] you know that as a believer that your
[2:01:28] life is a paradox
[2:01:31] you know you didn't change your life and
[2:01:32] you can't explain it either
[2:01:35] but you know you've been changed
[2:01:38] but you're praying and you look and you
[2:01:41] say
[2:01:41] they're so close what's this they're
[2:01:45] they're sensitive thank god for all that
[2:01:48] keep
[2:01:48] praying but let me tell you what's going
[2:01:51] on
[2:01:52] the reason god can't move no further
[2:01:56] is because they're still content with
[2:01:58] the world
[2:02:00] when the love of the world is still
[2:02:02] there where it's still
[2:02:03] holding on you said well i think i
[2:02:05] thought that has to be god
[2:02:06] to take that out of the way but remember
[2:02:09] god just does not come and take
[2:02:11] something
[2:02:12] that you want to hold on to
[2:02:15] if you want to hold on to it that's
[2:02:17] contentness that's love
[2:02:20] but god wants that to be directed to him
[2:02:25] to where you lose sight of this and it's
[2:02:28] focusing on him
[2:02:30] you see what's happening then it's god
[2:02:32] and the only way this happens
[2:02:33] it's god working on that life god
[2:02:36] working on that's why i told you
[2:02:38] when you're praying for your children
[2:02:39] and you're praying for your loved ones
[2:02:41] just don't pray for them here and just
[2:02:43] don't pray god
[2:02:44] you bless them you say god get them to a
[2:02:47] place
[2:02:48] if you've got to bring them to a place
[2:02:50] the only way they can do is look up
[2:02:52] bring them to that place lord bring them
[2:02:54] to a place to where they know
[2:02:56] they really need you bring them to a
[2:02:59] place that they're sick and tired
[2:03:01] of this world
[2:03:05] you understand what i'm saying i'm not
[2:03:08] saying you know
[2:03:08] lord do this to me that's not what we're
[2:03:11] saying at all
[2:03:12] god knows how to he knew how to get my
[2:03:13] attention he knows how he knew how to
[2:03:15] get your attention
[2:03:16] he knows how to get the attention of
[2:03:17] each and every one let me just tell you
[2:03:19] something
[2:03:20] our experiences are not the same but we
[2:03:22] did have the same experience
[2:03:24] of passing from death unto life
[2:03:28] hallelujah by the same almighty god
[2:03:32] by a paradox of his omnipotent power
[2:03:35] [Music]
[2:03:37] that's why it's your testimony that's
[2:03:39] why my testimony is
[2:03:41] my testimony and your testimony is your
[2:03:43] testimony
[2:03:49] but you see it's in a place where we
[2:03:51] come
[2:03:52] to rotting out
[2:03:56] how do you how does a seed rot
[2:04:00] we got to put it in the ground right but
[2:04:03] even when it's in the ground
[2:04:06] you can put a seed right in the soil if
[2:04:10] there's not moisture in that soil
[2:04:13] it won't rot
[2:04:17] but you let moisture start getting
[2:04:18] around it
[2:04:20] all right
[2:04:25] i've dug a minimum as a science teacher
[2:04:28] and taught these things
[2:04:29] i had to do everything with them and not
[2:04:31] to break out into a shout and spell
[2:04:35] you dig that up and you show where where
[2:04:38] the flats that we had to plant
[2:04:39] underneath them
[2:04:40] lights you planted them you didn't water
[2:04:42] them they didn't grow
[2:04:44] but as soon as water came upon that soil
[2:04:48] you know what that soil did it held that
[2:04:50] water in
[2:04:52] and that hard stoney
[2:04:55] heart i mean that hard stony seed coat
[2:04:58] on that seed that he was setting in
[2:05:00] there and what happens
[2:05:02] that water it begins to rot it
[2:05:06] what's it doing it's loosening it up so
[2:05:09] the inside
[2:05:10] man can come out
[2:05:13] amen and that's why it takes the water
[2:05:14] of life that's why it takes the word of
[2:05:17] god
[2:05:17] being preached that's why it takes that
[2:05:21] original life that original word
[2:05:23] that original word water that original
[2:05:25] outpouring
[2:05:26] of the holy ghost to bring about a real
[2:05:29] rotting
[2:05:29] of the seeds to where the seeds get so
[2:05:32] miserable
[2:05:33] get so tired of the condition and the
[2:05:35] life they're in
[2:05:36] they then take their ambitions and the
[2:05:38] direction about
[2:05:39] why does the preacher preach this why is
[2:05:41] the preacher preaching this
[2:05:42] he now trains to say lord it's not about
[2:05:45] the preacher
[2:05:46] you're trying to change me lord i want
[2:05:49] to be
[2:05:49] changed help me
[2:05:53] to rot
[2:05:57] i don't know about you but when anything
[2:05:59] rocks it's a mess sometimes you take
[2:06:02] them seeds out of there
[2:06:09] that's the same way when god's working
[2:06:12] on our life
[2:06:14] we're falling in love with him it gets
[2:06:16] messy
[2:06:19] things start breaking down on our life
[2:06:21] but you know what it's a glorious thing
[2:06:24] it's a rotting way it's not anything
[2:06:27] where we're under
[2:06:27] you know the the hammer under you better
[2:06:30] this you better it's not that at all
[2:06:32] it's a love affair
[2:06:35] and a matter of fact you didn't even
[2:06:37] know it then
[2:06:38] you didn't even know what was going on
[2:06:41] you didn't even know why things started
[2:06:42] to turn in your life
[2:06:43] why you started to be open to some
[2:06:45] things
[2:06:46] it's god working
[2:06:50] my mind we gotta stop here somewhere
[2:06:56] you see what's happening god he's
[2:06:58] bringing you into a place
[2:06:59] of surrender
[2:07:03] a place of surrender that we can accept
[2:07:05] what he's already done for us
[2:07:08] brother brown would say it like this
[2:07:11] young people
[2:07:12] middle age old every one of you i want
[2:07:15] you to hear this
[2:07:17] brother tells us he says the only thing
[2:07:20] that kept me from being saved
[2:07:23] when i was 12 years old was because a
[2:07:26] spirit hung over me
[2:07:28] a devil said to me
[2:07:32] wait a little longer a devil
[2:07:36] wait a little brother longer
[2:07:40] i didn't want no devil i i know
[2:07:43] none of us did but you see that first
[2:07:46] nature
[2:07:47] it was inclined that way it could be
[2:07:50] inspired that way it'd be kind of like
[2:07:52] in your phones
[2:07:53] you know some of you got att some of you
[2:07:55] got sprint some of you got verizon some
[2:07:57] of you got
[2:07:57] whatever you know how to do sometimes
[2:07:59] you gotta you when you buy your phone
[2:08:00] they ask you oh
[2:08:01] okay what what's your carrier you say
[2:08:04] my carrier is sprint or whatever it is
[2:08:08] and so you might be having an awesome
[2:08:09] deal on the phone but it's verizon i
[2:08:11] know you can get all this stuff reworked
[2:08:13] but don't
[2:08:13] don't don't don't get all me you
[2:08:16] understand if you
[2:08:17] if you're on verizon network and you buy
[2:08:18] an att
[2:08:20] setup phone phone you're in trouble
[2:08:24] you're not going to be getting the sigil
[2:08:25] signals like you need to get
[2:08:27] right but when you get that that that
[2:08:29] that phone if your plan is on a verizon
[2:08:31] plan
[2:08:32] you're going to want a phone that's got
[2:08:34] a verizon sim card
[2:08:37] because that's a sim card that when it's
[2:08:40] activated
[2:08:42] it's tapped into that network then it
[2:08:45] begins to receive
[2:08:47] within that network from the sending
[2:08:50] towers
[2:08:51] of verizon because that's the plan
[2:08:55] you're a part of
[2:08:57] you were a part of redemption plan
[2:09:00] [Music]
[2:09:03] there was a sim card in you before it
[2:09:06] was a sim card of the world
[2:09:09] [Applause]
[2:09:12] there was all sorts of pictures and
[2:09:14] things that come up and
[2:09:15] how things would look on you and
[2:09:17] everything else and you were moved by
[2:09:18] this post and
[2:09:19] moved by that and you posted this and
[2:09:21] you did this
[2:09:24] but one day god took a hold of your life
[2:09:26] and
[2:09:31] he yeah that there's a little itty-bitty
[2:09:33] thing right there he took it
[2:09:35] i didn't know when things existed like
[2:09:37] that he took it
[2:09:39] a little small little instrument and
[2:09:41] that little thing pops out on the side
[2:09:43] it's an
[2:09:43] itty bitty brother greg a little sim
[2:09:45] card
[2:09:46] it's got writing on it and you've got to
[2:09:50] tell
[2:09:50] if you've ever had to do it this way i
[2:09:52] had to do it this way if you ever had to
[2:09:53] do it this way you have to take it out
[2:09:55] and you got to tell the guy at verizon
[2:09:57] or whoever your carrier is
[2:09:59] read me off the numbers mr browning okay
[2:10:01] and you're looking brother joe it's hard
[2:10:03] even with my bifocals
[2:10:05] [Laughter]
[2:10:07] three seven z two now that ain't the one
[2:10:10] don't try to copy it down
[2:10:12] but brother richard i had to tell them
[2:10:14] that you know why
[2:10:16] if they don't know what's written on
[2:10:17] that card they can't activate it
[2:10:22] in that seed
[2:10:25] down on the inside of you
[2:10:28] your first sim card it could not
[2:10:32] receive nor would it ever become a son
[2:10:34] or daughter of god
[2:10:36] but that sim card that come from god i
[2:10:39] hope that's all right to say it that way
[2:10:41] that real seed that real representation
[2:10:44] that come from god
[2:10:45] brother when that right there it's being
[2:10:47] dealt with
[2:10:48] bringing to a place to where that is the
[2:10:51] one who gets activated
[2:10:54] that changes everything but before it
[2:10:57] can get activated
[2:10:59] it's got to get in the hands of the
[2:11:01] right person
[2:11:03] who knows how to deal with it and god
[2:11:06] knows how to deal with our life
[2:11:08] like brother brahm says that devil he
[2:11:09] said it hung over me
[2:11:11] wait wait a little longer wait a little
[2:11:13] because the first
[2:11:15] birth was inclined
[2:11:18] and it was sensitive to that but then
[2:11:21] god continued to deal with that life now
[2:11:24] let me just close with this
[2:11:27] that god commissioned his church
[2:11:30] to cast out devils
[2:11:34] a devil that can tell a person you're in
[2:11:36] this you're not a part of this
[2:11:38] you'll never understand this look at you
[2:11:43] but that devil what it is he's afraid
[2:11:48] you see the devil operates by fear
[2:11:50] [Music]
[2:11:51] because what he knows is all it takes is
[2:11:54] simple
[2:11:55] accepting what the word has said
[2:11:59] is letting go and say lord i
[2:12:02] stand upon your word
[2:12:06] and that it begins the horde begins to
[2:12:08] break over
[2:12:09] it begins to break loose the preaching
[2:12:11] of the gospel right while the gospel
[2:12:13] is being preached let me tell you
[2:12:14] something i've witnessed it not just
[2:12:16] here
[2:12:17] i've witnessed it in in the youth camps
[2:12:19] i've witnessed the devils and having
[2:12:21] people on the ground and
[2:12:22] casting out spirits among among young
[2:12:24] people
[2:12:25] and everything else let me just tell you
[2:12:27] something even when you or me or anybody
[2:12:29] else
[2:12:30] you come to the lord let me tell you
[2:12:31] what had to happen the gospel of jesus
[2:12:34] christ went forth and it cast off the
[2:12:37] devils
[2:12:38] because the devils are what we're
[2:12:39] telling you wait longer
[2:12:42] hold on this isn't for you look what
[2:12:44] you're going to have to give up
[2:12:45] look like what's he trying to do
[2:12:47] proposition the world
[2:12:49] but there's a greater reality taking
[2:12:52] place
[2:12:53] the love of god is pulling on that life
[2:12:59] what's happening god's casting out that
[2:13:01] devil
[2:13:03] might have been a drunken devil an
[2:13:05] immoral devil homosexual devil whatever
[2:13:08] that devil is
[2:13:09] he deals with that devil that unbelief
[2:13:12] that's in the light you might be as pure
[2:13:14] as a lily but unbelief is still ravaging
[2:13:16] through your heart there's a god who
[2:13:19] deals with that devil
[2:13:20] there's a god who meets that devil face
[2:13:23] to face
[2:13:25] in my name they shall cast out devils
[2:13:28] [Music]
[2:13:31] it's his word the authority of his life
[2:13:35] taking a hold of another life what is it
[2:13:37] it's not
[2:13:38] it's not out of fear it's a love affair
[2:13:46] let me just stop right here
[2:13:49] i want to just say this to you if you
[2:13:52] think i'm preaching if you think this
[2:13:54] right here
[2:13:55] is just for people who don't have the
[2:13:57] holy ghost let me
[2:13:58] let me dial you in a little bit right
[2:14:00] this is not just for people who don't
[2:14:02] have the holy ghost
[2:14:04] it's for those of us have already passed
[2:14:06] from death unto life
[2:14:08] it's that you can look at you're seeing
[2:14:09] the ground that you're standing on
[2:14:12] and if there is let me tell you
[2:14:13] something if there is condemnation in
[2:14:15] your life
[2:14:16] if there's something that's hindering
[2:14:18] make it right
[2:14:20] if it's something between you and
[2:14:22] somebody else or something
[2:14:23] make it right why so you can be in
[2:14:26] position
[2:14:28] to receive from god you see this is what
[2:14:31] this is where when abraham went up there
[2:14:33] to mount moriah
[2:14:35] brother braham said he walked up there
[2:14:37] and here was isaac
[2:14:39] one who had been raised from the dead
[2:14:42] he received him as one from the dead he
[2:14:44] believed he would likewise brother
[2:14:45] graham said
[2:14:46] and how about you and i we were once
[2:14:48] dead in sin and trespasses
[2:14:50] but now are we alive in christ jesus how
[2:14:53] are we heading
[2:14:54] into this rapture because we've been
[2:14:56] positioned
[2:14:57] in christ by the new birth
[2:15:02] love brings faith love cast out fear
[2:15:07] love what does it do as god brings his
[2:15:11] word
[2:15:12] it leads to a place of the rotting away
[2:15:16] of the desires in that life
[2:15:20] this is where it takes the mercy of god
[2:15:22] working
[2:15:23] this is why listen this is why we want
[2:15:25] an atmosphere
[2:15:26] right here in the church it isn't just
[2:15:28] something that's on me it's on every one
[2:15:29] of us
[2:15:30] this is why that even in our life of how
[2:15:32] that we live our life
[2:15:34] outside of church this is why that even
[2:15:36] as we come to the house of god
[2:15:37] coming to the house of god is just not
[2:15:38] about you
[2:15:40] when you come here well you know i just
[2:15:42] barely made it
[2:15:43] you're still living for yourself i hate
[2:15:46] to say it that way but sometimes you
[2:15:47] need your toes stepped on
[2:15:49] if you're just praise god everybody clap
[2:15:52] for me i just made it to church today
[2:15:55] shame on you it ought to been something
[2:15:57] you were looking forward to
[2:16:00] bro samuel you don't know what i've been
[2:16:02] through let me tell you something
[2:16:03] you can look all around this room there
[2:16:05] are different ones that could say
[2:16:07] the same thing they might be feeling
[2:16:10] lower than this rug
[2:16:11] down discouraged but there's something
[2:16:14] that's there
[2:16:15] that says god i am trusting in you
[2:16:18] something is going to come my way that's
[2:16:21] going to encourage me
[2:16:22] today there's something that's going to
[2:16:25] minister
[2:16:26] to my life brother when you come with
[2:16:28] that kind of an expectation
[2:16:30] you're making yourself available that
[2:16:32] the pillar of fire
[2:16:34] can move freely right here among us
[2:16:38] listen there's lives that need to be
[2:16:40] born again
[2:16:41] of all ages hearts that need to be
[2:16:44] changed
[2:16:46] lives we want an atmosphere of that of
[2:16:48] an atmosphere
[2:16:50] where the holy spirit is free to move
[2:16:52] truly the word creates an atmosphere
[2:16:55] but we want to be receptacles we want to
[2:16:58] be lives
[2:16:59] that the word can fall into we want to
[2:17:01] come here and say god
[2:17:03] it's like when you walk through those
[2:17:04] doors this is a place
[2:17:06] you know hey this is the maternity ward
[2:17:08] this is a place where babies are born
[2:17:10] this is a pla in that right in a
[2:17:12] hospital you know what
[2:17:14] floor is the floor where babies are born
[2:17:16] they got different kinds of furniture
[2:17:17] there
[2:17:18] the walls are painted a little different
[2:17:20] it's made of a place maybe
[2:17:21] seemingly to be more conducive to birth
[2:17:24] brother and sister
[2:17:25] it ain't the pews or the pads on the
[2:17:26] pews or even the lights
[2:17:28] but it's the atmosphere of almighty god
[2:17:32] that it creates the place that you know
[2:17:34] there's something here
[2:17:36] there's one here that's greater than the
[2:17:38] temple
[2:17:39] there's one that's greater
[2:17:44] [Music]
[2:17:46] love brings faith
[2:17:50] brings confidence brings strength
[2:17:54] it brings assurance that things that you
[2:17:56] would have to face or
[2:17:58] what you do have to face or what we
[2:17:59] faced or what we've went through
[2:18:02] it gives us confidence he said
[2:18:05] he'd never leave me nor forsake me
