[36:56] men which were bidden shall taste of my
[36:58] supper
[36:59] amen you may be seated
[37:01] i'd like to speak on tonight is the
[37:03] invitation
[37:07] jesus has given this
[37:10] parable which is
[37:12] of truth
[37:14] an invitation
[37:16] to a great supper
[37:18] and this is jesus is actually speaking
[37:21] in this in a spiritual way
[37:23] of what has actually taken place and has
[37:26] taken place all down through
[37:29] time
[37:30] every time that there was a message that
[37:33] god sent to be delivered to the people
[37:35] it was an invitation
[37:37] for them to
[37:38] to accept it for escape for
[37:41] uh salvation
[37:43] in the days of noah
[37:45] god gave a message to noah it's going to
[37:47] rain
[37:48] but the people rejected that message
[37:51] they had excuses for why they shouldn't
[37:54] believe it it's there's never been
[37:56] waterfall from the sky before brother
[37:58] branham said they could shoot rockets up
[38:00] into the sky and say there's no moisture
[38:03] up there
[38:04] and uh
[38:05] you know they
[38:07] you know they were of great
[38:09] intelligence back then
[38:11] we many times when they betrayed noah's
[38:14] time being portrayed as being very
[38:16] primitive but brother branham said they
[38:18] were really advanced
[38:21] and said that it was an atomic explosion
[38:23] that caused the earth to go off its axis
[38:27] and caused the the flood
[38:30] and uh but they they had excuses why not
[38:34] to believe noah in the days of moses
[38:37] they had excuses in the days of elijah
[38:39] they had excuses in the days of christ
[38:42] they had excuses of why not to believe
[38:45] it didn't he didn't come the way they
[38:47] thought he would
[38:49] they had took the the the word the
[38:52] prophecies and they had so molded them
[38:55] till they didn't no longer represent the
[38:57] truth
[38:58] and and they overlooked the little
[39:02] things that were the great things
[39:05] a virgin shall conceive and bring forth
[39:07] the sun
[39:11] sure they didn't understand it but the
[39:14] thing is it was still there and it
[39:16] happened they weren't even looking for
[39:19] it to happen
[39:20] and when when
[39:22] jesus came on the scene he was rejected
[39:26] and despised
[39:29] and they made excuses
[39:31] why they didn't have to accept him well
[39:33] he was illegitimate
[39:35] isn't he just
[39:36] the son of joseph a carpenter
[39:40] you know there's
[39:41] who's this man who is he to tell us
[39:47] they always make excuses people
[39:51] today make excuses why they can't come
[39:54] why they can't come to church
[39:56] well it's too hot well i'm too tired
[39:59] well i you know i've got this or that
[40:02] going on
[40:12] they don't come
[40:13] they find excuses just like they have
[40:15] all down through the ages
[40:18] religious
[40:19] systems in the day of brother branham
[40:22] they found excuses why not to accept his
[40:24] message
[40:26] he's illiterate
[40:29] he doesn't have any
[40:31] schooling or training
[40:35] the things he's saying doesn't make any
[40:37] sense according to our what we have in
[40:41] our religion
[40:42] it it we don't agree with that that's a
[40:44] bunch of nonsense
[40:47] people shouting and dancing and all this
[40:49] stuff remember his mother-in-law called
[40:51] him a bunch of trash
[40:54] people about like that
[40:57] but those are the ones that god speaks
[40:59] to according to this parable
[41:02] the nobodies the trash
[41:10] look how far
[41:11] brother branham said look how far the
[41:13] religious systems have sunk
[41:16] he said the baptists allow smoking
[41:20] take smoke breaks
[41:23] lebron was speaking to this in in 1963
[41:27] what about today
[41:30] today the holiness move
[41:33] they wear pants to church and pant suits
[41:35] and and
[41:37] all kinds of ungodly clothes
[41:39] and they're supposed to be holy
[41:42] they're supposed to believe in holiness
[41:48] they've sunk why because they rejected
[41:51] the message when it was sent
[41:58] he said those that turned down the
[42:00] invitation they would never taste of his
[42:02] supper
[42:03] pardon me
[42:05] my mouth's a little dry tonight
[42:11] when
[42:13] god sends the holy ghost and knocks it a
[42:15] man's heart he deliberately turns it
[42:17] down
[42:19] one time he's going to turn it down for
[42:20] his last time
[42:23] it's going to be his last opportunity
[42:26] people go you know there are people who
[42:28] go and sit in church and they listen to
[42:30] the gospel
[42:31] and they agree with the gospel
[42:34] and
[42:35] and they might say well i know it's
[42:36] right
[42:38] but they never lift a hand
[42:40] or a finger to help it along
[42:44] and
[42:45] they they listen to it and they say well
[42:47] i believe it's right
[42:49] but that's just sympathizing with it
[42:55] they come they attend church they they
[42:57] do you know maybe they even give tithe
[43:00] an offering who knows
[43:02] but they never move in and actually have
[43:05] an experience with god
[43:09] they're just sympathizing with it
[43:13] what's the reason for not moving on in
[43:16] and actually accepting the holy ghost
[43:20] well i don't want to give up that and i
[43:21] don't want to give up this
[43:26] they don't want to come under headship
[43:29] headship not not of a man
[43:31] but headship of god
[43:37] it would be
[43:38] like i i would
[43:41] pick up this bottle of water and you'd
[43:43] say yeah i know that's water there
[43:47] and but you'd never drink it
[43:49] that's the same thing i know the gospel
[43:51] is right but you never really partake of
[43:54] it you never become one with it
[43:56] according to the book of revelations
[43:59] we're supposed to eat the book
[44:02] we're supposed to become one with the
[44:04] message
[44:05] we're supposed to become the message
[44:09] written epistles read of all men
[44:16] when you reject the
[44:17] random says when they reject their day
[44:19] of visitation it separates them from god
[44:24] they you know what
[44:27] what is it
[44:29] that is so great about their life or
[44:32] this world
[44:34] that they would turn down eternal life
[44:39] or do they think that well you know i
[44:41] think i can squeeze in
[44:44] it's like it's like some kids in school
[44:48] they never put forth no effort
[44:50] they think well if i can just squeeze
[44:52] through with a c
[44:53] some say well you know a d is still
[44:55] passing
[44:56] if i can squeeze through but it isn't
[44:58] going to be that way
[45:00] you're not just you're not just going to
[45:02] make it in
[45:05] you you've got to be sold out
[45:08] totally committed
[45:10] receive the invitation
[45:12] and i'll tell you something friends
[45:15] according to this parable as we'll
[45:17] looked and break it down
[45:19] they couldn't say well i'll tell you
[45:20] what i'll go some to somebody else's
[45:23] supper
[45:25] no they were bidden to this supper
[45:28] there have been to this message they are
[45:31] been to this word they can't say well i
[45:34] i'll go to this other denominational
[45:36] church that's not where the bidding was
[45:40] the bidding was come out of her my
[45:42] people and be not a partaker of her sins
[45:46] [Applause]
[45:49] well i don't i don't think i want to go
[45:51] to church here or church there so i'll
[45:53] just start my own church
[45:55] i'm gonna tell you something to get the
[45:57] cart before the horse
[46:01] i've seen many churches started by lay
[46:03] people
[46:05] god ain't in it
[46:07] that's not the way he does it
[46:11] that that's that's like having a chicken
[46:13] with no head as the brother said last
[46:15] thursday
[46:21] some kind of excuse
[46:25] but you know what this message
[46:28] it's been proven to be right
[46:31] it's been vindicated
[46:40] you know in the old testament
[46:43] if somebody was a slave
[46:46] every 50 years they had a year of
[46:48] jubilee
[46:49] and they would sound a trumpet
[46:52] and when they heard the trumpet
[46:54] they had been a slaver and servants who
[46:56] they they could be free
[46:59] but if they rejected the message
[47:02] then a hole was born in their ear to
[47:05] represent that no matter how many more
[47:07] times they might hear that they could
[47:10] not go free and that's the way it is in
[47:13] every age and the way it is in this age
[47:17] they reject the message then it doesn't
[47:19] matter no matter how many more times
[47:21] they hear it
[47:25] i know that god gives people like me
[47:28] like many of you he gives his
[47:30] opportunity after opportunity after
[47:32] opportunity but sooner or later the
[47:34] opportunities are going to run out
[47:39] you hear service after service you know
[47:42] what it is
[47:43] it you're being bitten to come to this
[47:45] supper
[47:47] we're going to a great suffer
[47:49] we're going to the marriage supper of
[47:51] the lamb
[47:52] and every service you come what you're
[47:54] hearing is an invitation to come to that
[47:58] supper to come and be part of it be part
[48:00] of the rapture
[48:06] you refuse it
[48:09] says when when
[48:11] you refuse the seal of god
[48:15] you accept the mark of the beast
[48:18] and he said a lot of people are looking
[48:20] for the mark of the beast to come he
[48:21] said but it's already here
[48:23] the moment the holy ghost started
[48:25] falling the mark of the beast did too
[48:31] brother branham talked about his his uh
[48:34] hope's
[48:35] uh stepfather
[48:38] and the stepfather said to him said he
[48:41] didn't believe in that that stuff of the
[48:43] holy ghost and all that
[48:46] and he he said some awful things about
[48:49] it
[48:50] brother brown said he died immediately
[49:04] one day
[49:06] jesus is going to come
[49:09] and when he does all those that's
[49:10] rejected the invitation they're going to
[49:12] be left behind
[49:15] those that have received it been born
[49:18] again
[49:19] baptized in the holy spirit
[49:22] they're going to receive a body change
[49:24] they're going to be caught up
[49:29] and i'm going to tell you something
[49:30] friends
[49:31] they're going to be loved ones left
[49:32] behind
[49:34] there's going to be friends and
[49:35] associates left behind
[49:37] because they rejected to take the
[49:41] invitation
[49:44] i said just coming to church ain't
[49:45] enough
[49:48] you've got to become one with christ
[49:51] that's what the invitation is for
[49:59] today is the day of salvation
[50:04] god has never sent a message in any age
[50:07] what he didn't come down and vindicated
[50:11] but you know what happened in the days
[50:12] of noah
[50:19] god bid noah to come into the ark and
[50:21] god shut the door
[50:28] and then there was what was it seven
[50:30] days
[50:31] nothing happened
[50:36] he preached to the eternally lost
[50:43] now there was the invitation was over
[50:46] the door had been shut
[50:51] brother branham talked about
[50:53] that there would come a time
[50:55] when the door would be shut and the
[50:57] gospel preached and he said part of the
[50:59] god of the third pool was preaching to
[51:01] the souls that could no longer receive
[51:04] the invitation
[51:06] because they rejected it they rejected
[51:08] their day of visitation
[51:21] turn me to second thessalonians
[51:25] chapter
[51:27] two
[51:28] verse begin at verse three
[51:35] let no man deceive you by any means
[51:38] for that day shall not come
[51:41] except there come of falling away first
[51:45] and that man of sin be revealed the son
[51:47] of perdition
[51:51] we see people leaving the message
[51:54] we see not just people
[51:57] we see preachers
[52:00] preachers that people thought a lot of
[52:03] thought if anybody's got it they got it
[52:06] if anybody believes that they believe it
[52:10] churches
[52:13] entire assemblies
[52:16] leaving the message
[52:18] and i've been saying this will no longer
[52:20] be called a message church
[52:26] it's that falling away that's happening
[52:27] before the son of perdition is to be
[52:29] revealed
[52:35] it lets you know where we're at on god's
[52:37] timeline
[52:40] this is this is the time
[52:43] when people are turning their backs and
[52:45] falling away
[52:53] kids that have group people who have
[52:56] grew up as children in the message
[52:59] turning their backs and walking away
[53:04] go out and join some denomination
[53:07] why so they can cut their hair wear
[53:09] their makeup wear their pants and and
[53:11] their shorts and all these other things
[53:20] make statements like well
[53:22] you know
[53:23] if if there wouldn't be no message if
[53:26] there wasn't a william branham no
[53:28] kidding
[53:34] that's why god sent him
[53:39] and god god didn't send some
[53:41] intellectual
[53:44] he didn't send somebody with the lld or
[53:46] dd behind his name
[53:49] he didn't in the days of jesus christ
[53:52] either
[53:54] he sent a humble person
[53:57] he sent an uneducated person
[54:01] he sent a person look friends
[54:03] moses was educated but brother branham
[54:06] said god sent him out in the desert to
[54:08] beat the education out of him
[54:11] he had to forget everything he learned
[54:13] paul was an educated man but god told
[54:16] him and paul spoke of it he had to
[54:18] forget all that he
[54:22] learned god in this day sent a humble
[54:27] hillbilly
[54:33] as i said on sunday this message was not
[54:36] delivered with enticing words of men's
[54:38] wisdom
[54:40] but power and demonstration
[54:54] paul said that day will not come except
[54:57] they're coming falling away first before
[54:59] the man of sin be revealed
[55:02] he that seth in the temple of god
[55:04] holding himself all that's above god
[55:07] he has god forgiving sins on the earth
[55:10] and so forth
[55:12] but it can't happen until the falling
[55:14] away until the church begin to get away
[55:17] from the spiritual feast
[55:19] draw itself back and organize itself
[55:22] and then the revelation didn't stay with
[55:24] the church
[55:29] you know what it is
[55:31] you see you see these people who fall
[55:33] away from the message they were never
[55:35] born again
[55:37] i don't care if they were preachers i
[55:39] don't care how well knowing they were i
[55:41] don't care how many conventions they
[55:42] held or how many camp meetings they had
[55:45] they were never born again
[55:47] because if they'd had been born again
[55:48] they would have been in christ
[55:51] and they'd never
[55:52] never if you're born again you could
[55:54] never turn your back on the message
[56:04] you know what they are they're false
[56:06] teachers
[56:08] false anointed ones
[56:12] and you know what they bring brother
[56:13] branham said they bring false births
[56:18] among the people
[56:24] how in the world do you think a church
[56:26] people can sit there and get born again
[56:29] if the leadership isn't born again
[56:35] just saying the words born again don't
[56:37] mean anything
[56:39] we've seen that back in the what the 80s
[56:42] it became so popular to say born again
[56:47] and yet they went out and and and
[56:49] committed adultery and everything else
[56:56] got on tv and cried makeup running
[56:58] everywhere and they're born again
[57:07] the bride
[57:09] is going to be taken away
[57:11] before that man of sin is revealed
[57:16] before
[57:18] the incarnation
[57:21] of satan
[57:22] in a man
[57:23] the bride's going to be taken away
[57:27] friends i'm so glad
[57:30] that that there was an invitation given
[57:32] to me
[57:38] hallelujah
[57:42] i like that song
[57:44] that the young brother is saying he
[57:46] didn't have to open my eyes
[57:49] he could have easily passed me by
[57:52] for the age i was living in
[57:55] was wretched poor and blind
[57:59] but i heard recognizing
[58:01] your day
[58:04] serpent seed in perfect faith
[58:08] the breach the message of grace
[58:11] oh hallelujah
[58:14] they weren't just tapes
[58:17] they weren't just sermons that had been
[58:19] recorded of a man who was dead
[58:21] but it was life
[58:24] speaking word
[58:29] and he didn't die
[58:31] when brother branham died
[58:35] god sent a five-fold ministry
[58:38] and we still have the five-fold ministry
[58:48] we've got people who say well all of a
[58:50] sudden you know
[58:52] uh
[58:53] they're gonna get real religious
[58:55] they've known about the message been in
[58:56] and out of church
[58:59] but now all of a sudden they believe
[59:00] that joseph branham is a
[59:02] prophet so now they're going to gather
[59:05] together
[59:06] and they're going to sign on
[59:09] and hear the message played over in
[59:11] jeffersonville look friends i'm not
[59:13] against brother joseph or the message
[59:15] being played but i'm going to tell you
[59:17] something
[59:18] people saying they're going to form
[59:20] their own churches and going to
[59:22] whatever stream or satellite in that
[59:27] that's of satan
[59:30] they're blind
[59:32] and then and when the blind lead the
[59:35] blind they'll both fall in the ditch
[59:45] the bride leaves
[59:48] you think about it they're they're
[59:50] waiting around there's people waiting
[59:52] around friends look brother man i'm
[59:54] talking about
[59:55] the light in every age he talked about
[59:57] uh
[59:58] luther you know coming out of the
[1:00:00] catholic church martin luther
[1:00:02] and that was the light for the day but
[1:00:04] then the people after he left the people
[1:00:06] organized
[1:00:07] and they became a religion that is so
[1:00:10] similar to the catholic religion that
[1:00:12] you really can't even tell the
[1:00:14] difference
[1:00:19] and then then you had all the baptists
[1:00:22] and the presbyterians and all these
[1:00:24] other religions and brother branham said
[1:00:25] you know what they're not churches
[1:00:29] he said they're lodges
[1:00:32] and that's the excuse he says they give
[1:00:36] well i'm a baptist
[1:00:38] we don't believe in such things as that
[1:00:41] i'm pentecostal we don't believe in such
[1:00:44] things as serpent seed
[1:00:47] that's their excuse they they don't give
[1:00:50] excuse like necessarily like well i
[1:00:52] bought a cow and i gotta go see if if
[1:00:54] she'll work or give milk or whatever
[1:00:59] those are just examples
[1:01:03] i don't know about the man who got
[1:01:04] married and couldn't come
[1:01:07] i don't know what the problem was there
[1:01:10] maybe she told him he couldn't
[1:01:17] but they don't they don't give excuses
[1:01:19] necessarily like that but what they give
[1:01:20] is excuses of we've learned better than
[1:01:23] that
[1:01:27] i went to a wedding one time
[1:01:30] of a of a friend
[1:01:32] and heard the preacher that was
[1:01:34] performing the ceremony
[1:01:36] he got up and he read about
[1:01:39] as christ is the head of the church with
[1:01:41] the husband of the head of the wife and
[1:01:42] all that and then he took about 15 20
[1:01:44] minutes to explain
[1:01:47] that that no longer applied
[1:01:50] that that was paul only said that
[1:01:52] because back then women weren't educated
[1:01:55] but today they are
[1:01:58] and he took that time to explain all
[1:02:00] that away
[1:02:07] friends look
[1:02:09] i don't believe the wives are your
[1:02:11] servants
[1:02:14] i believe you need to get in there and
[1:02:15] help out too
[1:02:18] i did we were having when we had
[1:02:20] children i got in and helped too
[1:02:23] it wasn't all thrown off on her
[1:02:28] they weren't her kids they were our kids
[1:02:33] i wasn't one of those men said well i go
[1:02:35] out and work and that's all i gotta do
[1:02:43] well i don't know where that came from
[1:02:47] turn me to second thessalonians chapter
[1:02:48] 2.
[1:02:55] ii thessalonians chapter 2 let's begin
[1:02:57] reading verses verses 10 through 12.
[1:03:03] and with all deceivableness of
[1:03:05] unrighteousness in them that perish
[1:03:08] because they receive not the love of the
[1:03:10] truth that they might be saved
[1:03:12] and for this cause god shall send them
[1:03:15] strong delusion that they believe a lie
[1:03:19] that all
[1:03:21] might be damned who believed not the
[1:03:23] truth but had pleasure in
[1:03:25] unrighteousness
[1:03:35] they believe they're right
[1:03:40] you know what brother branham said he
[1:03:41] said
[1:03:42] they wanted
[1:03:45] they wanted something
[1:03:47] they wanted a delusion
[1:03:50] so god sent them one
[1:03:53] he sent he allowed me just like friends
[1:03:56] in the day
[1:03:57] when ahab and jehoshaphat were there and
[1:04:00] deciding whether they were going to go
[1:04:02] down to raymond gilead
[1:04:04] and the bible says that god said
[1:04:07] how can we get ahab to go down to rameth
[1:04:10] gilead that he might be killed
[1:04:12] and said a lion's spirit came up out of
[1:04:15] hell and said i'll go down and be a lie
[1:04:17] in their prophet's mouths and god sent
[1:04:21] that evil spirit down there to persuade
[1:04:24] ahab and god has allowed evil spirits to
[1:04:28] go into preachers to persuade the people
[1:04:32] bring a strong delusion to them about
[1:04:35] how well this didn't happen the thing
[1:04:38] with the bridge and the people that
[1:04:40] never took place the thing with the the
[1:04:42] halo brother man it being caught up in
[1:04:44] the cloud that never happened
[1:04:47] and the people are believing this
[1:04:50] and not only they believe it but they
[1:04:52] got to get on the internet and say all
[1:04:54] kinds of evil things about the message
[1:05:04] and you say
[1:05:05] well why are they getting on there doing
[1:05:06] that so that people can read it
[1:05:09] that are not part of the message
[1:05:13] but are sitting in message churches
[1:05:16] they can read it so they'll leave
[1:05:19] and paul said they went out from us
[1:05:21] because they were not part of us
[1:05:28] that's why god's allowed a strong
[1:05:30] delusion
[1:05:31] and they believe the right
[1:05:39] brother abraham said try to tell a woman
[1:05:40] that speaks in tongues you know believes
[1:05:43] that that's initial evidence the holy
[1:05:44] ghost try to tell her she don't got the
[1:05:46] holy ghost
[1:05:52] they believed a strong delusion
[1:06:06] said they're so blind rejected the truth
[1:06:08] the truth was set before them they
[1:06:10] walked away from it left it
[1:06:12] and now they've been given over to a
[1:06:14] strong delusion to believe a lie and be
[1:06:17] damned with it
[1:06:18] that's exactly what it is the antichrist
[1:06:21] takes all
[1:06:24] and the bible said he would deceive all
[1:06:26] a double l
[1:06:27] all upon the face of the earth whose
[1:06:29] names were not written under those seals
[1:06:32] from the foundation of the world
[1:06:44] i'm glad my name was wrote there
[1:06:46] i'm glad that when those chills was open
[1:06:49] god opened the revelation to me it
[1:06:50] called my name
[1:06:52] [Applause]
[1:06:54] it woke something in me
[1:06:59] friends look
[1:07:01] my parents came into the message
[1:07:03] when i was a little boy
[1:07:05] so for the majority of my youth i was
[1:07:09] raised around the message
[1:07:11] in message churches
[1:07:14] but i still needed a born to get
[1:07:16] experience
[1:07:21] it didn't matter what it doesn't matter
[1:07:23] what your mom and daddy had
[1:07:26] and i'm going to tell you something
[1:07:27] you're not going to get in because your
[1:07:28] mama loves you
[1:07:34] well i'll be all right my mama loves me
[1:07:37] and all and brother branham said all
[1:07:40] that you ever loved and never loved you
[1:07:41] is going to be there
[1:07:49] brother branham saw his horse
[1:07:52] and he saw his dog
[1:07:55] and then the spirit spoke to him and
[1:07:56] said all that you ever and he was
[1:07:58] surprised to see his horse and dog there
[1:08:01] he says all you ever loved and loved you
[1:08:03] is gonna be there
[1:08:05] and people turn that around to mean you
[1:08:08] can live like the devil but if your mama
[1:08:10] loves you you're gonna be there
[1:08:16] they take quotes like from uh the
[1:08:19] mother's day message
[1:08:21] where brother adam says your family will
[1:08:23] be with you gathered there
[1:08:26] but then brother brahms asked a question
[1:08:28] and questions and answers says
[1:08:30] uh will will my family be there he says
[1:08:34] if they come and receive this and born
[1:08:37] again yeah they will be
[1:08:50] they read the bible the same as any
[1:08:52] other man brother branham says this in
[1:08:54] the message of indictment
[1:08:56] but they turned down the spirit of god
[1:08:58] till the bible said they're given over
[1:08:59] to a strong delusion to believe a lie
[1:09:01] and be damned by it
[1:09:03] they actually believe they're right and
[1:09:06] the bible says
[1:09:07] they would believe it and be damned by
[1:09:09] the same lie that they believed to be
[1:09:11] the truth
[1:09:13] therefore i indict you by the word of
[1:09:15] god you are teaching the people in error
[1:09:18] and crucifying the principal christ of
[1:09:20] holiness and life above that the person
[1:09:23] might walk out in the street and be a
[1:09:25] different person
[1:09:32] we all know the parable
[1:09:35] of the foolish virgins the wise virgins
[1:09:38] and the foolish virgins
[1:09:42] brother madam said you all right you
[1:09:43] remember brother byron said watch when
[1:09:45] russia goes for the oil well we've seen
[1:09:48] that happen but brotherhood also said
[1:09:50] watch when the foolish virgins go for
[1:09:52] the oil
[1:09:53] speaking spiritually
[1:09:56] when they
[1:09:57] go to saying well you know what
[1:10:00] maybe we do need that holy ghost
[1:10:04] maybe we do need that experience
[1:10:09] and the bible says they'll come and say
[1:10:11] well give us some of your
[1:10:14] oil he said no not so
[1:10:18] but you got to go and get it to those
[1:10:20] who sell it
[1:10:22] brother branham says it this way
[1:10:25] he says if you want some
[1:10:27] go pray up
[1:10:32] there's a true bride
[1:10:35] the true bride will be made up of
[1:10:37] thousands times thousands of people
[1:10:41] but it will be the elect out of every
[1:10:42] church age every time a message was sent
[1:10:45] forth the people believed and accepted
[1:10:47] it in all the light
[1:10:49] that it was
[1:10:51] and then they were sealed away until the
[1:10:53] day of redemption
[1:10:59] sleeping virgins are waking up
[1:11:05] brother venom says watch them that's
[1:11:07] left behind here on the earth
[1:11:14] what they'll have to go through with
[1:11:16] they'll be weeping and wailing and
[1:11:18] national teeth for the dragon rome
[1:11:21] spurted water out of his mouth to make
[1:11:23] war with the remnant
[1:11:25] of the woman's seed that was left upon
[1:11:27] the earth after the bride was selected
[1:11:29] and took out
[1:11:30] and the dragon made war with the remnant
[1:11:33] they didn't want to come in and was
[1:11:34] hunted down
[1:11:36] the real church
[1:11:39] and the real church
[1:11:40] would go through that if it was possible
[1:11:42] you see but they're done under the blood
[1:11:44] by the grace of christ
[1:11:46] and it will not go through it have no
[1:11:48] tribulation period
[1:11:50] the next thing for the church is the
[1:11:51] rapture
[1:11:55] but there's going to be those
[1:11:57] that didn't receive it
[1:12:00] they were virgins
[1:12:02] in other words they lived a good life
[1:12:04] they were pure
[1:12:09] they were modest
[1:12:12] they were
[1:12:13] holy according to man's standards
[1:12:17] but failed to go all the way in
[1:12:21] and the great dragon will make war on
[1:12:23] them
[1:12:26] the prophet said they'll have to seal
[1:12:28] their testimony in their own blood
[1:12:30] because they didn't come under the blood
[1:12:34] to come under the blood friends it's not
[1:12:35] just to say i accept jesus as my savior
[1:12:39] but it's to believe the message that god
[1:12:42] sent
[1:12:50] it wasn't enough in the days of moses
[1:12:52] for him to say
[1:12:53] i believe what moses said no they had to
[1:12:56] come under the message of the hour
[1:12:58] which was put the blood on the doorpost
[1:13:12] the days of jesus brother branham says
[1:13:14] israel wouldn't believe
[1:13:17] it was said on sunday what good could
[1:13:19] come out of nazareth
[1:13:21] an evil place
[1:13:27] they didn't want to believe it but
[1:13:29] you know what the common people the
[1:13:32] bible says hurt him gladly
[1:13:39] brother brahms speaks about a time
[1:13:42] you're familiar with when he got an
[1:13:44] invitation to go down to mexico
[1:13:47] and hold meetings
[1:13:49] and he said there was a general
[1:13:52] valdena
[1:13:53] that
[1:13:55] had been up in the united states been in
[1:13:57] one of his meetings
[1:13:59] and humbly came down to the altar and
[1:14:01] accepted jesus christ and accepted the
[1:14:04] message of the hour
[1:14:06] and he went back to mexico
[1:14:08] and he kept pulling on brother branham
[1:14:10] wanting him to come and hold hold
[1:14:12] meetings in mexico
[1:14:16] finally brother branham saw a vision
[1:14:19] and and knew then he was supposed to go
[1:14:21] and so brother branham told him i'll
[1:14:22] come
[1:14:23] and so the general
[1:14:25] uh he went to the president
[1:14:28] of mexico
[1:14:30] and the president said yes let's bring
[1:14:32] him
[1:14:33] and so then
[1:14:35] uh a great bishop of the catholic church
[1:14:38] heard about it
[1:14:40] and he came and said
[1:14:42] what are you doing you can't this man's
[1:14:44] a protestant you can't bring him in here
[1:14:48] that's never been done by the government
[1:14:50] ever
[1:14:52] and the president said well we're going
[1:14:53] to do it now
[1:14:56] and he said you can't do that
[1:14:59] and he says look he says general this
[1:15:02] general
[1:15:03] vouches for this man
[1:15:05] and he says thousands will come out to
[1:15:08] the meeting
[1:15:10] and he says and the bishop said you know
[1:15:13] what kind of
[1:15:14] people it'll be that'll come out just
[1:15:16] the ignorant ones the ones that goes
[1:15:19] that's the ones that go here personal
[1:15:21] like that
[1:15:24] and the president said to him sir you've
[1:15:26] had them for 500 years why are they
[1:15:28] still ignorant
[1:15:34] so they brought brother branham in
[1:15:36] they they got a big arena
[1:15:39] and they had to lower him in by ropes to
[1:15:42] get him in there because he was still
[1:15:44] packed
[1:15:47] and he was there preaching night after
[1:15:49] night and had prayer lines
[1:15:51] people with prayer cards
[1:15:55] and there was a young lady brother
[1:15:58] branham said she was about 25 years old
[1:16:01] had her first child
[1:16:03] and it had died at nine o'clock that
[1:16:05] morning
[1:16:06] and she came that night
[1:16:09] and she was holding that dead baby
[1:16:11] and she was trying to get up to the
[1:16:13] platform and broth brother billy paul
[1:16:15] come to his brother brandon he says
[1:16:17] daddy says we've got 300 ushers down
[1:16:20] there and they can't hold this little
[1:16:22] bitty woman
[1:16:24] said she goes under the legs climbs over
[1:16:26] the top of them on while she's holding
[1:16:28] this baby
[1:16:30] and we can't keep her back
[1:16:32] said daddy we can't let her up here she
[1:16:34] doesn't have a prayer card
[1:16:35] so if we let her up here without a
[1:16:37] prayer card it'll start a
[1:16:39] ruckus among the people that's been
[1:16:41] waiting here night after night with
[1:16:42] prayer cards
[1:16:44] brother graham said i'll send brother
[1:16:45] moore down there you know he's
[1:16:46] ball-headed like me and maybe she won't
[1:16:49] know the difference and i'll send him
[1:16:50] down there and he can pray for and maybe
[1:16:52] that'll satisfy her
[1:16:54] so they were going to send brother moore
[1:16:56] down there and all of a sudden brother
[1:16:58] brown said he saw
[1:17:00] a mexican baby sitting there laughing
[1:17:03] saw a vision
[1:17:05] he said wait a minute
[1:17:07] he said let her up here
[1:17:10] billy said we can't do that daddy he
[1:17:12] said
[1:17:13] he said but i saw a vision
[1:17:17] let her up here
[1:17:19] and they let her through and she came up
[1:17:21] there and brother branham laid hands on
[1:17:23] that baby wrapped up in a blanket
[1:17:25] and said god i don't know what
[1:17:27] what i saw i don't know what's going to
[1:17:29] happen
[1:17:30] but i know that you wanted me to pray
[1:17:33] for this child
[1:17:35] and all of a sudden the blanket started
[1:17:37] kicking
[1:17:40] hallelujah
[1:17:42] and brother branham said the same thing
[1:17:43] that happened when brother wade fell
[1:17:45] dead in the service and laid hands on
[1:17:48] him said the same thing happened again
[1:17:51] and the baby came back to life and
[1:17:53] brother branham said i want he sent a
[1:17:55] brother brother espinoza said go down
[1:17:57] there to the doctor that she took that
[1:17:59] baby to and i want a sworn affidavit
[1:18:02] that that baby was dead
[1:18:05] and so they took him down there and got
[1:18:06] a statement from the doctor the baby had
[1:18:08] died been pronounced dead nine o'clock
[1:18:11] that morning from pneumonia
[1:18:13] and here it was some 12 hours later the
[1:18:16] baby had come back to life
[1:18:22] a baby that was dead 12 hours comes back
[1:18:25] to life
[1:18:28] because the little mama had faith if i
[1:18:30] can just get to the prophet
[1:18:33] if i can just get there she they didn't
[1:18:36] even speak the same language
[1:18:40] but she believed that she could get up
[1:18:41] their baby and come back to life
[1:18:46] and god honored her faith
[1:18:55] she was just a common person
[1:19:03] she wasn't some rich person she was a
[1:19:05] poor person
[1:19:14] hallelujah
[1:19:20] brother brown said they interviewed him
[1:19:24] because they couldn't keep this quiet
[1:19:25] after that baby had been brought back to
[1:19:27] life
[1:19:28] they interviewed him
[1:19:30] being a catholic nation they said do you
[1:19:31] think one of our saints could do this
[1:19:33] brother man says if they're alive
[1:19:39] brother brandon was interviewed by a
[1:19:41] news reporter a woman
[1:19:44] and
[1:19:45] she come and said i want to ask you
[1:19:47] questions about your religion
[1:19:50] and she told him she said
[1:19:52] if i had to associate with that bunch of
[1:19:54] ignoramuses up there
[1:19:56] i wouldn't even want to be a christian
[1:19:59] they say them people's going to rule the
[1:20:01] earth someday she said i hope i'm not
[1:20:03] here
[1:20:04] the other man said don't worry you won't
[1:20:06] be
[1:20:09] she was a catholic
[1:20:14] and
[1:20:15] said

[1:20:24] way the rest of them did before god
[1:20:26] would receive her and you call her the
[1:20:28] mother of god she said that's nonsense
[1:20:31] he said wait a minute it says in the
[1:20:32] bible she said we're not supposed to
[1:20:33] look in the bible
[1:20:35] he said how are you going to know what's
[1:20:36] truth or not then
[1:20:38] say i take my church's word
[1:20:41] he said this is god's word right here
[1:20:44] and i challenge you to look at it and
[1:20:45] mary was with them in the upper room and
[1:20:47] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:20:49] like the rest of them did
[1:20:51] and you call her the mother of god then
[1:20:53] call that bunch of a bunch of trash and
[1:20:56] backwash don't worry you won't be there

[1:23:36] let me just draw you a picture if i can
[1:23:38] in a moment the great white throne
[1:23:40] judgment
[1:23:42] this is all the raptures took place the
[1:23:44] tribulation periods took place
[1:23:48] the the millennium has took place
[1:23:52] and at the end of the millennium comes
[1:23:54] the great white throne judgment
[1:23:57] and then the bible says that all the
[1:24:00] dead will come back to life
[1:24:03] the sea will give forth its dead the
[1:24:05] earth will give forth its dead
[1:24:07] and they all stand before the judgment
[1:24:09] seat of christ
[1:24:12] how could they stand there
[1:24:15] and offer an excuse
[1:24:17] for why they didn't receive the
[1:24:19] invitation in their day
[1:24:21] but the bible says they will
[1:24:27] he says they'll come up there and
[1:24:29] they'll say
[1:24:31] didn't we cast out devils in thy name
[1:24:34] you know didn't we go to church
[1:24:37] didn't we give our tithe
[1:24:40] didn't we give offerings
[1:24:47] and they're offering an excuse
[1:24:53] brother branham says
[1:24:55] the sky is going to be a great big
[1:24:57] screen
[1:24:59] and their life's going to be played
[1:25:00] before them
[1:25:02] the times that they set in the services
[1:25:06] heard the word
[1:25:08] and walked away from it
[1:25:13] the ones brother said that rejected the
[1:25:15] message
[1:25:16] we asked to give a reason
[1:25:19] what then
[1:25:23] they heard
[1:25:26] and they'll be asked to give a reason
[1:25:28] but then
[1:25:30] going to stand there just as certain as
[1:25:32] this book is written
[1:25:34] they're going to stand there and be
[1:25:35] asked for a reason
[1:25:39] the ones that rejected the message will
[1:25:41] be asked to give a reason
[1:25:44] someday the trumpet will sound for its
[1:25:46] last time
[1:25:48] the bible will lay closed on the pulpit
[1:25:51] and then they'll be asked to give a
[1:25:53] reason for what they've done
