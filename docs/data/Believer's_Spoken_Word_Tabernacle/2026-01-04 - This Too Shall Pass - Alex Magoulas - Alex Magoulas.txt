========================================
We are [music] often destitute of the things that lives demand. Want of food [music] and want of shelter, thirsty hills and [singing] barren lands. But we're trusting [music] in the Lord. For according to his word, we'll [music and singing] understand it better by and by. Oh, by and by. [music] When the [singing] morning comes, when all the saints of God are [music and singing] gathered home, we will tell the story how we [music and singing] overcome.

We certainly couldn't give him what he deserves, but I sure like to try. [laughter] I'd like to let him know a little bit how I feel about it. Amen. I And I believe I'm with people that feel the same way today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we just uh let's just look to him in a word of prayer right now while we're just in this presence. We'll just bow our heads. Oh Lord, we're so blessed. &gt;&gt; Lord, as we've come into this new year and &gt;&gt; we look at the signs of the times all around us. Lord, we're so grateful that we have received a kingdom which cannot be removed. And wow, the world is falling apart and everything's falling into its place. There's a bride that she's there's gravitation is losing its power over her. The world has lost its strength over her. Lord, today we're not looking just for an exodus, but we believe even now by your spirit that you HAVE TRANSLATED US OUT of the powers of darkness into the kingdom of your dear son. And today we're as free as a people could be. Paul and Silas could sit in a jail cell. But they were the freest people &gt;&gt; in Philippi Cesaria that day. &gt;&gt; And Lord, it was deliverance for a jailer. It was a deliverance for his home. And I pray today, Lord, if there be one like that jailer that doesn't know you, Lord, maybe we'd meet one like that jailer after we leave here today. May we be like that man, Paul. May we be like those apostles of old, bearing the gospel of Jesus Christ, showing freedom and liberty, Lord, that this world is not our home, but we're just passing through. And Lord, as we're here now, we just want to take this time to look into your word. I pray something today would be said, not from my ability as a man, but may you take these lips of clay and impart something of eternal value. May it may it broaden our perspective. May help us to see Jesus to see you in a greater way. We pray. I ask you bless now the reading of this word. May you give the context to this text. May it be an overcoming. May it be a a deliverance and a help, a strengthening for your people today. We pray. We commit it now into your hands. You are a faithful creator, the father of lights. There is no variableness or shadow of turning. You what you've purposed for us, you will perform. And we know your plans. You've told us you have plans for us, plans for peace, for an expected end. We look to you now and we thank you in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] And amen. God bless you. Good to be with you all once again this day. We just want to say happy new year. God bless you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We are uh I just uh you know, I'll say this real quick. I was talking to a brother about this a month or two ago. There's some there's uh and now I'm not nitpicking on anybody here, but you know, some brothers were talking about their trials and things that they go through and stuff and we all we all do that, but there was an older brother nearby and I looked at him and I said, "Brother, I want to ask you a question." I said, "When was the best time of your life as a Christian?" And he smiled and said, "Right now, brother." &gt;&gt; And I thought of uh I thought of FF Bosworth when he was there on the bed, passed away. And brother Bram, go talk to him. My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof. He said, "Brother Bosworth, what was your what was the best time for you to be a Christian, to serve God?" I said, "It's right now." &gt;&gt; He said, "Five minutes from now, I'm going to be in the presence. I've preached about him. I've talked about him." And, you know, maybe we're not five minutes away, but maybe we are, but we're closer than we've ever been. And so, that's that's how I feel about it. That's been my that's my testimony. He gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go by. &gt;&gt; And I hope you feel that way today. If you don't, maybe you'll feel that way when you leave. But anyhow, we just we just trust the Lord is blessing each one of you doing something in your lives and and it's like I said last time, you know, sometimes the worst moments of your life are the best moments. You just don't realize it. So, we just trust the Lord as we go into 2026. The bride's moving forward. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no retreat. There's no backing up. We're we're pressing on. And if you have your Bibles this morning, before I I introduce myself too long, we'll go into the Psalms this morning and we're going to look into the 90th Psalm. It is a prayer of Moses, the man of God. And I've looked at this thought before, but I'm just going to kind of take it a little different here. I don't know if I looked at it here before, but we're just going to read a couple uh three verses here this morning, and then I'll have you be seated in the 90th Psalm. And uh we'll come back to some more of this later, but we'll start in the 10th verse. And &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; um Moses, among other things, he's talking about the brevity and the shortness of life. It's kind of one of our themes this morning. Um now, I'm not always good about giving the title. Brian will get a hold of me a couple days later and be like, "Brother, what are you doing?" I'm like, "I don't know." I probably didn't have one at the time, actually. So, uh, I have a title, but I can't give it yet because it's one of them like them cliffhanger things. You I don't know how you So, we'll get to it a little bit, but if I forget, remind me. [laughter and snorts] Amen. But verse 10 here says this, "The days of our years are three score years in 10." That's 70, by the way. And if reason by strength they be four score years, yet is their strength labor and sorrow. For it is soon cut off, and we fly away. Who knoweth the power of thine anger? Even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath. This is pretty bleak, but we'll bring it full circle here. Amen. Notice this verse 12. So teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom. &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless the reading. where you may be seated this morning. &gt;&gt; Well, I was afraid I was going to get cold up here and I'm already warm. So, y'all lit a fire in here or something, I guess. But, um, I like this statement here, especially that that Moses, of course, he lived to be 120, but makes this point about teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts into wisdom. It echoes the same sentiment that Paul speaks about in the book of Ephesians the 5th chapter where he says this in Ephesians chapter 5. He says, "See then that ye walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil. Wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is." Amen. And so I got to thinking about this with this scripture this morning and just this thought kind of came to me a little bit. You know, it's one thing to have wisdom and it's another thing to apply it to your heart, as Moses would say. Apply it to your heart. Amen. And we see this particularly in the life of Solomon, whom we'll revisit here in a little bit. But, you know, here was a man that had wisdom gifted to him and then he desired more wisdom. And in his pursuit of this, he left off to act in a way that was wise or to apply it to his heart. And of course, Brother Bram talks about this. He ends his life in a backsliden state. He married a thousand different women. They led his heart astray from God, different kinds of gods, all kinds of different directions. And so, uh, you know, it's it's a it's a reminder to us. It's a teachable moment. Amen. That, uh, you know, our fallen nature, if I can say this, even our carnal-mindedness as Christians, sometimes we're not always careful or mindful of our time. Amen. And so, this is why Moses makes this plea. Teach us to number our days. Why? THAT WE MIGHT APPLY our hearts to wisdom. Amen. Now, for some of us, hopefully most of us, as we're getting older, you realize at some point in your life that you don't have as much time on this earth as you thought you did when you were a teenager and you had big plans and you were going to do all this and all of a sudden, you know, you're like, I'm going to have a family. I'm going to do this. It's going to be great. And the next thing you know, you you've got three little babies here and this is going on. The next thing you know, you're how am I going to retire? And so, IT GOES IT GOES you you young people especially, you probably get sick of hearing this, but it goes by a lot faster than you think. And the Bible makes this point. It's just like the grass. I'll come back to it later, but Moses talks about it. It's like the grass. It's here one moment and it's gone the next. &gt;&gt; And so before you know it, time disappears. Amen. And and and you don't realize it almost till it's too late. Amen. You imagine if you had the wisdom, you say you're 50 years old. If you had the wisdom of of a 50 years old, a 50-year-old at the age of 15, you might do things a little bit differently. Amen. You might plan differently. YOU MIGHT, WELL, YOU KNOW, MAYBE I WILL be more careful with this or careful with that. AMEN. THERE'S ALL kinds of things that you would deal with. And so now I'm going to ask a question. It's New Year's. And I asked this a few years ago. I think everybody caught this. But it's New Year's. Did anybody make any New Year's resolutions for New Year's? Raise your hand if you did so I can I can make funny. See, of course not because you already know where this Brother Brian, God bless an honest heart. We'll we'll chide you the rest of the service. You [laughter] should know better. Brother Bam talks about this several different places in the message. You're probably familiar with it. Amen. But he talks about it like in the sermon for instance from that time he said you know he said you see a man all dirty and everything he said I'd rather have him with me many a time than someone dressed up with their maybe collar turned around and pat me on the back SAY OH BROTHER BRANDHAM WE'RE FOR YOU AND YOU KNOW RIGHT THAT HE'S lying well I'm sure nobody here's ever dealt with THAT THIS GUY'S LIKE OH WE'RE WITH YOU BROTHER BRANDON he says and you know that he's lying see I've got no use for a liar my he said you can hide from a thief but you can't hide from a liar. Now, I don't want to unpack all that this morning, but and THEN YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM THE LIAR. He says IT'S HE SAID, "THAT'S RIGHT." HE SAYS, "BUT WE" HE SAYS, "WHEN WE HIT THOSE SPOTS," HE'S preaching from that time. He says, "From that time." He says, "New years comes along. We go out and we write up a resolution. Tonight, wife, I'll give you the promise. I'll turn a new page and I'll never drink no more." And the woman smokes so many cigarettes till she can't nurse her baby no more. Give it nicotine poison. Kill it. SO, SHE'S GOING TO STOP SMOKING ON NEW YEAR'S. and the drunk's going to quit drinking on New Year's. The immoral PERSON'S GOING TO STOP THEIR IMMORALITY on New Year's and so forth like that. WHAT DO YOU DO? YOU YOU JUST TURN A NEW PAGE TO TURN IT BACK AGAIN THE NEXT DAY. SEE, and now he makes this statement. HE SAYS, "YOU DON'T GET STARTED RIGHT." &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW, BEFORE I GO INTO THAT, I WANT TO BROTHER BEN and I'll just paraphrase for the sake of time, but he goes through some different things and he talks about he was a boy during the First World War. They didn't call it World War I back then. They call it the great war. You know why they didn't call it World War I? Because they didn't have a two yet. Why would they call it one? AMEN. AND BROTHER TALKS ABOUT AS A BOY IN ABOUT I THINK HE TALKED ABOUT HAVING A SACK OF BEANS. If they came over here, he was going TO WHACK HIM WITH YOU KNOW HOW KIDS ARE. That's what he was going to do. You know, it's like a boogeyman. I'll I'll stick him with my you know what, you know. SO HE'S GOT THIS PLAN, BUT HE MAKES THIS POINT. AMEN. THAT WAR WAS SO BAD AND IT was a terrible thing. The way that people died and the number of people that died, the Spanish flu afterwards, it was such a horrible thing that they MADE AND BROTHER WOULD TALK ABOUT. HE would say they'd come there and be like, "YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'LL NEVER DO THAT AGAIN. We're never going to have WAR AGAIN." AMEN. THEY SAID, "IT'S THE WAR TO END ALL WARS." GUESS WHAT? WE HAD MORE WARS AFTER THAT. &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT THEM TODAY. AMEN. LISTEN, now we're talking about getting STARTED RIGHT. AMEN. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT GETTING STARTED RIGHT BECAUSE A bunch of them, they didn't get rid OF THEIR GUNS. THEY GOT MORE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WELL, OF COURSE, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE MORE WARS. YOU'RE READY FOR IT. AMEN. BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID. THERE WAS THIS WAS SUCH A TERRIBLE THING. NOW, I'M SAYING THIS FOR A REASON CUZ WE'VE DONE THAT IN OUR LIVES WITH THINGS. Maybe there's somebody in HERE TODAY EVEN THEY'RE WRESTLING WITH SOMETHING. THEY GO, "WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS WAS TERRIBLE, BUT I'LL NEVER DO THAT AGAIN." AND THE NEXT DAY YOU DO IT AGAIN AND YOU FALL INTO IT. WE FIND OURSELVES IN THE SAME CYCLE. AMEN. WELL, I WOULD NEVER DO THAT. THAT WAS A HORRIBLE THING. I I'M NOT THAT WAY ANYMORE. AND IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, WE DON'T START OUT THE RIGHT WAY. AND IT'S JUST US SAYING IT. AMEN. THEY SAID, "WE'LL NEVER DO THAT AGAIN. WE'LL NEVER HAVE WARS." AND WE HAD ONE EVEN WORSE AFTER THAT. WE'VE HAD WARS SINCE THEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO THAT'S WHAT BROTHER BRAND WOULD SAY. LISTEN, IT WASN'T THE END. BROTHER BRAND WOULD TALK ABOUT HIS DAD. HE'D THROW THE TOBACCO OUT. EVERY NEW YEAR'S EVE, HE'D THROW THE TOBACCO OUT IN THE HOUSE AND BROTHER SAID, "I have to watch him. Where are you going to throw it?" Because the next day he'd be out there looking for it. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, uh, let me say this. Uh, now I had a brother, uh, where's where you at? Mention my I lost some weight. Thanks for because I know you all noticed this already. [laughter] Talking about losing weight and stuff. That's a big thing we do for New I need to get in shape. Amen. And I I actually I had a brother come to me at church here a while back. He's like, "Man, you lost some weight. How much did you weigh?" I said, "I be honest, I hadn't looked at it because I wasn't trying to lose weight originally." Uh uh now years ago, I went to a church service and there was a brother from India came in and he preached health and nutrition for 45 minutes. I'm not going to do that to you today. I thought this guy came all the way over here from the other side of the world to tell me to eat better. AND I DIDN'T LISTEN TO HIM THEN, AS YOU COULD PROBABLY FIGURE OUT. SO, I'M NOT BUT I'LL JUST MAKE THIS POINT. I I WENT TO THE DOCTOR HERE RECENTLY. And uh I'll just say this, THE DOCTOR WASN'T IMPRESSED WITH THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF MY HEALTH. MY WAISTLINE WAS GOING the wrong way. My numbers are going the WRONG WAY. AND SOME OF YOU can relate to that. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so I said, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. I've got to make a change. Amen. And this is what I'm getting at. Now, I don't want to unpack all this for you, but I'll make this point real quick. Amen. We I I try typically what we do is well I'll just I'll stop doing this and I'll start doing this and I'll stop doing this and WE FIND THAT OUR WILLPOWER IS NOT MEAT FOR THE CHALLENGE. THE SPIRIT IS WILLING BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK. AMEN. AND SO WE'LL GET STARTED AND THEN COOKIES COME along in Christmas and THANKSGIVING AND AND SO I'M SAYING THIS FOR THIS REASON. I I started researching it and really looking into it and I'll I'll just throw this in real quick. The issue is not no so much of a calorie issue. It's a hormonal issue and if you fix the hormonal issue, blah blah blah blah blah, whatever. If you want it, I'll teach you afterwards. I'll send you my book. But anyway, I'm making it. And now, so what this is what I'M GETTING AT. I FOUND I GOT TO A PLACE WHERE I JUST DIDN'T CRAVE food anymore. Especially when I first started out, you could put food in front of me and I haven't eaten for a day. I had no desire to eat it. Amen. You say, "What's this got to do with anything?" When the temptation is gone, then it's NO LONGER A STRUGGLE TO DO IT. AMEN. AND SO WHAT HAPPENED? THE BROTHER MADE THIS COMMENT, "WELL, MAN, YOU YOU PICKED THE WORST TIME TO START. YOU YOU BECAUSE I STARTED AROUND Thanksgiving all through THE HOLIDAY SEASON. MOST PEOPLE WAIT TILL AFTERWARDS." AND I SAID, "THAT'S THE PROBLEM." &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE GET TO THE END OF THE YEAR AND WE'RE LIKE, "WELL, LISTEN, MAN. Another year's gone by. I need to make some changes." If you really need to make them, you're not waiting &gt;&gt; TILL A CERTAIN TIME. YOU SAY, "WELL, YOU KNOW, I NEED TO STOP DRINKING. I'LL WAIT TILL AFTER I GET DRUNK ON NEW YEAR'S." THAT ALREADY SHOWS YOU DON'T REALLY CONSIDER THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, this is what I'M GETTING AT. WE WE HAVE A WISDOM. WE RECOGNIZE A THING MUST BE DONE, [screaming] BUT SOMEHOW THE ONSET OF THE NEW YEAR DOESN'T GIVE YOU A A CONVICTION OR COMPULSION THAT ACTUALLY GIVES YOU THE ABILITY TO DO IT. AND ALL IT'S DONE IS WE'VE LOOKED AT TIME IS PASSING. WE LOOK AT OUR DAYS. OUR DAYS ARE SHORT. WE'RE DOING WHAT MOSES SAID. WELL, MAN, TIME'S GOING ON. I NEED TO MAKE A CHANGE. AND THEN WE SIT THERE AND SAY, "WELL, I'LL MAKE A CHANGE IN A FEW DAYS." IF IT'S NOT WORTH YOU CHANGING RIGHT AWAY, THEN IT'S NOT GOING TO BE WORTH YOU CHANGING IN A FEW DAYS. I'M SAYING SOMETHING NOW. AMEN. THE BIBLE SAYS TODAY IS THE DAY OF SALVATION. AND IF YOU WERE A SINNER SITTING THERE TODAY AND YOU SAID, "I NEED TO GET RIGHT WITH GOD." YOU DON'T SIT THERE AND SAY, "WELL, I BELIEVE I NEED TO GET RIGHT WITH GOD. MAYBE HERE IN A FEW WEEKS WHEN I GET DONE WITH MY PARTIES AND I GET DONE WITH MY CONCERTS AND I GET DONE WITH MY DRUGS AND I GET THEN I'LL GO MAKE IT RIGHT." THAT'S THE WRONG ATTITUDE. YOU'LL NEVER GET right &gt;&gt; cuz IT'S NOT REALLY SETTLED IN YOUR HEART. YOU'VE NOT APPLIED IT. AMEN. YOU KNOW BETTER. NOW LISTEN FOR MYSELF. AMEN. THE IMPENDING END OF THE YEAR DID NOT SUDDENLY GRANT ME KNOWLEDGE THAT I DID NOT HAVE BEFORE THAT I NEED TO BE HEALTHIER. AMEN. IT'S NOT LIKE OH THE YEAR IS OVER NOW. AND YOU KNEW THE WHOLE TIME. &gt;&gt; YOU KNEW THE WHOLE TIME. &gt;&gt; BUT THE PASSING OF TIME REMINDS YOU OH SOMETHING NEEDS DONE. SO, WHAT DO WE DO? WE'LL PUT IT OFF A FEW MORE DAYS AND ALL YOU'VE DONE IS PERPETUATE. &gt;&gt; WELL, praise the Lord. Listen, IF IT'S WORTH YOU DOING, IT'S WORTH YOU DOING NOW. AMEN. LISTEN, WHY I BELIEVE A MAN SHOULD SERVE GOD. IF IT'S WORTH SERVING GOD EVER, IT'S WORTH SERVING GOD TODAY. IF IT'S I NEED TO PRAY MORE. WELL, IF YOU WANT TO PRAY MORE, I'D START TODAY. I WOULDN'T WAIT TO SEE. WE'LL WAIT TILL A CRISIS COMES. WE'LL WAIT TILL THE NEW YEAR. WE'LL WAIT TILL THE THAT'S NOT HOW THAT WORKS. AMEN. THAT'S NOT A conviction in your heart. YOU JUST KNOW BETTER. BUT YOU WON'T DO BETTER. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. See, now I got to make sure if I gain all this weight back, I look like a hypocrite. [laughter] But I'm making this point. AMEN. THE ISSUE IS THAT SOMETHING IN OUR LIVES NEEDS CORRECTED. There's a temptation or whatever. And and and people, they start out wrong. Brother Ram said, "AMEN." THEY KNOW THEY SHOULD STOP ALREADY AND THEY'RE TRYING TO DELIVER THEMSELVES FROM A THING. AMEN. But like brother Bram said, when now the same quote, Brother Ram talks about this, when a man meets God, then everything changes. Amen. So in OTHER WORDS, WE ARE TRYING TO DO SO many times things in now maybe your problem today isn't your waistline or whatever. Maybe it's something that's beyond that. But we look at addiction. We look at different problems. WE LOOK AT TRIALS in our life. Amen. And what we're doing, we're not committing it to God. WE'RE TRYING TO FIX IT on our own. AND WE'RE LETTING SOME ARBITRARY DATE ON THE CALENDAR convince us that there's SOME SORT OF POWER IN THAT. BUT THERE'S NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE AGING the same today as you were three days ago or four days ago or a year and four days ago. &gt;&gt; Amen. All it's doing is reminding us. And that's what Moses's whole point is. Amen. &gt;&gt; This this new year, it just reminds us that the situation's bad. And then we just, well, I'll fix it in a few days. And it doesn't it it reminds me in the book of Acts about Felix. Amen. In the book of Acts, Paul's taken prisoner and he goes to Felix and and Felix has him there. And the Bible says this, after certain days, Felix came with his wife, Dusilla, and they they called Paul and they wanted to hear what Paul had to say. And the Bible, I love this. The Bible says this as Paul reasoned with them out of righteousness and temperance and judgment TO COME. FELIX TREMBLED AND HE SAYS THIS, "GO THY WAY AND I'LL CALL FOR YOU AGAIN IN A CONVENIENT SEASON." &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, I I I'M HEARING WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND I'M NOT DISBELIEVING YOU, BUT IT'S JUST NOT A GOOD TIME. IT'S NOT CONVENIENT. I'LL CALL YOU AGAIN WHEN IT'S COME. NOW, THE BIBLE tells us a couple things after this. He was hoping to get a bribe. So really, he wasn't actually interested in what Paul said as much, but he's hoping to get some money for it. But the Bible TELLS US THIS. AFTER TWO YEARS, FESUS SHOWS UP. TWO YEARS LATER, HE SHOWS UP AND FELIX LIKE, "OH, I GOT THIS GUY." SOMEWHERE IN THAT 2-YEAR PERIOD, HE NEVER FOUND A CONVENIENT SEASON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, WE'LL WAIT FOR A CONVENIENT SEASON TO DO THINGS. AMEN. WELL, I NEED I KNOW I NEED TO BE IN CHURCH. AND I KNOW I NEED TO BE LISTENING TO THE TAPES AND I KNOW I NEED TO BE HEARING WHAT A PROPHET SAYS, BUT LISTEN, IT'S JUST A BUSY TIME OF LIFE FOR ME AND I'LL GET AROUND TO IT EVENTUALLY. IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE CONVENIENT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A CONVENIENT TIME TO SERVE GOD, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO FIND IT. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR CONVENIENT TIME TO MAKE YOUR LIFE RIGHT, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO FIND IT. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; PEOPLE DO THAT WITH WELL LISTEN. WELL, WHEN I GET MY LIFE AND I, YOU KNOW, WHEN I HAVE $400,000 IN THE BANK AND I'VE GOT THE THEN I'LL GO HAVE KIDS WHEN IT'S CONVENIENT. LISTEN, KIDS ARE NOT CONVENIENT. SORRY, KIDS. THAT'S NOT WHY YOU HAVE THEM. YOU DON'T HAVE THEM FOR FUN, FOR A LUXURY. THERE'S A RESPONSIBILITY THERE. AMEN. AND WE DO THIS. WE RATIONALIZE. WELL, LISTEN. I I'M WAITING ON THE TIMING OF THE LORD TO DO THE THING THAT GOD TOLD ME TO DO FIVE YEARS AGO. AS IF SOMEHOW WE HAD AN IN AN EXCUSE FOR OUR INACTIVITY, THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF IT DOESN'T COMPEL YOU TO DO IT NOW, WHY WOULD IT COMPEL YOU TO DO IT LATER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. SEE, this is the thing. Our human will is such a pervasive THING. OUR OUR WILL HAS A A WAY OF INFECTING EVEN A A GOOD MOTIVE, A GOOD OBJECTIVE. AMEN. WE CAN TAKE THINGS THAT GOD ORDAINED AND WE CAN SUBVERT IT FOR our own will. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord, somebody. We'll rationalize our behavior. We'll rationalize our decisions. Amen. And when I talk about the pervasiveness, what I'm saying is we don't even realize we're doing it sometimes. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE WE'VE GOT SUCH A WAY OF RATIONALIZING OUR SITUATION. WE CAN LOOK AT EVERYBODY ELSE. WELL, LISTEN, they know better than that. Well, so do you. &gt;&gt; YEAH, BUT IT'S DIFFERENT FOR ME. I'VE GOT AN UNDERSTANDING WITH GOD. OH, SEE, HERE'S THE PROBLEM. I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU GOT A SPECIAL MEMO FROM HEAVEN. YOU HAVE AN EXCUSE. IT'S A GOD'S LIKE, "MAN, I REALLY I NEED YOU IN THE KINGDOM SO BAD. I'M GOING TO LET YOU CIRCUMVENT my will to do it." &gt;&gt; Now, that sounds, but we'll DO IT IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL. WELL, LISTEN. IT'S DIFFERENT FOR ME. IT'S NOT DIFFERENT FOR YOU OR ME or anybody else. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But we'll make excuses. Excuses on the day of judgment. Amen. So, our will, IT'S SO STRONG. WE WE SO DESIRE, AMEN, TO HAVE THINGS OUR WAY. AMEN. And I always use this example. If you don't believe that, just wait till the next time you order fast food and they make it wrong. Amen. It's like brother Steven. He he hates tomatoes on his tacos. I can pick on him because you all know about how much he LOVES TACO BELL. HE HATES TOMATOES ON HIS TACOS. AMEN. NOW IMAGINE YOU DON'T LIKE TOMATOES IN YOUR TACOS AND YOU GO TO TACO Bell and you say, "I WANT SIX TACOS AND I DON'T WANT TOMATOES IN THEM." And they put tomatoes on one of them. And you know what you're going to do? You're going to march in there and YOU'RE GOING TO THROW YOUR BAG ON THE COUNTER. YOU MADE THIS WRONG. I SAID NO TOMATOES AND I DON'T HAVE the time to pick them off, but you got the time to make a new one. LISTEN, I PAID GOOD MONEY FOR THIS AND I WANT IT DONE RIGHT. IT'S THE PRINCIPAL. I, YOU KNOW, I DESERVE WHAT I PAID FOR AND THAT'S, YOU KNOW, THAT'S GOOD AND FINE, BUT AS SOON AS WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO WORK AND we're in a big hurry and we don't HAVE TIME, WE SUDDENLY JUST I'LL JUST PICK THEM OFF AND GO. IT'S NOT CONVENIENT TO COMPLAIN ANYMORE. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO. SO, IF LISTEN, IF IT'S THE PRINCIPLE, IF IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT, AMEN. THEN IF YOU'RE RUNNING FIVE MINUTES BEHIND, IT DOESN'T MATTER CUZ YOU'RE GOING IN THERE AND YOU'RE COMPLAINING TO THEM THAT THEY MADE IT WRONG BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT'S CONVENIENT. IT'S ABOUT RIGHT AND WRONG. THIS IS WRONG. THIS IS IMMORAL. [screaming] THE OUTRAGE THAT THEY WOULD MESS with now. That's ridiculous. &gt;&gt; But I've seen people probably none of you here and THAT'S JUST ABOUT HOW THEY'LL GET. AMEN. GOOD CHRISTIAN PEOPLE. BUT AS SOON AS SOMETHING DON'T GO THEIR WAY, BOY, THEY'RE IN YOUR FACE LETTING YOU KNOW. &gt;&gt; WELL, LISTEN. YOU MESSED THIS UP AND YOU SAID AN A WHEN THERE WAS A DUH. AND YOU DIDN'T LIKE THIS AND YOU DIDN'T SING MY FAVORITE SONG AND YOU DIDN'T PLAY WITH MY PET DOCTRINE AND YOU MESSED THIS UP AND YOU MESSED THAT UP. AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT HERESY. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT BLASPHEMY. I'M TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT NOBODY'S GOING TO REMEMBER IN A HUNDRED YEARS. YEAH. &gt;&gt; AND WE WILL FIGHT AND WE WILL LOSE SLEEP AND WE WILL ARGUE AND WE'LL BREAK FRIENDSHIPS AND WE'LL DESTROY FAMILIES &gt;&gt; over our because we want it to be our way. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not about right or wrong. It's really about our will and WE'RE JUST USING THE BIBLE TO JUSTIFY WHAT WE'RE DOING. &gt;&gt; WELL, I've never done that before. I'm sure none of you have either, but they're out there somewhere. [laughter] Amen. I may I better get off that real quick because I'm going to go to lunch and they're going to mess my food up like a point. Amen. It's not really the principle most of the times. It's not really a moral issue. It's our will. We want things a certain way. And if we can't get it our way, we'll leverage them however we can. We'll even use the Bible to do it. Amen. It's just like the Pharisees that saw Jesus and his disciples gleaning food one day and they said, "WELL, LISTEN. YOU GUYS SHOULDN'T YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING THAT ON THE SABBATH." NOW, THEY WEREN'T WORRIED ABOUT THAT FARMER'S CROP that year. They just didn't LIKE JESUS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S ALL IT WAS. THEY JUST DIDN'T LIKE JESUS. SO, NOW SUDDENLY, WE CARE ABOUT THE SABBATH. &gt;&gt; NO, IT'S A BIG DEAL. AND JESUS SAID, "LISTEN, IF YOU HAD KNOWN WHAT IT MEANS I DESIRED MERCY AND NOT SACRIFICE, YOU WOULD NOT HAVE CONDEMNED the guiltless." &gt;&gt; SEE WHAT WE DO? WE START condemning people that didn't do anything wrong. actually &gt;&gt; never hurt you, never did nothing to you, but you'll condemn them cuz you just don't like them &gt;&gt; for whatever reason. &gt;&gt; MAN, I THOUGHT WE'D all love this. I figured you were the ones on the receiving END OF PERSECUTION. GLORY TO GOD. I WAS RIGHT THE WHOLE TIME. [laughter] I was talking about this poem. I forget the name of the guy that writes. I don't know anybody's ever heard it. It's about Ramsy's. Azimus is the Latin name for Ramsies. It talks about they come in the desert to this great statue of his and the face is on the ground, this snarling visage and his feet the THE STATUE'S ALMOST GONE. IT'S JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT. And he makes this point. IT'S THERE'S A PLAQUE ON THE STATUE of Azimus or or Ramsy's. And it says it says several different things, but he says, "BEHOLD MY WORKS, YE MIGHTY IN DESPAIR." WHAT WORKS? It's all gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. all those big important things that he thought were important in his life, the what when you get down to it, it didn't really matter that much. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so it's it's nothing most of the time. The things that we lose sleep over &gt;&gt; the things that we strive we'll strive with the wind and we'll fight about things that don't really matter. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It'll help somebody. I don't even know help you. AMEN. WE'RE WE'LL STRIVE ABOUT THINGS. LISTEN, YOU THINK OF MY my my mom gave me this book years ago. It's our family's genealogy. You know how many times I've opened that book? I think I opened it once because I I put something in it and I had opened a second time to get out. I bookmarked this thing I was supposed to read and then I'm like, "Well, I'm bookmark back." Amen. I don't know my great great grandparents' names. Amen. I don't remember all their names. Amen. It's amazing because people do ancestry stuff and they find out, "Oh man, ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S IN MY GENEALOGY." WELL, MAN, YEAH, THAT'S A PRETTY IMPORTANT GUY. AMEN. AND HEY, IF YOU GOT A Lincoln for an ancestor, kudos to you cuz I don't even want to tell you what I got. BUT WELL, MAN, THIS [screaming] VERY IMPORTANT PERSON IS IN MY FAMILY GENEALOGY. AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW? LIKE I FEEL LIKE BEFORE GRANDPA PASSES AWAY, BY THE WAY, GRANDSON, JUST SO YOU KNOW, YOU'RE ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S GREAT GREAT GREAT. WOW, THAT'S AWESOME. [screaming] I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT DOES FOR ME. IT'S NOT GOING TO GET ME INTO COLLEGE OR [screaming] JOB. BUT THAT'S GREAT. SEE WHAT I'M I'M GETTING A POINT OUT HERE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; ALL THESE THINGS THAT WE GET SO WOR I I I TRY TO ASK myself this question. Is is anybody going to care a 100 years from now about this minor inconvenience in MY LIFE THAT I THOUGHT WAS A BIG DEAL, BUT IT WASN'T REALLY A BIG DEAL &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ALL THAT STUFF'S GOING TO PASS AWAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IN THE GRAND CALCULUS OF THINGS, MOST OF THE THINGS WE GET UPSET ABOUT AND MOST OF THE THINGS WE LET TROUBLE US VERY LIKELY WILL BE FORGOTTEN. YOU MIGHT FORGET ABOUT THEM WHILE YOU'RE ALIVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THIS EARTH SHATTERING EVENTS, I CAN'T GET OVER. WHO CARES? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I'm saying this for A REASON. THAT PERSON THAT YOU GO AND YOU TELL OFF, you go do this to, AND YOU LISTEN, YOU MIGHT BE THE ONLY BIBLE THEY ever read. YOU MIGHT BE THE ONLY CHANCE THEY HAVE FOR SOMETHING ETERNAL. &gt;&gt; And how ARE WE PRESENTING THE GOSPEL IN OUR LIVES? &gt;&gt; I mean, we're not LOOKING AT THE IMPORTANT THING. We're looking at our problem, OUR TRIAL, OUR WILL. WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT A SOUL. WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT OUR TESTIMONY. WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE ONE THING THAT'S GOING TO MATTER WHEN TIME HAS CEASED TO BE. &gt;&gt; WELL, I've done it once or twice. See, confession is good for the soul. AMEN. I'VE DONE IT ONCE OR TWICE. AMEN. [screaming] WE MAKE THIS BIG DEAL. IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WELL, here's a hot take. I really like this one. Amen. Well, listen. This person, they offend. Let me just say this. As as a traveling minister, I run into people all the time and and and and things. You know, they'll they come up to you and you ASK THEM, "GOD BLESS YOU. HOW YOU DOING?" AND THE FIRST THING THEY DO, THEY START TELLING YOU ABOUT 30 years ago WHEN THEY WENT THROUGH THIS THING and this person hurt them and this happened to them AT THE CHURCH AND THIS HAPPENED TO THEM THERE AND THIS happened to them. THEY WERE MR. AND YOU'RE JUST LIKE, "MAN, I MET TODAY. HOW ARE YOU DOING? NOT WHAT ARE YOU CARING? AND AND AND WHAT'S SAD? WHAT'S SAD? OKAY, I'M not trying TO MAKE FUN, BUT WHAT'S SAD IS YOU COME TO THEM A YEAR LATER AND YOU ASK THEM AND IT'S THE SAME STORY. THEY'RE STILL LIVING BACK THERE. THEY'RE STILL HURT. THEY'RE STILL OFFENDED. AND ALL THAT HAS DONE IS LIVED RENTREE in their head. IT HAS RULED THEIR LIFE. IT'S RULED THEIR THINKING. AND IT HAS NO RIGHT TO DO THAT. AMEN. YOU GAVE IT THE RIGHT. &gt;&gt; GOD DIDN'T DO THAT. YOU HELD ON TO THIS THING THAT NOBODY'S GOING TO CARE ABOUT. THAT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE IT INTO ETERNITY. AND WE'LL LET THAT RULE OUR LIVES AND DOMINATE OUR LIVES AND AFFECT OUR LIVES AND WE'LL FORGET THAT THAT PERSON HAS A SOUL. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY TIMES BROTHER SAID SOMEBODY OFFENDS YOU, YOU GO PRAY FOR THAT PERSON AND YOU GO BEFORE THE THRONE AND NOT IN A SORT OF WELL I HAVE TO DO IT SORT OF WAY BUT YOU START PRAYING FOR THEM AND WHEN YOU GET THERE IN THE PRINCE OF GOD, YOU CAN'T CONDEMN ANOTHER MORTAL MAN and you GET IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND YOU BEGIN TO SEE WHERE THE DEVIL MESSED HIM UP SOMEWHERE LIKE HE HAS SOME OF US SOMETIME. HE JUST GOT MESSED UP SOMEWHERE. BUT THE PERSON SAID, "YOU'LL COME BACK FEELING SORRY FOR THAT PERSON." &gt;&gt; WE'RE SO LOOKING AT THE OFFENSE AND WE MISS WHAT'S THE what's the reason behind it. Amen. So here's a hot take. Sometimes God lets THINGS HAPPEN TO YOU. LIKE WHY'D THAT HAPPEN? Maybe God wanted it to happen. &gt;&gt; Oh, you better get mad at God now. I guess MAYBE THE LORD WANTED THAT TO HAPPEN. YOU SAY, "WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?" AMEN. LISTEN, BROTHER BEN, ONE TIME HE, you know, he was in trouble with the IRS because of the way, you know, because he wasn't a shyer. It's funny if you'd have been a if he'd been a swindler, he probably gotten away with it. But he was giving money to people that actually needed it, not hoarding it to himself, and he got in trouble. Go figure. &gt;&gt; That's your government in action. &gt;&gt; We'll punish the guiltless and we'll let the guilty go free. Well, anyway, I'm not here to make political statements today, BUT &gt;&gt; AND THEN HERE HE IS GIVING THE MONEY AWAY, NOT KEEPING TRACK OF IT. YOUR LEFT HAND SHOULDN'T. HE DIDN'T WANT CREDIT FOR IT AND SO HE GOT IN TROUBLE WITH THE IRS AND HE HE HE THOUGHT HE WAS DONE WITH IT. BROTHER tells a story. He said that he got a he got a check one day and he ran to Billy Paul said, "Billy Paul, can I can I cash this check or am I get in trouble for it?" And he said, "Billy Paul took it about four different guys. I just for the sake of time shortening it up here, but he took it about four different guys and they're like, "Yeah, it's okay. Yeah, it's okay. You can cash that." Amen. So after that, BROTHER BEN GOES, HE TAKES THAT CHECK AND HE CASHES IT AND RIGHT AWAY THE tax agent gets a hold of him. Well, I believe we're going to reopen the case. Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; What a jerk. [laughter] &gt;&gt; The tax agent's like, "WE'RE GOING TO REOPEN THE CASE." AND SO, BROTHER RAMY'S TALKING TO BROTHER LEE AND BROTHER BRAMY'S JUST TELLING him about it and he's NOT UPSET. AND LE SAYS, HE SAYS, "HOW DO YOU LET PEOPLE TALK ABOUT YOU LIKE THAT?" AMEN. HOW can you LET PEOPLE MISTREAT YOU THAT HOW CAN YOU LET PEOPLE TALK ABOUT YOU LIKE THAT? AND BROTHER BRANDON SAID, "NOW, DON'T FLY LOOSE ALL AT ONCE." &gt;&gt; That's for SOMEBODY TODAY. DON'T FLY LOOSE ALL AT ONCE. AMEN. HE SAID, "BE STILL." HE SAID, "GOD IS THE ONE DOING THAT." &gt;&gt; And it reminds ME OF THE STORY, BROTHER TALKS ABOUT THE STORY IN THE BIBLE WHEN DAVID'S OWN SON ABSELUM, WHEN HE SEEKS TO DEPOSE HIM FROM THE THRONE AND TAKE HIS KINGDOM, HE COMES AND TAKE HIS CONCUBINES, KICKS HIM OUT OF THE CASTLE, AND DAVID'S ON THE RUN, HE'S GOT SOME MEN WITH HIM. HE'S HE'S ON THE RUN FOR HIS LIFE. AMEN. AND THE BIBLE TELLS THE STORY AS HE'S GOING OUT THERE, THERE'S A MAN FROM THE TRIBE OF BENJAMIN. HE'S HE'S SAUL'S RELATION, KING SAUL'S RELATION. AND HE SEES DAVID LEAVING AND HE'S HEADING OUT IN THE WHICHEVER WAY HE'S GOING. AND THIS MAN SEES DAVID AND HE BEGINS TO THROW ROCKS AT HIM AND TO CURSE HIM. AND HE SAYS, "COME OUT YOU BLOODY MAN. YOU YOU MAN OF BILE." AND HE BEGINS TO MOCK HIM. AND ABASHAI, ONE OF DAVID'S MIGHTY MEN, HE SAID, "WHY SHOULD THIS DEAD DOG CURSE MY KING? LET ME TAKE HIS HEAD." &gt;&gt; BUT I LOVE HOW DAVID HANDLES IT. HE SAYS, "NOW LISTEN, MY OWN SON SEEKS MY LIFE. WHAT MORE CAN THIS man do to me? &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THE DEVIL IN THE WORLD AND LATER TO SEE HER AFTER ME AND I'M GOING TO GET OFFENDED BECAUSE HE SAID SOME mean words to me. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HELP ME OUT SOMEBODY. MY SON'S TRYING TO KILL ME AND I'M GOING TO WORRY ABOUT THIS. HE SAID, "LET HIM CURSE ME. THE LORD TOLD [screaming] HIM TO DO THAT." Oh my. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, THAT'S JUST THE DEVIL. AND THE DEVIL. NO, MAYBE GOD WANTS THAT PERSON TO DO THAT TO YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I I THIS IS WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS. WHY WHY WOULD GOD LET THAT HAPPEN? WHY WOULD GOD DO THAT? BECAUSE HE WANTS TO SEE HOW DAVID'S GOING TO RESPOND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. LET HIM DO THAT. GOD TOLD HIM TO DO IT. HE SAYS, "IT MAY BE." HALLELUJAH. IT MAY BE. THE LORD WILL LOOK UPON MY AFFLICTION AND THE LORD WILL REQUITE ME GOOD. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS NOT AN OBSTACLE. THIS IS MY CHANCE TO BE A BIGGER PERSON AND KNOW THAT IF I BEAR LISTEN, IT'S LIKE PETER SAID, IF IF YOU'RE REPROACHED FOR YOUR FAULTS, THAT'S NOT SPECIAL. BUT WHEN YOU DID THE RIGHT THING, WHEN YOU WHEN YOU WHEN YOU DON'T DESERVE IT AND YOU'RE IT'S JUST LIKE CHRIST WHEN THEY CALL YOU NAMES, THEY RIDICULE YOU, THEY PUT YOU DOWN, AND YOU BEAR IT PATIENTLY AND YOU PRAY FOR THEM. AMEN. NOT JUST AS AN OBLIGATION, BUT YOU UNDERSTAND, LISTEN, I'M NOT GOING TO FIGHT MY OWN BATTLES. THE BATTLE BELONGS TO THE LORD. AMEN. I'M GOING TO TREAT THEM HOW A CHRISTIAN SHOULD TREAT HIM. AND GOD, [screaming] THAT MAN'S NOT GOING TO DO IT, BUT GOD WILL REQUITE ME GOOD. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, LOTS OF TIMES GOD WILL PUT YOU IN A situation with somebody that's hostile, somebody that's whatever, CUZ HE HE'S NOT DOING IT for their sakes. He's doing to see how you're going to respond. &gt;&gt; AND YOUR RESPONSE WILL DICTATE what kind of a blessing you get. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing ME NOW? SOMETIMES GOD WILL LET BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO YOU AND WE'LL BLAME SOMEBODY AND WE'LL GET DISRESPECTED. We'll get upset. We blame the devil. All this stuff. WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GOING TO LET SOMEBODY DISRESPECT ME LIKE THAT. I respect those who respect me. Well, show me that in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Listen, that's not how David acted. Thank God that guy would have got his head cut off if he did. AMEN. THAT'S NOT HOW THE BIBLE THE BIBLE SAYS WHEN YOU'RE REVILED, YOU BLESS THEM BACK. OH MAN, I thought this was a shouting service. Well, praise God. &gt;&gt; Let me just I I I always feel the need to throw this in. I don't know why. I'll just say this because I know guys like this. Well, you you need to respect me. Never in the history of demanding that people respect you do people ever respect you. You ever notice that? &gt;&gt; It's like telling somebody, it's like if my wife was, this is theoretical. IF MY WIFE WAS UPSET AND I said, "Listen, YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN." GUESS WHAT? SHE DIDN'T CALM DOWN FROM THAT. IT DIDN'T HAVE ANY POWER. IT PROBABLY DID THE OPPOSITE. AMEN. NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF TELLING SOMEBODY TO CALM DOWN DID IT MAKE THEM CALM DOWN. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. WELL, LISTEN. YOU NEED TO LISTEN. IF YOU HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE YOU NEED TO RESPECT, YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO GET IT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU DON'T COMMAND RESPECT. YOU OR YOU DON'T DEMAND IT. YOU COMMAND IT. AMEN. In other words, you live in a certain. It's like brother Bam SAID, A WOMAN SHOULD REVERENCE HER HUSBAND LIKE SHE SHOULD THE LORD. ALL THE BROTHERS GO, "AMEN." THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS. YOU NEED TO REVERENCE ME THE WAY YOU REVERENCE GOD. AND THAT'S TRUE. AND THEN, BROTHER BEN, THE NEXT SENTENCE SAYS THAT AND A MAN, IF HE WANTS TO BE REVERENT, should live in a way. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Well, here we go. Man, I'M A LITTLE BIT LIGHTER AFTER ALL. I HAVEN'T DONE this in A WHILE. THEN YOU BETTER LIVE IN A WAY THAT DESERVES BEING REVERENCED. AMEN. DON'T GET UP THERE WITH YOUR BIG BABY ATTITUDE AND ACT LIKE AN OVERGROWN, SPOILED CHILD AND DEMAND YOUR WIFE REVERENCE YOU WHEN YOU ACT LIKE A 12Y OLD. [laughter] &gt;&gt; WELL, I'M GOING TO DO THIS AND I'M GOING TO DO THAT AND I'M GOING TO MAKE HER. SHE'S, YOU KNOW, they say you marry your mom. That's about what some guys DO. AMEN. THEY'RE JUST LOOKING FOR A GLORIFIED MOM TO CLEAN UP AFTER TAKE CARE OF THEM WHILE THEY DO EVERY KIND OF IRRESPONSIBLE THING JUST LIKE THEY WERE A KID. &gt;&gt; They want somebody to enable them. And you just CALL THAT RIGHTEOUSNESS. THAT'S not righteousness. You're just Oh, praise God. Here we are. WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE WATCHES THIS OUT ON THE AIRWAVES. [laughter] WELL, glory to God. Listen, this guy didn't think DAVID WAS A GOOD KING. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S NOT UP TO THAT GUY. &gt;&gt; It's not even really UP TO DAVID. YOU KNOW WHAT DAVID SAID? I'M GOING TO LET the Lord decide. &gt;&gt; I'm going to LET THE LORD DECIDE in this situation. AMEN. REMEMBER, GOD LOVES TO TEST HIS CHILDREN. GOD'S children don't love to test God's children. Well, some of you love to test other children, BUT WE DON'T LIKE BEING TESTED, BUT GOD LOVES IT. CAN YOU IMAGINE? I'LL JUST SAY THIS real quick. Can you imagine picking up this Bible and YOU READ HERE, "ADAM WAS BLESSED AND HAD eternal life and nothing ever went wrong." Amen. That's a really GOOD STORY. IT'S BORING AS CAN BE. [laughter] &gt;&gt; NO. WHY? IF YOU READ IT ONCE, YOU READ IT A HUNDRED TIMES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. ALL THESE LITTLE THINGS THAT COME IN OUR LIFE, AMEN. THEY'RE A REMINDER to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we focus on the wrong things. Amen. &gt;&gt; We get caught up in it. Amen. And somebody will criticize us because God's wanting to see how we're going to handle it. You say, "Well, that guy's just got the devil in." Maybe you deserved it. &gt;&gt; There's a thought. You ever have you ever been criticized and you deserved it? I was one time. I think uh if I think back [laughter] it was years ago. Sometimes you deserve it AND THEN YOU STILL FIGHT WITH IT. &gt;&gt; WELL, GLORY TO LISTEN. SOMETIMES GOD will anoint your pastor to say I can say this cuz he's not here. Sometimes God will anoint your pastor to say SOMETHING AND HE MIGHT NOT BE SAYING SOMETHING WRONG, BUT HE'LL SAY IN A WAY THAT YOU DON'T LIKE. AMEN. JUST TO SEE HOW ARE YOU GOING TO ACT ABOUT IT. AMEN. ARE YOU GOING TO GET PUFFED UP AND ALL MAD? WHY NOT MEAN? I'M NOT DOING THIS EVER AGAIN. THAT MAN. AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, YOU CAN'T GO ANYWHERE. YOU can't trust anybody. You can't listen to anybody. And most of it's just you. &gt;&gt; Sometimes God will have a man say something like that that you don't like just to see how you're going to act about it. &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT THAT. GOD TAILOR MAKES AN offense just for you. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord, SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SOMETIMES GOD WILL HAVE YOUR LEAST favorite preacher. Perhaps today's THE DAY. HAVE YOUR FAVORITE your least favorite preacher come and preach just to see how you're going to act about it. &gt;&gt; Now, I'll say this again with traveling things. There's there's many times, not here, praise God, but commonly I'll go to different places and stuff and sometimes people come up to me and they they complain, well, this thing's going on at this church over here or this is and you know how it is. They're like, they got to let you know, hey, brother, this is really important. you need to know this. This church that you know have any dealings with and you don't know anybody, but listen, this is you know what they and they sit there and THEY'RE COMPLAIN ABOUT IT TO YOU. THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT IT AND THEY'RE LIKE, "WELL, I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY GOD WOULD LET SOMETHING like that go on." WELL, I DON'T EITHER, BUT I KNOW ONE THING YOU'RE PROBABLY A LOT MORE WORRIED about than God is. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I KNOW FOR A FACT YOU'RE A LOT MORE WORRIED ABOUT THAN GOD IS. AMEN. LISTEN, GOD HAS ALLOWED KINGDOMS &gt;&gt; IN THE YOU READ IN THE OLD TESTAMENT. HE ALLOWS THEM TO GO THE WRONG WAY ALL [screaming] THE TIME. &gt;&gt; WHY DOES GOD LET THIS GO ON? MAYBE TO SEE HOW ELIJAH'S GOING TO ACT. &gt;&gt; WE KNOW HOW AHAB'S GOING TO ACT. WE KNOW HOW JEZEBEL'S GOING TO ACT. BUT ELIJAH, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO ACT LIKE? [screaming] OH, JUST LET ME DIE. THERE'S NO ONE THAT WANTS TO SERVE YOU. HE'S WANTING TO SEE HOW YOU ACT. GOD WILL TAKE WHOLE NATIONS AND WHOLE KINGDOMS AND WHOLE CHURCHES SOMETIMES AND HE'LL HAVE HE'LL ALLOW THEM TO GO A CERTAIN WAY JUST TO SEE HOW ONE PERSON WILL ACT ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; Oh my well that should make you feel good if you're the one that God trusts you. So &gt;&gt; I hope you SEE WHERE I'M COMING FROM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; We're looking at it THE WRONG WELL, WHY DOES GOD LET THIS GO ON? WELL, IT'S HIS BUSINESS. HE'S DONE IT BEFORE. AMEN. LISTEN, GOD IS THE KIND OF GOD THAT'LL LET A WHOLE GROUP GO INTO error just to see how one person acts about it. He did in the days of MARTIN LUTHER. ASK ELIJAH. ASK ISAIAH. ASK JEREMIAH. AMEN. GO LOOK AT JONAH. [laughter] LORD, look at all them people DOWN THERE. HE HE DIDN'T WANT HIM SAVED IN THE FIRST PLACE. Somebody &gt;&gt; What a great attitude. That's a GOOD ATTITUDE. AMEN. LISTEN, JONAH, IF YOU'RE A PREACHER, ESPECIALLY JONAH, HE'S GOT A DREAM JOB. LIKE 300,000 IN ONE ONE SHOT. &gt;&gt; THINK LISTEN, IF I IF I GOT 300,000 PEOPLE SAVED IN ONE MEETING, YOU'D hear about it. Well, hopefully. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT, THOUGH. THERE'S PEOPLE THAT WOULD THEY WOULD NOT MISS A CHANCE TO TELL YOU ABOUT THAT WHOLE CITY GOT CONVERTED. AND JONAH'S LITERALLY FUMING ABOUT IT &gt;&gt; CUZ HE DOESN'T LIKE HIM. [laughter] &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THEM PEOPLE DOWN THERE SERVING GOD, REPENTING, SEEKING HIS FACE AND MY TREE THING IS DEAD AND I'M FIGHTING ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; IT'S FUNNY [screaming] BECAUSE IT'S TRUE &gt;&gt; CUZ WE DO THE SAME THING. I'M FIGHTING THAT THAT MY TREE'S DEAD AND THEY'RE ALL SAVED. I guess &gt;&gt; really God, I'm going to paraphrase this. JONAH, LOOK AT HOW YOU'RE ACTING. YOU CARE MORE ABOUT YOUR ANCIENT AIR CONDITIONER or whatever you want. YOU CARE MORE ABOUT YOUR SHADE TREE [screaming] THAN A WHOLE CITY. WELL, help us Jesus. &gt;&gt; See, it comes down to our will. &gt;&gt; It's Burger King. We want it our way. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Well, listen. Jesus is king of kings, not Burger King. &gt;&gt; He's not trying to get you your Happy Meal. You eat it, too. Amen. &gt;&gt; By the way, that's a lot of processed food while I'm on diet. Real quick, don't eat it. Um, I was surprised. The Whopper's got like 3,000 milligrams of It's like three times your daily loss. I guess I'm never eating a Whopper again. I really liked him, TOO. WE WANT IT OUR WAY. &gt;&gt; WHAT IT IS, deep down, we have this need to be in control of things. We want to control this and we want to control that. When things don't go our way, what's the first thing we do? WE GET ANGRY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE GET FRUSTRATED BECAUSE WE'RE confronted with this little thing that none of us really wants to deal with. You aren't actually in control of anything just about. &gt;&gt; Amen. our need to dominate and to possess, to control everything. It ultimately boils down to fear. WE DON'T LIKE THAT we can't control the the consequences and the outcomes of things. AND WE'RE AFRAID IF THINGS DON'T GO THE WAY WE WANT BECAUSE OF course they couldn't go any better than the way that we want it to go. &gt;&gt; We're afraid. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We're afraid of not being able to direct the outcome. We're afraid of what's GOING TO HAPPEN. WE DON'T LIKE DISAPPOINTMENTS. THAT'S WHY WE MAKE RESOLUTIONS at the new year. Amen. We're disappointed how with last year went. THAT'S WHY WE'RE MAKING WE'RE IF WE WERE HAPPY WITH where you're at, you wouldn't need THE RESOLUTION. WE'RE CONFRONTED WITH DISAPPOINTMENTS ALL THE TIME AND WE HANDLE it the wrong way. And that's why we lose sleep. That's why we're in agony. That's why we're tormented. It's all insecurity. IT'S ALL FEAR. AMEN. WE DON'T LIKE DISAPPOINTMENTS. WE DON'T LIKE FAILURE. WE DON'T LIKE BEING HURT. BUT THE PROBLEM IS WE NEVER LEARNED A HEALTHY WAY TO DEAL WITH IT. SO WE LASH OUT. WE WE WE BRUSH OFF GOD. WE WE GET ANGRY AT PEOPLE AND BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO CONTROL THEM. THEY'RE NOT LISTENING to us. &gt;&gt; Let me clarify something real quick. Your your your desire is not inherently the issue. If you don't like tomatoes and you don't want to eat them, that's fine. It's fine. It's not a problem. Amen. Well, I like mountains AND I LIKE IT'S NOT A PROBLEM. AMEN. YOUR DESIRE is actually not the issue. It becomes an issue when you develop this need to make everything the way you see fit. And you need to control everybody else. You begin to manipulate. You begin to lie. And you begin to lie. Christians don't. Sometimes they lie to themselves. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm the only one. &gt;&gt; No one else in that church even believes this message. &gt;&gt; They don't see it my way. &gt;&gt; And so what happens IS IT CREATES A BIAS where everything has to be the way we think it should. And if it's not, we'll find a way to make it that, even if we have to use the Bible. &gt;&gt; AMEN. LISTEN, THAT'S NO different than what Balam did. Well, I'll give him thus, sayith the Lord, to condemn him. &gt;&gt; Amen. You ever have hopefully I've had this happen, brother, come up. Well, the Lord the Lord spoke to me about your ministry and you're supposed to do this and I'm I'm always marveled. I'm like, that's funny because I'm on speaking terms with God and he never sent me the memo, but he felt to send it to you. Praise God. I rejoice. I'm glad you caught that for me. THEY THEY WANT YOU TO DO A CERTAIN THING AND so they're appealing to the thing they think can control you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; SEE, THIS MESSAGE DID NOT COME TO CONTROL YOU. AMEN. SOMEBODY LISTEN. RELIGION WILL CONTROL YOU. DENOMINATION WILL CONTROL YOU. BUT THIS MESSAGE DIDN'T COME TO CONTROL ME. IT CAME TO LIBERATE ME. AMEN. &gt;&gt; This didn't LISTEN, I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE IN BONDAGE. THIS DIDN'T PUT ME IN BONDAGE. IT SET ME FREE FROM BONDAGE. AMEN. I'M FREE TO SERVE GOD. I'M FREE TO LIFT MY HANDS. I'M FREE TO PRAISE GOD. AND IF ANYBODY TELLS ME OTHERWISE, I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH, SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'M SAYING THIS FOR THIS REASON. I THINK for myself anyway, for most of us, it should be a matter of much meditation IN OUR OWN LIVES. HOW MUCH OF WHAT I do is what the Lord wants me to do? AND HOW MUCH OF WHAT I DO IS WHAT I WANT TO DO? AND I JUST SAY IT'S WHAT THE Lord wants me to do. Happy new year. [laughter] I hope it's happy. Can we make that distinct? Because listen, there's I know I'm going to get there are certain things in your life that you do because you want to do them. &gt;&gt; And that's fine if you're allowed to do it. If it's lawful, whatever. The problem is when you want to do it and you shouldn't or couldn't or what and so you justify it &gt;&gt; by the scripture or by the message. &gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW THIS ONE TIME BROTHER B SAID ONE THING ABOUT a little bit of makeup and so what we do now we're all going to paint our faces up like a barn door and we're going to live however we want. Missing the point completely BECAUSE WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE POINT. WE CARE ABOUT JUSTIFYING OUR behavior &gt;&gt; and WE'LL IGNORE EVERYTHING ELSE. A BODY OF QUOTES, A BODY OF SCRIPTURE THAT ALL SAYS THE SAME THING. THERE'S NO LISTEN, THERE'S NO THERE'S NO CONTRADICTION. &gt;&gt; WE JUST PUT ONE THERE BECAUSE WE DON'T LIKE THE 99% of it. &gt;&gt; And we think that that's an EXCUSE BEFORE GOD. IT'S NOT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WELL, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, there's so many. This is what I'm getting. We We get worked up about big things. We strain nuts, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Rather, and we swallow cams. We get worked up about little things that don't matter. Amen. I was preaching a while back. I don't know if I mentioned it here, but I, you know, I was I was studying places that are under persecution, different places like North Korea and like like Somalia or Nigeria, whatever. All these places. Amen. And I got this thought, you know, I was thinking about 50,000 people in one country. 50,000 PEOPLE THAT ARE IN JAIL FOR BELIEVING THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST. AND I GOT TO THINKING, YOU KNOW, WE WE'LL SIT HERE AND ARGUE ABOUT WHO HAS THE BEST streaming service and who has the best song service and who's got the best lighting and who's got the loudest ministry, who's got THE DEEPEST TEACHING, AND WE'LL FIGHT ABOUT THIS. WE'LL MAKE IT A BIG DEAL. AND THEM PEOPLE IN JAILS DON'T CARE. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER. &gt;&gt; But we make it matter. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Listen, I'm saying this for a reason. And this is something hopefully as you get older, you do this more and more. Amen. So many of the things in my life, especially when I was younger, it was just a big deal. We're going to fight about this. You get a little bit older, you realize, you know, it wasn't really &gt;&gt; the the these seasoned people say, "Amen." All the kids are like, "WHATEVER, MAN. &gt;&gt; ALL THAT STUFF. I JUST OH, MAN. THERE'S NO WAY. I WOULD NEVER." AND NOT ME. You know, most of it wasn't really big a deal as I made it out to be. Most of it wasn't really a big deal as you made it out to be. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you you had to have things a certain way and you worried and you lost sleep and you look back and you realize it wasn't worth the attention and the detail that you and the concern that you gave to it. I had a brother I had a brother get a hold of me about something here a while back. Uh I just just succumb to me. But he he saw a certain thing a certain thing happened in the news and he was trying to you know how conspiracy theories are. [laughter] WELL, I'VE HEARD THIS AND I'VE HEARD THAT and I heard AND HE WAS GOING, "WAIT, COULD IT BE THIS OR COULD IT BE THAT AND ALL THIS DIFFERENT STUFF?" I SAID, "BROTHER, I WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION. Let's say it's this or it's that or the other. If you find OUT IT'S ONE OF THE, WHAT DOES IT change in your life?" Well, nothing. &gt;&gt; Then, why are you obsessing over it? &gt;&gt; Amen. If you FOUND THIS THING OUT and it caused you to start a militia and RAISE AN ARMY, WELL, THAT'S FINE. WELL, THAT'S FINE. [laughter] Here comes the NSA. FBI, C, any threeletter agency you can think of. IF IF IF IT WOULD JUSTIFY YOUR ATTENTION TO THE MATTER, IF IT WAS GOING TO MAKE YOU LIVE DIFFERENT, AMEN. BUT IF IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T REALLY AFFECT YOU, WHY [screaming] ARE YOU SO OBSESSED WITH IT? &gt;&gt; LISTEN, WE LIVE IN A GENERATION THAT'S LIKE THIS. AMEN. WE KNOW EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON IN SOME CELEBRITIES'S LIFE. AMEN. WE KNOW EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON IN TEL AVIV. WE KNOW EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON IN RUSSIA. WE KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN EVERYBODY ELSE'S LIFE AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S going on in our own home. &gt;&gt; WE'RE SO CAUGHT UP [screaming] IN DRAMA AND POLITICS, WE DON'T EVEN REALIZE WHAT'S UNDER OUR OWN NOSES. &gt;&gt; And then we WAKE UP, WELL, I don't know my wife anymore. I don't know. Well, who are you GOING TO BLAME FOR THAT? THE GOVERNMENT. YOU CAN BLAME FOR A LOT OF THINGS NOW, &gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S PROBABLY NOT ONE OF THEM. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. MOST OF THE STUFF that we lose, our attention, our time, our sleepover, it was a waste of time to begin with. It didn't really matter. It's not going to matter. It might not matter a year from now. &gt;&gt; THINK OF ALL THE THINGS YOU GOT WORRIED ABOUT LAST YEAR THAT aren't a problem anymore. Wasn't really that BIG OF A DEAL. NOW, WHY IS THAT? &gt;&gt; WELL, glory to God. Listen, I told a brother this a while back. I said, you know, Jesus gave us peace, not as the world gives. He gives us his peace. Amen. I said, "Peace is valuable to me." And it gets more valuable the older I get. Amen. I like peace and quiet. I never thought I'd be that kind of a person. &gt;&gt; Everybody's like, [screaming] I'm like, I'm going to go sit in a soundproof booth somewhere and READ A BOOK. &gt;&gt; I LIKE my peace. &gt;&gt; IT'S WHY? BECAUSE IT'S VALUABLE TO ME. JESUS gave it to me. Amen. And the older I get, I'm more careful about what I let take it away from me. &gt;&gt; Amen. You shouldn't let any, IF IT'S VALUABLE, YOU DON'T LET DON'T LET superficial things rob you of eternal blessings. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me today? This is what I'M TALKING ABOUT. AMEN. LISTEN, we're talking about this idea of impermanence. That that that things come and go. Amen. That that that things in this life, they're temporal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we're talking about the power of surren, the power of letting go. Amen. It's imper Let me say this way. You know, there's the old saying, all good things come to an end. Well, guess what? So do all bad things. &gt;&gt; Hey, that's okay. I like that one more than the other one. [laughter] &gt;&gt; All these things, THEY THEY COME TO AN end eventually. Amen. But listen, if the happiness that you had in this life, if it never ended, YOU YOU MIGHT forget the Lord. Amen. If your LIFE WAS JUST A CAKEWALK every day, Amen. Where would you be without the tension in your life? BROTHER GRAHAM SAID, THAT PUTS YOU ON GUARD. THAT MAKES YOU A CHRISTIAN. AMEN. YOU LEARN TO VALUE IT MORE WHEN IT COMES. AMEN. YOU LEARN WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH TRIALS AND PROBLEMS. LISTEN, THIS IS NOT WHO THIS IS NOT ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE CASE. THIS IS NOT WHO I'M GOING TO BE FOREVER. I MIGHT STRUGGLE. I MIGHT WRESTLE. I MIGHT FALL SEVEN TIMES, BUT I'M GETTING BACK UP. &gt;&gt; CUZ THIS WORLD'S NOT WHERE I'M STAYING. THIS IS NOT MY HOME. I'M LOOKING FOR ONE TO COME. I'M LOOKING FOR A CITY WITH FOUNDATIONS WHOSE BUILDER AND MAKER IS GOD. AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET LITTLE THINGS ROB ME OF THE BLESSING OF THAT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THIS WORLD, THE BIBLE SAYS, THE FORM OF IT AND THE FASHION THEREOF, IT PASSES AWAY. BUT THERE'S ONE THING THAT DOESN'T PASS AWAY. HE THAT DOES THE WILL OF GOD SHALL ABIDE FOREVER. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; THAT'S OUR FOCUS. THAT'S OUR DESIRE. LISTEN, I DON'T HAVE TO BE IN CONTROL. LET ME SAY THIS. IF I WAS IN CONTROL, I'D HAVE A REASON TO BE WORRIED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE VERY THING MOST OF US CONTEND FOR. I WANT TO BE IN CHARGE. I WANT TO BE CONTROL. I WANT TO I WANT TO DICTATE THIS. I'M SO GLAD I'M NOT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN IN CHARGE BEFORE [screaming] AND I'VE MESSED IT UP. &gt;&gt; I CAN MAKE MISTAKES. I CAN BE WRONG. I CANNOT HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION. BUT I KNOW THE ONE THAT'S IN CONTROL, HE DOESN'T MAKE MISTAKES. HE'S NEVER WRONG. He's never shortsighted. Amen. &gt;&gt; SEE, WE LOSE PEACE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL. BUT TRUE PEACE DOESN'T COME FROM YOU BEING IN CONTROL. IT COMES FROM KNOWING THE ONE THAT IS IN CONTROL. &gt;&gt; KNOWING YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CONTROL, THAT SHOULD BE YOUR PEACE. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HOLD YOUR OWN FUTURE EVEN, BUT YOU KNOW THE [screaming] ONE WHO DOES. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; NOW, IF HE'S GOT YOUR future and all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to your purpose, THEN WHY ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT TOMATOES? I don't know why I'm using tomatoes again, but &gt;&gt; about little things. Listen, I'm saying I come from a family like that where her one Thanksgiving they did this thing and I'll never forget him. Some of you laughing because you come from the same thing. Brother Bam dealt with a family like that. That German that boy said if that boy gets married, he's not converted. He'll make his WIFE'S LIFE HELL ON EARTH. &gt;&gt; Every little offense, every little problem. 30 years ago, my wife burnt the toast. And to this day, you sound like you're nuts. &gt;&gt; Cuz you are. &gt;&gt; The way to overcome is to do the opposite of what we think most of the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Bam. Talks about a person with a complex. 1964 questions. When a person realizes he has an inferior complex or some sort of a complex, how may he overcome this? So should it be if it was a only child causes early youth? Are you ready for the deep 12 steps to life answer to how overcome? Now I I'll say this complex is a it is a psychology term. But how do you OVERCOME A COMPLEX? WHAT MUST BE DONE? TAKE exactly the opposite. &gt;&gt; That was it. &gt;&gt; I can read I'm going to read the but that's it in A NUTSHELL. WELL, IF I'M SELFISH, HOW CAN I STOP BEING SELFISH? DO not selfish things. &gt;&gt; He said, "IF YOU'RE ALWAYS WANTING YOUR WAY," WELL, nobody like that in church today. If you're always wanting your way and that one little brat, that's his word, not mine, so I don't have to apologize for it. THAT ONE LITTLE BRAT that always wants to have everything your way, turn right back around and give everything you got the other way. &gt;&gt; Well, that sounds easy on paper, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? IF YOU'RE SELFISH, AGAIN, IT'S ALL THEORETICAL. NO ONE HERE. IF YOU'RE SELFISH AND YOU WANT TO HOLD EVERYTHING, then start giving AWAY WHAT YOU GOT. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; SAY, "WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I LISTEN, IF YOU'RE GOING TO YOU'RE DOING IT BY FAITH." AMEN. LISTEN, YOU THE the carnal mind is enemy with God. Amen. YOU HAVE TO LET GOD REPROGRAM THIS THING. SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO DO THINGS. I don't want to do that. Well, praise God. Do it anyway. then it's valuable because it wasn't your idea. &gt;&gt; IF YOU WONDER, LISTEN, IF YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO do what God tells you, well, glory to God, man. I'm Well, here we are. I know some people that God's just always blessing me and everything I've ever thought, God has sanctioned it and blessed it, and I've always been right. And I'm just like, man, you're nuts. I don't I don't trust a guy with a testimony like that. AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD ALWAYS TELLS YOU WHAT YOU WANT. WAS LISTEN, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT MY TESTIMONY IS. TIME AFTER TIME AFTER AS A CHRISTIAN IN MY LIFE, I THOUGHT THIS SHOULD BE THE CASE. I THOUGHT THIS SHOULD BE DONE. AND I PRAYED AND GOD SAID, "NO, DO THE OTHER THING." AND I THOUGHT, "GOD, HOW'S THAT GOING TO WORK? GOD, [screaming] SURELY YOU MEANT." AND EVERY TIME, AMEN. LISTEN, GOD DOESN'T NEED MY INTELLECT. HE NEEDS MY SUBMISSION. &gt;&gt; AND EVERY TIME I'VE OBEYED GOD AND NOT TAKEN MY OWN IDEA, GOD HAS ALWAYS BLESSED IT. HE HAS TO BLESS IT BECAUSE IT'S HIS WILL. AND IF YOU'RE THE TYPE OF PERSON, OH, EVERYTHING I WANT, IT'S WHAT GOD GIVES ME. YOU'RE JUST A SPOILED BRAT. NO, I'M SAYING IT NOW. AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, I want a bigger this and I got this and I want that. [screaming] WHERE IS THE OVERCOMING? &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT THERE'S NO SACRIFICE. &gt;&gt; WELL, LISTEN. THIS PERSON OFFENDED ME AND I I'M GOING TO I'm going to give HIM AN EYE FOR LISTEN, THAT'S JUST YOU &gt;&gt; GRATIFYING YOUR OWN NEED. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; He says, "Do whatever. just go the vice versa. That's the way to overcome anything is an antidote. I tell you what, I know some people, this is against they're not church people. Literally, if they took their whole life and they did the opposite, they'd be better off. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what this is why I'm saying this. We're talking about offenses. We're talking about having things our way today. Amen. You don't overcome offenses by holding on to them, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You overcome them by forgiveness. Right? &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T OVERCOME BITTERNESS BY CLINGING TO IT. YOU OVERCOME BITTERNESS BY letting it go. &gt;&gt; See, because you think if I have control of this, if I hold on to this, then I get to No, it actually has control of you. &gt;&gt; It's dictating how you act and how you behave. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, our human thinking is so opposite of the Lord. Amen. So often, it's the opposite of what we should do. It's only when you let go of things. This why I'm talking about impermanence that that things pass. It's when you let go of a thing that no longer has power over you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, some of us maybe we've gone from new year to new year packing things around. Amen. And we're not better for it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What we should be doing is let it go. Amen. Listen, the Bible said that the Holy Spirit, Jesus said the Holy Spirit in us, he would be like rivers of living water flowing out. You don't make a river flow. Amen. Remember, brother talk about that guy, he come to the river and what he he had to throw the log in there and ride on it. Amen. It's going a certain way. LISTEN, IF GOD HAS taken you a certain way, THROW YOUR LOG IN THERE AND SUBMIT TO IT. SAY, "I'M RIDING ON IT." AMEN. LISTEN, YOU CAN DAMN A RIVER. YOU CAN BLOCK IT UP, BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE IT GO A different direction. AMEN. YOU CANNOT BEAT A RIVER INTO SUBMISSION. AMEN. IF IT'S ORDAINED TO BE A CERTAIN WAY, YOU HAVE TO LET IT GO. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT MEANT TO FIGHT IT. YOU'RE MEANT TO SUBMIT TO IT. &gt;&gt; DAVID, DON'T GO KILL THIS GUY. LET GOD WORK ON YOU. &gt;&gt; DON'T DESPISE THE CHASING OF THE LORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, BROTHER. THAT A MAN THAT'S FULLY SURRENDERED TO GOD IS OMNIPOTENT. THAT'S NOT A PERSON THAT DOESN'T HAVE TRIALS. THAT'S NOT A PERSON THAT DOESN'T HAVE QUESTIONS. THAT'S THE PERSON WHO SAYS, "THIS IS WHAT GOD WANTS, AND EVEN THOUGH I WANT TO GO THE OTHER WAY, I SUBMIT [screaming] MYSELF TO IT." AND IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU GIVE UP, YOU GAIN ALL POWER. [screaming] AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT OMNIPOTENT BECAUSE YOU WRESTLED WITH IT AND TOOK IT BY THE HORSE. YOU GAVE IT AWAY &gt;&gt; AND NOW YOU'VE GOT POWER over it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at our our Lord Jesus himself. AMEN. PHILIPPIANS CHAPTER 2. LET THIS MIND BE in you that WAS IN CHRIST. YOU'VE GOT THE MIND of Christ in you. AMEN. LISTEN, HE'S GOT A MIND. IT SAID HE WOULD HE DID NOT COUNT IT ROBBERY TO BE EQUAL TO GOD. BUT WHAT DO HE DO WITH IT? I'm equal to God. I'm I'm bride material. I'm the same substance. Lightning bolts and and LASER BLASTS AND FIRE. NO. That would be neat, but the disciples tried to do that with it. WELL, LET'S CALL FIRE OUT OF HEAVEN. NO. [panting] NO. That's not the point. Amen. &gt;&gt; He is the form in the very image. He's the EXPRESS IMAGE OF GOD. And what does the Bible said he did with the mind of God? The mind of Christ. He humbled himself. Right? &gt;&gt; He submitted himself to the father. Why? Because that's what real power is. &gt;&gt; He did only the things which pleased the father. And the Bible says he learned obedience not by all the miracles that he wrought. &gt;&gt; NOT BY HIS GREAT GESTURES OF POWER AND his wonderful words that he spoke. Those are all great. They're all wonderful. BUT HE LEARNED OBEDIENCE BY THE THINGS HE SUFFERED. YEAH. &gt;&gt; WELL, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Paul says in Romans chapter 5, he says, "We glory in tribulations." Well, glory to God. There's a there's a good refrigerator scripture for you today. Glory in tribulations doesn't mean you sit there and tell everybody to feel sorry for you because I'm going to glory in tribulations knowing that tribulation workketh patience and patience experience. and experience hope. Now, I got to look at this a while back. I don't know if I mentioned this, but I got to look at this a while back because seems kind of odd that they just kind of shoehorned experience in there. Patience, experience, hope. And so, it's it's a good translation, but a better translation. I was looking at the word for it. The Greek word for experience is actually the word character. &gt;&gt; So, patience will teach you character. And character will GIVE YOU HOPE. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE CHARACTER IS THE ONLY THING YOU ARE TAKING WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE YOUR HOUSE. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE YOUR BITTERNESS. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE GRIEVANCES. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE YOUR PET DOCTRINE. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE YOUR GOOD HEALTH. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE YOUR BAD HEALTH. BUT WE'VE BEEN INVITED, BROTHER BENAM SAID, TO BE SHAPED IN HIS CHARACTER. THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE HOPE BECAUSE POWER WITHOUT CHARACTER IS SATANIC. BUT SOMEWHERE IN YOUR LIFE, GOD HAS PUT A CHARACTER IN YOUR LIFE. AMEN. YOU HAD PATIENCE. THE BIBLE SAYS YOU HAVE PATIENCE IN YOUR TRIALS. THAT'S WHERE YOU DISPLAY THE CHARACTER OF CHRIST. THAT'S WHERE HE DISPLAYED HIS OWN CHARACTER. NOT IN MIRACLES, NOT IN SHOUTING REJOY AND IS SUFFERING. HIS CHARACTER IS ON DISPLAY. CUZ YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN A PERSON TILL YOU SQUEEZE THEM OUT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU'RE NOT WHO YOU ARE ON YOUR BEST DAY. YOU'RE WHO YOU ARE [screaming] ON YOUR WORST DAY. &gt;&gt; When nothing's going YOUR WAY, WHEN NOBODY LIKES YOU. WHEN EVERYTHING'S OUT OF YOUR HANDS. WHAT CHARACTER YOU'VE GOT THEN THAT SHOWS WHAT'S ON THE INSIDE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO PATIENCE GOING THROUGH TRIALS BE BURYING IT. PATIENCE TEACHES YOU CHARACTER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And that's the only thing you're taking with you. &gt;&gt; You're you've brought nothing into this world. Paul said in of a certainty you're taking nothing out. All your big plans, all your ambitions, all your credentials, YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS, YOUR REPUTATION, YOUR INTELLECT, YOUR DEGREES, EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE PROUD OF IN THE SIGHT OF GOD, IT'S NOT WORTH ANYTHING COMPARED TO YOUR CHARACTER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BEING RIGHT IN THAT ARGUMENT is not worth being compared to your character. &gt;&gt; THE TRYING OF YOUR FAITH, NOT YOUR FAITH, THE TRYING OF IT. THINK ABOUT THAT NOW. IT'S NOT JUST YOUR FAITH. THE TRYING OF YOUR FAITH IS WORTH more than gold TRIED IN A FIRE. WHY? BECAUSE UNTIL IT'S TRIED, IT'S NOT WORTH ANYTHING. [snorts] &gt;&gt; It has to be proven. SO GOD IS FAR. IT'S IMPERISHABLE. THAT'S why it's the one thing that won't pass away in your life. &gt;&gt; God is far more Let me say this real quick. You write this down if you want. God is far more concerned about our character than giving us our will. All right. &gt;&gt; God is far more. Now, you might not be. [laughter] &gt;&gt; God is. You say, "Well, I want this and I want that." God's like, "No, your character is more important than that." You know, when you're a kid, you kid go, "Dad, why does this happen?" Well, it's to build character. [laughter] No one wants to hear that. But it's true. &gt;&gt; God's not trying to give you what you want all the time. He's trying to give you what you need. &gt;&gt; Cuz that character is worth more than gold. trying to it's imperishable. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Rem says this, "The God rich in mercy, I love him." Can I get an amen? &gt;&gt; I love him till I want HIS WILL TO BE DONE. NOW, that's a big statement. &gt;&gt; But I hope you get it the way the spirit I said it in. I want TO DO HIS WILL. I ASK HIM SOMETHING SOMETIME. HE SHAKES his head no. &gt;&gt; And that's where we get puffed up and walk away. He shakes his HEAD NO. WATCH THIS. I RE I JUST REJOICE SO MUCH ABOUT THAT as I can as if he said yes. &gt;&gt; Can you rejoice at his nose as much as you can his yeses? &gt;&gt; See, now this is that getting older thing a little bit. I'VE SEEN ME NOT GET MY WAY ENOUGH TIMES AND I LOOK back and say, man, dodged a BULLET THERE. GOD TELLS YOU, YOU KNOW, thank you, JESUS. I'M GLAD. THANK [screaming] GOD FOR ALL THE TIMES I PRAYED FOR SOMETHING. CAN I GET A WITNESS TODAY? THANK GOD FOR ALL THE TIMES I PRAYED ABOUT SOMETHING AND I LABORED AND I WANTED [screaming] THAT WAY AND GOD DIDN'T GIVE ME MY WAY AND I'M SO GLAD HE DIDN'T. &gt;&gt; I'M SO GLAD HE DID NOT GIVE ME MY WAY. IF I HAD GOTTEN MY WAY, I'D BE SHIPWRECKED. I'D BE GONE. [screaming] I'D BE DEAD. &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR NOS IN PRAYER. &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR THE NOSE IN MY LIFE THAT STOPPED ME [screaming] WHEN I WASN'T GOING TO STOP MYSELF. YEAH. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU WEREN'T WHEN YOU WERE READY TO BLEEP THROUGH EVERY BARRIER AND BLOW THROUGH EVERY WARNING, THERE WAS A GOD THAT TOLD YOU NO. AND YOU MIGHT HAVE GUSTED WITH IT. YOU MIGHT HAVE CRIED. YOU MIGHT HAVE LOST SLEEP. BUT THANK GOD YOU DIDN'T GET YOUR WAY. &gt;&gt; CAN I SAY THIS? SOMETIMES I REJOICE ABOUT THAT EVEN MORE THAN the yes's. &gt;&gt; I'm so GLAD TO KNOW IT'S NOT IN MY CONTROL. &gt;&gt; He said we OUGHT TO ALWAYS ASK, "THY WILL BE DONE." HIS KNOWS IF THAT'S HIS WILL. IT'S A WHOLE LOT BETTER THAN HIS YESES. IF IT'S HIS WILL TO do it, that's when you really love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says in the book of Proverbs chapter 30, "Every word of God is pure. He's a shield to them that put their trust in him. Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar. Two things have I REQUIRED OF THEE. DENY me them not before I die." He says, "Remove me far from vanity." In other words, the emptiness of things. Vanity and lies. Give me neither poverty nor riches. Now, we're talking about moderation for just a moment here. Feed me with food convenient for me, lest I be full. In other words, I'm too blessed. Lest I be and deny thee and say, who is the Lord? Or lest I be poor and steal and take the name of my God in vain. Paul uh Solomon makes this interesting statement in the book of Ecclesiastes, and it used to puzzle me a little bit. It's in the seventh chapter. He says, "Be not righteous over much, neither make thyself over wise. Why shouldest thou destroy thyself?" And that puzzled me like, "Don't be too righteous." Well, how's that a problem? Well, first of all, you can't make yourself righteous enough no matter what you do. &gt;&gt; Actually, that's what the Pharisees and the Jews tried to do. And look what it caused them to do. &gt;&gt; In other words, it says, DON'T BE OVERLY, IN OTHER WORDS, DON'T LOOK TO BE, HEY, I'M more righteous than ever. It's about self-righteousness. It's about self-satisfaction. Amen. Listen, there's people uh this why I'm talking about moderation. You've got people that we'll just use legalism as example. THEY THEY KNOW THIS MESSAGE better than you. And they're going to tell you they know it better than you. AND IF YOU DON'T LIVE THE WAY THEY think you should live, then there's something wrong with you. AMEN. I SO THANK GOD FOR A BALANCE. THIS THIS MESSAGE BROUGHT A BALANCE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T SEE IT IN THE WORLD. YOU DON'T SEE IT WITH MEN. THE PROPHET BROUGHT A BALANCE WITH THIS BECAUSE THAT WAS THE SPIRIT OF GOD IN HIM. AMEN. I'M NOT LOOKING TO BE SOME SORT OF SELF-RIGHTEOUS BIGOT THAT TELLS EVERYBODY I'M THAT'S NOT THE POINT. THIS MESSAGE DIDN'T MAKE ME FEEL BETTER ABOUT MYSELF. IT DELIVERED ME IS WHAT IT DID. [cheering] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT FOR ME TO LIFT MYSELF UP. LISTEN, WE'RE SO WORRIED ABOUT TRYING TO BE RIGHTEOUS. &gt;&gt; WE'RE TRYING TO I GOT TO CROSS EVERY LITTLE eye or dot every eye and cross it. We're We're trying. That's the problem. You're trying. That's what the Jews did. BEING IGNORANT OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD, THEY SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH THEIR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS. WELL, WHEN YOU ESTABLISH YOUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS, YOU GOT TO tell everybody. &gt;&gt; Listen, JES, YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT JUSTIFICATION IS? JESUS GIVES YOU A STORY. There's two guys went in the temple one day. ONE SAID, "WELL, I DO THIS AND I DO THAT. I'm not like brother. I'm not like brother Ben. That guy, he's a rascal. I do this and I'm me." That man wasn't justified &gt;&gt; because he tried to just It's the opposite. He tried to justify himself. &gt;&gt; WATCH THE OTHER MAN. HE SMOKED HIS CHEST. SAID, "GOD, BE MERCIFUL to me, A SINNER. &gt;&gt; HE WASN'T RIGHTEOUS IN HIS OWN EYES. [screaming] THAT'S WHY GOD SAID HE WAS RIGHTEOUS. &gt;&gt; DON'T BE OVER IT'S LIKE YEAH, I use this ALL THE TIME. DON'T BE OVERWISE." IN OTHER WORDS, LISTEN, IF YOU'RE WISE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO AROUND telling people. It's like a It's like an unwritten rule, you know, if I go up to Brian, well, I'm I'm the wisest one here. Probably not. It It seems It seems sad sometimes that you can't advertise how great you are. I'm wiser than everybody. Well, listen. A WISE MAN DOESN'T THINK OF HIMSELF that way. &gt;&gt; PAUL SAID, "A WISE MAN IS NOT WISE IN HIS OWN CONCEIT. HE DOESN'T LOOK AT HIMSELF THAT WAY." THAT'S IRONICALLY WHAT MAKES HIM WISE. [screaming] ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; A HUMBLE MAN'S NOT TELLING YOU HOW I LOVE THIS BECAUSE YOU LISTEN TO OTHER MINISTERS, OTHER preachers that were contemporaries OF BROTHER BHAM. THAT WAS THE THING THEY ALL SAID. HE WAS THE HUMBLEST of all preachers. What a humble man. Brother B say now I your humble servant, the humble prophet to the &gt;&gt; not advertising that. &gt;&gt; Hey guys, I'm so humble. I'm proud of it. I wrote a book on it because I'm an expert ON HE THAT'S NOT HOW THAT WORKS, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; DON'T BE OVER. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO MAKE and that's why I'm saying we'll fight and we'll fight and we'll fuss because this is important and maybe it's not &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; We strain it nuts and we listen. How many married couples, you know, glory to God? Listen, our our social media generation is killing us softly &gt;&gt; because we see everybody's highlight reels. Well, listen. Her husband's perfect. He works out. He's got a six-figure job. He's great. Oh, man. She's perfect. She looks pretty. AND YOU DON'T SEE IT'S LIKE BROTHER VISITING THEM TWO COUPLES. There's that rich COUPLE UP. OH, THEY GOT A NICE HOUSE. OH, MAN. I SEE ALL THEIR HIGHLIGHT REELS. They don't act like that when the camera's off. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But that's what you see. And a woman, a man, well, I wish I had a family like that. I wish I had Well, he leaves his socks on the floor. Well, she doesn't cook THE THING THAT I LIKE EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK, AND SHE WANTS ME TO be healthy. No, my wife didn't make me. I'm just as an example. [laughter] He He He left his socks on the floor, and I just I can't do it anymore, Lord. Maybe that's not grounds for divorce. You're going to have to take that with the pastor. Marriage and divorce. WE'RE SO UPSET ABOUT THIS LITTLE THING. IT'S PROBABLY NOT THE LISTEN, if you want to get anywhere in marriage, anybody that's been married a long time, they'll tell you you got to learn to forgive. Boy, this got real simplistical. I mean, clearly, it's not a big deal. It's not a big deal. Quit making it a bigger deal than it is. My wife asked me to do something in the house. Said, "Listen, you don't have to tell me every six months. I got to know." Well, Glory, God forgive me, too. But I'm gonna tell a story here. Is this all right? Is that all right? &gt;&gt; I had a I had a brother come to me a while back. Well, now if the pastor wants to correct this when he gets back, that's fine. But I had a brother come to me a while back. This brother in his house has a Christmas tree. Now, I'm not justifying her. NOT ENDORSING THIS BEHAVIOR. But to make my point, he's got a Christmas TREE IN HIS HOUSE because his wife and kids like that sort of thing for God knows what reason, but and his dad, he believes the message. Not Not that the other one doesn't. He wouldn't have a Christmas tree. He wouldn't be caught. You couldn't offer him a million dollars to put a Christmas tree in house. And hey, I respect that. I respect them both. &gt;&gt; It's their house. I don't live there. Whatever. &gt;&gt; I'm saying this for a reason. Amen. When he put this Christmas tree up in his house, dad said, 'Well, listen. I'm not coming over to visit you during Christmas, just so you know. I'm not going to come over. I won't come over that time of year. I'm not going to go in there when you got that in your house. I I asked this question. I said, "If brother Ram was still alive today, would you go visit him at his house?" Oh, yeah. I'd love to go visit Brother. What if you went over to his house in December? [laughter] Yeah, &gt;&gt; cuz guess who had a tree in &gt;&gt; there? Now again, I'm not I'm more of a Hanukkah guy to be honest. &gt;&gt; I like eight days of eight nights, I guess. A father and a son disagreed on I don't know if it's fake or real. Maybe that's worth fighting over, too. How many how many missed opportunities &gt;&gt; is there in their relationship during the last two months of the year because of that? &gt;&gt; Is it really worth not even seeing them? &gt;&gt; I had the privilege about this time last year. I went to see the great pyramids of Giza. I went inside the py where talks about the king's chamber and you got to kneel. It's really cool. Um I like the Grand Canyon more though, but that's a whole another story. Um, I went in the Great Pyramid and I mean there's lines there. I I couldn't get in one day. The line was so long. It's amazing to me. DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY, I mean, they're not going anywhere. It's not like it's seasonal. It's hot there YEAR ROUND. BUT DAY AFTER [screaming] DAY AFTER DAY, PEOPLE GO IN THIS PIT. IT'S THE LAST REMAINING GREAT ONE OF THE WORLD. IT'S HUGE. AND HOW THEY BUILD IT? OF COURSE, WE KNOW WHAT A PROPHET SAID ABOUT ENOCH. I believe that. AMEN. THEY CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT. IT'S MASSIVE. [screaming] AND PEOPLE FLOCK FROM OUT AND THERE SO THERE WAS THIS THING THAT CAME UP JUST AFTER I got back and I see it's still circulating. I haven't studied it cuz honestly I don't care that much but um they think now they that they did this like ultrasound thing in the ground. There's these big huge whatever under there and it's the the pyramid. It's just the tip of it. THERE'S IT'S SO MUCH MORE MASSIVE. IT'S A BIG ENERGY thing which would make sense because brother BM said things about it. It was a nuclear age. BUT THERE'S ALL THIS STUFF THERE UNDERNEATH THEY THINK. Maybe I don't know. Again I'm just making that's not my point. ALL THIS STUFF IS MAYBE THERE. AND THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT, WELL, TOO BAD. WE DON'T WANT TO CLOSE UP SHOP BECAUSE WE GET MONEY FOR TOURISM. We're not worried about archaeology. WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT MAKING MONEY. &gt;&gt; I HAD THIS THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, I WENT THERE AND ALL THESE PEOPLE THAT COME IN THERE AND I HAD THIS THOUGHT. I MEAN, THANK GOD FOR A MESSAGE WHICH ACTUALLY tells us what THIS IS ABOUT. BUT I HAD THIS THOUGHT THOUSANDS, PROBABLY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE YEAR ROUND, THEY FLOCK TO THE PYRAMIDS AND IT'S MASSIVE AND IT'S STONE. OH, LOOK AT THIS GREAT PY MAN. THIS IS AMAZING. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN IT? THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT OR IT'S THE GREATEST. YOU YOU HAVE TO COME SEE IT. IT'S SO GREAT. WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT IT? [screaming] WE DON'T KNOW. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S SO AMAZING? WHAT WAS IT FOR? WELL, WE DON'T ACTUALLY REALLY KNOW, [screaming] &gt;&gt; BUT WE KNOW IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING, &gt;&gt; WE COULD TELL YOU WHY, [screaming] BUT IT'S A BIG DEAL. DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY &gt;&gt; WE DO THAT. IT'S A BIG DEAL. I JUST COULDN'T TELL YOU WHY. WHY IS IT HISTORICAL GUESSWORK? THERE'S ENOUGH ATTENTION THERE. DO THEY EVEN WANT [screaming] TO KNOW? &gt;&gt; I'M SAYING THIS FOR REASON. ALL THESE WONDERS, ALL THESE GREAT THINGS, THEY'RE SO MAGNIFICENT. THEY'RE SO GREAT. THEY'RE SO WONDERFUL. BUT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY THEY'RE HERE TODAY, THEY'RE GONE TOMORROW. IT'S LIKE A VAPOR. IT'S LIKE GRASS. [panting] Solomon tells this story. Solomon says, "One generation passes away. Another generation cometh, but the earth abides forever. The sun ariseth, it goes down, it hasteth. The wind goes to the south, it turns the north, it whirl about continuously. THE WIND RUNTH ACCORDING CIRCUITS. ALL RIVERS RUN INTO THE SEA, YET THE SEA IS NOT FULL. THEY ALL RETURNED FROM WHENCE THEY CAME." SEE, he knew about evaporation before the sciences. All things are FULL OF LABOR. MANK, THE EYES NOT SATISFIED WITH SEEING. THE EAR IS NOT FILLED WITH HEARING. THE THING THAT HAS BEEN IS THAT WHICH SHALL BE, and that which is done is THAT WHICH SHALL BE DONE. THERE IS NO new thing UNDER THE SUN. IS THERE ANYTHING where it may be said, see, this is new. IT HATH BEEN ALREADY of old time. There is no remembrance of former things. Neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those [laughter] that shall come after. Now, we say, "Well, we have new things." Not really. I saw this thing a while back. They're wanting to reduce our carbon emissions. So, they came up with this idea. They're going to take our great ships, these big things that haul cargo, these car, and they're going to put these huge sail like kite things on them, and they're going to pull them across the sea like, "Oh, sailboats. We've done that before. [laughter] We're just repackaging it. We call it new, but we've done something just like it before. &gt;&gt; We have AI. Well, we had idols before that spoke. What's the difference? &gt;&gt; It's just a repackaging. &gt;&gt; Because the human spirits the same. Amen. Now, I've read this for this reason. There's a story in the midrash the Jews tell. Ray probably already knows it, but everybody else probably doesn't. So, it's okay. Maybe you let me know if you know the story. Solomon, because you read the book of Ecclesiastes, Solomon had it all. He's got riches. He's got wealth. He's got peculiar treasures. He's got MAN SERVICE. M. HE'S GOT EVERYTHING. AND THE MIDASH TELLS THIS STORY. Solomon one day is getting ready to hold a feast. Do you know this one yet? I'm getting there. I'm getting there. He's getting ready to hold a feast. And he hears about a ring and he calls his wise adviser. Now, some Jews think it's because he wanted to fail so he could get fired. Fire the guy. Some think it's because he trust. But whatever the reason, he said, "I I've heard about a ring." He said, "This ring has got three words on it." And these three words, they're always true no matter what. He said, 'It has the power to bring humility to those that are in joy, and it has the power to comfort those that are in sorrow. And I want you to go find it. And the guy's like, "Okay, piece of cake, right?" Couldn't find it. Time goes on, time goes on, he's looking for it, can't find it. Gets to the day of the feast and the guy comes back to Jerusalem and he's he's as down as a guy can get about his job. He does not know what he's going to do. He can't find it. And he happens to go through the poorest district in Jerusalem. And the midrash tells this story that he gets to a peddler who's selling wares and the guy sees his face recogniz he's an imperial or whatever the king and he says well what seems to be the problem and he you know he just looks to spot says I'm looking for this ring it's supposed to take somebody it could take a man that he's at the height of his time he's having joy he's got mirth and it'll it'll it'll bring him humility it'll bring him low but the same ring these three same words they they're always true if a man is despondent if he's sad he'll read it and it'll lift his spirits and the peddler says I got exactly the thing for you. And he hands the man that ring and the man looks at that ring. The smile comes across his face. This is it. You know how it is when a plan comes together. So he goes into there to Solomon and Solomon's having this feast. And remember, he's got everything. He's got everything. You think Elon's great. Or maybe you don't. Whatever. I mean, the man's got the world in his hand. And he sees the guy come back. He's like, "Well, there's no way he did this, but oh, did you find did you find the ring?" He's like, "Yes, I did. It's right here." And Solomon, you know, he's got all this going on. He's smiling great big. He looks at the ring and he looks around and he writes this story that we read. It's three words in the Hebrew. It's four in our language. It's gamora. This too shall pass. and I've got everything. It's great. That too shall pass. &gt;&gt; It's not forever. &gt;&gt; Or church, we're we're in the biggest this and that's great, man. But that's not forever. &gt;&gt; But you know what? Neither is trials. &gt;&gt; Neither are problems. &gt;&gt; We come to the end of the Let me Let me read these scriptures real quick. I hope this is all right. Moses says this in the 90th Psalm. Lord, thou has been our dwelling place in all generations before the mountains were ever brought forth. Or thou hast ever formed the earth in the world. Even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God. THOU TURNEST MAN TO DESTRUCTION, SAY, "RETURN, ye children of men. For a thousand years in thy sight are as but a yesterday when it's passed, and a watch of the night. Thou carest them away as with a flood, and they are asleep. In the morning, they're like the grass." Notice how he's saying this. They're like the grass which growth up. In the morning it flourisheth and growth up. Even in the evening it's cut down and witherth. WE ARE CONSUMED BY THINE ANGER AND BY THY WRATH ARE WE TROUBLED. THOU HAS SET OUR iniquities before they are SECRET SINS IN THE LIGHT OF THY COUNTENANCE. ALL OUR DAYS ARE PASSED AWAY IN THY WRATH. WE SPEND OUR YEARS AS A TALE THAT IS TOLD. And he says our years are three score and 10. Or by strength they be four score. Yet their strength is in labor and sorrow. It's soon cut off. we fly away. THAT'S PRETTY BLEAK, MAN. I read that like, man, I don't feel like rejoicing too much right now. But you got to go on and read the rest. But David, if now I'm going read this here, it's the 103rd Psalm. Amen. David takes this very same thought, but it's all how you look at it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Notice what David says. Verse 6. The Lord executute righteous and judgment for all who are oppressed. He made known his ways unto Moses, the guy we just read, his acts unto the children of Israel. The Lord is merciful and gracious. He's slow to anger. &gt;&gt; Plenty. Look, you're just looking at the natural. Look at our lives. They're so brief. They're so diminishes because we've sinned. WE'VE FALLEN SHORT. THAT'S TRUE. BUT THAT'S NOT THE WHOLE PICTURE. &gt;&gt; HE'S also plenteous IN MERCY. HE [screaming] WILL NOT ALWAYS CHIDE. &gt;&gt; Neither will he keep HIS ANGER FOREVER. HE HAS NOT DEALT WITH US. OH, HALLELUJAH, SOMEBODY. HE HAS NOT [screaming] DEALT WITH US AFTER OUR SINS, nor rewarded us ACCORDING TO OUR INIQUITY. YEAH, I COULD LOOK AT I DESERVE THIS, BUT THAT'S NOT HOW GOD TREATS ME. &gt;&gt; I KNOW WHAT I DESERVE, BUT GOD DOESN'T SEE IT THAT WAY. &gt;&gt; NOTICE THIS. FOR AS THE HEAVEN IS HIGH ABOVE THE EARTH, so great is his mercy TOWARD THEM THAT FEAR HIM. AS FAR AS THE EAST IS FROM THE WEST, SO FAR HATH HE REMOVED OUR TRANSGRESSION FROM US. LIKE AS [screaming] A FATHER PITYTH HIS CHILDREN, SO THE LORD PITY THEM THAT FEAR. LISTEN, YOU'RE NOT OUT to get your own children. &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD DOESN'T LOOK AT YOU AS THE COSMIC PROBLEM HE'S GOT TO DEAL WITH THIS MORNING. YOU'RE HIS CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T SIT THERE, WELL, you should know better now this. YEAH, YOU PROBABLY SHOULD know better. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? But you're his children. &gt;&gt; He has pity for you. I just want something better for you. So the Lord pityth them, notice this, that fear him, for he knoweth our frame. HE REMEMBERETH THAT WE ARE DUST. NOW SOMETIMES you forget that. &gt;&gt; Well, I should be better than this. Well, listen. This thing, you're going to have trouble with it the rest of your life, but that doesn't make you not his child. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I got troubles now, and I still got troubles. But that shall not always That too shall pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not. His anger doesn't abide forever. Notice this verse 15. As for men, his days are his grass. Same thing Moses said. See, his days are his grass. As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. For the wind passeth over and it is gone, and the place thereof shall know no more. If he stopped there, there'd be a little sabbath. The next verse, but the mercy of the Lord &gt;&gt; is from everlasting &gt;&gt; to everlasting upon them that fear him and his righteousness unto children's children. There's the one thing that shall not pass. &gt;&gt; We come to the year, you know, the year's ended and you know, I'll just say this as I'm closing. You know, some people they've gone on to their reward. I don't know. what the the census is here. But some people they've gone on to the reward. Some maybe have added children. It's always changing. Amen. &gt;&gt; If the Lord carries another year and we're all here together next year again, that might change. Amen. You don't know. You don't know if you'll be here five minutes from now. Some of us had troubles last year and we can say they're gone this year. Some of you didn't have certain troubles last year and you've got them now. Some of you might have had troubles last year and you still got them. DON'T. BUT NO MATTER where you're at with that, just remember that too shall pass. &gt;&gt; That's not who you are. Amen. By God's grace, you are where you're at today. God brought you here a very long way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe you've got a mountain that's been there longer than you want to be. Maybe it's been there a long time, but one day we'll soon be done with troubles and trials. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll look back and it'll all be worth it. Amen. It is not worthy to be compared. your troubles and troubles are not worthy. That little fuss, that little hang up in your It's not worthy. &gt;&gt; It's all worth letting go. &gt;&gt; So that's my This too shall that's the title, by the way. This two shall pass before it passes. It's all It's not a big deal. &gt;&gt; Heaven's a big deal. &gt;&gt; God's mercy is a big deal. &gt;&gt; Amen. Letting go is a big deal. &gt;&gt; Amen. Stand to your feet today. Maybe maybe there'll be someone here. You don't have to tell me or whatever, but maybe you're in a marriage or a home. Maybe there's maybe there's little unresolved things in your life. This moment will pass. Amen. And you can let that thing pass with it or you can carry it forward and it's not going to help you one bit. Maybe a husband and wife. Maybe it's time to make Maybe it's time to make some make a forgiveness. Maybe it's time to restore communication. Maybe you say, "You know what? I'm not as close to God as I used to be. I want to get closer." Well, I wouldn't wait till next year. &gt;&gt; Don't wait till December 31st. &gt;&gt; All these things. Maybe you're on top of the world. Say, "I'm too good for this church. I don't need these people. That'll pass, too. It's all fleeting. It's amazing to me. Solomon, now if you read the book of Ecclesiastes, you don't finish it. You're going to get depressed. You got to finish it. He looks at all this stuff that he has. He's like, you know what? It's all vanity. It means nothing. These women, these men, these go, it's nothing. He goes through all this stuff. He finally applies wisdom in his heart. He said, "YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S HEAR THE CONCLUSION OF THE MATTER. Fear God and keep his commandments." I'm thinking, man, that's sad that he waited till the end of his life to get that. &gt;&gt; That'd be sad to wait that long. &gt;&gt; Amen. Seek him while he may be found. Amen. God bless you today.
