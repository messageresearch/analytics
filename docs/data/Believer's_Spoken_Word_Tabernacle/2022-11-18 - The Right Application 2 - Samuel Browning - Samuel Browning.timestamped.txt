[37:25] Stephen West asked me just to pass this
[37:28] along to you regarding
[37:30] his mother
[37:31] she's been he just he texts me here
[37:34] about an hour ago and let me know that
[37:36] his mother is she just had had a heart
[37:39] surgery bypass surgery here just on
[37:42] yesterday and he just said that they
[37:45] have the balloon they've removed from
[37:48] her heart she's up drinking juices and
[37:51] water she's doing very good so he asked
[37:53] me to thank you for your prayers
[37:55] continue
[37:59] we just want to continue to keep
[38:02] sister in prayer the Lord will just
[38:04] continue to
[38:05] move for her in a special way and I know
[38:09] there's many different many different
[38:11] needs that are among us as well and
[38:14] other needs too and I'm just so thankful
[38:16] God's mindful of every need
[38:18] amen whether it's spoken or it's
[38:20] unspoken God's mindful of it yeah
[38:23] I tell you I'm just so thankful that
[38:26] before anything could ever arise or
[38:29] anything take place I'm grateful that
[38:31] he's already got everything covered
[38:34] aren't you he's got it all covered you
[38:37] find that every time that there was the
[38:41] um a situation arose God used the
[38:44] situation as an opportunity to just make
[38:47] himself known in a greater way
[38:50] and the situations would never be
[38:52] situations that we in our Humanity would
[38:55] choose
[38:56] but God knows in His Infinite Wisdom
[38:59] and each time you find when Israel would
[39:02] come into a situation
[39:05] God was not without an answer for that
[39:07] but he would reveal another one of his
[39:10] compound Redemptive names
[39:12] and he would make himself known I'm God
[39:15] in this situation
[39:16] and God right here right now
[39:19] and I'm just thankful for that because
[39:21] we know all of that it spoke
[39:25] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[39:27] and to know that no matter what the
[39:29] situation is God's got it covered
[39:34] got it covered
[39:35] he's not far off somewhere he's right
[39:38] here with us I just say Lord I want to
[39:41] draw nigh to him I want my thoughts I
[39:44] want my mind I want my heart I want
[39:46] everything to draw nigh to him just to
[39:48] welcome him like the songs that we were
[39:50] just singing here I just want to set at
[39:53] your feet Lord
[39:54] and like that of el Shady eye I just
[39:57] want to want to draw from you Lord
[39:59] Abraham says it's not it's not the milk
[40:01] from the breast that actually brings the
[40:03] calming to the baby it's hearing that
[40:06] heartbeat
[40:07] and that's what that's what it is
[40:09] getting close to God and draw nine to
[40:12] God and it's just it's hearing him
[40:14] amen aren't you grateful
[40:17] amen I'm glad that God's made a way for
[40:19] us amen let's just go to the Lord in a
[40:21] word of prayer before we open the word
[40:24] Heavenly Father Lord we are standing
[40:28] here this evening Lord
[40:30] what an opportunity Lord that we have
[40:32] and you've given to us Lord that God in
[40:36] the midst of this
[40:37] in Time Lord that we're living how we
[40:40] thank you Lord for your grace Lord that
[40:43] God not only as you would send the
[40:45] promise of the evening light but oh God
[40:48] that we would be partakers of that Grace
[40:50] Lord in this hour Lord and father that's
[40:54] the Lord and we are so grateful because
[40:56] the Lord if Grace is removed from the
[40:59] equation then we don't have a chance
[41:01] whatsoever Lord but we're thankful God
[41:04] for your grace that comes Lord Upon Our
[41:07] Lives to correct us to teach us to lead
[41:10] us to fill us to deliver us Lord oh God
[41:14] we are just so thankful for the grace of
[41:17] God and Lord Jesus we just asked tonight
[41:20] Lord that you'll just draw near to us
[41:23] Lord our desire Lord is the songs of
[41:26] Zion have been sung and we've come Lord
[41:29] and we've gathered the sacrifice Lord
[41:31] has been made Lord together in your
[41:34] presence Lord to lay aside all of the
[41:37] cares and the toils of life and even as
[41:40] we've entered into this place tonight
[41:42] Lord to even lay aside those thoughts of
[41:45] our mind or thoughts Lord that are
[41:47] oppressive to us the Lord or depressive
[41:50] Lord we just lay them aside at your feet
[41:54] Lord we cast all our care upon you for
[41:57] you care for us Lord and we just the
[42:00] Lord Jesus stand here tonight Lord oh
[42:04] God in need of your touch Lord we need
[42:08] to hear from you once again Lord but God
[42:11] just a word from you Lord would mean
[42:13] more Lord than countless words that
[42:16] could be spoken Lord so we ask that God
[42:19] that you'll just reserve us the Lord
[42:21] that it might be just you that would
[42:24] speak what is necessary Lord and guide
[42:27] us the Lord in the pathways Lord that
[42:29] you see that's needful for us as your
[42:32] children Lord for we lord stand here o

[44:00] Hallelujah
[44:02] Hallelujah
[44:04] glory be to God
[44:07] Hallelujah let's turn in our Bibles to
[44:10] First Peter chapter 4.
[44:12] in verse 12.
[44:14] this is a familiar scripture to us
[44:26] I just want to ask you to be in prayer
[44:29] Lord willing early tomorrow morning I
[44:32] leave out for Canada for the weekend and
[44:34] then I'll be back here in on I think our
[44:37] flights are supposed to my flight's
[44:39] supposed to come back in early on Monday
[44:40] I just ask that you'd just be in prayer
[44:42] for that God give us just safe traveling
[44:45] Mercies
[44:47] to be with brother Ivan Carr brother
[44:49] Carmen Mills and we're just going there
[44:52] just to minister to them
[44:54] the saints that are there
[44:56] so we just just covet your prayers and
[45:01] just for the meetings and
[45:04] secondarily I would ask that I would
[45:07] have just
[45:09] the flights you know I sometimes I don't
[45:11] like the layovers you have them but I
[45:15] don't when it comes to sometimes there's
[45:16] been situations where they'll come to me
[45:18] and say oh sorry we're not going to be
[45:20] able to get on that flight and that's a
[45:22] I said no no no no no no no no no I
[45:25] gotta get back I gotta get back
[45:28] and you know sometimes God in His Grace
[45:31] has allowed situations to where we are
[45:34] able to get on a flight somewhere like
[45:35] the last time I was coming back out of
[45:37] Texas and you know it just to me is no
[45:40] place like home
[45:42] and uh and when I say home I'm not just
[45:44] talking about my house I'm talking about
[45:46] you all
[45:48] I'm not just talking about my house if
[45:50] if it wasn't for you all and the burden
[45:53] that God is placing my heart well then
[45:55] what what would what would home be
[45:57] what would home be
[45:59] and so let's look here just real quick
[46:02] in verse 12 of First Peter chapter 4
[46:07] verse 12. beloved
[46:09] think it not strange
[46:12] concerning the fiery trial which is to
[46:15] try you
[46:16] as though some strange thing happened to
[46:20] you
[46:21] but rejoice
[46:23] inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's
[46:26] sufferings how many can say Lord I need
[46:28] help
[46:29] but Rejoice I got both of my hands up I
[46:32] need help Lord because you see there's a
[46:35] part of me now understand this there's a
[46:36] part of me just like there is of you
[46:38] that my flesh does not want to Rejoice
[46:41] nor does it ever welcome test or trials
[46:45] is that right
[46:47] but here once that part when we can
[46:50] recognize where we're our standing is
[46:53] with God then that's where we can
[46:55] Rejoice because you realize you cannot
[46:58] lose with the Lord
[47:01] so our rejoicing is not about the test
[47:04] or the trial but our rejoicing is we
[47:07] cannot lose with God
[47:10] Amen in as much as you are partakers of
[47:13] Christ's sufferings that when his glory
[47:16] shall be revealed ye may be glad also
[47:20] with exceeding Joy may God bless you
[47:23] bless the reading of the word as you're
[47:25] being seated
[47:27] I'd like also to refer to another
[47:29] scripture here that we're familiar with
[47:31] in an earlier part of Peter
[47:34] where Peter would speak from verse 6 and
[47:37] he would deal with what we are the
[47:39] direction of where we are headed
[47:41] because we are we are headed we know
[47:44] where we're standing in this hour we are
[47:46] looking right here for rapture
[47:50] and we are this is an age and a moment
[47:52] that we are promised that
[47:55] so we are greatly rejoicing in that we
[47:58] know not just the promise of the Rapture
[48:01] but we know in whom we have believed as
[48:04] the Saints of all ages because this
[48:06] scripture was written to all of the
[48:08] Believers there of all ages but to think
[48:11] of where we are standing in this moment
[48:14] just as much as the Believers before us
[48:16] there is a certainty about our heart and
[48:19] our life and that's what I pray is with
[48:21] every life tonight wherein you greatly
[48:23] Rejoice though now for a season if need
[48:28] be ye are in heaviness through manifold
[48:31] temptations that the trial of your faith
[48:34] being much more precious than of gold
[48:37] that perisheth though it be tried with
[48:39] fire and might be found unto praise and
[48:42] honor and Glory at the appearing of
[48:44] Jesus Christ whom having not seen ye
[48:47] love in whom though now you see him not
[48:51] yet believing ye Rejoice with joy and
[48:54] speak of herbal and full of Glory so
[48:58] nowhere is the trial joyous
[49:03] nowhere is the test joyous now I know
[49:06] I'm speaking to you because I've talked
[49:08] to some of you back there I've talked to
[49:10] people on the phone and I know right now
[49:12] there's not one Angel setting in here
[49:14] tonight because you ain't you ain't
[49:16] never going to be an angel you are
[49:18] intended to be a human
[49:20] right and we know how when things come
[49:23] about on our lives no matter how long
[49:26] we've been serving God now it's always
[49:28] easy when we can look at somebody else
[49:30] and see something and I don't want to
[49:32] just say that it's it's easy but you
[49:34] know it's it's it does US good to
[49:35] remember of where God and the God's
[49:39] comfort and his care and how he has
[49:42] brought us through you know sometimes we
[49:44] don't know with circumstances and
[49:46] situations and we can maybe look at
[49:49] somebody who's sick or who's suffering
[49:50] and we can just tell them you need to
[49:53] have faith in God you need to believe
[49:55] but let's turn the table what about when
[49:57] you're sick
[49:58] let's turn the table let's just come and
[50:01] let's preach at you and say have faith
[50:04] you just need to have faith
[50:06] but don't put that Tylenol bottle down
[50:08] you just need to have faith what's wrong
[50:11] with you let's turn the tables you see
[50:12] sometimes this is why listen that even
[50:16] when sickness and trials and things
[50:18] comes our way God knows what he's doing
[50:21] to temper and move out Pride that can
[50:25] get stuck in our life let me just tell
[50:27] you our first birth is a product of
[50:31] Pride and reasoning
[50:33] and there is always a battle against
[50:37] Pride
[50:39] is that right there's always it and
[50:41] that's why even Paul could say lest I
[50:44] would become exalted above the abundance
[50:46] of the revelation God has seen that I
[50:50] need Divine assistance to keep myself in
[50:53] a place where he can reveal more to me
[50:57] aren't you glad for divine assistance
[51:00] I'm so thankful even though God entrust
[51:02] you and I that we would keep our lives
[51:04] in such a place but God says I know the
[51:07] weakness of humanity God doesn't have
[51:09] question of his life or the strength
[51:11] within us but God knows that you and I
[51:14] what we have need of at different times
[51:16] that will cause us to keep looking up
[51:18] and be in a place where he can use us
[51:20] I'm grateful for that aren't you I'm not
[51:22] grateful for the test or the trial per
[51:24] se as far as everything that goes on
[51:26] around but I'm grateful for his grace
[51:28] that carries us through now notice
[51:30] brother Brown would say it like this in
[51:32] the Ephesian Church age this is just one
[51:34] of the statements that brother Brandon
[51:36] would make and you know this regarding
[51:37] tests and trials persecution and trials
[51:40] are a natural normal part of the
[51:45] Christian Life
[51:46] there is only one thing you can do about
[51:49] them
[51:51] commit them all to God
[51:53] judge not and leave their outworking and
[51:59] final judgment to him
[52:02] oh I'm grateful that means that I don't
[52:05] have to figure out
[52:06] what's going on
[52:09] I can just commit it to him my God
[52:11] that's not entrusted you nor me that we
[52:14] would have to understand if we
[52:15] understand then why do we need faith
[52:19] but we didn't we don't we walk we trust
[52:22] in the Lord now I want to just continue
[52:25] to deal with this thought here just a
[52:27] moment on the right application and you
[52:30] know we could go on and on with this
[52:31] part of it we looked at it last week how
[52:33] that many of job's uh friends that came
[52:38] to him the things that they were
[52:41] expressing job was able to say to them
[52:44] over and over I know the things that
[52:47] you're saying I know them
[52:50] I'm not inferior to you I know these
[52:54] things that you are rehearsing
[52:57] but job was standing there and realizing
[52:59] these guys are like eye surgeons trying
[53:03] to perform heart surgery
[53:05] it ain't applying to the situation
[53:07] that's why Joe could say over and over
[53:10] they are not giving an answer
[53:13] even when Ella who would come and rebuke
[53:16] them along with job and he would rebuke
[53:19] them because they were not giving an
[53:22] answer or the right application now
[53:25] there's many examples that I could give
[53:28] here tonight as things that the Lord
[53:30] just bring into my heart even last week
[53:32] before I spoke of things that we could
[53:35] see even in the message and perhaps here
[53:38] in one of the services we'll get into it
[53:40] that we can see what a blessing it is
[53:43] that when the right application comes
[53:46] and understanding opens to a heart that
[53:50] is wandering and maybe thinking
[53:52] something a certain way let me just give
[53:53] you one remember on deep calls to the
[53:56] Deep the sister that comes up there and
[53:58] she comes up and brother Brian says oh
[54:00] he says I I see you said uh oh he says
[54:02] there's a darkness that that's following
[54:04] it wasn't any darkness in her but he
[54:06] says what it was it was a lying Spirit
[54:08] she wasn't a liar but what it was there
[54:12] was a man professing to be a Divine
[54:15] healer that had called her out and
[54:18] called her a witch
[54:20] it wasn't true
[54:23] but because she got to entertaining that
[54:26] now brother Ben said from that one thing
[54:28] he says it has affected the church he
[54:32] said it's even caused a sickness within
[54:34] your pastor
[54:36] now I can preach on that for a little
[54:38] bit right there there's no doubt that
[54:40] the you know we don't know all that was
[54:42] going on but what was happening the
[54:44] wrong application was bringing that
[54:48] disturbance
[54:49] but the right application brings freedom
[54:53] the right application brings Liberty
[54:56] remember like we looked at last week if
[54:58] you just had the blood of the Lamb you
[55:02] wasn't complying it right it had to be
[55:04] applied upon the door pose and upon the
[55:07] lentils of the door it had to be applied
[55:10] in the right way and when it was applied
[55:12] then there was Liberty then there was
[55:15] security we could really look at the
[55:18] blood without fear
[55:21] are you hearing me now yeah yeah all of
[55:23] the word of God remember the word became
[55:27] blood
[55:29] the word was made flesh and dwelt Among
[55:32] Us so in the right application of the
[55:36] word is present we are looking at the
[55:39] blood and there's no fear nor
[55:43] condemnation
[55:45] but if it's not applied correctly it
[55:49] brings fear
[55:51] torment
[55:52] confusion lack of confidence
[55:55] now I'm not just talking about upon our
[55:58] soul it should be there upon our soul
[56:01] God came in this hour to bring a right
[56:03] application where many things had been
[56:06] called the new birth
[56:09] right shaking hands name on a church
[56:12] book oh I felt this or I felt that or
[56:14] chills ran down there but God brought
[56:17] the right application why that's what's
[56:21] needed for The Exodus
[56:25] Hallelujah so with that I'm so thankful
[56:28] that God has given Grace and access that
[56:33] we might be able
[56:35] to apply the word correctly
[56:38] I would say that probably every one of
[56:40] us in here can actually be able to say
[56:42] you know what there's things I thought
[56:44] at one time I no longer think
[56:48] that's true you grow right if you're not
[56:51] growing you're not maturing
[56:53] right
[56:54] so I thank God for that
[56:56] now I want to just look here at a few
[56:58] things that job when job is looking here
[57:01] in the midst of the trial
[57:03] I want to just go into some of these
[57:05] places here where job here is job I want
[57:08] you to remind I want to remind you here
[57:11] is a prophet of God
[57:14] here is one that has received
[57:17] visitation from God
[57:20] here is a man that is has a revelation
[57:23] of the sacrifice that if I will offer
[57:27] this sacrifice God will honor his word
[57:31] and I can stand upon that
[57:34] so we're not just talking about a man
[57:36] who has come into church and then you
[57:39] don't seem until a Revival comes around
[57:41] and then he pops back up and Manny looks
[57:43] like he's got the Victory and then the
[57:45] Revival's over and he's gone we're not
[57:48] talking about that kind of a man we're
[57:50] talking about one who is solidly
[57:53] positioned by God himself
[57:57] are you hearing me now we're talking
[57:59] about a man that God called a testimony
[58:02] meeting about it's one thing if I called
[58:05] a testimony meeting it's another thing
[58:07] if God called a testimony meeting
[58:10] and God just didn't call one of them he
[58:12] called two testimony meetings
[58:17] and he bragged on job
[58:19] what was he bragging on not job's flesh
[58:26] not Joe's Flash
[58:28] he was bragging on that part of himself
[58:32] that lay within job that job had
[58:37] surrendered to and it had taken a hold
[58:39] upon his life he was bragging on his
[58:43] word
[58:45] because God knows within our flesh is
[58:48] nothing
[58:51] there's no flesh and glory in his
[58:54] presence
[58:56] 6 verse 1.
[58:58] job answered and said oh that my grief
[59:04] were thoroughly weighed
[59:06] and my Calamity laid in the balances
[59:08] together
[59:09] for now it would be heavier
[59:12] than the sand of the sea
[59:15] how many knows that you can't number the
[59:17] Sands of the sea
[59:20] God's job said if you take grief and
[59:22] collect
[59:26] and come to the Sea over here my grief
[59:29] and Calamity would tip the skill and the
[59:32] sands
[59:33] could be lifted up
[59:37] wow
[59:39] therefore my words are swallowed up in
[59:44] other words I'm not having any reprieve
[59:48] for my words that I'm giving forth
[59:50] there's no reprieve now in between all
[59:53] these moments here that are taking place
[59:55] how long how many minutes were there
[59:57] hours were there I don't know in between
[59:59] all of this right here there's no doubt
[1:00:01] there are moments in here that you can
[1:00:03] read and infer job was praying and
[1:00:07] seeking after God
[1:00:09] verse 4.
[1:00:11] for the arrows of the Almighty are
[1:00:15] within me
[1:00:17] the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit
[1:00:24] the Terrors of God do set themselves in
[1:00:27] a ray
[1:00:28] against me
[1:00:30] I want you to think of this in verse 4
[1:00:32] as you look at this
[1:00:33] he has already he's just declared
[1:00:37] that what is in my life and has taken
[1:00:40] place is the arrows of the Almighty
[1:00:43] he's not called it the arrows of the
[1:00:46] devil
[1:00:47] but it's the arrows of the almighty are
[1:00:50] drinking up my spirit in other words I
[1:00:53] don't want to go on living
[1:00:57] I can't even focus on or even think
[1:01:01] about the next moment the things that I
[1:01:03] once had Joy about I no longer have joy
[1:01:09] let me say this to you before I go on
[1:01:12] his removal of Joy had nothing to do
[1:01:16] with the circumstances that was around
[1:01:19] him
[1:01:20] his removal of joy is because of this
[1:01:24] right here he thought it was God doing
[1:01:27] it
[1:01:30] the joy of the Lord
[1:01:33] is my strength
[1:01:37] the Terrors of God do set themselves an
[1:01:40] array against me listen if God's for you
[1:01:42] who's going to be for you
[1:01:44] if God if God is the Bible said if God
[1:01:46] is for me who could be against me but if
[1:01:49] it looks like God is against you
[1:01:52] who's going to stand up
[1:01:55] come on now
[1:01:57] therefore now let us go here in Job
[1:02:00] chapter 7 verse 11. therefore I will not
[1:02:04] refrain my mouth I will speak in the
[1:02:07] anguish of my spirit I will complain in
[1:02:10] the bitterness of my soul now I want you
[1:02:12] to think of this here job is not saying
[1:02:15] I am a bitter person
[1:02:18] he's speaking of the circumstance
[1:02:23] my brother and sister because Satan's
[1:02:26] desire would love to see that of that of
[1:02:28] the trial and things come our way that
[1:02:31] were actually embitter a person
[1:02:35] to where just to get around him leaves a
[1:02:38] bad taste in your mouth
[1:02:40] would it be a refreshing is that right I
[1:02:43] mean when Paul wrote to to Philemon just
[1:02:45] a letter to when he wrote that to Flame
[1:02:48] and he said thou art a refreshing to the
[1:02:51] brother then that what the testimony you
[1:02:53] want to be out of your life I don't want
[1:02:55] it to be when I come around oh good lord
[1:02:56] Here Comes brother Samuel he's as
[1:02:58] negative as all can be Lord have mercy
[1:03:00] let me out of here
[1:03:03] anybody like being around negative
[1:03:04] people do you feel refreshed
[1:03:07] hello somebody
[1:03:09] now come on now listen sometimes we can
[1:03:12] be prone to that in our Humanity
[1:03:16] there's things to recognize it's not
[1:03:18] looking at all together saying God I
[1:03:21] want you to strip this out of me
[1:03:22] permanently I can show you throughout
[1:03:25] the years right here where brother
[1:03:27] Branham would gather with his wife and
[1:03:30] say I've purposed in my Heart Holy Ghost
[1:03:32] series we purpose in our heart across
[1:03:34] the dewfold never to let a negative
[1:03:37] thought come in my heart again
[1:03:40] end of 1959 December right
[1:03:43] adoption series May 1960. Lord God
[1:03:48] excuse to blast out every negative
[1:03:51] thought out of my heart you know what it
[1:03:52] shows that negative can come and
[1:03:55] sometimes we can be more susceptible to
[1:03:58] it but all how we need the washing of
[1:04:02] Water by the word
[1:04:05] God is not interested in perfecting our
[1:04:09] Humanity what he's interested in is that
[1:04:12] as a son or daughter of God his glory is
[1:04:16] manifested in a Reign Over Our Frailty
[1:04:22] say God help me
[1:04:26] I will complain
[1:04:28] in the bitterness of my soul
[1:04:31] Now watch how job perfect you know sets
[1:04:34] these questions
[1:04:36] am I a c now he's asking this is what
[1:04:38] he's putting forth before God am I a c
[1:04:43] or a well that thou set us to Watch Over
[1:04:45] Me In other words that I've got
[1:04:47] boundaries
[1:04:49] I don't know about you I've never seen a
[1:04:50] whale come out and walk on water
[1:04:52] I've never seen a whale come out on the
[1:04:53] land
[1:04:54] right and then the sea itself has
[1:04:57] borders and boundaries when it goes to
[1:04:59] encroach the moon will say no get back
[1:05:01] get back get back get back and job said
[1:05:03] what is this there's this something I
[1:05:05] can't get out of
[1:05:09] now I know I might be expressing it in
[1:05:11] this way
[1:05:13] but remember let me get I'll get to
[1:05:15] something here a little bit more
[1:05:17] you can see the frustration and the
[1:05:19] confusion that is there within job's
[1:05:22] life in this time
[1:05:26] when I say verse 13 my bed shall comfort
[1:05:30] me my couch shall ease my complaints
[1:05:36] let's interpret this right here when I
[1:05:38] say my phone watching a couple YouTube
[1:05:41] videos will ease my complaint
[1:05:44] it's going to sleep you know it was one
[1:05:47] thing you know my my daddy would it was
[1:05:49] in a way he just had a way about it and
[1:05:51] God allowed him to have it that way but
[1:05:53] my daddy was one that could say I'm
[1:05:54] stressed I'm you know I'm he I knew when
[1:05:56] he was really stressed because he'd go
[1:05:58] take a nap
[1:05:59] I'm not built that way
[1:06:01] when I'm stressed sleep goes far from me
[1:06:04] now that's just me that's how I'm built
[1:06:08] but you know when you think about my bed
[1:06:10] oh my bed oh my bed will come from me I
[1:06:13] can sleep and escape this
[1:06:18] my couch shall ease my complaint
[1:06:24] but
[1:06:26] this is what job says Lord then thou
[1:06:29] scarest me with dreams and terrifies me
[1:06:32] with visions God wasn't doing that a bit
[1:06:34] it's what job allowed in his mind while
[1:06:37] he was awake are you hearing me now
[1:06:39] we're going to preach with him while
[1:06:40] he's here
[1:06:42] just listen these are things remember
[1:06:44] Brother Brad tells us with the
[1:06:45] subconscious it's what you entertain
[1:06:49] things that you entertain that's why
[1:06:52] it's so important that not only do you
[1:06:54] open the day the morning with the lamb
[1:06:57] calls it out in the evening with the
[1:06:59] lamb it doesn't mean oh brother Sammy
[1:07:01] you tell me I'll never have a bad
[1:07:03] dreamer I'm not telling you that but I
[1:07:06] am telling you this that when you come
[1:07:08] out of it no there is the Lamb who is
[1:07:10] there and watching over you and you know
[1:07:13] by your heart's desire this is my desire
[1:07:16] and thank God for the way of Escape
[1:07:20] glory be to God in the same way there's
[1:07:23] an escape out of that dream there's an
[1:07:25] escape out of every test and every trial
[1:07:28] and one of these mornings there'll be an
[1:07:30] escape out of this Mortal body
[1:07:35] glory be to God
[1:07:37] so that my soul
[1:07:39] here's what happens so that my soul
[1:07:43] chooseth
[1:07:44] strangling and death
[1:07:47] rather than my life
[1:07:49] I loaf it
[1:07:52] I would not live always
[1:07:54] let me alone for my days
[1:07:57] are vanity
[1:07:59] hmm
[1:08:01] what is man
[1:08:03] that thou shouldest Magnify Him you know
[1:08:05] what's incredible when you read through
[1:08:07] all this here
[1:08:08] is you still find the humanity that we
[1:08:11] can see in our own selves
[1:08:13] that part about us that's still self
[1:08:17] right still about self and that's why we
[1:08:20] have to die to ourselves daily let a man
[1:08:24] take up his cross daily and follow me
[1:08:27] it's a continual mortification and
[1:08:31] crucifixion of self
[1:08:34] oh how easy it is in the midst of this
[1:08:36] time to revert to self verse 17 what is
[1:08:40] man that thou shouldest Magnify Him and
[1:08:43] that thou should have set thine heart
[1:08:44] upon him and that thou shouldest visit
[1:08:46] him every morning and try him every
[1:08:50] moment
[1:08:52] how long will thou not depart from me
[1:08:55] nor let me alone till I swallow down my
[1:08:58] spittle now he's talking to the Lord I
[1:09:00] have sinned what shall I do unto thee Oh
[1:09:03] thou preserver of men why hast thou set
[1:09:06] me as a mark against thee so that I am a
[1:09:09] burden to myself
[1:09:12] oh my why does thou not pardon my
[1:09:16] transgression and take away my iniquity
[1:09:19] for now shall I sleep in the dust and
[1:09:22] thou shalt seek me in the morning but I
[1:09:24] shall not be
[1:09:26] remember
[1:09:28] prophet of God
[1:09:30] but he doesn't know
[1:09:33] that this is actually
[1:09:35] God's approval
[1:09:39] he doesn't know
[1:09:40] this isn't chastening it's got approving
[1:09:45] he doesn't know that it's God actually
[1:09:47] purging
[1:09:51] oh my God he doesn't know he doesn't
[1:09:53] understand that
[1:09:55] that he's looking at it in a way of
[1:09:58] manner he goes he noticed he knows that
[1:10:00] there's no one greater than God he knows
[1:10:04] he has met God's requirement but he
[1:10:06] doesn't understand what is taking place
[1:10:14] and not I say this he's no different
[1:10:16] than you or I
[1:10:19] true oh brother Samuel I've got the Holy
[1:10:21] Ghost well brother Bram tells us and be
[1:10:22] certain of God
[1:10:24] that how the first thing that we're to
[1:10:26] do is to examine our own life
[1:10:30] this first thing before we're going to
[1:10:31] ask for prayer or let's examine our own
[1:10:34] life he said when we've met God's
[1:10:36] requirements then we can be certain of
[1:10:38] God
[1:10:39] now one thing about it God is not one
[1:10:41] who plays hide and seek God don't play
[1:10:44] around with people he don't play in hide
[1:10:45] and say yes yes guess what it is guess
[1:10:48] what that is not God whatsoever God is
[1:10:51] very direct if there's an issue God's
[1:10:55] direct and he doesn't say it may be sore
[1:10:58] could be this that's not how God works
[1:11:03] amen
[1:11:05] so the first thing is we look and say
[1:11:08] Lord what's going on
[1:11:10] what's taking place
[1:11:13] what's what's what's going on in here
[1:11:18] brother says it like this
[1:11:20] in three kinds of Believers you're
[1:11:22] familiar with this statement
[1:11:24] sometimes he said Believers are put to
[1:11:26] the test sometimes
[1:11:28] not sometimes every time
[1:11:30] every son that cometh to God must be
[1:11:32] chasing trial child tried tried and
[1:11:35] child trained remember he says the
[1:11:38] trials the Dusty Rhodes
[1:11:41] the hot son of persecution
[1:11:43] you know those words right there we
[1:11:45] could preach a month on that Dusty
[1:11:47] Rhodes the hot son of persecution what
[1:11:49] is that where's the water at
[1:11:52] where's the refreshing
[1:11:54] where's the refreshing Lord where's the
[1:11:56] refreshing
[1:11:58] the hot sons of persecution
[1:12:01] but you know
[1:12:03] if God if everything was a golly Wisher
[1:12:06] and water flowing all the time we'd
[1:12:09] never appreciate
[1:12:11] over and over God works by a law of
[1:12:15] contrast
[1:12:17] right that's why brother Brandon says he
[1:12:19] said I that's why I believe he said
[1:12:21] we'll enjoy heaven so much is because we
[1:12:23] lived in this life at one time
[1:12:26] and it's the contrast
[1:12:28] of these things
[1:12:30] notice he says but it's the Loyalty of
[1:12:33] your heart that beats that material
[1:12:35] until she's ready to go into the mold
[1:12:37] what is the loyalty of our heart
[1:12:40] not our thinking
[1:12:43] job's thinking is out of line but it's
[1:12:46] his heart standing there on the word of
[1:12:48] God that's beating it into the place to
[1:12:53] where it's ready to go into the mold
[1:12:55] look at God's children it's made up
[1:12:57] correctly on his word for they are
[1:12:59] living examples and the word of God
[1:13:01] living through them the trial comes to
[1:13:03] shake you to put you to the very bottom
[1:13:06] to see where you'll stand
[1:13:10] well he says job went through the trials
[1:13:13] and tests his children taking everyone
[1:13:15] out everything else taken the church
[1:13:17] members come accused him of being a
[1:13:19] secret sinner tried to say everything
[1:13:21] against him but yet he wouldn't listen
[1:13:23] to any of it
[1:13:25] he knowed he had met God's requirements
[1:13:28] and we'll look at that in just a moment
[1:13:30] he knowed there's no need of Satan
[1:13:33] trying to tempt him he knowed it was the
[1:13:35] devil now watch this statement here he
[1:13:38] knowed it was the devil and as long as
[1:13:41] Satan can make him believe that his
[1:13:44] sickness was his God doing it he had
[1:13:47] joked with
[1:13:49] I don't know about you I've looked at
[1:13:51] this quote I could quote this quote I
[1:13:53] can go through it I've preached on this
[1:13:55] matter of fact I think from when even
[1:13:57] I'm preaching on job went through those
[1:13:58] who remember when I first stepped in as
[1:14:01] Pastor back there in 2002 I preached on
[1:14:03] a series going through things with job
[1:14:06] and even when reading through that and
[1:14:08] pondering on that statement as long as
[1:14:11] Satan could make him think it was his
[1:14:14] God doing it he had job with I think
[1:14:17] about it I just know it's the Lord just
[1:14:19] here within the past weeks and so forth
[1:14:21] actually months I've pondered this quote
[1:14:23] I've looked at it it hadn't been me I
[1:14:25] know it's been God that's brought it to
[1:14:27] my attention just to ponder over it just
[1:14:29] to meditate on it because here is a
[1:14:32] prophet of God
[1:14:34] but yet in these scriptures that I've
[1:14:36] read and will read you're reading a man
[1:14:39] who is whipped all right what's he
[1:14:43] whipped by his thoughts
[1:14:46] you think your thoughts don't matter
[1:14:48] your thoughts do matter
[1:14:51] oh brother Samuel the Mind means nothing
[1:14:53] I there's too much in the word of God
[1:14:55] and the prophet even tells us you can't
[1:14:58] even be born again unless the word
[1:15:01] travels through your mind and you accept
[1:15:04] it and believe it
[1:15:06] and brother Brahm says after he says
[1:15:07] that spoken words Original Seed he said
[1:15:09] I believe Saint Paul would shout when he
[1:15:11] heard me say that
[1:15:14] to an angel so lose your mind you don't
[1:15:16] lose your mind that's why brother Rams
[1:15:18] says when you come to the altar oh clear
[1:15:19] out your thoughts clear out your
[1:15:21] thoughts brother Rand said you're just
[1:15:22] opening yourself up to an evil spirit it
[1:15:25] ain't clear out your thoughts it's
[1:15:27] Center your thoughts on him
[1:15:30] that's why brother random said with a
[1:15:32] worker who comes to get along somebody
[1:15:35] again the receiving the Holy Ghost he
[1:15:38] said begin to quote the promise to them
[1:15:43] y'all hear me
[1:15:45] quote the promise to them well if that's
[1:15:47] how it is with receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:15:50] how about any other promise
[1:16:04] as long as Satan can believe make him
[1:16:06] believe that his sickness was his God
[1:16:08] doing it
[1:16:09] he had Joe whipped
[1:16:11] but when job once struck that Revelation
[1:16:13] that it was not God
[1:16:15] he was only going through his trials to
[1:16:16] make him something it wasn't God doing
[1:16:18] it it was Satan
[1:16:20] brother Brown said the same thing
[1:16:23] you're trying to tell you
[1:16:25] his trials on things as your God trying
[1:16:27] to put punishment upon you
[1:16:30] I won't ask you to raise your hands but
[1:16:33] this applies
[1:16:35] It Isn't So it's Satan doing it and
[1:16:40] God's permitting it
[1:16:42] for what reason to temper you
[1:16:45] why do you temper things to make it
[1:16:48] stronger
[1:16:49] right
[1:16:50] so a 10 percent makes it stronger
[1:16:54] to make you see
[1:16:56] not God to make us see if we are tied to
[1:17:00] this Earth by the Earth cares or whether
[1:17:03] your treasure is in heaven
[1:17:07] oh God help us
[1:17:09] I want you just to look at this I'm just
[1:17:11] going to kind of skip around here a
[1:17:13] little bit because it just
[1:17:17] job 9 9 17. I just want to break in on a
[1:17:20] couple of scriptures here because
[1:17:22] many of these parts will apply even into
[1:17:24] other times here
[1:17:26] notice Joseph in verse 17 for he
[1:17:29] speaking of God breakth me with
[1:17:32] and multi my wounds without calls
[1:17:36] he will not suffer me to take my breath
[1:17:39] but filleth me
[1:17:41] with bitterness
[1:17:43] once again
[1:17:44] job is not speaking of bitterness of
[1:17:48] Soul as far as I have become a bitter
[1:17:51] person
[1:17:51] remember what Jesus prayed he did not
[1:17:54] pray father let me not become bitter he
[1:17:58] said let this bitter cop
[1:18:01] s from me
[1:18:03] right I listen if he could pray that way
[1:18:05] how much more
[1:18:07] brother Graham tells us some souls in
[1:18:09] prison now he puts it in this way and it
[1:18:11] might kind of cause some people to
[1:18:12] struggle my brother Adam says Jesus
[1:18:14] prayed to dodge the cross
[1:18:17] why he even said now John 12 now is my
[1:18:21] soul troubled
[1:18:22] Hebrews 5 he he he he heard in that he
[1:18:27] feared he cried
[1:18:31] what was it it was God's subjecting God
[1:18:34] so subjected himself to become one of us
[1:18:38] that God experienced
[1:18:42] what it is to go through a trial
[1:18:45] what it is to be tempted what it is to
[1:18:48] be tested God so subjected himself he
[1:18:51] didn't have to do that
[1:18:52] but he did it but he might understand
[1:18:55] him and say I know how you feel
[1:18:59] and not just somebody patting this on
[1:19:01] the back but he ministers to us what we
[1:19:03] have need of you say brother Samuel I'm
[1:19:06] a sister how could he know there's only
[1:19:08] three gates that every Temptation can
[1:19:10] come through
[1:19:11] lest the flesh or pride of life and lust
[1:19:14] of the eyes all those right all those
[1:19:16] right there three gates and he
[1:19:18] experienced every Temptation and every
[1:19:21] trial such as common to man
[1:19:27] but he overcame
[1:19:31] there was listen to the scripture
[1:19:33] and yet he sinned not
[1:19:37] there was no unbelief that could that
[1:19:40] could come out because you want to know
[1:19:42] why there's no unbelief in the word
[1:19:47] and I might be jumping ahead of myself
[1:19:49] but inside a child a son and daughter of
[1:19:52] God when the Holy Spirit has come there
[1:19:56] is no unbelief in that seat
[1:19:59] that has been quickened
[1:20:02] are you with me
[1:20:04] it is that that brings discernment when
[1:20:07] Satan would want to come around our
[1:20:08] lives
[1:20:09] we're not perfect
[1:20:11] but our Perfection is in him
[1:20:14] notice this
[1:20:17] in job 10 verse 1. this one let's move
[1:20:21] ahead here
[1:20:22] my soul is weary of my life
[1:20:26] I will leave my complaint upon myself
[1:20:30] I will speak
[1:20:32] in the bitterness of my soul once again
[1:20:35] job is describing his appeal in this
[1:20:38] whole chapter watch how job will read
[1:20:40] this chapter job is appealing
[1:20:43] to The Compassion of the Lord
[1:20:46] um to even make an appeal to God's
[1:20:49] compassion this has to be somebody who
[1:20:51] knows his compassion
[1:20:53] are you with me let me just let's just
[1:20:55] read it here just just a little bit in
[1:20:58] verse 2 I will say unto God do not
[1:21:00] condemn me
[1:21:02] show me wherefore thou condemn us with
[1:21:04] me isn't it incredible job doesn't know
[1:21:06] job this is my approval
[1:21:10] but job looks at it I'm condemned
[1:21:16] wherefore thou contend us with me is it
[1:21:19] good unto thee that thou should have
[1:21:21] suppressed that thou shouldest despise
[1:21:23] the work of thine hands and shine upon
[1:21:25] the counsel of the wicked hast thou eyes
[1:21:28] of Flesh or seeth thou as a man sees are
[1:21:31] thy days as the days of man or thy years
[1:21:34] as man's days that thou inquirist after
[1:21:38] my iniquity and search it after my sin
[1:21:41] thou knowest that I am not Wicked and
[1:21:44] there is none that can deliver out of
[1:21:47] thine hand thine hands have made me and
[1:21:51] fashioned me together about yet thou
[1:21:55] destroy me
[1:21:58] oh my my
[1:22:02] now who's she all talking to
[1:22:05] he's speaking his heart
[1:22:08] is being poured out
[1:22:11] there is his complaint in other words
[1:22:13] his request to appeal to The Compassion
[1:22:15] of almighty God
[1:22:17] Lord You're the one who's brought me
[1:22:19] here now to destroy me
[1:22:20] Lord what's what's going on
[1:22:23] notice
[1:22:24] I remember I beseech thee that thou Hast
[1:22:28] made me as the clay and wilt thou bring
[1:22:30] me into dust again hast thou not poured
[1:22:32] me out as milk and curdled me like
[1:22:34] cheese thou has clothed me with skin and
[1:22:37] flesh and has fenced me with bones and
[1:22:39] sinews oh my that you see even in that
[1:22:42] scripture thou Hast clothed me with skin
[1:22:45] and flesh and has fenced me with bones
[1:22:47] and sinews job recognizes this flesh is
[1:22:51] not who I am
[1:22:54] but I am an attribute of your skunk
[1:22:59] I've been brought here
[1:23:01] and this right here is not who I really
[1:23:03] am this right here
[1:23:06] [Applause]
[1:23:07] tell me what's Speaking In This Moment
[1:23:11] and I'll tell you it's the same one that
[1:23:14] spoke out of Peter and said Thou Art the
[1:23:16] Christ the son of the Living God it's
[1:23:19] the same one in you the same wanted me
[1:23:21] that'll reach out and identify with the
[1:23:24] word regardless of circumstances
[1:23:28] Hallelujah I say How great is our God
[1:23:32] [Applause]
[1:23:35] thank you Jesus
[1:23:37] verse 12
[1:23:39] has granted me in life and favor what's
[1:23:42] he saying Lord You're the one who's
[1:23:44] given me life
[1:23:45] you're the one who's giving me favor
[1:23:48] it's not what I had job have done
[1:23:50] and by visitation
[1:23:52] hath preserved my spirit
[1:23:57] glory be to God
[1:23:59] and these things hast thou hid in thine
[1:24:02] heart I know that this is with thee
[1:24:05] these things that are taking place you
[1:24:07] have hid in your heart I know it's with
[1:24:09] you
[1:24:09] I know you have the understanding Lord
[1:24:12] that I like about this
[1:24:16] you see the difference
[1:24:18] with job
[1:24:19] ain't running away
[1:24:22] in other words
[1:24:23] it doesn't matter what comes
[1:24:25] he can't get job off his hands
[1:24:28] you know why because job is connected
[1:24:31] and United with him
[1:24:34] are you hearing me I hope this don't
[1:24:35] offend nobody but this right here job is
[1:24:37] not like brother Ram talks about and I
[1:24:39] believe it's a marriage of the Lamb an
[1:24:40] artificial lamb a limb where you have
[1:24:43] maybe he said like an arm you give you
[1:24:45] an arm or a leg or something that's
[1:24:46] artificial or teeth or something or hair
[1:24:49] you get in a bad situation that hair can
[1:24:52] come off them teeth can come out that
[1:24:54] leg can fall off that arm can come out
[1:24:55] we are not artificial Christians
[1:24:59] that are just pumped in place we are
[1:25:02] born of the spirit of God into the body
[1:25:05] of Jesus Christ
[1:25:08] glory be to God in the highest
[1:25:11] oh my verse 14.
[1:25:14] if I sin then thou markest me
[1:25:18] and that will not equip me from my
[1:25:19] iniquity
[1:25:21] Joe knows there's only one place of
[1:25:23] safety and that's under the blood
[1:25:25] only one place I can have fellowship and
[1:25:26] that's under the blood if I be Wicked
[1:25:28] woeing to me and if I be righteous
[1:25:31] yet I will not lift up my head
[1:25:38] of confusion
[1:25:43] here is a man
[1:25:45] in job 29 that would speak oh that I
[1:25:48] could go back to how it was years ago
[1:25:51] days ago when I would come into the
[1:25:54] market and they would ask to speak to me
[1:25:56] they would implore of the wisdom that
[1:25:58] has come to me but notice here is a man
[1:26:01] who has been used by God to help others
[1:26:04] but in his circumstance
[1:26:07] brother William he said I'm in confusion
[1:26:09] I don't know what's going on
[1:26:12] I don't understand
[1:26:17] but in that all
[1:26:19] Satan can't budge him
[1:26:24] remember
[1:26:25] walking I
[1:26:28] of a man
[1:26:31] does not understand what's going on but
[1:26:34] this man his soul is united with God
[1:26:39] and that's what's most important because
[1:26:42] our flesh will never stand I spirit will
[1:26:45] never stand our mind will never stand
[1:26:48] but once that Soul has been sealed by
[1:26:51] almighty God nothing I said nothing can
[1:26:55] separate us from the love
[1:26:59] of Jesus Christ that we have in almighty
[1:27:02] God
[1:27:02] [Music]
[1:27:10] confusion I don't know
[1:27:13] but you see even in his confusion that
[1:27:16] had nothing to do with his soul
[1:27:20] do you remember the scripture we read
[1:27:22] that the trial of your
[1:27:25] faith not your flesh not in my spirit
[1:27:29] not my mind the trial of your faith
[1:27:36] well Lord I don't feel very very
[1:27:38] victorious in this our flesh will never
[1:27:41] feel victorious in a trial our spirit
[1:27:44] will never feel victorious in a trial
[1:27:47] our mind will never feel victorious in a
[1:27:50] trial but our soul it rejoice in the
[1:27:54] victory that is wrought in Jesus Christ
[1:27:57] [Applause]
[1:28:00] so don't let the devil are you with me
[1:28:02] now don't let the devil beat you up with
[1:28:04] well I'll tell you you ought to be you
[1:28:06] know to stepping in and praise breaking
[1:28:08] and everything else if you really had it
[1:28:10] going through a test or trial My Flesh
[1:28:12] don't feel that way but my soul on the
[1:28:16] inside my soul is doing a two-step my
[1:28:20] soul because you know what I don't know
[1:28:22] what all is going to go around but I
[1:28:24] know one thing I'm no one whom I have
[1:28:26] believed and I'm persuaded that he is
[1:28:29] able to keep me
[1:28:34] so just because I'm not doing a two-step
[1:28:36] here don't mean they're in a two-step
[1:28:38] and a praise break going on on the
[1:28:39] inside
[1:28:40] [Applause]
[1:28:45] [Music]
[1:28:47] I am full of confusion
[1:28:52] one thing I look at all this right here
[1:28:53] is God just continues to pour out and
[1:28:55] open things even as I'm standing here
[1:28:56] reading is one thing I can appreciate
[1:28:58] and it shows that job's a real man of
[1:29:00] God he's honest
[1:29:03] he's honest he ain't trying to cover it
[1:29:05] up or he's just he's just on I'm full of
[1:29:07] confusion
[1:29:11] therefore I tell you what I wonder if we
[1:29:12] get to the other side if we're going to
[1:29:14] be able to go up to job and say job I
[1:29:16] know
[1:29:17] that that was something that you would
[1:29:18] have never wanted to have wrote
[1:29:20] but I want to thank you for obeying the
[1:29:22] inspiration of the Almighty and writing
[1:29:25] that down even the things that it showed
[1:29:28] your Humanity
[1:29:31] because I receive strength and comfort
[1:29:33] in my life
[1:29:36] to understand me better
[1:29:40] glory be to God therefore see thou mind
[1:29:43] Affliction let me just try to bring this
[1:29:45] get down to us Point here and I'll just
[1:29:47] I'll just close it off because there's
[1:29:48] just no way
[1:29:51] for it increases
[1:29:53] thou honest me this is what he's
[1:29:56] speaking of the Lord thou honest me as a
[1:29:59] fierce lion
[1:30:00] and again thou show us thyself marvelous
[1:30:03] upon me
[1:30:05] thou renew us thy Witnesses against me
[1:30:08] and increaseth thine England Nation upon
[1:30:10] me changes and War are against me

[1:30:54] a trial
[1:30:57] changes are all around me not the Lord
[1:31:00] knows not one of us likes change
[1:31:02] some of us like change a whole lot less
[1:31:04] than others right

[1:31:08] thing in the day Lord help us we're
[1:31:09] going to have to have a breakthrough and
[1:31:10] pray through to get through the rest of
[1:31:12] the day

[1:31:31] but I understand that and if things

[1:33:15] oh forgive me let me get back into the
[1:33:16] scripture here

[1:33:21] you and I that you and I can see or if
[1:33:23] we could just God help us to take
[1:33:24] encouragement tonight it shows this part
[1:33:27] is around us but God gives us Grace
[1:33:30] to Reign Over It
[1:33:32] you know what the prophet said
[1:33:33] concerning this thing he said as long as
[1:33:36] you live once you've been born again he
[1:33:38] said you will have a carnal sticky
[1:33:41] nature about you that will bother you
[1:33:46] well who's bobber and who the Cardinal
[1:33:49] sticky nature is bothering the son or
[1:33:52] the daughter of God
[1:33:55] I don't know about you but there have
[1:33:56] been things right out through there and
[1:33:58] so forth even last week when the Lord
[1:34:00] blessed me with that deer there at the
[1:34:01] beginning of the week and I'm right in
[1:34:03] the midst where that thing fell and
[1:34:05] there's all kinds of them torn bushes
[1:34:06] and things all around there I went
[1:34:08] through there and them things sometimes
[1:34:10] they can cut right through hunting pants
[1:34:12] and that stuff's strong
[1:34:14] I had a gasket come up right here from
[1:34:17] that my wife looked at me she said what
[1:34:18] was that was that from the night I said
[1:34:20] no that probably was from one of them
[1:34:21] Thorns but you know how things are so
[1:34:23] easy to get stuck
[1:34:25] come on friends we can get stuck in a
[1:34:29] train of thought we can get stuck in
[1:34:32] certain things
[1:34:33] like a burr on the lake come on now we
[1:34:36] can get stuck but thanks be to God
[1:34:38] there's one to free us
[1:34:42] feed a god
[1:34:43] and one of these days when this life has
[1:34:46] been fully developed
[1:34:50] bye bye bye bye carnal sticky nature
[1:34:56] glory be to God
[1:34:58] oh my
[1:35:01] God oh glory be to God
[1:35:03] Hallelujah
[1:35:07] are not my days let me just these next
[1:35:09] couple scriptures and we'll close are
[1:35:11] not my days for you
[1:35:13] cease then and let me alone that I may
[1:35:16] take comfort a little remember job
[1:35:17] brother Brandon lets us know job is an
[1:35:19] older man right now
[1:35:21] my days are with you
[1:35:23] I've only got a few days left Lord
[1:35:25] let me have comfort
[1:35:28] let me have comfort
[1:35:29] before I go whence I shall not return
[1:35:32] even to the land of darkness and the
[1:35:34] shadow of death a land of Darkness as
[1:35:36] Darkness itself and of the shadow of
[1:35:37] death without any order where the light
[1:35:40] is
[1:35:42] as Darkness
[1:35:45] remember the problem just ends it like
[1:35:47] let's just stop here
[1:35:49] but you know brother bran preaches a
[1:35:51] message in the Hebrew series reaches
[1:35:53] more part one and apart two parts in one
[1:35:56] service or one day preaches Hebrews
[1:35:58] chapter 3
[1:35:59] and then that night he preaches Hebrews
[1:36:01] chapter 4. brother Branham in the
[1:36:04] beginning of Hebrews chapter 3 he's
[1:36:05] dealing with how that God brought Israel
[1:36:08] out in the wilderness
[1:36:09] and they come straight to the Red Sea
[1:36:13] that God opens up a way
[1:36:17] and he said how God made a way through
[1:36:19] that he said and he said no doubt he
[1:36:21] said the people thought praise God
[1:36:24] we've just come through one big trial
[1:36:27] we're on our way it'll just be
[1:36:30] we'll just breeze on through to the
[1:36:32] promised land
[1:36:35] I wonder
[1:36:38] you know God doesn't come alone and tell
[1:36:41] us oh Joshua you sure you want to serve
[1:36:43] me it's going to be hard boy
[1:36:46] I'm going to make it tough on you I'm
[1:36:48] going no it isn't that at all
[1:36:51] it's him
[1:36:53] he comes it's him
[1:36:56] we do not fall in love with
[1:36:58] circumstances around us it's him
[1:37:03] it's him
[1:37:04] and that's what's important that we fall
[1:37:07] in love with him that we meet him
[1:37:10] because he's the one that opens up the
[1:37:15] Red Sea
[1:37:16] he's the one that sweetens bitter Waters
[1:37:21] he's the one that brings water out of
[1:37:24] the rock he's the one that nourishes us
[1:37:28] when we need nourishment
[1:37:31] it's him and in him it's all things that
[1:37:36] we have need of
[1:37:38] blessed be the Lord
[1:37:40] Hallelujah
[1:37:42] so we realize it's not just
[1:37:44] easy sailing
[1:37:48] but neither do we neither do we look at
[1:37:50] and say oh
[1:37:51] oh I don't know no
[1:37:54] In This Moment
[1:37:56] I worship Him for who he is
[1:38:01] if I or you were to look at tomorrow
[1:38:05] or even the things today maybe things
[1:38:08] are afflicted with things you're going
[1:38:09] through test your trial situations and
[1:38:11] family or not if you were to look at
[1:38:13] that how could you rejoice
[1:38:15] you couldn't
[1:38:17] but you can rejoice in him
[1:38:21] you understand you can invite his
[1:38:23] presence down to say Lord I know that
[1:38:26] you're still with me
[1:38:28] though the circumstances around me
[1:38:30] though I maybe haven't heard your voice
[1:38:34] Lord I know you're with me
[1:38:37] I know if it was not for your visitation
[1:38:40] my spirit would not have been preserved
[1:38:42] I know that I couldn't stand here
[1:38:44] tonight if it wasn't for your visitation
[1:38:47] in my life so I may not know what's
[1:38:49] going on around me
[1:38:51] but I know Lord that you're in control
[1:38:55] [Applause]
[1:38:57] this might just be jumping ahead just a
[1:38:59] little bit into the point
[1:39:02] but the Bible says in the opening
[1:39:04] brother Greg when those trials struck
[1:39:06] struck job
[1:39:09] he sin not
[1:39:11] nor charged God
[1:39:14] foolish
[1:39:16] and let me go on and say this right here
[1:39:18] because they just kind of just give a
[1:39:20] little prelude for some other things in
[1:39:22] the midst of all that brother William
[1:39:23] all this that we read he still
[1:39:26] is not sinning against God
[1:39:38] but there is no unbelief in the
[1:39:41] sacrifice
[1:39:43] Glory
[1:39:46] [Applause]
[1:39:50] though in my flesh it might grow weak
[1:39:53] though my spirit might grow weary but in
[1:39:56] my soul there is no unbelief
[1:40:00] no I don't understand what's taking
[1:40:03] place but yet what God says is true and
[1:40:07] every words Every Man's word is a lie
[1:40:10] including my own thoughts
[1:40:13] [Applause]
[1:40:15] glory be to God
[1:40:21] Lord Jesus
[1:40:25] thank you Lord for your word
[1:40:27] of encouragement Lord your presence
[1:40:32] Lord Jesus

[1:40:39] even Lord as we come here and we've
[1:40:42] gathered the Lord together through the
[1:40:44] songs and
[1:40:45] then through the ministering of the word
[1:40:48] Lord Jesus

[1:40:53] thank you for speaking Lord so
[1:40:55] personally to our lives Lord God I I

[1:41:10] notes and looking at things and but Lord

[1:41:25] certain of that to every heart Lord that
[1:41:28] God you have so Lord minister to our
[1:41:30] hearts and our lives Lord how faithful
[1:41:33] we are Lord God for truly Lord there is
[1:41:37] no flesh that can glory in your presence
[1:41:40] Lord God oh Father in our flesh we're
[1:41:43] not making excuses but our flesh is weak
[1:41:46] Lord God but father it's in that of our
[1:41:49] soul lord we're the strength of the Lord
[1:41:52] is and that's why like David we can say
[1:41:55] the Lord is the strength of my life
[1:41:59] Lord Jesus no doubt Lord maybe one he or
[1:42:03] some here we've all come into these
[1:42:05] places Lord sometimes when the Lord God
[1:42:08] as we can take it back in the scripture
[1:42:09] Lord think it not strange when the fiery
[1:42:12] trial was to come
[1:42:14] Lord God our Humanity
[1:42:16] our Humanity
[1:42:18] still we'll go back to what's going on I
[1:42:21] don't understand that oh God but I'm so
[1:42:24] glad that you became one of us
[1:42:28] you made a way Lord and been through
[1:42:30] that way that Lord we might become Lord
[1:42:33] to you and you are a faithful and
[1:42:36] merciful high priest one who can be
[1:42:39] touched by the feeling of our
[1:42:41] infirmities for you yourself were
[1:42:44] encompassed around about with infirmity
[1:42:47] you know what it is Lord God to feel
[1:42:50] Lord and these things would come Lord
[1:42:52] our way but oh how you are so faithful
[1:42:55] Lord to intercede Lord on our behalf
[1:42:58] Lord I pray tonight God may it be Lord
[1:43:01] from every heart Lord that would go up
[1:43:03] may every lie Lord that the enemies
[1:43:06] wanted to try to whisper every thought
[1:43:08] Lord that he's tried to put Lord in the
[1:43:10] minds of Lord of my brothers or my
[1:43:13] sister or my mind Lord oh God may we
[1:43:15] cast down every imagination Lord and
[1:43:18] bringing Lord every thought Lord Into
[1:43:21] The Obedience of Jesus Christ for the
[1:43:23] Lord You're not against us Lord You Are
[1:43:26] For Us Lord Jesus

[1:43:58] that in the midst of the situation Lord
[1:44:01] let us be sensitive and looking to you

[1:55:47] as a perfect peace
[1:55:53] well I'm just so grateful how God comes
[1:55:57] by our way
[1:55:59] you know
[1:56:01] God just has a way of coming
[1:56:04] and just dispelling the thoughts of the
[1:56:07] enemy
[1:56:09] you know I'm glad I'm glad because I'm
[1:56:12] glad there's reinforcements I'm glad
[1:56:15] I'm glad there's reinforcements that
[1:56:17] come
[1:56:18] sometimes that where I feel like I'm in
[1:56:20] a battle maybe there's all kinds of
[1:56:23] thoughts and things going through my
[1:56:24] mind I'm glad there's a reinforcement
[1:56:25] that can come I'm glad that I can come
[1:56:28] together
[1:56:29] with brothers and sisters of like
[1:56:31] Precious faith
[1:56:32] and that there's hearts and lives around
[1:56:35] me even as we begin to pull on the word
[1:56:37] of God the presence of God and how that
[1:56:40] he comes his thoughts
[1:56:43] his thoughts have life
[1:56:46] he said I know the thoughts that I think
[1:56:49] towards you
[1:56:50] David said when I begin to entertain
[1:56:52] your thoughts they're too wonderful for
[1:56:54] me they they go beyond me Lord to
[1:56:57] consider that thou knowest my uprisings
[1:57:01] and my down City now no it's my coming
[1:57:04] in am I going out it's too wonderful for
[1:57:06] me I I it goes beyond what my mind can
[1:57:09] comprehend
[1:57:12] but I'm glad
[1:57:13] you see what's important if anything
[1:57:16] is let our minds be filled with him
[1:57:20] Lord I want to fill my mind with you
[1:57:23] that's why Good gospel singing That's
[1:57:25] why Heaven's having an arm
[1:57:27] that's why that's that's why that's why
[1:57:29] even playing the message
[1:57:33] that's why even the singing
[1:57:36] but Samuel sometimes I get the feeling
[1:57:38] down or worry just it maybe don't even
[1:57:40] have to be words just put it on in the
[1:57:42] background
[1:57:44] matter of fact brother Brown told
[1:57:45] Brother Billy Paul put it on in the work
[1:57:48] trailer put it on in the background
[1:57:50] because you want to know why brother
[1:57:52] Billy battled that gloominess
[1:57:58] glory god
[1:58:00] listen God knows how
[1:58:03] to equip you and I to battle it
[1:58:07] it's just as easy God could say I'm
[1:58:09] going to take the gloominess from around
[1:58:10] you brother Brown says when that old
[1:58:12] gloomy Spirit starts to come around you
[1:58:14] he said you take out your sword and you
[1:58:17] start whacking at it
[1:58:19] whack quack quack quack
[1:58:24] until eventually says there's a hole in
[1:58:26] it
[1:58:30] now he could have just easily have said
[1:58:32] well there won't be a gloomy Spirit come
[1:58:34] around but we're still
[1:58:36] in this
[1:58:38] mortal body
[1:58:40] Temptations and tests and trials will
[1:58:43] come
[1:58:44] and this is The Proving Grounds right
[1:58:51] but when it's all said and done
[1:58:53] there's a job 42 for our life too
