midst also I'm glad he comes aren't you he's the one that makes the difference he's the one that makes a service a service doesn't matter how small or how big the crowd is it's him that makes the difference that he comes amen we just are so thankful for that we just want to just take our Quest well you've taken a prayer request before the Lord we just want to continue to offer and every request and to the Lord I know I've brought this to you before but with brother Donny's daughter sister Erica it's always just continue to keep that in mind in prayer and I know that the Lord has just been moving there for her and sometimes it's been little by little just by Littles to be able to do little things even around the house and then to be in the end to be in the house of God but you know we'll we'll take every little step and uh you know last weekend we had an opportunity we were there in the meetings and you some of you no doubt you maybe got a chance to watch it or to see it here you have brother Ron Spencer standing there on Friday night stage four cancer but it's preaching like a real champion I don't mean that that's not to uplift brother Ron to me that's that's a product of what this message does in our lives it's what God does in our lives to be able to stand there in the face to realize because the cancer that brother Ron has he was only given four months to live melanoma once it gets inside you it's four months and that was for months back in December of 2019. and in that particular moment I don't know if you're aware of this but when he got the news that he had that cancer in four months to live he was preaching at brother biscals he walked out and he preached the message called courage after getting that news if you haven't heard it and you know it's online it's a powerful service and I I just say it in this way that you know we want to continue to hold them up in prayer through it all God is receiving a testimony I'll tell you I witnessed there like I said on Friday night God took a God took a man about this about this tall right here and using for the glory of God and I just to me I just think glory be to God it's all you can do to contain yourself because you see God working but you know what the same God that works and Ron Spencer is the same God that works in you and me the same God no matter what our tests or our trials is I say Lord what resiliency you bring there you also bring in our hearts and our lives I believe that he's the same God he brother Braham says it like this I know this quote very well brother Brown says that God gives ice cream to one of his children he's got to give it to all so God doesn't God's not a god of favoritism what he does for one he'll do for all amen so I've Got Confidence in that and so we just want to continue as I was just trying to bring some to you remember to continue to prayers pray for sister Erica Parker brother Ron Spencer also as we go to prayer this coming Sunday we're going to have a back to school a special prayer for the students teachers parents that are heading back I don't know who needs it more maybe the parents I don't know but we all need prayer so let's just go to the Lord in prayer now you have a special request I know we've made it known to the Lord let's just let's just go together in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord you are faithful Lord in all things oh God Lord how thankful we are God for your mercy once again Lord Lord as we've seen Lord not only in your word but we are living Witnesses of it that great is thy faith from the soul God that thy mercies are new Every Morning Lord oh God you are our strength Giver Lord you're everything to us Lord Jesus Lord when everything else Fades away I'm so thankful God that Lord You're the unchangeable god Lord you you give Lord a real lasting experience Lord oh God you lead us to the place Lord that Lord Our Lives might be founded upon the solid rock Lord Lord without that mercy and that Grace to lead us there Lord we would be upon Lord shifting Sands Lord but you and your mercy o God Lord and staying Lord faithful to your word you provided Lord in this hour the light the evening light that path of Glory might be revealed to us Lord that your glory might reveal in us and through US Lord Lord we worship and glorify you almighty God Lord for every single request that we have before us we know that Lord You're greater than every circumstance you're greater than cancer Lord we've witnessed it Lord God not just what we've seen Lord and heard but God we've witnessed it Lord right here Lord in our midst Lord so we know that Lord there is nothing that's impossible Lord with you it's not nothing no situation Lord God we just continue to lift up Lord brother Ron Spencer and sister Erica Parker in prayer oh God that you just continue to move for them Lord in a very special way father and Lord for every request that's gathered here tonight upon the hearts of your children Lord you're just as Mindful and interested in every single request Lord no matter Lord what we might Lord in our mind think that our request is Lord Lord insignificant compared to others but God you are Mindful and you care Lord about every need Lord Upon Our Hearts and our lives oh God we ask tonight Lord that you would just Lord come by our way Lord minister to every need Lord that's gathered here Lord give Assurance Lord and hearts Lord give answers to questions Lord dissolve doubts the Lord I pray may you come Lord oh God it's you that Lord that we desire to hear from and to see Lord in our midst tonight Lord may you come personally Lord to every life and every heart tonight Lord minister to every single need Lord we ask it Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen man God bless you tonight as you're turning to the scriptures in job 23 I want to share with you brother Nathanael science just text me here today and they're having special meetings this weekend with brother Daniel Andy's Saturday with a he stated with the barbecue lunch between services and all of the Saints are welcome it's Saturday it's 10 a.m as the service and then they have lunch and then it'll be a 4 P.M service so if you're able to go and and to be a part of that I think it would be a great blessing and Saturday at 10 A.M and then at 4 P.M and there's a lunch in between and they've been so so gracious and so good they've we I thank God for the relationship and for the working amen that God has brought together and with the sister churches and just to be able to work together and they have certainly been very supportive of the meetings and services here and so we you know if you can find it in your schedule to go maybe just even one of the services I know would be a great blessing and encouragement as well and um let's look here in job 23 and verse 8. and I I want to just continue to read and I know we've been reading this for for a few few weeks or a few Services now but we want to continue to draw the context from this here behold I go forward but he is not there and backward but I cannot perceive him and on the left hand where he does work but I cannot Behold Him he hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him but he knoweth the way that I take and when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold what a confession my foot hath held his steps his way have I kept and not declined neither have I gone back from the Commandment of his lips and I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food I'd like to continue tonight to speak on that thought of faithful may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I I come back and I was looking over one of the points and I don't have this quote up there with me but just very inspired to me even today as I was just looking over this and coming back to me but brother Branham takes us into that three kinds of Believers and he speaks of how that when job all of the friends had come around and they were pointing out clearly something is wrong with your walk with God because none of this would be happening if everything was okay between you and God and brother Branham in the midst of one of one quote and you know how it's things you just look at for some time and brother Brandon makes a statement within there he says but job was able they could not move him from his sacrifice and he said he knew it was the devil and it was no use of tempting him now see job was able to discern that clearly that what they were trying to do and it wasn't them that's all they understood but it was the enemy trying to work through them to get job to denounce his message it was to try to get him to turn from his message to deny it but see there was something that job didn't give himself job didn't learn this on his own it was divine revelation and that's why brother Brandon would tell us and I have heard but now I see and he would say it throughout the message Revelation is more important than what you realize because there's many times you know I've sat and I've talked with individuals went through scriptures and they can see certain things that is undeniable of what you're showing them in the scripture and then yet to turn and see them walk whiter right away from the truth and walk right back into accepting things that they set and when we went through in a Bible study they knew this was right and when you look at that you realize one thing was for sure it never was a revelation because what's more important than knowing the written word is to have the Revelation which is God's thought that what God thought when he inspired the writers to write that is the spirit of Truth revealing himself and that's why that's what God's original program and it's always been God's program God's program has never been man teaching man it's God himself unfolding himself to his people so even as God has teachers but it's not the teacher doing the teaching it's the spirit of God who's doing the teaching because he promised when he has come after the sacrifice is offered when he has come he will lead and guide you into all things he will teach you he will show you things to come that's the work and the office of the holy spirit so job is standing on the ground that God has revealed to him and he's and showing that in this scriptures that we read that job has not only heard his voice the Commandment of his lips but job has caught a sight of his character of his nature he knows him not just by a letter but I know his ways I know his steps remember the promise of John 5 19 which is reflected in the True Believer the son can do nothing in himself but what he seeth the father doing that doeth the son likewise it was showing that there was now an opening back fully into the channel to see the Living God and a direct communication that's coming back not just something that would come and go but a direct communication between God and his people and God's the one who has restored that through him by Calvary and then the outpouring of the Holy Ghost God has restored that relationship or that true Oneness that God has desired and then when we look upon this to see this within job's life I've been referring us back into a quote here out of the same message three kinds of Believers your brother Branham says Believers are put to the test and not sometimes but every time for every son that cometh to God must be chastened tried and child trained and remember the trials the dusty roads the hot son of persecution but the Loyalty of your heart beats that material till she is ready to go into the mold now you know our feelings can tell us a lot of things many times but I want to say to you your feelings anytime our feelings go against the word of God they're lying anytime reasoning goes against the word of God it's lying so it's not the loyalty to our feelings many times uh uh you know in humanity we can be loyal to our feelings loyal to a lot of things but remember loyalty itself is only recognized by God when it's a loyalty to his word that's what God recognizes God appreciates listen God the loyalty to the word of God by the spirit of God will bring loyalty in marriage it'll bring loyalty and home it'll produce loyalty in the lives of his people but first get that loyalty of Christ in you the hope of glory and then all these other things will be added unto you right because we come into such uh moments even of responsibility so there are the Loyalty of our heart is what beats that material till she's ready to go into the mold so in the midst of the test and of the trial standing faithful and looking to God when we do not know what the outcome is or what the next step is but in that moment dying to our feelings let me just say this brother Bo has preached a phenomenal message on Sunday I went back and I just combed through that message and I told him the other uh the texting the other day to me it was profound how that he went through that with the Temptations of Christ and broke into those things on Hunger feelings worship submission and then dealing with Satan's objective to bring confusion to get people off the word and to me I I just I was blessed as I was sitting and just listening and going through that because when you we see this that this is Satan's objective is always to come and test us on our feelings anytime we make decisions we can all Fellowship on this but I don't want to dwell in anything negative anytime we've ever made a decision on feelings those are the times we usually have to come back and say forgive me Lord right even forgive me to one another here because feelings itself is never to be what we're led by but it's the Loyalty of our heart that is we're standing in the midst and standing true and I pray that God will help me to get to some more examples tonight it's what takes the material and that material we're talking about is our character and there's no other way for character to be molded in our life outside of God's life being in us and tester trials coming our way that actually brings out that character it's God's way of bringing and unfolding of the character molding it and bringing out of our Lives what needs to be so Abram goes on to say God's children is made up correctly on his word for they are living examples and I want to just mark this right here for they are living examples and the word of God living through them the trial comes to shake you to put you to the very bottom to see where you'll stand and they tested they tried every son that cometh to God let me just say this God is not surprised by your stand he's not surprised God was not surprised at the stand of job he already knew and God himself he's not surprised when there has been lives tested and they go astray God's not been surprised by that God's not said oh my goodness I thought there was really something holding on there I wonder what goes on no that's you and me sometimes we can look sometimes and we see situations and see settings and you look and you think my goodness if I thought anybody had had this or had that and you look at it because you know why all we can see is what's on the outside I do believe whatever's on the inside will come to the outside but whatever's on the inside even when the outside's getting attacked there is a strength and an anchor that holds within the Veil just like the prophet when he came to the situation in his own life he was tested in faithfulness is that right and remember he listened to his mother-in-law that did not change God's mind about him brother Branham told us to use my mistakes as stepping stones of God's grace for you for me he he yielded to that voice of what she said or was it feelings and here then his wife is taken here his daughter is taken I tell you what friends there's been many people that have lost their faith under much less conditions showing the strength of that faith in our life by the New Birth when Satan came up next to him and stood right there while he was looking at his daughter and he prayed and asked God and a black sheep was pulled right down in front of him as if God was saying shut up I don't even want to hear your prayer is that what the prophet said he said his God was loving I don't even want to hear it but he said even while everything that Satan was saying he said I was about ready to say if that's the way he's going to be are you hearing me Satan came up and the prophet said every bit of reasoning agreed with him but up from the midst in his life said yay though he slaved me yet I will serve him it shows you and I we're not serving God by the intellect of our mind we're not serving God by our feelings because that will waver and up and down and up and down but there's got to be an eye on the inside that's greater than you or me I'm talking about the I am I will serve thee it's got to be Christ inside of you times friends when you talk with individuals and lives and I get you know calls and get things individuals well I really want to serve God and I really want to do this and you come back and say but you've got to get to the bottom of it it's more than a feeling I believe in Emotion but you've got to have a real dying to yourself not God come on top of your life he won't do that you've gotta you've gotta hate your own life you've got to see your own life you are sinful you need almighty God you don't need a church you don't need a church book you need almighty God you need the blood to be applied to your life he shed his blood not that it would just go to the Earth but that the Holy Ghost might come to your life and convince your heart that you're a sinner in need of a mighty God in need of atonement I think how Satan wants to confuse that and the real reason it comes down to it is lives and people want to hang on to their own life and if you hang on to it the scripture says you'll lose it but if you're willing to forsake it you'll receive life we're given that choice in this hour and the prophet said oh to think if that new birth hadn't been there let me tell you friends what is keeping when you see lives and you see hearts all the way through even through our little group and body of Believers when you see faithful lives and you see hearts that are pillars because God we've got some pillars here are you hearing me now I want to just just remind you that it is not because somebody has some kind of good DNA what I'm trying to say is is that it's got to be the love of God on the inside it takes God beating in the heart of the individual that's the Loyalty that God is craving that's what God is Desiring is there is a loyalty from our heart and that's what molds real character now think of this in this manner Proverbs chapter 20 verse 6. let me refer back to a scripture here before that in Galatians 2 20. Paul said I am crucified with Christ so he made a way that you and I could die to ourselves Calvary was not just about him Calvary was about you and me I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I lived yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me so Paul how are you living I'm living by the faith of the son of God who gave himself who loved me and gave himself for me Paul is living by direct revelation of Jesus Christ Paul do you get down yeah do you have fears come around you know we can go to many places on scripture fears come around but Paul how are you living how is it that you're persevering how is it that you know persecution is coming your way how is it that you're aware that that your life being hunted down how is it that you're able to keep going because I'm not living for myself any longer I'm living by the faith of the Son of God Who Loved Me and gave himself from me so I trust we see that parallel of how God himself reveals himself faithful and as God reveals himself faithful and makes himself known it has an effect upon his children Proverbs 20 verse 6 let me go through some scriptures here most men will Proclaim everyone his own goodness but a faithful man who can find so maybe we put this in the vernacular of our common terms every man can toot his own horn strut his own stuff put his own decalogue on Facebook or whatever of who he is but who can find a faithful man see this is a request this was this is a request who is a faithful man a faithful man is not a man that's about himself this is where God is laying this down who can but a faithful man who can find faithful to what faithful to the word of God Psalms 12 verse 1 this this same thought moves throughout the scripture here and I've read this scripture to you before as far as the whole passage but here David help Lord For The Godly Man ceaseth for the faithful fail from Among The Children of Men if in notice David's seeing Godly men are failing the faithful are failing from among the children of men well who's going to do something about it help God it's going to take God if there's any faithfulness restored it's got to come by a faithful God moving on the scene in that same scripture those passages in that chapter where David goes on to seeing how that where there were men that were just you know saying any old thing and living on any old kind of life but notice as he went on and I don't have it up there but God withheld his words from that generation you see God won't reveal himself if we fail to be faithful in what he's already shown the Bible said the first principle and who whosoever cometh to God must first believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek after him oh my I tell you friends we're not seeking after a feeling we're seeking after him don't worry when you get him he'll bring feelings he'll bring emotion but it's getting him first it's seeking after him not to where have I got enough completed God's not a checklist he is a person that desires a relationship with you any man can give you a checklist Peter on the day of Pentecost never gave him a checklist they wanted to know what do we have to do to be saved why the person have been revealed he had brought conviction upon their lives and the same God who brings conviction reveals he is our way Ecclesiastes 7 verse 27 behold this have I found saith the preacher counting one by one to find out the account which yet my soul seeketh but I find not one man among a thousand have I found but a woman among all those have I not found sometimes the way the scripture is worded it's saying I have not found a man and I have not found a woman among a thousand you're taking a breath of people to find a man and a woman are you understanding me now you see God still regards a man a man and a woman a woman the Bible said he made them male and female God Don't Make sissies God don't do that that's Satan are you with me Satan gets in there through perversion with it with the desire to lead people to destruction but notice God makes a man and a woman let me just say this to you know when you look at it thank God there should be a real desire in our hearts even as parents whether we have boys or we have girls and even when we have here in this assembly we want to see real men and we want to see real women we want to raise them in the admonition of the lord we want the real principles because that's a responsibility that we're taught not just scriptural principles but the scriptural principles have to do with every facet of our life but to also know that in order to be the man that God intended you to be and the woman God intended you to be you must be born again by the same Holy Ghost and God himself is the one who makes a real man and a real woman he did it in the beginning in the garden and he's the same God today verse 29 Lord this is what I was saying Lo this only have I found that God hath made man upright but they sought out many inventions God made man in the beginning upright and let me tell you God never changed his desire God never changed his intention or his purpose God still with every life and through and by the shedding of the blood God has made a way that man or woman can come right back into the land of uprightness which is the very righteousness of God I tell you what God makes the Bible goes on to say in the same book no man can add to it or take away from it when God does a work in a person's life I'm telling you the devil can't touch it is that right Brethren when the seal has been laid down listen the Holy Ghost isn't something you gain and lose and gain and lose that might be on your spirit but when that show has been born again by the spirit of the Living God there ain't enough Devils out of hell that can ever talk you out of it or take you away why because God is faithful do I say tonight if you've lived an up and down life you're missing what God has for you nobody can ever lay that on God notice another scripture Jeremiah 5 verse 1. remember this is in the time of where Israel is getting ready to go into captivity because Israel had abandoned the things of God is that right I want you to watch here in Jeremiah 5 verse 1. same principle run you to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem and see now and know and seek in the broad places thereof if you can find a man if there be any that executed judgment that seeketh the truth and I will pardon it you know what God is saying I'll pardon this whole city if I can find one one one the executed judgment discernment one that seeketh truth I'll pardon it but he said though they say the Lord liveth surely they swear falsely so then God has let you know friends when I look at the scripture God remember we see it in Esther an intercessory life we're seeing an Abraham Abraham was an intercessor when the word was revealed to him is that right Abraham didn't code over where lot was he stood right there and said God he's down there but would you spare it for one you know of the down from 30 to 10 and on and on but to understand that there God himself I tell you I look at this principle right here if there's one in your home it allows God to visit if there's one you be that one say God I want to live if my children aren't living for you if my loved ones aren't living for you but let me stand true Lord don't let me cut Corners don't let me make excuses but let me stay true to your word Lord God because they need lies and I know you to be the life Giver who can find a faithful man Hallelujah all friends you know what I'm talking about you know many times we hear that I don't know if it's a phrase among everybody but I found it to be true whether it's a southern phrase or whatever when it says blood is thicker than water I have found that to be the truth that blood will turn right around on you family will turn around and they'll walk right over the word of God to cover up for their family I'm just going to preach truth now but you know what that doesn't do one thing it's not just that you're walking in Disobedience but it don't do one thing for that person that you really want to see health because it is not your flesh that can help anybody I tell you what happens when you go along with sin you're only cuddling and coddling and nursing spirits and them Spirits themselves it only gives it a betting ground to stay there longer but if you'll stand for the word of God and the truth and say whosoever on the Lord's Side let him come over here then God can go to work on their heart I can't go to work on your son and daughter's heart or anybody's heart if you're not staying true to the word of God who that's free Micah 7 2. the good man is perished out of the earth now you know it would be one thing to be for for this to be written about Babylon for it to be written about other nations this these scriptures that I'm reading from Ecclesiastes being Solomon from these other scriptures Jeremiah and now Micah this is referring to Israel yeah at one time if you recall in the scriptures God even says in the book of Isaiah what is happened to the faithful City that now has become a harlot how did it get to be this way now you understand they didn't have the presence of God how did Church systems today get to the place that they are it didn't start overnight it started by one slight deviation from the word of God to fail to accept him to be the same yesterday today and forever to where we read here in the Book of Revelations for this age we're setting in they put him out of the church they don't want a genuine experience they don't want him dealing with their life they don't want him correcting him they look at it and say you're touching menial things that do not matter I want the grace of God will a news flash the grace of God comes to bring transformation in our lives not what we deserve not what we've merited but what God in His Grace has provided because he sees what we have need of right and Micah's standing here and says the good man is perished out of the earth and there is none upright among men they all lie in wait for blood they hunt every man his brother with a net what a testimony this is about Jerusalem but I'll tell you God's made a promise he said when I gather you back you will be seen the Lord is our righteousness the Lord is our rest the Lord is our and God himself not only is he bringing him into the land but God's going to bring him into the real Promised Land of the Holy Ghost oh my now notice why all of this think of it but as we have referred to in the Book of Job I'm just going to skip over the scriptures but because you're familiar with them but how that it was even noted of how that job himself was a perfect and upright man then you find God testifying of this later in chapter one then after Things Fall Apart and yes you know his children are taken uh you know different sheep can't all that and then yet within it here God brags on him again when Satan comes up and says have you considered my servant job who is a perfect and upright man one that feareth God and askeweth Evil and God goes on to say even through the midst of all you're putting on him he still is holding fast his integrity I tell you there's something deeper inside of job than job there's something deeper in you than just you something deeper in me than just me I tell you friends that's the reality of the anchor let me tell you something The Testament trial not only is it coming to mold and shape our character but you know what it comes to bring you an out to a place to the bottom like the prophet said that you and I can only look and recognize it's got to be God right here in the depths of my life I'm not the one who's holding on but it's Christ who's got a hold of me that through the midst of it all I love him I thank him for through it all though I don't understand what's going on or taking place but yet I love him my glory be to God in the highest now to think of it you know God had that confidence in job because he had fellowshipped with job not just talk to him like you and me would talk but he had Fellowship he had communion God had revealed himself to job through him by the sacrifice so they had things in common so God's when God was putting forth this this examination God was not wandering back not eating his fingernails he wasn't wondering he wasn't pacing the floors like oh my goodness I hope job's going to do it I hope but friends let me tell you you've heard that time and time again but neither is God doing that for you and I a test or trial is not given to see us fail is that right it's not given to see us fail but God himself is given under his permission that it might work out to our Glory that through that character might be molded and you and I can realize there's something deeper anchored and holding in my life even God working in your life when you don't even see it and realize that he's working but he's working and you know what that's the secret in you of the Loyalty of your heart that's beating out that material what do you think it is that brings you to a place when you're in the midst of a test trial and you come through that and you begin to see yourself not as the victim but you begin to see yourself that God I'm in need of you Lord and you're molding out of my life what do you think brings that I'll tell you what brings it the same hidden power that was in Samson the same hidden power that was in job it is the secret of God's life working in your own life and you step back I step back and say I had nothing to do with it outside of surrendering and we didn't even realize that so God's confidence is himself operating through his own word that's where God's confidence was in job that's why that God's God's real confidence is God God places his love his life inside of you and me and then that's what God has confidence in you realize that's what the Holy Ghost is let me tell you we listen friends when God when the Seal of the Holy Ghost has come God has accepted your faith God has confidence in you and let me just tell you something like that once that seal has been given you can't break that confidence it's true you might fail but you know what on the inside as soon as you fail even if it's a thought there is conviction that strikes your heart why because there is a faithfulness that beats for God down on the inside you can't break the seal of the Living God amen it's God's confidence and security upon our life and this is why that the faithfulness brother Brandon would put it this way indeed if Jesus Christ I got to read this he talks about God making a contract and he said it was not because you were good not because you joined the church not because you're a good member of society uh you could be ever so good you could live a clean life you could go to church every day you can sacrifice every day you can give a part of your money you can give up all the sins of the world and everything and live just as true and faithful as you can and you'll miss Heaven just as far as East is from the West now some of those things if we're not careful listen I believe God brings about all of these realities in a life are you hearing me I believe God brings these realities right here what I just read about but you see sometimes if we're not careful we can get everything just right out here and everything so forth and then that's in itself when we look at and say what in the world happened it's because it's more this and listen the message is not do's and don'ts the message is not a Creed book the message is Christ the son of man being revealed to you in you and through you that's the reality of this word not a book that we live by but a divine revelation that he gave himself for me that I could walk out of here with a purge life a free life I can walk with I can walk with a burning reality of Christ inside of my life so notice he said you can be just as true and faithful as you can but you'll miss Heaven just as far as East is from the West somebody says well well what good does that do of being faithful going to church or faithful you're missing the point if you're resting on that you're resting on the wrong thing this is what we have to rest on it isn't by goodness that we are saved but it's by his Mercy that we're bought that God wanted to make Sons and Daughters goodness never makes them the spirit of God makes them if it wasn't so he wouldn't have had the sin the Holy Ghost so it takes the yoking power of the Holy Ghost to unite us with the word of God and I want to just refer here into the scripture of Luke chapter 18 and verse 1. I don't have verse 1 there but I want to read it here out of the scripture and it said that Jesus speaking of the unjust judge is said he spake a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint remember he talked it goes on in this scripture speaking about that Widow so you came to that unjust judge on that judge's doorstep and she stayed there he he tried to get her away she kept on coming avenge me of my adversary but you know he himself would say though I don't fear God nor regard man but because this Widow troubles me I will Avenger lest by her continual coming she weary me so this is what listen right there the Bible says in verse 1 that men ought always to pray and not to faint now if I went by feelings many times I wouldn't pray I I know I'm preaching not to Angels tonight if I went by feelings sometimes it feels like nothing's moving nothing's getting answered but you don't pray based on your feelings your prayer is offered up to him who is a faithful and merciful high priest so we're not praying to an idol that's why we don't treat it like that it's a relationship I don't just talk to my wife at the dinner table I don't just talk to her you know at night after the kids have gone to bed and maybe we we sit around I don't just talk to her then but I talk to her at different times maybe throughout the day maybe sometimes when I'm there at the house and sometimes walking by other times it's by text or whatever that's a relationship with God so what are you saying brother Samuel prayer is not check it's been fulfilled for the day prayer is ongoing talking to him it might start with 10 minutes then you're going and doing these things then here you've got another five minutes didn't you sure there's times where you have durations of times but you and I both know sometimes when you try to just set durations of times yeah a lot of other things been on your mind and you never really got free during you made that period of time but you never really got free but you see what God shows us in that and it's not that that in itself is void or vain but it goes to show us that it's it's a relationship with him it's powerful to even start the day in prayer just just a little bit but you see this is the thing there are prayers that's being offered up to avenge me of my enemy my adversary and I'll tell you we got one adversary and that's the devil we are living in the hour in the time where we realize in Revelations 5 when the lamb has taken the book you find no mention of the devil in Revelations 5. you find no mention of him you know why he'd been cast down amen now let me just say this he's still there in Heavenly places but he has been cast down from challenging and coming against your life I know it may sounds like well how can that be he's he's railing against us on and on what I'm saying to you is that the accuser's arguments have been dismantled by the lamb himself you have a blood you have a word that is a sure word of Prophecy you have a word that when the accuser comes you can point it right back to the word your life your experience is based on the word your heart is beating there and what is it he's cast down out of your life he has no place for a foothold unless we allow him but if he wants to get into the mind at some point the lamb is still present to come and remind us of our rights casting down cast him out aren't you glad for that but we got we got one adversary and that's the devil and I want you to notice here in verse 8 it says when that speak of unless when the son of man would come when he cometh shall he find faith on the earth remember how brother Brown would take that over and over when he would preach that and he would take it out of contending earnestly contending for the faith and on and on he said God was not coming back looking for shall I find churches that's not the question shall I find programs that won the question if the question was shall I find faith and the faith that he's looking for is that Faith that'll stand upon his word and I'll tell you that's more than our human Faith human faith can go so far it can go so far but that's it but you see God never intended you and I to walk by our human faith listen I've said it over and over you've got it when you've got in your car you came here tonight you didn't wonder and think about is my car going to start you did not think about what if I'm going to get there all right tonight you didn't think about that that's Faith but God is looking for his faith is that right it must be his faith so then how can it be that God recognizing our faith it's when his faith is what's behind it and that's what moves it from just human faith to Supernatural faith will I find faith on the Earth brother Brown said like this Christ is looking for men and women tonight who will stand out with the love of God regardless the world's looking tonight for someone to display the real genuine Faith Of God no matter what people say I know we say we're sticks and stones you know might break my bones but words will never hurt me I don't know what fool came up with that but that ain't true hmm that ain't true words hurt offenses come is that right it's true no doubt some there's some Sometimes some things you might be dealing with the words that were spoken to you when you were just a young child things that were said even by a teacher or by somebody words are effective is that right but I want you to understand just as much as words can come in that way and I don't want you to look listen to me now that's not to say to take an attitude towards that person who spoke those things because you'll remain in bondage I'm just going to go with it right now you'll remain in bondage if you live under that right there because what Satan has wanted to do is to build a trap in your life to keep a place for bitterness to build up but if you can recognize there is one here tonight with a greater word a word that's able to bring a loosening and a power and a liberty to your life one who knows who you are who knows the potentials that lay into you your true identity and what do I do brother Samuel let go of those other things and take hold of this word that wants to take hold in your life let him come in and bring healing there in your life no matter what people say a real love of God that'll reached down that no matter what people say and what the circumstance is in how I feel or what it looks like that's why there's the need of that genuine faith of God and I want you to think of this Peter would write it like this to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ so this is how the faith of God comes back in and that's what this message come to do for you and I it came to restore real Bible faith listen not that there would be people believing in the Bible there's many people believe in the Bible but it's to restore Bible faith and that Bible faith is the faith of the Son of God it's the faith of God himself the same God who moved down and spoke in the beginning and believed his own word the same God who Moved Upon A Man by the name of Abraham and dealt with his life and worked in his life all along and you watch that Faith grow and grow through every little bit of failure mistake but yet that Faith continued to grow as Abraham surrendered himself to God so much to elohim's Faith itself was reproduced through Abraham's life who was it that brought Isaac elohim's faith who was it that led that that brought caused Abraham to go up on there on the mountain with Isaac it was elohim's faith you said I thought it was Abraham Abraham's faith it was Abraham's Faith but it was a man's faith that all could see out here but they're wondering what is it about this man that's making him a rugged if I could say the prophet's terms an oddball to do such a thing is because there's a faith behind him that's moving him for the word to be fulfilled and a type to be given it's the faith of Elohim being reproduced in the lives of his people I know you don't feel like it sometimes I don't feel like it but I want you to understand even in your daily walk it's elohim's Faith being reproduced in your life you've lived another day in Satan's Eden you've been another houring lady you'll see ya and you've got your right mind I'm telling you that's overcoming power let me tell you what's doing that it's not your faith alone it's God's faith that's moving in your life in an age where there's gross Darkness but yet God is faithful to his word it's God's word being being fulfilled in our lives Hallelujah let me just can I give you two more examples we talk about praying many times we're praying we're praying for things but Samuel you ever prayed for things in situations that it felt like ain't nothing turning around and it feels like there ain't if anything at all it feels like it's getting worse yeah yeah and when you're going to pray and Satan's right there to attack you coming right there in your mind and saying just wanting to bring discouragement to try to just get you discouraged but that's a time to persevere I tell you I stand here tonight there's and I know I'm speaking to fellow Believers there's something that raises up there's times that when you can come to a place and you look at and think I don't know how I don't see how but there's something in you that won't let you stop there's something in you that causes you to rise back up there's something within you that causes you to say I'm going to pray one more time Hallelujah there was a man by the name of amraham this just lit my heart amram himself brother bran breaks into this on teaching of Moses of how Abraham and brother Brown you know he dramatizes it how Abraham would go up to the to The Loft at night brother Brown said he would go up there and he'd be praying and he'd get so tired he'd lay down be praying he fall asleep no don't let the devil condemn you if you fall asleep um yeah but he fell asleep he was praying but see every night even though the weariness from the day and the tiredness and for how many years had he been praying the same prayer but he went back up there and prayed again fell asleep but he received a visitation from the angel and the angel pulled out the sword brother REM said he pulled out the sword and he pointed to the north over into the Promised Land and he said God is coming to deliver his people the promise you've been holding to the promise you've been praying for the one you've been looking through the one that you've pushed through wearingness and even doubts thoughts that wanted to clog your mind I don't think I'll ever see it I don't know if it'll ever come come on I'm speaking real here I don't know if I'll it seems like it's going the opposite way everything is getting harder and things are coming this way but here's what Abraham did he kept going back to the one who made the promise Hallelujah and in the midst of that moment God speaks to him like that and God tells him brother Graham says I like this he said God spoke to Abraham Abraham and told him I want you to know you're going to play a great part in this Abraham because you were faithful in prayer and you were faithful in your house let me ask you something who was it that made him faithful in prayer God who was it then made him faithful in his house God it's God that does it then he turns around and rewards us for yielding to his unction even when we didn't feel like praying even when we didn't feel like it but God turns right around and rewards for the faithfulness that goes beyond our feelings what about Hattie right what about her the first time the third poll was ever used on a human being brother perhaps telling the stories I was there to see that Sea World of the place the the land not not the not where she lived her house because even her house at that time the way the brothers described it to me and brother Bram will talk about it on tape you could you could actually see through the boards and see out but it was one of the favorite places for brother Brandon to go up there and just to rest and to get away and the other brothers they would gather up there and different ones but how he's telling the story about the squirrels and brother Brown moves down and he says the only thing I know it's Jehovah Jireh and about that time with sister Hattie it struck and she said that's nothing but the truth brother Brown describes it in the message speak to the mountain 1959 he said it was like a super anointing came in the room he said I've never felt that he said it was a super anointing and came in the room and said you tell her she whatever she asked for she can have she turned to brother Brandman said what should I ask for remember brother Brandon said here was a woman faithful woman she only made 200 a year and she had put twenty dollars in toward the building project and here she was standing there so what do I ask for now look she's asking a prophet for guidance what do I ask for and the prophet stands and says well you know you know you as a poor person and you know you got your sister over here and you got your you know mother and you you know they're not doing good and you're dead and things like that they're not doing well now notice all these things were here that were temporal that were pointed out but you know what what was in her heart is what declared itself in that moment oh my I tell you what the word did in this hour it led us to a place to where our heart is able to declare and speak out it led us to a place my my my I wish I could preach it I'll feel it it has led us to a place in this reality that is more than temporal things of this world life it's more the material things or Associates it means more than anything because the temporal things will pass away you can be a rich man tomorrow or today and a poor man tomorrow you can be healed today and be dead tomorrow but once you pass from Death unto life that Soul can never anymore die it shows the effect of that third pull what will it do it draws out the desire that's on the inside the word comes to lead you and I to Victory and she said brother Branham the greatest desire the greatest desire brother Brandon what do I ask for he said ask for your greatest desire after he says that and she says my greatest desire is to see my boys serving the lord now mind you while this is going on they're sitting in the corner snickering and laughing but it didn't matter there had been a request that had been offered up and Jehovah Jireh stepped in and provided the conviction that was needed he provided the grace that was needed in that moment to lead those young boys beyond that of just being bondish and kensed in by complexes of teenage Hood he led them into Liberty what did that Jehovah Jireh true Proverbs 28 20 a faithful man shall abound with blessings but he that maketh to be rich shall not be innocent things want to come so quick and so fast he that will haste to be rich we're going to get this going to get that and going to get this I'm going to get that and going to get this and so many times the enemy pants so many things before the eyes of material things that before long you'll be setting them on the street you'll be donating them to Goodwill for any account but a rich man or one who hastens to be I got to get this I got to get that remember it's the rat race that Satan wants to try to trap in getting looked at all these things even listen even among that of our young people when you start out you're not going to start out like Mom and Dad there's things that has to it has to grow I never forget that you know years ago when I heard that sitting around family teaching being done and I remember hearing that because you know sometimes you you look ahead and you look at things like that and you think sometimes it seems like oh well you know you'll never have this or you'll never have that I'm just talking about simple simple simple necessities of life I'm not talking about great big things you know what I'm saying but it seems like when you look at that in that way to realize it's God that has provided it's taken parents to a place to be able to come to that place or the things that they would have but everyone when you look at this through the scripture I'm just gonna have to close right here anybody that's ever hasted to be rich or hasted to bypass that way it always lends itself in failure and that's the same way listen now let me bring it into the spiritual it's the same way you can never bypass anything with God you can't bypass the new birth because it can never it'll never be it'll be like you trying to add peacock feathers to a blackbird that can never be by you can't bypass even tests and trials and looking at others sometimes and you look and think man I want to get to that place where they are they didn't get there overnight it's been years it's been tests it's been trials moldings and shaping that has been going on to make that to bring that about and the same God that has worked in their life is the same God that's working in your life is that right a faithful man shall abound with blessings mine let's just let's just close it right there man don't you love him when I read that scripture there was a quote I came across some weeks maybe months ago and brothers talking about brother Russell creach a brother there in the church and brother Brahm had come back in and he heard a young he heard a young voice that was speaking in tongues and it was brother Russell's daughter Patty and here she is a teenager brother Brown's looking out and he's asking he says to Creech where are you and he says my he says you know because sister meedy had pointed out who it was to brother Brandon brother Brown said you know he said I dedicated her as a as a little baby and brother Adam goes in to talk about he says what Pentecostal preacher or one would desire to have their teenager doing that instead of running out and running around in other things I mean which which which one of us would not desire we want to see our children serve the Lord right we want to see our children sir Lord that that's of a great value and brother Brandon admonishes brother Russell at that time he says look he says I know you labor down there at the interstate very hard working on that job he said you're laboring for that family to make that family a good living and not only just not to make them just a good living but to labor and to you know to bring him here to have him in the house of God and he said brother Russell he said see he said God rewards faithfulness sometimes we are looking you know at different things accolades but I'll tell you there's only one Accolade that I look at that's the real that's the greatest aim in our life and that's the Holy Ghost that's more of God amen once you've been born again of the spirit of God that's that's that's the main thing right there that you've met God personally but then your life continues to grow into blossom in him I tell you that that that's the real blessing that's the blessing we find even as an assembly as a church and I say oh God faithful as it says in the scripture faithful a faithful man shall abound with blessings that's my heart's desire I want to be faithful I want to be faithful in every in everything God help me even in the hard things even in those things that are not just the things that are easy but in the things that are hard we want to be faithful even in these small things I skipped over a good part of it here tonight but even in small things because the scripture tells us whosoever is faithful in the least will be faithful in the greatest so it's being faithful for what God has already put into our hands and what do we do from here oh I believe God I believe God gives us the grace that we have need of to be faithful friends how in the world could you and I even come to that place of faithfulness if God did not make himself known in this hour as the faithful God do you realize sometimes I think maybe a I hope it don't just slip Us by but to realize God coming and fulfilling his word he's revealed himself as the faithful God there's no there's no other that can call him that they can say well he's a faithful God he gave me a new job and he did this and they can quote certain certain promises but to see the God who comes and confirms every scriptural promise and makes it live and will draw out a people for his name's sake who will be born of his Same Spirit to where in their hearts comes out an amen it's God's faithfulness being reflected back through our lives oh God oh God help us Lord even in the moments of weariness because we get weary in the times where our feelings we wonder is anything taking place sometimes when in what we're doing and sometimes you might feel like you're just going through the motions but let me say this to you you're not going through the motions when your heart is behind that Lord I want to be in the house of God Lord I'm going to look to you Lord even as in prayer sometimes it might seem like oh I feel like I'm I'm just just kind of beating the wind no your heart is in it don't let your feelings determine your faithfulness but let God who is faithful let him be the influence of your life amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus how faithful you are how mindful you are Lord Lord God I'm grateful that we can stand here In This Moment and there's not a promise in the scripture that we would have a question over there's not a promise that you haven't made known before us Lord you are the same yesterday today and forever Lord you have shaken these promises before us as your people you've made yourself real to us and Among Us Lord I pray father for tonight I want to ask Lord for your strength Lord I know father is we are gathered here there's times Lord were we can be weary the Bible says be not weary and well doing there's times the Lord where we can become weary like is the scripture but say it would encourage us and admonish us to understand that Lord our prayers though it may seem like we were read there in Luke chapter 18 that it might seem like nothing is moving Lord your Prophet has told us that it will say to this mountain be thou removed plucked up and cast and Yonder sea we may not see it or hear it but one grain of sand has turned loose and has been removed and he would go on to tell us that is a witness that the rest of the mountain is on its way Lord there's been many times the Lord times and I know we all can testify this there's been a grain of sand turn loose I didn't see it feel it or hear it but how do I know because that mountain has been moved whether it was grain by grain one grain then five grains then ten grains didn't matter if thou sayest in thy heart to this mountain be thou removed plucked up and cast in yonder's scene if you say in your heart and don't doubt oh God I pray tonight Lord if there be anything at all that would want to hinder and give some sort of a place for doubt Lord right here in your presence we dismiss doubt Lord we dismiss the Lord God any hold God of any unconfessed sin anything that would be hindering the Lord to know that you're a God who uncovers to bring Liberty Lord in our lives granted Lord I pray for your children Lord right here Lord this evening may you strengthen Lord those that are weary Lord God Lord God may be Lord discouraged and they're weary weary in their mind and their Spirit Lord God but I pray that Lord God may you Lord God encourage him refresh them Lord let them know Lord God there's not a prayer Lord God that you haven't heard like you told Daniel when you finally got through there Daniel your prayer was heard the First Time You Prayed just because the answer didn't come until after 21 days didn't mean that your prayer wasn't heard you your prayer is the reason that I'm here oh God sometimes Lord there's a delay but that don't mean that you haven't heard us sometimes Lord you're just trying us seeing how we're going to react and respond during a delay Lord God as your children We Stand Lord to know that you answer and you answer in your own time and you answer in your own way oh God help us help us tonight Lord help us Lord husbands wives fathers mothers Lord as fellow Believers Lord help us Lord I pray God may you

shed been applied the spirit of God Has Come brought a release in that life to bring a son and daughter of God granted Lord Lord as we started this text here tonight even a few scriptures in who can
