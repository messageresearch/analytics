lord in the further part of it that you just come and just manifest yourself lord according to the needs of your children lord as we look to you father we ask these things lord for the glory of god jesus precious name amen good man as you would turn with me to john jeremiah chapter 29 i want to remind you of the upcoming the meetings here this coming weekend there will be no service on thursday for the bill made that announcement friday night will be at seven saturday at 6 00 p.m and sunday will be the normal time i just want you just to be continue to be very much in prayer and just think of a word a word that just really just been pondering on my heart and it's with everything with god and its investment investment you know we're we're living in a time in an hour where it seems like where things are just being given and handed out and everything left and right without any investment and just like when i i spoke to an individual the other day i was there at the store i was talking to them they happened to be a supervisor or manager and they said you'd be surprised they said of the sometimes the young people that come in here and when we start giving them directions on things to do he said they're shocked you're asking me to work and this isn't this is a time you see it's let me just say it to you it's not the dna of people it's a spirit of the age we're fighting against spirits fighting against spirits but i i believe that there's nothing that you or i can do of our investments of just giving our time prayer meditation being in the house of god those those are the things that god would ask of us to believe his word and then to watch the dividends that's reaped from that i i don't know about you but i believe i do speak for you i want more of god i want more of him amen from the time that i met him he's more than life to me he did something for me that nothing in this world could do and i love him i want more of him don't you let's just let's look into the word here this morning jeremiah 29 and verse 8 for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel let not your prophets and your diviners that be in the midst of you deceive you neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed for they prophesy falsely unto you in my name i have not sent them saith the lord for thus saith the lord that after 70 years be accomplished at babylon i will visit you and perform my good word toward you i want you to look at these next few words it's very important in causing you to return to this place this is what god's visitation what it does as he's performing because his visit he when his visits he performs his word the effect it causes you to return to this place for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then shall ye call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me you shall search for me with all your heart notice one thing that's common within all this him him and i will be found of you saith the lord and i will turn away your captivity and i will gather you from all the nations and from all the places whether i have driven you saith the lord and i will bring you again into the place whence i caused you to be carried away captive now this what we just read would not only be a prophecy that would speak of israel being brought back into their land after 70 years it would also speak of the regathering of israel and god's visit to the 144 000 and how many know they're waiting on their two prophets to appear that takes place when the bride is taken home so god the angel of the lord brother brown tells us in in 1949 1951 he said the angel of the lord is on earth tonight getting israel back into her homeland and it's getting the bride ready for rapture this is a work of the angel of the lord this is the lord's doing god moving upon his hearts of his people fulfilling his word and that it puts a pull upon our lives it causes us to return to that place and this also this also is a prophecy that was given where the church would go away from what god's original purpose that he had there at pentecost when god had a bride standing in his fullness and he said i will restore god would take us back not back to the ephesian age they were already a fallen woman but back to that of pentecost where it was the son of man made manifest in a bride body this was god's promise amen may god bless you bless the reading of this word as you're being seated i want to just speak to you this morning on this thought it's just so pressing on my heart an expected end back to him you see israel as we read and we you know from that in jeremiah and other places israel would go through seasons and times and you know they would be very fervent and serving the lord then they would cool off and a lot of things would take place and then they would cry out to god god would god would move god would send a judge god would send someone that he could get into his hand that would be able to just bring the realization of god back into their midst but before that could ever happen they would have to call out to god so israel was in a they were in a place under the rod of judgment they were in captivity because they had gotten away from the lord they had forsaken him the bible would say it like this but brian turn that based on down that's the one thank you the bible tells us in the book of of uh jeremiah when it speaks of how that israel they had committed two evils and it said they forsaken me the fountain of living water and they hewed to themselves cisterns see the reality is if they had not forsaken him they would have no need to try to hew their own sister but you see the the first part when we we look at this i want you just to take this in mind because in our lives as believers we are alive as believers is built that it would operate by a real spiritual discernment because things are not always what they seem to be or what you can see out here in the natural eyes or feel but it requires a real discernment by the holy spirit to look at how that god would record this in the book of isaiah regarding israel he says the harp the vile the tabret the pipe and wine are in their feast but they regard not the work of the lord neither consider the operation of his hands therefore my people are gone into captivity because they have no knowledge this word discernment here and their honorable men are famished and their multitude dried up with thirst now let me just drop deal with this just a moment here we we look at the term of discernment and there's things that i i believe sometimes that we we don't apply it to the depth that it needs to be applied to when we look at discernment it's it's more than just saying well um this is wrong or this is right in terms of well you know that's not scriptural or this is scriptural but discernment itself it requires something it goes deeper than what you or i can even see or read it gets down into our lives of where we really have to discern and value things that are put before us there's things that that we cannot allow reasoning to guide us we cannot even take reasoning and look at somebody else and say well somebody else is doing this so it must be all right you never base your life based on what somebody else is doing you you have to base your life on as you are giving yourself to the god and praying over everything because let me say it like this in some instances things that might be okay for somebody else may not be okay for you you see god knows even the weaknesses in our life and we've got to be honest about that that there's weaknesses about us there's things that can become easily ensnared in and trapped this is why god told them when you go in the land tear down their pictures tear down their altars god said i want you to remove everything why lest you build it back i don't want those things built back this is where we're standing in this hour i think as parents i think on and on and on we do not want to see all that things are built back that god tore out of our life we want to make sure that the things of what god has brought for our life what god has delivered us from that our lives are a clear expression and it just goes forth in liberty let me just tell you something right now you're never you're there's not such a thing as well we're just gonna deprive them there's no depriving them with putting god first and god being the priority that is not what i call depriving that's what i call if they're inheriting the promise so we we need a discernment we need that discernment here god was right here among them things that they were not even taken into account in their life and yet god was right there and they continued their feast they continued the new moons they continued to go now you know when it's time for the feast of the passover we need to offer this up and offer that up you see everything itself they were doing it but they were just going through the motions it got to a place to where their heart wasn't even in it no more it's such a place to where god could look at it and say your feasts have become a stink in my nostrils you see when god gave his word god's given his word in a way that it's to be kept god doesn't want formality he doesn't want us to wear we just come into a place and we're serving him and it's just without thinking there's a beauty in things becoming a subconscious reaction in our life we understand that faith itself is a subconscious moving there's many times where you have faith you may not even think you have faith that's necessary for healing but god sees that you do have it and it comes to pass in your life and here you are standing with thinking of the first conscience like wow how did this happen i didn't even think but god himself recognizes not our thinking about it but god recognizes what's moving right there in our heart it shows you when we look at these things in this manner god does not desire a people that just become formal and you know things become well we this is just how it's going to be and it's just everything going through the cares of life that's a challenge that's something you and i have to fight against it's things because all around us there's parts of things that can become so common and this is where it's the the challenge in our lives of where our discernment would stay sharpened israel got to a place to where the very thing that they were missing was the very important thing and that's to be the center of all their lives and that was him once their hearts and their eyes got off of him and it started getting on other things then the promises that god made them god had told them you won't have to worry about rain god told them this land you don't have to tote the water like you did in egypt with buckets this is a land that my eyes are upon it my eyes care for it i'm the one who's provided the grain for you to sow i'm the one who's provided the cattle i've provided all of that you see god provided the things that was necessary so that they would be without distraction and their eyes and their hearts would be upon him god's got a purpose all of these things of life are temporal they will pass away and you'll find that how when they begin to drift from that then you find them turning to you other cisterns or cisterns that can hold no water cisterns that just have stagnation cisterns that depend on local revivals that every once in a while rain will come down and rain will fill it up but there's wiggle tails in that there's no type of a lasting experience and power and authority within that but there is in the fountain of life where god said i'll be your protection i'll be i'll be on your side i'll fight your battles for you i will cause there the storehouse to increase i will take care of everything you won't have to focus on those things if you just focus on me it's when eyes are taken off of him then then you have to start trying to meet and do things on your own strength well i gotta make this happen and i gotta make this happen but if it's operated according to the word then god relieves you and i of a worry our focus is no longer upon the cares of this life this is a scriptural principle seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness let me just say this to you seeking is more than saying seeking is an action it's an expression it's from our heart you know wherever a man's heart is that's where his treasure will be also god knows what you and i have need of he knows all of that and all god is asking is let me be the very center of your life i'll take care of all the other needs i'll take care of everything that needs to be taken care of you don't have to do it all you have to do is let me be the center of your life let me just make a point here that's why the devil battles at you and me that's why the devil comes at that place he wants to try to remove our focus and our attention from christ being the center and as when our focus gets away from that then we're left to try to do things on our own and we begin to look at the word as though it's our responsibility to bring it to pass it's not our responsibility to bring it to pass it's god but god wants us looking to him and believing him and then he will come and fulfill and do what he can do he's the power of the church of the living god the power of the church is not its theology or how how well versed it is in the scripture or that's not the power of the church the power of the church is the holy ghost it's god's own life in the church of the living god it's the strength of god it's the word of god because the holy ghost and the word are not two separate people they are one and when the holy ghost is in the church it's the word of the church it's the strength of god that's in the church of the living god this is why paul could say for for to me to live is christ that should be the very testimony put it on the front of the refrigerator for to me is live is to live as christ and to die is gain when christ who is our life shall appear then shall you also appear with him in glory it ought to be such a condition about our life to where when people leave from around our lives it ain't something we put on but there's something of an atmosphere and what is the theme of our conversation sure we might go and talk about hunting sure we might go and talk about flowers but it always winds right back to him to when it's all said and done a person said i'll tell you one thing that's a christian he is the theme of their life they love him this is when it's getting back to him it's the word in him this is where all the blessings lay he's to be the very theme of our life i don't know about you you ever read a book or something like that and you get to read in the book and i'm not i you know i'm not much of a reader i didn't really start reading a whole lot till god got a hold of my life i just skimmed and everything else i had but when you start looking at these things there's sometimes where there's been books you scratch your head and say what in the world's the theme of this book whoever the author is drop them a note and tell them go on back to your daytime job because there's not a theme you're trying to follow a theme and there ain't no theme there let me just tell you something with christ in the midst of the church of the living god it's not a question who the theme is jesus christ is the theme of our life he's the center of our life hallelujah notice this i wouldn't read all these to you but i'm not going to you can read them at home but notice what god let him let him notice here in deuteronomy 28 1 it shall come to pass if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe and to do all his commandments which i command thee this day that the lord thy god will set thee on high above all the nations of the earth it lets you and i know that a position even though israel was chosen and ordained by god god set his love upon them god had made a promise to the fathers god brought him out of egypt but god let him know your position is not something that's just handed to you but your position of authority comes through the word and as you will just hearken to the word hear it hearken to it obey it then the word itself it puts you in position because there is no ruling outside of the word there is no overcoming outside of the word so it's the word that puts the people of god into position deuteronomy 2 oh i love this and all these blessings shall come on thee and over take thee they'll come to you and they will lay hold on you oh my i would love rest i could preach right now on that you know when god when the word itself sometimes it might seem a little foggy to you but that word is coming to you here you are standing there on the word of the living god and now the word has its coming to you overtaking you and god's laying claim on your life he's laying claiming things in your life that you can't see in yourself but god doesn't need you to see it with these eyes he just wants us to believe him he knows what's in you he knows what he's sowed in there and it comes on yet to overtake you to where it becomes part of your prayer life let it be in me lord let it be in me lord let it be in me lord god granted lord in my life look at this if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god the blessing blessings as you can read all the way through down through verse 14 the blessings are certain these are things god let them know i got everything covered enemy will come against you you'll flee seven ways god let them know i've got everything about your life covered but there's a condition it must be in the word the blessing itself it's sure there's no there's no question about the blessing but it's reserved for those who will hear and diligently hearken and dwell in the place of which god has ordained let me just give a little bit of a disclosure i'm not this is not preaching to people that just want to come to church and then just walk out of church and they'd fulfill a duty this doesn't pertain to you but this pertains to people and lives who desire more of god who desire the living god in their lives who want more of him when that word comes across their pathway it's not just something they come to church and then they just forget about it but it becomes a part of their prayer life it becomes a part of their meditation there's something about it that god has stirred something up let me just drop this for a simple example you know our youngest son zachary there my there's certain things that i know better when to say it or not say it because if i say it he ain't never gonna let me forget it he'll keep on bringing it up even if i say daddy do you think we might be able to have a fire tonight well maybe we'll see maybe means persist keep being persistent keep being persistent keep being all the way to 12 midnight or whenever more why he's not going to give up he really wants that and he's got a maybe out of daddy let me tell you something there's no maybes in god god never made a promise with a navy every promise is yea and amen in him amen the gospel that we preach is not a maybe or a hoaxer or a mic it's our no soul it's a reality of a living god and every promise is crowned with amen [Applause] hallelujah he's persistent israel was given this natural land of canaan this was a type it was a land of promise it was a place that god made a promise that he would reveal himself he would make himself known he would come as the messiah to save his people from their sins so when we look at this we understand that that of for israel the land of canaan is a natural land of promised land but there's an anatype of that land of promise and the antitype which is what is really the real land of promise is that of the holy ghost let me just say this israel could be in the land but remember they would go out of the land they would come into the land go out of the land there would be times where they would fall and they would falter but you see in this land which is the real land of promise you can't fall from this land of promise this land of promise is known as the real rest of god it's known as the seal of god it is the holy ghost it is god's own life it is god's word is that right so this antitype here it would be that god himself where the word he would be that of the holy ghost where the word is being made manifest because once again you can't separate the word and the holy ghost god in christ they're one is that right so there would be a call to come back to the word a promise the place of revealing where god would make himself known in his church in his fullness now outside of that land there's no blessings only cursings no blessings outside of that land brother brahm said it just simply like that there's no blessings there's just sensations but inside of this land you say what land are you talking about ephesians 1 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ this is already what we are ordained too are you with me this is the the expected end of where the god the position that god would have for you and i to dwell in notice according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved now god deals with an individual where he finds them and let me just say this to you this is not a new statement to you as far as believers we think god for the real truth of predestination in this hour it brings it brings us certainty we we see that position in the word we know where we've come from so if you know where you come from you know where you're going jesus said i come from god and i go back to god now we we agree that indeed the church is predestinated the church shall not fall the church is ordained and anointed do not fall but the question that has to be resolved and has to be answered us are you in that church see that's the question because it's not there won't be at the time of the rapture god will not be laying hands upon people and saying hey i predestinated you but you were just too sorry to accept it so i'm just going to pull you on in anyhow that is not what god's going to do that will not bring glory praise to the glory of his name but god works by his word in performing the word and as the word itself is actually being opened in that moment by the visitation of almighty god then he causes that heart to return to him think of when god stood there before abraham and sarah's tent door that was a visitation that was necessary not for abraham that visitation was necessary for sarah her name had already been changed but she was still living out as serious but it would take the visitation of the same one glory that abraham met and that same god now stepping down in morphine in human flesh and we begin to speak and unveil the very thoughts of sarah's heart you know what he's doing he's uncovering the doubts because he's got to get the doubt out of the way so the word can go to work and the word perform what the word is promised that it will do and god there's only one way it can't be taught into us it can't be schooled into us it takes a visitation from god himself well i'm so glad that dr jesus still makes house calls aren't you boy i'm so glad about that i'm glad that he's willing to walk down in whatever the state that we were in and he'll make a house call on our life you see it's a visitation where sarah didn't even realize what was going on but what was actually happening in that hour is doubt was being dissolved why because the one who made the promise the one who had spoke to abraham the one that had been leading her husband that same one right now was now there to visit her the one that dissolved doubts in the messenger is the same one that was standing present to dissolve the doubts in that of his pride something happens from that visitation because sarah is recorded as judging him faithful who made the promise thereby she received strength to conceive hallelujah what happened god god moved her beyond her limitations that she had of the word in her life and god helped her to see the word is unlimited in power the word doesn't know how old you got a golden buckeye card or you're drawing social security or the word don't their word does not work like that the word is unlimited in power see god will deal with the individual in where he finds him like where he found the prodigal son where did he deal with him down in the pigpen that's where he started dealing with him you see the spirit of god going out and working now think of this here let me make a few references when israel was down in egypt and remember they would be down there for 400 years actually and end up being 440 years but god said after 400 years but you see then it got to a spot into a place to where israel started groaning and crying but israel wasn't groaning and crying you know it just wasn't something that all of a sudden an inspiration hit them the taskmasters and everything around begin to cause this groaning this sign and israel themselves begin to pray in such a manner that the bible says god had respect to their prayers i wonder if before that time if you know the angels could have asked god hey hey they're down there praying but god could hear that's just they're just going through it you know it's just part of a promise they know and i'm coming to visit them i'm going to deliver them i'm going to walk them out but everything's real good for them right now but god knew it would be a condition that would come about that when that condition would come about it would actually cause within them a desire to get back to the homeland they would begin to see the land that they were in bondage this land is not too good this land is not our home they would begin to have a desire to be free and go back home now brother branham would say it like this in i'm just going to refer to this in the third exodus and brother bram says what it is he's talking about now israel in the natural israel being gathered back you know back into their homeland and other things like that and brother brown says what it is he says you'll find with these things that where there's people that's not inspired and god will use the natural laws of the land to get him back into position he'll cause things to be done brother and brings that up you know there was in the rose of a pharaoh who knew not joseph and he says you know here they are they're living by these laws and and going about them but all of a sudden when the laws himself start changing then there comes a pressure that comes upon them now this is something that it just so resonated in my heart here when i begin to look at this the spirit of god just spoke to my heart as i was looking at this he said if you'll notice the children of israel did not become hardened against pharaoh but it was pharaoh's heart that was being hardened but the children of god they begin to become tender they begin to become more tender to the very things of almighty god oh lord jesus i believe that's the hour that you and i are living in it's not a time to get caught up with this world this world is falling apart there's only one banner that i want to hold high and that's the bloodstained banner of the old rugged cross and to announce to every soul and every life there is a holy ghost that is just genuine and real and will transform your life that's what really matters amen we do not want to be caught up with the things of this world because you know what it don't just harden you against the things of the world it'll harden you against the moving of god i speak that in the name of the lord this is why we must have a tender life hallelujah i'm not against you looking at this or seeing this or what's going on here but just remember make sure that you are more of a word junkie than a news junkie because it ain't news no more it ain't opinion no more it's propaganda that's how it's been come on now that ain't just been from the past few years some of the own people they're the ones that call those things you and i both know that but let's not be caught up with these things you know what does it do you find where people find they feed on things of conspiracy theories and whatever more what does it do it doesn't stop right there on that website it'll bring it right in you'll hold your pastor under conspiracy you'll hold everything under conspiracy that same devil has worked even throughout these websites around the message it's the same critical devil you cannot partake of the world and remain neutral [Applause] but the spiritual mind brother will keep doing this spiritual mind just type in that phrase on your on your table out there in third exodus how many times brother rama keep bringing it up the spiritual mind the spiritual mind the spiritual mind the spiritual mind because why the spiritual mind lives under divine inspiration you see we are not walking by our own devices god has opened his word in this hour the promise that he has made and divine inspiration through the opening of those seven seals his very life being poured into the church of the living god it's taken the very hide and cover off of satan is exposed to him as a defeated devil it exposed him as a blood and it reveals the church of the living god as a triumphant church where the mighty conqueror is standing in our midst where we are adorned with the same baptism of the holy ghost as sons and daughters of god hey we're under inspiration [Applause] hallelujah but this inspiration and ain't going to give you a hangover like or will you come out and say wow what dumb thing did i just do no no this inspiration will pack you to glory this inspiration leads you to an overcoming life hallelujah now notice this difference because you see it's natural forces that puts it in put israel back in her homeland god used all those he worked all of that he put israel back in her homeland natural forces did that but it takes the spirit of god it's been the holy spirit that's been drawing that's been moving upon the hearts of the bride down through time to actually put the bride back in her homeland you see it's in this hour that the church of the living god has been looking forward to in this time do you realize the prophets of the old testament have been waiting and looking for this time they were waiting and knowing that this time of redemption would come that's why the taking of the book in revelations 5 with such a sublime event it is the initiating or the announcement that the end is here it's a time of the finishing up of the gentiles the final sealing of the holy ghost where the mystery's been finished and it's time to go in rapture it's time to turn to the jews it's time for the millennium so in other words you might want to pinch yourself you're in the vision think of this now when all this began to take place you find daniel a prophet of god he's right down there in babylon when daniel was down there let me just read here in first in daniel 9 1 in the first year of darius the son of a hazarist of the seed of the medes which was made king over the realm of the chaldeans in the first year of his reign i daniel understood by books the number of the years oh my aren't you glad for books yes whereof the word of the lord came to jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of jerusalem now notice when he understood notice where his understanding that this is the hour this is the time notice what it led to and i set my face unto the lord god to seek by prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and ashes and you can read the rest of that prayer but daniel himself when this inspiration is unfolding that this is the season of the word to be fulfilled what did it do when that word is even announced there and daniel begins to understand it first of all takes daniel as a messenger and begins to so move upon his life to where daniel moves in repentance you see when the word comes forth the word comes with mercy because knowing that it's not just all the bad need mercy no the good need mercy some of the very true need mercy they believe things wrong thought things wrong they need the mercy of god but what is repentance it's turning from and turning to so when god reveals his word here to daniel daniel himself begins to go into prayer and begins to seek the face or the presence or the person of almighty god knowing that god has made a promise that he will visit israel right there in babylon think about it if god hasn't visited you or me where we were there would have been nothing that could have stirred us or motivated us to even rise up and move toward him but it is god coming and dealing with an individual right where he finds us he might have found you on a bar stool but he didn't come because you were in a bar he came because you belonged to him it was time [Applause] hallelujah it would be in effect think of this here is naomi out of the land naomi's out of the land her they went out of the land you know bad times our famine came up so they went out of the land but they got out of the land her husband dies her sons die and her she has her two daughter-in-laws ruth and orpha but naomi hears something that the lord has visited his people in the giving of bread now you know what bread is it's a staff of life are you with me bread is the staff of life remember they had man in the wilderness but jesus could announce i am the bread that coming down from out of heaven i'm not a slice of it i'm not a crumb of it i am the loaf i am the all of it i am the bread i am your sustainer i am your all in all bread is the life giver it's the staff of life and this she hears god had visited his people in giving them bread it was during the time of the barley season barley speaks of resurrection power where she begins to be stirred by hearing that god is moving there amongst his people brother whereas they were out in that land and god allowed everything else to fall apart it seemed no doubt that naomi could look at it and say my goodness all this was falling apart but she knew as a real jew that god will never blast outside of the land god can never put his blessings on outside of the land you realize even any actions or behavior thought or anything else god can never put a blessing on god can never lead you and i in the way that we're supposed to be led if we're outside of the land of the holy ghost are you hearing me god can't do it in that way so god draws or draws ruth or draws naomi back and when naomi comes back she's coming back home now i'm honest to say it like this this is here a type of even how that where not only israel but where the church of the living god would be called back into a place where the bread has been given be called back into a place of bethlehem being called back into a place where there were his resurrection power where rumors had been handed down through the ages is he the same is he not the same but now it's calling him back to a place to dissolve all doubts to settle the rumors to answer questions it's to bring them back into this place you see for naomi it wasn't good enough just to hear about god visiting his people with bread there began to be something stir in her heart i've got to get back home i've got to get back home i've got to get back home and orphan ruth said we're going to go with you but here the word comes and it presents there i have nothing to give you there's no husbands would you wait long enough for them to get old and just when she begins to present it in that way orpha looks at it but orpha's view is such a temporal view orpha does not have any vision it's not any spiritual inspiration or for only sees good lord what is this in here for me you see orpha's not being moved in the right direction she kisses her mother-in-law and goes right back into the idolatry that she had come out of so-called and what do you find with ruth ruth herself she doesn't know what's going to befall her but what she does know is that where you go i'm going where you sleep i'm sleeping your god is going to be my god she didn't have a promise over there she's a moabite oh preach with me now as a matter of fact among that of israel god had said don't even let a moabite come into the congregation for 400 generations is that right they're not even to come in here 440 but you understand what i'm saying how that there was not even anything that she could look and say my this is a promise she didn't have a promise but there was a spiritual inspiration that was moving in her heart she just knew that there was something there for her she didn't know that she was gonna be married to the lord of the harvest she didn't know she would end up receiving handfuls of grain in his field she did not know that it would be through her life that would actually bear forth a child that would be the nourisher of strength to naomi she didn't know that but spiritual inspiration caught her heart you see it just shows there's nothing that comes easy nothing it's not about our works but nothing comes easy the bible says that we press into it opposition was against ruth there might not have been people standing there with spears but she had every type of thing trying to shoot through her mind and tell her why she wasn't worthy tell her what kind of a race she was of but there was something beneath that that was not a moabite it was a gene of god on the inside under that inspiration that gene of god was responding to the voice of god as it went on it began to identify more and more i'm a daughter of god i'm a daughter of god is that right so much to where naomi would eventually ask her and when it comes to a place after visitations with with boaz and as she comes back with the six handfuls of grain she asked her what is your name naomi knows it naomi knows her name she said i am ruth she was able to identify herself i am his beloved oh my back to him back to pentecost see pentecost is not an organization sometimes you know there's been where you hear quotes and things that are used well i'm pentecostal from the crown of my head to the souls of my feet but if you can't live the word you're not pentecostal you might be pentecostal by a name or an organization or a few quotes that's been patched together and everything else pentecostal is not an emotion pentecost simply put in the prophet's word spoken words original seed pentecost is god it's where deity comes down on the inside they have been keeping pentecost after pentecost after pentacles but one day pentecost fully yeah this was no longer the type this was the antitype now came back to the place to give you back the land that really belongs to you this was a place where satan had robbed you of the privilege of being a son and daughter of god now the real sounding on the day of pentecost and the outpouring of the holy ghost what would it do it would bring back the children of god into the rightful position in jesus christ by the baptism of the holy ghost you see we can never come back into position outside of the world and the spirit and you can't separate the two they go together i want you to think of this here just for a moment i realize i'm not going to get to where i wanted to get to today but you know in the scriptures it speaks of how jesus gives this parable that there was a great supper that was made a great meal he calls it in the book of matthew he says it was a a great supper for his son a certain man and he gave out this invitation and when he gave out this invitation they will immediately begin to now think of it everything's already provided for you i'm going to say something not very spiritual but it'll help you understand it i mean hey i like the grilled food that i don't have to grill i don't mind growing i know my wife well she she enjoys when i take her out to eat or maybe i you know cook dinner or something like that put things together and be able to do that and help out and so forth i might be getting you brothers in some hot water but it's okay you could stick with your hamburger helper but you see who wouldn't want anything that's provided for you right right it's it's not a meal that you show up and say man you know this you don't want to top this off if you had garlic rolls on the side no he's got it all prepared everything that you need and so he sent out his servants and he said go tell him come it's ready and they went out amongst the people come the supper's made ready the bible says they all with one consent begin to make excuses one said i've got an oxen i got to break in um i just bought a piece of land i need to go plow that i just married a wife and on and on begin to be excuses let me just pause here for a minute as he brings something to me you recall in the scriptures where elijah come to elisha he didn't tell elisha this is what god told me you're to stand in my room after i go he didn't tell him that but he just simply passed by and he put the mantle right and took it off and elisha said i'm going going where i didn't say nothing to you you didn't have to his presence let me know that i'm done with plowing my plowing days glory are finished the mantle let him know and here's what he asked him let me let me take care of this let me just you know kill the oxen let me just burn everything up and elijah said go ahead go ahead and do it what do they have to do with me so he took care of all of that then you find him pursuing elijah he never lost sight of elijah now move to the new testament you remember in the new testament when the lord jesus made a call upon a person and they said lord i'll follow you but let me go tell my daddy and my mama and i got somebody to bury then they go dad let me go do that and jesus said no for whoever does that's not worthy to follow me you see what the word was showing you and i it discerns what is first priority it was in elijah's heart to clear everything out of the way i don't want nothing holding me back from following you fully i want to burn every bridge i don't want nothing that's left behind because i am going to receive a double portion of that spirit they begin to make excuses i mean think of it the excuses they made this was not just an ordinary dinner this was the evening time meal of the prophecy of the messiah what they had been waiting on expecting waiting for this to come they had been taking passover after passover they had been going through all the feasts here was the real real feast what was this speaking of of him the true atonement of him who's the supreme sacrifice of his own life the outpouring of his spirit at pentecost but instead they rejected it now they had excuses they had excuses but see those excuses it calls then the man who made the supper he said i want you to go out into the highways and byways i want you to compel lives to my supper showing that the jews they rejected that there they rejected that they will get their pentecost 144 000 will we're living in the time of that once again in this hour it's a great supper it didn't say it was a great breakfast it didn't say it was a great lunch it's a supper an evening time meal it was in the evening time when god came to abraham it was in the evening time where he met abram after the battle was over and gave him red and white it was in the evening time what jesus said except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you it was an evening time prophecy to come and be a partaker of it just don't be around it god didn't call you to be a server here he called you to be a partaker god called you to eat of this bread of life god called you to drink of this wine he calls you to be a partaker hallelujah and even you ruth rahab when you didn't feel worthy but the holy spirit drew you it compelled you beyond your doubts beyond your unbelief the holy spirit has dealt with your life to bring you to a point to say yes lord it's you that i must have an expected end back to him let me just end on this here but braham says it like this and proving his word he's talking about praying for the sick he's getting ready to preach that message proving his word and he said before we pray for the sick we've got to get the people in that attitude it's the attitude that always brings the results it's the attitude that you take towards god here's a woman touched his garment she was healed with a blood issue a soldier spit in his face and put a crown of thorns on his head and felt no virtue at all it's your approach the attitude is what it takes that's what it is tonight dear friend it takes the attitude we are and believe that we are in the presence of jesus christ do we believe that we're in the presence of jesus christ but it's your attitude that brings the results the mechanics is here so is the dynamics if you can just get started god will do the rest if you can just get started god will do the rest how do i get started believing believing not just not just something we just say well i just believe you lord but really if there's anything at all you can say from your heart lord clear out all unbelief lord unbelief sometimes you look unbelief say well i don't smoke i don't drink i don't no no unbelief is doubt unbelief is things that we can even say god clear out my mind lord lord forgive me for even entertaining thoughts of doubt it's not doubt about his word but you would entertain thoughts or entertain thoughts where the enemy trying to poke something down and say lord forgive me lord jesus what is it doing it's dismissing unbelief you see remember when daniel understood what did understanding do it brought repentance what did that do that made a way remember when john the baptist come he had to make a way for the king to come you see the word is not only what brings us in position but it's the same word that makes a way for the king to come it's the word that deals with our heart it's the word that calls us back to him it's it's the word as he deals with our lives to bring us into that place i think that's very powerful if we can just get started god will do the rest now think about that here this morning we can just get started he's here why how do i start just just get in him just kidding in him he said well brother samuel i believe i am in him as a born-again child of god but just get in the spirit that's right here right now just just enter right into that and say yes lord be it unto me if you found that maybe maybe there's things that you didn't mean to but it just kind of taken even your focus off things you've let other things crowd in on your life or things maybe it's hardened you well whatever it is god's dealt with you personally you don't need me to call that out god can do that but you know that very person the presence of god is right before your tent door he's right before your heart and all it takes is just simply let letting god have his way say lord forgive me lord jesus lord i want to abide in the in the land where the blessings are we're the real blessings of god not sensations where there's real blessings in our life where the fruit of the word comes to pass in our life where the word is brought to pass i i want to dwell there lord back to you where it's my eyes off of myself oh i'm not that bear i'm not that good of a christian forsake that kind of a thought that's not what god come to do but god comes to bring a reflection in our life and for us to look at where he's calling us to not to waller just simply stand in your heart and say god forgive me lord i want to rise beyond this i want to press beyond this maybe you're in a place of a stalemate god i'm gonna press beyond this how do you what about the samuel how can you say that because it's about him lord i want the holy ghost more than anything lord because it's about him i want deliverance lord because it's about him maybe it should be setting sin in your life lord i want more of you lord hallelujah i want deliverance lord it's not way out there it's right there it's right there if you just get started you'll do the rest of it what does that mean leave the land where you're at naomi and get back leave it where you're at ruth get back daniel started going back already in his heart are you with me daniel was standing there as a believer and there was inspiration that fell on the children of god in that hour did they have opposition brother aaron they had all kinds of opposition they had opposition of bandits that were waiting to take the treasuries that was headed after they had already uh you know uh laid the foundation and gonna build the temple they had all sorts of adversaries how we're gonna get this treasure that's been given to us back into the homeland but they prayed and fasted and god showed them here's how you get it back home you divide up the treasury you give so much here so much there so much there and it all meet back in the same place there was all kinds of opposition when they got back in the land there were those that told them this wall a fox could run through it there were all sorts of things to try to whisper discouragement but let me tell you something faithful is he who called you who also will do it opposition is no sign that god's not with you it's one of the greatest signs in the world that hell's being stirred up because you're standing on god's word are you with me oh you say trouble's coming my way it's one of the greatest signs as you're standing on god's word it brings a reflection in your life it does to a real believer god am i standing where i need to be and when you can be certain in your heart you can say okay mr devil you have no place here because even if there's anything out alive once it's brought back in life you're standing back in authority again [Music] hallelujah you just get started god will do the rest no he won't pull me he won't pull you but he'll keep encouraging you his spirit keeps moving and keeps strengthening you back to him let's pray hallelujah maybe as we go in prayer here this morning and you just reflect on that in your heart you say lord i want you to be the center of everything lord in my life maybe he's not moved to that to a certain depth in your life yet to where that that seal of the holy ghost has come just invite him he'll come there let it be a hunger in your heart that rises say god more than anything more than anything lord i want that assurance i want that life i want you lord i want you hearts and lives that all around throughout the building could say god i want that very i want you to be the very focus of my life maybe you've gotten cold on god maybe you've let other things take place things where maybe you've got hardened maybe doubt has crept in but you would say want to want to want to just make a real invitation to the lord and say father you're the center lord of my life you're the one who provides for all of our needs you're the one lord who brings your word to past amen god bless your hands let him be the center let him be the center let him be the life-giver hallelujah amen he still heals the sick he still delivers the captive he still feels with the holy ghost he's the same god he's the same god who restores he's the same god who comes to minister to your heart maybe you've grieved him in some way but he'll come right back that dove will come right back just what do i do just become a lamb again and say lord i invite you lord forgive me lord god bless your hands lord jesus [Music] lord you're so mindful [Music] you're god you see lord the very very thoughts lord of an expected end back to you lord i pray this morning help us lord i pray lord you see the hands that were lifted up [Music] lord there's lives that dear god there's no doubt there's all kinds of discouragement things the lord like ruth had they only had ray have different ones but father there's a longing that's in their heart it's about you they're not interested in church as far as just coming to church or calling this their church or no no it's you and that's how it should be it should be about you lord i pray that god that lord for that desire that is beneath that hand lord jesus may they realize lord god and lord jesus you're right there right there lord ministering to their life may they lord god take a hold of that promise lord god and yield themselves to you so completely [Music] lord jesus that you'll come lord perform that good word in their life lord the longing lord is for you they don't want formality they don't want church they don't want traditions they don't want doctrines they want you they want you the life giver lord i ask lord in the name of jesus christ that god as they've responded to your voice the lord you know their heart now i pray god made they just pulsate within their heart and their life this is my promise this is my promise granted lord i pray granted lord jesus dear god there's hands that were up lord lord jesus throughout the building [Music] sometimes lord with distractions of life or not that we make excuses but it's true sometimes the lord priorities to where lord god it moves lord from where you're the very first place and center [Music] lord where sometimes it becomes when we have time lord i pray right now god may you restore the alignment lord may you restore your god that right order lord in that heart that desires to say lord i want you to be first lord jesus i want you to be first oh god throughout this building lord jesus every one of us lord dear god you're the one that's to be the very center of our life center of our thoughts center of our actions our talk our doing to be the very center lord i ask lord god granted lord for every home for every marriage lord god for every daddy every mama every husband every wife lord god every young person lord god lord god i ask lord jesus grant it lord that you would be the very center lord of our life lord may it be lord god that we would not just make a decision lord without passing it through you lord we will not look at it lord god and try to reason it out lord of this or that but god may we pass it before you in prayer lord god grant it lord jesus we don't want to be entangled with the affairs of this life we don't want to be entangled with the cares of this world lord we want our lives to be free to be clear to where we're yielded lord where we're not weighted down this is an hour lord god to lay aside every weight and every sin that does so easily beset us lord that we might run the race with patience oh god granted lord jesus [Music] or perhaps there's some here this morning maybe they're a little weary i just read lord got here this morning where your prophet when he was speaking of the hour and the time that we're living in how that all the old prophets and different ones by faith they saw the day that we're living in and they're depending on us without us they cannot be made perfect there is a completion of the work dear god as your prophet begins to offer a prayer in mentioning these things in prayer lord jesus he calls out lord he said perhaps there's some here that's a little weary and they seem a little weary in their spirit a little weary in their mind lord i ask right now in the name of the lord jesus may you strengthen those lord that would be weary [Music] lord they're not weary and evil doing they're weary in doing good but they're weary some lord god fighting lord it seems like lord god there's been a barrage day after day different things coming lord they're standing on your word but they need a fresh touch from you lord jesus granted lord i pray may you strengthen lord jesus every weary heart strengthen them lord i pray by your presence lord grant it lord let him know father let him know lord lord your word it'll come to pass may they stand lord on that promise no matter if it's something they've been praying for maybe they've been standing on it for such a period of time maybe they continue to stand right there on it and say lord you made the promise lord jesus i give myself to you and should bring it to pass [Music] heal every worry ever weary discouraged heart heal those that are sick in their body lord maybe the enemy is trying to sidetrack in the lord god coming with an affliction in their body may they just receive virtue lord right now i pray father granted lord strengthen their body may they take that token lord that's been given to us lord jesus as we applied in prayer and we endure satan to take his hands off in the name of the lord jesus christ granted for your glory father amen and amen oh don't you love him [Music] hallelujah for it's the more i see [Music] this [Music] yes [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] of this world [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] yes [Music] hallelujah [Music] i jesus want to see as you keep playing that song i think about brother branham as he stood there in the message images of christ the brahman preaches as he goes through that message the tabernacle is getting ready to have a revival start into revival services brother bran says i intend while this tabernacle is having a revival i want to have one myself he said i want more of the holy ghost to take over more of william branham he said that's the biggest enemy i've got the brother band will come at the end of that service he says i want more of the holy ghost to make me more of a servant like he was i want more of him i find brother branham at the end of recognizing its day and its message he would say god create in me a revival create in me lord what's needed where i lack create in me oh glory be to god this is our desire i want more i want more of him i want more i want more of him more of his life think of how things within brother brown's ministry here think about it after the opening of the seals one of the greatest events throughout history and brother branham is at the point of saying i'm going off the field he's discouraged he says it seems like when i preach people continue to do the same things well brother friends come into town pin your hair up so you don't want to preach on short hair and hold on you know what brother brandon told us he said i've developed a complex [Music] how what was that complex [Music] but then goes in to explain it over and over as he walks through he says because i have wanted to see this operate in such perfection but it wasn't up to him to operate it in perfection it was god who was perfect to me i'm so thankful for these examples in the message it gives me it gives me great encouragement because you see the battles you see the things that can come up things that all of a sudden where it can move him or it's not christ it's being the center within it but then how god can bring it right back around and say you want to make that decision you want to go off that way your wife will leave you this will take place and that will take but it's your choice but he came back to a place god turned it around god didn't come down and the complex lifted from me just like that it didn't happen that way but i'm going to stay right here and preach and just let god work it out in my life but you see what's powerful is when a person first recognizes this is a problem or this is a hindrance or it's in the way and then recognizing and begin to submit it to god and let god dissolve it god ain't looking down on you saying my goodness how could you get that complex how could that have happened how could you have gotten weary how could no his desire is he wants his word to come to pass in our life but he won't force himself god doesn't come down and force it no he needs us to yield so he'll come down and he draws deals with our life into that place where he's the focus of it he's the focus i'm glad about that aren't you i want more of that and brother braham says god create in me that what i lack what i need create stir it up in me to ask for it oh yes it's jesus all the more i see this world the less means to me i really want to see yes if it's [Music] [Applause] jesus [Music] that i really want to [Music] of this world the less it means me [Music] [Applause] [Music] sing this song i surrender all i [Music] surrender [Music] fish [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] say [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] oh [Music] i feel the pool [Music] oh [Music] for he speaks to [Music] [Music] in bed and my mind [Music] just [Music] [Applause] is [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] praise the lord hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Applause] [Music] me [Music] hallelujah it's is a great match [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's moving me thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh [Music]
