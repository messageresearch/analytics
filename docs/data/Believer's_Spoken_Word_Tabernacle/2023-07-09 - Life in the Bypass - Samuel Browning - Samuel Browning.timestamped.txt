[43:46] in my name there I'll be in their midst also Lord we're counting on that and we believe
[43:51] Lord Jesus that you're here with us Lord we just ask that Lord that even as the word is
[43:57] going forth that God you'll deliver Lord those that are held captive that God that you will
[44:04] fill with the Holy Spirit oh God the hungry hearts and refill us Lord Jesus with your
[44:12] spirit may this be a moment Lord of an acts 4 moment where the spirit of God we receive

[44:35] you're the Lord that healeth all our diseases Lord may you just take control Lord we pray
[44:42] we just give ourselves to You Lord For Your Glory in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen
[44:46] amen God bless you if you'll turn with me to Second Corinthians chapter 5 and uh verse
[44:52] one we'd like to look there and I certainly want to say also I I heard that regarding
[45:00] brother Dave Kress and we certainly appreciate brother Dave Mr Shirley I love them very dearly
[45:05] and um just so thankful for the testimony amen throughout the years Amen to consistency
[45:11] the solidness and we know that that's something that God does you know as good as a person's
[45:16] DNA could be it's got to be something more than good DNA it takes the DNA of the Holy
[45:24] Ghost amen because there's nothing we can lay on ourselves it's it's the grace of God
[45:30] Amen and um I think of that just as I think of brother Dave and brother Dave Jr he tells
[45:36] this story where when they were attending the little church that my my dad was pastoring
[45:41] in Rockford down there and uh brother Dave Jr was you know taken downstairs to be corrected
[45:47] and so uh he was going to be spanked and so his brother Dave senior asked him said David
[45:53] do you have any words before I spake you he said oh I want the Rapture to come laughs
[45:57] I'm sure that we're all not too much different when tests or trials or things come you know
[46:03] we say Lord just give me the Rapture you know all these things that we go through it's just
[46:08] reminders this world's not our home amen so I I just I thought that was all right I think
[46:14] you've thought it to a number but every time you tell it I get a kick out of it oh my kids
[46:22] know how to apply apply the word don't they uh amen God bless you second Corinthians chapter
[46:26] 5 and verse 1. for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we
[46:33] have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this
[46:39] we groan in this Earthly house that we are in earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with
[46:43] our house that is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked
[46:48] because God's provided the necessary garment the wedding garment the robe of righteousness
[46:51] that is called the baptism of the Holy Ghost and so that's the Garment so that that garment
[46:57] is the is is the earnest that we have a body that is waiting there and not just way out
[47:04] there but right here right Among Us this it's a dimension that's moving even faster even
[47:07] right now amen so to think of this for we that are in this Tabernacle do groan being
[47:10] burdened not for that we would be uncloged but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed
[47:15] up of life now he that hath brought us for the South same thing as God who also hath
[47:22] given unto us the earnest that's the down payment of the spirit therefore we are always
[47:29] confident knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord now
[47:35] what brings that confidence because we've received the earnest and the earnest it gives
[47:40] us a confidence to walk in this life that while we're at home here in this body we are
[47:49] absent from the Lord for we walk by faith and not by sight amen I say God grant that
[47:56] in every aspect and every part of our life we are confident I say and willing rather
[48:00] to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord wherefore we labor that whether
[48:06] present or absent we may be accepted of him for we must all appear before the Judgment
[48:11] seat of Christ now that's not the white Throne it's the Judgment seat of Christ this is where
[48:17] rewards are handed out that everyone may receive the things done in his body according to what
[48:21] he hath done whether it be good or bad now I'm not doing things and I know as a Believer
[48:25] you're not doing things to say I wonder how many rewards I can accumulate over there but
[48:29] you what we do we do is unto the Lord the Bible said of what we do let's do it heartily
[48:37] right it's unto the Lord our desire is to please the Lord I'm not interested on how
[48:42] many accolades or rewards that we receive but there's one goal that we have and that's
[48:47] where we want to please the Lord if there's one thing about it when it comes down if I
[48:52] could just put it in this kind of perspective when it comes down to that day I would hate
[48:57] to stand there in that place and God stand there and say you wasted a lot of time on
[49:01] Earth you were so occupied with so many other things instead of being occupied with my will
[49:06] I don't want to stand there like that but rather I want to be able to stand there and
[49:14] say you know there might have been stumblings there might have been failings fallings but
[49:20] you were occupied with my will Amen to the desire that you had to please the serve to
[49:24] do this to reach out remember the Bible says that even a cold cup of water given to one
[49:29] in need is not forgotten is that right God help us to be to recognize those things like
[49:33] that amen because everything else of this earth when we pass on none of those other
[49:38] things that matters it's not going to matter when when the Rapture comes we're not going
[49:42] to receive rewards of I tell you they were always they were always working overtime at
[49:48] the job and they were always doing this we're not going to receive those rewards there'll
[49:52] be no rewards like that whatsoever but the rewards that God will be handing out at that
[49:55] moment Upon Our Lives will be that because of the spiritual working of the Holy Spirit
[49:59] In Our Lives I say God help me help us to evaluate everything every step in our lives
[50:04] knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men but we are made manifest unto
[50:10] God and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences amen may God bless you as
[50:18] you're being seated this morning so good to be with you I want to say that we just so
[50:23] appreciate your prayers as we were there in the the Youth Camp my mind's kind of spending
[50:29] a little bit right now I told my wife yesterday evening I said I'm just having to try to grip
[50:36] in my mind that just two weeks ago I was we were opening the camp there in Australia and
[50:43] then that we've already now completed the other part and I just want to say thank you
[50:48] for your prayers I know that I think those those services are online even from this past
[50:55] um week and I know I said I would get the link to you uh if you wanted to see that of
[51:05] Australia and then the Believers Youth Camp that's down there the service is just the
[51:11] brothers just did a wonderful job in the in just how God moving in such a wonderful way
[51:19] and I certainly I certainly believe with all my heart there were real experiences in both
[51:24] places so deliverances in both places and where Spirits had wanted to to come and take
[51:28] a hold of young people's lives and you can just see you can the full spectrum and you
[51:35] know Satan doesn't look around and say oh these are young people in the message I won't
[51:44] come against them but Satan comes against young people that are around the message he
[51:51] would love nothing more than to pull them away and I just say this just an admonition
[51:56] to us even as parents brother Brennan would talk about how that the things that are right
[51:58] around us he said on the newsstands and everything else and he says all all of this that's out
[52:00] there is set to poison the minds of our young people and we don't have to go out on a newsstand
[52:07] there's things right around us here and in our hands and so forth and there's a there's
[52:14] a lot that could be said about that but when I think about statements that brother Branham
[52:20] made in invasion of the United States and in perfect strength by Perfect weakness when
[52:23] brother random could say all he says the lid has been taken off of hell and he said demons
[52:29] are streaming out of Hollywood then he would say that all these are the lids taken off
[52:35] of hell and he said and demon powers are streaming in let me just say this there's there's not
[52:42] been even over the years when I've I've been there to work with young people one-on-one
[52:46] in a prayer line or in the uh in the midst of praying with other brothers or things that
[52:54] God has given in my heart why we've been praying for him that I can tell you there's been almost
[53:00] every Spirit that's been dealt with but you know God makes himself to be known that he's
[53:06] still the mighty conqueror and that every generation receives its visitation and I just
[53:10] say it in this way sometimes we look at things and say well I wonder how this happened I
[53:14] wonder how this happened because even some different ones that we we worked with a young
[53:19] person that was there in Australia that God broke a spirit that was upon that life that
[53:25] was with homosexuality and God broke that Spirit we begin to deal with that very thing
[53:32] that you that it's mindful of the things that we're looking at because this generation the
[53:37] world that we have out there is a world that is continuing to just bombard and what it
[53:44] wants to do is desensitize and tear down if brother Brown would remind us over and over
[53:49] and over and over in the scripture that what molded Abraham Lincoln's character was the
[53:52] books that he read so it's mindful of experiences and the things that we have and and I believe
[53:59] with all my heart when we look at many times this isn't in my notes but many times we look
[54:08] at things with depression and anxiety and things and we all can experience certain things
[54:13] to a degree at different times different Junctions seasons of our life things we go through but
[54:21] you know I think it's very very very very very uh crucial that we as parents you watch
[54:26] and make sure and don't just say well this is my son or this is my daughter they're a
[54:31] good person they're I there's a level of trust but there's also a part that God calls you
[54:38] and I as parents not to be naive I know that's pretty straight but I'm just letting you know
[54:42] we are stewards to watch over them to help them to guide them throughout this whole time
[54:47] and you know what that I'm glad that the holy spirit is mindful of that to lead us Amen
[54:54] in those things so I I'd like to just uh speak here this morning we spoke on the thought
[55:01] last week on passing through where the Lord just give that inspiration as I was sitting
[55:08] on the tarmac there in Brisbane wedding waiting to lift off and as I began to look and just
[55:17] just ponder over those things uh this thought began to strike me as I looked into the message
[55:21] of who is this Melchizedek and I want to speak on the thought of life in the bypass life
[55:27] in the bypass and perhaps the title itself will become a little bit more clear to you
[55:31] as we as we journey in this but you know God makes known in our lives that your life my
[55:39] life we're not here by mistake I don't know what you might have been told by your parents
[55:46] I don't know and I don't think that would ever be fitting for a parent to say that but
[55:51] I don't know what you have thought or what you've been told but let me just say this
[55:55] there's no one here by accident the the Avenue that we have may have come may not have been
[56:03] God's desired Avenue but nonetheless we're here and God God has a way to bring us to
[56:10] where our faith is centered upon the word of God so that there's nothing that you and
[56:22] I can even look at within ourselves and say well I've done this and I've done this and
[56:29] I've done that but it comes back to it's the foreknowledge of God God himself knew of each
[56:36] and every one of us and God God within himself he he desired to be a father and God had a
[56:43] family his his his his thoughts that he had and God there as as we recognize when we see
[56:50] it displayed through Abraham God's desire where Abraham would say Lord that there would
[56:54] be an heir of my house he was displaying God's desire for that of an heir and we recognize
[57:00] that the children of God that we were with God before the foundation of the world the
[57:04] scriptures that we could spend the just months of just elaborating just on script scriptures
[57:07] where we were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world and simply put like
[57:10] this even when I look and consider you know my boys as they were standing up here they
[57:15] were there within within my father and grandfather on doubt but there there was a designated
[57:17] time and a betting ground for them to come forth for Fellowship to take place and God
[57:19] himself is desired fellowship with those of his kind those of his children those of his
[57:24] offspring and so when we when we recognize that then then how brother Brown would bring
[57:31] this in it is very much so in the message of who is this Melchizedek and he's dealing
[57:32] with how that we and ourselves are attribute sons of almighty God and how that when we
[57:36] in ourselves when we we came here we came here as an attribute In the Flesh and he's
[57:41] bringing the difference of when Abraham remember God called upon Abraham him and when Abraham
[57:45] comes into the land God opens the land to him and then God himself he makes himself
[57:50] known to Abraham when all the rest of the kings are coming out and Abraham has went
[57:53] down there he's defeated the Kings he's rescued lot brought him back home and as he's coming
[57:59] back before he gets back home he meets Melchizedek to think all the rest of the kings are gathered
[58:06] in that moment in that time uh brother and sister I believe like this when we look at
[58:13] this that scripture speaks of where you and I are at in this moment because he met he
[58:20] met the very fullness of the word made flesh the very fullness the person of God now you
[58:26] know where he hadn't become Jesus yet but here is the person the word that is there
[58:31] meeting Abraham and Abraham's followed this voice he's following it's laid hold on his
[58:35] life and now as he stands there here in in the veiled in that form he begins to declare
[58:38] to Abraham who he is Abraham you're of the most high God let me just say it like this
[58:44] there is nothing else that can tell or declare to you who you really are outside of the word
[58:49] of God and it's the word made flesh just like when brother Brown would use that example
[58:55] over and over in the scripture about the ego flying over the Barnyard it would have done
[59:01] no good to send a picture of an eagle it would have done no good just to talk about an eagle
[59:07] but it was the eagle himself flying over and when the eagle flying over it was it brought
[59:10] an atmosphere it brought a creation oh and and that's why brother Ram says when you feel
[59:16] that tug of the spirit of God moving in your life he said that's the Forney for knowledge
[59:21] of God taking place within you he said it's something in you that you and yourself couldn't
[59:26] even desire to be in there but God had placed that there and now Mama Eagle comes over it's
[59:30] not the music that's making the atmosphere it's not even the forcefulness or lack of
[59:35] by the speaker it is God fulfilling his word that makes the atmosphere let there be light
[59:39] and there was light it scattered the darkness and the Rays of the s-u-n begin to warm and
[59:49] bring forth seeds that had already been planted and in this hour it is not the s-u-n upon
[59:57] our life but it is the s-o-n Upon Our Life the son of man signs shining in his strength
[1:00:04] in this hour to bring forth a bride in Harvest so here stands Melchizedek before Abraham
[1:00:12] and brother random would say it like this I I'll get to it in just a minute Brianna
[1:00:18] I just want to refer to a few places here he says brother REM says concerning where
[1:00:22] he was he said we bypass that sea he here he come from thought here to the word and
[1:00:26] straight to flesh and as brother man will go into this we bypassed that we came from
[1:00:31] attribute and we became flesh and then why in the flesh we now are formed to the word
[1:00:37] now notice the bypass doesn't mean that something's not there how many of you have ever I did
[1:00:44] I didn't get a chance to give it to him but how many of you know when you're driving on
[1:00:51] the road you come into a major city you can take a bypass right I think when you go to
[1:01:01] Columbus you come to the 270 bypass it is the bypass itself you can be straight on 71.
[1:01:11] you can go right through the heart of Columbus or any other City on that Interstate but then
[1:01:18] they provide and usually that uh oh my that bypass has three numbers on it because it's
[1:01:24] within that bypass is where three stages of Grace will come forth you see within that
[1:01:31] bypass there it's a it's something that represents even where we are at in our walk with God
[1:01:41] we we didn't come the direct route the the the direct line but there's a bypass we came
[1:01:47] from the attribute to become flesh and now from flesh now the word in US is pressing
[1:01:52] itself it's bringing this flesh this life in subjection to reflect and match the word
[1:01:57] of God what's happening it's life in the bypass but if it had not been from him for him you
[1:02:06] and I would not even be able to have life is that right we when we went home we would
[1:02:20] be in the same place that the Old Testament prophets were in and the rest that we're looking
[1:02:24] forward to this fulfillment of the word they were looking forward for one that could stand
[1:02:31] in the Gap and be able to put their hand on a holy God and a sinner and bring them back
[1:02:40] together you realize when the spirit of God as it comes down in our life you know when
[1:02:46] the blood has been shed it doesn't make a bridge it actually does away with the chasm
[1:02:53] so there's not a need for a bridge that's how powerful the blood of Jesus Christ is
[1:02:55] to go in and dismantle every hold in your life and let me just say it like this how
[1:03:01] does it do that by going in and changing your desire and changing your nature and then you
[1:03:06] would then through that God continues to move through your life and there's a development
[1:03:09] as a son and daughter of God in the image of almighty God it's life in the bypass now
[1:03:14] let me just say it like this he says brother Brown would say it like this I'm just going
[1:03:18] to I'm going to read this I don't have it for you up there brother Brahm said you come
[1:03:23] like Adam and like me you became from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted right
[1:03:29] you say well I don't want to be tempted well I don't think any of us like being tempted
[1:03:37] paid tempted tested but you remember the reason of attempting and testing let's just set this
[1:03:44] up clearly the reason of the tempting and testing is also because there's nothing goes
[1:03:54] in a Hall of Fame until it's past the Hall of critics and the tempting in the testing
[1:04:00] it only declares There's real substance there are you hearing me oh you know I I may stumble
[1:04:05] but there's something in you that raises you back up because the same God that's raised
[1:04:09] you up is the same God that's in you you can't keep Resurrection Life down is that right
[1:04:20] that's why even in the midst of your times of Gloom come on we all get it brother REM
[1:04:26] said when I get gloomy I read Romans 4 and I draw encouragement it matters what you do
[1:04:31] with your Gloom if you get on the Facebook and the Instagram and Snapchat and everything
[1:04:36] else and just let everybody know you're wowzy wowzy Woos that we're not we're not handling
[1:04:44] it the right way but as a son and daughter of God are you listening to me you are given
[1:04:48] Dominion to bring this life this life in subjection to the word and it's not about your feelings
[1:04:54] the word is true the word of God has never been defeated Satan wanted to talk Eve out
[1:04:55] of it and he did but when he came to the Lord Jesus the Lord Jesus was pulled with his hunger
[1:04:56] he was pulled to take the kingdoms without suffering is that right he was tempted in
[1:05:02] the in all points such as we are so he felt the Temptation he at those places he felt
[1:05:07] that pull that spiritual pull the Temptation that comes upon our life but he showed you
[1:05:11] and I not just showing us but restored to you and I that a son and daughter of God can
[1:05:20] stand on the word of God and let's put it out the prophets put it the prophet said he
[1:05:27] showed us that the weakest Christian that can take the word of God will defeat the Devil
[1:05:32] at any time the weakest Christian I kind of like that phrase the weakest Christian goes
[1:05:36] to his knees he said Satan begins to tremble why because my help coming from the Lord the
[1:05:42] Lord is the strength of my life in this bypass I need him every day
[1:05:47] Hallelujah and when this life is finished here if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved
[1:05:53] we have one already waiting that's where we go that is the word talking about that theophany
[1:06:00] that Tabernacle we go to then we can look back and see what we've done now we don't
[1:06:06] understand it we have never become the word we've just become the flesh man not the word
[1:06:10] he's talking about that body Romans chapter 8 verse 17 if children then heirs Heirs of
[1:06:15] God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified
[1:06:21] together amen say God help me we're here to be we're here to be tempted to be tested this
[1:06:28] is all part of it brother Brown called it like this in the Hebrew series he said this
[1:06:33] Earth is The Proving Grounds you know the big naval ships they have a Proving Grounds
[1:06:37] off of New Jersey they prove them to see whether they're able to withstand the storms and whether
[1:06:42] they're seaworthy and so all the tests and trials and sometimes you might feel like I'm
[1:06:47] going completely this way and by the way every one of those naval ships battleships aircraft
[1:06:51] carriers are built with the same proportions as Noah's Ark that's true I'm not making that
[1:06:59] up there's the videos within it they discuss that inside of their of their of their navel
[1:07:09] and their and their tanks and everything you know why because the ark was Unsinkable let
[1:07:16] me just tell you something right now no weapon formed against you shall prosper you've been
[1:07:22] fearfully and wonderfully made you've not been made the pattern of a man or a church
[1:07:28] or a man's idea but you have been built after the pattern of your heavenly father and though
[1:07:35] there be times in your life where you rock to 90 degrees but there's something in you
[1:07:41] that brings you back up you might pitch this way but it brings you what back up what is
[1:07:45] that that is the working of the holy spirit in your life God cannot be defeated
[1:07:53] Verse 18 for I reckon I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be
[1:08:01] compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us we got something to look forward to
[1:08:05] for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of
[1:08:09] God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who subjected
[1:08:14] the same and hope so we have been brought we have been brought in subjection to vanity
[1:08:22] why because of the fall in the beginning God placed man on Fremont agency man to make a
[1:08:29] choice just like you and everybody else me we have a choice that we make is that right
[1:08:35] and here we are pleased here up in this life and let me just go say it like this I think
[1:08:43] when we take all of this life together I believe God has placed things in our life to enjoy
[1:08:49] Paul wrote to Timothy about that I believe we ought to enjoy our family I believe you
[1:08:55] all enjoy the things that God has given us because truly if God's given to us something
[1:09:01] then I believe we can really enjoy it because God gave it to us God didn't give us God don't
[1:09:09] give us things and we got to turn around and stress out about him that's called traps and
[1:09:15] we learn from them his grace comes to teach us God don't strike us off give us demerits
[1:09:20] and say you're going back to another great nope it's just a learning moment in our life
[1:09:24] it's part of a growing time but everything that God would bring along even our way it
[1:09:31] comes down to realize that even in those things that God's provided in this life we recognize
[1:09:42] these things it's vanity it's temporary is that right but there's something that is eternal
[1:09:50] and that's what we want to make sure that we're a part of and it's a part of us because
[1:09:56] this world itself gold and everything else it'll corrupt it'll rot it'll give away but
[1:10:01] there's a that within our life it don't matter how old you get it don't matter what tests
[1:10:06] or trial comes your way it doesn't matter how high the waves get there's something in
[1:10:10] you that's greater than you and it is God fulfilling his word in your life that's what
[1:10:17] makes a real Christian that's what a real Christian is a real Christian is not somebody
[1:10:21] who can stand outright in the waves but it's somebody that when the waves come and can
[1:10:28] rock you this way but there's something in you to bring you back upright why because
[1:10:34] there is a life inside of you it's life in the bypass oh my because the creature verse
[1:10:38] 28 itself also oh my the creature that's you and me that's the Son and Daughter of God
[1:10:44] shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption but the same I kind of like this guy well
[1:10:51] you know I like him when you know he obeys what I want him to do but but you know what
[1:10:58] I get that this thing still gets sick and because I'm in this right here I can still
[1:11:06] get down now the Son of God on the inside never gets down the daughter of God never
[1:11:14] gets down but right on here and in my human spirit I can get down I can worry you realize
[1:11:25] fear could come that's why listen that's why it's the need and thank God for perfect love
[1:11:33] to cast it out they cast it out when it comes cast it out putting it right back in its place
[1:11:42] right so all those things that we deal with and it's to remind you and I man if everything
[1:11:49] was good and Harmony lined up and everything just right I would get really comfortable
[1:11:55] here but God knows how to bring things to Brown about in our life to where we realize
[1:12:03] I want out of this pest house there's something better than this pastiles there's something
[1:12:09] that I I'm longing for there's something greater than just this life from the bondage of corruption
[1:12:17] into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God now brother Branham picks us up now
[1:12:24] I'm ready to go here on this he says look he said this makes it very clear you'll never
[1:12:30] be the word unless you was a thought at the beginning that proves the predestination of
[1:12:35] God you can't be the word unless you're a thought you had to be in the thinking first
[1:12:41] so in order to stand Temptation you had to bypass the theophany you had to come down
[1:12:46] here in flesh to be symptomed symptomed by sin and then if you stand all the father have
[1:12:51] given me will come to me and I'll raise him up at the first day at the last day see you
[1:12:56] had to be first now watch my brother ramble put it he said see he come down talking about
[1:13:01] him the word he come down the regular line so what is the regular line from attribute
[1:13:09] before the foundation of the world his name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life then from
[1:13:15] that he become the word the theophany that could appear and disappear and then he became
[1:13:20] flesh and return back again and resurrected that same body in a glorified condition but
[1:13:24] you bypass the theophany and become a flesh man to be tempted by sin bypassed it now you
[1:13:28] know there's sometimes there's things we want to bypass you know when you take a bypass
[1:13:35] I know the bypass itself sometimes that bypass well not sometimes it is it's longer it's
[1:13:42] a journey you know if you look at her on the map or or you know you trust uh Miss Google
[1:13:48] or sister Siri sometimes you can look at it that's a shorter route straight through sure
[1:13:53] it is it's a shorter route it's a longer Journey but you see God in his infinite grace has
[1:14:02] come in this hour for you and I this is an hour of rapture this is an hour of change
[1:14:07] this is an hour where those that have read the promises our brothers and sisters down
[1:14:10] through time and let me tell you something they were excited about this promise that
[1:14:17] we just read here this morning if this Earthly house be dissolved we have one waiting they
[1:14:26] were excited about it it was inspiration that they locked onto they didn't know there was
[1:14:30] going to be Seven Ages but they were just locked into God at that moment and they were
[1:14:35] awaiting his coming why because the coming of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives puts us into
[1:14:40] the channel of waiting and expecting the coming of the Lord that's why we must first experience
[1:14:44] the coming of the Lord in the coming of the Holy Ghost within our lives is that right
[1:14:48] it then puts our expectations it then affects everything about our life yeah right it affects
[1:14:51] everything I mean you let a young man and a young lady start talking it starts affecting
[1:14:54] everything it starts affecting you know decisions and goals and it starts affecting everything
[1:14:59] and that's the same way when the spirit of God takes a hold of our life he changes on
[1:15:05] the inside our desire our nature is to yield to him and then as he's working in our lives
[1:15:13] molding is shaping us it's affecting everything in our life there's things that the holy spirit
[1:15:21] says no no no no no this is not going to work this is not part of who you are and the Holy
[1:15:28] Spirit bringing correction he's directing you and giving you Grace to lay that aside
[1:15:32] and he's dealing with you in this life what's he doing he is tutoring He is building you
[1:15:40] and I up in the image of the word
[1:15:43] people look at you and wonder why you're making the decisions that you're making it's because
[1:15:49] you've experienced life the loving kindness of God in the bypass one thing we don't want
[1:15:54] to bypass is the Holy Ghost we don't want to bypass anyone because if we bypass any
[1:15:58] part of God's word then we're not really in the bypass are you hearing me there's not
[1:16:01] one word of God you see this is why it becomes a very pardon me I don't know what other word
[1:16:09] to say a very ignorant statement to say well I've got the Holy Ghost but if you can't agree
[1:16:13] with every word of God now when I'm talking about agreement with every word of God that
[1:16:16] even when there can be challenges in your life you're still there's a spirit of God
[1:16:20] in your life because you're being molded and shaped and you can look at the word and say
[1:16:26] Amen so be it Lord it's not you're looking at the word and thinking well no I don't that
[1:16:30] that's not you know that's how they did we we've got the more updated version no there's
[1:16:36] you can't because remember there are three that agree none that agree in one and then
[1:16:41] there are three that are one that three are a man that is one the Father the word and
[1:16:46] the Holy Ghost that's directly from first John is that right this is why when we are
[1:16:51] baptized God revealed himself it is the father who was above us now he was with us in there
[1:16:55] of the sonship of Jesus Christ now that same God through the way that's been made now is
[1:16:58] in you and I it's the same God unfolding himself back down into our lives and as God unfolds
[1:17:01] himself it takes the quickening power of almighty God to break the seals off of our life and
[1:17:06] to begin unfold his plan in our life that's why the prophet could say The Secret Of Our
[1:17:10] Lives is now before us amen that's why the coming of the Seven Seals about it's the coming
[1:17:13] of the lord it's the fullness of his presence what was it to do there was nothing could
[1:17:21] break the seals off of your life outside of Christ himself why he knows you blessed be
[1:17:27] Abram of the most high God and he gives you what you need he gave me what I need bread
[1:17:33] and wine on the day of Pentecost he gave him what they needed bread and wine spirit and
[1:17:39] in truth amen what has he done he has broken of himself he has given of himself to you
[1:17:42] and I not something that is an option like an option on a car it's the necessity we need
[1:17:47] his life right we are our partakers of his flesh the word made flesh right we eat of
[1:17:50] the blood uh we eat of the Flesh and drink of the blood we are partakers of the word
[1:17:53] and the spirit amen and amen amen that's our diet our diet is in not man shall live on
[1:17:56] Spirit alone no sir but the spirit of God has come to make the word alive and the spirit
[1:17:59] of God inside of our lives in anoints it quickens and brings forth the Son of God and that Son
[1:18:03] of God Son of God and daughter of God on the inside there's an appetite that's been changed
[1:18:07] it's an appetite for the things of almighty God it's a desire for his word it's a desire
[1:18:12] to have here from him it's a desire to live for him why because your appetite has been
[1:18:15] changed by the coming of the Holy Ghost oh my word got life in the bypass oh my and you
[1:18:19] know what it will stay and step with him God will give us Grace to bypass a lot of Heartache
[1:18:26] is that right we're not going to bypass every test on every trial but there's things that
[1:18:31] if we'll just we'll submit to him and look to him God will give us Grace in this bypass
[1:18:38] now I'm just going to be honest with you right now I you know yes there's something in my
[1:18:41] heart desirable in every believer I want to be pleasing to the Lord I don't like making
[1:18:47] mistakes I don't like making mistakes I'm probably you know maybe I'm just going to
[1:18:52] let myself be a little bit transparent sometimes when a mistake has been made Lord have mercy
[1:18:56] on me and I feel like God I need a crane to pick me up I don't want to disappoint him
[1:19:06] I don't want to let him down I don't want to let his people down I'm not talking about
[1:19:18] compromising now you understand what I'm saying it's just something that grips your heart
[1:19:25] let me tell you something that didn't happen in your life before
[1:19:30] that didn't happen in your life before right I mean you could just you know chew the fat
[1:19:40] with anybody and cut everybody off and Buddy you just cut them off and you're ready to
[1:19:45] go cut somebody the next day you might see when God has has moved into your life you
[1:19:51] can't act that way no more that's how the world Acts
[1:19:56] that's why it's important we have life in the bypass and it will follow him he'll buy
[1:20:02] we'll bypass a lot of heartaches but let me just say this God ain't going to make we know
[1:20:16] this God ain't going to make every decision for us we can as being predestinated in the
[1:20:22] economy of God God will not make every decision and neither does that mean that every decision
[1:20:31] that we make is going to be of God and that's where it puts us in a place not of looseness
[1:20:36] but it should put us in a place not a fear either but looking to him Lord I need your
[1:20:44] leadership there are certain things I can see before me I may not see the Trap line
[1:20:49] I may not see the tripwire I may not see what's before me everything before me can look plain
[1:20:56] can look clearer but I don't want to walk by sight I want to walk by the influence of
[1:21:03] that other realm I want to walk by faith
[1:21:05] right hmm so we bypass the theophany become a flesh man to be tempted by sin and if this
[1:21:11] Earthly Tabernacles dissolved we already have one waiting and we have not yet those bodies
[1:21:16] but when this body received the spirit of God The Immortal Life inside of you it throws
[1:21:22] this body in subjection to God foreign
[1:21:24] there's new there's a new Administration that showed up one time there was Administration
[1:21:27] on the inside that enjoyed the things of the world it could the body would the body would
[1:21:33] handle things say things and do things wear things but you see what had to happen is you
[1:21:39] could you could change everything here on the outside and it's still not be lined up
[1:21:52] right but you see that's why that's why the new birth brings a new Administration on the
[1:22:00] inside right you know you could clean up a person's house and clean up their outside
[1:22:05] clean up their flower bed take care of all the weeds and everything else but if they're
[1:22:12] the ones that let it get like that in the first place it's only going to be a little
[1:22:16] bit of time and they're going to be right weeds in it again and everything and if they
[1:22:19] usually I don't want pigs in the front yard well guess what if if they've got all that
[1:22:21] those things there there's only one way it's not you removing them you got to change who's
[1:22:24] on the inside because whenever you get a change of who's in the house let me just say this
[1:22:28] at one point in time even within our lives here we were brother Brown describes it like
[1:22:32] this in 1965 a communion I'm just going to follow him uh you brother Ben talks about
[1:22:37] he walked upon a fire now where a fire had been burning and then he he recognized that
[1:22:47] after that fire had burned away all you see is the the the you know the chars of the wood
[1:22:52] and everything that's there and brother Brown said where there had been a fire but he said
[1:22:58] now when I see those Charles I walked up and I seen a plant that had begun to come through
[1:23:06] those chars brother Brown said see what it was he said down on the inside of me on the
[1:23:12] inside of you was another nature the whole time it was another seed that was there dead
[1:23:16] in sin and trespasses is that right a lot of things of the world over above but one
[1:23:23] day the spirit of God comes by our way and what does he do he doesn't worry about trying
[1:23:29] to clear away the charge of that fire he just brings forth the life that's beneath there
[1:23:36] you see God is not trying to clean you up out here and I'm going to do this to you do
[1:23:45] this to you friends you find that only works so far I believe that we preach the standard
[1:23:50] of the word I still believe the gospel I believe in a real closed line religion I believe there's
[1:23:57] something in you that comes out against the word of God and you say you've got the Holy
[1:24:02] Ghost and can still wear short britches and wear the things of this world then you don't
[1:24:07] have what you profess to have because the Holy Ghost is not something different from
[1:24:16] the word it's not the third person it's the same person of Jesus Christ the word may flesh
[1:24:21] in you because if that can be then you've got whatever's in you is disagreeing with
[1:24:25] the word and then you have God disagreeing with himself ma what kind of a condition do
[1:24:30] we got then we have a big old mess don't we but I'm thankful for clarity in this hour
[1:24:36] a path to Glory you shall surely find amen life in the bypass you shall see the evening
[1:24:41] light in this hour when light itself is grayish and you know not exactly black and not exactly
[1:24:46] like but it's grayish where people can only see enough just to join a church just to be
[1:24:52] a good enough person but there shall be light in the evening time that light has come for
[1:24:57] the Bride of Jesus Christ for a predestinated listen it's to all if all will receive it
[1:25:03] but God knows there's seed inside of these Earthen vessels Hallelujah and it throws this
[1:25:08] body into subjection he that's born of God does not commit sin he cannot sin now you
[1:25:15] know that word commit means desire right Satan can come upon you and tempt you and make you
[1:25:26] think that's your desire
[1:25:28] my mind explaining the healing of Jairus daughter I think 1954. brother said here he says here
[1:25:34] goes a woman walking down the street and he said here he said the enemy picks it up and
[1:25:40] it says it speaks to the flesh look at that woman he said then the flesh suggested the
[1:25:49] spirit you'd think come on flesh stop it right there but you see your flesh and your human
[1:25:57] spirit is not on God's side that's why you got to bring it subject to the word that's
[1:26:05] why you need a greater Authority because this guy right here let me tell you something this
[1:26:08] guy in this spirit will always take the easiest path of resistance he's a compromiser let's
[1:26:13] just put it this way this guy is an unbeliever your spirit is a make-believer but on the
[1:26:19] inside is a Believer three kinds of believers
[1:26:21] Hallelujah and the spirit will suggest it there to the soul and if the soul is good
[1:26:25] fed upon God filled with the spirit of God is feeding that white dog then there's a strength
[1:26:30] on the inside what is it to resist the enemy and he Shuffling from you is that right brother
[1:26:35] said he goes on in that same quote he said here's somebody comes and says look at this
[1:26:38] old guy he's singing Tunes going down the street he said in first thing comes it Whispers
[1:26:42] to the flesh get even with them
[1:26:43] yes sir brother Sammy I'll take right to Facebook get even with them then he said then he said
[1:26:48] the spirit Whispers that to the soul but he said when he gets back to the soul the soul
[1:26:54] said vengeance is mine it might be come on now our spirit can build a little bit upset
[1:27:01] [Music] oh brother Samuel not mine oh Lord have mercy we're dealing with a different
[1:27:07] Spirit there listen frenzy you we sense this I'm not I'm not saying these things just to
[1:27:13] put things out I'm saying it as he bring it to me this word inside of us throws the body
[1:27:26] in subjection the body wants to be pulled over a certain way sometimes we have feelings
[1:27:36] and let's just be honest we have had to ask forgiveness because we've acted on impulses
[1:27:42] from other Spirits instead of the Holy Ghost but at least you ask forgiveness and didn't
[1:27:46] say that's what they get because if that's your attitude you need a deeper work in your
[1:27:50] life not condemning you I'm just telling you there's a better way amen you don't know how
[1:27:57] I was treated when I was growing up but let me point you back to before the foundation
[1:28:05] in the world you know I I know anybody else no amount of counseling can undo all the hurt
[1:28:09] and everything that's come your way but there is something that is a healing bone and if
[1:28:14] you're in the holy spirit will bring healing to your life I don't care what you were told
[1:28:18] I don't care how people ran you down I don't care how they mistreated you all those things
[1:28:22] listen they're all real but I can tell you right now they're an amount of drugs they're
[1:28:25] in a psychologist a psychiatrist psychologist that can never bring the healing you need
[1:28:30] but the healing bomb there is healing in the name of Jesus
[1:28:34] airs for you oh man in this bypass there's healing you might be sitting here this morning
[1:28:37] and you can stand in your life and say I know what God has done in me but there's things
[1:28:40] you still struggle with in your life and God said let me be your healer let me manifest
[1:28:44] my healing power let me go down in your spirit where you're wounded where you bruise and
[1:28:47] let me bring healing in your life
[1:28:48] so I'm glad Jesus cares aren't you oh my it throws this body subject brother Ram goes
[1:28:49] on the next paragraph said you don't have to say oh if I could just quit drinking if
[1:28:53] I could just just get in Christ it's all gone because your body's subject to the spirit
[1:28:57] it's no more subject to the things of the world they're dead they are dead your sins
[1:29:04] are buried in baptism and you're a new creation in Christ and your body becoming subject to
[1:29:12] the spirit trying to live a right kind of life it's within you
[1:29:15] it's within you
[1:29:16] oh brother Samuel I'm doing a pretty good job no it's not you doing a pretty good job
[1:29:24] it's God it's God we're by the same thing I'm not where so and so is the new birth listen
[1:29:29] to me the new birth does not make everybody on the same plane spiritually are you hearing
[1:29:34] me it's just like for a young person receiving the Holy Ghost it does not all of a sudden
[1:29:39] make them act like a 47 year old man there's certain things about a 47 year old man that
[1:29:45] longs for his recliner after the service is over
[1:29:49] maybe a piece of something sweet later on tonight God help me stay away from that right
[1:29:57] now but there's certain parts of it whereas young person can come out of here and they
[1:30:02] think man you know after service they're going to be ready to play volleyball basketball
[1:30:08] or do this or do that but you see the holy spirit in our life it does not bring us completely
[1:30:17] into that place but there is a growing there is a developing there is a molding in our
[1:30:24] lives right what are we doing we're giving ourselves to the Lord oh my is that all right
[1:30:31] now notice here so when we look and we recognize this even within our life I I just gotta I
[1:30:38] just gotta move on here in First Peter chapter one verse 3 if we can skip down to there Paul
[1:30:45] writes even or Peter writes of this body Paul would write of the hope that lays before us
[1:30:50] blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant
[1:30:56] Mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
[1:31:04] the dead to an inheritance incorruptable and undefiled and that faith is not away reserved
[1:31:08] in heaven for you I mean this guy's corruptable right this guy itself I mean is susceptible
[1:31:13] to sickness this body is still sin this is not my inheritance this is an Earthly house
[1:31:18] just like I have this coat on I've got other coats that I could put on but this coat that
[1:31:24] we are wearing this Tabernacle how Paul would write of it this Earthly Tabernacle this terrestrial
[1:31:29] are you with me this terrestrial has borne the image of the Earthly but now Paul would
[1:31:36] write it's time for us to Bear the image of the heavenly see it's God pressing himself
[1:31:43] through in our lives it's God pressing it's the light that's pressing this is why when
[1:31:46] light comes in your life brother says like a little white button and it presses itself
[1:31:50] right it presses itself until the whole being is overtaken with life you take light like
[1:31:54] for example before we used to have these windows in here and I would come in here to pray it
[1:32:04] was dark during the daytime it was dark sometimes I'd have to walk up here or step in there
[1:32:10] get my eyes adjusted to it but you know what if I turned on a little my little flashlight
[1:32:15] on my phone that I had back then that light itself would go and it would move it would
[1:32:22] it would just start to move and make a way so I could see where to get to and that's
[1:32:28] just I know a very simple carnal example but the same and but in a much greater way when
[1:32:33] the Holy Ghost is coming to your life it's God pressing himself through in your life
[1:32:38] he's pressing himself well what's he doing when he's pressing himself he's saying lay
[1:32:43] this aside lay that aside lay this aside lay that aside why there's not enough room for
[1:32:48] everything if our character of the previous molding to continue and the spirit of God
[1:32:52] is there to mold our character to match his word that's life in the bypass
[1:32:55] look at verse 5. boy we could sing the song something keeps holding me who are kept by
[1:33:00] the power of God through faith let's say now I don't even feel like I have faith don't
[1:33:06] don't even confess that faith is not about your feeling faith is not a conscious thing
[1:33:13] okay Faith is a settled something but you can't even explain it it's just something
[1:33:21] you just you just share there's something within you it's not what you can explain you're
[1:33:25] kept by the power of power of God through faith I'm too look at this unto salvation
[1:33:30] not until the next meeting but unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time now
[1:33:34] this this journey that we're on it's a longer Journey but it's necessary to rejoin that
[1:33:38] route you know when we we drive 71 I personally myself this is just an opinion it's not the
[1:33:44] gospel but I don't like 71. if I can avoid that route I will I don't know what it is
[1:33:48] about it I guess it's just when you get past Columbus you're in no man's land and you better
[1:33:52] make sure you gassed up or you know where your horses are going to die um I'm the kind
[1:33:58] of guy I like seeing things on exits every once in a while but you know it's the truth
[1:34:05] I don't know what it is about it it has nothing to do so those have lived close to 71 had
[1:34:09] nothing to do with you it just I don't know what it is but sometimes we have to take it
[1:34:15] and so sometimes when you have to take 71 it's just like when we went over to Youth
[1:34:22] Camp I didn't have to take that but I had a bypass to go around the city of Fort Wayne
[1:34:29] and I I went around I went around that of Fort Wayne it's a longer Journey it takes
[1:34:39] a little bit longer but it joins me back up to the route that I'm on and you see we didn't
[1:34:57] have that choice on this bypass but in this life the whole purpose of this life is to
[1:35:05] preparation for the next life this life's really not about this life it's not it's not
[1:35:15] and so with that in mind this is why that brother Brandon let me just let me just kind
[1:35:26] of read this here if I could everybody okay let me read this this this statement this
[1:35:34] quote to you it's also out of who is this Melchizedek and he refers to that scripture
[1:35:42] of second Corinthians 5 1 if this Earthly body be dissolved this Earthly Tabernacle
[1:35:46] we have another one we have bypassed that to come straight from God the attribute to
[1:35:54] be flesh to be tempted and tested by sin like Adam did but when testing of his word is over
[1:36:01] let me pause here right now when testing of his word is over we are tested we're tested
[1:36:08] by and tempted by all things around us there's testings there's trines and there's Temptations
[1:36:14] is that right listen when the Holy Ghost has come it don't remove Temptation it just it
[1:36:22] brings the advantage the Holy Ghost to the Son and Daughter of God on the inside then
[1:36:32] you can say I am not alone I'm not alone he's with me there's a United he's holding my hand
[1:36:43] he's got a hold of me but then there's other times there's promises that we are looking
[1:36:54] for within anticipation and we're looking for him how many remember Joseph Joseph about
[1:37:05] a 17 year old boy he had that dream he had those dreams here he was years later before
[1:37:12] they came to pass and the Bible says in the Book of Psalms until the word of the Lord
[1:37:17] came to pass the word Tried Him what Tried Him the word you see listen even during this
[1:37:26] time during the word I want wonder how many times did Joseph and when he we don't we don't
[1:37:34] get this in the scripture I wonder how many times he cried himself to sleep I wonder how
[1:37:41] many times he wondered why did they hate me I wonder I wonder listen friends in his life
[1:37:48] laying there in those moments you know what all that was for it was working out not only
[1:37:56] all those complexes that had happened but brother Bram takes us in the message of prisoner
[1:38:02] it took an eagle out to show you and I in this hour there was a little bit of pride
[1:38:14] in Joseph's life God knows how to work everything out in our lives there's things I'm sure that
[1:38:31] you and I listen and listen I was be honest there's things I didn't see in Me God knew
[1:38:36] was in me but God don't all of a sudden take you and I and run us through a washer right
[1:38:42] away but it's little by little by little by little by little by little by little by little
[1:38:47] they did not take the land all in one day the promised land of the Holy Ghost is the
[1:38:51] land of overcoming
[1:38:52] sometimes you can look and think you think it was hard to overcome the bottle wait till
[1:38:58] God gets into your life in the midst of your life and then you realize overcoming that
[1:39:04] character overcoming Tendencies overcoming family strength oh ain't no ain't no family
[1:39:12] in here an angel no family in here the standard there's only one family that's a standard
[1:39:17] that's the family of God [Applause] is that right I might be the pastor but the Browning
[1:39:23] ain't the Browning family ain't the standard Jesus Christ is the standard because we are
[1:39:28] flawed and have just as much as the rest we need God's Amazing Grace just as much as everybody
[1:39:35] else we all have our ideas we've got our thoughts our opinions and even though they might be
[1:39:42] my opinions it don't make them truth or facts whoa that was free but it's the truth we all
[1:39:50] are in need of almighty God and the word is testing us the word is trying us I wonder
[1:39:59] how many times where Joseph is laying there and praying but the word is trying him you
[1:40:05] know what as many circumstances that came Joseph's Way you couldn't get that promise
[1:40:09] of God out of his heart
[1:40:11] and that's the same way it is with you you might get put over here or put over there
[1:40:14] or put over there but once you have met God let me just say it like this even before you
[1:40:17] meet God you can't get away from the calling of God and then when you met God you can't
[1:40:22] get away from it there is something that's there sure you might say when they put me
[1:40:28] in this department why are they moving here why did this happen or why did that happen
[1:40:31] sure we all have our grumblings because you know what this guy likes comfort if you could
[1:40:35] have a little meme about this guy don't make none but if you could have a little meme about
[1:40:41] this guy it would be like what they were doing to Moses with the fans bringing you sweet
[1:40:44] bringing you diet Sun Joys and and feeding you Chick-fil-A man everything would just
[1:40:47] be sent just perfect but that ain't way life is life ain't a picnic it's a Battleground
[1:40:53] and I tell you who we're fighting we're not just fighting the devil we're contending with
[1:40:56] our own selves yeah Hallelujah but Grace has been given in the bypass of this life than
[1:41:01] in the midst of these times listen there is something within you and I let me say what
[1:41:04] God's grace leads us to do guide to ourselves that's the grace of God I tell you if there's
[1:41:10] something that we can say Lord thank you this morning it's Grace To Die to myself Grace
[1:41:16] To Die to my will
[1:41:17] that's what brought the quickening power to you and I [Applause]
[1:41:20] Brenda can you go to paragraph 80 there please here we are formed to the word image to be
[1:41:24] a partaker of the word and feed on the word
[1:41:27] I know some of you you knew me from when I was just a small chubby boy now I'm a big
[1:41:33] chubby guy
[1:41:34] I didn't state that little guy back there right let me just tell you something brother
[1:41:39] Bram uses these words when you're born again from Heaven you're a spirit babe
[1:41:44] and he takes that terminology Spirit babe and who is this Melchizedek he works it through
[1:41:48] the message and he says it's just like a woman he said you can take a woman that can be the
[1:41:55] cruelest woman indifferent all those things he said but when she's expecting a baby and
[1:42:01] it gets close to that baby to be dropped to be delivered he said there's a Angelic spirit
[1:42:05] that moves up next God's permitted a spirit to be given he and he said that woman become
[1:42:11] so sweet and kind and tender Stay With Me Now and he says that's the same way it is
[1:42:19] just as the natural body is being formed he said when the angel of the Lord has come into
[1:42:29] your life now a spiritual body it's growing inside of you and what it is there's a body
[1:42:37] right there that theophany that word that's prepared to receive it why because you'll
[1:42:41] never be naked yeah he's just made a way oh my we were naked we were hiding we were running
[1:42:49] lord lord I can't stand in your presence but God
[1:42:53] became me that I might become him he said Samuel I know you want to stand in my presence
[1:42:59] but you can't but I made a way here take the Garment [Applause] of my word be clothed in
[1:43:06] the Garment of the innocency how can it be innocency because that seed on the inside
[1:43:08] was dead but when the spirit of God comes it's a new creation it raises it up on the
[1:43:11] inside there's no tied to the world no more
[1:43:13] sure we battle with this that we have greater is he that's within me
[1:43:16] and we can sing that song He abides he abides Hallelujah he abides in me oh my don't you
[1:43:20] love him let me read this here in Psalms 39 12. I love this David wrote this hear my prayer
[1:43:25] O Lord and give ear unto my cry hold not thy peace at my tears for I am a stranger with
[1:43:30] the and a Sojourner as all my fathers were another words Lord you're a stranger to this
[1:43:34] world and I'm a stranger with you what statement's saying I am a pilgrim and a stranger David
[1:43:41] had had contact with the other Realm and having that contact with God it brought him to awareness
[1:43:47] this world it's not my home I'm just passing through oh sure there's some things that David
[1:43:52] was passing through the duty-free shop that he couldn't go around and he had to pass through
[1:43:57] there's some things that David he made some mistakes there's some things that David collected
[1:44:01] but notice God didn't let him get by with it is that right God never said oh David you're
[1:44:06] my patent this and that but he did choose David because he said he's a man after my
[1:44:11] own heart why because when David would be confronted with the word of almighty God it
[1:44:16] might take the wisdom of God it would to break down David's reasoning is that right he got
[1:44:22] David to a place and he talked about that lamb being taken and David man his righteous
[1:44:28] individual God rose up David said where is that guy
[1:44:31] God said you the man you the man you hear it right there in David's heart see God's
[1:44:36] wisdom friends listen don't you see even within our lives it takes the wisdom of God you and
[1:44:41] I can make so many excuses about so many things but thanks be to God for the presence of God
[1:44:47] the wisdom of God what's he doing trying to draw us out because God wants your fellowship
[1:44:53] your fellowship if there's one request he had brother Ram said one request he had of
[1:44:59] the father before his departure let it be that where I am that they may be also he asked
[1:45:07] for our fellowship
[1:45:08] oh sure David he had to repent yeah there was trouble that came yeah that's exact sword
[1:45:12] would not depart from your house but David accepted the grace of God is that right now
[1:45:17] the Bible goes on to say ah my goodness
[1:45:20] can I have just a few more minutes I hate to ask that because I don't want you going
[1:45:27] to sleep on me not that you're going to but I believe the thought's already God you know
[1:45:31] in Hebrews 11. let me just drop it down like this without trying to to move through it
[1:45:40] the Bible says in Hebrews 11 14 for they that say such things that they're looking for another
[1:45:54] country declare plainly that they seek a country in other words what's he saying it shows in
[1:46:05] their life you see your actions show what's first in your life whatever you do it don't
[1:46:09] matter what we say that's why listen friends listen to me this is why it's important for
[1:46:17] us to say Lord are my actions telling a different story now listen that requires some hard listen
[1:46:28] that requires reflection that requires reflection and let me just tell you something varying
[1:46:31] a church member with enough courage to stand in the mirror of God's word that's being revealed
[1:46:39] and to let their life be examined but the spirit of God will give you and I Grace to
[1:46:47] realize God's not condemning us he's not here to hurt us he's not to beat us down but God
[1:46:55] wants to free you and I because he doesn't want us walking by our image that we've walked
[1:47:06] by he wants the Heavenly to be reflected through our life and so sometimes we've got to look
[1:47:12] in the mirror and say yep that needs to be trimmed off right there you're right Lord
[1:47:20] amen to that Lord let it be and you know what we walk away out of the house of God we don't
[1:47:35] forget what we've heard we begin to pray over those things Lord guide me and direct me because
[1:47:43] I know through my everyday life I don't want to give strength to that area in my life I
[1:47:50] want to live by the strength of God that's my confession the Lord is the strength of
[1:47:58] my life it's the Overcomer in me that manifests through my life greater is he that's in me
[1:48:05] it's an overcoming life I need his strength is that right oh my so notice if they have
[1:48:12] been mindful mindful meaning still having all that oh man of the country oh boy oh that
[1:48:19] country oh boy oh if they'd have still been mindful of that country from which they came
[1:48:31] out of they might have had opportunity to have returned but now they what's that word
[1:48:36] verse 16 but now they what desire sorry he wasn't up there they desire a better country
[1:48:41] that is and Heavenly that word desire means to stretch oneself out in order to touch or
[1:48:46] to grasp something to reach after or desire something so I ask you what are you willing
[1:48:52] to stretch yourself out for what are you stretching yourself out for what do you stretch yourself
[1:49:00] because so many times we all have heard this phrase boy I'll tell you what you're burning
[1:49:07] a candle on both ends maybe that's just Southern expression means pretty soon you're coming
[1:49:12] from both ends or you're spreading yourself out too thin that'll mean you're on Weight
[1:49:18] Watchers it means just simply you're you're committing to too many other things right
[1:49:27] and listen friends I understand the day that we live in I know I know we're living in a
[1:49:37] time where they're asking you know to make uh you know bricks without strong we've heard
[1:49:46] that phrase as well I realize that but I believe that God has entrusted you and me God has
[1:49:53] not trusted me to go around to everybody and and you know sit down and have an evaluation
[1:49:58] with everyone God doesn't God has not entrusted that the Holy Ghost is the one to lead the
[1:50:06] church but I believe as a son and daughter of God I think about how God would deal with
[1:50:18] our life and say Lord I believe I'm really mature real maturity is God being able to
[1:50:24] take his word and put it before us on us make the decision according to the word isn't that
[1:50:32] right when they called Rebecca they they called upon her that they were not in there praying
[1:50:39] and fasting Lord I pray Rebecca make the right decision oh dear God I pray she'll make the
[1:50:49] right decision no they had confidence in her character that had already been displayed
[1:50:54] at that moment so they could say call the damsel and ask her whatever she says inquire
[1:51:01] in her mouth I believe God is calling son Sons and Daughters of God in this hour to
[1:51:18] a real place of manifestation sometimes we look at manifestation I'm going to walk on
[1:51:31] the water and the six going to be healed and listen there's always been signs and wonders
[1:51:40] that accompanies the Believers is that right if it doesn't then we're not believers is
[1:51:52] that right but I believe one of the greatest man a part of that manifestation his sons
[1:52:01] and daughters of God being able to take the word and let the word examine our life and
[1:52:11] the word thou coming out of our life would be able to say the same thing that God is
[1:52:25] saying just like when Adam in the beginning could say elephant when God brought it before
[1:52:35] him horse when God brought it before him lying when God brought it before him I believe the
[1:52:45] characteristic within our hearts as manifested Sons and Daughters of God is to be able to
[1:52:55] recognize our heavenly father his desire and the characteristic he desires to manifest
[1:52:59] in our life and I'll tell you that ain't gonna be a name and claimant that ain't a name and
[1:53:06] claimant it requires dying it required coming out of a service it'll require not only in
[1:53:11] a service as God deals with our life however God deals with it but it will require continual
[1:53:18] dying what God has given to you and I and speaks to our hearts it is it is pertinent
[1:53:23] that you and I take it and pray over it and give ourselves to it this is why the desire
[1:53:35] you can always check what's going on by the desire that you have within your life and
[1:53:45] I want to just say it like this
[1:53:50] you know before I went to Australia
[1:53:54] you know you always want to make sure you're ready to go
[1:54:07] and uh before I left that Sunday we were setting out to eat over here the place I like to go
[1:54:21] to and uh my brother-in-law looks over at me and he says hey Sam he said do you you
[1:54:42] have to have a visa for Australia I said no I don't think so
[1:54:55] I knew I had to have one for Africa and I thought well you know Australia is not a third
[1:55:00] world country anything you know see my mind my reasoning so I'm sitting there and I look
[1:55:01] it up on my phone
[1:55:06] I remember what I got to eat that day but I never tasted a bit of it really felt like
[1:55:14] I got cheated that day because my stomach was just like in one way because I realized
[1:55:20] I had to have a Visa two days less than two days I was once again on a plane to go if
[1:55:29] you don't have it you're not getting in so they said you can get a Visa like this so
[1:55:35] I had sitting at the table I text brother Nathan Erickson but then he's like oh yeah
[1:55:43] I forgot to tell you about that
[1:55:46] somebody you are he's got a lot on his mind but you know so I didn't long story short
[1:55:55] I tried to get in through this particular way or you should you know push the hyperlink
[1:56:05] and get everything nothing I couldn't it said like they came up on their sorry for the inconvenience
[1:56:11] but for the time being I told my wife what does time being mean
[1:56:21] sorry that's just part of My Flesh coming out we're not spiritual about it it was just
[1:56:37] part of mine what does time being mean my wife started looking at it on the way home
[1:56:49] and off all the way from Avon all the way home finally coming in she said here so give
[1:56:58] me your phone she said somebody on here said there's an app you can download if you're
[1:57:07] having problems there so we download the app when we download the app I got in there and
[1:57:18] got my office and I had to you know do all this take a picture answer some questions
[1:57:29] needless to say when I push that button to submit then within just a few moments I was
[1:57:37] granted a Visa to enter wow now those visas just how it's set up there for Australia you
[1:57:43] can get those I don't know what they call me I came here with the acronym that they
[1:57:49] use but this is what I'm trying to say I thought I was all ready to go
[1:57:55] I had my ticket I had my ticket for months months brother Daniel name was planning on
[1:58:02] when I was going to arrive and all these things and things had been laid out for the services
[1:58:10] and I was wrestling in myself because I didn't know about that Visa how am I going to tell
[1:58:18] brother Daniel but you know what let's let me tell you something there was something
[1:58:23] within me and I say this to God's glory I didn't know how that even when there was some
[1:58:29] frustration wanting to creep up some anxiousness but yet deep within I said God you've got
[1:58:35] this that ain't from my glory friends I can't explain that you understand what I'm saying
[1:58:44] that you have something within there's a piece but yet on the outside you're filling this
[1:58:47] wanting to come and it's wanting to try to I said Lord I don't know how I didn't you
[1:58:55] know I didn't even want to go it wasn't my choice I prayed about this for months since
[1:59:01] last June but it just it just dropped but God Made A Way and I thought I was ready to
[1:59:08] go but you see how God that was gone I told my brother-in-law I said that was the Lord
[1:59:18] that told you to say that to me and you ask him in no doubt he didn't feel like he was
[1:59:26] in a spiritual moment with a chip and salsa in one hand
[1:59:29] nope but you see sometimes the things that what we don't even realize but it's to take
[1:59:35] heed to what's being said and that's why I even say to you this morning where are you
[1:59:43] at because brother Bram says when you got the passport that's where you believe but
[1:59:50] the Visa is the token passport is you believing I believe but the Visa is the token you have
[1:59:56] a guaranteed entrance into that other country and God has provided that and see that's why
[1:59:58] I look this is why when the scripture says let me read this here and close Philippians
[2:00:04] 3 20 our conversation is in heaven I know we've got an Earthly Constitution at least
[2:00:10] we have had we've got a conversation our conversation is in heaven when we're living from we're
[2:00:16] living from that inspiration from whence we also look for the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:00:24] so that's that's where I'm looking that's where we're looking who shall change our body
[2:00:29] that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he was
[2:00:36] able even to subdue all things unto himself our conversation our Constitution our inspiration
[2:00:45] this is why we act different look different because the spirit of that land has moved
[2:00:52] in US it affects everything it affects everything around us and you know what happens you go
[2:00:57] into another Nation they have their ways they eat things
[2:01:00] some of you looking at me they have their ways they eat things it'd be like can you
[2:01:06] imagine if a nation they come over here and take over our nation
[2:01:09] Everything Changes your food starts changing diet starts changing right why it matters
[2:01:15] what kingdom is in control
[2:01:17] and whatever kingdom is in control that's what influences your diet
[2:01:22] listen the Bible's clear this thirst to satisfy the desires of the flesh but that on the inside
[2:01:30] wants to please God there is therefore now no condemnation to them who are in Christ
[2:01:35] who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit what is our desire to please him to
[2:01:39] serve him and that's why when there's anything that contradicts or conflicts with that right
[2:01:45] there that's why as a son and daughter of God it's to bring its subject to the life
[2:01:59] inside of you and God gives us Grace for that this is life in the bypass soon and very soon
[2:02:08] we'll go back home we're in a journey on the bypass but he made a way amen though we don't
[2:02:21] see all things yet though we and though we are still in this Earthly house but there's
[2:02:31] a groaning in here there's a desire in here that I know this world's not my home it's
[2:02:41] like when I was in Australia I knew I was only there for just a little bit of time I
[2:02:46] knew that Tuesday night came around I was closer to seeing my wife my kids getting back
[2:02:51] home oh I was just I was ready to get on the plane right then as soon as soon as that last
[2:03:03] service was on let's go I love those people over there precious people but I'm ready to
[2:03:12] get back home how much greater is that in our lives this is why the Holy Spirit moving
[2:03:15] Among Us draws Upon Our Hearts but friends let me just be very clear with you make sure
[2:03:20] you've got all the documents you need
[2:03:22] because nobody will be getting in there on just a passport on a good old boy there's
[2:03:26] hell that's filled with good people the Rich Young Ruler was a good guy good good guy good
[2:03:30] guy but it ain't our goodness he turned down eternal life
[2:03:33] a passport we need more than a passport we need a visa we need the token and through
[2:03:40] that token it gives us strength in our lives to submit ourselves to him let's bear our
[2:03:43] hands
[2:03:44] Heavenly Father we love you this morning Lord thank you Lord for life in the bypass Lord
[2:03:50] we did not come to you you came to us Lord Father Here We Are In This Moment in this
[2:03:53] journey oh God I pray May there not be one this is my request May or not be one of us
[2:03:58] Lord that would miss it Lord father we want to be where you are Lord I pray that God if
[2:04:03] there's one Lord here this morning that doesn't know you in that way God that's just wandering
[2:04:07] around in this life may they come to that realization this life is a bypass this life
[2:04:11] is an opportunity with a purpose that our lives might be surrendered to you that God
[2:04:14] you make us ready and you bring us into that place to serve your purpose help us Lord I
[2:04:20] pray in every step in every phase of the journey Lord that we might love you more Our Lives
[2:04:29] o God be further changed to match Lord your desire Lord as you've given Grace we ask that
[2:04:38] you'll continue to give Grace Lord in our lives Lord continue Lord to shape us and change
[2:04:45] us give us courage Lord when the word is speaking to Our Lives May we lord God recognize that
[2:04:52] lord it's your heart your desire that's calling to us and father I pray Lord we just want
[2:04:58] to surrender to you we love you and we thank you Father in Jesus precious name amen
[2:05:06] amen amen don't you love him
[2:05:09] you know I had a I had a place in here [Music] there was a scripture that
[2:05:16] I thought about quite often remember where Paul talks about pressing towards the mark
[2:05:20] I may remember that where Paul said I pressed towards the mark
[2:05:24] toward the high quality and I like the very next scripture Paul said let us therefore
[2:05:29] as many as be perfect be thus minded let us be minded to press and if anything be otherwise
[2:05:35] minded God shall reveal this even unto you in other words if something's out of line
[2:05:41] God will reveal it to us [Music]
[2:05:43] I've learned a long time ago there's things at times you might be able to see in this
[2:05:47] one or seeing that one and it comes down to our own lives even we need God to reveal it
[2:05:49] we need God to reveal our weaknesses we might say well I know my weaknesses but but see
[2:05:55] God knows every part about us and God even knows sometimes the things that we can absolutely
[2:06:01] think I'm hitting right on the line foreign and then there's things that God will let
[2:06:07] us know hey wait a minute you're not really pressing towards the mark you can put a lot
[2:06:13] of things that you press towards you know you could press your children to be great
[2:06:18] Scholars that'll fade nothing wrong with an education but brother Bram says if we don't
[2:06:22] lead them lead them to serve the Lord then we missed everything so if there's something
[2:06:26] we want to be pressing we want to give ourselves too because we all have so much stamina right
[2:06:32] we all have so much strength and energy and it gets less the older we get right if there's
[2:06:36] anything we want to do Lord I want my life to be in the Press towards things of God and
[2:06:40] if there's something I'm trusting in you Lord if there's something that's lined if my mind
[2:06:43] is any other way I'm trusting in you to reveal it brother Brown took an example in the message
[2:06:48] countdown I think it's tremendous the first time he preaches it and he's just he's just
[2:06:53] had that experience with the brown bear [Music] and brother Brahm tells it right there that
[2:07:00] morning program said c says I've learned that whatever God says will come to pass well the
[2:07:04] ram tells us he said at that moment he said what it was he said God did his part in bringing
[2:07:11] the brown bear but brother Branham was supposed to be in the vision with the young men brother
[2:07:18] Eddie in different ones this is what he goes in to say but because he was afraid of what
[2:07:24] the older ones would say he said I went with the older ones instead now to me these are
[2:07:31] examples that show God's Grace to You and I you can see it right there God's word is
[2:07:38] going to come to pass the brown bear was there and brother Brown brings this in the message
[2:07:44] the countdown picks it up that night and in his presence and this is where he calls out
[2:07:48] to the people he says he said would you pray with me he says all of us together he said
[2:07:58] let us lay aside every weight and sin that does so easily beset us he said God forgive
[2:08:04] me for being dilatory dilatory means kind of Lacks and brother Ram's talking about that
[2:08:08] because he allowed the pressures of the older men they weren't saying nothing to him it
[2:08:13] was a thought boy this could preach do you realize brother Branham made a decision not
[2:08:17] based on bud and the rest of them saying these young whippersnappers it was brother branham's
[2:08:22] imagination his thinking nobody said that see sometimes how we can get in our thinking
[2:08:27] well I think so and so I think this or I think and we make decisions and nobody said nothing
[2:08:33] well I kind of felt this like let's just be honest I want to stand with the example that
[2:08:38] Elijah stood in this day when he could stand before the whole congregation he says I think
[2:08:42] it's good to get everything out in the open confess it lay aside every weight every sin
[2:08:46] that does so easily beset us let's lay it aside otherwise otherwise minded let's lay
[2:08:47] it aside God if there's one thing let me be centered in the Press to that new home if
[2:08:48] there's anything let all let everything be centered if there's certain things I got to
[2:08:49] cut away and it's not me but Lord you've given me Grace to say I don't need that I don't
[2:08:50] need that I don't need that remember the baggage thing I told you last Sunday you come there
[2:08:54] and they're saying you want this you say I spent money on that you want it see the spirit
[2:08:56] of God when God's dealing with things in our life I want to be able to look at things and
[2:08:58] God can look down our life and he'll ask us hey you got a three-quarter bottle full of
[2:09:02] bitterness you want this
[2:09:03] you got a half a bottle full of [Music] unforgiveness you got a tube of malice you want that you
[2:09:05] want certain things that the character Behavior you want that no Lord just put it right there
[2:09:08] in the bleach I don't want it I don't want it going any further in this carry-on baggage
[2:09:10] just put it there because you know what you're bringing it to my attention I don't want it
[2:09:12] I didn't see it as bitterness I didn't see it as a tube of malice I thought it was a
[2:09:16] tube of Crest toothpaste but I realized wait a minute what this is
[2:09:17] I want my way to be unimpeded life in the bypass God gives us Grace [Music] Lord let
[2:09:20] everything be unpacked out of my life that's unlike you I want him to go through my bag
[2:09:21] don't you I don't want him I don't want to just to go through their machine but I want
[2:09:22] him to open it up because sometimes what they'll do they'll kick them bags over to the other
[2:09:23] thing and they'll open it up and start going through pulling this out pulling that out
[2:09:24] because why there's questionable things let me tell you something the spirit of God will
[2:09:25] never pull out something that is okay but I think we ought to be the kind of people
[2:09:26] that you know what let's let it all out if the spirit of God comes and he deals with
[2:09:27] these things in my life maybe it's something that's not even sin but it's becoming a hindrance
[2:09:28] to the spirit of God in our lives I want to be able to say just drop it right there Lord
[2:09:29] I don't want I don't need it I don't need it no more for my journey I don't need it
[2:09:32] life in the bypass I don't need and I believe God you give me Grace I will walk from here
[2:09:53] I will pray God help me give me Grace Lord God to never pick that thing back up out of
[2:10:24] the trash can again I don't want it in my life you accept that this morning it's really
[2:13:41] that simple let it be settled there in your heart and whatever it might be the same I
[2:13:58] don't feel no different don't just say Lord I commit it to you Lord the besetting sin
[2:15:44] the weight whatever it is I let it go Lord I let it go [Music] Hallelujah I wonder we
[2:17:11] couldn't stand and maybe got brother to brother sister to sister maybe husband and wife if
[2:17:18] you're not next somebody maybe you can move around and that's just my hands on one another
[2:17:21] let's just have prayer together
[2:17:22] God knows our needs and I want you to pray for that brother or sister you've got your
[2:17:23] hand on pray for the need that would be in their life maybe it's healing maybe it's Deliverance
[2:17:26] maybe it's the Holy Ghost maybe it's for their heart to be softened I don't know but God
[2:17:28] does just be obedient to the Lord Heavenly Father thank you Lord God for your mercy this
[2:17:34] morning Lord as we're standing as it were passing through the great MRI and x-ray machine
[2:17:35] of the word of God Lord we see even in our lives while in the bypass that Lord God things
[2:17:38] that maybe has hindered things that Lord Even in our walk in our journey with you things
[2:17:39] that we've carried Lord up to this point but Lord God your grace is here standing that
[2:17:40] we would not Lord God Walk any further with that bitterness that malice that lack of forgiveness
