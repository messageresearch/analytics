that will take lord as i stand here once again i'm reserved to your leading lord we love you and we thank you father in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you let's look here in the scripture ephesians 4 and i'm not going to have you standing long i want to just go into ephesians 4. verse 7 but unto every one of us has given grace according to the measure of the gift of so we are all partakers of the gift of christ the life his life wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended and what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and some teachers amen may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i want to say i think as a congregation we certainly been benefited with the ministry that god has given and brought our way i just thank god when we are here i just two weeks ago brother andrew glover and come you know had come and i had actually asked brother andrew sometime before to make way for that and we didn't see brother jerry you know come and i just just so appreciate the word of the lord because for me i was fed i was blessed and i know that the church we were edified and you know god just has a way of coming and i think brother jerry put it in that manner last thursday night god is as we've looked at this is a great master diamond and there are chips off of that diamond and god has so fitted that for each one of those gifts that he has bestowed for our life it's god's love to us and how that god will take that gift and god will take it as it is so set in a way and reflect himself through it and every gift itself even as a man can have the same calling in his life but every gift is unique the experiences and how that the man will preach and how that he goes about god doesn't remove the temperament or the makeup of the man but god sets right down in the midst of that and god will will speak and direct his word and i i just so appreciate how that god is brother brandon would call it god's a god of variety he has a great bouquet of flowers and you know how it is in your uh perhaps in your yard you know i uh even for myself many times i'm looking and i'm evaluating in my flowers and my plants and i'm seeing is there is things too densely for me i say is it too densely the same color if it's all the same color it's not going to be highlighted but i need to break things up maybe have blue highlighted here variegation of leaves right here a white that will that will uh show up the green and god's a god of variety and in every way and in every gift god has it in such a measure that it is all comes back to highlight himself and it's his love that ministers to us as a body and i'm so thankful for how that god has has has used uh when brother andrew was here and brother jerry the messages that were just so so timely and just so many things that just on my heart i i was truly i refreshed and i so thank god for them yielding to the lord i want to continue here tonight and i uh you know looking at this thought on that of of of prophets and seeing this with the gifts that god has placed in the body and if you remember after a few weeks back we were showing that within this scripture that indeed there are prophets in the new testament and as there are prophets that are in the new testament we see it through the book of acts we see that but i want you now tonight this is where i'm going to start moving uh into that place that even every every preacher as i'll read here in just a moment every preacher that comes under the inspiration of the holy spirit in the new testament is a prophet but we recognize in the word that god has promises that there would indeed be prophets that were just more than preachers they would be seers and there's a purpose and a reason for why god does everything that he does and it's to catch what's going on as brother branham would uh take an example for you and i to catch as a symphony to where there are certain motions and certain beats that are to be movements that then will be reflected in the music sheet or what is being played from the music sheet it's reflected there in the great symphony and it's it's god that's at work it's god that has everything in control and god is working and we look at this with prophets and to recognize that prophets themselves are not made they are born and ordained of god jeremiah 1 verse 4 then the word of the lord came unto me saying before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou came us forth out of the womb i sanctified thee and i ordained thee a prophet unto the nations jeremiah didn't know this but god let him knew let him know i knew you before this is one characteristic of a ministry of a prophet is to connect us with that which was before amos 7 verse 14. and then answered amos and said unto uh marzia i was no prophet neither was i a prophet's son but i was a herdman and a gatherer of sycamore fruit so he says declaring i was not a prophet i was doing serving the lord walking with god i was a herdman i was taking fruit but now he declares in other words this is not my choosing i'm not doing this because oh i just felt impressed that's not it at all he's letting him know i was going this way i was serving the lord but god had a purpose for my life i tell you we could really preach with these things but i think the spirit of truth as he's here he's able to open and guide in those places and ways that i can't take time to speak on but you can see that as the prophet was ordained and chosen so is there a people ordained and chosen hallelujah and the lord look at this and the lord took me as i followed the flock and the lord said unto me go prophesy unto my people israel now when you look here in the old testament i know sometimes as speaking to bible readers maybe perhaps some of you that are new in the lord and even those are streaming sometimes when you are reading among in the old testament and with the old testament prophets you will find that how that the spirit of god will move upon them and you can be looking at it and saying what are they saying here then it seems like they're what's going on here and what's being said here there are things at times that are symbols and with a prophet a prophet is picked up and a prophet himself will see things that are going to come way out in the future yet he'll declare what is also going on right now and he'll come around and speak what is going to be in the very near future and a prophet you will say well how can he do that it's not the man it's the gift that lays in the man and the same one that reveals himself as he which was which is and which is to come the lord jesus christ he picks that man up and he lets him see it so there's the characteristics and i want to just really to to deal with some of this here tonight in looking at this part within the prophets a prophet is a seer you'll find that term it's used in the old testament it's used very very much in the old testament well seer is one who would see how can he see unless god shows him how can you and i see unless god shows us this is why even at times remember when god would show the prophet something he would take the prophet show the prophet a vision like he did zachariah of the candlesticks and he asked him what is this and zechariah says thou knowest what is it you see when there's things that we come face to face with god does not expect that you and i will know by our own intellects or by our own reasoning but when god shows us something the greatest thing we can do is say lord i know it's you speaking i don't understand it but god show me what it is that you're saying that's why god could take that prophet and the prophet didn't try to say well i think it's this or i think it's this or i think it's that but the prophet then relied on the one who was opening before him what he was saying i think that's the greatest thing within our lives that we can rely on the god who is opening his word and that's why the prophet would admonish us he says him revelation means more to you than perhaps you can realize because revelation bypasses the human realm of faking it bypasses our reasoning it drops into a level and we become connected with another place and it stabilizes our lives to where someone could try to shake you and it's not that you can't explain it but you have been connected and it stabilizes your life hallelujah that's what the holy ghost does in a alive this is why brother bram says we need to pray for revelation why would god come and reveal something if we're not desiring it oh god you don't speak to me do you want him to speak to you if you want him to speak to you invite him there's a religious group out there that only wants him to speak in a certain way and he's only going to speak by his word and in order for his word to be heard there first got to be a cleansing of the heart god just don't release revelation he first remember there must be a passover before there's unleavened bread so god god works everything is in his time and so we see a seer a foreteller think of how that peter under inspiration would reach back in the psalms and say david foresaw the lord speaking of a resurrection song david being a prophet caught up there by the spirit of god isaiah remember here comes isaiah into the temple of god in isaiah 6 he's walked in that temple time after time after time after time but that day was different that day he saw the god who was in his temple he was no longer just coming in to the temple but now he sees the living god that's among us it becomes personal to his life and isaiah caught up by the spirit of god i think how the prophet would would would express it he said he was caught up beyond his senses what man in his right mind would say a virgin shall conceive that's never been done a man might be able to say well a man shall build an ark that's already been done but never has a virgin conceived many things that have taken place so you recognize that man yielded to god god picked him up and things were spoke through him that if he had let his reasoning catch it he would have said oh no i better not say this they're going to think i'm a kook they think i'm a knight this has never happened you see it could not come to his reasoning this is where oh my this is god's grace even to us as believers that god would give us something greater than reasoning what if what could be greater than reasoning thus saith the lord to be caught up in the very mind of god think of one isaiah in isaiah 53 here he is he writes of the report of the coming of the messiah not as something as though it's a future event i know you've heard me say this many times you've heard no doubt other preachers you see it in the scripture he's these words are wrote in past tense he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him why the prophet was picked up to see what was there in god's mind and listen to me the works his works were finished from before the foundation of the world this is a drama that is unfolding [Applause] hallelujah amen oh glory where men have wanted to alter the script but god in his mercy sends a prophet to bring us back on script hallelujah glory be to god in the highest because it is very important that we are being caught up into god's mind because then we can clearly see that the thoughts of man are confusion look where it has led in the world that we live now her religion has produced a bird a cage full of every hateful and unclean bird the prophet of god picks it up in god of this evil age and says see the spirit of lawlessness what has produced that and they relieved the standard of the word what does it produce what we see going on now it's a people that did not like to retain god in their knowledge so that's why they want to rip everything down i'm going to preach they want to rip everything down why it's a spirit of destruction [Applause] because it speaks against them this is the same spirit that gets upon people that want to tear down the message a spirit of destruction want to take away the memorials and the history that have pointed to you and i that god is a living present god it is our heritage it is our history [Applause] that was free same spirit that's all around one to tear it down tear it down tear it down oh this never happened here and this here and this here what do i want to tear it down but thanks be to god there's a people on earth where they have rallied to the ensign that was promised and have been lifted up and back inside is made manifest in our lives and through our lives that indeed the enemy has come in like a flood but the spirit of the lord has rose a standard against the enemy [Applause] hallelujah it has brought the thoughts of man bring confusion and dissimilation and he leads man listen to me it leads man away from what god intended him to be a son of god one that would reflect his name one that will reflect his image that will reflect his character when jesus came he said i'm come in my father's name so it's coming back into the mind of god concerning the word the thoughts of god the way of the lord revealing himself to the people that we might walk pleasing according to his desire i want you to listen this state this out of the voice of the sign let me just say it before i don't forget it there's some messages i would love for you to listen to i'd like you to listen to brother brown preaches the way of a true prophet he preaches it twice he preaches it in jeffersonville in the middle of 62 and then in the very beginning of 1963 the way of a true prophet and i can tell you not just those messages but listen to those two messages as you're listening to those messages what is when you're listening you will hear as though it's almost he has seeing what is taking place it's because god has lifted him up to see this he sees the hooligans he sees all this all this stuff that's going on this nonsense and everything that's going on that people living all of that is identified are you with me because none of these things that are taking place all these movements they are against god they've got one agenda and that's a homosexual agenda it's not of god god is against that thing hallelujah it's satan once again using people like pawns but thanks be to god that our eyes are open and if you are caught up in that i say in the name of jesus christ get your head out of it get your heart out of it get back in line with the word hallelujah there's only one place we find true liberty and the real rights of a son and daughter of god and that is in the holy ghost my goodness i'm trying to come to this his credentials look he's speaking about a prophet his credentials is that god has vindicated this person to be a seer it's not a credentials of a school it's not a paper it's not well so-and-so sad and so-and-so god vindicates the person now look it says it's the english word a prophet just means a preacher anybody every preacher is a prophet because he is foretelling something preaching the word under inspiration is called a prophet but in the old testament they were more than that they were seers so he's laying this in because of the promise that we have been given one what i'm preaching of right now is not an agabus it's not a silas come on you know he read that they were prophets this is not this is not just a preacher it is a seer and god has set in his word promises that you and i the god made them for this generation that we're living in they were man who told things that was coming to pass and it happened that give him the rights to be the interpreter of the word for that day look at this statement because god took the word of that day and interpreted himself through that man what gives the man that right because god took his word and interprets that promise through that man's life think of how brother branham sit there next to brother brother eddie biscuit in the car ask him do you think that this could be that ministry that was prophesied and spoken there in malachi 4. he says from all i know i can see he says i do too and the presence of god came into that car let me just tell you it's more than a man claiming well this is who i am if that's what he's claiming that word is god and that word will act and perform itself according to that word it will not be the man trying to bring the word to pass the man will be a vessel and god will bring his word to pass come on preach with me now a little bit how much more in our lives ordained to be the bride of jesus christ it's not me struggling to be the bride it's not me trying to be the bride it is god himself that has taken a hold of our lives and we have surrendered it's god interpreting his word through our lives not what i say it's what he says because this blood has a voice the holy ghost speaks amen in christ out righteousness holiness purity [Music] that's what he come on the earth for he's always a sign when a prophet comes to the earth just watch as we go through it you see if it isn't so he always sends his prophet when you see a prophet rise on the scene look out we're looking for one to come now you know some of you i sent not too long i could find many other places some if i remember the one i sent you here's brother bosworth he was sitting right next to brother vale but the veil gives this personal testimony brother bosworth tugs him on the lamp pant leg and he's sitting right there brother brandon's standing there ministering you tense him he says this is what i've been waiting on that was promised in the word of god are you with me these men were not ignorant they knew there were promises in the world they knew the holy ghost would return to the church god did not send his word because there wasn't people to receive it god sends his word when there are people who are desiring for life oh my i just gotta stay on this here it's just so lord jesus and then when you see it you just remember it's fixing to happen this is his credentials then god interprets his word by him and through him numbers 12 6 tells us that remember the whole the entire bible was wrote by the prophets second peter 1 20 knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation in other words a man cannot take a part of the word and that part of the word say it means this and then it contradicts here contradicts this if it contradicts one word it's not the right interpretation is that right none is of an isolated or a private interpretation it's to reveal it's like a picture can you imagine if you had a a a a puzzle and and here you are you know how it is you're putting together a puzzle you're starting looking for the last piece and you know how it is when you were little getting down to five pieces you want to be the last one to put the last piece in you didn't know it but the last piece lay within you [Applause] it's the finishing up in this hour but let me get back to my example here you are with the puzzle and what if somebody calls a piece to come about and on that piece it might it fits perfectly but when you see the picture on that face it comes into that place and you look and say something's not right you see all the rest of the beauty of this picture and yet you see this piece you're like it just man it just seems to dovetail but when you look at it it doesn't blend with the rest of the pieces that's what the word is to do it blends together to reveal jesus christ that he jehovah of the world is jesus of the new year hallelujah for the prophecy oh i like this came not in all time by the will of man so remember like we said i aim us it wasn't amos saying oh god oh lord i want to be a prophet lord i want to be a prophet no no he must say lord i'm so happy to serve you he didn't ask to be a prophet he didn't matter of fact if you don't talk let me just say it like this if you would have asked amos maybe a day before or a week before god spoke to him and said amos are you a prophet he'd have told him no i ain't a prophet do you have something to say i love the lord i'm so thankful for god's mercy amos what else you say well i know judgment's coming but i'm so thankful to be in the refuge but then here comes the day where god says i got something i want you to say you're going to be my prophet and these things you're going to speak you're going to i didn't identify that syria is coming upon as judgment upon israel you're going to point out their folly and all that's going on oh i'm sure that amos would have probably been saying lord is it possible let this cup pass from me now the honor and glory is to serve the lord but what god calls us to do is not comfortable to our flesh so run by the will of man then guys walking out there my i tell you what i'm i'm gonna tear this up you go sit down because you don't even have the right heart are you with me but holy men oh i love that holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost they were one with the word they were speaking amen they were caught up as brother branham would speak of this they're special the prophet is a special person they're built god has built them in a way even to where their conscience and subconscious will lay together they see visions without going to sleep now let me just let me just just move on just a moment here the scripture says on the outpouring of the holy ghost in joel 2. it speaks your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions is that right that is of the whole body prophecy god encompasses remember the spirit of prophecy but what i'm speaking of is a prophet sent from god a person can see a vision but their conscience and subconscious does not lay together it that gift lays within that of a prophet are you with me i see her well i seen a vision no doubt there's people here myself others you know there are no doubt there may be things that god has shown to you but remember god has specially built this man in this way because it's not just visions of healing this has got to catch the vision of the word because without an open vision of the word the people perish there's got to be an open vision oh my so this man he's a little bit out of the way from the rest of him he's got a special commission remember how god likens his prophets to being eagles is that right i think we're a privilege in this time we see eagles i i i love it around our times i'm driving around and i see the eagles and there's an eagle that's kind of over by our house but it's it's nesting next to another church off of meister i want to tell it come on to my backyard i believe in i believe in eagles amen but nonetheless i'll i'll find myself just you know i'm walking down driving down the road or walking around i see it i'm looking for that white glimmer do i see that white glimmer off the head or the tail and and you start seeing now sometimes you can't see that but you know what i started looking for he was trying oh he's had an eagle and all of a sudden from a disc you see this it's not an eagle because it's getting up there and it's not it's it's not built for it but you catch an eagle and they just keep on soaring and soaring time my wife and i in the other house we were sitting on our our deck and i look we've seen the eagles and mines just sitting there and man you can't beat it i had coffee and eagles wonderful but here's what we noticed there was like four or five vultures that was moving in the air too so why in the world it seems like these vultures are chasing off these eagles but they weren't chasing them off the reason that happens is because the vultures start getting testy in a time of mating and so what happens is they start putting trying to put pressure on the eagles but you know what the eagles did they kept climbing they kept climbing and climbing and climbing they climbed past all the pressure they climbed into the realm they were [Applause] [Music] i say spread your wings [Music] pressure comes so higher pressure comes spread your wings there's a current to take you up higher there's an updraft not a downdraft god has sent a word in this hour knocked to ground and bind his people he sent a word to lift us up higher hallelujah lift us above sin lift us above doubt lift us above church lift us above unbelief he sent a word to lift us a prophet is a man whom the word of the lord comes to he foresees way off listen to me you say well what would be the value for seeing where things are far off is to let you know what is coming it's just if i just let's say listen let's bring it down to the spirit of prophecy what if the spirit of prophecy which he can do this he could come and say brother don't go on this roadway to work tomorrow there'll be a green truck and that green truck is going to cross over the median and it's going to come the wrong way take the other way to work and you might look and say what is that that's god preserving life now if a person looks at that and says and they go the same way they've been going they have forsaken mercy when god sends a prophet it is to catch the judgment that is coming on but within that message of judgment if our hearts can be so moved within that moment you find mercy aren't you glad mercy rewrote my life he sees the cup of god's wrath think of this you see god's wrath the prophet is caught up to see god's wrath already brother william the cup already filled can you imagine those that stood around when brother branham was speaking can you imagine how when brother branham would say in 1962 this world's falling apart and say democracy has crumbled can you imagine what that would be thinking of at that time they're just looking at a little they're looking at things oh this will be corrected or this will come on board or this will do that god's not listening to me god's not trying to patch up this nation god's not trying to make this nation an overcomer this nation rejected god this is why brother bram said you can put an abraham lincoln and a george washington in every county it'll not turn it around why the people have rejected god and their hearts are hardened you're seeing a generation you see that movement that's going on right now they hate god i'm just going to say this very clearly to see message people and others get caught up in that nonsense shame on you i said shame on you you need a real awakening either you need a real birth of the holy ghost or you need to be shook back into your place you need to recognize what's going on there's only one thing that'll unite races and that's the holy ghost the holy ghost will make a tuxedo holder how to cover holes the holy ghost will make a black man reload a white man and vice versa they're trying to solve spiritual problems with the reasoning of man but they don't recognize they are influenced by demons but the influence of the holy ghost brings union with the nature of god they keep getting on these i tell you god's identifying i said god's identifying some things don't be upon in the devil's hand you give your all to god but this is who i am this is my nationality this is who i am this is why let god be the who i am inside of you [Music] we don't glorify flesh we don't glorify ethnicity or nationality we glorify the god who brings forth out of every kindred nation and comes it's the holy ghost [Applause] i feel that spirit of god like it was upon amos let him know you you're going in a way of the world to be lifted up to see the oncoming judgment so prophets are signs of impending judgment listen to me let me just let me just work with this this thought here and we'll just they are signs listen signs of impending judgment god does not give a sign for nothing they don't send a prophet for nothing they are a sign they are a sign of impending judgment and they rise on the scene with a message of grace who desired to escape the coming judgment because let me tell you something he cares do you the remnant cares god's care is made known in sending his word look at this ezekiel 24 24 also maybe another message to write down true sign overlooked testimony of a true witness there i gave you four messages oh brother this time what we've been doing having a good old time ezekiel 24 24 that's ezekiel notice is unto you a sign now remember ezekiel was not a prophet prior to the jews going into babylon god had promised he'll bring them back into israel but god sent ezekiel there so that ezekiel could speak to them point out to them this is why you're in the condition you're in god would allow him to display signs laying on his side for so long then he would tell ezekiel go and in front of the elders dig through a hole and out of that hole bring four things right in their midst it'll be assigned to them a prophet was doing things as a sign who is god's letting him know there's things that's been taken right from you you allowed by your carelessness for things to be taken from under your nose that's why brother brahm said he will not be and this was the founding father brother bam picks it up you know as he he mentions he says it's not the worm out here that destroys it it's the worm and the core our founding father says it will not be another nation destroy us we will be we will be destroyed from within this is what our founding father let me tell you something these founding fathers were men of vision they were men of vision my goodness let me get on this it's like public school why why do we have public school do you realize why school came into being well we want to make them smart that was not the reason for public education public education was so that children might learn how to read so they could read the bible that's not my words you can look that up if you can still find it why because our founders believed if people would avail themselves in the word of god that they wouldn't have to fully rely on the police it wouldn't be funding it's saying they just weren't going to have to rely the spirit of lawlessness ezekiel is unto you a sign according to all he hath done shall ye do and when this cometh you shall know that i am the lord god look what brother brahman says here no greater than solomon is here god through all ages has sent gifts and recognitions and signs to the people yeah he says every time you see prophets have always been signs every time you see a prophet rise you better be careful judgments on its road look at noah look at moses look at jeremiah before going into babylon look at john the baptist before the rejection of israel all along prophets are signs and the jews were commanded to believe these prophets and when they come forth with this message god through all ages was telling this wicked generation what they had done think of with abraham let me just let me just uh give just a few of these examples here abraham god calls abraham my prophet is that right abraham god had spoke to him called him out god comes down and takes upon a body of flesh to reveal himself to abraham personally and dissolve the doubts that are in sarah's heart that was prophetic when was that before after god does that he comes along abraham follows him he says shall i hide from abraham that which i am about to do seeing that he shall command his household after him see judgment was coming upon sodom but there was going to be a continuation of the seed line sodom didn't know judgment was coming but abraham did abraham received a message abraham was not in sodom he was outside of sodom he was not locked up in a denomination he was outside are you with me oh sodom looked like a really good place you know it looked like the garden of god come on now this is where lot went it looked like we don't want something that looks like we want he that is i don't want something that's like i won't see that ears what about noah this was before abraham god is getting ready to bring judgment upon the earth he said the wickedness of man not just his actions his thinking all together dwelling on wickedness and the earth was filled this is the bible filled with violence through them there were people who on earth could be inspired with demons for violence but god had a man on earth who is in contact with him that god could reveal righteousness to him and through him no so you're building a boat tell me what harbor you're building it in or not matter of fact i'm building 100 900 miles away hundreds of miles away from the nearest place of water what anybody knows you build a boat in a shipyard come on there were a lot of other boats being built in that hour are you with me there were other boats being built but there was only one that would withstand the oncoming judgment one man i received from god this is what the bible let me just read this the bible says by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen as yet amen what was that you said noah re ring rain how do you pronounce that rain r a never heard of that it's not in your dictionaries it's not in your books but god has let me know he's going to send rings he's going to wash away this wickedness but noah by god's grace it's revealed to him and noah a prophet of god he foresees the judgment coming he's it's coming rain it's coming right but there was elect that heard there's a preparation there's a preparation for you there's a preparation for you there were others who heard ah this doom and gloom message it's all doom and gloom but there are others who said your life you want to come receive life you want to receive life you want to receive difference the rest of them said oh this is this and this is that but the restroom said their safety their safety their safety their safety what are you listening at ah just depends on if you've got an ear to heal he moved with fear he prepared an ark for the saving of his house think of this isaiah jeremiah amos we could go on because amos and the rest of the contemporaries even picked up in those times where i have isaiah you have jeremiah they don't they don't deviate from one another it's a con it's a continual unfolding within that same prophecy that because you have rejected god there's a nation coming to take you over that's what they prophesy you know what israel thought we're of god we're founded on god abraham is our father sarah is our mother we are a christian nation we have laws and judgments and jeremiah and isaiah and o'er said you have the written word but your heart is far from god you don't have the right interpretation why because the right interpretation it brings deliverance it brings a reflection of what the written word is it becomes expressed it's very it's very much where we're at right now or we're a christian nation or where this or that no no no it's a god rejecting nation they've rejected the outpouring of the holy ghost are you with me this is why brother brahma says i don't pray for america anymore what was he talking about i'm not praying for a revival right you catch these these individuals oh we pray for revival oh god turn america around oh and we gather and we'll recite you know the scripture of course of chronicles if my people which are called by my name will humble themselves and they'll humble themselves as not praying in front of a tv camera preach brother simon i will first of all the name of the lord has got to be preached to you and the name of the lord is not an idea of man it is the lord himself and then that word is made manifest then you humble yourself to him and call on him it's not a promise for god to heal this land but god has healed this land [Music] and like jeremiah could step in the midst of the prophecy and god would inspire him and say tell them to speak to their seed that the seed as they will show that word that the seed will come back into this land that's what god has sent in this hour it's no turning her around but god has sent a word a message that is showing a people it's so the people for the millennium our people for the future home it is so the people and to the lord hallelujah glory be to god oh blessed be the name of the lord think about paul in the time of the gospel when the jew to the jews was ending remember they rejected the messiah but god gave a space of grace after they rejected him and crucified him is that right who crucified him his own people catholicism they crucified him but god gave grace there was a remnant that had to be sealed before judgment could come the same way reason god stopped world war one you would have wiped it out but he said hold back the four winds until i have sealed my servants you see it's not only the sealing away of the gentile bride but god has to seal the 144 000. god said stop not doing with it just stop for right now god says hope right now we're under his care the enemy can only make certain advances as god allows him and then god says stop that's far enough oh my after that rejection of the messiah he turned to the gentiles but god moving in such a precious way see the bible says in amos 3 6 shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid shall there be evil in the city and the lord hath not done it see god when people refuse mercy judgment's come coming already but god gives mercy prior to judgment he cares do you care surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets the lion hath roared who will not fear the lord god hath spoken who can but prophesy i want you just to think of this iran says it like this i'm coming down here moses was a prophet just look at this that was god's sign to israel remember god said about the two signs and there would be a voice follow that sign they had been 400 years in bondage and god prepared a sign for them just before deliverance how did god prepare the sign for them you say moses was already born to be the deliverer that's true god already had it laying there in his life he was already ordained to be the deliverer his mom had whispered to him this is right this is the truth this is all right this is the truth this is the message of the hour this is the prophet of god she had whispered that to him but you see god when god sends a sign god prepares the sign so god called him away when he would finally lost all hope of himself and god said now he's in the right place he calls him up there and god makes himself known to moses and god steps inside of moses and he goes back down to egypt what did god do he prepared a delivering sign do you realize in your life christ in you the hope of glory is a delivering sign we have been delivered from this present darkness and translated into the kingdom of his dear son amen [Music] some of you probably think he's caught up he keeps on saying a few more minutes he was a sign of deliverance to israel now look at this and a sign of judgment to egypt well which one is he depends on who you are to want his judgment to another is deliverance to one he's to announce him coming is announcing this nation is finished it's a national sign this is a scripture this is also the words of the prophet moses coming was a national sign to egypt your days of power are finished let me just tell you it runs much deeper than the united states it is announcing to the prince and pound the air he was already reminded when they're on calvary he lost the battle and the mighty conqueror he arose from the grave and now he has come back in the promise of his word it veiled in a people in this last days it's announcing satan your kingdom is finished it's a delivering sign this message in you in me is a delivering sign trying to have to preach how to run a little bit noah was a sign of deliverance to his people and a sign of judgment to the lost world and the unbeliever the very waters that choked the world and drowned the world was the only means of saving noah the only thing that could save him was the judgment and the only thing that will save the church today is the judgment you're talking about the judgment judgment must begin at the house of god it's through the preaching of the word that the judgment that which you're walking under walking under sin and walking unbelief but in the house of god there's judgment that can come to the house of god that can separate you and lift that judgment and lift you into a place as a son and daughter of god what does that the word there's only one thing that can separate you from you and tell you who you really are and that is the word [Applause] let's stand now preach a little bit more noah a delivering sign the same waters that drowned the rest of them noah and those of his house floated right along on the waters of judgment the ark was a place of safety a place of safety think about john remember we're talking about signs of impending judgment think about john lebron would say it like this he said for 400 years god never sent a prophet he said what was god doing why did god wait so long to send a prophet he said because he wanted it to be so outstanding to the people that god had it so set in his word it would be 400 years and then he would send john it would be so outstanding look even the pharisees and those were going out there sending who are you listen to me not one of these john identified himself in the scripture but john nor moses no jeremiah nor ezekiel nor any of the rest of him came to the people and said i'm a prophet you know i'm i'm your prophet i mean no that's something listen to me brother says the prophet knows who he is and when he comes with that word the people recognize who he is this is why you could think who in the right mind who could not see this or who and let me just say if you haven't seen it if i hadn't recognized ask god to reveal ask god say lord reveal yourself to me because you recognize there's something you recognize as different this is not just coming to church not just well let me find a church to be a part of this is not that that's that's that's like a social club it's not trying to be part of a church why i want to be part of a group of people it's not being part of a group of people is to get into christ god's desire is that we would come into him he made a way that we can come into him why 400 years because god wanted that prophet to stand up think now brother brahman said many times to get your spiritual caps on why did god wait almost 2 000 years because it's promised in his word john would come the god prophet of deuteronomy 18 would rise up and the spirit of truth the lord god who would reveal himself in the god prophet i'm talking about the lord jesus he would come back in the church as the testimony of jesus christ the spirit of prophecy as the holy ghost the spirit of truth and he would move down through the church ages age after age after age has went there have been men of god that god raised up but in this hour it's time for rapture and god fulfills his word that he spoke lest i come and smite the earth with a curse before that i send unto you elijah the prophet not the man physically elijah but the spirit the characteristic what did the spirit of christ do through elijah where the people were worshiping bowel and going according to all these things elijah had the word of god and said come to mount carmel they had tore down the altar of god no wonder they had to have programs in their church trying to rehabilitate trying to reform people the wonder programs of psychology why the altar of the lord needed to be repaired god's not here to change our thinking he's here to turn our hearts so elijah directed by the word of god he comes upon that mountain hallelujah he takes this stone that loose in that new sin this stone he brings it together according to what the vision of the word god has already showed him remember the scripture said i have done all of this according to thy word this was not elijah walking around something's got to be done by the people or something's got to be done i don't know what's going on something's got to be done no no this was god god seen the need elijah was waiting on the lord wait on the lord you got a need in your life wait on the lord [Music] after everything went by the evening time came and when the sacrifice was laid upon the wood elijah told him go get 12 barrels of water i want you to soak this thing and there's going to be water run off on a trench is to let you see this ain't an artificial fire as a matter of fact what he did would make it impossible for fire to ignite what was wet but the supernatural god our god is a consuming fire hallelujah he came on the scene a prophet was standing there with the word and when he spoke that word elijah couldn't do it but he could stand on that word and god said i'm coming on the scene that word following in obedience to the word brought the fire obedience to the word grants you the token obedience to the word invites the fire of the word to come down it invites god to come into your life oh god oh god be merciful i tell you tonight if you're here and you don't have the holy ghost if you're listening to me on the internet or you'll stream this service i'm saying if you don't if you haven't surrendered your heart this is a time this is a time to say god i cast down my mind take me lord the sign of impending judgment do you recognize the bible says in ii peter that the spirit of the last days will come scoffers oh how long's this message been preached when was it you said brother branham passed off the scene brother branham went home to be with the lord at the end of 65 but the angel of the lord never left [Music] scoffers shall arise in the last days and say oh all things continue on just like they were but they're willfully ignorant they go on no way that's just continuing on you need to get your eyes opened i say this with love in my heart there's an impending judgment this is more than just teaching on prophets the way god has brought this to show you and i we're not walking around blindly we're walking around our eyes have been open cause we're not seeing it through the eyes of a man we're not worshiping god through the eyes of a man when somebody handed you glasses and you're looking through their glasses but god has anointed your eyes without have that you might see when judgment was upon jericho rahab said she caught those two men she said come with me the rest of the people in the city didn't think nothing different about it oh that's just ray happened but there was a different there was different motives there was different reasons she called those men she said come into my house you know why she wanted to hear what they had to say she wanted to let them know i know who you're identified with the god that has sent you here to spy out this city that judgment is coming think of the paradox i don't know if it strikes you like this but to think the paradox how then in the midst of the time shireya wasn't walking around who were all doomed oh we're all doomed we're all going to be destroyed no there was something in her heart she recognized that sign she said give me a true token i want a real peace in my heart i want a real comfort i want to know that i know that i know that i know [Applause] what was that that was a seed of god that was being awakened the sign was right among them let's say god be merciful dear jesus lord my heart is trembling lord and yet lord i'm so thankful but yet lord the trembling of it your god there's loved ones lord loved ones are mine there's brothers and sisters lord there's good people good people the lord they need the holy ghost they need the true token like lord god like you took and brought in the simplicity through brother jerry the love of god in their heart where it's not keeping and trying to keep things and walk unto the power of two masters you can't the lord i pray tonight may you just lord for those lives and those hearts move for each one lord according to their need lord i pray may you open eyes and hearts i know lord lord there's some right here in the congregation lord which i pastor but god i can't open their eyes but i know i know how you open mine i know how you changed my life so that's what i'm praying for i'm asking god for your mercy like abraham when he could see the judgment he asked for mercy god i pray from the hearts whether they're here whether they're streaming may they flee to the ark of safety may they run to you lord i pray dear lord jesus may you continue lord to reveal yourself to us lord oh how we thank you for your mercy we we feel like ruth what have i done to find favor in your eyes oh god what mercy what grace lord may there not be one the lord would be outside of this heart of safety but may god if there's hearts that are outside of it may they be so moved lord and may they flee may they flee to you may they recognize lord it's you calling may they run to you lord for in you there is safety may they ask you may they seek after you may they yield may we all continue lord to you and i pray in the name
