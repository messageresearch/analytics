but our bill is my witness sister mary brenna bill they will make sure that they do shopping for us and what i remember uh when brazil and i go to the in our shops and we come back sister merrick will ask bill did you get something for the wife bro bill would say yes he said is it enough go back go back go back oh brother when i remember all these things i thank the lord that the lord took care from this earth as a believer of this message and so no doubt we know if jesus started we are going to continue and that very day we shall see here we shall see here not in in cleveland hospital any longer which i see here not with infirmities and troubles of the body but we are going to see the real mary over there we pray that the lord will help all of us to keep the faith now when that day comes all of us will assemble so god bless you for your love for her your prayers and the help that you offered we say god bless all of you amen now we'll go back to business yes because in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god there was nothing made without the word so if you are living today on this earth without the word then you are nothing that is why we believers we eat the world we drink the weight we sleep the weight we dance the weight we do everything the work we walk the way we run the work everything we do is a way and i know that is the reason why we have gathered this evening amen so without wasting time i want us to turn our scriptures to luke chapter 4 as we be on our feet at this moment luke chapter 4 and verse 16. and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and asked his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood upon for to read and they were delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah and when he had opened the book he found a place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in that synagogue were fasting on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your years and all bear him witness and wandered at the gracious west which proceeded out of his mouth and he said it's not this joseph's son let's pray father we thank you and we bless your name that you've given us opportunity this moment to turn the pages of your scriptures to read it we pray our father that you come and put something out of it into our hearts will lift our faith to a higher ground we ask you this in jesus christ's name amen let's take our scene beloved tonight we want to look on this subject look on jesus look on jesus now when we look on jesus what do we see when we look on jesus because there are so many you know people with different kinds of ideas concerning jesus christ some take him as a religious leader some take jesus as one of the prophets some tell jesus as ordinary miraculous worker but tonight the question is when you look on jesus who do you see praise be the name of our god now this was a fulfillment of the prophecy of isaiah that the spirit of the lord is upon me because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the cutting and recovering of sight to the blind you set a liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord isaiah prophesied this down but are they jesus christ got to the synagogue and all the people were sad waiting to hear from him as he speak there were so many questions in the minds of the people concerning jesus christ already hallelujah some i mean you cannot understand even the way they thought about jesus christ and this is the question i always ask myself that if the people did not trust jesus as god made him to be why did they hunt or handle this scroll that you should read it should have some power pushed them to do that because whether they like it or not that scripture needed to be fulfilled and so in a synagogue the bible said that they handed the book to him the book of the prophet isaiah and he read that prophecy and after he read it he gave it back to them and the bible say that and all the people look on him and he declared this day this scripture is fulfilled now it brought some detention i mean among the people and uh they begin to agitate they begin to ponder they begin to ask so many questions why should this man read this scripture and tell us that it is fulfilled we know god is the messiah that has to come and do this so who is this man they look on the man according to the bible but they didn't see the messiah they look on him they didn't see that he was the one that used to come to fulfill that and they said and all bear him witness and wounded at the gracious ways which proceed out of his mouth and they said it's not this joseph's son so it means they look on him and they only saw joseph's son i remember when uh he was he was on the ass marching through to jerusalem and the women pulled palm branches and some through their clothes and they were shouting hosanna hosanna hosanna is the highest to fulfill amirah scripture there were people pharaoh seas and elderly people they went across and asked who is this they still didn't see the one that was he was but beloved tonight we want to take these few minutes to see who jesus christ is in our lives today look at the condition of the world problems here and there troubles here and there people have lost hope but will the believer lose hope no because we are not looking to the system we are not looking to the condition of the world we are looking to the one that have given us a promise hallelujah we are looking onto the one that have life we are looking on the one that can save hallelujah we are looking onto the one that can speak to the storm on the sea be silent and immediately there was calm on the waters he is the one that we are looking onto no matter what happened beloved we are the yes god amen so now he came to fulfill that scripture but they look on him and they didn't see the fulfillment of that scripture and the bible said that because there was so much math about his proclamation they had wanted to throw him into a ditch to finish him but the power of god pushed me push him out and you walk through them and he went away amen this is the people or this where the people who supposed to have studied the bible they were scholars they believed what moses told them but they believe it intellectually they didn't believe it with revelation because it is almost a revelation that will lead you to the truth not what you study not what you think you know the the word leonard people hallelujah caiaphas the rest they were all there they knew what they believed but when they looked on jesus they didn't feed their messiah oh praise the name of our lord but i remember one day that same jesus after they have insulted him after they have called him belgium after they are calling all kinds of names he went to samaria and there and then he met a woman who was at the well preparing to fetch water and jesus said woman can you give me some water to drink but the woman noticed something that jesus was not a sumerian but a jew so quickly she said but i'm a samaritan and you were a jew why do you ask me for water no we don't have things in common and jesus said well woman if you know the one standing before you if you know meaning jesus christ was calling the woman to look unto him well to ascertain who was standing before her he said if you know the one that is standing before you you would rather ask me of water and the water that i'll give to you you will not come back again to this way to draw the woman was so much shocked see who is this saying this to me then jesus christ started he said no remember you don't have a water you don't have uh what the bucket to draw or how are you going to get the water the woman was thinking about fiscal honor but jesus christ was thinking about the spiritual water oh hallelujah he said you don't want to know the bucket that i'm going to use first of all go and call me your husband the woman said well i don't have any jesus said that you are talking the truth you have six of them i'm not five of them and the one that you are still living with right now is not even your husband the woman was this man this man how can this man know my secrets how come this man know my secret he said well we know that our father jacob built this world for us and he drank from it and his cattle and his family and that's what we are drinking also from and you jews you jews say that it is only jerusalem that we should go and watch it jesus told her and i love that he's a woman a time is coming and this is the time that those who worship god will not climb the mountain hallelujah they will not go to jerusalem they will not travel to any place wherever they are they will worship god in truth and in spirit oh hallelujah and the conversation went on and while it was going on the woman was looking for something he was looking at the man who was spoken to her who might this man be hallelujah then immediately he left her bucket okay because jesus christ gave her a punch the woman said i know the messiah will come and when the messiah comes he will be the one to tell us all these things and jesus said word i am telling you the one that is standing before you right now i am wow the woman left her bucket and rushed to the town now she became an evangelist she went and called all the people he said hey people of samaria come over and see a man that i've met is this not the messiah hallelujah is this not the messiah no the pharisee intellectuals they look on jesus christ and they saw abusable you look on jesus christ and they saw an illegitimate child but the women whom they call a prostitute met jesus and she saw the messiah oh hallelujah beloved tonight when you look on jesus who do you see who do you see after all the condemnation of who jesus christ was after all the disgrace of who jesus christ was one time he was walking on the street there were a whole lot of people around around him and there was a woman also another woman also the bible said that he had infirmities 12 years he has been to one hospital to another physicians were making good use of her money because of her sickness the pharisees were around the pharisees have told their people not to go and listen to jesus christ because if they see you conforming they will excommunicate you from their synagogue but this woman when he when she got close to jesus she didn't see an illegitimate child she didn't see unbelievable but she saw the power that could set her free so the bible said that she said if only i can touch a garment or his garment i'm sorry i'll be made whole and you need this one crawl among the people and touch the hand of jesus christ garment and immediately had trouble for 12 years vanished the power of that discernment the power of that revelation pull that you out from jesus christ and jesus said someone has touched me and peter and the rest were laughing at jesus or master we know a lot of people have touched you when we're on the way and we he said peter i know a lot of people have touched me but those touches were ordinary touches but this particular touch is a touch of revelation because it has pulled a virtue out of me then the woman could not hit her feeling and her joy she owned up he said well i am the one jesus christ look at him he's a woman your faith has made you free people look on jesus and they didn't see anything but this one saw jesus and saw american worker she saw the great physician that could solve her problems and indeed jesus christ performed it today brother sister what are we seeing the whole world has become something that nobody knows what's going to happen tomorrow there is so many uncertainty there's no so much confusion there's so much disturbance that people are entertaining fear but it shouldn't be you the believer because you have a greater hope you are something that we don't have hallelujah because we are not looking to the system we are not looking to the circumstances but we are looking to the lord jesus christ he is still the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah oh brother sister today yes today you can also see something supernatural in jesus christ now the prophet says something here and i quickly want to quote it he said now some people when they look to jesus they look and see him they look at him and when they see him they see in him only a church founder i am quoting from looking unto jesus or a church organizer or maybe a creed for a church oh god of mercy that is what many people look to jesus to see he is just a new creed that was added to an old doctrine god forbid that now many people look and see him like that some look and see him as a myth santa claus or some of them look to him as some historical act that god did many years ago god forbid that some of them look to him yet as a baby in a ninja so christ is still a baby in the manger in the mind of some people hallelujah like today some people are still looking at jesus christ in their denominations oh brother is very pity christ has moved on hallelujah and they are still looking for him over there in a ninja as a baby right and they are still buying flowers to go to the uh the ninja to present it all beloved brothers and sisters we are beyond that we are beyond that he said but the question is what do you see when you look on jesus that is the question the prophet is asking all of us do you see the second person of a trinity or do you see a trinity three in one you will only see him as you look at him through the word that is what the only way you will know it because he is the word it will reveal himself depends on what you are looking for and brother says that anytime you are looking for something special in the eye of jesus christ jesus christ will provide that anything that you look unto by the name of jesus christ he will provide it and turn in memorial he has been doing the same thing at all times and one typical example is the woman that i quoted right now the woman with the infirmity he looked on jesus christ for healing and he he receive it hallelujah remember that black woman in memphis during the time of william branham the prophet when the son was sick so much and the doctors have rejected this boy to die the woman said no i will look on jesus christ and the woman looked on jesus christ and he said lord send me the elijah to my house i need elijah in my home right now send him my son is dying amen you say you think that the woman didn't know what he was doing at that moment she was not looking at anything surrounding the only hope was to look on jesus christ and you look on jesus christ and you call on jesus christ because he saw the healer he saw the problems over and once you look on him like that he said lord send the elijah right now to my home and can we imagine the fate of a woman can cause an airplane without any problem without any fault to develop force immediately for the plane to come down for service and for that matter the prophet got the chance by god god said that he was going this way and he said the voice would go that way so he turned around and went away of the voice can you imagine this brother sister and where he was going he said the voice continue to tell her go continue go ahead go ahead till he came across this woman putting her hand upon her fence from 2 30 am when she prayed that elijah should come into her house the moment she saw the prophet coming she said are you the person that the prophet said how did you get to know that i am the person he said well do you know the woman in the bible that woman who had a child in a child was dying and elijah went and prayed for the child do you know that you remember that he said yes and she told the prophet that i am that woman i am that woman my son is dying i have i have refused to to listen to what the doctors are saying because i look on them and they have failed me now i've turned around and have focused on jesus christ and i jesus bring me the elijah to my home the prophet look at the woman now the prophet understood why the voice told hey i'm sorry why the voice told him he should go that way the prophet saw where is the son he said he's in the room the prophet entered into the room he said well the room was uh so much a poor home but he saw an inscription that he laughed he said it read god bless our home and when he entered into the room this boy was groaning on his way today the boy have reached the origin of the lost there was no light only groaning and pains and the prophet told the woman let's pray together for your son they all know they prayed they said the woman prayed a prayer and you read that yes she was looking on jesus christ and after all that the prophet made a short prayer then all of a sudden the guy got up he said mama i can see light mama i can see light in the room mama i can see light in the room and that was the end the power of god descended because the woman looked on the lord jesus christ hallelujah brother today the prophet is asking you and i a question he said when we look on jesus what do we see oh my he said it depends upon what you are looking for if you look to him to argue then you are looking wrong he didn't argue it wasn't meant for him to argue remember you see him as you look at him through his word and recognize him now now you cannot see him until your eyes is open to the fact oh hallelujah you cannot see him until your eyes is open to the fact the fact that he's a messiah the fact that he's the kingsman redeemer the fact that he's our savior the fact that he's our redeemer and everything king of kings and lord of lords that is what when we look on him we see nothing disturbs our faith nothing disciple our feeling whether whatever happened to this act brother sister whatever happened to any country we don't look on that but we look on to the promise of jesus christ our lord amen now listen he said what we want to look at then if jesus has raised from the dead can we see him oh my now there is only one way to do and that is go and see what kind of a person we will look for if you are going tonight to see jesus if jesus was in this shuffle villager great if jesus was in shuffle village tonight what type of man will you look for will you go and look for some fellow that was way up in some great high cathedral with rare priestly looking clothes amen will that be the kind of jesus you were looking for god if it is he is certainly changed since he was here on earth the last time you will not see jesus christ like that for he dressed just like ordinary man he went in among men in and out among men and they didn't even know him because he looked so common like other men there was nothing in him conspicuous about the lord jesus to look at him he will do a certain thing that is the only way they will know him by his miracle and the signs that he did on the road to emmaus after his resurrection do you see it hallelujah and the prophets were talking about cleopas and his friend after all the promise that jesus christ gave to them he died of ramadan they killed him he was buried and he resurrected they teddy but there was the confusion among the people there was the confusion among his own disciples they were doubting after mary magdalene came to tell them that hey jesus christ is risen peter and john remember they run to the sepulcher because they didn't believe it they want to go and see for themselves meanwhile jesus christ told them what were they looking on them and after all this confusion cleopas and his friend were going back home and the bible said that they were talking about this issue anyway it's good to talk about jesus christ any place that you are talk about jesus christ and when you talk about jesus christ he will come around you oh hallelujah they were talking confused how can this be true well then the bible said that all of a sudden jesus christ walked with them and he asked them a question say what are you discussing and you are so much sad and and he asked me a question that i always believed that that question was so much are you a stranger in jerusalem here they could not even look on him and see who he was are you a stranger here don't you know what has happened this during the last three days there is a man called jesus who performed miracle indeed we were witnesses he died and was buried some of our companies have just come to tell us that he is risen he said oh you're fools jesus christ told them you are fools and anybody that don't look to jesus christ he's a fool anybody that looked to jesus and don't see jesus christ is a fool hallelujah jesus said it he said you're fools for not believing what the prophets have told you amen and the bible say that he picked the word and started telling them about the prophecies from time in memorial till the time that they were standing there and while they were doing that they got to the village and the bible said jesus christ pretended to continue the journey and cleopas and his friend convinced him so all master this place is dangerous it's not good for you to go just come and pass the night with us and uh tomorrow morning you can continue your journey they didn't ask him where he was going but thank god when they got that time food was ready on the table and everybody liked food don't you everybody like food you like food i like food we are always happy one food is ready so they were equally happy when the food was ready and they invited jesus christ to offer prayer before they ate and that was the sensible thing they did you know why they did that the bible says that on their way when jesus christ was speaking to them something was telling them in their soul to believe but their eyes were holding and now heard jesus christ open your eyes the bible said that he picked the food and offered prayer on the food the same old way he didn't change it and that is the reason why nobody can change the bible for us nobody can change the bible for us even the message of this hour nobody can change it the reason why god made the prophet to put this message down for us he knew that some people will come and begin to change certain things but i say nobody can change this message for us hallelujah because we are not looking to man we are looking to jesus the bible said immediately when they said amen then their eyes got opened that jesus tried to vanish from among them then clear parts of the person wow didn't our heart bend within us when he spoke to us by the way no can we imagine brah brian these same people who were telling jesus not to continue because the area was dangerous they forgot about the danger and now they themselves started running back to jerusalem with the good news that indeed the lord has risen oh hallelujah at that moment their eyes have been opened and when your eyes open you will see nothing but you see jesus christ oh praise be the name of our god brother sister i tell god that i am one of those people whose eyes are open today we know who jesus christ is when we look on jesus christ we don't see a santa claus when we look on jesus christ we don't see the world system when we look on jesus christ we don't see any person that won't film for himself but when we look at jesus christ we see the king of kings and the lord of lords when we look at jesus christ we see that kingsman redeemer when we look at jesus christ we see that great counselor when we call jesus christ we see the prince of peace when we call jesus christ we see the groom of the bride oh hallelujah when we see on jesus christ we see the great almighty god oh hallelujah amen and amen and amen that is why the world is so much confused because they don't have jesus christ the world is confused brother sister the world is so much confused and when a man come to that state when you are confused in your mind it means you are not stable in your thinking you entertain fear you don't know what is going to happen because they don't have jesus christ in realness and brother don't forget that this condition was spoken by the prophet daniel that it will come to a time that the world will come to that condition at the going down of end of time when nebuchadnezzar saw that image daniel explained and at the feet he said part was clear and pot was iron and they tried to mingle themselves with mankind meaning the system of the world tried to mingle but because clay and iron cannot mix together it could not cleave and so there was confusion and that is what is manifesting right now the world system they're various presidents the various leaders in nations they are always talking about peace they are always talking about peace they are always talking about peace but where is the peace how can you talk about peace when you don't have the prince of peace in your system it cannot be well the world can never talk on peace without having jesus christ so the confusion will continue brother i said the confusion will continue to the stone very soon is going to be cast but before that before that beloved you and i because we are looking on jesus christ will be in glory you remember when ice when they met they were talking about peace what happened confusion confusion your general assembly was an artist to do it somewhere you remember when nikita krishna removed his standards and hit it on the on the desk confusion what did they meet they were meeting to talk about peace but you can never succeed when you are not looking on jesus christ for peace you can never succeed when you talk about peace and jesus christ is not a chairman of the peace you can never succeed beloved brothers so tell the world they will not succeed because they don't have jesus christ hallelujah and recently look at what is happening over there russia attacking ukraine confusion now america don't know whether to go in to support ukraine because they are afraid that the moment they try russia perez will release chemical weapons to destroy the earth so they are careful where is the peace did somebody know that that thing was going to happen no but thank god we have something that we are looking on and the prophet did one he said after the seventh division he had a blast behind him noah and when he came to look there was no nation like america is that bad beloved brothers and sisters this is the blessed assurance he said there is no weapon chemical ballistic you can name it chemical atomic hydrogen ballistic monistic ballistic or fatalistic you can cut all the listing it will never land on this place until the blood of jesus christ is rotted that is why we don't entertain anything because we know the one that we are looking onto and that is jesus christ our savior jesus christ our healer jesus christ our redeemer jesus christ that peaceful redeemer jesus christ the group of the bride he is the one that we are looking onto brother the prophet said because of that we should look on russia he said look at the king of the north look on him watch him from that day and because we are looking on jesus christ we are watching that today if rocha we have to watch russia rochester is not sick whether he say excuse me or not we will watch it today if rachel wants to go and buy pizza from pizza hut we'll watch russia if russia go to buy ice cream we'll watch russia anything russia is doing watch russia you know why because we are looking onto the lord jesus christ amen and amen brother my sister too close let us see this thing the prophet said here he said look at cleopas and then after the resurrection jesus identified himself the way he broke that bread he did it just the way he did it before he was crucified and then that identified his characteristics because that is the way he did it now if we were here if he was here tonight how will he identify himself just like he did yesterday for his the same yesterday today and forever that is his identification hallelujah he will never change and because he doesn't change we also don't change what he has needed has to be that is what he want us to be by filling us with the holy spirit we look on him for our victory we look on him for our success we look on him for our healings we look on him for everything that we can think of the storms may raise problems they come troubles may rise but look on jesus when we look on him beloved brothers we are more than conquerors hallelujah remember on the sea when he started walking on it and the disciples saw him they said peter said lord is that you he said yes be it's me i want to walk and come and meet you he said come on come on board peter look on jesus and he started walking on the scene why did he begin to sink because he lost the focus and look around himself hey peter i'm also walking on the sea oh there you say then you shut the lord have mercy on me and send me brother he should have focus on jesus and when you focus on jesus brother without thinking about your position without thinking about who you are without thinking about your money without thinking about so much business without thinking about so many things in your life and you focus on jesus christ everything will be successful i say problems may rise but don't look to the problem look on jesus troubles may arise but long look to the troubles look to jesus sickness may arise in your body but don't look to the extent look to jesus for he is our everything he is our everything beloved brothers and sisters and tonight he will not lose focus we will achieve the aim whereby we were called to business the lord
