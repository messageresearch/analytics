to God Hallelujah certainly not a fair trade for what we've received and what he what he took from us amen and he's the only one that could do that amen and I'm just so thankful to be a living testimony of What Not only he's done but what he's doing you know when we become Memorials of God we do not become stones that are just asphyxiated in one place but we are living memorials we are not we are not images that cannot hear nor speak nor see but to think of it brother REM tells us like this over and over in the message he says that you are God's image and you are God's ye and he says it like this in the message perseverance you are God's Idol but to recognize that it's not us just in one place but it's God's life being projected through you and I amen and I'm grateful to God that you know because those that have the idols they have to pack the idol they have to set the idol up and remember it was even when they took the ark the Philistines took the ark and they put it in the uh into the house of their God Dagon and Dagon had to Bow they found him on his face amen and I'm just grateful that it's not us packing Our God around but is God packing us around amen it's God he says I would live in you and I will walk in you and and move through our lives and that's a reality isn't it it's something that becomes more and more real and more precious and you know it just we see it it's God working and even a very simple very very simple way even some of the things that his brother Steve and I were talking about today we were just giving just speaking about the just the the person of Christ right here Among Us and moving in our lives and just how the Simplicity of things sometimes that we are even unaware of and we come back to it and you realize it was God all along and it's just you know without any time to give to that but yet you recognize it in in many situations that has just been the Lord and I I just believe that that's God's desire for us that we would move in that same way because it's not that we recognize that the third pool and these things it's not us working ourselves up into something but it's actually resting that's that's the real work of the Holy Spirit that's why he comes in the services the way he does that's why he works in our life daily is to bring rest to our lives you know how it is if we're frustrated about something of course nobody in here gets frustrated I know and you get anxious about something you know you know you're no good you might as well hang it up whatever you're doing while I'm fixing this wall hang it up if you're anxious you're frustrated hanging up you're not going to get nowhere you might as well go out take a drive go get a hamburger or something you're not going to do no good right but when when we're resting then you find that there are things that begin to happen and come together even in the natural how much greater in the spiritual amen I believe that with all my heart God's bringing us more and more even to that awareness within our lives that it is truly a rest it's us as brother Ram said it's us ceasing and it's God doing and so that's the thing that I believe tonight that as we've come together that there are things that God is going to even do tonight in our lives you may not feel you may not even see but there's things that are moving because if one grain of sand is moved it's a testimony the rest of the mountains on the way so there are things God is working even when we don't see it or feel it you know we appreciate those times but even when we don't God is working amen so we just want to be under the influence tonight of that amen so good to be in the house of the Lord it's good to have brother Stephen with us and maybe brother Alex if you can uh just look back there and just let him know we're ready and uh we're just uh thankful also to have uh brother Alexander here with us tonight and uh you know he was uh he had already mentioned that uh to me he was coming up and he wanted to come up and hear uh brother Stephen and so brother Alex has been over there in Uganda and so we're just glad to have him here brother Alexander he's a good friend of ours amen he certainly means a lot to us and we just so appreciate our brother and his family and uh but brother Stephen ibali comes to us from Uganda he's it's been about four about four a year five years now since he was here and uh brother Stephen I you know I've said it like this he uh it's not like he makes a large tract around everywhere but I you know I've said it like this when I talked to other brothers I said if he even I want him to preach for me but I said even if he didn't preach for me the fellowship I'm sitting under an oak tree I'm gleaning man God knows what we have need of but the do you know the ministry there are things that I told Brother Stephen from even years and years ago in early 2000 when he was coming we were fellowshipping on the opening of the seventh seal and things we were going through and you know it's just something as you see that all parts of the body God does not have one part that just has everything exclusively but God has everything to work together and that's how God has designed it God has made it so that we are not independent but we are interdependent and that's how God established the body it's an individual work but then we are in the we are interdependent and that's so it's so precious you know and so we appreciate brother Stephen and him taking time to be with us here and he's only in the states for a few weeks and so I I'll just say it like this before he ministers if we could have arranged this better and it's on my part uh we would have liked to just done even a Thursday and Friday and then brother Erickson could have had him on Sunday because the ministry how many of you remember brother Stephen being here before okay yeah all right just a few of you and I'll say what he said remember what he told us before he says you speak American I speak English is British so we just asked God to just prepare you know sometimes our you know we our words might sound different in their words but he's the same God that he came on the day of Pentecost the miracle was not in the speaking the miracle was in the hearing and even if you can perfectly understand even as you would understand me it still takes the Holy Spirit to loosen and open our ears and that's what we want tonight is that the Holy Spirit would come and just loosen our our understanding that we might receive from God tonight so whatever today has hold and whatever you're looking at tomorrow just lay it lay it and say God I come here tonight to receive from you because when you consider it God has the answer to address whatever that you are looking at and contemplating God already has the answer for it amen and so with that as we prepare to invite brother Stephen I want to say that it's brother Alexander's birthday you know he yeah and my guess was 60. so foreign but you don't look at Dave Beyond 60 really you know brother Alexander just turned 40 so we say happy birthday brother Alexander and God bless you amen let's just let's sing that song Amen uh only believe as we turn the service here to brother Stephen and Stephen just take your Liberty brother you're at home we love you amen and just appreciate the word of God let's just open our hearts oh God [Music] all things [Music] Lord I did [Music] oh time [Music] always [Music] amen you may be seated I greet you in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ I thank God for the open door you know been here quite a few times when the senior Browning was still alive you know I've always been blessed being among your people amen um to us also nice to see brother Alexander he has been to my place so he will lead brother Samuel one of these days amen so as you had my name is Stephen I come from the eastern part of Africa and right now I want to give thanks to God because he has put the desire for the lost souls Upon Our Hearts and we are doing quite a bit of evangelism back home you know without you know ing we seem to think this message only belongs to us and our children yeah there are so many people who understand what are you doing but we are doing the best to get the Lost ship so that we get out of here so brother Alexander was asking me and I said come and see because what the Lord is doing is very hard for a man to perceive but out there people are hungry for the word they are really hungry you know they need something that they can hold on and so the Lord has given us the grace it's nothing to be proud of but it is something to thank God for amen so I appreciate brother Samuel letting me stand behind his desk here and I pray the Lord blesses him and bless the Sheep here bless his family amen so that he can be able to hold you know the fort to the coming of the Lord amen we just stand up and get into the scripture reading I turned to try to find my footing each time I come down here every preacher knows you got something put down but even how to approach it to begin with and my friend who has gone on to be with the Lord Brother Herod Hildebrandt used to say that the most difficult thing for him in the ministry is how to start and how to kill us I think brother Samia you agree with me you know how to start and how to close how to bring the thought into the minds of the people you see because once I fail on that then you are going to hear things that I'm saying but if I have the ability to give you the foundation of where I come from and where I want to go we shall be able to walk together tonight amen so just keep me in your prayers and that the Lord may speak to us we turn to the Book of Matthew chapter 20. is some bit of length reading but we shall read only the first verse and then we shall pray over the word Matthew 20 verse 1. he says for the kingdom of heaven is like can't a man that's a household which went out early in the morning to hire liberals into his Vineyard the kingdom of heaven not the kingdom of God less bad heads in order prayer precious Heavenly Father these are precious moments when your sons and daughters Lord are gathered in your presence further not for anything else but to hear your word sometimes Lord as ministers we find a difficult time to use the natural vocabulary to express Supernatural things but father I pray that you may come down give me the grace to take the word in such a way further that your children may be fed I commit the teaching of the word into your hands in Jesus name amen you may be seated so um tonight it's a privilege for me to be here as I already said but as we start getting into the word I just want to kind of follow with me because I tend to turn Junctions which I believe are very important in certain thoughts that I try to bring forth because I I don't just want to give you a fact I want to come with me and know how I get what I'm going to tell you and I trust that all of us together are so much studied in the message knowing the minister of brother Samuel that some of these things the Lord is going to just let them before us so now the scripture says for the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man that is a householder who went out early in the morning to higher liberals into his Vineyard okay so this Parable is speaking about the Kingdom of Heaven not the kingdom of God so the kingdom of God as the you know Lord Jesus already told us is within us yeah it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the Kingdom of Heaven comes by the stone cut without hands for us destroying the kingdoms of this world and when he comes he establishes a kingdom here on Earth that will be called the kingdom of heaven and he tells us each time we get into time of prayer we should always desire the coming of that Kingdom and I believe that every one of you is seeking to come out of this Dimension into that Dimension amen so he also taught us to pray daily as we just go before him and say Lord thy kingdom come amen we do not want the kingdoms of this world where the economies fail on different things and wicked men and some kind of one holy atmosphere around us you see every one of us desires to see the kingdom of heaven so now verse 2 says and when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day he sent them into his Vineyard and he went out about the third hour and so understanding I do in the marketplace you're not the word Idol in the marketplace the Lord wants us to be doing something all the time amen so an answer he didn't say that to them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right I'll give you and they went their way again he went out about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did likewise and about the 11th hour he went out and found other stunning Idol and said unto them why stand ye hear all the day Idol and they say unto him because no man has hired us he has he says unto them go also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right that shall he receive so when even was come the Lord of The Vineyard says that to his Steward call the laborers and give them their higher beginning from the last until the first amen and when they came that we hired about the 11th Hour they received Every Man a penny so you know looking at the scripture that we have gone through I want to take a subject of the 11th Hour workers the 11th Hour workers all these men were hired for a uniform pay and you know everyone received a penny for the purpose because they were hired to attend at the bright tree Amen to the Harvest and the planet that they receive is eternal life amen so this means that what matters in our calling is not the volume of work we produce but how faithful we are to what the Lord has commissioned us to do amen is not how large your church is or how small your church is but how faithful to that colleague amen and brother Branham you know encourages us and says that best church that there was in the time of Paul was the Church of references and was only 12 people you know but that was the Church of adoption it was the example church at that time so and we talk about as we talk about the calling we don't just do the calling you know by way of the 540 Ministry that the rest of them that are not in the ministry they do not have a calling upon their lives every one of us has got a purpose in the kingdom and God has a way he uses every one of us I remember brother Branham saying one thing that God can train a man for so many years only for a job that is going to do one day so now you find that all these other men who were standing Idol but you see they had the ability Amen to do what would be assigned to them so some came in the southern psalming the sixth seven some in the ninth hour but then there were those who came in the 11th Hour it seems like they got the skill only at work for one hour and then comes the kingdom of heaven okay so he says this I think we need to take this quote from the message influence he says now we find out though a good man blessed of God but if God blesses you stay in the category that God has called you in if it's a housewife remain housewife if it is a businessman in that business reflecting God and whatsoever God has called you to let it be that because he wants you to be a real housewife to reflect your influence upon another person that would want to be a good housewife if you are a good businessman let your life so be that it will reflect Jesus Christ in your business with honesty and integrity and with things that really mean something because somebody is watching your life you know we were just kind of having fellowship with brother Samuel and when you look at the armor of the Lord you see the gospel was given to the feet your feet showed with the gospel peace it was not given to the mouth actually the true gospel is the work of Our Lives so in whatsoever category you are the prophet says that you have got a responsibility Amen to shine Christ out and you are really shining him out not with the message of Luther not with the message of Wesley but the message of this hour you know that's what we need to reflect it's not just a matter of saying Jesus saves it's not a matter of just going around with Holiness I tell people that many times the thing that God desired throughout the ages is always Holiness but in the midst of Holiness there was always a message which was given amen yeah you know in the minister the Holiness there is always a message and so when we walk we don't walk the light of Luther we don't walk the light of Wesley we walk the light of this hour in the businessman or Bible teacher all a good parent whatsoever we are we are called to reflects Jesus Christ in a way to reflect him in the 11th Hour amen because somebody is watching your life you're influencing somebody God has to have the Real Housewife goddess of the real Teenage in school God has to have a real Minister a real businessman somebody that will reflect him because there they see in you Christ no matter what the rest of the world has got to do that has nothing to do with you amen so whatsoever office the Lord allows you to be in you are called and meant to be a steward of the definition of that office amen the definition of the housewife the definition as a businessman the definition as a past Minister whatsoever we are we are called to be stewards Amen to this mystery that we have been called to and then in First Corinthians chapter 4 verse 2 he says moreover is required in stewards that a man be found faithful amen a man be found faithful wherever God has blessed him so this stewardship is not monetary as we understand the stewardship sometimes but rather one's faithfulness to the mysteries of God in the area of his calling amen so he looks for faithful and wise stewards praise the Lord you're not there so wise and faithful Steward to the definition of the position in Christ where God is blessing them amen you know and he shall make them rule of his household to give their portion of meat in the season amen and in the commission the reward we praise the Lord you know it's just always the same whether you've been a you know a given five talents so you've been given two talents the reward is always the same amen there's no one going to get more or less it's always one penny and in that because God is only rewarding our faithfulness in the tellers that he has given to us he will say Well done good and faithful servant thou has been Faithful over a few things I'll make you ruler over many things that's the same thing he taught on the 105 and the same reward is given to the one of two now through the seven Church ages we have heard seven word Messengers all of them were given different assignments depending on the nature of the age where they were working amen so I want us to view these seven word Messengers as the I mean through the seven Church ages as the workers that were hired to Tender the bright tree okay because the master finds them calls them he says come and work he finds Paul he says come and walk he finds Iranians come and walk he's calling all this men and is calling them to the vineyard but then when God calls this man the mystery that He blesses in them gives them men that are going to be faithful with the message of that age so these men share of the anointing together with the messenger and the purpose is returned at the bright tree that everyone where he is you know the Lord gives him exactly the same sword of the spirit amen to guard the they mean the Bright Tree like he did give to the cherubims so our purpose the work that we walk amen should be such a way that we are careful about what we've been called to do to Tender to Divine I mean to the bright dream the prophet says Jesus said the man went out and worked and worked and another man went out in another hour and he works another man went out and worked and the one man went out at the 11th hour and when he stopped at the 11th hour he gave every one of them the same person then brother Branham brings in the thought of the seven Messengers being those men that are being called in he says Martin Luther that worked walked under Luther's dispensation and died in Grace other shouting methods you know so he goes on and goes on and goes on all these 70 men here they accorded to Tender come and work amen so when God calls us into Divine he has got a responsibility for everyone of us so when we come down here we need to say Lord what would you want me to do and when he takes you through the season of your sanctification and it takes you to the altar you need to be like Isaiah when he says whom shall I send you know you need to come out and says here I am I've received the sanctification I've been through the teaching of the one I'm ready to go he says he found them they were loitering and where I know amen so all these seven Messengers had to be faithful to the message of their season so that they could post Overcomers that would seed in the next stage are you together with me amen because he says to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the garden which means that when they labored in this age amen the reward was not enjoyed in that same age it was enjoyed in the second age that came after the age where they levered so now every Minister every messenger had to be faithful because he had to send Overcomers and this Overcomers with the remnant that were seeding the age that was going to come they become Seeds of Life amen so The Messengers were in the right hand of authority and they were drawing special anointing as privileges on return they would pass the same anointing to those who were faithful to the message of the day you know when brother Branham is talking about the Seven Stars in the right hand you should see yourself exactly in the right time because the same anointing that the messenger had when it comes down to minister it places the people into the right hand Amen brother Branham says that in patma's Vision he says and this Comfort is not to the seventh Church age Messengers only every True Believer is in the hand of God and he can grow from his love and power and receive the full benefit of all that God is to the believer what gives the messenger and How He blesses and uses the messenger is an example to all believers of his goodness and care to all members of his body that's how God has walked through the edges that in every age they've been Sons and Daughters of God who have been faithful to the message that has been given unto them and as they grow they grow towards the hardship of their their age you see what I'm talking about they grow towards the Friendship of their age and the headship could have been one of those seven spirits in Paul maybe in Iranians maybe in Martin but they always grow towards that and brother Branham says that this uh Rock Box you know has always been there it was upon every age and it was kept going up kept going up and as it was going up it was like imaginary pulling out the mature one of the earth to bring them to a level where he could be able to cap them okay now so you are not born in this light sometimes we say I wish I was in the days of Luther or if I was in the days of Wesley but this is our season amen and in this season we must fight a good fight to be faithful to the calling that God has given to us in this age amen all these seven Messengers came in their season to Tender the bright tree amen every one of them had his assignment every one of them had his message they kept away the bags amen that could come and maybe destroy the fruit eater whether you know the the leaves so you know they kept the Bright Tree watered and you know they manure the train they gave the the bright tree food induces amen because as we grow the principle of it is like the church it grows there was a message for the church and that every season and that was their food in the season amen so even we as we are growing as Christians you know the Holy Spirit knows how to provide food inducism we come to the same church and we are all under this Minister and we listen to the same message but as the holy spirit is speaking to us everybody is receiving food in his season depending at the level of maturity you see I'm a pastor back at home and after I preached and minister to the people everybody testifies different because out of it they are receiving food in their deuces it's like the same principle of the seven chair changes all of these Church changes were under one Minister and the minister was joined the apostle but you know all these seven churches there are different challenges had different victories and yet they were feeding from the same minister you see there is a way we need to be priests in the house of God that we may have the ability to access the throne amen and then God begins to feed us you know so that you know we just keep growing the same way the 70 churches just grows and then brother Branham says the same way he brings up a church age is the same way brings up individuals amen because it has to be that life growing in US the same life that kept going through the edges must take an opportunity and grow through the life of an individual so God gave these Messengers the same flaming sword which turns every way that he had given the cherubims to keep the way of the Tree of Life are you together with me so the cherubims were all around this tree and the Heart of flaming sword what were they doing they were keeping the way of the Tree of Life and yet we know the tree of life is the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen and today we know that he has been embodied in the bright body and then he gives anointed men through the seven churches and they are faithful helpers the kind of swore to keep the weight of the Tree of Life to guide The Life of Christ that you are seated in the body of the church amen so we have always received of the same anointing as brother Branham says this way he uses the messenger and the Earth is an example of his goodness towards us amen you know it's just kind of coming and tripping in here and tripping in here you see that's why all that brother Branham was supposed to do was to reveal Christ to us that what he saw we may be able to see are you together with me amen so that's why in Revelation chapter 10 amen after the seals were revealed and you know Revelation 10 7 the lutherans of the world were completely you know uh broken and the Word was no longer a mystery but the word became Christ revealed unto us when he comes down a little lower after the word has worked upon us he says go to the angel who stands on the land and the sea go to the same Source where the Prophet went because he brought the introduction of Christ was together with him amen some people think we need to keep going back to Revelation 10 7 but go to the angel the same angel that anointed Revelation 10 7 is the same angel that we need to go to because the way he used him is an example of his goodness towards us that we are also supposed to grow into the adoption because he has given us the example seed Christ in the son of magnesium amen so uh Revelation chapter 4 verse 6 amen see what I'm saying here that we have received the same anointing amen that's what the messenger has received and they kept passing them down to the faithful Believers in every age amen and so when Malachi 4 was doing his work when he was finishing out you know when he begins to sound rather amen he calls the bright body out of organization and he says come up here so John ascends Beyond Church into the region of Bride and then we know that the wedding is done here but the supper is done up there so the calling out was to help us come into an invisible Union with the headstone [Applause] so come up hither what are we coming to we are coming before a throne we are coming before our presence we are coming before the Lord Jesus Christ himself that's why we understand that he had to come down on the sunset Mountain why simply because of one thing that they had to come a union amen so he says in Revelation chapter 4 verse 6 I'm trying to piece up quite a few things and Before the Throne there was a sea of glass like counter-christa and in the midst of the throne and round above the throne where four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first Beast was like a lion and the second piece was the Leica calf and the third Beast had a faces of a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle amen so we see here that The Messengers didn't go out to watch over the bright tree with enticing words of man's Wisdom but they went into the demonstration of spirit and Power are you together with me you know and the pattern of it now is this that when the Lord was working with a particular season of The Seven Church ages he was sending a form of anointing down and we really see that when the seals were opening because somebody asked me you know that when I read the Seven Seals all I see is horse riders I said wait a minute you wouldn't see the horse rider unless there was one who was saying come and see you see because brother Branham says that Christ was the seals that was revealed but when people started the seals all that they see is arthritis but you see this is the principle of it that when the enemy comes up as a flag it is on God's Own responsibility to raise the standard so now the standard was not anointing that was among the people to make them aware even before the enemy would come and attack come and see come and see so the pattern here is that if you are Faithfully told the anointing of God to the messenger backs you up amen and this anointing is the Ford anointing through the seven churches we saw this anointing as a lion as a nox anointing and as a man anointing and as an ego anointing you know all these anointings are not literal the animals per se but they are literally using uh the kind of bees that Define the way the anointing worked in that seal you know just like a Christ would be called the Lamb of God but he was not that animal but the purpose of his coming and how he would perform his Redemption could only be compared to that lamp and then that's where Christ will be the Lamb of God so now we've been running through the seven Church edges by these four different anointings amen so Ephesus they share in the lion anointing come and see and then you're not the defense by the word against the Antichrist you know it was you know the lion of the tribe of Judah the word the king stands out in the face of his bride so the anointing of the age again of the attire was under the ox anointing okay it was the decades the light of the word had been extinguished it was Darkness the pressure of the Dark Ages was either Bend or be broken bow or die it was the Inquisition of the power of the Empire backing up a satanic worship brother Branham says and then God stepped up the anointing again at a higher level and then took the child to the anointing of a man anointing so the anointing opened by Luther 1995 reasons why Rome was wrong then declare that the judge shall live by faith and then the same anointing took an octave higher amen you know then you know the the church was able to come into the age sometimes when we speak about the age of the Flying Eagle there is a way that we really think that Pentecost was in this age too but platypus was part of the Reformation right are you together with me because that's your this year come out of 100 people the anointing of the Flying Eagle could only be in the bright age amen picked up those Force and now here we are in this last eight and we know that it has had two phases I'm trying to come up and share with oh praise the Lord amen then I get this off man oh What's Happening Here praise the Lord you see uh I want us to see that this Edge where we are it had to face the street there was a come out and then there is that going a part of the ministry oh brother Branham was the part of the calling out amen and again another part is about the going in helping us to cross the Jordan and become into our position and come into adoption it's come up either come out of our my people and I will show you things are you together with me come out of the suffered stick yeah and we come over at a higher level where specific amen didn't only have a suffered stick but he has a prophetic anointing to himself so we come up now into this kind of age let me see here what brother Branham tells us and father today we stand here by your grace and it's not because that is a special people but it's because just like the day of the lion or ox or the man is the ego time is the anointing of the hour it's the time that we are living in so is now identifies the age where the message now separates the people out of organization he is calling it the ego time the anointing of the hour is come and see come up either and I'll show you things that are going to be hereafter so he's now calling you into prophetic Edge and in 1964 then brother Branham identified this hour as the hour of the 11th Hour he says now the seventh Angels message is to open the mystery of the seals calling the 11th Hour Gentile workers to receive the same pay that's the first our workers got so we come all the way now so we come to the special time of the 11th Hour he says he so perfectly how the first our Messengers with the word with the gospel with the truth they came in at that day of Pentecost then there was a decade that blocked them out then that middle of the day Luther Wesley them came in and then there is to be an evening time message to receive the same thing that they did at the beginning so who are we here we are the 11th our workers amen we've not come in late but this is our season amen sometimes there is a feeling I wish I was there in the days before but it's more glorious now than it was there because there was the alpha but right now we've got alphanometer amen amen the two anointings is now linked up together we have the anointing of the 11th amen we shouldn't think we were born late this is our age and we need to take in the right anointing of the edge friends the reason why the people fail is when they coming down here we are in the Harvest but then the people go into the watering age okay are you together with me much as Paul listen now I'm trying to bring out this principle hope it becomes more clear much as Paul was born out of the discipleship season yet when he came he was in season he says in First Corinthians 15 4 he says and that he was buried and that he was again the third according to the scriptures and that he was seen of see first then of the twelve and that he was sinner of about 500 Brethren at once of whom the great apart remained unto this present day but some have fallen Asylum and after that he was seen of James then of all the apostles unless of all he was seen of me also as one that was born out of due time [Music] are you together with him you know because this rock box has been coming and growing together with the church like a dad such a magnetic anointing upon it that once it was hanging over the growth and the growing pyramid he had the ability to pull those that were this I mean predestinated for the next age he kept going out he kept going up when there was nothing more to pull he decided to see as a Capstone aboard the mature age amen so now let's take the prince for that the late bus we're also still in season they were just 11 hour workers for their season like you are for the entire season of the church ages amen yeah let me tell you Sarah gave birth late ER than hugger but you know by her came Isaac who was the third hair with Abraham it was not out of season amen amen however late you think oh I wish I was part of this assembly at the beginning of it you were not late amen amen you've got a part in it amen even if you came yesterday you are not late you are just coming any season God has just prepared your position and so that you may come because your position is right you talk about Rachel how the late birth but by her came Joseph who was the type of Christ are you together with me he and her were not out of season talk about Hannah give birth late but she brought forth a prophetic son Samuel the man of the season and eleventh hour amen so he comes in when the eyes of the priest were deeming and there couldn't be any better time Hallelujah God knows what season to bring you in and each time he allows you to become part of the body remember there is a special anointing that's prepared for the 11th Hour amen so God brings in Samuel at the time when Eli's eyes were dimming and the scene of the young man were so Grievous before the Lord and in that time the Bible says on the word of the Lord was so precious in those days there was no open vision huh lucky come late but he came at the right season that was his time amen that's the reason Hannah was Barren sometimes certain things happen and you start complaining Hannah is crying but God is saying your season is coming [Applause] amen Samuel had to wait for the right season and that's one reason why we are coming now it is our season we are 11 our workers we are not less [Applause] and you come down here the only thing that you should always be praying for Lord This Is My Season what would you want me to do [Music] amen praise the lord we came in now to shine our light upon this blind naked little decent Church amen just say Lord let my lamp shine I've got a responsibility to shine the light of the hour amen praise the Lord so God will never be late and whatever he does is always on time amen and that's how we should understand God every messenger came right on time praise the Lord and God always is on time we came forth in the right season and it behooves us to must be first the 11th Hour Work anointing amen not go back into the messages of sanctification amen amen you are even preaching so much about how people should be this and how people should do that and how people should have this and no this is not your season to do that our Caesar is the season of the 11th our worker come up either and I'll show you things [Applause] amen the principles that the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally do not express until each came forth in the designated season amen so this is your season To Shine the Light of Life to the world each member came forth as each member came forth brother Branham says it became expressed and took his position in the body not another man's place no sir but took his position in the body in the right season praise God so this should be known that we serve a God who works in the fullness of time he will never take you to Ali and he'll never take you in too late when the Lord calls you in that's your time that's your season and that's where your anointing is amen now Galatians 4 4 but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman under the law he could not come in the days of Jeremiah not in the days of Ezekiel but in the fullness of time he goes to the marketplace and he picks out this one and picks out Columba and picks out to Martin and picks out Wesley is as true to the seven Church ages as it is true to every one of us in a local church amen when the fullness of time is come Genesis 3 15 count the seed of the woman Ephesians 1 10 that in the disposition of the fullness of time he might gather together anyone all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on Earth even in him it's always the fullness of time he works with the fullness of time there's this famous quote here that brother Branham uses it says the time was not at hard previously in the wisdom and economy of God this might the revelation though fully known to God could not come forth it had to be the fullness of time it could not come in the times of Wesley it had to come in the eyes where we had the ability to see praise the Lord he says thus we immediately learn a principle the revelation of God for each age can come in the age only and a specific time look at the history of Israel the revelation of God Moses came only to a specific time of history and even more specifically it come as the people cried under God Jesus himself come at the fullness of time he being the complete revelation of the godhead and in this age the revelation of God will come in due time it will not falter neither will it be premature think on this and heed it well for we are in the end time today what part of the Bible are we what chapter are we we are not in Revelation chapter one brother praise the lord we are the age that is presented Before the Throne John stood out there and right there is when things started to change for John amen so stand there and watch for your season because you were raised for a purpose in this season the message I mean the season under the gift must agree are you together with me the season and the gift must agree that's why this is not luda's age the gift and the season Mustang I'll give you a little more examples when the feast turns heard that they had anointed David King over Israel all the few things came to seek David and definitely acquired of the Lord saying shall I go up to the fifth times will you deliver them to my hands God pointed him to a season not that he was not able enough then but because he works by the fullness of time God taught him and let it be when thou hears the sound of going in stops of the marble trees that thing Thou shalt be step by soul for them shall the Lord God out there before thee to Smite the host of the fields you see time limits us he is going now to pray for the people and then he gets into place he has already seen a vision is until this and this and this is in place and result they are talking and talking and talking because they are seeing a vision and when he sees this Lord is in her position and this is in that position in the fullness of time yes okay God's Victor for us works in the right season you were designated to overcome but now regardless of how dark the age has been regardless of what comes out of hell because the leads off of Hell in this age brother you are destined amen [Music] it's closed my womb God has closed my womb but God was waiting for the races because Zachary and his wife Elizabeth were both righteous before God walking in all the Commandments and ordinances of God blameless but God works in the fullness of time they had no child because the Elizabeth was buried and they were both well-stricken in the ass amen could be in their thinking they thought they would never have a child but yet before God he was waiting for the season amen so the season had to link Mary's season because John needed a virgin born son to be his message [Applause] you see the word got the wax things so we got to be children of this age through the Preakness of the word of God to bring forth a child of this age the seed child Christ this is the season of the adoption of the sons of God amen and you know that anointing is ripe to produce that you are not out of season this is your season to manifest his life that's picture of a perfect man and while we stand here we can say this day this scripture is [Applause] of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah in the Old Testament the people were living that prophecy but the season I did not come and when Jesus came he steps in the fullness of time and he says so that it shall be fulfilled that was written by light I mean uh Jeremiah the prophet so that it can be fulfilled that was spoken by a lie I mean by Isaiah because the season had come and then when we begin to see the promise of this hour and recognizing the time and by faith knowing you have been cold then that's where your purpose for the Earth is amen so we are living in the constant age the display of maturity praise God amen God is looking for sons that are going to reflect him because this is what this age requires amen and now he promised that the Mysteries that was hid in those churches would be revealed at the end of time and he lets us know now we are at the end time we are here now [Music] so when we go into the word what do we see we become students with word and then as we become students of the work line upon line line upon line the anointing keeps coming and then it strikes at a certain point and then Daniel Rises and he says this day this scriptures fulfilled seventh prayers is over we must come out of captivity in the fullness of time we begin to ask Lord what are we going to be what have we assigned for us what are we supposed to do as children of god let's go to the promise the message of the hour nobody should tell you who you should be you should go in the message of the hour discover who you are in the word of God then stand up and call for the anointing because we are living in the fullness of time Hallelujah in his coming Jesus himself come at the fullest of time amen and in this age the complete revelation of God comes in at the amen season it will not fault then there will need to be premature it comes at the amen season where all things are summing up amen where he has called the children and says this is your season I'm the amen no any other Church know any other messenger this is the amenh and I have called you to be an overcomer in this amen age and he that overcometh will like Grant to sit with me in my throne amen so in this age he's the amen the fullness of the Revelation in the fullness of time the Amen in the amen age here we are friends amen let's go through the I mean you know very well Revelation 3 14 are not at the end of the Church of the auditions right this thing says the amen the amen because we have come to the fullness of time time shall be no more the faithful the faithful because he never fails on any of his promises to the season amen and true witness true witness because he is not hiding himself behind any Shadows anymore I'm he that is true is Christ in Plainview now it's not Christ hiding behind the ministry of the son of man it is Christ's in plain view this is the season where we are so and this is what Lord this year has locked out they locked out the fullness of the godhead from the Buddha Believers so that he she could have the preeminess that's what they wanted they said I got the gold I got the wealth I have need of nothing the very seal of eternal life so the 11th Hour message the 11th Hour anointing and as we keep going people in this message don't know what they are dealing with it is the token himself that Lord this year locked out and I won't tell you that we are an octave much higher than Pentecost where the token himself becomes the amen message to every individual you must serve the ability to individually lay your hand on this message amen so let me just give you these quotes here I think I may not manage to bring the whole thing amen so now uh leodicia locked out the 11th Hour you know anointing because in this anointing is totally different it is come receive your reward I may not have the time to go into that but the season now is called them and let them receive their reward and brother Branham tells us that the reward of Naomi was a person did you get that amen that reward of Naomi was a person so what the rest of the people have walked out of it is the time of the reward and that reward is a person we come here to get United Water we were uniting with the passing of the Lord Jesus himself he has come down Among Us it's the invisible Union it's the presence of the person he's walking us back to Eden he has got us as his own Pride see I wish we had enough time to deal with this to realize the season Where We Are and the moment brother Branham says when we know who we are the Rapture will go Lord I must that will come to a point of knowing Who We Are and what season we are in less than he's good to us this evening this is the season this is the time we are not receiving portions anymore like there was a portion through the seven churchages he would come and say I am he I am here I am here but now the fullness is come down you know people seek for the perfume of the holy spirit with the Pentecostal Dimension what they are looking for is an anointing but we are far above the anointing seasons because the fullness of the person is here what we have now is the token amen amen this is our season I wish we could have got into time to know what our promises are and to know what the holy spirit is anointing for his people says call them it's reward time and they all come we are here we are in a certain presence the amen is here precious Heavenly Father Lord God some of these things we could be limited by the natural language but the way you work father is not through the intellect you've got a way how you can work these things into the hearts of the people I pray Heavenly Father that what you have spoken to us may it be hidden in the bottom of our hearts Heavenly Father that by grace the Reigns Lord God May Reign upon it the Reigns of the season to bring forth the crop for this hour father I'm committing to your children that you may bless them they've hidden this word in their hearts and I trust Lord that as you fellowship with them they will say this day this scriptures fulfilled when they see this word become alive I want to commit you my brother Sammy O Lord he has got a led by this Friday I pray father that to be constantly walk around you father dear Lord God to bring the people to their maturity we are not in the seeding time father we are in the time of the Harvest help us Lord that we may lay under the sun Lord that the seed of the word that has been planted flowered in our lives father dear Lord God may come to a concrete drying father under the August Sun that Lord as you walking to bring us to the Harvest father we shall be well aware and ripe for the Heavenly fathers bless your people I pray that you meet their needs in a special father I prayed and committed everything to your hands in Jesus name amen brother do you love him friends God bless you we are in season you know in the fullness of time [Music] it pleased the father to bring you in you couldn't come before now because you had no purpose at the time if the Lord can help us that we get the same anointing that Daniel had stepped into the understanding of what the Holy Spirit has hidden in his word it will transform Our Lives God bless you thank you for giving my Ministry an opportunity may God bless you [Applause] it's me me [Music] it is always [Music] foreign [Music] oh we're riding this [Music] is foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] God [Music] maybe one more time [Music] [Applause] [Music] go over oh lord your mind your stride I am [Music] happy thank you so much more [Music] foreign [Music] thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah hallelujah oh thank you Lord for this moment glory be to God thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah thank you Lord thank you Lord Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord thank you Jesus thank you Jesus glory be to God there's truly never been a day like this day you know when you we look in the scripture and it's the announcement and it's calling it calls to us that's what the word calls to us arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord has risen upon thee amen the messenger he received his light he shed that light and now that same light has come for you and I and that's why the scripture goes personally to us arise and shine not about what we feel like or what we think is what God's thoughts are breaking over our life and it's God's thoughts arresting our thoughts God's thoughts moving and us moving into that into that Realm to believe all things I think as we go through and we look in our lives you know you find of how brother Stephen kept on coming back to that because we can look sometimes and we can look past the Simplicity of God revealing himself in our midst and in our lives remember when brother Branham took that he many times a week just say God in Simplicity but that's not all of the title the title is God revealing himself in Simplicity and then through the same way then through our lives so it's not just something in but it becomes through and so when you we look and we we're seeing that every what God has provided for us right now everything that God has provided we and ourselves are not able in ourselves to do it but God has provided in this hour a people that that word it just will come like Abraham I'll do what you say Lord I'll do what you say and it come to finally to a place that Abraham walks up on the mountain and what Abraham could not do God did and I think of that song even Jehovah Rapha that that scripture is talking more that that of that Redemptive name is more than just about God healing our body is I'll just say it like this it's more than even God healing our soul it's God healing us of all complexes God healing us of every bruise and every Scar and everything through our life because those are all avenues that Satan would love to get into and block God's working but he's Jehovah Rapha and you know what he'll only be Jehovah Rafa to you when you have neither Jehovah Rapha and then when you have need of Jehovah Shema he will reveal himself as Jehovah Shema but it's the same God all the time it just depends on what you have need of and so it's our needs that brings the revealing of him on the scene oh my all that we have need of he's he's our moment this is our season this is a Time so I'd say just you know just just lay aside all the thoughts of that lay aside tonight I believe the word has just come to wash us to lay all of that aside that oh I wish I could have done this I wish I could have done this if we are in the season right now the past is the past and the only thing that we can do is be occupied with that of the present that'll lead us into the future amen and that's just how God works in our lives and I'm grateful he supplies what we have need of right now so that we can say in our lives this day this scripture is fulfilled amen don't you love him the uh the thing that just causes me to love the Lord even more is how simple he is it's just so simple he just work it's him working in our lives little by little by little God doesn't want to overwhelm us because we wouldn't catch it but God God does things and we catch it and he does it in such a way that we would catch it and recognize it's him and how many things you know when we I think of even some of the things when we look at it sometimes we get in a hurry don't we we're living in an age where everything is so instant I mean it's even more instinct you know if when you put something in on email if it doesn't come up that way if your website doesn't come up with it everything is so instant and yet that's not how the Holy Spirit works that's not even how the new birth works is the holy spirit working moving developing in our life where the brem said he comes in like a little white button and he spreads himself out what is it it's the same God working all the way through our lives it begins in justification same Holy Spirit working in sanctification same Holy Spirit and then into the baptism of all the same Holy Spirit same God all the time he's just like brother REM said more of him it's more of him and that's why God is working it's more of him it's more of him it's more I want more of him I want more of him I want more of him I want more of him amen do you love him tonight amen I tell you we have we have been fed tonight and the Lord has really spoke to our hearts and my just so appreciate that appreciate the gift amen and brother Stephen's life and we want to continue to remember them in prayer the brother's there and truly you've seen some of the magazines or the booklets that is put out by Cloverdale and brother Tim Dodd and a lot they're involved in that and you see that that's going on in Uganda it's a real Revival that is taking place there amen and so we just want to continue to pray for them and it's just been so good tonight you know I what I love about it is when we leave even out of the presence of the Lord here right now we're not really leaving out of his presence but as we take that word and just continue to meditate on it and I think of one of the things like the questions that was stated here tonight is to recognize we're we're here not by chance we're here by a divine plan and to say Lord what would you have me to do in this season what would you have me to do and just it's just that simple just be that simple before the Lord just to say God keep adding a line on top of line word on top a word in my life just Lord just just keep moving in me and you know the greatest thing we can do is surrender just like that allow God to keep working man let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Lord we Lord once again we find ourselves say thank you but feeling as though those words are not even adequate to describe the Thanksgiving that we have in our souls Lord it is truly a peace that passes all understanding it's a joy that the world has not given neither can the world or any test or trial of life ever take that Joy away because that Joy it's your life it's you you father you give us Grace Lord in every part of the Season that we're in Lord I pray that you would help us knowing that one of the great flaws that we have and we must overcome in our Humanity is that of impatience we like to see things quickly quickly quickly quickly quickly quickly but yet dear God as you would say in your word with patience possess you your souls patience is that virtue to wait upon God's word God has promised the word and in its season it will come to pass Joseph as a 17 year old boy went into prison and he had a promise of the word and yet not knowing what was going on while he was there in that prison and the Bible tells us Lord that the word of the Lord Tried Him until the season for it to be fulfilled so Lord the tested trials that have come our way now we know we have a sure word of Prophecy that we have received in our lives so every test every trial every part Lord right now may it bring us into that place like it brought Joseph to where Joseph came to such a place where he looked at himself as a total failure and then he could yield completely to you and as your Prophet said the gift you placed in him is the very thing you use to get him out of the situation he was in so Lord we believe that God is you working fully in our life that will bring the very change of the atoms of our body you know being the complete change Lord help us Lord not that we look down upon ourselves but that we recognize that without you we can do nothing that we're not going to move ahead of time be pushed or pulled but we are to follow you Lord knowing that God we are moved by thus saith the Lord and that Lord Your Grace would come to us as we see in the prophets meetings that even if we were to Lord it was going over our head you will call our name so that we do not miss the anointing that you have for us in this season what rest what peace what shalom oh God may you just continue to move and to work in our lives Lord we love you and we thank you and Lord like that of Hannah like that of Sarah like that of the others Lord once we have received the touch from you there is a groaning within our hearts there's a desire a longing for more of you along for the word to be fulfilled granted Lord we just want to give ourselves more to you and we want more and more and more and more of you Lord granted Lord we pray may you just continue to move Lord in every life every heart in a simple simple way because that's how you do Lord we love you father may you watch over up on the roads tonight bless brother Steve and Lord the work that is going on there and Lord in Uganda be with the Brethren Lord give them Lord the strength and the wisdom and the Direction Lord as they move Lord among Lord the people Lord and hearts are our Lord just coming Lord to see you that pearl of great price granted the Lord may you continue Lord you're working and guiding us here because there's a last one for right here as well there's a last one Lord in Uganda last one in Ghana there's a last one in every city a last one
