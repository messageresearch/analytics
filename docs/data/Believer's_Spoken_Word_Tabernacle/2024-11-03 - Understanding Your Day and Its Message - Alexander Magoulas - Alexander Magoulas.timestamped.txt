[37:48] about that
[37:49] amen amen who shall lay anything to the
[37:52] charge of God's elect it's God that
[37:55] justifies you know Paul looked at all
[37:56] that he said you know what what I'm
[37:59] persuaded amen I'm persuaded there's no
[38:01] height there's no depth there's nothing
[38:03] present nothing to go if the truth's on
[38:05] our side there's nothing that shall
[38:08] separate us from the love of God which
[38:10] is in Christ if you believe that today
[38:12] oh my you know sometimes we try to
[38:15] separate us from that but you can't do
[38:16] it any more than anybody else could amen
[38:18] there's no powers that could do that and
[38:20] we're just grateful to be here today
[38:23] knowing that if he loved us first we
[38:25] ought to love him as well you know we
[38:27] just going to come in here today maybe
[38:28] just to do a little little teaching
[38:30] little PowerPoint or something I don't
[38:31] know that there's anything wrong with
[38:32] that but man you all keyed up today I
[38:34] feel great I guess I'm going to have to
[38:37] preach we uh we sure are grateful to be
[38:40] with you God bless you um you know uh
[38:42] just say real quick here you know like I
[38:45] I appreciate all the songs I didn't tell
[38:46] you to sing any of them so but I just
[38:48] was like he's singing one of these songs
[38:50] song specials I'm like praise the Lord I
[38:52] love it when God brings a thing together
[38:54] and I just I look at the wisdom of God
[38:56] in it you know so many times in our
[38:58] lives we've looked at facts and they
[39:00] didn't they didn't add up they didn't
[39:02] look like there was a way out and you
[39:04] know I'm a little older than I was
[39:05] before I'm not as old as some of you but
[39:07] you know as as time goes on and I mean
[39:09] this from the bottom of my heart you
[39:10] know I look at my trials differently
[39:13] than I used to I look at the situations
[39:16] I go through differently than I used to
[39:18] because I used to see the problem but
[39:20] then now I see God
[39:22] working in the answer I don't see just
[39:26] another problem or triy to overcome but
[39:28] I see the possibility of another
[39:30] testimony of God's grace and things that
[39:32] used to I look at him and bother me I
[39:35] look at them different the the situ we
[39:38] we still have trials we've got problems
[39:39] we're always going to have them but I
[39:41] look at them different and they they
[39:43] encourage me so much more amen so I pray
[39:47] today maybe something be said not just
[39:49] to help you in your trial but maybe to
[39:51] look at it differently you know that God
[39:53] is doing something in our lives I just
[39:55] ask you to maybe bow your heads with me
[39:56] for a moment as we
[39:58] pray Lord that's the truth that you're
[40:01] on our side you've never left us you've
[40:05] never forsaken us Lord so many times we
[40:08] look at our own life our own inability
[40:10] our own
[40:12] insecurity we disqualify oursel from the
[40:15] blessing of God we we think it's so far
[40:17] away but Lord if we had confidence in
[40:20] our own flesh Lord you wouldn't you want
[40:22] one to move in that or you couldn't be
[40:24] glorified in that Lord the the many
[40:26] things we look at in our lives and
[40:27] disqualify ourselves with so often is
[40:30] the very evidence that that we're your
[40:32] children that you want to bless us that
[40:34] you want to use your people and and to
[40:36] dwell in our midst today Lord we we have
[40:38] nothing to offer you and that's exactly
[40:40] what you wanted oh God you wanted a
[40:42] people that needed you we acknowledge
[40:44] today we thank you as we stand here I
[40:46] myself as I stand in this Pulpit I
[40:48] acknowledge today my need for you to
[40:50] come and to help these people Lord how
[40:53] we would love to just be a help to one
[40:54] another and we can do that but what
[40:57] different thing it is when you come and
[40:59] you Veil yourself in human flesh like
[41:02] that little boy looking for a mom
[41:04] looking for his mama god with skin on it
[41:06] just something we could reach out and
[41:08] touch in the the time of Trials the time
[41:10] of trouble Lord we want to we want to be
[41:13] that today we want to be a vessel that
[41:15] could be used for your glory Lord that
[41:18] you could come and not just speak a
[41:21] bunch of facts and rehears verses today
[41:23] from this Bible but but that the truth
[41:25] be magnified cuz that's the only thing
[41:28] that's going to set us free today is the
[41:30] truth the truth shall set us free and
[41:34] Lord whether we're in a prison like Paul
[41:36] and
[41:36] Silas yet there's liberty for the sons
[41:40] of God today not because of what where
[41:42] we're living at but because of what
[41:44] you've said and what you've declared I
[41:46] pray today you come now bless the
[41:47] reading of this word the ministering
[41:49] thereof and may you just help the
[41:51] different needs may you undertake for
[41:53] your children and most of all Lord may
[41:55] you receive all the praise and the glory
[41:57] and the honor for we thank you for it
[41:58] now bless the reading of your word we
[42:00] ask in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God
[42:03] bless you we uh just invite you to turn
[42:05] with us this morning to Daniel the 9th
[42:08] chapter you know talking about trials
[42:11] and things like that you know one of the
[42:12] things going through things makes you do
[42:15] is it makes you appreciate real brothers
[42:17] and sisters in Christ born so I just uh
[42:20] we just want to say we love each one of
[42:21] you today we're just I'm just so happy
[42:23] to be with you amen I I could be in a
[42:25] prison somewhere or a ditch or something
[42:27] not that you're the only alternative to
[42:29] that but um just we just we're just such
[42:31] a blessed people amen I I just really
[42:34] feel that way today and I hope you do
[42:36] too and uh what a what a blessing what a
[42:40] what a thing to think about what God's
[42:41] done in our life uh Daniel the 9th
[42:43] chapter um for the sake of time we're
[42:45] not going to read the whole thing here
[42:46] but I do have several verses I want to
[42:48] look at uh in Daniel the 9th chapter and
[42:51] we'll just start in the first verse and
[42:52] the scripture says this it says in the
[42:54] first year of Darius the son of aus of
[42:57] the seed of the mes which was made King
[43:00] over the realm of the Chans in the first
[43:03] year of his Reign I Daniel understood by
[43:05] books the number of the years whereof
[43:08] the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah
[43:10] the prophet that he would accomplish 70
[43:12] years in the desolations of Jerusalem so
[43:15] to qualify this first verse
[43:17] Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians have
[43:18] been in charge then the Ms and purches
[43:20] come in and they bring a new
[43:21] Administration in no that's not me
[43:23] speaking about the election I'm just
[43:24] making a
[43:26] point brother Alex said that's not what
[43:28] I'm getting at I'm just making a point
[43:29] here so now they've changed Reigns
[43:32] they've changed uh leaderships and in
[43:34] this time he's praying he's seeking
[43:36] understanding he knows he's understood
[43:38] by the books of Jeremiah that these 70
[43:39] years would be accomplished verse three
[43:41] and I set my face unto the Lord God to
[43:43] seek my prayer and supplications with
[43:46] fasting and sackcloth and
[43:48] Ashes and I prayed unto the Lord my God
[43:51] and made my confession and said oh Lord
[43:53] the great and Dreadful God keeping the
[43:56] Covenant and mercy to them that love him
[43:58] and to them that keep his Commandments
[44:01] we have sinned and have committed
[44:03] iniquity and have done wickedly and have
[44:06] rebelled even by departing from thy
[44:09] precepts and from thy judgments neither
[44:12] have we hearken unto thy servants the
[44:15] prophets which spake in thy name to our
[44:17] Kings our princes and our fathers and to
[44:20] all the people of the land oh Lord
[44:24] righteousness belongeth unto thee but
[44:26] unto us
[44:27] confusion of faces as at this day to the
[44:31] men of Judah and to the inhabitants of
[44:33] Jerusalem and unto all Israel that are
[44:35] near and that are far off through all
[44:38] the countries whether thou Hast driven
[44:39] them because of their trespass that they
[44:42] have trespassed against thee now for the
[44:45] sake of time I just uh go down to the
[44:47] 20th verse here but he continues praying
[44:49] in this manner basically repenting for
[44:52] the sins of the people and it we you
[44:54] know he acknowledges that God has always
[44:56] been faith faithful and the people find
[44:58] themselves in this captivity this
[45:00] trouble because of their own
[45:01] transgression they were warned many
[45:03] times amen well that's about how I came
[45:05] to the Lord amen I didn't come because
[45:07] he called me the first or the second
[45:08] time I don't know how many times he
[45:10] called me but he got to hold me praise
[45:11] God Amen I'm so grateful for that notice
[45:14] here so he's praying and he's asking God
[45:17] to come and intercede and I want to
[45:19] direct your attention to this 20th verse
[45:21] he says while I was speaking and praying
[45:23] and confessing my sin and the sin of my
[45:26] people Israel and presenting my
[45:28] supplication before the Lord my God for
[45:31] the Holy Mountain of my God yay whil I
[45:34] was speaking in prayer even the man
[45:37] Gabriel whom I had seen in the vision at
[45:39] the beginning being caused to fly
[45:42] swiftly touched me about the time of the
[45:45] evening oblation praise the Lord for
[45:47] that and he informed me and talked with
[45:49] me and said oh Daniel I am now come
[45:53] forth to give thee skill and
[45:56] understanding
[45:57] at the beginning of thy supplications
[45:59] the Commandment came forth and I am come
[46:01] to show thee for thou art greatly
[46:04] beloved therefore understand the matter
[46:08] and consider the vision may the Lord
[46:11] bless the reading of his word you may be
[46:14] seated I'd like to take a thought you
[46:16] know brother BR preaches a sermon about
[46:18] recognizing your day and its message and
[46:21] I think it's significant because he's
[46:23] reading the words of Jeremiah and he
[46:25] recognizes his day and his message he
[46:26] understand understands where he's at he
[46:27] looks as oh it's been 70 years and
[46:30] recognizing that does not cause him what
[46:33] it does it cause him to go into prayer
[46:35] to seek a greater understanding so I'd
[46:37] like to take a thought today uh that
[46:39] ties into the idea of recognizing your
[46:41] day's message I'd like to speak on the
[46:43] idea of understanding your day and its
[46:46] message amen and I think that's
[46:48] important uh you know before I get
[46:50] started here you know I had a brother
[46:51] taught me recently I won't mention who
[46:52] or what but you know we we're talking
[46:54] about the idea this is a free country
[46:55] and you know this is election time of
[46:57] course and I'm not here to tell you my
[46:58] political views but you know some of you
[47:00] know people some sometimes they say well
[47:02] you know you you ought to be able to
[47:04] share what you want and this and that
[47:05] and it's funny because people feel that
[47:07] way till you share an opinion that
[47:09] doesn't match theirs know it's like free
[47:11] speech we believe in free speech till
[47:13] somebody says something we don't like
[47:15] and it's like for free speech to mean
[47:17] anything it has to work when you don't
[47:20] like it not just when you do but anyway
[47:22] so I'm not getting political today but I
[47:24] I make this point you know uh I was
[47:26] talking this here a while back to a
[47:27] brother and I got to studying this and
[47:29] you know you look back in 1962 The
[47:31] Prophet's still alive at this time and
[47:33] our Supreme Court in 1962 they made a
[47:35] ruling that that schools could no longer
[47:37] sanction or promote prayer in schools
[47:39] and it was interesting to me because
[47:40] even just the other day over in England
[47:43] now if you pray silently now think about
[47:46] this if you pray it's not even speech
[47:48] it's just it's thought crime if you pray
[47:51] silently near an abortion clinic and you
[47:53] confess to the idea that you pray
[47:54] silently that's a crime and I'm thinking
[47:57] well how do you police
[47:59] that amen we're we're literally at the
[48:02] thought crime level now here's where
[48:03] we're at praise the Lord so you look at
[48:05] England you look at our country and they
[48:07] outlaw this idea of prayer uh School
[48:10] sanctioning in 1962 and it's interesting
[48:12] we don't have prayer in school anymore
[48:14] we've got underage pregnancy We've Got
[48:16] Drugs we've got guns we've got all kinds
[48:18] of violence we've got bullying we've got
[48:20] you gender changes you can go to the
[48:22] counselor and get your gender changed
[48:24] but praise God not praise God but God we
[48:27] we don't have prayer in school and we
[48:28] look at the condition of our country
[48:30] today amen and and and know I've heard
[48:33] that for years listen they kick prayer
[48:34] out or schools and all this stuff come
[48:35] in and well that's true but I want you
[48:38] to think about this amen they didn't
[48:39] kick prayer out of your home they didn't
[48:42] stop you from going to church they
[48:44] didn't stop you from praying in your car
[48:46] amen uh and we can look at that
[48:49] situation say our country is no better
[48:50] off than it was today but they didn't
[48:52] stop you like I guess yet maybe they
[48:54] will someday from praying in your home
[48:56] like they did with Daniel for example
[48:58] amen and what I'm trying to build to
[49:00] this is you look at England you look at
[49:01] our country the problem is not that the
[49:03] law is adverse to us praying because
[49:07] they weren't allowed to pray in the Book
[49:08] of Daniel and they did it anyway the
[49:10] problem is not that we got rid of Prayer
[49:11] in school the problem is that we live in
[49:14] a culture that would get to such a place
[49:17] in the first place amen you hear what
[49:19] I'm saying our country forsook God a
[49:22] long time before they kick pray out of
[49:23] school right amen that's just a symptom
[49:26] of them not looking towards a lack of
[49:28] Prayer in school is just one of the many
[49:30] indicators of our condition today and we
[49:32] can look at politics say look how
[49:34] corrupt politics is today well I'm sorry
[49:36] to break it to you this way politics has
[49:38] always been corrupt it might be worse
[49:41] now it might be more noticeable now but
[49:43] it's not like every politician ever was
[49:45] just this great upstanding individual am
[49:47] me we we've had Trails of Tears and
[49:49] we've had scandals we've had stuff for
[49:52] hundreds of years in this country amen
[49:54] and outside of America I mean politics
[49:56] is always been filthy it might be worse
[49:59] now like I said so the this what I'm
[50:01] getting at the problem in our country
[50:03] today is that the people got away from
[50:05] the Lord and they exchanged that for
[50:08] politics and fashion and pop culture
[50:11] amen our country used to be primarily
[50:14] influenced by the religious institutions
[50:17] For Better or Worse amen the church was
[50:19] the primary influence in this country at
[50:21] one point but no longer is the church
[50:23] the primary influence on our culture
[50:26] rather the culture is the primary
[50:28] influence in most
[50:30] churches amen your denominational groups
[50:33] they'll get together once a year they'll
[50:35] have a National Convention and they'll
[50:37] decide what they want to introduce to
[50:39] the church what they'll allow what
[50:40] they'll not allow and when they're
[50:42] making that decision they're not
[50:43] Consulting the Lord like Daniel they're
[50:45] not going to prayer and seeking the face
[50:47] of God what would please the Lord they
[50:49] look at the culture say well this is
[50:51] what this church does this is what this
[50:53] guy's preaching this is what this group
[50:55] allows and we don't want to lose L this
[50:57] this this subsect or this demographic of
[50:59] people so we're going to alter what we
[51:01] preach we're going to alter what we
[51:03] allow we're going to alter what we
[51:05] believe to please our culture and God is
[51:07] not the god of those churches their
[51:09] culture is the god of those churches
[51:11] because they're make and you know it's
[51:12] funny to me they they always they always
[51:14] they always let up the standard amen
[51:17] they never double down and say you know
[51:19] what we got away from god let's go the
[51:21] other way it's always well let's allow
[51:23] this let's let this come in and they're
[51:26] getting further and further away from
[51:28] God all the time
[51:30] amen so that's why I say you don't blame
[51:33] the Supreme Court don't blame whoever
[51:35] wins this election amen because somebody
[51:37] will blame one side or somebody blame
[51:39] the don't blame politics don't blame the
[51:41] Republicans don't blame Democrats don't
[51:44] blame all this other stuff blame weak
[51:46] pulpits blame churches that drop the
[51:49] standard when God give them a word they
[51:52] have a word and rather than take the
[51:54] word and preach the word they preach
[51:56] their understanding of it they preached
[51:58] their interpretation they told you what
[52:00] they think it means well when Paul said
[52:02] a woman shouldn't preach he didn't mean
[52:04] that that was just them no Paul meant
[52:06] what he
[52:07] said amen when Paul said there's not
[52:09] three Gods there's one Lord One Faith
[52:12] one baptism he meant what he
[52:14] said and Men changed it because they
[52:18] were the influence here and our churches
[52:20] churches looked at the culture they
[52:22] looked at sin they looked at these
[52:24] things coming in and in their mind the
[52:26] solution was let's compromise let's give
[52:29] up a little bit let's just give a little
[52:31] bit of this hour but as soon as you do
[52:33] that with the word you've lost
[52:36] everything this is the serpent when he
[52:38] challenged Eve in the garden when he
[52:40] comes to her he just he didn't he didn't
[52:42] say listen listen God's a big phony he's
[52:45] a big liar he doesn't have any power he
[52:48] doesn't mean what he says he didn't do
[52:50] that he just challenged one word and
[52:52] when he challenge listen as soon as
[52:54] you're willing to see one word amen
[52:57] right well I believe at 99.99 but I
[52:59] don't know about this listen you're in a
[53:01] dangerous place because it's 99% today
[53:05] but it be 98% tomorrow and you look at
[53:07] our culture today where it used to be
[53:10] what happened somebody let the bar is
[53:13] down we don't know where the Sheep are
[53:15] but we don't know how the goats got in
[53:18] either
[53:19] amen well glory to God blame weak
[53:23] pulpits blame sell out preachers like
[53:26] bam that are more worried about a
[53:28] political position than the word of the
[53:33] lord well praise Lord there's your
[53:34] answer amen our country it's just like
[53:37] Israel just like Judah they've received
[53:39] warning after warning think about this
[53:41] United States what a privilege it
[53:44] received something most countries that
[53:45] are not Israel have received they've
[53:48] received the visitation of a Vindicated
[53:51] prophet and yet just like Israel of old
[53:54] they rejected it they rejected the
[53:56] gospel they rejected the counsel of God
[53:59] for fashion for politics for
[54:03] money praise the
[54:06] Lord for every one man of God that stood
[54:08] against the darkness there's 450
[54:10] prophets of bail that are go out there
[54:12] and they'll tell you they'll preach it
[54:13] the way you like it right they'll say it
[54:15] the way you like it if you can't find it
[54:17] the way you like it there's one down the
[54:19] street that you can find amen now we can
[54:20] get online look it up it's just like a
[54:22] dating app that's what we do churches
[54:24] well I'll find some church that I like
[54:26] how the preacher says it a couple
[54:27] services and I'll go there for a little
[54:29] bit and I'll go down here and I'll go
[54:31] here and we'll get all up listen I'm not
[54:34] tell you not to to move what I'm saying
[54:36] is we'll make that guy the problem we'll
[54:39] say this church is the problem or this
[54:40] group's the problem we're the problem
[54:43] most of the time we're the problem I
[54:46] don't like how they do it and I don't
[54:47] like this and I don't like what do you
[54:50] like what you should like is the will of
[54:52] the
[54:53] lord well praise the Lord amen
[54:57] oh we don't have prayer in schools
[54:58] anymore you know what people should have
[55:00] done oh praise the Lord now I'm going to
[55:02] go here now you know what we should have
[55:03] done in this country these people they
[55:05] they they kick prayer out of school so
[55:07] we got mad and we'll go out and we'll go
[55:09] to political this and we'll go to school
[55:12] council meetings not against that that's
[55:15] fine praise the Lord nobody think I'm
[55:17] getting this is time we went to the
[55:18] school last week and they're like oh man
[55:19] he's getting on me no that's fine if you
[55:22] want to go to school counseling that's
[55:23] fine but all these people they did this
[55:25] they went went out and campaign they
[55:27] went to school board meetings they got
[55:28] involved in this amen and do all this
[55:30] other stuff but they never got down like
[55:33] Daniel and just prayed about it we'll
[55:36] spend more time telling everybody what
[55:38] we think about it than talking to God
[55:40] and saying what's God think about
[55:42] it amen well Hallelujah somebody amen
[55:45] we'll show up for this rally we'll go to
[55:47] this meeting what we need and we won't
[55:48] show up for prayer meeting but we'll
[55:50] show up to a political rally Oh Glory to
[55:52] God oh here we are somebody we'll do
[55:55] this we'll we'll listen to this guy
[55:56] thinks about and what this guy thinks
[55:57] and that's all good and fine but did we
[55:59] listen to what a Vindicated Prophet said
[56:01] about it do we listen to what the Bible
[56:02] said about it
[56:06] amen see instead of turning to the Lord
[56:08] as a nation we turn to politics to try
[56:10] to fix it y well politics is what
[56:13] created the problem because it wasn't
[56:15] submitted to God and listen if you're
[56:18] not submitted to God you're just a
[56:20] oneman politician you're just a oneman
[56:23] denomination it's no different well they
[56:26] don't believe this and this listen if if
[56:28] we leave off one thing we're not doing
[56:29] anything different it's the same origin
[56:31] y well praise the Lord like I said what
[56:35] we what we should as Believers as a
[56:37] nation what we should have done is we
[56:39] should have turned to the Lord amen
[56:41] that's not I'm just going to I'm going
[56:42] to give you the spoilers here that's not
[56:43] what denomination did in
[56:44] 1956 amen when they saw this stuff going
[56:47] on 1962 denomination did not turn to the
[56:49] Lord they said we're going to push our
[56:51] agenda and we'll fund this to fix it
[56:54] well the problem is they're really not
[56:55] doing anything different than your
[56:56] church is doing you're mixing politics
[56:59] and pop culture and man's ideas it's the
[57:02] same origin the same thing amen but
[57:05] here's Daniel think about this Daniel
[57:07] one man so well nobody else want to pray
[57:10] about it Daniel didn't have a support
[57:11] group he didn't have a Facebook page
[57:14] come on somebody he didn't have a church
[57:16] to go to he didn't even have a
[57:19] pastor but Daniel saw this going on he
[57:22] got down he read the Bible he's reading
[57:25] Jeremiah's scripture and when he
[57:27] understood where he was at you know what
[57:28] he did he went home and he prayed as he
[57:31] had always done
[57:33] before and Daniel one man a man that
[57:36] wasn't even alive 70 years ago when this
[57:38] happened begin to cry out God we've
[57:41] sinned we fell short we didn't listen to
[57:44] your voice we should have hearkened you
[57:47] warned us you told us and we refused to
[57:50] listen and now we're in this situation
[57:53] we put ourselves here hallelujah but
[57:56] even now Lord I believe there's Mercy
[57:59] even now Lord though your mer though
[58:01] your anger is for a moment your mercy
[58:03] ures
[58:06] forever notice Daniel's not going out
[58:08] telling all the other Jews listen you
[58:09] need to get right about God you need to
[58:11] make this right you need to get right
[58:12] with God he's looking at himself Lord
[58:16] me well they don't feel the same way I
[58:18] do about well pray with them they don't
[58:20] have to know you're praying with them
[58:22] right that's what Daniel did he's
[58:23] praying with a whole nation that do
[58:26] largely in captivity they're not even
[58:28] seeing what he's seeing and he's praying
[58:31] interceding for the nation
[58:33] [Music]
[58:35] right praise the Lord amen that's why
[58:38] I'm not so concerned about who gets
[58:39] elected this November because you know
[58:41] what happens no matter who gets elected
[58:43] the heart of this people has waxed
[58:47] gross amen no matter who they vote in
[58:50] the heart of the people is in darkness
[58:52] right the vote's not going to change
[58:54] that right might lower your taxes or
[58:57] something hey that's cool that's fine
[58:59] but the heart of our nation is polluted
[59:02] it's filthy it's defiled and there's no
[59:06] desire for repentance that's right
[59:10] amen amen their heart is waxed gross and
[59:15] their ears are dull of hearing and we
[59:19] find ourselves this why I Prophet said I
[59:20] don't even pray for the nation anymore
[59:22] and I'm not saying that to pray for your
[59:23] officials or whatever he doesn't pray
[59:24] for the nation why because we're living
[59:26] in a time of judgment it's already been
[59:30] declared that's no different than Daniel
[59:31] praying for Babylon hey Lord save B
[59:34] babylon's already done for it's already
[59:37] over Babylon the handwriting was already
[59:39] on the wall Babylon wasn't destroyed the
[59:42] day the me and perses came in when that
[59:44] handwriting showed up on the wall it was
[59:48] over right true so we are living in a
[59:52] time of judgment right in a casual look
[59:55] at the world today would probably inform
[59:57] you of that if you didn't have the
[59:58] scripture to tell you that already but
[1:00:00] I'm saying this for a reason I want to
[1:00:01] remind you of this today God has always
[1:00:02] had a people yes amen there's Seasons
[1:00:05] where the people of God that lived under
[1:00:07] blessing and Revival and a whole nation
[1:00:10] was a part of that like in the days of
[1:00:12] Solomon but there's also times like this
[1:00:13] where God's people lived in a time of
[1:00:15] judgment God's prophets frequently come
[1:00:18] and live in a time of judgment amen and
[1:00:21] listen when when when you I I want to
[1:00:23] use this example for a second you know
[1:00:24] when David becomes king in Israel all
[1:00:26] these different tribes gathered together
[1:00:27] I like the scripture it's in 1
[1:00:28] Chronicles chapter 12 all these Elders
[1:00:31] they get together from the different
[1:00:32] tribes to anoint Daniel as the new king
[1:00:34] because he takes over and the men of
[1:00:36] issachar I like this I think this is a
[1:00:38] good good place to be in light of the
[1:00:40] things that are coming on in this
[1:00:41] country the men of issachar come
[1:00:43] together and they also sanction David as
[1:00:46] king and they bless him and the
[1:00:47] scripture says this the men of issachar
[1:00:49] they were men that had understanding of
[1:00:52] the times to know what Israel ought to
[1:00:55] do right
[1:00:56] so if you want to know what you ought to
[1:00:58] do you have to understand the time
[1:01:00] you're living not just recognize but
[1:01:02] understand the time that you're living I
[1:01:04] sure like that Amen to understand our
[1:01:06] Dan message amen it's vital for us today
[1:01:08] to understand where we're living and
[1:01:10] because it's it's vital not just to
[1:01:12] recognize where we're at but what to do
[1:01:14] with it listen you could talk to all
[1:01:16] kinds of listen the average person if
[1:01:19] you ask him in our country how they feel
[1:01:21] about the direction of our country on
[1:01:22] both sides they don't feel good about it
[1:01:25] right that's just just the obvious part
[1:01:27] but nobody knows what to do about it
[1:01:29] because they're looking to fix it
[1:01:31] politically but there's no political
[1:01:33] answer the answer is the coming of the
[1:01:35] Lord the answer is the ushering in of
[1:01:37] the
[1:01:38] Millennium praise the Lord
[1:01:42] hallelujah the book The Bible tells us
[1:01:43] in the book of Ephesians the fifth
[1:01:45] chapter to redeem the time right because
[1:01:48] the days are evil can I get a witness
[1:01:51] redeem because the days are evil redeem
[1:01:54] the time in other words make the right
[1:01:55] use of the time it says wherefore be not
[1:01:59] unwise but
[1:02:01] understanding what the will of the Lord
[1:02:04] is so when you understand the will Lord
[1:02:06] you can redeem the time because we can
[1:02:08] spend our time doing lots of things
[1:02:11] trying to make things better and it's
[1:02:13] not doing a
[1:02:14] thing amen listen Daniel understood in
[1:02:17] this ninth chapter he understood by
[1:02:20] books that Jeremiah said there's 70
[1:02:22] years of captivity for the people and
[1:02:24] God opens his understanding and I love
[1:02:27] this it strikes me just just me
[1:02:29] personally even the fact that you know
[1:02:31] Daniel he understands where he's at he
[1:02:34] he sees his Dan's message and Daniel
[1:02:36] could have done a lot of things with
[1:02:36] that he could have started his own
[1:02:37] church he could have got a little
[1:02:39] following he could have went around and
[1:02:40] told his neighbors hey I know more than
[1:02:41] you I've got a better doctor than you
[1:02:43] I'm smarter than you I'm seeing
[1:02:45] something he could have done all those
[1:02:46] things but I love when Daniel has an
[1:02:49] understanding and he sees what day he's
[1:02:50] living in it causes him to pray amen
[1:02:54] right right now you might sit there say
[1:02:57] what's E A pray he already understands
[1:02:59] that but he doesn't understand why
[1:03:02] that's significant see lots of people
[1:03:05] understand that God sent a prophet the
[1:03:06] devil knows that but what does that mean
[1:03:09] today amen because it means different
[1:03:11] things for different people amen so
[1:03:14] here's Daniel and I love this it's a
[1:03:15] real compliment he's a he's a man with
[1:03:17] an excellent Spirit the Bible said
[1:03:19] wouldn't you like that there's a man
[1:03:21] with an there's a sister with an
[1:03:22] excellent spirit amen he turns to God in
[1:03:24] prayer and he sees what's going on and
[1:03:27] yet he cries out to God great and
[1:03:29] Dreadful God you keep your Covenant
[1:03:31] you've showed Mercy but we've sinned we
[1:03:34] didn't listen to the voice of your
[1:03:35] prophets please turn your anger from us
[1:03:37] cause your face to shine upon your Des
[1:03:39] your Sanctuary which is desolate amen
[1:03:42] now he's not living at the beginning of
[1:03:45] judgment he's living at the end of it I
[1:03:49] firmly would believe we're living in a
[1:03:50] time that next year maybe I don't know
[1:03:52] when it could be 50 years could be 100
[1:03:54] years could be 5 minutes there's there's
[1:03:57] a three and 1 half year period called
[1:03:59] the Great Tribulation that's to strike
[1:04:01] the face of the Earth judgment after
[1:04:03] judgment striking and listen that
[1:04:05] doesn't have to be far off amen That
[1:04:07] Could Happen by December I believe we're
[1:04:10] not living at the beginning but that
[1:04:11] we're we're literally coming into the
[1:04:13] end of the L Church age we're entering
[1:04:15] into a season of great judgment amen
[1:04:18] this nation's already under judgment the
[1:04:20] the world's already under judgment amen
[1:04:22] this is not a new thing this is where
[1:04:25] we've been amen some of us were born in
[1:04:28] that and that's all we've ever known
[1:04:30] like Daniel So Daniel looks he's at the
[1:04:32] end of
[1:04:33] judgment he sees God's getting ready to
[1:04:35] bring him out of captivity amen and he
[1:04:38] says but what does the Lord want to show
[1:04:40] me with this because listen when God
[1:04:41] shows us things like this message when
[1:04:44] he shows us things in our lives and he
[1:04:46] he opens our understanding to things
[1:04:47] he's not just doing it so we can say
[1:04:49] that we're smarter than everybody else
[1:04:51] and put it on social media and tell
[1:04:53] everybody at church I'm smarter than you
[1:04:56] amen that's not why he's doing it but
[1:04:58] he's showing us because there's
[1:04:59] something God wants us to do with his
[1:05:02] will he wants us to redeem the time so
[1:05:05] we we don't want to just be busy we want
[1:05:08] to be busy doing the will of God not
[1:05:11] what we think the will of God is what
[1:05:12] we've guessed that the will of God is or
[1:05:14] what we were told by some interpreter
[1:05:16] that the will of God is amen so he goes
[1:05:20] and he pray you say what's the point of
[1:05:21] praying if he knows because he wants a
[1:05:23] greater understanding God desires that
[1:05:25] men everywhere would pray lifting up
[1:05:28] holy
[1:05:29] hands he's looking for somebody he can
[1:05:32] show something to so as we see the day
[1:05:35] approaching we acknowledge our Lord's
[1:05:37] soon coming and what does the Bible say
[1:05:39] watch under prayer Watch and Pray amen
[1:05:43] knowing that he's coming shouldn't make
[1:05:44] us pray less it should make us pray more
[1:05:48] like it did Daniel Amen even so come
[1:05:51] quickly Lord Jesus listen I've say this
[1:05:53] today we can we live in a time of
[1:05:55] judgment we're not
[1:05:57] powerless amen well listen I don't have
[1:05:59] a super pack and I don't have a lot of
[1:06:01] cloud and I don't have a lot of
[1:06:02] influence and I'm not an influencer and
[1:06:04] I don't have money that doesn't mean
[1:06:05] you're
[1:06:07] powerless actually there's you're
[1:06:09] probably the only people that actually
[1:06:10] have actual power amen because listen
[1:06:13] every you you and I we cannot change the
[1:06:15] broken system today we cannot change the
[1:06:18] the broken things in the world today but
[1:06:20] we have received a kingdom which can't
[1:06:22] be
[1:06:23] removed you can't save every Nation but
[1:06:26] yet God Will Save a people out of every
[1:06:28] Kinder tongue and Nation right amen so
[1:06:31] there is something to do amen but it's
[1:06:33] not trying to fix what the devil has
[1:06:36] built well glory to
[1:06:39] God see this is what I'm I want you
[1:06:42] understand Daniel is living in a time of
[1:06:43] judgment much like ourselves he's living
[1:06:45] in a time of judgment but that doesn't
[1:06:47] mean he had to live under judgment right
[1:06:50] right amen he might not have had a
[1:06:53] pastor he might not had a church but he
[1:06:55] had an understanding Spirit y amen he
[1:06:58] had prophecy he had inter inter
[1:07:00] interpretations God had delivered him
[1:07:02] from the mouths of lions right now I
[1:07:04] want you to think about this we're
[1:07:06] talking about administrations and things
[1:07:07] now again I'm not making any predictions
[1:07:08] but it's interesting because the
[1:07:10] Babylonians as we mentioned a moment ago
[1:07:12] they are judged by God and I want you I
[1:07:15] want you to think about this image you
[1:07:16] know here comes the Ms and Persians they
[1:07:18] bust through the gates of Babylon they
[1:07:20] come into the court of the king they
[1:07:22] come into all these places and they wipe
[1:07:24] out it's a blood bath literal blood bath
[1:07:26] they go and they wipe out they wipe out
[1:07:28] counselors and princes and kings and all
[1:07:30] this stuff and yet here's Daniel
[1:07:32] Daniel's in the midst of this judgment
[1:07:34] but he doesn't get destroyed he actually
[1:07:36] gets
[1:07:39] promoted amen the changing of the time
[1:07:42] the changing of the leadership did not
[1:07:44] destroy Daniel it put him in a better
[1:07:47] position you see what I'm talking about
[1:07:49] the Judgment of God on the world doesn't
[1:07:52] mean judgment on your house that's why
[1:07:54] you've got a token
[1:07:56] I'll say one thing about this country I
[1:07:59] don't know which way the election's
[1:08:00] going to go but I guarantee you we're
[1:08:01] going to be closer to the coming of the
[1:08:04] Lord after it's all over than we ever
[1:08:06] been before and that's the only thing
[1:08:08] I'm worried
[1:08:09] about you know I I did mention I said
[1:08:12] something brother briyan about this a
[1:08:13] day or two ago I said you know brother B
[1:08:15] talks about how he voted for Jesus he
[1:08:16] had an election I I I said you know
[1:08:18] what's really amazing it's not so much
[1:08:19] that I voted for him he voted for
[1:08:23] me listen matter who the popular C the
[1:08:27] popular vote elects in this country God
[1:08:30] elected you before the foundation of the
[1:08:33] world to ret to obtain salvation that's
[1:08:36] the only one I'm really worried about
[1:08:38] cuz listen that might not put a bunch of
[1:08:40] money in my pocket but it'll get me out
[1:08:42] of
[1:08:43] here it'll get you out of here cuz no
[1:08:47] matter what this world's falling apart
[1:08:49] but our Kingdom's rising
[1:08:51] up oh glory to God Amen Hallelujah
[1:08:55] amen thank you Lord Daniel I love it he
[1:08:59] comes out smelling like
[1:09:01] roses worked out for
[1:09:03] him amen judgment's coming but the
[1:09:07] Judgment that was coming on a nation of
[1:09:09] Babylon was the very same thing that was
[1:09:12] Deliverance oh my that's the very thing
[1:09:15] that delivered God's people out of
[1:09:18] Babylon and put them back in their
[1:09:20] Homeland the very Judgment of God
[1:09:22] against one nation was the Deliverance
[1:09:24] of God's people listen God didn't send
[1:09:26] judgment to judge you he sent judgment
[1:09:28] for our deliverance cuz the whole world
[1:09:31] it grows it's travailing it's waiting
[1:09:34] for something let me tell you what it's
[1:09:36] waiting for it's waiting for
[1:09:38] you it's waiting for me it's waiting for
[1:09:41] it's waiting for the manifestation of
[1:09:43] the sons of God and how is there going
[1:09:45] to be a manifestation of the sons of God
[1:09:48] without the word to bring a
[1:09:50] manifestation this Vindicated word
[1:09:52] brings a manifestation of the sons of
[1:09:54] God which brings Christ back on the
[1:09:56] scene because the heavens have retained
[1:09:58] him but the time is coming and is now
[1:10:01] when he shall return and there's a
[1:10:03] people they're not going to say well
[1:10:05] listen I got to wait around and see how
[1:10:06] this turns out down here no they're
[1:10:08] receiving a new a new nation a new
[1:10:09] kingdom coming back to the Earth it's a
[1:10:12] new order
[1:10:13] amen so the judgments on this world it's
[1:10:16] creating it's a stirring the
[1:10:18] nest amen man I don't like how things
[1:10:20] are going good good I'm glad you don't
[1:10:22] like it cuz the eagle stir in the nest
[1:10:25] he wants you to get your eyes on the
[1:10:27] idea of getting out of here not staying
[1:10:31] here oh my praise the Lord praise the
[1:10:36] Lord amen listen the same judgment that
[1:10:39] destroyed the ancient world saved eight
[1:10:43] Souls that's what the Bible says it
[1:10:45] destroyed the anti- deluvian world but
[1:10:48] it saved eight Souls right you ever
[1:10:51] think about that what what would have
[1:10:52] been the fate of Noah and his family in
[1:10:55] a world where the people's imaginations
[1:10:59] were continually
[1:11:01] Wicked I don't know what that looks like
[1:11:03] for them but it's it's probably some out
[1:11:04] of a horror movie or something listen
[1:11:07] the the the their options are dwindling
[1:11:09] all the time there's no good Fellowship
[1:11:12] there's no one after God well we're
[1:11:14] talking about our day your n your your
[1:11:16] options are getting lower all the time
[1:11:18] so when the when God judges these people
[1:11:21] a people that would have destroyed
[1:11:23] themselves by their technology their own
[1:11:25] thinking God delivers eight Souls saving
[1:11:29] the whole Human
[1:11:31] Race So judgment on one group is
[1:11:36] Deliverance for another
[1:11:39] group see you look at judgment it looks
[1:11:41] bad but when you understand it's to
[1:11:43] bring a people out right that changes
[1:11:46] your direction it changes the way you
[1:11:48] look at it amen I used this example here
[1:11:51] I think a while back but you look at
[1:11:54] Joshua I love this story when Joshua
[1:11:57] brings the people to the promised land
[1:12:00] and they come to the Jordan River
[1:12:01] they're at the Jordan River and all his
[1:12:03] priests and all his advisers say listen
[1:12:05] this is not the time to cross over
[1:12:08] because it's it's the rivers overflowed
[1:12:11] the water's too high look at the
[1:12:13] circumstances Joshua this is not a good
[1:12:15] time but see Joshua look at the
[1:12:20] circumstances the Bible says the river
[1:12:22] of Jordan always overflows its banks in
[1:12:25] the Harvest Time
[1:12:27] right Joshua said yeah but look at what
[1:12:30] season we're in glory see as Christians
[1:12:33] we're not called to look at the
[1:12:34] circumstances we're called to look at
[1:12:36] the season that we're in amen yeah the
[1:12:39] circumstances say this is not a good
[1:12:41] time for a Crossing but the season says
[1:12:43] this is the best time for a Crossing cuz
[1:12:46] when we cross over there there's houses
[1:12:48] there's Vineyards there's lands there's
[1:12:50] a harvest and it's all for us
[1:12:55] so the season declares this is the
[1:12:58] perfect
[1:12:59] time see circumstances say look at our
[1:13:02] nation look at England look at the world
[1:13:05] this is the worst time for a Rapture
[1:13:07] there's nobody wants to serve God
[1:13:08] there's nobody after God but the season
[1:13:11] declares the season declares this is the
[1:13:14] perfect time this is the hour because
[1:13:18] the word has gone forth It's giv
[1:13:20] rapturing Faith it's giv rapturing grace
[1:13:22] to the church this is the perfect time
[1:13:25] [Music]
[1:13:28] oh my praise the
[1:13:30] Lord see if we cross over now Joshua
[1:13:34] said we not lack for food
[1:13:36] ever my God help us to understand our
[1:13:40] season today amen don't look at the
[1:13:42] circumstances don't look at what's
[1:13:44] reported look at the season God told how
[1:13:47] do I know this season the same way
[1:13:49] Daniel did God showed you what it is
[1:13:51] through the
[1:13:52] word I use this example a while back you
[1:13:55] know well praise the Lord I got to watch
[1:13:57] where I go with this I'll never get done
[1:13:58] but there's this guy from India he' come
[1:14:00] over to the states cuz my girls were
[1:14:01] wanting to I talk about this idea to get
[1:14:03] a pilot's license and you can be like 14
[1:14:05] and learn how to fly and this and that
[1:14:07] my girls let me know I failed them as a
[1:14:09] daddy because they don't know how to fly
[1:14:10] yet
[1:14:11] but this guy from India had come over to
[1:14:14] the states and he was going to get his
[1:14:15] pilot license and go back to India and
[1:14:18] fly commercial airliners and and in his
[1:14:20] mind he thought he was going to make
[1:14:21] half a million dollars a year doing it
[1:14:22] I'm like listen the type of training
[1:14:24] you're looking to get is not the type of
[1:14:25] training that's going to fly several
[1:14:27] hundred people on a jet over the
[1:14:29] Atlantic right you flying a prop plane
[1:14:32] is not the same as flying a an airliner
[1:14:34] amen and I made this point What's the
[1:14:35] difference between that guy and the guy
[1:14:38] that flies to 747 the difference is this
[1:14:41] guy learned how to fly by sight he looks
[1:14:43] out the window he sees clouds he sees an
[1:14:45] Airfield and that's how he flies that's
[1:14:47] how he takes off that's how he lands but
[1:14:48] that guy that knows how to fly he
[1:14:50] doesn't have to look out the window one
[1:14:52] time he's got instruments in his P
[1:14:55] he's got Communications from the from
[1:14:58] his home base amen and it doesn't matter
[1:15:00] what the clouds look like what the
[1:15:02] turbulence is he's not looking by sight
[1:15:04] at the conditions he's looking at his
[1:15:07] instruments he's instrument rated it's
[1:15:09] called amen if you're in the military
[1:15:10] instrument rated in other words he
[1:15:12] doesn't fly based on what he sees the
[1:15:14] conditions are his entire way of flying
[1:15:16] is dictated by what the instruments tell
[1:15:18] him amen and listen you and I we don't
[1:15:20] see spiritual things with our natural
[1:15:22] eyes but we've got instrumentation
[1:15:25] amen we go to headquarters in heaven the
[1:15:27] word declares our season it doesn't
[1:15:30] matter what it looks like outside what
[1:15:33] matters is what the word has declared
[1:15:34] about you and I the doctors can look at
[1:15:37] your situation and they can put AR
[1:15:39] listen in my training in my experience
[1:15:42] there's no solution for you but we've
[1:15:44] got a second
[1:15:45] opinion we've got a great position and
[1:15:48] he says not only can you be well I've
[1:15:52] got good news with his stripes you're
[1:15:54] already already
[1:15:57] healed so your decision making is based
[1:16:00] on what information you're looking at
[1:16:03] don't look with your eyes we don't walk
[1:16:05] by sight we walk by
[1:16:09] faith and every time we try to walk by
[1:16:11] sight that's where we get discouraged
[1:16:14] that's where we stumble that's where we
[1:16:15] have problems don't look outside the
[1:16:18] window look at the
[1:16:23] word praise the Lord
[1:16:27] what you think about this Daniel he sees
[1:16:28] that captivity is coming to an
[1:16:31] end God's people captivity for 70
[1:16:34] years and Gabriel comes now listen this
[1:16:37] is not his first visitation from
[1:16:38] Gabriel Gabriel comes say I've come to
[1:16:40] give you skill and understanding I want
[1:16:42] you to consider the vision what's the
[1:16:45] vision about what's the message telling
[1:16:49] us what is it trying to declare to us
[1:16:51] amen and this is the thing he he gains
[1:16:54] an understanding in through God's angel
[1:16:57] amen 70 years of judgment have ended but
[1:17:00] now God is going to bring on 70 weeks 70
[1:17:02] prophetic weeks 490 years and these 70
[1:17:05] weeks they have a purpose and it's not
[1:17:08] just hey you're going to do this for 70
[1:17:09] years and then go back into judgment but
[1:17:11] there's a reason he shows this to Daniel
[1:17:14] he shows him that in the midst of the
[1:17:16] very last week amen or at the at the
[1:17:19] beginning of the last week 483 483 years
[1:17:22] later the beginning of the 70th week of
[1:17:24] Daniel Messiah the prince is going to
[1:17:27] come Amen in other words Daniel the
[1:17:29] reason I'm bringing you out of captivity
[1:17:31] the reason I'm taking the people here is
[1:17:33] because I want to bring in the Messiah I
[1:17:36] want to bring in the one that's going to
[1:17:37] rule the Nations amen amen and this this
[1:17:40] one is going to be cut off in the midst
[1:17:42] of the weeks so this why I'm saying it's
[1:17:43] one thing to know that we're living in a
[1:17:45] time of judgment it's even another thing
[1:17:47] to recognize that we're in a time of the
[1:17:50] Deliverance of God's people but why what
[1:17:52] is the purpose well the purpose purp for
[1:17:55] Daniel was to usher in the
[1:17:58] Messiah amen other words I'm not just
[1:18:00] looking to go on a Rapture to not be in
[1:18:03] judgment but I'm going in a Rapture
[1:18:05] because I'm part of a kingdom which is
[1:18:07] coming back to rule and Reign on the
[1:18:08] earth amen it's it's not about me it's
[1:18:11] not about you it's about Christ and you
[1:18:14] in Christ you understand now the change
[1:18:17] of leadership is to bring in this one
[1:18:20] and that's why 483 years later
[1:18:25] when Messiah is born those Jews aren't
[1:18:28] even looking for him that's right right
[1:18:32] they've got no idea and these wise men
[1:18:36] these Heathen Pagan wise men from Persia
[1:18:40] show up with gifts and they walk in
[1:18:42] there where is he that's born King of
[1:18:44] the Jews probably thought there'd be a
[1:18:46] banner up and little streamers and you
[1:18:48] know their GPS didn't work so where's he
[1:18:50] at and all these Jews are like our King
[1:18:53] I don't know where they at yeah so
[1:18:55] they're like well let's go look in the
[1:18:57] Bible Well if they had been done doing
[1:18:58] that in the first place they wouldn't be
[1:18:59] where they were at right right they
[1:19:02] looked in the scripture in the first
[1:19:03] place they would have to figure out
[1:19:04] where he was going to be at well they
[1:19:05] look at the scripture well he's supposed
[1:19:06] to be here he's supposed to be there and
[1:19:08] I want you to think about this these
[1:19:11] Jews these religious
[1:19:14] people amen when a
[1:19:16] star when this Angelic messenger appears
[1:19:20] and declares the Messiah is among them
[1:19:23] they don't even Rec they wer even
[1:19:25] looking for it and yet there's these
[1:19:28] Persian wise men they were looking for
[1:19:31] it brother said they were looking for it
[1:19:32] because they expected it why do they
[1:19:35] expect it because Daniel 483 years prior
[1:19:40] had been praying one
[1:19:42] day and when he was praying God said I'm
[1:19:45] going to send him at this time get ready
[1:19:49] make Provisions cuz even if you're not
[1:19:52] here it's going to happen so I want you
[1:19:54] to prepare for the changing of the
[1:19:56] season I don't want you to have to get
[1:19:58] ready when the time comes I want them to
[1:20:00] be ready when the time
[1:20:03] comes so oh my so Daniel is not only
[1:20:06] prepared for the changing of one season
[1:20:08] but
[1:20:09] two he's not just looking for them going
[1:20:11] back to promis land he's looking clear
[1:20:13] forward to the coming
[1:20:16] Messiah amen glory praise the Lord
[1:20:19] listen you take a farmer we we we have
[1:20:23] four seasons we used to in Ohio
[1:20:25] sometimes I question think we got seven
[1:20:27] or eight or two or it depends on the
[1:20:30] year but generally speaking we've got
[1:20:33] four seasons amen listen if you're
[1:20:35] looking to plant sey beans you're
[1:20:38] probably not going out and doing it
[1:20:39] right now amen there's a certain season
[1:20:42] you're going to do it in now you have no
[1:20:44] evidence of how the weather is going to
[1:20:46] look six weeks after you plant or 12
[1:20:48] weeks after that amen but you know the
[1:20:50] season goes a certain way there's you
[1:20:52] might be in Spring but there's going to
[1:20:54] be a summer sum and there's going to be
[1:20:55] an a harvest time in the fall so you
[1:20:58] plant according to the season because
[1:21:00] you have an expectation and Daniel is in
[1:21:03] captivity but yet he begins to plant a
[1:21:06] word for men not just in Deliverance but
[1:21:09] two seasons later these men come because
[1:21:13] one man saw the day that he lived in he
[1:21:17] saw his message and he laid out a word
[1:21:20] for his people to be prepared I believe
[1:21:22] we've had the same thing in this day the
[1:21:25] message is here for us to not be
[1:21:28] unaware we are prepared not just for
[1:21:32] where we're at now but for what's
[1:21:35] coming huj my my I'm saying this for a
[1:21:39] reason seasons change amen amen you
[1:21:42] might look at your home maybe look at
[1:21:43] church your job whatever and you look at
[1:21:45] the situation man it doesn't look very
[1:21:47] good right now yeah but the season can
[1:21:49] change amen don't look at the
[1:21:51] circumstance well the economy is
[1:21:52] terrible but what is God say about it
[1:21:55] God says I own the cattle on a thousand
[1:21:57] hills I can create jobs the American
[1:22:00] government can't create for
[1:22:01] you I can create opportunities that no
[1:22:04] politician can create for you amen God
[1:22:07] is not looking at the numbers on the
[1:22:09] chart he's looking at what he has
[1:22:14] said amen let me exhort you don't look
[1:22:17] at your circumstance oh listen my my
[1:22:19] kids this and my home this and that look
[1:22:21] at the season you're in yeah but this is
[1:22:23] the season where all things are
[1:22:26] possible this is the season where God
[1:22:28] can do anything this is a time when the
[1:22:31] Lord is coming this is the time when
[1:22:32] missing limbs can be restored this is
[1:22:34] the greatest hour that there's ever been
[1:22:37] for the Church of the Living
[1:22:39] God don't look at circumstances look at
[1:22:42] the season amen now that's going to
[1:22:44] require you to pray like Daniel Prayed
[1:22:47] it doesn't do me any good just to tell
[1:22:48] you you've got to see it for yourself
[1:22:52] amen that's where people get discouraged
[1:22:55] well I prayed about it
[1:22:58] once you know Daniel the F this is not
[1:23:00] his first encounter with Gabriel you
[1:23:02] know the first time he prayed he was
[1:23:04] waiting for Gabriel he prayed 21 days
[1:23:06] right some of us can't wait 21 minutes
[1:23:09] for an answer from God this guy he
[1:23:12] prayed and he waited for 21 days and
[1:23:14] Gabriel shows up says listen God heard
[1:23:16] you the first day right listen it's not
[1:23:18] that God doesn't hear your prayers God
[1:23:20] just has a way of answering in his time
[1:23:27] amen well Hallelujah God has a way of
[1:23:30] doing things and his ways are unfailing
[1:23:32] Amen brother B says it this way God
[1:23:34] loves to test his people yes he does now
[1:23:37] we don't love
[1:23:39] that we love it when it's somebody else
[1:23:42] and then they tell us afterwards and
[1:23:44] they get up Church give a testimony
[1:23:45] praise God what a great testimony well
[1:23:47] they weren't thinking that when they
[1:23:49] went through
[1:23:50] it you weren't thinking that when you
[1:23:52] went through it no
[1:23:54] oh my God loves it like I hate
[1:23:57] it I don't want to be
[1:24:02] tested Lord today I have overcome all
[1:24:06] things the truth is I'm an overcomer I'm
[1:24:09] more than a conqueror Lord I I need some
[1:24:11] more trials no one in
[1:24:14] here if I was a Batman which I'm not
[1:24:17] because gambling's a
[1:24:18] vice I would bet a million dollars
[1:24:21] nobody here prayed for their trial God s
[1:24:24] in my way bring it up no nobody did that
[1:24:27] right right God loves to test his people
[1:24:33] why oh my my why does God love to test
[1:24:35] his people cuz he knows something about
[1:24:38] you he knows you don't know about
[1:24:43] you God sees things about you you don't
[1:24:46] see you wouldn't see it till the trial's
[1:24:49] over you're like oh wow I didn't think
[1:24:51] I'd make it yeah but God Made A Way
[1:24:55] see God loves to test his people CU he
[1:24:58] knows this he proves things in our life
[1:25:00] like he did with Daniel Amen he's got
[1:25:03] listen God is never early nor is he ever
[1:25:05] late

[1:25:24] strange most strange sometimes that God
[1:25:27] does things that way you know we have
[1:25:29] confessed our sins we've met every
[1:25:31] requirement that God requires we
[1:25:33] believed on God there's a circumstance
[1:25:36] that has to be met it's according to his
[1:25:38] will and we've confessed our sins we've
[1:25:40] made all the wrongs that we did right
[1:25:42] done everything we know how to do every
[1:25:46] requirement that God has made our ask
[1:25:47] we've met that requirement and yet he
[1:25:51] lays silent

[1:32:30] that cake and she found out the cruise
[1:32:32] never did run dry the barrel never did
[1:32:35] run

[1:32:38] Vindicated Prophet cuz there was a
[1:32:40] commandment over her life even when she
[1:32:43] didn't realize there was a commandment
[1:32:45] over her life the Commandment of God
[1:32:47] fulfilled God's will
[1:32:50] hallah you say I got children they're
[1:32:53] out there they're doing whatever seems
[1:32:55] like no improvement but there's a
[1:32:57] commandment over their life whether they
[1:33:00] realize it or not listen I'm going
[1:33:02] through the darkest trial my life I
[1:33:04] don't know how I'm going to make but
[1:33:05] there's a command it over your
[1:33:09] life
[1:33:11] Hallelujah be certain of
[1:33:14] God praise God what did Jesus say put
[1:33:17] first the king of
[1:33:18] God and his
[1:33:20] righteousness all these things will be
[1:33:23] that's what she did right you know I'm
[1:33:25] going to put God first right I haven't
[1:33:27] heard I don't know I don't know what I'm
[1:33:28] going to do but I know this I'm going to
[1:33:31] put God
[1:33:34] first I'll seek God's kingdom first I'll
[1:33:37] seek his righteousness and
[1:33:39] he so that's something we have to be
[1:33:42] actively engaged in seeking the kingdom
[1:33:46] not waiting for it to fall into our
[1:33:49] lap he's seeking like Daniel seeking all
[1:33:52] right Lord what do you have for all
[1:33:54] right Lord what's what is this about
[1:33:57] amen that's what Daniel was doing he was
[1:33:59] seeking amen when things are dark and
[1:34:01] desperate and you don't have an answer
[1:34:04] yet you're seeking God that's not the
[1:34:06] time to get discouraged that's the time
[1:34:08] to draw closer to him than you've ever
[1:34:11] been
[1:34:11] before bless the Lord and he might take
[1:34:14] you down to the very wire doing
[1:34:16] that he did that
[1:34:18] woman done it many times in the
[1:34:20] scripture amen I submit to you this
[1:34:24] this
[1:34:26] afternoon many times when our faith is
[1:34:29] tested and we get anxious we're tempted
[1:34:32] to doubt it's not our faith that's the
[1:34:34] problem that's what the devil said well
[1:34:36] you just don't have faith you don't
[1:34:37] believe well listen Daniel didn't hear
[1:34:39] for 21 days it wasn't a faith problem
[1:34:43] amen Faith should never be if if we're
[1:34:46] hearing the word of the Lord then
[1:34:48] Faith's not the issue because that's how
[1:34:49] faith comes by hearing the word of God
[1:34:51] Amen many Christians they think they're
[1:34:54] weak in faith maybe you get discouraged
[1:34:56] well maybe I'm just weak in faith that's
[1:34:58] not that we're weak in faith many times
[1:35:00] it's that we lack
[1:35:03] patience right many of the times our
[1:35:06] issue is not a lack of faith it's just a
[1:35:08] lack of
[1:35:09] patience well God I want to see an
[1:35:12] answer listen to God a day is like a
[1:35:15] thousand years a thousand years like a
[1:35:18] day he's not sweating
[1:35:21] it he's not sitting there I don't know
[1:35:24] how they're going to make
[1:35:26] it I don't know what they're going to do
[1:35:28] if this
[1:35:29] happens he's not the one worried about
[1:35:32] it he has long patience for the fruit of
[1:35:36] the
[1:35:36] Earth right see we just don't have
[1:35:40] patience and we think it's a lack of
[1:35:42] faith no you just be patient amen amen
[1:35:46] it's
[1:35:47] God patience requires you to operate
[1:35:49] without visible evidence like the farmer
[1:35:51] sometime amen well man I planted this
[1:35:54] three days ago I don't see
[1:35:55] anything it's cuz it doesn't come up
[1:35:57] that fast right the issue is not the
[1:36:01] seed the issue is quit and getting
[1:36:03] worried about it right just water it and
[1:36:07] let it grow it'll get there listen if if
[1:36:12] if you didn't believe that nobody would
[1:36:15] Farm nobody would do it well if I don't
[1:36:18] see something the first three days no
[1:36:20] one quits their job farming because of
[1:36:22] that they know if you wait long enough
[1:36:25] it will
[1:36:26] happen and listen his word is like a
[1:36:28] seed it will not go forth void it shall
[1:36:33] accomplish that which pleases him it
[1:36:36] will prosper in the thing where unto he
[1:36:38] sent it there is no word of God that is
[1:36:42] void of
[1:36:44] power there is no seed of God that will
[1:36:47] not bring forth after its own
[1:36:50] kind if you leave it planted if you
[1:36:53] water it
[1:36:55] amen the scripture tells through faith
[1:36:57] and patience we inherit the promises
[1:37:00] amen it's like I was saying at the
[1:37:02] beginning of the service so much so much
[1:37:03] of our Lives it's not it's not about
[1:37:05] what is or isn't it's our
[1:37:09] perspective you can look at this
[1:37:10] situation be like man I've waited a few
[1:37:13] days nothing's happening God must not
[1:37:16] care or man I haven't seen happen yet it
[1:37:19] must be a good one yeah this is going to
[1:37:22] be a good one when it finally happens oh
[1:37:25] it's going to be the testimony of
[1:37:27] testimonies man this is going to be big
[1:37:31] news
[1:37:32] Hallelujah wow they said Christ said he
[1:37:35] was coming quickly that's 2,000 years

[1:37:41] be what a day it's going to be when it

[1:38:02] on the living is not but overall it's
[1:38:05] getting bigger all the time it's all how
[1:38:08] you look at
[1:38:10] it brother man was over in Germany one
[1:38:13] time and he saw this painting he said it
[1:38:16] was some sort of award or something like
[1:38:18] that he said the picture it's a bunch of
[1:38:20] dark gloomy clouds just looks ominous
[1:38:23] spooky looks scary this angry storm
[1:38:25] comeing to tear things up said but you
[1:38:27] know when you get closer when you look
[1:38:29] at a little bit closer say it's not
[1:38:30] angry storm clouds it's the angels of
[1:38:33] God their wings are beating touching one
[1:38:35] another and they're crying out holy
[1:38:37] Hallelujah they're worshiping God see
[1:38:40] the picture was the same but when you
[1:38:43] look a little bit closer it's not scary
[1:38:46] it's the worship of God it's rejoicing
[1:38:50] it's the Praises of God and I was I was
[1:38:53] talking about this said you know when I
[1:38:54] got married my wife brought something
[1:38:56] into the mar she brought a lot of things

[1:41:55] see Daniel saw his day and he knew what
[1:41:57] God wanted done with him cuz he
[1:41:59] understood amen yeah this is the time
[1:42:03] that spoken of the book of Hebrews when
[1:42:05] not only heaven and but Heaven and Earth
[1:42:08] they're both being shaken right but we
[1:42:11] have received a kingdom which cannot be
[1:42:13] removed
[1:42:15] therefore knowing that it's falling
[1:42:17] apart but knowing we're not therefore
[1:42:20] let us have Grace
[1:42:24] that we may serve God
[1:42:29] acceptably I love how Paul says this in
[1:42:31] first first Thessalonians the 5th
[1:42:35] chapter he says but over the times and
[1:42:37] the seasons Brethren see times and
[1:42:39] Seasons you have no need that I write

[1:46:02] the message is not just a word from the
[1:46:04] Lord It's the word in
[1:46:07] season amen Isaiah 50:4 says the Lord
[1:46:11] God ha given me the tongue of the learn
[1:46:13] that I should know how to speak a word
[1:46:14] in season to him that is
[1:46:18] weary amen listen we live in an hour
[1:46:20] where the love of many is waxed cold we
[1:46:23] see that in our politics we see that in
[1:46:24] our country we see it in the world Amen
[1:46:26] the love of men is waxed cold there are

[1:46:54] testimony there beginning service amen
[1:46:56] listen that that's I I love that amen
[1:46:59] people they reached out they said
[1:47:01] something we don't realize I think many
[1:47:04] times
[1:47:05] true amen oh Hallelujah listen I've had
[1:47:08] the privilege of preaching in many
[1:47:10] different places and many different time
[1:47:11] zones and and I've seen God do all kinds
[1:47:14] of things but some of the most
[1:47:16] miraculous things I've ever seen is me
[1:47:18] or maybe one of you somebody they go up
[1:47:20] and they say somebody maybe just a
[1:47:21] sister making something a meal to a
[1:47:23] church something or whatever Hey sister
[1:47:25] I just want you to know I always see you
[1:47:26] doing that and I really appreciate it it
[1:47:28] means a lot to me and that'll stick with
[1:47:30] them y a lot longer than the sermon that
[1:47:34] they just
[1:47:35] heard cuz nobody ever says anything nice
[1:47:38] to
[1:47:40] them that one kind word I've had people
[1:47:43] come at me you know brother you said
[1:47:44] this thing to me one day and it meant
[1:47:45] the world I don't remember saying
[1:47:49] it yeah I'm in somebody well hope
[1:47:51] hopefully hopefully people can relate to
[1:47:53] that right hopefully it's not always
[1:47:55] just harsh things we had to say right
[1:47:58] right amen listen we underestimate the
[1:48:02] power of a Kind word that's right right
[1:48:05] you say I don't what's this got to do
[1:48:06] with being Supernatural this and that
[1:48:07] because a word spoken in weird to a
[1:48:09] weary person in season is a blessing
[1:48:12] amen it's a good thing in a society in a
[1:48:15] culture in churches well we just don't
[1:48:18] do that anymore we're just
[1:48:20] indifferent True Praise the Lord
[1:48:23] well
[1:48:24] Hallelujah you know we we want to see
[1:48:26] all this Supernatural and God's going to
[1:48:29] speak well here we are you know we want
[1:48:31] to see these gifts and we want to see
[1:48:32] them operate and do this and a lot of
[1:48:34] times the reason a person wants it is
[1:48:36] they want to dress up their opinion as
[1:48:38] the will of
[1:48:40] God Amen Hallelujah somebody praise the
[1:48:43] Lord but the prophet says this say if
[1:48:45] you have perfect love you'd have perfect
[1:48:48] gifts he said I'd rather have a church
[1:48:50] that know one spiritual Supernatural
[1:48:51] thing but they have the love of God Amen
[1:48:55] cuz that'll bring gifts it'll bring
[1:48:57] manifestation it'll bring power amen I'm
[1:48:59] saying this for a reason amen if we have
[1:49:02] the love of listen I believe we're
[1:49:03] living in a Capstone age I believe it's
[1:49:05] a time of perfect love there's nothing
[1:49:07] going to take you over there but perfect
[1:49:09] love cuz that's all there is
[1:49:11] there if you don't have love get love
[1:49:15] don't worry about getting a Ministry or
[1:49:17] a following or an anoint get
[1:49:20] love cuz if you can't love your brother

[1:50:50] D's message and we understand he's
[1:50:52] appeared among us to bring us into that
[1:50:55] perfect love to bring us into Faith to
[1:50:57] take us in a
[1:50:59] Rapture Comfort yourselves together
[1:51:04] edify one another with this amen listen
[1:51:07] when we understand what's all about how
[1:51:08] that ought to throw us into
[1:51:11] action how that ought to soften our
[1:51:13] attitudes towards one another how it
[1:51:15] ought to renew our confidence today to
[1:51:18] press the battle you might have waited
[1:51:20] 21 days you might have waited 21 years
[1:51:22] years but God's the

[1:52:28] today to be a help to one
