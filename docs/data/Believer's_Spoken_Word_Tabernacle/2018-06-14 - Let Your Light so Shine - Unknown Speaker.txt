was a number of months from there from the everything that she had before but you know just as I was talking to brother Dave on the way to church and just press on my heart Lord I just want to bring this before the church and you know I I know that God I believe that God is more than able you know friends how many things about it in our lives where we've watched God restore we've watched God turns situations around and I believe this with all my heart that there is nothing too great for God God's able to move right there and and create restore whatever needs to be done with a disc a vertebra he's still God and all he needs is just only thing that he asked is just for us to believe and he just our sister so many different things that she's been through but we just want to just go

this audience tonight Lord and father break your word to our hearts old God made demons be sent in flight Oh God and may the Holy Ghost have the right away Lord we pray father we give ourselves to you tonight Lord and ask that you would just Lord speak to us Lord in a very personal way do we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you amen give me VGA one please if you'll turn in your Bibles here I want to go in Matthew I believe it's Matthew chapter five we want to we want to read from tonight I want to go back into this let your light so shine believe it's we're on the right one yeah Matthew five and verse 14 ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill and cannot be hidden and neither do men neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and giveth light unto all that are in the house and let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated we look at that far let let your light so shine before men and I just just striking looking at this last verse let your light so shine before men and you realize that as we are looking at this this is just a statement and when I come across and we look at statements within the Word of God these are not just just statements that we look at and we say my letters wonderful but water responsibility that it places upon our lives you are the light of the world and yet when we look at this God has a representative in this hour there there is God has no other hands but our hands he has no other feet but our feet but the responsibility look at it when in the light of the scripture that no man when he has lit a candle he doesn't hide it but that candle comes into position so the lighting of that candle then it's a bringing in position so that all that are in the house might see but it isn't so much just that the focus becomes upon the candle but that the candle itself would actually be able to enlighten and illuminate the way that is set before so when we look at this in thinking of it in this terms we are we we in this hour we are God's representatives we are a representative of his victory it's not something when we when we speak of Calvary we speak of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ we're not speaking of something that is just of a historical reference or of something that is just that we ourselves can just agree with but we are speaking as witnesses of that resurrection because that we have experienced that resurrection in our life that that life is dwelling on the inside of us we are a manifestation of his victory it becomes then in this hour - you and I when we we look at this charge that the Lord Jesus is giving to the disciples in this hour we do we are representatives of the message of this hour I tell you that's a hot charge because that means in everything that we say and that we do where we go how we live we we want to make sure that we are true representatives you know let me just say it like this and not dwell on this point we just don't want to deliver a word of truth but we want our lives to be a reflection of that truth because the brother man tells us in the message power transformation he said many times he said you can look at the word and he said maybe it was a hypocrite that preached that word he said but remember don't look at that man he said you look at the word because it was not and it's not the man that transforms you but it is the word that holds the power to transform so when we look at this that it's we only want when we in our lives come to a place of even being able to speak to someone else we want to be able in our hearts that it is an extension and it is who are we are speaking of is our own story in our own testimony so when we look at it what a responsibility that we have in this hour to declare him and when we look at this here in the in in the scriptures here pardon me here is just some of this is building but there is a true light I don't want to go into this party or just very briefly because when we look at the light itself that that we are to reflect there is a true light that enlightens the believer and when you look at how the Scriptures are set here there was a man sent from God whose name was John it said the same came for a witness to bear witness of V light that all men through him might believe this is a very it's a very important point because John's do remember John's coming I want you to think of this here is John standing there and there were many who even missed this time as far as John's physically being upon the earth but remember the light that had come through and John's that light that was reflected through was the light that was pointing the people to the true light that was going to be following there was a message that John was given and the message that John was given was to declare that Christ is now here it was to declare him as the Lamb of God which takes away the sin of the world and to think of this here that God how that the Lord would move by his word and you think of how that the word itself becoming light that what God when he spoke in the beginning of what you think of this God had already spoken concerning John's ministry God had already spoken all the way clear in the Old Testament now remember many brother Brendan brother Rama picked this up he says and I believe it's in God's power to transform and then he referred to empowered transformation he said many people read the book of Genesis and they say that God is repeating himself he said that God doesn't repeat himself you see the difference is when God he speaks his word first it's a word that's spoken just like it was in Genesis 1 the word first of all had to be spoken but after the word is spoken showing that it's a Word of God that word will come to light and that same God he spoke through the prophets and that word just lingered but it when it became time for that word to be fulfilled God would have man upon the scene that would be able to declare this prophecy that was spoken there is to be fulfilled there's no way that a man's mind could catch that it would have to be the supernatural God who spoke it back there would be stand-in right there illuminating that man in that time that that man would be able to look in the scripture and see his place in the scripture and be able to say this is the prophecy this is the time this is where we're living you know that's the same way in your life it isn't how much that you and I have studied it isn't that at all it's being ordained to this place and then the word itself it searches you and I'll and then through our lives it's not just a rallying but we begin to see the prophecy that God has for this day and we recognize that this is our prophecy we are a part of this and as we recognize that then our lives become placed in the candle step as a witness as a light to others so God's not repeating himself but God is simply declaring this now is the time so the Bible goes on to say he way that that he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light now remember they tried to place John but John was not that light John was sent to bear witness of him you with me any any true life and vessel will never seek to take the place of Jesus Christ is that right here John stands in the Book of Revelations the Bible tells us in the opening scripture of Revelation I believe it's revelation one one one one two how that God had sent his angel to signify these things under John you can see that this ministry John was ordained to receive this enlightenment in this understanding and God had an angel wasn't just said just vaguely out here but there's an intended audience and a target for this angel this messenger to come to and it's John down through the Book of Revelations all these things begin to open and John is seeing it and many things that John wondered at now the covers been taken off of it and as the covers been taken off of it John seen this illumination is so illuminated that John falls down multiple times to worship this angel but this angel being a true angel a true messenger he could say I am NOT that light I am sent to bear witness of it I am of the fellow servants the prophets I am a veil so he knew his position and would not receive worship that's where any believer will never receive worship because we recognize it is the life that is behind us can I preach tonight brother madam said it like this let me just show you how simple in the message have not our cynthy brother branham is praying and he said God he said that we just want to thank you he said because if there's anything that's been good and that's come out of our life it's because your Holy Ghost has overload our stubborn rebellion and pushed its way through hallelujah because God's not going to be defeated the Holy Spirit moves right through our lives even when we and ourselves are trying to grasp and believe and latch on to but the Holy Spirit remember it's God that sovereignly imparts to you and I what it is that you and I must come to and he conditions and works on our life to where that you and I are not removing us from free moral agency but to where that we become receptive to what he has ordained and desires to fulfill so it's him creating the atmosphere just like Genesis one over and over in our lives now think of this here he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light with bear witness what was John's ministry pointing him to him that's John's ministry so then we see that that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world so that light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world this is Christ this is the word this is the Holy Ghost that's the true light God is light so Johnson ministry being a true ministry was pointing and bearing witness of that light so when we look at this here brother Branham says it like this in spoken words original seed he said he that receives them that I sinned receives me and now them that he sinned and them that receives me receives him that sent me all he said I wish we could linger on that but you can only serve God as you do and believe the servants that God sins you can only serve God on earth has God's servants that sent on earth by divine inspiration interprets the word to you so God has ordained servants that he already has ordained for this moment it is in me and God don't need men that smart he don't need anybody to be smart all he needs is vessels that shielded he himself is the one that will proclaim his message and his life through us he don't need all of that he showed that with Moses when Moses wanted to try to put his intellect and everything to try to free him from Egypt but God said you can't free him by intellect all I need to do is get all the trash out of your life and I can step on the inside and I'm the one that will deliver them I was the one who spoke the word and I'm the one who comes on the scene to fulfill that word so God makes it known you can only serve Him badly received the servants to which he sins now remember many can look and proclaim and rally and we thank God for salvation we thank God for forgiveness of sins but remember with the ministry that God has given with those seven stars that are in his right hand those seven lamps that are before the throne those seven spirits remember what they are reflecting they are drawing from that true life of the atonement and they are reflecting that life back into the Church of the Living God and remember it is to call worshipers to worship Him in spirit and in truth so that's the ministry is bringing the people together in a unity now watch this when we look here in the scriptures we've been we've been dealing with this on the Tabernacle in the wilderness and I want to just hone in just a little bit more on this reflection in this life that is set before us we realized that with the tabernacle of God that each and every one of us are a three-room house we know that every one of us were made up of a three-room house and we also understand and we see that even within this here there was an approach that was ordained a gate whereby that men could actually enter aren't you thankful that God became the way there is no way that you and I could could ever make it but he became on entrance and away and and then through that way you and I can can enter in not just out here in the outer court but there's a way that's been made here in the holy place and and then a way that's been made into the holiest of Holies and we look at this light itself let me just hone in on this just a little bit because you look at how that when we're dealing with this on the candlesticks and in our lives of how that each one of these lamps are lamps of the candlestick they are they are to reflect him they are to show his brilliance they are to show his honor but you realized that it's not just something that's meant to be stationary in other words it's not something where you just come and look at it but there is a reason that these lights are where they are because these lights are set in a place here when we look at it as we move into the holy place right here these lights are set in a place right here this this candelabra here the menorah it's set here in a place so that there is light now remember this was this was an area that had to be attended to by Aaron it had to be attended to in the evening had to be cared for even in the morning and you look at how that when the Scriptures here would speak of this of how that these seven lamps how that they were to give light over against the candlestick I want you to look in here just for a moment you find the table of shewbread which the shewbread itself being the bread of his face the bread of his presence and I want you to look at this this altar of incense if you eliminate these lights you don't know what's in there and when you eliminate them Lots you don't recognize the bread of his presence which is actually the bread of his face that's what showbread means so you're not illuminated to the word so what is the light itself doing that lamp that one of those one of the spirits of God it illuminates it brings light upon the word it lifts the word from just letter to light and when the word is lifted to life then by word becomes a lamp unto my feet a light unto my path way so this light is not just something where we come in here and we glory around the light and we talked about how the vessel that God used its shop squirrel said its shot but we know that we're not glory in that we thank God for all the testimonies but remember here there is a witness walk in the light while you have the light lest darkness overtake you God doesn't need the physical messenger here upon earth it's the message that goes forth it's the message that is lied because the holy spirit vindicates and makes that word that was spoken that you and I can say that ain't brother branham's were that's God speaking that's God spoke that because a man's word will not act like that a man's word won't create don't you realize about the whole story of the squirrels and all those things it was speaking even in our life and it speaks even of the body change it's God providing for himself he's the one who spoke the rapture he's the one who declared there's gonna be a church without spot wrinkle blemish then he that declared he is Jehovah Jireh to provide for himself he is the word glory be to God in the highest so these lights the light it illuminates this light illuminates it shows it shows the direction to go and here's something oh my he dreamt full of new wine what's going on here it's 10:00 still light is shining what must we do to be saved what does the light do the light says I can point you to where I've been and where I'm living from but you've got to make this journey on your own what must I do repent see light is upon the world repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost those Peter could say I got it you got a hold of me so what is Peters what is the light that is shining through Peter what is the light that shines to you it points the people to the true and living way the Lord Jesus Christ doesn't point people to a church who I don't want dwell on that one tonight it points us to price so this is where the scripture could say let your light so shine I know you already know I'm very simple but sometimes this just certain little words it just grab off the screen and just literally shake me let your light not just let it shine let it so shine then men might see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven I'll tell you right now is gonna be a testimony but by the works that they're seeing that there is greater reality than just man's effort but these works declare the Living God and it's only by the Living God and that's what the good works it's a life that's Express that brings glory to God now think of this let's look at this here in the scripture just a little bit there is a token that's to be on display and you think of how the scripture boy that's small you'll have problems seeing that tonight brother a you ever see that back there oh but if we're gonna get you some glasses I want I wondered about that and I really apologize for that but I think you all know the scriptures here I'm coming out of Exodus 12 you you pretty much know the scriptures I wasn't putting this so much to read it but notice how that God he declared that they were to take out a land and they're to take out that lamb for an offering there to kill that lamb and then when they were to kill that lamb they're to take a bunch of hyssop hyssop common faith it don't take great big faith it don't take huge and overarching faith to apply the promise of God it just simply takes on adulterated simple faith when you've got a need in your life that's all that it takes is simple common faith you say well I'm gonna come up here and I'm gonna be pray for fear if you don't have simple common faith this will do you no good but if you can just ask God even if you're looking and trying to believe if you can just be honest and say lord help my unbelief God will move on the scene you see let me tell you something God is drawn to humility he sure is God is drawn to honesty he's drawn to that and he or he'll even create within us what we even need to be able to satisfy the promise think of this take that lamb and to kill that lamb and to take the hyssop common faith and with that hyssop there to apply it upon the lentils and upon the post of the door and God let it be known he said that when I come through the land to smite with the curse and I see the blood upon the lentil and on the two side posts the Lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you because there's already been a witness when the death angels looking at this blood let me tell you something the death angel knew whether that was good but blood or lamb blood he knew what kind of blood it was it wasn't just good enough to have blood it had to be lambs blood and that lambs blood had to be applied and when it was applied it was a witness death had already come to this house amen the firstborn inside of this house his safe under God's prevail yet that blood was a witness there it was a sign that there's already been judgment has come to this house and there the death angel would pass right over it was a token that was on display glory gonna hold it be to God forgive me for a little bit here but I think probably most of you seen the 10 commandments I always think about that time when I'm looking over this of what's that guy's name day Fionn when he's in there you know and and then somebody had come and put blood over his door and then they come knock on his door and he said get out of here get out what do you mean get out on the governor here get out why are you telling me to get out what's all this on your door but he didn't put it there there won't be one go out of here that don't want to blood let me tell you something when that blood has been applied it identifies you and you're identified in it and by it I don't care where you go you're identified you understand what I'm saying it doesn't matter where you go you're still a Christian oh my luck we were dealing a little bit there on Friday night with Daniel down and down in Babylon you put Daniel down in Babylon but Daniel he purposed in his heart and you Daniel was going to live a victorious life right in the midst of Babylon how about you and I as Daniels right in the midst of Babylon God's got boys girls God's got men and women that can live victorious in the midst of Babylon lie the secret is the indwelling of his power on the inside oh my think of this here when we look at this think of it oh my that's so small well I'll read it to you in hell the blood was a token or an identification the blood identified that the worshipper had slain the lamb and accepted the lamb and apply the token to himself that he was not ashamed he didn't care who saw it he wanted everybody to see it and it was placed in such a position that everybody passing by could see that token you couldn't miss seeing that token it was on display there was no hiding it you say Jesus willing to be no you can't take this candle you don't put it under a bushel that's not the purpose of it being lit or that it's hidden under a bed but when it's lit it's placed on a candlestick that all that come in might see you see light itself if I had a lie and I'm holding that light down here maybe a candle or a lot and I'm holding it right here real close to the floor that ain't going to help you too much but when that light becomes and is lifted up when that light is lifted up the illumination or glory begins to illuminate in a greater way can't you see in this hour when there was a sounding on earth that said come out of Babylon my people and be you separated there was an echo in heaven that sounded that this is a heavenly voice as the third angel went fine come out of Babylon and the Bible says that the earth was enlightened with its glory amen a message that declared that God has a people a church he's been building he has been molding he has been shaping and he's calling about why it's time to leave here a message that illuminates gives light so that you and I might see our way out [Music] Gloria is that many people wants to be Christians they like to do it secretly so nobody would know they were Christians or the associates they run around with some of them think we'll now look I want to be a Christian but I don't want so and sort of know about it well now you see that's not Christianity but I remember that I can identify with this quote right here I remember that at one time got quieted here I remember that as a young boy I remember that in the pressures and everything as I entered back in into school and all those things and now listen to me now I remember that but I also know when there came another visitation but it went much deeper it didn't matter who said what it didn't matter who put pressure on here there I should tell him when they came they would walk right by when I was selling suits they make their way in on Friday nights they would come in the door here it was a door that they wouldn't enter that mall you've been over there brother Joey where I worked at in the pennies they would come in that that direction right there they would come in there sometimes they were so tipsy and all of a sudden they would come in there you know giggling and cutting up but let me tell you something hi there was also other people that I worked with there in that job I would tell them people the same thing that I told others I said I've met that same God that you've no doubt heard about in the scriptures I met that God personally face-to-face and he changed my life the Samuel and the Sam browning that you once knew that guy don't live here no more the things that he used to like to do I don't like to do those things a little more that's a mystery to them but there's one thing about it they couldn't deny it because they knew the same browning that can make all kinds of promises and give him a few days and then promises are shredded come on somebody I know I'm preaching angels tonight you understand there's a there's a difference I don't care hey men huh what's this Christianity has to display it's token see publicly in public life at the office on the street when trouble is around anything in church Wow I mean isn't that just a given and that just a given I mean we're in church there are token the token is the life being applied and we have to apply the token right in church we've got to apply the token in our homes I'm not just talking about not having this and not having that it's got to go deeper even than that I'm talking about applying it on our attitudes I'm talking about applying it in forgiveness this is applying of this life you can't separate this message life you can't separate it and make it different if you try to separate it you've got doctrine here and you've got life over here you can't separate it it's the life itself that gives validity and strength and vindication to the doctrine Laura be to God everywhere else my the blood is in the token and the token must be applied or it's not even the Covenant it's not even in effect now look at this remember the scripture the Bible says grieve not whereby you are sealed with a holy spirit of promise I'll put this on there I don't know if this is real visible or not but you all seen a seal you boys seen don't just look at me y'all seen a seal or not because you know I'll stand right here and come right down there on you you guys have seen the seal before right when my wife and I went to go and and getting married I'm just put a simple okay they pulled out a document and that document they had to run it through a computer and put our names on there but there was somebody there that in the bottom part of that paper was like I don't know if it's a clay type stuff or what it is I don't need to know the mechanics of it all but you understand what I'm saying that the part of it is is that there was a part that is made on that document that's able to receive an impression and when you put that impression you could put that impression just on a piece of paper that impression is greater than even a signature this is somebody that is notarized in other words it's not just somebody can sign but this person has been approved by the government or the local government and they have been approved to notarize and say this marriage certificate is valid and it is in force and you know what you get your hands on it and you rub it it's raised up y'all know I'm talking about now you know I'm talking you rub it on the back and you can feel the indentations you can rub if you got fingernails you can rub it across there or you can rub it on the front and you know man there's been something touch this it actually changed the form of this paper because the actual seal has been impressed upon this now you can look at the front of that paper and you'll see something like this where you can read it but you can also flip that paper around and you know when you look at the backside of that paper it's been sealed this is where the Prophet said when you're sealed with the Holy Ghost the seal on both sides of the paper both coming and going they can see the walk the talk the life of Christ reflecting in his people that's the purpose of his death the church that the church might continue his work but we've conglomerated it up with a bunch of everything so the purpose is to continue his work a seal is not just a ceil as a security a seal is a sign it shows coming and going when you enter a place and you exit a place understand it isn't Wow this is the man this is the wonderful I tell you what there's such a wonderful person and then they get around you and they're like dear Lord I wonder if there's another part of the plan I can get transferred to I wonder if there's another part you see coming and going now y'all understand I've got to put a little disclaimer here on this right here I understand friends that we all don't have the same temperament I understand that we all have different personalities part of your maturity is also recognizing that and reading over that in your own life and instead of saying that person I'll tell you but rather they aren't maybe they are the way they are God has allowed your paths to come across them so that you can see the greenness in your life that you and I have to so subject in our life and yet we're praying Oh God deliver me of this table delivery of this he will when you get a body change he will change your body and he'll change all your buttons you see why you just don't need to be a young person again because you still have them same buttons you got now you need to get your buttons changed not just a young body oh my so it's a showing coming and going now look how the Scriptures put it here but we are positioned in light the scripture said no man winning light of the candle cover that with a vessel or put a fit under a bed if he's doing that in aimed and lit what's the purpose of lighting it but he said if it notices set if it on a candlestick look at this if the can't glory if it is there to be lit it shows there's something to be lit and they're showing that there's something to be lit something must come to light it it's got to be ignitable and there must be a source of ignition and there is also a place for placing seda fit on a candlestick so as we see this God's positioning us within the light of the word in this hour that our lives are a reflection of that light think of this now another part of the scripture no man say it same same thought no man when he hath lighted a candle put us in in a secret place neither under a bushel but on a candlestick that they which come in may see the light 9 so God how God has has a reflection of this hour as we said remember earlier with the candlesticks and how that we can look at our lives there it's God's desire that our lives would point people to Jesus Christ if our lives and listen to me now if our lives only point people to the church we're missing it if our lives point people to the messenger we're missing it we're to point people to Jesus Christ you understand now because when when they come and Christ is being revealed listen friends there's no way listen to me there's no way in the world that you and I can go into the scriptures in this hour but God has illuminated this Bible the message then take away from the Bible the message came right out of this Bible it's brought the word that was in letter now to light it didn't take away from it as a matter of fact I love my Bible more every day I love my Bible more when I'm reading in the Bible I'm not just reading stories I'm reading about me and the Lord Jesus it's not just stories when I read about Abraham setting up the tent door I myself said after 10 door I expecting him to come these are not stories these are prophecies hallelujah not events of history many can just look back at history but when you know the God of history to be the same I am then you can know and believe that what he did back there he's still the same God and then these are not just history this is not just stories but you see it has absolutely possibilities in your own life that God might be able to move glory be to God in the highest you love him tonight oh my brother brems said it like this the only way that the world will ever see Christ is when they see it in you and me and that's the only way they'll ever see Christ he said their conscience are known how many know that the this was said clear back there in the time 1961 lord have mercy their conscience are numbed in what about now you're doing good if you can get them to look off their phone for a minute and look at you you're doing real good if you can drive down the highway and there don't have their phone up here like this hey you and I we both see I see it all the time it don't matter what kind of laws they put in place people still do it you know what that is that's an addiction that's exactly what it is it's an addiction but oh I'm so glad that God breaks addictions aren't you oh yes sir their conscience are numb to the sunsets it's just a sunset to the call of the birds to the leaves to the grass and to the flowers and the music and the message and so forth that we enjoy after we have found Christ now I know you may not enjoy cutting the grass but you also realize that as you cut it down it grows right back you see the leaves right they fall off the tree but you see him come back when you see the birds fine it's a witness to you you realize that God is present now think of this here when we look at it in showing forth his praises this scripture would begin to look at last week out of the book of Peter ye are a chosen generation what a responsibility a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light he is the light he has called us out of darkness into his marvelous light why we are to show forth the praises of him the scripture says which in times past were not a people but are now the people of God this word people it it don't mean that as a goal it was like you were in nobody but you were out of the line and walking in the line that you would walk in you were always a part of him are you with me you are always ordained in him the Prophet tells us improving his word in 1964 he said you are ordained in him but he said you've come in this life and the light has shone upon you to confirm your place in this life you are always a part of this word that's why nothing else could satisfy and nothing else can satisfy but him you are ordained you were not a people you were not a part of that body but yet how he sought you out brought you unto himself and by one spirit baptized into one body we are people now we are the people of God look at this last part set which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy so when we were out and whatever condition we were in we had not obtained mercy mercy had not become manifest in our life but when the word itself come across our pathway and that word illuminates and lightens our life then we have obtained a mercy let me tell you something David the Bible says surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life that word follow means chase after mercy and goodness chased after me all the days of my life and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever glory be to God look at this here we're God's billboard you've ever seen a billboard I've never seen terrible billboards I have but I've never seen a billboard that shows a nasty Big Mac I've never seen a billboard let's just talk about McDonald's I've never seen a billboard that shows a Big Mac with wilted lettuce I've never seen that Big Mac looked like an elephant stamped on and it gave it to you and it's all you know laying all over but what I see on the Billboard everything is just springing it's almost where you may not even have the size of hands to grip around it there's a little drops of moisture on the lettuce so place down there the the sauce is not running all over the place and and the seeds halfway ripped off the bun on top and then laying over like this it looks perfect till you order it and get it I don't like Big Macs myself but Benjamin does I don't like him you give me just a regular little simple cheeseburger you know I'm talking about of course with a little bit of fries grass-fed ones God's billboard now look at this I believe Rosenbaum said that the Christian is God's billboard I believe that each one of us is God's billboard and we don't have to do so much carrying on about it as we do just simply live such a lot that'll make the people hungry to be like you now you've ever seen a billboard to talked I never seen it don't want to say hey drive on in here never seen that but that billboard has such a picture on it you don't need to talk you see what picture is displayed it tells it all and the picture that Psalm there will cause you to check exit 135 oh what is that honey what is that for be okay for B let's make sure exit 135 is for bees I don't want for a for what's making you do that what is that the advertisement the Billboard is getting your attention you're hungry now you're hungry how do I get to that and satisfy this hunger there is a path of life or a way that is pointed out to you exit 135 for B it's attractive but then again after you've ate lunch or I've ate dinner let me drive down the road I don't care about a Big Mac some people I don't care about it I don't care what I'm full I'm not hungry now you put a dish ice cream there on that side you see God kissed me at the right time but somebody's got to be hungry so you see a billboard just simply displays to the hungry and it's attractive to the hungry he said each one of you from tonight on remember you are God's billboards you're God's advertising agent the world will look at you to see what Christ is look look at you the same I want to tell just let them look first when they look then then if opportunity presents then you can speak it's kind of hard look look look look look it's kind of hard you all know what it is I mean man when you drop down into West Virginia and you drive down sometimes parts of Kentucky ooh now I don't have nothing against them states but the thing of it is is that you can sometimes you can't hardly get somewhere to get something they you wouldn't know what's up some of them hollers if they didn't put it out there and you get spoiled by living in Ohio you think they got a McDonald's on this exit I'll get up and nobody told you you've got to make 10 miles around Mindy twisty around the mountains to get to this little McDonald's right you're expecting like you are in Ojai sure right up danceing ramp there it is and you get off and you're driving around and mrs. GPS is redirecting recalculating recalculating recalculating recalculating study getting there 3:00 p.m. you'll get there 6:00 p.m. now it's taking you all around but listen to me listen you would not even go that way if there wasn't a billboard out here on the roadway that lets you know there's a place down this road so there's got to be a billboard that lets you know there is a place down this road glory so we don't want to smear a big lot of stuff on there that testify about things that we really are not let's first be that and then when we be that then the world will see Christ in you and me on the billboard if you put a lot of words on a billboard there is going to be accidents right there you don't put a lot of words on a billboard you show them what you have to offer the only words that are there is to point them in to direct them where they need to go to satisfy the hunger that have been stirred up in them that all right we don't have to have big audiences we don't have to preach the 10,000 we don't have to even preach we can be God's advertisement board how do you all want you to watch this now how do you know that your life might not start some young man on the gospel your life might start some young man on the gospel some of you older men you older women want a responsibility all both Samuel I just come in a church I just enjoy the word I just you're selfish you just come here and all you do is well I just enjoy the word I just joined the presence of God oh praise God hallelujah I just enjoyed yourself if you don't shine your light you don't look around and see one life can be passed on to somebody else come on friends we're missing a great part of Christianity when coming to church is just about you driving in to the parking lot and you leaving all of a sudden and not sticking around with the body and not even being in consideration for others and a burden we're missing the purpose as your candle is that under a bushel is it under a bed whoo I'll show me preach billa's Enya hey listen I got all the fingers coming right back here at me as well - we are to be servants one of another if we if we don't give with listen friends if all we're doing is coming to the house of God that ain't no different than going to McDonald's you show up an order you cram your face and then you leave that's not what it is to come to the house of God it's to be a part of a body of believers it's recognize you've got a responsibility here not to straighten everybody out we don't need that we just need you to let your light shine and have a burden for the kingdom of Almighty God that's what we need that's the lives that we need but you see this age this age is all about self Mayan got time last time I talked to somebody you know forget about that maybe the last time you talked to him you talked in the wrong way I don't get to that tonight but maybe that's what it was there's an approach you see what it is your life is giving out light maybe it's the light of testimony in your life how God has brought you through a trial and that trial nobody else could drink that cup but you but you got a testimony and somebody else comes along the way listen to me now somebody else comes along the way and God will inspire that to be given you understand I'm saying these are not things just just spoke out sporadically but I believe that just as God himself would ordain the word to be ministered here tonight I believe God also inspires his children that they themselves would testify and you and be able to give a witness when you're out there when you with another brothers sister ideally that God is still God so many times people talk about nickel alien ism but many times it's not addressed about reverse nickel alien ism they want to put everything on the plaster put everything on the prophet who laureate ho the Prophet did everything well the pastor did everything this is not a one-man ministry this is a body he that were witness of the light he has come and that message is influencing our lives to Jesus Christ and you and I are to be illuminated by that light whoo it's a responsibility you know you're going to give recount will give an account if you live your life to yourself you might want to check if it's really eternal life flowing through you or say God you know what I got my mind I'm too busy on all this I got all this projects I got all this I got all of this on my meditation is so tore up god I can't even think about you let me tell you something friends I believe with all my heart win huh God by His grace I know what it means also to be busy and I'm thankful for all those times that God allowed me even in the times when I work there and teaching and pastoring right here when sometimes your mind is so busy so busy with so many things to where somebody can say I'm busy I understand that what it means to be busy but I also know what it means that even in the midst of the busyness to where my mind and my heart by God's grace would still be upon him and how many times in the midst of a busiest times where the Spirit of God would come right there I might be taking him on a bathroom break at school and the Holy Ghost come right down and I would write on a poster note things that would actually come forth as a message from here let me tell you something God didn't do that just because there was a gift in my life I'm telling you each and every one can have that same kind of visitation as you meditate on him and realize it's not about me it's not about my job everything that I talk about it's not about me I can't do this because of this I can't how about giving a testimony of the word I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me cuz he ain't a high priest of our complaints start some young man on the field out there that would win ten thousand souls to Christ it was because that he saw Christ in you it's you look at this statement what a powerful statement it's you presented Christ to him in the simple power of the gospel I'm gonna just stop here on this this is what were to do tell how your candle got lit brother brems said it in many other times he said if you can't tell somebody about all these other things he said just tell him how your candle got matte just tell them what what what what lit you up let me let me pass this on by here cuz I'll get to this here Lord willing we'll just skip that I'm andin I'm in it cuz I'm gonna give you chocolate cake and you've got a rush to eat it actually this is more steak so we'll just we're gonna wait as soon as God lights the candle take off take off if you don't know more don't know no more just telling how it got lit let them get lit and they'll tell somebody else and we'll have a candle lighting time but brother Samuel isn't God the one to light them yes but he will not work outside of his body the eunuch was to be lit he was reading Isaiah's prophecy are you with me he was reading Isaiah's prophecy but the Spirit of God had Philip go down there fell upon the Prophet he was an evangelist a deacon in the church but he was led by the Spirit of God and Philip was told by God go join yourself to this chariot and as he joined himself to that chariot he simply asked him a question do you understand what you're reading do you understand what you're reading what's the approach God through Philip those scriptures became opened to the eunuch and you know how to spoken words original seed you know it from a personal witness in your life but the Prophet tells us the seed of life travels through the body seed of life travels and that is God's Way you understand this is why God is why the Prophet labored over and over through the message God does not use mechanical devices he does he said if God wanted the Sun to preach the gospel he could have done it he could have done that but God didn't do that God has ordained preachers to preach the gospel and he's also ordained you and I to live and to express that word have a candle lighting time that's what we need anyhow instead of so much theology candle lighting just tell how it got lit that's all you have to tell don't try to preach it just say how it got lit I got filled with something that's burning me up I got filled with something that's burning me up just tell about the lighting time how it got lit and it'll give the light as it burns down let that one light let let that one lights another one and then he'll tell how it got lit and he'll tell how and lit there will be a light around there after a while it will just tell that much remember that on the altar the fire was lit from before of the Lord and that fire was taken from there and the consuming of that sacrifice and they walked in to light the candle stick and his lamps but every lamp was lit when he lit this lamp he took the fire from that lamp passed it here then the fire from this one he just didn't hold in light showing that life travels through the body the Holy Spirit travels through the body and this is what the Prophet is saying right here tell how your candle got lit because remember it isn't that God listen to me now God doesn't need a pastor to light somebody he don't need a prophet to light somebody God can move right through your surrendered vessel and your life points the way and as they yield to that you tell how you got lit and watch how God can move for them and they can have faith that they can be lit to be lit by that same God you're loving tonight all let your light so shine I want to be God's faithful billboard don't you I don't want to be I don't I'm not interested I don't have to say everything you don't have to be say you just just let it be on display let it be what a calls are hungry if they're hungry God will open the door got to open the door and then you can tell them exit this far ahead this many miles well how far is it to so I get that well it's three steps I mean three steps of grace or three miles ahead and you're going to get off right here and it'll be a sharp turn but you've got to be willing to love him more than self and you keep moving around there more than father and mother sister a brother it's a light that's so shines it's a billboard that says it all maybe tonight you might feel like Oh Samuel I feel like my paper needs to be done up a little bit I feel like one of them billboards it seemed like it's a little tattered on the side but remember he don't have to repair your soul he's already sealed that song there might be some things on the outside that's not reflecting from the inside the way that it ought to be but this is where you can't apply the token it's medicine that you can take and if there's anything that's hindering that life from reflecting and showing its way through there's a cleansing agent that can flush out any flu that stopped up he can put back to the papers where it needs to be he can create right from our life and bring forth that hunger now I might require you having to go ask somebody for forgiveness you might have to go and say I'm sorry I shouldn't have said it but I mean you don't know what no but maybe you have to do that and when you find you're doing that you'll find that paper going right back up over brother Sam what will they think if I come and I confess that they'll think you're a real Christian that's what they'll think you're a real Christian brother branham in his time when he hollered back in the house and said tell him I'm not here but then the Holy Spirit moved upon his heart I went to pray for that baby you know the story but then he came back around and he made it right to those agents what did those agents say for the brand we always had respect for you before but we've got more respect for you now and if saying sorry is a hard word for you ask God if forgive me is a hard phrase Scot because remember we are part of that family tree not this tree so he gives us the ability to say Oh me you might think that's strange but sometimes it's awful hard but I'll tell you what if we're tapped into that life then we are ordained and we have access to him I just want my life I believe you want your life to to be that life that invites to the hungry I don't want to invite everybody I'm gonna leave you with this tonight I don't want to invite everybody but yet I'm out there to be displayed before everybody but the only ones I want to invite are those that's hungry and if they're not hungry now I'll be on maybe that same job next week maybe they get hungry they're not hungry next week maybe they'll be hungry tomorrow if they ain't hungry this month maybe they'll be hungry next month if they ain't hungry next month maybe they'll be hungry next year if God terry's but one way or another what I have it steals fresh it still is a satisfied to the hungry so it's there it's there it don't matter what they said or what they thought it's still open 24 hours seven days a week because the CEO and manager of this corporation never slumbers or sleeps it's always in stock they never run out of stock at all you never have to worry about showing up at the menu and they say we're out of that right now if you did this got here earlier no but a whole menu as a matter of fact this isn't just breakfast time oh sorry breakfast was only to 11:00 a.m. but now the full seven-course meal is open all things are before you he has prepared a table in the presence of you loving tonight Amen let's pray Heavenly Father oh dear God how we love you tonight more Jesus we appreciate you Lord so much just so thankful dear God for your mercy in your grace Lord tonight throughout this building or perhaps hearts lives that Lord as we would desire and hunger that our lives would be true billboards let's speak and Express of you Lord Lord Jesus I think Lord as I many times I know some different ones Lord for the herb sister eat a different ones Lord that lived down and some of those southern states and even different ones of us has traveled down through there Lord sometimes you're looking on the side of a hill you'll see a cross sometimes Lord you'll see crosses sometimes you'll see billboards where will you spend eternity sometimes Lord there'll be a big billboard Jesus is the answer Lord many of them places all the way down through their North Carolina Tennessee in different places it's referred to as the Bible Belt but I look at it Lord are those really the best billboards those billboards are words on a sign people can read that and there's people that have become so custom that they can drive by cross after cross billboard after billboard they're numb to those billboards like it has become with the grass the flowers the birds but what about a life back at me place right before maybe out of their own family maybe in the plant maybe in the place where they work a life that has been so transformed but there is not enough psychiatrist and psychologist that could have ever turned that man or woman around they realized this person's not been reformed but there's a light there illuminated it's like that little man known as tiny that German he would go in that store he was so happy how he had been lit up on the power of God but yet Lord God his boss said what in the world is wrong with you he said oh I've been down to the meeting last night and I got saved you mean you been down there ha me with that bunch of junk is it all thank God for the young thank God for the nuts Oh [Music] God his life had been lit up wood there was a change that came about his life Lord countless countless number of testimonies through the Scriptures the insight that the Spirit of God would take through the prophetic eye in the Sonora that would talk to us about Zacchaeus and his wife Oh God I believe with all my heart Lord but I'm not only speaking to your billboards I believe I'm one of the billboards we don't have to have a lot of words as your prophet said in one of these quotes right here so you don't have to preach just live the simple power of the gospel help us Lord help us just that our lives would reflect you not a bunch of letters not a bunch of words but let it just reflect you because people will never look at exit 135 for B first they don't catch their attention it's that whopper that Big Mac that ice-cream whatever it is it's a picture and then if that picture is something that speaks to their hunger they'll look they'll look at the words because that picture will point them to the words your life inside of us Lord God it'll never leave people outside of the word it leads people to you not to a church to a movement it leads people to you this is our desire help us father help every young person every old help us father as we see the responsibility in this hour and this time we'll God from our lives or their lives might be living further we do still want to hand out the gospel because the gospel can now be handed out as you said in your word all set our gospel came not in word only but in power and demonstration so as your prophet would tell us over countless number of times he said the Bible is not altogether the gospel the gospel is the Living Word in action and demonstration Oh God let our lights this is our desire let our light so shine more tonight many of us Lord will never get a chance maybe to tread on
