[40:53] he didn't have a hard name but you know
[40:55] how it is with me uh I ask the person's
[40:58] name if I don't write it down right away
[41:00] it'll slip it has nothing to do whether
[41:02] anybody's important or not but I'm
[41:04] grateful amen that God knows our name
[41:06] aren't you amen and I tell you if I can
[41:09] only if I can if I have problems keeping
[41:10] track of a few names hey he knows the
[41:13] Stars by
[41:15] [Music]
[41:16] name he knows about us that's what's
[41:18] more important is't it that God knows
[41:20] about each of us the Bible said the
[41:22] hairs of our head are numbered that
[41:25] includes all the hair that have gone
[41:27] from mine still numbered God knows

[41:40] as we invite brother John Singer to come

[41:45] so thankful to have brother John and
[41:46] sister Rebecca uh his his lovely wife
[41:49] here with
[41:54] us so some of you would know probably
[41:57] some of you will know a little bit of
[41:58] the connection probably uh with those of
[42:00] you who know brother Russell Wallace who
[42:03] knows brother Russell Wallace if you're
[42:05] brave enough to raise your hand that you
[42:07] know
[42:08] him so brother Russell Wallace is his
[42:12] wife is Sister Rebecca's
[42:14] sister so that's wonderful we don't hold
[42:17] that against you sister Rebecca I'm just
[42:19] teasing I we we I love to tease with
[42:20] brother Russell but uh we just so love
[42:23] them and I appreciate brother John um
[42:26] brother John's Ministry and what the
[42:28] gift that God has placed in his life I
[42:30] know we're going to be blessed this
[42:32] morning because a gift it's to get
[42:35] ourselves out of the way and God has God
[42:38] is a god of a great bouquet he's a god
[42:41] of variety when you look Beyond in
[42:44] Revelations 5 it says here was a bride
[42:46] of many kindreds nations and
[42:49] tongues God takes his people from all
[42:53] diversity of life and even the gift that
[42:56] God places in our life they're all
[42:59] uniquely diverse one from another but
[43:02] that's
[43:03] purposeful that's purposeful God didn't
[43:06] have to do it that way but God did it
[43:09] that way because God's Not only
[43:11] displaying himself but he's showing his
[43:14] love to you or I and so we just want to
[43:17] welcome Amen Brother John sister Rebecca

[43:29] believe God really has something special
[43:31] for us amen for certain God doesn't call
[43:34] us together to waste our time there's
[43:37] something he has to say so let's just
[43:39] pull on the gift of God brother John's
[43:41] been used the Lord has used him very
[43:43] instrumentally where I've seen is even
[43:45] among the young people but I know if how

[50:15] from Mexico came one time to our to one
[50:17] of the Farms there around us I don't
[50:19] know why this came to mind but I am who
[50:21] I am and so but he came to a farm there
[50:24] and we have a couple farmers in the
[50:25] church there are two big Dairy Farmers
[50:27] one milks uh 700 cows and the other one
[50:30] milks 100 cows and he went to the farm
[50:32] that milked 100 cows and there's a big
[50:34] milk tank in there and uh he said boy
[50:37] could you imagine being a kitty cat and
[50:39] just laying back in that milk you know
[50:41] like that floating in the milk you know
[50:42] so if you need to relax I understand so
[50:45] you just relax this morning I'm going to
[50:47] try to so if you take your Bibles and
[50:49] turn to 2 Timothy 2 and we're going to
[50:52] read verses 24 to 26 and then take a
[50:55] text out of uh 26 verse 26 and
[51:02] so I'll let you stand a little bit with
[51:05] me and uh I do I can tell already just
[51:09] by listening back there that you all uh
[51:12] believe in audience
[51:13] participation and I like that
[51:16] amen it helps me so this is 2 Timothy 2
[51:22] and verses
[51:24] 24 to
[51:27] 26 we believe in audience participation
[51:30] right and
[51:33] the of the Lord must not but be gentle
[51:40] unto apt
[51:42] to patient in meekness instructing those
[51:47] that
[51:48] oppose if God per Adventure will give
[51:51] them repentance to the acknowledging of
[51:53] the trth
[51:55] and this is the verse I want to take a
[51:57] text from and that they may recover
[52:01] recover I love that
[52:05] word in my line of work you
[52:09] know you don't have to necessarily pray
[52:12] for somebody for them to be
[52:15] healed now just think about it for a
[52:18] second it says lay hands on the sick and
[52:21] they
[52:23] shall they're going to
[52:26] recover I'm not saying you're not
[52:28] praying for him when you lay hands on
[52:30] him but it's interesting that all you
[52:32] have that in you you have that virtue
[52:34] you have that Holy Spirit in you that
[52:37] you can give that out to
[52:39] everybody and even somebody you shook
[52:41] hands with or you know brother Tom
[52:44] greeted me at the door and I knew a
[52:46] little bit about him that he didn't know
[52:48] that he didn't know that I knew and I
[52:49] knew he had open heart surgery and so I
[52:52] just put my hand right there but you
[52:54] know what I was doing I was Lord you you
[52:57] be with his heart you know because
[53:00] you're laying hands on the people every
[53:02] day that they may
[53:06] recover and that they may recover
[53:08] themselves out of
[53:11] the of
[53:12] the who are taken captive by him at his
[53:20] will
[53:22] so I'm sorry I'm going to you're up here
[53:25] the front I'm going to ask you to help
[53:26] me a little bit what's your name Aaron

[53:48] that's good that's good I I love it I'll
[53:50] need you tonight up front here too so
[53:53] but a snare could be a snare drum but
[53:55] what's what's a
[53:56] snare a snare is a
[54:02] trap that they may recover themselves
[54:05] out of the Trap Of The
[54:10] Devil who are taken captive by him at
[54:14] his will so to me the devil would be

[54:22] Trapper right okay let's just bow our
[54:24] head Heavenly Father Lord we have our

[54:38] that you know everyone that came through
[54:39] the door and you knew they would be here

[54:45] eyes and how many hairs would be on
[54:47] their head

[59:08] Trappers in here so we got some novice
[59:11] people Brother David we're going to need
[59:12] to educate about trapping because it's
[59:14] pretty much a lost hobby Nobody Does it
[59:17] anymore do you still trap Brother David
[59:19] no no nobody does cuz the fur isn't
[59:21] worth anything anymore you know I tried
[59:23] trapping a couple times you you know I
[59:25] caught a
[59:26] skunk and uh yeah and and I caught the
[59:31] the farmers
[59:33] Doberman and so but I I let him loose I
[59:36] let him loose nobody was harmed but so I
[59:39] wasn't a very successful Trapper but the
[59:41] Devil is a very successful
[59:45] Trapper he he never he he never stops
[59:49] trapping
[59:50] you or trying to trap you through your
[59:53] entire life
[59:55] he will he is indiscriminate on who he
[59:57] traps and he doesn't care about your age
[1:00:00] location or where you are in life or
[1:00:02] your circumstance he is going to try to
[1:00:04] trap
[1:00:07] you that's his goal in life is to
[1:00:10] trap and trap
[1:00:13] you so he's tried to trap God's children
[1:00:15] throughout the ages and the first person
[1:00:18] he trapped was a
[1:00:20] lady and what was her name he trapped
[1:00:23] Eve causes her to doubt one word every
[1:00:25] time you hear an ambulance whale every
[1:00:27] time you hear you know a a farar go or
[1:00:30] see a funeral procession that is because
[1:00:33] God the devil trapped one
[1:00:36] lady with one word she doubted one word
[1:00:39] it's just how important it is to me to
[1:00:41] believe every word not doubt any of
[1:00:45] it but he trapped Eve and then he he
[1:00:48] went on and he kept he kept trapping
[1:00:49] people and you can you'll be like oh
[1:00:51] yeah I see that so he he trapped Eve
[1:00:53] then he trapped Sam he trapped Samson
[1:00:55] with
[1:00:56] Delilah right a
[1:01:00] woman that he used as a
[1:01:02] bait and then he then he trapped
[1:01:05] David again with what was that lady's
[1:01:09] name basba yeah and then he trapped he
[1:01:13] tried to trap
[1:01:15] Jesus okay and he trapped he he trapped
[1:01:19] Peter but there's no closed season on
[1:01:23] trapping so when brother Dave when we're
[1:01:25] trapping or when you when you trapped
[1:01:27] you had a set time where you could you
[1:01:29] could go and you could trap from let's
[1:01:31] say January 1st I'm making these up okay
[1:01:34] this is an Ohio law don't go out and do
[1:01:36] it so to January to February 30th or
[1:01:39] something like that because that when
[1:01:40] The Furs were the best and but you know
[1:01:42] the devil doesn't care from when you're
[1:01:44] born till the day you die he is going to
[1:01:46] try to trap you and entangle you in his
[1:01:51] traps there is no closed
[1:01:53] season so right now I'm just going to
[1:01:56] make a wild guess somebody in here is
[1:01:59] trying to get
[1:02:00] trapped you say in church John they trap
[1:02:03] in church yes he traps in
[1:02:07] church you said what what do you mean
[1:02:09] he's not you know he's trapping right
[1:02:12] now he's trying to catch your mind and
[1:02:14] take it somewhere
[1:02:15] else I know the pulpe is no place for
[1:02:17] jokes but there was a there was a guy at
[1:02:20] the back he was he was greeting the
[1:02:21] people the the minister he greet all the
[1:02:23] people and they came out the door and
[1:02:26] and the farmer came out and he said well
[1:02:27] thank you he said that was a great
[1:02:29] message Pastor I got my tractor
[1:02:36] fixed so where was his mind during the
[1:02:41] sermon it was fixing his
[1:02:44] tractor because the devil trapped him
[1:02:47] and took his mind somewhere else so he's
[1:02:49] going to take your mind today to what
[1:02:51] you're going to do this week what you
[1:02:52] did last week what you're going to do
[1:02:54] the rest of today or how long is this
[1:02:56] guy going to
[1:02:57] speak and is this really going to be
[1:02:59] worth my time to even listen to him he's
[1:03:02] going to take you and he's going to trap
[1:03:04] you he's going to try trapping you like
[1:03:06] that so I I put quotes up here this is
[1:03:09] just me because in in my line of work I
[1:03:12] try to I try to get in people's
[1:03:14] wheelhouse a little bit and I try to see
[1:03:16] where they're at and and then if I can
[1:03:19] grab them with a couple
[1:03:22] senses like maybe C
[1:03:25] and maybe even smell sometimes and
[1:03:29] hear then I have them I have all their
[1:03:32] attention I can't probably get your
[1:03:34] taste but I can so I put quotes up here
[1:03:37] um and I I it helps me too it takes some
[1:03:39] of the pressure off of me so brother bam
[1:03:43] here is talking about this is off of
[1:03:45] Hebrews chapter 6 he said he that's born
[1:03:48] of God does not commit sin that's right
[1:03:50] he has no desire to do so amen because a
[1:03:53] desire to do so is taken out of us when
[1:03:56] we become a Christian brother B said I
[1:03:59] smoke as much as I want to smoke I drink
[1:04:01] as much as I want to drink I lust as
[1:04:03] much as I want to because I don't have a
[1:04:04] want to anymore certainly the devil will
[1:04:07] trap him here and there but not
[1:04:09] willfully now you if you just want to
[1:04:11] just go through and you know this is
[1:04:13] what I I love you know about these apps
[1:04:16] they come out with you know I can put in
[1:04:17] trap and there's oodles on trap and you
[1:04:20] just go in start look tra trapping
[1:04:22] trapped and just start going through
[1:04:24] those and he says certainly the devil
[1:04:26] will trap him here and there but not
[1:04:27] willfully the Bible said so the devil
[1:04:30] will trap him now and then sure he will
[1:04:31] he tried to throw traps for our lord
[1:04:33] Jesus and he did to Moses and caught him
[1:04:37] and he did to Peter and caught him he
[1:04:40] did to many but Peter even denied him
[1:04:42] but then when he went and wept bitterly
[1:04:43] there was something in him but brother
[1:04:46] Bram said we each have a weak
[1:04:48] point every of us have a weak link and
[1:04:51] we're only as strong as our weakest link
[1:04:54] so I'll I'll I'll have some
[1:04:55] demonstrations today but I had a I had
[1:04:57] this at Camp one year I took I took all
[1:04:59] these uh Links of a chain that were very
[1:05:02] strong chain I had a boy up here and had
[1:05:04] him pulling up another boy and you know
[1:05:06] or lifting and trying to pull it apart
[1:05:07] and then I put dental floss between one
[1:05:10] link of the chain you got the picture
[1:05:14] and so that was the weak link but
[1:05:17] brother bam said that Jesus had a had a
[1:05:19] weak spot it was hunger and that's where
[1:05:21] Satan came to him in the wilderness and
[1:05:23] he said Moses had a weak spot and that
[1:05:25] was his
[1:05:26] temper but wherever your weak spot is
[1:05:29] that is where the devil is going to try
[1:05:30] to trap
[1:05:32] you and and you each one right now know
[1:05:36] where your weak spot is you know what
[1:05:39] you need to keep
[1:05:40] covered and what you can't let get
[1:05:42] exposed to the devil because he's going
[1:05:43] to trap you with
[1:05:46] it okay so you got to keep that weak
[1:05:49] spot
[1:05:50] covered this next one is you know the
[1:05:53] we're we're the devil's out to trap us
[1:05:55] every one of us this age more than any
[1:05:57] other he has got more traps and more
[1:06:00] devices to trap us but now the
[1:06:03] cunningness of the devil now makes the
[1:06:04] people believe they are Christians when
[1:06:06] they're not this is one trick he does
[1:06:10] constantly there is the thing you don't
[1:06:12] have when when they're not there is the
[1:06:14] thing you don't have to seal it's you
[1:06:15] don't have to seal it's it's more
[1:06:17] cunning to day than it wouldn't be then
[1:06:19] when you had to seal your life away with
[1:06:21] your
[1:06:22] testimony now think about it you had to
[1:06:24] say I'm I'm willing to die but it's more
[1:06:27] cunning than that day the devil has set
[1:06:29] every cunning trap he can to he's a
[1:06:32] deceiver that G and Jesus told us in
[1:06:34] Matthew 24 how this day would be that
[1:06:37] we're living in the most deceitful day
[1:06:38] that ever lived so close that it would
[1:06:40] deceive the very elected of God if it
[1:06:42] were possible for him to
[1:06:47] deceive so this next one I'm I'm he's
[1:06:50] talking about the devil kind of goes
[1:06:53] back to the weak point
[1:06:55] where the devil is looking at your weak
[1:06:57] points how many believes he knows
[1:06:59] you some of us even posted on
[1:07:04] Instagram where your weak spot would
[1:07:10] be so it's exposed not just to the devil
[1:07:15] but the whole
[1:07:16] world where you're weak spot
[1:07:21] is and we put that out there likes in
[1:07:23] our dislikes and who we follow
[1:07:29] and but now if you make a mistake and do
[1:07:31] something wrong you don't willfully if
[1:07:33] you're a
[1:07:34] Christian if you're born again Christian
[1:07:36] you don't mean to do wrong your
[1:07:38] intentions and everything is right but
[1:07:39] if you do as she said to her she make
[1:07:41] make a mistake and something wrong well
[1:07:43] God will put it will let just go and go
[1:07:45] on and die like that and be lost or will
[1:07:47] he bring back to reconciliation he will
[1:07:49] bring you back that's right he will
[1:07:52] bring you back and if and then if you do
[1:07:54] anything wrong it don't condemn you and
[1:07:56] you go on like and you go on like that
[1:07:59] out remember you wasn't saved in the
[1:08:01] beginning so I'm just saying you know
[1:08:03] you do a checkup every every time you
[1:08:05] come to church you do a checkup you
[1:08:09] might say no I only do that one time a
[1:08:11] year I go to the doctor and he gives a
[1:08:13] physical exam no every time to come you
[1:08:15] come to church you have a
[1:08:18] checkup and the Lord looks in your ears
[1:08:21] and he sees what you're hearing and he
[1:08:23] look looks in your eyes and sees what
[1:08:25] you're seeing and he looks in your mouth
[1:08:26] and sees what you're saying and he looks
[1:08:29] in your heart and sees what it's
[1:08:31] thinking every time you come to
[1:08:34] church so then he says if you do
[1:08:36] anything wrong it don't condemn you and
[1:08:37] you go on like that and remember you
[1:08:39] wasn't saved at the beginning so I check
[1:08:40] my desires when I come to church did I
[1:08:42] really want to be here did I really when
[1:08:44] I cut that person off or when I said
[1:08:46] this or did that did that come from my
[1:08:48] heart or was that just not willfully
[1:08:52] done you wasn't saved at the beginning
[1:08:54] that's right you wasn't wasn't saved you
[1:08:55] had a make belief you wasn't saved but
[1:08:57] when you're saved you have a different
[1:08:59] Spirit you're a different nature you're
[1:09:00] a new creature in Christ and the old
[1:09:02] things has passed away and they are dead
[1:09:04] and buried in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:09:05] you see but being you're living here in
[1:09:07] the world there's traps set for you
[1:09:11] everywhere and you're walking with your
[1:09:13] eyes on
[1:09:16] yourself this is why I put them up
[1:09:19] here you're walking with your eyes on
[1:09:21] Christ and remember that when you make a
[1:09:27] mistake a real Christian will always
[1:09:30] come back quickly for
[1:09:34] reconciliation so when I'm doing my
[1:09:36] checkup I look at my life and when I say
[1:09:40] something that's wrong or hurtful to my
[1:09:43] wife if you've done that raise your hand
[1:09:46] don't raise your hand David don't raise
[1:09:49] your hand put your arm around her don't
[1:09:51] raise your
[1:09:52] hand
[1:09:55] you come back quickly for
[1:09:59] reconciliation that's how I check my
[1:10:02] heart do I quickly want to repent and
[1:10:05] make it right or do I want to go on like
[1:10:07] everything's
[1:10:09] fine that's part of the
[1:10:12] checkup I know there's some Spanish
[1:10:13] folks in here and about 75% of my
[1:10:17] patients are Spanish so I'll I'll go in
[1:10:19] there AA Saka La lingua you know
[1:10:25] esal laaba you know I'll say all those
[1:10:27] things and you
[1:10:30] knowa you know I usually end with dios
[1:10:32] leenda or I'll say no my my word I
[1:10:35] learned for this week was no prees you
[1:10:38] know no worries no
[1:10:41] worries but when I when I come in and I
[1:10:43] can just do a little bit of that right
[1:10:44] there I got them you know they'll talk
[1:10:46] to me and think I know a little bit more
[1:10:48] Spanish than I do because then they'll
[1:10:49] go on and I'll be like who whoa whoa
[1:10:51] whoa you
[1:10:52] know but when we come in we want to do a
[1:10:56] checkup each time so we're looking for
[1:10:59] our weak link we're looking for our weak
[1:11:01] spot and we're looking where is the
[1:11:04] devil going to try to trap us because we
[1:11:06] want to stay under the shelter of his
[1:11:07] protection and keep our eyes on him okay
[1:11:11] that's the short version if you want to
[1:11:12] go to sleep you
[1:11:18] can you know so this is where people
[1:11:23] want to go sleep they can but I um so
[1:11:26] what I'm going to do here is you know I
[1:11:28] I got to I I do this for the kids and
[1:11:31] then if I can hold you when you're five
[1:11:33] if I can hold your uh attention when
[1:11:35] you're five then I can probably hold you
[1:11:36] when you're
[1:11:37] 85 and so this is what I do at camp and
[1:11:41] so this is where I get to let my hair
[1:11:43] down a little bit and I I get to relax
[1:11:46] and so you just bear with me if if you
[1:11:49] don't want to listen that's okay give me
[1:11:51] a second here I got to get out my
[1:11:54] I think so so how many believe the devil
[1:11:56] tries to trap
[1:11:58] us
[1:12:00] okay okay so we going to get out of G to
[1:12:04] get out one trap here first so this
[1:12:06] would be
[1:12:07] a right right right we we're trying to
[1:12:10] catch muskrats with
[1:12:13] this mice

[1:14:58] game that kids play this is where you're
[1:15:00] if you're 80 85 you're getting educated
[1:15:02] so this is a game kids play and go
[1:15:08] ahead different types of game it's a
[1:15:10] virtual reality game right can't you
[1:15:12] like buy different characters and
[1:15:17] okay the average
[1:15:21] user spends 2.6 hours on this
[1:15:27] game largest age group is 9 to
[1:15:31] 12 67% of the users are under
[1:15:35] 16 56 million people a day log on to
[1:15:39] this and 56 read their
[1:15:44] Bible I made that one
[1:15:51] up that would be a trap for little
[1:15:57] guys and it's made specifically for you
[1:16:00] Jacob or the little girl with her
[1:16:03] daddy's arm around her or you girls that
[1:16:05] are sitting right here it's made for
[1:16:08] you that is the devil's
[1:16:11] trap and I'm not saying Roblox is
[1:16:14] horrible I've never played the game but
[1:16:17] what I'm
[1:16:18] saying is that if you spend all your
[1:16:20] time on it it's a trap
[1:16:27] and it's going to trap you and it's
[1:16:30] going to continue to trap you until it
[1:16:33] got
[1:16:35] you and your mind is
[1:16:39] filled with things that shouldn't be
[1:16:41] filled
[1:16:42] with so fortnite's another one that's
[1:16:45] probably more
[1:16:46] popular kids play fortnite spend a lot
[1:16:49] of their time on it this is where you
[1:16:52] want want to stay under the shelter of
[1:16:55] the protection of your
[1:16:57] parents and where they're going to help
[1:17:00] you avoid
[1:17:03] traps that the devil set for
[1:17:06] you I got on there last night and I was
[1:17:08] just looking it said how do you know if
[1:17:10] your child is addicted to
[1:17:14] Roblox one of the things they said if
[1:17:16] they get mad when you ask them to get
[1:17:19] off and I make this statement at work if
[1:17:21] you want to make a child
[1:17:24] mad take away their
[1:17:27] phone do you want to make an adult
[1:17:33] mad we're doing a kind of a physical
[1:17:36] exam here head to
[1:17:38] toe and we're just looking at where
[1:17:41] we're
[1:17:42] at am I standing up here because I am
[1:17:45] not ever going to be trapped or have
[1:17:46] never been trapped
[1:17:48] no I'm just up here and I say this a lot
[1:17:52] more recently that I'm up here just
[1:17:53] talking to myself and you get to
[1:18:02] listen teens spend an average of 4.8
[1:18:05] hours on social media per
[1:18:08] day 4.8 hours social media Instagram Tik
[1:18:13] Tock YouTube shorts whatever you want
[1:18:16] flavor that's where it is 4.8
[1:18:20] hours Rebecca my wife
[1:18:23] is very good at reading her Bible
[1:18:25] through she will
[1:18:27] spend she's she actually is a witness to
[1:18:30] me because she'll spend two hours every
[1:18:32] morning reading her Bible and she's
[1:18:35] almost done for the
[1:18:37] year if we would spend 4.6 hours we'd
[1:18:39] probably finish in about six months or
[1:18:43] less I challenge you we're getting near
[1:18:45] the end of the year read your Bible
[1:18:47] through am I getting through I'm going
[1:18:49] to try to make it through the New
[1:18:50] Testament so
[1:18:51] John
[1:18:56] you're so busy are you available to
[1:19:01] God
[1:19:03] or is the devil trying to trap
[1:19:08] you so he
[1:19:10] used before you can trap somebody can
[1:19:14] you get that thing yeah so I'm gonna I'm
[1:19:17] going to show a couple other couple
[1:19:18] other ones here so this is called a uh
[1:19:22] this would be called the conab bear trap
[1:19:24] right
[1:19:25] David and this one would be used to trap
[1:19:27] muskrats but you can trap Beaver with it
[1:19:29] you can trap different animals with this
[1:19:32] conab bear trap and what how this one
[1:19:34] works is and I I I I was going to try to
[1:19:36] set it and I thought well I didn't want
[1:19:37] anybody lose their arm so I I did this
[1:19:40] at Camp I did set this so you you um you
[1:19:45] actually this one here needs to be out
[1:19:46] here so it's good I'm not trying to set
[1:19:47] it but you you bring these arms down and
[1:19:50] then you open up the Trap like this like
[1:19:52] a box and then the animal it's an
[1:19:55] underwater set for the most part you're
[1:19:58] trying to catch a muskrat and the
[1:19:59] Muskrat swims through here and hits this
[1:20:03] little bitty bump thing which is the
[1:20:07] trigger and you can spread this out so
[1:20:10] it catches more so he a little muskrat
[1:20:12] couldn't get through there but the
[1:20:14] minute it hits that it then collapses
[1:20:18] these hard Springs and this would be a
[1:20:22] lethal
[1:20:24] trap for the
[1:20:28] Muskrat does the devil have lethal
[1:20:35] traps he does he has lethal traps that
[1:20:39] he sets and so sometimes I'll ask kids
[1:20:42] I'll just go through this and you know
[1:20:44] I'll say to them and maybe I'll repeat
[1:20:46] this tonight so if you're going to be
[1:20:47] here tonight you'll hear it I'll say you
[1:20:49] know what happens if you smoke
[1:20:51] Aaron
[1:20:57] okay
[1:20:58] good that would be a lethal
[1:21:02] trap but it doesn't we don't tell you
[1:21:04] it's a lethal trap right away do we no
[1:21:07] okay what happens if you drink
[1:21:11] alcohol you die very good very good so
[1:21:14] you're getting the idea you don't go
[1:21:15] down liver and then all this and your
[1:21:17] liver enzymes go up and you turn yellow
[1:21:19] and you become addicted and all that
[1:21:21] actually just dump that in there so then
[1:21:25] what happens if you use
[1:21:28] drugs you
[1:21:30] die those would all
[1:21:32] be lethal
[1:21:34] traps conar traps if you will that the
[1:21:38] devil's going to set for you and try to
[1:21:40] get
[1:21:42] you so each one of
[1:21:45] us I remember when I was I'll just give
[1:21:47] this I was
[1:21:50] 13 12 13 I'm I might have been younger I
[1:21:53] probably was I probably was 10 11 and uh
[1:21:56] there was a boy that was not a good
[1:21:58] influence uh that was in the
[1:22:02] neighborhood he lived up the street his
[1:22:04] name was
[1:22:04] Lindsay and he um his dad smoked and he
[1:22:08] brought some cigarettes and said John do
[1:22:10] you want to
[1:22:12] smoke and I can tell you where I was and
[1:22:17] what I did cuz sometimes when you when
[1:22:18] you get caught in a trap you know
[1:22:20] exactly what path you were on when you
[1:22:23] were
[1:22:24] caught okay so some of us are going on
[1:22:26] some trips here in our minds of when we
[1:22:30] were
[1:22:31] caught at whatever age it may be I can
[1:22:35] remember going in the church where we
[1:22:37] have our church today we I lived in a
[1:22:39] parsonage and it was right above the
[1:22:40] church and so we waited for the bus at
[1:22:44] the firehouse I remember a red and white
[1:22:45] fire engine that we could stand in there
[1:22:47] now you probably couldn't stand in there
[1:22:48] we stood in there and he had the
[1:22:50] cigarettes hid and after we got off the
[1:22:51] bus we went up on the mountain the hill
[1:22:53] behind the church there and I tried to
[1:22:57] smoke and uh I felt this Trap
[1:23:00] closing so you know what I you know just
[1:23:03] a mercy of how many love the Lord's
[1:23:05] kindness oh he's so kind he's so kind
[1:23:09] even when we're not kind he's
[1:23:12] kind and so the
[1:23:16] Lord I I was under such conviction that
[1:23:19] I went to
[1:23:21] uh I went to my parents' bedroom that
[1:23:24] night and I said Dad Mom I said my dad I
[1:23:27] said I I tried to smoke and my dad you
[1:23:30] know just wisdom he got down with me and
[1:23:33] we prayed by that bed and I've never
[1:23:35] been bothered by it again but did I
[1:23:39] avoid a lethal
[1:23:41] trap was that path right there in my
[1:23:45] life where I was walking now each of you
[1:23:48] know you can see the Lord's kindness in
[1:23:49] your life or you would not be sitting
[1:23:51] here today
[1:23:53] that's
[1:23:54] kindness that's he recovered you from
[1:23:57] the trap From The
[1:24:00] Snare so I'll ask kids some other
[1:24:03] questions too I might do some of that
[1:24:04] tonight you know but I ask them
[1:24:06] questions but really the end and the end
[1:24:10] was death that's a lethal trap so what
[1:24:14] do you got to have first well number one
[1:24:16] where do you set a trap Brother David
[1:24:18] where do you set your
[1:24:19] traps just anywhere
[1:24:32] right so you pattern the animal right
[1:24:35] you kind of pattern you look at the
[1:24:36] environment they're living in and you
[1:24:37] look where where they might walk in a
[1:24:39] path they might walk on or a slide
[1:24:41] you're saying where they SL where they
[1:24:43] you know more than me muskrats and mink
[1:24:45] go after muskrats and so he's going to
[1:24:47] meet you right where you are and try to
[1:24:49] trap you he's not going to try to trap
[1:24:51] you with one of these
[1:24:53] you know and is he going to try to trap
[1:24:55] trap me with cigarettes no he's going to
[1:24:58] well joh didn't work on John I'm going
[1:24:59] to try a different tactic to get
[1:25:03] him you
[1:25:06] know what happens if you follow a duck
[1:25:11] Aaron think like a duck here think like
[1:25:14] a duck okay what happens if you follow a
[1:25:18] duck they'll lead you to the water okay
[1:25:21] okay what is your name yeah little blond
[1:25:24] her yeah Addie what happens if you
[1:25:27] follow a
[1:25:32] bear yeah could you be eaten by the bear
[1:25:35] Poss possibly okay what happens if you
[1:25:39] well let's just say you see a a uh I'm
[1:25:43] going to just throw this in there for
[1:25:44] you but if you see a boy and he walks
[1:25:47] like a turkey and he acts like a turkey
[1:25:48] and he gobbles like a turkey what is
[1:25:51] he
[1:25:55] turkey very good just remember that
[1:25:57] that's your dad didn't pay me but that's
[1:25:59] just I'm just going to lay that out
[1:26:01] there but if you follow a duck you'll
[1:26:03] probably end up in the water if you hang
[1:26:05] around people that smoke you're probably
[1:26:07] going to end up smoking so how you pick
[1:26:10] your friends is how you pick your future
[1:26:12] you pick good friends you pick a good
[1:26:14] future you pick bad friends you pick a
[1:26:16] bad
[1:26:17] future but it's who you
[1:26:21] follow I don't have my phone on
[1:26:24] me but it's who you
[1:26:28] follow so Instagram how many have 10
[1:26:36] followers Jesus had
[1:26:41] 12 I'm gonna give more I'm one of his
[1:26:43] followers too each one of you are
[1:26:46] too be careful who you follow somebody
[1:26:49] shared with me something last week after
[1:26:50] church and said you know the devil
[1:26:52] doesn't matter how old you are they were
[1:26:53] following this person for some helpful
[1:26:57] homemaking hints or something I don't
[1:26:59] know nobody in here does that I know you
[1:27:02] don't F no sisters don't raise your hand
[1:27:05] you know you followed somebody but you
[1:27:06] know that person she said Devol this
[1:27:08] week that she's a practicing
[1:27:10] witch and she said I was following
[1:27:13] her can you
[1:27:16] say
[1:27:17] trap so be careful who you're following
[1:27:20] because you may end up in the same
[1:27:28] trap so but that next quote up there
[1:27:30] brother BR says and he joined himself a
[1:27:32] citizen of the country and the citizen
[1:27:34] give him two big slop buckets to go slop
[1:27:36] the Hogs think of the place a Jewish boy
[1:27:39] out there slopping hogs in the pig pen
[1:27:41] away from mother away from religion that
[1:27:42] he once had to keep from the Hogs now he
[1:27:44] was rooting that's the way the devil
[1:27:46] will do he'll get you to smoke your
[1:27:48] first
[1:27:51] cigarette telling you there's no harm in
[1:27:53] it you know I'm just going to stop
[1:27:54] because I think we should give God the
[1:27:56] glory you know I've helped a lot of
[1:27:59] people the Lord has helped me help a lot
[1:28:01] of people stop
[1:28:03] smoking and I have a bell in my office
[1:28:05] that I let them ring when they stop
[1:28:07] smoking they come out they ring the bell
[1:28:10] and we shout you say shout yeah I do I
[1:28:13] shout woo they stop smoking brother bam
[1:28:16] said it's a nicotine demon that's right
[1:28:19] let's call it what it
[1:28:21] is that's the way the devil will do he
[1:28:23] get you to smoke your first cigarette
[1:28:24] telling you there's no harm in and after
[1:28:25] a while you're a cigarette fiend he'll
[1:28:27] tell you there's no harm in taking
[1:28:28] sociable sociable drink I've stood them
[1:28:31] before they went to Gallows stood them
[1:28:33] stood by them before they was
[1:28:34] electrocuted and never and I never
[1:28:36] intended they say to be a gambler I
[1:28:38] never intended when I was playing cards
[1:28:39] to be a gambler I never intended to be a
[1:28:41] drunk when I stole the first out of a
[1:28:43] filling station I didn't intend to be a
[1:28:45] thief but the only thing the devil wants
[1:28:47] you to do is start and he'll take you on
[1:28:50] be careful who you're following
[1:28:52] get over on his ground one time and
[1:28:54] watch him you know what it means to do
[1:28:55] wrong but there's an influence of the
[1:28:57] power of Darkness you could preach on
[1:28:59] this for a long time there's let's nail
[1:29:01] it down one two things are pulling you
[1:29:03] there's the power of the above world and
[1:29:05] the power of the
[1:29:07] underworld so when you look at a game or
[1:29:10] you look at Instagram or anything which
[1:29:13] world is pulling
[1:29:15] you we're doing a checkup the prince of
[1:29:17] the power of the air leads you trapped
[1:29:21] leads you trapped into these things
[1:29:22] you've got to stand up separate yourself
[1:29:24] from the things of the world come out
[1:29:25] and live for Christ that's
[1:29:29] right
[1:29:31] so you know the the first thing he'll
[1:29:35] do back up one second here because I I
[1:29:39] think I missed a spot here you forgive
[1:29:41] me yep so he's gonna brother Dave did
[1:29:44] you ever put a bait
[1:29:47] out never
[1:29:50] baited
[1:29:59] would it look like
[1:30:02] this yeah yeah I got this one for you so
[1:30:06] yeah so this is it here so this is this
[1:30:08] is called a this is called a leg hold
[1:30:10] trap
[1:30:11] right pretty pretty you know pretty
[1:30:14] pretty common trap and they'll have
[1:30:16] different sizes so you'll put your feet
[1:30:19] on both sides of it like that you'll
[1:30:21] bring it flip this trigger finger over
[1:30:24] you'll bring that over like that how did
[1:30:26] John lose his finger during that service
[1:30:30] well how did he get his tie in
[1:30:37] it and we got it
[1:30:40] set Paul can you bring that forward so
[1:30:42] we got this one set right and so all the
[1:30:46] animal has to do is put his foot right
[1:30:49] where I'm going to lift this up CU it's
[1:30:51] not going to get me when I do that but
[1:30:52] he had to put his foot right there right
[1:30:55] and then what
[1:30:57] happens actually that bag shouldn't be
[1:30:59] in there Paul you know Paul you're so
[1:31:03] kind but so know the devil's not going
[1:31:05] to say okay so we're going to try
[1:31:08] something here hold
[1:31:13] on
[1:31:15] okay so we got the Trap set there right
[1:31:18] so where don't you want to put your
[1:31:20] foot in the middle right cuz it would
[1:31:23] trap your erand what would it
[1:31:25] trap your leg well your soul
[1:31:30] yeah so I'm gonna put this on the side
[1:31:32] here but he's not going to make he's not
[1:31:34] gonna say hello I'm G to trap you with
[1:31:36] cigarettes today I'm going to track you

[1:31:40] to flash up on your phone today I'm
[1:31:42] going to trap you with a neighbor lady
[1:31:43] not wearing the right clothes I'm going
[1:31:44] to trap you with wearing shorter dresses
[1:31:46] high heel shoes makeup you name the sin
[1:31:49] you name the the symptom he's going to
[1:31:51] try to trap but he's not going to make
[1:31:53] it
[1:31:54] obvious so he's not going to say you
[1:31:56] know when you're trapping Brother David
[1:31:57] you don't just sit down there and say
[1:31:59] okay we're going to try to get the
[1:32:02] coyote today he's going to come down
[1:32:04] this path we're going to get you buddy
[1:32:06] we're going to take your fur off you
[1:32:08] just you step in that thing right there
[1:32:10] how many coyote are going to do that
[1:32:13] come on
[1:32:15] now but what is what is he going to do
[1:32:17] he's going to take his
[1:32:19] trap go ahead Paul bring it here
[1:32:22] so he's going to take his trap and he's
[1:32:24] going to hide the
[1:32:26] Trap do you think when David looked out
[1:32:29] the
[1:32:31] window he thought he was going to be
[1:32:34] trapped when basba kept up the shades do
[1:32:37] you think she thought that she was going
[1:32:39] to be
[1:32:50] bait I thought this Leaf when I was
[1:32:52] walking down from the goats the other
[1:32:53] day yesterday morning actually and I
[1:32:56] thought I'm going to bring that leaf
[1:32:57] with me I don't know why I'll use it but
[1:32:59] that's a beautiful Leaf isn't
[1:33:01] it it's my thoughts but
[1:33:06] so show them the Trap Paul don't shake
[1:33:09] it around just show them the
[1:33:11] Trap so how where's the
[1:33:16] Trap it's hid why is it hid because the
[1:33:20] devil ain't going to tell you
[1:33:24] okay so I'm going to go on another one
[1:33:26] that when you get a
[1:33:27] complex and say I'm not going to go to
[1:33:29] church anymore nobody likes me everybody
[1:33:31] hates
[1:33:34] me I'm just gonna you know he's not
[1:33:37] going to come right out and say you know
[1:33:38] what I'm the devil I'm here to trap you
[1:33:42] but we're going to expose him
[1:33:44] today for what he is Old slewfoot
[1:33:49] Trapper trying to catch you
[1:33:53] you so when this so we won't snap this
[1:33:58] cuz dirt will fly everywhere I've did
[1:33:59] this at Camp I know this for a fact but
[1:34:02] I really don't so Paul maybe we'll leave
[1:34:04] it like that but shall we leave it like
[1:34:07] that you think we should I don't want
[1:34:10] to you don't think it'll
[1:34:13] fly so when the devil maybe that's what
[1:34:16] this leaves for so if we if I put it
[1:34:20] here
[1:34:25] so we've got the foot are there scars
[1:34:27] when you get in
[1:34:32] traps are there scars in your life when
[1:34:34] you get in
[1:34:38] traps how many know what I'm talking
[1:34:41] about I'm glad for a God that's
[1:34:44] big he don't make no
[1:34:48] mistakes even when we're trapped not by
[1:34:52] our own will he makes perpetuation for
[1:34:55] our
[1:34:57] sins I'm thankful for that I'm so
[1:35:00] thankful for that Paul thank you so you
[1:35:04] know those traps though you gotta he'll
[1:35:07] put those that bait out
[1:35:09] there and that's snapped already so I
[1:35:12] don't think you'll get
[1:35:14] caught but he'll put those bait out
[1:35:18] there and try to trap you every day day
[1:35:21] of your
[1:35:22] life
[1:35:25] brother and he's going to set that trap
[1:35:27] right in the path that you walk every
[1:35:31] day David had looked out that window
[1:35:34] many many many
[1:35:42] times so he caught balum with another
[1:35:47] trap the brother said these things get
[1:35:49] ministers but he said get all men
[1:35:52] so he said was women
[1:35:54] was
[1:35:57] Samson and he said it was popularity or
[1:36:00] you know a big name or fame or whatever
[1:36:03] you want to call it he got
[1:36:06] Saul and then he said he
[1:36:08] got balum with
[1:36:12] money but the be devil uses people as
[1:36:15] bait
[1:36:20] sometimes
[1:36:27] many this is off of oh Lord just once
[1:36:30] more many of them them in that drunken
[1:36:33] bra could remember that of Samson but
[1:36:35] what was the matter today he didn't
[1:36:36] there stood Samson but the spirit of the
[1:36:38] Lord didn't come on him no more he
[1:36:40] wasn't anointed he had been stripped of
[1:36:42] his
[1:36:43] power by a woman that lured him away
[1:36:46] from the Commandments of the
[1:36:48] Lord so he's going to strip you of your
[1:36:51] your
[1:36:52] power when he traps you so when when I
[1:36:56] don't have I have it I have I don't have
[1:36:58] it on this one but the Trap he just took
[1:37:00] out there is a little bitty like
[1:37:04] steak and on that steak is a chain and
[1:37:08] it goes to the Trap so you can think
[1:37:10] you're free but he's still got you in
[1:37:13] his jaws and you can go in a
[1:37:16] circle and keep going in that Circle or
[1:37:20] you can chew off your your leg and go
[1:37:23] free but you'll always
[1:37:30] limp you
[1:37:32] know this next quote brother random
[1:37:36] says he's talking about
[1:37:39] people and he says it's be it's
[1:37:43] because they have been caged by
[1:37:45] circumstances radio television
[1:37:47] uncensored programs love stories and
[1:37:49] things of that sort it's captured the
[1:37:50] mind mind of the people and they become
[1:37:53] bondslaves to modern society when they
[1:37:56] was born to be Sons and Daughters of God
[1:37:59] I went into an insane institution one
[1:38:01] time and seen young ladies certain one
[1:38:03] had used a bed pan washed her face in it
[1:38:05] I said whatever happened she was called
[1:38:08] into the service of God but she got
[1:38:09] messed up some boy come along a little
[1:38:11] Slicker and throwed her into a cage of
[1:38:12] worldliness and there she was captured
[1:38:15] and lost her mind her mental faculties
[1:38:16] and was in an institution a few days ago
[1:38:19] standing with another local minister in
[1:38:20] a home where a lovely little girl a
[1:38:23] doctor's daughter who' been spent nearly
[1:38:25] a lot of her life early all of her life
[1:38:26] until she was 30 or 35 years old a
[1:38:28] beautiful girl and her mother called me
[1:38:30] and was weeping and it was a lovely girl
[1:38:32] and to see that some Modern skeptic
[1:38:34] scientist got a hold of that lovely
[1:38:36] child and said you mean to tell me you
[1:38:37] was never kissed by a
[1:38:41] boy that's you got to identify it it's
[1:38:44] the power of the underworld that would
[1:38:45] be that in that scientist that would be
[1:38:46] convincing that girl that she was wrong
[1:38:48] if she's never been kissed by a boy
[1:38:52] you don't know what you've missed and
[1:38:53] begun to place her mind on thinking of
[1:38:56] those things and caged that precious
[1:39:01] eagle and her dear old mother on the
[1:39:03] porch shook my hand and said by God's
[1:39:05] grace she shall be delivered and she
[1:39:07] will but to find that eagle of God who
[1:39:09] soared the Unseen Skies could be caught
[1:39:11] in such a trap the city is full of them
[1:39:14] today I want you to take you over to one
[1:39:16] other scripture because I just think
[1:39:17] it's a good one to memorize because our
[1:39:19] minds now are being taken and captured
[1:39:23] by the devil and we're being trapped in
[1:39:26] our
[1:39:27] minds you say well those other sins
[1:39:29] don't bother me cigarettes smoking and
[1:39:30] you know wearing pants as a as a sister
[1:39:33] that that doesn't bother me but he's
[1:39:34] capturing us in our minds and we're
[1:39:36] going places on our phones where he's
[1:39:38] capturing us and trapping
[1:39:41] us and he doesn't care how he traps you
[1:39:44] as long as he's got
[1:39:45] you so this is Philippians 4:8 it's a
[1:39:49] very familiar scrip scripture it's
[1:39:51] common you've you've heard it many times
[1:39:54] I'm sure your pastors come up here and
[1:39:56] said John or or or quoted this scripture
[1:39:58] it says finally my
[1:40:01] brethren whatsoever things
[1:40:06] are whatsoever things
[1:40:08] are whatsoever things
[1:40:11] are whatsoever things are whatsoever
[1:40:15] things are whatsoever things are
[1:40:18] of if there be any virtue and if there
[1:40:21] be any praise think on these
[1:40:28] things so you know there was a
[1:40:31] person I'd like to show you one other
[1:40:33] trap that's probably the worst trap
[1:40:35] there is out
[1:40:37] there
[1:40:43] okay because a you don't know you're
[1:40:47] trapped because this would be I think it
[1:40:50] says in the Box have a
[1:40:54] heart so this would be called Brother
[1:40:56] David what kind of a
[1:40:58] trap a live trap
[1:41:02] H not a death not a dead trap not a
[1:41:05] lethal trap but it would be
[1:41:07] a live trap
[1:41:10] H if you looked out of this trap could
[1:41:12] you think you're free could you think it
[1:41:15] you know or would you be captured by him
[1:41:17] and taken where he wants at his
[1:41:19] will
[1:41:22] read our scripture again it
[1:41:27] said and they that and that they may
[1:41:30] recover themselves out of the snare of
[1:41:31] the devil who are taken captive by him
[1:41:34] at his
[1:41:35] will so this trap here just for
[1:41:39] education purposes would be would be you
[1:41:41] would set it like
[1:41:44] this and you look in through there you
[1:41:47] put a bait back in here corn hamburger
[1:41:51] french fries whatever you want to put
[1:41:52] back there peanut
[1:41:53] butter the animal would walk
[1:41:56] in he'd step on this trap thing here and
[1:42:00] then you would take him to some
[1:42:02] unknowing Farmers field where he would
[1:42:04] have thousands of
[1:42:06] groundhogs anybody in here ever done
[1:42:08] that no we got sisters don't raise your
[1:42:12] hands on
[1:42:15] these but you did you take the groundhog
[1:42:18] where he didn't want to
[1:42:19] go
[1:42:22] further than he wanted to be away from
[1:42:25] his family alienated him poor groundhog
[1:42:30] no that's what the devil's going to do
[1:42:32] to you he'll put you in this live trap
[1:42:35] and he'll take you farther than you want
[1:42:37] to go to a place you've never been
[1:42:39] before and then you wake up and wonder
[1:42:41] how did I ever get
[1:42:43] here in a live
[1:42:48] trap Joseph
[1:42:51] in the
[1:42:52] Bible was an amazing
[1:42:55] man you know
[1:42:57] why because he didn't allow his
[1:43:00] circumstances of his life to trap
[1:43:03] him in his mind or in his
[1:43:07] body he was a prisoner of Jesus
[1:43:13] Christ sold by your brothers into
[1:43:15] slavery could you have
[1:43:19] hate could that put you in a trap of
[1:43:22] hate yeah yeah sure it
[1:43:25] could could you could you could it give
[1:43:27] you a complex nobody loves me everybody
[1:43:29] hates me yeah my brothers my own
[1:43:32] Brothers put me in a put me in a hole in
[1:43:36] the ground and sold me into slavery and
[1:43:39] where I didn't want to
[1:43:41] go then he was accused
[1:43:44] falsely with Piper's wife that was a
[1:43:47] trap he knew that was a lethal one
[1:43:49] didn't he he he knew that was a lethal
[1:43:51] trap because he knew it would lead to
[1:43:53] death so he got out of it left his coat
[1:43:56] and ran Aaron
[1:44:02] right if a girl looks like a wolf and
[1:44:05] sounds like a wolf and has fangs like a
[1:44:07] wolf she's probably a very
[1:44:12] good you don't have to pay for those but
[1:44:14] hopefully you'll remember
[1:44:18] him cuz he's seeking whom he
[1:44:24] may Joseph then could he have gotten a
[1:44:28] more of a just depression could he have
[1:44:31] anybody in here don't raise your hands
[1:44:34] ever been
[1:44:41] depressed you're accused of raping a
[1:44:45] woman or whatever and you're thrown into
[1:44:48] prison and it wasn't like the the county
[1:44:51] prison here and it wasn't like the
[1:44:52] Hilton or wherever else those other
[1:44:54] prisons are around here it was the
[1:44:56] dirtiest of Prisons they didn't care
[1:44:58] there was no social media for them to
[1:45:00] post what the prison conditions were
[1:45:06] like and then he actually discerned the
[1:45:10] Baker and the Butler and then they
[1:45:11] didn't let him go they forgot about him
[1:45:14] nobody loves
[1:45:15] me did he let those
[1:45:19] circumstances of his family cage him did
[1:45:23] he let the circumstances of his prison
[1:45:25] cage
[1:45:27] him
[1:45:28] no he refused the
[1:45:33] cage he refused to be caged by the Devil
[1:45:35] by his own thoughts or by his depression
[1:45:39] anxiety Suicidal
[1:45:41] Thoughts homicidal
[1:45:45] thoughts he didn't allow that to cage
[1:45:48] him he refused the cage cage I am
[1:45:53] free he was not a bond slave to
[1:45:58] sin
[1:46:03] so you know we we're going to be this
[1:46:09] cage
[1:46:13] is the devil's going to put a bait out
[1:46:16] here or a box that he's going to try to
[1:46:18] trap you with so there was a my son lost
[1:46:21] his phone he was working at a farm and
[1:46:22] he lost it in this big pile of feed and
[1:46:24] corn and he had an and so it thousands
[1:46:27] of you know bushels of corn and he
[1:46:30] couldn't find it so he had an insurance
[1:46:31] policy on his phone so Lincoln came home
[1:46:35] we ordered him a new
[1:46:36] phone I think it was still going to cost
[1:46:38] us some money and and so then he went
[1:46:42] back and the farmer a really nice man
[1:46:45] great family that we good friends and
[1:46:50] they he found the
[1:46:51] phone and so we had already ordered the
[1:46:54] phone so a UPS man shows up at our
[1:46:57] house with a phone and I was kind of
[1:47:01] watching for him because I wanted to
[1:47:02] refuse the
[1:47:05] delivery so as he I hear the truck come
[1:47:09] because we have a dog that barks and so
[1:47:10] she's barking up a storm and I I run
[1:47:13] down there and I I I run out to the
[1:47:14] front front porch and I yell down I said
[1:47:17] the guy yells back as he's jumping on
[1:47:19] the truck he's I left it under the tree
[1:47:22] he was afraid to come up because of the
[1:47:23] dog and so and I yell back I don't want
[1:47:29] it and I run back down and he made me
[1:47:32] sign a paper refused
[1:47:35] delivery now brother B talks about this
[1:47:37] many times the box of rattlesnakes but
[1:47:40] when depression Comes Your Way refuse
[1:47:42] the cage refuse the
[1:47:44] delivery when the complex of nobody
[1:47:47] likes me anxiety depression whatever it
[1:47:50] is is the family I'm born into the
[1:47:53] whatever refuse the
[1:47:58] cage
[1:48:00] even if it's
[1:48:04] sickness my backs bother me today it's
[1:48:10] not I can't see quite like I used
[1:48:14] to whatever that is whatever it is I am
[1:48:18] the Lord that Health just some of the
[1:48:20] bad
[1:48:21] diseases I am the Lord that Health
[1:48:26] all
[1:48:28] everything refuse the cage of
[1:48:30] sickness refuse the cage of
[1:48:35] complexes refuse all the
[1:48:38] cages and be
[1:48:41] free so there was
[1:48:43] uh you know brother bam says on a one
[1:48:47] quote he says now one day the human race
[1:48:49] was in a trap
[1:48:52] but then we had a great deliverer come
[1:48:56] so how do people get out of this trap
[1:48:57] how do you get people out of this trap
[1:48:59] how do you get people out of that leg
[1:49:00] hold trap somebody's got to step on the
[1:49:02] Trap and release
[1:49:05] you when you sisters took this
[1:49:08] groundhog to the farm Somebody went like
[1:49:12] that and left him go free and that was
[1:49:15] the Lord Jesus for you and me it was a
[1:49:17] dual covenant it was the double cure it
[1:49:19] was a sure cure it not only your sins
[1:49:22] but your
[1:49:25] sickness that blood is there for our
[1:49:29] sins and our sickness so that we don't
[1:49:30] have to be
[1:49:33] caged so if they'll come to the
[1:49:34] instruments I want to just end with
[1:49:36] one story that brother brandham
[1:49:40] told and I didn't get to really my
[1:49:42] points if you if you are in a trap you
[1:49:44] know we talked about getting
[1:49:46] free you know how to get free from a
[1:49:49] trap
[1:49:54] brother B says
[1:49:58] here this is the quotes up there he says
[1:50:02] he says the Lamb's Book of Life he says
[1:50:03] there's traps all along the road sure
[1:50:05] the devil will cause you to stumble and
[1:50:07] you say I didn't mean to do
[1:50:10] that when I hear Brother B say something
[1:50:13] like that that's the first thing I went
[1:50:14] out of my mouth if I get caught in a
[1:50:15] trap I didn't mean to do that Lord
[1:50:18] another one he says here he says the
[1:50:20] devil got a trap setting there but you
[1:50:21] got Grace to come back if you're a real
[1:50:23] Christian say I was
[1:50:29] wrong if you'll go to the last
[1:50:32] quote this is one of my favorite quotes
[1:50:35] it's just it's the very last one that's
[1:50:38] the one that says I was wrong go to the
[1:50:40] last one how many you know sometimes
[1:50:44] ignorantly you'll you'll fall in a trap
[1:50:47] you'll find yourself in a situation
[1:50:49] brother B said how could could we how we
[1:50:50] could go into details and that and break
[1:50:52] that down of how that it makes
[1:50:54] intercession for our
[1:50:56] ignorance this is what I
[1:50:59] love sometimes we got the Holy Ghost we
[1:51:01] ignorantly stagger some sometime
[1:51:03] something the holy spirit's there to
[1:51:05] make advocate for us he's our advocator
[1:51:06] he stands there he's our attorney he
[1:51:09] stands there and pleads for us we don't
[1:51:10] plead for oursel because the Holy Ghost
[1:51:12] is in US pleads for us the Holy Spirit
[1:51:14] giving utterance sometimes with words
[1:51:16] that you can't understand he makes
[1:51:17] intercession for us that's what the Holy
[1:51:20] Ghost is when I walk into anything I
[1:51:23] walk like a little
[1:51:26] kid you walk like a little fellow when
[1:51:28] you're walking in a dark world full of
[1:51:30] enemies full of sin full of
[1:51:33] traps full of everything you say I'm
[1:51:35] afraid I'm afraid to take Christian Life
[1:51:37] I'm afraid to do this I'm afraid I'll do
[1:51:38] this don't be afraid we have an
[1:51:43] advocate amen oh he stands by us he's in
[1:51:46] us he makes intercession for us and the
[1:51:48] Holy Spirit constantly
[1:51:50] constantly making advocate for us all
[1:51:53] the
[1:51:57] time so that they'll come to the
[1:51:58] instruments I want to tell One More
[1:52:00] Story that brother brandham told not too
[1:52:01] far from
[1:52:02] here he told about the
[1:52:06] eagle in the Cincinnati
[1:52:10] Zoo he said that eagle was caged by
[1:52:15] men and put there and he was beat in his
[1:52:19] head on the cage so that it was blood
[1:52:22] and bl bloody and blood was running down
[1:52:24] and he said then he would roll back his
[1:52:26] eyes and look at the heavenlies where he
[1:52:28] was made to
[1:52:33] fly he also talks about the eagle that
[1:52:37] was born in the chicken yard you may say
[1:52:38] well I'm caged by my family by my
[1:52:40] circumstances there's a bunch of
[1:52:41] chickens around me he said just jump and
[1:52:45] get on the post and then he said jump a
[1:52:46] little bit higher and go
[1:52:48] free but but that bird that was caged he
[1:52:51] said there's a worse sight he said it's
[1:52:53] sons and daughters that were made to be
[1:52:55] free Daughters of God and they're caged
[1:52:58] by
[1:53:02] sin and then he makes a
[1:53:06] statement 1960 says as Eagle stth he
[1:53:09] said give me Eagle thoughts give me
[1:53:12] Eagle desires give me Eagle
[1:53:18] life that's what I want
[1:53:20] I don't want to be caged I don't want to
[1:53:22] be in a live cage I don't want to be in
[1:53:24] a death cage I don't want to be in a leg
[1:53:26] old trap I Want to Be Free how many want
[1:53:30] to be
[1:53:30] free I want to be free I want to fly the
[1:53:33] heavenlies I want to have Eagle
[1:53:36] desires I want to have an eagle thoughts
[1:53:39] I want to have an eagle life I don't
[1:53:42] want to be
[1:53:43] trapped let's just bow our
[1:53:48] heads Heavenly Father father
[1:53:51] we kind of chopped up Lord our thoughts
[1:53:56] and we believe the people got the
[1:53:58] message Lord that in you we're
[1:54:02] free no matter what kind of trap the
[1:54:05] devil's put us in that cage in our mind
[1:54:07] or on our leg or on our lungs or
[1:54:10] whatever part of our body he's tried to
[1:54:12] trap us Lord our eyes our ears if we're
[1:54:15] listening to the wrong music Lord
[1:54:17] whatever it is we believe you came to
[1:54:19] set us
[1:54:24] free Lord reminds me of one other story
[1:54:26] about Johnny
[1:54:28] Crow and the crows would fly south and
[1:54:31] say fly with us Johnny come South and he
[1:54:33] said I can't I'm trapped I'm tied up
[1:54:35] here to this but then one day kind
[1:54:37] farmer came and released the the string
[1:54:40] but you know what he didn't know he was
[1:54:41] free so he kept on going in that same
[1:54:44] Circle not knowing that he was
[1:54:47] free Lord we're so happy happy that you
[1:54:50] sent us a prophet in our day to tell us
[1:54:53] about you Lord and how you came to make
[1:54:55] us prisoners of you we don't want to be
[1:54:58] prisoners of Satan we want to believe
[1:55:00] every word we don't want to be trapped
[1:55:02] like Eve where we would doubt your word
[1:55:04] we don't want to be trapped like Samson
[1:55:06] Lord with a woman we don't want to be
[1:55:08] trapped like balum with
[1:55:10] money or like Joseph Lord he wasn't
[1:55:12] trapped by his circumstances Lord he was
[1:55:15] free to serve you as a son of
[1:55:18] God
[1:55:21] we love you
[1:55:22] Lord Lord we stand before us Lord before
[1:55:25] you asking you to put the foot on the
[1:55:29] devil's neck Lord and open up that trap
[1:55:33] for everyone in here from the youngest
[1:55:36] to the oldest Lord if they're trapped by
[1:55:38] anything whether it be something in
[1:55:40] their mind a thought the devil would
[1:55:43] plant there we want to think on these
[1:55:45] things or if it would be sickness Lord
[1:55:48] we know that you came to overcome come
[1:55:50] everything and by your stripes we are
[1:55:54] healed we love you
[1:55:56] Lord we're so thankful that you set us
[1:56:01] free and we're so thankful Lord that
[1:56:04] your kindness to us that when we do fall
[1:56:06] into a trap that you've given us a heart
[1:56:10] that wants quick
[1:56:11] reconciliation to say I'm sorry I was
[1:56:15] wrong Lord humble us Lord help us to say
[1:56:19] quickly
[1:56:20] and go the other way say sorry Lord or
[1:56:23] whatever it would need to be may we go
[1:56:25] to those that we've harmed or said
[1:56:26] anything wrong Lord we don't want to be
[1:56:29] in a trap Lord of bitterness or hate
[1:56:33] anything like that Lord we want love in
[1:56:35] our hearts for everyone so we pray you'd
[1:56:38] come
[1:56:39] and make yourself known to us Lord thank

[2:04:19] [Music]
[2:04:25] [Music]
[2:04:30] when I think about being free there's a
[2:04:33] gentleman in our church Brother
[2:04:35] Sam and he's a Korean War veteran and
[2:04:39] his birthday I think's today he's
[2:04:42] 90 we took him one time down to the
[2:04:45] Washington DC Korean
[2:04:47] memorial and there's a a bunch of
[2:04:49] soldiers
[2:04:50] there like statues but they have a wall
[2:04:54] there and on that wall it says
[2:04:57] freedom is not
[2:05:00] free because Brother Sam gave the best
[2:05:03] years of his life as a marine so that I
[2:05:07] can be free today worship like I want to
[2:05:10] in America nobody can tell me that I
[2:05:13] can't believe in a prophet nobody can
[2:05:15] tell me how I have to live except the
[2:05:17] Lord Jesus that freedom is not free
[2:05:20] Brother Sam gave the best years of his
[2:05:22] life but it is free if I'll accept it
[2:05:25] from the Lord Jesus Hallelujah so if you
[2:05:28] want to be free today and you say well
[2:05:29] you know what I don't think I can oh
[2:05:32] that freedom that was paid by the blood
[2:05:34] on Calvary Hallelujah you might say I
[2:05:36] got a sickness that was paid as well by
[2:05:38] the stripes a Roman soldier put on his
[2:05:40] back it's free but it wasn't free cuz a
[2:05:45] son gave his life for me I'm so thankful
[2:05:49] for that aren't you I'm thankful for
[2:05:51] Freedom my American freedom but I'm
[2:05:54] thankful for my spiritual
[2:05:56] Freedom cuz I know when I leave this
[2:05:58] world they'll put me in a in in the
[2:06:02] dirt if I don't see the Rapture but one
[2:06:06] day I'll go free you want that insurance
[2:06:10] and you've never given your heart to the
[2:06:12] Lord there's no better day to go
[2:06:16] free if there's even the little I do a
[2:06:19] thing I shouldn't tell I do a little
[2:06:21] thing when I call I have all these kids
[2:06:23] with calls up here all to get them duck
[2:06:26] calls Goose calls deer calls elk calls
[2:06:29] raccoon calls all to tell them God is
[2:06:32] calling you he went throughout the
[2:06:34] garden and he said Adam where are you we
[2:06:37] didn't go through the garden saying
[2:06:39] Where's God but he's calling you if he's
[2:06:42] knocking at your door all you have to do
[2:06:45] is open who controls the door who
[2:06:47] controls the door
[2:06:49] do we do we are on the inside we can
[2:06:53] push it open and let him in I want him
[2:06:54] in I want him in every room don't
[2:06:57] you let's just bow our heads once again
[2:07:00] Lord Jesus we're so thankful that you
[2:07:02] called
[2:07:04] us we open the door to you
[2:07:07] Lord sometimes we not willfully but
[2:07:09] we'll be trapped Lord but you've sprung
[2:07:12] every trap may you make the way before
[2:07:14] us as it we're lion minds or anything in
[2:07:16] front of us Lord just cause them to be
[2:07:20] obliterated Lord help us to stay under
[2:07:23] the protection of your wings help us to
[2:07:25] think Eagle thoughts Eagle desires and
[2:07:28] live an eagle life Lord Fly Above the
[2:07:30] world in the chicken Barnard and all the
[2:07:32] manure we want to live above that help
[2:07:35] us to do that Lord we pray we love you
[2:07:38] father each
[2:07:39] one in Jesus name
[2:07:42] amen thank you for your kindness brother
[2:07:45] Samuel if you'll
[2:07:47] come
[2:07:52] [Music]
[2:08:05] have to be careful you don't want to
[2:08:07] step in a
[2:08:10] trap how many enjoyed the word of the
[2:08:17] Lord
[2:08:20] you know the one thing about it as
[2:08:21] brother John was speaking expressing
[2:08:24] there even at the
[2:08:26] end it doesn't matter how
[2:08:29] long that you've been in that
[2:08:31] trap what's important is that when you
[2:08:33] recognize that you're in a
[2:08:35] trap recognize that it's God who's made
[2:08:38] you aware of the Trap you're in and that
[2:08:41] his grace is
[2:08:45] [Music]
[2:08:47] sufficient you realize that even when
[2:08:50] brother Bram talked about that complex
[2:08:52] that he had
[2:08:53] formed brother Bram himself he couldn't
[2:08:56] get himself out of
[2:08:58] that but he first I recognized
[2:09:02] it God helped him to see because without
[2:09:06] the
[2:09:07] Lord you or I can't see the traps we
[2:09:10] can't even recognize sometimes the Trap
[2:09:14] that we're in it's true as brother John
[2:09:17] was saying we can smoking drinking some
[2:09:19] of those things we could set and it's
[2:09:22] very those could be seemingly obvious in
[2:09:26] the sense where you would be in your
[2:09:28] walk with God but remember the only
[2:09:31] reason that's obvious to you now is
[2:09:34] because where God's Grace has brought
[2:09:35] you
[2:09:38] to and so Satan never stops he studies
[2:09:43] brother Bram said it like this in the
[2:09:44] message the contest he studies us
[2:09:50] now you think if there were people years
[2:09:52] ago probably over 12 years ago when
[2:09:54] talking with the young people and we
[2:09:56] were talking about the ways that Satan
[2:09:59] comes in his approach to enticement if
[2:10:02] there was a company in Canada that in
[2:10:05] order to see these this is what
[2:10:07] advertisers do to see how could they
[2:10:10] increase sales in a
[2:10:13] mall now they didn't say let all the
[2:10:16] wives come
[2:10:17] out they wanted to know how do we
[2:10:19] increase the
[2:10:21] cells they found if they can pump
[2:10:25] certain Aromas through the ventilation
[2:10:30] systems what will have an effect and so
[2:10:32] then they watched after they put that
[2:10:34] through they watched the effect on the
[2:10:37] data that came from that then they
[2:10:40] determined what they could put in there
[2:10:44] in the systems and people are walking
[2:10:46] and not even aware that that even that
[2:10:49] having an
[2:10:51] effect I tell you
[2:10:53] Satan he's more advanced than what all
[2:10:56] of them
[2:10:57] are but we're not to fear him to be
[2:10:59] afraid of Satan but we are to give
[2:11:02] reverence to God and as we fear the lord
[2:11:05] a holy reverence a rightful reverence a
[2:11:08] reverence to him to his word then God
[2:11:11] will lead us God will direct us God will
[2:11:15] help us just like brother John was
[2:11:17] saying you know I don't
[2:11:19] know how many of you have had to do one
[2:11:21] of those virtual things over an iPad or
[2:11:24] whatever I went into a clinic the one
[2:11:26] time and they wanted to I walked in and
[2:11:28] here's a receptionist setting there and
[2:11:30] she flipped one of these things in front
[2:11:31] of
[2:11:32] me why can't you take why can't you take
[2:11:35] care of me I don't I didn't know I
[2:11:37] didn't know if this was a person
[2:11:38] somewhere else or it's an AI I I really
[2:11:40] didn't know be honest with
[2:11:42] you and uh they're talking to me I'm
[2:11:45] thinking all you have to do is take my
[2:11:46] card and
[2:11:49] but you know there was a lady that I
[2:11:52] went to a nurse practitioner and she saw
[2:11:53] me but you know what's hard it's hard to
[2:11:55] do virtual
[2:11:58] checkups that's why it's important in
[2:12:00] being in the house of
[2:12:01] God in everything because there's things
[2:12:04] that as it comes down to it's us taking
[2:12:07] the
[2:12:08] word and letting the word examine our
[2:12:10] own
[2:12:11] lives that's God's care for us that's
[2:12:15] his love I tell you and you want to
[2:12:17] think about how much that God loves you
[2:12:20] how much God cares for you look how he
[2:12:21] comes so personally once again this
[2:12:26] morning that's his
[2:12:28] love when he comes and makes known of a
[2:12:31] trap or a situation my then his grace to
[2:12:35] help us to lead us right out and you
[2:12:38] know what it all starts with you say
[2:12:39] brother Samuel how does it begin with
[2:12:41] the loosening and the
[2:12:43] freedom it begins with first of all
[2:12:46] agreeing with the word what he has said
[2:12:49] and to
[2:12:51] accept his pardoning grace to accept
[2:12:55] freedom and say I'm not going to stay in
[2:12:58] this any longer because the son hath
[2:13:01] made me free the Lord Jesus has spoke to
[2:13:06] me he spoke to my heart and look
[2:13:11] look what brother John read there out of
[2:13:13] the prodical son that quote where it
[2:13:15] talked about the cigarette talked about
[2:13:17] if the devil can just get you one time
[2:13:20] he'll take you
[2:13:23] on Satan is an
[2:13:26] impersonator he's a copycat he's not an
[2:13:30] originator he's a perverter so if all
[2:13:33] satan needs to get you to do is start
[2:13:35] one little thing and then he'll take you
[2:13:37] on let's flip that let's flip that if
[2:13:42] all God can get you to do is begin to
[2:13:45] say
[2:13:46] yes to begin to to agree with the word
[2:13:49] of God he will take you
[2:13:53] on I'm telling you he's greater than the
[2:13:56] Trap of all your failures in your mind
[2:14:00] all your failed attempts he's
[2:14:02] [Music]
[2:14:04] greater he's more than
[2:14:09] enough you say how do you know because
[2:14:12] I've tried him I've proved him over and
[2:14:16] over again he's a God who sets
[2:14:21] free he's a God who delivers from
[2:14:25] traps how do you know I've tried
[2:14:28] him I've experienced
[2:14:32] that it's like brother John could say
[2:14:34] who's done this and he said don't raise
[2:14:36] your hand every one of us with complexes
[2:14:39] thinking and on and on and on and on and
[2:14:42] on but God's grace it reaches to where
[2:14:46] we're at
[2:14:48] I tell you this morning I say thank you
[2:14:51] [Music]
[2:14:52] Jesus thank you
[2:14:55] Lord just even the simplest of things
[2:14:58] how that brother John brought that I
[2:15:00] mean how many of us ever thought of it
[2:15:01] that way before setting in the
[2:15:04] church and here we've already solved
[2:15:06] next week's
[2:15:08] problems we've already solved everything
[2:15:10] that's going on and just a little
[2:15:12] thought that comes that way let me just
[2:15:15] tell you that's not just a thought it's
[2:15:18] Satan trying to get your mind off of
[2:15:20] something and it's it's innocent it's
[2:15:21] Innocent but if he can just get your
[2:15:23] mind away enough from what God has for
[2:15:26] you because Satan has looked over the
[2:15:29] shoulder of Brother John he knows what's
[2:15:33] purposed in this meeting this morning
[2:15:35] and for this
[2:15:37] evening so you think he's not going to
[2:15:39] try to distract but he's he's afraid
[2:15:42] because he knows you as a Believer as
[2:15:44] soon as you just consent to the word and
[2:15:46] say yes Lord I believe Satan is
[2:15:50] powerless cuz it's already done it's
[2:15:53] already done you love him amen let's
[2:15:57] just stand
[2:16:00] together this evening at Lord willing at
[2:16:03] 5:30 we'll have
[2:16:05] the the youth service here and my
[2:16:07] goodness
[2:16:09] I'm I'm just looking forward to it I'm
[2:16:12] looking forward to what the Lord is
[2:16:14] going to speak to us hallelujah I want
[2:16:17] you to be in prayer for Brother John
[2:16:19] will you do that be in prayer for
[2:16:21] Brother John be in prayer for the young
[2:16:24] people only here our young people but
[2:16:27] all that will be coming in we just want
[2:16:29] the Lord to have his way I tell you to
[2:16:32] me what a tremendous thing even in a
[2:16:35] youth service God turn around and take a
[2:16:36] hold of a life that might be 70 years
[2:16:38] old doesn't matter the gospel is to
[2:16:43] reach our
[2:16:44] hearts and it brings
[2:16:46] results the the lovely Lord Jesus is he
[2:16:50] good to us he's real good there's nobody
[2:16:54] like
[2:16:55] Jesus no one let's just bow our heads in
[2:16:58] order
[2:16:59] prayer Heavenly
[2:17:01] Father what a privilege it is
[2:17:05] Lord to be in your presence here this
[2:17:08] [Music]
[2:17:11] morning Lord I'm
[2:17:13] sure this is
[2:17:15] not a message Lord that we've heard
[2:17:18] today
[2:17:19] that would flee or Fleet from our minds
[2:17:23] or our
[2:17:24] hearts visually the things Lord and how
[2:17:27] you would take the gift and we thank you
[2:17:29] for the gift that you placed there in

[2:17:32] life Lord through this here this
[2:17:35] morning Lord I've been
[2:17:38] helped we've been helped

[2:17:47] fallen into our hearts and our
[2:17:51] lives God to take
[2:17:53] it as your Prophet said to nurture these
[2:17:57] things in our hearts
[2:17:59] Lord and to obey them with Godly
[2:18:02] discipline and
[2:18:04] reverence oh God may you just continue

[2:18:24] here this morning Lord that God would
[2:18:27] make willingly a choice just to no
[2:18:29] matter the circumstance to leave Lord
[2:18:32] without
[2:18:34] accepting that
[2:18:36] freedom that you made a way for that we
[2:18:39] could have Lord whatever the need
