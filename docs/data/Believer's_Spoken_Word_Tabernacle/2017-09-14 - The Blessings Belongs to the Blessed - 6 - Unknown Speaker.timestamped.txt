[30:23] amen amen let's read in Genesis chapter
[30:26] 28 tonight
[30:40] we'll read a few vers of scripture then
[30:42] we'll just let you have your
[30:45] seats in Genesis chapter 28 verse
[30:56] one
[30:58] and Isaac called Jacob and blessed him
[31:02] and charged him and said unto him Thou
[31:05] shalt not take a wife of the daughters
[31:07] of
[31:08] Canaan arise and go to pandam to the
[31:13] house of bethu thy mother's father and
[31:16] take thee a wife from thin of the
[31:17] daughters of laan thy mother's brother
[31:21] and God Almighty bless thee and make
[31:24] thee fruitful and multiply thee that
[31:27] thou mayest be a multitude of people and
[31:30] give thee The Blessing of Abraham to
[31:33] thee and to thy seed with thee that thou
[31:36] mayest inherit the land wherein thou art
[31:39] a stranger which God gave unto Abraham
[31:43] and Isaac sent away Jacob and he went to
[31:46] padam onto laan son of bethuel the
[31:49] Syrian the brother of Rebecca Jacob's
[31:53] and Esau's mother may God bless the
[31:56] reading of his word bless as you're
[31:57] being
[31:59] seated you know sometimes you we come
[32:03] into times
[32:06] and you as I've said often to you
[32:09] sometimes the journey the way that God
[32:10] will take us into the scripture I I
[32:13] don't desire even though there might be
[32:16] wonderful things within the word I I
[32:18] don't desire to labor in an area that
[32:21] God would desire us to move on because
[32:24] it's true every little point we could
[32:27] labor on and there is so much within
[32:30] each within in each point in every verse
[32:32] but what's significant and what's
[32:34] important is that God we allow God just
[32:37] to be able to give to us what he knows
[32:40] that we have need of at this appointed
[32:43] time and when I I look at this and you
[32:46] know we've been just thinking of this of
[32:49] being led beside the Still Waters and
[32:51] there's just been many things over even
[32:53] through the year and just looking at how
[32:55] God would so lay in just the real truth
[32:58] and reality of of what real true
[33:01] election is and then to be able to look
[33:04] into the word and be able to to see
[33:07] ourselves in the word and then to see
[33:09] how that God would direct us here with
[33:11] looking at at Jacob's life and you know
[33:14] brother Bram will make the statement
[33:16] throughout the message in the earlier
[33:18] parts and the Masterpiece as well and he
[33:20] said anybody reads about Jacob you can
[33:22] see God's grace you know it's God's
[33:25] grace and when thing that when we look
[33:27] at the grace of God grace is is that
[33:30] which is not merited by anything it's
[33:35] not anything that could ever be merited
[33:37] but Grace itself is is that which God he
[33:41] provides that that for us that we might
[33:44] know what is the acceptable way and how
[33:47] that we might walk pleasing to him
[33:50] that's Grace that's the grace of God
[33:51] provided but then to receive that Grace
[33:54] is another thing because to receive
[33:56] receive it is then to become a partaker
[33:59] of it and then to become an expression
[34:01] or a trophy of that Grace because it's
[34:04] to let God's grace have its work in our
[34:07] life and we know that the grace of God
[34:09] is Not powerless it contrary to what is
[34:13] been painted not just in this day but
[34:16] you know in time but you know the the
[34:18] scripture picked this up right away in
[34:20] Jude chapter 1 when it said that there
[34:22] were certain men who crept in unaware it
[34:24] didn't say Brethren crept in it said
[34:26] certain men crept in unawares and it
[34:29] said it turned the grace turning the
[34:31] grace of God into
[34:35] lasciviousness into where it be where
[34:37] the God's grace is no longer something
[34:39] that is pure and righteous and holy and
[34:42] and has power in it but rather it's just
[34:45] something that is just maybe looked at
[34:48] as just extended that you can continue
[34:50] on in the way that you are and God
[34:52] doesn't see you and God just loves you
[34:54] but if God loves me so much surely he
[34:56] will won't leave me in the condition I'm
[34:58] in surely he'll deal with my heart and
[35:01] draw me to a place to where that I can
[35:03] come into that place that he is longing
[35:06] for me and that's what God's love does
[35:08] God's love reaches out to me to speak to
[35:12] me and then when his love has come to a
[35:15] place to where his love can do no more
[35:17] his grace steps in because Grace is that
[35:21] part of God's love that moves forth to
[35:24] bring into manifestation what love has
[35:27] called for I tell you friends there's no
[35:30] way for us to come into expression
[35:32] outside of God's grace reaching down in
[35:35] our life and to think of it how in this
[35:37] hour where it it speaks that in this
[35:39] time where they showed the candlesticks
[35:42] there you know to to that of uh there
[35:44] when Zachariah and is asking Zachariah
[35:46] what do you see Zachariah and Zachariah
[35:49] said I don't know you tell me what I'm
[35:51] looking at uh you know and that's the
[35:53] thing that I believe that in this hour
[35:55] that God has come to do is to speak to a
[35:58] group of people who don't want to try to
[36:00] take their own idea about things but
[36:02] they're willing to say Lord you tell me
[36:04] what I'm looking at you tell me and help
[36:07] me to see what I'm seeing I I see this
[36:09] these candlesticks I I see this but you
[36:12] know us what are these things and God
[36:15] begins to speak to Zachariah and one
[36:17] thing that we can see within it is God
[36:20] is letting Zachariah know that all
[36:22] things that are to be done and will be
[36:25] done from the very laying of the
[36:27] foundation stone to the bringing of the
[36:29] Cornerstone it is entirely a work of God
[36:34] himself it's Sovereign work of almighty
[36:37] God it's God moving everything right
[36:40] into its place right in its time it's
[36:42] not something where God is dragging you
[36:45] and I or pushing you and I but it's God
[36:48] by his spirit that moves Upon Our Life
[36:50] to move you and I into the place and
[36:53] position that he has desired and
[36:55] intended for us us to be I tell you it's
[36:58] no chance it was no happen stance it's
[37:00] nothing that just by chance that we're
[37:03] here tonight we're here tonight being
[37:05] being made known and ordained by God
[37:08] that God is declaring his mind to you
[37:11] and I over and over God lets you and I
[37:14] know you were in my thinking you were
[37:17] always a part of me it's God confirming
[37:20] his word friends we can't hear the word
[37:23] and the word come forth and not confirm
[37:25] that the preacher of the word it
[37:27] confirms it over and over of where we
[37:30] were who we are and where we are going
[37:33] that's the ministry of the word because
[37:35] the ministry of the holy spirit always
[37:38] works in continuity with God's word in
[37:41] election always so it's God it's God
[37:46] moving everything I I I look at things
[37:48] so much down through the word and and
[37:51] you see things that even it's just uh
[37:54] you know as I begin to look at it here
[37:55] of how that when there that second world
[37:58] war how it stopped within a certain time
[38:01] you know and to think of how everything
[38:03] nobody can explain it but it was God who
[38:06] stopped it it was God who arranged it
[38:09] let me tell you something missiles and
[38:11] bombs and tanks and governments there is
[38:14] nothing that can stand before the
[38:16] presence of almighty God there's nothing
[38:19] can move in upon his children but God
[38:22] already is aware of it like the prophet
[38:24] said about that great eag that was was
[38:26] looking at its youngans that was down
[38:28] there said if a coyote would start
[38:30] toward one of them he would swoop down
[38:32] and fog it to death what is it it's God
[38:36] who's got his eye upon all things he
[38:40] knows what he's doing when he lets a
[38:42] trial come your way when he lets the
[38:44] test come your way when you might be in
[38:46] thick grass and Tall Grass and you can't
[38:48] see what's coming on next but he is
[38:51] watching over you he hadn't lost track
[38:54] of you you might have lost sight of him
[38:56] but he ain't lost sight of you he knows
[38:58] exactly where you're at he knows exactly
[39:01] what you're going
[39:03] through and it's no coincidence it's not
[39:06] an accident it's not a mistake but God
[39:09] himself allows the things that will
[39:11] permits it to come by his per his his
[39:15] will to test us to try us you say what
[39:18] about even our own bad choices and our
[39:21] own bad decisions if we can submit it to
[39:24] the Lord then God can make come to past
[39:26] his word where he'll make all things
[39:29] work together for the good to them that
[39:31] love the Lord and are called according
[39:33] to his purpose not that everything is
[39:36] good but it can work to the
[39:38] good is that right so we have this
[39:41] confidence and when we're looking at
[39:44] this within Jacob's life I want to just
[39:46] just deal with this just a few moments
[39:48] here in Jacob's life and and just seeing
[39:51] how that God has given such a a charge
[39:55] here to to Jacob from Isaac how that you
[39:59] know it was here where Jacob is led to
[40:04] go and and get all the preparations if I
[40:06] can just save time all the preparations
[40:09] he's LED of what to do and to bring this
[40:12] the blessing is be getting ready to be
[40:15] pronounced and so as here Jacob is ready
[40:19] he's realizing my time of departure is
[40:21] in hand it's time to to to pronounce
[40:24] this blessing if I could say it like
[40:26] this Jacob or Isaac pardon me Isaac is
[40:28] letting it be known the evening time of
[40:30] my message is here it's time to
[40:32] pronounce the blessing it's time for the
[40:35] blessing to be pronounced so here he's
[40:38] realizing and in the word itself is
[40:40] going to go forth within the season and
[40:42] the time and here Rebecca she catches it
[40:45] we know and and she begins to make this
[40:47] known to Jacob and Jacob comes under
[40:50] that pronouncing of the blessing and
[40:52] when he comes under the pronouncing of
[40:53] the blessing of the birthright we know
[40:56] that even though that he has paid and
[40:59] you know he or he has acquired that of
[41:01] the birthright with Esau you know uh
[41:04] despising it thinking little of it and
[41:06] when that that Jacob yet within his life
[41:09] he's come under the pronouncing of it
[41:11] he's heard the blessing of it but yet
[41:13] he's not been fully quickened yet he's
[41:17] had the blessing put over his life he's
[41:19] had a hunger for the blessing but yet
[41:21] he's not been fully quickened yet are
[41:24] you with me he's heard the gospel of his
[41:27] salvation but you know just hearing it
[41:30] is not the
[41:31] quickening knowing it's the truth is not
[41:34] the
[41:35] quickening but it must be that something
[41:38] resonates first to declare this is
[41:41] truth because what is truth then you
[41:44] walk in that and toward that which is
[41:47] truth to do what become one with it so
[41:51] the pronouncing of the blessing and I I
[41:53] just feel constrained of the Lord to
[41:56] really really move and deal with these
[41:57] things because you know many times the
[42:00] prophet said it like this he said in the
[42:02] message come follow me in 1963 when he's
[42:05] preaching to the graduates there he said
[42:07] you know he says you can come along and
[42:09] he's talking about the Rich Young Ruler
[42:11] he said and you can learn this message
[42:13] this is his words you can learn this
[42:16] message he said but that is not the
[42:19] person of eternal life you have to
[42:22] receive the person of eternal life what
[42:25] the message is itself it is god making
[42:29] his promise his Covenant that he has
[42:32] reserved and has making it known to his
[42:35] children and when God makes that promise
[42:38] known it's there for the believer to
[42:40] become one with that
[42:43] promise because before that time the
[42:45] word can be disputed the word can be
[42:48] questioned is that right they can say
[42:51] this has passed and this has passed and
[42:53] that's for this and that's for that but
[42:55] when God moves on the scene God doesn't
[42:57] move on the scene to make himself known
[42:59] to everybody the light doesn't come to
[43:02] Quicken the rocks it doesn't come to
[43:04] Quicken the dirt the light comes to
[43:06] Quicken the seed and that's why the
[43:08] promised word when it comes it's god
[43:11] making his word known the Covenant that
[43:13] God has made and God is making that word
[43:17] live and real real that the people of
[43:19] God in that hour know that God is alive
[43:23] and God is real and I can have that same
[43:28] experience
[43:31] amen hallelujah this is a working of
[43:34] where in Jacob's life we see that how
[43:38] that within it you know Isaac has given
[43:40] Jacob a charge and he tells he tells uh
[43:45] uh you know Jacob what to do in the very
[43:48] first verse he tells him that he's got
[43:51] to leave this place and he's got to go
[43:53] find a wife but not just anywhere he's
[43:56] got to go to a certain
[43:59] land now that wife's not going to come
[44:01] to him he's got to go to
[44:04] her you see the uniting he's got to put
[44:07] forth an effort to be
[44:09] United so here the word has come to to
[44:12] deal with his life the word now notice
[44:15] watch out watch how everything changes
[44:17] now remember Isaac was crying out when
[44:20] Esau walked in and said oh thy brother
[44:23] you know he has supplanted thee and and
[44:25] and and every thing but notice the word
[44:28] is no longer calling Jacob in an Essence
[44:33] deceiver I hope you're with me now
[44:36] because even though Jacob needs a real
[44:39] change of nature but the word has got to
[44:42] speak to him and call him up
[44:45] high so the word it comes and listen
[44:48] friends as the word is coming when that
[44:50] presence of almighty God comes down it
[44:54] makes it brings conviction in lives it
[44:57] convicts you and I it deals with lives
[44:59] it deals with hearts it causes the
[45:02] children of God to say I'm not where I
[45:04] need to be I need to rise higher I need
[45:08] to move deeper I need to rise
[45:11] up the word does that what good does it
[45:14] do just to focus upon the situation it's
[45:17] one thing to point out the sin but God
[45:20] just don't point out your sin and leave
[45:23] you there he points you to the kill
[45:26] he points you to the remedy there's
[45:28] always that room for
[45:34] repentance how big the space is I don't
[45:36] know but there's always a space of
[45:41] repentance is that right so to find how
[45:45] that Isaac you know he sends Jacob away
[45:48] there's a
[45:49] charge and you know it's important we
[45:53] have to do what the word says do
[45:58] you know the think of it there's a a
[46:00] contrast I want you to look at here just
[46:01] a little bit a contrast between Esau and
[46:04] Jacob here the scripture goes on to say
[46:07] in verse
[46:08] six when Esau saw that Isaac had blessed
[46:11] Jacob and sent him away Pam to take him
[46:15] away from th and that as he blessed him
[46:19] he gave him a charge saying Thou shalt
[46:21] not take a wife of the daughters of
[46:24] Canaan and that Jacob obeyed his father
[46:28] and his mother and was gone to pandam
[46:32] notice
[46:33] this this is this is depicting and
[46:36] showing here that God how he's dealing
[46:39] with Jacob as we said moments ago and
[46:42] you know whereas Isaac was at one time
[46:45] speaking oh my what has happened here
[46:47] what has taken place but we recognize
[46:49] there's there had to been to where that
[46:51] Isaac has moved in a place to recognize
[46:54] there's something great
[46:56] here that's taking
[46:58] place you know it's just like that you
[47:00] know when Jacob remember as we talked
[47:02] the other other Thursday night about the
[47:04] hands being crossed the covenants belong
[47:06] to the Jews all of those things belong
[47:08] to the Jews but they were crossed and
[47:11] through the cross and came upon the
[47:13] Gentiles and when Jacob was was speaking
[47:15] and Joseph went to correct him but Jacob
[47:18] said I can't do nothing but what God has
[47:21] had me to
[47:23] do Jacob went to bless him like this but
[47:27] God moved on the
[47:29] scene w if it hadn't been for God move
[47:33] on the scene and a cross come
[47:35] in if it hadn't been God move on the
[47:38] scene and come and stand in the
[47:41] breach amen when it seemed like all hope
[47:44] was lost and John was crying there ain't
[47:47] nobody but all of a sudden John weep not
[47:50] John for the lion of the tribe of Judah
[47:55] he has
[47:57] prevailed what is it that call refers
[48:00] him back to the atonement that is made
[48:03] for
[48:04] you amen not just in the Redemption of
[48:07] your soul but the taking of that book it
[48:10] leads to the very Redemption of your
[48:14] body
[48:16] amen is being orchestrated by almighty
[48:19] God are you with me tonight I believe
[48:22] I'm preaching to Believers tonight amen
[48:25] where there was a strong angel that was
[48:28] crying there in Revelations 5 oh if
[48:31] there is one worthy let him come or
[48:34] forever hold his
[48:37] peace amen but there was one who stepped
[48:40] on the
[48:41] Forefront amen it was a son of man
[48:44] revealing the son of
[48:46] man amen as he stood there he said it
[48:49] wasn't what I knew it wasn't me it was
[48:54] him am man it isn't my message it's his
[49:00] message glory be to God all friends to
[49:03] think of it the hour that we are living
[49:07] in when every one of these promises God
[49:10] make it everything so rich and precious
[49:13] to you and I to energize our faith why
[49:16] does he come like this to lift you and I
[49:19] he knows the conditions you're in he
[49:21] knows the circumstances but it's God
[49:24] providing the lift that you
[49:31] need glory be to God here it is the
[49:35] scripture says of how that Jacob I like
[49:39] how this this is worded here it just
[49:41] pressed on my heart so deeply that Jacob
[49:45] obeyed his father and his mother I tell
[49:47] you I've read this I've read through
[49:48] these chapters over and over and over
[49:50] and over I've had fits B on the
[49:52] airplanes when I've been reading it I
[49:55] look at at things putting things down
[49:56] studying and so oh my it's just so
[49:59] precious to see God's Divine oversight
[50:02] within it all it's God orchestrating it
[50:05] and how that here this depiction where
[50:08] Jacob obeyed his father and his mother
[50:11] and was gone to p uh to to pad around
[50:14] notice this he obeyed this word obeyed I
[50:17] want you to catch this here this word
[50:20] you can't you can't obey something if
[50:23] you can't hear
[50:24] it
[50:26] how can you obey what you can't hear is
[50:29] that right but to be able to hear to
[50:32] give heed to it to consent agree to
[50:35] listen to to yield to to obey to be
[50:39] obedient that ability to be able to hear
[50:42] is a very very precious
[50:44] thing now remember in the scriptures in
[50:47] in the Book of Matthew Matthew 13 it
[50:50] speaks as well as in the in Luke as well
[50:54] of the sewing of the seed that the son
[50:56] of man that seed which he has sown and
[50:59] how that he would come sewing that seed
[51:02] and how that the seed some of it would
[51:04] fall among
[51:05] Thorns some would fall among the Wayside
[51:09] that right some would also fall on Stony
[51:13] ground but there was others that fell on
[51:15] good
[51:17] ground now I want you to catch this the
[51:20] ground
[51:21] itself it was not ground that did
[51:25] something as far as within itself to
[51:28] make itself
[51:31] acceptable this is talking about the dep
[51:34] and the prophet picks it up like this in
[51:36] the Rapture he picks it up like this in
[51:39] works as Faith expressed brother B says
[51:41] see it was ground that was
[51:44] pre-prepared
[51:46] preprepared why it was predestinated
[51:50] ground it was ground that was already
[51:53] prepared what ground are we talking
[51:54] about we're talking about a bedding
[51:56] ground a womb that was ordained to be
[51:59] able to receive the
[52:02] seed all four heard
[52:05] it so we're talking about a a a a
[52:08] different depth of hearing here we're
[52:11] not talking about a hearing that where
[52:13] it's able just to hear something but
[52:16] we're talking about a hearing that
[52:18] translates into an understanding we're
[52:21] talking about an understanding here that
[52:23] translates into a change of life is that
[52:28] right it's not something that anybody
[52:30] can school into you is that right but
[52:34] it's predestinated our experiences are
[52:37] not schooled into US you're not taught
[52:39] into it it is
[52:42] predestinated does the word have to be
[52:44] preached sure the word has to be
[52:46] preached does leadership have to be
[52:48] given sure it has to be given but we're
[52:51] not being schooled into
[52:54] something gold is where you learn
[52:57] it amen but when it's by experience it
[53:01] will you are ordained for this moment to
[53:04] receive the word of God in this hour you
[53:08] ordained to express Jesus Christ in this
[53:13] hour
[53:15] amen that's exactly the
[53:19] truth think of how you know the prophet
[53:22] he deals with them very words I've just
[53:23] given to you in Satan's Eden
[53:25] he goes on to say how he says you know
[53:28] it's not just hearing hearing as far as
[53:30] somebody hearing the word he said
[53:32] because somebody can hear it and remain
[53:33] a prostitute they can hear remain a
[53:35] drunken he said you can hear them and
[53:37] you could ask them do you believe that's
[53:38] a truth they said sure it's a truth he
[53:40] said but that ain't the hearing we're
[53:41] talking about the word he that heareth
[53:44] is he that understandeth and when he
[53:47] understandeth it's when a change it
[53:50] leads that person to a real
[53:52] transformation in their life because it
[53:55] is the very mystery of their life what
[53:58] it is that has been moving upon their
[54:01] life and they may not recogniz and
[54:03] didn't recognize it all of these times
[54:05] but God himself begins to make his word
[54:09] known and the Mystery of God begins to
[54:11] break over our lives and as the mystery
[54:14] of God is breaking over our life The
[54:16] Secret of our life begins to
[54:20] unfold the more Abraham walked the more
[54:23] his the more the seals of Abraham's life
[54:25] were
[54:26] unfolded oh yes and Abraham's life was a
[54:29] church ages and Abraham's life was the
[54:32] seals in your life is a church ages in
[54:34] your life is
[54:36] seals you with me it's taking off it's
[54:39] peeling back the seals what is what do
[54:41] the seals reveal inside of it that's
[54:44] where the Prophet said he is those seals
[54:47] and under and in the midst of your life
[54:49] as he's revealing un covering little by
[54:52] little and removing away what are we
[54:55] coming to see Christ in you the hope of
[55:02] glory my goodness we keep preaching like
[55:05] this so seem like there are no
[55:07] battles but you know what this is what
[55:10] gives you
[55:12] strength God ain't going to take away
[55:14] our battles he just wants to give us
[55:16] courage and strength to go face
[55:19] them because in that he's
[55:23] glorified yes sir I strength is not in
[55:26] our ability our memorization and how all
[55:29] our strength David said the Lord is the
[55:32] strength of my
[55:35] life he is my
[55:41] salvation Glory Glory Glory
[55:44] Hallelujah that ain't just talking about
[55:47] when you gave your life to the Lord
[55:50] every day he is our Salvation when you
[55:53] are down and see seems like you're lower
[55:56] than the padding in the carpet he is
[55:58] your salvation he comes and ministers to
[56:01] you he comes and speaks to you what is
[56:03] he the Lord is my
[56:08] salvation glory be to
[56:11] God he is my
[56:14] salvation my mind this ability to hear
[56:19] so the word itself the word it's got to
[56:23] come forth it's got to be spoken and
[56:25] ministered I want to just look at this
[56:27] thought because Jacob would not have
[56:30] known what to do except God would speak
[56:33] to him is that
[56:36] right now notice how that Paul picks
[56:39] this up very familiar passage of
[56:40] scripture to us in verse 12 for there is
[56:43] no difference between the Jew and the
[56:45] Greek for the same Lord over all is Rich
[56:47] unto all that call upon him for
[56:50] whosoever shall call upon the name of
[56:52] the Lord shall be saved
[56:55] how then now watch this how then shall
[56:57] they call on him in whom they have not
[57:01] believed how can they call on him if
[57:03] they have not believed in him how could
[57:05] Jacob go to this land if he doesn't know
[57:09] about it to go there you with me he
[57:12] knows where his mama come
[57:14] from but you see he needs Direction let
[57:18] him know you need to go
[57:22] there you know what it is it's God
[57:25] providing for you and
[57:30] I let me say it like this when you came
[57:34] along upon this Earth your mama and
[57:37] daddy were not scrambling around to find
[57:39] Pampers or to find whatever kind of bird
[57:42] eye or diapers or whatever you wore or
[57:44] milk bottles or or bassinets or cribs or
[57:47] whatever more you say what are you
[57:49] getting at they were expecting your
[57:53] arrival yes yes sir they knew your
[57:56] arrival was coming and the closer it got
[57:59] they kept on making preparation for your
[58:03] arrival and God knew that you and I
[58:06] would be here in this hour and God has
[58:08] made preparation for this
[58:13] hour amen there is no test or no trial
[58:18] or nothing where that how that Paul said
[58:20] think it not stranger Peter said that
[58:23] Paul said there is no nothing that has
[58:25] come your way amen but God has permitted
[58:30] it God's already made
[58:34] preparation amen so to think how that
[58:38] God himself making a preparation for you
[58:42] and I to come forth he prepared that
[58:44] there would be a word in this hour that
[58:48] you and I were fitted to that
[58:51] word hallelujah amen where it was
[58:54] something in us that the threads in US
[58:57] match the nut of the
[59:00] hour Hallelujah it was ordained by God
[59:03] you didn't put the threads on yourself I
[59:06] didn't put the threads on myself but the
[59:08] threads were already there and here
[59:10] God's nut came in this hour and the
[59:13] threads that were there that word that
[59:15] was being preached it's something that
[59:17] resonates in our heart like the prophet
[59:19] said that little eagle and when he
[59:21] screamed out he said that little Eagle
[59:23] said it was like a glove that fit my
[59:27] hand why the threads
[59:31] match some of you Brothers know what I
[59:33] mean you go into a store and you're
[59:35] trying to find a screw you know a
[59:36] screw's falling out of a door screw's
[59:37] falling out of a sweeper and you've got
[59:39] the ultimate task of going and trying to
[59:41] find the exact same one you've got to
[59:42] try to find how it's
[59:45] threaded my Lord sometimes you go and
[59:47] look and you know and sometimes
[59:49] everybody says more is better is it
[59:50] really I stood there in Lowe's and Home
[59:52] Depot and I'm looking around where's the
[59:54] first guy with an orange or blue
[59:57] one I don't like just killing time I I
[1:00:00] to me I want to get moving there's time
[1:00:01] is time is of the essence here but
[1:00:04] you're looking around for things of how
[1:00:05] to thread that in God already has
[1:00:08] ordained all of
[1:00:10] that yes sir amen now notice this how
[1:00:15] shall they call on him in whom they have
[1:00:18] not believed how shall they believe in
[1:00:21] him of whom they have not heard
[1:00:29] that's why friends in this hour the
[1:00:31] great accountability in this hour is us
[1:00:33] who hear this
[1:00:37] word he's already been turned out of the
[1:00:40] church world the great accountability is
[1:00:43] among us there they have put him out
[1:00:45] remember as we looked at it a couple
[1:00:46] weeks ago they didn't put out a Doctrine
[1:00:49] he said behold I stand at the door and
[1:00:52] knock they put out the person of the
[1:00:54] word the lifegiver they put him out of
[1:00:57] their midst they put out him who
[1:01:00] pronounces the blessing and he who is
[1:01:02] the blesser they put him out only he can
[1:01:06] do that that's what Isaac told Jacob
[1:01:08] even after the blessing he said God
[1:01:10] Almighty bless
[1:01:13] thee it's only God by one Spirit we're
[1:01:15] baptized into one body only God can do
[1:01:18] that that's why it's important friends
[1:01:19] the word that we are hearing and it's
[1:01:22] not just something that God I want you
[1:01:24] to understand this not just something
[1:01:26] that bringing fear no no no no no it
[1:01:28] ought to be a rejoicing in our hearts
[1:01:31] when you know from within that you've
[1:01:33] been set free by God's Amazing Grace
[1:01:36] when your life has been quickened it's
[1:01:38] matching up with the word and lining up
[1:01:40] of the word you've got that peace on the
[1:01:42] inside the love of God is moving in your
[1:01:45] heart that's a great joy in this hour
[1:01:48] that's something that is God's grace
[1:01:50] that we did not provide that God
[1:01:53] provided that
[1:01:59] to tell you the truth when the word
[1:02:00] itself comes it's against our own
[1:02:08] makeup that's exactly the right it's not
[1:02:11] it's not with our makeup but that's why
[1:02:14] we must have him to come down and get in
[1:02:17] the middle be the will in the middle of
[1:02:21] the will amen so that it's no longer our
[1:02:25] temperament under the control of the
[1:02:27] first birth but now it becomes
[1:02:29] surrendered under the new
[1:02:31] birth is that right God never made Paul
[1:02:35] like Peter Peter like James he left him
[1:02:37] the way they were because he had a work
[1:02:39] for them to
[1:02:42] do that's not an excuse for god well you
[1:02:45] know Brother Sam you've got to accept me
[1:02:46] the way I am you know how I am brother
[1:02:47] Samuel you know no no no no no we're not
[1:02:49] talking about that well we're not
[1:02:51] talking about saying well you know this
[1:02:53] know how it is no no it's God deals with
[1:02:55] each of Our Lives it's him molding us
[1:02:57] him shaping us him making us but you
[1:02:59] know what the beauty of it is God don't
[1:03:01] want everybody like me and he don't want
[1:03:03] me like
[1:03:04] you thank
[1:03:06] God you should have said praise the Lord
[1:03:09] to that
[1:03:12] before and how shall they believe in him
[1:03:15] of whom they have not heard and how
[1:03:17] shall they hear without a preacher how
[1:03:20] shall now watch this how shall they
[1:03:23] preach EX except they be
[1:03:27] sent now there's a lot of
[1:03:29] preachers Paul identified Satan had
[1:03:34] ministers is that right so it's not just
[1:03:39] preaching but it is that which has been
[1:03:42] sent by
[1:03:44] God remember when Jesus he said in John
[1:03:47] 6 as the living father has sent me and I
[1:03:50] live by him so you shall live by me also
[1:03:54] as he has he has sent me so send I you
[1:03:58] he commissioned them go ye therefore and
[1:04:01] preach the
[1:04:03] gospel right but he let him know this is
[1:04:07] your
[1:04:08] charge this is the charge Isaac charged
[1:04:12] Jacob but you need to receive him who is
[1:04:16] the
[1:04:17] preacher he who is the
[1:04:20] sender why because he knows where his
[1:04:23] children are
[1:04:25] are glory be to God oh Hallelujah don't
[1:04:30] you love him amen that's why Peter goes
[1:04:33] on I love how Peter puts it he said that
[1:04:36] we preach this gospel with the Holy
[1:04:38] Ghost sent down from
[1:04:39] heaven not not to be preached any other
[1:04:42] way it must be preached by the Holy
[1:04:44] Ghost sent down from heaven listen
[1:04:46] friends there's there's people that can
[1:04:47] be very anointed we're not just talking
[1:04:49] about anointed preaching here we're
[1:04:52] talking about men of God that have met
[1:04:55] God face to face in the sacred SS of
[1:04:57] God's grace and have met God personally
[1:05:00] in the promise of that
[1:05:02] hour why because they if they're
[1:05:05] proclaiming that word and preaching that
[1:05:07] gospel they have to have been somewhere
[1:05:11] met somebody and know the very Authority
[1:05:14] and power of who they met because when
[1:05:17] that gospel is preached in that reality
[1:05:20] from the heart then it's an able
[1:05:23] minister of the
[1:05:25] gospel Hallelujah as Paul said the
[1:05:28] Revelation ye are that epistle that's
[1:05:31] written in our heart what was Paul
[1:05:33] saying I'm not preaching something
[1:05:35] different than what is written in me
[1:05:37] what's written in me is exactly what's
[1:05:40] issuing
[1:05:42] forth an able minister of the Gospel so
[1:05:46] notice he goes on to say but they have
[1:05:49] not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah
[1:05:52] said Lord who hath believed our rep
[1:05:54] report so then Faith cometh by hearing
[1:05:57] and hearing by the word of
[1:06:00] God so once again it needs and requires
[1:06:04] that hearing of the Lord notice this we
[1:06:06] know that we need Faith within it in the
[1:06:09] message I perceived that thou art a
[1:06:10] prophet brother B says you couldn't heal
[1:06:12] him no other man could heal him they
[1:06:14] have to accept their healing as God's
[1:06:16] God's free gift to them he was wounded
[1:06:18] for our transgressions with his stripes
[1:06:20] we were healed then you see there's
[1:06:22] nothing at all that you can do towards
[1:06:24] salvation or Divine Healing it's the
[1:06:26] individual's faith in Christ now to
[1:06:29] bring up this faith in Christ there's
[1:06:31] ministers that's the most important
[1:06:33] thing of the day is a God good godsent
[1:06:36] preacher once again not just a preacher
[1:06:39] a good godsent
[1:06:42] preacher not just a preacher a good
[1:06:45] godsent preacher I admire them not just
[1:06:49] admire preachers a good godsent preacher
[1:06:53] is that right
[1:06:54] well as a preacher I admire good godsent
[1:07:00] Christians right not just church members
[1:07:03] not just people who come to church but
[1:07:05] you admire people there is a quality
[1:07:07] within the life receiving that word and
[1:07:10] they walk with a fervency in that word
[1:07:12] they take that word hold on to that word
[1:07:15] their life is not dependent as far as
[1:07:17] their Victory is not dependent upon the
[1:07:19] pastor how deep he preaches or how how
[1:07:22] how you know excited he gets or how
[1:07:24] settled he is but their Victory is
[1:07:27] dependent upon Jesus Christ it's Christ
[1:07:30] that set before and it's Christ that
[1:07:32] they seek to be unveiled
[1:07:42] in and their gift is far beyond anything
[1:07:46] could be done in anything else as a
[1:07:47] preacher a man who knows how to rightly
[1:07:51] divide the word of God now let's look at
[1:07:53] this here just a moment here in time
[1:07:55] here I have just a few moments in
[1:07:57] Galatians 3 you see what God is is doing
[1:08:01] even after the dispensation where the
[1:08:04] Lamb of God has come on them seene they
[1:08:07] shed his blood he's paid the price
[1:08:09] sended back up into glory and now as he
[1:08:12] steps forth in his mediatorial work as
[1:08:14] high priest sends back the Holy Ghost
[1:08:17] and they begin to go forth and declare
[1:08:19] the gospel of the atonement they begin
[1:08:22] to go and preach the good news well you
[1:08:25] know they weren't the first
[1:08:29] preachers God himself is a
[1:08:32] preacher you believe that God is a
[1:08:35] preacher Galatians chapter 3 even as
[1:08:38] Abraham believed God and it was
[1:08:40] accounted to him for righteousness know
[1:08:42] ye therefore that they which are of
[1:08:44] Faith the same are the children of
[1:08:46] Abraham and the scripture foreseeing
[1:08:49] that God would justify the Heathen
[1:08:51] through faith preached before for the
[1:08:54] gospel unto
[1:08:57] Abraham God preached the
[1:09:00] gospel preached it unto who unto Abraham
[1:09:04] did he preach it unto lot no he preached
[1:09:07] it unto Abram lot heard it but it didn't
[1:09:11] have a hold upon lot's life for lot it
[1:09:15] was secondarily he was following along
[1:09:18] with Abram but for Abraham it had
[1:09:21] something within his heart that meant
[1:09:23] something something to
[1:09:25] him is that right so God preached before
[1:09:29] the gospel unto Abram saying in thee
[1:09:33] shall All Nations be blessed so then
[1:09:35] they which be of Faith are blessed with
[1:09:38] faithful
[1:09:41] Abraham
[1:09:43] Hallelujah now think of this here just a
[1:09:46] moment think of how that down through
[1:09:48] the scriptures here in the book of Acts
[1:09:51] how that when philli here he is
[1:09:52] preaching in Sam Mara I'm just going to
[1:09:55] I'm not going to read from him I'm just
[1:09:56] going to skip but paraphrase him but how
[1:09:59] that Phillip he's caught by the angel of
[1:10:01] the Lord the angel of the Lord tells him
[1:10:04] that you know he catches him away and he
[1:10:06] tells him that he's to arise and go down
[1:10:10] south let me just go ahead and read it
[1:10:11] verse 26 the angel of the Lord spake
[1:10:13] unto Philip saying arise and go toward
[1:10:15] the South unto the way that goeth down
[1:10:17] from Jerusalem unto Gaza which is
[1:10:22] Desert I was going to go right by
[1:10:25] that but this is what I want you to
[1:10:27] catch in here faith is not knowing every
[1:10:31] step of the way faith is knowing him
[1:10:35] who's speaking to
[1:10:39] you amen Philip didn't say hey where
[1:10:42] what's going to happen after this where
[1:10:43] do I go exactly God did not give him
[1:10:46] just like putting a point on a GPS map
[1:10:49] drop a pen right there no he told him go
[1:10:52] it down from jerus unto Gaza which is
[1:10:55] Desert where at in
[1:10:58] Gaza he didn't have to worry all he had
[1:11:02] to do was surrender to God and God would
[1:11:05] take him the direction that God was
[1:11:07] calling him to
[1:11:09] go God was in control God was directing
[1:11:13] him you know how God could do that
[1:11:14] because he was
[1:11:16] surrendered you realize friends many
[1:11:18] things that God brings you and I through
[1:11:20] tests trials situations sometimes we're
[1:11:23] in the mid of things we were almost like
[1:11:24] a basket case we're nervous what do I do
[1:11:26] here what do I do there what do I do
[1:11:28] there but you know what God brings us
[1:11:30] into these places so that he might show
[1:11:33] his grace to you and I that not not for
[1:11:36] us to say oh brother say I don't want to
[1:11:37] get back to that place again I don't
[1:11:39] want to be nervous do you think I want
[1:11:40] to be nervous every time every time
[1:11:41] before I preach sometimes I'm so nervous
[1:11:43] before I preach I feel like my stomach's
[1:11:45] all turned upside down I Lord I don't
[1:11:47] know how you're going to bring all this
[1:11:48] together I don't know how you're going
[1:11:49] to put it all together and you got all
[1:11:51] sorts of thoughts coming your way
[1:11:53] thoughts thoughts coming here thoughts
[1:11:54] coming there thank God for the grace of
[1:11:56] God to be able to discern those
[1:11:58] thoughts oh yes sir Satan firing in
[1:12:01] thoughts people don't want to hear that
[1:12:02] people already heard that people already
[1:12:03] come along this line I know that ain't
[1:12:05] of
[1:12:06] God I know that for sure I know that
[1:12:09] that's not of God it's of one of two
[1:12:11] it's either from this flesh right here
[1:12:13] or it's from the
[1:12:15] devil oh yes sir but in the midst of all
[1:12:19] of that what does God bring us to places
[1:12:21] that you and I learn to rest and trust
[1:12:26] him it would have been easy if there
[1:12:28] would have been no Red Sea so we
[1:12:32] think it would have been easy if there
[1:12:34] wouldn't have been any Giants so we
[1:12:37] think but you see what the Red Sea did
[1:12:41] and what the Giants did is Manifest the
[1:12:43] faith that was there and allow the faith
[1:12:46] to be able to grow in the midst of those
[1:12:50] circumstances so what's God doing God is
[1:12:53] Not the author of confusion God himself
[1:12:56] allows and arranges that you and I come
[1:12:58] into places that we don't even know what
[1:13:00] to do even to where the pages on the
[1:13:02] Bible might get stuck
[1:13:06] together and a Catholic priest comes up
[1:13:08] and says here be be still my son the
[1:13:12] Lord is doing
[1:13:13] something glory be to God what is it God
[1:13:18] is
[1:13:21] directing we find that H all of a sudden
[1:13:24] how that Philip is able to hear that
[1:13:26] there is a unic that's reading a
[1:13:30] scripture evidently he didn't have his
[1:13:32] earbuds
[1:13:33] in you know evidently this guy was
[1:13:36] reading I don't think he was yelling him
[1:13:40] out see brother Samuel what was it God
[1:13:43] needed to direct
[1:13:46] Phillip so when Phillip would begin to
[1:13:49] hear this reading of the scripture the
[1:13:52] spirit of God said told him go and join
[1:13:55] thyself to this Chariot oh my what kind
[1:13:58] of cellular communication is
[1:14:01] this he joins himself to this Chariot
[1:14:04] and he begins to hear the reading of
[1:14:06] Isaiah oh my you can imagine what it did
[1:14:09] die to Philip's heart the same thing it
[1:14:10] does to your heart and my heart it's
[1:14:12] something begins to rise up because here
[1:14:14] is Philip one who's holding the promise
[1:14:17] of what Isaiah spoke about but now it's
[1:14:21] come into manifestation and the
[1:14:23] scripture says that when the mic notice
[1:14:26] the unic asked
[1:14:30] Phillip who's the prophet talking
[1:14:33] about now here he had the word is that
[1:14:36] right but the seed life itself travels
[1:14:40] through the body is that right the
[1:14:43] prophet taught us that we see it through
[1:14:44] the scriptures in spoken word's Original
[1:14:46] Seed brother Bram tells us that you
[1:14:47] cannot serve god without receiving the
[1:14:50] servants whom he
[1:14:51] sends is that right
[1:14:53] he sends by what his word his Revelation
[1:14:56] is that true God sends his word sends
[1:14:59] the light of the age and the prophet
[1:15:01] tells us in the saman age that that same
[1:15:04] pattern that Paul had picked up that the
[1:15:06] Lord Jesus had laid out that same
[1:15:09] pattern applies in every age that that
[1:15:12] Revelation the light of the age that
[1:15:15] Covenant being made known for the age It
[1:15:17] Goes Forth but then there are others who
[1:15:20] pick up that and are ordained to be able
[1:15:22] to preach that now listen to me now not
[1:15:24] just preach it here but you're called to
[1:15:26] preach as well that's right oh brother
[1:15:30] Samuel now you know been know out man
[1:15:32] some of the sisters love to find this
[1:15:34] out man oh man I can burn my Facebook up
[1:15:37] now no no no no that's what we're
[1:15:39] talking about we're talking about
[1:15:41] preaching with your
[1:15:43] life preaching with your life preaching
[1:15:46] with your life amen think of how that
[1:15:49] God I want you to think of this look
[1:15:51] this up when you get home of how that
[1:15:53] God thought so much of Aquilla and
[1:15:55] Priscilla and they were known to be
[1:15:58] helpers in the gospel so much was the
[1:16:00] testimony of Jesus Christ in their life
[1:16:03] that Paul when he would write to other
[1:16:05] Saints he would include their names and
[1:16:08] greet the saints of God even with their
[1:16:11] names included why because the testimony
[1:16:14] in their life was so radiating and
[1:16:21] effectual that should be surprising to
[1:16:24] you and I there's many people that'll
[1:16:26] never receive a message book there's
[1:16:28] people that'll never stand still for God
[1:16:30] sent a prophit but they will stand still
[1:16:32] and take notice when they see your
[1:16:35] life because they can't see or put that
[1:16:38] together you know what that is that's
[1:16:40] the manifestation the word that the
[1:16:42] prophet has spoke now made
[1:16:46] flesh yes sir oh my you love
[1:16:50] him how do I what what what is the
[1:16:53] Prophet saying here and the scripture
[1:16:55] begins to tell us here of how that
[1:16:57] Phillip he he be to open his mouth in
[1:17:00] verse 35 then Philip opened his mouth
[1:17:03] and began at the same scripture and
[1:17:05] preached unto him Jesus isn't it amazing
[1:17:07] he was looking at this scripture but
[1:17:10] Phillip anointed and filled with the
[1:17:12] spirit of God had met that very Christ
[1:17:15] and knew that that part of the word that
[1:17:17] he had met God in that part of the word
[1:17:20] what did he do he began not just to read
[1:17:22] the word he began to preach that word oh
[1:17:25] friends don't we see reading it it's not
[1:17:28] just reading the word it's preaching the
[1:17:32] word it's preaching it preaching it
[1:17:35] what's preaching it it's the divine
[1:17:36] inspiration of God coming upon the
[1:17:41] word and as I said That's you living it
[1:17:45] as well you and me
[1:17:47] both notice here and as they went on
[1:17:50] their way they came unto a certain water
[1:17:53] and the unic
[1:17:54] said is't this something Philip never
[1:17:57] had to
[1:17:59] say ain't that nice view over there how
[1:18:03] you like that water the unic
[1:18:06] said what was it the word was touching
[1:18:10] his heart the word was dealing in his
[1:18:13] heart and as Phillip was preaching in
[1:18:17] what Phillip was preaching was that
[1:18:19] making known of the Messiah the Lamb of
[1:18:22] God and letting it be known that the
[1:18:24] life of the atonement has come forth and
[1:18:27] has been poured out in this hour and
[1:18:29] what's he do because the way must be
[1:18:32] open David said thou Wilt show me the
[1:18:35] path of life and here it is God
[1:18:38] revealing his way in that hour and it's
[1:18:40] dealing with the unic all the while here
[1:18:42] is a lamb nature that's hidden down in
[1:18:45] there threaded to that prophecy it
[1:18:47] begins to
[1:18:50] rise hey here's water Stop The
[1:18:57] Chariot here's water what's hindering
[1:19:02] us what's he doing what the word has
[1:19:05] said do he's doing it Jacob go to
[1:19:09] panoram I'm
[1:19:11] going I'm going I'm on my way do what
[1:19:15] the word says do and notice how that God
[1:19:19] put it forth that after this God caught
[1:19:22] away Phillip and the unic went on his
[1:19:25] way one thing that we know is that for
[1:19:29] sure that God did a complete work of
[1:19:33] what was needed in the unix's
[1:19:37] life is that right didn't mean that that
[1:19:40] unic didn't go and and get into you get
[1:19:42] under a pastor and so for that's not
[1:19:43] what I'm saying here what I'm saying is
[1:19:45] is that God himself did a complete work
[1:19:48] within this man's
[1:19:51] life amen now notice how that even when
[1:19:54] you see it in the scriptures there of
[1:19:57] how that that God would place it even in
[1:19:59] Cornelius and you're familiar with this
[1:20:01] portion of the word of how that Peter
[1:20:04] here you know you would look at it and
[1:20:06] think man Peter God ought to be send in
[1:20:08] somebody else down there this guy is
[1:20:10] really troubled but Peter God visits him
[1:20:14] while he's visiting Cornelius you see
[1:20:16] God works on both ends it's just like
[1:20:19] before a service God works on both ends
[1:20:23] it must be God work on both ends it's
[1:20:25] God coming to minister to the very needs
[1:20:28] in our lives and here is
[1:20:31] Cornelius I think of how that he
[1:20:33] acknowledges it and he says in verse 30
[1:20:36] four days ago I was fasting until this
[1:20:38] hour at the ninth hour I prayed in my
[1:20:41] house and behold a man stood Before Me
[1:20:43] In Bright
[1:20:44] clothing and said Cornelius thy prayer
[1:20:47] is heard and thine arms are had in
[1:20:50] remembrance in the sight of God
[1:20:54] see there was a longing in cornelius's
[1:20:56] heart it was a longing that was already
[1:21:01] there but it was coming forth why as a
[1:21:04] deep calleth unto the Deep after noise
[1:21:08] of thy water spot if there's a deep
[1:21:10] calling there's got to be a deep to
[1:21:13] respond when you're Desiring more of God
[1:21:16] it shows there's more of God for
[1:21:20] you
[1:21:21] absolutely and hear when he sends for
[1:21:25] him he says Corel and sin I said
[1:21:27] therefore he said sin therefore here's
[1:21:30] what the angel said send therefore to
[1:21:31] japa and call thither Simon whose
[1:21:34] surname is Peter see God never intended
[1:21:36] the angels to preach the
[1:21:38] gospel God never intended that he is
[1:21:42] lodged in the house of one Simon a
[1:21:45] Tanner by the seaside who when he cometh
[1:21:50] shall speak unto thee
[1:21:53] now the angel already knew what he was
[1:21:55] going to say but the angel was there to
[1:21:57] tell him go down there sin and get this
[1:22:00] man down
[1:22:01] here go get him and when he comes he'll
[1:22:06] tell you what you need to
[1:22:07] hear what is it God's way notice how
[1:22:12] such direct such Precision you believe
[1:22:14] God is still the
[1:22:16] same I believe that I believe God I know
[1:22:19] him to be the same I know him to be
[1:22:21] punctual just like that yes he he's
[1:22:23] still the same God that directs just
[1:22:26] like that Cornelius wasn't a Prophet
[1:22:28] come on somebody Cornelius wasn't the
[1:22:31] prophet he was a man that loved
[1:22:34] God a man that God could speak to that
[1:22:37] he didn't think he was going
[1:22:43] crazy come on
[1:22:45] somebody how many times that the prophet
[1:22:47] you heard the Prophet The Prophet
[1:22:48] himself no matter how many times he
[1:22:49] heard the voice there are times that the
[1:22:51] prophet even on his way down to Israel
[1:22:53] that time he stepped in the hanger and
[1:22:54] said Lord is that
[1:22:56] you why because he wanted to be sure
[1:23:00] there was something in him that wasn't
[1:23:02] William bradam there was something in
[1:23:04] him you can't go there
[1:23:07] now that's not your
[1:23:10] place glory be to God oh friends I
[1:23:14] believe with all of my heart that that
[1:23:16] is God's desire for our lives is that
[1:23:19] our own choice is so surrendered to him
[1:23:24] to where his will his Redemption is so
[1:23:28] reflected through our lives over and
[1:23:31] over no wonder Paul said that I Die
[1:23:33] daily why it's dying getting rid of
[1:23:35] Samuel's
[1:23:37] Choice Samuel's
[1:23:41] way you can put your name in there too
[1:23:43] feel free
[1:23:45] to immediately notice what Cornelius
[1:23:48] said I called for a fast we prayed about
[1:23:51] this no immed immediately you know what
[1:23:53] it was Oh Glory this was a man who was
[1:23:56] in contact with God yet he didn't have
[1:23:59] the promise in his life but it was a
[1:24:01] Desiring to come forth an expression it
[1:24:03] was just like that within Abraham's life
[1:24:06] the prophet said when Abraham saw those
[1:24:08] three men coming down he said he
[1:24:10] recognized because Abraham was spiritual
[1:24:13] he recognized God is here and he said he
[1:24:16] ran in the tent grabbed Sarah by the
[1:24:18] hand went out there in the flock and he
[1:24:20] got a calf he said it's time to end
[1:24:22] entertain the
[1:24:24] Lord why he had been in contact with God
[1:24:28] fellowship with God you want to hear
[1:24:31] from God get in fellowship with God stay
[1:24:33] in fellowship with God the things of
[1:24:35] this Earth are here to try to take away
[1:24:38] your
[1:24:39] time listen friends there's many of us
[1:24:42] who sit in this room that all kinds of
[1:24:44] strains in our life there's some of us
[1:24:46] sitting right here and whatever more
[1:24:47] tonight they're the kind of people that
[1:24:49] you start on something you've got to get
[1:24:50] it done you've got to get it done it
[1:24:52] don't matter if you're working at 4:00
[1:24:53] in the morning you got to get it done
[1:24:55] but listen friends listen listen listen
[1:24:58] be mindful of the
[1:25:07] Lord yes
[1:25:09] sir yes sir what's God reward
[1:25:13] you what's God reward
[1:25:15] you y'all believe that don't you you
[1:25:18] believe
[1:25:20] that watch God rewards you make place
[1:25:23] for
[1:25:25] him you might be tempted you might be
[1:25:27] tempted the first thing in the morning
[1:25:29] that you're the kind of person you're
[1:25:30] tempted and before you know it your
[1:25:32] whole day is rolled
[1:25:36] away then set yourself and say Lord I'm
[1:25:39] starting right
[1:25:42] here brother Samuel that'd be that'd be
[1:25:44] awful hard for me that'd be awful hard
[1:25:46] for me now maybe you're not a morning
[1:25:47] person but what I'm just trying to tell
[1:25:49] you you might say I'm not a morning
[1:25:51] person but make sure sure that you're
[1:25:53] giving your time to the Lord because
[1:25:55] it's so easy for the toils and the tasks
[1:25:58] of this day to all of a sudden you get
[1:26:00] to the evening time and you think Lord
[1:26:02] have mercy how did I get here how did I
[1:26:05] get
[1:26:08] here let's
[1:26:13] stand immediately
[1:26:16] therefore I sent to
[1:26:19] thee and thou Hast well done that thou
[1:26:22] art come now therefore are we all here
[1:26:26] present before God to hear all things
[1:26:31] that are commanded thee of
[1:26:35] God Peter goes on to
[1:26:38] speak of the atonement he begins to
[1:26:41] speak of
[1:26:44] this the Holy Spirit comes in right
[1:26:47] through the word and falls right upon
[1:26:51] him as they heard the word there was
[1:26:55] something about it that
[1:26:57] resonated in their heart within the the
[1:27:00] preaching of the word they had come into
[1:27:02] a place to where God himself recognized
[1:27:06] their faith and sealed
[1:27:09] them why because the word itself holds
[1:27:13] leadership holds Direction it's life
[1:27:18] even when Paul came to the upper coast
[1:27:20] of
[1:27:21] Ephesus he comes into that
[1:27:23] place and he asks him have have you
[1:27:27] received the Holy Ghost now these are
[1:27:30] good clean
[1:27:32] people good clean living people but he
[1:27:35] said if you received the Holy Ghost s
[1:27:38] you believed they said we ain't never
[1:27:40] heard whether there be any Holy Ghost he
[1:27:43] said how was you
[1:27:45] baptized see Paul knew wait wait wait
[1:27:48] there's something wrong how were you
[1:27:49] baptized see he's starting with first
[1:27:51] things
[1:27:53] first Paul didn't ask him if they knew
[1:27:55] this or knew that he started with first
[1:27:57] things first you see friends it's we're
[1:27:59] living in a time and an hour people know
[1:28:03] Mysteries they have a lot of knowledge
[1:28:06] but it's got to come first things first
[1:28:07] we you never can get away from the
[1:28:09] Simplicity of a surrendered
[1:28:12] heart that's what makes the doctrine
[1:28:16] come off the shelf and become bark on
[1:28:19] your
[1:28:21] tree become protection around your
[1:28:25] life amen that's God's
[1:28:29] desire so he addresses
[1:28:32] that but think of how
[1:28:35] that God would speak even to to Jacob I
[1:28:39] want to I want to read just a a
[1:28:41] statement here to
[1:28:43] you they might brother Brian it's on
[1:28:47] things that are to be it's right under
[1:28:48] Isaiah 28 there it's on down quite a
[1:28:51] ways but I want to read this to you and
[1:28:53] leave this with you
[1:28:56] tonight different things I've referred
[1:28:58] to out of things that are to be when
[1:28:59] brother brand memories talking about the
[1:29:00] preparation that's been made for
[1:29:04] you in every age God has sent forth his
[1:29:09] word and that word has been building in
[1:29:12] our
[1:29:13] life God sent forth his
[1:29:16] word here the just shall live by faith
[1:29:20] that was a part Sovereign work of the
[1:29:23] Holy Spirit reaching out to
[1:29:26] minister that by
[1:29:30] believing you can be
[1:29:34] justified then here come here comes God
[1:29:36] coming on the scene and pointing out
[1:29:40] that there's a
[1:29:42] blood that
[1:29:45] cleanses see it's letting them know
[1:29:47] where where all Creeds had covered over
[1:29:48] the blood but it it brings the blood
[1:29:51] back in
[1:29:53] view the blood comes back into view
[1:29:56] there's a blood that sanctifies you
[1:29:59] Hallelujah cleanses you puts you aside
[1:30:02] and ready for service then the spirit of
[1:30:05] God comes and moves again and lets it be
[1:30:08] known that there's a a real true baptism
[1:30:12] of the Holy Ghost to let it be known
[1:30:15] that there's a there's a real finishing
[1:30:19] work that leads to full
[1:30:24] maturity is that right so in every in
[1:30:28] every
[1:30:29] age God himself when he speaks in every
[1:30:33] age every seed that God had for every
[1:30:37] age had within it the
[1:30:40] attributes of his divine nature that was
[1:30:43] to be expressed in that
[1:30:46] hour so God provides a word to do what
[1:30:49] release the virtues that that are laying
[1:30:52] dormant in your
[1:30:54] life every Apple every leaf you don't
[1:30:58] grow to become more apples more apples
[1:31:01] and more leaves and I got to get these
[1:31:02] leaves no no all of those things are
[1:31:06] laying there in that seed is that right
[1:31:10] but the spirit of God has you come under
[1:31:12] the word for this age because it won't
[1:31:14] just be believing in this age is not
[1:31:16] enough that's right right the prophet
[1:31:19] addresses that in the token just to
[1:31:20] believe God sent a prophet he said is
[1:31:22] not enough see not just to believe the
[1:31:24] message is not enough it's to obey the
[1:31:28] message to come in under get under the
[1:31:31] blood not just to know and see the blood
[1:31:33] but to get under the
[1:31:38] blood the prophet says it like this and
[1:31:41] things that ought to be and I close
[1:31:43] here therefore tonight if you just come
[1:31:46] and you say I offer Jesus Christ my life
[1:31:49] and you've never received the Holy Ghost
[1:31:52] come into it you must do it you must
[1:31:56] grow into it listen to this Simplicity
[1:32:00] ask God to pile word on top of word like
[1:32:04] that until you become the full stature
[1:32:06] of a Son of God or a daughter of
[1:32:10] God what
[1:32:12] Simplicity he he shows all the way
[1:32:15] through this in this message the spirit
[1:32:17] of God lets us know you grow you come
[1:32:20] into
[1:32:22] that real true
[1:32:24] birth and as you come into that birth
[1:32:27] you grow to where you step into that new
[1:32:30] body it's growing you never stop
[1:32:40] growing but we have to hear that that
[1:32:43] word it gives us Direction gives us
[1:32:46] leadership
[1:32:49] right we looked at maybe even the
[1:32:51] percentage sitting here tonight that God
[1:32:53] has sealed
[1:32:55] away you know but still in our life that
[1:32:59] even those that have been sealed by the
[1:33:01] spirit of God God is working in our life
[1:33:03] to do what the
[1:33:06] perfecting we're already under the
[1:33:08] Perfection of his blood but the
[1:33:10] perfecting is the Furnishing him moving
[1:33:12] in our life him calling to us him
[1:33:15] letting us know you got something to
[1:33:18] do is that right you have something to
[1:33:22] do so we say Lord let me grow into that
[1:33:26] Lord help me Lord the prophet said how
[1:33:29] many of you here he said desire more of
[1:33:31] God and the people ra by as I'm
[1:33:34] listening and reading they raised their
[1:33:36] hands brother ra said see there's more
[1:33:38] of God for you
[1:33:40] am the Lord does that if it was just a
[1:33:43] man a man wouldn't do that but there's
[1:33:45] something that raises up in us that's
[1:33:47] why I love the ministry of the word that
[1:33:49] God comes down and deals with with our
[1:33:52] lives I love when I listen to the
[1:33:54] message of the hour it deals with my
[1:33:57] life then when I can read in the
[1:33:59] Scripture it deals in my life I love
[1:34:03] that amen but what we want to do is
[1:34:08] surrender surrender that's the
[1:34:10] difference between Esau and Jacob let's
[1:34:14] pray Lord
[1:34:18] God lord I
[1:34:23] I'm so thankful dear
[1:34:25] God for your leadership

[1:34:58] it it's like Lord as it said in the
[1:35:00] scripture that
[1:35:01] you chose to to save man through the
[1:35:05] foolishness of
[1:35:07] preaching my Lord as Paul said Lord to
[1:35:12] that of the men the Greeks and things
[1:35:14] it's foolishness he said but unto us is
[1:35:17] the power of God and the
[1:35:19] Salvation Lord we just want to Lord so
[1:35:24] surrender Lord our lives and our hearts

[1:35:39] want to surrender and submit Lord even
[1:35:42] more to that Lord as Paul said I Die
