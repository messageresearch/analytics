[30:55] straps anyhow
[30:58] that's okay i understand i've sat there
[31:00] with it with through it also
[31:02] um but but anyhow i want to say this on
[31:05] on a
[31:06] positive note i think brother bryan was
[31:08] so excited he forgot to do prayer
[31:09] requests tonight
[31:12] so when he sing the song thank god he
[31:14] set me free he had a lot of meaning in
[31:16] it
[31:17] but we just want to also remember and i
[31:19] want to
[31:20] say this to you i i really i i want to
[31:23] say thank you because this has been
[31:25] quite quite a journey that even that
[31:28] we've been through
[31:29] and it's not then through this when this
[31:32] sickness and things have
[31:33] you know come about within the last year
[31:35] and things like that it's
[31:36] it's been quite a journey that uh really
[31:38] that we've we've not
[31:40] been through uh before or anything and
[31:42] there's a lot of different decisions
[31:44] that had to be made
[31:45] and and i realized within the different
[31:48] decision i want to say
[31:50] to each of you is i certainly appreciate
[31:53] is how that you've handled that and
[31:55] you've taken that
[31:56] and even you know to be here you know to
[31:59] realize that
[32:00] you know it was something that you
[32:03] responded to the leading of the holy
[32:04] spirit
[32:05] here you are you've been here we've had
[32:07] to pray through and find the mind of the
[32:09] lord in different times and
[32:11] when to go into service when to do this
[32:14] and that's really been a reality is that
[32:16] trying to just find the mind of the lord
[32:18] and what to do and different things like
[32:20] that some things done just to try to
[32:21] make people
[32:22] feel comfortable and and so forth but i
[32:25] want to say that i just
[32:26] really appreciate that because that
[32:28] speaks a lot to you of how that within
[32:30] it you caught something that was beyond
[32:33] brother samuel and you caught the
[32:34] leading of the holy spirit
[32:36] and god leads us in times like this this
[32:38] is where we need to know and hear his
[32:40] voice
[32:41] and so these are things that's very very
[32:42] important and i want to just say i
[32:44] really appreciate how that you you
[32:46] handle things you know throughout the
[32:48] time and different things that was asked
[32:49] of you know it wasn't convenient
[32:51] but i really really appreciate that and
[32:54] i want to just say thank you
[32:56] from the bottom of my heart we also want
[32:58] to continue to remember
[33:00] the different ones in in india and some
[33:03] of the other countries and things like
[33:05] that that they
[33:06] um they are dealing with
[33:10] this very thing that we've come through
[33:12] and they
[33:13] are are dealing with some of that and so
[33:16] we just

[33:35] things like that where things have come
[33:37] on different text threads that i'm a
[33:38] part of

[33:58] setups that's in those other countries i
[34:00] tell you what you see things it's just
[34:02] so
[34:03] absolutely antiquated it's so sad
[34:06] of how things are within the hospitals

[34:10] you tell you what one thing i could do
[34:12] when i looked at that i said god

[43:31] amen i thank god for the privilege to be
[43:33] here tonight i
[43:34] appreciate the invitation of your pastor
[43:36] and the
[43:38] confidence that he would place to allow
[43:39] me to come and stand behind this sacred
[43:41] desk i know what that's like when you
[43:43] invite ministers to come and minister
[43:45] the word of god
[43:46] i told samuel i said you're building a
[43:48] church here not tearing one down i meant
[43:50] why you called me i mean so i told him i
[43:53] feel like the least of the least uh we
[43:55] have a small church there in
[43:57] pennsylvania
[43:58] uh maybe run i don't know when
[44:01] everybody's there and all the kids we
[44:03] we might run 120 people and uh we're
[44:06] just not a big group and uh
[44:08] they have mercy on me man and uh they
[44:11] love me so they put up with my faults
[44:13] and my failures but uh
[44:14] i mean i pray that you love me tonight
[44:16] and i can get away with they meant some
[44:18] faults tonight amen i just want to bring
[44:20] greetings from a little church there in
[44:21] pennsylvania
[44:23] i ministered last night to them and then
[44:25] had a real good crowd on wednesday night
[44:28] and i would ask if you would remember
[44:30] sister mary spring in your prayers
[44:32] she just came through an operation this
[44:34] afternoon they uh she'd had a brain
[44:36] operation for a brain aneurysm and she
[44:39] was
[44:39] having some complications with the drain
[44:41] at the top of her head
[44:42] and they couldn't get that thing to quit
[44:44] so they took the drain out and they put
[44:47] a shunt in her
[44:48] her head down into her stomach and uh
[44:50] got a
[44:51] got a um text just before i got to the
[44:55] church tonight that the operation went
[44:57] better than it could ever have been
[44:58] expected it was perfect i mean
[45:01] a lot of people were praying i asked if
[45:02] you would continue to keep her in your
[45:04] prayers
[45:04] uh brother john says she was sleeping he
[45:06] wouldn't respond to his talking but they
[45:08] said that's
[45:08] that's normal amen after having just
[45:10] come through the operation so if you
[45:12] would
[45:12] amen please keep her in your prayers
[45:14] that god would just bring her through
[45:15] completely heal
[45:16] i'm not going to believe for anything
[45:17] less than complete healing and i know my
[45:20] god's a healer
[45:21] and i've seen him healed before i've
[45:23] seen him healing my own body
[45:24] and the prophet of god said he won't
[45:25] heal one person one time and then not
[45:27] heal someone else he wouldn't be god
[45:29] is that right so i know he's going to do
[45:31] the same thing for our sister tonight so
[45:33] if you would just keep praying your
[45:35] prayers and and again i bring greetings
[45:37] from the church there if you have your
[45:38] bibles tonight i want to get right into
[45:39] the word of god
[45:40] i asked brother samuel how long he
[45:43] usually preaches on wednesday night i
[45:44] know we have some brothers that work all
[45:46] day from the wee hours and
[45:48] and sometimes i look back there and i
[45:49] see a couple of them going like this
[45:50] when i'm preaching they're saying hurry
[45:51] up brother jim yeah
[45:52] amen get that over with something amen i
[45:55] understand i'll try to have mercy on you
[45:57] tonight
[45:57] and try to keep it brief so that we
[46:00] don't wear you out so
[46:02] first john chapter 3 if you have your
[46:04] bible first john chapter 3 beginning at
[46:06] the first verse
[46:07] i've been preaching a series back home
[46:09] for about a month or so
[46:11] and on some different things and i leave
[46:13] it and come back to it but
[46:15] i looked at the thought that i've been
[46:17] preaching on is uh
[46:18] it's time to recognize that we are sons
[46:21] of god it's time to recognize the weird
[46:23] how many sons of god we got here tonight
[46:25] amen it's time that we recognize that
[46:27] because we're getting down
[46:29] we're getting down to the end of things
[46:30] here and i don't know about you but a
[46:32] son
[46:32] has privileges that nobody else has
[46:34] we're going to look at that tonight if
[46:36] we could for just a few moments amen
[46:37] first john chapter 3 verse 1.
[46:40] and read like this behold what manner of
[46:43] love the father hath bestowed upon us
[46:45] that we should be called the sons of god
[46:48] therefore the world knoweth us not
[46:50] because it knew him not
[46:52] beloved now i like that it doesn't say
[46:55] going to be
[46:56] doesn't say someday it says beloved now
[46:59] we are
[46:59] the sons of god and it doth not yet
[47:02] appear what we shall be but we know that
[47:04] when he shall appear
[47:05] we shall be like him for we shall see
[47:07] him as he is
[47:09] every man that has this hope in him
[47:11] purifyeth himself
[47:13] even as he is pure let's just ask the
[47:16] lord to bless the reading of his word
[47:17] heavenly father
[47:18] god we bow our heads before you tonight
[47:20] grateful once again to be in the house
[47:22] of god among brothers of like precious
[47:24] faith lord we pray tonight lord god that
[47:26] you would just
[47:26] take the words that you've laid upon my
[47:28] heart lord and and i ask that you would
[47:30] take this thought lord god bless it to
[47:32] the hearing of the people i ask once
[47:34] again lord as i
[47:35] do so many times guard my lips father
[47:37] lest i would say
[47:38] something wrong but father let
[47:39] everything be said to bring this little
[47:41] portion of the body of christ closer to
[47:43] you lord
[47:44] god that's our heart's desire that we
[47:45] might mature and come become
[47:47] that perfected bride that you said
[47:49] you're coming back for he said be
[47:50] perfect lord amen the other way we can
[47:52] be perfect not sinless perfection but as
[47:55] we come to maturity
[47:56] realizing that we are sons of god
[47:58] tonight we pray lord god that you would
[48:00] just guard my lips as i said lord let me
[48:02] say only that which would edify the body
[48:04] of christ lord if there's one here
[48:05] tonight
[48:06] that's sick let them receive their
[48:07] healing as the word of god comes forth
[48:09] there's one here that's
[48:10] downtrodden lord god lift up those hands
[48:12] that hang down lord god
[48:14] lift up that head lord god to the
[48:16] redemption that
[48:17] drawing knives so well so god we pray
[48:19] tonight that you just have your way into
[48:21] service
[48:21] be with those who aren't here tonight
[48:23] for whatever the reason would be that we
[48:24] keep them from the house of god
[48:26] and minister unto them in a special way
[48:28] and we'll be careful to praise you for
[48:29] it all in jesus
[48:30] precious name amen and amen you can be
[48:32] seated this evening
[48:35] amen i just want to i've been i've been
[48:37] preaching a little
[48:38] series on recognizing that we are the
[48:41] sons of god and
[48:42] and uh i just this is one of the
[48:44] messages i preached at home and there
[48:45] were several of them and i just couldn't
[48:47] go
[48:47] decide which way to go and then i was
[48:49] working on a completely different
[48:51] message that i hadn't preached yet
[48:52] and i just started getting panicked
[48:54] thinking about coming i don't
[48:56] i don't go out and preach i'm not one of
[48:57] these roving preachers i mean i preached
[48:59] to my people
[49:01] i preach to my people and like i said
[49:02] they have mercy upon me and they
[49:04] they just overlook my faults and my
[49:06] shortcomings and
[49:08] so i don't go out so i was a little
[49:09] nervous and trying to put that thought
[49:10] together i said no i'm just going to lay
[49:12] that aside and i started on another one
[49:13] i laid that aside and
[49:15] brother samuel and i were talking back
[49:16] in the study there sometimes you don't
[49:18] know where you're going until you get to
[49:19] the pulpit
[49:20] sometimes you're not quite sure and i
[49:21] wasn't quite sure today until i
[49:24] jumped in the car and headed this way
[49:25] and i grabbed the right message i hope
[49:27] so
[49:27] by god's grace i want to speak to you
[49:29] tonight on it's time to recognize
[49:31] that we are sons of god now
[49:34] i like that the word of god says amen am
[49:36] i too loud for you is that hurting your
[49:38] ears or anything okay
[49:39] i got these hearing aids and everything
[49:41] sounds loud to me so
[49:43] amen i don't want to hurt somebody's
[49:45] ears and amen so anyways
[49:47] what we're looking at here tonight it
[49:48] says now we are the sons of god amen
[49:51] what what uh what what love the father
[49:53] has that he would call us his son
[49:56] amen isn't that great to be the son of a
[49:58] son of god amen to be his son tonight
[50:01] hey you know as i say my son and brother
[50:03] samuel's sons they have
[50:04] certain privileges that nobody else has
[50:07] amen
[50:08] there's his his sons they can go to
[50:10] their dad and they can fully well expect
[50:12] him a man
[50:12] to to supply their needs they go to the
[50:15] table hey man guess what brother samuel
[50:17] has the table set they never have to say
[50:19] well brother samuel's wife has a table
[50:21] set they never have to say dad is it
[50:23] okay if i eat no that's a privilege of
[50:25] being a son
[50:26] you just come and feed oh what a
[50:28] privilege we have tonight as sons of god
[50:30] that we can just come here can i take
[50:32] this off brother samuel sure
[50:33] man all right amen i can't
[50:37] i can't fight with a coat on and we're
[50:39] going to fight the devil tonight
[50:41] is that all right amen but but you know
[50:43] we have a right to
[50:44] as a son of god we have privileges that
[50:46] nobody else has
[50:48] amen you don't have the same privileges
[50:50] that samuel's sons back there have
[50:52] amen i don't have the same privileges as
[50:54] his sons have
[50:55] but i am not a son of brother samuel
[50:57] browning i'm a son
[50:58] of jesus christ tonight and i have
[51:00] privileges tonight amen but you know the
[51:02] prophet of god said we live
[51:04] below our privileges how many believes
[51:07] that tonight
[51:07] we live so far below our privileges amen
[51:10] we look at this and we say oh now i'm a
[51:13] son of god
[51:14] it sure don't appear like you're one
[51:15] brother jim
[51:17] i saw what you did last i i've seen the
[51:20] mistake
[51:20] amen i look at my own self and i say oh
[51:22] i could not be his son
[51:24] i could not be a son and think what i
[51:26] thought i could not be his son
[51:28] he made on the way here tonight some guy
[51:30] tried to cut me off and
[51:31] i didn't think his son's thought all
[51:34] right i said oh surely i'm not a son of
[51:37] god amen
[51:38] it doesn't matter what you think it
[51:40] doesn't matter what you say quit living
[51:41] below your privileges and realize
[51:43] it's what god said and god said i'm a
[51:45] son now
[51:46] amen how many believes that tonight it's
[51:49] not when you get good enough it's not
[51:51] when you quit making mistakes it's not
[51:52] when you
[51:53] it may get to the point where you say
[51:54] well now i'm doing a pretty good job
[51:56] then you've lost it then you've really
[51:58] missed it right
[51:59] but church i mean it says here now i'm a
[52:01] son of god amen
[52:03] and sometimes we all how many of them
[52:05] always feel like a son of god
[52:09] i don't always feel like when i'd like
[52:11] to brother hey but tell me you're sick i
[52:13] want to get with you after church
[52:15] amen i don't always feel like a son and
[52:19] therefore when i don't feel like one i
[52:21] start living below my privilege and say
[52:22] well i just don't
[52:23] dare come to the father with that need
[52:25] or i don't dare come to the father with
[52:26] this need hey
[52:27] he knows how he knows how i messed up on
[52:30] the way to samuels all right
[52:32] come on brother come on church how many
[52:34] knows it
[52:35] nobody else messed up on the way to
[52:36] church today did they nobody else made a
[52:38] mistake today or last week or or did or
[52:41] thought something you shouldn't have
[52:42] thought
[52:43] what if we're looking at our own flesh
[52:46] we're looking at this old man amen
[52:48] but god's not looking at the flesh he's
[52:50] looking at our sacrifice tonight how
[52:51] many say amen to that
[52:53] he's not looking at that so we get
[52:54] discouraged we say oh when am i going to
[52:56] be a son the bible says i'm the son now
[52:58] i don't feel like a son now it doesn't
[53:00] matter what you feel
[53:02] it's what god's word says is that right
[53:05] it's not what you feel it's what god's
[53:07] word said
[53:08] brother brahm said this in a message of
[53:09] the eye of servants we would see jesus
[53:11] is it okay
[53:12] i don't have an ipad i'm an old guy
[53:15] hey man i'm going to go oh there it is
[53:20] i told brother samuel i wish i had an
[53:21] ipad my office is stacked with
[53:23] messages with me like this amen amen i
[53:27] got 15 years worth of them stacked up in
[53:29] there and then some i mean
[53:31] but anyhow i'm i'm whipping up my ipad
[53:33] tonight here's what the prophet of god
[53:35] said the message called service we would
[53:36] see jesus
[53:37] it might encourage you i want to
[53:38] encourage you a little bit as christians
[53:40] amen amen and i need some encouragement
[53:42] sometimes
[53:43] because i don't feel like a son of god
[53:46] how many believes it tonight
[53:47] amen amen he said the bible said
[53:51] the bible said that our names were
[53:53] written in the lamb's book of life from
[53:55] before
[53:56] the foundation of the world how many
[53:58] believes that tonight
[53:59] i believe it's over in first peter or
[54:00] something like that he was the lamb
[54:02] slain
[54:02] he redeemed us as the lamb slain from
[54:04] before the foundation of the world amen
[54:06] amen and then over in corinthians i
[54:08] think in some place he says the same
[54:09] thing
[54:10] he says we were predestinated amen it
[54:12] was in galatians ephesians amen it's a
[54:14] fear we were predestinated to be sons of
[54:17] god
[54:18] amen i'm not having to work into it it's
[54:20] not something

[54:33] brother branham said the bible says our
[54:35] names were written on that lamb's book
[54:37] of life from before the foundation of
[54:39] the world when was it
[54:40] when the lamb was slain every person
[54:42] that was ever to be saved was associated
[54:44] with that lamb
[54:45] in the slaying before the foundation of
[54:48] the world
[54:49] oh i like that i look at myself and i
[54:52] look at myself today
[54:54] and i don't feel like a son that god
[54:55] says oh i saw you as a son from before
[54:57] the foundation of the world
[54:59] oh i like that church it's not what i
[55:02] see it's what he sees
[55:04] you're going to believe something you're
[55:05] going to believe what you see or you're
[55:07] going to believe what the word says
[55:09] i choose tonight to believe what god's
[55:11] word said

[1:10:11] if the people if we could just get that
[1:10:13] readily we just have faith that we are
[1:10:15] what the word of god says we are
[1:10:17] sons probably god said this and that
[1:10:19] same quote
[1:10:20] he said if the people get the true
[1:10:21] revelation of the true church
[1:10:23] the true sons of god and what she is she
[1:10:25] will stand and
[1:10:26] she can stand and do the greater works
[1:10:28] she will become an invincible
[1:10:30] army oh church i like it i hear somebody
[1:10:34] i hear people preach we're going to be
[1:10:35] coming invincible we're going to come
[1:10:37] i want to say we're not going to become
[1:10:38] one i say we are one amen

[1:11:17] i'm ever going to make it i fear that
[1:11:19] i'm never going to make it a bit

[1:11:26] fear john that's right
[1:11:27] don't fear john page 64 of the church

[1:14:08] your sins might be scarlet in your own
[1:14:10] eyes

[1:14:14] one time he said there's the worst enemy
[1:14:16] that old william brown has
[1:14:17] right there's the guy that condemns me
[1:14:19] the most there's the guy that i have the
[1:14:21] most trouble with yes sir i mean oh i
[1:14:23] say oh i surely couldn't be a son and
[1:14:25] think that i did that it then church it

[1:14:29] the bible says though your sins being
[1:14:31] scarlet amen i want to tell you one
[1:14:33] thing prophet god said they might be
[1:14:35] scarlet your sins might be scarlet he
[1:14:36] said
[1:14:37] but there is a red streak of blood
[1:14:39] running down through the word of god
[1:14:40] from genesis to revelation
[1:14:42] and he says when you look at red through
[1:14:44] red all you see
[1:14:45] is white tonight i like that yeah
[1:14:49] i mean red through red is white amen
[1:14:51] though your sins be a scarlet god looks
[1:14:53] through the blood of jesus christ he
[1:14:55] looked at the sacrifice
[1:14:56] he said they're white as though
[1:14:58] hallelujah amen
[1:14:59] glory curse that you feel a little more
[1:15:01] like a son now
[1:15:02] yeah amen he doesn't see my sins anymore
[1:15:07] when you confess your sin and claim the
[1:15:09] blood of jesus christ for those sins
[1:15:11] amen
[1:15:11] the sin problem is over
[1:15:15] church the sin problem is over
[1:15:18] they said when was it over the moment
[1:15:20] you believed hey
[1:15:21] the moment you believed what the word
[1:15:23] said the moment you were placed as a son
[1:15:25] when you put your trust in the blood the
[1:15:26] sin
[1:15:27] problem is over he said god is looking
[1:15:30] through red
[1:15:31] and he sees you just as white as he sees
[1:15:33] you it's just like he said here in first
[1:15:35] john
[1:15:35] i see you as a son with all the
[1:15:38] privileges of the son
[1:15:40] god looking through the blood he doesn't
[1:15:42] see you no more as a sinner
[1:15:44] he sees you redeemed amen now you know
[1:15:47] when you redeem something that means you
[1:15:49] have to
[1:15:49] buy it back that doesn't mean you never
[1:15:52] did make a mistake
[1:15:54] that didn't mean you never win we're out
[1:15:56] in sin but he said he redeemed you
[1:15:58] amen when did he do that from before the
[1:16:01] foundation of the world when the lamb
[1:16:02] was slain i have always been a son in
[1:16:04] the mind of god
[1:16:06] amen church him and it's our own mind
[1:16:08] where the battle brother
[1:16:09] said that's where the greatest battle
[1:16:11] has ever fought is right in the mind
[1:16:12] amen yes sir oh i couldn't ever i'll
[1:16:15] never make it no
[1:16:16] you'll never be good enough but he was
[1:16:18] amen he was a perfect sacrifice glory
[1:16:22] amen that's the reason we can be perfect
[1:16:25] not perfect and sinless perfection
[1:16:27] we're perfect in his the eyes of god
[1:16:29] because why because we are found in him
[1:16:32] under the blood amen amen that's the
[1:16:35] reason he said
[1:16:36] be perfect your father heaven is perfect
[1:16:38] amen i'm not perfect
[1:16:40] that shocked some of you
[1:16:43] i but i got a big amen if i'd have been
[1:16:45] preaching at home
[1:16:47] i'm not perfect in your sight he said
[1:16:49] you may not be perfect in my sight all
[1:16:51] right
[1:16:52] he said what about god's sight all right
[1:16:54] god says
[1:16:55] you're a perfect son of god tonight
[1:16:58] that's right he says there's where it
[1:17:00] lays if you're born again into the body
[1:17:02] of christ
[1:17:03] then god looks at you as a perfect son
[1:17:06] of god amen
[1:17:07] perfect as christ was himself amen he
[1:17:10] says
[1:17:11] we all say amen i'm perfect oh church i
[1:17:14] may quit condemning myself
[1:17:16] saying i'll never be a son he already
[1:17:17] said you're a son
[1:17:20] i'm not perfect in your side nothing you
[1:17:23] can do
[1:17:23] to get you perfect there's nothing you
[1:17:26] can do to bring you to perfection
[1:17:29] amen he says no it's only if it could
[1:17:32] only be done by works he says you can't
[1:17:33] do nothing at
[1:17:34] all it's by grace through faith in the
[1:17:37] shed blood of jesus christ that he sees
[1:17:39] you perfect in heaven amen
[1:17:40] god has given you this offer amen but
[1:17:43] it's up to you
[1:17:44] to accept it it's up to me to accept my
[1:17:47] faith what he says
[1:17:48] i am tonight have you trusted in the
[1:17:51] blood
[1:17:51] then he says you're a son if you trusted
[1:17:54] in the blood that was shed before the
[1:17:55] foundation
[1:17:56] then you always were a son he said
[1:17:59] that's right
[1:18:00] he says there you are christ was he says
[1:18:02] he looks at you as perfect as christ was
[1:18:04] himself
[1:18:04] nothing you can do he made it only by
[1:18:06] the grace to the faith
[1:18:08] in the shed blood of jesus christ that's
[1:18:10] the offer that you have to accept in his
[1:18:12] sight your perfect
[1:18:13] ahead washed by the blood of the lamb
[1:18:15] without thought without blemish without
[1:18:17] spot
[1:18:17] by grace you're saved through faith amen
[1:18:20] in the shed blood of jesus christ
[1:18:21] aren't you glad for that amen i'm not
[1:18:24] i'm not
[1:18:25] perfect i'm not i'm not a son because i
[1:18:27] believe god sent a prophet come on now
[1:18:29] i'm not son because i can quote all the
[1:18:31] quotes i'm not son because i never make
[1:18:33] a mistake
[1:18:34] i'm a son because i'm in him so that i
[1:18:36] was placed in him it is for the
[1:18:38] foundation of the world
[1:18:42] but the reason we have all the struggles
[1:18:44] that we have
[1:18:45] the reason that brother brown said the
[1:18:47] church is backing up all the time and
[1:18:48] finding themselves feared in fact we're
[1:18:50] just like the apostle paul how many
[1:18:51] believes he was the son of god i surely
[1:18:54] hope you do
[1:18:55] amen i believe he was the son of god but
[1:18:57] you know he had the same
[1:18:59] problem he had the same oh what's that
[1:19:01] word that i want to say the complex
[1:19:03] that we have all right amen
[1:19:06] he got out there he says when i want to
[1:19:08] do good evil is present
[1:19:10] when i try to do something he says i do
[1:19:12] what i don't want to do
[1:19:13] when i when i want to do this i do
[1:19:15] something that i don't want to do
[1:19:16] he said oh it just goes on and on how
[1:19:18] many have ever felt like paul amen
[1:19:20] oh and i said i'm never going to do that
[1:19:22] again i'm never going to lose my temper
[1:19:24] again i'm never going to sass my mom
[1:19:26] again i'm never going to do this again
[1:19:28] and the next day boom right now
[1:19:31] all right all right come on brother
[1:19:34] why because i'm stuck in this old
[1:19:36] corruptable shell right here
[1:19:39] and as long as i'm there i mean brother
[1:19:41] brahm said this old sticky carnation
[1:19:43] will give you trouble
[1:19:44] until the day you lay it down amen and
[1:19:47] one day i'm going to lay it down
[1:19:48] but there's been a little seed
[1:19:50] transplanted into there of the son of
[1:19:52] god and when it comes forth
[1:19:53] it's going to come forth to notice the
[1:19:55] life as the son of god hallelujah
[1:19:58] it's not coming up with this old couple
[1:20:00] why because that life has been put out
[1:20:02] the spirit of god come down burned out
[1:20:04] that nature
[1:20:05] and put his nature in there amen
[1:20:07] hallelujah i'm a born again son of god
[1:20:09] amen
[1:20:11] the old wretched man that i am said paul
[1:20:15] who shall deliver me from this old
[1:20:17] wretched man that i am
[1:20:18] the bible says i thank god through jesus
[1:20:21] christ
[1:20:21] our lord amen amen but you might feel
[1:20:24] wretched but thank god through jesus
[1:20:26] christ the lord
[1:20:27] i've been placed as the son tonight
[1:20:30] there's therefore now no condemnation
[1:20:32] amen
[1:20:33] no condemnation to them that are in
[1:20:35] christ jesus
[1:20:36] who walk after the who don't walk out of
[1:20:38] flesh but walk after the spirit
[1:20:41] amen that's right it's when that spirit
[1:20:44] come down
[1:20:45] brother says that's the adoption that's
[1:20:46] the placing the holy spirit that he
[1:20:48] wrapped him in that robe of
[1:20:50] righteousness amen
[1:20:51] he said this is my beloved son i'm out
[1:20:53] of transparent hear ye him
[1:20:55] amen and he gave us the same authority
[1:20:57] whatever you say
[1:20:58] he said i'll perform it amen that's a
[1:21:01] privilege of the son it meant all his
[1:21:03] authority is now in me
[1:21:05] how many believes that amen the savior's
[1:21:07] given us a full
[1:21:09] pardon a full pardon through his blood
[1:21:12] amen you have a right to approach the
[1:21:14] father as the son with all the authority
[1:21:17] of the father amen behind you amen
[1:21:20] brother branham said when that son was
[1:21:22] placed after the holy spirit was his
[1:21:24] tutor
[1:21:24] amen he said he's doing everything like
[1:21:26] you would do he he's just lining up with
[1:21:28] your word amen
[1:21:29] but when we line up with this word with
[1:21:31] this message and we just find ourselves
[1:21:32] lined up we're not going to say we're
[1:21:33] not going to make mistakes but we're
[1:21:35] lining up with the word
[1:21:36] when you make a mistake first john 1 9
[1:21:38] confess your sins he's faithful just
[1:21:39] it's already taken care of amen how many
[1:21:42] believes it amen
[1:21:44] so we get to that place and we get to
[1:21:47] that place that
[1:21:48] we can put our trust in him put our
[1:21:50] trust in that what
[1:21:51] what the word says we are not what we
[1:21:53] see in ourselves not the mistakes that
[1:21:54] we see
[1:21:55] she keeps saying that brother jim but
[1:21:56] you know i think there's a lot of people
[1:21:58] that struggle
[1:21:59] with that very question right right yes
[1:22:02] if not brother brown would have said i
[1:22:03] see the church backing up all the time i
[1:22:05] see him in fear what do you got to be
[1:22:07] afraid of he said
[1:22:09] what do we have to be afraid of we are
[1:22:11] sons tonight
[1:22:13] hey you know what we're afraid of we're
[1:22:14] afraid of our old corruptable flesh
[1:22:17] we're afraid of what we see in ourselves
[1:22:19] that's right he said
[1:22:20] don't look at what you see look at what
[1:22:23] god sees
[1:22:24] quit acting like the prodigal son amen
[1:22:26] how many remembers the story of the
[1:22:27] prophet
[1:22:28] [Music]
[1:22:30] brother samuel you said 45 minutes i got
[1:22:32] six more minutes and i think i got about
[1:22:34] seven more here
[1:22:40] i'll try to get i'll try to get through
[1:22:41] this i only got a couple more pages is
[1:22:42] that okay
[1:22:44] hey man i can go on for more but i got
[1:22:46] i'll do a couple more pages and i'll and
[1:22:48] i'll let you your poor brothers at work
[1:22:50] thought they go home and get some rest
[1:22:51] and i gotta drive two and
[1:22:53] two hours to get home not two and a half
[1:22:55] two hours to get home
[1:22:56] amen anyhow quit acting like the
[1:22:59] prodigal son i said you know that was
[1:23:01] the prodigal son's problem
[1:23:03] maybe it wasn't that he wasn't the son
[1:23:04] he was he was born in the family as a
[1:23:07] son is that right
[1:23:08] we find this story over luke the 15th
[1:23:10] chapter i just like to share with you a
[1:23:11] little bit you get the idea what i'm
[1:23:12] trying to say here
[1:23:13] he said there was a certain man he said
[1:23:15] he had two sons
[1:23:17] and he said the younger of them said to
[1:23:18] his father give me the portion of goods
[1:23:21] that befalleth me
[1:23:22] and he delivered unto him his living he
[1:23:25] divided unto them his living
[1:23:27] you know what he did he gave me
[1:23:29] everything he had as a son
[1:23:31] that what he did he gave me all his
[1:23:34] i inherited everything he had
[1:23:38] but there is a son i got the riches of
[1:23:40] the father every one of us in here
[1:23:42] tonight son you've got the riches of the
[1:23:44] father you've got it with you
[1:23:46] but how many have ever used it all
[1:23:48] wisely
[1:23:49] all right that's good listen to what he
[1:23:51] said
[1:23:53] he said after many days the younger son
[1:23:55] gathered all together took a journey
[1:23:57] into a far country
[1:23:58] he got away from his father and the
[1:24:01] bible says he wasted his substance
[1:24:03] with righteous living in that old
[1:24:06] corrupted
[1:24:07] flesh nature
[1:24:10] i know none of you have ever done that
[1:24:14] but it took me a long time to realize i
[1:24:16] was a son
[1:24:18] i looked back and i could see the wasted
[1:24:20] years that i had
[1:24:22] oh you young people that were born in a
[1:24:23] messy church you young people that have

[1:25:05] land how many believe there's a famine
[1:25:07] in the land now for the hearing of the
[1:25:08] word of god

[1:25:10] to the center of the country and began
[1:25:12] to feed the swines in the field
[1:25:13] and it would feign had filled his belly
[1:25:15] with a husband the swine did he
[1:25:17] and but no man gave unto him he was in
[1:25:20] bad shape

[1:25:23] a son in that kind of shape with
[1:25:25] everything the father had laid in his
[1:25:27] lap
[1:25:28] that's where we find ourselves sometimes
[1:25:30] all right
[1:25:31] but did it change the fact that he was a
[1:25:33] son i'm not a bit
[1:25:35] no you know what kept him in that pig
[1:25:37] pen

[1:26:12] will give you if there's one here
[1:26:12] that'll feed you tonight
[1:26:14] yes amen who is it it's the father
[1:26:17] and when he realized he quit looking for
[1:26:19] man to feed him he quit looking for his
[1:26:21] own self defeating
[1:26:22] he quit looking for his own self to be
[1:26:24] he said no man would give him anything
[1:26:26] church amen you're not going to get what
[1:26:28] you need from a man tonight
[1:26:30] you're going to get what you get tonight
[1:26:31] what you need tonight from the one who
[1:26:33] was slain from before the
[1:26:35] of the world amen amen that's what this
[1:26:38] man come to that's the revelation that
[1:26:40] that's the faith that the son had to
[1:26:42] come to tonight that's what
[1:26:43] all of us got to come to amen he said
[1:26:46] when he came to himself you know what it
[1:26:49] was
[1:26:50] a lot of us need to come to ourselves
[1:26:52] tonight how many believe that
[1:26:55] he said he when he came to himself all
[1:26:58] of a sudden he realized wait a second
[1:26:59] the scripture said
[1:27:01] now i'm a son of god what am i doing in
[1:27:03] this paper
[1:27:05] now i'm the son of god amen i put myself
[1:27:07] in that pig pen
[1:27:09] we put ourselves in that condition we
[1:27:11] stay sick because we don't believe the
[1:27:13] authority we have as a son
[1:27:15] to cast that thing off us we stay in sin
[1:27:17] and we stay discouraged because we see
[1:27:19] our mistake it may cast that thing off
[1:27:21] without the authority of the father with
[1:27:22] you tonight amen
[1:27:24] amen the bible says he came to himself
[1:27:28] he meant the faith in who he was started
[1:27:30] to trickle down and if i wait a second
[1:27:32] i'm the son of god
[1:27:33] hey man wait a second i'm a son he said
[1:27:35] how many hired servants in my father's
[1:27:37] house
[1:27:38] have bread to spare and i perished with
[1:27:40] hunger
[1:27:42] i like this part right here he says i
[1:27:44] will rise
[1:27:45] i will rise church it's time for this
[1:27:48] bride to rise up tonight amen
[1:27:51] i'm going to rise out of this old pig
[1:27:52] i'm going to rise out of this place that
[1:27:54] i have my health
[1:27:55] self-held amen
[1:27:58] and i will say to my father i have
[1:28:01] sinned against heaven
[1:28:02] and before thee amen what's he doing i
[1:28:05] don't know about you but this sounds
[1:28:06] like the heart of a repentant son
[1:28:09] amen how many have ever said oh god i
[1:28:11] did it again
[1:28:12] oh father oh forgive me he's not going
[1:28:14] to say oh
[1:28:15] i gave you everything and you wasted it
[1:28:17] said get out of here no
[1:28:19] he said he didn't do that amen
[1:28:22] he said if you would confess your sins
[1:28:24] he's faithful and just to forgive you he
[1:28:26] said they cleanse you from
[1:28:28] all unrighteousness not just some of
[1:28:31] them but all that unrighteousness that
[1:28:33] we hold ourselves i couldn't be a son
[1:28:34] like helen righteous i look amen
[1:28:37] come to confess to him and it's all
[1:28:39] taken care of under the blood
[1:28:43] i will rise and go to my father i will
[1:28:45] say to him father i have sinned against
[1:28:47] thee
[1:28:48] he says and i am no more worthy to be
[1:28:50] called your son there ain't one of us in
[1:28:52] here worthy to be called man
[1:28:54] oh but behold what manner of love the
[1:28:56] father has
[1:28:57] amen bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:29:00] called
[1:29:00] the sons of god regardless of our mess
[1:29:04] regardless of how many mistakes we've
[1:29:06] ever made he said
[1:29:07] i will go to him but he arose and went
[1:29:09] to his father he meant what was that i
[1:29:11] believe the holy spirit was dealing with
[1:29:13] that son
[1:29:14] i believe that holy spirit was dealing
[1:29:15] with that son there that pig pen and
[1:29:17] that mess that he was in i wonder
[1:29:18] tonight if the holy spirit isn't dealing
[1:29:20] with some people here tonight
[1:29:22] like he dealt with me when i come on
[1:29:23] this message amen i wonder if tonight
[1:29:25] didn't deal with some people saying hey
[1:29:27] it's time that you rise up above this
[1:29:29] thing
[1:29:29] it's time that you get out of that mess
[1:29:31] that you put yourself it's time that you
[1:29:32] get out of that old same pen
[1:29:34] that you put yourself into i didn't
[1:29:37] place you there i said you were a son
[1:29:39] amen
[1:29:41] amen i'm not worthy to be called a son
[1:29:43] there's not one of us we're all born and
[1:29:45] sin shaped and iniquity come to the
[1:29:47] world's speaking life but he doesn't
[1:29:48] look at that he looks at my sacrifice
[1:29:50] amen
[1:29:53] he said he rose and he came to his
[1:29:55] father it was yet a far
[1:29:57] way off his father saw him and had
[1:29:58] compassion he ran and fell on his neck
[1:30:00] and he kissed him
[1:30:01] i i was listening to a message or not a
[1:30:03] message a preacher
[1:30:05] preacher message on the on the radio
[1:30:06] once and i hope i don't lose my thought
[1:30:08] when i go here just popped into my head
[1:30:10] you mean look samuel that's why we
[1:30:12] preached so long to all that stuff that
[1:30:13] pops in our heads
[1:30:14] rabbit trails but
[1:30:17] listen to this guy amen he was from
[1:30:19] egypt and he's still on the radio i
[1:30:21] can't remember his name
[1:30:22] but anyhow it doesn't matter and then he
[1:30:25] has a radio
[1:30:26] ministry and i used to drive truck i go
[1:30:27] down the road and all night long i'd
[1:30:29] listen to that xm radio and all
[1:30:31] each preacher that would come on i'd
[1:30:32] listen to him some were so far out there
[1:30:33] in the left field but some of them had
[1:30:34] some good thoughts
[1:30:36] but i like this thought he said that
[1:30:40] scripture the prodigal son where he said
[1:30:41] his father ran to him his father
[1:30:45] ran to him he said he said you don't
[1:30:48] know the significance of that scripture
[1:30:51] until you have lived in egypt where this
[1:30:53] was written over in the country where in
[1:30:54] the middle east where this was written
[1:30:56] he said after a man was 30 years old
[1:30:59] amen to run
[1:31:00] was undignified to run
[1:31:03] and it was a disgrace but when he saw
[1:31:06] his son
[1:31:07] he didn't worry about disgrace he didn't
[1:31:09] worry about what people that can't worry
[1:31:11] about going to the cross was spit on his
[1:31:13] face he ran to me amen he ran to me
[1:31:16] and he gave me his life and then he gave
[1:31:18] me my thoughts for me
[1:31:20] oh church archer glad for a god who
[1:31:22] doesn't worry about the straight but he
[1:31:24] loved us enough the place that has a son
[1:31:27] oh i like that
[1:31:34] what i'm doing wrong here brother samuel
[1:31:36] but if i'm doing something wrong sorry
[1:31:38] amen he said i'm not worthy to be called
[1:31:41] your son
[1:31:43] he came to his father and he ran and
[1:31:45] kissed him
[1:31:46] and he said the son said to the father
[1:31:48] i've sinned against heaven
[1:31:49] and in thy sight he may see he's still
[1:31:51] putting himself in the pig pen
[1:31:53] i'm not worthy to be called your son oh

[1:31:57] just want something to eat

[1:36:48] you recognize who you are amen while you
[1:36:50] still have a chance amen
[1:36:52] it's time to recognize that now we are
[1:36:55] the sons
[1:36:55] of god not will be not when we get good
[1:36:58] enough
[1:36:59] now we quit messing up amen he bet that
[1:37:00] was all taken care of even when he was
[1:37:02] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:37:04] he called me a son then he predestinated
[1:37:06] me to be placed
[1:37:07] as a son amen adopt you i was
[1:37:10] predestinated to that adoption place
[1:37:13] aren't you glad of that tonight amen
[1:37:16] he said we're coming to occlusion that
[1:37:18] eternal logos
[1:37:23] you can't do that with an ipad he said
[1:37:26] we're coming to occlusion that eternal
[1:37:27] logos god
[1:37:28] was manifest in the sun how may say amen
[1:37:32] he said and in jesus dwelt the fullness
[1:37:34] of the godhead bodily
[1:37:35] he says and that eternal one was the
[1:37:38] father
[1:37:38] manifested in the flesh let's say amen
[1:37:42] and thereby gain the title of son even
[1:37:45] so we
[1:37:46] eternal in his thoughts and then eternal
[1:37:48] in his thoughts before the foundation of
[1:37:50] the world of god's lord says
[1:37:52] is that right eternal his thoughts in
[1:37:54] our turn
[1:37:55] became a many-membered spoken word seed
[1:37:58] bride manifested in the flesh
[1:38:02] i become a son of god manifested in the
[1:38:05] flesh amen
[1:38:06] he said and those eternal thoughts now
[1:38:09] manifested in the flesh amen how many
[1:38:11] believes you were a thought
[1:38:12] and the father said well i would bless
[1:38:14] god i was no thought or an attribute
[1:38:16] you better say you were i was a thought
[1:38:18] and an attribute before the foundation
[1:38:20] of the world he saw me as a son amen
[1:38:22] that's how he thought of me that's how
[1:38:24] he thought of you yes amen he said
[1:38:26] there you were those eternal thoughts
[1:38:28] manifested in the flesh
[1:38:29] are now called the sons of god just like
[1:38:32] we are called tonight amen
[1:38:34] amen he said you did not become seed
[1:38:38] by the rebirth he said you were seed and
[1:38:41] therefore
[1:38:41] you could be reborn yes sir he says for
[1:38:45] only in the elect is there anything that
[1:38:47] can be
[1:38:48] reborn because there was seed there
[1:38:50] that's the reason you could be quickened
[1:38:52] because in non-seed
[1:38:53] there is nothing to quicken but because
[1:38:56] god put his seed in you
[1:38:57] before the foundation of the world amen
[1:39:00] he quickened it one day
[1:39:01] i came to myself and i said i'll realize
[1:39:03] i'm a son of god tonight amen
[1:39:06] how many are glad to be sons

[1:39:11] carefully
[1:39:12] he brought you back he brought you back
[1:39:15] into fellowship
[1:39:16] he saw you'd make a mistake but he said
[1:39:18] his son he's had him slain before the
[1:39:20] foundation world to redeem you tonight
[1:39:22] amen redeemed means to buy back to
[1:39:24] restore to the original
[1:39:26] owner god by his death and the shed
[1:39:30] blood

[1:39:37] bride son of god tonight amen through
[1:39:40] his blood
[1:39:41] amen
[1:39:44] he said that's why he said why do you do
[1:39:46] that because you always were
[1:39:48] a sheep you always were a son
[1:39:51] you weren't a pig or something out here
[1:39:53] and was changed into his son he said no
[1:39:55] that seed was always hidden
[1:39:58] that's why it could be reborn be
[1:40:00] reclaimed as a son
[1:40:03] he said we were in his thoughts of god
[1:40:05] and expressed to the flesh we have come
[1:40:06] today when we hear his voice the word
[1:40:10] and hear that voice something we can we
[1:40:13] become aware
[1:40:14] of the father calling us just like that
[1:40:16] prodigal son
[1:40:17] there was something he came to himself
[1:40:18] but one day he said i realized the
[1:40:20] fathers calling me to get out of this
[1:40:22] place and take my position as a son
[1:40:25] he recognized we recognize that we're
[1:40:27] sons of god how many remember
[1:40:29] when you come to that realization you
[1:40:31] recognize hey i'm a son of god tonight
[1:40:33] i'm a son of god tonight i'm a son of
[1:40:36] god tonight
[1:40:37] as a son of god i mean i have a right i
[1:40:40] have all the authority of the father
[1:40:41] behind me i like what he said about
[1:40:42] shamgar oh i'll never shut up and then
[1:40:44] i've got to quit
[1:40:45] but he said about shamgar you know what
[1:40:47] he was defeated he was hiding he was
[1:40:49] cowardly right amen but all of a sudden
[1:40:51] he remembered the promise hey wait a
[1:40:53] second i'm an israelite
[1:40:54] i'm a son of abraham i got to sign a
[1:40:57] circumcision on me
[1:40:59] those devils can't come against me he
[1:41:01] said he grabbed an old ox goat and he
[1:41:02] defeated him amen
[1:41:04] church say man we ought to grab ahold of
[1:41:06] the promise of god and defeat that devil
[1:41:08] today i'm a son
[1:41:10] [Music]
[1:41:14] there was a voice inside you called out
[1:41:16] just like it did to that prodigal son
[1:41:18] save me father i'm returning to do and
[1:41:22] he received us
[1:41:24] as a son aren't you glad tonight that he
[1:41:27] did that
[1:41:29] but i like this and i'm gonna close with
[1:41:31] this thought

[1:41:37] ernest fulcher meeting to virginia one
[1:41:39] time the guy said i'm closing
[1:41:41] and i'm closing and i'm closing he
[1:41:43] closed for about an hour
[1:41:44] and the last time he said i'm closing
[1:41:46] brother samuel got up and he says you're
[1:41:47] closed

[1:42:00] but i'm gonna close with this thought
[1:42:01] tonight
[1:42:02] [Music]
[1:42:03] he says it took me a long time it took
[1:42:06] that prodigal son a long time to re
[1:42:08] recognize that he was a son brother
[1:42:10] branham said a son of god can go a long
[1:42:12] time
[1:42:13] before he recognized he's a son how many
[1:42:16] read where he said that in the message
[1:42:18] but i liked what he said after that it
[1:42:20] really through my heart
[1:42:21] he says in fact a lot of true christians
[1:42:23] are like the story
[1:42:24] of that little baby eagle amen
[1:42:28] how many knows that eagles are the true
[1:42:29] sons of god amen

[1:46:20] and afterwards i knew one of the
[1:46:21] brothers sam pitzenbar went to the
[1:46:23] church i got to
[1:46:24] he worked on the railroad where i used
[1:46:25] to work him in he said what did you

[1:46:47] some books of brother brown's message
[1:46:48] books and i took them home
[1:46:51] and the more i read them the more i
[1:46:53] feasted the more i realized i was
[1:46:55] hearing a cry
[1:46:55] from something i never heard oh glory
[1:46:58] came
[1:46:59] in i had took a long time for me to
[1:47:01] realize that i was a son tonight
[1:47:04] sometimes it takes us a long time
[1:47:05] brother brown to realize
[1:47:07] that we are sons amen the true eagle the
[1:47:10] true
[1:47:10] type of a believer the true believer he
[1:47:12] said the farmer took that egg
[1:47:13] placed it out of the hand in due time
[1:47:15] the eggs hacked out the baby chicks are
[1:47:17] doing along just fine listen to that
[1:47:18] cluck pluck
[1:47:19] but that little eagle said something's
[1:47:20] wrong that's how many believes that
[1:47:23] something's wrong when you hear
[1:47:24] something contrary to the message all of
[1:47:25] a sudden boom something's wrong
[1:47:28] that's the holy ghost in you that placed
[1:47:30] you as a son it checks you the moment
[1:47:32] you hear that word
[1:47:33] there's something wrong with that
[1:47:35] brother amen that's not the word
[1:47:38] the word said i'm a son amen i mean oh
[1:47:40] but you can't be a son the word said i'm
[1:47:42] the son
[1:47:43] amen it takes some people a long time to
[1:47:46] realize that we're southern but one day
[1:47:49] oh one day way up in the air that eagle
[1:47:52] put that life in that little egg he said
[1:47:54] it flew over that barnyard
[1:47:56] oh brother bill he flew over that
[1:47:59] barnyard and he let out a screen
[1:48:01] and he said oh just like that prodigal
[1:48:03] son down there
[1:48:04] he heard something called rise up rise
[1:48:07] up and get back to where you belong amen
[1:48:10] he said he heard that scream and
[1:48:12] something stirred down inside of him
[1:48:14] he had never heard the cry of an eagle
[1:48:16] before he said but when he heard that
[1:48:18] first scream
[1:48:19] something in him stirred and he longed
[1:48:21] to launch toward it
[1:48:23] oh church when i stepped into that
[1:48:25] church out on route 18
[1:48:26] i heard something i never heard for the
[1:48:28] first time and i realized
[1:48:29] i'm not a denominational chicken amen
[1:48:32] i'm a son of god amen
[1:48:37] i said well what do i do about it amen
[1:48:40] he was stirred the prodigal son was
[1:48:42] stirred
[1:48:42] but he's got to do something about it
[1:48:44] [Music]
[1:48:45] and he said that voice
[1:48:47] that spirit of god screamed out to me he
[1:48:49] says just get out of there
[1:48:52] just rise up just flap your wings and
[1:48:54] get out of that place and come to what
[1:48:56] the word is
[1:48:57] calling you to come to you he said
[1:48:59] that's right
[1:49:00] he acted like a chicken for a while but
[1:49:02] he couldn't be satisfied
[1:49:03] he always was and he began to beat his
[1:49:06] way
[1:49:07] and he hurled himself into the air amen
[1:49:09] oh god aren't you glad tonight he rose
[1:49:11] are you rose out of the chicken pan into
[1:49:13] the revealed word of god for this hour
[1:49:15] amen
[1:49:16] he acted like a chicken for a while
[1:49:19] church we might have acted like we're
[1:49:20] not sons of god but it's time to start
[1:49:22] acting like what we are today
[1:49:27] can't be satisfied with anything else he
[1:49:30] said but when he heard that great eagle
[1:49:32] he came to his it came to his own place
[1:49:36] he said and once a true son of god hears
[1:49:38] the cry of the spirit by the word
[1:49:41] he too you too will realize
[1:49:44] that you would and you realize that you
[1:49:46] are the son of god and you will run to
[1:49:48] that great prophet eagle
[1:49:50] and you will be forever seated in
[1:49:51] heavenly places in christ
[1:49:53] jesus amen amen how many have heard that
[1:49:56] eagle cry tonight you're a son
[1:49:58] i mean get out of that mountain get out
[1:50:00] of that self-condemnation
[1:50:02] and rise up above it all like the
[1:50:03] prophet said it's time to go back to the
[1:50:06] father tonight
[1:50:06] and go back to the word the father said
[1:50:08] i am a
[1:50:10] son of god tonight would you stand your
[1:50:12] feet with me

[1:50:28] the tune all wrong
[1:50:29] amen but church it's time we set our
[1:50:31] wings to the wind of faith tonight
[1:50:33] it meant faith in what the word of god
[1:50:34] says the word of god says i'm a son
[1:50:36] tonight

[1:50:41] know you are now a son of god with all
[1:50:44] the authority of the father behind it

[1:55:55] [Music]
[1:56:00] amen how many are blessed amen amen
[1:56:03] lord i've been really really blessed
[1:56:04] really edified
[1:56:06] you know it's just ways that the holy
[1:56:08] spirit god knows just what we have
[1:56:10] need of you know it's just how to speak
[1:56:12] to our hearts there's so many
[1:56:14] so many points that the holy spirit was
[1:56:16] just bringing out tonight
[1:56:19] our sonship is not based on our works
[1:56:23] [Music]
[1:56:24] your authority in any situation is not
[1:56:27] based on your works
[1:56:28] but the authority is based in the blood
[1:56:33] that's where our nature on the inside
[1:56:36] has been changed and that's what you can
[1:56:37] really identify with
[1:56:39] is that life that was there within the
[1:56:43] blood
[1:56:44] this is this is why brother brahma said
[1:56:46] even when times here when jesus was
[1:56:48] facing a whole group of demons
[1:56:51] he didn't have to have a prayer meeting
[1:56:53] he just addressed the situation
[1:56:56] there are situations that i'll just be
[1:56:58] honest with you i would have liked to
[1:56:59] have had a prayer meeting
[1:57:01] before i had to deal with that situation
[1:57:03] but
[1:57:04] everything doesn't come when it's
[1:57:06] convenient hey we need this we need to
[1:57:08] come for this or this situation
[1:57:11] but this is the times that we realize
[1:57:13] our authority
[1:57:14] is not based on how how regular how long
[1:57:18] we pray
[1:57:18] how many tapes we listen to that's all
[1:57:20] works
[1:57:22] we believe in that we feed on the word
[1:57:24] of god but that's not what our authority
[1:57:26] is
[1:57:27] you might have had a week that seems
[1:57:29] like things are all tied up and
[1:57:31] everything else
[1:57:32] that does not affect your authority
[1:57:35] your authority is not based on your
[1:57:38] works
[1:57:40] your authority is based on the word
[1:57:43] and the blood has already spoken
[1:57:47] amen so it's not about it's like how the
[1:57:49] lord was bringing it
[1:57:50] sometimes our feelings our feelings
[1:57:53] there's times in our feelings
[1:57:54] we don't feel like a son of god
[1:57:58] but this is the time as the holy spirit
[1:58:01] was speaking to us
[1:58:02] to take what the word has said when you
[1:58:05] take
[1:58:06] what the word is saying to you and
[1:58:07] recognize that's his voice
[1:58:09] he's speaking to me let that supersede
[1:58:12] our feelings
[1:58:14] let it supersede our thoughts you stand
[1:58:17] right upon that word
[1:58:19] thought it was so good how the holy
[1:58:20] spirit brought it to night
[1:58:22] that here as a the battleground
[1:58:26] bringing that right out the battleground
[1:58:28] to where that
[1:58:29] as in our thinking all those things it
[1:58:32] ties together sometimes
[1:58:34] right in our thinking thoughts the
[1:58:36] battle
[1:58:37] that is being fought brother brown
[1:58:40] talked about even standing right at the
[1:58:42] pulpit

[1:58:44] branham what must i do
[1:58:46] when satan continues the devil is
[1:58:48] telling me i'm not a christian
[1:58:49] he said well he said what you do is when
[1:58:52] you see he said that your life
[1:58:54] matches with the word you know where
[1:58:56] your heart is at with god
[1:58:58] take the opposite of what he's saying he
[1:59:00] said frankly

[1:59:04] thing to keep from pitching over
[1:59:07] oh my god's word
