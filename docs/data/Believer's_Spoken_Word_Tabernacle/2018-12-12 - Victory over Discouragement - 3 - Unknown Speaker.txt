today or not don't anybody say anything but if greet them from afar but we just thank God for these precious times that we have together and we want to lift a mission offering today and Lord willing here after the first part of the year brother Stephen in Bali was here from Uganda and brother Stephen we've stayed in contact and then I've had the reaching out based on the needs that has been presented there in the in the country of Uganda and I just let you know about that to pray about that Lord willing we'll we'll look into doing and channeling their offering into that with a mission offering after the first of the year maybe take a couple months on that to do what little part we can do because what's happening there is when the testimony brother Stephen had given you have those who are moving out of God is opening their eyes and when they are leaving that in the denomination then everything where the system wants to take everything and the people already Uganda's are very very hard hard place and you know that there's even been believers that's been there that even here over the past few years worth just eight has went to just help them to have at least a little bit of rice and so we want to just if you could there's many needs there's needs for message books and and everything I've been in contact with other Tim Dodd they had contacted me and looking at that and I just got text this morning I had me and that chance to even open I'm and fully look at him it's videos that brother Steven sent me he said brother he said I just got news just today they baptized hundreds within this meeting here and so I haven't even had a chance that to even look at the video here this morning and these things and you see it really surging there in in uganda and in those places so we just want to keep that in prayer if you would and I just want to say God bless you because with what we've been able to do with the mission offering we've not only been able by God's grace to support the work what's going on in in the printing of the message there and getting that out in Honduras but we're also able by God's grace there's been things we've been able to do with other things as well throughout the Philippines which I've told you of so god bless you for your new heart with in it too with because we have one purpose and that's to see that last one come in amen I believe we're real close amen I believe we're real close let's just pray Lord Jesus we love you this morning father thank you for providing for us Lord that we could be gathered together Lord with brothers and sisters of like Russia's faith and father's we come just to Lord make ourselves available Lord to you I pray that God this morning that you would just a lord move upon our hearts in a very special way father you you're the one Lord who comes and breaks the word to our hearts and our lives who Lord causes our understanding to be made fruitful more so father were we're looking to you this morning that that you would come and you would help us Lord you see every need that's here and father as we are lifting this mission offering you see the needs or God you see father Lord the direction and you see the purpose Lord the motive Lord father we pray that God that you'll just continue Lord your oversight and direction or God of all of these things Lord into the hands Lord in which they come father we believe that you're a multiplier or God that father when we think in the scriptures that you just did not multiply just enough but the Bible says after that lord of the fishes and loaves that they took up baskets afterwards Oh God you displayed to us that you're not just enough you're more than enough Lord and father we pray this morning that you will just bless Lord God the worshiper Lord as they would give from the abundance of their heart Lord may you multiply to them Oh God father according to their needs we pray Lord guide us now we pray through a remaining part of the service for your glory in Jesus name Amen amen amen god bless you musicians thank you let's turn in our Bibles to Matthew 11 and we just want to begin reading in verse one and go down there a little bit let you have your seats in verse 1 and it came to pass when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities and when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ he sent two of his disciples and said unto Him art thou he that should come or do we look for another jesus answered and said unto them go and show John again those things which you do hear and see the blind receive their sight and the lame walk and the lepers are cleansed and the Deaf hear the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me was last year just the Lord the Blessed his word as you're being seated and just continue to read there and as they departed the Bible says in verse 7 Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John what went ye out into the wilderness to see a reed shaken with the wind but what went ye out for to see a man clothed in soft raiment behold they that wear soft clothing are in gangs houses but what went ye out for to see a prophet yea I say unto you and more than a prophet for this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee verily I say unto you among them that are born of women there has not risen a greater than John the Baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force for all the prophets and the law prophesied until John and if you will receive it this is Elias Elijah which was for to come and he that hath ears to hear let him hear I want to draw your attention back to that scripture that verse and verse 6 and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me brother Branham places it like this he says I believe there's more people offended in Jesus than any other person that ever lived on earth they get offended too quick brother Bram calls this a misplaced beatitude he also calls it the Forgotten beatitude then in another place you say it's the hidden beatitude and to think of this when we Lotus and look at it brother mem says don't be offended in me referring to this scripture no matter what takes place everything's working right on schedule just go ahead and believe it that's all everything's all right just go ahead and believe it this word this word offended I look at this word here within the scripture it's a word that when we look at it you know in the Greek and then we put it down really to English what the word means is the word scandalize and it is that which would refer to a stumbling block or an impediment that's in the way we'd whereby someone might trip or they might fall it's something that can also cause a person to begin to distrust or desert one whom he ought to trust and obey the calls to cause one to follow away to be offended at one to seeing another what I disapprove of and what would hinder me from acknowledging his authority someone who would stumble getting their foot entangled they feel annoyed we're looking at the thought here on discouragement and I want to continue that this morning on victory over discouragement there's not one person here that has not battled discouragement and there won't be a time until we are delivered from these corrupt bodies that we won't face discouragement we're gonna face times and we have faced times of letdowns times where we've been confused and not understanding certain things there's a lot of things even within life itself there's a lot of unexpected things that come our way the best plans that we can ever make yet how many times that all of the plans that we make there's things that come along that we were not whether it's projects you've done around the house whatever it is even when it comes down to your walk with the Lord there's many things that you know you don't serve the Lord because that everything is going to be easy that's not even the thought of it the whole fault and where everything comes is that you come to a place that you just are falling in love with him who is wooing your heart and you just find yourself surrendering to him and and the whole part of falling in love with him and to where that he himself fully comes to a place of bringing us accepting us in him we rest within that not knowing the tests and trials that will come our there's some times in our life where there's things that when you think in your life in your family there's times that no doubt just in your own personal life that you've been prayed for and God has moved in a very miraculous runway within just a moment and then there's been other times maybe for somebody else in your family or in this same assembly that has had the same request or need and they themselves the way that God would lead it it wasn't in a moment that way but the way things would unfold it would seem like things are just kind of lingering and you know Lord did you hear my prayer did you hear what was Lord that we're looking to you for healing sometimes it's the way that God goes about doing things that within the midst of that time it is something that we don't expect but one thing that I believe that as believers if we can always come back to this place and rest within this is to know that he is God and to know that when we have approached his word God will not step over his word but God is faithful to fulfill his word the Avenue the way that God will go about it sometimes those things are not according to what we would want or what we would even look at that would be the best way but God always knows what's the best way as a matter of fact when every time now through tests and trials that God's Amazing Grace has brought you and I through it when you can really look at it as a believer right now you see the test and the trial that God has brought you through and you see it with value at the time we experience the pressure we experience the strain we experience the burden not on our soul but we experience that within our body in our flesh in our spirit in our mind but yet there is a steadfastness in the heart of the believer to know that in the midst of every circumstance that God is still present that God is working and God will bring me through and that's the comfort of the word even how Paul would you know take moments within the scriptures of where that Paul would write to the Corinthians Paul would write to the Saloni ins and on and on and Paul would take such an expensive part to be able to find this an important part to mention to the believers and to comfort them as Paul could say we comfort you with the same comfort that we have been comforted with those things that we have gone through you know God never let you know Paul know every little step of the way he did let him know I'm gonna show you what great things you'll suffer for my namesake but you know that was not something that caused a timidness or at repeting us or a fear within Paul because Paul had his eyes on him who had called him and him who had made himself known to him and Paul was resting there in him so when trials came their way there's sometimes the escape that came that way was by a basket Bend there's other times where the escape itself God and lead him out a different passageway then there's other times where you know they would come into a place they were able to walk out then there's other times when they were stoned and left for dead none of those things were explained and none of those things were laid out all of those things were unexpected but there was one focus that Paul had and that was to serve the Lord and Paul's focus was because he had been captured by the Living God he was known as a prisoner of Jesus Christ it was that light that he was ordained to reflect that same light to be a light unto the Gentiles to take this same gospel and and bring it to the Gentiles and I look at it like this that offenses and things they'll come you know offenses come in there's no way escaping it you know you've been offended I've been offended there there's all types of things you know where we've been offended the Lord Jesus when we look at this scripture it even speaks of those who you know would receive the word the seed and it would be on stony ground but it never takes root and by and by when persecution arises on behalf of the word they are offended and and you recognize that there's something that is so much greater than your eye that must be on the inside of us then there's got to be an anchor on the inside of us that's beyond anything that you and I can explain it's beyond what our understanding or our making sense of these things and so where we rest within that we come to a place that the scripture tells us we walk by faith and not by sight and to realize that faith itself as the Prophet which so evidently declared to us and we see it through the scripture faith itself is a revelation a direct revelation of the will of God it's not something that you or your pastor has said this or Rafat said this or this it's got to be a direct revelation personally that the same God who speaks and made himself known to the Prophet and through the Prophet must also give you an eye that same faith on the inside because this is what Jude said we're contending earnestly for that same faith for this common salvation and to see that it's a revelation of God's will it's sovereignly given by God the Bible says in Hebrews 11 faith is the substance it's something that you possess because it possesses you as a matter of fact it is the very thing that makes you do what you do it's the thing that drives you we're not we're talking about faith for being a substance that why that you would even forsake the world why that you would cling to him why did you would in everything desire to to be closer to him to live for him to reflect him it's a substance it's a reality that takes a hold upon your life that is more real than everything else surrounds you it becomes more real than the trolls that you're wearing it becomes more real than the ground that you're standing on faith itself is that which the believer is possessed by and is a possessor of that same faith the Bible goes on to say that it's the evidence of things not seen and by it be elders obtained a good report through faith this is an important statement through faith we understand how do you understand through faith and we're not talking about the scriptures are not talking about a blackboard here but it's all drawn out that's not what says our understanding is through faith we be close this guy said this here but no our understanding is by faith through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear but the Bible says it just so clearly like this and lean not to thine own understanding nowhere in the Bible are we asked to understand we're not asked to understand it were asked to believe it believe it by what by faith if you understand it then that makes faith unknown glory you can't understand it but you believe it anyhow if I could understand God I wouldn't have to believe God I do not understand God no man understands God I cannot understand the Word of God but I accepted I believe it I am NOT asked to understand it or Robina God Miliband just puts it like this he says this is what he said in his word that he's the same yesterday today and forever he said in because he has said it he said I believe it I look for it and expected he said God promised grace for me he said I look for it I expected I watch for it and I accept that and that's the same thing that was every promise that God has made and every word of God it is not based upon our understanding of it it's based upon do we believe him who made the promise I guarantee you that Abraham did not have all the schematics all the diagnostics and everything that was laid out on how that he being dead when God allowed him to come to a police to where he can no longer father any children and Sarah was dead he did not have the logistics of how that this is going to happen but the Bible said it very clearly he judged him who made that promise he judged him faithful oh girl hurry brother man tell us he said it wasn't so much that Abraham had faith in the word as there was he had faith in who promised the word oh that makes the difference because when you see him who is the word then you can have faith in what he said that everything he said he will surely bring it to pass you see that's why as a believer we do not we do not stand nor tolerate for one word being taken away or one word being added we stand solemnly upon God's word that God has declared and he has revealed and we can stand upon the Word of God and say this is the inspired Word of God it is the scripture this is my promise this is my book this is where the message that God has sent to us and to lead us back to this Bible faith these are my promises as a believer this is why we walk by faith and not by sight remember as we looked at that some time ago sight is not just these eyes sight deals with every part every sense that could be in there in the spirit realm as well as there within the five gates of our natural body and I say this morning John knew his place in the scripture there was not a doubt that John did not know who he was in first John or John 1:19 I hope you'll bear with me here as I read this if I believe this to be important this is a record of John when the Jews sent three and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who art thou and he confessed and denied not but confess I am NOT the Christ and they asked him what then art our lives he said I'm not art thou that prophet and he answered no then said they unto Him who art thou that we may give an answer to them that sent us what saith thou of that self he said I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the Lord has said the prophet Isaiah now I'm going to tell you John spoke this in humility because you see humility is it comes with more than just agreeing that the word is right but humility comes with allowing that word to be the head and the thority of our life John went out there in the desert he was he was placed out there by God and God made himself known to John oh my a place in the wilderness it was a place away from all that was going on there it was in the city he God made himself known to John and revealed the scripture it was something that it was made known to John not just something he read but it was something that was quickened to his heart that I'm a part of this word and this word is speaking about me more my he didn't find it to be robbery as a matter of fact he found that complementary to the Holy Ghost that had revealed to him who he was and his part was in the word he found it to be the greatest compliment that's the way we are as believers the greatest compliment is simply to believe what he said because he said it they which were of the Pharisees and they asked him and they said to him why baptizeth thou then if thou be not the Christ nor Elijah neither that prophet Jesus and John answered them saying i baptize with water but their's standeth one among you whom you know not he it is who's coming after me is preferred before me whose shoe lat I'm not worthy to unloose I want you to notice how sure he was hallelujah this heinous had already been revealed to him do you realize what brought him out of the wilderness he's be close he had met God face to face and God had ordained him for this moment and he told him exactly where to go God told him where to go to be standing there on the Jordan he told him what to expect and because it was revealed personally to him John went there and he stood in obedience waiting on him to show up John didn't know all the specifics but what he did know is what he told me he told me to come bad eyes and he told me that they're the one that were I am standing that he will also be standing in our midst that Messiah is on the scene right now you see John's ministry was declaring that the greater one is here it was just like Moses and Joshua he's declaring the greater one is here the one that can do for you what I cannot do he is here a greater one are you with me John was sure I want you to catch these points that revelation of his place within the word gave him assurance these things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan where John was baptizing the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and said behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world this is he of whom I said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me now notice this is he of whom I already said his ministry was already pointing to what was going to come it was already pointing ahead to another pool to another transition that was going to be coming you see God will always identify what he's doing by his word and to think how that John was standing here within this moment he wouldn't have known the Lord Jesus except that the pillar fire the angel of the Covenant the one that led the children of Israel there out of Egypt and brought him into the promised land except that he John being the messenger of the Covenant would recognize the angel of the Covenant and by that pillar of fire declaring the word to John then John could say this is the one behold the lamb of God John didn't have to ask nobody is this the Lamb of God he didn't have to consider is he the one he knew it how did he know it he noted by a personal revelation it was not everybody standing there that saw the pillar fire but John saw the pillar fire because it was promised him that he would see the pillar fire let me tell you you and I as believers in this last day you may not have realized and recognized it before but you and I were promised that we would see the visitation and unfolding and revealing of the Son of Man and thus our you and I were promised and written right there in the scriptures there in Malachi 4 we were identified there I named the characteristic of the word being revealed in this hour was written there and the reason that you and I can see it is not because we were worthy it's because that the Lamb of God that great pillar of fire the angel of the Covenant came on the scene and identified his earth that he is the same yesterday today and forever I've remembered my covenant and I am come down God is bound and confirmed in his word Oh hallelujah John goes on and says in verse 31 I knew him not this was not a prearranged thing John you you know you guys her family I didn't know him you mean you didn't know Jesus nah I knew Jesus but I didn't know Jesus I did not know he's the one that was being spoken of I knew him not but what he should but that he should be made manifest to Israel therefore am I come baptizing with water this is why in other words why am i doing what I'm doing he sent me he revealed to me by position and he told me to be standing here job did you have anything to do with it no I just happened to be the one standing here when he came it's not what I knew it's what I've surrendered myself to own Otis he says and John bear record saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him nobody else John saw it do you realize that's the same way with your experience you must see the Spirit of God descending upon the word it must be that which is revealed to you you know the message brother man puts on like this and trying to do God of service many of us have looked at those pictures sometimes that you look at it and there's some sort of a hidden message within it maybe a number or this or that or what have you and yet you get to looking at it somebody says I see this you say where do you see that where I can see it right there you see what it is it's that message inside of that picture they've already seen and once you see it every time you look at that picture all you see is that hidden message that's there you see that's what really matter says that's the same way it is with the message he said once you see the message you can't see nothing else it's been revealed to you every time when you're reading in the scriptures you're looking the message all you see is Jesus Christ I tell you what this message is done it made me fall more in love with my Bible the more and more as I read and pray and listen and it's reading in the scriptures this message is a very scriptural message because if it's not then it's not a message of God but it is the message of the Lord God sent from the throne of God for this hour that we are living in it's identified by his presence God does not need an identification by a school of men he identifies his word by his personal presence I saw the spirit descend from heaven like a dove and it abode on him he didn't leave it's him it's him and I knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same as he wants baptized with the Holy Ghost see God had already identified by his word the scriptural signs that John would see that would be Clare that indeed this is the Messiah do you realize that's the same way in our lives that's the way it is in the life of every believer that's been born again of the Holy Ghost the signs of Christ are present within your life it's a word that's being expressed and lived out of your life it is the very fulfillment of John 14:12 and Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also it's living the same life by the same nature on the inside it will reflect the word and I saw in bear record this is the son of God the Bible says again the next day John stood and two of his disciples and looking upon Jesus as he walked and said behold the lamb of God now John if I can look at just another account for just a moment the Bible here the Gospel of Matthew it begins to also record the event where John comes forth preaching repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand and the at hand is always a key phrase because that hand means that God is not only moving now but it's at hand and hand could mean it could be fifty years a hundred years thousand years 2,000 years but it's at hand what is it it's time where these things are going to be unfolded according to God's perfect will you realize in the Old Testament when they would have the tabernacle of God they would pack up the tab Natha love God as the people of God and they would pack that Tabernacle and then when God the pillar fire would let him know stop right here unpack it and set this up they would actually pack it up and unpack it the same way every time each one had their responsibility to make sure that it was set up properly within how it was folded up it would be unfolded you know the Holy Ghost will never unfold the word improperly but the Holy Ghost will always unfold the word so that it always declares that Jesus Christ is the son of God it will always declared that he indeed is the tabernacle and dwelling place of the Lord God it will always unfold him in his present revealing and working in his body it always unfold in that way now why do you have to fold things up you folded up so it's easier to carry and that's how God has done with his word he has folded up the word and clothed himself in the promises of the word and when it's time he will unfold himself from his from his own word John goes on ministering and he lets it know you know the great religious men of that day came out and John said who warned you to flee from the wrath has it come you see it was a noticing there is a judgment that's impending and John is looking at them and John knows you aren't here because of the right reasons why are you here right and John begins to identify their serpents so when he's saying and he goes on now John dealing with this I want to get to this point he says they acts in verse 10 of Matthew 3 he's laid unto the root of the trees therefore every tree which bringeth forth not forth good fruit is hewn down and tapped in the fire I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I'm not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable all continuing there in the scriptures if you see how that the Lord Jesus here just in this event as recording as there it does in John he goes into the speak of this conversation where the eyes of the Lord Jesus met the eyes of John and where John and humility said I have need to be baptized of you but the Lord Jesus staying true to the word you see he was bound to fulfill every word this was the desire within him is to fulfill every word over it be to God all all of these things were necessary parts it was a script that was wrote now it was being unfolded things that were packed up when Moses would stand there and Moses would wash Aaron he would wash there the priests these things were they would wash the sacrifice it was all attacked but inside of there there was a mystery to be unpacked and you know I got only unpacks when it's time to unpack Alleluia but everything that's packed there's a reserve time for it to be unpacked don't worry you and have been packed up if you've got the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost the seal on your soul we are sealed unto the day of our redemption there's gonna come a day there'll be an unpacking out of this body there's a body that there that's already reserved in the heavens it's called our representation there in heavenly places of theophany there's a body for us to be clothed within because we've been clothed in our soul right now you with me there is that waiting on you and I so there is a time of unpacking when casting time is Oh in this life then comes our deliverance and here in the Millennium there'll be a further unpacking oh my I wouldn't keep on going with this John knowed what he was talking about we will look at this within the Scriptures he knew what he was talking about he knew all the signs were right he had showed them a psych sign and John know that he was the Messiah there that's the Messiah there's no doubt about it so John coming out of the wilderness he blasted these things out another place where the RAM would put it the Spirit of God within him gushing forth these things you see what had been revealed to him he couldn't he could only do what God had revealed to him you see it show something to you and I when God really has revealed something to you it puts you in action according to the voice that is spoke to you your life then becomes an action of that voice it actually begins to express what he's revealed to you when God revealed to Abraham regarding that child Abraham's actions spoke of what had been revealed and what has been revealed it is faith is a revelation of the will of God you know Abraham did not see how was all going to come to pass but Abraham knew God has promised it I'm gonna confess it and I'm gonna go up and continue the ten dollar payment on the hospital bill you know what he was doing he was being obedient to the will of God that Abraham see every fold at that time no he only saw what was made known for that day and that hour and his responsibility was to walk in obedience in humility under that word that God had revealed and when God would reveal more been able more would be unpacked and Abraham himself would walk in that will of God that's been revealed remember faith itself the righteousness of God is revealed from faith onto faith if there's there needs to be a continual and there is by divine revelation and actual acting out and a moving of God within our life by faith ghosts anything that you don't do by faith it's unbelievable is that right this is why Peter would say by the Spirit of God make your election and a calling sure Paul would pick up in Thessalonians brethren no your election right it's important to know it's not something to be walking around and say well you know do I got the Holy Ghost or don't I got the Holy Ghost let God confirm that to your life and let me tell you something God will confirm it by his word my brother and sister it's deeper than a feeling it's deeper than an emotion a matter of fact brother band put it like this he said the Holy Ghost the evidence it's not your reaction to the Holy Ghost but the evidence of the Holy Ghost is a life that is lived by the word not out of fear but out of reverence you're known as I've told you before would you ever think that brother Brennan was being accused around the tabernacle of not preaching on the Holy Ghost would you all ever think that I I don't know well you know I've heard this heard it for years that quoting I got to thinking about it some years ago I thought lord have mercy if there's anybody I would never think that you could accuse because every message I hear it deals with the new birth its life it's token hour but in the message Satan's even high says there's some people I understands been saying Wang brother Brandon preaching on the Holy Ghost around here huh would you see what it was their lack of understanding or what the true Holy Ghost was you see Bill Bratton ease kids time for that to be unfolded brother Brett said then here it is he said they were saying many other things lying by the RAM preaching this and many other things and God said here it is it's the person of Christ inside of you that is quickened to every word for this hour and he follows it and says don't want so much in demonstration but you watch it in action the devil can reproduce demonstrations but it don't make me fearful of demonstrations Wow because that Satan's trap dick tactic to try to get you an act to rise up and despise prophesying this is what see Paul bringing these things out you see there's things around it but you've got to recognize that way that remember well brother Bram said when he's seen what was going on there out there in Mishawaka and then after you know he began to see how this one man was truly not really converted in genui you know brother BAM he didn't want nothing to do it the brother BAM said I thought it was amongst a bunch of angels and then after that I thought I was a munch a bunch of Devils right because of this but you see God has a way of representing things back to the word because why God does not want us to despise anything Visenya you've got to be careful about this be careful about this no not as long as I'm following him I only got to be careful that I don't follow him this listen friends God has not made us in this hour that we would walk by fear and all you got to be careful there's got to be careful that that's not faith that's not faith that's worried that's unbelief but real reverential fear to the Lord is trusting him if I didn't have that I'd be a nutcase I'd be a nutcase from my own life and I sure would be a nutcase as a pastor well you understood it look here in Luke 7 look pick up here in Luke 7 verse 11 it came to pass the day after that he went into a city called nain now remember this scripture this account it's right after that the Roman centurion his servant has been healed now watch this that he went into the city called nain and many of his disciples went with him and much people and now when he came now to the gate of the city behold there was a dead man carried out the only son of his mother and she was a widow and most people the city was with and when the Lord saw her he had compassion on her and said unto her weak not and he came and touched the bier that they bear him and stood still and he said young man I say unto thee arise and he that was dead sat up and began to speak and he delivered him to his mother oh lord I could preach your family service right now but we'll go home verse 16 and I want you to watch this verse and there came a fear on all and they glorified God saying but a great prophet is risen up among us that God hath visited his people I want you to look at this word visited his people it means to look upon it means to expect to examine with the eyes to go see one the poor and afflicted the sick to look upon him in order to help or to benefit to look after half care for provide for home ah the Lord Jesus when he looked upon that woman who she was standing there they had caught her in the act of adultery you know what he was looking he was visiting and looking deeper than what the sin that was there he was looking to the depths of her heart he knew the motive behind those guys he knew what they were trying to do he was there visiting aren't you glad that it was not a formality aren't you glad that you can clearly see that the Lord Jesus Christ is the very heart of Almighty God where God visited his people to look in upon what the real media's aren't you glad that he looks upon your need amen brother man send the message he cares do you care brother Bram said within that message he said we know we know the answer but what's the calls to the problem you know God cares about what the cause is God can go right down into the depths of your life and with sin and then he'll move down even into that subconscious realm where there are things that maybe are trapped there and scars from here and from there and there can they be things maybe why you react in a certain way but the Holy Ghost he listenin hiss there's no cavity there's no door there's no chamber that's off-limits because remember he brings liberty to the captives he'll bring Liberty to absolve of something in the past he brings a full Liberty he does not leave you and I him bondage this is indeed the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ visiting his people I believe this and I'm a witness to it he didn't come just to recite things he came to visit his people he came to look in Paul adequately even lays that out for us how that he would take up on a body like unto us verse 17 now watch this is known now this is known verse 17 and this rumor of him went forth throughout all Judea and throughout all the region round about and the disciples of John showed him of all these things so what are they showing John John the Lord he said this is what the testimony among the people are the Lord has raised up a great prophet the Lord is visiting his people and when they made this known to John John calling unto two of his disciples he sent them to Jesus saying art thou he that should come or look we for another brother BAM picks this up in Micah the Prophet ran after he's preached series on those Forgotten beatitude so forth brother Graham says now John had become he said now Jesus he didn't express it exactly that way but he become kindly because you see things did not go the way he thought it ought to he had introduced to Jesus or a Christ the Messiah with a fan in his hand and purging the floor and burn up the shaft and when he come he was real meek and lonely and gentle so we couldn't hardly understand what that was it looked like he had a letdown and he was kind of a little bit of an offense this is the messenger of the Covenant this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah it's he who was spoken of by Malachi this is him remember what we read earlier he was sure how was he sure because it had been identified to him but now he's in a state of how the Prophet would scribe it a letdown now I'm not gonna ask you but every one of us have had letdowns at one time or another of things that did not happen or go according to the way that we thought they would go now that's not God's fault because it didn't happen that way because something didn't unfold a certain way it's not God's fault but we sure do need help when those things come and discouragement sets in we need help we need help to be able to be lifted out of the letdown now let's look at the setting here just a moment here is a prophet of God one who was spoken of warned in whom as the Lord Jesus remember his testimony of John even after this has come the testimony even that this here is not a greater man born of a woman you realize all of the prophets and the laws they had spoke of this hour they had looked for this hour of the coming Messiah and so here John what he is what he is to do is to go forth and baptize as we read and he was to wait there until the one whom he was sent to to recognize and baptize him for sparing him for the sacrifice and preparing him for the priestly ministry as the high priest sometime of the Lord Jesus so this is his ministry this is what he is supposed to do and he goes forth remember watch this the clarity is you go here and here you wait there and you're baptized and God never told him what day he was gonna show up he never told him what day he was going to show up but John knew the moment in the hour when to step out of the Lorna's he had a witness of the Spirit of God now's the time to move and John was standing there and waiting him that time and then after the time had come to where here it had run to a place behold the lamb of God and to see how that the transition had come now we find the setting of a prophet who's in prison his Eagle Eye you've heard brother Evan say this many times he's Eagle I got filmed over brother brambles say in another place his prophetic gift wasn't working what is that talking about seeing he wasn't able I'm at Elmo naturally he didn't know what I was going on do you realize job did not know what all was going on program tells us I've heard but now I see he said what was bothering job as a prophet of God he knew God was doing something he said but he didn't know what God was doing he said but Joe stood flat-footed he didn't know what was going on but now John hears John's ministry it's just like that of Elijah remember when Elijah came off of Mount Carmel he runs ahead of the chariot even and Beach hey have there - just real and then as we looked at last week he comes to the place of the break down his nerves are an edge he's come to a place I've done all of this according to thy word he has fulfilled everything that God has asked him to do up to that point so he's standing there what's next that's next you see God here stands John he's done all that God has asked him to do program would place this in questions and answers on the seals and he would deal with this in time in in regards to the mind of Christ he says here he says like John he said I can relate and so jus he said to where after God has told you revealed something to you and you go forth and do it but then when the mind of Christ pulls back he said here you are standing in that time saying okay what do I do now that's where Elijah was at this is where John was that he had faithfully listened to me now he had faithfully finished his commission and in a time when all had been delivered now is the time that brother BAM says the devil took a look and said God ain't using him now and so I'm gonna go in there and I'm a Paul every blanket over him I'm gonna go in there and I'm gonna try to get him to disbelieve now I'm going to ask you but every one of us have had our down times if you're honest you have you've had times when you're waiting on an answer from God and you don't hear nothing you prayed and prayed and prayed and you don't hear another come on somebody Daniel prayed for 21 days Daniel wasn't getting little tweets and little texts and little notifications Daniel hi I'm up here stuck stuck in traffic you know just just you know hold on for a little bit he didn't get that but then you kept praying he knew God he knew he was under the sacrifice Daniel didn't care if he was in Babylon his body was in Babylon but his soul was back at Jerusalem he knew where he was standing with Almighty God he prayed and prayed and prayed and when it came time that was more for you and I than it was for Daniel I heard your prayer the first time glory be to God hallelujah oh my he had this break down and blue brain goes into talking about how did John he says you know he said something now when here he says he was the Messiah but then something went wrong John had introduced the Messiah with the fan in his hand going up to burn the chaff but he found out the works of Jesus he was meek and lowly lowly it worried him he didn't know what to say he said there's something he thought listen he thought there's something wrong here somewhere where the round continues to bring this on down to the characterization that's being expressed of how that John was looking at what he preached and he's looking at the actions you see he preached he's a mighty judge that's coming Maddi god that's gonna burn it all brother BAM said there's a lot of Pentecostal brother I'd love to get a hold of that everything was judgment burn it up burn it up burn it up remember I said instead of that a great mighty man like that here comes this meek and lowly oh but he said brought is someone no doubt somewhere something's wrong he thought it wasn't right he become dismayed like many of us do when we see things going on that isn't what we think is just right oh I'm noticing a pattern he thought we think I continue to see these words throughout the Forgotten beatitude we think he thought well what in the world was John looking at but same he couldn't have been looking at the message no he was looking at the message but you see what it was nothing was wrong with the message nothing was wrong with the prophecies it was John's thinking who when we see things going on that we think isn't just right we become dismayed don't be worried it'll be all right the devil got a hold of him in there and brother Brandon goes on now he says you know he said sometimes he said we think things ain't working right but he said everything's all right I just refer to these places and highlighted John got a little worried you've been worried and I've been worried me to tell you something God will not fail he will not fail what he said he performs it may not be according to how we think but he never asked us what we thought he never asked us do you think I'm doing all right what's the latest Gallup poll on my job on your life how do you think I'm watching over the message you give me the latest Rutgers poll Reuters poll whatever poll it is that smells like a polecat to me it's not up to us to give approval ratings it's up to us to do what God said do and stand there in faith here's a little I'm just reading these words he's a little meek gentle fella shoulders stooped down no beauty we should desire him a man of sorrows acquainted with grief the remm says he got to thinking about all this a fellow acting like this something's wrong something's wrong no he's talking I saw him I know it's him but he don't act like that remember says it was a little different a little humble man you see he said what was different from what John John was preaching to John it was different but to Jesus it was right on track it was right on listen this is the brother mem cells like this he says his preaching was different he was pushed around from place to place a judge a judge pushed around from place to place and running here and there so that seemed kind of strange he couldn't understand it now remember if you can understand it if you can understand it faith is a nod if you can't explain it faith is a nod did you see there was a hidden part I hope you'll just give me a few moments here you see as we talked about the unpacking of God's Word I I could just spend months on this but I'm not gonna keep you here months when you look at God's Word and John declared what we read from Matthew that his fan is in his hand he will thoroughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire you see John was preaching there that there is a judgment that is coming you see there was a hidden part that was in there just like when you read in Daniel about the 70 weeks in there is a hidden part of the other where the mercy of God is poured out to the Gentiles but it's a hidden part that has to be unfolded because otherwise it just reads it looks like it'll continue on but there's an unfolding of a hidden part that is there you see there hos a redeeming work to be done listen to me John couldn't see the hidden mystery of God veiled in the truth of the message he was ordained to proclaim it was hidden he didn't see this he didn't see oh there's gonna be two thousand years oh there's gonna be a Gentile bride John didn't see that John said he is going to burn it up this is what's gonna take place so imagine imagine this here you've got what as you're proclaiming according to the word these are not John's words these are not John's thoughts this is God's thoughts so you don't have to take them back and say I shouldn't have said that but what it is is the thinking concerning it you see Jesus didn't look like a judge but he was a judge you see John was looking at through the view of when he would come judge and set up the kingdom within Israel in the Davidic Kingdom you with me John is looking this is all he can see you say well he's a prophet why can't he see this God only reveals and unfolds what's needful for you and I to understand right now God don't let come on I'm quoting he don't let his prophets know everything God unfolds it no wonder the Prophet could stand there through the message and he would tell us in the church ages when he's preaching many times Sardis an age oh he said I could stand here and preach months on one of these points brother Ram goes on a minute in places then in the opening part of the birth pains he said God will send the ministry forth after this that will actually be able to take the things that have been spoken and make more sense of these things it's not man's mind but it's the Holy Ghost the same one who gave it is able to unpack it sometimes God gives packages and you got opener and then there's other times it's not time to open them when it's time to open them you don't need a pry bar to open them he opens and he reveals them he unfolds it and when it's unfolded he don't take one part of the word away it don't take one thing or answer or we we mean we don't need this and no you don't do that it keeps Jesus Christ to be the same yesterday today and forever every time he unpacks himself from within his word all glory be to God so here was the truth the announcing the arrival of the Messiah by the vindication of the pillar fire not to think about this there there would have to be an outpour and offering up in order for the holy ghost which John preached to be poured out by the Lord Jesus there would have to be a rejection by the Jews John did not see this but there would have to be a rejection by the Jews you see there were there would be a trimming there of that olive branch and there would be a grafting in of the wild olive branch as a matter of fact listen to me now there was none of them that seen it even when Peter and them was called to the house of Cornelius Peter would have never went to that house if God had spoke to him in a dream and said listen boy I want you to stop calling them clean that which I have made clean and when they got there there was some other Brethren that came and they watched the Holy Ghost fall on him and you know what they said it fell on them the same as it did us at the beginning so they said how could we refuse the plan of God but you see it was Paul my Peter Paul who would catch and unfold the mystery of the Gentiles that as Paul said in Ephesians was hidden there that hidden mystery it would be the Spirit of God that would unpack the hidden mystery of a calling out of a Gentile bride now I ask you whose thoughts would you rather walk by your thoughts my thoughts or God's thoughts then if we're gonna walk by God's thoughts we've got to wait for God to fulfill him because if we don't wait for God to fulfill them nobody judgment judgment judgment judgment now remember the mercy of God is not looking over sin the mercy of God is dealing with it he is a judge are you with me he was a judge but he was not this was not time to set up on the throne it was not the time to call the world into judgment this was the time to where he was coming to take away the sin of the world even John identified this he was coming as the judge for what to judge the Prince of this world he was coming to do away with and help you and I by His grace the blood that was shed and the imparting of that life to be able to come to a place of our sons and daughters of God that would be anointed by that same spirit and he would reveal who we really were all of this and so much more packed right after that comma right here right now all of this is packed in right after that when he called it a colon semicolon Rob Terry says garner all of this is packed right in there how do you get all of that in that small space well how do you get all that out of his side come on somebody but his size was open he was not a great big man it was not something ring big but you notice he had just opened up his side and out of his side he took the very elements that was needed to make up his bride Jesus himself was a mystery and inside of him was another hidden mystery and it was to be unpacked and unfolded and what would it be it would be the tabernacle of the Living God being unfolded down through the ages upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it he started on a true foundation and build it up to the capping time in this hour where he sends the seventh star the messenger of the Covenant to introduce the coming of the Lord they introduce this is the time of judgment striking the earth all of that is packed right there right there it's packed but it takes the Holy Ghost to unpack it yeah the okay shippo's go there yeah they go there oh yeah the veil goes right there and see everybody knows their part every scripture all put together will declare Jesus Christ and he will set in the middle of it because before judgment there's mercy I imagine brother BAM didn't look like a prophet with squirrel blood on him I got a thing about down the way to church tomorrow dear Lord man he was standing there a prophet of God messenger of the Covenant here to introduce the angel of the Covenant in this hour he would stand right there squirrel blood whiskers grow it all out maybe stand there with a flannel on and whatever more and here he was standing there talking to a man he identified it rot in nature led that man right to the Lord been man was against God but in reality there was something on the inside down there it was only that darkness that was over his heart but when the light struck that the darkness couldn't stay there no more why the angel was passing through the neighborhood I'm telling you that same angel of a covenant is here with us this morning that same God he's here with us he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you the seventh angel came and gone but remember he was here to identify there's one mightier than I who was here and the mighty angel did not leave the scene it was a mystery to the Jews this was unpacked Paul would unpack what was in Hosea I will provoke them to the envy by a nation of a people who was not a people but have now become a people let's just break and come back even in the scriptures of Malachi 4 5 & 6 when God identifies that the first coming of Elijah the spirit upon John the Baptist would turn the hearts of the father's to the message of the children between there and he shall turn the hearts of the children to the father between that little space 7 Gentile Church ages hidden in the word once the word is opened then it reveals you bet you've seen let's think of this now sometimes it's the hidden part that troubles us sometimes it's the hidden part in a marriage and I'm talking about things that you didn't expect things that you didn't hear things are hidden parts that were with your children things are hidden parts on your job sometimes it's hidden parts the troubles because you see when God's revealed something you can stand right there and you can stand on it but sometimes it's things that's hidden unexpected things that come up that you can't see or see sometimes even where brother Branham would talk about instructing people how to hang on after being prayed for for their healing he would instruct him how to hang on to it because there was going to be hidden parts to it are you with me they could be prayed for and maybe they were rushed by ambulance into an interim urn tomb that had nothing to do that that prayer that God was not sufficient and answering that prayer and nothing to do with it that is only a hidden part and a hidden part tests faith but if our thinking was I was prayed for I shouldn't have to do nothing there's a right way to expect and what sure to expect is him he might come in in many different forms but you'll always know him when he comes he might come in a different way but just be expecting him when those hidden parts comes and on the word and say the Lord I'm standing on your word this is what you said because remember as the bride of Jesus Christ with the mind of Christ that's been revealed to you you've got a secret in your heart and that secret is I am making one more move until he tells me if he don't tell me I'm keeping still but while I'm keeping still I'm going to confess he sealed me because after all he is a high priest of our confession of our confession that is the word that is him a hundred incredible how that in the midst of prison in this situation John is watching the actions meek lowly the Lord is visiting his people and John Cena says it's this said this go ask if he's the one he's watching the actions the actions are right on with the word but John's thoughts John's thoughts it's not according to John's thoughts you see the Lord Jesus had already spoke through the prophet Isaiah even when Lord Jesus was here in the in the Book of Luke I'm coming down the Bible had already declared the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me I was there 61:1 because the LORD hath anointed me you find the same thing when the Lord Jesus picks this up and it moves it from prophecy to fulfillment he takes a word that was there and unpacks that in that generation the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the LORD hath anointed me to do what to preach good tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord now remember in the Book of Luke the Lord Jesus he stops right there see he's the one he stops right there because there's a day of mercy before judgment is poured out both say miles that are full of love this morning one day that same eyes will be full of fire I'll tell you friends there's I happen to gain and there's a hell to lose hell is a real place hell ain't no joke there's gonna be many people in hell that are disappointed come on somebody they've been patted on the back and told this and told that and everything but they're gonna be disappointed I'm not on my boot licker I'm not talking about the drunkard I'm tell my church people I'm telling you there's a happen to gain and I'm telling you this morning that the reason that you serve God you don't serve Him under the frown of a Serpent's brow you do not serve Him because if I don't I'm gonna go to hell if I don't do this he'll be displeased with me if I don't do this no sir you ain't serving god you're still under mentality of a slave but remember the love of God it came down to proclaim Liberty to captives a captive is one who could not help himself he was sold into bondage he was sold but there came an announcement that a redeemer has come there is Liberty that is proclaimed a blood that had been offered atonement have been given now let the trumpet of the Jubilee sound identifying himself in the word once again would we rather stay according to the word or go according to our thoughts Oh mah brother BAM said in God and simplicity he said on that Easter morning hallelujah that's where he purged the floor he swept out the trash all right brother yes indeed and the wheat was sealed to the garner laying there in the ground with eternal life resting in it waiting for that great day that we're going to speak of the coming of the Lord when that life will come to life and will rise in that resurrection be caught away with him in the air and be gathered into the garner and the trash will be burnt yonder the husk that's wrapped around and tried to pull it this way or that way will be burnt with unquenchable fire but God has a plan did I say I was closing it's kind of like saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand I asked you a question what if John would have known all this what if Paul would have known Paul just take it easy we gotta wait till the seventh angel has come and then that message has to become flesh in those people just I mean you can you can you can express it but don't be so urgent like it's now see they preached it's at hand Cosi was at hand for those in though in that age you're given an opportunity when it's at hand at your door are you with me but you see Paul himself said though we are alive and remain Paul preached it by the vindication of the Resurrection in his soul Paul was a part of this resurrection come on somebody he preached it by vindication he preached and said we're going to be alive and remain God did not allow them he kept that hidden for this hour and for this time he didn't see all of that you know why there wouldn't have been the urgency that there ought to be and that's the same way let me say it to you there's not one promise one more moment there is not one even minute that's promised to you and I do you realize how close we are to the coming of the Lord my friends I'm telling you it is very close things that were seeing signs that were saying and I'm not just talking about out there the Prophet over and over through the message speaks to you and I of where where the word is being preached conviction being lifted from the hearts of the people and they asked the question not just in souls in prison but throughout the message is the door of mercy being closed think of how when brother bran preaches that in souls in prison brother Ram says Oh God I hope it's not I trust it's not Lord could it be he did not know after that moment but when he speaks that at that moment it is a word of an announcement that it is set in motion remember that the opening of that seven seal Matthew 24 it is the beginning of Sorrows it is the beginning of the beginning of the end things are set in motion and then there's people that take those things which you know and have known people take things right out of context of the word all mercies over and this and that and of course mercy is over but them and their brood they're all in you know they don't sound like a heart of mercy at all else pouring out are no more than a mercy that's judgment but if you have received the judgment of the Lord by receiving his mercy and been accepted in him than you can believe for others what is transpired for you can also happen for one another this is why brother Branham could say when he's asked the question should it should it be that we should look at it than mercy is over he said for goodness sakes don't you ever think that let alone say it don't ever think it so I don't think it I just keep preaching until he says it's over and when it's over it's over Oh nah but you see John John was looking at this the program said you know John was looking and said I know that Messiah sign is right I just know that's right but this meek and lowly and I don't get it I can't figure it out I can't make ends meet with it you ready for this great point you're not supposed to make ends meet you mean it's not my burden no my burden is this is what God has said I want to see it fulfilled in my life I want my life to be so wrapped in it and it in me and I want to see that in the lives of my brothers and sisters and so that's how I live that's how I pray because this is what he's doing and this is what he will do you're not supposed to make into I can't I can't make sense of this okay I can't well how do I have faith ah faith is not understanding faith is believing you see where John is act in his a walk is where you and I come to will come to and that is after God has revealed his will remember it then becomes a holy faith with holy works United together and being expressed but after John has done all that God has told him to do then he must have patience and now faith that was actively you see it being expressed now that same faith is where he's resting by the jelly he's just gonna rest he just rest this is this is what God has told me to do what do you do next I don't know but I know what he told me to do and I know what he spoke to me so it's resting the same faith oh my you and look and say well that is great as that faith he was out there man I mean clothes in the Carmel you know the camel's hair and and baptizing and this and that then is rain is great who it's greater because that faith it don't weaken it grows greater to hold you in the hours when it's silence to hold you in the hours that you don't know the next step you don't even know the hidden part what's being unpacked and going on you don't know what you're resting when it seems like things are going all wrong holy this can't be right ah this and that and you see where you're at you see where you had just look it shows it shows friends anxiousness is never a product of the Holy Ghost if you're looking at the word and becoming anxious that's not the Holy Ghost well I've done it you don't have to make Nothing fit you have to just believe him walk faithful to what he's revealed simple words feast of the trumpets walk in the light that he has revealed and as you are faithful and walk in it he will unfold more because God wants you to walk on solid ground I'm closing if I could tell you this is the very next statement if I can tell you the whole thing and you note it all and I know it at all it would no more be things anything that I can perfectly explain it's not faith anymore by faith you are saved by faith are you healed you just believe it you can't explain it you just believe it I can't explain how God heals the sick I can't explain that I can't explain how God say my soul I cannot explain that but I know he did it I have faith that he did it and if I can explain it then it's no longer faith but faith rest in his word listen have you ever felt like things were going wrong sometimes huh huh funny you should ask that you ever been discouraged huh oh well headway you mean you didn't get your flowers right no no I'm talking about here I'm talking about here uh-huh I've been discouraged just like you have but I realize I've got a choice to make do I look at that or do I look to him who was working and who is the one to do something about it I got a choice like brother brems said brother over and over brother in all he said if I look to everything I see around me I would be the most discouraged person in the world he said that what I do I look to the end of the road look away to Jesus those who are looking for him will he appear the second time without sin you see looking for him does not mean ignoring it means he's the answer he's the remedy he's all that we have need of he is our sufficiency he is performing his word doc didn't need sarah's help Sarah performed her help before to try to make a perfect it didn't work all he endured oon was creating a wild man come on somebody but God said I don't need Sarah all your effort I just need you to believe so God had to do something that would force that unbelief to the surface so bad to judge it and deal with it don't order it be the dog and you know what he came to liberate her and deliver her right there to where Sarah herself would have the testimony that her husband did that God is faithful and jetsam faithful and the Bible says there in Genesis 21 I believe it is that the Lord visited Sara as he had promised gloried be to God but if we looked at the situation's the Lord just promised it he bruh ham what are you doing going down there to Greer you're messing everything up that would have been you and I you and I would have been no no something hey you watching don't let him get out this land it's getting barren here's a testing time ooh I can't believe this him I believer look at him look I'm saying gods just spoke to him God showed up at the 10 her brother Brent says I wondered why God would put those things in there I know to be unpacked in this generation for what for you me we would need that comfort of the scripture as the prophet put it in his words without that we wouldn't know the grace of God for our lives oh my out of that scripture he unpacked God's grace for this generation I'm closing and the answer is brother Doug you're gonna like that one aren't you here's the answer go show John what you see he didn't give him a book here oh no hold on let me tag these quotes and you take all these quotes and you give him the John John didn't need more quotes are you with me he didn't need more quotes he already knew what he needed was is the same kind of an experience that he had in the desert he needed a fresh experience not words not a letter he needed a fresh experience to where when these brethren would come back and show John they would show the presence of God accompanying their life remember remember said they were taught of what the Messiah should be so they were there watching in that as the Lord Jesus said sit here and watch what's going on and they went back and they told John the things that were taking place let me tell you something that was all that was needed the Lord knows how to comfort and visit his people you know what that did that just calls it removed that film upon his I has brother BAM told us over and over he said what was taken place he said is that God he said John what John thought wasn't right he thought surely there was something wrong he said many times we think that too and I'll just listen to this point there's many times that we think too that it isn't working right but it's working right as long as we know that he's here what difference does it make it's working right you see where the focus comes back not in making ends meet as long as he's here let me tell you something the third pole was in operation even when the Prophet was still looking for the tent come on somebody just because he was looking for it we're gonna set that tent up and we're gonna just because that he was looking for it did not mean it wasn't in effect remember it is the opening of the word that mighty angel Christ descending down taking the seals off of himself revealing himself and now bringing his bride his people into a relationship by an invisible union what the Prophet could not fully see why because it cannot be explained when they came out of that little room remember brother REM says that light that was over me left me and went over that noodle and said I'll meet you in there there's only room for you and Jesus only room for me and Jesus and they walk through that little room bound with crutches on costs and all those other things they came out the other side and there was a recorder standing there what has happened I don't know I was bound now I'm free they walked out of that little room with authority over what they have been bound yet you understand that's the authority of this word that same word that is brought to you and I a true token experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is the very reason in this hour it's time to leave this world it's time for the exodus of the leaving of this land of these bodies and going in to that land in my father's house are many mansions as long as he's here what difference does it make there been a lot of things that happen I'm just so I'll just talk for me I didn't see it coming but it came there have been many services that I preached young people services and other places right here right here I didn't see I didn't see it coming there's some needs that were in people's lives that I could know about but yet I didn't cut them they wasn't explicitly or clearly sated right here and he would look at it in that service and if you had asked me in that service but assignment would you have put this service to think that this person would actually be delivered or liberated in that nothing's impossible with God but if you're asking me I'd have said that text don't seem like it but the testimonies you know what all that does and I trust that you've got that same testimony you know of all that does it just calls us me to trust him more I don't know what he's gonna do in a service I don't know how is the service is gonna end unless he's told me at times call a prayer line or do this I don't know that sometimes he lets me know ahead of time sometimes he doesn't let me know I don't know the effect sometimes I cannot see the effect of the word right then but sometimes it's a day later sometimes it's a week later and sometimes it'll be when we stand there gather together say praise God we made it by His grace we made it by His grace His grace packed us through brother God gave us strength it's been worth at all every step of a mile no wonder brother Branham comes right back around and says tell John don't be scared don't worry John everything is working just right everything he said you make sure you tell him I'm right on schedule John was on schedule Jesus was on schedule John Benton fully all all the parts to Jesus schedule but Jesus did and Jesus knew John fulfilled his schedule and so all John had to do is John you ran your course you know the reed shaken with him win you see the devil couldn't shake him off his foundation trouble him in his fossil this is going wrong and this is going wrong this is going wrong this isn't right but this sir he could do all that but you cannot remove that foundation all those battles could go on there but you can't move that foundation it's solid it's resting there because brother Ram would dramatize that he kept coming back and said I know I've seen that sign I love that I love that building Sam do you believe that I believe it on my heart I believe that was on my heart you know why I'm a witness of that you can let the devil with the devil can come try to say this and try to say that but around comes back to testimony and witness that you know by personal experience but I saw him I know he's the one and John would come right back around don't you see what John was doing John was battling the devil would come John was battling he was gaining victory over discouragement and then when the Lord Jesus sitting back victory go tell him go tell him what you see go tell him they walked in there told him victory over discouragement what was the source of his discouragement his thinking and the devil was punching him around on his thinking but once he got his thoughts in line and under the word John John could say you liar get out here our new use alive I stood right here you aren't gonna talk about it I watched I know the angel the cousin it came suddenly to his ball I witnessed it I am a witness are you a witness are you a witness by the living experience of a living God person I don't understand everything that's not what I'm asking you do you have faith in what he has asked you to do whatever he saith unto thee do it if he said roll away the stone roll away the stone if he said repent billet if he said be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ do it if he said submit your life under the blood to be sanctified do it if he sad be filled with the Holy Ghost do it if he said to you be of good cheer for I have overcome the world do it if he said take my yoke upon you for it is do it whatever he sayeth unto thee do it and then after you've done it stand and having done all to stand stand therefore with your loins Girt about with truth having armed the whole armour of God I know what God's revealed to me I know God has revealed himself to me a little part a little part inside of me are you a seed that was there on the inside of us and the quickening power comes what does it do it unpacks and unfolds the glory of God you become a living Tabernacle of the Living God's dwelling place he unpacks the virtues that have been sealed in you he unpacks calling us unpacks patience unpacks temperance he he unpacks what's already there every leaf every apple has already been there in that one seed put it in the light put it in the water and what happens what is in it will be unpacked and made manifest Tabernacle of the Living God unpacked by the Holy Ghost himself through the word not my will that will be done let that mind that was in Christ being us also well the bomb would say at the end voices let my mind let my meditation let everything let it be wrapped into this world let it be wrapped into this word not my thinking Lord not my thoughts but thy word the Spirit of God can convey Invictus but when conviction has come of the Holy Ghost he will always point us in the place of restitution is that right correction itself in the New Testament means healing it's to bring healing to our lives and a real reality has is Lord not my will dying be done not my thoughts everything's working just right brother Samuel this and this and this about the message don't you think no no I'm not worried all I can say is I'm faithful to what he has told me to do and if I'll be faithful to that and you be faithful to what he's told you to do he who has made himself known will bring himself us through it because out of it all he's bringing forth a bride that's Bible bought word solid blood washed and will be raptured he is doing that don't you love him the same you don't you get concerned oh I do don't you get discouraged I do I do don't you see things that don't seem right yeah I do I do I do but like as I said years ago for someone who asked me that I said if I focused on that years ago and said if I focused on all of that or had mercy I'd never have victory in my life but what I have chose to focus on is him because if I will stay focused on him then he will produce in us himself you with me so after all you're not my work I'm not your work we're his worthless signature addition of Jesus Christ himself or Jesus I pray Heavenly Father what is your word you have spoke to us this morning what in these messages Lord you had me to move this channel last week Lord there's a reason there's a purpose Lord Father I pray God for every heart listening sometimes the Lord there's things that do happen we don't understand it sometimes things happen and it just seems like that they don't seem right the Lord I I've always looked in I realized some orders even as you your prophet hit tell us we'll clear back in question answers 1954 he would take lord and reference that scripture in the book of Ecclesiastes about study the weariness yet Paul would admonish Timothy study to show thyself approved shows there's a balance and in Lord Father I believe in my heart you're going to love the truth I love you Lord God but as your prophet admonished us he says don't ever get away from yielding he said sometimes he said we're guilty of so much of study study study that we don't yield board you're the interpreter of your word as your prophet would speak to us and give us counsel and say we should pray for Revelation and Lord as we pray there's things that we have on our heart sometimes there's questions we have Lord we'd love for the answer to come right then and there but Lord God I know that from my own self and there's believers here then they've been serving you longer than I have but they can share this same testimony that there's questions that they maybe would still have on their hearts and there's questions that you've you've answered sometimes questions that we've had on our hearts for maybe 5 10 15 some years those questions lord there was no questioning of you buts things that Lord that we just didn't understand or see clearly but father to know that there's a reason why there's a reason why you do things you'll say things a certain way and it's always in your time that you open your word to our hearts or Jesus it's just like Lord with the messages that's here the things that you bring or does not wait on the inspiration from you to be a minister does not mean that I have a Bible although I do to be able to minister does not mean that I would have message search software program although I do but it's to wait on you for Lord I'm a servant I'm here to serve not what things that Lord that I'm looking at and study things that Lord old mine just glory and delighting him but in the simplest of times Lord that even you would have me to share with the people of how that certain things you would put on hold you would say deal with this lord god I just I thank you so much because Lord every time when I come to the house of God whether I come and I'm here to be refreshed or I'm here to be used as an instrument board I want to be spoken to what God you know every need you knew who is the great judge you know the secrets and intents of the heart you know our false father you know our disappointments you know our discouragements what Jesus I pray Heavenly Father this morning that God throughout this building and Lord no matter where one would be father where they would be at in their walk with you I pray that the Lord that they would take courage in you and that their faith would say Lord I'm trusting you making myself more available to you that you would continue your working in my life what I give my mind to you I commit my thoughts things that I've had all formed out and it didn't turn out this way Ben Lord then they take that as an experience to just keep my eyes focused on you as you had admonished us in your word your prophet taking this example don't be scared don't be worried everything is working right on schedule what I just heard your prophet the other morning real early in the morning lean not to your own understanding as he stood there Lord in the latter part of that message he Lord God he asked for people then no longer wanted to lean to their own understanding he asked him Lord for those whose had ups and downs and ins and outs and they no longer wanted to lean upon their self efforts but they wanted to lean and rest in the promise of the true baptism of the Holy Ghost he asked him to stand at that moment Lord God and he told him he said now as I pray for you you may not receive it right here right now but you stand on that promise and he said you watch God bring it to past in your life as you stand on that promise father throughout this building now this morning there are many needs needs in the physical realm there's needs in the realm of the soul there's needs in the realm of the Spirit Lord I pray Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ that you would grant to them Lord God the release or God of what Calvary has made available to them you are the balm in Gilead you are the honey on the rock and you are the rock we love you Lord we praise you Lord may the film be lifted off of eyes may be Lord God get away from the worry and go back to loving on you may we remember Lord it was grace that taught my heart to fear and grace all my fears relieved [Music] Lord Jesus we pray for one another as a body we pray father God for Lord our brothers and sisters around the world father we pray Lord as we can see needs we see things around but we pray for my heart to know that father you who did it for us will also do it for them Lord God made that same urgency that same heart of intercession be within our lives we love you Father I'll commit this congregation commit every heart Lord and we sure do want to take your thoughts but I don't want my thoughts my thoughts or mine but I want yours there we Lord cast down
