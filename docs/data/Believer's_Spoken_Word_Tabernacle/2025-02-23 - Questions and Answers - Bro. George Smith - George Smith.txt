to learn a new song now this song has been around for over 100 years all right and um if you want a real blessing get your little phone out you paid so much money for and look up the name Evan Roberts yeah take some notes Evan Roberts he was the one that God used to spearhead the Welsh Revival brother brand just happens to mention the Welsh Revival so when you unpack that they had a great time back then they had a Revival that swept the island of Wales people kneeled in the street they closed the bars now our song is only believe but the song they had was what's on the screen we can get our people to push the right buttons back there we're going to learn this song and you're going to stand for a [Music] while you have the sound with [Music] it here is love vast as the ocean loving kindness has the flood when the Prince of Life our Ransom shed for us his Precious Blood who his love will not remember who can cease to sing his praise he can never be forgotten throughout heav he Eternal day on the Mount of crucifixion fountains open deep and wide through the flood gates of God's mercy flow a vast and gracious time Grace and love like mighty Rivers B in and from above and Heaven's peace and perfect Justice kissed a guil worth that beautiful that was the song that brought that Nation to their knees and when you look it up you'll see other people singing it sing it better than I do let's try it one more time [Music] here is love vast as the ocean loving kindness as the blood when the BR of life our Ransom shed for us his Precious Blood through his love will not remember who can cease to sing his praise who can never be forgotten throughout his eternal days on the Mount of crucifixion fountains open deep and wide through the flood [Music] Mercy Lord and gracious Grace and love like Mighty Rivers H in s come above and Heaven's peace and perfect jce feel the guy word in love that Revival was only like 18 months and it was tremendous you can read about it that was in 1903 1904 less than 20 years later 1921 was when the song only believe was written so God has been moving with people all along amen let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for all your mercy to us we thank you Lord that we have the technology you we can reach back into the past and see the blessings and feel the same holy spirit thank you Lord for this opportunity to be here with brother Samuel and the Saints here I pray that you'd help us tonight that everyone could take a blessing from here help us now in Jesus name amen you may be seated that'll be all the music thank you very much we got some tremendous musicians here and we're uh we're thankful to be in fellowship with Saints of like Precious Faith so I don't get it here very often so we're going to take advantage of the time because don't know when to be back you know we might see you the meeting in the air next meeting we don't know but before we get into the questions uh we have some things that we want to share and that is that sometimes uh people don't understand the basis of our belief you have relatives you got friends you got people you work with and how do you how do you share it with them well well we've got two items here that brother Samuel has that are a big blessing they're only 50 cents each and you can share with anybody a resume of the church ages chapter 10 out of the church age book we're going to get that in a minute because there's some of you don't think it's inspired well that's your personal problem but it's God's word so we got the resume of the seven Church ages we got it's all here in 16 p 50 cents if they get if they can't get past that well then they're not worth worryed about don't go no farther you can't make a sheep out of a goat pastors eventually learned that yeah and of course we got baptism okay this is excellent excellent track I didn't write it but I Incorporated it got my picture on the back imagine that brother brandom didn't invent acts 238 it was already in the Bible this track is simply scripture and history nobody can get past that if a trinitarian you know chokes at this he's going to be a trinitarian from now on so we have those as far as you know um witnessing tools there's no sense giving somebody a 400 page book if they gave it to you you'd be scared you'd put it away right give them something simple milk of the word use you know and the other thing is that a lot of people don't realize that God loved the spirit of Elijah so much he used it five times throughout history the only person in the scriptures that he used five times not making this up it's in your Bible so if you go to if you go to First Kings 17 through 19 and you'll see where that God used Elijah okay Elijah the tishbite that means he came from a little place called tishby I went over there one day it's just one little house it's just rocks but it was a village that's where he was from totally unknown but God used him and he he used him in such a way you can read all about it in your Bible I'm not going to give you the whole story you got to go read it yourself but there it is First Kings starting verse in in chapter 17 then when he was leaving he had a guy following him his name happened to be Elisha very similar he was a young man and they came up to the River Jordan and she would now what are we going to do took his Manel smoke the river the waters parted now if you've been near a river the muds about 3 ft deep the dry the ground was dry another miracle walked across and he was caught up in a chariot of fire and he dropped his mantel Elisha grabbed it he came back to the river it was already flowing again where's the god of Elijah smacked the river again opened up second time he used him time goes by we get clear down to the Book of Malachi chapter 3 and it prophesies that there's going to be another use of Elijah that's in your Bible right go to Matthew 11:10 Matthew uh Malachi 4 5 and 6 there's two there yeah some people think it's one oh there's two it's obvious you know and go to Luke 17 176 where it's he cuts it apart okay this is this one here you know Matthew 17 which is very very crucial scripture and we'll just look at that real quick Matthew 17 because some people think I I know man well M Malachi that's the Old Testament okay let's go see what the what the master himself said in Matthew 17 and um we can never go wrong reading the word so in Matthew 17 Jesus and the disciples have been up to the mountain and they're coming down from the mountain on verse 9 of 17 as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged them saying don't tell anybody about this until the son of man is risen again from the dead now this is one of the few times that he's you know given him a hint something bad's going to happen he's going to die he's going to raise again and the disciples said well sir why why say the scribes that Elijah must first come and see they're still looking for Elijah we were the guys with the clubs on our back didn't have a CL we didn't know Elijah was supposed to come cuz we didn't read our Bible shame but they're still looking for Elijah I know those people and the serious ones oh yeah messiah's almost here we we know that but first we'll see Elijah he'll either be right beside him or two steps in front of him but we'll see Elijah first so they've been looking for him for for centuries and Jesus answering their question said El El Elijah truly shall first come and restore all things period okay but I'm saying to you guys Elijah has already come they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they uh listed whatever you know was written of him to do likewise shall the son of man suffer of them then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptist that they were a little bit thickheaded like some of us they weren't catching the Revelation here's the here's the Lamb of God that chose them got them off the fish and everything he's telling them the words of eternal life and so people stick with that with John the Baptist wait a minute like I told you this morning Dr scoffield finished his work January the 1st 1909 without a computer and he says down here at the bottom these passages must be construed together one Christ confirms right here here in this verse 12 the specific and still unfulfilled prophecy of Malachi 456 Elijah shall truly first come and restore all things aha it's been in the Bible for over 100 years what's the matter with all these people I didn't write the Bible it's it's right there now we've got people today you probably know some of them that are convinced that William brandom didn't fulfill that scripture well I'm here to tell you he was my father-in-law I knew him very well and I've been studying this for over about 60 years he was the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 now if you don't think it is then stop throwing rocks at us go out there and find him because Jesus said he's coming he's he's some place I mean let's just be logical put it all on the table you don't need Revelation just go find him well so that's number four and number five he comes to the Jews in Revelations 11 okay Elijah and Moses we don't have to guess now in one of my trips to Israel is anybody in a hurry to go I can't hardly see the clock for all the glare but we'll just assume that we're okay still daylight outside and one of my trips I was there for two trips and so I had about 3 days in between and um so my guy being a retired uh person he was looking after me and we went to visit some other friends of his some other retired people okay so here we are in this house with uh six Jewish retired people very intelligent people and the guy that owned the house had a library I mean he had books everywhere very intelligent people and so one of the ladies says now now Ruben tells us that your your father-in-law was a prophet can you tell us about that well now that you [Laughter] asked I said now surely in all of this you've got a Hebrew New Testament oh yeah right here well so we go right here and I I point out some of these things to them and I said see Elijah is coming five times well they didn't know that they know Elijah is supposed to come to them but they didn't know was five times I said four times to you and one times to us and so she says y when is he coming I don't know but your Elijah is coming and so they they're very keen on Elijah and one of the things they say all the time you know because they study the life of Elijah from from children they they study the life of Elijah and they say now he was a pretty nice guy but don't push him cuz you will cut your head off like he did all those false prophets so we are following the teachings of William brandom because it's scripture he didn't make it up he didn't invent stuff he didn't dig it up no he preached scripture and the whole point of the message of the ministry was to bring us back to the open book so if you don't read your Bible you're the one that's losing out you read your Bible every day and the four steps to stay balanced oh yeah we got to put this up here the four steps to stay balanced you read at least one chapter out of your Bible every day everybody can do you guys going do that yeah you read one page out of your church age book never hurt anybody and you listen to at least 30 minutes of God's prophet and you pray and you follow those four steps every day you'll have a more Balanced Life and the pastor will have an easier job so we've covered Elijah we got the tracks scripture now um God called me to translate the message from English to Spanish okay my parents were um Baptist missionaries and they started out as ones that wanted to bring the Bible into the language of a people that didn't even have a written language I know it's hard to believe we live in 21st C everybody's got a$1 th000 phone but there's 7,000 languages on the planet today uhhuh some are still spoken only nothing written the scriptures are currently in about 750 languages the whole Bible the New Testament I think is about 1500 languages so there's people busy at this all the time they're busy busy busy and back in 1944 my dad went to the mountains of Mexico looking for this tribe of I don't know how many people because they had no written language well he didn't have the 20-year patience that it would take to do that and he left that job for somebody else and eventually got done but um there's something in the blood about getting the blessing that we hear as we hear on tape get that blessing over here for these people that they can understand the same thing get the same blessing and no it's not word for word now you guys that know Spanish you know there's no such thing as word for word translation it doesn't exist in the Bible where it says that Jesus went and prayed for the little girl and there's these words which means well don't even match up you know so it's got to you got to come by by phrase what does this say over here in this language to produce the same effect okay that's right and so that's what I've been doing since I got out of the army 1967 now you would think that by now we can have it all done no it takes time so when I first got started I realized that okay we got today we got 125 messages of William bradam they're all on the cell phone everybody can hear them but I'm not going to live long enough to do all that it's not going to it's not possible some other people got involved and so it's all done now but um the fact is that we just want the other people to hear the same thing we hear it produce the same thing if it's done right you see we want the preacher to preach the word we want the song leader to stick with the original songs you know so the translation has to be done right anyway so I get involved and we translated the church age book and uh um I can see right away see I've got one of the original books the original Church age book came out in 1965 in December I was in the Army I got my know hardbound copy still and but it's all kind of one paragraph sometimes so when we put it in Spanish aha let's put some paragraphs to this put some paragraph numbers and you know highlight the scriptures and all that so we've had that version for years since 19 7071 so some of the uh english- speaking people they saw it well how come we don't have this in in English so I talked to my brother-in-law and said hey look you know people want this want this same outline like this in in English no he said that W have never work no they've already memorized the page numbers and and fine it's your book move on but about 10 years ago a brother in Canada said look my grandchildren are not reading that blue book it's it it doesn't lay open it's one paragraph It's not readable so I went back to the brothers-in-law I said look guys there's a demand for the church age book to be you know put out in in paragraphs and um they said no we're get to S the way Dad left it okay I said look I can I can arrange it for you send it to you you guys print it and nope fine so I prayed about 5 minutes and did it myself and so today we have you know the book with paragraph numbers it's readable this is printed in China on better paper cheaper than you can do anywhere in it's USA so um we got the seal book and we got and then we got the church age book both in a readable fashion now there's people that don't like this and I don't get I'm not going to go into all reasons they don't like it but the point is it was never meant to be word for word according to the tape I'll give you the brief history in the first tape of the church age book in the Revelation December of 60 61 brother R says I'm going to write a book I could have set up at the house and done it but I wanted to come down here to get the you know inspiration with you people so he comes down he preaches the whole series finishes nobody says a word life goes on so a little sister with I don't know what Machinery she typed it all off that takes time and she shows up and she gives brother R this stack of paper you said book where's your book well that's nice now if he wanted a word for word off the tape he could have took that to the printer in two weeks had the book he wanted it readable he knew his limitations he knew his level of Education he wanted where you could read and understand what he's saying right it never was his uh intention to have a database with all the little thethe at at and no he wanted it in a language that you can understand okay he trusted people to edit his messages back then eventually we ended up with What's called the exposition of the church ages I'll challenge all the Sayers open challenge bring me the first person in any language that's been hurt by that book it doesn't exist right people read it they love it because it's understandable oh that's what you mean so that's the history of the church age book okay but if you want to continue in your confusion that's your choice but we can only speak the truth okay so you've got tracks that you can testify with because not everybody's gifted like brother Samuel to you know spit it out real quick so there's tracks that you can here here's what we believe you know and once they latch on to the message well then you got something they can read wow didn't know this existed yeah okay any questions so far good you had your chance now we have some questions here and you know these are things that are on people's minds I assume they're all sitting here I don't know so we'll just go through them as best we can um is there anything else I can say about the church Ag and seal book okay so so he he he asked brother Vil to to write here here's the stack of papers do something with this make make make a book out of this well brother Bale says well we'll have to kind of rewrite this we got to come to serpent seed got to explain what that is have to go through this easily you know okay so during the 5 Years From 61 to 65 brother R's preaching a whole lot of other great things they got incorporated into the exposition to start with and so as he would write as they would put these chapters together they would get him you know typed out and then would send them to brother BR is this what you want said so he he would read some of it he would have others read to him Rebecca read read to him a lot of times and so here they are reading a manuscript and he said no change that right there because that's not going to fit with what's on the next page how do you know that prophet's a little smarter than we are I've got one of those manuscripts at my house and uh and I I saw him doing some of this you know so he read the whole thing this is what this is the way I want it yes it's just the way I want it now you can argue with it but look this is the man that the angel came to on a regular basis he didn't come to me didn't come Samuel came to William Brandon so if something's wrong he would have corrected him okay it's just that simple okay question number one is your daughter planning on writing another book no no she's busy with what she does she didn't actually write that book okay she went and got testimonies I got some of the testimonies Rebecca edited them and we have the generation book that simple what I want to do is and I talked to a brother about a month ago is produce a not a book but it'll be online because printing books is very expensive now but I want to make a um a page called The Inspired writings of sister Rebecca we have all kinds of things that she wrote and we make those in some kind of alphabetical order or something and it' be a big blessing to people you you read some of them in this in the the uh only believe magazine there's other Publications get all those in one place put them online under onlyb believe.com it'd be a big blessing to people she's been gone 18 years okay and so that would be the next thing we put out number two how many witnesses are there left since the the book generation was published besides you maybe three most of them are gone there's there's no preachers left there's one left down in Arkansas but he's almost doesn't count because you know it's kind of so that I it's not credible okay so yeah there's there's very few were there any humorous moments you had with brother brandom well I can't think even right off hand he was a great jokester he loved a great joke I mean he could laugh and laugh and laugh because he had to let off the pressure somehow um we were we were uh waiting in the car he was in his car I was in my car behind him we're waiting at the curb for the ladies to get ready because we're were going to go someplace I don't know where we're going well they're not not coming not coming so I finally got out of my car and went sat with him he said George what are we going to do can't live with them can't live without him so he had he had a great sense of humor yeah was there one thing that seemed unreal but was so real well I don't know what you're thinking about writing that but um yeah there was a lot of things that okay this is the way it is but how do I get here you know it is unreal for example why did he accept me I wasn't even part of the operation but yet he accepted me in you know um what stood out the most to you of brother brandom that is always in the back of your mind um well uh when he called to tell me you know congratulate me on receiving the holy ghost that was pretty amazing he was thousand miles away yet he knew what was happening so there's few things like that um was there anything God revealed to you about brother brandom and was the moment you knew who he was and no I can't say specifically no um it's just something gradually oh this is scriptural this is real you know this isn't just another Baptist preacher so that that came gradually uh brother br's personal advice to me or others seeking the Holy Ghost pray read your Bible and pray that's something my mother told us when we were very small now here he is repeating it that's the clue you got to get in and read the instructions doesn't come by osmosis you don't put it on and go to sleep you won't get it that way you get the Bible out and you read can someone receive the Holy Ghost outside of a message Church maybe when you get to heaven there's going to be a lot of surprises oh how'd you get here what are you doing here I thought she was going to the other place we just wait till we get there yeah that's why that's why he gives us this 30 days that we talked about this morning we have that time to see if Aunt Sally made it is Grandma going all that's going to be taken care of before we go because when we get there all the attention will be on him you know and God has some surgical way of taking some memories out and leaving other memories because otherwise it'd be a very sad place you know so um uh in line of that same thinking you know when Rebecca was in probably fifth or sixth grade she asked brother random um are there people on those other planet he said we would be very narrow-minded to think we're the only ones surprises okay if one feels the Lord may be calling them to the ministry what are things one should do to find if that is truly the Lord's will and how will you know well you can start by reading 1 Timothy chapter 3 4 and 5 get into the word god reveals himself by the word to his people right okay he's not going to reveal to you something outside of the word so go study 1 Timothy 3:4 and 5 and you'll get a sense whether you're part of it or not did Brother random ever go into more detail about the seven angels that came to him and how he was drawn more to the seventh angel and how he was drawn more to the seventh than any the other Angel he called that angel very notable quote you will notice that the one Angel was very notable to me the rest of them just was seemed ordinarily but this Angel was a noted Angel he was to my left in the constellation in the form of a pyramid seventh seal okay um those are the details you didn't you didn't tell us anything more than what's right there but now if you want to get serious go over to Revelation 19 and see what we got over here where John is you know getting all this Revelation seeing all these great things and in Revelations 19 says here in verse 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready you ever thought about that how she how'd she make herself ready she studied to make herself approved she got in serious with the word she listened to the ministry okay and to her was granted that she should be a r in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints and he said unto me okay some some being is saying unto John write less are they which are called un the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are true sayings of God and I fell at his feet so John Falls at the feet to worship him and he said unto me John see thou do it not I am of thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God the testimony of Jesus the spirit of Prophecy I'm not saying that's William brandom but it was an angel it could have been the same angel that he's talking about over here in the seventh seal that look very notable to him because as he's going through the Seven Seals he had no clue what was coming the next day he had to sweat it out and bite the fingernails and and pray and God revealed to him each night what what the next seal was and it was the these Seven Angels were bringing him something each night well the one that brought the seventh part was some some had some relation to him okay you call it theophany whatever it was but there's some kind of relation so I don't know but this over here could be the same one think about it a few years ago you talked about how brother brandham would travel places and he would not have his hands on the steering wheel the car was driving itself while he was praying or studying could you expand on expand upon more Supernatural experiences that out to you that weren't written down in the message that were just everyday type experiences outside the church well that happened more than once happened several times that he there was such a presence in the car that he he just raised his hands and car go over the bridge and turn God's in control yeah the these kind of things were quite common um not common but they did happen in his life you know and he didn't tell everything you knew uh I think I told once about they were in a restaurant and the family was having lunch and this other table was a policeman and as soon as the policeman's food came well then his radio started blasting left the food and took off the light flashing brother just kept eating everybody else was nervous he said it's no big deal were there a few blocks boy fell out of a tree he broke his arm but he's going to be okay that was his life and Rebecca said now we knew everybody's daddy didn't do that did Brother brandom give you and your wife any oneon-one advice regarding marriage they were not written or recorded in the message no only be careful did Brother Ram give you and your wife any one-on-one advice regarding raising children they were not written and recorded the message no he didn't he lived by example he he didn't give a lot of instruction despite the tragic nature of brother R's death what were the natural and spiritual blessings that came from it well good question I was there and U what we had to do was dig in for oursel you couldn't call anybody hey I need help no you had to learn to pray for yourself you know and and so uh we learned to listen oh because see when people went to the the meetings back then um very few were paying attention to what he said they're watching for the Miracles and everybody in the prayer line wanted to know you know for him to tell them where they were yesterday and what their name was and their address there's not time God bless you move on you know and so now we had to get serious now we had to start listening and that's some of the blessings that came from it just that simple did Brother random do daily devotions with his family well sometimes when he was home yeah do you think brother Brandon would be proud of the message churches today or do you think there are things he'd be disappointed in he'd be very disappointed he would put his head into one of some of our churches huh it's not the way I left it move on I don't care how many pictures you have how many books you have if you don't have the spirit of the word you got idolatry right that's right he was anti- idolatry so yeah he'd be very disappointed in a lot of the churches was it difficult to be a Christian in the military no because had the Holy Ghost and I didn't go to all the stuff that they went to right I mean people all around me drinking and carrying on no it wasn't difficult now if I was doing it in my own self well that might be difficult but God was watching after me how did Brother Ram teach his sons to treat his daughters I don't have any idea I would assume with dignity you know there was there was order you know what miracles did you see happen well the fact that he accepted me that was the big smle well see there was other guys that knew who he was and they were scared they they wanted to jump and ask but they were scared scared well I'll give you a clue one of them was our friend down here in Dayton yeah Big Mike he was probably a good-looking guy at one time but um What attracted Rebecca well here's a guy that daddy likes and he's not one of these clowns that you know just want the girl and and so yeah he accepted me that was the biggest Miracle that's the only thing I ever saw happen so those are the questions uh are there any other questions that you're not brave enough to write down what about it Chris okay well yes sir what's your question about the what the rure yeah there'll be a there'll be a period of time we read it this morning he said that there'll be a Sweep come over the people and we'll be with the resurrected Saints month or so and then the Rapture so it's it's just like it was in the book of Acts you know it was about a month or so that they were together before they left so yeah it's part of it and I don't know which 30 days they are but it's getting very close because there's too many signs to say well it's way off no it's not way off and when Paul preached he preached it in a way that people would stay ready but he had to know somewhere in his head that this it's going to be a while but he preached it in a way stay ready see if you if you knew if brother R had told you yeah it'll be in U you know 2035 you wouldn't stay ready you'd run up your credit cards you'd just just flop around yeah we're humans so we got to stay ready right might happen before the Sun up we don't know things are just very hot right now the world's about ready to fall apart and so um we do have the signs of the times and the big thing is don't worry about the future just get yourself ready for the resurrection that's that's the next thing on the calendar then the rest so get ready pay attention to the ministry that God has given you everybody doesn't have a good pastor like you have okay no this is one one of very few so pay attention to what God is telling you every day and do what you know to be ready for the resurrection in the meantime yes brother oh before he left yeah I realized who he was cuz it's once you see it in scripture no problem so we can testify yeah God sent a prophet okay next thing what do he say well then we got to be able to tell them you know of course we have tapes on the cell phones and everything else but uh yes I I realized who he was before he left yeah anything else yes sir no Budd from 40 years ago okay what the brother's saying is that we have where brother Ram says that he's dedicating his son and May you be a prophet okay but he also said that 99% of the people don't AR not brave enough to repeat there's my daughter Rebecca spiritual and someday she'll take my place how come we left that out and what do I think about it well I think he knew what he was talking about and uh she was a lady that um didn't try to take over she knew her place and in her writings and that's why I want to publish this she showed us another view of William Bram she wasn't going to take over and preach I was sitting in a church several years ago and the brother came across that part he said I don't know about you all but I don't believe in no woman preacher that's not what he said okay that she would take his place that she would be a a pillar a blessing we have women in the Bible but see we're so we're so um uh I don't know what the word is uh but we only talk about the man in the Bible I've got a message Jesus and three women he loved the women in the Bible he took them by the hand he helped them women none of you would be here without your mother just face that start with and women are vital in the in the scriptures so she had a place and she helped us see another view of William brandom that the messages don't show you right you know so yeah she was very very important but not taking over in the way you might think okay and now they're together so this brother had a dream the same brother was telling about this morning so he's in heaven and he's talking to brother Brandon about current things down here and so um he uh you know he's telling him what's down here and and he said now brother R now down there where I come from a lot of people say you got to come back and do all these things brother R got real serious and said look I've said everything I had to say but if I was to come back you know the way they got it figured out I would have have to take a few people to the Woodshed all you old people know what that means that means we're going to go out there I'm going to beat the fire out of you and when you quit through crying then you can come back you know and he said and I would have to start with my two sons so just that's what the dream was so he they're talking and then he notices that there's a young girl on brother Ram's arm and he looks at her oh that's young Rebecca so she gives him a big smile and uh and she says tell George I'm right there where he told me to wait for him so it's real yeah the end this okay see he would have never asked you that question okay what else I know you guys don't know it all yes I have no idea it looks unlikely see we just saw a big fire out there right and now the rain's come now it's all going to wash down it's a big mess and it's ungodly and brother BR says it's 3 to 400 miles wide 12200 miles long that's a big chunk right it breaks off and the waves that that causes yes around the planet forget Florida forget England it's going to be disastrous that very occasion could be the time that the bride disappears I don't know Stay Ready could be tonight you have no you have no guarantee of getting to your pillow tonight true so stay ready what else what about a Smith idolatry idolizing either him or his message because people are idolizing the words oh it says right here and then they fight with the other guy that says over here it's not God's plan you know so there's a lot of idolatry yes it's not all in the Catholic church so we're on the same page so that's about all I have I just want to be sure that you understood the questions and the answers and you understood the five comings of Elijah very important um might even put out track to that effect who knows but people have to understand that what we have is not somebody's idea right the people in Salt Lake that's an idea all these others the big church right down here what is that Catholic what is that big one right down there on the left side yeah well see there was only one Catholic Church to start with one but then in 1541 they had a disagreement so you got you got Constantinople the Greek church and you got Rome the western church but it's all Catholic but um we uh we follow the scripture that's the whole beauty of this whole thing it's Bible it's not William bram's ideas he's not a prophet because he promoted it or I said so the scripture says Elijah shall come right so if you don't like go find him it's simple amen you tell them what I was trying to say [Applause] brother Nathaniel no questions I don't I don't believe it I don't believe it I don't believe it no amen how many enjoyed that um also there um the things I asked of uh for brother George we were talking we've talked quite often and um when he's been here with some things that um it seems like every time that he's it's not just when he's been here I'm sure it's when whether he's with me or not but seems like he's always answering questions and emails regarding the church age book and he's around the world and um those are some things that um uh you know when you you get to look at it it's just it's incredible of how that you know when you when you you go through it and you're reading through it to me I think brother George what he was coming around to is that when he had to actually determined there's no way to translate and when he first started 900 and some messages that's all there was at the time and then they found now there's 1,5 but you had to select how many of you have heard of the seed libraries and how do we select to where that you get a picture of them message because you know there's multiple messages and there's certain you know every message like the message why or sometimes it's titled bomb and Gilead depending on the congregation because the needs will always shift as a minister you know that it it'll shift you can preach the same thing as far as a text but God will take it based on the needs of wherever you're preaching it and so when you look at trying to get a full picture you know instead of translating every message titled why or bomal and Gilead which would be about 12 messages there's one that's selected out of that and then you get into really the heart of the message all of it is important but you're trying to get a picture for them overseas so they can get everything interpreted in those other places and that's the same and so when you look that's where one of the things that it's like what I told the young people here over the years and things like that and I've told others is that I said this right here with a church age book to me this is like a a can of of juice concentrate you have to take like that you know that orange juice that you had to put in a in a in a thing of water and you had to put it down in there and you got to Stir It Up it's it's concentrated and this is one of the these are one of the things like the prophet could say I put my Doctrine in here and it's just it's laid in thick and so those are things that you know when we come through it and it's true like when brother George said I I don't think I would hand this to someone brand new in witnessing to them this see it says right here in the front page this is from uh trying to do God his service you've all seen my book it'll be um it'll be drawn out the seven Church Ages which he told me which I stand by as a witness to God to be judged that had judgment for it it comes from God not from my thinking [Applause] yeah yeah I love that and I what I I liked also is that brother George they he brought that out the the resume which is in the back of it that's a real good witnessing tool right there because you can just hand it and it's it's the last part in there but it's a real synopsis gives the overview of really what's taking place down Through the Ages because there's a there's I tell you what we're still here so there's lives and hearts to be one to the Lord and I certainly believe that not only like as the prophet said that that soul that last one their names splashing beneath the bleach but I believe it might be rapid work but God's going to bring everyone to a full adoption that's the full working from the new birth to the adoption so we just we thank God for that and also with the Christian uh the baptism this track this is really it's really good how this is uh laid out here and I don't know how many ever seen this before okay so there's some things that I don't know that if U you know even with the the seal uh the seals book here then Spanish and I know the the church age book in Spanish brother I have some back there when brother George had sent them up here from before and the reason I haven't just laid these out on the Shelf now this right here if there's one book that I could put in everybody's hand it'd be this book right here the exposition of the seven Church ages and but you know the only reason haven't put all these on the Shelf cuz sometimes and I'm not call nobody's name because some people some individuals if we went and looked at their house they probably got more in their house than brother George has in the warehouse because they just keep on taking the same book just take one and read it and then and then you know just so but if I tell you what even with all this right here if um these we can I I'll let them set out here nobody take them sample sample only brother Nathaniel is going to watch over it he can take care of himself I know that so but you know if there's some things that maybe even to you know in putting together in order if some of you want because this is the way this is laid out I've got an actual leather bound copy of this um and the way that it is laid out I know what brother George I've actually got one of those original um blue hardbound books but it looked like it's been baptized in highlighter so you know you can only highlight the highlighted so much and so with this one I I like the leatherbound copy but I can't write in it but this one I can write in so that's just me I mean you know but if if if uh maybe there's some things I don't know we can you know as a church maybe it you know maybe for brother Nathaniel myself if we want to make an order together uh we can have that out there for you uh because it's it's a real blessing even how the seal book is is laid out so um maybe to put those out there brother Nathaniel do you mind if I would you mind putting these out there on the table make sure he don't walk without make sure he I think I can trust him yeah amen amen so appreciate so appreciate brother Nathaniel amen we've he and I really had some good good Fellowship here and uh we just so appreciate amen I just appreciate the fellowship between the churches amen I I so appreciate that God is so good isn't he yes he is amen and you know that's that's the reality that you know when we look at the what the message of the hour what it what it come to do is it come to reveal Jesus Christ and I love how brother George like when he said that that you know this is not the message when we talk about getting in the Bible we're not we're not here to try to somehow prove whether or not what brother Braham said was the truth it's actually then getting in the in the vein of the thought that God spoke it through his prophet and then this is where the Bible becomes a new book and it just you know this message the more the more that I'm in it the more I fallen in love with the Bible and you just and you're just seeing it and you know as you're reading it how many can testify this you're reading it and all of a sudden it comes back to me of a statement brother br's made so I just write it right in the Bible right there you know so I've got it right there and now I do that I just write in my Bible you know I I but I I just so appreciate the message of the hour because that's what it did it brought us back to a real Bible Faith amen a living God Among Us and I mean man what a privilege as as young young people man to be able to dig right

joy to H in all I [Applause] do you Lord and all I do I honor [Music] you amen I come and ask brother Nathaniel if you close us out in prayer and I thought it was so wonderful here tonight just to be able to gather together and I just appreciated the the time of questions and answers here and brother George taken the time to be with us and and to do this tonight and uh you know I just I love that that question where just spoke very simple short little question but said you know any advice about one Desiring the Holy Ghost you know the first thing the prophet said he said for you to even desire it you're blessed he said now that don't mean you have it but it means the holy spirit is up on your life that's raising that desire and then to hear of the response is very true is brother Bron said when you go to hunger and he said God can give it to you right now you see it's God that creates that hunger it's not us it's God it's God actually pulling upon that attribute that he placed within us his presence draws near it's like a magnet getting close to something he begins to feel that pool and I love how that was even placed here tonight because we we see the urgency we see the hour we know that's the necessity the token but let me just say this to you God doesn't want you to be anxious about anything the very thing is is as brother George plac that there tonight is praying and reading the word of God and the only thing that you look for is not a feeling brother BR says you you may not feel anything you may not shout he goes through a whole list of things but there's one thing about it is you'll know your life has been changed so it's him he's the one we're looking for amen do you love him tonight see just you you can't you just you sense his presence and you just sense how he just comes in that way what it does is it the spirit of God just dispels all anxiousness because when he comes into view it it dismisses fear remember Elisha was there and and Gia was all tore up and Elisha said Lord open his eyes and the prophet said God didn't bring down the Angels they were already there and that's what God did in this end time God loosened the seeing that we might see the god that always was is right here among us [Music] hallelujah praise the Lord amen God bless you don't you appreciate how brother georgees has a way of dispensing with formalities you know we in America Amica we're a little too formal sometimes sometimes we need to just cut to the Chase and sometimes if we'll do that with God we'll get a lot farther than all the things that we've been trying to do you know brother brand tells a little story which I appreciate very much there was a woman that came to him and said brother brandham I don't remember all the details but something to the effect of you know brother brandham i' I've done this and I'm backslid and I I want to come back to God he said do you really want to come back and she said he said yeah I really want to come back he said okay you're back you know we want we want there to be lightning and we want there to be a feeling and a sensation but if you take God at his word Saints truly Saints in America we are so caught up in formalities that God we spend sometimes an entire service trying to get through formalities is that true brother Samuel we come in and we come in all formal but Saints we take ourselves too serious seriously let us take god seriously let us lay down our pride and say Lord Jesus I don't want anything but you I'm so tired of this person I'm so tired of fighting with this person so Saints as we have heard the the wonderful encouragements that we've had tonight we're going to close in a word of prayer does anyone believe that the holy spirit is here tonight amen he told us where two or three are gathered I will be there also is that right you say well brother I don't feel anything we didn't look we didn't ask that God didn't ask that he said I will be where two or three are gathered that means he has to be here tonight is that right so if you want something from God if you want the baptism of the Holy Ghost tonight we're going to pray to close amen and all you have to do is raise your hand and say Lord hallah I'm tired of me I want you just accept it it's that simple Saints we are the ones it over complicated just take God at his word he said you do what I told you to do I'll do the rest God will confirm his word so now we're going to pray together you have something in your heart raise your hand make it know we're going to Bow our heads and let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord we've been too formal many times Lord we take ourselves way too seriously Lord we look at our own drama we're so caught up in our own ideas I I I I I but Lord if we by your grace can turn our attention to you you can make the difference Lord maybe we've been struggling maybe we've been looking for some process some formality to have it experienced with you but Lord tonight I pray Lord that it's just that simple in our hearts like that little lady said brother benam I want to come back okay you're back lord as we lift our hands tonight we want it to be that simple Lord I need the baptism of the Holy Ghost Lord I need a refreshing of the baptism of Holy Ghost whatever it is Lord I lift my hand and I Look to You for Lord Jesus you're the author you're the beginning you're the end of our faith Lord I may not feel like I can believe but I just know your word is true Lord Jesus I pray that we go forward not on feelings but the confidence that you never lie that your word is always true as we go from this place tonight I pray Lord that each one that has raised their hand Lord I pray that there's something that settles in our heart we're not looking for an outward sensation but a confidence that your word never fails and it will not return to you void God upon your word we go forward upon your word Lord we ask tonight for all the those that receive prayer may you continue not just tonight not we know that they're already healed but Lord encourage their faith when they're at home when they're feeling discourage May the Holy Spirit wrap your arms around them Lord and just Comfort them may their confidence be increased and Lord we pray also for brother Jord who's been a faithful servant all these years God we pray that you will continue to pour out your blessings for him Lord we're so thankful for the work that's been done we're so thankful for his approach and his sharing of his testimony God may you restore and bless him as he has poured out Lord
