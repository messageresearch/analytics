[28:00] that a lot of times we'll say that and
[28:02] we refer to
[28:03] that but that's the truth we can't make
[28:06] it without him we need his leadership we
[28:09] need him to direct us we need the
[28:13] greatness of God to even help us to see
[28:16] the areas in our life that need his
[28:22] touch and I'm glad that when he comes
[28:25] that way you know he doesn't come come
[28:27] to shame he doesn't come to condemn but
[28:30] he comes to lift up that part of himself
[28:34] on the inside amen reminding you and I
[28:37] of who we are as Sons and Daughters of
[28:39] God that's what this message come to do
[28:42] is to make us aware that we are Sons and
[28:44] Daughters of God and the authority that
[28:47] we have you realize if a person could be
[28:50] sitting even here tonight or even under
[28:52] the sound of our voice and streaming
[28:54] maybe there could be something that
[28:56] there in behind their light life that
[28:57] they would be so bound with do you
[29:00] realize that there is nothing that can
[29:02] hold a child of God when you make a
[29:05] decision in your heart I'm not going to
[29:07] let this keep me here that's right think
[29:10] about it before those Legion of devils
[29:12] were ever cast out of
[29:15] Legion he made his way out of the Tomb a
[29:18] legion of devils was not able to help
[29:21] him or was not able to stop him from
[29:24] getting where he needed to get brother
[29:26] Bram said he heard Jesus was coming and
[29:28] he wasn't about to let them Devils stop
[29:31] him
[29:32] amen he got in the presence of God and
[29:35] we know the rest is
[29:36] history amen one of those days when we
[29:39] stand on the other side we'll greet him
[29:43] and he'll be able to tell us my name is
[29:45] so and so we'll say oh God bless you
[29:47] he'll say now you might have heard of me
[29:49] in the scripture what I was under the
[29:52] name of what I was occupied by Legion
[29:55] but this is my name who I am
[29:59] God is so good he's so good amen I want
[30:04] to uh make just a couple quick
[30:06] announcements uh here this evening um
[30:09] there is a signup sheet that we have put
[30:11] out there on the table where you write
[30:13] prayer request I'll announce it today as
[30:16] well as on Sunday that um that's for if
[30:19] you plan on attending on December 30th
[30:23] um the event that brother Josh way is
[30:26] hosting
[30:27] in welcoming sister Sharon and uh I know
[30:31] that U I don't have the address for the
[30:33] venue but what I do have is it's set up
[30:35] there uh in Parma and um I myself I plan
[30:40] on Lord willing I plan on going and
[30:42] being there I've got a drive back from
[30:44] youth retreat on that uh on that morning
[30:47] and that day so I'll probably just have
[30:49] to come by snatch my wife and we'll head
[30:50] on over there by the time I get back in
[30:53] on Saturday from retreat but um that's
[30:56] December 30th on the Saturday and um we
[31:00] need to know he needs to know a
[31:01] headcount brother Josh way does for
[31:04] those coming so he knows how much how
[31:07] much food to order and so there's a
[31:10] place out there for you to put your name
[31:11] and number that'll be attending and if
[31:14] you have any other questions I'll put
[31:16] his
[31:16] number on the sheet everybody okay with
[31:20] that I'll put his number on the sheet so
[31:22] you don't have to it's not me I he has
[31:25] all the other details with it so any
[31:27] questions you can talk to brother uh
[31:29] Josh way about that and I certainly
[31:32] think that it would be good that as many
[31:34] of us can go and support that that would
[31:36] be really good and um also um just uh
[31:42] want to remember I know different ones
[31:43] are traveling and we have many needs
[31:45] that I know prayer requests that were
[31:48] given here tonight there's many
[31:50] different needs Among Us um I want you
[31:53] to continue remember Sister Ruth Hoyer
[31:55] in prayer brother Brian and them there
[31:56] there as a family and with her and we're
[31:59] standing uh with our sister I know she's
[32:02] not the only one that's battling cancer
[32:04] uh right now there's there's many others
[32:06] that are battling brother Ron Spencer
[32:09] different ones and um we want to
[32:12] continue to remember them in prayer um I
[32:15] think that is I think that is it um also
[32:19] just a little update the I know the red
[32:21] line and all of that that was run going
[32:23] up uh sister Michelle Carper that red
[32:26] line honey am I right the red line is
[32:28] gone the red line is gone and so we
[32:31] thank the Lord for that cuz a lot of you
[32:33] know what that means infection was going
[32:34] to the heart so we just thank the Lord
[32:37] for that that you know that's there's
[32:39] been a touch there for her and so we
[32:41] want you just to continue remember them
[32:43] in prayer um also sister Anna I know
[32:46] that request was made as well the Lord
[32:48] will just continue to strengthen
[32:50] her and then I just had got a text here
[32:52] early this morning that uh for sister
[32:55] from Sister Doris that she is in uh
[32:57] feeling well she was supposed to finally
[32:59] have the appointment uh that was
[33:00] scheduled with the uh the doctor that
[33:03] looks at the brain and all those things
[33:05] like that and months out they had to
[33:07] schedule it but she had to cancel
[33:09] because being um I believe she said was
[33:12] positive for uh Co and so um we just
[33:16] want to remember her in prayer the Lord
[33:18] will just continue to um just move for
[33:21] her so good to be here
[33:23] tonight it's good to be in the house of
[33:26] the Lord and um I to me this is a it's
[33:31] kind of a well it's special time for all
[33:33] of us and um you know we begin to just
[33:37] kind of think of it and uh brother my
[33:41] son he mentioned it last night and I
[33:43] hadn't really gave it too much thought
[33:44] he said dad he was actually talking to
[33:46] his mom and then she made me wear later
[33:48] on at night and she said um how Paul had
[33:51] mentioned he said you know Dad he said
[33:53] here he said God just brought a minister
[33:55] out of the youth group and I said I
[33:57] hadn't really thought too much about
[33:59] that um but I know that um with brother
[34:03] Brian and I've watched you know with his
[34:05] life and I've watched amen and and been
[34:08] right there with him and so I I just he
[34:11] did did a wonderful job at our youth
[34:13] meeting there in in November uh the
[34:15] young people that are here they can
[34:16] attest to that he did a wonderful job
[34:19] and so we just want to pull on the gift
[34:21] of God you know I what I've I've told
[34:23] him I've told him this multiple times
[34:25] three times I told him this and you'll
[34:27] get to hear the fourth time right now I
[34:29] said when I'm there that night I said I
[34:31] want you to understand I'm not there to
[34:33] CR critique you I'm there to stand and
[34:36] pull on the gift of God that's what I'm
[34:39] here for I'm here to support the gift of
[34:42] God Amen and I I I told him like this
[34:45] today I said look I said every one of us
[34:47] are different every one of us we study
[34:50] different the way we go about our notes
[34:53] it's all it's different and even our
[34:55] delivery it's all different
[34:57] and you know that's the same way
[34:58] sometimes when we look at it as a
[35:01] congregation we we can uh see the
[35:04] different styles of delivery and God has
[35:07] such uniqueness that way you know over
[35:09] time all those things God there's a
[35:11] developing as we continue to yield but I
[35:14] believe tonight we just we've gathered
[35:16] here
[35:16] tonight not to hear Brother Brian Hannah
[35:20] but we've gathered here tonight to hear
[35:22] from
[35:22] God and that God would just take a
[35:25] vessel that's yielded to the Lord and
[35:29] just to speak to our needs tonight and
[35:32] that's that's what we want is God just
[35:35] to have his way amen so just just get
[35:38] behind and just pull on the gift of God
[35:41] tonight you know sure he'll be a little
[35:44] nervous but I told him I said if you
[35:45] ever lose that spot about being nervous
[35:48] then you probably better not be standing
[35:50] there cuz no matter how long you've been
[35:53] there still a nervousness that's there
[35:55] but you you learn to just trust him more
[35:57] and more and more but I'm thankful to
[36:00] the Lord for what God is doing amen so
[36:02] as we just welcome brother Brian here

[36:07] his heart what the Lord's put on his

[44:50] 15:7 John
[44:54] 15:7
[45:02] amen it says if ye abide in
[45:05] me and my words abide in
[45:08] you you shall ask what you
[45:11] will and it shall be done unto
[45:15] you brother brandham said in the message
[45:17] presuming I just love to read the word
[45:20] because I know that it's
[45:22] true the word is what we stay by it must
[45:26] always be the word of
[45:28] God or we'll go down the wrong
[45:31] road amen I just want to speak today on
[45:35] I had a couple titles to stay with the
[45:37] word but um just want to preach on the
[45:40] god of
[45:41] possibility amen if you can have your
[45:47] seats so what is it to stay with the
[45:49] word of
[45:51] God each and every age had a had a day
[45:55] where they had to to stay with the word
[45:56] of God in the beginning with Eve she had
[46:00] one message to stay with don't eat don't
[46:02] eat of the tree of knowledge of Good and
[46:04] Evil she was to listen to Adam she had
[46:07] that one word but she went down the
[46:10] wrong
[46:10] road and brother Braham says if we don't
[46:13] stay with that word we go down the wrong
[46:16] road Noah had a message for his
[46:19] day and that was to build an
[46:22] ark amen God said it was going to rain
[46:25] never reigned before in the world but
[46:28] God gave him instructions how to build
[46:30] that Ark only Noah had that instruction
[46:33] if you didn't listen to that messenger
[46:35] of that day if you didn't get inside the
[46:36] ark once that door was closed brother
[46:39] brandham said you perished that was the
[46:42] day of Noah Moses's day I know there's
[46:45] many Commandments and many things he did
[46:48] but um one of the first things he did
[46:51] brother brandham said or um the Bible
[46:53] says that you must apply the
[46:57] token and outside of that token they
[47:00] didn't they were they were children of
[47:02] Abraham they were circumcised but
[47:04] brother brandom said they had to apply
[47:06] the token that light that light was good
[47:09] in that day but in that day you had to
[47:12] apply the token right and it wasn't on
[47:15] the back door it wasn't on the side door
[47:18] it was on the front door for all the
[47:19] world to see and they had to come under
[47:22] it they weren't allowed to walk over it
[47:25] stand upon on it but the word was over
[47:28] them amen right and I just like a story
[47:31] brother brandom told one time in
[47:32] Martin's day there was a man um that he
[47:37] was saying listen to me listen to me I
[47:39] have I I'm going to I'm I'm one of the
[47:42] old prophets God sent me a robe you have
[47:45] to listen to me and brother brandom
[47:46] always said watch out for that man that
[47:48] says listen to me all the
[47:50] time and those were one of Martin's
[47:53] students and those Bishops just kept
[47:56] listening to him and uh man it's real
[47:59] it's real weird not hearing music with
[48:02] me tonight but uh
[48:06] um but uh anyways so that man came and
[48:11] said listen to me there was already a
[48:13] messenger for that day and Martin was
[48:16] that messenger but there was a man that
[48:17] rose up and said listen to me God's
[48:20] going to send me a road but those Bishop
[48:22] Bishops just kept watching them they had
[48:24] to stay with that word that they were
[48:25] just saying H some something's not right
[48:27] but let let's let it play
[48:29] out but all of a sudden you know that
[48:32] man walks in with that robe and those
[48:34] Bishops you know that they said let's
[48:36] let's bring it before Martin let's bring
[48:38] it before Martin and see what he's he's
[48:40] he's got to say about it the messenger
[48:43] of the hour and that that student was
[48:44] like I was told I was told not to go
[48:46] before Martin and brother Braham say see
[48:48] there there where you are that's where
[48:50] you are if you just bring it before the
[48:52] message the message of the hour it'll
[48:54] it'll expose it'll expose that that
[48:57] falseness and uh they took them anyways
[48:59] and that robe just per or or vanished
[49:03] and that I think that's what we need to
[49:04] do today God has sent us a message in
[49:06] this
[49:07] hour any anything that you're seeing in
[49:10] your life anything that's creeping in um
[49:14] I would always take it before the
[49:15] message of the hour bring it bring it
[49:18] always back to the message this message
[49:21] is not brother brandom's opinion it's
[49:23] not our opinion many men have tried to
[49:25] rise up and send out videos and say oh
[49:28] this was just brother brother Brandon's
[49:30] opinion but this message is the the word
[49:33] of God but it's actually the mind of God
[49:35] what God has expressed in this day amen
[49:38] that's right and that's what Eve that's
[49:40] what Eve should have done in her day all
[49:43] she had to do when the serpent was
[49:45] talking to her all she had to do is say
[49:47] hey let's go see what Adam says about
[49:49] this amen bring it back to the word of
[49:51] God Amen and we have a message in our
[49:54] day Malachi 4 behold old I send you
[49:56] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[49:58] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[50:00] and he shall turn the children of the
[50:02] fathers the children of that's our
[50:04] message lest I come and smite the Earth
[50:06] with a curse amen and brother brandom's
[50:08] message like brother Samuel was just
[50:10] saying before I came out here it was to
[50:12] lift us up if this message is is saying
[50:15] oh you know trying to bring you down
[50:17] that's just the enemy trying to keep you
[50:20] away from this truth amen God has never
[50:23] God has has never rubbed your face in
[50:25] the dirt he's never rubbed my face in
[50:27] the dirt he's always come to lift me up
[50:29] amen that's right and brother Brandon
[50:31] was to introduce the Holy Spirit his his
[50:34] highlight of his whole Ministry he said
[50:36] was the token and that tokenise Lord Not
[50:39] only was it it wasn't brother BR said it
[50:41] wasn't the chemistry of the blood it was
[50:44] the actual life that was in the blood
[50:47] and
[50:48] um Jesus said um these works that I do
[50:53] shall you do also why is that because it
[50:55] was the Holy Spirit in us now but
[50:57] brother bram's message was to introduce
[51:00] the Holy Spirit not an actual 2,000
[51:03] years ago it was an actual being Jesus
[51:06] came upon the Earth John the Baptist
[51:07] introduced the Messiah John the Baptist
[51:09] said behold I send or um he said there's
[51:12] one among you whom you know not that's
[51:15] right and he said Behold the Lamb of God
[51:17] and right when he said that there was
[51:19] Andrew and Phillip that were following
[51:21] John at that time and in the message uh
[51:24] convinced and concerned he said right
[51:26] when uh John the Baptist said Behold the
[51:28] Lamb of God Andrew and Phillip just
[51:30] stopped what they were doing and started
[51:32] to follow Jesus Christ amen and I think
[51:35] that's what we need to do today amen but
[51:37] brother brandham said convinced and
[51:39] concerned said I'll have to change that
[51:41] part tonight and there is one standing
[51:44] among you whom you see not that's the
[51:47] Holy Spirit he's the one he makes every
[51:50] promise true amen so that that was the
[51:52] message of our hour Amen to follow the
[51:55] the Holy Spirit anything that that God's
[51:57] convicting in your
[51:59] life that is the holy spirit trying to
[52:01] get you back on track back on track with
[52:03] the word amen like brother brandom he
[52:06] saw one time he saw the church the Bride
[52:09] of Jesus Christ um marching in white
[52:12] robes and uh at the very end there was a
[52:15] few people that got got off Off the Mark
[52:18] got out got out of March amen and but
[52:22] brother brandham cried out and said get
[52:24] back in line get back in line and I
[52:26] think that's what we need to do tonight
[52:28] if there's anybody who feels like their
[52:30] their life isn't in in line with the
[52:32] word of God and they're they feel like
[52:35] they're they're in a backsliding
[52:36] condition or there's something that they
[52:37] may be struggling with I pray that you
[52:40] would just listen to uh the voice that's
[52:43] inside you saying get back in line amen
[52:47] and uh my wife and I were talking about
[52:48] that one time and she made a good point
[52:51] and and it was when brother brandom said
[52:53] get back in line they were still
[52:55] children of God it didn't make them not
[52:58] children of God they were still the
[52:59] Bride of Jesus Christ so just because
[53:01] you've got off the mark a little bit got
[53:03] off the path you're still a child of God
[53:05] Amen don't let the enemy try to keep you
[53:07] down try to keep rubbing your face in
[53:09] the dirt you are a child of God this
[53:11] message has come to lift us up amen not
[53:13] to bring us down that's right brother
[53:15] bandam said in the token the token
[53:17] agrees with every word see it's got to
[53:20] because it is the word it's the life
[53:22] that was in the word my words are
[53:24] spiritual they are life said Jesus
[53:29] amen
[53:31] amen and then that he might send back
[53:34] the Holy Spirit to continue the works
[53:36] that Jesus did the works that I do shall
[53:38] you do also amen and brother brandham
[53:41] said in the church age book if you are a
[53:43] true seed of God you'll hear every word
[53:46] you'll receive every word for your day
[53:48] just like just like the the children of
[53:50] Israel they had to receive the word for
[53:52] their day just like Noah they had to
[53:53] receive the word for their day
[53:55] amen they could build whatever boat they
[53:57] wanted to but there was only one message
[54:00] amen sir and God sunk every every
[54:03] everything that wasn't uh wasn't of Noah
[54:06] and I always just I always try to just
[54:09] use this example and um it's just kind
[54:12] of simple but people try to say this
[54:15] message is wrong or brother brandom's
[54:17] you know just has an opinion but I
[54:19] always bring it back to Noah I said can
[54:21] you imagine just walking with Noah and
[54:24] and just try to say oh Noah is this your
[54:26] is this just your opinion are you sure
[54:28] you're cutting this board right are are
[54:30] you sure this door should be here should
[54:32] this window be here should there be
[54:34] three floors but God had a Noah had an
[54:37] instruction from the almighty God
[54:40] Amen and and uh his his boat was the
[54:43] only boat that floated above the waters
[54:45] [Music]
[54:48] amen the proof of the indwelling spear
[54:50] was to acknowledge and follow what God's
[54:53] Prophet gave for his age and he sent
[54:55] sent to set the church in order the
[54:57] evidence of the Spirit-filled Christian
[54:58] believer is not to produce the truth the
[55:01] word but to receive the truth the word
[55:03] and to believe and Obey it
[55:06] amen and brother brandom said have you
[55:08] ever noticed in Revelations 22:17 the
[55:10] spirit and the bride say come the bride
[55:13] speaks the same word as the spirit if
[55:16] you have the spirit you will hear the
[55:18] word for your age amen and I pray that
[55:21] we would all receive that Spirit and the
[55:23] word that's in our age amen if like I
[55:26] said my my my thought tonight is if if
[55:29] God is stirring something in your heart
[55:32] I just pray you would you would just
[55:34] yield to that and um I'm just an example
[55:36] of that I've I've had this calling on my
[55:38] heart for many many years and I've
[55:41] always just rejected I've kept things in
[55:43] my life
[55:44] where you know God God couldn't use me
[55:47] and it it would have been a very uh a
[55:49] stumbling block to many but uh God's uh
[55:53] brought me to a place where I was able
[55:55] able to just yield and give my heart
[55:57] completely to him
[55:59] amen um and I just want to talk about
[56:02] Samson tonight and parallel with it with
[56:04] our lives and
[56:06] um obviously we know uh Samson was a
[56:10] Nazarite he was uh was called for a
[56:13] total separation from the world even his
[56:17] uh mother had uh to keep the word for
[56:19] her day the angel of the Lord says don't
[56:22] eat anything defiled don't drink
[56:25] anything strong drink alcohol wine she
[56:29] had a word for her day amen because the
[56:32] God was bringing a deliverer to Israel
[56:35] amen and brother brandham also said God
[56:38] is a separator not a mixer you can't
[56:41] serve God and man at the same time
[56:43] you're either serving God or you're
[56:45] serving the devil
[56:47] amen and U um Samson was never to cut
[56:50] his hair that was the word for his hour
[56:54] his mother taught him as as a young
[56:55] child and I believe all mothers should
[56:58] teach their children as a young child
[56:59] brother brandom said you're the Fifth
[57:01] Gospel of the home amen if you're if
[57:03] you're a mother and you have children
[57:04] tonight I just I just pray you would
[57:06] just uh minister to your CH your
[57:08] children have a life before them that's
[57:10] an example where they can trust you and
[57:13] bring the anointing and the presence of
[57:14] God in your home amen because there's
[57:16] many children that go to school have a
[57:18] lot of pressures in this hour and they
[57:20] need to come to a place not only church
[57:23] but come to home to be able to release
[57:25] their pressures of the age
[57:27] amen and um Samson also his his word of
[57:32] the day was to destroy and kill
[57:34] Philistines he was a messenger for that
[57:36] day for the children of
[57:38] Israel and uh Samson did many miracles
[57:41] in his day as we know and
[57:44] um there was one time when uh the
[57:48] children of Israel um the Philistines
[57:51] came after the children of Israel and uh
[57:54] they were wondering
[57:55] why you coming after us and these
[57:57] Philistines were coming after Sam Samson
[57:59] so the children of Israel bound Samson
[58:02] with with ropes that brother Bram said
[58:04] that
[58:05] um uh that horses couldn't even tear
[58:08] apart and they brought the Philistines
[58:11] or they brought Samson before the
[58:13] Philistines and
[58:16] uh but um once Samson got in front of
[58:19] those Philistines he was uh he was able
[58:23] to um feel those Seven Locks in the back
[58:26] of his head and he he began to remember
[58:28] what his mother told him and uh he says
[58:32] I've got nothing but a Jawbone to give
[58:34] you so I'll give it to you and he slayed
[58:36] over a thousand Philistines and brother
[58:38] brandham said that Jawbone that was
[58:40] laying in the desert and the hot beating
[58:42] Sun would should have just blown into
[58:45] pieces after he hit the the Philistines
[58:47] with an inch brass helmet but Moses or
[58:50] um Samson took took um killed every
[58:53] every one of those Philistines and made
[58:55] them went running
[58:57] amen amen and and brother brandom said
[58:59] the spirit of God come upon him that's
[59:01] what makes the difference amen and Moses
[59:04] Moses wasn't wasn't a soldier he's never
[59:07] fought in a day in his life he had a
[59:08] couple experiences with with a lion but
[59:11] uh brother Bram said he wasn't a skilled
[59:13] Soldier like those men but he just
[59:15] looked around and found a Jawbone and uh
[59:18] whooped a thousand Philistines and I
[59:20] think I think whatever God's revealing
[59:22] to you tonight if it's John 3:16
[59:25] just take that take that Jawbone and
[59:27] whoop every Devil with it until God
[59:28] reveals something else to you amen
[59:32] hallelujah and also brother baham said
[59:35] he didn't have time to think well now I
[59:37] I got to pray through first to whoop
[59:39] these thousands of Philistines he know
[59:41] that God was with them there was no
[59:43] condemnation and I believe that's the
[59:44] state of the the children of God should
[59:46] be in that we shouldn't have you know
[59:49] times where the enemy is coming in like
[59:51] a flood and we have to pray through
[59:52] first of all of our sins and
[59:54] condemnation
[59:55] we should already be prayed up and
[59:57] serving God like we should so when the
[59:59] enemy does come in like a flood we're
[1:00:01] able to meet him on the battlefield and
[1:00:03] Slay Slay thousands of Philistines amen
[1:00:07] and one time in Gaza another miracle
[1:00:09] that happened the enemy surrounded
[1:00:11] Samson um when he went to Gaza and um
[1:00:17] they went out to kill
[1:00:18] him and uh he woke up in in the middle
[1:00:22] of the night and the spirit of God came
[1:00:24] came on Came Upon him again and uh
[1:00:28] brother brandom said he ripped off those
[1:00:29] Gates walked right past his enemy and
[1:00:33] carried that carried that gate and I I
[1:00:36] looked it up from Gaza to heon they said
[1:00:38] it was about 37 miles and it was up
[1:00:42] elevation 3,000 ft amen and what made
[1:00:46] the difference was the spirit of God was
[1:00:48] upon him all Samson had to do was fill
[1:00:51] those Seven Locks in the back of his
[1:00:53] head and he said he knew God was with
[1:00:55] him because why because he was keeping
[1:00:56] the word of God Amen brother Bram says
[1:00:59] when a man is in line of duty for God
[1:01:01] there's no gate know nothing can stand
[1:01:03] in his way than you
[1:01:07] Lord but Samson had one problem he was a
[1:01:12] lady he he was a ladies man brother Bram
[1:01:15] said Samson was a great man as long as
[1:01:18] he followed the Lord but what and as
[1:01:21] long as he kept God's Commandments
[1:01:23] walked with God God used him and he he
[1:01:27] did the church the same as long as the
[1:01:29] church walks with God and keeps the
[1:01:31] Commandments of God God can use the
[1:01:33] church but when the church gets off the
[1:01:35] sideline as Samson did then God can't
[1:01:38] use the church no
[1:01:40] more and brother Bram also said Samson
[1:01:43] did real well he had a good start good
[1:01:45] start and he did all right until he
[1:01:48] began to flirt and when he began to
[1:01:50] flirt he got in trouble and that's
[1:01:52] that's a lot of the things um with us
[1:01:54] today or new Believers or just uh the
[1:01:59] enemy likes to set traps for us and we
[1:02:02] we begin to flirt with the world and we
[1:02:04] get in a a heap of
[1:02:08] trouble and uh Samson he had a lady
[1:02:11] problem he and it was always with the
[1:02:13] Philistines the enemy he was called to
[1:02:16] destroy he always flirted with the Enemy
[1:02:18] and it was the women he married a
[1:02:20] Philistine woman and then in Gaza he he
[1:02:23] had another and then and finally it was
[1:02:26] Delilah and um the devil always likes to
[1:02:30] study you as well because Samson his
[1:02:33] first wife he told a riddle to the
[1:02:36] people and uh to receive garments and uh
[1:02:39] some sheets it said but is those those
[1:02:43] three or those 30 people came and
[1:02:46] pressed his wife and said get Samson to
[1:02:49] tell us what that riddle
[1:02:51] is and that woman the woman he was
[1:02:55] flirting with pressed him so great that
[1:02:57] he finally told her the r the riddle and
[1:03:00] she told his enemy and that was the same
[1:03:02] thing with Delilah um she began to press
[1:03:06] him the Bible says in judges and when it
[1:03:08] came to pass she pressed him daily with
[1:03:10] her words and urged him so his soul was
[1:03:13] vexed unto death that he told her his
[1:03:17] whole heart and that's what that's what
[1:03:21] um brother brandham said brother Bram
[1:03:23] said God or Sam gave God all of his
[1:03:25] strength but he didn't give his heart to
[1:03:28] God he gave his heart to
[1:03:32] Delilah and I just pray you would give
[1:03:34] your full heart heart to God tonight you
[1:03:37] know I I I was there just like Samson
[1:03:40] before I I could you know say quotes of
[1:03:43] the message I believe brother Brandon
[1:03:45] was a prophet I came to church but I was
[1:03:47] still flirting with the world and uh
[1:03:50] brother brandom said once also you had
[1:03:53] sales but no anchor and it was just like
[1:03:56] Peter Peter was able to say Lord I'll
[1:03:58] never deny you and he cut the high
[1:04:00] priest's ear off but when it came time
[1:04:02] of the the squeeze and the pressure
[1:04:05] Peter went off running you're one or the
[1:04:10] other and uh so when Samson gave his his
[1:04:14] secret away to Delilah Samson did all
[1:04:17] these all these Miracles killed a
[1:04:20] thousand Philistines carried those Tong
[1:04:23] gates to Gaza killed a
[1:04:26] lion and he just began to
[1:04:30] purum and brother Braham said that
[1:04:33] that's what's wrong with the the church
[1:04:35] today they they presume they're all
[1:04:37] right they have they have a lot of
[1:04:40] blessings God has answered prayer you
[1:04:43] know just like the children of Israel
[1:04:45] reain Mana every day but when it time to
[1:04:48] cross over into the promised
[1:04:50] land they didn't do
[1:04:53] it kades barnea and then they finally
[1:04:56] said okay we'll go but and Moses told
[1:04:58] them not to go and it um Moses and the
[1:05:01] Ark stayed behind and they presumed and
[1:05:03] got
[1:05:05] defeated and that's that's the problem
[1:05:08] with the church
[1:05:10] today and uh and judges he and the
[1:05:14] Delilah said the Philistines be upon
[1:05:16] thee Samson and he awoke out of his
[1:05:19] sleep and said I will go out as other
[1:05:21] times before and shake myself and he
[1:05:24] wish not that the Lord was departed from
[1:05:26] him Samson said well I'll just rise and
[1:05:28] shake myself and just go out like I've
[1:05:31] always done and then when I do it God
[1:05:33] will be there I just presume he was
[1:05:35] there but he found out he was
[1:05:38] gone and brother Bram said ju and just
[1:05:41] once more Lord that's his that was
[1:05:44] that's the secret is the word if ye
[1:05:46] abide in me and my words abide in you
[1:05:48] then ask what you will and it will be
[1:05:51] done see that's where they lose their
[1:05:53] secret
[1:05:55] yes so when Samson was conquered by the
[1:05:58] the Philistines he
[1:06:00] was conquered by the the enemy that he
[1:06:03] was supposed to
[1:06:08] destroy and uh Delilah stripped him of
[1:06:12] his power those Seven Locks that his
[1:06:15] mother told him to never cut that he was
[1:06:17] always raised to stay with that word and
[1:06:21] after they they stripped him of his
[1:06:22] power they took his sight they took his
[1:06:24] eyes out they bound his feet and they
[1:06:28] took him to to a a grinding
[1:06:30] mill and I think that's what the enemy
[1:06:32] wants to do to a lot of people he wants
[1:06:35] to strip you of your power take you off
[1:06:37] the word take you take your sight away
[1:06:40] so you can't even see where you're going
[1:06:42] bind your feet so you can't walk in the
[1:06:43] promises of God and it'll bring you to a
[1:06:46] grinding mill where you just keep
[1:06:47] walking in circles a repenti a repen of
[1:06:51] cycle but I think we we we need to be
[1:06:54] set free of that tonight
[1:06:55] [Music]
[1:06:56] amen
[1:06:58] amen bro and then um so Samson was
[1:07:03] brought before the main event brother
[1:07:05] brandom said where 3,000 Philistines
[1:07:08] were on a
[1:07:09] roof and he was led by a little lad just
[1:07:12] led by by The Hand by a little
[1:07:15] lad a man that was able to carry tons of
[1:07:20] tons of weight rip a lion kill thousands
[1:07:23] of Phil Ines now had to be led by just a
[1:07:27] little
[1:07:29] boy and that's that's the dangers of not
[1:07:32] surrendering your full heart to God Amen
[1:07:36] when when Satan takes you off that word
[1:07:38] he's out to Seek and Destroy he's not
[1:07:40] he's not here to uplift you he's not
[1:07:42] here to save you he's here to take
[1:07:45] everything away from you one thing he'll
[1:07:47] do with a life is he he'll completely
[1:07:50] destroy
[1:07:51] it it may look all shin shiny but
[1:07:55] brother Ram says I don't want anything
[1:07:57] shiny I want something that glows and
[1:07:58] that's this message amen
[1:08:01] amen hallelujah so the Philistines the
[1:08:04] Philistines at Samson was meant to
[1:08:07] destroy and kill and help the children
[1:08:10] of Israel brother Bram said what a sad
[1:08:12] State because that man was that
[1:08:15] messenger of the hour to deliver the
[1:08:16] children of Israel and now their their
[1:08:19] messenger was blind in Chains and being
[1:08:23] made fun of by the
[1:08:28] enemy and brother bam also said God
[1:08:31] never forsaken Samson it was Samson that
[1:08:34] forsake God and that's that's when we
[1:08:37] that's what happens to us God has never
[1:08:39] forsaken us he's always right here but
[1:08:41] brother brandom says you need to go back
[1:08:43] to where you left him amen
[1:08:47] amen but brother man says what was going
[1:08:50] through Samson's mind when he was
[1:08:53] walking around that that that Coliseum
[1:08:55] with those big pillars those 3,000
[1:08:57] people just looking down at them
[1:08:59] laughing and that's what the enemy wants
[1:09:01] to do to you is just look down at you
[1:09:03] and laugh at you you come to church
[1:09:06] saying you're a Christian but there's
[1:09:09] something in your in your life something
[1:09:11] that you're supposed to destroy but
[1:09:13] Satan can sit there in church and just
[1:09:15] laugh at you and you're there with
[1:09:17] condemnation you can't worship like you
[1:09:19] want to you can't raise your hands like
[1:09:22] you want to you can't feed on the word
[1:09:23] of God like you want to cuz Samson or
[1:09:26] that that enemy is always there making
[1:09:28] fun of
[1:09:29] you but brother Bram said do you ever
[1:09:31] think while those Philistines were
[1:09:33] wondering about Samson did you ever
[1:09:35] think what was going through his mind he
[1:09:38] was thinking about all the great
[1:09:40] victories that God had given him there
[1:09:43] there was thinking of the days that was
[1:09:46] what they used to be or what they used
[1:09:48] to do what he used to do and that
[1:09:51] brother Bram said that's the condition
[1:09:52] of this age man is is always looking at
[1:09:55] what God did before and what God is
[1:09:57] going to do but he's he's missing what
[1:09:59] God is doing right now man is always
[1:10:02] thinking back to what God did and
[1:10:03] looking forward to what God will do but
[1:10:05] ignoring what God is doing see look what
[1:10:08] he's doing now he's sending to us and
[1:10:10] trying to stir us up again trying to
[1:10:12] bring us back to the path of his word
[1:10:15] amen but then that's when
[1:10:17] Samson's Samson's thoughts begin to
[1:10:21] change when he begin to think of the
[1:10:23] Great
[1:10:25] victories he
[1:10:27] began to think on is there a
[1:10:32] possibility Revenge my eyes what was
[1:10:34] Samson
[1:10:35] thinking there was a possibility perhaps
[1:10:39] Jehovah's full of
[1:10:40] love it might be possible that he would
[1:10:43] hear
[1:10:44] me oh I wish I could get Samson to wake
[1:10:47] to that tonight there is a
[1:10:49] possibility he is full of love forgiving
[1:10:52] the iniquity of his people
[1:10:54] from generation to generation showing
[1:10:56] mercies to thousands that love him and
[1:10:58] keep his
[1:10:59] Commandments thank you
[1:11:01] Lord Brother brandham
[1:11:04] said he seen his mistakes he seen his
[1:11:08] failures he began to realize what time
[1:11:11] time it
[1:11:12] was and brother Bram said you better
[1:11:14] kill your enemy before he kills you and
[1:11:18] that what was going through Samson's
[1:11:20] mind Samson knew he was blind he was
[1:11:23] chained
[1:11:24] stripped of his power he knew the enemy
[1:11:26] was going to kill him but he began to
[1:11:29] think is there a
[1:11:31] possibility and that's when brother
[1:11:32] baram says I'm going to repent he cried
[1:11:35] out there is a possibility that he could
[1:11:37] do the
[1:11:38] same
[1:11:40] amen and why was there a
[1:11:44] possibility right when Samson was
[1:11:46] captured the Bible says his hair began
[1:11:48] to
[1:11:49] grow so through that whole time when
[1:11:52] Samson was being being used of a show a
[1:11:55] show and sport that hair be to grow I've
[1:11:58] always wondered why that why why the
[1:12:00] enemy never cut his hair again but it
[1:12:04] just shows that the enemy doesn't know
[1:12:06] anything about this word doesn't know
[1:12:08] about the promises of
[1:12:10] God he wouldn't have let Jesus go and be
[1:12:13] crucified I remember brother Samuel
[1:12:15] saying I don't know if brother branam
[1:12:17] said it but when when Jesus was going up
[1:12:20] that hill to Calvary he Satan was
[1:12:22] wondering could this this be the one
[1:12:24] could this be the one but God God
[1:12:26] blinded him so that we would have an
[1:12:28] opportunity to be baptized with the holy
[1:12:30] spirit amen if Satan really knew who
[1:12:33] Jesus was he wouldn't let let him go to
[1:12:35] Calvary
[1:12:35] [Music]
[1:12:37] amen but Samson not he was blind but he
[1:12:41] was still able to feel those Seven
[1:12:43] Locks his hair began to
[1:12:48] grow and samton began to think about the
[1:12:51] prophecy I will restore say the
[1:12:55] Lord he seen Samson's hair grow it out
[1:12:58] again that was God's promise to
[1:13:01] Samson and when he God seen Samson with
[1:13:04] this promise God was obligated to
[1:13:07] Samson amen and the law of God by the
[1:13:11] Holy Spirit brings any promise to pass
[1:13:14] regardless of the conditions
[1:13:18] amen restoration of the Bride tree
[1:13:21] brother Bram says regardless of how
[1:13:23] little we are how low we are how impure
[1:13:26] we are how Unholy we are how sick we are
[1:13:29] how Afflicted we are the law of God's
[1:13:32] spirit by his word makes it obey him
[1:13:34] forces the issue and and says give it
[1:13:37] back amen oh how we could just think for
[1:13:40] a minute forces it regardless of the
[1:13:43] conditions no matter what condition is
[1:13:46] the law of God's word forces the
[1:13:47] condition to cope with his word see it's
[1:13:50] going
[1:13:52] to
[1:13:56] Sarah had a possibility one
[1:13:59] time when those three Angels
[1:14:01] Came to
[1:14:07] Abraham when the angel said that they
[1:14:09] would have a have a child at their age
[1:14:13] 100 years old and 90 Sarah began to
[1:14:17] laugh and the angel of the Lord when she
[1:14:19] became when she came before the the
[1:14:21] angel of the Lord the of the Lord why
[1:14:24] did Sarah laugh saying in her heart
[1:14:26] these things can't
[1:14:29] be here is the possibility God would
[1:14:32] have struck her dead right there but he
[1:14:34] couldn't she is part of Abraham for our
[1:14:37] our unbelief he would have struck struck
[1:14:40] us dead but he can't we are part of
[1:14:43] Christ Grace holds us but he still has
[1:14:46] to keep his word amen God promised a
[1:14:49] child through Sarah not Hagar but it was
[1:14:53] through through Sarah God couldn't
[1:14:55] strike her dead because she was part of
[1:14:56] Abraham she was part of the promise amen
[1:14:59] same with Eve when Eve sinned she went
[1:15:01] back to her her uh husband
[1:15:05] Adam but when God Came In The Garden of
[1:15:08] even Eden trying to find them Eve should
[1:15:11] have been dead but why didn't God kill
[1:15:13] her cuz she was a part of Adam Adam's
[1:15:16] life was inside of Eve amen and God God
[1:15:19] can't kill
[1:15:21] himself and God can't kill you tonight
[1:15:27] amen but Jesus beheld him and said unto
[1:15:30] them with men it is impossible but With
[1:15:33] God all things are
[1:15:35] possible my sheep hear my voice and I
[1:15:38] know them and they follow me and I give
[1:15:40] them eternal life and they shall never
[1:15:42] perish neither shall any man pluck them
[1:15:45] out of my hand my father gave them to me
[1:15:49] my Father which gave them me is greater
[1:15:51] than than all and no man is able to
[1:15:53] pluck them out of my father's
[1:15:57] hand but with Sam or with Samson's mind
[1:16:01] starting to
[1:16:03] change he began to feel those Seven
[1:16:06] Locks and think of the
[1:16:08] possibility and he began to repent and
[1:16:10] say Lord Revenge my eyes let me let me
[1:16:14] die with my enemy
[1:16:17] tonight and that's what it takes with
[1:16:20] any Christian tonight that's right is
[1:16:24] that you have to die with your
[1:16:28] enemy are you willing to pay the price
[1:16:32] tonight Sams has said Lord let me die
[1:16:35] with my enemy that's the trouble they
[1:16:38] don't want to pay the price of
[1:16:41] dying the lead the the story of legion
[1:16:44] of Garda Gad I'm
[1:16:47] sorry when Jesus came came to him all
[1:16:52] those swine are or all those all those
[1:16:54] uh Devils went into those
[1:16:57] swine and those people's cost and their
[1:17:00] their living went and drowned themselves
[1:17:03] in the
[1:17:04] sea and they they they kicked Jesus out
[1:17:08] of town
[1:17:10] because the the Revival cost too
[1:17:14] much it was going to cost them a little
[1:17:17] something to have a Revival they felt
[1:17:19] more at home with the devil and the Hogs
[1:17:23] than they did with the lovely
[1:17:25] Jesus and it's going to cost you
[1:17:27] something whenever you give your whole
[1:17:28] heart to
[1:17:30] God you H you have to die to self-will
[1:17:33] you have to give yourself completely to
[1:17:35] the Lord Jesus just like he did in the
[1:17:37] garden of uh Gethsemane that's when the
[1:17:40] true death took place he said Lord not
[1:17:42] my will but thy will be done he forsook
[1:17:46] all of his sonship and became a sinner
[1:17:49] so we Sinners could become Sons amen
[1:17:52] amen you must die to
[1:17:55] self nevertheless not my will but thine
[1:17:58] will be done is that your prayer
[1:18:00] tonight and brother brandham also said
[1:18:03] the veil that was in the Holy place and
[1:18:06] to the most
[1:18:08] holies was
[1:18:10] self-will if you ever want to go into
[1:18:12] the presence of God you have to die to
[1:18:14] self God won't accept any other way
[1:18:17] that's
[1:18:19] right cuz he's not a mixer amen he's a
[1:18:22] separator right amen that's right yes
[1:18:25] but Samson prayed prayed right when he
[1:18:28] said Lord let me die with the
[1:18:32] Philistines he failed but let me die you
[1:18:36] must be ready to die with the Enemy
[1:18:39] that's got this victory over you you
[1:18:41] must be willing to surrender your own
[1:18:43] ideas Samson was willing to pay the
[1:18:46] price to get the power of God
[1:18:49] again his Fellowship was gone but there
[1:18:52] was a possibility that a prayer meeting
[1:18:55] might spark it again
[1:18:58] amen and I I was just wondering if there
[1:19:00] was anything in your life tonight
[1:19:02] anybody who's listening live stream is
[1:19:04] there anything in your life where the
[1:19:07] enemy just has you whipped has stripped
[1:19:09] your power your your eyesight making you
[1:19:12] walk in circles where you truly haven't
[1:19:15] surrendered your life to God but brother
[1:19:17] brandham said it starts with a prayer
[1:19:20] meeting he prayed the right prayer Lord
[1:19:22] Lord let me die with the
[1:19:27] Enemy and that little that little lad
[1:19:29] that was walking Samson around by the
[1:19:32] hand he said little boy let put place my
[1:19:36] hands on the post the
[1:19:39] pillars and that that that little boy
[1:19:42] types your conscience that conscience
[1:19:44] your
[1:19:46] conscience is always revealing to
[1:19:49] you what you're struggling
[1:19:51] with but just ask ask your conscience
[1:19:56] tonight place my hand on those posts
[1:19:58] those
[1:19:59] pillars let me die with the Enemy God
[1:20:03] searches through the Earth to find one
[1:20:05] man oh God when I think of that it makes
[1:20:07] my heart burn God is searching the Earth
[1:20:10] to try to find one man that'll surrender
[1:20:12] to him he's always done
[1:20:18] it but brother or um Samson just said
[1:20:22] once more Lord Revenge my eyes let me
[1:20:26] feel your your presence let me feel your
[1:20:30] power I feel your power Lord just once
[1:20:33] more renew my life fill me with your
[1:20:37] holy spirit let this enemy that's Mak me
[1:20:40] walk in circles for years any bitterness
[1:20:44] whatever it may be you know your
[1:20:45] conscience convicts you the word of God
[1:20:48] convicts you that's why it says it's
[1:20:51] sharper than any two-edged sword it cuts
[1:20:53] way deep down and exposes the
[1:20:58] enemy so if we could all just stand
[1:21:01] tonight and bow our
[1:21:03] heads as musicians would
[1:21:08] come I just pray that I I said something
[1:21:10] that was that struck your
[1:21:17] heart if you could just play something
[1:21:21] softly that's say bow our
[1:21:23] heads Heavenly Father Lord
[1:21:26] I I just pray father that there was

[1:21:59] greater way
[1:22:01] Lord reveal to me Lord what I have Lord
[1:22:04] that's hindering my walk with you
[1:22:08] Lord I pray my conscience would place my
[1:22:10] hand upon those
[1:22:12] posts that's holding up the
[1:22:17] enemy and when sson began to
[1:22:19] feel feel your power is his muscle begin
[1:22:23] to to press upon those posts as he was
[1:22:27] crying once more Lord Revenge my
[1:22:32] eyes and I just pray Lord

[1:28:39] you can use
[1:28:42] [Music]
[1:28:48] me I'm glad there's possibilities aren't
[1:28:51] you
[1:28:55] amen I'm just thinking it
[1:28:58] was I thoroughly enjoyed
[1:29:02] that enjoyed
[1:29:08] that amen very very clear very
[1:29:13] clear you know you get the thinking of
[1:29:18] Samson you know there's a lot of
[1:29:20] decisions that he made
[1:29:22] that when he stood there at that Mill
[1:29:26] grinding he had a lot of
[1:29:29] [Music]
[1:29:30] regrets but what was
[1:29:32] greater than the regrets and the
[1:29:37] condemnation was the predestinated plan
[1:29:40] of
[1:29:40] [Music]
[1:29:42] God because no matter where Samson was
[1:29:46] at he could not
[1:29:48] escape the plan and purpose of God for
[1:29:52] his
[1:29:54] life it was God who came and found him
[1:29:58] and while he was still walking around in
[1:30:00] a circle just like brother Brian brother
[1:30:03] Brian was quoting that tonight and begin
[1:30:06] to think about Jehovah is a god of
[1:30:11] love God began to visit him and in his
[1:30:16] mind he made a great decision to
[1:30:19] entertain the presence of God
[1:30:22] H and one little decision like that led
[1:30:26] from one thought to another thought to
[1:30:29] another thought to another thought to
[1:30:32] another
[1:30:34] thought that's just what brother Ram
[1:30:36] told us he said if you can go back in
[1:30:39] your mind first where you've fallen from
[1:30:44] then look to the Lord and repent and
[1:30:46] he'll take you back there in reality
[1:30:50] Hallelujah H that
[1:30:53] is I tell you this is how I believe this
[1:30:58] [Music]
[1:31:00] message that I believe that God's not
[1:31:02] just the god of Second
[1:31:04] Chances God is the god of chance after
[1:31:07] chance after chance and opportunity and
[1:31:13] [Music]
[1:31:15] opportunity because there's many through
[1:31:17] the scriptures there's many down through
[1:31:19] that we could look at that yes if we
[1:31:23] would just look at it you would think
[1:31:24] well there would be rode off but it just
[1:31:26] goes to show the depth of God's grace is
[1:31:28] so much greater than what you and I in
[1:31:30] our minds can e them
[1:31:32] fathom I'm glad he never gave up on
[1:31:36] me I'm
[1:31:39] glad I think what the Lord is I know
[1:31:42] what he spoke to us here
[1:31:44] tonight it's things were very very
[1:31:47] simple in that it's to evaluate our life
[1:31:52] if there's any if there's anything
[1:31:54] that's come along any trap that's got
[1:31:55] you going in a
[1:31:57] circle if you see things returning in
[1:31:59] your life the way it was before then you
[1:32:01] need to realize I need to get back in
[1:32:04] Step amen with God that's
[1:32:08] right because remember like the
[1:32:10] scriptures tells us when we're healed
[1:32:13] and we're delivered what did Jesus say
[1:32:16] and brother Brandon would repeat it over
[1:32:18] and over go and sin no more
[1:32:22] yes less to worse thing come on
[1:32:25] you because once God's presence has
[1:32:28] moved to bring release to bring
[1:32:30] deliverance keep walking with
[1:32:33] him but anything that gets out of step
[1:32:36] and when we get out of Step see God's
[1:32:38] faithful as a parent he's he's not like
[1:32:41] sometimes us we
[1:32:42] can our kids can kind of learn how to
[1:32:45] pull our strings a little bit here and
[1:32:46] there I don't care how how strict you
[1:32:49] are or how staunt they can kind of learn
[1:32:52] but God ain't like
[1:32:54] that God will he pulls back his presence
[1:32:58] and the way that he pulls back his
[1:32:59] presence is really it's not him leaving
[1:33:02] us it's us leaving
[1:33:04] him but you know what all it takes is
[1:33:06] just one moment one
[1:33:10] decision one moment right now to say
[1:33:13] Lord I want to go back to that reality
[1:33:16] and go
[1:33:18] on that's my desire
[1:33:22] you see Samson and and I'm not I'm not
[1:33:24] here to preach after it's just I could
[1:33:26] preach but there's just some points that
[1:33:28] I have wrote down here that just I
[1:33:30] thought about Samson Samson at that time
[1:33:33] you know he had become so dependent on
[1:33:35] the spirit of God he'd show up on
[1:33:38] Thursday come under the presence of God
[1:33:40] man how wonderful the presence of God is
[1:33:43] then he'd go right back out Sunday
[1:33:46] afternoon Monday Tuesday and he keep on
[1:33:48] going everything that he was already
[1:33:50] doing but he we got to counting on it
[1:33:53] was almost like a high he could walk in
[1:33:56] if he felt like it on Thursday or felt
[1:33:58] like it some other day he just come
[1:34:00] under it's almost like a high but he was
[1:34:02] under the spirit of God and it wasn't
[1:34:03] Samson that defeated those enemies but
[1:34:06] you know the greatest enemy that needed
[1:34:07] to be defeated was
[1:34:09] Samson right when God got all of
[1:34:14] Samson then he could destroy all the
[1:34:16] Philistines and I don't know about you
[1:34:18] but I just don't want to kill a
