forever aren't you glad it wasn't you or me who was chasing after God but God was following after you or I amen and what would draw us what would draw us to him would be him amen it would be him and so I'm thankful for his Mercy aren't you over and over David says it in the Book of Psalms over and over and over oh give thanks unto the Lord for his mercy endureth forever amen and forever is a space of time but I'm grateful that his Mercy has captured our lives in this time that we're living in aren't you amen amen we're just so thankful Amen to be gathered here this morning um I want to just uh make mention to you uh as we did last Sunday to be in continue in special prayer for brother joshu and sister Sharon there as they go for the interview there in the Congo for sister Sharon to be able to uh come here uh it's brother joshu's wife and you know they just had uh were married there in the latter part of February of this year and so she gets for goes for an interview and as we said that was a miracle in itself when they had pushed it out and said don't expect anything until 2025 but God said otherwise and so we want to remember them in prayer especially Wednesday November 22nd is when they go for that interview uh for that and so we just want to really be in prayer for that different needs among us as brother Brian they've already mentioned in the prayer request uh different ones that are sick among us and we want to continue to hold them up in prayer uh certainly want to say it's good to have different ones back with us brother Bobby and sister Michelle and and they certainly have been through a time and so we're grateful to have them and just want to continue to remember them in prayer as well and so good to have philli and his family here with us they're visitors with us but uh we want to welcome them in the name of the Lord amen so good to have them here with us and I had to had to ask him to forgive me I had to ask his name twice he didn't have a hard name but you know how it is with me uh I ask the person's name if I don't write it down right away it'll slip it has nothing to do whether anybody's important or not but I'm grateful amen that God knows our name aren't you amen and I tell you if I can only if I can if I have problems keeping track of a few names hey he knows the Stars by [Music] name he knows about us that's what's more important is't it that God knows about each of us the Bible said the hairs of our head are numbered that includes all the hair that have gone from mine still numbered God knows exactly I I'll get them back one of these days amen but it's good to be in the house of the Lord and so good to be with each of you and uh I want to just say um as we invite brother John Singer to come and to minister the word of the Lord I'm so thankful to have brother John and sister Rebecca uh his his lovely wife here with us so some of you would know probably some of you will know a little bit of the connection probably uh with those of you who know brother Russell Wallace who knows brother Russell Wallace if you're brave enough to raise your hand that you know him so brother Russell Wallace is his wife is Sister Rebecca's sister so that's wonderful we don't hold that against you sister Rebecca I'm just teasing I we we I love to tease with brother Russell but uh we just so love them and I appreciate brother John um brother John's Ministry and what the gift that God has placed in his life I know we're going to be blessed this morning because a gift it's to get ourselves out of the way and God has God is a god of a great bouquet he's a god of variety when you look Beyond in Revelations 5 it says here was a bride of many kindreds nations and tongues God takes his people from all diversity of life and even the gift that God places in our life they're all uniquely diverse one from another but that's purposeful that's purposeful God didn't have to do it that way but God did it that way because God's Not only displaying himself but he's showing his love to you or I and so we just want to welcome Amen Brother John sister Rebecca here with us this morning remember the service youth service tonight at 5:30 all are welcome um and so we just um want to just pull on the gift of God I believe God really has something special for us amen for certain God doesn't call us together to waste our time there's something he has to say so let's just pull on the gift of God brother John's been used the Lord has used him very instrumentally where I've seen is even among the young people but I know if how there's also the gift has been used across the board with all different age levels but I want want to say brother John we appreciate you being here this morning we love you and uh we want brother John to feel at home don't we amen and there's amen so could we sing that song brother Brian would you lead us just a Amazing Grace maybe that could we sing that where would I be see that lead us in that please as we invite brother John to come oh think about this where would I be Lord you only know where would I be you only know and I'm glad you see through high of BL a hopeless case and empty place if not for Grace where would I be oh you only know I'm glad you see through Eyes Of Love a hopeless case and empty place if not for Grace and Lord I Thank you for the things I can now see you were that shelter in the storms of life a shield surrounding me and I thank you for the mercy you Pro CU I know you could have walked away but you stayed a thousand times oh Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound I once was lost but now I'm found a hopess case and then place if not for Grace a hopeless case an empty place if not for [Music] gra amen good to be in the house of the Lord Lord and uh it's privilege to be here um I'm a very nervous person and uh the Lord knows my heart I'd rather sit next to my wife back there put my arm around her and listen to brother Samuel but uh that's not my my lot today so you pray for me how many will pray for me I appreciate that very much so there's uh just something about if somebody somebody ever text you and say I'm praying for you and that means the world to you when you're in a dire streets or you need help there's somebody on my side there's cheering for me and so I had quite a few people from home I spoke last week and um I told them ask them to pray for me and then you know what a bunch of them text me this morning and told me they were praying for me so I felt like I'm a winner even if I fail here I'm still a winner you know so we're we love you each one and uh it's good to feel loved anybody not like to be loved that that would be every one of us I'll I'll I I'm kind of tricky sometimes I'll say raise your hand but then don't raise your hand some other times so sometimes you don't want to raise your hand but how many to feel loved I it's nice to feel that you know you're I was talking to the Zach and Ben and brother Samuel and Sister Kim last night at the table there and I said you know people are a lot like dogs you know they can sense if you're scared of them they can sense if you like them and they can sense if you don't like them and so people are a lot like that I found you know you can sense if they like you or don't like you so I see your smiles every most of you I see a smile you know my wife I saw her just look at me I'm happy to have Rebecca here with me but she'll she you know how your wife will do little things to help you anybody don't raise your hand but but she'll she looked at me and she just went like smile John you're up there cuz sometimes I'll look I'll look kind of stern do you ever do that you know look kind of stern so you want to it's good to be it's good to be loved and it's good to be here thank you for your kindness um Hospitality makes you feel this big but uh real nice hotel you all put me up with your tithes and offerings uh put us Rebecca up in last night and then nice gift basket Sister Kim brother Samuel I brought there and thank you for that in the meal last night thank you for your kindness already I know you love me already and that's nice so thank you but um it's follow my lot to speak so uh if you'll take your Bibles we're going to turn to a scripture and take a text and then uh we're going to relax amen at least I'm going to try to you can too and if you need to catch up on some sleep that's okay I understand everybody anybody had a rough week don't raise your hand anybody had a rough week you know okay let sister you want yes we some of us did in a rough week but it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen we can kind of sit back and relax like a you know like I remember this one brother from Mexico came one time to our to one of the Farms there around us I don't know why this came to mind but I am who I am and so but he came to a farm there and we have a couple farmers in the church there are two big Dairy Farmers one milks uh 700 cows and the other one milks 100 cows and he went to the farm that milked 100 cows and there's a big milk tank in there and uh he said boy could you imagine being a kitty cat and just laying back in that milk you know like that floating in the milk you know so if you need to relax I understand so you just relax this morning I'm going to try to so if you take your Bibles and turn to 2 Timothy 2 and we're going to read verses 24 to 26 and then take a text out of uh 26 verse 26 and so I'll let you stand a little bit with me and uh I do I can tell already just by listening back there that you all uh believe in audience participation and I like that amen it helps me so this is 2 Timothy 2 and verses 24 to 26 we believe in audience participation right and the of the Lord must not but be gentle unto apt to patient in meekness instructing those that oppose if God per Adventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the trth and this is the verse I want to take a text from and that they may recover recover I love that word in my line of work you know you don't have to necessarily pray for somebody for them to be healed now just think about it for a second it says lay hands on the sick and they shall they're going to recover I'm not saying you're not praying for him when you lay hands on him but it's interesting that all you have that in you you have that virtue you have that Holy Spirit in you that you can give that out to everybody and even somebody you shook hands with or you know brother Tom greeted me at the door and I knew a little bit about him that he didn't know that he didn't know that I knew and I knew he had open heart surgery and so I just put my hand right there but you know what I was doing I was Lord you you be with his heart you know because you're laying hands on the people every day that they may recover and that they may recover themselves out of the of the who are taken captive by him at his will so I'm sorry I'm going to you're up here the front I'm going to ask you to help me a little bit what's your name Aaron thanks for being up front I appreciate it that's two of us up here now so so uh what would a snare be the what snare snare drum yes you got me yes that would be true that's not what we're going to talk about but that's good that's good I I love it I'll need you tonight up front here too so but a snare could be a snare drum but what's what's a snare a snare is a trap that they may recover themselves out of the Trap Of The Devil who are taken captive by him at his will so to me the devil would be a Trapper he would be a Trapper right okay let's just bow our head Heavenly Father Lord we have our hands up that would mean Lord that we are asking for mercy and surrender and we're asking you to come help us Lord we know that you know everyone that came through the door and you knew they would be here before the foundation of the world Lord you knew how many times they'd bat their eyes and how many hairs would be on their head and Lord you knew everything about them and now you've called us together on this Sunday morning to honor your resurrection and love you and Lord we're we want that love to be reciprocated back to us so we ask you to come down and be with the youngest little baby in here to the oldest person in here Lord and may you put your arms around them tell them you love them Lord rescue and recover any of us that need help out of any of the devil's traps Lord we want to be your prisoner Amen in bondage to you caged by you not caged by the devil so we ask you to come this morning Lord and you know we're nervous and you know we're not the best speaker here and so we just ask you to come and you to speak to each person here Lord we love you if there's anything we can do for you for the rest of the day Lord may you use our hands and our feet our mouths our lips our ears everything for your service and that's our desire we love you Lord in Jesus name amen you may be seated you thought I was going to have you standing there all day but um so brother brandham is it okay if I just talked to you a little bit brother BR how many love brother brandham you know he said all that ever loved you and would be there so I want to love him you you know I I need all the help I can get amen I don't know if anybody else is like that in here I need all the help I can get every day I need the Lord's help I need everybody around I mean my wife's help I need everybody's help but brother brandom said that his grandpa was a Trapper and that he was one of the greatest Trappers there was in that in that region and he said that his Grandpa would trap and he would trap Coons and he said you know brother brandham grew up very poor and I heard him say on on a tape this morning he wanted to die poor and he said he they would L uh be in a in a in a you know I'm going to say this is the loft there they were in but you couldn't look up and see a nice ceiling like this they could look through and see the stars and so when they slept at night they would drag a tarp over top of them and when they slept then they would get cold and they would call their mom in the morning and say Mom we can't see we got matter in our eyes and he said we need to grease and so they'd heat up some grease because his grandpa was a Trapper and he trapped Coons and he would get this grease they would heat it up and then they'd rub it in their eyes and he said it was a cure all around our house any to keep grease no you know maybe maybe that's what we need some more grease around you know but you know Bert call that brother brandham hunted with with the with the deer the two the two the the do and the and the mother the mother of the Fawn you know he was a great Trapper and a great hunter um brother Brandon wanted to be a Trapper and he said if it was up to him he he he would be a Trapper he'd get a gun and he'd go to the woods and be a Trapper but that wasn't his calling but brother B said he the first money he ever he ever made earned was 25 cents and he said he earned that by I Dro sweet potatoes and plants all day and got a quarter and I bought me a steel trap and caught a rabbit and sold the rabbit for 15 cents and bought me two more steel traps and started right off in the business and I was only about six years old anybody in here six anybody close to Six okay sister in the back there it's close to Six okay thank you so we uh he but he said I bought two more steel traps I sold the rabbit for 15 cents bought two more steel traps started off in the business I was about six years old I've been hunting and trapping ever since so I'd like to talk about trapping this morning I'm like John really at church yes I like talk about trapping and uh you know it's it's spefic specifically it's pretty much a lost hobby does anybody in here trap is we got well thank you brother what's your name David thank you that's great so anybody else a Trapper in here besides Brother David no so we got some novice Trappers in here so we got some novice people Brother David we're going to need to educate about trapping because it's pretty much a lost hobby Nobody Does it anymore do you still trap Brother David no no nobody does cuz the fur isn't worth anything anymore you know I tried trapping a couple times you you know I caught a skunk and uh yeah and and I caught the the farmers Doberman and so but I I let him loose I let him loose nobody was harmed but so I wasn't a very successful Trapper but the Devil is a very successful Trapper he he never he he never stops trapping you or trying to trap you through your entire life he will he is indiscriminate on who he traps and he doesn't care about your age location or where you are in life or your circumstance he is going to try to trap you that's his goal in life is to trap and trap you so he's tried to trap God's children throughout the ages and the first person he trapped was a lady and what was her name he trapped Eve causes her to doubt one word every time you hear an ambulance whale every time you hear you know a a farar go or see a funeral procession that is because God the devil trapped one lady with one word she doubted one word it's just how important it is to me to believe every word not doubt any of it but he trapped Eve and then he he went on and he kept he kept trapping people and you can you'll be like oh yeah I see that so he he trapped Eve then he trapped Sam he trapped Samson with Delilah right a woman that he used as a bait and then he then he trapped David again with what was that lady's name basba yeah and then he trapped he tried to trap Jesus okay and he trapped he he trapped Peter but there's no closed season on trapping so when brother Dave when we're trapping or when you when you trapped you had a set time where you could you could go and you could trap from let's say January 1st I'm making these up okay this is an Ohio law don't go out and do it so to January to February 30th or something like that because that when The Furs were the best and but you know the devil doesn't care from when you're born till the day you die he is going to try to trap you and entangle you in his traps there is no closed season so right now I'm just going to make a wild guess somebody in here is trying to get trapped you say in church John they trap in church yes he traps in church you said what what do you mean he's not you know he's trapping right now he's trying to catch your mind and take it somewhere else I know the pulpe is no place for jokes but there was a there was a guy at the back he was he was greeting the people the the minister he greet all the people and they came out the door and and the farmer came out and he said well thank you he said that was a great message Pastor I got my tractor fixed so where was his mind during the sermon it was fixing his tractor because the devil trapped him and took his mind somewhere else so he's going to take your mind today to what you're going to do this week what you did last week what you're going to do the rest of today or how long is this guy going to speak and is this really going to be worth my time to even listen to him he's going to take you and he's going to trap you he's going to try trapping you like that so I I put quotes up here this is just me because in in my line of work I try to I try to get in people's wheelhouse a little bit and I try to see where they're at and and then if I can grab them with a couple senses like maybe C and maybe even smell sometimes and hear then I have them I have all their attention I can't probably get your taste but I can so I put quotes up here um and I I it helps me too it takes some of the pressure off of me so brother bam here is talking about this is off of Hebrews chapter 6 he said he that's born of God does not commit sin that's right he has no desire to do so amen because a desire to do so is taken out of us when we become a Christian brother B said I smoke as much as I want to smoke I drink as much as I want to drink I lust as much as I want to because I don't have a want to anymore certainly the devil will trap him here and there but not willfully now you if you just want to just go through and you know this is what I I love you know about these apps they come out with you know I can put in trap and there's oodles on trap and you just go in start look tra trapping trapped and just start going through those and he says certainly the devil will trap him here and there but not willfully the Bible said so the devil will trap him now and then sure he will he tried to throw traps for our lord Jesus and he did to Moses and caught him and he did to Peter and caught him he did to many but Peter even denied him but then when he went and wept bitterly there was something in him but brother Bram said we each have a weak point every of us have a weak link and we're only as strong as our weakest link so I'll I'll I'll have some demonstrations today but I had a I had this at Camp one year I took I took all these uh Links of a chain that were very strong chain I had a boy up here and had him pulling up another boy and you know or lifting and trying to pull it apart and then I put dental floss between one link of the chain you got the picture and so that was the weak link but brother bam said that Jesus had a had a weak spot it was hunger and that's where Satan came to him in the wilderness and he said Moses had a weak spot and that was his temper but wherever your weak spot is that is where the devil is going to try to trap you and and you each one right now know where your weak spot is you know what you need to keep covered and what you can't let get exposed to the devil because he's going to trap you with it okay so you got to keep that weak spot covered this next one is you know the we're we're the devil's out to trap us every one of us this age more than any other he has got more traps and more devices to trap us but now the cunningness of the devil now makes the people believe they are Christians when they're not this is one trick he does constantly there is the thing you don't have when when they're not there is the thing you don't have to seal it's you don't have to seal it's it's more cunning to day than it wouldn't be then when you had to seal your life away with your testimony now think about it you had to say I'm I'm willing to die but it's more cunning than that day the devil has set every cunning trap he can to he's a deceiver that G and Jesus told us in Matthew 24 how this day would be that we're living in the most deceitful day that ever lived so close that it would deceive the very elected of God if it were possible for him to deceive so this next one I'm I'm he's talking about the devil kind of goes back to the weak point where the devil is looking at your weak points how many believes he knows you some of us even posted on Instagram where your weak spot would be so it's exposed not just to the devil but the whole world where you're weak spot is and we put that out there likes in our dislikes and who we follow and but now if you make a mistake and do something wrong you don't willfully if you're a Christian if you're born again Christian you don't mean to do wrong your intentions and everything is right but if you do as she said to her she make make a mistake and something wrong well God will put it will let just go and go on and die like that and be lost or will he bring back to reconciliation he will bring you back that's right he will bring you back and if and then if you do anything wrong it don't condemn you and you go on like and you go on like that out remember you wasn't saved in the beginning so I'm just saying you know you do a checkup every every time you come to church you do a checkup you might say no I only do that one time a year I go to the doctor and he gives a physical exam no every time to come you come to church you have a checkup and the Lord looks in your ears and he sees what you're hearing and he look looks in your eyes and sees what you're seeing and he looks in your mouth and sees what you're saying and he looks in your heart and sees what it's thinking every time you come to church so then he says if you do anything wrong it don't condemn you and you go on like that and remember you wasn't saved at the beginning so I check my desires when I come to church did I really want to be here did I really when I cut that person off or when I said this or did that did that come from my heart or was that just not willfully done you wasn't saved at the beginning that's right you wasn't wasn't saved you had a make belief you wasn't saved but when you're saved you have a different Spirit you're a different nature you're a new creature in Christ and the old things has passed away and they are dead and buried in the sea of forgetfulness you see but being you're living here in the world there's traps set for you everywhere and you're walking with your eyes on yourself this is why I put them up here you're walking with your eyes on Christ and remember that when you make a mistake a real Christian will always come back quickly for reconciliation so when I'm doing my checkup I look at my life and when I say something that's wrong or hurtful to my wife if you've done that raise your hand don't raise your hand David don't raise your hand put your arm around her don't raise your hand you come back quickly for reconciliation that's how I check my heart do I quickly want to repent and make it right or do I want to go on like everything's fine that's part of the checkup I know there's some Spanish folks in here and about 75% of my patients are Spanish so I'll I'll go in there AA Saka La lingua you know esal laaba you know I'll say all those things and you knowa you know I usually end with dios leenda or I'll say no my my word I learned for this week was no prees you know no worries no worries but when I when I come in and I can just do a little bit of that right there I got them you know they'll talk to me and think I know a little bit more Spanish than I do because then they'll go on and I'll be like who whoa whoa whoa you know but when we come in we want to do a checkup each time so we're looking for our weak link we're looking for our weak spot and we're looking where is the devil going to try to trap us because we want to stay under the shelter of his protection and keep our eyes on him okay that's the short version if you want to go to sleep you can you know so this is where people want to go sleep they can but I um so what I'm going to do here is you know I I got to I I do this for the kids and then if I can hold you when you're five if I can hold your uh attention when you're five then I can probably hold you when you're 85 and so this is what I do at camp and so this is where I get to let my hair down a little bit and I I get to relax and so you just bear with me if if you don't want to listen that's okay give me a second here I got to get out my I think so so how many believe the devil tries to trap us okay okay so we going to get out of G to get out one trap here first so this would be a right right right we we're trying to catch muskrats with this mice H Aaron right this is a trap this is a snare it's not that thing over there so thanks for helping me out I owe you afterwards so this trap though is set for maybe a little guy right little girl little boy I just feel lead led to go here right now so I I do well child checks on children so the first thing I ask him Zach is uh they get in there with their their mom or their aunt or whoever's with them today and I say uh when's your mom's birthday Aaron if you don't know don't say it now but that's the first thing I ask them because that's a very important day that's the person that carried you for nine months how many believe that babies can hear in the womb oh yeah how do I know that because a baby that was dead when the name of Jesus was spoke leaped in the womb I kind of was thinking about that around you know just Christmas last year I think it was wonderful you know so it's so important the environment you're in as you're pregnant you don't pay for some of these things but I'm just going to throw them in there but you know but I ask them you know when's your mom's birthday and I memorized it yesterday so if you don't know Zach I got you go ahead when's your mom's birthday don't give the year don't give the Year this is a this the the day and the month yeah is that right s Kim yeah 0508 okay Erin do you know your mom's birthday you do go ahead was your mom in here no she's not okay when is when is your mom's birthday you don't have to give the year don't give the year don't give the year you know I'm glad she's not here you be in trouble later but you know it's it's that's good but that's just one thing I ask him you know just but you know this the Trap is for little kids right roadblocks what's robloxs don't raise your hand how many kids in here play Roblox how many adults do okay so tell me what Roblox is what's your name in the back there Jacob what's roblock you got to give him a mic it's it's a game that kids play this is where you're if you're 80 85 you're getting educated so this is a game kids play and go ahead different types of game it's a virtual reality game right can't you like buy different characters and okay the average user spends 2.6 hours on this game largest age group is 9 to 12 67% of the users are under 16 56 million people a day log on to this and 56 read their Bible I made that one up that would be a trap for little guys and it's made specifically for you Jacob or the little girl with her daddy's arm around her or you girls that are sitting right here it's made for you that is the devil's trap and I'm not saying Roblox is horrible I've never played the game but what I'm saying is that if you spend all your time on it it's a trap and it's going to trap you and it's going to continue to trap you until it got you and your mind is filled with things that shouldn't be filled with so fortnite's another one that's probably more popular kids play fortnite spend a lot of their time on it this is where you want want to stay under the shelter of the protection of your parents and where they're going to help you avoid traps that the devil set for you I got on there last night and I was just looking it said how do you know if your child is addicted to Roblox one of the things they said if they get mad when you ask them to get off and I make this statement at work if you want to make a child mad take away their phone do you want to make an adult mad we're doing a kind of a physical exam here head to toe and we're just looking at where we're at am I standing up here because I am not ever going to be trapped or have never been trapped no I'm just up here and I say this a lot more recently that I'm up here just talking to myself and you get to listen teens spend an average of 4.8 hours on social media per day 4.8 hours social media Instagram Tik Tock YouTube shorts whatever you want flavor that's where it is 4.8 hours Rebecca my wife is very good at reading her Bible through she will spend she's she actually is a witness to me because she'll spend two hours every morning reading her Bible and she's almost done for the year if we would spend 4.6 hours we'd probably finish in about six months or less I challenge you we're getting near the end of the year read your Bible through am I getting through I'm going to try to make it through the New Testament so John you're so busy are you available to God or is the devil trying to trap you so he used before you can trap somebody can you get that thing yeah so I'm gonna I'm going to show a couple other couple other ones here so this is called a uh this would be called the conab bear trap right David and this one would be used to trap muskrats but you can trap Beaver with it you can trap different animals with this conab bear trap and what how this one works is and I I I I was going to try to set it and I thought well I didn't want anybody lose their arm so I I did this at Camp I did set this so you you um you actually this one here needs to be out here so it's good I'm not trying to set it but you you bring these arms down and then you open up the Trap like this like a box and then the animal it's an underwater set for the most part you're trying to catch a muskrat and the Muskrat swims through here and hits this little bitty bump thing which is the trigger and you can spread this out so it catches more so he a little muskrat couldn't get through there but the minute it hits that it then collapses these hard Springs and this would be a lethal trap for the Muskrat does the devil have lethal traps he does he has lethal traps that he sets and so sometimes I'll ask kids I'll just go through this and you know I'll say to them and maybe I'll repeat this tonight so if you're going to be here tonight you'll hear it I'll say you know what happens if you smoke Aaron okay good that would be a lethal trap but it doesn't we don't tell you it's a lethal trap right away do we no okay what happens if you drink alcohol you die very good very good so you're getting the idea you don't go down liver and then all this and your liver enzymes go up and you turn yellow and you become addicted and all that actually just dump that in there so then what happens if you use drugs you die those would all be lethal traps conar traps if you will that the devil's going to set for you and try to get you so each one of us I remember when I was I'll just give this I was 13 12 13 I'm I might have been younger I probably was I probably was 10 11 and uh there was a boy that was not a good influence uh that was in the neighborhood he lived up the street his name was Lindsay and he um his dad smoked and he brought some cigarettes and said John do you want to smoke and I can tell you where I was and what I did cuz sometimes when you when you get caught in a trap you know exactly what path you were on when you were caught okay so some of us are going on some trips here in our minds of when we were caught at whatever age it may be I can remember going in the church where we have our church today we I lived in a parsonage and it was right above the church and so we waited for the bus at the firehouse I remember a red and white fire engine that we could stand in there now you probably couldn't stand in there we stood in there and he had the cigarettes hid and after we got off the bus we went up on the mountain the hill behind the church there and I tried to smoke and uh I felt this Trap closing so you know what I you know just a mercy of how many love the Lord's kindness oh he's so kind he's so kind even when we're not kind he's kind and so the Lord I I was under such conviction that I went to uh I went to my parents' bedroom that night and I said Dad Mom I said my dad I said I I tried to smoke and my dad you know just wisdom he got down with me and we prayed by that bed and I've never been bothered by it again but did I avoid a lethal trap was that path right there in my life where I was walking now each of you know you can see the Lord's kindness in your life or you would not be sitting here today that's kindness that's he recovered you from the trap From The Snare so I'll ask kids some other questions too I might do some of that tonight you know but I ask them questions but really the end and the end was death that's a lethal trap so what do you got to have first well number one where do you set a trap Brother David where do you set your traps just anywhere right so you pattern the animal right you kind of pattern you look at the environment they're living in and you look where where they might walk in a path they might walk on or a slide you're saying where they SL where they you know more than me muskrats and mink go after muskrats and so he's going to meet you right where you are and try to trap you he's not going to try to trap you with one of these you know and is he going to try to trap trap me with cigarettes no he's going to well joh didn't work on John I'm going to try a different tactic to get him you know what happens if you follow a duck Aaron think like a duck here think like a duck okay what happens if you follow a duck they'll lead you to the water okay okay what is your name yeah little blond her yeah Addie what happens if you follow a bear yeah could you be eaten by the bear Poss possibly okay what happens if you well let's just say you see a a uh I'm going to just throw this in there for you but if you see a boy and he walks like a turkey and he acts like a turkey and he gobbles like a turkey what is he turkey very good just remember that that's your dad didn't pay me but that's just I'm just going to lay that out there but if you follow a duck you'll probably end up in the water if you hang around people that smoke you're probably going to end up smoking so how you pick your friends is how you pick your future you pick good friends you pick a good future you pick bad friends you pick a bad future but it's who you follow I don't have my phone on me but it's who you follow so Instagram how many have 10 followers Jesus had 12 I'm gonna give more I'm one of his followers too each one of you are too be careful who you follow somebody shared with me something last week after church and said you know the devil doesn't matter how old you are they were following this person for some helpful homemaking hints or something I don't know nobody in here does that I know you don't F no sisters don't raise your hand you know you followed somebody but you know that person she said Devol this week that she's a practicing witch and she said I was following her can you say trap so be careful who you're following because you may end up in the same trap so but that next quote up there brother BR says and he joined himself a citizen of the country and the citizen give him two big slop buckets to go slop the Hogs think of the place a Jewish boy out there slopping hogs in the pig pen away from mother away from religion that he once had to keep from the Hogs now he was rooting that's the way the devil will do he'll get you to smoke your first cigarette telling you there's no harm in it you know I'm just going to stop because I think we should give God the glory you know I've helped a lot of people the Lord has helped me help a lot of people stop smoking and I have a bell in my office that I let them ring when they stop smoking they come out they ring the bell and we shout you say shout yeah I do I shout woo they stop smoking brother bam said it's a nicotine demon that's right let's call it what it is that's the way the devil will do he get you to smoke your first cigarette telling you there's no harm in and after a while you're a cigarette fiend he'll tell you there's no harm in taking sociable sociable drink I've stood them before they went to Gallows stood them stood by them before they was electrocuted and never and I never intended they say to be a gambler I never intended when I was playing cards to be a gambler I never intended to be a drunk when I stole the first out of a filling station I didn't intend to be a thief but the only thing the devil wants you to do is start and he'll take you on be careful who you're following get over on his ground one time and watch him you know what it means to do wrong but there's an influence of the power of Darkness you could preach on this for a long time there's let's nail it down one two things are pulling you there's the power of the above world and the power of the underworld so when you look at a game or you look at Instagram or anything which world is pulling you we're doing a checkup the prince of the power of the air leads you trapped leads you trapped into these things you've got to stand up separate yourself from the things of the world come out and live for Christ that's right so you know the the first thing he'll do back up one second here because I I think I missed a spot here you forgive me yep so he's gonna brother Dave did you ever put a bait out never baited would it look like this yeah yeah I got this one for you so yeah so this is it here so this is this is called a this is called a leg hold trap right pretty pretty you know pretty pretty common trap and they'll have different sizes so you'll put your feet on both sides of it like that you'll bring it flip this trigger finger over you'll bring that over like that how did John lose his finger during that service well how did he get his tie in it and we got it set Paul can you bring that forward so we got this one set right and so all the animal has to do is put his foot right where I'm going to lift this up CU it's not going to get me when I do that but he had to put his foot right there right and then what happens actually that bag shouldn't be in there Paul you know Paul you're so kind but so know the devil's not going to say okay so we're going to try something here hold on okay so we got the Trap set there right so where don't you want to put your foot in the middle right cuz it would trap your erand what would it trap your leg well your soul yeah so I'm gonna put this on the side here but he's not going to make he's not gonna say hello I'm G to trap you with cigarettes today I'm going to track you trap you with a couple things I'm going to flash up on your phone today I'm going to trap you with a neighbor lady not wearing the right clothes I'm going to trap you with wearing shorter dresses high heel shoes makeup you name the sin you name the the symptom he's going to try to trap but he's not going to make it obvious so he's not going to say you know when you're trapping Brother David you don't just sit down there and say okay we're going to try to get the coyote today he's going to come down this path we're going to get you buddy we're going to take your fur off you just you step in that thing right there how many coyote are going to do that come on now but what is what is he going to do he's going to take his trap go ahead Paul bring it here so he's going to take his trap and he's going to hide the Trap do you think when David looked out the window he thought he was going to be trapped when basba kept up the shades do you think she thought that she was going to be bait I thought this Leaf when I was walking down from the goats the other day yesterday morning actually and I thought I'm going to bring that leaf with me I don't know why I'll use it but that's a beautiful Leaf isn't it it's my thoughts but so show them the Trap Paul don't shake it around just show them the Trap so how where's the Trap it's hid why is it hid because the devil ain't going to tell you okay so I'm going to go on another one that when you get a complex and say I'm not going to go to church anymore nobody likes me everybody hates me I'm just gonna you know he's not going to come right out and say you know what I'm the devil I'm here to trap you but we're going to expose him today for what he is Old slewfoot Trapper trying to catch you you so when this so we won't snap this cuz dirt will fly everywhere I've did this at Camp I know this for a fact but I really don't so Paul maybe we'll leave it like that but shall we leave it like that you think we should I don't want to you don't think it'll fly so when the devil maybe that's what this leaves for so if we if I put it here so we've got the foot are there scars when you get in traps are there scars in your life when you get in traps how many know what I'm talking about I'm glad for a God that's big he don't make no mistakes even when we're trapped not by our own will he makes perpetuation for our sins I'm thankful for that I'm so thankful for that Paul thank you so you know those traps though you gotta he'll put those that bait out there and that's snapped already so I don't think you'll get caught but he'll put those bait out there and try to trap you every day day of your life brother and he's going to set that trap right in the path that you walk every day David had looked out that window many many many times so he caught balum with another trap the brother said these things get ministers but he said get all men so he said was women was Samson and he said it was popularity or you know a big name or fame or whatever you want to call it he got Saul and then he said he got balum with money but the be devil uses people as bait sometimes many this is off of oh Lord just once more many of them them in that drunken bra could remember that of Samson but what was the matter today he didn't there stood Samson but the spirit of the Lord didn't come on him no more he wasn't anointed he had been stripped of his power by a woman that lured him away from the Commandments of the Lord so he's going to strip you of your your power when he traps you so when when I don't have I have it I have I don't have it on this one but the Trap he just took out there is a little bitty like steak and on that steak is a chain and it goes to the Trap so you can think you're free but he's still got you in his jaws and you can go in a circle and keep going in that Circle or you can chew off your your leg and go free but you'll always limp you know this next quote brother random says he's talking about people and he says it's be it's because they have been caged by circumstances radio television uncensored programs love stories and things of that sort it's captured the mind mind of the people and they become bondslaves to modern society when they was born to be Sons and Daughters of God I went into an insane institution one time and seen young ladies certain one had used a bed pan washed her face in it I said whatever happened she was called into the service of God but she got messed up some boy come along a little Slicker and throwed her into a cage of worldliness and there she was captured and lost her mind her mental faculties and was in an institution a few days ago standing with another local minister in a home where a lovely little girl a doctor's daughter who' been spent nearly a lot of her life early all of her life until she was 30 or 35 years old a beautiful girl and her mother called me and was weeping and it was a lovely girl and to see that some Modern skeptic scientist got a hold of that lovely child and said you mean to tell me you was never kissed by a boy that's you got to identify it it's the power of the underworld that would be that in that scientist that would be convincing that girl that she was wrong if she's never been kissed by a boy you don't know what you've missed and begun to place her mind on thinking of those things and caged that precious eagle and her dear old mother on the porch shook my hand and said by God's grace she shall be delivered and she will but to find that eagle of God who soared the Unseen Skies could be caught in such a trap the city is full of them today I want you to take you over to one other scripture because I just think it's a good one to memorize because our minds now are being taken and captured by the devil and we're being trapped in our minds you say well those other sins don't bother me cigarettes smoking and you know wearing pants as a as a sister that that doesn't bother me but he's capturing us in our minds and we're going places on our phones where he's capturing us and trapping us and he doesn't care how he traps you as long as he's got you so this is Philippians 4:8 it's a very familiar scrip scripture it's common you've you've heard it many times I'm sure your pastors come up here and said John or or or quoted this scripture it says finally my brethren whatsoever things are whatsoever things are whatsoever things are whatsoever things are whatsoever things are whatsoever things are of if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things so you know there was a person I'd like to show you one other trap that's probably the worst trap there is out there okay because a you don't know you're trapped because this would be I think it says in the Box have a heart so this would be called Brother David what kind of a trap a live trap H not a death not a dead trap not a lethal trap but it would be a live trap H if you looked out of this trap could you think you're free could you think it you know or would you be captured by him and taken where he wants at his will read our scripture again it said and they that and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will so this trap here just for education purposes would be would be you would set it like this and you look in through there you put a bait back in here corn hamburger french fries whatever you want to put back there peanut butter the animal would walk in he'd step on this trap thing here and then you would take him to some unknowing Farmers field where he would have thousands of groundhogs anybody in here ever done that no we got sisters don't raise your hands on these but you did you take the groundhog where he didn't want to go further than he wanted to be away from his family alienated him poor groundhog no that's what the devil's going to do to you he'll put you in this live trap and he'll take you farther than you want to go to a place you've never been before and then you wake up and wonder how did I ever get here in a live trap Joseph in the Bible was an amazing man you know why because he didn't allow his circumstances of his life to trap him in his mind or in his body he was a prisoner of Jesus Christ sold by your brothers into slavery could you have hate could that put you in a trap of hate yeah yeah sure it could could you could you could it give you a complex nobody loves me everybody hates me yeah my brothers my own Brothers put me in a put me in a hole in the ground and sold me into slavery and where I didn't want to go then he was accused falsely with Piper's wife that was a trap he knew that was a lethal one didn't he he he knew that was a lethal trap because he knew it would lead to death so he got out of it left his coat and ran Aaron right if a girl looks like a wolf and sounds like a wolf and has fangs like a wolf she's probably a very good you don't have to pay for those but hopefully you'll remember him cuz he's seeking whom he may Joseph then could he have gotten a more of a just depression could he have anybody in here don't raise your hands ever been depressed you're accused of raping a woman or whatever and you're thrown into prison and it wasn't like the the county prison here and it wasn't like the Hilton or wherever else those other prisons are around here it was the dirtiest of Prisons they didn't care there was no social media for them to post what the prison conditions were like and then he actually discerned the Baker and the Butler and then they didn't let him go they forgot about him nobody loves me did he let those circumstances of his family cage him did he let the circumstances of his prison cage him no he refused the cage he refused to be caged by the Devil by his own thoughts or by his depression anxiety Suicidal Thoughts homicidal thoughts he didn't allow that to cage him he refused the cage cage I am free he was not a bond slave to sin so you know we we're going to be this cage is the devil's going to put a bait out here or a box that he's going to try to trap you with so there was a my son lost his phone he was working at a farm and he lost it in this big pile of feed and corn and he had an and so it thousands of you know bushels of corn and he couldn't find it so he had an insurance policy on his phone so Lincoln came home we ordered him a new phone I think it was still going to cost us some money and and so then he went back and the farmer a really nice man great family that we good friends and they he found the phone and so we had already ordered the phone so a UPS man shows up at our house with a phone and I was kind of watching for him because I wanted to refuse the delivery so as he I hear the truck come because we have a dog that barks and so she's barking up a storm and I I run down there and I I I run out to the front front porch and I yell down I said the guy yells back as he's jumping on the truck he's I left it under the tree he was afraid to come up because of the dog and so and I yell back I don't want it and I run back down and he made me sign a paper refused delivery now brother B talks about this many times the box of rattlesnakes but when depression Comes Your Way refuse the cage refuse the delivery when the complex of nobody likes me anxiety depression whatever it is is the family I'm born into the whatever refuse the cage even if it's sickness my backs bother me today it's not I can't see quite like I used to whatever that is whatever it is I am the Lord that Health just some of the bad diseases I am the Lord that Health all everything refuse the cage of sickness refuse the cage of complexes refuse all the cages and be free so there was uh you know brother bam says on a one quote he says now one day the human race was in a trap but then we had a great deliverer come so how do people get out of this trap how do you get people out of this trap how do you get people out of that leg hold trap somebody's got to step on the Trap and release you when you sisters took this groundhog to the farm Somebody went like that and left him go free and that was the Lord Jesus for you and me it was a dual covenant it was the double cure it was a sure cure it not only your sins but your sickness that blood is there for our sins and our sickness so that we don't have to be caged so if they'll come to the instruments I want to just end with one story that brother brandham told and I didn't get to really my points if you if you are in a trap you know we talked about getting free you know how to get free from a trap brother B says here this is the quotes up there he says he says the Lamb's Book of Life he says there's traps all along the road sure the devil will cause you to stumble and you say I didn't mean to do that when I hear Brother B say something like that that's the first thing I went out of my mouth if I get caught in a trap I didn't mean to do that Lord another one he says here he says the devil got a trap setting there but you got Grace to come back if you're a real Christian say I was wrong if you'll go to the last quote this is one of my favorite quotes it's just it's the very last one that's the one that says I was wrong go to the last one how many you know sometimes ignorantly you'll you'll fall in a trap you'll find yourself in a situation brother B said how could could we how we could go into details and that and break that down of how that it makes intercession for our ignorance this is what I love sometimes we got the Holy Ghost we ignorantly stagger some sometime something the holy spirit's there to make advocate for us he's our advocator he stands there he's our attorney he stands there and pleads for us we don't plead for oursel because the Holy Ghost is in US pleads for us the Holy Spirit giving utterance sometimes with words that you can't understand he makes intercession for us that's what the Holy Ghost is when I walk into anything I walk like a little kid you walk like a little fellow when you're walking in a dark world full of enemies full of sin full of traps full of everything you say I'm afraid I'm afraid to take Christian Life I'm afraid to do this I'm afraid I'll do this don't be afraid we have an advocate amen oh he stands by us he's in us he makes intercession for us and the Holy Spirit constantly constantly making advocate for us all the time so that they'll come to the instruments I want to tell One More Story that brother brandham told not too far from here he told about the eagle in the Cincinnati Zoo he said that eagle was caged by men and put there and he was beat in his head on the cage so that it was blood and bl bloody and blood was running down and he said then he would roll back his eyes and look at the heavenlies where he was made to fly he also talks about the eagle that was born in the chicken yard you may say well I'm caged by my family by my circumstances there's a bunch of chickens around me he said just jump and get on the post and then he said jump a little bit higher and go free but but that bird that was caged he said there's a worse sight he said it's sons and daughters that were made to be free Daughters of God and they're caged by sin and then he makes a statement 1960 says as Eagle stth he said give me Eagle thoughts give me Eagle desires give me Eagle life that's what I want I don't want to be caged I don't want to be in a live cage I don't want to be in a death cage I don't want to be in a leg old trap I Want to Be Free how many want to be free I want to be free I want to fly the heavenlies I want to have Eagle desires I want to have an eagle thoughts I want to have an eagle life I don't want to be trapped let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father father we kind of chopped up Lord our thoughts and we believe the people got the message Lord that in you we're free no matter what kind of trap the devil's put us in that cage in our mind or on our leg or on our lungs or whatever part of our body he's tried to trap us Lord our eyes our ears if we're listening to the wrong music Lord whatever it is we believe you came to set us free Lord reminds me of one other story about Johnny Crow and the crows would fly south and say fly with us Johnny come South and he said I can't I'm trapped I'm tied up here to this but then one day kind farmer came and released the the string but you know what he didn't know he was free so he kept on going in that same Circle not knowing that he was free Lord we're so happy happy that you sent us a prophet in our day to tell us about you Lord and how you came to make us prisoners of you we don't want to be prisoners of Satan we want to believe every word we don't want to be trapped like Eve where we would doubt your word we don't want to be trapped like Samson Lord with a woman we don't want to be trapped like balum with money or like Joseph Lord he wasn't trapped by his circumstances Lord he was free to serve you as a son of God we love you Lord Lord we stand before us Lord before you asking you to put the foot on the devil's neck Lord and open up that trap for everyone in here from the youngest to the oldest Lord if they're trapped by anything whether it be something in their mind a thought the devil would plant there we want to think on these things or if it would be sickness Lord we know that you came to overcome come everything and by your stripes we are healed we love you Lord we're so thankful that you set us free and we're so thankful Lord that your kindness to us that when we do fall into a trap that you've given us a heart that wants quick reconciliation to say I'm sorry I was wrong Lord humble us Lord help us to say quickly and go the other way say sorry Lord or whatever it would need to be may we go to those that we've harmed or said anything wrong Lord we don't want to be in a trap Lord of bitterness or hate anything like that Lord we want love in our hearts for everyone so we pray you'd come and make yourself known to us Lord thank you for your kindness once again to bless us with your presence Lord may you make us watch wise as serpents and harmless as doves in the age we live in Lord the most deceitful of all ages Lord if I've said anything that was wrong may you forgive me and just Bless the people Lord as they as they go Lord help us to be War of the devil and his traps and not be taken by him Lord we want to be taken by you make us ready for your rapture Lord we love you father in Jesus name amen do you know the healer is here I like this song this is one of my favorite songs it's called the healer is here you know that one so if you if you're trapped by sickness he's here if you're trapped in your mind by a complex he's here if you got another trap if you got your phone's trapping you your something's trapping your time he's here here amen yeah it's just yeah it's just it's a real simple chorus I probably shouldn't do this but I will I'll try to sing it Rebecca will get on me later the healer is here Jesus the healer is here raising the causing the blind man to see again the healer is here Jesus the healer is here ask what you will for the healer is here just a chorus the healer is here Jesus the healer is here ask what you will for the healer is here the healer is here Jesus the healer is here ask what you will for the Healer is [Music] here you had another one up [Music] there you can lock me up in a prison and throw away the king as I oh Jus and I could still go free oh that I could still go free tell me what kind of man would reach down his hand and do this for [Music] me and soe So Unworthy to live and not F to kill but the man on the cross has my name is is well he said that I still go free thank you Lord oh now I never [Music] good understand why a king could be his throne to down the RO [Music] of feel the pain and [Music] thees TR that that lead to [Applause] C where those blood red stain BR all things change that I could still go oh he I could still go free tell me kind of man would reach down his hand and do this for me [Music] yes So Unworthy to live and not F you kill but the man on the cross had my name in is Will he said he said that I could still go free but the man on the cross my name in his will he said that I still go free [Music] [Music] when I think about being free there's a gentleman in our church Brother Sam and he's a Korean War veteran and his birthday I think's today he's 90 we took him one time down to the Washington DC Korean memorial and there's a a bunch of soldiers there like statues but they have a wall there and on that wall it says freedom is not free because Brother Sam gave the best years of his life as a marine so that I can be free today worship like I want to in America nobody can tell me that I can't believe in a prophet nobody can tell me how I have to live except the Lord Jesus that freedom is not free Brother Sam gave the best years of his life but it is free if I'll accept it from the Lord Jesus Hallelujah so if you want to be free today and you say well you know what I don't think I can oh that freedom that was paid by the blood on Calvary Hallelujah you might say I got a sickness that was paid as well by the stripes a Roman soldier put on his back it's free but it wasn't free cuz a son gave his life for me I'm so thankful for that aren't you I'm thankful for Freedom my American freedom but I'm thankful for my spiritual Freedom cuz I know when I leave this world they'll put me in a in in the dirt if I don't see the Rapture but one day I'll go free you want that insurance and you've never given your heart to the Lord there's no better day to go free if there's even the little I do a thing I shouldn't tell I do a little thing when I call I have all these kids with calls up here all to get them duck calls Goose calls deer calls elk calls raccoon calls all to tell them God is calling you he went throughout the garden and he said Adam where are you we didn't go through the garden saying Where's God but he's calling you if he's knocking at your door all you have to do is open who controls the door who controls the door do we do we are on the inside we can push it open and let him in I want him in I want him in every room don't you let's just bow our heads once again Lord Jesus we're so thankful that you called us we open the door to you Lord sometimes we not willfully but we'll be trapped Lord but you've sprung every trap may you make the way before us as it we're lion minds or anything in front of us Lord just cause them to be obliterated Lord help us to stay under the protection of your wings help us to think Eagle thoughts Eagle desires and live an eagle life Lord Fly Above the world in the chicken Barnard and all the manure we want to live above that help us to do that Lord we pray we love you father each one in Jesus name amen thank you for your kindness brother Samuel if you'll come [Music] have to be careful you don't want to step in a trap how many enjoyed the word of the Lord you know the one thing about it as brother John was speaking expressing there even at the end it doesn't matter how long that you've been in that trap what's important is that when you recognize that you're in a trap recognize that it's God who's made you aware of the Trap you're in and that his grace is [Music] sufficient you realize that even when brother Bram talked about that complex that he had formed brother Bram himself he couldn't get himself out of that but he first I recognized it God helped him to see because without the Lord you or I can't see the traps we can't even recognize sometimes the Trap that we're in it's true as brother John was saying we can smoking drinking some of those things we could set and it's very those could be seemingly obvious in the sense where you would be in your walk with God but remember the only reason that's obvious to you now is because where God's Grace has brought you to and so Satan never stops he studies brother Bram said it like this in the message the contest he studies us now you think if there were people years ago probably over 12 years ago when talking with the young people and we were talking about the ways that Satan comes in his approach to enticement if there was a company in Canada that in order to see these this is what advertisers do to see how could they increase sales in a mall now they didn't say let all the wives come out they wanted to know how do we increase the cells they found if they can pump certain Aromas through the ventilation systems what will have an effect and so then they watched after they put that through they watched the effect on the data that came from that then they determined what they could put in there in the systems and people are walking and not even aware that that even that having an effect I tell you Satan he's more advanced than what all of them are but we're not to fear him to be afraid of Satan but we are to give reverence to God and as we fear the lord a holy reverence a rightful reverence a reverence to him to his word then God will lead us God will direct us God will help us just like brother John was saying you know I don't know how many of you have had to do one of those virtual things over an iPad or whatever I went into a clinic the one time and they wanted to I walked in and here's a receptionist setting there and she flipped one of these things in front of me why can't you take why can't you take care of me I don't I didn't know I didn't know if this was a person somewhere else or it's an AI I I really didn't know be honest with you and uh they're talking to me I'm thinking all you have to do is take my card and but you know there was a lady that I went to a nurse practitioner and she saw me but you know what's hard it's hard to do virtual checkups that's why it's important in being in the house of God in everything because there's things that as it comes down to it's us taking the word and letting the word examine our own lives that's God's care for us that's his love I tell you and you want to think about how much that God loves you how much God cares for you look how he comes so personally once again this morning that's his love when he comes and makes known of a trap or a situation my then his grace to help us to lead us right out and you know what it all starts with you say brother Samuel how does it begin with the loosening and the freedom it begins with first of all agreeing with the word what he has said and to accept his pardoning grace to accept freedom and say I'm not going to stay in this any longer because the son hath made me free the Lord Jesus has spoke to me he spoke to my heart and look look what brother John read there out of the prodical son that quote where it talked about the cigarette talked about if the devil can just get you one time he'll take you on Satan is an impersonator he's a copycat he's not an originator he's a perverter so if all satan needs to get you to do is start one little thing and then he'll take you on let's flip that let's flip that if all God can get you to do is begin to say yes to begin to to agree with the word of God he will take you on I'm telling you he's greater than the Trap of all your failures in your mind all your failed attempts he's [Music] greater he's more than enough you say how do you know because I've tried him I've proved him over and over again he's a God who sets free he's a God who delivers from traps how do you know I've tried him I've experienced that it's like brother John could say who's done this and he said don't raise your hand every one of us with complexes thinking and on and on and on and on and on but God's grace it reaches to where we're at I tell you this morning I say thank you [Music] Jesus thank you Lord just even the simplest of things how that brother John brought that I mean how many of us ever thought of it that way before setting in the church and here we've already solved next week's problems we've already solved everything that's going on and just a little thought that comes that way let me just tell you that's not just a thought it's Satan trying to get your mind off of something and it's it's innocent it's Innocent but if he can just get your mind away enough from what God has for you because Satan has looked over the shoulder of Brother John he knows what's purposed in this meeting this morning and for this evening so you think he's not going to try to distract but he's he's afraid because he knows you as a Believer as soon as you just consent to the word and say yes Lord I believe Satan is powerless cuz it's already done it's already done you love him amen let's just stand together this evening at Lord willing at 5:30 we'll have the the youth service here and my goodness I'm I'm just looking forward to it I'm looking forward to what the Lord is going to speak to us hallelujah I want you to be in prayer for Brother John will you do that be in prayer for Brother John be in prayer for the young people only here our young people but all that will be coming in we just want the Lord to have his way I tell you to me what a tremendous thing even in a youth service God turn around and take a hold of a life that might be 70 years old doesn't matter the gospel is to reach our hearts and it brings results the the lovely Lord Jesus is he good to us he's real good there's nobody like Jesus no one let's just bow our heads in order prayer Heavenly Father what a privilege it is Lord to be in your presence here this [Music] morning Lord I'm sure this is not a message Lord that we've heard today that would flee or Fleet from our minds or our hearts visually the things Lord and how you would take the gift and we thank you for the gift that you placed there in brother John's life Lord through this here this morning Lord I've been helped we've been helped Lord we want to take this word Lord we don't leave it here it it's fallen into our hearts and our lives God to take it as your Prophet said to nurture these things in our hearts Lord and to obey them with Godly discipline and reverence oh God may you just continue Lord I pray as that word moving in our hearts Lord a transforming word Lord power oh God to bring to pass what you've said Lord may you Lord I pray God just continuing to move in every life and every heart May there not be one here this morning Lord that God would make willingly a choice just to no matter the circumstance to leave Lord without accepting that freedom that you made a way for that we could have Lord whatever the need is you're the Lord who forgiveth all our iniquities the Lord who Health all our diseases the same God who Deliver Us from destruction and crowneth our life with Tender Mercies bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefits we love you Lord bless your children as we go Lord our separate ways for a few moments may you refresh and strengthen your servant Lord God as we look forward Lord here to the service this evening we just invite you Lord as you would continue to move among us move among every young person Lord every heart God watch over those that are up the roads traveling Lord we just want to say we love you father we just Commit This Day into your hands and Lord we want to say thank you Lord thank you Father in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen why
