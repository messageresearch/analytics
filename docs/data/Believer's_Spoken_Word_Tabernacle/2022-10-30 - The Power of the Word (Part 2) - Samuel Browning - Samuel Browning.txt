========================================

playing in our life that the word brings out because the words are discerner we want to side with the word like when Moses said whoever is on the Lord's Side let him come and Stand By Me amen for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him and where the word of a king is there is power and who may say unto him what do us whoso keepeth the Commandment shall feel no evil thing oh I love that who so keepeth the Commandment shall feel no evil thing it didn't say evil things might not come but you will not feel any evil things why because the king's word has power and if you receive the king's word you receive the authority and the power of that word with you and no evil thing shall you shall feel and a wise man heart discerneth both time and judgment amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated it's again just such a privilege and honor to be gathered here together this morning and I want to draw your attention back to that word actually in verse 4 and you know so much through all of these verses of scriptures just so precious and speaking of the authority and us not being in a haste and not siding with the word I want to just say when we look here over verse 4 for where the word of a king is There Is Power and you know someone else might give a word and that word could be questioned maybe if it's somebody in the king's court that maybe would be a little less or it would be someone without that but where a king's word is when that King's word is spoken by the king it's a word that is not to be questioned now think of it in in the days of Esther where uh where a hazrus remember with the authority of that word that when he gave his word and he spoke for vashti to come that's that she would come because he wanted to to to to to show to show off before all of those who were there and she refused to come in his word now because she rejected the word in order to come remember then the king himself he put her away because she rejected the word so the word has the power to join us or to actually uh cause that to where we are rejected or put away but I want to just focus on that here this this morning that as king hazarus went on within that and remember there was a word that you know Haman came and threw deceit and so forth he calls there to be a a law that was passed that the Jews were to be destroyed but within that here God begins to move upon Esther and I don't want to get so much into that that part of it because that's not really where I'm going but I want to focus on just the authority of that word to where that when the king of hazrus would rise up and here he would say I cannot undo what has already been written but what I can do is I can you you and your people speaking to Esther you can rise up on the day beforehand in other words make a preparation and you can go and deal with all of those of your enemies that was going to to come and take your life let me say this that sin the Bible says that the ways and the pleasures of sin is death we understand that what lays before it's certain and the word of God that word cannot be taken away but there is a word that has come to you and I that lets us know that we can make ready against that day that we can actually rise up by the authority of God's word through the blood of Jesus Christ and that very tie within our life that is tied to Satan by the first birth is broken by the power of the blood of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit so it allows us to prepare ourselves against that day to prepare ourselves to live and to walk in Liberty and I I want to just speak here just for a few moments on the power of the word the power of the word and when you look at this where the word of a king is there is power that means there is Mastery that is there there is a power to be exercised that is also to become master or even the word dominate is within this particular word which means to have a commanding influence on or to exercise control over and we realize that no matter where you're at even gathering in this Gathering here this morning we are either under the influence of God when we are under the influence of Satan we are we're being influenced by one power or another and it's not our thoughts because remember the God is not a thought nor is Satan a bad thought the Bible said concerning the Holy Ghost when he is come not a thought but when the person of Jesus Christ is come and we also recognize that the devil is also a spiritual being so it's not just a bad thought and a good thought but we know we can tell and discern even by the thoughts that are coming to us who is trying to influence us who is trying to inspire us so we want that of the word and the word is meant to have a commanding influence Upon Our Life and uh you know when we see this in the scripture you know there is a need as Paul would write that the veil Upon Our Hearts would be taken away that that Veil because there was a veil upon the hearts of those Pharisees and those religious men who knew the word so perfectly if we could say it like this so it'd be simple those men on Sunday school charts their their line would have been filled up with stars they were they can recite the verses they had all the Sunday school toys they had all that they knew the letter but they didn't know God that's why the Bible says to know just the letter the letter killeth because the latter itself is actually pointing us to the very person of Jesus Christ the letter killer but it is the spirit that giveth life I don't know about you but I want life amen and you know the veil itself within their life was to be when that Veil is taken away then that heart is turned to the Lord and that comes by the spirit of almighty God who brings Liberty it is God alone who breaks the veils upon lives you remember that the young man who was healed in his eyes and here you know when he came and he hadn't seen the Lord Jesus and everything had taken place between him and his parents and the Pharisees but when he stood there and he came face to face with the Lord Jesus after his eyes were healed Jesus asked him the question do you believe in the Son of God he said who is he Lord that I may believe you see he was Desiring who is he he'd been touched you see there had already been a touch that had come into his life that was undeniable this man saw and he never had seen before and now that he's seen physically he was the same God who moved for a physical need upon his life do you realize God can touch your life physically and the things that he'll do and let me say this this is where the question should become why has God done this for me why has God moved upon this from me and what must I do I'll tell you that is God's love his grace and his care you say what must I do I would begin to seek after him because if he can open your eyes he can heal your body he can deliver you from oppression he can break the hold of drugs and alcohol and cigarettes that same God is there to loosen the hold upon your soul that is tormented you and plagues you and bring a real Deliverance in your life I tell you that's what I do I'd say Lord who is he that I might believe glory be to God that veil was done away with and he began to worship and this is why where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty let me say this God's God's objective it's not just that we feel Liberty in the house of God let me say this I believe that there's any place there ought to be Liberty it's in the house of God I said if there's any place there ought to be Liberty it's in the house of God a liberty where it's being proclaimed that you're free you can walk free there is Deliverance there God has made Appropriations that man could come I believe with all my heart this ought to be a place of Liberty but God's desire is not that Liberty will not just remain here but that it would come here because where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty we can live and walk us free freedom and this is where we are changed the Bible would say for into the same image from Glory unto Glory now his word his word is his voice are you hearing me now his word is his voice Jesus said my sheep know my voice and they follow not it me so he is the word the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us my sheep hear my voice and they follow me so we see we can't be following Jesus and not following his word if there's another voice that comes and says this doesn't apply to this age it's not the voice of God it's the voice of a hireling it's the voice of a stranger are you with me because the voice of the chief Shepherd calls to the Sheep of God you may not recognize and have fully recognized that you are a sheep but the only way that you can hear the voice of the shepherd because many can hear his voice and they take his voice and say what's he asking of me what's he requiring but to a sheet there is a prevailing Authority in his voice there is a love that ministers to them that says with your condition with your situations I not only can do something I did something for you I have already loosened you I bore the stripes I paid the price that you can walk through all of that Authority is ministered in the voice of God to the Sheep of God Hallelujah so he is the word and the word speaks the word was smitten in order to speak right there had to be a Calvary in order to release the voice when you see now that there was a Calvary now it releases The Voice that was there and now that voice comes forth to announce and declare freedom in other words I am your freedom I am your Jubilee I am your Shield I am your buckler I am your all-in-one I am your healing I am your deliverance I am your Shepherd he's announcing who he is how can he do that because remember he went and paid the price and the Bible said when he arose he said all power in Heaven and Earth is given into my hand and he rose up and ascended there and he sat at the right hand of the Majesty on high it's not a young boy sitting on an old man's hand it's figurative right hand speaks of authority and Power because when John Luke John never said I looked and saw three he said one sat on the throne hallelujah it's the devil that wants to break that confusion you know why because if he can bring that confusion then the expectation is you are receiving something lesser than God but God himself became man God created a body for himself to dwell in why that he might come and dwell in his people this is why the agnostics and the unbelievers wanted to question and say Jesus is not come in the flesh and John said whosoever say that Jesus Christ is not come in the flesh is the spirit of antichrist why because it's the Living God who comes flesh in his people I'm glad about that there is a liberty that I can walk in a liberty in a freedom that I can stand here under the authority of that same voice that same anointing and Proclaim that same Liberty Psalms 29 4. the Bible said that the voice of the Lord is powerful yes it is the voice of the Lord is full of majesty somebody say powerful somebody say full of majesty that's what the voice of the Lord is it's full of majesty that's honor that's Glory that's power that's Dominion the word the voice of the Lord is powerful hey there was a woman who had an infirmity of blood let's just go as he's taking this she will bound with that infirmity she had went to every doctor you know why she wanted help I need help I this Blood condition I need delivered from this and no doubt the doctors were doing all they could to try to help her but when she came and she said I've got to touch Jesus you know what it was she recognized God was present in Christ it didn't matter how many Skeptics how many doubts how many things was trying to plague her way she said if I can get to him I know I shall be made whole Hallelujah also another another woman who was pound over remember she was bound over like this the Bible said she had an infirmity she could not raise up let me tell you that's just not a Bible story and that's just not for that woman it was God demonstrating in that power that there's things that you've bowed to there's things you've given yourself to it may not have been sin as you call it but it might be depression it might be anxiety it might be Pride it might be a lot of things that's come in your life bruises and emotional scars but there is a power that just as he said right there Woman Thou Art loose I'm asking you whose hands were laid on that woman it was the voice of God that spoke to that condition you are loose you are free that's the power of the word of God listen friends those things that he just spread Express expressed right here are not things to be minimized they are not things to be glorified they are not things to even be toiled around played with or even put on a shelf and Polished they are meant to have dominion over you got quiet on me but that's okay we have we in much just as much as we stand and against sin in every other way we should stand that same way brother Sammy you don't know what I battle I'm not asking what you battled with I'm trying to remind you of your rights and who you are that what am I saying don't ever make a place in your life tore it but you stand right there and you let the enemy know you have no right here you have no place here my life is reserved for almighty God [Applause] Hallelujah the voice of the Lord is powerful the voice of the Lord is full of majesty so the most powerful think of it between the two forces between God and Satan God who if I would ask the question who has the most most power obviously God does right God has the most power now once you think of this how do the message the contest you see what God gave them in the beginning was the best thing he could give them to combat with I'm talking about back in Eden he gave him his word all they had to do was stay with that word but in the midst of conflict and battle Eve let down on that word and remember she didn't even have her own name at the time right the Bible said in Genesis 5 in the day when he created them he called their name Adam because to the believer we don't have our own name come on you know people want to ask what church you go to what as though we got to have our own identity my identity is in him the Bible says that the people in heaven and earth all that are named The Name of Jesus Christ so we're not going by our own name because sometimes if you go your own name you say something in name then you know what the doctrine they prescribed to right because their Doctrine has produced a name it's produced in Allegiance has produced a church but you see God was never interested in producing a church remember the church itself was in God's mind before the foundation of the world and God knows that his church being reproduced will actually be himself being revealed in the lives of his people not the idea of a man not the idea and the schools of theology but the living presence of the Living God coming down and manifesting himself to and through and in the lives of his children Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it I tell you what there is many things that could Prevail against these walls they could Prevail against the walls of a natural church but we're not talking of a natural Church we're talking of a spiritual church that is known as the body of Jesus Christ and it cannot be prevailed against now think about it he gave his word to combat the enemy let me say this who's stronger than God anybody no like he asked Sarah is there anything impossible with God now think about it Sarah standing right there she has not been had the ability to have children right and God gave a promise she's looking at the promise and looking at her body and saying how is this going to be but you see if you look at the promise and look at yourself is looking at the wrong way but when you when your promise is made look to the one who is speaking it look to the one who has made that promise and the same God who made that promise is greater than all of your infirmities is greater than all of your complexes he's greater than all of your weaknesses who are you talking about I'm talking about how Shady eye the almighty God the Living God for in his word is power and Majesty the authority to change our bodies one and the word the word is God is that the word Amen in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word becomes our strength God in the church becomes its strength to pull Satan into his own fires now I want you to think of this because we know that we are in a battle just in case you didn't know we're in a battle and Paul admonished as Believers he said finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you might be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil Peter said that this line that Satan himself he's not a lion but he roams as a lion seeking whom he may devour right are you hearing me Satan's not a lion he tries to mimic the true lion and the true lion is almighty God the true lion is the lion of the tribe of Judah he tries to mimic was that right he wants to try to mimic him and put forth a word that would want to bring fear want to devour want to want to I consume a life but his consumption listen to me now Satan's way of consuming a life is to wrap it up with such unbelief such doubt with such things about its life to where that life sees no other way don't come that way think what the chief Shepherd said he's called Satan is nothing but a thief and a robber God gave you those virtues God placed those in your life God gave you those attributes God gave you the desire to serve him but Satan's desire is to come as a thief and try to take opportunities from your life whether it's a young person a middle age or an older person he wants to come as a thief in deceive he left to rob you of what God has for you you know why he is afraid of that word taking effect in your life why it will move and perform the same way it did in the body of the Lord Jesus for he said the works that I do shall you do also and greater than these meaning more because that same life has now been dispersed [Applause] true he's afraid of that word coming into its place in our lives so Satan will study our strategy with the word of God he studied it perfectly perfectly when he came to Eve and he uses the strategy of reasoning and reasoning is now listen God told us in the book of Isaiah said come let us reason together right though thy sins be a Scarlet they shall be white as snow but it really matters who you're reasoning with when you reason with the word or your reasoning is with the word then we then it's of God but when come on now I'm not out I had too many things I can quote on this one but when your reasoning goes against the word that's where you recognize your enemy yeah right what did Satan do what did Satan do to her in the beginning now think of this she's under the word but he comes to anoint her with disbelief right now remember the word has power the word is the anointing the word itself coming forth and he begins to speak to her and that anointing begins to move and she entertains it she stops to listen the best thing she could have done is said hold on just a second here we're going to stop this right here but she entertained it so when she entertained it then that anointing was able to move it just kept to listen to me now it kept on moving in her life you see backsliding doesn't take place at just one moment you start entertaining reasoning against the word of God well not pretty good I'm a pretty good guy pretty good girl I'm telling you I'm pretty good compared to what yeah well you should see my neighbor you know to compare yourself to your neighbor you compare yourself to the word looking unto Jesus who is the author and the finisher of our faith right I mean I could compare myself to my dog I'd be a lot better than my dog but we we have a right to compare that's why Paul said they that compare themselves among themselves are fools we don't compare ourselves with other flesh We compare ourselves with the word we are not predestinated to be conformed to the image of somebody else we have been ordained to be formed to the image of his dear son who is his dear son he is the word for there are three that are one the Father the word and the spirit are you hearing me now so now we don't want to we don't want a reason with the word we want to believe the word just believe it he said brother I said just like this just believe it don't try to explain it don't try to figure it out I know these are simple Parts but sometimes this is where we get caught up trying to figure it out trying to explain it just believe it a simple simple thing that God asked us to do and that's where Satan wants to come in complicated are you hearing me now Paul said he was jealous over the Church of the Living God with a Godly jealousy lest Satan should corrupt your minds from the Simplicity that is in Jesus Christ the gospel is not a complicated Affair it is the Simplicity of God's Life coming and doing in us for us and through us what he has already made a way for what must I do well what would you do if the King was coming right you won't stand in the way of the king's word you let the king's word come right they had Runners right they had Runners that went before the king and Runners I know I'm speaking you know not in this day and age but there are Runners that went before the king why because the King was saved the King was coming down this pathway and the King was going to come this road that's the road he's going to come you're not going to put up a detour and say you cannot come this way he is the word and he always comes according to his word he never deviates from his word he's not a man that he should lie nor the son of man that he should repent right his word is sure but God will send a forerunner God will send a messenger God will send a message God will send a word that does what remember what John the Baptist said here he was he was announced already in the book of Isaiah the voice of one crying in the wilderness and they asked him who do you say that you are and what did he do he pointed the what you see this ministry is identified in the scriptures because anything that is of god that is really sent as a real move of God will always identify itself in the scripture and there'll not be a contradiction of another scripture against it because the Bible says that no scripture is of any private interpretation is that right that he is the Alpha and Omega it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever right and that messenger would have to go and he would have to see that Boulders impediments things that could be stumbled over all those things that would hinder the king from coming oh are you with me now what Authority does does that messenger have does that one have to say hey let's get this cleared out of here hey let's get this Boulder cleared out hey that log that tree that's falling across the path let's get that cut up and get that out of the way by whose authority the king is coming the king is coming and I am his messenger carrying the message that the king is coming and he's not going to come a different way he's coming this way [Applause] glory be to God so he must come this way so God sends his Messengers to do what prepare the way of the Lord sure God makes a way for his word to come into your life into my life sometimes you really you know you can send and say well I just want the king to come in but he's going to come according to his way he's already laid his word his way out in his word allow the word himself to prepare the way that he the word the king himself might come and sit down on the throne of your heart you can't figure out God anybody ever tried doing that well I have sure I have oh brother Sammy you might be talking about years ago no I mean even in situations that can take place in my life right now we can try to figure it out we have certain things that maybe it's going to happen this way or or I wonder why this or I wonder come on Friends these aren't glorified yet are you with me but it always comes back to the one thing I don't know but I trust you I know that I know that I know I know him and I know he works everything according to the Council of his own will and who art thou old man that I would ask God and that thou mayest instruct him come on now I'm in the Bible right who is it that can stand before the word of a king and say why are you saying this why are you saying that really can this be don't dispute with the word don't reason with the word except the word and believe the word because the word has power it the word brings to pass whatsoever he has said you can't figure God out this word is just made to believe that's our strength just accept the word so if we could just say it like this we want to unleash the power of that word by believing it and accepting amen the word there's power in the word but you see it's only going to be powerful to you if you'll stay in the presence of him who spoke it if you take the side with him against evil if you'll take and let the word go to work in your life then there's an authority that moves in to bring to pass what the King has said then you know what happens you become the expression of the king's Authority because it's his authority living in your life that's why Jesus said I have given you power over unclean spirits I have given that's that's the Church of the Living God that if we go forth preaching the gospel and those that believe and are baptized in my name shall be saved an authority to stand against every unclean spirit I'll tell you there's not a devil that can stand before the name of Jesus Christ [Applause] there's not a devil are you saying you just say that no I I've prayed for many and seen many different in many situations there's probably not too many Devils anything printed too much that you can name that I haven't witnessed and seen conquer standing right there I'll tell you he's God above it all he's still the mighty conqueror let me tell you something I've got gonna come to reform people he don't come to give your mind over matter it comes to give you his mind his life that you would reign in this life not that you have to be looking over your shoulder and wonder how well I tell you what I've been 10 days clean or I've been 30 days clean I tell you if you ever get your soul clean you'll never look over your shoulder anymore because you recognize there's no going back because the hold that was upon my life has been broken that's the power of the word what does it do it takes you from looking over your shoulder your fear to a place of authority where you become a testimony so give me a scripture on that the man of caterer he was bound we don't even know his name he was known by the Mount of devils that possessed his life Legion is that right things would arise after so long a time and he would go to the go to the catacombs you know he would use his six days six days six days up at work and personal leave because he was out there he couldn't be around his family family didn't want him being around there he was all out there let me tell you it started on one time if you'd ask Legion what happened Legion stop just for a moment I started with one little bit of reasoning started with one little drink started with one little smoke I started with one little look I started it all it takes because you can't control sin are you hearing me now you want me you cannot control it it has to be one on the inside of you a God that brings a Deliverance in your life but when that man got free remember Jesus came across the sea for that one man let me tell you something God will take this service for one person that's my Jesus my Jesus is not afraid of busting up the program my Jesus is not afraid that oh I'll go contrary to this song that ain't my Jesus his program is before the foundation of the world amen and it's coming right down in through time right here and that same Jesus he crossed the sea for one that saved Jesus will cross the sea let me tell you what he'll do he'll go through your back barriers of doubt he'll go through every barrier that the enemy has ever wanted to put upon your life there is nothing that can stop my Jesus nothing while we're preaching we might as well preach [Applause] he was a woman by the name of Rahab help me preacher now she was on she was inside a walled City she couldn't get out on her own the Walsh was too thin and you know you know in The Book of Leviticus to be inside a walled city is a curse you and I were born man born of a woman is full of trouble and a few days old we were born under the curse of sin we couldn't get out of it we were walled in but there was a God who came down and that same God right here this morning he'll tear down every wall [Music] Hallelujah there's not a wall too thick then my Jesus can't break down [Applause] you say I can't get to him but he can get to you he can break the walls down but you'll be able to walk out and you have to say pardon me a minute I gotta step over this Rubble what is that Rubble that Rubble is what was trapping you in but let me remind you it ain't nothing but Rubble [Applause] all the brick and mortar that Satan wanted to put over your life to him you in is nothing but Rebel when the voice of God shouts forth [Music] the way the Bible said let every man be swift to hear slow to speak for the wrath of man James 1 20. the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God see our our own uh doing things in her own self well I'm gonna do this no we have no Authority on our own Jesus said I can do nothing of myself but what I see John 5 19 the father doing that doeth the son likewise Hallelujah so we're not acting upon enthusiasm we're acting under authority of divine inspiration this is why verse 21 wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls notice lay lay everything else aside but how can I do that because the authority of the King has spoken his word has spoken when the word has spoken and addressed sin in your life don't sit there with sin in your life if there's things that need to be made right make it right are you hearing me repentance friends is not a cheap word repentance is the key to all the promises of God in this day and age repentance has been replaced by excuses well I wouldn't be this way and so and so and so and so no no no the gospel came to take care of that it's true that they're not no doubt there have been some rotten apples in your life but don't forget you're a rotten apple too but down at the core there's a real child of God we're not here to pick out rottenness we're here to see Sons and Daughters of God come into full reality all right don't allow excuses well so-and-so did this or so and then that sort of and I don't want to talk about them I want to talk about what did the Lord Jesus do for you because he has done for you what nobody else could do how many times you say oh they wronged me how many times have you wronged him he's coming knocked on your heart he's spoken to you time and time again he's come to you and told you he loves you he cares about you he wants to do for you and you turn it away and then you can stand in his presence and say these people have wronged me he has done nothing but love you and give himself for you and speak to your heart who is it that even walk in a bar and bring conviction in your heart you say you mean Jesus would do that he walked into a pig pen one time where there was a prodigal son big Angel of the Lord knew just where that boy was [Applause] afraid of those conditions you know why he's coming for his sheep [Applause] you're not a drunkard come on follow me now you was ordained to be a sheep of God oh he's here Hallelujah that does not define who you are the word is defining who you really are Satan's wanted to put that label on your life Satan's wanted to Define that but God is letting you know you are a son and daughter of God [Applause] hallelujah what must I do lay aside all those other things and receive with meekness being grafted word of God which is able to save yourself you're not engrafted word means within this word it's implanted with his nature scripture second Corinthians chapter three the Bible tells us concerning the law right Paul said the law is Holy and good right so the law was not done away with the law becomes established by the Holy Ghost in our hearts that's what God had said he said I will write upon the tablets of your heart my law why because his law God whether we're being expressed what was glorious about the law because the law only pointed out you're guilty you're guilty you're guilty you're guilty you're guilty right that's what the law did right but where where where where there was sin Grace did much more abound and the grace of God came to do for you and I what we could not do ourselves the grace of God came to do what to pay the price that the work of the Holy Spirit could come and write the law upon the tablets of our heart to where our nature is changed don't you see that's why being born again it's been so cheaply used you're born again while I'm born again and you see him you think well you ain't no different than anybody else see it's been so cheapened God never cheapened it God never cheapened his word the Bible said in Isaiah 59 that when the spirit cometh in like a flood the eye the Lord will raise a standard against it what is the standard of God it's his word coming in power and authority to bring deliverance and stand down in the midst of our life foreign is to give it place that's what meekness is to give it place now you see God knows how to soften you and I up this is why the Bible tells us in the Book of Ezekiel he said I will give them a new heart and a new spirit a new heart new way of thinking thinking in a Sanctified way right you think about the things that are being done you become open to the word of God and a new spirit God comes in to deal with that new spirit but remember the new spirit is not the Holy Spirit a person can have a new heart and a new spirit the Bible tells us in first John that there are three that agree in one right there are three that the water the blood and the spirit they agree in one but a person can be justified and not Sanctified not cleansed they can be sanctified and not be filled with the Holy Ghost this is why Paul would announce know you not you are a temple of the Holy Ghost he's letting the people of God know these are your rights and don't stop short of it you are ordained to be a Dwelling Place of God's own life and not to receive that word with meekness to let it have its rightful place within our life that then after the new heart and new spirit then his Spirit comes in are you with me you see this is why let me I I want to just refer to a couple places here the Bible tells us God resisteth the proud it's not a first Peter 5 5. and giveth grace to the humble how many desire Grace God resists the proud those are just well I you know I'm good God resists the proud that's why I don't stand in any evil thing side with the word humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you see God cares about you he cares about your life he wants to do for you what no one else can do he cares what must I do well he cares do you care right do you care what about the same I do care do you care what are you doing to show that you do care are you accepting his word or are you reasoning against it let me say this there's two forces that work faith and doubt are standing right at your heart doubt would want to tell you you'll be all right to the next service there may not be a next service and there may not be a next service for you remember this life is for the opportunity for you and I to surrender Our Lives to God and to walk with God and to serve him the Bible said the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom to serve him to do his word is that right oh my humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time notice in James chapter 4. the Bible said do you not think the scripture says in vain that the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to Envy but he giveth more grace I love that he don't just give a little Grace he gives more grace wherefore God resisteth the proud but giveth Grace unto the humble submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you notice what does submit mean voluntarily surrender and come under before so what does it mean if submit and humble means to surrender and come under than to not do it would be Pride what is somebody else going to say somebody else ain't going to stand there for you on that day somebody else ain't going to give you authority to live in this lifetime as an overcomer but there is one who can give you and release to you the authority that belongs to you the Liberty as a son and daughter of God well I've been around this message for all those years don't let pride stand in your way God resisteth the prize you cannot resist him and expect more grace to come because it is not Grace that you are receiving that allows you to live in unbelief that is disgrace you are not receiving Grace because when Grace comes to you and I it is Grace to correct us Grace to show us our way and Grace to come and bring forth in our life what he has called for and he giveth more grace you know what that means as we come under that word he gives more grace we come under the word he gives more grace holy Lord I'm struggling here but when Lord you're aware it is true I give myself the Lord to you I Surrender more grace this is why when there's sufficient Grace that a life can be convicted and be re and repent of their sins what are they doing receiving of Grace and as they will receive that Grace then they make themselves available for more grace what's more grace for God to come and cleanse the habits out of their life cleanse them up sanctifying to feel the longings that they've tried to feel with everything else let me tell you there's not a woman nor a man nor anybody nor a job nor a stock nor money can feel the emptiness of your heart but there's one who can feel he can feel that he can satisfy you are you hearing me David said blessed are they whom thou causeth to approach to thy house o God for they shall be satisfied with the goodness of God it comes to a place to where you're sat you know how it is when you're satisfied when you've ate and somebody says hey guess what we got something else over here in our house you know Mom Dad somebody shows up something comes out for Thanksgiving and hey we got this particular pie out you think Lord why did I eat more of that sweet potato casserole I should have saved more room for the pumpkin streuseling yeah it sounds good right now don't I but use it as an example when God has filled our life you see God wants to feel our lives who were satisfied to where the world no longer sin no longer has Dominion remember short verse of scripture three words remember Lots why the word told her walk she started hearing some cries come from Sodom you pulled on her heart she turned and looked back and became a pillar of salt all she had to do is heed to the word and she would have walked on but this is why Jesus could say those three words remember lost why why gave heed to another voice she started out as an overcomer and eventually because he never became a full overcomer eventually the word world overcame her is powerful let me let me try to let me try to bring this down we giveth more grace and God giveth Grace unto the humble draw nine to God and He will draw nigh unto you humble yourselves in the sight of God that he may exalt you up God gives Grace upon great let me tell you there is sufficient Grace this morning for healing of your body they're sufficient Grace you realize I'm talking to everybody here I'm talking to everybody this applies to every condition in our lives no matter where you're at with God even obtaining every promise of God and God working with our life it depends on are we humbling ourselves to him don't reason against it the word is made to believe think of what Paul would say here he said God hath chosen you from the beginning and second Thessalonians 2 13 to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth whereunto he called you by Our Gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ let me just let me bring this here to this moment the word itself has its coming it's got to come to the Mind first that's why Satan attacks your mind the four servants and in a service because the word has got to be accepted in the mind once it's accepted in the mind now it's not our thoughts it's his thoughts not our thoughts our thoughts do not have life in them his thoughts has life to receive his word is life so for a mind to be open to accept the word of God as it's coming to accept it think of this what does accept mean what does accept me it'd be just like brother William if I were standing here let's say with uh a gift certificate okay I know the places you like so I don't know all of them but I know one of them but if I had a gift certificate to that place and if what you said was oh that's wonderful oh that's great yes it's wonderful oh I can oh and then you get up and you walk out what's the problem you never accepted it I've got it right here in my hand but you've got to accept it you've got to accept it you've got not a reason against it oh you don't know no it's not about you it's about the word it's not you that we're lifting up or you that we're putting down it is the word Jesus said if I be lifted up then I will draw all men unto me and it's to him to be presented it's for us to accept him and to come under that word so in our mind let me just finish this point to accept that word in our mind then believe it with our heart then the spirit of God comes upon that word to bring it to past are you hearing me you first must accept it in the mind and that's where the Battleground is that's the same thing when it comes to even healing in our body Satan wants to battle in our mind when it comes to Deliverance when it comes to other things he wants to battle in our mind when you tried this before you've done this before what's he doing that ain't God saying that is the devil wanting to battle in your mind because if you can accept that word like like as I said walking here and taking it and saying that's my word accept the word don't reason against it accept it and believe it let it drop down into your heart and then the spirit of God is what comes and Waters it praise the Lord let me tell you I know what God can do in just a moment are you hearing me I know what God can do in a moment I know God can change your life just in a moment but I also know that God there are times that where there is a work that's going on in a life and that work is just Grace being received upon Grace received upon Grace well brother Samuel they've been sentenced so long in this Grace why don't you stop looking and evaluating everybody else and start evaluating your own life and receive God's grace God didn't put anybody in here with a black pants and whiten you know zebra shirt with a whistle you've been in justification too long you've been in sanctification too long then if you can do something about it do something about it for him well what should I do I'm speaking plain what should I do pray for him that more grace would come because we grow in the grace and admonition of the Lord I'm not here to push people on are you hearing me I'm not here to do that because when you do that then it becomes you and it becomes a man's work you got to push them to church pull them to church push them to church pull them to church you're not to be dependent upon a man you are to be United with Jesus Christ he is your lord he is your savior he is your Redeemer he should deliver he's the one that paid the price for you you ought to have a relationship with him there is one fathering Lord of us all and that's the Lord Jesus Christ so what are you saying I'm saying I watch God and I can look to God as God will build lives sometimes there's things that takes place instantaneous and sometimes if things listen I'm even speaking to people personally that even questioning your life right now I know where I'm at I know where he's leading me you can look at your life and say well I didn't receive don't compare yourself to somebody else well I don't see this right now let me tell you something the work of God does not take place on the outside end it takes place from the inside out he works to change the inside I've got an oak tree in my yard right now we've never seen squirrels the whole time we've lived there I've lived there now for five years in that home and now those squirrels want to torment my dogs my dogs can't get to them you know they can't go beyond that barrier but those because there's there's acorns everywhere you know how long it took to produce them acorns well they put I don't know who planted it I don't know if a deer planted it squirrel planted it I don't know who planted that there I don't know it don't matter it don't matter are you hearing me it doesn't matter who planted it it wasn't who planted it that gave it the authority to be an oak tree it was in it the whole time and in the word of God being engrafted word holds the germ to become whatsoever he has said it will be you are always to be a son and daughter of God are you hearing me you are never meant to be certain slave or upon to him you're never meant to be that you are ordained to be a son and daughter of God it might have taken you a while to recognize it but there's the voice of God that speaks with power and a Majesty to let you know you are a silent daughter of God and it equips you to let you know you don't have to set in that condition any longer I'm bringing it down personal even with complexes and everything else in our life there is a power to bring healing in our life a power that can reach to where no surgeon can reach a power that can reach to where no psychologist can go to a one who can heal a wound that no womb doctor can heal but there is the great physician the almighty God he heals what's incurable he is the cure for it what is undeliverable he is the Deliverance for it [Applause] you see that word as it's coming forward what is it as you receive that word as what Eve received it brought disbelief but you receive this word it brings faith it brings Faith to do what lay aside everything else lay aside your thoughts about you lay aside your doubts lay aside your unbelief lay aside whatever's trying to hold you back and do what humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God that he will exalt us oh brother Samuel I don't want to get in the flesh news flash whatever your age is on your birth certificate that's how long you've been in the flesh well I don't want to act out of order you're never acting and let me say this to you you're never acting out of order when you're standing on God's word you're never out of order when you're standing on the word you're always in order when you're standing for the word of God let me say this to you I tell you where I would stand that even here this morning I would stand like Mary remember when Mary here she was she was ordained already God didn't have to write her name in Isaiah 9 6 God knew who it was talking about are you hearing me anybody been in a play before a drama a play never ever done that okay you have to try out for those parts don't you right you have to try out can I do this part let me tell you something in this drama there is no tryouts tryouts tryouts no the ACT the actors already wrote In [Applause] you might look at your life and say I don't fit that God said well you can't do it but you wait let me get inside you you let me come in and I'll act that part out and everything that's acted out all speaks of Jesus Christ being the same and here stood Mary look what the word comes the word came to her and said Thou Art highly favored what had she done tell me somebody highly favored one who has received divine grace what had she done nothing you can't earn God's grace get news what are you saying I'm saying it's for you all you have to do is yield right Thou Art highly favored blessed art thou among women begins to announce what is to take place notice down Shout conceive I have a child you shall call his name Jesus he shall be I don't have time to read the scripture but notice as he went through right after that this is what is going to take place this is who you are you are highly favored remember she cast in her mind in her mind in her mind she said what kind of a saying is this now this was not a young lady who didn't know the scripture she knew it right but she cast in her mind what is this but the word came and let her know this is what's going to be fulfilled in your life see the word was moving with power in it it was dismantling all doubt all unbelief you know what she was doing she was standing in the presence of the word and what was the word doing the word was dismantling every hold it was breaking every hold it was breaking every doubt he was breaking unbelief she just stood in the prince of the word being unhasty to go out of his presence the word was dismantling every doubt and when it come to that place how is this going to be seeing I don't know a man see in order for there to be conception children it's got to be a man and a woman right and so her her question is a human question how is this going to be seeing I don't know a man and God announces the Holy Ghost shall over shadow a work of are you hearing me God it was letting it be known I don't need your egg I Supply egg and sperm together because this is not going to be a creation of man right it could not be a blood or he could not even merge himself with blood that was polluted right that had to be blood that would be perfect blood that's why Peter could say this is the blood of Christ it had to be perfect blood God created a blood cell that Satan could not put his finger on and say ah this this you know what deep doing God even in his coming was dismantling any accusation that he could ever raise against you and say yes but this blood but you can look and say that was a blood that was born free from sex desire and in that blood that was shed it paid the price for my sin debt that I could rise up the Unworthy go unworthy but he has made me Worthy I can accept what he has already done do you realize your salvation is not something new this morning it was already paid for it's if you accept it your deliverance was already paid for will you accept it your healing was already paid for will you accept it and what did she say be it unto me according to Thy Word she received the word in her mind believed in the heart and the Spirit come upon it brother Branham said oh he said a Saint Paul I quoted right there he said I've always said if Saint Paul could hear that preach see that Saint Paul would be shouting right now because that's the gospel it's received in the mind believed in the heart and the spirit of God comes upon it see this is why the word being accepted what am I doing brother Sam you know I tell you what I do I'd accept the grace of God if you've never repented I mean been convicted in your heart to where you've really repented well I've tried you know because sometimes people unders some people mistake repentance for well you know I start to I started feeling bad so I started reading my Bible that ain't repentance I'm not against you but I'm just trying we want to uncover the devil the devil don't want you to repent well I started praying well okay that's that's that's good but have you repented you have to repent and it's not well I have to do this this is what the word when the word goes to dealing with your life it's to repent it's to realize I'm a sinner I need you Lord Jesus forgive me of my sins but remember we're living in a day and age right now but it's not my fault it's everybody else's fault I am the way I am because of everybody else right but this is the day remember we will not be judged upon what Adam did in their disbelief we will be judged at what we did when the word came by our way what will you do with This Man Called Jesus what will you do with the Holy Spirit dealing with my life what would you do with it but you see when you repent then the Bible said be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he's the sacrifice right that's the also Vision sacrifice and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's the promise of God's word it's just like when you need healing in your body it off begins to accept that promise Satan will work against you how many years how long how many prayer lines how many this how many of that you've been through let me tell you something what should I do casting down cast him down don't give him any place in your mind don't give him any place in your spirit cast him out what example am I following you're following the example that God did in heaven when he rose up in heaven God passed him out right that's how his children do we cast him out when he comes and says well you you'll you'll you'll never be well you'll never be free we cast him out and we accept the word by his stripes I am healed Hallelujah I am delivered by the blood of the Lamb Oh Brother Sam you know I've been prayed for for the Holy Ghost said you know I'm looking my love I really don't know it if it's come you're not I would confess that it's mine I would go ahead and go back oh I don't want to make our God to be alive who are you making out to be a liar he said he giveth the Holy Ghost to them that believe and he is the high priest of our confession I'm not confessing that someday I'm confessing right now he is my deliverer he is my seal he is my shield he is my butler I would confess the promise of God and don't back down one inch from it you believe that this morning Hallelujah we want to move on that word I want to we want Grace upon Grace upon Grace upon Grace it's the power of the word of God the power of the word in Simplicity receiving it submitting ourselves to it and letting it go down and letting the Spirit come in water you know how you water the word you water it with praise you water it with Thanksgiving you know Mary started testifying before she ever felt anything Mary never felt one thing in her womb and she went and spoke to Elizabeth she said she said I already knew yeah you didn't have to send me the baby shower announcement I already knew must been no but the same one who spoke to me had already confirmed what he did within you and here's what he said to me he said I should have a son and call his name Jesus and the Bible said when that name was spoken if the baby left in her womb six months she had never felt a kick or a punch but at the name of Jesus that baby responded [Applause] that life on the inside it's something about it when his word is preaching power and demonstration there is a life on the inside that Joseph says yes amen I I believe that [Applause] Hallelujah listen our heads praise God Hallelujah oh glory be to God remember this morning let's receive it whatever the need is let's receive it this morning don't don't just let him stand here with like the gift card in his hand and you walk out but if he's speaking to you respond to him receive it don't just go on receive it let that word bring Liberty to your life let it bring to you what you have need of and he's ministering to you don't just walk out receive what he has for you I'll tell you what I wouldn't be too proud just that if I was going to come to the altar well I'm going to tell him I come to the altar only Sinners come to the altar who told you that lie it ain't just Sinners that come to the altar but if there's something I needed from God I would want to I because none of us can get more or enough enough of God we need more of God amen we need more I want to receive from him I want to receive maybe you have need in your life here this morning you have need of Deliverance I'm telling you Jesus is the answer for every situation in your life whether it was something he called out or it wasn't something he still make known today that no matter what it is just as he said in the word I'm the Lord that healeth all thy diseases he didn't have to list them he's Lord above them all yeah right here this morning he's spoken so personally so clearly here
