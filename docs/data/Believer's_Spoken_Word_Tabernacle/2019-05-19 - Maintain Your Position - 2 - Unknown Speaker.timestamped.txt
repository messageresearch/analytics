[36:18] it's a little this young man his mother
[36:21] had spoke to sister Maria yes its
[36:24] difficulty sleeping find him just laying
[36:27] in the bed at night his eyes wide open 3
[36:30] o'clock in the morning
[36:31] I believe God cares
[36:36] I believe that
[36:39] then the other need is the Richard
[36:42] sister Maria's granddaughter Liliana God
[36:48] knows the whole inner workings within
[36:52] that need you know the doctors they're
[36:55] searching they're looking and you know
[36:58] she's been admitted there and they're
[37:00] looking at doing tests but we just want
[37:04] to come together and what we believe we
[37:08] know him to be the same yesterday today
[37:11] and forever
[37:12] he knows the need in the condition
[37:15] that's there and he's more than able to
[37:20] meet that need
[37:21] we just want to take these requests on
[37:24] to the throne of God
[37:26] there's also another need yesterday
[37:29] throughout the day I got a text real
[37:32] early in the morning about 4:30 in the
[37:34] morning some of you had prayer meeting
[37:36] remember from the church there in
[37:39] Connecticut there was a sister that had
[37:42] went in last last Thursday not this
[37:45] Thursday and she you know it had high
[37:48] blood pressure she was pregnant in the
[37:50] situation that was taking place
[37:51] retaining water I don't know the medical
[37:54] term but some of you would would know
[37:56] that and they had to take the baby at 27
[38:01] weeks and deliver it and the couple the
[38:05] family when I got the text yesterday
[38:08] morning they were called to the hospital
[38:11] and you know when it delivered that
[38:15] young the lungs themselves are not fully
[38:18] developed like they should be
[38:19] sometimes you as doctors and medical
[38:22] staff you realize sometimes that they
[38:24] will give if they know something is
[38:26] early on and they're going on they'll
[38:28] give a shot that'll start working to
[38:30] develop those lungs even while the baby
[38:31] is in the womb that didn't take place
[38:35] and there's a lot of logistics with it
[38:37] but in all things then we're praying and
[38:40] looking at this throughout the day I get
[38:42] a text yesterday evening and then on the
[38:44] phone last night
[38:47] the little baby went on home and so you
[38:52] know us you're just sometimes you well
[38:57] you don't have words you don't have
[39:01] words to say you just you just express
[39:04] your love and I just want you to pray
[39:10] with me and continue to help its brother
[39:13] Daniel and sister Grace there was their
[39:16] their names just was so heavy on my
[39:21] heart us you know I I've never been
[39:23] there my wife and I had a miscarriage
[39:24] once but never had where it was a baby
[39:28] that had come forth and so maybe maybe
[39:32] there's some that are standing here that
[39:34] I'm unaware of that you have been there
[39:35] or maybe I just forget about it but but
[39:38] we can enter in on behalf of them that
[39:41] God would just comfort this sometimes
[39:44] you go through things like that and know
[39:46] within the family there's been multiple
[39:49] miscarriages and you know things can
[39:54] begin to look at why why me Lord
[39:58] that's a logical question but you know
[40:02] within the midst of that time God he
[40:05] cares there's things that we cannot you
[40:08] cannot understand we're not able to
[40:12] explain that when you look at God's
[40:14] sovereignty you can take God's
[40:16] sovereignty throughout the scriptures
[40:18] and you'll witness sometimes his
[40:20] sovereignty who will permit lives to
[40:24] walk into a fiery furnace and then other
[40:27] times he'll keep lives out of it that's
[40:30] God's sovereignty we don't try to
[40:32] explain that and as I've said over and
[40:35] over with things sometimes they come
[40:37] come about
[40:38] we never get over it but God gives us
[40:43] grace to get through it and I said it
[40:47] like this last night when I was talking
[40:49] with the deacon that was their brother
[40:52] and I said you know I think of what
[40:54] David said when that little boy said you
[40:57] know here was a boy said this was
[40:59] conceived and under the wrong manner
[41:02] said but yet look at God's grace to that
[41:05] child that child went right into the
[41:07] presence of God
[41:08] David lifted himself up off of the
[41:10] ground and he says after it had passed
[41:13] and he says they cannot come to where I
[41:16] am but I can go to where it is
[41:21] and you know let's just pray that God
[41:24] will just give that comfort
[41:26] he's a comforter isn't he let's just
[41:30] pray it's a you know those of you are
[41:32] standing as a mother this morning you
[41:34] know that God can use your prayer this
[41:36] morning to reach to that need as you
[41:40] would enter a new father you'll be able
[41:42] to enter in on behalf of that on behalf
[41:44] of these other two needs that we're
[41:46] gonna pray over let's just pray together

[46:58] Lord but you can express what needs to
[47:01] be expressed this morning Lord and may
[47:03] God you find Lord in our hearts hearts
[47:06] that are open and receptive Lord to
[47:08] receive from you Lord o Lord we love you
[47:11] this morning Lord may you just come Lord

[47:17] pray in the name of the Lord Jesus
[47:19] Christ amen amen
[47:28] amen god bless you
[47:34] just want to remind you is returning in
[47:37] the scriptures here if you could go to
[47:41] salve for Samuel 13 with me please
[47:48] just want to remind you be a
[47:51] prayer-meeting again this coming Tuesday
[47:53] evening
[47:54] there'll be no service this coming
[47:57] Thursday in preparation for the meetings
[48:01] let's just be in prayer amen for the
[48:06] services I've heard the prayer requests
[48:08] already that's went up and you know when
[48:12] we have meetings that are set aside
[48:13] that's like this we don't do this to
[48:17] take up time we don't do it to take up
[48:21] time
[48:24] but we we set aside a time just to be
[48:29] able to be gathered together with a
[48:32] special purpose in mind I believe any
[48:34] every time we come to the house of God
[48:36] there is we come here with expectation
[48:39] we come together in these times of
[48:42] special meetings and I think how brother
[48:44] Branham expressed it and mighty God
[48:45] unveiled before us we come together and
[48:48] we putting our licks of fire together
[48:50] and there are needs that law in this in
[48:53] this moment there will be special needs
[48:55] that God will come on the scene and
[48:57] you'll meet those needs I believe that
[49:01] I'm expecting that with all my heart
[49:03] that God will direct the ministering of
[49:06] the word direct the services however
[49:07] that he wants to take it and it'll be a
[49:10] very special very special time within
[49:13] our lives because of him and we want to
[49:15] give ourselves to the Lord even in
[49:17] prayer throughout the week and being
[49:19] here in the services of the Lord you
[49:22] make every effort to be here because
[49:24] remember these services they're there
[49:25] they're for you they're for me they're
[49:28] for us as an assembly sure we'll have
[49:30] visitors and I know there's visitors
[49:32] already coming from other places but
[49:34] remember we're coming together here to
[49:37] receive from the Lord when the very
[49:39] first thing before they ever walked out
[49:41] of Egypt and a deliverance it was
[49:42] already made known when the Moses was
[49:44] told by God to tell them we want to go
[49:47] out in a three day's journey and offer
[49:50] feast unto the Lord and you see that
[49:52] very thing they were set aside for that
[49:54] purpose and even fail hardened himself
[49:57] and would not and said I will not allow
[49:59] you to go out and worship you know Satan
[50:02] knows exactly when we go through
[50:05] different things in our life he knows
[50:07] when these types of things come about
[50:09] when meetings are set brother and sister
[50:11] this is a time to really just be
[50:13] consecrated to God that God would just
[50:16] come among us and move and all of
[50:19] everything that can be about our lives
[50:22] God is able through that ministering of
[50:25] the word through his presence coming at
[50:27] that time he's able to relieve
[50:29] oppression he's able to relieve bondage
[50:32] you believe that he's able to fill with
[50:35] the Holy Ghost he knew all of that this
[50:37] morning that's true but you take three
[50:39] services times where we're just focused
[50:41] in
[50:42] just consecrate it in if I had my way we
[50:46] would have three services like that
[50:47] every week but I did whatever we can do
[50:52] within that but it let's set let's let
[50:54] our hearts be set aside within that and
[50:57] let go on let's just invite him to come
[50:58] on the scene make every effort to be
[51:01] here I've heard the announcements about
[51:03] helping out and so forth let's just tell
[51:07] you last year when when I witnessed you
[51:10] know we were not able to get in the
[51:13] building right away you remember when
[51:14] that happened last year and then you
[51:17] know it really was something even as
[51:20] brother bill testified you know within
[51:22] and he said I you know finally when
[51:24] everybody got there they opened the
[51:26] building and you just see everybody just
[51:28] pitching in and I'll tell you why it was
[51:32] a wonderful time you would have never
[51:34] known and if you showed up a few moments
[51:37] late and after all the table was laid
[51:39] out beautifully in the food and all
[51:40] those things you'd have never known it's
[51:43] just like we walked out of the service
[51:45] some of you were there you you were
[51:46] there waiting outside you had your green
[51:47] beans in your hands and you know
[51:49] everything else and so forth and you
[51:50] know you were waiting and and here I'll
[51:52] come out and we can't get a hold of the
[51:54] lady
[51:55] we can't get ahold of her the place
[51:58] isn't opened I said oh my well let's
[52:01] find a pastor but you know God moved on
[52:08] it you know just something I don't know
[52:10] how we're gonna do it but I know it's
[52:11] the enemy fighting the enemy fighting
[52:14] and so you know we just we're just so
[52:17] thankful to the Lord and I just
[52:19] appreciate each and every one of you and
[52:21] well let's let's read because I can
[52:24] stand here and talk to you
[52:25] let's read here let's do for sake of
[52:28] time just go to verse 11 for Samuel 13
[52:31] 11 and here is Samuel speaking to Saul
[52:35] what hast thou done and Saul said
[52:39] because I saw that the people were
[52:42] scattered from me and that thou camest
[52:44] not within the days appointed and that
[52:47] the Philistines gathered themselves
[52:48] together at McMath may God bless you as
[52:51] you're being seated bless His Word and
[52:54] let me just keep on reading here just a
[52:56] few scriptures therefore said I the
[53:00] Philistines will come down upon me to
[53:03] Gilgo and I have not made supplication
[53:05] unto the Lord I forced myself therefore
[53:09] and offered a burnt offering now you'll
[53:13] notice just in that that phrase I forced
[53:16] myself anytime where it's us forcing
[53:20] ourselves itself sometimes you can this
[53:25] can be gather and I want you to
[53:27] understand this here sometimes pressure
[53:29] itself can come just when someone could
[53:32] say to you well you know they want you
[53:36] to do something and so here they'll
[53:38] maybe give you a scripture or they'll
[53:40] give you this and they want you to do it
[53:43] and you know it's just like sometimes
[53:44] you can have the the pressure and things
[53:47] like this where people say well if you
[53:50] really have love in your heart if you
[53:51] had love in your heart this is what
[53:53] you'd be doing I'm just saying to you in
[53:56] this in this manner God's Word is always
[53:59] true
[54:01] but God never intended for us just to
[54:05] simply do his word or to somewhat seem
[54:10] to do it without our heart in it before
[54:13] the word can ever take effect it must be
[54:18] our heart that's in that word and that's
[54:22] why within things sometimes there could
[54:24] be pressures of trying to arrange things
[54:26] and get things together but you see it's
[54:29] just like this as I was just speaking
[54:31] you know when we look at healing and you
[54:34] look at healings sometimes and I'm just
[54:36] speaking some in a place where just
[54:38] ministering and just spoke on healing
[54:40] and you know sometimes when there can be
[54:42] even divisions and other things that are
[54:44] taking place or you know even within a
[54:47] family or within a church or whatever
[54:48] more you know the one of the first signs
[54:50] of healing is things that it takes place
[54:53] where your heart longs for healing
[54:57] that's that's where it has to be healing
[55:01] has to long from within the heart when
[55:03] God the Bible says concerning this when
[55:06] Israel is restored and when Israel comes
[55:09] comes to that of the Lord to know the
[55:12] Lord and to know him in the true
[55:13] atonement the Bible says in the Book of
[55:16] Isaiah that when he comes Envy will be
[55:19] removed it speaks of how that God stirs
[55:22] their heart up and their heart begins to
[55:25] look for him the Bible says in the Book
[55:27] of Ezekiel concerning that of Israel he
[55:30] says I'll take that which is two sticks
[55:32] and I'll make it one stick you see why
[55:35] will that be because the application of
[55:38] Jeremiah 29:19 when you shall seek me
[55:41] with all your heart then I shall be
[55:43] found of you so God brings healing from
[55:48] that of the inside first so I say to
[55:50] this this morning if you have a desire
[55:52] and a longing for healing and a desire
[55:55] just as I gave that example in the word
[55:57] when you have a desire for it then you
[56:00] are in a place that God is able to move
[56:03] to bring that to pass
[56:08] otherwise it becomes us forcing
[56:12] ourselves let me just say this very
[56:15] clearly we don't want to do something
[56:17] simply because it's just well this is
[56:20] what it says do we want to go according
[56:23] to the word and submit our hearts to him
[56:25] but that's how we go according to the
[56:27] word is submit our heart to him and we
[56:31] can look at things and say Lord remedy
[56:33] my heart let everything within my spirit
[56:37] let it all be lined up to match what the
[56:41] conditions are called for in the promise
[56:44] you see God word sovereignly as we were
[56:47] looking at this last week God saw moved
[56:50] in a place to where he felt the pressure
[56:53] and he began to look around him instead
[56:56] of just saying this is what God told me
[56:58] to do and what God told me to do he said
[57:02] he would meet me here and I'm just going
[57:04] to stay here but instead Saul took the
[57:08] pressures and through reasoning he
[57:10] actually before he ever moved to offer
[57:14] up the burnt offering which was not his
[57:16] place it was not his position he already
[57:22] was being moved to that in his heart
[57:25] through reasoning fear and all and all
[57:28] of that works together with doubt and
[57:30] worry all of those things come together
[57:32] and he was being moved within that place
[57:35] instead of standing on the word of God
[57:43] think of when God spoke to Abraham
[57:45] wouldn't this just let's just kind of
[57:47] finishing this point here with meeting
[57:50] God and his promise
[57:51] think of how God spoke to Abraham each
[57:53] time and he told Abraham come out to a
[57:55] land I'll show you
[57:57] Abraham had to journey out in order for
[57:59] God to show him he had to meet him in
[58:02] the word that God had spoken then you
[58:05] think of it as we would you know move
[58:07] forward here so many years to where here
[58:09] is here is Isaac fifteen years after
[58:12] after coming forth here he is as a 15
[58:15] year old young man packing the wood up
[58:17] the mountain and to think of how that
[58:20] Abraham at that time was asked by God go
[58:23] and offer up Isaac not only the only Son
[58:26] go offer him up and I and Abraham went
[58:31] according to the commandment of the Lord
[58:33] not questioning anything that's a
[58:40] paradox let me say this to you it's the
[58:44] same way of a paradox in your life and
[58:47] in my life and that is God's working it
[58:50] was not Abraham that brought himself to
[58:54] that place it was God by His grace
[58:58] moving in Abraham's life Abraham had to
[59:01] repent a lot Abraham had to make things
[59:04] right
[59:04] Abraham had to you know focus even
[59:07] beyond the misunderstandings of the
[59:09] promise but yet within it all this is
[59:12] the paradox Abraham's faith grew to the
[59:16] place that God could see what laid in
[59:19] Abraham all it takes is a maturing of
[59:23] that faith and God matured that faith in
[59:27] Abraham to where Abraham could stand
[59:29] there on Mount Moriah and offer up their
[59:33] Isaac and he was ready to draw back the
[59:35] hand and remember even to that very
[59:38] moment but here the age of the Lord
[59:41] would speak in that moment and say
[59:43] Abraham stay thy hand for in this I'll
[59:47] know that thou lovest me and thou
[59:50] fearest me
[59:52] how that God met Abraham right there in
[59:55] the promise of the word you see this is
[59:59] where it comes that with whatever that
[1:00:01] God has spoke to our heart sometimes
[1:00:03] when God speaks to our heart in the
[1:00:06] service it may be things that we don't
[1:00:08] feel or seem like maybe it's just so
[1:00:11] spiritual but yet it's something that
[1:00:13] has spoke to our hearts let your heart
[1:00:16] be loosed to that and just obey it and
[1:00:19] you watch God come on the scene you know
[1:00:22] the Bible says where we were reading
[1:00:23] last week in in the Book of Numbers
[1:00:25] their numbers 29 and it speaks of how
[1:00:28] that they were given charge is there to
[1:00:30] that of the Levites and each one had
[1:00:32] their charge and you know and I the word
[1:00:34] that I think I was searching for last
[1:00:36] week is how it was words that they were
[1:00:39] there were different ones in the Levites
[1:00:41] who were Porter's or keepers and some
[1:00:44] had to tend to the fine flour some had
[1:00:46] to tend to the vessels but all of them
[1:00:48] had their post of duty and their
[1:00:52] responsibility if one let down it would
[1:00:56] affect the supernatural working of
[1:00:59] Almighty God the Bible says right down
[1:01:02] through that in numbers 29 where we
[1:01:04] looked at it last week it speaks of the
[1:01:06] commandment of the Lord but to realize
[1:01:08] that the supernatural it does not work
[1:01:11] outside of the commandment of the Lord
[1:01:13] but the supernatural works in
[1:01:15] conjunction in unity with the
[1:01:17] commandment of the Lord you know the
[1:01:19] Bible says that he gives the Holy Ghost
[1:01:21] to them that obey Him the Bible is very
[1:01:24] clear that God he loves obedience and
[1:01:27] just simple obedience just simply take
[1:01:30] him at his word and we stand on that and
[1:01:33] just doing our part doing our part has
[1:01:35] an assembly each and every one of us as
[1:01:37] we come together each and every one of
[1:01:40] us here maintaining our position but God
[1:01:44] has called us to then within that right
[1:01:46] there there's times of some things as
[1:01:48] we'll look at it here in just a few
[1:01:50] moments that sometimes there's things
[1:01:52] that are being done that if we're not
[1:01:54] careful we don't give the value to what
[1:01:57] God has purposed in our life and we
[1:02:00] begin to look and we're looking at the
[1:02:02] supernatural and failed to recognize
[1:02:04] that
[1:02:05] commandment itself following his word is
[1:02:08] what invites him to come on the scene
[1:02:11] you see when we consider the Gov
[1:02:13] promises that God has fulfilled in this
[1:02:16] our brother branham you know would make
[1:02:18] a statement you know any ease dealing
[1:02:20] with this in the Topeka Kansas series
[1:02:22] and he says that many other times but
[1:02:24] he's dealing with the people that they
[1:02:25] might recognize the presence of God and
[1:02:27] brother Branham was letting him know he
[1:02:29] said before I called the prayer line he
[1:02:31] said I'm gonna call the prayer line he
[1:02:33] said but before I do that he said I want
[1:02:35] to make sure he said there are seeds
[1:02:37] that are sown so that you know exactly
[1:02:40] what to expect and then how when you go
[1:02:43] forth from here so that you're healing
[1:02:46] it stays with you so he's bringing this
[1:02:51] out here within that time that how that
[1:02:54] you know within it the word itself being
[1:02:57] sown and as we'll live under that word
[1:02:59] then that invites the supernatural to
[1:03:02] come on the scene now be honest with you
[1:03:05] many times and with all of us we would
[1:03:07] like to see that of the supernatural we
[1:03:10] love the supernatural we love how that
[1:03:12] God moves but you see God will only move
[1:03:15] through him by his word well we're not
[1:03:17] interested in a work of and that's not
[1:03:19] what the bride is is about we enjoy we
[1:03:22] love the moving of the Holy Ghost we
[1:03:24] enjoy how the Holy Spirit moves but
[1:03:26] remember he moves the spirit itself is
[1:03:29] the current that moves through the
[1:03:31] conduit of the word so where the word is
[1:03:34] preached then the Holy Spirit can come
[1:03:36] behind it is that right so now when we
[1:03:39] when we would look at this here within
[1:03:42] the word and I want to continue on that
[1:03:44] this morning as we look at Romans 12 on
[1:03:46] maintaining your position and when we
[1:03:50] look at this that although there were
[1:03:52] charges that were given to each one of
[1:03:55] them within Israel just as there are
[1:03:57] charges that are given and
[1:03:59] responsibilities for each and every one
[1:04:02] of us it is very very important that we
[1:04:05] do not allow or try to take as it were a
[1:04:08] gift or an attribute of talent whatever
[1:04:10] God has placed there within our life and
[1:04:13] tried to operate it on our own strength
[1:04:17] it must be God to operate it to bring it
[1:04:21] forth to his glory it doesn't matter you
[1:04:23] know well what it would be it has to be
[1:04:26] that it's surrendered to him you know I
[1:04:28] think about it it's the glory of God for
[1:04:31] him to manifest himself through the
[1:04:33] housewife in her position in Christ and
[1:04:35] every family office in every ministerial
[1:04:38] office and every member of the body of
[1:04:40] Jesus Christ now I want you to watch
[1:04:42] this here in verse 1 we ended here last
[1:04:45] week but I want to pick up here in verse
[1:04:47] 1 and Paul said I beseech you therefore
[1:04:49] brethren by the mercies of God that you
[1:04:53] present your bodies a living sacrifice
[1:04:56] holy and acceptable unto God which is
[1:05:02] your reasonable service now nobody can
[1:05:06] do that but you nobody can do this but
[1:05:11] me brethren by the mercies of God you
[1:05:15] see God's mercy grants to us what's
[1:05:19] needed in order for us to be able to
[1:05:23] take that apply it to our lives that we
[1:05:26] might present our bodies acceptable unto
[1:05:29] Him how holy acceptable unto God which
[1:05:32] is your reasonable service you realize
[1:05:34] that this even when we look at the
[1:05:37] Levitical priesthood each one of them
[1:05:39] this was the duty and responsibility
[1:05:41] that they would keep themselves in a
[1:05:44] place that God would be at liberty to
[1:05:47] come down and to use them according to
[1:05:51] what he had appointed them to just
[1:05:53] because they were appointed to this
[1:05:55] office or to this position or they had
[1:05:57] this it didn't mean that it was just
[1:05:59] something that it was just going to take
[1:06:01] place but rather within that to value it
[1:06:04] and to make yourself available that God
[1:06:07] Himself can come down and use the gift
[1:06:10] and you please and use that attribute
[1:06:12] that he's placed within your life now
[1:06:15] look out look out verse 2 goes on it
[1:06:17] says and be not conformed to this world
[1:06:20] but be you transformed by the renewing
[1:06:24] of your mind that you may prove what is
[1:06:27] that good and acceptable
[1:06:30] and perfect will of God amen that that
[1:06:35] speaks in verse two of the expression of
[1:06:38] that word in our lives
[1:06:41] that's the expression of the word in our
[1:06:44] lives look in verse three here now
[1:06:47] here we get down into service for I say
[1:06:50] through the grace given unto me to every
[1:06:53] man that is among you not to think of
[1:06:56] himself more highly than he ought to
[1:07:00] think
[1:07:03] Paul knows that's a problem the Spirit
[1:07:07] of God knows that's a problem not to
[1:07:11] think more highly of himself than he
[1:07:14] ought to think how could that be how
[1:07:16] could that get to a place it can come to
[1:07:19] a place if we begin to look at the
[1:07:22] things that things maybe that we're
[1:07:23] seeing things that we're looking at
[1:07:25] things that maybe we don't have
[1:07:27] difficulties but we see it in in some
[1:07:29] other thing and if we begin to look at
[1:07:31] that and look at it in a manner as
[1:07:33] though it's something that we have done
[1:07:35] and we find ourselves beginning to
[1:07:38] become elevated and it's not God
[1:07:40] elevating us it's us elevating ourselves
[1:07:44] but every man and here's how Paul deals
[1:07:48] with it let every man not think more
[1:07:50] highly of himself than he ought to think
[1:07:53] but to think soberly my so the contrast
[1:07:59] if you're not you're thinking more
[1:08:02] highly of yourself you're intoxicated on
[1:08:05] something you're thinking too much about
[1:08:09] you but let every man think soberly
[1:08:13] according as God hath dealt to every man
[1:08:18] the measure of faith it's God that had
[1:08:20] dealt a measure of faith it is not you
[1:08:23] that dealt it to yourself let me say
[1:08:26] this everything that God by His grace
[1:08:28] has allowed you to see it is truly
[1:08:32] because of his grace it is something
[1:08:35] that when we look at it but when we look
[1:08:38] at friends with revelation revelation
[1:08:40] itself and this is something that is not
[1:08:43] new to us but real true revelation does
[1:08:46] not make us puffed up that's what
[1:08:50] knowledge does
[1:08:54] revelation brings humility because we
[1:08:57] recognize it's our little nough sits
[1:09:00] God's greatness if it wasn't for him we
[1:09:04] wouldn't see what we see and that
[1:09:07] revelation breaks within our heart see
[1:09:09] how it all works together so that here
[1:09:12] then we stand to present ourselves as a
[1:09:15] living sacrifice unto God look in verse
[1:09:22] 4 for as many have members for as we
[1:09:27] have many members in one body and all
[1:09:30] members have not the same office so we
[1:09:34] being many are one body in Christ and
[1:09:38] every one members one of another having
[1:09:44] then gifts differing according to the
[1:09:47] grace that is given to us whether
[1:09:51] prophecy let us let us prophesy
[1:09:54] according to the proportion of faith
[1:10:00] so apologist wrote about the different
[1:10:02] measures of faith then he's dealing with
[1:10:05] that of the proportions of faith the
[1:10:07] same thing it let us operate according
[1:10:11] to what God has ordained and chose for
[1:10:15] our lives God listen now God he had he
[1:10:19] had chose Saul
[1:10:20] to be king remember that he wouldn't
[1:10:24] remember when everything itself is
[1:10:26] falling away from Saul God reminded him
[1:10:28] through Samuel when that was called
[1:10:30] what's thou not little in 9 own eyes but
[1:10:35] you see Saul got away from littleness in
[1:10:38] his own eyes slowly and yet it wasn't
[1:10:43] something that Saul was somewhat
[1:10:45] announcing but Saul got away from the
[1:10:49] position that God was had there anointed
[1:10:52] him for now listen to me he was anointed
[1:10:55] as king of Israel he was anointed but
[1:11:00] ninny in the midst of a situation this
[1:11:03] was a testing and a trying time for Saul
[1:11:06] that under pressure was Saul gonna stay
[1:11:09] with the word or word he succumbed to
[1:11:12] pressure pressure is not what brings and
[1:11:18] invites God as far as us succumbing to
[1:11:21] that that does not invite God on the
[1:11:24] scene to fulfill his word and to think
[1:11:28] of how that within where Paul would let
[1:11:31] this be mentioned you know as Saul stood
[1:11:33] as a king Saul was a blessing as he
[1:11:35] could stand as a king but when Saul
[1:11:37] intruded and stepped over into that and
[1:11:40] tried to occupy the office of a prophet
[1:11:43] he was out of the will of God
[1:11:46] I don't care how light the sacrifice
[1:11:50] looked I don't care how orderly and look
[1:11:53] he was out of the will of God he was out
[1:11:56] of position and God was not responsible
[1:12:01] this is live being in the will of God it
[1:12:05] ought to be the very a goal that we seek
[1:12:10] for it ought to be what we labor for and
[1:12:13] in France this is where that was prayer
[1:12:15] itself it comes in within it Lord let me
[1:12:19] stay in the center of your will not just
[1:12:22] letting it be something while I'm a
[1:12:24] believer you know the footsteps of the
[1:12:26] righteous are ordered and God's just
[1:12:27] going to open this there God doesn't
[1:12:29] work through a haphazard attitude it's
[1:12:32] got to be something where you are
[1:12:34] purpose in your life and purposed in my
[1:12:36] life Lord I want to be in your will and
[1:12:39] sometimes friends when we look at being
[1:12:41] in God's will it is in something then
[1:12:44] we're always waiting for God to come and
[1:12:46] say get out there I've already told you
[1:12:48] about it that isn't it at all because
[1:12:50] there ain't no reward in that but there
[1:12:52] being in God's will if you look at the
[1:12:54] first part of this scripture that we're
[1:12:56] reading it is simply to make sure that
[1:12:59] we are ready as vessels to be used of
[1:13:03] God let us be vessels that he can use
[1:13:08] they're reporters and keepers that had
[1:13:11] to make sure the vessel snuff dishes
[1:13:13] whatever was that had to be ready to be
[1:13:16] used when it was needed let me tell you
[1:13:19] something God desires within every life
[1:13:23] that it's ready to be used when he's
[1:13:25] ready to use it so being in the will of
[1:13:28] God many times we're looking for things
[1:13:31] without making preparation for God's
[1:13:34] will to move in let me give you another
[1:13:37] example God the Bible says he spoke to
[1:13:41] Noah and he warned Noah of an impending
[1:13:44] judgment God made known his will
[1:13:47] judgment is going to fall prepare an art
[1:13:50] for the saving of the house if Noah
[1:13:53] would not have prepared an ark his
[1:13:56] family would have perished but you see
[1:13:59] when God spoke to him it raised faith in
[1:14:03] the voice of God of what God had
[1:14:06] commissioned and Noah had hard times
[1:14:09] there's times where he did not know how
[1:14:11] to turn that corner
[1:14:13] those clams II didn't know how to
[1:14:14] approach that child there's times he
[1:14:16] didn't know how to move in that
[1:14:18] household there's times he did not know
[1:14:21] what to do
[1:14:22] but he knew God had commissioned him to
[1:14:25] prepare an art so the Prophet said Noah
[1:14:29] himself he said he was building a
[1:14:33] miracle preparing for a miracle and he
[1:14:37] said the Church of the Living God is a
[1:14:39] living miracle preparing for a miracle
[1:14:44] you see it's walking in that word and
[1:14:47] doing what God said do I wonder I wonder
[1:14:50] where that were there days where Noah
[1:14:53] did not feel the rushing mighty wind
[1:14:55] where he didn't feel the presence of God
[1:14:58] but he kept on pounding away he kept
[1:15:02] laying in kept putting the pitch forward
[1:15:05] he kept doing it why because God said I
[1:15:08] have granted you mercy preparing art and
[1:15:11] the me tell you something I can say this
[1:15:14] we on the shadow of a doubt when that
[1:15:16] rain began to fall and then all of a
[1:15:19] sudden when that art began to take loose
[1:15:21] brother you think you talking about a
[1:15:24] day of Thanksgiving I don't that one
[1:15:26] moment that Noah was thinking God thank
[1:15:29] you Lord for the strength day by day to
[1:15:32] carry on when I didn't feel like it lord
[1:15:35] thank you Lord God that you gave me the
[1:15:37] strength Lord by your word what was Noah
[1:15:40] doing the same thing Abraham did and the
[1:15:42] same thing you do and the same thing I
[1:15:44] do we nurse from the strength of El
[1:15:47] Shaddai I so it's us being yielded in
[1:15:56] God's hands
[1:16:02] I don't know what to move I don't know
[1:16:04] where to do this so I don't know whether
[1:16:05] don't fret we've all been there friends
[1:16:09] I hope you're with me this morning we've
[1:16:11] all been there all of us what do i do do
[1:16:14] I do this or do I do that
[1:16:16] do I do this or do it you know and we
[1:16:18] don't know what to do not I don't know
[1:16:21] what to do many times I stand and and
[1:16:24] you know Here I am I I don't know what
[1:16:26] direction land what do you want me to
[1:16:27] Prince how do you want me to approach
[1:16:29] this how do you want me to handle this
[1:16:31] how do you want me to do this I wait on
[1:16:33] him that's the same thing you do it
[1:16:41] doesn't happen too often here but it has
[1:16:44] happened just even a few weeks ago I
[1:16:46] have services here that are studied out
[1:16:48] no here's to series here's to going what
[1:16:51] do I do
[1:16:51] I wanted to come this morning and finish
[1:16:55] out on Thursdays message on Sarah's
[1:17:01] visitation oh my I just said Lord what
[1:17:03] but you know what God knows what we need
[1:17:07] sometimes you're waiting and waiting and
[1:17:10] just looking there in the last moment
[1:17:12] and like Paul you're a saying to go do I
[1:17:15] go this way and you just test the waters
[1:17:17] and just wait for God to move and God to
[1:17:21] direct in that situation I'm time saying
[1:17:26] this to you as one believer to another
[1:17:28] he is faithful I don't care if it comes
[1:17:34] down to the last moment he has proved
[1:17:37] that in his word over and over he's
[1:17:40] faithful to his word when you stand on
[1:17:44] his word he'll meet you there
[1:17:54] you're not defeated
[1:17:56] you're not defeated no sane man I don't
[1:18:00] you're not defeated it's not about
[1:18:02] feelings you hear times you got to cast
[1:18:04] them down
[1:18:05] you got to cast them down because
[1:18:07] that'll try to hinder you being yielded
[1:18:11] the enemy will try to say all sorts of
[1:18:14] things because if he can get you rattled
[1:18:16] then you're not yielded I know it ain't
[1:18:24] very deep but I just I just want to
[1:18:26] follow him
[1:18:32] notice the scripture here in verse 6
[1:18:34] having then gifts differing according to
[1:18:37] the grace that is given to us
[1:18:42] problem where their prophecy let us
[1:18:44] prophesy according to the proportion of
[1:18:46] faith God even shows within this
[1:18:50] scripture there's varying degrees within
[1:18:58] gifts there's varying degrees that's why
[1:19:02] the Bible said this is why Paul would
[1:19:04] speak to the Corinthian Corinthians and
[1:19:06] a bad problem
[1:19:08] of comparing people to people they had a
[1:19:12] bad problem of either comparing
[1:19:14] themselves to one another I both said
[1:19:15] they that do that our fools because
[1:19:19] you're comparing your flesh to another
[1:19:21] flesh it's not about the flesh it's the
[1:19:29] density of Christ inside that flesh its
[1:19:36] proportion of faith God has many gifts
[1:19:39] many talents and then even in all of our
[1:19:42] lives even as husbands every husband is
[1:19:45] not the same every wife is not the same
[1:19:50] every father is not the same every
[1:19:53] mother's not the same
[1:20:04] you know it's like a last week when it
[1:20:06] just drops in my heart within it
[1:20:08] sometimes we're we're defeated if we get
[1:20:11] into our imagination and get to looking
[1:20:13] at somebody else l don't want you to be
[1:20:16] like nobody else I hope you understand
[1:20:21] me
[1:20:21] God don't want you to be like brother
[1:20:23] branham when you carry your Bible in a
[1:20:27] certain way and you know brother Branham
[1:20:29] was always this and brother brother God
[1:20:30] don't once God don't want you to be like
[1:20:32] brother Samuel he don't want you to be
[1:20:34] like brother so-and-so and sister he
[1:20:35] don't want you well I want to be a wife
[1:20:37] like so-and-so God don't want you
[1:20:39] looking at nobody else to sit there and
[1:20:42] say I want to be like that but rather
[1:20:44] say Lord how you use her and it seems
[1:20:48] Lord she's just so yielded to you help
[1:20:50] me to be yielded to you for what you
[1:20:54] have ordained from me because God has
[1:20:57] put talents in your life we're living in
[1:21:03] the hour do not despise small things
[1:21:07] small things brought together bring a
[1:21:11] big fire hallelujah I know maybe polish
[1:21:19] and snuff dishes you know if I'm
[1:21:21] polishing the snuff this maybe you know
[1:21:23] nobody sees that but let me tell you
[1:21:25] something if I don't polish the snuff
[1:21:27] dishes that are committed to me that I'm
[1:21:29] hindering the rest of the body I've got
[1:21:34] a party if if my duty is to make fine
[1:21:36] flour I might say oh my I want to be the
[1:21:39] one you know that's cutting the neck up
[1:21:41] on the lamb there I'd like to be the one
[1:21:43] that has the blood or or the one that
[1:21:45] sent me you know if I just do the fine
[1:21:47] flower it's something that's made
[1:21:49] available that God can come on the scene
[1:21:54] I know it's behind the scenes it's
[1:21:56] things that are not seen but after all
[1:21:59] this is not a public show
[1:22:03] he that heíd of himself in secret and
[1:22:07] pray unto God that all scripture Matthew
[1:22:13] sit where it's speaking of that of the
[1:22:16] operation of the third pole of the
[1:22:19] operation of the word is where that
[1:22:21] people are relieved from people and it's
[1:22:27] about pleasing God completely
[1:22:32] that's who you're to please
[1:22:34] that's who I'm to please and as you hide
[1:22:39] yourself away nobody see you cleanest
[1:22:41] enough dishes nobody hear about the fine
[1:22:43] flour but when it's needed it'll be
[1:22:48] there God said he that hide of himself
[1:22:50] away yeah and I will reward him openly
[1:23:00] it's a simplicity of us presenting
[1:23:04] ourselves within the word I say the
[1:23:07] simplicity because as Paul addressed
[1:23:09] even in that earlier part right there
[1:23:10] the battle is us getting over ourselves
[1:23:14] the battle is us not taking a complex
[1:23:21] well I want to be used like so-and-so
[1:23:23] just be used how God wants you to be
[1:23:24] used
[1:23:35] brother BAM standing at Oral Roberts
[1:23:37] place here he is standing here looking
[1:23:41] around they got machines open in the
[1:23:42] letters open him up and you know empty
[1:23:45] him out and on and on and man seeing the
[1:23:49] marble and everything else brother Bram
[1:23:51] said I thought of my little trailer he
[1:23:55] said I wouldn't know boy nobody seen my
[1:23:57] office
[1:24:01] and he said I got to thinking you could
[1:24:04] finish the quote for me Lord maybe it's
[1:24:07] because you don't trust me
[1:24:15] you know what I'm talking about you can
[1:24:19] get to looking at other situation let me
[1:24:21] tell you something friends let me tell
[1:24:22] you it's a church don't you get your
[1:24:24] eyes on the outside of somebody else you
[1:24:27] keep your eyes on Jesus Christ you keep
[1:24:33] your eyes on Jesus Christ if you get
[1:24:35] your eyes on somebody else somebody else
[1:24:37] becomes your Holy Ghost somebody else
[1:24:40] becomes your leadership our leadership
[1:24:46] is by the Holy Spirit coming through the
[1:24:49] word that's our source of comfort but he
[1:25:00] says to him look up see what he was
[1:25:05] looking at was was affecting him maybe
[1:25:09] I'm not as good maybe I'm not as they're
[1:25:11] saying maybe I'm not as that but the
[1:25:13] Holy Spirit said look up
[1:25:15] I am your portion this is why the Bible
[1:25:21] says in Christ who is our life he said
[1:25:24] he who is our life set if you be risen
[1:25:27] with Christ set your affections on
[1:25:30] things above brother man would say it
[1:25:34] like this
[1:25:34] in the message he would say who can
[1:25:36] taking who can who can who taking
[1:25:38] thought can add one cubit to his stature
[1:25:40] now he says you can't make your hair
[1:25:42] black or white
[1:25:45] you are what you are by the grace of God
[1:25:51] God had did this not what you done when
[1:25:58] you try to make yourself something
[1:26:00] different
[1:26:03] I'd like to make myself a Billy Graham
[1:26:09] but it wouldn't do me no good I'd like
[1:26:12] to make myself a brother Mitchell stand
[1:26:16] up and preach like that or ern Baxter
[1:26:18] don't do no good I must be william
[1:26:22] branham
[1:26:26] look at this next part I've often
[1:26:28] thought about brother Roberts and those
[1:26:32] who pray for this day I've often thought
[1:26:33] about it same thing you have often
[1:26:39] thought about and I have often thought
[1:26:41] about things you know because everything
[1:26:43] when brother Branham was looking at this
[1:26:44] with Oral Roberts listen to me
[1:26:46] brother Branham knew one thing about it
[1:26:48] that you catch him one thing he is
[1:26:50] continuing to grow and to learn and his
[1:26:53] whole part is he wants to make sure that
[1:26:56] within that that God is fully using him
[1:27:00] to the full potential that's why he
[1:27:03] dealt with in the beginning of works was
[1:27:05] faith Express and he talked about he
[1:27:07] said when I started out as a young man
[1:27:09] he said you know he said I was swimming
[1:27:10] and by the time you got done you were he
[1:27:14] said but after a while you you learn how
[1:27:15] to make them strokes he said if you're
[1:27:19] not learning something's wrong
[1:27:23] you see with the gift and what God
[1:27:26] that's placed in your life family office
[1:27:28] ministerial gift every one of us our
[1:27:30] part in the body it ought to be there in
[1:27:33] the whole crowd it ought to be the
[1:27:35] opening and the land that the Spirit is
[1:27:38] moving in our life it ought to be where
[1:27:40] it's creating more of the yielding of
[1:27:43] self submitting self to the will of God
[1:27:50] for the glory of God not out I want to
[1:27:53] be the fine flower guy I want to be the
[1:27:55] snuff this guy I want to know just let
[1:27:59] me be God what you want me to be after
[1:28:04] all brother Branham would point people
[1:28:07] that you don't even know and I don't
[1:28:08] even know but how many times that we
[1:28:11] hear God moving there as we're listening
[1:28:13] to the message and brother banner would
[1:28:15] pull back a curtain and say it's because
[1:28:18] they have laid on their face day and
[1:28:20] night praying
[1:28:23] and then he would point back to back
[1:28:25] home and he would admonish the people it
[1:28:27] was just something he said pray for me
[1:28:30] when I go overseas but it's your prayers
[1:28:34] I'll tell you this right here every time
[1:28:37] when I stand there at a place if God
[1:28:39] wants me to go and help somewhere for
[1:28:42] the minister I'm counting on your
[1:28:43] prayers when you say 'mother Samuel I'm
[1:28:46] praying for you and I ask you to pray
[1:28:48] for me because I'm counting on those
[1:28:50] prayers because I don't know many times
[1:28:53] what God wants me to even minister
[1:28:55] sometimes I'm waiting there Lord what do
[1:28:57] you want for these people Lord can I
[1:29:05] just be honest with you years and years
[1:29:08] ago that has scared me to death but now
[1:29:16] by His grace I could look at a situation
[1:29:20] I say this for the girl glory of God and
[1:29:23] you could ask me what are you going to
[1:29:25] preach I can tell you I don't know some
[1:29:30] of you been with me in different times
[1:29:31] but the same in what direction you think
[1:29:33] you're good I don't know but I know this
[1:29:37] if he let me he'll meet me
[1:29:41] sometimes just come right at the last
[1:29:43] moment it had been something way way out
[1:29:45] there but how did God will bring her
[1:29:47] wrong in unction of something there and
[1:29:49] it'll just drop but you know what it's
[1:29:51] just being that do you think of how that
[1:29:53] the Prophet it came to such a place to
[1:29:56] where there he was standing in Sabino
[1:29:58] Canyon and the sword came down in his
[1:30:00] hand and he was commissioned go back and
[1:30:02] open the seven seals and he goes back to
[1:30:05] minister he preaches God hiding and rear
[1:30:08] hiding and simplicity revealing himself
[1:30:09] the same he preaches the breech and he
[1:30:12] stands her in the breech he said I don't
[1:30:13] know no more what the first silliest
[1:30:15] then nothing standing here tonight but
[1:30:17] you know what it was God promise I'll
[1:30:20] meet you there
[1:30:21] [Applause]
[1:30:24] if we'll follow his commandment it will
[1:30:27] invite the supernatural then next
[1:30:31] morning when brother Branham was
[1:30:32] standing along a certain line he said I
[1:30:35] was about ready to make a mistake but he
[1:30:38] came in the room you see standing in
[1:30:42] obedience it invites the angel of the
[1:30:45] Lord to come many times we want the
[1:30:55] angel of the Lord then we'll obey
[1:30:56] I know it's simple but I'm just saying
[1:31:02] it's just like this they shall lay hands
[1:31:04] on the sick and they shall recover
[1:31:05] that's God's Word the Bible says repent
[1:31:10] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:31:12] Jesus Christ for your sins and you shall
[1:31:14] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:16] that's God's promise the been said I've
[1:31:22] often thought about brother Roberts
[1:31:24] those who pray for the sick the way they
[1:31:25] did the way they did how these brethren
[1:31:29] go out and pray for a great host
[1:31:31] there's no kickbacks if they didn't pray
[1:31:33] for this one or that one
[1:31:35] but I can't be all Roberts God made oil
[1:31:39] Roberts what he is I have to be William
[1:31:42] Brennan and all Roberts can't be William
[1:31:44] Brennan so we are what we are by the
[1:31:47] grace of God so it's all set together in
[1:31:51] the church for the perfecting of the
[1:31:54] church the working together of the good
[1:31:57] for those who love God
[1:32:04] and I'm gonna tell you the gift and all
[1:32:08] that what's in your life it's for my
[1:32:10] benefit how you yield yourself to the
[1:32:17] Lord I benefit from it we benefit from
[1:32:22] the yielding as one another are yielded
[1:32:26] we benefit benefit from gifts that are
[1:32:30] yielded attributes that are yielded we
[1:32:36] benefit
[1:32:41] yeah somebody sings a song
[1:32:45] hey listen anything that's done in the
[1:32:48] Church of the Living God ought to be
[1:32:49] done for the edification of the body and
[1:32:52] then the Bible says in Ephesians if they
[1:32:55] believe it's Ephesians 5 it talks of how
[1:32:56] Ephesians 5 Ephesians 4 how did the body
[1:32:59] itself it maketh to the edifying of
[1:33:01] itself in love how does the body edify
[1:33:04] itself by receiving that edification
[1:33:08] into its life you know somebody can tell
[1:33:12] you they appreciate you but it depends
[1:33:14] on how you take it the word can come but
[1:33:18] it depends on how you take it well I'll
[1:33:21] you know how they they divide you're
[1:33:23] saying that and they didn't you listen
[1:33:26] you can hear all the criticism you can
[1:33:28] hear all the negativity but you need to
[1:33:30] also understand God has people that'll
[1:33:33] speak to your heart that'll encourage
[1:33:35] you
[1:33:35] that'll bless you that will encourage
[1:33:38] your walk with the Lord you say blessed
[1:33:41] God I don't need that you're lying you
[1:33:43] do need it if you just let go for a
[1:33:51] little bit and realize it with him that
[1:33:54] we all need encouragement one from
[1:33:56] another and that means even when you
[1:34:00] don't feel like encouraging somebody
[1:34:02] else a sacrifice is not a sacrifice
[1:34:07] unless it's a sacrifice there's
[1:34:10] sometimes you got to go out of your way
[1:34:13] and other times get out of your way Paul
[1:34:25] goes on to say or ministry let us wait
[1:34:28] on our ministry
[1:34:33] remember how many would tell brother
[1:34:35] brother branham now that we've received
[1:34:36] the Holy Ghost should we go ahead and go
[1:34:38] to school and learn how the preach and
[1:34:40] we should we look to receive gifts
[1:34:41] brother Graham said don't you do that
[1:34:46] you get yourself right out of the land
[1:34:48] out of the will of God stay before God
[1:34:51] if God wants you to do something he
[1:34:54] equips you to do what he's called you to
[1:34:57] do and believe me whatever he calls you
[1:35:00] to do you won't feel adequate but it's
[1:35:04] not your equipping he equips you let us
[1:35:11] wait on our ministry how many times
[1:35:14] through the scripture how many times you
[1:35:16] hear brother REM say now you know he
[1:35:17] says what I'm waiting on I'm waiting on
[1:35:20] him
[1:35:21] [Music]
[1:35:24] I believe there's times we need to wait
[1:35:27] more sometimes we have situations that
[1:35:33] are in your home you need to wait more
[1:35:37] as a husband sometimes you need to wait
[1:35:39] more as a dad wait more see part of the
[1:35:47] waiting is to make yourself more
[1:35:49] available if you're waiting turns to
[1:35:56] bitterness and resentment you're pushing
[1:35:58] him away I've been praying and God even
[1:36:01] answered I've been looking to God you
[1:36:04] see what it is God can't come on that
[1:36:06] attitude I can't move that way it takes
[1:36:11] a submissiveness to him
[1:36:14] in order for him to move let us wait on
[1:36:20] our ministry how do we wait how do you
[1:36:22] wait the Bible says waited pray wait on
[1:36:26] the Lord and he shall strengthen thine
[1:36:29] heart the Bible says in the book I
[1:36:32] believe it's a Book of Lamentations it
[1:36:34] is glory for a man to wait
[1:36:37] and go hope with an expectation that is
[1:36:40] coming to wait on the Lord and he shall
[1:36:44] renew that strength this is God's
[1:36:48] promise let us wait on our ministry or
[1:36:51] he that teacheth on teaching or he that
[1:36:53] exhorteth on exhortation he that giveth
[1:36:57] let him do it with simplicity he that
[1:37:01] ruleth with diligence he that showeth
[1:37:05] mercy with cheerfulness let Samuel you
[1:37:12] mean if God and moves upon my heart to
[1:37:16] go show mercy that's a part sure it's a
[1:37:19] part
[1:37:20] sure it's apart it's to maintain that
[1:37:25] position of what God has equipped and
[1:37:28] called us to do how many times as you
[1:37:30] know brother brems say I'm waiting on
[1:37:32] him you know the Bible tells us that how
[1:37:35] can they go preach the gospel except
[1:37:37] they be sent
[1:37:40] he's alright Peter would even speak to
[1:37:43] it I'm not going to read it that Peter
[1:37:44] would even speak and express that how
[1:37:47] that now he would express that the
[1:37:49] gospel is preached with the Holy Ghost
[1:37:51] sent down from heaven
[1:37:55] so the Holy Spirit delivering that word
[1:37:59] in acts 13 the Bible talks about there
[1:38:02] were certain prophets and acts 13 1
[1:38:05] certain prophets there in the in the
[1:38:07] church prophets and teachers and it goes
[1:38:09] through their names and the Bible says
[1:38:11] in verse 2 as they ministered to the
[1:38:14] Lord and fasted they were ministering to
[1:38:20] the Lord
[1:38:20] stay faithful and what God has called
[1:38:23] you to do I'm just gonna say this
[1:38:30] sometimes we get to looking at God's
[1:38:33] will and we look at it in the wrong way
[1:38:36] talk to him do digital's there some
[1:38:38] months ago you know there was a an
[1:38:40] individual I had come in contact with
[1:38:42] and they said well you know I don't know
[1:38:43] what God wants me to do with my life and
[1:38:45] you know I've went to college here and
[1:38:46] I've done this but you know I'm just I'm
[1:38:48] just praying right now I don't know what
[1:38:50] God wants me to do I said so what are
[1:38:52] you doing are you doing something right
[1:38:54] now are you going to school well no I'm
[1:38:57] just waiting on God to show me let me
[1:38:59] tell you from a personal testimony you
[1:39:02] know you need to get in school so what
[1:39:04] you need to do is present yourself and
[1:39:07] ask God to come and meet you
[1:39:13] sometimes we're waiting on God to push
[1:39:16] us into things
[1:39:17] God does not delight in pushing us see
[1:39:24] part of maturity this is part of
[1:39:26] maturity maturity is a well I could
[1:39:28] explain this and I can explain this and
[1:39:29] I can explain that there's times where
[1:39:31] people can explain all sorts of things
[1:39:32] but they've never matured in the ABCs of
[1:39:36] the gospel that's what's important
[1:39:42] that's what makes the word live you can
[1:39:47] know all the mystery but it's a hat
[1:39:49] those ABCs in your life always believe
[1:39:52] Christ but presents yourself and what's
[1:39:56] for God to show don't sin and don't do
[1:39:58] nothing
[1:40:05] you sisters sometimes you don't know
[1:40:07] what to make for dinner
[1:40:13] so what do you do do you just sit down
[1:40:16] and say well I'm just gonna wait huh I
[1:40:18] don't know what to do no you know what
[1:40:20] you do you started getting out cookbooks
[1:40:21] you start pulling out old recipes you
[1:40:25] start visiting some places that are
[1:40:28] familiar to you and about that time here
[1:40:33] with whatever the condition of the day
[1:40:34] is maybe it's a day you're all frazzled
[1:40:36] and all of a sudden it just drops
[1:40:39] this be a great day for casserole
[1:40:49] you gotta breathe got to be presenting
[1:40:52] yourself now listen those are simple
[1:40:55] natural examples but listen friends God
[1:40:58] can't do nothing if we don't present
[1:41:00] ourselves for us waiting it's us
[1:41:04] presenting ourselves but it's not
[1:41:06] presenting ourselves saying Lord I'll do
[1:41:09] this
[1:41:12] but that other I'm doing that ain't
[1:41:21] doing that
[1:41:22] Lord if you'll just let me be this I'll
[1:41:26] do it I'll serve you but that other no
[1:41:33] Lord I'm called for this over here and I
[1:41:38] know I can really be a benefit you miss
[1:41:43] words I know I can be a benefit the
[1:41:53] reality I is a hindrance you don't need
[1:42:01] nobody nobody needs a title to do
[1:42:03] anything you don't need a table
[1:42:08] well I don't seem specials that often I
[1:42:10] don't you don't need a title to do that
[1:42:13] just to be a surrendered vessel to God
[1:42:23] here's what they did in verse 2 they
[1:42:25] ministered to the Lord
[1:42:26] stayed before him in his presence and
[1:42:30] fasted
[1:42:33] boy when's the last time that's been
[1:42:36] done
[1:42:44] and the Holy Ghost said separate me
[1:42:46] Barnabas and Saul for the work there and
[1:42:48] to have called them and when they had
[1:42:51] fasted and prayed notice and when they
[1:42:53] had fasted and prayed and laid their
[1:42:55] hands on them they sent them away verse
[1:42:59] 4 look how God looks at this
[1:43:01] so they being sent forth by the Holy
[1:43:05] Ghost if anybody else just looking at it
[1:43:09] they say ah that was just man sending a
[1:43:12] man out nope that was people who were
[1:43:16] waiting on God and the body yielded
[1:43:20] themselves and after God said separate
[1:43:23] me Paul and Barnabas they continued
[1:43:25] praying and fasting and they laid their
[1:43:28] hands on them and sent them away and the
[1:43:31] Bible says the Holy Ghost sent them
[1:43:33] forth it was God working through the
[1:43:38] body in the midst of that time
[1:43:41] first Peter chapter four Bible says as
[1:43:46] every man hath received the gift even so
[1:43:48] Minister the same one to another as
[1:43:50] stewards of the manifold grace of God
[1:43:56] that word manifold is variegated
[1:43:59] variegated is anything multiple multiple
[1:44:02] colors multiple its manifold its
[1:44:08] variegated God the Holy Spirit listen to
[1:44:13] me the Holy Spirit it baptizes us into
[1:44:17] one body and I'll say like this you act
[1:44:20] like a Christian you talk like a
[1:44:23] Christian and you behave yourself like a
[1:44:25] Christian that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:44:28] does in the house of God I'm not just
[1:44:31] talking about these walls but the other
[1:44:35] thing the Holy Ghost will do is it will
[1:44:38] manifest itself according to the gift
[1:44:41] and the measure that's been given in the
[1:44:43] life for it to minister through your
[1:44:46] life
[1:44:58] what a brother brems said I can't have a
[1:45:00] place like well Robert so I ain't gonna
[1:45:01] do it I'm gonna do it
[1:45:07] now does they gonna help out at all
[1:45:13] winds are not blowing but that means
[1:45:15] seeds falling
[1:45:22] sometimes you got a plant seed in order
[1:45:24] for the rain to come
[1:45:30] you see it all not matter whether you
[1:45:33] sing every service or not it all not
[1:45:38] matter whether you pray every service or
[1:45:40] not
[1:45:41] you don't not matter any of those things
[1:45:43] you might say but say me this is all
[1:45:45] elementary this should all be well I'm
[1:45:47] just Bob just obeying him and I'm just
[1:45:49] letting you know that whether you do or
[1:45:51] whether you don't your part is just as
[1:45:54] vital in this service you're praying in
[1:45:59] this service as you sit there and you
[1:46:01] pray even as the word is coming forth
[1:46:04] how do you know that it's not your
[1:46:07] prayer as your setting they're
[1:46:09] submitting your heart that allow the
[1:46:11] Holy Spirit to move on other needs in
[1:46:14] the Assembly or do we just look at it
[1:46:18] and say Lord I'm here about me
[1:46:25] we've got to maintain our position do
[1:46:30] what God has called us to do
[1:46:34] God might have you know there might be
[1:46:36] somebody administrating them then they
[1:46:38] only Minister maybe like once or twice a
[1:46:41] year but if they'll do that faithfully
[1:46:43] God will bless them
[1:46:48] there's people right here sitting right
[1:46:50] here brothers and sisters in this church
[1:46:52] that don't have any title of a position
[1:46:57] but you know what
[1:46:58] they don't need one they haven't let it
[1:47:02] hinder them they've operated for the
[1:47:06] body when God has moved on their heart
[1:47:10] to this they did it they are obedient to
[1:47:15] the Lord
[1:47:17] I say God bless you
[1:47:25] sometime titles only make heads bigger
[1:47:35] I'm sorry I'm so simple but it's just
[1:47:37] the truth verse 11 if any man speak let
[1:47:42] him speak as the Oracles of God if any
[1:47:44] Minister let him do it has the ability
[1:47:47] with God giveth that God in all things
[1:47:50] may be glorified through Jesus Christ to
[1:47:53] whom be praised and Dominion for ever
[1:47:55] and ever
[1:47:58] Bertram goes into talking about a gift
[1:48:00] he said a gift it's not something you
[1:48:02] take and use it but a gift he said is
[1:48:07] what surrendered to God I tell you even
[1:48:13] with natural attributes in our life
[1:48:16] gifts and talents as a husband as a wife
[1:48:22] as a father as a mother it needs to be
[1:48:25] surrendered in God's hands I said it
[1:48:29] needs to be surrendered in God's hands
[1:48:32] walking under the leadership of the Holy
[1:48:36] Ghost not trying to perform things on
[1:48:40] our own
[1:48:44] but letting God sewing the word and
[1:48:48] inviting God to come on the scene
[1:48:52] sometimes we want to see things happen
[1:48:55] we all do there's certain change we want
[1:48:58] to see
[1:49:01] let us not be conformed to the world and
[1:49:03] go back and say I don't see it the way I
[1:49:06] want it so
[1:49:13] what glory is that where is faith that
[1:49:16] was in that where is service at within
[1:49:19] that
[1:49:26] a gift is not something that's taken and
[1:49:29] that's where it's manipulated with hands
[1:49:34] so many times I've said this years and
[1:49:36] years ago even before I was pastoring
[1:49:38] you know so many times the word and the
[1:49:41] phrase nickel ad anism it is used my
[1:49:45] it's used and everything every time that
[1:49:49] it's used it's um many times it's used
[1:49:51] in a manner of well a pastor controlling
[1:49:53] this in the past and I'm not saying
[1:49:55] there hadn't been situations been like
[1:49:57] that but this is why I look at friends
[1:49:59] the word itself you've got to be careful
[1:50:02] then it doesn't become as I've said
[1:50:04] before reverse Nick and lady anism where
[1:50:08] the congregation wants to control the
[1:50:11] pastor where people want to control
[1:50:15] what's going on that's the spirit of
[1:50:20] Nicolini anism sometimes you don't look
[1:50:25] at well how did that come in how did
[1:50:27] that white horse rider come in he come
[1:50:29] in innocently but this is a power prayer
[1:50:35] and fasting just like everybody that
[1:50:40] comes here hey they might come here and
[1:50:42] visit and I think of it like what
[1:50:44] brother Dan days ago he said you come
[1:50:46] here and you may not believe as we
[1:50:48] believe but we'll let you borrow our
[1:50:49] rules for the weekend
[1:50:50] I believe in Liberty of the Holy Ghost
[1:50:59] and so the brother that came here some
[1:51:02] months ago I told him I'm off as I said
[1:51:04] I'm gonna tell you why right now we
[1:51:05] believe in worship and we believe in the
[1:51:08] word and you obey the Lord we believe in
[1:51:14] it not wet blankets here we believe in
[1:51:18] that
[1:51:19] you'd be obedient to God you let God
[1:51:22] lead you and you preach the word we'll
[1:51:24] be right there with you sometimes you go
[1:51:31] to different churches and every church
[1:51:32] is sovereign my goodness you know I'm
[1:51:38] over there you know times when I've went
[1:51:39] well well not only when I was in Africa
[1:51:42] I'm down went down to South Carolina and
[1:51:45] the young people were down there with
[1:51:46] him they said we thought she was gonna
[1:51:47] get hit that's come off the black people
[1:51:50] run up to the platform praise God I mean
[1:51:52] almost right in the platform with me
[1:51:54] little if I come off the platform I'm
[1:51:55] surrounded they're just swinging the fit
[1:51:57] praise God Here I am preacher and right
[1:51:59] through not just sitting down they're
[1:52:01] everywhere they're rejoicing in the Lord
[1:52:04] there's some zippers service is
[1:52:07] different than this one are different
[1:52:08] than that one what do you know fit right
[1:52:10] in with them cuz I didn't have a problem
[1:52:15] where I had a problem with staying in
[1:52:17] that office back there I want to be out
[1:52:19] there on the floor with them every
[1:52:24] Church is sovereign that's why when you
[1:52:31] go anywhere you don't go anywhere and
[1:52:34] try to take this church as though it's a
[1:52:36] pattern and put it on some other church
[1:52:39] you'll hinder that service and you're
[1:52:42] hidden or God even speaking to you if
[1:52:45] they've got an hour and a half song
[1:52:46] service you clap your hands and get
[1:52:48] right in there and enjoy it if they take
[1:52:55] up paths and offering three times in one
[1:52:57] service you be right in there you
[1:53:02] understand what I'm saying
[1:53:03] it's things it's like that that that
[1:53:06] doesn't matter what matters is his
[1:53:11] presence him the word the Prophet was
[1:53:17] clear when you choose a church you
[1:53:20] choose it based on the word and the
[1:53:23] moving of the Holy Ghost
[1:53:25] that's how you choose a church boy a
[1:53:32] gift is not something that you put in
[1:53:35] your hand and try to operate but you get
[1:53:40] yourself out of the way
[1:53:41] sometimes that's that's the whole battle
[1:53:43] brother and that's the whole battle lord
[1:53:45] help me get out of the way you know many
[1:53:49] times you spend more time in prayer I'm
[1:53:51] telling you from experience god help me
[1:53:53] get out of the way
[1:53:53] help me get out of the way help me get
[1:53:56] out of the way the heart and learn
[1:53:58] everything Lord let it be clear let it
[1:54:00] be set aside help me get out of the way
[1:54:02] like a little wood goes this is the guy
[1:54:04] it's my enemy he's the one that gets in
[1:54:06] the way brother Brent would say many
[1:54:09] times thinks he can do something about
[1:54:12] it that's what a ministry said he don't
[1:54:19] preach what he wants to preach tell me
[1:54:25] you know what I'm talking about even as
[1:54:26] a father as a mother as a husband as a
[1:54:28] grand grandpa grandma sometimes there's
[1:54:30] things you're getting ready to say
[1:54:32] something and you
[1:54:35] well here's a battle going on do you
[1:54:39] know what it is the holy ghost reigning
[1:54:42] in that tongue
[1:54:43] it's ain't a moment it's ancient moment
[1:54:47] they're sitting the time but maybe what
[1:54:51] you're getting ready to say is the truth
[1:54:55] but it just hadn't been sweetened the
[1:55:03] Bible says speak the truth in love you
[1:55:10] know how it is when you you put your
[1:55:12] hand in the cookie dough I know it's not
[1:55:16] politically correct it's got raw egg
[1:55:17] it's still good you put it in there and
[1:55:19] you pull it out and say this means more
[1:55:22] vanilla in it sometimes before we start
[1:55:27] baking the cookies we need to check the
[1:55:29] ingredients we're putting in them before
[1:55:33] we start trying to do things we need to
[1:55:35] do some no Lord needs to be some more
[1:55:37] loves in here I'm not I'm not ready I'm
[1:55:40] not right for them this part right here
[1:55:41] no if this isn't just right right I need
[1:55:43] some more more humility right here Lord
[1:55:47] you'll never be wrong doing that because
[1:55:51] let me tell you something it in that
[1:55:53] you're waiting in that time for God to
[1:55:54] kick you you're making yourself
[1:55:56] available that it be right in season
[1:56:01] right in time God operates gifts at
[1:56:06] various degrees and various times and
[1:56:09] and so for I'd say I understand God for
[1:56:11] all the gifts he's put in the body
[1:56:12] I thank God for the body of Jesus Christ
[1:56:14] I really do I just all my ministry or
[1:56:18] gifts I'd love seeing the body operate
[1:56:22] that's the desires the body would
[1:56:25] operate
[1:56:27] my my my my I hope you understand what
[1:56:33] I'm saying
[1:56:34] I understand that I'm your pastor I
[1:56:37] understand we we maintain our positions
[1:56:39] we don't overstep bound but I also
[1:56:41] appreciate how you can take the unction
[1:56:42] of the Holy Ghost and you don't have to
[1:56:44] ask me can I fold up chairs but Samuel
[1:56:49] can I get the communion buckets you see
[1:56:52] a need and do it hey you just see some
[1:56:55] and move and do it but same you cannot
[1:56:59] call brother so-and-so I've seen that
[1:57:01] they weren't in church column you don't
[1:57:03] have to call me up and ask permission
[1:57:05] hope this alright if it's not it's free
[1:57:09] in hell you don't have to ask me that
[1:57:16] just be obedient to the Lord God lays on
[1:57:20] your heart to pray for somebody go pray
[1:57:22] for them you obey the Lord Amen if it's
[1:57:29] something you feel like you need to you
[1:57:31] know just to run by me and I'll pray
[1:57:32] with you while you go pray for them God
[1:57:37] uses the body amen that's why the Lord
[1:57:42] comes forth the word comes forth moving
[1:57:45] in our hearts in our life it stirs that
[1:57:48] reality up and it's God working through
[1:57:50] a mini membered body that ought to be
[1:57:53] the request when God moves on our heart
[1:57:55] like Paul when he met him face to face
[1:57:58] he said Lord what would you have me do
[1:58:03] what do you want me to do Lord what's my
[1:58:08] part Lord I'm coming down
[1:58:19] you okay
[1:58:23] all right brother Joey
[1:58:28] let's come down here
[1:58:33] how many times really Bramblett tell us
[1:58:35] we make the statement I can't take your
[1:58:38] place and you can't take mine but you'll
[1:58:43] be your best you do your best with what
[1:58:46] God has called you to do brother Brown
[1:58:51] would tell us and this in the message
[1:58:53] greatest battle ever fought because you
[1:58:55] know maintaining our position is making
[1:58:58] sure we fully follow the Lord with what
[1:59:02] God has called us to do you see but the
[1:59:07] random makes a statement when you think
[1:59:08] of it the Stars the planets all of this
[1:59:13] working in a harmony it works in a
[1:59:18] harmony it works together brother brems
[1:59:23] says in greatest our fall he said of
[1:59:25] that great heavenly host like that has
[1:59:27] to keep its place to make everything in
[1:59:30] order
[1:59:30] what about the disorder of the earthly
[1:59:33] hosts how when one gets out of order how
[1:59:37] it throws the whole thing out of cater
[1:59:41] the whole program of God is upset when
[1:59:44] one member gets out of order we should
[1:59:47] continually to strive to keep the order
[1:59:51] of the Spirit amen
[1:59:55] help me Jesus
[1:59:59] when you strive for anything it isn't
[2:00:02] because it's just coming you've got to
[2:00:06] give yourself to that
[2:00:08] give yourself to that that right there
[2:00:11] to maintain the order of the spirit see
[2:00:14] maintaining the order of the Spirit is
[2:00:16] that we maintain our position
[2:00:20] our position if Jupiter tries to fix
[2:00:24] Saturn's position Jupiter is out of
[2:00:26] position trying to fix Center so you're
[2:00:30] trying to bring Saturn in position and
[2:00:31] Jupiter's out if one star gets out of
[2:00:35] the constellation trying to help another
[2:00:37] one out it fails to give the right sign
[2:00:40] it's got to maintain its position it
[2:00:44] can't look and say well I'm just a star
[2:00:46] in the Little Dipper I want to be in the
[2:00:48] Big Dipper it has to stay in its
[2:00:50] position and if it stays in its position
[2:00:54] it stands there is a light there's a
[2:00:57] sign that's about its life there's a
[2:01:01] harmony that's there and it blends
[2:01:03] together so there is a picture there in
[2:01:06] the sky and a matter of fact remember
[2:01:08] brother Ram sells us
[2:01:09] he wrote the first Bible in the heavens
[2:01:14] by stars beings being in position so we
[2:01:20] should continually strive to keep the
[2:01:23] order of the Spirit no time said I would
[2:01:26] to God this morning that we could bring
[2:01:29] this to a real healing service you catch
[2:01:32] this I would to God we could bring this
[2:01:37] to a real healing service oh no you mean
[2:01:42] brother Branham didn't pack the healing
[2:01:44] service in his briefcase no you mean
[2:01:48] that day real healing service depended
[2:01:51] on the entire body that was gathered
[2:01:54] there yep yep I would hope we would
[2:02:00] bring this to a real healing service
[2:02:04] that we could keep this group that we
[2:02:08] have gathered under the roof this
[2:02:10] morning in such a harmony that the Holy
[2:02:14] Spirit would place every member of the
[2:02:17] body that's here this morning in such
[2:02:19] harmony
[2:02:21] till there would be such a spontaneous
[2:02:24] healing of soul and body if we'll just
[2:02:29] hold our positions who's the one that
[2:02:35] does the positioning the Holy Ghost but
[2:02:39] it will be focused on him if we'll be
[2:02:42] focused on him he's the one that
[2:02:45] positions he's the one that places he's
[2:02:48] the one that delivers he's the one that
[2:02:50] fills what the Holy Ghost he's the one
[2:02:52] that heals the sick it has to be him if
[2:02:59] we want to see that done then let us do
[2:03:01] what others have done and pray and fast
[2:03:04] and just make ourself available
[2:03:08] what I do clean the snuffer dishes make
[2:03:12] sure the fine flowers ready to go make
[2:03:16] sure that utensils are clean and ready
[2:03:18] to be used
[2:03:20] make sure that your life is a conduit
[2:03:23] that when the Holy Ghost begins to flow
[2:03:25] through the service make sure that
[2:03:27] you're tapped in to the source that he
[2:03:29] can just flow right through there's not
[2:03:33] a hang-up there's not a short there's
[2:03:35] not a grounded wire but you are part of
[2:03:37] the circuitry of Almighty God you have
[2:03:41] laid yourself aside during the week and
[2:03:44] during the day and here you are as wires
[2:03:47] you are submitted to God that the
[2:03:50] current of the Holy Ghost could flow in
[2:03:54] a service and I say this to you this
[2:03:59] morning I know that we come here many
[2:04:02] times and there's times that you come
[2:04:05] that you are coming and you are pressing
[2:04:08] beyond your feelings
[2:04:12] let me say this to you just to make sure
[2:04:15] let's say Lord you stand upon that word
[2:04:19] you've been feeding on as you've been
[2:04:22] praying you've been giving yourself to
[2:04:25] God sometimes the presence that maybe
[2:04:28] you haven't felt all week it was to test
[2:04:30] your faith do you still believe he is
[2:04:34] the ever-present
[2:04:35] I am with you always and here you've
[2:04:38] been standing on that word and it's like
[2:04:40] you come into Mount Moriah you come here
[2:04:42] and you presented yourself and now here
[2:04:45] comes the surge of the Holy Ghost
[2:04:52] sometimes it's the behind-the-scenes
[2:04:54] things you see it's not what what gets
[2:04:57] done here what happens here is a result
[2:05:00] of behind-the-scenes that's where
[2:05:05] Pentecost failed I know I'm going a
[2:05:07] little bit but I do see the runway in
[2:05:10] sight Pentecost they this is where
[2:05:15] listen to me now this is where the
[2:05:18] Spirit of God would direct the Prophet
[2:05:22] and bring the balance where he talked
[2:05:24] about working the music up y'all gonna
[2:05:29] preach with me now right if you're not
[2:05:32] I'm going to anyhow
[2:05:33] this is where he would bring that and
[2:05:36] work in the music up
[2:05:39] what were they doing they were doing it
[2:05:41] without a consecrated life they were
[2:05:45] trying to simulate another or we've got
[2:05:48] to have this it's got to happen like
[2:05:49] this it's got to do this it's got to do
[2:05:51] that let me tell you something being
[2:05:53] happening in the Lord and worshipping
[2:05:55] and clapping your hands and the music
[2:05:58] itself moving and people getting excited
[2:06:00] is not working up in emotion
[2:06:12] that's of God
[2:06:16] there might be people who get under
[2:06:18] their emotion and that's all they get it
[2:06:20] under the motion but I believe with all
[2:06:21] my heart I've come here and I believe
[2:06:24] there's others and you come here this
[2:06:25] morning as well too we come to enter in
[2:06:28] we come to worship the Lord we come to
[2:06:32] give ourselves and they enter in in

[2:06:40] the as the song has been sung these
[2:06:42] ain't just salt these are words that
[2:06:45] speak to our life I tell you right now
[2:06:50] we can shout just as much on it is well
[2:06:52] with my soul as can't nobody do me like
[2:06:55] Jesus we know in whom we have believed
[2:07:07] we are persuaded that he is able
[2:07:11] hallelujah we praise him with
[2:07:13] understanding when we watch them we wash
[2:07:16] up with understanding we know in whom we
[2:07:19] have believed
[2:07:21] he's the joy of our life whether this
[2:07:25] message this revelation it brings joy in
[2:07:28] our lives
[2:07:29] he don't bring sourness and this
[2:07:32] contentment if it's self you got a hold
[2:07:35] of the wrong grapes the grapes I got a
[2:07:37] hold of us fully right
[2:07:39] these grapes packed within them real
[2:07:42] wide real stimulation hey man it's real
[2:07:48] joy hello load times it's the behind the
[2:07:57] scenes you know when you go to see a
[2:07:59] performance some of you been to see a
[2:08:04] performance and you go to see it now my
[2:08:09] that was that was wonderful times you go
[2:08:13] to see people sing and it's wonderful
[2:08:16] leaders bring it down to little
[2:08:18] Fontaine's you think they just get up on
[2:08:20] the stage and wing it
[2:08:23] no they practice but they do use
[2:08:29] themselves to the Lord they take it
[2:08:33] serious but you see you don't see all
[2:08:36] the behind the scenes you don't see all
[2:08:39] the times where they start on the verse
[2:08:40] say not nothing to stop Ike you're off
[2:08:46] Paul you're off Sharon you're off Sherri
[2:08:49] you and Luna you don't see all of that
[2:08:52] but all that has to be worked out and
[2:08:55] you and I sit there for the two hours
[2:08:58] say glory to God getting this wonderful
[2:09:00] hitting this tremendous woo I tell you
[2:09:06] it's like a dinner you enjoy that dinner
[2:09:10] don't happen on its own sometimes the
[2:09:14] wife is cooking that dinner first as she
[2:09:15] first has to get over herself of even
[2:09:17] lacking the confidence and the ability
[2:09:18] to cook it
[2:09:24] I know this is simple but you can put
[2:09:28] this in your dinner bucket need it it
[2:09:33] help you
[2:09:33] listen Francis is about the word working
[2:09:35] out in our life Amen that the word be
[2:09:41] unhindered this is where the Bible goes
[2:09:46] on let me just read these scriptures and
[2:09:47] I see the runway it's coming
[2:09:51] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[2:09:53] husband's as is fitting the Lord
[2:09:57] husbands love your wives and be not
[2:10:00] bitter against them children obey your
[2:10:04] parents in all things for this is well
[2:10:07] pleasing unto the Lord father's provoke
[2:10:11] not your children to anger lest they be
[2:10:13] discouraged I don't have there's not
[2:10:18] sufficient time to dwell on those
[2:10:19] scriptures here this morning but these
[2:10:23] things here when you look at how that
[2:10:25] God
[2:10:28] would speak through Paul in regards to
[2:10:31] these things it's important but the
[2:10:36] baton tells us I believe it's
[2:10:37] Christianity verse idolatry he said
[2:10:40] people seen the miracles in Martin's
[2:10:42] ministry he said but the one thing that
[2:10:45] the people did not see is all the time
[2:10:48] that Martin spent in prayer
[2:10:56] sometimes we're looking at things even
[2:10:59] in the service listen as you stand even
[2:11:02] within this has a father and a mother
[2:11:05] let me bring this down there's a father
[2:11:06] and a mother as a husband and wife as a
[2:11:10] child young person however you want to
[2:11:15] you stand within your position and you
[2:11:21] maintain that sometimes many times it's
[2:11:26] not easy because of things that we want
[2:11:29] to try to make happen
[2:11:35] but it's not up to us to try to make it
[2:11:38] happen but if these things I just read
[2:11:41] right here this is one of many places in
[2:11:43] the scripture these are things behind
[2:11:46] the scenes that nobody else sees in your
[2:11:50] house you know with me now I know you're
[2:11:55] hoping but I wish you'd seen that runway
[2:11:57] sooner now I see it I see it
[2:12:02] these are things that we see behind
[2:12:04] closed doors and let me tell you
[2:12:07] something when you give yourself to it
[2:12:09] God honors that you remember what Peter
[2:12:13] said when the Lord Jesus asked him he
[2:12:16] said you love me Lord you know I love
[2:12:17] you you love me yeah Lauren you know
[2:12:22] what I already said that I love you you
[2:12:25] love me yeah Lord you know I love you he
[2:12:29] said then feed my sheep and my lands see
[2:12:36] it was something he was calling for love
[2:12:39] that real love to him it bring would
[2:12:43] bring Peter beyond self when you're
[2:12:47] converted then you strengthen your
[2:12:49] brother he would bring him beyond self
[2:12:51] not just a sheep but the Lambs also so
[2:12:57] sometimes as a father sometimes as a
[2:13:02] husband sometimes there's a mom as a
[2:13:05] wife there's things that you do and you
[2:13:09] don't feel very spiritual doing
[2:13:16] that yet it's the Word of God
[2:13:19] sometimes it's it's it's difficult
[2:13:24] and you you stand there upon God's Word
[2:13:28] but look look as you stand on that word
[2:13:32] that invites God to come on the same I
[2:13:38] know how it is
[2:13:39] child the teenager and the my I remember
[2:13:43] how it was you know when my parents
[2:13:45] didn't know anything and I knew
[2:13:46] everything
[2:13:47] I remember that somehow I lost
[2:13:51] everything I thought I knew I've been
[2:13:52] there but then within that it brings you
[2:13:58] into those places where fathers be not
[2:14:03] angry lest they be discouraged sure
[2:14:07] there's some wrong being done but let's
[2:14:08] also prop up the right
[2:14:12] it's with a husband that that treatment
[2:14:17] the Bible says be not bitter against the
[2:14:18] what it shows there could be things
[2:14:20] which you could be bitter
[2:14:22] oh my mind lord help me and wives could
[2:14:30] be bitter against the husband but
[2:14:34] there's only one thing that'll calm
[2:14:36] bitter waters
[2:14:40] recognize the tree that's in your midst
[2:14:44] [Applause]
[2:14:48] cut down that tree what is the cutting
[2:14:51] down the tree laying down of self that's
[2:14:57] what Calvary was he sweetened the waters
[2:15:01] of Marah for us
[2:15:07] you have the power the authority for
[2:15:11] your life to be a conduit that can take
[2:15:14] an atmosphere in the home and change
[2:15:17] that but don't try to force yourself I'm
[2:15:22] trying to do this and I don't see this
[2:15:23] changing and I don't see this just let
[2:15:25] your heart be there God is faithful to
[2:15:28] his word he will meet you there
[2:15:42] the wheels are out
[2:15:45] I see the stripes on the pavement
[2:15:54] can I read you these two little places
[2:15:56] some be afraid if I read why a little
[2:16:03] bit we don't have church on Thursday I'm
[2:16:05] we're trying to get
[2:16:14] that's what they'll be doing to you on
[2:16:15] Friday because you've been working on
[2:16:17] Monday I believe that brother Williams
[2:16:22] served God's purpose in life
[2:16:24] a real father and I see his darling
[2:16:28] companion mrs. Williams sitting here a
[2:16:30] real husband that's one of God's
[2:16:33] purposes a father one of God's purposes
[2:16:37] and he was German ties to God by the
[2:16:41] Holy Spirit God's main purpose
[2:16:47] what's important you got the main
[2:16:50] purpose and if you've got the main
[2:16:52] purpose then he'll help you fulfill all
[2:16:55] the other purposes Lord I never walked
[2:17:00] this way before just follow him
[2:17:05] hmm
[2:17:09] sometimes sisters what God has even
[2:17:14] called you to do
[2:17:17] brothers the care one another I want you
[2:17:21] to look at this and the unfailing
[2:17:26] realities of God the emember one's
[2:17:28] sister methi when brother Branham came
[2:17:31] in that time and little Joseph was
[2:17:33] having his little situation and remember
[2:17:37] the BAM said oh no don't don't don't
[2:17:39] don't don't do that and sister media
[2:17:42] said easy for you to say you're not here
[2:17:46] all the time
[2:17:50] brothers kind of like you coming out of
[2:17:52] the office are you coming home from work
[2:17:57] she's been there all day long juggling
[2:18:00] things
[2:18:07] when brother branham entered in for
[2:18:09] prayer for sister methi in this quote he
[2:18:14] said father she didn't mean that
[2:18:19] he said she's iron my clothes she's
[2:18:24] fixed my dinners she sent me out to the
[2:18:28] rest of the public Lord she didn't mean
[2:18:31] it see what he was doing he was bringing
[2:18:33] before the Lord she's kept her command
[2:18:36] the commandments
[2:18:37] she stood upon this right here and look
[2:18:40] what happened that didn't go unnoticed
[2:18:42] the Prophet that was called out of his
[2:18:46] heart it brought it back he's not quick
[2:18:50] to forget your work in labor of love I
[2:18:53] wonder how many times sister methi she
[2:18:55] didn't feel spiritual ironing those
[2:18:57] shirts ironing those trousers cooking
[2:19:02] them meals but you know what she was
[2:19:04] doing it as unto the Lord
[2:19:11] and even though sister meaty
[2:19:18] was not on the platform was not standing
[2:19:22] right there by his side on the platform
[2:19:24] many times was back home in another
[2:19:26] place and while he was overseas or in
[2:19:27] another she was a part of that ministry
[2:19:37] she did her little part I wonder how
[2:19:41] many said in the audience in five
[2:19:43] my brother brems shirt sure it looks
[2:19:46] nice and pressed my that sister mean he
[2:19:48] did it's not the focus and if it was
[2:19:51] somebody's focus they're wrong
[2:19:53] but I can tell you that wasn't even the
[2:19:55] focus you see sometimes the snuffer
[2:19:58] dishes and everything else is not the
[2:20:00] focus but all of that was put in place
[2:20:06] so the brother brand could give himself
[2:20:08] more to the Lord and be used of God and
[2:20:13] I'm telling you even though there's
[2:20:15] sometimes there's things that you can do
[2:20:17] and I can do where you don't feel
[2:20:19] spiritual we don't feel the presence of
[2:20:22] God within it but if it's God's Word and
[2:20:26] God's called you to it you maintain your
[2:20:29] position and you watch God he comes on
[2:20:34] the scene to fulfill his word you love
[2:20:40] him
[2:20:41] that's the main purpose be Germa ties
[2:20:44] with the holy ghost and in him maintain
[2:20:47] your position we'll just stop here let's
[2:20:53] just pray
[2:20:58] they would like to be remembered in
[2:21:00] prayer this morning god bless you would
[2:21:03] you remember me let's pray
