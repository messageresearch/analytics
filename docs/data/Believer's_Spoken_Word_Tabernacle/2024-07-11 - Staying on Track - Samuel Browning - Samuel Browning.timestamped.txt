[39:53] precious
[39:54] name amen and amen
[39:57] amen amen thank you musicians let's look
[40:01] here in the scriptures of Matthew uh
[40:03] chapter 14 I'm going to skip right there
[40:06] and and not read from job we've as a
[40:10] congregation we've been uh pulling from
[40:13] there and I think perhaps tonight I may
[40:15] be turning a corner on this with fear so
[40:18] you uh that are what I think but you
[40:21] know there's a lot of this here I didn't
[40:23] even anticipate months ago so it's just
[40:26] wonderful to be led by the Lord because
[40:29] it's all about God coming and
[40:31] ministering to our needs and God it just
[40:34] shows that here God can take right from
[40:36] his word the word is just as inspired
[40:38] tonight as what it was when the
[40:41] inspiration fell upon the writers and if
[40:43] that same inspiration can strike our
[40:45] heart tonight and we can move into that
[40:48] why we every everything that we have
[40:50] need of it's in him and it's already
[40:52] finished and we just desire one thing
[40:55] God let our faith rise to be able to to
[40:57] see him and claim what belongs to us and
[41:00] receive it in our lives Amen in Matthew
[41:05] 14:22 and the scripture said and
[41:07] straightway Jesus constrained his
[41:09] disciples to get into a ship and to go
[41:12] before him unto the other side while he
[41:14] sent the multitudes away and when he had
[41:17] sent the multitudes away he went up into
[41:20] a mountain apart to pray and when the
[41:22] evening was come he was there alone but
[41:25] the ship was now in the midst of the sea
[41:28] tossed with waves for the wind was
[41:31] contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the
[41:33] night Jesus went unto them walking on
[41:36] the sea and when the disciples saw him
[41:39] walking on the sea they were troubled
[41:42] saying it is a spirit and they cried out
[41:45] for fear but straightway Jesus spake
[41:49] unto them saying be of good cheer it is
[41:52] I Be not Afraid and Peter answered him
[41:56] and said Lord if it be thou bid me come
[42:00] unto thee on the water now I want you to
[42:03] notice this here is the word coming in
[42:07] their midst and now they've recognized
[42:10] the word who he is it is I Be not Afraid
[42:13] now Peter in the presence of the word of
[42:17] God the word made flesh the Lord Jesus
[42:20] bid me to come to
[42:22] thee and he says come and when Peter was
[42:27] come down out of the ship he walked on
[42:29] the water to go to Jesus but verse 30
[42:34] when he saw the wind boisterous he was
[42:39] afraid and begin beginning to sink he
[42:42] cried saying Lord save me incredible the
[42:46] first part of the verse he he he he did
[42:49] he did the worst thing he could do get
[42:51] his eyes off Jesus but the last part of
[42:53] that verse he did the greatest thing
[42:56] that any person could say say Lord save
[42:59] me that's right yes
[43:03] sir uh we could say amen glory be to God
[43:06] and and close it tonight immediately Dre
[43:10] Jesus stretched forth his hand and
[43:12] caught him and said unto him oh thou of
[43:15] little faith wherefore didst thou doubt
[43:18] and when they were coming into the ship
[43:19] the wind seized and then they were in
[43:22] the in the ship came and worshiped him
[43:24] saying of a truth Thou Art the son of
[43:26] God
[43:27] amen may God bless you and bless the
[43:29] reading of the word as you're being
[43:31] seated I just uh in looking at this
[43:35] thought
[43:36] and uh in overcoming fear and its
[43:38] effects and we've looked at a lot of
[43:40] these points within here I remember it
[43:43] was job who said the things which I
[43:45] feared had greatly come upon me things I
[43:48] feared greatly had come upon me and this
[43:51] is what really was just pulsating
[43:53] through my heart as I've looked at this
[43:56] and had this before me now for for
[43:58] months and just kind of looking over
[44:00] these things and just waiting you know
[44:02] within the thoughts and as God continues
[44:04] to build things and this is really a
[44:06] thought that's just so pulsating here
[44:08] upon my heart in this moment and that is
[44:10] just really staying on track staying on
[44:14] track and I how many enjoyed the service
[44:16] on Sunday amen with brother rap and I
[44:19] tell you we certainly were blessed and
[44:22] uh I think for sure if you've never seen
[44:25] or uh beheld a teacher Ministry you saw
[44:28] a real teacher there on Sunday that's a
[44:30] real teacher and so we so appreciate
[44:33] that and I really appreciate brother rap
[44:35] and uh my I I enjoyed that um uh that
[44:39] service I enjoyed what the Lord had to
[44:40] say to us and you know uh there's
[44:43] nothing new that God is going to say to
[44:46] us but I'm so glad for all the
[44:48] perspectives that God brings because
[44:51] when any perspective that's of God we're
[44:53] going to see Jesus Christ to be the same
[44:56] but there's things the way God will take
[44:58] things and just you know like brother B
[44:59] says a teacher will take it and just
[45:01] take nuggets polish them don't really
[45:03] explain them so much just polish and go
[45:04] on and go on and just kind of moves
[45:06] through so quickly and and that how God
[45:10] just so took the gift and I appreciate
[45:12] it because I know uh we were certainly
[45:14] blessed in our hearts amen you know
[45:17] every little every little thing that
[45:19] takes place in our life along the way
[45:21] it's it's to increase our walk with God
[45:24] that we would go forward and so when we
[45:26] look here in the scripture and and
[45:28] thinking of this thought I want to just
[45:30] say it in this way that when we think of
[45:33] a vision and you know uh a man one of
[45:36] the brothers that asked brother Branham
[45:38] said brother brandham I would just ask
[45:40] that you would pray that God would let
[45:42] me see a vision and brother Bram put his
[45:44] arm around the brother and he said
[45:45] brother he said every time that you open
[45:48] the Bible you see a vision he said when
[45:52] when you open the Bible he said just ask
[45:54] God to speak to you and say Lord speak
[45:57] to my heart because he said every time
[45:59] we open the Bible we see a vision and
[46:03] that's a thing that we want our eyes to
[46:05] be I want my eyes to be so Anointed with
[46:09] the holy spirit it's things that I'm not
[46:12] trying to see or you're not trying to
[46:14] see but just to be in tune with God that
[46:17] we can see and as God would Inspire his
[46:20] word and and we can see him and as he
[46:23] ministers to our life and you know
[46:25] brother Bram he he takes it in this way
[46:27] when we're looking at Faith and he'll
[46:30] take of this this portion all throughout
[46:32] the message and in the message perfect
[46:34] faith and he'll he'll deal with this but
[46:37] I'll say this with any Vision we always
[46:40] are are know that for sure that every
[46:42] vision and every Spirit every gift must
[46:45] always speak according to the word if it
[46:48] doesn't speak according to the word and
[46:50] you know it isn't about that you or I
[46:52] have to be I believe the Bible says
[46:54] study to show ourselves approved but you
[46:57] know it might be something that you
[46:59] might not be able to put your finger on
[47:00] but the prophet said in the message
[47:02] thirst
[47:03] 1965 he said if there's something a
[47:05] little off he said there's that that on
[47:06] the inside he said it will say something
[47:09] is just not right about this and so this
[47:13] is where we're relying upon the holy
[47:16] spirit we're not relying Upon Our Own
[47:18] reasonings not re relying upon flesh but
[47:21] we're relying upon Christ who is the
[47:24] word because the holy spirit is not not
[47:27] different person it's the word himself
[47:29] inside of you and so when we think of
[47:32] this and you know so every time when
[47:35] something comes from God and when when
[47:37] the word of God speaks to you and it's
[47:39] received faith is activated in the word
[47:42] of God not a feeling not an emotion or
[47:46] anything outside of the word of God
[47:49] because faith can only find its resting
[47:51] place in the word of God you say why do
[47:54] you say that because your feeling and
[47:56] your emotion can leave you after the
[47:58] service is over but where what has to be
[48:01] is that there is a faith that'll stand
[48:04] in the word of God that no matter when
[48:06] the enemy comes and would like to try to
[48:09] knock the confidence out of you that God
[48:13] has instilled In You by his word you
[48:16] have to stand on the word and not your
[48:18] feelings not your emotions Hey listen
[48:21] it's a wonderful thing when God speaks
[48:23] to us it's a wonderful thing as his
[48:25] presence moves over us but the whole
[48:27] reality is that our faith would be
[48:30] positioned in the word of God so much so
[48:34] to where us and the word are not
[48:36] separate but the promise that we have
[48:38] need of and what God sees we have need
[48:40] in our life we now become veiled in that
[48:43] word and as the prophet said we're in
[48:46] the word looking out by eyes of faith
[48:49] and see it already as a finished work
[48:51] because faith has only one resting place
[48:54] faith has only one place that it can
[48:56] work worship and that's in the word of
[48:58] God so within this of Faith you know we
[49:02] might have certain feelings but they're
[49:04] all secondarily to the word of God and
[49:07] so it's the word of God that's lasting
[49:09] it holds within it transforming power
[49:12] it's the word of God that comes to
[49:14] loosen us from Fear because fear is a
[49:17] lack of
[49:20] confidence it's a lack of confidence and
[49:22] this is what the word of God comes to do
[49:25] is cast out fear is to Deliver Us From
[49:29] Fear God does not want any one of his
[49:32] children to live below their Privileges
[49:35] and that would be to walk in fear you
[49:37] might say well I have this in my family
[49:39] or I have this but if you look to the
[49:42] word of God you cannot find one place in
[49:45] the word of God where there is a such a
[49:48] thing as this promise but for you it's
[49:51] this way you find everything in the word
[49:53] of God that's yay and amen
[49:56] amen and this is where we rest is within
[49:59] the word of God not our feelings so it
[50:03] leads us to a place of supreme
[50:05] confidence in the word of God where the
[50:07] finished were in that finished work of
[50:10] Calvary and I want you to think of how
[50:12] the prophet he would say it like this
[50:14] how that remember the little boy that
[50:16] was in Finland that was raised up
[50:18] remember that and remember a brother
[50:20] Bram I always like how this is I just
[50:23] just really pondering on this remember
[50:25] brother Bram told him he said to write
[50:26] it down and he said write it in the fly
[50:29] Lea of your Bible and so you remember
[50:32] even the prophet himself you know
[50:33] looking and beholding uh when they were
[50:36] in Finland and I I don't really want to
[50:38] get caught up in the story but I want to
[50:40] just say it in this way God had given a
[50:42] vision years before that there was a
[50:45] little boy in somewhere that was going
[50:47] to be raised up you know when the
[50:49] prophet saw that event he didn't even
[50:52] realize what was happening they stopped
[50:54] and all of a sudden when he got into to
[50:57] a place and a position he begin to
[50:59] notice the pine trees and and begin to
[51:02] notice the trees and he's the one who
[51:04] sent Jack Moore and he said go get your
[51:06] Bible go get your Bible see what's
[51:08] written in there because he begin to
[51:10] recognize I I've seen this somewhere I
[51:12] I've seen this surrounding somewhere and
[51:14] the prophet said when that begin to line
[51:17] up this is what he said he said you can
[51:19] line up every demon out of hell and it
[51:23] could not stop that word from coming to
[51:25] pass
[51:29] now think of that that's a vision the
[51:31] prophet would say like this in perfect
[51:33] Faith he said that's God speaking in
[51:36] this day by a vision but he says if that
[51:39] Vision was contrary to this he says then
[51:43] that would be wrong this is more this is
[51:46] more than the vision if any Visions
[51:49] contrary to the word leave it alone it
[51:51] ain't of God God don't contradict his
[51:54] one word amen so what was the purpose
[51:57] here of the message coming to you and I
[52:00] was not to wear that even around brother
[52:03] brandham and brother brandham himself
[52:05] you you hear it through the message
[52:06] through 1950s and on through even
[52:09] through 1963 he says the whole purpose
[52:12] of the message I I tried to get the
[52:14] people to recognize they don't need a
[52:16] certain person to lay hands on them and
[52:19] and they he said but I failed within
[52:21] that he said if you can just recognize
[52:24] it's Jesus Christ in our midst the the
[52:26] holy spirit is anointing the word he
[52:29] said let him lay his hands on you and
[52:32] the work is finished now he wasn't doing
[52:35] away with altar calls he wasn't doing
[52:38] away with laying hands on the sick
[52:40] because that's part of the
[52:42] Bible is that right there's times where
[52:44] we need our faith inspired there's times
[52:47] where we need and we join our faith
[52:49] together so I just say it like this if
[52:51] I've got a need in my life I'm not going
[52:53] to ask God to come on a certain way I
[52:56] want to come on his plane and if God
[52:58] calls and says listen I I want you to go
[53:01] forward I want there's going to be hands
[53:03] laid upon you that's steal the word of
[53:05] God it takes faith in God's word for it
[53:07] said if there be any sick among you let
[53:10] them call for the Elders of the church
[53:12] if there be any sin it shall be forgiven
[53:14] them let them anoint them with oil and
[53:16] the prayer of faith shall save the sick
[53:18] and God shall raise them up the Bible
[53:21] said in Mark 16 they shall lay hands on
[53:23] the sick and they shall recover
[53:27] yes but this is where we're this is
[53:29] where we're at that even with the word
[53:32] itself now I want you to notice how the
[53:34] prophet takes this there's just this
[53:36] these words as he says this here in
[53:38] perfect Faith the very next statement I
[53:40] didn't put this one up there but he says
[53:43] if this word or maybe I did if this word
[53:46] told you something catch that if this
[53:49] word told you something then you can
[53:51] have the same confidence that that's
[53:54] what's going to happen if it if it says
[53:58] they shall lay hands upon the sick and
[54:00] they shall recover if faith that perfect
[54:03] Faith got a hold of that you'd pass by
[54:06] this prayer line jumping and shouting
[54:09] when you left here it's over it's over
[54:12] it's all finished so what if somebody
[54:15] doesn't jump and shout it doesn't mean
[54:17] that they didn't have perfect Faith
[54:19] perfect faith is a saddness if there's
[54:21] an emotion based on anything else it's
[54:24] wrong it should be on the joy of the
[54:27] Lord there might be somebody walk
[54:28] through and they're just crying and just
[54:30] say thank you Lord because of how
[54:32] they're made up but they have a settl
[54:34] it's over it's finished I heard God I
[54:37] heard the word say to
[54:40] me and here you you quote the scripture
[54:43] well you're just quoting a scripture No
[54:45] but this is the word and the word said
[54:47] to
[54:48] me that's why you're setting in a
[54:50] service or maybe here you are in
[54:52] devotion or here you are walking through
[54:54] the week and here the holy Spirit the
[54:56] word of God will speak to your heart you
[54:59] have a need in your life and it'll speak
[55:01] to your life that this promise is for
[55:03] you that that healing is for you and the
[55:06] Lord that Health all thy diseases you
[55:08] might have memorized that verse but when
[55:10] the Lord speaks that to you that's a
[55:13] direct word from from almighty God when
[55:16] he says the Holy Ghost is for you that's
[55:18] a direct word from God it's a promise
[55:21] but now the word has spoke to you
[55:24] personally hallelujah hallelujah that's
[55:26] how we walk by faith is the word taking
[55:29] the word I say tonight it ought to be
[55:31] When We Gather here Lord I want the word
[55:34] to speak to me Lord I want the word to
[55:37] speak to my life amen I want to be moved
[55:40] and inspired and and walking on with
[55:43] that word so notice when they they cried
[55:46] out when they saw that what they thought
[55:49] was a spirit but here the word settles
[55:53] them and the word has that effect to
[55:55] settle us that's good we can have a lot
[55:57] of wonderings of what's this or what's
[56:00] that but listen the word will always
[56:02] correct the air the word will always
[56:05] settle listen that's why the that's what
[56:08] the gospel came to do the gospel has
[56:10] never and never does produce
[56:14] anxiousness the gospel doesn't produce
[56:17] depression that's right you see this is
[56:19] where this is where when the enemy can
[56:22] take a hold of things and and want to
[56:23] try to and and getting our eyes over
[56:25] here and maybe I'm missing over here and
[56:27] I I'm missing out on something or I'm
[56:29] this and it just it gets us in such a
[56:31] place but the word never ever comes to
[56:35] trouble Our
[56:37] Lives the word comes to settle
[56:40] us hallelujah now notice the Bible says
[56:46] that in Hebrews 11:1 faith is the
[56:50] substance anything we do we must do it
[56:53] in faith if we don't do it in faith it's
[56:56] un un belief right so it all is by faith
[56:59] and the Bible tells us that the
[57:00] righteousness of God is revealed from
[57:03] Faith unto Faith so and and it's un it's
[57:08] impossible to please God without faith
[57:10] now Faith is the substance of things
[57:13] hoped for and the evidence of Things Not
[57:17] Seen now I want you to notice when Peter
[57:19] here he he sees the Lord and he ask him
[57:23] bid me to come unto thee unto the water
[57:26] you know that's that's like when you
[57:28] could be sitting right in a service and
[57:31] here the word is beginning to speak and
[57:33] you say Lord speak to me Lord speak to
[57:37] my need Lord speak to my situation now
[57:40] he's already calmed one fear where they
[57:43] were afraid now here Peter after that
[57:46] fear has been dismissed now he says bid
[57:50] me to come unto you why the word has got
[57:53] to speak unto me I don't want to just
[57:56] resume I don't want to venture without
[57:58] Authority I don't want to imagine it I
[58:01] want the word to speak to my heart the
[58:03] word that comes and speaks to My Life
[58:06] deals with my heart and draws upon my
[58:08] life and the word said come is that
[58:12] right and he be to walk on the water
[58:15] going to Jesus now then the Bible tells
[58:18] us that in verse 30 when he saw the wind
[58:22] boisterous he was afraid now fear had
[58:26] begin to set in now I want you to notice
[58:29] this how that the prophet places it in
[58:31] perfect Faith Peter was doing all right
[58:35] until he got scared this same word come
[58:39] is just like Mark 16 which I quoted
[58:42] James 5 which we quoted on laying hands
[58:45] on the sick it's the same Word of
[58:48] Promise that God you know God is able to
[58:51] inspire that word to our heart listen
[58:52] friends let me just let me just say it
[58:54] in this way the things that I'm speaking
[58:56] on here tonight on overcoming fear and
[58:58] its effects and staying on track it's
[59:01] about staying in a place where God is
[59:03] able to come and to inspire you by his
[59:06] word Satan's objective is to move you
[59:11] out of the channel of inspiration he
[59:14] don't care how much you you could you
[59:16] could you could come to church you could
[59:17] s around he doesn't care how much as
[59:20] long as he can stop up that channel but
[59:23] when the channel is open and and it's
[59:26] available for inspiration how many knows
[59:29] that job he was a prophet God spoke to
[59:31] him by inspiration but yet God did not
[59:35] let job know what was going on and that
[59:37] inspiration he wasn't receiving was
[59:40] worrying him now you and I have the
[59:42] benefit to know that what God even in
[59:45] this hour our flesh can get troubled
[59:47] when we don't have answers for certain
[59:49] things but we know him who is the answer
[59:52] this is why as a father as a husband on
[59:55] and on you don't have to have all the
[59:57] answers you have to be in contact with
[1:00:00] him and know him who is the
[1:00:04] answer he has he is the answer for every
[1:00:07] situation in our life the word is
[1:00:10] applicable we may not see it we may not
[1:00:13] know it we may not understand it but we
[1:00:15] want the grace of God to stay stable and
[1:00:18] steadfast and holding to the word even
[1:00:21] when we don't understand and being a
[1:00:24] channel that inspir ation can drop at
[1:00:27] any
[1:00:28] time now I want you to look at this with
[1:00:31] Peter here I think it's paragraph 107
[1:00:34] here where the Prophet says there was
[1:00:37] that storm that was up upon the sea and
[1:00:39] it was a terrific thing here he is Peter
[1:00:42] maybe it was in paragraph 109 that
[1:00:45] that's where it's at and the B brother
[1:00:47] BR says this he said Peter he stepped
[1:00:49] down and he said it's the Lord I'll just
[1:00:51] walk but when he got his eyes on the way
[1:00:56] he got scared what come into his mind
[1:01:00] the first thing this is what the first
[1:01:02] thing was I'm going to walk because the
[1:01:05] word said for me to walk see the word
[1:01:09] does not bypass our mind the word comes
[1:01:13] through our mind this is even where
[1:01:16] Satan came to Eve to lead her astray he
[1:01:19] first began to move upon her mind and
[1:01:22] she received it in her mind this is why
[1:01:24] when even the new birth and here coming
[1:01:27] to Mary she was troubled in her mind but
[1:01:29] the word came to settle her to bring her
[1:01:32] to a place of yielding Us in the word
[1:01:35] that when as she could receive the word
[1:01:37] then the holy spirit will finish the
[1:01:40] work that he has started in your life
[1:01:42] this is why the word it can't just be
[1:01:45] something in our mind but yet it starts
[1:01:47] with receiving the word in our mind but
[1:01:50] as we will water that word as we will
[1:01:52] water and receive that word that word
[1:01:55] will drop from here to there that's not
[1:01:57] your job to do that that's his job
[1:02:01] that's what he promised that he would
[1:02:03] do is that all right first thing this is
[1:02:06] what Peter said I'm going to walk on the
[1:02:08] water because the word
[1:02:10] said not because it makes
[1:02:13] sense but the word has said that I'm to
[1:02:16] walk on the water and this is what I'm
[1:02:18] going to do but then the next thing the
[1:02:22] prophet said he looked at his symptoms
[1:02:26] right yeah he looked out there and seen
[1:02:28] how big them waves was and he got scared
[1:02:32] and when he did he went down what was
[1:02:35] the fault where was the failure when he
[1:02:37] got his eyes off the
[1:02:40] word let me tell you every one of us
[1:02:42] sitting in here tonight no matter where
[1:02:44] you're at in your Christian walk with
[1:02:46] God your strength your success and and
[1:02:49] the blessing upon your life is keeping
[1:02:51] your eyes on the word of God when Elisha
[1:02:55] was was was was directed there and the
[1:02:57] mantle came across his life it's just
[1:02:59] like when the Holy Spirit takes a hold
[1:03:01] of a life and they begin to repent of
[1:03:04] their sins begin to seek after God how
[1:03:06] could you and I seek after God if God
[1:03:09] hadn't come and knocked on our
[1:03:11] hearts is that right but Elisha notice
[1:03:15] he be he burns every bridge behind him
[1:03:18] he separates from all unbelief let me
[1:03:20] tell you something you don't need a
[1:03:21] prophet to tell you everything that's
[1:03:23] wrong in your life right amen are you
[1:03:26] hearing me the word of God the prophet
[1:03:28] the holy spirit is still here and
[1:03:30] there's things listen if you'll step out
[1:03:32] in faith the word has said this the word
[1:03:35] said I'm to dress like this the word
[1:03:37] said I'm to forsake this the word said
[1:03:39] I'm to lay that down if you'll keep your
[1:03:42] eyes on the word it will take you
[1:03:44] through to
[1:03:48] Victory and the thing that once mastered
[1:03:51] and ruled your life you will now rule it
[1:03:57] H
[1:03:58] Hallelujah Peter got to looking at the
[1:04:01] waves Glory my he looking I mean the
[1:04:06] wind is blowing conditions I mean let
[1:04:08] alone you're walking on water but then
[1:04:10] the conditions right the conventions
[1:04:12] became
[1:04:14] tumultuous oh my they were they weren't
[1:04:16] they weren't listen who who's Ever
[1:04:18] Walked on Water besides the Lord Jesus
[1:04:21] then put conditions with it the
[1:04:24] conditions did not Merit even a stroll
[1:04:27] down a
[1:04:28] sidewalk boisterous wind a storm let
[1:04:31] alone walking on the water but you see
[1:04:34] what mattered was is the word had spoke
[1:04:37] to his heart you know God can take a
[1:04:40] heart and a life and speak to that heart
[1:04:42] they might read a track it may not even
[1:04:44] be they picked up the Bible at first but
[1:04:46] there's been a track that's been written
[1:04:48] and that track they begin to recognize
[1:04:50] and think where am I what is my purpose
[1:04:53] what am I doing here what what why am I
[1:04:56] here why is my life this way you know
[1:04:58] God could inspire a person to ride a
[1:05:00] track like that here's the end result is
[1:05:03] the same God that could Inspire it that
[1:05:05] way that will cause you to reflect in
[1:05:07] that way if you'll yield to him the
[1:05:09] spirit of truth will take you into all
[1:05:12] the truth which is the person of Jesus
[1:05:16] Christ himself he'll take you all the
[1:05:19] way God takes you and I all the way it's
[1:05:23] up to us Lord just keep me on track Lord
[1:05:26] notice what he feared happened he got to
[1:05:30] looking at the waves and the conditions
[1:05:32] and what he feared happened what he
[1:05:35] believed happened and when he believed
[1:05:38] he could walk he walked when he believed
[1:05:41] and got scared in his belief
[1:05:44] then his substance left him faith is the
[1:05:50] substance of things hoped for but when
[1:05:53] he got to looking at the way the
[1:05:56] substance left
[1:05:58] him are you hearing me this is why it's
[1:06:01] very important listen this is very
[1:06:02] important why the prophet said that you
[1:06:04] want to make sure you don't yoke up and
[1:06:06] cutan me up with unbelievers you might
[1:06:08] say well my spouse is not a Believer
[1:06:10] that's not what we're talking about
[1:06:12] we're talking about being completely
[1:06:14] identified with Jesus Christ let me tell
[1:06:16] you something you I tell you God can
[1:06:18] bring it in such a way through the book
[1:06:20] of Peter Paul laid it down in the book
[1:06:22] of Corinthians that you can live such a
[1:06:24] salty and a sweet swe life and a
[1:06:26] character of Jesus Christ through your
[1:06:28] life that will cause your husband or
[1:06:30] your wife to take notice there's
[1:06:32] something different here and this is a
[1:06:35] real Christian let me tell you something
[1:06:37] Satan is always in the business of
[1:06:39] trying to put fear in the hearts when it
[1:06:41] comes to God's word cuz he knows the
[1:06:44] power of this word working in a life of
[1:06:47] a Believer and when that word begins to
[1:06:49] work in a life you become a display of
[1:06:52] God's grace and this gospel will walk in
[1:06:54] shoe leather with places that it may
[1:06:57] never have got to before but you become
[1:06:59] a living witness of the grace of
[1:07:02] almighty God you can underestimate
[1:07:04] yourself but don't ever underestimate
[1:07:07] the word of
[1:07:08] [Applause]
[1:07:13] God oh friends I'm talking about God's
[1:07:17] word then his substance left him he
[1:07:21] still professed his faith the prophet
[1:07:23] said but he didn't have the substance
[1:07:26] that substance would have went right
[1:07:28] over top of the white cap and went right
[1:07:30] onto him if he has the perfect face but
[1:07:34] he didn't have it he thought he did he
[1:07:37] did at
[1:07:39] first notice he did at
[1:07:43] first he didn't swim out he had
[1:07:46] substance
[1:07:47] Faith but when he got to looking in
[1:07:49] other things right this is why the
[1:07:52] prophet said when you are
[1:07:53] healed don't go out in company with
[1:07:58] unbelievers where they're my friends or
[1:08:00] they're my buddy let me just say this to
[1:08:02] you there ain't no buddies or friends in
[1:08:04] Hell job said hell is naked there ain't
[1:08:08] no ain't no such things as my buddies
[1:08:10] and my friends this is why that within
[1:08:12] this right here you always want to
[1:08:13] evaluate every relationship in your life
[1:08:16] is is it adding value in your life or
[1:08:19] taking value from your life the word
[1:08:21] will never take value or devalue your
[1:08:24] life but the word will always bring
[1:08:27] value to your life because the word
[1:08:29] itself is the very character of almighty
[1:08:33] God hallelujah hallelujah and here his
[1:08:36] substance it begin to leave him it begin
[1:08:39] to it begin to move out as he begin to
[1:08:41] look at other things this is why brother
[1:08:42] BR says associate with people who
[1:08:45] believe like you believe that's why
[1:08:48] sometimes you might be able to talk to
[1:08:50] somebody at work and there's a good
[1:08:52] conversation and then maybe the next day
[1:08:54] here they are are and man I mean it's
[1:08:57] just a mess of what's going on you know
[1:08:59] at that time as a Son of God you excuse
[1:09:02] yourself cuz you realize this is not an
[1:09:05] atmosphere that's Fit For A Son of God
[1:09:07] to dwell in the Bible said cast not your
[1:09:10] pearls before swi you are not called to
[1:09:13] prove anything it is God who proves his
[1:09:16] word through your
[1:09:19] life so don't let the devil beat you up
[1:09:22] and run you down you are called to be an
[1:09:24] example and God will prove his word and
[1:09:27] does through your life
[1:09:29] amen but he lost that he he had Faith at
[1:09:32] first and he was willing to venture out
[1:09:34] W the Lord told me to do it it's got to
[1:09:36] happen so he steps down right out of the
[1:09:38] boat and takes off he never thought
[1:09:39] about it the waves and how contrary they
[1:09:42] would he never got that in his mind but
[1:09:45] when you get to thinking well now wait
[1:09:49] you know I've been sick so long the
[1:09:52] prophet said stop you might as well go
[1:09:55] back to the boat but when you quit
[1:09:57] thinking about that you say brother
[1:10:00] Samuel what am I I've been sick for so
[1:10:02] long or maybe I battled this besetting
[1:10:05] sin so long or I've carried this weight
[1:10:07] for so long and I've tried to overcome
[1:10:09] it but you know what what you need to do
[1:10:11] is like Peter when you see the word in
[1:10:14] our midst and he's dealing with your
[1:10:16] life ask the word bid me to come to you
[1:10:19] and don't take your eyes off the word
[1:10:22] that's Hallelujah the word will dismiss
[1:10:25] manle every fear the word will dismantle
[1:10:28] all unbelief the word will cause a
[1:10:30] confession to come from in here that
[1:10:33] will cast out anything that's unlike the
[1:10:36] word of
[1:10:37] God hallelujah the word has cleansing
[1:10:40] power within
[1:10:41] it Jesus said sanctify them through Thy
[1:10:44] word Thy word is true and we are washed
[1:10:48] with the washing of Water by the word
[1:10:50] hallelujah as we surrender as we submit
[1:10:53] the word it cleans
[1:10:57] oh my you might as well go back to the
[1:10:59] boat but when you quit thinking about
[1:11:03] that that's where Satan battles friends
[1:11:06] is right in our thoughts he knows if he
[1:11:09] can just maybe get one little thought or
[1:11:10] one little thing and try to cool you
[1:11:12] down a little bit just settle you down a
[1:11:15] little bit that's all he's interested in
[1:11:18] doing he just wants to get your eyes off
[1:11:22] of the one who is the word
[1:11:25] and I tell you what when you get your
[1:11:27] eyes on yourself you're in trouble when
[1:11:29] you get your eyes on your symptoms
[1:11:31] you're in trouble because let me tell
[1:11:32] you something you and I here we are in a
[1:11:35] natural body but as Sons and Daughters
[1:11:37] of God we are of the supernatural
[1:11:40] almighty God we are Sons and Daughters
[1:11:43] of God by the spirit of God that's
[1:11:45] dwelling in us this on the outside this
[1:11:47] ain't the real Samuel it only Bears the
[1:11:50] resemblance of that which is on the
[1:11:52] inside that's why the prophet said
[1:11:54] you've never seen seen the real William
[1:11:56] brandom the Will William brandom is that
[1:11:59] which is on the inside this only Bears
[1:12:02] the image and the reflection just like
[1:12:04] that wall takes those
[1:12:07] words that's good Hallelujah so as being
[1:12:10] there of Supernatural people we are
[1:12:13] called it called to battle against those
[1:12:16] Supernatural forces now you and I listen
[1:12:19] just our own thinking won't do it but
[1:12:21] our thinking has got to be the word
[1:12:25] isn't it amazing sometimes we how Satan
[1:12:27] wants to so pile things on and M we come
[1:12:30] out and we think man I got a clear week
[1:12:31] ahead of me and all of a sudden there is
[1:12:33] so many things that come your way
[1:12:36] they're not even on your reminders list
[1:12:39] you don't even have bells set for him on
[1:12:41] your calendar but it comes your way and
[1:12:44] and it's just things that you know can
[1:12:46] just begin to so bombard your mind until
[1:12:49] your mind itself it's just trying to
[1:12:51] take your vision away from the word of
[1:12:54] God W that's Satan that's one of his
[1:12:57] tactics is to try to do that because if
[1:13:00] we get our eyes off the word then that's
[1:13:02] where we lose our
[1:13:06] Victory now watch this Abraham I love
[1:13:08] this I I I love this in the word and the
[1:13:11] prophet quotes this scripture out of out
[1:13:12] of Romans 4 Abraham considered not his
[1:13:16] own body now dead neither the deadness
[1:13:18] of Sarah's womb he watch this he didn't
[1:13:21] think about it didn't even consider it
[1:13:24] now let's look at this for a minute he
[1:13:26] didn't think about it do you think that
[1:13:28] the thought didn't come through his
[1:13:30] mind sure it
[1:13:34] did Abraham how do you want your oats
[1:13:37] this morning
[1:13:41] honey huh you think the thought you
[1:13:46] think the thought didn't come the
[1:13:47] thoughts came but he didn't dwell on
[1:13:50] [Applause]
[1:13:52] it the word itself is what cast that
[1:13:56] that thought out brought it in obedience
[1:13:59] to the word that was already spoken yes
[1:14:02] sir watch this he didn't even consider
[1:14:04] it that means to dwell and come into the
[1:14:06] Mind's Eye focus upon it it wasn't even
[1:14:09] brought to the understanding why because
[1:14:12] the Bible said who against hope believed
[1:14:14] in hope that he might be the father of
[1:14:17] many nations the expectation was there
[1:14:20] you're not going to get any younger
[1:14:22] there's nothing going to change in your
[1:14:24] life there's no condition but he
[1:14:27] believed in Hope why how did he have
[1:14:29] hope because Faith Delivered to him an
[1:14:32] expectation God has said that I would be
[1:14:36] a father of many nations and he's
[1:14:38] revealed that Sarah is the
[1:14:42] channel that's
[1:14:44] right I know in our minds we think when
[1:14:47] I when I read this I go over and I
[1:14:49] appreciate these things in the scripture
[1:14:50] Genesis 17 the Bible said when God told
[1:14:53] him you're going to bury it ain't going
[1:14:55] to be Ishmael it's going to be through
[1:14:57] Sarah it's going to be Isaac and the
[1:14:59] Bible said he laughed right that's where
[1:15:03] you get Isaac's name he laughed now but
[1:15:05] you don't find that in the New Testament
[1:15:08] you don't find that you find in Romans 4
[1:15:11] he staggered not at the promise of God
[1:15:14] he was strong giving praise to God but
[1:15:17] here in the Old Testament it allows you
[1:15:20] to see that Humanity but it begins to
[1:15:22] show you in the New Testament that God
[1:15:25] has never ever considered our Humanity
[1:15:29] he knows we are but flesh but he is the
[1:15:32] remedy he's the one that gives us
[1:15:34] strength to where you and I can say how
[1:15:36] could I have laughed how could I have
[1:15:38] doubted but it's something down on the
[1:15:40] inside of you as a real son and daughter
[1:15:43] of God that's magnetized to the promise
[1:15:46] of God to believe God above every
[1:15:49] circumstance Hall
[1:15:53] my it wasn't even in
[1:15:55] understanding if you talked to Abraham
[1:15:57] you might have thought he was living in
[1:15:59] denial remember he was making payments
[1:16:03] on the
[1:16:06] baby are you hearing me this is why the
[1:16:09] needs you've got in your life you need
[1:16:11] to start making payments on it payments
[1:16:13] how do I make payments on it begin to
[1:16:15] say Thank You Lord thank you for the
[1:16:17] promise maybe it's the promise of the
[1:16:19] Holy Ghost thank you Lord for the Holy
[1:16:21] Ghost thank you Lord God for healing in
[1:16:24] my life thank thank you for deliverance
[1:16:26] Lord you need to begin to thank God for
[1:16:28] the promise because the truth is it's
[1:16:30] already a finished work it's just our
[1:16:32] faith raising to that
[1:16:34] place oh notice he didn't even consider
[1:16:37] it all he just considered what God Said
[1:16:39] and went on as long as Peter did that he
[1:16:46] walked amen this is the same Peter that
[1:16:49] said at Thy word amen I'll let down the
[1:16:53] net amen right it was Elijah that said
[1:16:56] on Mount Carmel I've done all this at
[1:16:58] Thy word right you see you always want
[1:17:01] to make sure that what you're doing is
[1:17:03] according to the word of
[1:17:04] God the word the Bible tells us in
[1:17:07] Hebrews 12 and verse 2 looking unto
[1:17:10] Jesus who's the author and finisher of
[1:17:13] our faith I thought that was beautiful
[1:17:16] and so such a uh an incredible point on
[1:17:19] Sunday I know it's very simple but it's
[1:17:21] very true even when we're coming for any
[1:17:24] request that we have don't look for
[1:17:27] anything else but
[1:17:30] Jesus I like that that's good well my
[1:17:33] friend did this you don't want to do
[1:17:34] what your friend did cuz you're just an
[1:17:37] impersonator you want to get your eyes
[1:17:39] on
[1:17:40] Jesus is keep your eyes on him looking
[1:17:43] you have besetting sin you have weights
[1:17:46] remember then how do we loosen this the
[1:17:48] Bible said lay them aside but notice we
[1:17:51] receive our strength and our confidence
[1:17:53] the molding and and making and
[1:17:55] perfecting of our life by looking unto
[1:17:58] Jesus you know how powerful it is to see
[1:18:01] the Lord Jesus to look to him you may
[1:18:03] not even see everything already in your
[1:18:06] life but if you can clutch a glimpse of
[1:18:10] him you can stand like Paul wrote it in
[1:18:12] the book of Hebrews and said we see not
[1:18:15] all things but we see
[1:18:18] Jesus why he is the end of all
[1:18:23] things Hallelujah I see him I see the
[1:18:27] Messiah Among Us I see his sign Among Us
[1:18:30] I see him vindicating his word I may not
[1:18:33] understand it all but I know it's him I
[1:18:35] know he's touching my life I may not see
[1:18:38] everything but I see
[1:18:41] him therefore we look not at things that
[1:18:45] are seen But at things that are unseen
[1:18:48] right is that right cuz the things that
[1:18:50] are seen are temporal your symptoms are
[1:18:52] temporal your conditions are temporal
[1:18:55] your failures are temporal mistakes are
[1:18:58] temporal your shortcomings are temporal
[1:19:01] come on Friends your fears are temporal
[1:19:04] but that which is of the Unseen is
[1:19:07] eternal I'm talking about the word of
[1:19:10] God that will give you strength in this
[1:19:13] [Applause]
[1:19:15] life yes
[1:19:17] [Music]
[1:19:20] sir my symptoms themselves
[1:19:25] that's the greatest brother brandom
[1:19:26] called it like this symptoms I'm just
[1:19:27] trying to get somewhere to tie this
[1:19:29] together here symptoms is the worst
[1:19:34] enemy because God has to fight against
[1:19:37] symptoms symptoms listen you know why
[1:19:40] cuz symptoms are something tangible I
[1:19:42] feel this I sense this there they seem
[1:19:46] so real nobody's saying that they're not
[1:19:48] real God never told never said about
[1:19:51] those 10 that came back saying there
[1:19:52] were giants over there he never said you
[1:19:54] guys are liars ain't no Giants over

[1:20:11] you know he said here those 10 those 10
[1:20:14] uh spies they brought the Giants in the
[1:20:16] camp by their conversation
[1:20:19] right they talked about him until it was
[1:20:22] wailing in every house
[1:20:25] wow is you see fear spreads like
[1:20:28] wildfire yeah it'll spread they they had
[1:20:31] a morning session every home was mour by
[1:20:35] their testimony are you hearing me their
[1:20:38] testimony brought Giants and nobody else
[1:20:41] saw it brought them
[1:20:43] present what about Believers where the
[1:20:46] word of God is pulsating in our heart
[1:20:49] that we can bring Jesus Christ present
[1:20:52] to know that I'm Healed I'm delivered
[1:20:56] I'm free because the word has said so
[1:20:59] it's finished at Calvary the death blow
[1:21:02] has been
[1:21:05] dealt has a Believer called to bring
[1:21:09] Jesus presence to call him on the
[1:21:14] scene
[1:21:16] hallelu Abraham you're a little
[1:21:22] Hunchback how many years now it's
[1:21:25] greater Miracle what' you say I said
[1:21:27] greater
[1:21:29] Miracle it was already a miracle when he
[1:21:32] called me and got a hold of my life drew
[1:21:34] me away from my family gave me breathed
[1:21:37] into my life a real strength and give me
[1:21:40] a peace he even guided me through
[1:21:42] everything give me Grace to separate
[1:21:45] from my daddy from lot all along the way
[1:21:47] he gave me Grace that even when I
[1:21:49] filtered he gave me Grace to rise back
[1:21:51] up again thank you Lord matter fact you
[1:21:55] talking about a miracle I am a
[1:21:58] [Applause]
[1:22:02] miracle he maybe couldn't shout like he

[1:22:08] [Applause]
[1:22:10] fire hallelujah look at you oh it's a
[1:22:13] greater Miracle but look you you can't
[1:22:15] even you can't even father children no
[1:22:16] more stream of life is dried up but it's
[1:22:19] a greater Miracle look at Sarah's life
[1:22:22] it's a greater miracle
[1:22:25] now let's get back here to Peter here
[1:22:28] try to bring this
[1:22:31] together you know Peter he didn't get
[1:22:33] out of the boat and try to look for a
[1:22:35] bridge you know sometimes we we can look
[1:22:38] at the word and we're trying to find out
[1:22:40] how H how's it going to be we don't have
[1:22:44] to worry about the how that's true you
[1:22:46] know if you just take those three
[1:22:47] letters of how and move them around
[1:22:50] you'll recognize it's the greatest thing
[1:22:51] you can see is who yeah it's not how
[1:22:55] it's who who it is that's speaking unto
[1:22:58] you not the how you you how and the
[1:23:01] brother Ram told us like this he said
[1:23:03] that wasn't Abraham's business how it's
[1:23:05] going to happen it ain't your business
[1:23:06] ain't my business it ain't my business
[1:23:08] to watch how God he'll change and
[1:23:10] transform my life I don't know how he
[1:23:11] does it but I know he does it he did it
[1:23:13] for me and I've watched him change other
[1:23:15] lives I don't need to know the mechanics
[1:23:17] of it I just know the Dynamics of it it
[1:23:21] works the word works
[1:23:23] [Applause]
[1:23:26] how many witnesses with me on that Peter
[1:23:29] didn't go looking for a bridge you know
[1:23:31] some underwater
[1:23:33] prop how can I walk over here now he's
[1:23:36] already made me to come how am I going
[1:23:37] to get there he he he didn't even look
[1:23:39] for that you know what God had asked him
[1:23:41] to do something he had never done before
[1:23:44] God might be asking you to do something
[1:23:45] you've never done before but if you'll
[1:23:48] listen to the word the word will take
[1:23:51] you and direct you all the way through
[1:23:53] amen come on friends when God got a hold
[1:23:55] of Our Lives it doesn't matter if you
[1:23:57] were raised in a message church when God
[1:23:59] got a hold of our life it's a new walk
[1:24:01] it's a new way things begin to change
[1:24:04] about our life like Ruth coming back
[1:24:06] into the land our dress begins to change
[1:24:08] we're conforming to the word of God our
[1:24:11] language begins to change why because
[1:24:13] the grace of God in the land is dealing
[1:24:16] with our life we're walking among people
[1:24:18] rubbing shoulders among people that we
[1:24:20] never thought we would be in the midst
[1:24:22] of before but here in the presence of
[1:24:25] God we are walking in accordance to
[1:24:27] God's word and God will see us
[1:24:31] through Hallelujah Peter how you going
[1:24:34] to how's this going no Peter that was
[1:24:37] not even in his
[1:24:38] mind he wasn't in his mind how are you
[1:24:40] going to make it through this how are
[1:24:42] you going to get over this how are you
[1:24:44] going to the word has said
[1:24:50] come I think that's powerful friends cuz
[1:24:53] we can set in the service and the word
[1:24:55] of God can move right among us and we
[1:24:57] can close our Bibles and get up out of
[1:24:59] church and
[1:25:00] nothing this is why when the word of God
[1:25:03] and the spirit of God is moving you need
[1:25:05] to have some dialogue with his presence
[1:25:08] when the spirit of God is moving and
[1:25:10] speaking you need to say Lord pass by my
[1:25:12] way blind barus had a need he knew he
[1:25:16] was coming by and blind barus said thou
[1:25:19] son of David have mercy on me be quiet
[1:25:22] boy be quiet be quiet we don't do that
[1:25:24] around here be quiet he crowed the
[1:25:27] louder it wasn't because of his loud
[1:25:29] screaming his
[1:25:32] faith his faith stopped the
[1:25:37] master and that's the same thing right
[1:25:39] in this service as we come to the house
[1:25:41] of God let me tell you something you
[1:25:43] might have only a speck of Faith but if
[1:25:45] you'll let that Speck of Faith go
[1:25:47] tonight and say God come Lord speak to
[1:25:51] my heart speak to my life Lord consume
[1:25:53] my life Lord take this out of my life if
[1:25:56] you lay it out like that watch God come
[1:25:59] by let me tell you that's why we don't
[1:26:01] come to the house of God to be

[1:26:20] want the word to speak to my heart

[1:26:36] of there's some unbelief we need to walk
[1:26:39] out of there's some sin we need to walk

[1:26:59] see when you get
[1:27:00] out don't take him put your eyes back on
[1:27:03] your
[1:27:04] circumstance well the doctor said I
[1:27:06] might have this the that's the best of
[1:27:07] his knowledge when he says you might
[1:27:09] have that the rest of your life but
[1:27:11] there's another report that says by his
[1:27:14] stripes you are healed there's another
[1:27:17] report I'm the Lord that Health all thy
[1:27:19] diseases there's another report that
[1:27:21] says he is still that ever present God
[1:27:25] who can be placed in the waters of the
[1:27:27] bitterness of sickness and situation and
[1:27:30] he will sweeten the Waters of
[1:27:33] marrow

[1:28:04] same God that has taken a hold of your
[1:28:05] life and transform your life is the same
[1:28:08] God that can take a hold of a loved
[1:28:10] one's life and transform it let me tell
[1:28:11] you what the prophet said in the message
[1:28:13] Paradox he said you can take a man
[1:28:15] that's sitting in a meeting like this
[1:28:17] and criticize it he said you watch God
[1:28:19] take a hold of that man that man will
[1:28:21] become the biggest testimony that God
[1:28:23] has of the power of God why God takes a
[1:28:27] hold of that
[1:28:29] man so
[1:28:32] good hallelujah
[1:28:34] hallelujah we just want to listen and we
[1:28:37] want to take the word now let me let me
[1:28:39] get down on this now now let me narrow
[1:28:42] it down on
[1:28:43] this staying on track and sometimes we
[1:28:47] got to get back on
[1:28:48] track remember the prophet in the vision
[1:28:51] of the Bride in the preview yes
[1:28:54] she was walking and step but she got her
[1:28:57] eyes on the church world right got her
[1:29:01] eyes on and she just was watching them
[1:29:03] go and go and oh my how bad it's getting
[1:29:07] well the Bible said when you begin to
[1:29:09] see these things lift up your head for
[1:29:13] your Redemption draws nigh in other
[1:29:15] words don't become the chief political
[1:29:17] expert on things don't become the expert
[1:29:19] on all this well brother brother Samuel
[1:29:23] the prophet said where do plant potatoes
[1:29:24] till he come that's true but he didn't
[1:29:26] tell you to become a potato
[1:29:28] expert he didn't tell you to set up shop
[1:29:30] at at the I Center on how to grow all
[1:29:32] these varieties of of potatoes and what
[1:29:34] that is talking about you commit every
[1:29:36] need physical need but don't ever let
[1:29:38] your physical needs be put before your
[1:29:40] spiritual needs your heavenly father
[1:29:42] knows exactly what you have need of the
[1:29:45] Bible said seek you first the kingdom of
[1:29:46] God and his righteousness and all these
[1:29:50] other things will be added unto you how
[1:29:53] many know that's the truth truth that's
[1:29:55] God's
[1:29:56] word so sometimes notice I love how
[1:29:58] brother Ram takes this in desperation he
[1:30:01] said of how Peter he said You know here
[1:30:03] he was he got he got scared and he says
[1:30:07] like this he says though a mistake in
[1:30:10] trying to follow the Commandments of God
[1:30:12] now not that he was mistaken for
[1:30:14] following the word of God but he made a
[1:30:17] mistake by getting his eyes off the word
[1:30:21] right is that right the man man was
[1:30:24] doing what God told him to do he said
[1:30:26] now you Christian tonight you're in the
[1:30:28] line of duty trying to follow the
[1:30:30] leading of the Holy Spirit and a cancer
[1:30:32] grabs you death grabs you a cancer
[1:30:35] tubercular whatever it is in the line of
[1:30:38] duty you have the same right that Peter
[1:30:41] had Lord save me or I'll perish in
[1:30:44] desperation he called out and a hand
[1:30:46] reached and picked him up you have the
[1:30:48] same thing but he screamed out save me
[1:30:51] Lord he heard my despairing cry from the
[1:30:54] Waters Lifted Me Now safe am I that's it
[1:30:57] when you cry

[1:31:02] just going to have faith let me tell you
[1:31:04] something if you're sinking that's a
[1:31:05] time of humility to say Lord save
[1:31:09] me you know that's Faith come on
[1:31:12] somebody well you know you you shouldn't
[1:31:14] have to have hands laid on you that's
[1:31:15] the word of God yes amen are you hearing
[1:31:18] me sometimes we've got ways that we're
[1:31:21] trying to make God come on our terms and
[1:31:23] we've got a come according to God's word
[1:31:26] if you want a miracle you have to follow
[1:31:28] the word amen are you hearing me now
[1:31:31] this is why the greatest Miracle has Our
[1:31:34] Sister Christina walked into this water
[1:31:36] she is walking into this water and God
[1:31:39] has given the instructions of repent and
[1:31:42] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:31:45] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:31:47] Holy Ghost you do what the word says
[1:31:50] first and then the miracle will follow

[1:31:54] is that right Hallelujah put your faith
[1:31:58] in the word I don't care how many times

[1:32:03] tired of using My Own Strength I'm going
[1:32:06] to surrender my strength to the word
[1:32:08] because if you'll surrender to the word

[1:33:40] he gave his word and his word is to
[1:33:43] every generation now when sickness came
[1:33:46] in or sin came into the camp of Israel
[1:33:49] in numbers 21 the Bible says in verse 7
[1:33:51] the people came to Moses and they said
[1:33:53] said we have sinned for we have spoken
[1:33:55] against the Lord and against thee first
[1:33:57] thing they recognize they're
[1:33:59] wrong are you hearing me now we're
[1:34:01] talking about getting back on track they
[1:34:02] recognized they were wrong they prayed
[1:34:05] unto the Lord that he take away the
[1:34:06] serpents from us and Moses prayed for
[1:34:08] the people and the Lord said unto Moses
[1:34:11] make thee a fiery serpent set it upon a
[1:34:13] pole and it shall come to pass that
[1:34:15] everyone that is bitten when he lookth
[1:34:18] upon it shall live not just to look on
[1:34:22] it just to say my
[1:34:24] my there it is but look at is able to
[1:34:26] see the end of that poison able to see
[1:34:30] the end of that snake bite you know how

[1:34:51] they confess their sin Let Me Tell You
[1:34:53] Friend friends that is the greatest
[1:34:55] thing that Satan has wanted to take from
[1:34:57] the Church of the Living God and I'm
[1:34:59] going to say it I think it's something
[1:35:00] he's wanted to take from the message
[1:35:03] ranks it's been put to such a place
[1:35:06] where this where this let me tell you
[1:35:08] you've got to follow the Divine
[1:35:09] prescription that God has laid out we
[1:35:12] are sons of God but we got to come
[1:35:14] according to the word and the word is
[1:35:16] the path back into the Homeland we never
[1:35:19] are above the word of Acts
[1:35:22] 238 is that right quoting right out of
[1:35:25] the message indictment just as it's
[1:35:26] coming we've got a path right back into
[1:35:29] sunship right through the word so if
[1:35:31] there's anything in our life we want to
[1:35:34] get it
[1:35:34] out now Peter himself here's confession
[1:35:39] was Lord forgive me I got my eyes on
[1:35:42] symptoms I got my eyes off the word
[1:35:45] there's repentance right there save me I
[1:35:49] got my eyes on my own circumstance Lord
[1:35:52] forgive me I got in my eyes and had my
[1:35:55] own pity
[1:35:57] party we got quiet now but I'm talking
[1:36:01] about Victory and Liberty in our life am
[1:36:04] so you want to be able to look and see
[1:36:06] the end of that you want to be able to
[1:36:08] see the end of the Tormentor you want to
[1:36:10] see the end the Bible said you should
[1:36:13] see the desire upon your
[1:36:15] enemy are you hearing me you want to
[1:36:17] have clear eyesight you can eyes can't
[1:36:20] be clear as long as there's unconfessed
[1:36:22] sin you've got to get sin confess and
[1:36:24] get it out oh brother Samuel you know I
[1:36:26] don't ever sin the Bible said whosoever
[1:36:28] said he didn't sin is a liar he's
[1:36:31] deceived this is why Paul said I got to
[1:36:33] Die daily I'm not talking about a loose
[1:36:35] life but we realize sometimes we've
[1:36:37] entertained the wrong thought sometimes
[1:36:39] we've even said the wrong things and
[1:36:41] sometimes it isn't even what we've said
[1:36:43] we've reacted on thoughts that have come
[1:36:45] into our mind that is no more of God
[1:36:48] than nothing
[1:36:50] Hallelujah Lord have mercy
[1:36:53] we want to look on this we want to look
[1:36:55] on this serpent that's already been
[1:36:57] judged sin is judged I don't have to
[1:37:00] live with it any longer you can tell the
[1:37:02] devil tonight you might have rode in my
[1:37:04] car with me but you got to find another
[1:37:06] way

[1:37:15] home you're not welcome in my
[1:37:17] life
[1:37:21] hallu that is so good and when they
[1:37:24] beheld The Serpent of brass they lived
[1:37:27] they looked at it in the right way they
[1:37:30] received the virtue that the word had
[1:37:32] given they received it in their life and
[1:37:36] you know what it did it took care of
[1:37:37] every of every venomous every venomous
[1:37:39] symptom it took care of every symptom of
[1:37:42] the poison of that of unbelief and sin
[1:37:44] it takes care of it let me tell you
[1:37:46] something I do not worry about when I
[1:37:48] take medicine oh my little Aon when I
[1:37:50] take medicine I don't try to figure it
[1:37:52] out it's this going to go to this and is
[1:37:55] this going to I don't have to do that I
[1:37:57] just take the antibiotic as it's
[1:38:00] prescribed and if I'll do and take the
[1:38:03] medicine as it's been prescribed the
[1:38:06] medicine will go to
[1:38:10] work brother and sister in this day God
[1:38:13] didn't give us a new prescription he
[1:38:15] just to tore the seals off and restored
[1:38:18] the original prescription to the Church
[1:38:20] of the Living God repent be baptized in
[1:38:24] the name of Jesus Christ and you shall
[1:38:26] receive the gift of the Holy
[1:38:28] Ghost brother we didn't have just some
[1:38:31] little guy coming out of the lab this
[1:38:33] was the chief pharmacist himself this is
[1:38:36] the great physician that has stepped
[1:38:39] down in this
[1:38:40] hour Hallelujah the conditions the need
[1:38:43] called for
[1:38:46] it hallelu oh my brother Samuel what
[1:38:49] does this have to do with overcoming
[1:38:50] fear everything
[1:38:54] because when we get our eyes off the
[1:38:56] word and get anybody been distracted you
[1:38:58] know how they say it on the road no
[1:39:01] texting and driving right I've got
[1:39:03] friends I've got buddies and they do it
[1:39:06] I want to grab their
[1:39:08] phone they're putting it up above
[1:39:10] they're steering well doing it I almost
[1:39:12] want to say let me out of the van and
[1:39:13] you go ahead and
[1:39:15] go there ain't no text message from
[1:39:18] nobody that's worth that's right getting
[1:39:21] in an accident for right you know what
[1:39:23] that's called distracted driving you
[1:39:25] know what distracted is is to get your
[1:39:27] attraction your attention off of where
[1:39:30] you need to be focused and Satan has got
[1:39:32] a lot of distractions at this hour he's
[1:39:35] got a lot of enticements to try to lure
[1:39:38] and pull upon that flesh pull upon your
[1:39:41] spirit listen friends even with things
[1:39:43] that you yourself or I could look at and
[1:39:45] say well this isn't necessarily sin or
[1:39:48] this isn't sin sometimes you'll get our
[1:39:50] attention and we'll get distracted off
[1:39:52] on a hurt or an offense or a grudge or
[1:39:54] bitterness and we'll get our eyes all
[1:39:56] off of where we need to and we wonder
[1:39:59] how am I sinking well we're sinking cuz
[1:40:01] we got our eyes off the word but if we
[1:40:04] can look and say Lord save
[1:40:06] me there's a strong hand that can reach
[1:40:09] right down and lift us up brother he'll
[1:40:12] Lift us up and he'll walk us right where
[1:40:14] we need to be you step out of your ship
[1:40:17] and let him he'll take you to where you
[1:40:19] need to
[1:40:20] be praise name Hallelujah let me
[1:40:24] let's close on this here 2 Chronicles
[1:40:27] 6:24 yall almost get to where you don't
[1:40:29] believe me when I say that 2 Chronicles
[1:40:32] 6:24 but watch this there's a lot lot
[1:40:35] you can read this whole chapter later on
[1:40:36] you're familiar with it but when you
[1:40:37] read it just look how it says when
[1:40:39] Israel would get in trouble in any
[1:40:41] situation they get in trouble if thy
[1:40:44] people this is Solomon's Prayer be put
[1:40:46] to the worst before the enemy because
[1:40:49] they have sinned against thee and shall
[1:40:52] return and confess thy
[1:40:55] name and pray and make supplication
[1:40:59] before thee in this house then hear thou
[1:41:03] from the heavens and forgive the sin of
[1:41:06] thy People Israel and bring them again
[1:41:08] unto the land which thou gavest them and
[1:41:12] to their
[1:41:13] fathers you see how simple that is you
[1:41:16] know what that just takes just
[1:41:18] humility brother brah tells us the whole
[1:41:20] prescription he says remember
[1:41:23] where you've drifted
[1:41:25] from
[1:41:29] repent and God will bring you back
[1:41:32] there'll be a return remember repent
[1:41:36] return that's God's prescription notice
[1:41:39] God made that provision even where
[1:41:41] Solomon would make that prayer and I
[1:41:44] think tonight as we stand if there's
[1:41:47] things that we can look at let's just
[1:41:49] stand in his
[1:41:50] presence we want to be like Jonah Jonah
[1:41:53] Jonah Jonah held on this
[1:41:56] prayer brother Aaron Jonah held on this
[1:41:59] prayer here is Solomon had prayed this
[1:42:02] prayer but Jonah
[1:42:03] knew his confidence was it was God that
[1:42:08] had made
[1:42:09] intercession through
[1:42:11] Solomon and Jonah had went down God
[1:42:16] called him to go to
[1:42:19] neva but Jonah took a ship to Tarsus and
[1:42:23] you know why I took that ship brother
[1:42:25] Brown tells us in a man running from the
[1:42:27] presence of
[1:42:28] God that Jonah took that ship because he
[1:42:33] thought the people wouldn't hear
[1:42:37] him his
[1:42:40] thinking caused him to take that
[1:42:43] ship but you know
[1:42:45] what even in the midst of that
[1:42:49] time here he is thrown over the ship
[1:42:53] here's here here's where it
[1:42:54] starts the guys are like what's going on
[1:42:57] let's loosen the ship let's throw this
[1:42:58] over throw this over throw this
[1:43:00] over finally Jonah here's
[1:43:04] confession right here's
[1:43:06] confession throw me I'm the problem I
[1:43:11] wonder how many of us tonight could say
[1:43:12] Lord I want to throw my attitude out
[1:43:15] amen I want to throw out my thinking
[1:43:17] about things I want to throw out my
[1:43:19] feeling feelings are real but they're
[1:43:21] they're they're not serving me they're
[1:43:23] taking me away from what you've called
[1:43:24] me to do I'm ready to get back on
[1:43:29] track and when they threw him over God
[1:43:31] had prepared a
[1:43:36] fish took a hold of Jonah took him
[1:43:40] down but Jonah in the midst of that time
[1:43:42] well I want you to watch the Power of
[1:43:44] repentance it was moving in his
[1:43:47] heart Jonah got down there he said
[1:43:50] though I'm cast out of thy sight Lord
[1:43:52] but yet I'll look to your Holy
[1:43:54] Temple Jonah which way is it I don't
[1:43:57] have a GPS out here but I've got God's
[1:43:59] positioning system inside here I just
[1:44:02] know to look to Faith in the promise
[1:44:03] that said if you're ever in trouble and
[1:44:05] they will humble themselves and call on
[1:44:07] my name I'll hear from heaven and here
[1:44:09] he was in the midst of a
[1:44:11] situation Jonah powerful words that we
[1:44:14] quote many times he spoke and
[1:44:17] said
[1:44:19] they that observe lying vanities right
[1:44:24] forsake their own mercies yes they do I
[1:44:28] tell you we can observe look contemplate
[1:44:30] focus in on the things that's around us
[1:44:33] and you know what it will do nothing for
[1:44:35] us but bring us down we start sinking we
[1:44:38] just start sinking in doubt we start
[1:44:41] sinking in in a place why when we get to
[1:44:45] looking and get our eyes off the word
[1:44:48] let me tell you something let me just
[1:44:49] say this very simple I know it's very
[1:44:51] simple but let me tell you friends when
[1:44:53] God gives you a promise in a service we
[1:44:55] might have sat here maybe for an
[1:44:59] hour and there might have been one thing
[1:45:01] that struck your
[1:45:03] heart one thing if you'll take whatever
[1:45:07] God spoke to your heart and you take
[1:45:09] that thing as the prophet said and you
[1:45:12] begin to nourish it you cherish it
[1:45:16] right you know you become sensitive to
[1:45:18] it you know when a my my wife I'm going
[1:45:21] to tell this honor and I hope I don't
[1:45:22] get nothing afterwards but my wife
[1:45:25] before our children came she was a sound
[1:45:29] sleeper but after the children came and
[1:45:31] even to this day one little move I think
[1:45:34] Zachary could move his toe she's
[1:45:38] up she's up it's just it's just that
[1:45:41] lurt that that attribute comes out right
[1:45:43] hey what's going on what's going on I
[1:45:45] mean this is not a a normal time for you
[1:45:47] to what what's going on something going
[1:45:48] on in your body what I'm trying to say
[1:45:51] is is when that after tribute was
[1:45:54] awakened now she's become sensitive to
[1:45:57] the needs of her
[1:45:59] household and see the word itself the
[1:46:02] spirit of God it comes breathes upon the
[1:46:03] word quickens the word to our heart take
[1:46:05] that word to your life and begin to
[1:46:08] nourish it become sensitive begin to
[1:46:09] pray over it brother Samuel it's just
[1:46:12] one promise listen it only takes one
[1:46:15] promise in the heart of a Believer and
[1:46:19] it can run every devil back to hell
[1:46:23] the Bible said and Jesus stood before
[1:46:25] the tomb of Lazarus Jesus
[1:46:27] wept you see when you take that word in
[1:46:29] your heart nourish it be sensitive to it

[1:46:39] let us nourish it let us cherish it and
[1:46:42] with real Godly discipline let us obey
[1:46:45] it that's what we want don't we amen
