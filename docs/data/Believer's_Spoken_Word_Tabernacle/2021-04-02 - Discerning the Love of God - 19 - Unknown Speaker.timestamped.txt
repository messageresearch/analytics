[35:48] charity wanteth not itself
[35:51] and is not puffed up or
[35:55] displays itself hardly
[35:58] you know this very term that we've
[36:00] looked at there's
[36:01] other parts here in the scripture that
[36:03] we lord willing will get to where it
[36:05] deals with this part
[36:06] and spirit of god would address this as
[36:09] being
[36:10] puffed up and it deals with
[36:13] uh to swell up from
[36:16] from a blowing to make proud or
[36:19] to bear one song bear oneself
[36:24] loftily you know you think about that
[36:29] many times we could walk outside and say
[36:31] my it's windy today
[36:33] but you don't see the wind but you feel
[36:37] it
[36:39] you see the wind as it's moving upon the
[36:43] leaves on the tree
[36:44] is that right many in the meetings
[36:47] didn't see the angel the lord but you
[36:50] saw him what he was doing
[36:52] that only he could be the one doing it
[36:54] so when we
[36:55] we look at this we know that that this
[36:59] this type of wind we don't we don't want
[37:01] that in our life of that which would
[37:03] elevate self but you know the reality is
[37:06] is that when we
[37:07] and ourselves if we would have an
[37:09] inflated idea
[37:11] or a thought it'll eventually show
[37:13] itself
[37:15] and we don't we only think we want to be
[37:17] is a billboard or a display
[37:20] of the love of god say lord just search
[37:23] me if there's anything
[37:24] in me lord that's not right guide me
[37:27] each day in each part of my life
[37:29] may god bless you bless the reading of
[37:31] the word as you're being seated
[37:34] to begin to you know you look at this
[37:37] and throughout the whole
[37:39] scriptures when paul is dealing with
[37:42] this
[37:43] charity of how this very
[37:46] the love of god would would be the
[37:49] governments
[37:50] of the church of the living god and we
[37:52] know that
[37:53] charity itself paul would write it never
[37:56] fails now we only know there's one who
[37:58] can't fail and that's god
[38:00] so we know that that when we're speaking
[38:02] of charity that
[38:04] of the love of god we're speaking of god
[38:06] we're speaking of his nature
[38:08] and this is where paul would say that
[38:10] the love of god is shed abroad
[38:12] in our hearts by that of the holy ghost
[38:15] and so when we when we would look at
[38:17] this and we
[38:19] are looking at the very divine nature of
[38:21] god we're looking at
[38:23] parts of attributes or characteristics
[38:26] that would come
[38:27] from the very nature of god and when
[38:31] we think of it that the divine nature of
[38:32] god when it comes into our lives
[38:35] surrendered lives by way of the new
[38:37] birth
[38:38] it's such a contrast to that of the
[38:41] first
[38:42] nature it's such a contrast and so
[38:46] there where you know at one point in
[38:47] time i think of it as i was just
[38:50] just looking at it here today and just
[38:52] reading just some things a particular
[38:54] quote and brother brown said
[38:55] he said before he said before
[38:58] you receive the holy ghost he said you
[39:01] weren't in a battle at all
[39:03] you know there wasn't a battle he said
[39:05] before you become a christian he said
[39:06] but as soon as you become a christian he
[39:08] says and you say
[39:10] i've got the holy ghost he said every
[39:13] gun out of hell
[39:14] is trained against you it's traps and
[39:17] everything that's set all around us
[39:19] and we realize this is we've been
[39:20] looking at this by
[39:22] the spirit of god that that maturity
[39:25] and an adoption of sons and daughters of
[39:28] god
[39:29] it's never for us to have our sight set
[39:31] in a place as though
[39:33] that we are going to reach a perfection
[39:35] in ourself
[39:36] as in a manner that well i'm never going
[39:38] to make a mistake or i'm never going to
[39:41] you know to fall into this where i say
[39:43] something i shouldn't have said but what
[39:44] we realize is that the longer and the
[39:47] more
[39:48] that as we're walking with god we come
[39:50] to a place to distrust
[39:51] our own abilities more and more we come
[39:54] to a place to rest
[39:56] upon him more and more we recognize our
[39:59] need
[40:00] and our littleness and that's the thing
[40:01] you can't you can't be close to god
[40:04] and still feel big but when you really
[40:06] get close to god now
[40:08] i'll say it like this a person could
[40:10] pray 12 hours a day but yet they're not
[40:12] praying
[40:12] they could come out of there they could
[40:14] pray 15 hours a day but if they never
[40:16] really enter into that place in prayer
[40:18] then they'll come out of there and they
[40:20] fill a stuffed shirt they've done
[40:21] something and they'll come out of there
[40:23] and instead of walking in humility
[40:25] they'll come out of there with such
[40:27] criticism and picking people apart and
[40:29] if you've not made it into the presence
[40:31] of god
[40:32] so coming into the friends of god is not
[40:34] about how long you stay
[40:36] how long you stay on your knees or maybe
[40:38] you're laying on your bed or
[40:39] you're walking around or you're driving
[40:41] your car but it's about
[40:43] really entering in and really enter into
[40:46] prayer
[40:47] and just really making it a place to
[40:48] where that you can come into those
[40:50] places we can come into those places to
[40:52] where
[40:53] it brings out brings more humility out
[40:56] in our lives
[40:57] and so we want to examine this here
[40:59] tonight i want to look here
[41:01] at the very character of god we've
[41:03] looked at
[41:04] here within of some some of the previous
[41:06] services
[41:07] and we've looked at certain parts and
[41:10] how that
[41:11] men would start out kings that were
[41:14] appointed kings but how they would allow
[41:17] something to arise in their life and to
[41:19] where
[41:20] it would take them from the very even
[41:23] where god had used them mightily but
[41:26] they would get to feeling so
[41:28] confident within themselves and we began
[41:31] looking at that we looked at
[41:32] nebuchadnezzar last week of how that god
[41:34] and his mercy and you think of it
[41:36] nebuchadnezzar wasn't a believer but yet
[41:39] god in his mercy
[41:40] would take that as an example to you and
[41:43] i
[41:44] as believers if god could have such a
[41:47] care and a respect
[41:48] because nebuchadnezzar was regarded as
[41:51] his servant to serve the purpose and
[41:54] will of god to bring
[41:56] judgment on egypt to bring that upon
[41:58] israel
[41:59] he served that purpose and god himself
[42:03] would allow him to come down
[42:05] to be consumed to a stump but not
[42:08] all the way and then here once he came
[42:11] to a place to recognize
[42:13] that it's god who put him in position
[42:15] it's god who gives authority
[42:17] it's god who gives power it's god who
[42:20] does all of these things
[42:22] once he came back to a place of
[42:24] realizing
[42:25] that this is not what i've done but this
[42:27] is what
[42:28] god has done you see god had to allow
[42:31] the situation to come
[42:33] in order for that hold of that spirit
[42:36] that had got upon his life for that
[42:38] power to be broken
[42:40] and then god as we looked in the
[42:42] scripture he says then i returned unto
[42:44] my reason
[42:45] it was a returning and see we see god's
[42:48] grace if god would do that
[42:50] for nebuchadnezzar a one who was not
[42:53] even a believer
[42:54] how much more will god in his mercy and
[42:57] grace
[42:58] deal with our life with a heart that
[43:00] desires to
[43:02] please him that desires to walk and
[43:05] and just to say lord i i'm not
[43:08] interested in that i have to do anything
[43:10] i
[43:10] just want to have fellowship with you i
[43:13] just want my life to be a place that you
[43:15] can say
[43:16] of all the places i want to go there
[43:19] because i feel welcome in that place i
[43:21] feel welcome in that life
[43:23] i'm invited and that's the desire that
[43:25] we would have
[43:26] and should have in our lives and so when
[43:29] we look at this of true greatness
[43:30] it's entirely contrary to that of how
[43:33] the world because the world that we know
[43:36] not the earth but the world that we know
[43:39] is a system that is not a system of god
[43:42] but the world is the system that came
[43:45] about because
[43:46] of the fall and we recognize we're
[43:49] heading
[43:49] back to a place to where the very
[43:52] world itself the the systems the
[43:56] governments and all those things which
[43:58] are all controlled
[43:59] by satan will all pass away
[44:03] there's there's going to be a cleansing
[44:05] of all of this
[44:06] there's going to be a cleansing there'll
[44:08] be a millennium there'll be a new heaven
[44:10] and a new earth
[44:11] this is all it's all leading into that
[44:14] place and as the earth
[44:15] as a redeemable attribute is coming into
[44:18] that place
[44:19] you and i as a redeemable attribute of
[44:22] god
[44:23] god has already come to our heart to
[44:25] bring a change
[44:27] into ruling the administration what was
[44:30] in our life
[44:31] and he rides in in such humility
[44:34] and authority and power that it
[44:37] dismantles the very hold
[44:39] of the enemy upon our life
[44:42] and there's a new ownership there's a
[44:44] new life there's a new man
[44:46] there's a there's a new creation in
[44:49] christ
[44:50] jesus look at this scripture in isaiah
[44:53] 57
[44:54] 15 for thus saith the high and lofty one
[44:59] that inhabiteth eternity whose name
[45:02] is holy i dwell
[45:06] in the high and holy place this is god
[45:08] speaking
[45:10] with him also that is of a contrite
[45:13] and humble spirit contract meaning dust
[45:17] and that of humble meaning that of
[45:19] lowliness or of
[45:21] human humiliation so what a contrast
[45:24] you and i the world let me just say the
[45:27] word
[45:28] and i don't mean to say that we are like
[45:30] the world but i'm saying that you and i
[45:32] we still after being redeemed are
[45:34] thinking about things
[45:36] god continues to work and change we
[45:38] would never
[45:39] have put these two together like this
[45:42] and thought of it
[45:43] a high and lofty one who is all holy
[45:46] who's all powerful but yet
[45:48] he dwells with those who are of a
[45:51] contrite
[45:52] uh and humble spirit that's a paradox
[45:55] it's not something we could ever put
[45:57] together but that's
[45:59] who god is because that's exactly who he
[46:03] is this is his greatness
[46:05] and paul paul would write to the church
[46:08] of the living god
[46:09] and he would express to them the working
[46:12] of this divine nature
[46:14] and he would speak in philippians 2 5
[46:16] and let them know the privilege that's
[46:18] given to them and says
[46:20] let this mind be in you he wasn't
[46:22] speaking of this matter here
[46:24] he's speaking of that nature that
[46:27] character of life
[46:28] let this mind be in you which was also
[46:31] in christ jesus
[46:32] who being in the form of god thought it
[46:35] not
[46:36] robbery to be equal with god i love this
[46:39] i love that he
[46:41] meaning he was not reaching after
[46:44] straining pushing pulling to become
[46:47] something this is who he was and he
[46:50] realized that
[46:51] and he yielded to obedience to the word
[46:55] he thought it not robbery he wasn't
[46:56] straining it wasn't pulling it shows you
[46:58] and i
[46:59] that this is god does not require nor
[47:02] does he call nor does he desire
[47:04] that we would strain pull or push he
[47:07] wants us to yield
[47:09] in obedience to the word
[47:13] verse 7 but made himself these words to
[47:16] me are just tremendous
[47:18] but made himself of no
[47:21] reputation and took upon him the form
[47:25] of a servant and was made in the
[47:28] likeness of men
[47:29] so it was not enough that he was made in
[47:32] the likeness of sinful flesh
[47:34] but he took upon him the form of a
[47:37] servant this is
[47:38] this is how that his life would be
[47:41] depicted or viewed it's a life of
[47:44] servanthood and being found in fashion
[47:48] as a man
[47:49] he humbled himself and became obedient
[47:54] unto death
[47:55] even the death of the cross
[47:58] how many know the way up is down
[48:03] wherefore he said god also hath
[48:07] highly exalted him why
[48:10] because of what we read in the previous
[48:13] two verses
[48:14] this humility to the word where he took
[48:18] on the form of a servant
[48:20] here he humbled himself and became
[48:23] obedient to the death
[48:25] you couldn't get any lower and because
[48:28] of this
[48:28] he's exalted to that of the throne
[48:32] as it says god also has highly exalted
[48:35] him
[48:35] and given him a name which is above
[48:37] every name
[48:38] that at the name of jesus every knee
[48:41] should bow
[48:42] of things in heaven things in earth and
[48:44] things under the earth
[48:46] and that every tongue should confess
[48:48] that jesus christ
[48:49] is lord to the glory of the father
[48:53] think of what the lord jesus said when
[48:55] he speaks to nicodemus he said
[48:57] no man have to send it up to heaven but
[49:00] he
[49:00] that came down from heaven even the son
[49:03] of man
[49:04] which is in heaven he's he's declaring
[49:07] at this time
[49:08] that what where the sons of god had
[49:11] fallen from
[49:12] their position in heavenly places here
[49:15] he is
[49:16] walking upon the earth and yet there he
[49:19] is
[49:19] also in heaven at the same time in
[49:21] heavenly
[49:22] places he's manifesting this position
[49:26] that belongs back into the very
[49:29] lives of sons and daughters of god and
[49:32] he's declaring it
[49:33] no man ascends you cannot even go
[49:36] into heavenly places unless you first
[49:39] descend
[49:40] you cannot go into heights unless you go
[49:43] into the depths
[49:44] you see this is not that of the world
[49:47] the world looks at
[49:48] if i'm going to get higher i'll step on
[49:50] who i need to step on
[49:51] in order to get there but that's not the
[49:54] way god works
[49:55] god works in a measure that in order to
[49:59] be
[49:59] exalted in order for heights it's to
[50:02] come to the greatest
[50:03] depths and when it comes to that of
[50:05] greatest steps
[50:06] the only thing that it comes to in our
[50:09] lives
[50:09] like it was in the lord jesus he came
[50:12] not to serve himself
[50:14] he came to minister on our behalf he
[50:17] wasn't thinking about himself
[50:19] when he did what he did he thought about
[50:22] you and me
[50:23] he thought about our needs he thought
[50:25] about what it is that you'd be going
[50:27] through tonight
[50:27] and he made a way and served the purpose
[50:30] that you and i might be able to draw on
[50:33] the benefits of the resurrection of the
[50:35] lord jesus christ
[50:37] what a life that there's no puffed up
[50:40] part about that
[50:42] hallelujah so you see this is why
[50:46] over and over brother branham would deal
[50:49] with this and i want to just keep moving
[50:51] of the way up
[50:52] is down i want you to think of this
[50:56] how that he would enter into a fallen
[50:59] creation
[51:01] when he would come let me just say it to
[51:04] you like this
[51:05] it would be like you and and forgive me
[51:08] if you've been in a situation that's
[51:09] been like this
[51:10] but it would be like you or me taking a
[51:14] house
[51:15] or a trailer or whatever it is and it's
[51:17] one that's been condemned
[51:19] it's one that's been boarded up it's got
[51:22] the yellow tapes on it
[51:23] and it says nobody shall occupy because
[51:26] there's things that don't
[51:28] meet the conditions or satisfactions of
[51:31] occupancy it's overrun with rats
[51:34] it's overcome with all sorts of things
[51:37] there's all sorts of filth
[51:39] but you would go to that house you would
[51:41] purchase that house
[51:42] you would come into there let me tell
[51:44] you something you would look at that
[51:46] what a massive filth and everything let
[51:48] me tell you something
[51:49] when god came down to become one of us
[51:53] he came to that of a life of a race that
[51:57] was
[51:57] under condemnation and he came
[52:01] he came under that of the law he came in
[52:04] order
[52:04] to bring a real change and
[52:07] transformation
[52:08] in our lives nothing puffed up about
[52:12] that at all
[52:14] as a matter of fact the scripture would
[52:15] say in hebrews 2 14
[52:18] that for as much as the children are
[52:20] partakers of flesh and blood
[52:22] he also himself likewise took part of
[52:25] the same
[52:26] that through death he might destroy him
[52:28] that had the power of death
[52:30] that is the devil and deliver them
[52:33] who through fear of death were all their
[52:36] lifetimes subject to bondage
[52:38] for verily he took not on him the nature
[52:41] of
[52:41] angels but he took on him the seed of
[52:44] abraham
[52:45] he was taking on not the nature of
[52:47] angels
[52:48] not the nature of god he took on the
[52:50] seed of
[52:51] abraham he adorned himself
[52:54] in a garment of humiliation
[53:00] oh my wherefore in all things
[53:04] it behooved him to be made like unto his
[53:07] brethren
[53:08] that he might be a merciful and faithful
[53:11] high priest
[53:11] in things pertaining to god to make
[53:13] reconciliation for the sins of the
[53:16] people
[53:16] for in that he himself hath suffered
[53:20] being tempted he is able to secure
[53:24] them that are tempted think of this
[53:28] many men of people can make things and
[53:31] and they get reputations for it
[53:33] they can make a little something a
[53:34] little gadget and they get a you know
[53:36] big name for it
[53:38] is that right but here's the lord of
[53:41] glory
[53:43] who created all things
[53:48] let me just say it to you and i don't
[53:49] know how else to word it
[53:51] if anybody could have had a big head he
[53:53] could have
[53:55] but he came down and made he actually
[53:58] think about this
[53:59] he made himself of no reputation
[54:04] he orchestrated it in such a way it was
[54:07] according to his word
[54:08] he would come but he would make himself
[54:11] of no
[54:12] reputation amen i thought brother graham
[54:15] says it like this these words to me have
[54:17] just
[54:18] just just ring out in my heart he says
[54:21] he
[54:21] brought himself down
[54:25] god jehovah in veiled in flesh come down
[54:28] to sacrifice himself
[54:29] for our sins and sickness the love of
[54:33] god could not be thought of listen to
[54:35] this
[54:35] how deep how pure how rich
[54:39] how high to know god
[54:42] would do such for his enemies not for
[54:45] his lovely ones who love him
[54:48] but for his enemies he could have been
[54:51] puffed up
[54:55] but he came with such humility
[54:58] now he didn't come with just humility
[55:00] for those who would love him
[55:02] he came even for his enemies
[55:06] this is this is more than man you
[55:09] understand this is more than man that's
[55:11] why brother brown would say it over and
[55:12] over
[55:12] he said this was god in flesh
[55:16] it was god anointed that flesh brother
[55:18] and sister
[55:19] it can be no other way in our life
[55:21] except god anoints our life
[55:23] there is no way possible for you and i
[55:26] to be able to manifest this
[55:28] and live this without the holy ghost in
[55:31] our life
[55:32] and a continual surrender on our life
[55:36] humbling ourselves to his leadership
[55:38] think of this
[55:39] hey brother adam when you know he would
[55:41] go on and speak it again he says to
[55:43] think of this true redemption
[55:45] how he came down worthy
[55:48] robed himself no home no place to go
[55:51] humiliated himself brought himself down
[55:54] in sinful flesh
[55:55] and took upon him not the nature of
[55:57] angels not the nature of god
[56:00] but he took on himself the nature of man
[56:02] that he might walk with man
[56:03] eat with man sleep with man and die for
[56:06] man
[56:08] he had to become little in order to
[56:11] redeem us
[56:13] i want you to think about this for a
[56:14] moment he had to become
[56:16] little in order to redeem us god had
[56:19] appeared
[56:20] many times throughout the old testament
[56:25] god had appeared god had come right in
[56:27] flesh
[56:30] but it was not that of
[56:33] redemption but you see when
[56:36] god when it came time for redemption god
[56:39] could not step out
[56:40] as a full-grown man like he came
[56:44] when he came to abraham are you with me
[56:46] now when he came to abraham
[56:48] that's speaking of the end time god does
[56:51] not reveal himself
[56:53] as an infant in the end time god reveals
[56:55] himself
[56:56] in the maturity of his word in his bride
[56:59] that's an end time sign but in order for
[57:02] that to be
[57:04] god had to become little
[57:08] he had to become a baby
[57:12] he had to come to a place as the
[57:14] scripture says
[57:16] isaiah 7 14.
[57:20] i want you to think of this a man in his
[57:23] right mind
[57:24] let me say it like this a man thinking
[57:27] about this if he would have
[57:28] god would have passed it by isaiah
[57:30] isaiah put this down in your notes
[57:32] isaiah would have no doubt put it down
[57:33] his notes may be under inspiration then
[57:35] come back and look and say
[57:36] there's no way in the world
[57:40] but you see god was not interested in
[57:42] what isaiah
[57:43] thought and isaiah only knew to yield
[57:47] and speak as god put it in his lips to
[57:50] speak
[57:51] god would bring that to pass be
[57:53] therefore the lord himself shall give
[57:54] you a sign
[57:55] a virgin shall conceive and bear a son
[57:58] and shall call his name emmanuel
[58:02] isaiah 9 6 for unto us a child is born
[58:05] unto us a son is given and then it goes
[58:08] on
[58:08] the government shall be on his shoulder
[58:10] now just for sake of time i'm not going
[58:12] to read the rest of it but
[58:13] right here in isaiah 9 6 there is the
[58:16] beginning here's where
[58:17] the littleness comes and throughout that
[58:20] period of time in his life
[58:22] to where it moves into a place after
[58:25] his resurrection then we experience this
[58:28] the government shall be upon his
[58:30] shoulder there is a lot of humility oh
[58:32] if i can say it this way
[58:34] there was a lot of humility that had to
[58:36] take place
[58:37] after that colon where it says given a
[58:40] lot of humility
[58:41] a lot of life that had to be lived and
[58:44] yet you don't see it right there
[58:46] are you with me there's a lot of things
[58:48] in our life where there's a humbling and
[58:50] a humility
[58:51] and god dealing with our life and things
[58:53] want to come and try to
[58:54] inflate and puff up but within the midst
[58:57] of it when it's all said and done
[58:59] it goes right to the next junction when
[59:01] we stand there
[59:03] that day when our bodies have been
[59:05] changed brother
[59:06] you talking about glorious to be able to
[59:09] stand there and say
[59:10] god you've given me grace you're present
[59:13] for the bill for the brian
[59:15] we made it by the grace of god god gave
[59:18] us strength to make it
[59:20] god gave us grace to humble ourselves
[59:25] now it continues on what greatness
[59:29] what greatness iran takes us into this
[59:33] when he refers to this
[59:35] israel and he talks about the nations
[59:39] talks about russia talks about the other
[59:41] nations he said they're each
[59:43] one i want you to listen to statement
[59:45] they're each one
[59:46] wanting a messiah
[59:50] each one are wanting that but brother
[59:52] braham says what it is
[59:54] they want a messiah that they can
[59:56] control
[59:59] you see you can't have a messiah that
[1:00:01] you can control
[1:00:04] he's either going to be the messiah or
[1:00:06] he's not the messiah
[1:00:08] and they believed israel they believed
[1:00:12] there's
[1:00:12] many scriptures we could go to but they
[1:00:14] believed
[1:00:15] they needed a general they believed
[1:00:18] we need to get out of this roman rule we
[1:00:21] need to get them out of here
[1:00:23] we need to drive them out we we need to
[1:00:25] do all of this
[1:00:26] they didn't need a general they needed
[1:00:30] a baby they didn't need a general
[1:00:35] they needed a baby the
[1:00:38] religious spirits of that day wanted to
[1:00:41] try to control the lord jesus
[1:00:44] when they couldn't control him and then
[1:00:46] after pentecost
[1:00:47] when they couldn't control them then
[1:00:48] that's when they wanted to shut them up
[1:00:51] are you with me but they they claimed
[1:00:54] they were looking for him or
[1:00:56] looking for him but what god gave them
[1:00:58] is what they needed
[1:01:00] they needed brother brahma says it like
[1:01:02] this they needed
[1:01:03] humiliation they needed to be
[1:01:07] humiliated he would look at it god we
[1:01:10] need a general
[1:01:11] you gave us a baby but they needed a
[1:01:14] deliverance
[1:01:15] more than just the people who was over
[1:01:18] them and oh the romans are oppressing us
[1:01:20] they needed a deliverance on the inside
[1:01:24] they needed a change of nature they
[1:01:27] themselves
[1:01:28] were in need of a baby why because
[1:01:31] through that baby
[1:01:33] that virgin birth then could be a life
[1:01:36] that would be
[1:01:36] rendered unto god that his own life
[1:01:39] could come back
[1:01:40] and lead us to a place
[1:01:43] of becoming a baby born
[1:01:47] again in christ
[1:01:50] what greatness what humility
[1:01:53] one thing you find that god himself is
[1:01:56] not worried
[1:01:57] about being misunderstood god does not
[1:02:01] do
[1:02:01] like you and i sometimes and think well
[1:02:04] i hope they got it
[1:02:05] i hope they got it i hope he got to hope
[1:02:07] this hope oh my
[1:02:08] trust that god doesn't work that way
[1:02:11] god is at rest god is
[1:02:14] confident in his word he's
[1:02:17] confident in his word in our lives
[1:02:21] he's not worried he don't bite his nails
[1:02:23] he doesn't do none of those things he
[1:02:25] doesn't pace the floors
[1:02:27] but god his word will always come to
[1:02:30] pass
[1:02:30] in its season god will always bring in
[1:02:33] work and condition
[1:02:35] in our lives so that when it's time for
[1:02:37] that word to come to pass
[1:02:38] our lives and our hearts are ready in
[1:02:41] that time and in that place
[1:02:43] oh my god think of this
[1:02:47] this humility look what jesus said let
[1:02:50] me break in on this for a moment
[1:02:52] jesus when he was here and he remember
[1:02:54] he's speaking to
[1:02:55] the disciples in matthew 18
[1:02:58] 1 the disciples are asking him who's the
[1:03:02] greatest
[1:03:03] in the kingdom of heaven now remember
[1:03:05] all they've known
[1:03:07] is this kingdom of this world though
[1:03:10] they've been jews
[1:03:11] all they've known is this kingdom but
[1:03:14] now here comes the
[1:03:15] entrance of another kingdom this kingdom
[1:03:20] is that of the person of jesus christ
[1:03:23] god dwelling there in the very form
[1:03:26] of humanity and so that all they can
[1:03:30] think of is is all they've ever known
[1:03:32] and so they're thinking who would be the
[1:03:34] greatest in the kingdom of heaven and
[1:03:36] jesus called a little child look look
[1:03:38] how he does this
[1:03:39] he turned from the direction you're
[1:03:41] going and now look and
[1:03:44] become as a little child you realize
[1:03:46] that it takes the grace of god
[1:03:48] to lead us into repentance paul would
[1:03:50] say it's the goodness of god
[1:03:52] that leads us to repentance and at that
[1:03:55] point
[1:03:55] everything itself you realize even
[1:03:57] repentance nobody can do it for you
[1:03:58] pastor prophet nobody can do it it has
[1:04:01] to be god dealing with your heart
[1:04:03] and you have to make a decision based on
[1:04:06] how that he's revealing himself to you
[1:04:08] and then a further decision comes on
[1:04:11] whether or not you are
[1:04:12] willing to actually become as
[1:04:16] a little child think of that here we are
[1:04:19] my we know so much and we know
[1:04:21] everything and god says
[1:04:22] i want you to become dumb
[1:04:26] oh that's oh my goodness i i don't know
[1:04:28] about that but what is it about a little
[1:04:30] child a little childing dumb
[1:04:32] children ain't dumb i'll tell you what
[1:04:35] sometimes children got more discernment
[1:04:36] than adults got
[1:04:39] are you with me i mean a child but what
[1:04:42] is it about a child
[1:04:43] a child just simply believes
[1:04:47] a child don't try to figure it out a
[1:04:49] child don't try to explain it
[1:04:50] a child when mom or daddy says you know
[1:04:53] what i want you to stop this
[1:04:54] okay you know eventually yeah it gets to
[1:04:57] a place of why
[1:04:58] but all daddy or mama has to say
[1:04:59] sometimes this if you go this direction
[1:05:02] this will happen to you you're one you
[1:05:03] know this will leave you and this and
[1:05:04] that okay lord
[1:05:06] i i'm not gonna go that way you see
[1:05:08] become as a little child in other words
[1:05:11] we are one who needs to be led by our
[1:05:14] heavenly father so to become as a little
[1:05:18] child one who simply
[1:05:19] just trusts that what the father is
[1:05:22] saying yes
[1:05:23] that's my father he said it i believe it
[1:05:25] i act according to it
[1:05:27] because he said it
[1:05:30] whosoever therefore shall humble himself
[1:05:33] look at that
[1:05:33] humble himself now this is not something
[1:05:36] that the pastor can do for you
[1:05:38] it's not something that any matter of
[1:05:39] fact you find this same thing take place
[1:05:42] over and over and it has to be in our
[1:05:44] lives because god himself
[1:05:46] will not humble he will not humble us
[1:05:50] just all the time but god will have
[1:05:52] things that will take place in our life
[1:05:54] that we can recognize and we humble
[1:05:57] ourselves
[1:05:58] in recognizing lord i got a little bit
[1:06:01] too big
[1:06:02] lord i got a little bit too big in my
[1:06:04] thinking lord i
[1:06:05] i got a little bit too big and my
[1:06:06] feelings are what i was saying
[1:06:08] and god by his grace remember he won't
[1:06:10] do it for us sometimes he has to let
[1:06:12] trials test circumstances come our way
[1:06:15] to help us to see
[1:06:16] where we think ma i'm acting like a
[1:06:18] little child and that's saying you know
[1:06:20] and here
[1:06:20] god says no you're acting like a spoiled
[1:06:22] brat you're acting like a teenager that
[1:06:24] knows
[1:06:24] everything nope i can't have that i need
[1:06:26] you to act not like a teenager
[1:06:28] don't become like a teenager those are
[1:06:30] your teenagers tonight i apologize to
[1:06:32] you
[1:06:32] but you understand this god does not
[1:06:34] want us to be
[1:06:35] teenagers he wants us to be
[1:06:39] children children oh my
[1:06:43] so whosoever shall humble himself as
[1:06:45] this little child
[1:06:46] the same is the greatest in the kingdom
[1:06:48] of heaven now
[1:06:49] brother brown would talk about this here
[1:06:51] and let me just let me dwell with this
[1:06:52] just a moment
[1:06:53] he talks about when a life and how that
[1:06:56] god
[1:06:56] you know god will come into a heart in a
[1:06:58] heart you know we'll we'll
[1:07:00] we'll accept the lord jesus christ and
[1:07:03] and really
[1:07:03] it's not you accepting him it's you
[1:07:05] recognizing he's already accepted you
[1:07:09] and you repent of your sins and you
[1:07:11] follow on in the word to be
[1:07:13] baptized in the name of jesus christ and
[1:07:15] and to receive the gift of the holy
[1:07:17] ghost but
[1:07:18] you see when god comes into a life a
[1:07:20] person can you know open their heart
[1:07:22] and god is as it is that god himself
[1:07:25] will come
[1:07:26] in into that life and here you know he
[1:07:28] was on the outside and they let him come
[1:07:30] in now
[1:07:31] in the door and here he is he's he's
[1:07:32] standing on this mat and it says
[1:07:35] welcome but he's standing there
[1:07:38] and brother brown says the first door
[1:07:40] that's on the right
[1:07:41] is the door of pride i find it striking
[1:07:45] when brother branham would deal with
[1:07:46] this because you know
[1:07:47] the right hand or right side it deals
[1:07:50] with power
[1:07:51] and authority and to find that the very
[1:07:53] thing that is upon
[1:07:55] the very first door that the lord jesus
[1:07:57] wants to deal with after stepping
[1:07:59] in in our life as our lord and savior
[1:08:02] he wants to step in he's coming a savior
[1:08:05] he wants to be lord but the very first
[1:08:06] door
[1:08:07] that he needs to deal with is that door
[1:08:09] of pride but remember
[1:08:11] the lord jesus does not walk around with
[1:08:12] battering rams and saying
[1:08:14] hey hey gabriel you get on that side and
[1:08:16] i'm on this side and we're just going to
[1:08:17] we're going to bust this door down
[1:08:18] no he doesn't do that he's a gentleman
[1:08:21] he'll stay right there on that mat
[1:08:23] as long as you make him stay there if
[1:08:26] that's all you give him in your life
[1:08:27] he'll stay right there the whole time
[1:08:29] he's a
[1:08:30] gentleman but if you'll let him deal
[1:08:32] with that door of pride now
[1:08:34] that door of pride itself it will go to
[1:08:36] thinking well if i give in to
[1:08:38] this what are they going to think about
[1:08:39] me at work what are they going to think
[1:08:41] about me you know
[1:08:42] down here with my friends and brother
[1:08:43] brown goes into it what if i you know i
[1:08:45] stopped wearing the makeup but i stopped
[1:08:46] cutting my hair and i stopped wearing
[1:08:48] the pants and i
[1:08:48] stopped running around stop looking at
[1:08:50] this stuff and stop making
[1:08:52] they know the the dirt cutting in on the
[1:08:53] dirty jokes with the boys and everything
[1:08:55] else
[1:08:55] what are they going to think when i
[1:08:57] stand there and say hey
[1:08:58] i don't want to be a part of that no
[1:09:00] more and you see when that begins to
[1:09:02] come out because what's the matter
[1:09:03] you realize there's a stand that must
[1:09:06] have to be taken
[1:09:07] in order for him to move off of that
[1:09:10] place
[1:09:11] in your life you're the one who's got
[1:09:12] the control jesus
[1:09:14] is not himself walking around kicking
[1:09:16] down doors he himself
[1:09:17] is waiting on you and i to open the
[1:09:20] doors
[1:09:21] that he will come in but you see when he
[1:09:23] comes into that door of pride
[1:09:25] one thing that's wonderful about it he
[1:09:27] comes in and humiliates us
[1:09:31] are you with me he'll cause you to
[1:09:33] testify
[1:09:34] and say things that you know what i know
[1:09:36] i used to be that way
[1:09:38] but god has done something for me i want
[1:09:40] to serve him
[1:09:41] i want to live for him and you know what
[1:09:44] you might bear that humiliation you
[1:09:46] might feel
[1:09:47] that maybe a little bit of redness as it
[1:09:49] trickles over you
[1:09:50] and it might seem like that humiliation
[1:09:52] but there's something
[1:09:53] on the inside you're so happy that you
[1:09:56] can say i
[1:09:57] identify with him why because you've
[1:10:00] allowed him
[1:10:01] to have that door of pride
[1:10:05] and he comes in and he humiliates you
[1:10:10] these are the prophets words here i'm
[1:10:12] just not reading them word for word but
[1:10:14] that's exactly what he comes in to do
[1:10:16] to where now you've all of that is gone
[1:10:19] from your life you don't care
[1:10:21] right i don't care what so-and-so might
[1:10:23] feel are thinking and you're being
[1:10:24] arrogant
[1:10:25] you realize i care more about what he
[1:10:27] thinks
[1:10:29] that's what i care more about i want to
[1:10:32] entertain my jesus i
[1:10:33] i'm not interested in entertaining these
[1:10:35] things you know what that does that
[1:10:36] causes him to move
[1:10:37] off of that doormat right into your life
[1:10:41] and you know that's the same way it
[1:10:43] keeps on in our life
[1:10:45] he will only deal with our lives as
[1:10:48] we'll lay
[1:10:49] he'll speak to our heart and service and
[1:10:52] it's up to us to say
[1:10:54] yes lord amen yes lord
[1:10:57] i surrender yes lord lord take that out
[1:10:59] of me lord
[1:11:00] let it be lined up with your word he
[1:11:02] won't just come and do it
[1:11:04] it's got to be a welcoming amen and do
[1:11:06] you think of this
[1:11:07] when brother branham would tell us in
[1:11:08] the church age book that when the
[1:11:10] preaching of the word goes forth the
[1:11:11] sword
[1:11:12] goes forth brother bran would say in the
[1:11:13] message shalom he said oh god
[1:11:15] let the sword of the word come through
[1:11:17] sweep through our lives with such
[1:11:19] sweetness
[1:11:20] what does it do it cuts away holds in
[1:11:23] our life
[1:11:24] you may not you might be sitting there
[1:11:25] hearing the word and your hands may not
[1:11:27] even go up
[1:11:28] you but you are here you are so inclined
[1:11:30] to the word and your heart
[1:11:32] is saying amen your heart is saying yes
[1:11:35] lord and what's happening the sword of
[1:11:37] the word is cutting things right away
[1:11:40] from your life and giving you strength
[1:11:45] think of this he humbled himself
[1:11:49] to that place brother brahms he says it
[1:11:52] just like this he says
[1:11:54] to think of this you know in our lives
[1:11:57] he says if we can humble
[1:11:59] he says you've got to humble yourself
[1:12:02] until you
[1:12:02] see that until
[1:12:05] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:12:09] you
[1:12:10] then ask what you will it's humbling
[1:12:13] of self to abide in him like
[1:12:16] the church you don't abide in the church
[1:12:19] we come here on thursday
[1:12:20] we leave come here on sunday we leave
[1:12:24] but you see this abiding in him is where
[1:12:27] we are
[1:12:28] baptized into him by one spirit
[1:12:33] it's where just as we had a baptism here
[1:12:35] on sunday
[1:12:36] and you seen as we baptized brother
[1:12:39] louie right there in the
[1:12:40] in the in the in the pool he didn't
[1:12:43] baptize himself did he
[1:12:45] i mean he didn't you know get up here
[1:12:47] and just lay himself back
[1:12:48] no but we had to direct him and say now
[1:12:51] look
[1:12:52] you take your arm you hold it right here
[1:12:54] and you put it over your nose
[1:12:57] we will lay you back and we will bring
[1:12:59] you up
[1:13:01] that in itself is what god does
[1:13:05] not man by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:13:09] it's god taking a life to where life
[1:13:10] says okay lord
[1:13:13] yes lord i want more than anything lord
[1:13:15] to be so submerged in you
[1:13:17] and you come to that place just
[1:13:19] listening in obedience
[1:13:21] to his word and he himself comes
[1:13:25] and baptizes you into
[1:13:28] himself oh my in that wonderful
[1:13:32] of submission now to think
[1:13:36] when we think of this you know a lot of
[1:13:38] times as i'm reading across this
[1:13:39] this quote and reading across some of
[1:13:41] these things here today even
[1:13:43] brother branham he speaks of it many
[1:13:45] times we we talk about
[1:13:47] where he was born and we say oh
[1:13:50] you know let it i think the song says
[1:13:53] let your word be born in the manger
[1:13:55] of my heart brother brahman says it like
[1:13:57] this and why little bethlehem he says
[1:14:00] he came to a stable that was so polluted
[1:14:06] this is the king of glory he wasn't born
[1:14:10] in a nice home wasn't born in a nice
[1:14:13] hospital
[1:14:14] he didn't have all these requirements
[1:14:16] well i gotta have this kind of crib i
[1:14:18] gotta have this kind of rocker gotta
[1:14:19] have this kind of this
[1:14:20] i gotta have this kind of this i gotta
[1:14:22] have that it wasn't he didn't lay out
[1:14:24] all these requirements
[1:14:25] the word had already given
[1:14:28] the requirements so god
[1:14:32] humbled himself and came according to
[1:14:35] his word
[1:14:36] in a stable over manure pile
[1:14:40] over stench it was not a beautiful place
[1:14:42] where he was born
[1:14:44] and brother branham brings it on down
[1:14:46] and he deals with it like this he says
[1:14:48] when you can realize about yourself
[1:14:51] that you're nothing but a stinking
[1:14:54] stable
[1:14:59] our life well well i mean
[1:15:02] naturally god would want to come and
[1:15:04] associate with me
[1:15:05] really remember that condemned house i
[1:15:07] talked about
[1:15:09] infested with rats well i never had that
[1:15:11] and i never had this and i never had
[1:15:13] that
[1:15:13] but our lie we were still under
[1:15:15] condemnation
[1:15:16] we still were of that first birth
[1:15:20] man who's born of a woman is a few days
[1:15:22] old and full of trouble
[1:15:25] but he himself would come condense in
[1:15:28] and identify himself
[1:15:31] with us oh my this is why brother brown
[1:15:35] can say if you just
[1:15:36] open your heart it's very simple and
[1:15:39] take the word in he said watch the
[1:15:42] change that comes
[1:15:43] in your life when he comes
[1:15:47] look at this scripture for you know
[1:15:50] second corinthians 8 9
[1:15:51] for you know the grace of our lord jesus
[1:15:54] christ
[1:15:54] that though he was rich yet for your
[1:15:58] sakes
[1:15:59] he became poor
[1:16:03] that through his poverty might be rich
[1:16:06] this was ongoing in his life
[1:16:10] it was not speaking that he was rich
[1:16:12] naturally because he wasn't
[1:16:14] he didn't even have a place to lay his
[1:16:16] head the lord jesus didn't even have a
[1:16:19] home to go to
[1:16:20] that he could say hey i want to invite
[1:16:22] you over to my house he had no house
[1:16:24] to call his own
[1:16:30] but he became poor rich in what rich
[1:16:34] in that it was the fullness of the
[1:16:36] godhead
[1:16:37] bodily god the god
[1:16:41] of glory that had stepped down
[1:16:44] into a body of time are created
[1:16:47] body that he had made in order to
[1:16:50] reflect his word through
[1:16:52] he became poor what a what a contrast
[1:16:56] to that of the world to that of the
[1:16:58] earth it looks at
[1:17:00] become poor but you see this is god's
[1:17:03] character
[1:17:04] this is what real charity is it's
[1:17:07] that of where it becomes poor
[1:17:11] that through his poverty we might be
[1:17:14] made rich
[1:17:15] once you think of this not only did he
[1:17:17] not have a place to lay his head and
[1:17:19] home and things but you know he didn't
[1:17:21] have to be sick
[1:17:24] he didn't have to know what a headache
[1:17:25] was he didn't have to know what it was
[1:17:28] to be
[1:17:29] frustrated as the prophet put it in
[1:17:31] perfect faith
[1:17:32] he didn't have to know that
[1:17:36] but he did it he did it are you with me
[1:17:40] i hope you understand what i'm saying he
[1:17:42] didn't have to know that you say why
[1:17:44] why didn't he have to know that because
[1:17:45] remember there had to be a price
[1:17:48] paid in order for the redemption of our
[1:17:51] soul
[1:17:51] that that life might come back but in
[1:17:54] order
[1:17:54] that he might be a faithful and merciful
[1:17:57] high priest
[1:17:58] that he might be the right kind of a
[1:18:00] mediator that he might understand
[1:18:02] when you and i would go to him and say
[1:18:04] father i'm tempted awful bad here
[1:18:06] father i feel a pull here or i'm sorry
[1:18:09] about this or
[1:18:10] or i'm sensing this he's able to stand
[1:18:13] there
[1:18:14] he felt he felt what it was
[1:18:17] to be tempted are you with me he knows
[1:18:20] what it was brother to have to turn your
[1:18:22] head
[1:18:24] he was tempted by sex tempted by
[1:18:26] drinking
[1:18:27] tempted in all these matter let me bring
[1:18:29] it on down he was
[1:18:30] tempted to rebuke them at times where
[1:18:33] the father said
[1:18:34] don't say nothing he was tempted to go
[1:18:38] there and say
[1:18:38] i'm gonna debate you but the father said
[1:18:41] turn around and walk out of the temple
[1:18:43] are you with me we're talking about a
[1:18:45] life
[1:18:46] that was so governed by god let me tell
[1:18:49] you something
[1:18:50] that's not a pie in the sky the virgin
[1:18:53] birth
[1:18:54] came that you and i might be born of
[1:18:56] that same spirit
[1:18:57] and god by his spirit in dwelling in our
[1:19:00] lives
[1:19:01] would be able to so mold and shake and
[1:19:04] conform
[1:19:04] us to that glorious image
[1:19:10] the character that's raptured out of
[1:19:12] here will be the same character that was
[1:19:14] in the bridegroom
[1:19:20] listen these words here i i can't these
[1:19:23] words
[1:19:23] they just grip my heart brother brahm
[1:19:26] says
[1:19:27] concerning him he said he humiliated
[1:19:30] himself
[1:19:31] he stripped himself of all heavenly
[1:19:34] glories and came down
[1:19:38] don't just leave this here this is what
[1:19:41] this same
[1:19:42] life does in you and i it doesn't cause
[1:19:45] us to vomit or
[1:19:46] puff ourselves it there's sometimes
[1:19:49] where we have to
[1:19:50] strip away strip away and humble to the
[1:19:54] word strip away
[1:19:55] our feelings or where this is my point
[1:19:58] in this and we've got to strip away
[1:20:01] are you hearing me it's because it's
[1:20:03] easy to get puffed up
[1:20:04] when you're right and you know you're
[1:20:06] right and the other person's wrong
[1:20:07] that's easy
[1:20:09] but that still is not a right to be
[1:20:10] puffed up
[1:20:12] because let me tell you something there
[1:20:13] was nobody more right
[1:20:16] and perfect than the lord jesus
[1:20:21] but he laid aside his splendor brother
[1:20:25] brahm says god's stripping himself
[1:20:27] coming out of the ivory palaces
[1:20:30] taking upon himself the form of sinful
[1:20:32] flesh to humiliate
[1:20:34] himself you catch these words to
[1:20:36] humiliate
[1:20:38] himself to come down to be kin folks to
[1:20:41] the poorest beggar there is in the world
[1:20:42] tonight
[1:20:44] how many walked by blind bartimaeus
[1:20:48] how many walked by him but jesus came
[1:20:52] down
[1:20:54] and the call of blind bartimaeus stopped
[1:20:58] the sun that day the sun stood still
[1:21:03] and he turned and he heard the cry
[1:21:06] not from these ears he heard the cry
[1:21:09] of blind bartimaeus through that of the
[1:21:12] spirit
[1:21:13] it was crying out for healing
[1:21:17] you know how that cry came blind
[1:21:19] bartimaeus was sitting there
[1:21:21] he had gave away his turtle doves
[1:21:26] he gave away the lamb that was his eyes
[1:21:30] when he went to offer that lamb because
[1:21:32] he was blind
[1:21:34] like you would have a dog that would be
[1:21:35] a guide dog that got him around
[1:21:38] and the priest brother random drama
[1:21:39] class the priest stopped him bartimaeus
[1:21:41] you can't give that away
[1:21:43] that's your eyes that's what you need in
[1:21:45] order to get around
[1:21:47] here's another lamb or we could preach
[1:21:50] on this
[1:21:52] but here's what blind bartimaeus said i
[1:21:54] didn't promise god any
[1:21:56] lamb i promised him this lamb
[1:22:01] god don't want anything else but our
[1:22:03] life
[1:22:05] he wants everything about our life
[1:22:07] listen you might say
[1:22:08] well i pray and i read thank god for
[1:22:10] that but god don't want your fruits
[1:22:12] he wants your life
[1:22:16] sometimes i've had people tell me well
[1:22:17] i'm praying and i'm reading and i'm this
[1:22:20] but god don't want your works god wants
[1:22:22] your heart
[1:22:24] he wants your heart and anything
[1:22:27] even if it's religious that stands
[1:22:30] against surrender
[1:22:31] is an enticing spirit amen
[1:22:34] are you with me sometimes people take
[1:22:38] fasting
[1:22:39] they'll take speaking in tongues they'll
[1:22:41] take everything else
[1:22:43] except surrendering their life
[1:22:46] but a surrendered life invites the
[1:22:48] presence of god
[1:22:51] like david when he offered there on the
[1:22:52] threshing floor they wanted to give him
[1:22:54] an offer he said no
[1:22:56] i won't offer something to god that cost
[1:22:58] me nothing amen
[1:23:06] he came down
[1:23:10] can i have just a few more moments here
[1:23:12] and we'll come to a close there's just
[1:23:13] no way to get it
[1:23:16] and isaiah 53 when it speaks
[1:23:19] believed our report to whom is the arm
[1:23:23] of the lord the strength
[1:23:25] of god revealed goes on to speak
[1:23:30] he'll grow up before him
[1:23:33] as a tender plant as a root out of dry
[1:23:36] ground
[1:23:37] you realize jehovah is a baby
[1:23:41] jehovah is a toddler jehovah as a
[1:23:44] teenager
[1:23:46] are you with me jehovah all the way
[1:23:48] through
[1:23:51] and no form no communist we should when
[1:23:53] we shall see him there's no beauty we
[1:23:54] should desire him
[1:23:56] but brahman said it like this he said he
[1:23:58] was probably a little
[1:24:00] skinny spindly looking fellow
[1:24:03] didn't look like a king
[1:24:10] to look at him and say
[1:24:13] [Music]
[1:24:14] so this is where redemption is going to
[1:24:16] come through
[1:24:18] this is what you're sending us but you
[1:24:21] see god doesn't measure
[1:24:22] character by the stature of a person
[1:24:27] amen that's what satan does
[1:24:30] let me tell you something that's false
[1:24:34] are you with me in the book of
[1:24:36] revelations when john was getting that
[1:24:38] that private tour there when the angel
[1:24:41] pulled back
[1:24:42] and showed him when john was wandering
[1:24:44] on the woman and just with an amazement
[1:24:47] wow she's so religious
[1:24:51] and here the anointing
[1:24:55] the word he comes in and uncovers and
[1:24:57] shows
[1:24:59] what that great religious church is
[1:25:01] filled with
[1:25:03] hatred the blood of the martyrs of the
[1:25:06] saints
[1:25:07] and as soon as her character was
[1:25:09] revealed
[1:25:11] john said her beauty
[1:25:14] is not real beauty because real beauty
[1:25:17] is real character amen that kind of
[1:25:20] beauty
[1:25:21] is the kind of beauty that satan brings
[1:25:23] about
[1:25:24] but the beauty that god brings about is
[1:25:26] a character
[1:25:27] in humility to his word
[1:25:32] so he would have bypassed those in that
[1:25:34] day my here's
[1:25:35] here's the one that's going to here's
[1:25:37] the one that's going to bring
[1:25:37] deliverance but it was the character
[1:25:39] of god's own life that was dwelling
[1:25:43] behind
[1:25:44] this life let me just bring this down
[1:25:48] here
[1:25:49] let me think i want you to think of this
[1:25:51] just for a moment
[1:25:53] i wish i could go on but i i know i just
[1:25:56] can't
[1:26:00] here you want to think of humility
[1:26:03] brother brown would deal with humility
[1:26:04] in such a way
[1:26:05] in the message victory day
[1:26:09] and he talks about how we think about
[1:26:11] greatness
[1:26:12] and he says you know how we can get
[1:26:14] greater and greater and greater and
[1:26:15] greater he says
[1:26:17] you know god will just pull back then
[1:26:22] a paragraph on down he deals with what
[1:26:25] real greatness is
[1:26:26] and he says you know you can get to a
[1:26:28] place where you get greater and greater
[1:26:31] he's talking spiritually now
[1:26:32] he says greater and greater and greater
[1:26:35] until he says you're
[1:26:36] so humble that people just look right
[1:26:38] over the top of you
[1:26:42] you see when jesus was here it was that
[1:26:45] of a humility
[1:26:47] it wasn't just because it's like as
[1:26:49] brother brand said he was a spindly
[1:26:51] looking fellow he never went anywhere
[1:26:54] to try to get a following he never tried
[1:26:58] to corral people
[1:26:59] he just simply when they would speak to
[1:27:01] him whether it was philip
[1:27:02] andrew amen what did he say to him
[1:27:05] follow me
[1:27:07] leave leave that follow me but they were
[1:27:10] following not not that of a man
[1:27:13] it was not even the man part that
[1:27:16] actually got them but the man
[1:27:18] part was that vessel that tent that the
[1:27:21] lord pitched
[1:27:22] that god's own character could actually
[1:27:26] be manifested through that would
[1:27:29] actually draw them
[1:27:30] in leadership and here it was to such a
[1:27:35] place
[1:27:35] where brother brown could make a
[1:27:36] statement like this to where he says
[1:27:38] 99 and 9 10
[1:27:42] of the people didn't even know he was on
[1:27:45] earth
[1:27:48] it wasn't because he was in hiding
[1:27:51] he wasn't quarantined hello there was a
[1:27:55] plague
[1:27:55] on but he came to deal with the plague
[1:27:58] are you with me he wasn't in hiding he
[1:28:00] was in the temple with him
[1:28:02] as a matter of fact when they went they
[1:28:04] came into the garden to take him he said
[1:28:06] i've been there in the temple and you
[1:28:08] didn't take me
[1:28:12] he walked right among them the god of
[1:28:14] glory
[1:28:17] jesus wasn't the aaron boy he was
[1:28:20] god come down to redeem you and i
[1:28:25] [Applause]
[1:28:26] and they looked right over the top of it
[1:28:28] it didn't come according to how
[1:28:30] they think it ought to come but here
[1:28:33] let me tell you how how much it was
[1:28:35] looked over the humility
[1:28:37] is those who ate with him fished with
[1:28:40] him
[1:28:40] slept where he slept and everything else
[1:28:43] when the fulfillment of the word
[1:28:45] came and he's fulfilling word prophecy
[1:28:48] is being fulfilled events that are
[1:28:51] taking place
[1:28:52] are being made clear by prophecy but yet
[1:28:54] their eyes are withholding to know
[1:28:56] what's taking place
[1:28:58] more prophecy is being fulfilled in
[1:29:00] those last moments on the cross
[1:29:02] and then as he descends there
[1:29:05] into the lowest parts of hell
[1:29:10] he steps out in luke 24.
[1:29:13] he begins to talk to him
[1:29:17] they said are you a stranger
[1:29:23] are you a stranger but their eyes were
[1:29:27] withholding
[1:29:29] withholding you say why would their eyes
[1:29:31] be withholden
[1:29:33] because they needed their spiritual eyes
[1:29:36] opened they needed to see him
[1:29:40] that he is the fulfillment of the
[1:29:43] messiah
[1:29:45] he is the fulfillment of the world why
[1:29:47] because that
[1:29:48] was important that they know now it's
[1:29:51] time for the fulfillment of the word
[1:29:54] in their life the outpouring of the holy
[1:29:57] ghost
[1:30:01] it was such humility that they looked
[1:30:04] over it
[1:30:05] yeah they couldn't see it couldn't see
[1:30:08] what was going on what was taking place
[1:30:11] but when he began to open the word to
[1:30:14] their hearts
[1:30:16] and they got in that day they said did
[1:30:18] not our hearts burn within us
[1:30:21] as he talked with us
[1:30:24] along the way when he came into that
[1:30:27] place
[1:30:28] he took the bread and he broke it
[1:30:32] and they recognized
[1:30:35] this is our master
[1:30:39] this is the lord jesus they recognized
[1:30:43] him in the fulfillment
[1:30:45] of his word such such
[1:30:49] humiliation do you realize on calvary
[1:30:53] our bookstores paintings and everything
[1:30:55] else
[1:30:57] they'll cover it up on the crucifixion
[1:30:58] but he was stripped
[1:31:00] there
[1:31:03] the scripture says who for the joy
[1:31:07] that was set before him hebrews 12 2
[1:31:10] for the joy that was set before him he
[1:31:12] despised
[1:31:14] the shame the cross
[1:31:18] he didn't want to go it was not the
[1:31:20] cross that he wanted to go to
[1:31:22] but he went there he endured
[1:31:25] humiliation for you and me
[1:31:31] he took and paid the price for you and
[1:31:34] me
[1:31:36] but then because of that then he could
[1:31:39] come
[1:31:40] and take a hold of our lives amen boy
[1:31:43] you think one but you would think coming
[1:31:45] into a garment of likeness of sinful
[1:31:47] flesh
[1:31:47] that which he created and he would step
[1:31:50] into it and that would be a garment of
[1:31:51] humiliation
[1:31:52] about our lives where god found us and
[1:31:55] where god brought us from but god said
[1:31:59] i can come i can do a work on that house
[1:32:01] i can flip that house i can i can do
[1:32:03] that i can change this and change that
[1:32:05] i i'll remove it from a condemned status
[1:32:09] and you know what i ain't gonna sell it
[1:32:11] i'm going to live in it myself
[1:32:13] [Laughter]
[1:32:14] i'm going to put my furniture in i'm
[1:32:17] going to decorate it the way i want to
[1:32:19] decorate it
[1:32:22] lord you would take a condemned house i
[1:32:24] bought it off the market you can never
[1:32:26] return to the market
[1:32:27] you've been redeemed
[1:32:32] nothing puffed up about that at all
[1:32:36] but humiliation humiliation where he
[1:32:40] would step down
[1:32:42] become one of us amen and then
[1:32:46] come and bring us to himself oh my god
[1:32:50] may god help us as we look at this
[1:32:54] character this life this nature
[1:32:58] that we've been born of this same spirit
[1:33:01] that that same nature would live in us
[1:33:04] if you have and i encourage you be born
[1:33:07] be born again
[1:33:08] let the spirit of god how that the lord
[1:33:11] spoke it here so clearly tonight
[1:33:13] just take the word into your life that
[1:33:16] don't mean just with the casual but but
[1:33:18] really let it come into your life let
[1:33:21] the word come
[1:33:22] in sell out to that and say god
[1:33:25] let this word be born in my life
[1:33:28] you let the word come in and it'll
[1:33:30] produce a word life
[1:33:32] it'll produce a transformation it'll
[1:33:34] produce a change
[1:33:36] but remember he won't do it unless we
[1:33:39] let him off of that carpet right there
[1:33:42] i could sit right here and say jesus
[1:33:44] move over there and so-and-so's life
[1:33:47] samuel i'd love to but they have to
[1:33:50] invite me
[1:33:51] but jesus go to that door in their life
[1:33:55] but samuel i'm a gentleman
[1:33:58] hallelujah they must invite me amen
[1:34:02] what about when he comes down speaks to
[1:34:04] our hearts
[1:34:05] deals with our lives maybe in little
[1:34:08] gary we're feeling
[1:34:09] pretty good about we're feeling right
[1:34:12] about maybe justified about something
[1:34:15] god comes down and deals with our life
[1:34:18] i don't know lord i don't know
[1:34:21] they don't seem like right now what
[1:34:22] they've done to me they're not worthy of
[1:34:24] love that's the time they need
[1:34:26] love amen
[1:34:30] none of us could be worthy of love
[1:34:33] he loved us when we were unlovable
[1:34:37] and because of that he's made us
[1:34:40] love them friends these are not things
[1:34:43] that we you and i can do on our own
[1:34:44] we can look to god and we can ask god we
[1:34:46] can be honest with god and say lord
[1:34:49] help me lord amen help me lord jesus
[1:34:52] let's pray heavenly father lord we thank
[1:34:56] you dear god for your mercy tonight lord
[1:34:59] thank you for your word lord truly
[1:35:03] this is lord so the character your own
[1:35:07] character in life
[1:35:08] so contrary to that of our first nature
[1:35:12] our first birth to that of the world
[1:35:17] but lord jesus i'm just so thankful
[1:35:22] lord god how that you
[1:35:25] would come lord if i can say it this way
[1:35:29] just as your prophet would say it
[1:35:32] that you would come and be identified
[1:35:35] with me
[1:35:36] brother branham would say it that he
[1:35:39] would be humiliated
[1:35:40] by being identified with me one who's
[1:35:44] illiterate cannot pronounce his words
[1:35:46] correctly
[1:35:47] but yet he would come
[1:35:50] lord when i think of that what about
[1:35:54] each of our lives lord
[1:35:57] help us lord help us lord when
[1:36:01] there's times lord that would come about
[1:36:03] our life maybe
[1:36:05] things lord that we feel like we're
[1:36:06] writing and maybe we are right
[1:36:08] maybe we are right maybe we're even
[1:36:10] justified
[1:36:11] in something
[1:36:14] but lord when we think about the
[1:36:16] character of your life
[1:36:19] [Music]
[1:36:20] well that changes things lord help us
[1:36:23] lord i ask you to help us help us to
[1:36:25] apply this in our life
[1:36:27] help us lord we just don't want to hear
[1:36:29] the word that lord we want to receive it
[1:36:32] help us to apply it in our life god help
[1:36:34] us that our
[1:36:36] we would yield that god that you can
[1:36:39] shape and mold
[1:36:41] our lives being conformed to your own
[1:36:44] glorious image
[1:36:45] in our walks our actions our behavior
[1:36:49] because lord we realize that one of
[1:36:52] these moments
[1:36:53] we're going to be changed in a moment in
[1:36:56] a twinkling of an eye
[1:36:59] we won't take any grudges with us
[1:37:04] matter of fact lord we can't even have
[1:37:05] grudges to go
[1:37:07] help us help us lord god to unpack any
[1:37:10] weight that's hindering because that
[1:37:12] weight's hindering right now
[1:37:16] lord jesus in that moment
[1:37:21] we will take nothing of this life with
[1:37:24] us
[1:37:25] except our character and our character
[1:37:29] is not a gift
[1:37:31] the holy ghost is a free gift
[1:37:34] the holy ghost is the gift of god we
[1:37:36] can't earn it we don't marry
[1:37:38] it but it's yielding ourselves
[1:37:42] and lord you coming and accepting the
[1:37:45] sacrifice
[1:37:46] it's not us accepting you it's the fire
[1:37:49] of god coming down
[1:37:50] and consuming the sacrifice
[1:37:53] but then lord is that life would work
[1:37:55] within our life
[1:37:56] [Music]
[1:37:58] after we've accepted that invitation
[1:38:04] the lord that our character might be
[1:38:05] molded to your own glorious character
[1:38:10] lord jesus i realize as i stand here
[1:38:12] every one of us
[1:38:16] lord it's our it's up to us to humble
[1:38:20] ourselves
[1:38:21] i realize this congregation my wife
[1:38:23] nobody
[1:38:24] can humble me for me lord i have to
[1:38:28] humble myself
[1:38:31] i have to do that lord
[1:38:34] just like each and every one of my
[1:38:35] brothers and sisters
[1:38:37] these are things lord that they must do
[1:38:41] but lord we don't do it out of law
[1:38:44] we do it out of love
[1:38:47] help us lord i pray that we can stay in
[1:38:51] that place
[1:38:52] lord when you use us speak to us
[1:38:55] help us lord that we'll become more
[1:38:59] simple
[1:39:01] littler as the prophet put it staying in
[1:39:04] a place
[1:39:06] where you can use us if you need to lord
[1:39:11] lord i just want to stay in a place that
[1:39:14] you're welcome to come
[1:39:16] that you feel welcome you feel a
[1:39:18] welcoming spirit
[1:39:22] i pray lord may we let this mind
[1:39:27] be in us lord may we not lord walk
[1:39:31] according to our own
[1:39:32] thinking i realize lord this is molding
[1:39:35] this is character molding and shaping
[1:39:38] but lord jesus i ask lord help us
[1:39:42] because there's times lord we've still
[1:39:43] taken our own thinking lord
[1:39:45] lord i confess that
[1:39:49] the lord jesus
[1:39:52] that's my desire as that mind
[1:39:55] that new creation on the inside
[1:39:59] lord god to walk lord
[1:40:03] according to your mind lord not mine
[1:40:07] but you are smart help us lord i pray
[1:40:11] for your mind for its greatness but its
[1:40:14] greatness
[1:40:15] and that of humility help us
[1:40:19] lord if there's any area of our life
[1:40:20] that's puffed up
[1:40:22] would you just lord deflate us deflate
[1:40:26] that lord
[1:40:27] we don't want that in our life help us
[1:40:29] we feel like we're a little better or
[1:40:31] think this or that lord
[1:40:33] that's none of you help us lord i pray
[1:40:36] [Music]
[1:40:38] granted lord may we adorn those garments
[1:40:42] [Music]
[1:40:44] maybe lord it's a garment that we're
[1:40:45] adorned with that we can say well i
[1:40:47] don't know that
[1:40:48] this person's personality or the way
[1:40:50] that they're made up it's just
[1:40:51] you know we just don't seem really to
[1:40:53] hit it off but may we adorn that
[1:40:55] garment of humility not that you
[1:40:57] intended for
[1:40:59] every one of us that we would be best
[1:41:01] buddies with one another but
[1:41:02] we would have loved one for time
[1:41:06] in humility lord help us lord i pray
[1:41:10] because i'm sure lord i'm positive sure
[1:41:13] there's a lot of things that you look
[1:41:14] over in our life
[1:41:16] a lot of times lord we can see as we
[1:41:18] look back down through it
[1:41:20] but god you've been so merciful
[1:41:23] you've come lord jesus when we did
[1:41:25] deserve it
