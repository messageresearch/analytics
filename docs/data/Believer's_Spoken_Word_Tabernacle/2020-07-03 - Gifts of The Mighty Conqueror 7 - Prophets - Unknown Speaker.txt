promise that we have man and we hold it dear to our hearts so good to be in the house of the Lord tonight to be gathered together and we want to just welcome sister Lily's family god bless you it's good to have you all here it's just so so thankful for the mercy of the Lord God has kept his hand upon us and you know in many different trials and things that come our way and especially in the times that we are we are living in but I'm grateful to God that we have a certainty in him as David when David would write of that in Psalms 27 I think it's so it's so fitting brother branham would take that for the text of the rapture and we see it so much more clear now who shall I fear whom shall I be afraid of and I tell you what if you're looking or listening at the wrong things fear of fear can strike but if we just keep our eyes on Jesus he's directing he is leading us through the whole way amen let's go to the word of the Lord tonight if we could thank you musicians I want to go right back into Ephesians 4 and we'll just we read a verse here in verse 11 and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers now it's it's not how some have read this they've read it some have read it well he you needed a pastor he gave you a pastor he gave you you need an apostle he gave you an apostle you needed a prophet he gave you a prophet no no what God provides we need it all and it's God working through the gifts the ministerial gifts that he's placed in his body he's got a purpose and that's what continues on here in the scripture it continues on in that purpose and I'm not gonna read that for sake of time but there's a purpose that God has in mind an achievement amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord we are standing here tonight Oh God we're depending on you Father Lord we can do nothing in ourselves Lord we need you Lord Jesus and Lord as we're looking Oh God with our all of our hearts Lord we're looking Lord for your coming Oh God we're thankful Lord for your mercy Lord then we would be dialed into that in this hour or god and Lord we thank you O God once again Lord for the grace of God that's been given to us Lord in this hour we ask that Lord that your spirit would just come Lord now through your word and speak to our hearts Lord help me to get out of a way that you can say what it is that you desire to say we pray Lord we just commit ourselves to you now in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you as you're being seated I want to just pick right up there in Ephesians 4 and we find that as we've been looking here in these ministerial offices of how that God has so given them and set in the body and how that God would work through the administration and moving through these offices that he himself is the one who's meeting all of our needs we were looking at that with of an apostle the past couple of times and here tonight when we just begin to look into this I want to deal with it just a little bit on on that second part on how God has given some prophets and we recognize that that's a term and I I i have come to just see that term where it's just seemingly just has been used so loosely i said one of the things that i never seen too much of before until even when i had moved in the area and you can find it even among certain groups and things like that where everybody's a prophet and this one's a prophet and this one's a prophet and we we understand that when we we look at these things in the word of god i one scripture that has so stood out to me where it i look at all of this in the Word of God and we find that there is not one man who makes himself anything it's God who has already placed it within the man and God brings forth to vindicate whatever gift that he has placed in that man's life I love the scripture where it says in Hebrews five I believe it's verse 4 where it speaks of the calling unto unto be a high priest and it says no man taketh this honor unto himself even as Aaron and Aaron himself it was not Aaron who was vowing for a position but God in the vision he made known to Moses that see that I have called Aaron and God had already everything was already laid out just like in every one of these gifts and sometimes the gift itself even when it would start out thin let's say and in a life as we're focusing here within that of ministry sometimes it's a gift as it starts out and you know a person could say well I think this one's this or I think this brother maybe he's a teacher I think this brother he's a pastor I think one thing that's for sure whatever God has called him to do he's equipped them and when the scripture says do the work of an evangelist it doesn't necessarily mean that the man himself is an evangelist although a man can have more than one gift in his life Paul had Paul had multiple officers there within his own life so it isn't just that he would be in just one office but sometimes things can operate just for a season but it's always at God's discretion and it's always at God's choosing and I think we can see this oversight that it's God that is watched over and provided for itself and when we think of this here with that of the prophets we look here in the scripture and we know a prophet many times when we think of a prophet and I'm going to just kind of speak to this here tonight we we we sometimes just think in terms of major prophet and there is a one major prophet but there are minor prophets and sometimes where the scripture said and he gave some prophets so we recognize that when God has set forth this administration there's much of it that will parallel how it was in the Old Testament yet there are changes that have come about within that new administration as the Messiah has come and we see you know brother Branham would make make a statement like this and as I just refer to this tonight you say the Prophet he said as you'll take every office you say he's a special man and he says now it doesn't mean that he's a man above anybody else as far as he's a greater man but he's got a special job and a special Commission now what he said that's the prophet of the age and God has set that forth Eve it's identified that ministry that's to come forth of a prophet of God it's laid out in the scripture and God makes that known in his generation God will reveal that and it will be a ministry that is founded in the scriptures and the holy spirit declares it not everybody will hear it but those who are ordained to hear it will hear it and they recognize the office they recognize who is in their midst they recognize that authority of the word that's given and we recognize that when we see this there have always been God has always had prophets and there are major prophets that God would send to his people and we find that many times as the people has look in Israel they would get away from the word and God would send them the prophet and the Prophet would speak to them and begin to call out their ways and revealing the ways where they have drifted yet they were holding as it were the written word brother Bram says it like this in way of a true prophet he says here they were he said to think of Amos coming down into that city he said and they were holding the Word of God like the government he said in their looking at it that were still Christians and we're still believers he said they could not see that they had drifted from the word though they had the written word but they did not have the right interpretation of the word because the right interpretation of the word must come by the word himself and when the world himself interprets that word and makes it alive it draws the people of God in union with that word and then the people that become United with that message become the very reflection of God's own holiness because the word calls us to a separation that's why brother Branham says in the way of a true prophet I find how fitting he says don't blame the government it's not the government's fault he said for the way things are going it's because he said the pulpits have strayed from just saith the Lord they gone away from the Lifeline that happened in Israel it's happened here so God will have major profits then he will send to his people he'll call him back to the word from where they've drifted and yet there are also minor prophets that will better profit they prophesied being used of God like when you look at Micaiah here here stands micaiah he he stands there under the unction of the Holy Spirit and remember he was not loved by a hand he was hated the reason he was hated is because he told him the truth of his own sinful life he didn't like the word bringing conviction to his life but notice macaé could stand there and hear he by the Spirit of God he told him go ahead and go on up but he says I see Israel setting scattered on a hillside without a shepherd now remember Micaiah was standing there and where he was he's prophesying right in line with the prophecy that Elijah had already prophesied and refined that how ill I should follows that of Elijah and so how God has had major the major prophets there's been the minor prophets and now when we come over here into the New Testament I want to open up by looking at a few scriptures because you know how it is many times when you speak to people or as people talk it's in their books and they look at it as though prophets are a thing from the past now I believe you're sitting here tonight you recognize prophets are not a thing of the past because if you can put them in the past you can put God in the past in Matthew chapter 11 verse 13 for all the prophets and the law prophesied until John Luke 16:16 the law and the prophets were unto John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses into him Jesus is speaking here not as though that the law and the prophets were done away for with they they were prophesying of the Messiah to come and here was the one who was the fulfillment of it he himself said I have not come to do away with the prophets or the law you see when the fulfillment of the word has come and brought on the scene by God it doesn't have to change the word to try to fit in it is ordained of God and God puts that piece right in it's ordained place glory be to God a man doesn't have to alter the word to be able to stand in that office God has called him God's prepared him and God has watched over his life even and how to see it within marriage God has watched over that I believe that was on my heart in Hebrews 1:1 God who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in times past unto the father's in the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world now the same God who spoke through the prophets is the same God who came and revealed himself from word to flesh and that same God here as he spoke there in the Ministry of Jesus Christ is earthly ministry Paul is picking that up and saying that ministry has not ceased a man these 301 the father the word and the Holy Ghost is there what John said here it brings them all together now notice Jesus laying this down for the church in John 15:26 when the comforter has come whom I will send unto you from the father even the Spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me he's also bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning so the spirit of truth coming it brings conviction it draws that heart into a place to where not only does that heart land up and say he is my Savior but that heart yields for him to become Lord and when he becomes Lord then it testifies indeed he is the true atonement and add that which was a part now has been atoned for see that life will speak out the life that's within the blood now John 16:12 I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now howbeit when he the Spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come notice how the Lord Jesus he's declaring that Spirit of Truth here is the god of glory reflecting himself in the glory of God through the Son of God and he's declaring that when the Spirit of Truth has come there are things I want to tell you right now but you can't bear them God waits for an ordained season although he wants to say it he waits to the appropriate time just like when he said except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood he didn't explain it many walked away brother Aaron even the elect said if you ask them what does that mean I don't know but like Peter thou alone has the words of eternal life angle nowhere else I may have questions but I know I'm in the presence of one who dissolves all doubts and he is the answer to every question I have hallelujah when the Spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth verse 14 for he shall glorify me he shall receive of mine and shall shew it unto you all things that the father has are mine therefore said I then he shall take of mine and shall show it on to you he's establishing the Lord Jesus is establishing here the work of the Spirit of Truth in the church will be the testimony of Jesus Christ it'll be the spirit of prophecy in the Church of the Living God the church will be under his leadership listen it will be even closer than what it was when they came out of Egypt when they came out of Egypt the pillar of fire was before him the cloud was before but now this same one who was there to lead him said I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age I'll take the word and reveal it to you hallelujah Oh glory be to God blessed are your eyes to see and your ears that hear I remember what it was like as a boy to hear the message to hear it me preach but it was like going over my head you see this is where it comes even for your young people you don't have to go out in the world to know God's grace you don't have to smoke drink or anything else but in one one thing that happens is is how God moves in and this word it takes a hold in your life and Jesus Christ is revealed to be the same yesterday today and forever brother the love of God enters your heart and there's nothing else than matters hallelujah paul goes on and first Timothy 2:5 for there is one God and one mediator between God and men the man Christ Jesus who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time are you a witness the ransoms been paid how do you know because I'm free I'm not just believing on to freedom I'm free I'm free right here I'm free we're in - I am ordained a preacher and an apostle I speak the truth in Christ and lie not a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and Verity brother Ram picks this up and I perceived out a prophet he says now to bring up this faith in Christ there's minister that's the most important thing of the day is a good god sent preacher not just a preacher anything enough how shall they preach except they be sent not by man but sent by God yeah not just running but running with a message hallelujah a good God sent preacher always says I admire them and their gift is far beyond anything that could be done in anything else is a preacher a man who knows how to rightly divide the word of God how does a man know that God is gifted and it's God coming down and using that gift it's not a man's ability it's the most wonderful gift in the world is to be a minister which a New Testament modern-day prophet a preacher prophecy means to foretell or to tell some personal thing he says and in other words the last statement prophesized to testify or foretell and that's the Spirit of Christ is prophecy in revelation 19:10 here were John is made known there of the bride in John in Revelation 19:10 here as he says I fell at his feet to worship Him and he said unto me see thou do I said not now remember there was in in Revelations 1 there is an angel that is sent to signify these things to John but that angel is the same angel that was in the wilderness it's the same pillar fire the same age of the Lord not an earthly messenger but this is where that here that same age of the Lord as the age of the Lord came to Paul the angel of the Lord not just even to a prophet the Bible says he came to Philip the Evangelist the angel of the Lord came to Peter you see the angel of the Lord comes to the children of God we're under his direction the angel God encamps around those who fear Him and love him is that right so so as we see here that when we we recognize that here when when John would fall down to worship Him this particular individual here they have received of what God has revealed to them you remember brother Branham saying in false false anointed ones at the end time I think I have it correct brother Ram says in there he stops and he says oh can you get it separated now it's not he says he says he says it's ace on a man revealing ji-sun a man to be able to recognize that the God taking an earthly vessel and reflecting his life through glory you know that goes for me it challenged my god let my life be so surrender that you can reflect yourself [Music] wherever we go see thou do it not see our real true ministry does not take worship and that fellow-servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy the message a great warrior Joshua the dream says you know what a prophet is a New Testament prophet is a preacher is exactly a prophet is a preacher the word prophet means to foretell or tell forth look at his next statement either preach or for town he says now if you can't believe the dictionary for it here's what the Bible says the testimony of Jesus Christ is a spirit of prophecy you ready so every one of you are prophets to testify of Jesus Christ it's the spirit of prophecy the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy now as we look at this on the day of Pentecost remember God had made a promise and a covenant then he would come and he would live inside of his children he would write upon the table of their hearts and their minds and he himself would come and live in his people this was a restoring of what and they have fallen from in Eden and on the day of Pentecost when the Bible says here when it fully come we find out that God subdividing himself all the fullness was in Christ Jesus in the Lord Jesus Christ but then as he's ascended up and here now being seated he sends back the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit it is poured out God pours himself into his believing church listen to me now there wasn't one person who got the Holy Ghost that was not a believer you first have to be a believer they were believer in the resurrected work of the Lord Jesus Christ they were distraught but when he stepped up there on the road of Emmaus and begin to take the scriptures concerning himself they did not recognize him physically but when he took that word and begin to reveal himself in the word and the Spirit of God would move down brother when they came there in the house he did something in their midst that he did one time before all it takes is God to manifest his promise that he's the same God and brother to a believer they say that's it every promise in the book belongs to me the Holy Ghost belongs to me Healing belongs to me deliverance belongs to me because a believer recognized God when he speaks if he made a promise one time and kept it he's a saint but tonight whoa hallelujah he said the works that I do shall you do also amen he would prove himself among his believing Church this was showed even in the Ministry of Moses here's Moses he's carrying the burden and God says bring to your side some elders and I will take of the spirit that is upon you and I will divide it on from them and God took the same spirit no less power just more machinery well what happened on the day of Pentecost acts 1:1 all great Theophilus I ran into you the things that Jesus began to do and teach he has not ceased he has not stopped whoa because when God has called you and God has equipped you with the Holy Ghost you have to be a witness the life of Jesus Christ in your life it prophesize I had just read here the scripture the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy it's the Holy Ghost in your life that you have been made partners with him in Redemption to go search out for lost shows sheep that are out there God has placed you where he has for a reason it's so simple so simple but that just like what I heard the Prophet even say that again you the other day just like it just reached off there was on the ladder and just shipped me witnesses and this is where that Moses remember what you think of this the Spirit comes upon him they begin to prophesy there's two in the camp that are prophesying and Joshua raised them says hey let's go tell them to stop juster had to be corrected what did Moses say let me read this in here in numbers in numbers 11 29 Moses said impious down for my sake would God that all the Lord's people were prophets and that the Lord would put a spirit upon them a prophet what is moved by divine inspiration rather we're not church members amen we are prisoners of Jesus Christ we've been bought by a price we've been set free and that Christ might operate freely through our lives remember you may never preach a sermon but surely life preacher series it preaches sermons your life standing for that word it's thunder against Satan's Kingdom it thunders out purity holiness it's a life that's being lived through you it's not your voice it's God's voice that's living out through your life that's why Paul said your faith has sounded out so I'm brother Benson you want to win your loved ones be loyal to what you believe don't compromise stand silent on the Word of God they've gotta have somewhere to come back to this world is falling apart things they felt like they can put their feet on it's crumbling there's only one sure ground and that is dust saith the Lord [Applause] hallelujah I'm speaking to a special class of people tonight some may are not even graduated high school but you're a special class cuz it ain't based on your intellect there's something with inside of you a germ from the foundation of the world when the Holy Spirit it speaks brother it lifts that up there's a communication that's going on between you and God but there's sometimes things you do you don't even feel spiritual God is leading you and you have confidence he's leading me hallelujah I tell you what when the scripture says as Peter Steven oh my Paul throughout the book of Acts and on they were they declared what the prophets have spoken Jesus Christ has fulfilled so much so that Peter could say to him give all the prophets witness can I bring that on down what was hidden what was a mystery of Christ being reflected in Bride form now that same word gives witness of him present in his bride our lives are to give witness of the Lord Jesus Christ my wife and I didn't know it's gonna say it but my wife and my mom were sitting outside the other day and I just was getting out of the car to walk up where they were sitting and here was two women they stomped and they looked mine and they said they just stopped and they looked out and they said I just said to my friend I know of those from women right there that's got contact with God let me tell you something the way that you dress and you carry yourself and you conduct yourself it speaks a lot that ain't to lift them up I'm saying it speaks a lot and many times you had people come over to your table and say I've seen a light above your table I tell you what my heart's desire is that they would surrender their life to God you see within this the scripture says as we were looking at reading here in this scriptures brother Brown with jealousy said now he said you know when we look at it he said at the change of the dispensation from law into grace it did not change God's still sending prophets for in the New Testament we find prophecy went on just the same and also prophets went on just the same now notice he's separating this here prophecy is a gift it's a gift that might be on one and then on another in any local church and everyone may prophesy one by one brother Branham is referring here to first Corinthians 14 and I'm just being very intentional with it because the scripture here in 1st Corinthians 14 and I don't have it up there but you could probably turn to it in your in your scriptures you remember the Holy Spirit through Paul would admonish the mills and Corinthians because they were one has a tongue one has a solemn one as of this one is it this and you see it wasn't that it was wrong to want to do something for the kingdom of God it's that they had the cart before the horse it's not to take your gift and try to serve but it's your life and let God use it to serve his purpose and they were so caught up and wanting to do this and wanted into that and brother bream says when you go to start seeking after those things he said that's where demons can enter into that realm why because the very motive and objective at the very foundation is wrong that's why we wanna that's why Paul could say I'll show you a more excellent way he was not saying do away with the gifts he's letting it be known let love govern it and love itself as he lays it out by the Spirit of God it thinketh no evil in it you know it does not delight in iniquity and well it's patient its kind and you know as we go through Scripture let that be the governing principle of the gifts and Paul brings it in that whoever is going to just you know to speak he said pray rather that you may prophesy because prophecy edifies the church God uses the gifts sovereignly suffer it's about gone as we were looking at last week in the book of Acts the supernatural it was God using the gifts I think how Paul writes it in Hebrews four and it speaks of how God working by them miracles it was God doing the work and so when we look here in first Corinthians 14 see when we see this here in the scripture I'm just gonna read this here in first Corinthians 14 29 let the Prophet speak two or three and let the other judge those are not those are not ministerial gifts he's speaking of the gift of prophecy moving in the church every individual baptized into the body of Jesus Christ is subject to any of the nine spiritual gifts is that right this is why brother Brown would say a person can't say well I've got this gift and I've got that gift he deals with that on the nine spiritual gifts because you now you'll find there will be tendencies of where how things can be used but here's where it all comes down whether whether it has to do with the nine spiritual gift and one of the five ministerial gifts we want to be available we want to be available we want to be in a place where God can move down and use us Lord whatever you want me to do for your kingdom for your glory for the furtherance of your work David said I'd rather be a doormat at the house of god than to dwell in the tents of the wicked hey man I'd rather be there now notice let the Prophet speak two or three and let the other judge and now this whole part o my brother Brandon goes into this he says see he says you know you could keep on going there might in there it falls on this one and here you know the spirit of prophecy falls on this one this one speaks in tongues this one interprets it he says he could good you know keep on going but he says let it be by the course of two or three one thing one thing as of many things that the message brings back to the reality among the Church of the Living God is that as sons and daughters of God we're not just loosey-goosey are you with me it is not something well I don't got a little control over it or I can't help it but man said oh yes you do and many times I could come up here and maybe when I'm getting ready to introduce brothers so and solar lord help me if I come up here after they preach then you can feel that anointing right there that many times I go on a brother Brian lead them in song that anointing is right here you can just cut loose and start preaching the gift is there but I know it's not my time oh my now don't nobody bring up any dates when I did it either and this is why Paul would go home to say if anything be revealed to another that said it's by let the first hold his peace for you may all prophesy one by one that you all may learn and may be comforted and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets for God is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the saints simply put the footnotes on it is when the spirit the spirit of the prophets out here is subject to the one who's standing in the pulpit you don't interrupt the ministering of the word so you see it's the Spirit of God prophecy moving out through there it's the testimony of Jesus Christ now listen that gift when it's burning on that heart I don't know I'm just going this way when it's burning on that heart remember the Spirit of God through the prophets ministry teaches ourselves you hang on to that to the end of the service and don't tell me you can't do it because there are many times there's things I've had to hold and not preached until a different time oh yes oh it's not easy but it but good but you see with that of the profits I want to just just just felt just to move that that piece right there where the Spirit of God moving through the profits and we see there's the difference between a prophesy being a gift one of the nine spiritual gifts and we need it because it's to bring comfort and edification to the church you see how the spirit of prophecy will move down when there's a decision to be made that persons praying about it Lord do I go here do I move here do and do this do I do this now the answer perhaps has been right before him all along but God's mercy will come right down and speak directly to that need I've witnessed it where God has spoke things so clearly you have to right here in the Assembly minute spoke so clearly I've witnessed to where God has called people by name and called him out to the altar I'm witness where the Holy Spirit has spoke when there was not a name put to it but the whole person who it was intended for they knew it was for them and they rejoiced and received peace God is purposeful aren't you glad for the testimony of Jesus Christ the spirit of prophecy it's God watching over his children so and this is where brother Bram says that he says a prophet is an office of the church it's not a gift in the church but an office of the church that's what a prophet is he says therefore deign predestinated there born of God they're not made they're born prophets and I want to just come back to that to that place here and just try to move in here for the home run stretch as it were tonight and taking that part where a prophet is a preacher where it says and some prophets which is to foretell or tell forth either preach or for town and G here the Lord Jesus speaking through Paul in first Corinthians 12 says now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular and God has set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers and he goes on down through the rest and here let me just do without quoting this but just to refer to it this will brother Brandon picks this up in voice of the sign and he talks of how preaching is a gift that's inspired of God and how that a man can actually have more than one gift in his life and you seen the scripture then we just read with Paul Paul said the preacher an apostle and a teacher to the Gentiles Paul had many gifts in his life ministerial offices that's right sometimes a person says well I thought this brother was an evangelist and now he's pastoring a church well if he's if he's entertained a pastor then you know what God had that any mall go all the time it'll come out when it gets into that time there's gonna be little things here and there but it will come out within that time it's the same thing you look at this and sometimes let me just pause on this sometimes this is where that I think so much pressure sometimes can come even morale young ministers is because it's the feeling of what am i what am i what am i a mine apostle and my prophet and my pastor am i this are you a minister well yeah we'll go and preach because you may not be an apostle you may not be a pastor you may not be a teacher you may you might just be a preacher nothing wrong with that nothing wrong with praying for the preacher either I'll take that you see it's not it's not for us to decide even how God gives a man then I'll God will gift a certain man and God the way that the measure of the gift will operate within that man's life you can't compare other men to him it's how it's caught God's the one then as determined on that have some are more gifted than others Oh God knows what he's doing in all of that it's to keep us looking to him this is where brother Branham makes it in this in this quote and and you find him dealing with this over and over because among the churches and things they have God that got to such a place they no longer believed in prophets they would take scriptures of Daniel Scylla seal up the prophecy Daniel till the time of the end and men will interpret things and you know they're trying to do all they all they can do but you see by not reading the full scripture you recognize that that wasn't the end of prophets there's prophets in the New Testament so this is why brother brems says you can't he says it like this he says as long as there's apostles there's got to be a prophet as long as there's a prophet there's got to be evangelists there's a pastor evangelist but there's no prophet see that's you picking what you want to and making it say something it doesn't we don't want to be Pickers we want to be believers hallelu it's a cohesive unit it's the Ministry of Jesus Christ perfecting the Saints edifying the body of Jesus Christ with a growth into manhood into full maturity now remember Peter would Peter would speak of this word of prophecy that we've received and he would say we've received a more sure word of prophecy this is not cunning devised fables Peter said we have witnessed we stood there we heard we seen on Mount Transfiguration and we have received of the evidence of the resurrection in our own life we have a more sure word of prophecy for the prophecy I love this in verse 21 came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost 1st Peter 4:11 If any man speak let him speak as the Oracles of God If any man Minister let him do it as of the ability which God giveth that God and all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ to whom be praised and Dominion for ever and ever amen now that going into this part tonight but I think we recognized here in the New Testament Paul Apostle Paul was indeed the prophet of God to that first age and he would take that word he was commissioned by God to bret baier the name of the lord jesus unto the gentiles paul spoke very affirmatively and i'm not going to go into that aspect of it tonight because paul and beed was the major prophet after the lord jesus it went off the scene here Paul is the one was separating law from grace remember Peter would even Express and say hey I know some of you from our beloved brother Paul the wisdom that God has given him some he says wrestle those that are unlearned they wrestle he said things it's hard to be understood look at God's grace when it was crossing over the overlapping from the Jews to the Gentiles remember Paul said I preached the Word of God in that the word being declared by signs wonders and miracles from Jerusalem throughout and then God turned fully to the Gentiles right God turned fully to the Gentiles because the Jews had rejected but yet there were Jews in that first age brother and that were part of the bride of Jesus Christ and the things that they had been under or you know not eating this and not doing that and keeping this feast God in His grace did not look to them and say don't do that but he recognized you can't bring that over unto the Gentiles because Christ is the fulfillment of all of those things there had to be a word of authority and that's why Paul could say the same who wrought effectually in me that Apostleship to the circumcision the same one wrought mightily in Peter to the circumcision remember Peter even had a problem right Peter was eating a pork chop had the juice all over his hands and here the Brethren showed up from Jerusalem the beggining listen to me see under the pressure you see this is why Paul could say it is not done in faith it's sin who so here God in the book of Acts let me just look at this just for a moment a few places here is Paul he's struck down on the road to Damascus now there's already prophets in the church here's the fears brother branham picks this up he picks up the one of the first dimensions is right here with Ananias he said Ananias and acts 9 I don't have that there in the scriptures but acts 9 God reveals himself to and a nice bad vision he says go down and I there is one in the street called straight and you know he makes it known and what then Ananias a lord not that guy not that guy but God notice Ananias he's yielded to God and God says no for I've chosen him he's a chosen vessel Oh glory be to God what Ananias then you might have been Ananias Oh Lord I don't know about them I don't know about there remember there was somebody that said that about you but God said there and chosen vessel oh [Music] [Laughter] he goes down there by vision and he prays for him scales fall from eyes receives the Holy Ghost as baptized now notice the Bible says in acts 11 27 it says and in those days Came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch and there stood up one of them named Agabus and signified by the spirit that there should be a great dearth throughout all the world which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar now here God sends Agathis down there with other prophets preachers but agamous now listen to me now activist he also this is a gift that's operating a ministerial gift God still has a ministerial gift of profits and notice where those profits came they weren't off by themselves drawing people to themselves they were of God they went to the Church of God because that's where they were a part of this is a postal Accord it's not profit setting out here and sending out things and doing this and overriding the local sovereignty that's not a prophet of God prophets were sent from Jerusalem let me just drop this in - it's free one thing you find in the book of Acts you don't find the people evangelist the ministers you don't find them just walking around loosey-goosey like brother where you come from I'm just an evangelist oh yeah who's your pastor I'm just an evangelist hey they didn't have a whole trench you ain't preaching here that's apostolic because the Bible says when they win you can read this in the scriptures they wrote letters of commendation have this brother in he'll be a blessing to you that's apostolic it wasn't just somebody floating out here like a whim when there was something purposed to be done they got the elders together they fasted they pray until the Holy Ghost spoke he's the same God hello somebody he's the same God I'm talking about the testimony of Jesus Christ the spirit of prophecy agamous here was a New Testament prophet as he comes down you're aware when activists come I could act 21:8 here is Paul Paul's coming to the right before going to appear they're going into Jerusalem in verse 10 let me just skip to there as we tarry there they come to Caesarea says as we tarried there there came down from Judea a certain prophet named Agabus remember Paul was the major prophet that's why brother Branham would say in the church age book he says I don't deny he says that there's not many other prophets he says as it was in the days of Paul he said but I will say this with the scripture there is but one in that day and this day that has the ministry of infallibility whoo hallelujah there was a standard all glory be to God brother that same absolute that was within Paul's heart that was the same absolute in the lives of the people as an anchor as a sure word of prophecy the Holy Ghost had made it real to them it didn't mean that they understood everything or could explain everything but brother they knew there was an absolute anchor and the end of all strife they had commander the testimony of Jesus Christ their lives were a testimony of redemptions work that I was included in Redemption I'm not the same person 11 and when he came unto us he took Paul's girdle and bound his own hands and feet and said thus saith the Holy Ghost so shall the Jews of Jerusalem bind the man that oneth this girdle it shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles and brother Brown picks this up and he says Paul should have listened powerful statement he said Paul should have listened he said but what it was now watch this is something here I love what you're going through that in the Holy Spirit just moving that on down but he said what it was is that Paul was tired he was tired he said Paul wanted he hadn't set in his heart he wanted to die for the cause of Jesus Christ Paul esteemed Stevens so much that testimony for the brandman you know will come off then he said C says that's why we need to listen to the Holy Spirit Paul wasn't out of the will of God are you with me but you see the Holy Spirit was dealing with him the word was going to get to Rome God had a way of getting it there ha let's just stop here tonight on in the scriptures in acts 13 1 there in the church was an ante and was that Antioch certain prophets and teachers will be talking about preachers remember a New Testament prophet is a preacher Herman says well this just this brothers a prophet well he is does he preach nope being he ain't a prophet sorry this is all through the message this is the scripture God doesn't have men sitting around and well this man's in the church and he's a prophet you know know if he's a prophet and ministerial gift then he's a preacher are you with me you can't confuse a prophet and a gift of prophecy and if it's a gift of prophecy that's got to be proven by two or three and judged before it should ever come out in the church that's scriptural is that right what's that that's keeping the church in order all glory be to God can I read one more scripture Samuel I'm not one of these little prop planes I need a longer runway I don't mean anything higher lifted up by that I understand I wish I could come to like brother Jewell said parachute out of here mater I can find that gear knocks 15 here were epistles that were sent to the church that was gathered in Antioch with Paul and barn remember there have been Judaizers men James said we didn't send those men those men have come down there to try to cause trouble to try to make followers after themselves saying you must be circumcised you got to do this gene you got it remember they came among the Galatians and the Galatians one thing that's known about the Galatian people they're fickle people as you see God in His mercy God will take that right there in that powerful brother Joshua God doesn't say you know what oh man your makeup oh no no what am I gonna no no no God says I'll take that he already know about you and me he knew about our makeup mind that alone when I think of myself that's a mighty God let me get to the scripture verse 31 of Acts 18 went which when they had read they rejoiced for the consolation and Judas and Silas being prophets also themselves exhorted the Brethren with many words and confirmed them so I want you to see this they just didn't give them well I can't find that they just didn't give him the the epistles and say hey go just read this no no they took the epistles and they preached they exhorted them in this world you know in the Old Testament when you read through the Old Testament how many times brother Shane we're reading through there the Bible would talk about in the days of Israel say and here came a prophet of the Lord you know his name you know he's named a prophet of the Lord come and stood before the altar and probably you know his name the one thing you know he was a vessel that was surrendered to God importance is not about the name the importance is the message was delivered and there were people that received it in the changing from that white horse rider over into the red horse rider you come to that place of the niceic Council and here were Roman Catholicism where they're wanting to draw in the churches and they're wanting to make it under the control of the government one church they're all compromises they called the niceic council but Dave we don't know the names of these brethren brother Carlos the history tells us these were men that came out of the wilderness eating herbs and wrapped in sheepskin and they came there and they told the men don't you go to that council because we don't need to reason about God's Word God's church is a separated church brother Aaron they walked out there we don't know their names but they were put out but that seed had to go in the ground and the seed that went in the ground it's come through the stages back now in its fullness where the same God prophet that manifested himself back there in the initiating of redemption has come and moving through his body he's worked through the ministry in the office of a prophet in this last days and he is present in his body to finish redemptions work prophets are they needed yes yes and I say this very clearly I believe it with all my heart God has profit still don't probably David they would never I'm not talking about these guys that get off on these flyers you've got plenty of them that around that they're the apostle to the bride there that this that when you say that that chose me you got a wrong spirit because God has sent a voice in this hour there's one messenger to an age and that messenger had declared that the fluence is that age that Jesus Christ when man begins to purport himself as something he's nothing new with me it's good no man takes this honor unto himself even Jesus Christ did not glorify himself to be made high priest that's the pattern but the BAM tells us the man he says that's vying for the office is usually he said that's the man that's not called he doesn't have the right reverence because the same God that calls you and you stand there and say god I can't do it Lord how can I do it you say oh brother salmon that minute in when you first started bridging no no I'm more nervous now than when I first started I find myself walking on here just like even here tonight and I'll let you in a little something there was something human as I walked here and I said Lord do I preach this or do I go under this other thought that's also burning on my heart what do I go where'd I go even as I walk where do I go I need you Lord you can say I need you Lord I need you Lord Jesus I'm so grateful for God's mercy different testimonies as I said I've witnessed that God has normally as a preacher but men of God God will come down and they'll speak to things they'll be called out say praise be to God you know why I'm in that body my foot may not be rejoicing about the doughnut that I ate but my mouth is rejoicing pretty soon my foot will be happy it'll get the energy don't you love the Lord New Testament prophets and God declared in his word there would be a visitation in the end time you love him all right I hear the door on the on the cockpit I want to live the way he wants me to the musicians come please I want to live the way he wants me to live so when you go out of here tonight you say I'm a prophet a prophet and then you walk out as a sister and they said let's keep reaching no no no he misunderstand it's the testimony of Jesus Christ the spirit of prophecy is his life living out through me my life is inspired by his life let's stand if we could you love him hallelujah truly and I want to give until there's just no more to be [Music] I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to gain if hunt you there's just no more to give I want to love love - there's just no for I could never ever [Music] of the Lord I
