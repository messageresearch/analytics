[47:14] everything to us. Amen. He's everything.
[47:18] And uh greatest thing we're privileged
[47:21] to do is be able to lay down our lives.
[47:24] Amen. For him. Amen. Each and every day.
[47:27] And so we just thank God for his mercy.
[47:29] And just want to welcome each and every
[47:31] one of you. And um
[47:34] we want to just turn our attention here
[47:36] into uh the word of the Lord here
[47:40] this morning.
[47:44] And uh I want to like to go straight
[47:47] into
[47:49] Ruth chapter 4. And um
[48:07] amen. The word of the Lord is so
[48:09] wonderful
[48:10] &gt;&gt; and always so encouraging and refreshing
[48:13] and you know it's always gives us a real
[48:16] real direction in our lives and uh just
[48:20] um just a little something we'll speak
[48:22] on here this morning out of here that I
[48:25] really just couldn't get away from and
[48:27] I've been going back through that
[48:28] message I don't know for months even
[48:30] when I wasn't even uh took a little
[48:34] space from Ruth there and actually I was
[48:35] still in it but I was dealing with the
[48:37] between here and there and um I just
[48:41] couldn't get away from it. Just really
[48:43] something pressing from when we were on
[48:44] the plane and going to Texas and I just
[48:47] was looking at these things. So we just
[48:49] um just trust the Lord will just speak
[48:51] to our hearts. Amen. Once again, so
[48:54] let's look here in verse in verse 7 of
[48:57] Ruth chapter 4.
[49:02] And the scripture said, "Now this was
[49:03] the manner in former time in Israel
[49:06] concerning redeeming and concerning
[49:09] changing for to confirm all things. A
[49:12] man plucked off his shoe and gave it to
[49:15] his neighbor." And this was a testimony
[49:19] in Israel.
[49:21] Therefore, the kinsmen said unto Boaz,
[49:24] now remember this this kinsman that we
[49:28] have no name for it in the scripture.
[49:31] Naomi is aware
[49:33] of this other kinsman.
[49:36] Ruth is made aware of it as well. And
[49:38] this other kinsman is actually, as we
[49:40] looked at it a few weeks ago, was the
[49:43] nearest
[49:45] &gt;&gt; kinsman.
[49:46] and this nearest kinsman who he was
[49:50] willing to
[49:52] uh purchase the property of Naomi but
[49:56] when it came to Ruth that's where he
[49:58] drew the line so he was interested in
[50:01] property
[50:03] but the thing that he couldn't do
[50:06] remember the prophet tells us he said
[50:07] that near kinsman that was nearest to us
[50:11] was the devil
[50:13] &gt;&gt; and that was by that first nature
[50:17] We were born in sin, shaped in iniquity,
[50:20] come to this world speaking lies. We, as
[50:22] Paul would say, we were by nature
[50:25] &gt;&gt; the children of wrath. That's why the
[50:27] new birth is more than just an anointing
[50:31] that comes upon our spirit or our mind.
[50:35] Um, even deeper than to make us just
[50:38] love felio to love God in our own way.
[50:40] It's got to be the love of God. And
[50:43] there must be an absolute change in our
[50:46] life that only the Holy Spirit can
[50:48] bring. And when that change has come,
[50:51] it's not God cleaning up the old man and
[50:54] the old nature and trying to make him
[50:56] fitable, presentable.
[50:58] It's God actually moves in. The prophet
[51:00] teaches us over and over that God
[51:03] actually moves in. And as soon as he can
[51:05] get that first nature to agree with the
[51:08] word of God, he kills it.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Right? Because God, remember, he cannot
[51:15] marry us if we still have a living
[51:18] husband,
[51:20] &gt;&gt; right? That that'd be adultery. He can't
[51:22] do that. There has to be a death to that
[51:25] first husband,
[51:26] &gt;&gt; right? Romans 7. So then when that death
[51:30] has come, then God raises up that that
[51:32] place which has been reserved, that
[51:34] womb, that bedding ground that has been
[51:37] reserved for him the whole time. And
[51:40] then he imparts his life. It's God
[51:42] becoming now us uniting with God.
[51:47] So with this kinsman here, let me get
[51:49] back to scripture. It says, "Therefore
[51:51] the kinsmen said unto Boaz, buy it for
[51:54] thee." So he drew off his shoe. And Boaz
[51:59] said unto the elders.
[52:02] Boaz said unto the elders and to all of
[52:04] the people, "Ye are witnesses this day
[52:08] that I have bought all that was IMC and
[52:13] all that was Kylons and Malons of the
[52:16] hand of Naomi. Moreover, Ruth the
[52:20] Moabitis, the wife of Malon, have I
[52:24] purchased to be my wife." Oh my. to
[52:29] raise up the name of the dead upon his
[52:31] inheritance, that the name of the dead
[52:33] be not cut off from among his brethren.
[52:36] Remember that was part, as we looked at
[52:38] a few weeks ago, that was part of what
[52:39] was done. And from the gate of his
[52:43] place, ye are witnesses this day. And
[52:47] all the people that were in the gate,
[52:49] and the elders said, We are witnesses.
[52:52] The Lord make the woman that has come
[52:54] into thine house like Rachel and like
[52:56] Leah, which too did build the house of
[52:59] Israel, and do thou worthily in Ephra,
[53:03] and be famous in Bethlehem, and let thy
[53:06] house be like the house of Pharaohs,
[53:08] whom tomorrow bear unto Judah, of the
[53:11] seed which the Lord shall give thee of
[53:13] this young woman. So Boaz took Ruth, and
[53:17] she was his wife. And when he went in
[53:20] unto her, the Lord gave her conception,
[53:23] and she bare a son. I'd like to speak
[53:27] this morning on the reality of
[53:29] redemption.
[53:31] Let's just bow our heads in a word of
[53:33] prayer.
[53:34] Heavenly Father,
[53:37] Lord, we are certainly so thankful, dear
[53:40] God, as the songs that Zion have, Lord
[53:44] went forth and have been sung, Lord,
[53:47] from our hearts. God the experience Lord
[53:50] in our lives of who we know you to be.
[53:53] Father truly Lord the song that Lord
[53:56] even I came out here on amazing love oh
[54:00] God how incredible how Lord tremendous
[54:04] Lord it is oh God to think oh God of how
[54:08] that your love Lord it brought you down
[54:11] to become one of us Lord. Oh God, your
[54:15] love, Lord, manifest it to us that you
[54:18] would lay down your life for us, Lord.
[54:21] Oh God, you would bear away our sins,
[54:24] Lord. Take them to the lowest parts of
[54:26] hell and then to raise up on that Easter
[54:29] morning, Lord, to present yourself,
[54:32] Lord, and then to send back the Holy
[54:35] Ghost, Lord, that Father, you might not
[54:39] just be with us, but you would be in us,
[54:42] Lord. Oh God, bringing us back, Lord,
[54:45] that of our soul, Lord, into that place
[54:48] of a redeemed state. And Lord, through
[54:51] that, oh God, we have the longing, the
[54:54] groaning, the yearning, Lord, in our
[54:56] lives, Lord, for we know that God, when
[54:59] you have redeemed us, Lord, a redeemer,
[55:02] as your prophet says, redeems us
[55:04] completely, Lord, it begins with the
[55:07] soul. And father it works Lord God out
[55:10] Lord into the other realms Lord knowing
[55:12] one day Father oh God that this Lord
[55:16] this soul it will be matched and paired
[55:19] Lord with our theophony Lord and then
[55:22] Lord that glorified body oh God you have
[55:26] made a way Father and we're so thankful
[55:28] for your mercies Lord this morning
[55:31] Father may you just Lord God grant us
[55:34] the grace as speaker and hearer together
[55:37] to just step aside for a few moments,
[55:39] Lord. And God, may you breathe upon us,
[55:43] Lord Jesus. May the word of God just
[55:46] Lord come, I pray, Lord, just drive back
[55:48] any Lord, spirits of gloom and doubt and
[55:51] darkness, Lord. May God, may every
[55:54] promise, Lord Jesus, be made so certain
[55:58] because you've been lifted up, Lord. Oh
[56:01] God, we pray, Lord, be lifted up, Lord.
[56:04] be lifted up in every situation, in
[56:06] every heart, in every mind. Be lifted
[56:09] up, Lord. I pray, Father, for you are
[56:11] worthy, Lord. And we ask all these
[56:14] things, Lord, in the precious name of
[56:16] our Lord Jesus Christ. That name that's
[56:19] above every other name, Lord. We ask it
[56:22] all for your glory in the name of Jesus
[56:25] Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you as
[56:28] you're being seated.
[56:32] Amen.
[56:35] I want to to just speak here just a few
[56:38] moments here in this on a public on the
[56:41] reality of redemption
[56:43] because I certainly believe that there
[56:45] is a a real reality and I could say it
[56:48] in this way that there are realities.
[56:51] It's not it's not a a story. It's a
[56:54] reality. There's there all the way
[56:56] through the the Bible. The Bible is the
[56:59] book of redemption. It speaks of
[57:01] redemption. Even as we're reading here
[57:02] with Ruth, what a wonderful love story,
[57:05] but it's deeper than just a love story.
[57:08] It's it's a story of redemption. And
[57:11] God's laid that all the way through all
[57:13] all the way all the way through from uh
[57:15] even from in the beginning. And we see
[57:17] how how Adam how he how he went and he
[57:20] took Eve unto himself. Then we find God
[57:22] coming down making the promise that I
[57:25] you know that I will bring you back. I
[57:27] will make a way. And all of this on and
[57:29] on as we can go. And it all it all
[57:32] speaks within that thought of the book
[57:36] of that of redemption. And I want to
[57:38] just say within this it it had to be as
[57:40] this as the scriptures we read. It had
[57:43] to be a public testimony. And it was
[57:46] that which was you know Boaz never he
[57:50] Boaz never moved around in the scripture
[57:52] and you know actually uh made known his
[57:56] his care and so forth for Ruth. But Ruth
[57:59] she there was a confidence that she was
[58:02] able to have within Boaz because of
[58:05] everything Boaz you know speaking kindly
[58:07] speaking friendly everything that has
[58:09] been done all the way down through
[58:12] leading up to that time. And so, you
[58:15] know, he was he was open as I referred
[58:17] to that of the other kinsmen. He he came
[58:20] right out. It was to the gate which is
[58:21] where all transactions were to be made.
[58:23] He must go to the gate of of his place
[58:26] of of that which was that that it
[58:29] belonged to. And we find that he he laid
[58:32] it all out. But yet remember that other
[58:34] kinsman would not was not willing to do
[58:37] it lest he mar his inheritance. And the
[58:40] prophet tells us he said that of the
[58:42] nearest kinsman we said was the devil.
[58:45] He said and he could not become he said
[58:47] he could not become uh you know that to
[58:50] take away our our sin because he already
[58:52] was the devil. But there had to be one
[58:55] that was able to come and to stand in on
[58:58] our behalf an innocent one that would
[59:01] actually take and pay the price. And so
[59:04] just like Boaz, everything was was out
[59:06] was out and declared within the open,
[59:09] God himself when God came down among us
[59:12] and and to redeem us, God had already
[59:15] gave witness of this, showing it in type
[59:19] also expressed through the prophets, God
[59:21] would express through them. And he laid
[59:24] all of it out. And it was God coming in
[59:26] the fulfillment of his word with one
[59:28] purpose in mind. And that was
[59:31] redemption. He submitted himself to pay
[59:34] the price because remember this this
[59:36] this redeemer, this kinsman redeemer not
[59:39] only must be a worthy man. He must be
[59:42] financially able, he must be able to to
[59:45] satisfy the debt. All of these things
[59:48] had had to come in and most importantly
[59:50] he had to be willing to do it. And so
[59:53] within the willingness to do it, we find
[59:55] that God himself even coming down to
[59:59] become one of us. It was all part of the
[1:00:01] plan. Before there was Adam, dust, star
[1:00:03] or molecule, the the plan of redemption
[1:00:05] was already laid within the mind of God.
[1:00:08] And this is where we can see that when
[1:00:10] we look clear back in Revelations 13:8
[1:00:12] where it says the lamb was slain in the
[1:00:15] mind of God before the foundation of the
[1:00:17] world. And this is why that when Isaiah
[1:00:19] was caught in caught up in the spirit in
[1:00:21] Isaiah 53, he speaks and utters the
[1:00:25] words that will we will see fulfilled at
[1:00:27] Calvary, but he speaks of it not in
[1:00:29] something that will be, but he says he
[1:00:32] was bruised
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; for our for our uh iniquities. He was he
[1:00:37] was wounded for our our transgression.
[1:00:39] He speaks in past tense because in God's
[1:00:42] mind, it's already a finished work. So
[1:00:45] he's caught up into that which you know
[1:00:48] it would not be a prophet doesn't utter
[1:00:50] their own words. But a prophet is a
[1:00:53] mouthpiece of God. A prophet is actually
[1:00:56] that with a gift within the life that
[1:00:58] God will actually bring that prophet in
[1:01:01] into the channels of of his word of his
[1:01:04] thought. And he's not actually speaking
[1:01:06] something that is is is is new or hasn't
[1:01:10] been spoken but he's caught. and to be
[1:01:12] able to hear what God himself has
[1:01:14] already uttered. And so when we
[1:01:17] recognize that this this transaction
[1:01:19] itself in Isaiah 53, it was completely
[1:01:22] fulfilled there at Calvary where where
[1:01:25] when Christ himself like Boaz kicked off
[1:01:28] and took off his shoe, the prophet tells
[1:01:30] us that how that the Lord Jesus, he
[1:01:32] kicked off his righteousness. He laid
[1:01:35] aside his splendor, laid aside his glory
[1:01:38] in order to pay that price of redemption
[1:01:41] for you and I. And brother Ram says it
[1:01:43] like this. He says, "When this great
[1:01:44] Boaz redeemed her, he had to make a
[1:01:47] public showing that he had redeemed all
[1:01:50] of her lost estate." So he went to the
[1:01:53] gate of Bethlehem, that little city
[1:01:54] again, and he called the elders of the
[1:01:56] city, and he let them know that day that
[1:01:58] he had bought everything that Naomi had
[1:02:00] lost. Everything that she lost, he
[1:02:03] bought it back. He kicked off his shoe
[1:02:06] and threw it up before the people as an
[1:02:08] in sign. And if there's anyone, this is
[1:02:11] what was being said. If there's anyone
[1:02:13] has any reason to say something, say it
[1:02:16] now. For this is a memorial that I've
[1:02:19] redeemed everything that she lost.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; So they're given the witnesses are given
[1:02:24] an opportunity. I anyone else can you
[1:02:27] say anything? Because once this
[1:02:29] transaction has been completed, then
[1:02:32] every other voice is silenced.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Because what what what has happened, the
[1:02:38] transaction has already spoken. It
[1:02:40] doesn't matter what kind of claim comes
[1:02:41] out. It doesn't matter what comes after
[1:02:43] that. It's already been a public
[1:02:46] testimony and the transaction has
[1:02:48] already been made. Oh my. And look at
[1:02:51] this. He goes on as he's telling us
[1:02:53] about this this public in sign that was
[1:02:56] made there at Calvary. And he says a
[1:02:59] public in sign was made at Calvary that
[1:03:01] I've redeemed the whole human race and
[1:03:04] everything that they ever lost. He
[1:03:06] redeemed our soul, redeemed our body,
[1:03:10] redeemed everything that we lost in the
[1:03:12] fall. Our kinsman redeemer came and was
[1:03:15] made flesh and dwelt among us and
[1:03:17] offered up the inside and said, "It's
[1:03:20] finished." Right.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; What's finished? Everything is finished.
[1:03:24] We're just walking right into our
[1:03:26] inheritance. And as the days go on,
[1:03:29] we're walking closer and closer.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Now, we recognize that we, as Paul would
[1:03:35] write in Romans chapter 8, that we are
[1:03:37] waiting for that redemption of the body.
[1:03:41] We receive that that that redemption by
[1:03:45] the spirit of God coming in to our lives
[1:03:48] and laying hold upon that part that
[1:03:51] belongs to him and and the spirit of God
[1:03:54] coming to make redemption a reality by
[1:03:57] the spirit of God coming into our lives
[1:03:59] to bring that to a personal revelation.
[1:04:02] Because remember, it's not a group
[1:04:04] revelation. It's not a church
[1:04:06] revelation. It's not a family
[1:04:08] revelation. It's an individual
[1:04:10] revelation. we that it must be a
[1:04:13] personal revelation between God and you
[1:04:17] that he was wounded for my
[1:04:20] transgressions that if it hadn't been
[1:04:22] nobody else he was coming for me because
[1:04:24] I always belong to him you see in order
[1:04:27] this is the thing in order to redeem
[1:04:30] redeem itself means I am taking back
[1:04:33] into my possession what is rightfully
[1:04:36] mine and is always belong to mine belong
[1:04:39] to me that's what redemption is. So when
[1:04:43] when we understand that, that's the
[1:04:44] whole part that's been laid all the way
[1:04:46] down through scripture that we recognize
[1:04:48] it's not a that that redemption is not a
[1:04:50] haphazard event. It's not a a by chance,
[1:04:53] but remember that that the son of man is
[1:04:55] come, the scripture said, to seek and
[1:04:57] save that which was lost. So if we're
[1:05:00] lost at one time we were found, we at
[1:05:02] one time where we were, now he's come to
[1:05:04] bring us back to where we always were
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; as sons and daughters of God. Now when
[1:05:10] you think of this, we we are redeemed as
[1:05:13] I read that there in the scripture in
[1:05:15] our text in wrote in Ruth chapter 4 in
[1:05:18] our text and brother Ram says it like
[1:05:20] this because when we think about this
[1:05:22] and in looking at this testimony and
[1:05:24] he's talking about how that you know
[1:05:26] within this testimony of us being
[1:05:29] redeemed, how a redeemer redeems us
[1:05:32] completely. Now, let me just say it like
[1:05:34] this. With him making a public
[1:05:36] testimony, if he was willing to make a
[1:05:39] public testimony, then you know that
[1:05:41] brings you and I to a place that you and
[1:05:44] I must also have a public testimony. And
[1:05:48] that public testimony itself is not us
[1:05:50] dying for our sins, but it is dying to
[1:05:54] self. I want to let me just read just a
[1:05:56] few scriptures here in in Mark chapter
[1:05:59] 8. I'm just going to read them. You can
[1:06:00] listen. Jesus himself spoke more of our
[1:06:04] cross than he did his own cross. He
[1:06:07] said, "Whosoever will come after me, let
[1:06:09] him deny himself and take up his cross
[1:06:12] and follow me."
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; So a cross itself, it is a dying to
[1:06:17] self. He goes on to say over and over,
[1:06:20] "Whosoever shall keep his life, he'll
[1:06:23] lose it. But whoever is willing to lose
[1:06:25] it or surrender or give his life shall
[1:06:28] find it." Because you see this life is
[1:06:31] not really about this life. This life is
[1:06:34] about making preparation for that which
[1:06:37] is to come.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; So then this is where Jesus would say
[1:06:41] whosoever when he would say what will
[1:06:43] man give in exchange for his soul. He
[1:06:45] says in Mark 8:38, "Whosoever therefore
[1:06:48] shall be ashamed of me, and my words in
[1:06:50] this adulterous and sinful generation,
[1:06:53] of him also shall the son of man be
[1:06:56] ashamed when he cometh in the glory of
[1:06:58] his father with the holy angels." Let me
[1:07:01] just say it like this. But Ruth,
[1:07:03] remember it was Ruth who made the
[1:07:05] approach to Boaz and said, "Thou art a
[1:07:09] near kinsman. I am Ruth, thine
[1:07:11] handmade." You see, if you don't want to
[1:07:13] be identified with God, God's not going
[1:07:15] to come and be identified with you. But
[1:07:17] you you have to want to want you have to
[1:07:20] welcome him. You have to invite him. You
[1:07:23] have to want to be identified with him.
[1:07:25] And you say, "Well, how is that
[1:07:26] displayed in my life?" Well, when our
[1:07:28] heart is turned and it's beginning to
[1:07:31] turn, it's taking the word of God and
[1:07:33] applying it to our life. You see, this
[1:07:35] is why that an individual cannot just
[1:07:37] say, well, you know, I'm just going to
[1:07:39] wait till the Holy Ghost comes and when
[1:07:40] the Holy Spirit comes, you know, he'll
[1:07:42] just do everything for me. Jesus said,
[1:07:44] if you love me, you keep my words. And
[1:07:47] if you and if you keep my words, then we
[1:07:50] will come and make our abode in you. You
[1:07:54] see, the word the word going forth makes
[1:07:57] a way for him who is the word to come
[1:08:00] and dwell in the midst of our life. It's
[1:08:03] true. the Holy Spirit coming. We need
[1:08:05] the Holy Ghost. That's what changes and
[1:08:08] changes the desires of our life. Is that
[1:08:11] right? But to understand we've got there
[1:08:13] has to be an approach to want to be
[1:08:16] identified with him. Listen friends,
[1:08:18] this is where it comes down. If he was
[1:08:20] willing to be identified with us, then I
[1:08:23] think with everything within us, we
[1:08:25] should want to be identified with him. I
[1:08:27] I I want to be identified with this
[1:08:30] message. And I I'm not talking about
[1:08:31] carrying around a picture cuz that's not
[1:08:33] the identification we're talking about.
[1:08:35] I'm not talking about a bumper sticker.
[1:08:37] I'm not even talking about being a part
[1:08:39] of a church. Yet, we believe in being a
[1:08:41] part and assembling together. But I'm
[1:08:43] talking about where his life is inside
[1:08:46] of you because that's the only thing
[1:08:48] that God's going to recognize. That's
[1:08:50] the only thing that's going in the
[1:08:51] rapture is where there's a public
[1:08:53] testimony that what he did on Calvary,
[1:08:56] the effects and the victory of it are
[1:08:59] manifested through your life. That you
[1:09:02] are identified with him. And it's not
[1:09:04] something you have to tell to somebody,
[1:09:06] but you're identified in the way that we
[1:09:08] live. This is why the prophet said it's
[1:09:11] come to such a place of a confession.
[1:09:13] I'm a Methodist. I'm a Pentecostal. I'm
[1:09:15] a Baptist. It's got to be deeper than
[1:09:17] just saying saying a phrase. It's got to
[1:09:20] be a life on the inside. The Bible tells
[1:09:23] us that when Peter and James was there
[1:09:26] and the Bible says they took knowledge
[1:09:28] that they had been with Jesus. It wasn't
[1:09:31] that they were had the walk or the tilt
[1:09:33] or the everything. It wasn't a physical
[1:09:36] impression. They had been with Jesus.
[1:09:39] There had been an experience and that
[1:09:41] same life had come on the inside of them
[1:09:44] and they were identified by his presence
[1:09:47] and his word living out through their
[1:09:49] lives. That's the greatest
[1:09:51] identification. I tell you the greatest
[1:09:53] thing that we could be known by is to be
[1:09:55] a believer is to be a Christian where
[1:09:57] others can say even here in the assembly
[1:10:00] and everywhere we go that's a real
[1:10:02] genuine believer. That's a real
[1:10:04] Christian. to be identified with Jesus
[1:10:07] Christ, that is a real public testimony.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; So, it ain't something that that we want
[1:10:13] to hide. You know, that's why that that
[1:10:15] within it if someone says, "Well, you
[1:10:17] know, you know, I I want to be a
[1:10:19] Christian, but you know, in the
[1:10:20] workplace, then then you haven't went
[1:10:21] deep enough yet
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; because you're still ashamed of him."
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Well, my associates, you're still
[1:10:27] ashamed of him. You got to go deeper.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; You got to come to that place to where
[1:10:32] you are not ashamed to be identified
[1:10:34] with him. When a person gives their life
[1:10:36] to the Lord, the first thing they're to
[1:10:38] do, the Bible even says that we are to
[1:10:41] confess with our mouth. If you it should
[1:10:44] not be anything in a life that would be
[1:10:46] ashamed to confess, I have been saved.
[1:10:48] Let me tell you, you want your old
[1:10:50] associates to run away. You say, "Well,
[1:10:52] brother Samuel, they might be se, but
[1:10:54] I'm not going to try to keep them around
[1:10:57] by compromising with them. Neither am I
[1:10:59] going to bash them, but I'm going to let
[1:11:01] them know that there is a work that is
[1:11:03] taking place in my life. You You want to
[1:11:06] know how to apply the word? You want to
[1:11:08] know how to be identified with him?
[1:11:11] You've got to stand for him.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; I am a Christian. I am a believer.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Brother, let me tell you what'll happen.
[1:11:20] You ever you ever turn the lights on? I
[1:11:22] remember when I, you know, when I was a
[1:11:24] a senior in high school and I stayed
[1:11:26] over a person's house. I'd never seen
[1:11:28] roaches before in my life and we went
[1:11:30] down there. We went down there in the
[1:11:32] middle of the night and turned on the
[1:11:33] the light. I didn't know what in the
[1:11:35] world that was. That that gave me the
[1:11:36] heebie-jebies for the rest of the night.
[1:11:40] Brother Samuel, what are you saying? I'm
[1:11:42] trying to tell you when you begin to
[1:11:44] identify with the word of God, you don't
[1:11:47] have to worry about all of these
[1:11:49] separation here. When the light comes
[1:11:51] on, the roaches will head for darkness.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; But it depends how bad. Do you want to
[1:11:58] be identified with him?
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, so and so leave me. So and so leave
[1:12:03] me. Don't let don't let that's fear. But
[1:12:05] you got to keep your eyes. Remember
[1:12:07] friends, it keep your eyes on Jesus
[1:12:10] Christ. It means more than anything else
[1:12:13] to be identified with him. And you get
[1:12:16] to that place that I want to be
[1:12:17] identified with him and standing in a
[1:12:19] public testimony that Christ himself is
[1:12:22] the one who places his life inside of
[1:12:25] you.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Because remember Christianity the
[1:12:30] prophet said it has to show wherever it
[1:12:33] goes.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; It shows in public life. It shows at the
[1:12:37] office. Shows on the street when
[1:12:39] trouble's around. Anything. He said in
[1:12:42] church, everywhere else. The blood is a
[1:12:44] token. It shows
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; and the church said
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we find that we want to
[1:12:52] be we want to be identified with him. So
[1:12:55] in this redeeming and and the reality of
[1:12:58] redemption the prophet goes on in the
[1:13:00] kinsman redeemer and this is where I
[1:13:02] drawn from here. He says, "Now they
[1:13:04] gotten married and and through that Boaz
[1:13:06] and Ruth through this great thing, then
[1:13:09] Ruth was rewarded by getting Boaz for
[1:13:12] her husband."
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That That's how we're
[1:13:16] rewarded.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; I I don't want just an anointing.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; I don't want a feeling.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? And we we want to be
[1:13:25] united with Christ himself to where our
[1:13:27] lives are anointed with the word. And
[1:13:30] what comes out of our lives is an amen
[1:13:33] to the word of God.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Notice the church is
[1:13:38] rewarded when the coming of the Lord
[1:13:40] shall come on that bright and cloudless
[1:13:42] morning. We're resting, waiting now. It
[1:13:46] shall come. It it's redeemed. And he
[1:13:49] goes on and in this in this statement,
[1:13:51] brother Ram goes into and he says he he
[1:13:53] makes a pause and he deals with the
[1:13:55] Armenian brother. Now those of you as
[1:13:57] message believers know that brother
[1:13:58] Brandon when he preaches that of the
[1:14:00] Hebrew series, he preaches in the
[1:14:02] adoption series. I mean, even when he
[1:14:04] gets into the Holy Ghost series, you'll
[1:14:06] hardly find too many times that he don't
[1:14:09] come in and deal with the Armenian
[1:14:11] doctrine that would be around because
[1:14:13] there the the Armenian, remember, Calvin
[1:14:15] goes clear out one way and Armenian goes
[1:14:18] clear out another way. But there is a
[1:14:19] truth in the middle of the road and and
[1:14:21] that takes Christ to bring that back in.
[1:14:24] We know that it's not works that saves
[1:14:26] us. And neither is it clear out here.
[1:14:28] Well, you know, it just, you know, one
[1:14:30] just just eternal security. There's a
[1:14:32] truth to eternal security and we're
[1:14:34] going to deal with that here this
[1:14:34] morning. There's a real reality of that
[1:14:38] within of redemption to where a person
[1:14:42] can come to a place in God, he can never
[1:14:45] ever be lost again.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There is a place. It's like
[1:14:51] you know you uh uh you know when they
[1:14:53] come on on a plane and and uh brother uh
[1:14:56] T Osbborne referred to that when he was
[1:14:58] uh standing there and the Godhead
[1:15:00] explained he said to think of it he said
[1:15:02] here we've had these times where you can
[1:15:03] go across the ocean and finally the
[1:15:06] pilot will come across on that plane and
[1:15:09] say now we have reached the point of no
[1:15:12] return. And that that whole statement
[1:15:14] means we're closer to our destination
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; than where we started.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; And that's how it is when the Holy
[1:15:24] Spirit has come into that life and
[1:15:26] baptizing with the Holy Ghost, the seal
[1:15:29] of the living God. It's a point
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; of no return.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Did you know why you have no desire to
[1:15:36] return?
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; You have no desire to to live and and to
[1:15:40] be in that of the world. you've reached
[1:15:42] a point of no return.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Now, this brother Ran would pick this up
[1:15:48] and he's referring to the word
[1:15:50] redemption. And he's going into this
[1:15:53] this in the scripture here of how of
[1:15:56] what the reward redemption. He says when
[1:15:58] you look it up and I I've studied this
[1:16:00] before and I've got the three words that
[1:16:02] are here before me, but when we look at
[1:16:04] this with redemption because with
[1:16:07] redemption it is there's three words.
[1:16:09] The first word in referring to
[1:16:12] redemption is where a slave or one is
[1:16:16] the purchase is made in the market in a
[1:16:19] public place. So the purchase is made
[1:16:22] publicly. The second part within that of
[1:16:25] redemption is to buy it out of the
[1:16:28] market. So not only is the purchase
[1:16:31] made, but when it is bought out of the
[1:16:34] market a deeper meaning and redemption,
[1:16:36] it means that what has been bought out
[1:16:38] of the market can never be sold again.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; And the third part to that is to loose
[1:16:47] or to set free through the paying of
[1:16:50] that price. So redemption is by
[1:16:53] sacrifice and power. And Christ paid the
[1:16:56] price and the Holy Spirit makes
[1:16:59] deliverance an actual experience. Is
[1:17:02] that right?
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Romans 8. Now notice, brother Ram picks
[1:17:06] this up and he says, now he says, "And
[1:17:08] that slave," he said, I I want you to
[1:17:10] catch this. He said, "And that slave
[1:17:12] once he's been redeemed can never be
[1:17:14] sold in the market again." Can never be
[1:17:18] sold again. He's marked. So he can never
[1:17:21] come back into what he was in slavery
[1:17:24] to. He He can never be sold into that
[1:17:26] again because he's been bought out of it
[1:17:29] and he's marked.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; My my my. And if he was thought of
[1:17:33] enough one time to be redeemed, no one
[1:17:37] can never sell him again for a slave.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; So his life is unsellable. It's the the
[1:17:45] the transaction has been made. He was
[1:17:48] once a slave. He was sold into slavery.
[1:17:50] You and I were sold into sin by the
[1:17:53] first parents.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Come on now. We were sold into sin. But
[1:17:58] there came one just as one represented
[1:18:00] us. The Bible tells us in Romans unto
[1:18:03] disobedience and that fell upon man. But
[1:18:06] there was one who represented us in
[1:18:09] obedience. One who became our
[1:18:11] propituation, our kinsman, redeemer. And
[1:18:14] he paid the price that you and I can go
[1:18:17] free. And the Holy Spirit makes it real
[1:18:20] to you that the marketplace, what was
[1:18:23] purchased, he did it for you. And when
[1:18:26] the Holy Spirit brings that message in a
[1:18:28] personal way to your heart and seals
[1:18:31] you, you can never never be put back on
[1:18:35] the market again.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Boo devil.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, thanks be to God. When a man has
[1:18:47] come to Christ and been redeemed by the
[1:18:50] precious blood, the devil can never make
[1:18:52] you a slave again.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; You're secure in the blood of Jesus
[1:18:57] Christ until the day of your redemption.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Oh, thanks be to the
[1:19:05] Lord. We've been redeemed.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a reality of redemption
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; that strikes into our heart. You know
[1:19:13] what it does? It takes you from looking
[1:19:15] over your shoulder. You see, it's not
[1:19:17] about our works. It's not about how much
[1:19:19] I can maintain. When Christ has come
[1:19:22] into your life and changed your nature
[1:19:24] and your desire, you are God's free man.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; You're no longer in slavery. It isn't
[1:19:32] you laying things down. They quit you.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; I never quit smoking. It quit me. I
[1:19:40] never quit drinking. It quit me. That's
[1:19:42] right.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; All these other things. It wasn't what I
[1:19:45] quit. It quit me. When Christ came in to
[1:19:48] our lives.
[1:19:50] [Applause]
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, redemption is not just
[1:19:54] coming to church. Redemption is about
[1:19:56] getting underneath the blood
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; where there's security where Satan can
[1:20:02] no longer touch you.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Samuel, he can touch my
[1:20:08] flesh only if he gets permission. All
[1:20:11] right.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Only Well, he can touch my spirit only
[1:20:16] if he gets permission.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know why? We've been
[1:20:22] taken out of his grip.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Take your hands off of God's property.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; We were always God's property.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; And that's why the Holy Spirit has come
[1:20:33] to enforce the claim.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Give it back.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. So it's a perfect
[1:20:39] loosening through the perfect blood.
[1:20:43] This is why that when we read in
[1:20:45] Revelations 1 uh verse 1 through verse 6
[1:20:49] and the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[1:20:52] God gave unto him to show unto his
[1:20:55] servants things which must shortly come
[1:20:57] to pass. He sent and signified it by his
[1:20:59] angel unto his servant John. Jesus
[1:21:02] Christ revealed himself personally to
[1:21:05] John. And John is a type of the
[1:21:08] believer.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Right? Remember John was the one that
[1:21:13] was spoke of what is it to thee if he
[1:21:15] tried till I come
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; and there went out of sight.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; This man's not going to die until he
[1:21:21] returned. Misunderstanding.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; They did not understand. But what what
[1:21:25] Jesus was speaking of is the is the
[1:21:27] testimony of the coming of the Lord, the
[1:21:31] Holy Spirit in in after Calvary and
[1:21:35] coming to bring to himself all of his
[1:21:38] redeemed subject or those that he has
[1:21:41] already paid the price for. And he would
[1:21:43] show them that. And listen, that's the
[1:21:45] same thing the revelation of Jesus
[1:21:48] Christ is to you and I. It's the coming
[1:21:50] of the Lord in our life.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:53] It's a ceasing of us.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; And that's that's the that this is now a
[1:21:58] new beginning. This is now where that
[1:22:00] life begins to live. That was there the
[1:22:02] whole time. And with that coming into
[1:22:04] our life makes us and places us into the
[1:22:07] coming of the Lord that we are looking
[1:22:09] and living for the coming of the Lord.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, so it's a perfect loosening through
[1:22:17] the perfect blood. It it had to be that
[1:22:20] of of his own blood. This is why when
[1:22:22] the scripture said in verse 5 of
[1:22:24] Revelations 1, "And from Jesus Christ,
[1:22:27] who is the faithful witness and the
[1:22:29] first begotten of the dead and the
[1:22:31] prince of the kings of the earth unto
[1:22:33] him that loved us and washed us from our
[1:22:38] sins in his own blood." Oh my glory. I
[1:22:44] love how the prophet said, "Did you
[1:22:46] catch that?" He said it was in his own
[1:22:49] blood. Amen.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Now, God is a spirit, right?
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; But God created a blood cell because he
[1:22:56] could not take you could take the most
[1:22:58] righteous man that was here. He was
[1:23:01] still not worthy or able to redeem you
[1:23:04] and I. God had it placed in such a way
[1:23:08] that there was no one could come down
[1:23:10] and redeem us but God himself.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; But a spirit can't die. But God created
[1:23:16] a body, a tabernacle, a tent. Paul said
[1:23:19] that he pinched that he might come down
[1:23:22] and dwell with us and redeem you and I
[1:23:25] through him by the shedding of his
[1:23:26] blood. Pay the price in the market.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Holy Spirit bring that
[1:23:33] loosening into our life and we can never
[1:23:36] ever be slaves again.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a reality friends.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; But God becoming one of us. God created
[1:23:49] his own blood.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; We call it the blood of Christ in one
[1:23:52] place, the blood of the Lord in another.
[1:23:54] It's all one God.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; I It's not three persons.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Satan has told that lie.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; That's a doctrine of devils.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; It because the whole purpose is God
[1:24:09] coming down to become one of us that he
[1:24:12] might impart his life into you and I. He
[1:24:16] did not look when when the fall took
[1:24:17] place in Eden. He didn't send somebody
[1:24:19] else. He came himself.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; When news came to glory, the fall took
[1:24:24] place. He didn't go send somebody. There
[1:24:26] was nobody else to send. He came
[1:24:28] himself.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; God was showing that he was the one. As
[1:24:32] a matter of fact, the prophet said he
[1:24:34] did not trust this plan of salvation
[1:24:37] into no one else's hands.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my. To think of the blood. Oh my.
[1:24:43] Brother Ram says, "Consider this. Since
[1:24:45] it is the blood of God, it is perfect
[1:24:48] blood. If the perfect blood is loosing
[1:24:52] us from the power and bondage and
[1:24:55] defilement of sin, then the loosening is
[1:24:59] perfect and complete. There is now
[1:25:03] therefore no condemnation. And I love
[1:25:06] how he picks this scripture up. Who
[1:25:08] shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:25:11] God's elect? Right.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; That's a bold statement.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Who can lay anything to the charge of
[1:25:18] God's elect? You know what Paul, what
[1:25:19] what is Paul looking at? Paul has that
[1:25:21] revelation of the righteousness of God,
[1:25:24] of the perfection of the blood of Jesus
[1:25:27] Christ, that through that blood. Let me
[1:25:29] tell you, if the Red Sea was a type,
[1:25:31] which it was, it there was not an
[1:25:33] Egyptian that could make it through that
[1:25:35] Red Sea and that was only a type. Let me
[1:25:37] tell you, when sin has been confessed,
[1:25:41] it cannot make it through the bleach. It
[1:25:45] can't make it through the blood.
[1:25:48] The blood takes care of sin and
[1:25:50] dismantles it and puts it back on the
[1:25:53] accuser, the one who is really guilty in
[1:25:56] the first place.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Who shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:26:00] God's elect? It is God that justifith
[1:26:04] declares us righteous. Who is he that
[1:26:06] condemnth? It is Christ that died. There
[1:26:09] it is. His death gave us the blood. The
[1:26:12] blood has loosed us. There is no
[1:26:14] condemnation. How can there be? There is
[1:26:17] nothing to be condemned for because the
[1:26:20] blood has loosed us from sin. We are
[1:26:24] free guiltless. Listen now. Don't listen
[1:26:27] to man. Listen to the word. You are
[1:26:30] loosed by the blood.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't glad this last part in,
[1:26:36] but it goes right at right after this.
[1:26:38] The prophet said, "Don't get tied down
[1:26:40] again by traditions and creeds and
[1:26:44] organizations. Don't be led astray by
[1:26:47] listening to those that deny the power
[1:26:49] of the word and deny that Jesus saves,
[1:26:52] heals, fills with the Holy Ghost and
[1:26:53] power. You are God's free men, loosed by
[1:26:57] his own blood. If you still hold to your
[1:26:59] faith to creeds and denominations, it's
[1:27:01] certain by the evidence that you've lost
[1:27:03] your faith in the word of God. So don't
[1:27:06] don't lay the word down for anything.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; When a priest when they would when when
[1:27:14] the sacrifice would be made even in that
[1:27:16] time of the atonement and then that of
[1:27:19] the jubilee coming on, remember the
[1:27:21] priest itself, there were those that was
[1:27:23] in the fields. They weren't down there
[1:27:25] to see the blood being shed. They
[1:27:27] weren't down there when when everything
[1:27:28] was being offered up. They were not down
[1:27:30] there. But when that came of the
[1:27:32] Jubilee, the priests would ride
[1:27:34] throughout the land and sound a trumpet.
[1:27:38] And the trumpet was to announce that the
[1:27:41] Jubilee is on.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; You you you don't have to even go hang
[1:27:44] up that that that hole. You don't even
[1:27:46] go have to go hang up that shovel. You
[1:27:48] don't have to go hang it up. Drop it.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; You're free.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; You understand, friends? You know, it's
[1:27:55] not about what, oh, I'm going to I'm
[1:27:57] going to get good enough or I'm going to
[1:27:58] get. It's lay it down. Let faith say,
[1:28:01] "Oh, God, let let faith rise within our
[1:28:04] hearts this morning to recognize that it
[1:28:06] is already conquered. Every sin, every
[1:28:10] sickness, every situation has already
[1:28:13] been defeated. He don't have to come
[1:28:15] back and make another public testimony.
[1:28:18] It's already been done.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; But you've got to be willing to lay it
[1:28:23] down. Amen.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Is it that simple? It's that simple.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; You say, "How do I get the authority to
[1:28:35] lay it down?" By believing what he said.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; And you've got to let that bypass your
[1:28:40] mind as far as your reasoning channels.
[1:28:43] You've got to accept it and agree with
[1:28:45] that word above your own thoughts.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That man, when he threw that
[1:28:51] down, he didn't have to do nothing. It
[1:28:53] was an act of God that he was restored
[1:28:55] back by.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; This is why the scripture could say in
[1:28:58] the book of Romans of how beautiful are
[1:29:01] the feet of them that that preach the
[1:29:05] gospel of peace and bring glad tidings
[1:29:08] of good things.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, it wouldn't be money.
[1:29:12] It wouldn't be peace and good things if
[1:29:14] it's just coming to tell me that well,
[1:29:16] you know, you just try harder.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Be a do better, a try harder. That ain't
[1:29:22] what the gospel says. The gospel is a
[1:29:25] jubilee trumpet. The gospel is a sound
[1:29:28] of certainty. The gospel is to let you
[1:29:30] know your rights and don't live beneath
[1:29:33] your rights as a son and daughter of
[1:29:35] God.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, this has been through my family for
[1:29:38] so long. But what family are we going to
[1:29:40] talk about? Are we going to talk about
[1:29:41] your natural family or are we talking
[1:29:43] about the family of God?
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. Here we are living in
[1:29:48] this body right here. But when the Holy
[1:29:50] Spirit begins to sound in our heart,
[1:29:53] there is a greater identification. There
[1:29:56] is a greater power and authority to come
[1:29:58] into our life that lifts us above the
[1:30:01] holds of the strains from our natural
[1:30:04] family tree.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; My goodness. My goodness.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; No wonder Isaiah could say how
[1:30:13] beautiful. Same scripture. Upon the
[1:30:15] mountains are the feet of him that
[1:30:16] bringeth good things, that publisheth
[1:30:18] peace, that bringeth good tidings of
[1:30:20] good, that publisheth salvation, that
[1:30:23] saith unto Zion, "Thy God reignth."
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; You see, it's like like brother Bram
[1:30:30] likens it to taking an old sheet or a
[1:30:32] sheet that's dirty. And every one of us
[1:30:34] know, you know, you get you get stuff on
[1:30:36] your clothes and whether brother Bam
[1:30:38] used example of a sheet here and you
[1:30:41] know you got you know you got something
[1:30:43] in there that needs to be taken out.
[1:30:45] It's it's it's a spot. Maybe you got up
[1:30:47] this morning here you put your your t
[1:30:49] your shirt on or ah you went to
[1:30:52] breakfast you got egg all over your
[1:30:53] shirt or or something and you know
[1:30:54] you're oh man I got coffee on this and
[1:30:57] and and and you realize that that you've
[1:30:59] got to get that treated. you know that
[1:31:01] there's a stain that's on that and
[1:31:02] you're not going to wear that stain. I
[1:31:04] don't think anybody that would probably
[1:31:05] be at home still would say, "I'll just
[1:31:07] go ahead and wear it, man. I'll just,
[1:31:09] you know, I'll just cover up the stain."
[1:31:10] I mean, I guess depends on where it's
[1:31:11] at. But at somewhere, at some point in
[1:31:14] time, you're going to have to deal with
[1:31:15] that stain.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; You see, God doesn't want us hiding.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; But he wants to hide us.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; But he's not trying to hide our sin. He
[1:31:26] wants to deal with it.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; You see what he's doing? The enemy wants
[1:31:30] to put shame and condemnation and drive
[1:31:33] people back. That's why Adam was hiding
[1:31:35] in the beginning. But the Holy Spirit is
[1:31:37] here to call us out to expose the enemy.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Let's let's let's expose him. Let let's
[1:31:44] lay it out there so that God can deal
[1:31:46] with it. That way we don't have to walk
[1:31:48] around with shame and and and you know
[1:31:50] and and and and under condemnation. God
[1:31:53] has come to deal with the issue.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:31:57] I hope you're with me now.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; I'm You say, "What kind of issue?" I'm
[1:32:01] talking about more than stacking good
[1:32:03] days together. I'm talking about more
[1:32:05] than stacking good months together or
[1:32:06] good weeks or good years. I'm talking
[1:32:08] about something that deals with more
[1:32:11] than all of the good days, weeks,
[1:32:13] months, years that we can have. I'm
[1:32:15] talking about where you can walk with a
[1:32:17] freedom and a liberty that you know that
[1:32:20] my sins are gone, that my desire has
[1:32:23] been changed, my life is no longer the
[1:32:26] same. And there is no fear for the
[1:32:28] enemy.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Samuel, that's a bold
[1:32:32] statement. Either the blood works or it
[1:32:34] doesn't.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Either it's the perfect blood or it's
[1:32:38] not.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; You see, if it's any other gospel, it
[1:32:41] doesn't bring the certainty to a to a
[1:32:44] son and daughter of God that they can
[1:32:46] stand like a son and daughter of God.
[1:32:48] I'm not talking about arrogancy. I'm
[1:32:50] talking about knowing what your
[1:32:51] God-given rights. I'm talking about
[1:32:53] knowing what belongs to you and not
[1:32:55] taking no slack from the devil.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; That's why when we look at this old
[1:33:03] sheet, you know, there's nothing the
[1:33:05] prophet said can take it away. But he
[1:33:06] said, you put it in a in a can full of
[1:33:08] Clorox and bring it back out, it's just
[1:33:11] as wide as it can be. That's what the
[1:33:14] blood of Jesus Christ does to the
[1:33:16] believer that confesses
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; his sin.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. When God shakes that
[1:33:22] sheet, sees that it's dried out by the
[1:33:24] winds of the Holy Ghost, oh, he says he
[1:33:26] takes the Holy Spirit and seals it until
[1:33:29] the day of redemption.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Satan can look at that seal. He can
[1:33:33] tease at it, buzz at it, fuss at it, get
[1:33:35] at it. He can't get at it, though,
[1:33:37] because there's a seal of God that
[1:33:39] forbids him. He forbids him to touch it.
[1:33:40] That's God's private property. That's
[1:33:44] what makes man walk boldly.
[1:33:47] They're not scared of backsliding.
[1:33:49] They're not scared of what the devil
[1:33:51] says.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; See, it's Satan's objective
[1:33:56] is to try to hinder that reality of
[1:34:00] redemption
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; and try to try to try to uh cloud over
[1:34:07] on on lives and hearts and and where
[1:34:09] that you know lives when we say, "Well,
[1:34:11] I I don't know exactly where I'm
[1:34:12] standing." Listen, the there's one thing
[1:34:14] that will let you know where you're
[1:34:16] standing and can interpret what he has
[1:34:18] done in your life, and that's the word
[1:34:20] himself.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Nothing else but the word himself.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Is that right? When brother Brandham sat
[1:34:27] down with that that interview with
[1:34:28] Sister Bruce, what was it that
[1:34:30] interpreted her life? It wasn't, Brother
[1:34:31] Brand, it wasn't it wasn't that of a
[1:34:33] prophet looking into her life.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Are y'all with me?
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; If that would have been that way, you
[1:34:40] and I would be asking for that.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:44] True.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; But that didn't happen in that
[1:34:47] interview.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; And as I've told you other times before,
[1:34:50] Sister Bruce didn't request that
[1:34:52] interview. Brother Brandham did.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Cuz he heard Sister Bruce going around
[1:34:55] saying, "I wish I had what you had. I
[1:34:57] wish I had what you had. I wish I had."
[1:34:59] And God was working with her in a
[1:35:02] wonderful way. Same thing for the man
[1:35:04] who came to his house and he had went
[1:35:06] here and you know, they told me if I
[1:35:07] shouted or they told me if I spoke in
[1:35:09] tongues and he said, "I've done all of
[1:35:10] that, brother Brown." But you see, even
[1:35:12] though he already had it, it took the
[1:35:15] word
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; to place him
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; and it gave him rest. Right? That man
[1:35:22] jumped off the front of the porch and
[1:35:23] said to think, "I've been a Christian
[1:35:25] this whole time."
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Don't you see what the prophet was
[1:35:30] saying there? Don't get tied down again
[1:35:32] by the tradition of man.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; God has sent a pure word in this hour.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; A pure language. What language? The Holy
[1:35:41] Ghost divine revelation is the pure
[1:35:44] language.
[1:35:45] [Applause]
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the language that God
[1:35:48] has restored to the church of the living
[1:35:50] God where the spirit of God, the
[1:35:52] quickener of the word is here to make
[1:35:54] that word alive and interpret it and
[1:35:56] bring an understanding to our hearts.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; So, it's the seal. Let's look at this
[1:36:04] here on the seal of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:07] because let me just let me just deal
[1:36:08] with this here just a moment. If you
[1:36:10] look here with turn with me in your
[1:36:11] Bibles to Ephesians chapter 1.
[1:36:15] I want to just I want to just read just
[1:36:16] a couple verses of scripture here and
[1:36:18] then where am I referencing here
[1:36:27] in Ephesians chapter 1
[1:36:30] and let me just read down through
[1:36:33] uh verse six. I we could read it all but
[1:36:36] I I we we I don't have time to read it
[1:36:38] all here. But in verse three of
[1:36:40] Ephesians 1, blessed be the God and
[1:36:42] father of our Lord Jesus Christ. I I
[1:36:45] don't have it on the screen, but who
[1:36:47] hath blessed us with all spiritual
[1:36:49] blessings in heavenly places in Christ?
[1:36:53] According as he hath chosen us in him
[1:36:57] when
[1:36:59] before the foundation of the world
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; that we should be what?
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Holy and without blame before him in
[1:37:08] love. Amen.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Having predestinated us unto the
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:37:15] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:37:18] of his will to the praise of the glory
[1:37:21] of his grace wherein he hath made us
[1:37:26] accepted
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; in the beloved.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Not you made yourself acceptable.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; He made us acceptable. It was him that
[1:37:37] began to deal with our lives that would
[1:37:39] draw upon our hearts and this this is
[1:37:42] being laid aside and this is being laid
[1:37:44] all of those things and and desires
[1:37:46] changing in our life. It's it's his
[1:37:48] working in our life. You say, "Well,
[1:37:50] brother Samuel, what is that?" That's
[1:37:52] called the grace of God. And when the
[1:37:54] grace of God goes to work, works follow
[1:37:58] the grace of God. But they're not works
[1:38:01] that's out of a slavish mentality. But
[1:38:04] they are works from the appreciation in
[1:38:06] our heart for what God's grace has done
[1:38:09] for us.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So it's not works for
[1:38:12] me to obtain a position.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; But when I receive God's grace
[1:38:18] and you know how you know how you accept
[1:38:19] God's grace, accept it.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Accept it.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Ramon goes on to this here
[1:38:28] and I I love this. This is where I I
[1:38:30] want want to read this to you. You're no
[1:38:32] doubt familiar with this, but I love how
[1:38:33] brother Ram will lay this in here,
[1:38:35] adoption part three. I I I'd like to
[1:38:37] read the rest of that chapter, but I I
[1:38:38] just don't have time right now. Brother
[1:38:39] Ram goes on. He says, "Now this master
[1:38:41] teacher Paul, the first thing he does is
[1:38:45] knock out all the idea of falling away.
[1:38:50] Knock out the idea of ever being a
[1:38:53] Christian today and tomorrow I'm gone.
[1:38:56] and the next day God condemned me and
[1:38:59] the next day I'm back again. Brother
[1:39:01] Bram says that's nonsense.
[1:39:06] So the first thing that Paul does under
[1:39:10] the leading of the spirit of God is
[1:39:13] knock trying to knock out of the minds
[1:39:15] of the people that they can be a
[1:39:17] Christian today and lost tomorrow.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; It was brother Sam. Where is he looking
[1:39:23] at? He's looking not only at the
[1:39:25] strength of the blood, but where the
[1:39:27] blood traces clear back to what God
[1:39:29] already before the foundation of the
[1:39:31] world. We were chosen in him. Listen,
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; before the tribes ever received their
[1:39:38] position in the land under Joshua,
[1:39:42] Reuben here,
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Judah here, all of them, remember Joshua
[1:39:46] was called along with Eleazar to divide
[1:39:48] the inheritance, right? Because the
[1:39:49] spirit will always work according to the
[1:39:51] word,
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; right? So before that that that that
[1:39:54] that they were ever upon the earth, the
[1:39:56] birth mothers of those original
[1:39:58] patriarchs were moved upon by the spirit
[1:40:01] of God to utter that name. And that name
[1:40:04] actually represented a place within that
[1:40:08] land. And then when Joshua comes on the
[1:40:11] scene, Joshua doesn't get new
[1:40:13] inspiration. He enters in under the
[1:40:16] original inspiration and places them
[1:40:19] exactly where they belong. And that's
[1:40:21] exactly what the spirit of God does in
[1:40:24] this hour. The inspiration as the Holy
[1:40:27] Spirit is poured out upon the church of
[1:40:30] the living God in this hour. It does not
[1:40:32] position you as a Methodist or position
[1:40:34] you as a Pentecostal. It positions you
[1:40:37] as a son and daughter of God in Jesus
[1:40:41] Christ, your rightful inheritance.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Remember, Jesus never gave you an
[1:40:47] inheritance. He only made a way to bring
[1:40:50] you to your inheritance.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; So coming into that land. Oh my. Now we
[1:40:58] know that Israel that was only that was
[1:41:00] a type. But God would bring us into a
[1:41:03] place because remember God even spoke
[1:41:04] concerning Israel. He speaks of it in
[1:41:06] Exodus 14 through the song of Moses
[1:41:09] speaks of it all the way through that
[1:41:10] God's going to bring Israel to a place
[1:41:11] that they will not be able to fall away
[1:41:13] from.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; And you know what? That's when he,
[1:41:17] the righteousness of God,
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; will step forward for Israel.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Now remember, he he already he revealed
[1:41:24] himself before, but they wouldn't submit
[1:41:26] to his righteousness.
[1:41:28] They just wanted their own.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; What they could do.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; I want to remind you, our righteousness,
[1:41:34] yours, mine is filthy rags in God's
[1:41:36] sight.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; It's got to be It's got to be his
[1:41:40] righteousness.
[1:41:42] his life inside of me, his life inside
[1:41:45] of you. And that's what's speaking out.
[1:41:48] Oh my. But man tells, he said, "Now this
[1:41:51] book is addressed to saints that's
[1:41:52] called, preserved, filled, or set aside
[1:41:54] and are in the Holy Spirit already in
[1:41:56] Canaan's land." Now watch, he's trying
[1:41:58] to tell them the first thing. Get it out
[1:42:01] of your mind
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; that you're going to get lost and you're
[1:42:05] going to do this and you're scared of
[1:42:08] this. Don't be scared of nothing.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; For he's trying to tell you where you're
[1:42:13] at, when you are, how you're standing.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; You ready for the rest of this
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; now? You might do things wrong
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; and every time you do anything wrong,
[1:42:29] you're going to get paid for it.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; You'll reap what you sow, but that has
[1:42:34] not one thing to do with your salvation.
[1:42:37] Amen.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Samuel, my head's spinning.
[1:42:41] Nope. I'm not interested in your head
[1:42:43] spinning. I want this to get to your
[1:42:44] heart.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Because when the desire on the inside
[1:42:49] has changed, you say, "How do I know
[1:42:50] it's been changed? Look at what you
[1:42:52] were. Look at what you are. And look
[1:42:54] when anything comes your way." If
[1:42:57] there's a failure or anything, right
[1:42:59] there, your desire is to do only those
[1:43:01] things that please him. It's that desire
[1:43:03] that pulsates out in your life. Lord,
[1:43:05] forgive me.
[1:43:07] Hallelujah.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's impossible.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Impossible to be lost. Impossible. When
[1:43:16] God has sealed a man like that.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Let me read that one again.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Now, you might do things wrong and every
[1:43:24] time you do anything wrong, you're going
[1:43:25] to get paid for it. You'll reap what you
[1:43:28] sow.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; But that has not one thing to do with
[1:43:30] your salvation. When you're born of the
[1:43:32] spirit of God, you've got eternal life.
[1:43:34] And you can no more die than God can
[1:43:36] die. You're a part of God and you're a
[1:43:38] son of God.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; You might look at that and say, "Man,
[1:43:41] that means I can do whatever." You need
[1:43:43] to hit the altar right now.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Because if you still desire sin,
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; you need the blood to come upon your
[1:43:52] life.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; You need the Holy Spirit that that come
[1:43:56] down into the innermost part of your
[1:43:59] life and change your nature, your
[1:44:01] desire. You know what that does when we
[1:44:03] read things like this? It makes us
[1:44:05] thankful for God's grace.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Because if there's anything, and you
[1:44:10] know how this is, if there's anything at
[1:44:12] all that is taken wrong in your life,
[1:44:14] quickly, quickly, there's something that
[1:44:16] raises up. And like the prophet said in
[1:44:18] the adoption series, he said, "It
[1:44:19] wouldn't matter to you. You got to stand
[1:44:20] in front of the president and say, "I
[1:44:22] was wrong."
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "You'll do it." Why? Because
[1:44:26] you want to be right with God more than
[1:44:27] anything else.
[1:44:30] You know, brother Brandham goes on very
[1:44:32] simple. He said, "I was born a
[1:44:33] Brandham."
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Born to Brandon. He said, "You might."
[1:44:36] He said, "You you can you can do you can
[1:44:38] change my name. I'm still a Brandon. No
[1:44:39] matter how much you change my name," he
[1:44:41] said, "I'm still a brand because I got
[1:44:42] Brandom DNA. I got Brandom blood."
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? He said, "I might be
[1:44:46] disfigured someday, drawn up with
[1:44:48] arthritis, have a wreck, tore up like an
[1:44:50] animal, but I'll still be a Branom."
[1:44:52] Why? Brandom blood is inside me. Right?
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; You see, it don't matter what happens
[1:44:57] even outside of here. It doesn't matter
[1:44:59] even how the enemy can attack the mind.
[1:45:01] Like I I refer to that quote here that
[1:45:03] the prophet speaks. I believe in the
[1:45:05] message testimony. He says there can be
[1:45:07] a fever that can strike your mind and
[1:45:09] fry your brain. But if you've already
[1:45:11] made that decision and Christ has come
[1:45:14] into that innermost part, that man might
[1:45:16] lose his mind, but his soul has already
[1:45:20] been sealed.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. That's the power of
[1:45:25] redemption.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Ram says in the
[1:45:28] demonology series, he said when a man
[1:45:31] has been sealed with the spirit of God,
[1:45:33] he said that man might go completely
[1:45:35] insane, but his soul
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; has already been sealed. And that has
[1:45:40] nothing to do with his soul.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I don't plan
[1:45:45] on going insane. I don't plan on my
[1:45:47] fever on on a fever frying my brain. But
[1:45:49] one thing for sure, I don't know. You
[1:45:51] don't know. We don't have the choice of
[1:45:53] how we'll leave. You say, "I believe
[1:45:54] I'll go in rapture." I do, too. But we
[1:45:56] none of us have the promise of tomorrow.
[1:45:58] But no matter what comes, what's most
[1:46:00] important is is that you can say, "I
[1:46:02] know in whom I have believed, and I am
[1:46:04] persuaded that he is able to keep that
[1:46:07] which I've committed unto him against
[1:46:09] that day." There is a rest.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; I know where I'm going.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:20] Everybody all right?
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; So the seal of the Holy Ghost. Now
[1:46:24] notice this right here. The Bible says
[1:46:26] in Ephesians 1,
[1:46:29] in whom ye also trusted after that ye
[1:46:32] heard the word of truth, the gospel of
[1:46:35] your salvation. So that liberty ringing
[1:46:37] out. In whom also after that you
[1:46:40] believed, you were sealed with the Holy
[1:46:43] Spirit of promise. So believing is not
[1:46:45] the seal, but we must hear the truth.
[1:46:49] And in hearing the truth, it rises to an
[1:46:52] absolute to say that's the truth.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; And and it causes you to let go, sell
[1:46:57] all other things to obtain that pearl of
[1:47:00] great price.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Is that right? It's how the prophet
[1:47:03] taught it there for us. So So it's a
[1:47:06] certainty. It's a sound because you're
[1:47:07] not approached the Holy Spirit or
[1:47:09] approach the gospel with a well, I don't
[1:47:10] know. I you know, I just don't know
[1:47:12] that. That's not certainty. God wants us
[1:47:14] coming with certainty. Can you imagine a
[1:47:16] Can you imagine somebody walking up the
[1:47:17] aisle? And I know this probably has
[1:47:18] happened in the natural where maybe
[1:47:20] there's somebody walking up the aisle
[1:47:21] and here there sure here stands the
[1:47:22] groom and they're like am I doing this?
[1:47:24] Am I doing the right thing? Should I
[1:47:25] not? I mean there no doubt that's
[1:47:26] probably happened in the natural. But
[1:47:28] you see the holy remember God himself
[1:47:31] he's different than that groom that
[1:47:33] stands up here in the natural. He's
[1:47:35] looking down into our heart
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; and he's not going to take advantage of
[1:47:40] us. He's not going to force himself on
[1:47:41] us.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; He's a gentleman.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Is that right? He wants to woo our heart
[1:47:49] to where it's in submission to his will.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; I know sometimes that wooing it might
[1:47:56] take I mean for for maybe for some
[1:47:58] hearts and lives God works on us. Look
[1:48:00] sometimes friends before you ever see
[1:48:02] somebody come in repentance God's
[1:48:04] already been dealing with their life for
[1:48:05] sometimes it's hard to tell how long
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; it might have been days might have been
[1:48:09] weeks might have been months might have
[1:48:10] been even over a course of years.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Right. I know even of some s set s set s
[1:48:15] set s set s set s set s set s set s set
[1:48:15] s set sitting s set s set s set s set s
[1:48:15] set s set s set s set s set s set
[1:48:15] sitting right here of how God has done
[1:48:17] that over a course of time but yet
[1:48:18] nonetheless God was working on their
[1:48:20] life. Notice verse 14 which is this Holy
[1:48:23] Spirit is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:48:26] unto the redemption of the purchased
[1:48:28] possession unto the praise of his glory.
[1:48:32] Now let me just deal with this this seal
[1:48:34] just just three three points here on
[1:48:36] this. It's a finished work.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; It it is finished. There has there has
[1:48:41] come an inspection. It is finished. It's
[1:48:44] it's a work that nothing can be added to
[1:48:47] it or nothing taken away. When the Holy
[1:48:49] Spirit is come upon our life, when he
[1:48:52] has come to seal us, that seal says it
[1:48:56] is finished. In other words, that of
[1:49:00] that redemption of our soul which will
[1:49:03] tie us into the redemption of our body,
[1:49:06] that's already it's a finished work.
[1:49:09] It's just like when you have your token
[1:49:12] like when we were going to Amarillo when
[1:49:14] I fly I fly on Delta. So it's always
[1:49:16] interchanging through Detroit and
[1:49:18] Atlanta or Minneapolis if I'm going to
[1:49:19] Canada. So I always there's different
[1:49:21] interchanges and things you fly to. And
[1:49:23] so when I have that the ticket itself
[1:49:25] that I have whether it's on your phone
[1:49:26] or you have it here that's your token
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; now. You know you're not getting into
[1:49:31] the airport and getting to even through
[1:49:33] security with just money in your hand.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Right. Right?
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; You you have to you have to make the
[1:49:39] purchase,
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; right? And the purchase has to be made
[1:49:43] in order for that token. And you say,
[1:49:44] "Well, how could I purchase the token?"
[1:49:46] Well, it's already been made available
[1:49:48] to you. God wants to give you the Holy
[1:49:50] Ghost more than you want to receive it.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Right? You say, "Well, what's the
[1:49:53] purpose?" What we read in the beginning
[1:49:55] is choosing to be identified with him of
[1:49:57] laying down on our life.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want I I I want to be identified
[1:50:02] with you. But then when you go into
[1:50:04] that, just like when we we took that and
[1:50:06] we we flew from here uh in in into
[1:50:08] Atlanta, you know, all the way. I was
[1:50:10] not worried about, oh, I'm going to get
[1:50:12] stopped in Atlanta. That might be
[1:50:13] fretful, but no, I wasn't going to get
[1:50:15] stopped in Atlanta. I knew that was only
[1:50:17] a a temporary place for me. The next
[1:50:20] stop was going to be not Amarillo, but
[1:50:22] actually Oklahoma City. I knew that was
[1:50:24] going to be the next thing. You know
[1:50:25] why? Cuz the fair had already been paid
[1:50:29] for the full flight.
[1:50:31] And that's how it is in our life when it
[1:50:34] speaks of a finished work. When God
[1:50:36] finishes that work in your life as far
[1:50:39] as that of the new birth and the seal of
[1:50:43] the living God, then it's with you. He's
[1:50:47] taking you to your full destination
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; of what he has ordained what you are to
[1:50:53] be.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; You're a son and daughter of God right
[1:50:56] now. So that means every every stop, you
[1:50:58] know, sometimes you you don't know you
[1:50:59] you can get into a a place like, you
[1:51:01] know, here we were coming back, man. Got
[1:51:03] delayed out there Oklahoma City, praying
[1:51:05] I was going to get delayed in Atlanta.
[1:51:07] We did. Got back, you know, maybe about
[1:51:08] 1:00 in the morning. So, you know, all
[1:51:10] those things work out. So, you I didn't
[1:51:12] even know those delays were going to
[1:51:13] come. But one thing I did know is I know
[1:51:15] I'm coming back home.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; All right. I don't know how many delays
[1:51:18] are going to go on. I don't even know. I
[1:51:20] mean, I it may look like I'm going back
[1:51:22] to Atlanta from Oklahoma City, but they
[1:51:24] might have diverted and said, "We're
[1:51:25] going to take you to Detroit." It
[1:51:26] doesn't matter because I'm going to go
[1:51:28] home. You and I don't know what we're
[1:51:30] going to have to go through. We don't
[1:51:32] know what tomorrow holds, but what's
[1:51:33] important is a finished work of the seal
[1:51:36] of the living God to know I know where
[1:51:38] my final destination is. I've come from
[1:51:41] God and I'm going back to God.
[1:51:45] I don't know all of these other points,
[1:51:48] but I got the token that says
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; I'm ready to go.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said, "He that heareth
[1:51:58] my word, believeth on him that sent me
[1:51:59] hath everlasting life, and shall not
[1:52:03] come into condemnation, but is passed
[1:52:06] from death unto life." Right.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; When something has been finished, that
[1:52:11] means you can't add nothing to it or
[1:52:14] take nothing away.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; And that's the way it is when the Holy
[1:52:20] Spirit has come in your life. There is
[1:52:22] nothing that needs to be added. No ism
[1:52:25] of man.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Nothing to be taken away. Well, you
[1:52:30] know, that's just the word. The word is
[1:52:32] the living word of God, the Holy Spirit.
[1:52:35] Amen.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. It's receiving the
[1:52:39] word of Almighty God.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't we don't want the
[1:52:43] traditions and and isms of man to where
[1:52:45] it's got to be something we need to
[1:52:47] replicate this in order to show proof.
[1:52:49] There's no greater proof than the fruit
[1:52:51] of the Holy Spirit lived out and
[1:52:54] manifested through a life in a daily
[1:52:57] basis.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; Come on. A person can have all kinds of
[1:53:01] demonstrations and fruits. We're now I'm
[1:53:03] not against demonstrations, but I'm
[1:53:04] listen I I am I am given by God to call
[1:53:07] our attention that demonstrations is not
[1:53:11] what we rest on.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; It's not what we rest on. That's not the
[1:53:17] evidence of the Holy Ghost. The evidence
[1:53:19] is your desire has been changed. Your
[1:53:23] nature has been changed. A man could be
[1:53:25] a very gifted man or a woman be very
[1:53:27] gifted and my they might be you know
[1:53:30] just so gifted but then when it all
[1:53:32] comes down to it all beneath that gift
[1:53:35] and sometimes that gift
[1:53:37] can actually become what dams them
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; because they rely on a gift
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; instead of an evidence that God gave
[1:53:46] according to his word.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Sammy, you just pulling that
[1:53:50] out. No, you read the message. the
[1:53:52] harvest time. The prophet said Satan can
[1:53:53] hand out gifts, supernatural gifts by
[1:53:56] the handfuls.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; So, we understand this and we we're not
[1:54:01] want to rest on that. When it comes to
[1:54:03] the end of the day, we're resting on the
[1:54:05] word of God.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; This is why the scripture when it tells
[1:54:08] us, let me let me let me get here into
[1:54:10] this place. Sorry. I love this scripture
[1:54:12] here out of 2 Thessalonians chapter 2.
[1:54:15] We are bound to give thanks always to
[1:54:17] God. For you, brethren, beloved of the
[1:54:18] Lord, because God hath from the
[1:54:20] beginning chosen you to salvation
[1:54:24] through sanctification of the spirit and
[1:54:27] belief of the truth, where unto, I love
[1:54:31] this, he, not me, he called you by our
[1:54:38] gospel.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; So, who was it through the message that
[1:54:44] Paul had? Who was it? Well, who gave
[1:54:45] Paul that message? God did.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; And so through that message, God called
[1:54:52] to his children.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I love this last part. To
[1:54:57] what? To the obtaining of the glory of
[1:54:59] our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Next one. Ownership.
[1:55:05] A seal means
[1:55:08] we've been bought.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; We're under new ownership.
[1:55:14] No wonder Paul would write to us.
[1:55:16] Sometimes these are things that I think
[1:55:17] we we probably we we forget too many
[1:55:20] times as Paul would say, "Remember,
[1:55:23] you're bought with a price."
[1:55:26] What does that mean? That means it's
[1:55:28] it's not not my not my own to live.
[1:55:30] Like, well, if I choose to do this or I
[1:55:32] choose to do this, we're forgetting.
[1:55:34] We're bought with a price.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; And with that, notice the spirit and the
[1:55:39] body. He says, "Because of this
[1:55:41] realization, glorify. Let God be shown."
[1:55:44] Don't let your spirit become all clogged
[1:55:46] up with offenses and clogged up with
[1:55:49] bitterness and clogged up with the
[1:55:50] things of life.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; We're bought with a price.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; You're not your own.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I I
[1:56:01] remember, you know, the 19 years that I
[1:56:02] lived when it was all on me. Even though
[1:56:05] God was watching over my life, but boy,
[1:56:07] what a mess. what scars. And I also know
[1:56:11] right now as well too that anytime that
[1:56:14] I have in some way taken something where
[1:56:16] it's in my spirit or my flesh, what a
[1:56:19] mess it is.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Hello. What a mess it is. But to
[1:56:23] remember, we're bought with a price.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; My life is not my own. It ain't about
[1:56:28] you. It's surrendering to him.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; We're not our own.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. There's a security to
[1:56:36] think about this here. that that
[1:56:37] security that would come our way. This
[1:56:40] is what the seal itself is a security.
[1:56:43] Let me let me let me just read this to
[1:56:45] you to where on this security when they
[1:56:47] secure even this this train car or a
[1:56:50] seal is placed on something that seal
[1:56:52] cannot be broken. It cannot be tampered
[1:56:55] with. Do you realize Satan can buzz
[1:56:58] around on your flesh? He can buzz around
[1:57:00] through your mind. Do you know? Let me
[1:57:02] just tell you this. Do you realize he
[1:57:04] has to even get permission?
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Yes. to touch those other two realms.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Job chapter one, he had to get
[1:57:12] permission. And you know, when God
[1:57:15] allows permission, it shows that God has
[1:57:18] got confidence in the fellowship that
[1:57:21] he's had with you.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:26] Glory be to God. It's a security that
[1:57:29] that seal can't be broken on that soul.
[1:57:31] Oh my. You know, sometimes, listen,
[1:57:33] friends, sometimes our minds can go this
[1:57:34] way. Sometimes we've we've felt things
[1:57:36] wrong.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, sometimes we've got the wrong
[1:57:40] conclusions.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; And you ask, "Hey, did you go and talk
[1:57:45] to that person?" Well, no, but I just
[1:57:46] believe. No. No. Did you go talk to him?
[1:57:49] No. No. I just believe. No. Sometimes
[1:57:52] we've drawn the wrong conclusions,
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; You know, those things always show out
[1:57:56] in the wrong conclusions because the
[1:57:57] feelings are never right.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; Things start acting funny and different
[1:58:02] and everything else. But listen, this is
[1:58:04] why this is why the seal of the living
[1:58:07] God is so important in that reality of
[1:58:09] redemption. Because with that right
[1:58:11] there, Satan can't get to that. And
[1:58:14] God's got contact with that inner man.
[1:58:16] And that inner man is a son of God. Once
[1:58:18] once he can recognize the enemy at his
[1:58:21] tricks and resist him and recognize that
[1:58:25] God in him is greater, he's already
[1:58:27] overcome.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:32] Hallelujah. That seal, the Bible says at
[1:58:35] the end of Esther, when that seal was
[1:58:37] put upon the writing, notice that last
[1:58:38] little part, the writing which is
[1:58:40] written in the king's name and sealed
[1:58:42] with the king's ring, may no man reverse
[1:58:45] it.
[1:58:46] What God has spoken about your life,
[1:58:49] he's not having a new thought.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When the seal was placed
[1:58:55] upon that stone that sealed Daniel in
[1:58:58] the lion's den, it was the king's seal
[1:59:00] that was placed on it that no man that
[1:59:03] it might not be changed the purpose
[1:59:05] concerning Daniel.
[1:59:08] Now, let me bring this down here on
[1:59:09] this.
[1:59:14] Insults
[1:59:17] are terrible.
[1:59:19] You've been insulted. I've been
[1:59:21] insulted.
[1:59:23] Maybe we should all just join hands and
[1:59:25] sing kumbaya
[1:59:28] [Laughter]
[1:59:31] or joining joining an insulting group.
[1:59:33] Not a consulting and insulting.
[1:59:37] But I want you to think of this
[1:59:40] an insult to Jehovah.
[1:59:45] An insult. Now remember down in Egypt in
[1:59:49] Exodus 12 when they were to take the
[1:59:51] blood, they had to take that lamb and
[1:59:53] slay it. And they were choosing to
[1:59:57] identify themselves with the lamb.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Right
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; now they they they they couldn't take
[2:00:02] the blood and just say, "Well, I'm going
[2:00:04] I'm going to put it on the bedroom door
[2:00:05] in here." No, it had to be on the whole
[2:00:08] house.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; Right. Right. So for the house, it had
[2:00:12] to be at the entry point and that was on
[2:00:16] public display. And matter of fact, that
[2:00:18] being on public display, they wanted
[2:00:20] everybody to see it.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; They wanted everybody to know, I'm
[2:00:23] identified with this message.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; I'm identified with this blood. I'm
[2:00:27] identified with this.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; That that was it was an identification
[2:00:32] that something has already died in
[2:00:35] mystead.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; Right? And then you remember remember
[2:00:39] how the prophet talks about the death
[2:00:40] angel itself could be moving by and how
[2:00:43] that maybe you know a little boy who was
[2:00:45] the firstborn. I mean he could look at
[2:00:47] his dad and say hey
[2:00:50] are are are you sure is everything going
[2:00:52] to be all right? But his father, you
[2:00:54] know how brother Ram would dramatize
[2:00:55] that. His father was there to assure
[2:00:57] him. And you know how he assured him? He
[2:01:00] pointed him to the word that God gave
[2:01:02] through his prophet and we have done
[2:01:05] what God has told us to do.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; You understand friends? There's no
[2:01:09] greater place sometime. This is why
[2:01:11] getting away from traditions and isms of
[2:01:13] man, stay with the word.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; It's it's taking the word and doing what
[2:01:20] the word says do in faith. And you know
[2:01:23] what they had to have? Not super duper
[2:01:24] faith,
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Hup. Hup was common faith. It's simple
[2:01:29] faith and to apply the blood.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; But listen how brother Ram says this. I
[2:01:36] love this quote.
[2:01:39] He says, "The Israelites once settled
[2:01:41] there. What if they would get to
[2:01:43] studying?
[2:01:45] Well, I'm not worthy.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; What else do I have to do?" You don't
[2:01:50] have to do nothing. The only thing is to
[2:01:52] come under the shed blood that settles
[2:01:54] it. Once under the blood, you're safe.
[2:01:58] What if the death angel with his sword
[2:02:00] in his hand sweeping the land? You
[2:02:03] didn't have to wonder. And to be scared
[2:02:06] was an insult to Jehovah. If a man once
[2:02:11] under the blood feels afraid that God
[2:02:14] won't keep his word, it's an insult to
[2:02:17] him.
[2:02:20] Say,
[2:02:21] Jehovah, perhaps this is your word, but
[2:02:23] I don't know whether it's right or not.
[2:02:26] Oh, shame on you. Once under the blood,
[2:02:29] he said, "I'm the Lord that health thee,
[2:02:31] I believe it. That's all." Don't insult
[2:02:34] him. He that cometh unto me, I will in
[2:02:37] no wise cast out. I believe it. Once
[2:02:40] coming under the blood, take his word
[2:02:43] for anything that he says.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Samuel, the devil telling
[2:02:50] me, you know what?
[2:02:53] You give that liar and he that's all
[2:02:55] he's known as is a liar.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; And listen, you know, the only reason
[2:02:59] that you listen to him or I would listen
[2:03:02] to him for any give him any little space
[2:03:04] of time because it seems like he has
[2:03:06] validity in what he's saying
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; because what he begins to point out is
[2:03:11] all of your mistakes and all of your
[2:03:12] faults. But remember, he cannot know
[2:03:15] your heart.
[2:03:16] Amen.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; But you know your heart.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; You know the desire in your life.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; You know where you're standing with God.
[2:03:25] That's why you'll never fe defeat the
[2:03:27] enemy or drive him back by going out and
[2:03:31] trying to reason with him.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; You'll be defeated. Go out there in your
[2:03:35] spirit realm. He'll defeat you every
[2:03:37] time in that spirit realm.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Well, go out under the in the flesh and
[2:03:41] the feeling. He'll defeat you every
[2:03:43] time. But when you bring him back to the
[2:03:45] sacred sands of God's grace, where
[2:03:49] there's a finished work,
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; where there's ownership,
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; where there's security,
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; the devil can't put his dirty footprints
[2:03:59] there. He's not welcome there.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; That's a place where you're able to
[2:04:07] stand and the devil can't get there. As
[2:04:09] a matter of fact, the prophet says when
[2:04:11] you say, "Oh, the devil made me do it."
[2:04:13] He said, "No." He said, "You just wasn't
[2:04:15] sealed in." He said, "But if you're
[2:04:18] sealed in, the devil is sealed out."
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; Oh. He said, "Because if it's a devil
[2:04:24] that would come in and lead us out and
[2:04:26] lead us here," he said, he would, in
[2:04:28] order for him to do that, he'd have to
[2:04:30] come through the same process you came
[2:04:31] through.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; And then he'd be your brother.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:41] Every believer, here it is. She says,
[2:04:44] "Every man or woman that has been
[2:04:46] brought under the blood of Christ,
[2:04:49] all fear and condemnation is gone out."
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; Then watch this. Then he will believe
[2:04:56] every word that God writes in the Bible
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; to be the truth.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about an evidence. Now
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; he will not say this is not inspired and
[2:05:07] that's not inspired. Now there might be
[2:05:09] things he'll believe every word. Amen.
[2:05:11] There are going to be things and because
[2:05:13] when we come to the house of God, guess
[2:05:15] what takes place at the house of God,
[2:05:17] our shortcomings are made known.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Oh my, brother Samuel. I mean, I you
[2:05:24] know, I I feel so I feel like I need to
[2:05:26] to press on here and I need more
[2:05:28] patience and I need more of that. That's
[2:05:30] the presence of God showing over our
[2:05:33] lives what we need to grow up into.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; There is a growth that's going on our
[2:05:39] lives. It's not God showing you and I
[2:05:42] that there hadn't been nothing done in
[2:05:44] our life.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; See, God's not interested in upsetting
[2:05:49] our faith. He wants us to be stable.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; He wants us to be settled. Remember,
[2:05:56] when you've been bought out of that
[2:05:58] market,
[2:06:00] loosened, you can never be sold as a
[2:06:04] slave again.
[2:06:08] And there might be things that you'll go
[2:06:10] through in your life,
[2:06:12] but the Bram covers it. I don't have
[2:06:14] time in the Hebrew series. There might
[2:06:16] be things that you can you you'll go
[2:06:18] through in your life, things that in
[2:06:20] your own character because remember when
[2:06:22] you re when the Holy Spirit has come
[2:06:24] into your life, that changes your
[2:06:26] desire. And what is your desire? Your
[2:06:29] desire is for him.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; Your desire is for the word and that
[2:06:33] alone. And that's why when the spirit of
[2:06:35] truth has come, he'll lead and guide you
[2:06:37] into all truth. This is why that even
[2:06:39] when there's things that showed up in
[2:06:41] your life or my life, the spirit of
[2:06:44] truth is guiding us into that place that
[2:06:48] he might have a greater and more
[2:06:50] preeminence in our lives and it's
[2:06:53] leading us to surrender. We see our
[2:06:54] shortcomings. The Holy Spirit will
[2:06:56] reveal things right here in our lives
[2:06:58] because remember remember when the new
[2:07:00] birth has come, you're not a fully
[2:07:02] matured son and daughter of God.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; You begin as a baby
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; and you grow.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; We're growing. But we've received the
[2:07:10] earnest of his spirit. We've received
[2:07:13] the spirit of adoption. We've received
[2:07:15] that teacher on the inside, that fire
[2:07:17] that's able to cook the word as the word
[2:07:19] is coming in. It's able to direct the
[2:07:21] word where it needs to go. Are you
[2:07:23] hearing me this morning?
[2:07:25] It's based on the desire. He changes
[2:07:29] your desires
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; and your desire is him alone and he is
[2:07:35] the word.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; That's when the Holy Ghost has come.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; You might not have any other this sign
[2:07:44] or that's it ain't about that. The signs
[2:07:47] that follow a seal shows coming and
[2:07:49] going. Right.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in walking on water
[2:07:53] if if that needs to be for somebody or
[2:07:55] whatever more. I mean, if I know a lot
[2:07:57] of times there's a lot of things God
[2:07:58] will do for us, it's just
[2:07:59] self-edification. I I understand that
[2:08:01] even like with, you know, when we're
[2:08:03] off, you know, by ourselves and and we
[2:08:05] we we get into I understand all that.
[2:08:07] But realize there's no greater and
[2:08:08] higher authority
[2:08:11] than what God has done by the new birth
[2:08:13] where your desire has been changed.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so when anything, no matter
[2:08:17] what comes your way, that's what you
[2:08:18] always bring it right back to. That's
[2:08:20] the reality of redemption in your life.
[2:08:23] And you know what? Your life shows it.
[2:08:26] That's why there's nothing the enemy can
[2:08:28] try to can try to put things in your
[2:08:29] mind. He can try to, you know, try to
[2:08:31] bring things up and you can he can try
[2:08:33] to present this to you, but you know
[2:08:34] what? When when that's no longer in
[2:08:36] here, there's nothing to grab a hold of.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Your desire is to pre to please him.
[2:08:42] Now, he'll come in through he'll come on
[2:08:44] the spirit. remember the spirit and
[2:08:46] he'll use listen he'll even when he
[2:08:48] whispers in his thoughts he cloaks it in
[2:08:50] your voice
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; to make you think it's you
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; and it's your desire you say how do I
[2:08:57] know you know whether it's your desire
[2:08:58] or not
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; you know whether it's your desire you
[2:09:02] know what's on the throne of your heart
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; is that all right
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; I'm just trying to bring this down tray
[2:09:09] tables are up everything's been
[2:09:12] collected
[2:09:14] But this right here is something you can
[2:09:16] walk with.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; And it's got to on a daily basis because
[2:09:20] from this going forward, even in our
[2:09:22] lives,
[2:09:23] God wants to settle us. It's not God
[2:09:26] trying to make everybody, oh, make
[2:09:28] everybody have the the new birth. No. If
[2:09:30] you don't, if you haven't come to that
[2:09:32] place, it's for you.
[2:09:34] But if you have, God's laid out the
[2:09:36] prescription so we can lay we can see
[2:09:38] everything clearly for what it really
[2:09:40] is. Let's stand.
[2:09:48] I love how the prophet says it
[2:09:52] right here in the message. Does God
[2:09:55] change his word? This is right after he
[2:09:58] preaches. It's the rising of the sun. He
[2:10:00] says,
[2:10:01] "I wanted to get that message to you."
[2:10:03] Talk about rising of the sun that you're
[2:10:05] a part of this resurrection and don't
[2:10:07] worry about it no more. just rejoice
[2:10:11] over it.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; There's nothing nowhere can ever
[2:10:14] separate you from it. Nothing. Eternally
[2:10:17] secured in the kingdom of God. When God
[2:10:20] has stamped his seal upon you, you're to
[2:10:23] the end of your destination.
[2:10:25] When the government puts a seal upon a
[2:10:27] package, the railroad puts a seal on a
[2:10:29] door, that car cannot be tampered with
[2:10:31] until it reached its destination.
[2:10:35] When God puts his seal upon a man and
[2:10:37] that seal is the Holy Spirit, when he
[2:10:38] seals a man like that, he's gone to his
[2:10:42] eternal destination. Never no more can
[2:10:44] he ever go back anymore. He refers
[2:10:47] Ephesians 4:30, "Grieve not the Holy
[2:10:49] Spirit of God, whereby you're sealed for
[2:10:52] all times. You are sealed forever. You
[2:10:54] are sealed eternally into the kingdom of
[2:10:56] God by the Holy Spirit." Now, think of
[2:10:59] that.
[2:11:01] Then the devil will punch at you. He'll
[2:11:05] say everything to you and accuse you and
[2:11:07] try to make you think that you're not.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; But don't you listen to him.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; You know, now watch, right? Watch how
[2:11:17] this says. You know you've passed from
[2:11:19] death unto life. You know the things
[2:11:22] that you once loved, you don't love no
[2:11:25] more.
[2:11:26] You know that you have believed every
[2:11:29] word of God.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; That's where you stand
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; as a son and daughter of God.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; That's the authority that you have
[2:11:40] within your life. Listen, like brother
[2:11:44] Ram says, he says that little policeman,
[2:11:45] he throws his hand up. He said he
[2:11:48] couldn't even stop a runaway pony.
[2:11:51] But he's got with that badge and his
[2:11:54] position, he's got all of city hall
[2:11:56] behind him.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; So it isn't it isn't you or me or our
[2:12:01] strength, it's that badge of believer of
[2:12:04] the seal of the living God.
[2:12:06] This is why that even when the spirit of
[2:12:08] God just move moving down in a place and
[2:12:11] how that we can apply it. You're praying
[2:12:12] for your children. Maybe maybe there's
[2:12:14] sickness and uh whatever the need might
[2:12:16] be or maybe the enemy is trying to
[2:12:18] afflict you in your mind trying to want
[2:12:21] to you know to bring you into captivity
[2:12:23] in your mind get remember what look what
[2:12:24] he just said here. He'll try to make you
[2:12:26] think.
[2:12:28] You know what he wants to do? Get you on
[2:12:30] a rabbit trail
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; and you're searching here. you're you
[2:12:34] everything you're trying to do is trying
[2:12:36] to prove who you are.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; You don't have to prove anything.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; God's already proven it.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that slide it. I'm saying
[2:12:45] there's one way there's a place that we
[2:12:46] have to stand and that's on the word of
[2:12:48] God that you know what God has done for
[2:12:51] you. Right.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; And I say here this morning, if if
[2:12:54] that's if you haven't come to that place
[2:12:56] yet where your very desire has been
[2:12:59] changed to where it's completely him,
[2:13:04] what an opportunity,
[2:13:06] a time to be identified with him. I
[2:13:08] thank God for this reality of
[2:13:10] redemption. Don't you
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; thank God? There there is a place of
[2:13:13] security, friends. There is a place
[2:13:15] where where we where where we're able to
[2:13:17] reside in Christ and and and the devil
[2:13:22] cannot touch us.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; The devil cannot touch us. It cannot it
[2:13:26] cannot be saved one day and lost the
[2:13:28] next.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; Impossible.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; That's impossible to be that way.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; Well, I was sealed with the Holy Ghost
[2:13:34] and now I'm unsealed. That's impossible.
[2:13:36] You're sealed until the day of your
[2:13:37] redemption. That's right.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; See the certainty of the word of God.
[2:13:41] Just like when they have all these
[2:13:42] different other evidences, you know, of
[2:13:44] like I think of, you know, even family
[2:13:46] and think, well, I know family, you
[2:13:48] know, they they were in organizations.
[2:13:49] Well, I know he spoke in tongues and
[2:13:51] man, I know he had a real real move of
[2:13:53] God upon his life and he spoke in
[2:13:54] tongues. But now here he's out here and
[2:13:56] he's married to the second woman and
[2:13:57] going on to this one and this and that.
[2:13:59] I I can't even figure I guess he just
[2:14:00] lost it. But yet you you can't say that
[2:14:02] because if he ever really had a real
[2:14:05] experience, you can't lose the Holy
[2:14:06] Ghost.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right?
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; So what did it show? Never was sealed.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; Because once it's sealed, it keeps us.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you the power of this
[2:14:17] keeping the keeping power of this seal.
[2:14:19] It was there to where when the enemy
[2:14:20] came against the prophet and when he
[2:14:22] came up right next to him when he was
[2:14:24] standing looking at Sharon Rose and the
[2:14:26] devil came right up, Satan came right up
[2:14:28] next to him. Now you and I, we've not
[2:14:30] had Satan come right up next to us.
[2:14:32] We've had a lot of his imps.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; Right. But Satan came right up next to
[2:14:36] him and said, "Look at you. Look at all
[2:14:37] you've done. You've you've went and
[2:14:39] you've labored." And you know, he went
[2:14:41] on and on and on and on and and look at
[2:14:44] this. And now he just he just takes your
[2:14:46] little girl. He just pulls down that
[2:14:48] black sheet in front of you. Look at
[2:14:50] that now. And you'll serve a God like
[2:14:52] this.
[2:14:54] And the prophet said, "I was about ready
[2:14:57] to say
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; because he already said in reasonings he
[2:15:03] was right."
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; Reasoning
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; in his reasoning. But he said, "I was
[2:15:10] about ready to say if that's how he's
[2:15:13] going to be." He said, "But oh, that new
[2:15:17] birth on the inside,
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; that tiepost, that seal rose up and
[2:15:22] said, "Yay, though he slay me,
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; I'll serve him."
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; That's the power we're talking about of
[2:15:30] redemption. The reality that it's not
[2:15:32] you or I holding on. It's God
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; that's got a hold of us.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; Purchased the public testimony right
[2:15:40] there in the market. The purchase has
[2:15:42] been made. bought out of the market
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; and never able to be sold as a slave
[2:15:47] again.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; What a song. I'm no longer
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; a slave to fear.
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; I'm no longer
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; cuz God's grace has reached down
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; and lifted up our lives.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; Where where has it lifted? It's lifted
[2:16:02] it back into the place where God
[2:16:03] intended us to be.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, I I I don't know who
[2:16:07] wouldn't want that. I really don't I
[2:16:09] don't know who wouldn't want that. I I
[2:16:11] don't I don't know how I don't I don't
[2:16:12] know how anybody would want to settle
[2:16:14] just for a church life.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; You say, "Why?" Because the only thing I
[2:16:18] can see is that's a miserable life.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; Because you you you you you come into a
[2:16:24] place or you come and and and it's no
[2:16:26] there's no life. It's just it's just
[2:16:27] something which just going through the
[2:16:28] motions.
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; It's something deeper.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; God's calling for relationship.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; That's what the new birth comes to do.
[2:16:38] It comes to change. Hallelujah.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; Our nature to where our lives,
[2:16:43] it's about Christ.
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; It's about him. It's about his word.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; It's about his body.
[2:16:51] Life of his life, bone of his bone,
[2:16:54] spirit of his spirit. It's about him.
[2:16:56] And that reality is I can never be a
[2:16:59] slave again.
[2:17:02] Never. Let me just tell you, you might
[2:17:04] have even had something where you were
[2:17:06] even confessing
[2:17:08] something. you were thinking and man it
[2:17:10] just weighing on your mind and things
[2:17:13] just so heavy.
[2:17:15] You might have thought, brother Samuel,
[2:17:16] I felt like I was in slavery or I fell
[2:17:20] into this trap or I fell in this I but
[2:17:21] but you say well how am I not in
[2:17:23] slavery? Look at where you're standing
[2:17:25] today.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; You couldn't be kept there. You can
[2:17:29] never be sold back into slavery again
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; because he's already laid claim
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; on your soul.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, aren't you grateful,
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; Lord? I I want you to have every bit of
[2:17:45] me
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; in my soul. I I believe with all my
[2:17:49] heart he's sealed me. But I want him to
[2:17:51] have my spirit.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; Completely, Lord. If there's things that
[2:17:55] I've been hoarding up in my spirit, I
[2:17:57] want them cleaned out.
[2:17:59] I don't want I don't want anything
[2:18:00] saved. I don't want I don't want
[2:18:01] nothing. I don't want nothing but him
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; cuz you're ordained and I'm ordained to
[2:18:06] be a channel
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; that that can flow through
[2:18:11] because just as he's been a redeemer for
[2:18:13] you, remember the prophet said he uses
[2:18:16] humanity to redeem humanity.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; God works through our lives. You love
[2:18:23] him this morning.
[2:18:27] Heavenly Father,
[2:18:30] Lord, we so thank you for your mercy,
[2:18:34] thank you for your grace once again,
[2:18:36] Lord.
[2:18:38] Father, I pray that
[2:18:40] Lord, right here this morning, Lord,
[2:18:42] through
[2:18:45] Lord, just this little thought, Lord,
[2:18:48] coming into that place, Lord, of
[2:18:51] and really just seeing, Lord, that just
[2:18:54] even more, maybe, Lord, it's just a a
[2:18:56] word of encouragement, maybe to one
[2:18:57] person. I believe it's more than just
[2:19:00] one, Lord.
[2:19:02] But father to see in our lives
[2:19:07] never
[2:19:09] to do away Lord with that fear
[2:19:12] as Paul would write there in Ephesians
[2:19:14] 1. Do away with fear
[2:19:17] of ever
[2:19:19] be here a Christian today and lost
[2:19:21] tomorrow to knock that like the prophet
[2:19:24] says out of our minds.
[2:19:27] Lord, it isn't to where we become
[2:19:28] careless,
[2:19:30] but it's where we rest in what you have
[2:19:33] done in our lives.
[2:19:36] Cuz nothing can be added to it. Nothing
[2:19:39] taken away from it. Lord, even of the
[2:19:42] times where we have got slothful, it
[2:19:44] never took away from it. The times, Lord
[2:19:47] God, where we have lacked in our lives,
[2:19:50] never took away from it, Lord.
[2:19:53] As a matter of fact, Lord, of even all
[2:19:55] of the
[2:19:57] all the good days in a row didn't add to
[2:19:59] it. It's a finished work.
[2:20:02] So, it isn't something that we are that
[2:20:04] it's that we're adding to or something
[2:20:07] that can be taken away from.
[2:20:10] But, Father, with all of our hearts,
[2:20:14] we want, Lord, our whole being,
[2:20:17] Lord, all that we are.
[2:20:20] We're bought with a price,
[2:20:23] Lord. We want you to just have your way,
[2:20:25] Lord. Search us, Lord. I pray. Search
[2:20:29] every life that's here this morning,
[2:20:31] Lord. Father, don't let don't let one of
[2:20:34] us, Lord, don't let it escape, Lord.
[2:20:37] Oh God, I pray if there's one that
[2:20:39] doesn't know you, Lord, in that way
[2:20:41] where the very desire of their life,
[2:20:43] Lord, where it's come down, there's a
[2:20:45] real sweetness and meekness of the Holy
[2:20:47] Spirit on the inside, Lord God, where
[2:20:50] their lives, it's that desire, it's
[2:20:53] leading them on into the word of God
[2:20:56] where, Lord, that very nature that
[2:20:57] desires have been changed. And it's just
[2:21:00] you, Lord. That's all I want. It's just
[2:21:03] you,
[2:21:05] Lord Jesus.
[2:21:08] Grant it, Lord. Maybe, Lord Jesus, it's
[2:21:11] something, Lord, that the enemy is
[2:21:12] wanting to put before some habit or
[2:21:14] something in their life. God, I pray may
[2:21:17] they look to you, Lord, right here this
[2:21:20] morning. God, may their eyes be lifted
[2:21:22] up to you, Lord. The one, Lord, who made
[2:21:24] a public testimony with them in mind,
[2:21:27] Lord. Oh God, where your grace is
[2:21:29] sufficient, Lord Jesus, as the
[2:21:31] testimony, Lord God, among us, Lord,
[2:21:34] it's not things that we had to quit. Cuz
[2:21:36] if we quit it, it'll come right back.
[2:21:39] But Lord God, when when you come, Lord,
[2:21:41] it's not what we quit. It's what, Lord
[2:21:44] God, that desire flees from our life.
[2:21:48] Oh granted, Lord Jesus, I pray, Father,
[2:21:52] may you just come down, Lord, in such a
[2:21:54] way. Draw and woo, Lord, lives into a
[2:21:56] place, Lord. I believe God every heart
[2:21:58] and every life would want to be in that
[2:22:00] place Lord of a real security Lord. A
[2:22:03] place Lord where there's a point of no
[2:22:06] return. A place dear God where there's a
[2:22:09] a rest and that reality Lord in the
[2:22:11] heart to know. Oh grant it Lord God. A
[2:22:15] strength on the inside Lord that gives
[2:22:18] us grace day by day Lord that Father if
[2:22:20] our thoughts get a little off there is
[2:22:22] grace on the inside Lord. There's
[2:22:25] strength, Lord, on the inside.
[2:22:28] Oh, for we are the temple of the Holy
[2:22:30] Ghost. Grant it, Lord, I pray. May you
[2:22:33] give strength, Lord Jesus, to each and
[2:22:36] every life, Lord. Oh, God, I pray as
[2:22:39] believers, Lord, even as we would leave,
[2:22:41] Lord, this building this morning,
[2:22:44] may we never, Lord, go out there and try
[2:22:47] to meet the enemy in the spirit realm,
[2:22:50] the flesh. that may we Lord God always
[2:22:54] come back to that reality of the sacred
[2:22:56] sands of God's grace.
[2:22:58] Lord Jesus, we know what we were before
[2:23:02] this token was applied and we know what
[2:23:05] we are after it's been applied. That's
[2:23:08] how we know it's been applied, Lord. Oh
[2:23:11] God, you've changed our lives, Lord. How
[2:23:14] we thank you, Father. What a reality,
[2:23:16] Lord God. Oh, we're not a slave. No. Oh
[2:23:20] God, we might have been slaves to all
[2:23:22] things of the world and different
[2:23:24] things, but Lord, we were not meant to
[2:23:26] be slaves.
[2:23:28] We were meant to be sons and daughters
[2:23:30] of God. So I pray God, may your grace
[2:23:34] even now,
[2:23:36] may the sanctifying love of Jesus
[2:23:39] Christ, Lord God, through the washing of
[2:23:41] water by the word, may it just, Lord,
[2:23:44] relieve every heart and mind of any
[2:23:47] slavish mentality, Lord.
[2:23:51] Oh God, grant it. Lord,
[2:23:56] we love you because you first loved us.
[2:24:00] Like your prophet said, Lord, he said,
[2:24:02] if I don't preach one more sermon, I
[2:24:05] know that I'm going to heaven.
[2:24:08] He said, I'm not going to heaven because
[2:24:10] I preach. I'm going to heaven
[2:24:14] because I have met God's requirements.
[2:24:17] But Lord, what an honor it is to be able
[2:24:20] to do whatever it is that you would have
[2:24:22] us to do.
[2:24:24] Help us, Lord, every one of us here,
[2:24:26] never to underestimate the power of
[2:24:29] their life preaching
[2:24:32] sermons
[2:24:34] by the way that they live. Lord,
[2:24:37] oh God, you've borrowed lives that the
[2:24:40] blood, the voice of the blood might
[2:24:42] speak through. Lord God, they go to
[2:24:45] different workplaces. We have family
[2:24:47] members. We have different ones. Lord,
[2:24:49] oh God, there's suffering humanity all
[2:24:51] around us, Lord. There's loved ones,
[2:24:54] Lord God. I pray, oh God,
[2:24:57] that the voice of that blood, Lord, not
[2:24:59] it be muffled through our lives, but may
[2:25:02] every channel be so clear. Lord,
[2:25:06] it would be such a clarity, Lord, of
[2:25:08] proclaiming of freedom.
[2:25:11] Grant it, Lord. I pray.
[2:25:14] Now, Father, there's needs, Lord, among
[2:25:16] us. I heard requests, Lord, different
[2:25:18] ones, Lord, that you know are in need of
[2:25:20] healing. Lord, Sister Irma, Lord, just
[2:25:23] in need, Lord, of of deliverance of that
[2:25:25] infection in her body. Heavenly Father,
[2:25:28] you see right where she's at right now,
[2:25:30] Lord, right there in that hospital room,
[2:25:32] Lord. Dear God, you're the same God who
[2:25:35] moved down to touch Sister Stephanie
[2:25:36] right here, Lord. Father, just moments
[2:25:38] before, Lord, stepping out, Lord, here
[2:25:40] to minister the word of God. And Father,
[2:25:43] believers, Lord, we're uniting our faith
[2:25:45] together right now. Once again, Lord,
[2:25:48] you said, Father, if we, Lord, agree is
[2:25:50] touching any one thing, it shall be
[2:25:52] done. Lord, there's more than two or
[2:25:54] three believers right here this morning,
[2:25:55] Lord. And dear God, we're asking,
[2:25:58] Father, that Lord, just as you've moved
[2:26:00] down to redeem, Lord, our soul, we see,
[2:26:02] dear God, that everything is included in
[2:26:05] the package, Lord God, even for the
[2:26:08] healing of our bodies. Father, I pray
[2:26:10] may you move down, Lord, for Sister
[2:26:12] Irma, Lord. You have brought her, Lord,
[2:26:14] such a long way, dear God. But, Father,
[2:26:18] you're faithful for a complete work,
[2:26:20] Lord. I pray that, Lord, grant it right
[2:26:23] now, Lord, for every other request,
[2:26:25] Lord, every need, Lord. Father, behind
[2:26:28] every hand, Lord, upon every heart,
[2:26:30] Lord, Father, we lift it, dear God,
[2:26:32] before the throne of grace this morning,
[2:26:34] Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ. Grant
[2:26:38] it, Lord, for these needs. I pray father
[2:26:40] as your children Lord
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; have need of healing need of strength
[2:26:45] Lord maybe it's relieving Lord of
[2:26:48] oppression in the mind oh God grant it
[2:26:51] Lord in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:26:55] amen and amen
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; oh I'm no longer

[2:27:14] of God,

[2:27:41] with a meloy.

[2:27:50] the song.

[2:28:08] are gone.

[2:28:26] of God.

[2:28:39] For I am a child
[2:28:44] of God.
[2:28:48] And from my mother's womb,
[2:28:53] you have chosen me.
[2:28:57] Oh love has called
[2:29:02] my name.
[2:29:06] I have been born again
[2:29:11] into your family.

[2:29:20] my veins.

[2:29:57] of God.
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; You split my sea.
[2:30:01] Oh, you
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; you split the sea so I could walk right
[2:30:08] through it.
[2:30:11] My fears aren't drowned in your perfect
[2:30:15] love.
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, you me. So I will stand and sing.
[2:30:27] Oh, I am

[2:30:48] drowned in perfect love.

[2:30:55] you rescued me so I can stand and say
[2:31:02] that

[2:31:05] a child
[2:31:07] of God.
[2:31:10] And I'm no longer

[2:31:52] of God.
[2:32:00] There is a blood
[2:32:04] that cost the life
[2:32:09] that paid my way.
[2:32:14] death its price.
[2:32:18] And when it flow
[2:32:22] down from the cross,
[2:32:26] my sins were gone.
[2:32:31] My sins were gone.
