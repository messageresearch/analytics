[39:22] bring questions
[39:25] Lord
[39:26] a
[39:27] that scripture you know Lord has just
[39:29] been pulsating on My Heart Lord for
[39:32] weeks
[39:34] of how that Moses
[39:36] would speak to the children of Israel
[39:39] there in Deuteronomy
[39:41] he would speak of how that
[39:45] it would be known
[39:47] what nation
[39:49] has such judgments and statutes as this
[39:53] nation
[39:55] that Lord that the people
[39:58] that others around would would see as
[40:02] you would Express in that scripture that
[40:04] thou art called by the name of the Lord
[40:09] God that your character
[40:11] would be so would be manifest
[40:16] in their lives that would be a life that
[40:19] separated and different and this is the
[40:21] scripture Lord that have been just so
[40:23] pondering on Amen that God that a nation
[40:28] would have God so nigh
[40:30] upon all that they would call upon him
[40:33] for
[40:35] and Lord
[40:36] The Desires in our life
[40:39] are not for the material and temporal
[40:42] things of this world
[40:44] it's for you Lord
[40:47] it's for you
[40:49] it's that Lord this word might come to
[40:53] pass in our life
[40:56] this is our desire Lord
[40:59] we need healing in our body there's a
[41:02] need for deliverance there's need Lord
[41:05] for the filling of the Holy Ghost
[41:07] there's need for refilling there's needs
[41:10] the Lord God Among Us Lord and you are
[41:13] still the same yesterday today and
[41:15] forever
[41:17] what a people that has God so nigh unto
[41:20] them
[41:22] Lord it certainly was not us Lord
[41:25] finding you but it was you coming to
[41:28] find us Lord
[41:30] you weren't lost we were lost Lord you
[41:34] came and you sought us out oh God how we
[41:38] thank you Lord for your mercies Lord
[41:41] so we asked you this morning Lord oh God
[41:45] that even in this moment and even as the
[41:47] word is coming forth May our hearts Lord
[41:50] be filled with prayer Lord may it be
[41:54] filled Lord with as the word is coming
[41:56] so be it Lord let that rain in my life
[41:59] let it move in my heart whatever Lord
[42:01] our needs are and those things that you
[42:04] would Lord make known o God it's in your
[42:08] presence that we receive fullness of joy
[42:15] because Lord in your spirit
[42:17] when the word has went forth
[42:20] there is no other court
[42:22] of appeal
[42:25] the Supreme judge has spoken
[42:29] granted Lord we pray
[42:32] in the name of Jesus Christ may you just
[42:35] Lord have the preeminence the Lord in
[42:38] every part of this service Lord I give
[42:41] myself to you
[42:43] Lord you see moments ago as I stood
[42:45] before the door that would lead out of
[42:48] my office and I asked you would you just
[42:51] go before me
[42:52] would you lead me to the platform
[42:55] would you just make a way Lord
[42:58] I just Lord want to be your assistant
[43:00] this morning
[43:02] that you would just speak to our hearts
[43:04] and our lives Lord help me to step out
[43:07] of the way Lord
[43:09] that you can come Lord I pray in a
[43:11] personal way
[43:13] how we love you and we thank you Lord
[43:16] in the name of Jesus Christ
[43:19] amen
[43:21] amen don't you love him
[43:25] and let's turn in our Bibles to
[43:26] Ecclesiastes chapter 8.
[43:29] just so good to be in his presence good
[43:32] to be gathered
[43:34] amen with each of you and
[43:36] amen it's just a privilege to serve the

[44:12] so good to see each and every one of you
[44:14] and
[44:16] I also want to remember
[44:18] it almost slipped my mind and I've tried
[44:20] to send it out to other people but with
[44:24] um

[44:27] wouldn't mind

[44:46] years brother Timothy ashong from Ghana
[44:49] and um I just wonderful message that
[44:52] brother Timothy has spoke here he's
[44:55] my goodness I think the first time
[44:56] brother Timothy came it might have been
[44:58] back in 97 or 98 but just to keep it in
[45:02] mind on Monday morning this tomorrow
[45:05] morning he's scheduled to undergo
[45:09] prostate cancer surgery
[45:12] and here is actually in North Carolina
[45:14] and he's been there his wife is flying
[45:18] over also to help and during the healing
[45:22] and recovery process
[45:24] so
[45:25] uh we just the prayer request is this
[45:28] that we would remember him in prayer in
[45:31] our services and then as well as praying
[45:35] for him tomorrow and and I forgot to
[45:37] mention that would you mind to Bow your
[45:39] heads once more and we'll just approach

[46:24] special way because we know that even
[46:26] now Lord that oh God you're still The
[46:30] God Who dissolves the Lord every sound
[46:33] Lord and we recognize Lord that cancer
[46:35] Lord It's a bachelin Cell It's a spirit
[46:38] that's God in there but Lord we're
[46:41] thankful Lord that you are still the
[46:44] Mighty God you're greater Lord than

[46:49] for our brother Lord for a complete
[46:51] deliverance and a healing of his body in
[46:54] the name of Jesus Christ
[46:56] amen
[46:58] Hallelujah
[47:00] God bless you
[47:01] Ecclesiastes 8.
[47:06] who is who is as the wise man
[47:09] and who knoweth the interpretation of a
[47:13] thing
[47:14] a man's Wisdom maketh his face to shine
[47:18] and the boldness of his face
[47:21] shall be changed now Solomon's right in
[47:25] here of just even a man in the natural
[47:27] that even with natural wisdom we've all
[47:30] experienced times where we've had the if
[47:32] I can say it like this an understanding
[47:34] or an aha moment they call it in school
[47:37] or when things begin to open to us and
[47:39] oh I figured this out maybe it's
[47:41] something in your home or something's
[47:43] been put together and there's a
[47:45] difference you see it's reflected on our
[47:47] face now if that's how that is in the
[47:50] natural and it is
[47:52] then how much greater is it in the
[47:54] spiritual
[47:55] sure because it was in the spiritual
[47:57] that when Moses came forth from the
[47:59] presence of God and came down the Bible
[48:01] said his face is shown
[48:04] how much greater is the wisdom of God
[48:06] than the wisdom of man
[48:09] so it's we just look at this in verse
[48:12] two I counsel thee to keep the king's
[48:16] commandment and that in regard of the
[48:19] oath of God
[48:20] be not Hasty to go out of his sight
[48:25] but stand stand not in an evil thing for
[48:30] he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him so we
[48:33] know there's a there's there is uh if
[48:36] this is in the natural how much more in
[48:39] the spiritual to stay in the presence of
[48:42] the Lord
[48:43] you see this is why it's so important
[48:45] that even when after a service
[48:48] after service is finished and what God
[48:50] has spoken let me just say it like this
[48:52] brother Brahm says when the Holy Spirit
[48:54] is here to inspire you
[48:58] when he's here to inspire you he says
[49:01] you confess that word because he's there
[49:05] to back it up
[49:09] that's the inspiration of the Holy
[49:11] Spirit
[49:13] so to understand when we then in his
[49:15] presence because there's a lot of things
[49:17] with just simple cares of life
[49:20] let alone other things of entertaining
[49:23] different things that wants to draw us
[49:25] out of his presence but we realize his
[49:29] presence is not just confined to this
[49:31] building
[49:33] but his presence it goes with us
[49:36] and God will speak to us if we'll just
[49:39] draw nigh unto him how many knows the
[49:42] scripture says draw nine to God and
[49:43] he'll draw nine to you and brother
[49:45] Brandon would take that same scripture
[49:47] over and over and over and he would deal
[49:49] with sometimes he said we have so many
[49:52] other thoughts on our minds who are
[49:53] thinking about the latest dishwashing
[49:55] powder and he brings it down to simple
[49:57] things that are not even sinful are you
[50:00] hearing me now they're not even sinful
[50:02] things but it's just when we become
[50:05] occupied
[50:07] yeah and that's what Satan wants to do
[50:09] is occupy our lives and that's a battle
[50:12] that's a battle every moment it's a
[50:15] battle for you and I to sit here and not
[50:17] let our minds be occupied on tomorrow or
[50:19] what's coming up it's a battle
[50:22] we have to fight there is a battle
[50:24] that's engaged remember songs have went
[50:27] forth this is not right here this is not
[50:29] just a relaxing time it's a time of
[50:31] battle
[50:33] because the word the songs always go
[50:35] forth and then the word is leading us
[50:37] into battle and I believe when the word
[50:39] is leading us into battle we follow the
[50:41] word there's victory
[50:43] Victory is certain I just want to follow
[50:45] the word
[50:46] so we want to stand to entertain his
[50:49] presence amen
[50:51] verse 4 where the word of a king is
[50:55] there is power
[50:58] and who may say unto him what do us thou
[51:02] Jesus Christ he's the king of saints
[51:05] the almighty God
[51:07] whoso keepeth the Commandment shall fill
[51:10] no evil thing
[51:11] and a wise man's heart discerneth both
[51:14] time
[51:16] and judgment amen may God bless you
[51:18] bless the reading of the word as you're
[51:20] being seated
[51:21] I'd just like to speak here just once
[51:24] again just for
[51:25] a few moments just taking just the
[51:28] thought and just moving ahead just a
[51:30] little bit
[51:31] upon the power of the word
[51:34] and I want to just deal with the thought
[51:37] behind that a sub thought if we could
[51:40] under that because when we talk about
[51:42] the power of the word
[51:44] we don't want to just leave it to where
[51:47] it's something that we're observing
[51:50] are you hearing me we just don't want it
[51:52] to be where it's something that we're
[51:54] observing
[51:55] or you know we're giving An Occurrence
[51:57] of something that happened
[51:59] but we want to take it in and let the
[52:03] power of the word work in our lives
[52:07] where we're Witnesses of it
[52:09] so we want to deal with that of
[52:12] recognizing
[52:13] receiving
[52:15] and releasing the power
[52:18] that's in the word
[52:20] recognizing
[52:23] receiving and releasing the power that's
[52:26] in the word
[52:28] you realize that
[52:30] you know brother Branham would make this
[52:31] statement over and over because it's
[52:33] right there in the scriptures of how he
[52:35] says
[52:36] that God
[52:37] he said even when the preacher's
[52:39] preaching and how he's ministering
[52:42] and he said no matter how the minister
[52:44] how are they with all the things that
[52:46] would be put together
[52:48] it says it's not the minister that heals
[52:51] you
[52:51] it's not the minister that delivers you
[52:54] but God has sent the ministering gifts
[52:59] and this is here he sends as the Bible
[53:01] says he maketh his ministers as a flame
[53:05] of fire
[53:07] because his ministers are anointed with
[53:12] his spirit
[53:13] the same The Same Spirit that sends the
[53:18] word that delivers the word to you and I
[53:20] that has delivered the message to you
[53:22] and I that same Holy Spirit has never
[53:26] left the church
[53:29] it's God speaking his word and he's
[53:33] declaring God's just not uh giving his
[53:37] word just to say things but God is
[53:40] speaking his word to call forth what he
[53:45] has already said that now it would come
[53:47] into manifestation
[53:50] and that's God declaring that and it's
[53:53] it comes into our lives that we would we
[53:57] would receive that we would recognize
[53:59] that and we would receive that and I
[54:02] just want to deal with a few parts here
[54:04] this morning on this uh within this
[54:07] thought and I want to take from there
[54:09] when we're looking at where the word of
[54:11] a king is there is power
[54:15] now we know that there are natural laws
[54:17] and natural things in the land Peter
[54:19] describes all of that from in Acts and
[54:22] then over into second Peter and we
[54:24] understand that there's things that are
[54:26] even laws and things within the land
[54:29] that if you don't heed to them and Obey
[54:32] him you you're thrown you know you get
[54:35] thrown in jail or fines or whatever more
[54:37] there's a penalty that's from them
[54:39] but we recognize that within just the
[54:43] natural how much greater is almighty God
[54:47] God's word and how much more with his
[54:51] word it's to give us life
[54:54] you understand what I'm saying we could
[54:57] be going we could follow all of the you
[55:00] know the Natural Things of the land and
[55:01] I believe we should the Bible said give
[55:03] unto Caesar what's Caesars right
[55:06] but to understand that God's word the
[55:10] God's word it is there and it's greater
[55:13] than every other word I want you to
[55:15] think of this every word begins with a
[55:19] thought
[55:20] it's greater than every other word his
[55:23] word if I can say it like this and not
[55:26] stand here and elaborate just on this
[55:28] and this moment his word is greater than
[55:32] your thoughts of yourself
[55:36] his word is greater
[55:39] there's no limitations to God's word
[55:43] this very word right here where the word
[55:45] of the king is there is power and that
[55:48] word power means mastery
[55:51] it means to to exercise a lordship over
[55:55] it now I want you to think of this God
[55:57] is a gentleman
[56:00] God does not force himself on anyone
[56:05] because remember this is why every
[56:09] conquering that's ever took place when
[56:11] one nation or country conquers another
[56:13] one that conquering never lasts
[56:18] right
[56:19] it only lasts as long as this person
[56:22] remains in power and this and then
[56:24] eventually something Rises up to
[56:27] overthrow that
[56:28] right and that type of conquering never
[56:31] leads to peace it actually leads to a
[56:35] resentment I mean we've seen that even
[56:37] in our generation
[56:39] okay because those are things that we
[56:42] can you know it can be thought well
[56:43] these people need to be liberated but it
[56:45] isn't what we think they need to be
[56:47] liberated because it comes back to this
[56:50] this point here if a heart doesn't want
[56:53] to be liberated then it doesn't matter
[56:56] of all the truth all the word everything
[56:58] that's around that which can bring a
[57:01] liberty to their lives
[57:03] they have to want that
[57:06] and if they don't want it then there's a
[57:09] resentment that sets in there's an
[57:11] opposition against it but so the word
[57:13] when we're looking at this remember the
[57:16] Lord Jesus applies Us in the scriptures
[57:18] he speaks of how that when when when one
[57:22] is come when the son had come and there
[57:24] were those who said in that time we will
[57:26] not have this man to rule over us
[57:29] they did not want to accept his
[57:31] rulership they did not want the son to
[57:34] rule over them
[57:36] but oh my
[57:37] to think what it meant and what it means
[57:41] to receive the word without going
[57:43] through multiple examples if we could
[57:46] call the woman up at the well and ask
[57:48] her what do you say about the power of
[57:52] the word
[57:53] what do you say about the Mastery of the
[57:55] word I tell you what she would say she
[57:58] would say what I would say in any other
[58:00] life that's been set free by the power
[58:02] of the Holy Ghost by the pound of the
[58:04] word I was bound and I wanted to be free
[58:10] and when he came
[58:12] the word came to me
[58:16] and the word began to master
[58:19] every situation every circumstance in
[58:24] her life
[58:25] the word was coming in
[58:28] in power
[58:30] he didn't he couldn't change her if she
[58:32] did not desire to be changed but there
[58:34] was something beneath all of the
[58:38] immorality all the baggage all the
[58:40] darkness there was that something that
[58:42] was a part of God in the beginning
[58:46] and that's what God was coming to
[58:49] liberate
[58:52] that's why we need the Holy Ghost
[58:55] that's why we need the quickening power
[58:59] amen we just don't need uh you know just
[59:02] where our lives are so filled up with
[59:05] well I know this and I know this and I
[59:07] know this Doctrine there's the whole
[59:10] reality is is that we would know the
[59:13] Lord Jesus Christ in the power of his
[59:16] resurrection
[59:19] amen he is a quickening spirit it's a
[59:23] quickening power it's a transforming
[59:25] power and we need that Mastery of the
[59:29] spirit of God because that Mastery is
[59:32] where it comes to a superiority or a
[59:35] control over someone or something
[59:39] the Bible Will Tell Us in Psalms 29 4
[59:42] the voice of the Lord is powerful the
[59:45] voice of the Lord is full of majesty
[59:49] in Psalm 68 33 to him that wideth upon
[59:54] the heavens of Heavens which were of old
[59:56] Lo he doth send out his voice and that a
[1:00:01] mighty voice
[1:00:03] amen I want you to turn with me to
[1:00:04] Isaiah 55.
[1:00:06] your Bibles I don't have this right
[1:00:09] there in that particular point but I
[1:00:11] want you to look here in the scripture
[1:00:13] very simple we're we're familiar with
[1:00:15] this scripture but we're talking about
[1:00:17] the power of the word recognizing it and
[1:00:20] receiving it then that's what releases
[1:00:23] that within our lives
[1:00:26] so verse 6 of Isaiah 55 seek ye the Lord
[1:00:31] while he may be found call ye upon him
[1:00:35] while he is near
[1:00:38] so finding him while he's near so he's
[1:00:42] not afar off he's right here
[1:00:45] so seek Him seek you seek Him the Lord
[1:00:50] who is near
[1:00:51] how do I know he's near because he's
[1:00:54] speaking he's moving he's dealing with
[1:00:57] your life
[1:00:58] so we seek after him now this applies to
[1:01:01] every every part of our life no matter
[1:01:04] what your need and where you set
[1:01:06] spiritually this morning this word still
[1:01:09] applies
[1:01:11] notice in verse 7 let the wicked forsake
[1:01:15] his way now notice the wicked's got to
[1:01:18] be able to forsake his way now you can
[1:01:20] say brother Samuel I can't well let's
[1:01:22] just use a few examples
[1:01:24] the woman at the well that we just spoke
[1:01:26] of she had to be willing to forsake her
[1:01:30] way
[1:01:31] how could she do that right you say
[1:01:34] brother Sammy you just said moments ago
[1:01:36] she was wanting to be free she had a
[1:01:39] desire to be free and when the word
[1:01:41] began to deal with things in her life
[1:01:46] she knew when the word was coming across
[1:01:49] your pathway there was going to be some
[1:01:52] decisions that would be made that would
[1:01:55] be life-altering
[1:01:57] there would be things that she would
[1:02:00] have to let go of all right
[1:02:03] but you understand there was Mastery the
[1:02:07] power of the word the presence of God
[1:02:10] was there to give her strength to
[1:02:14] forsake that
[1:02:15] [Music]
[1:02:20] Hallelujah yes
[1:02:23] and the unrighteous man his thoughts so
[1:02:26] sometimes it's not even your ways it's
[1:02:29] your thoughts you've got to forsake
[1:02:32] sometimes you can say well I I'm got
[1:02:35] this I've met this I met this I'm good
[1:02:37] here I'm good here sometimes it's your
[1:02:39] thoughts
[1:02:41] because our thoughts are no good
[1:02:46] thoughts are no good
[1:02:49] it must be his thoughts remember before
[1:02:51] a word is spoken it's a thought
[1:02:55] so a word is a thought expressed
[1:02:58] your thoughts and my thoughts is what
[1:03:01] has got us into trouble
[1:03:04] and not submitting our thoughts to him
[1:03:09] right
[1:03:10] so we need his thoughts
[1:03:15] and let him return unto the Lord and He
[1:03:19] will have mercy upon him oh I love that
[1:03:24] let him return to the Lord see God isn't
[1:03:27] holding anybody at Bay God's calling to
[1:03:30] his children even if you've drifted in
[1:03:32] your walk God's saying return unto me
[1:03:36] how do you return you return in your
[1:03:38] heart you return in your life you return
[1:03:41] to repentance return unto the Lord
[1:03:44] oh yeah
[1:03:47] and this is what he'll do
[1:03:49] he will have mercy upon him
[1:03:53] and to our God for he will
[1:03:57] abundantly pardon
[1:04:03] there is no situation that the
[1:04:08] handle
[1:04:10] [Applause]
[1:04:18] in this hour that we're living in let me
[1:04:21] just pause here a moment
[1:04:23] the hour that we're living in we
[1:04:26] recognize that the Lord Jesus we can
[1:04:29] quote the scripture all day long he
[1:04:31] triumphed over every principality and
[1:04:34] power that is the word of God
[1:04:38] but remember he has come to vindicate
[1:04:42] that
[1:04:43] this word that God has sent in this hour
[1:04:47] where the seals have been taken off the
[1:04:51] backside of the book it's an end time
[1:04:53] revelation
[1:04:55] and who's in revealing it's revealing
[1:04:59] the same God he is the mighty conqueror
[1:05:04] where men have wanted to sow up the veil
[1:05:08] to where he becomes obscure looking in
[1:05:11] you say how do you say it by how you say
[1:05:13] it's become obscure because when they
[1:05:15] can't truly see him for who he is what
[1:05:18] he has done what he has made available
[1:05:20] then they still remain in their same
[1:05:24] condition but when a heart
[1:05:27] sees him for who he is
[1:05:30] when it comes present to your life I'm
[1:05:32] talking about the revelation of Jesus
[1:05:35] Christ
[1:05:36] when that comes present to your life
[1:05:39] that's it
[1:05:41] amen are you hearing me that's it
[1:05:45] it's to recognize that he is the same
[1:05:47] one as the Bible said here he descends
[1:05:50] with a little book open
[1:05:54] what is the little book it's the Lamb's
[1:05:56] Book of Life
[1:05:58] he's got the whole book are you hearing
[1:06:00] me the whole Bible because this is The
[1:06:03] Book of Life he's got the whole Bible
[1:06:05] but he is speaking to that of his elect
[1:06:10] and it is the word that is ministering
[1:06:14] to the elect though the elect would set
[1:06:17] in darkness though the elect were under
[1:06:19] all sorts of conditions maybe like the
[1:06:22] woman at the well or one on so forth and
[1:06:24] so on but the word is what's energizing
[1:06:28] that seed on the inside to believe and
[1:06:32] let me tell you something it is God's
[1:06:34] strength that is coming to you has come
[1:06:37] to you that causes you to forsake your
[1:06:40] thoughts to forsake your ways
[1:06:44] it's God's strength that comes to you
[1:06:47] that ministers return unto me
[1:06:51] [Applause]
[1:06:53] he had put his foot upon the land and
[1:06:56] upon the sea what is he over he's over
[1:06:59] that ecclesiastical peace power he's
[1:07:02] over the serpent he's over every devil
[1:07:06] are you hearing me
[1:07:11] amen he's the resurrected Lord Jesus
[1:07:13] Christ we are not believing on a
[1:07:16] historical God we see him
[1:07:20] in plain view
[1:07:26] what's the evidence that you see him in
[1:07:28] plain view what's the evidence I see him
[1:07:30] in plain view because he is reflecting
[1:07:33] his authority and power through our
[1:07:36] lives it's a dominion over the flesh
[1:07:38] over sin over the devil and over the
[1:07:41] world
[1:07:50] verse 9.
[1:07:51] for as the heavens are higher
[1:07:55] than the Earth
[1:07:57] so are my ways higher than your ways
[1:08:01] my thoughts than your thoughts
[1:08:03] oh brother Samuel I I could never get
[1:08:05] there yes you can
[1:08:08] no you can't get there on our own
[1:08:09] efforts
[1:08:11] but I'll tell you there's a power here
[1:08:14] that's able to break you out of this
[1:08:16] realm into that other Realm
[1:08:19] Hallelujah there's a power here that's
[1:08:22] able to take you beyond the music
[1:08:24] beyond the doubts
[1:08:27] and be able to see Victory and be able
[1:08:31] to live above your ways
[1:08:35] above your thoughts
[1:08:37] what is it it's the same power that
[1:08:40] transported Elijah
[1:08:42] [Music]
[1:08:44] it's the same power it's the quickening
[1:08:46] power let me ask you a question what is
[1:08:48] it that transports a man or woman from
[1:08:51] sin
[1:08:52] to righteousness
[1:08:58] transports
[1:09:00] God sends what is needed to transform
[1:09:03] this is why the scripture could say
[1:09:06] he hath delivered us
[1:09:09] from the power of darkness and has
[1:09:13] translated us into the kingdom of his
[1:09:16] dear son
[1:09:18] this is what he has done this is the
[1:09:20] Mastery of the word
[1:09:25] let me tell you
[1:09:27] the final Mastery of the word in our
[1:09:29] lives
[1:09:31] is the change of our bodies
[1:09:35] it's working
[1:09:37] I said it's working
[1:09:40] it's working even right now
[1:09:42] the word is working even right now
[1:09:46] [Applause]
[1:09:52] the ram stands there in end time seed
[1:09:54] sign
[1:09:55] he preaches it he preaches end time seed
[1:09:58] sign there in Tifton Georgia but he just
[1:10:00] was at a meeting he was saying at that
[1:10:02] time I believe it was in Florida maybe
[1:10:05] it was in Florida at the Tabernacle but
[1:10:06] he was saying
[1:10:08] to teach my church a lesson
[1:10:10] he says I went to the platform there was
[1:10:12] a young lady who was laying on a cot
[1:10:14] bound
[1:10:16] she couldn't get off that cot
[1:10:18] brother Brown said I wanted to show my
[1:10:20] teach my church a lesson and listen what
[1:10:22] he says he says I went straight to the
[1:10:25] platform I took the text that God gave
[1:10:28] me and I preached that word
[1:10:30] and he said as I was preaching that word
[1:10:33] he said I just stayed right with the
[1:10:35] word and as I was preaching the word she
[1:10:38] got up off of the cop
[1:10:40] you understand what he's saying I'm
[1:10:43] teaching my church something
[1:10:45] what's he teaching the Mastery of the
[1:10:49] word
[1:10:55] I want to say this
[1:10:57] when brother ran him in two places
[1:10:59] he makes the statement he knows there's
[1:11:01] a change coming in his ministry
[1:11:04] but he says I want you to write this
[1:11:06] down the change that's coming in my
[1:11:08] ministry will not be so much a change in
[1:11:11] the ministry as it will be a change in
[1:11:15] me
[1:11:17] see that's what the third pool does it
[1:11:21] brings a change in our life
[1:11:24] that's what the seventh seal is all
[1:11:26] about don't let words confuse you the
[1:11:29] seventh seal is the coming of the Lord
[1:11:32] it's the fullness of his presence coming
[1:11:36] in a bright body
[1:11:38] [Music]
[1:11:40] it's making ready because that that seal
[1:11:43] has been released he's right here with
[1:11:45] us and what's it doing it's ushering us
[1:11:48] on in to the rapture
[1:11:52] that's why the prophet could say the
[1:11:54] Rapture cycle is on
[1:12:01] what does a cycle what is a cycle what's
[1:12:04] a cycle with planting right you you you
[1:12:07] you take the wheat you take so much of
[1:12:10] the grain you eat of it and then you re
[1:12:13] you plant what has come forth and then
[1:12:17] out of that one seed comes more
[1:12:21] and this is why when the scripture says
[1:12:24] Thou must prophesy again
[1:12:28] the word again means a cyclic up
[1:12:31] oscillatory operation in other words let
[1:12:34] me just do not to confuse you with big
[1:12:36] words I don't think you are but in other
[1:12:38] words that's what
[1:12:39] it's a cycle we are receiving the word
[1:12:43] we are eating the word becoming the word
[1:12:46] and the word is being sewn back into our
[1:12:49] lives
[1:12:51] it's a maturing that is taking place
[1:12:56] man
[1:12:58] I mean
[1:12:59] I trust
[1:13:01] that you're able to look at your life
[1:13:03] and say I'm not what I was before and
[1:13:06] I'm not just talking about 20 years ago
[1:13:09] no no I'm talking about even a month ago
[1:13:13] a week ago come on now
[1:13:15] because you might have wondered in here
[1:13:17] and everything else about your life but
[1:13:19] where are you today
[1:13:22] have you moved closer to God
[1:13:26] all around Hallelujah I can speak of
[1:13:28] things that God even within the past uh
[1:13:32] months has made known and when I say
[1:13:35] reveal I'm not just talking about
[1:13:37] observing but God bringing things down
[1:13:40] into my life it's victory
[1:13:43] and you know when it's victory over this
[1:13:46] guy
[1:13:47] it ain't nobody else this guy
[1:13:50] this guy
[1:13:54] this guy
[1:13:59] oh my let me go on here
[1:14:05] for as the rain cometh down and the snow
[1:14:08] from heaven
[1:14:09] wasn't that beautiful yesterday
[1:14:13] trapped you yeah oh that snow was flying
[1:14:16] I said Thank You Jesus I loved it man
[1:14:20] but notice well listen as the rain
[1:14:22] coming down and the snow
[1:14:24] he's not talking about a thunderstorm
[1:14:26] here
[1:14:27] are you hearing me we're not talking
[1:14:29] about it he's talking about something
[1:14:31] that comes down
[1:14:33] in uh silence something that comes down
[1:14:37] and it's not making great disturbance
[1:14:39] but it's coming down with the purpose
[1:14:43] the rain and the snow is coming down
[1:14:46] with the purpose the Bible said he
[1:14:48] poured out a spirit upon All Flesh but
[1:14:50] it don't stop there
[1:14:51] upon my handmade
[1:14:55] those who receive and surrender
[1:15:03] oh my for as the rain cometh down in the
[1:15:06] snow from heaven and returneth not
[1:15:08] thither but watereth the Earth and make
[1:15:11] us it bring forth and Bud that it may
[1:15:15] give seed to the sower and bread to the
[1:15:17] eater
[1:15:20] sometimes
[1:15:21] where we're at
[1:15:23] is right here in this scripture
[1:15:26] we're wanting bread when we see rain
[1:15:31] we're wanting bread when we see snow we
[1:15:33] should want bread
[1:15:35] but remember for there to be bread
[1:15:38] there's got to be a seed
[1:15:40] and there's got to be nourishment for
[1:15:43] that seed
[1:15:44] is that right
[1:15:46] oh I can give you a Litany of quotes
[1:15:48] Easter seal 65 is the rising of the sun
[1:15:51] power to transform God's power to
[1:15:53] transform brother the man says no oak
[1:15:55] tree comes up overnight
[1:15:59] right but what is it it's a continual
[1:16:02] quickening that is taking place
[1:16:05] it's quickening quickening quickening
[1:16:08] quickening quickening we don't want to
[1:16:10] stop don't be settled with just one
[1:16:12] quickening
[1:16:14] but let it keep quickening you on up
[1:16:17] keep clicking we want to be quick enough
[1:16:19] you say how long does a quickening go
[1:16:21] until we see him
[1:16:25] [Applause]
[1:16:27] because when our loved ones appear
[1:16:29] before us right there there'll be
[1:16:31] another sweep another quickening
[1:16:34] and we'll be changed
[1:16:37] and then we'll Fellowship here on the
[1:16:39] breath of the Earth
[1:16:41] amen
[1:16:45] God has everything arranged
[1:16:48] is that right we need a continual
[1:16:50] quickness that's what we should seek for
[1:16:52] it's more of God
[1:16:55] when the rain and the snow you'll see
[1:16:57] the rain and the snow what does it do
[1:16:59] the the earth is made to absorb it
[1:17:06] take it in why because there's a seed
[1:17:09] that needs it
[1:17:12] look what he says in verse 11. so shall
[1:17:15] my word
[1:17:16] be that goeth forth out of my mouth it
[1:17:21] shall not return unto me voice
[1:17:24] [Music]
[1:17:27] God is saying my word comes as the rain
[1:17:30] as the snow
[1:17:32] it comes as a former and lettering
[1:17:36] it comes as a sowing ring and as a
[1:17:38] maturing ring and it also cometh as the
[1:17:42] snow what is the snow though thy sins be
[1:17:45] a Scarlet they shall be whiter than snow
[1:17:49] a word that brings pardoning Grace
[1:17:55] a word that helps us to see ourselves as
[1:17:59] God sees us
[1:18:04] Hallelujah that's when a life recognizes
[1:18:06] they're a son and daughter of God
[1:18:08] brother when the word begins to be
[1:18:10] preached and they recognize that you
[1:18:12] don't need to coax them onto repentance
[1:18:13] it strikes their heart
[1:18:17] is that right
[1:18:19] amen the old the opening right there in

[1:19:15] shall accomplish that which I please so
[1:19:17] oh God I want the word to have

[1:20:29] the lives that's been given for him
[1:20:31] but do you realize friends what was
[1:20:32] needed
[1:20:34] because as brother Brown would give that
[1:20:36] dramatization of the auction
[1:20:39] where there was a violin nothing wrong
[1:20:41] with the violin
[1:20:43] but nobody wanted to bid on it
[1:20:47] nobody wanted it didn't seem like it had
[1:20:49] any value
[1:20:50] but there was one who was sitting in the
[1:20:53] audience
[1:20:54] he was there the whole time when nobody
[1:20:57] was wanting to bid on it
[1:20:59] but here he came
[1:21:00] one who knew what was in them and was
[1:21:05] able to release what was trapped in
[1:21:08] silence
[1:21:11] and he walked up
[1:21:18] and he takes it
[1:21:21] then he takes that bow
[1:21:24] predestinated
[1:21:26] ordained for this hour
[1:21:28] the Holy Spirit the inspiration that is
[1:21:31] poured out to make this word live
[1:21:35] and it begins to take the word and it
[1:21:37] begins to play upon that word you shall
[1:21:41] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:21:44] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[1:21:46] sins restore the truth of the godhead
[1:21:50] restoring the reality of predestination
[1:21:53] and as it's being played there's a
[1:21:56] Melody that is in line
[1:22:00] with our lives
[1:22:04] there's a lot of other songs that tried
[1:22:08] to capture us but we weren't a part of
[1:22:12] those songs
[1:22:14] we were a part of this music sheet
[1:22:20] what was needed
[1:22:22] was the composer to move down and a
[1:22:27] director that can stand there and say
[1:22:29] what God has said is still the truth
[1:22:34] and God confirming it
[1:22:38] because God confirming his word
[1:22:41] is God speaking
[1:22:44] no he does send forth his voice and that
[1:22:47] a mighty voice
[1:22:50] it's the lion roaring who can but
[1:22:54] prophesy
[1:22:55] [Applause]
[1:22:56] [Music]
[1:23:05] God is determined
[1:23:08] to bring his word to pass
[1:23:12] amen he's determined
[1:23:14] I don't care how much unbelief is all
[1:23:15] around he's determined
[1:23:18] God's word he said it's not going to
[1:23:20] come back to me void
[1:23:23] it's going to accomplish
[1:23:25] that word is going to achieve
[1:23:28] are you hearing me time makes no
[1:23:30] difference
[1:23:33] sometimes you and I can get in a hurry
[1:23:35] but time does not make a difference
[1:23:38] the word holds mastery is to have
[1:23:42] Mastery in our life to bring the word to
[1:23:44] pass let me give you a few examples here
[1:23:46] within the scripture
[1:23:49] here are the disciples what's just
[1:23:51] what's the word here
[1:23:52] the same one who spoke in the beginning
[1:23:54] in Genesis 1.
[1:23:56] when the condition
[1:23:58] was Darkness
[1:24:00] chaos
[1:24:02] when you could say it was yeah chaos
[1:24:05] chaos means what disorder
[1:24:07] things are all out of order
[1:24:09] how can this be how are we going to
[1:24:11] bring this in order
[1:24:13] see God God gave the example how do we
[1:24:15] bring how do our lives come in order how
[1:24:18] do our homes come in order
[1:24:20] how is order brought by the word of God
[1:24:25] and he said
[1:24:27] to the darkness let there be light
[1:24:31] he didn't even he didn't go through and
[1:24:33] give a lot of a lot of other a lot of
[1:24:35] things just said let there be light
[1:24:37] because light is understanding
[1:24:40] light is revelation now you realize the
[1:24:43] first light that ever struck this Earth
[1:24:45] was Shekinah
[1:24:47] the Shekinah light of almighty God
[1:24:50] because it was the Shekinah light
[1:24:52] working upon the Earth that would cause
[1:24:55] the Earth to move
[1:24:57] around the Sun
[1:25:01] see here's the Shekinah Glory of God
[1:25:04] working Upon Our Lives to bring us fully
[1:25:09] into relationship with him
[1:25:13] it's his presence
[1:25:15] and the Bible says there was light
[1:25:19] his word
[1:25:21] held Mastery over the darkness
[1:25:26] [Applause]
[1:25:27] all the other seeds that were planted
[1:25:30] there
[1:25:31] the word held mastery
[1:25:34] over the circumstances
[1:25:36] and it released what they always were
[1:25:43] here he stands
[1:25:45] after a meeting he's in the back of the
[1:25:48] boat the Lord Jesus
[1:25:50] here he is the word made flesh
[1:25:53] and the Bible says that a great storm
[1:25:56] Came Upon the sea
[1:25:59] and that storm
[1:26:01] Satan was going to try to drown them
[1:26:05] are you with me
[1:26:08] but they
[1:26:09] woke him up
[1:26:12] they knew they needed him if they didn't
[1:26:17] they were going to perish
[1:26:20] but they asked him don't you care that
[1:26:23] we perish
[1:26:25] well
[1:26:27] of course he cared
[1:26:29] and of course he cares about you
[1:26:32] amen of course he cares about me
[1:26:37] and you might really be in
[1:26:43] you know what a storm does on the lake I
[1:26:45] mean look right now here just on our
[1:26:47] Lake
[1:26:48] there's some serious waves I've been out
[1:26:51] there on a boat with this fella right
[1:26:52] here
[1:26:53] one time I was out there with him one of
[1:26:55] the times and he told me he said oh
[1:26:57] we'll just go around Mouse Island right
[1:26:59] here and I'm I'm looking and the boats
[1:27:01] going
[1:27:02] we're right
[1:27:08] trying to get it out brother Dave you
[1:27:10] you think there's going to be fish
[1:27:11] biting this
[1:27:12] we were rolling
[1:27:14] I mean we were roping
[1:27:17] you know what waves can cause right
[1:27:19] wind can cause ways
[1:27:23] and cause waves in your spirit waves in
[1:27:25] your life a great storm but this is what
[1:27:27] they did they woke him up
[1:27:31] and that's the thing
[1:27:33] don't try to handle the storm on your
[1:27:35] own
[1:27:36] wake him up
[1:27:39] wake him up now you might have to go
[1:27:41] back to a place maybe there's a place in
[1:27:43] your life where you you kind of went
[1:27:45] astray but he's there he never left you
[1:27:49] he's near
[1:27:51] what I have to do go back and wake him
[1:27:53] up
[1:27:54] wake him up
[1:27:57] say Lord
[1:27:59] the storm that's present
[1:28:02] and let him speak to that storm because
[1:28:04] in speaking to that storm he's letting
[1:28:07] you know
[1:28:09] I care about you
[1:28:11] I want to do for you
[1:28:14] because let me say something the storms
[1:28:16] that come about within our life
[1:28:20] and they come about through many
[1:28:22] different ways
[1:28:23] but there's no storm
[1:28:26] that a person will ever face like a
[1:28:29] storm when they come down to the Jordans
[1:28:32] chilly Waters at the time of death
[1:28:35] remember the Samuel I'm not counting on
[1:28:38] going to death I'm counting on going to
[1:28:39] enter the Rapture are you ready
[1:28:42] are you ready
[1:28:44] if you're not ready to face that you're
[1:28:47] not ready for the rapture
[1:28:50] are you hearing me now let's not play
[1:28:53] games
[1:28:55] I don't mean to say it shows distinctly
[1:28:57] but the reality is is that you
[1:28:59] understand there can be a lot of storms
[1:29:01] in life but Storms Come in our life but
[1:29:05] what's important is all is your life
[1:29:09] founded
[1:29:10] on a rock
[1:29:18] right
[1:29:21] and he arose and he rebuked the women
[1:29:23] wind and he said peace be still you know
[1:29:25] what the Bible says you know what the
[1:29:27] Bible says
[1:29:28] that
[1:29:30] the way the when the wind ceased the
[1:29:33] waves think about it waves went
[1:29:36] from this
[1:29:38] call
[1:29:40] what was it mastery
[1:29:43] Mastery over the circumstance
[1:29:46] history because creation recognized the
[1:29:49] voice of its creator
[1:29:54] oh God help us to recognize the voice
[1:29:59] of our creator
[1:30:01] [Music]
[1:30:05] well if they come if they submitted if
[1:30:09] immediately What About Us
[1:30:13] think about Lazarus
[1:30:17] brother Wayne preached all over this
[1:30:20] but here was here was Martha
[1:30:24] right
[1:30:25] and when when finally when Jesus came
[1:30:27] here's what she said
[1:30:29] I know
[1:30:31] that whatsoever you ask God he'll do it
[1:30:33] that was wonderful
[1:30:35] right
[1:30:37] can you say Amen that was wonderful
[1:30:39] that's the truth right whatsoever you
[1:30:40] ask God he will do it yeah
[1:30:42] but you see that wasn't what Jesus
[1:30:44] wanted to bring to her
[1:30:48] that's one part of it
[1:30:51] and but he begins to begins to say this
[1:30:54] let me just refer to a few of these
[1:30:55] places
[1:30:57] Jesus told her thy brother shall rise
[1:31:00] again
[1:31:01] what did she say I know he will in the
[1:31:04] resurrection at the last day right
[1:31:08] but Jesus said I am
[1:31:10] the resurrection and the life
[1:31:13] and he that believeth in me
[1:31:17] not on me you have to start Believing on
[1:31:20] him right
[1:31:21] but believing on him then it leads into
[1:31:25] believing in him
[1:31:27] believing in him is to be dwelling in
[1:31:30] him and how do we get in him by one
[1:31:32] Spirit we are baptized into one body
[1:31:36] right who the believer than me though he
[1:31:39] were dead yet shall he live
[1:31:42] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[1:31:44] shall never die believe us now this
[1:31:46] notice what he's asking do you believe
[1:31:47] it
[1:31:49] see he believed it what he was
[1:31:51] expressing is who he was are you hearing
[1:31:54] me now yeah the word that was being
[1:31:57] spoken this was not reading from a
[1:32:00] letter
[1:32:02] he was announcing
[1:32:04] I am the resurrection and the light
[1:32:07] he was present right there at that
[1:32:10] moment
[1:32:12] and she says yea Lord I believe that
[1:32:15] thou art the Christ the son of God which
[1:32:18] should come into the world
[1:32:20] how many of you ever you know our
[1:32:22] vehicles are so different nowadays
[1:32:23] there's no such thing as Keys anymore
[1:32:25] right but still I know sometimes even to
[1:32:28] get into people's house they've got all
[1:32:29] these you know doodads and gadgets and
[1:32:31] stuff to get in there but let me say
[1:32:33] this to you
[1:32:34] we've heard the term about skeleton keys
[1:32:38] right what's the Skeleton Key
[1:32:40] it's it's it's a key that's not really
[1:32:43] fitted
[1:32:44] to the lock
[1:32:47] but that skeleton key will open up
[1:32:50] multiple locks because it it just has a
[1:32:53] way about it that it's able to turn the
[1:32:56] Tumblers
[1:32:57] in a way but it's not really fitted
[1:33:00] right right
[1:33:02] but in order to have Real ACT access
[1:33:06] that's true access you've got to have
[1:33:09] the key that was made for that lock
[1:33:14] that's why there's
[1:33:20] there's another assignment the Holy
[1:33:21] Ghost is not something that is just
[1:33:24] coming faith is not just something that
[1:33:26] just well it has a little bit to turn a
[1:33:28] few of the Tumblers no
[1:33:30] when faith has come
[1:33:32] the key is faith that unlocks every door
[1:33:39] it's made to possess every promise
[1:33:44] Paul said we have with the grace that we
[1:33:47] have been given by faith we have access
[1:33:50] into this grace wherein we now stand
[1:33:55] who's given us this faith
[1:33:58] God has
[1:34:01] I said God has
[1:34:03] now notice this this key you know here
[1:34:06] was here was Martha standing there but
[1:34:08] in order for something to take place
[1:34:12] I I just really want us to drop on this
[1:34:14] right here here is the word of God
[1:34:17] here is the word to be spoken but she's
[1:34:20] got to be willing to forsake everything
[1:34:23] to recognize the word of God being
[1:34:25] manifested right there in her midst
[1:34:29] and here she's got one more one more
[1:34:31] little like brother Bramble called it
[1:34:33] one more little Cog that has to be
[1:34:35] turned she said yay Lord I believe that
[1:34:38] thou art the Christ the son of the
[1:34:40] Living God what happened then
[1:34:43] now things are starting to move because
[1:34:46] the question come down it wasn't whether
[1:34:48] Jesus believed it
[1:34:50] do you believe it
[1:34:52] it's not one of the Prophet believed in
[1:34:54] it's whether do you believe it not
[1:34:56] whether the pastor believes it do you
[1:34:58] believe it not whether your husband
[1:35:00] believes it do you believe it not
[1:35:02] whether your daddy believes it do you
[1:35:03] believe it
[1:35:06] believe us thou this I am the
[1:35:08] resurrection of life she said I believe
[1:35:10] Thou Art the son of God
[1:35:13] that was to come into the world in other
[1:35:15] words you are the promise that was to
[1:35:18] come here in this hour what's she doing
[1:35:20] she's recognizing him
[1:35:24] and here's what he told her
[1:35:27] take away the stone
[1:35:33] how many beliefs
[1:35:35] he could have spoke and removed that
[1:35:37] stone
[1:35:43] we're not talking about paper mache or
[1:35:46] fiberglass Stones was one time I worked
[1:35:48] in a little Sweatshop there for a few
[1:35:49] years and we made these these big rock
[1:35:52] sculptures out of things we had to pull
[1:35:54] these things out and you have blisters
[1:35:55] all over your finger from trying to pull
[1:35:57] them out they were hollow inside but
[1:35:58] they looked like rocks they would spray
[1:35:59] them and they look just like it no no
[1:36:01] they didn't have no substance to them
[1:36:03] this Stone was not just like a little
[1:36:05] Stone I've picked up rocks back here and
[1:36:08] rock said even this size they're heavy
[1:36:10] yeah
[1:36:11] yeah I said they're heavy
[1:36:13] he told them take you away the stone
[1:36:17] not to the men but to the women
[1:36:21] what was happening the word was having
[1:36:25] mastery
[1:36:28] now what do what did Mary say what did
[1:36:31] Mary say at that time Mary or Martha
[1:36:34] that said to him and said but Lord
[1:36:36] stinketh by now in other words
[1:36:39] corruption set in you know what she was
[1:36:41] saying she was right on as far as four
[1:36:44] days Corruptions already set in
[1:36:47] he's thinking
[1:36:50] but what she's what what is going to
[1:36:53] take place is creation to recognize its
[1:36:58] creator
[1:37:01] they had to remove the stone
[1:37:04] you have to remove the stone
[1:37:07] for the Sunday I want you to do that I
[1:37:09] can't do that for you you have to remove
[1:37:11] the stone are you hearing me Satan will
[1:37:14] sometimes that stone can be bitterness
[1:37:16] sometimes that stone can be a complex
[1:37:18] sometimes the song is this is a sin sin
[1:37:22] Satan wants to trap you in that
[1:37:26] what do I have to do take away the stone
[1:37:28] how do I take away the stone by the
[1:37:32] authority of him who is speaking to you
[1:37:42] Hallelujah
[1:37:45] we know the end
[1:37:47] there of this of the story
[1:37:51] here's the Roman Centurion I'm just
[1:37:53] giving just a few of these examples
[1:37:54] here's the Roman Centurion he has a
[1:37:58] servant who's grievously tormented
[1:38:02] every sickness is a devil
[1:38:05] when something as a disease is about the
[1:38:07] life it's torment
[1:38:09] right nobody feels good
[1:38:11] you don't feel good it's a tormenting
[1:38:13] spirit
[1:38:15] and Jesus here the Roman Centurion comes
[1:38:19] to him
[1:38:20] says I've got this need Jesus said I'll
[1:38:22] come and I'll heal him
[1:38:23] right but here's what he says
[1:38:26] he said I'm a man under Authority
[1:38:29] I know
[1:38:31] I'm not worthy that you would come under
[1:38:33] my roof you know what he's doing he's
[1:38:35] putting himself under the word
[1:38:39] don't try to come face to face just put
[1:38:42] yourself under it
[1:38:44] God help us to put ourselves under it
[1:38:47] sometimes it takes sometimes it takes
[1:38:50] a time for us to recognize that we're
[1:38:54] trying to do things by facing him I bow
[1:38:57] to eyeball
[1:38:59] and that'll never work
[1:39:01] what is it it's got to be
[1:39:04] me
[1:39:05] you
[1:39:06] coming under his authority
[1:39:09] that's what the Roman Centurion he said
[1:39:12] if you'll just speak the word only
[1:39:15] you know and he realized he says I don't
[1:39:18] need your physical presence to come to
[1:39:21] my home
[1:39:22] I'm not worthy of that
[1:39:24] you're a busy man
[1:39:26] but if you'll just speak the word only
[1:39:30] I know he says I've got people under me
[1:39:32] if I speak they do they carry out that
[1:39:36] word what is it it's a Mastery it's a
[1:39:38] word being taken place and so this is
[1:39:41] what he recognizes he recognizes this is
[1:39:44] more than a man
[1:39:46] this is God in Christ
[1:39:49] and once he recognizes he recognizes his
[1:39:53] position just like Joshua
[1:39:56] when it came to the Battle of Jericho
[1:39:59] Joshua recognized his position when he
[1:40:03] met the captain of the Lord's host
[1:40:13] do is get out of the way
[1:40:16] right it's me it's you listen friends
[1:40:19] that's the greatest that is the greatest
[1:40:21] battle that you and I have is us getting
[1:40:24] out of the way
[1:40:27] right right
[1:40:29] Hallelujah but this is why we always
[1:40:31] want to put ourselves in the background
[1:40:33] let him be before us
[1:40:37] and Jesus told him go your way
[1:40:40] as thou Hast believe
[1:40:46] so it shall be done unto you
[1:40:49] here's a group of individuals that came
[1:40:52] remember four four individuals that they
[1:40:55] brought a man
[1:40:56] who was sick I believe with the palsy
[1:41:00] and they looked
[1:41:04] there were no parking spaces available
[1:41:06] there was no seat there wasn't nowhere
[1:41:12] you know the story what they did
[1:41:17] they looked up and realized there's a
[1:41:19] way in there
[1:41:20] we're getting into that meeting
[1:41:23] we're going to get into his presence
[1:41:26] even if we've got to take the roof off
[1:41:28] we're going to get into his presence
[1:41:31] yes sir you know why they recognize who
[1:41:34] was there
[1:41:38] how polite is that to take somebody's
[1:41:40] roof off
[1:41:41] are you hearing me it shows when a
[1:41:44] person is Desiring to get into God's
[1:41:46] presence there is a source of Mastery
[1:41:50] that carries us beyond our traditional
[1:41:53] way of thinking
[1:41:55] because it's a traditional way of
[1:41:57] thinking this has to happen like this
[1:41:59] and this and this and this and this and
[1:42:02] God you're in a box
[1:42:05] you won't put God In The Box
[1:42:07] what happens is
[1:42:10] happens isolate yourself from God
[1:42:14] we don't want to put
[1:42:16] we want God to be God
[1:42:21] found the place where Jesus was standing
[1:42:23] and laid and the man they placed him
[1:42:26] they let him down
[1:42:28] the Bible says when Jesus I want you to
[1:42:30] think of the scripture when Jesus saw
[1:42:32] their faith
[1:42:34] it didn't say when he saw the faith of
[1:42:36] the man he said when he saw their faith
[1:42:39] right now are you hear me now
[1:42:42] that man I don't know what it took for
[1:42:44] him to make that kind of a journey I
[1:42:47] don't know all the
[1:42:49] being carried whether it's on a gurney
[1:42:50] or what however it was it wasn't a
[1:42:53] comfortable ride
[1:42:56] but not only did they know
[1:42:59] but there was something in his heart as
[1:43:01] well
[1:43:03] are you hearing me
[1:43:04] because if there hadn't been faith in
[1:43:06] his heart
[1:43:08] and there wasn't faith in the others
[1:43:10] Hearts the others carrying him would
[1:43:12] have said hey buddy we can't go in there
[1:43:16] we can't go in there you know what it
[1:43:18] shows everybody what's in agreement
[1:43:23] there was four Messengers carrying him
[1:43:29] Hallelujah for messengers of death took
[1:43:33] the church
[1:43:35] for messengers of Life restore it
[1:43:39] and here is five standing there
[1:43:45] f-a-i-t-h-g-r-a-c-e faith and Grace
[1:43:49] and he saw their faith what was it
[1:43:52] speaking of
[1:43:53] when everything yes
[1:43:55] is in harmony
[1:43:57] from the inside
[1:44:04] are you hearing me I want to make sure
[1:44:05] that drops
[1:44:07] from the inside
[1:44:09] out
[1:44:11] you know the reason he didn't have legs
[1:44:13] to get there
[1:44:14] are you hearing me now he didn't have
[1:44:16] legs to get there he didn't have the
[1:44:19] arms to carry himself
[1:44:21] but Faith was present
[1:44:24] to put legs in motion
[1:44:27] to put arms in motion
[1:44:31] where did that Faith come from
[1:44:34] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:44:39] the word of God
[1:44:42] we're not here to be entertained
[1:44:44] we're not here to be entertained we're
[1:44:46] here the preaching of the Gospel the
[1:44:48] bread makes it very very very plain the
[1:44:50] preaching of the Gospel the Reason God
[1:44:53] has sent the ministering gifts is so
[1:44:55] that he can get in it and he can raise
[1:44:57] the faith of the people it's not the
[1:45:00] minister raising your faith
[1:45:03] that's raising our faith
[1:45:05] he uses the foolishness of preaching but
[1:45:08] it's God that's doing it
[1:45:20] when he saw their faith
[1:45:25] he said thy sins be forgiven me to the
[1:45:28] to the man on the come thy sins be
[1:45:30] forgiven
[1:45:31] now you know what a disturbance that was
[1:45:34] because there was some setting there
[1:45:37] that only the only intentions they were
[1:45:39] there for
[1:45:40] is for a show
[1:45:42] they were only there and that like think
[1:45:45] of this they were taking up space in the
[1:45:47] house
[1:45:48] that Believers would have gladly
[1:45:50] occupied
[1:45:52] right
[1:45:54] but you see what the word was also going
[1:45:57] to be a judge against him yes
[1:45:59] God doesn't desire to do that but you
[1:46:02] see if you don't receive it recognize it
[1:46:04] and accept it it'll judge you
[1:46:08] nobody sitting right here will have an
[1:46:11] excuse
[1:46:13] we are without an excuse
[1:46:20] thy sins be forgiven thee
[1:46:23] and they begin to reason in themselves
[1:46:24] who is this guy
[1:46:26] blasphemy
[1:46:29] you see that you see
[1:46:30] the Trap of tradition
[1:46:33] and Dogma
[1:46:35] and Creeds
[1:46:37] you see how horrible that is
[1:46:39] yeah I mean who wouldn't who wouldn't
[1:46:42] have been rejoicing
[1:46:45] I don't mean maybe they weren't even
[1:46:46] standing up but who wouldn't have been
[1:46:48] rejoicing
[1:46:50] but you see showing
[1:46:52] that he is the almighty God
[1:46:55] and they begin to question who can
[1:46:57] forgive sins but God
[1:46:59] hello
[1:47:01] hello
[1:47:03] and what does Jesus say
[1:47:06] he said which is easier
[1:47:09] for a man
[1:47:10] to forgive sins or to tell this man
[1:47:14] arise take up thy bed and go
[1:47:18] that's a question
[1:47:22] Jesus didn't even pause after that
[1:47:25] that you may know that the son of man
[1:47:28] hath power on Earth to forgive sins I
[1:47:34] say arise take up thy bed and walk
[1:47:41] what was it his sins were already
[1:47:44] forgiven
[1:47:46] that was in an invisible realm nobody
[1:47:49] could see that but Jesus said that you
[1:47:52] might know what has taken place in an
[1:47:55] invisible realm it will become visible
[1:48:01] that's the power of the world
[1:48:04] [Music]
[1:48:05] it helps Mastery in our life to
[1:48:08] dismantle
[1:48:10] the hold of sin
[1:48:12] to dismantle disease to dismantle
[1:48:16] iniquity
[1:48:19] and what does it do the Mastery of the
[1:48:23] word amen amen has Mastery over it to
[1:48:26] dismiss it
[1:48:27] if thou believest
[1:48:29] [Music]
[1:48:31] then what will happen it becomes
[1:48:33] reflected
[1:48:34] in our walk
[1:48:36] the sins I used to do
[1:48:38] I do them no more the sins I used to do
[1:48:42] I do them no more
[1:48:44] why
[1:48:45] because the things that you were bound
[1:48:48] upon
[1:48:50] now
[1:48:52] now you're carrying it you're ruling
[1:48:55] over it
[1:48:57] what was once your master
[1:49:02] now you are over it
[1:49:05] [Music]
[1:49:14] in the word of God
[1:49:23] let me just have just a couple more
[1:49:24] minutes
[1:49:26] just to tie this point up here because
[1:49:28] this should be a question this is where
[1:49:30] I want to bring you to
[1:49:31] all these situ all of these examples
[1:49:33] these are just
[1:49:35] a few of the examples with the Lord was
[1:49:37] pressing on my heart but I want to bring
[1:49:39] us to this place here
[1:49:41] do you realize the scripture says
[1:49:46] he even came into Nazareth and other
[1:49:49] places
[1:49:51] and the Bible says he could do nothing
[1:49:55] because of their unbelief
[1:49:58] think of this the power of the word the
[1:50:00] Mastery of the word here he was but he
[1:50:03] could do nothing
[1:50:05] because of their unbelief
[1:50:07] so unbelief
[1:50:11] hinders
[1:50:13] God from moving
[1:50:15] now let me just say this to you
[1:50:17] his faith
[1:50:19] is greater
[1:50:21] than your unbelief
[1:50:26] are you hearing me now because his faith
[1:50:30] will stay right there at your life
[1:50:35] and keep reminding you
[1:50:37] Who You Are
[1:50:40] reminding you of what belongs to you
[1:50:45] let me just say this to you
[1:50:48] we just don't want to have a reminder
[1:50:53] anybody ever had to put reminders on
[1:50:55] your phones
[1:50:56] yeah
[1:50:57] I even had a reminder on here about
[1:50:58] brother Timothy Sean
[1:51:00] and I have to put reminders on my phones
[1:51:03] but you know what he goes to show you
[1:51:04] even when I had that reminder set up at
[1:51:06] a certain time to go off
[1:51:09] right before I walk out here and
[1:51:10] hopefully that'll stir my mind
[1:51:14] even of the best intentions are
[1:51:16] reminders it fails
[1:51:20] truth
[1:51:22] certain things I forgot to announce and
[1:51:23] I put a reminder on my phone announced
[1:51:25] this on Sunday and I have it set so that
[1:51:27] it would sometimes have go off right
[1:51:29] when I come and stand here hopefully if
[1:51:30] I'm up here at that particular time
[1:51:32] but see we just don't want reminders
[1:51:35] but God is reminding you and I
[1:51:38] he reminds us who we are he reminds what
[1:51:44] belongs to us
[1:51:47] amen unbelief it hinders him from moving
[1:51:50] in and doing what he wants to do and
[1:51:55] desires to do and Achieve and accomplish
[1:51:57] in our life what do I have to do
[1:52:01] we have to believe
[1:52:02] we have to surrender
[1:52:05] yeah let me just have just these few
[1:52:07] moments here
[1:52:14] the word that's being
[1:52:16] it's being spoken the word
[1:52:19] itself or think of it in this way
[1:52:22] how does the word come into our lives
[1:52:26] I'm just getting right down to a very
[1:52:27] practical basic things how does the word
[1:52:30] come into our life
[1:52:32] the mind
[1:52:33] accepts it
[1:52:35] right I'm quoting greatest battle of
[1:52:37] font I could take you a Litany of quotes
[1:52:38] spoken word's original seat on and on
[1:52:40] and on
[1:52:43] it's got to come
[1:52:45] and the spirit is what's controlling the
[1:52:48] mind
[1:52:49] and the mind has to accept the word of
[1:52:51] God now listen to me not your thoughts
[1:52:54] not your thoughts or my thoughts about
[1:52:56] the word
[1:52:58] because my thoughts and your thoughts
[1:53:00] would be skewed
[1:53:02] but we're talking about receiving his
[1:53:05] thoughts
[1:53:06] receiving the spirit of the word
[1:53:10] when we receive that and let the word
[1:53:13] come down into our life
[1:53:17] receive the spirit of the word
[1:53:20] then it'll put everything else in its
[1:53:24] place
[1:53:26] are you hearing me
[1:53:28] I could really I could just skim through
[1:53:29] this here real quick but I want to just
[1:53:31] in bringing this part of it
[1:53:33] he says I want you to think about
[1:53:35] brother Ram says this he said if this
[1:53:37] church could be put together and knitted
[1:53:39] together with such that every person
[1:53:40] would be in one Accord with not one
[1:53:43] Shadow of Doubt anywhere what's brother
[1:53:44] brown mean by one Accord
[1:53:47] well it means you know brother Joshua
[1:53:49] and I are thinking the same thing no I
[1:53:50] don't mean that
[1:53:51] one Accord means to be one in him
[1:53:54] one with his thoughts
[1:53:57] right
[1:54:00] we still have our own different
[1:54:01] preferences about things
[1:54:03] right in order for there to be Unity we
[1:54:05] have to we have to be burning to
[1:54:07] surrender our opinions many times
[1:54:10] so you're getting what I'm saying you
[1:54:12] see sometimes we're thinking that in
[1:54:14] that way but if everybody would be in
[1:54:15] one Accord one Accord with who one in
[1:54:17] one Accord with the Lord because let me
[1:54:20] tell you something if we're in one
[1:54:21] Accord with him it'll be no problem
[1:54:24] being one Accord with somebody else
[1:54:26] it'll be no problem because if I'm
[1:54:29] trying to get one Accord right here I'm
[1:54:31] working the wrong way are you hearing me
[1:54:33] now I gotta go why he's bringing him if
[1:54:35] I'm trying to get well come on Brothers
[1:54:37] me and you we we got to get in one
[1:54:38] Accord come on brother we all gotta we
[1:54:40] gotta that don't work that way
[1:54:43] one Accord is being in one Accord with
[1:54:47] him
[1:54:49] [Applause]
[1:54:50] that is welcoming the preeminence of the
[1:54:54] word
[1:54:57] amen yes Hallelujah
[1:55:00] because you'll never I don't just the
[1:55:02] congregation our science you're never
[1:55:04] going to get everybody to everybody's
[1:55:06] taking on the same page
[1:55:09] come on that ain't gonna happen
[1:55:11] that's foolishness to think that but
[1:55:14] where are we on a court is because we're
[1:55:16] not that my mind's like your mind no we
[1:55:18] are under his mind
[1:55:21] we have one desire and that's to see him
[1:55:24] [Applause]
[1:55:29] Hallelujah
[1:55:31] I'm Gonna Worship in church whether he
[1:55:33] sings my favorite song or not
[1:55:42] right I'm gonna sing my special even if
[1:55:45] it is on Thursday night instead of
[1:55:47] Sunday
[1:55:48] [Music]
[1:55:54] not one shadow of down anywhere you and
[1:55:57] I could sit down there can still be
[1:55:58] shadows of Doubt but if we're focused on
[1:56:01] him
[1:56:03] then all the needs everything that we
[1:56:07] have need of he is the one to meet every
[1:56:10] need
[1:56:15] I'm going to read this because I believe
[1:56:16] I believe I'm one of them I believe I'm
[1:56:18] speaking to people that believe this too
[1:56:20] if we're in one according not one Shadow
[1:56:22] of Doubt anywhere there would not be a
[1:56:24] feeble person in our midst in another
[1:56:25] five minutes there will not be nobody
[1:56:28] here Desiring the Holy Ghost but what
[1:56:30] would receive it if you could just get
[1:56:32] that certain thing fixed and that's
[1:56:34] where the battle begins right in your
[1:56:37] mind whether you will
[1:56:41] now let me preach just a few moments
[1:56:43] here he said this ain't Christian
[1:56:45] Science the mind accepts the life which
[1:56:49] is the word of God and there brings the
[1:56:52] life just your thought doesn't do it
[1:56:56] but the word of God brought in the
[1:57:00] channel of your thought
[1:57:01] it's not the thought as Christian
[1:57:03] Science says mind over matter no it's
[1:57:06] your mind that accepts it it grasped it
[1:57:11] so what's your mind control by your
[1:57:13] spirit and your spirit catches the word
[1:57:15] of God and that's the thing that's got
[1:57:19] life in it
[1:57:21] it brings life into you and when life
[1:57:25] comes down that channel into you the
[1:57:29] word of God is manifested if you abide
[1:57:31] in me and my words abide in you ask what
[1:57:34] you will and it shall be done unto you
[1:57:36] he said what it's doing from the middle
[1:57:39] of the heart which is the soul there it
[1:57:41] goes forth feeding every
[1:57:43] Channel
[1:57:45] this is a key Point here
[1:57:48] the trouble of it is
[1:57:50] we're standing in here
[1:57:52] with a lot of doubt
[1:57:55] trying to accept
[1:57:57] what's out there
[1:57:59] you've got to stop that no let's listen
[1:58:04] you've got to stop that and come down
[1:58:06] that Channel with the true word of God
[1:58:08] then it goes out itself
[1:58:12] automatically it's what's on the inside
[1:58:15] the thing that counts is the inside
[1:58:18] and he says that's also Satan's approach
[1:58:20] he said now you can say I don't steal I
[1:58:22] don't drink I don't do these things that
[1:58:24] has nothing to do with it no matter how
[1:58:27] good you are how moral you are how
[1:58:28] truthful you are those things are
[1:58:29] respected but Jesus said except the man
[1:58:32] be born again there's got to be
[1:58:34] something happen inside
[1:58:38] right thy sins be forgiven thee in The
[1:58:42] Invisible
[1:58:43] nobody else can see it that man knew it
[1:58:47] I'm saying that man knew it
[1:58:51] brother you it's a reality that strikes
[1:58:54] your life when you know my sins have
[1:58:57] been forgiven
[1:59:00] when you begin to say once it stretch
[1:59:02] your life you can say my sins have been
[1:59:05] forgiven what are you doing you are
[1:59:07] saying the same thing he has said
[1:59:10] [Music]
[1:59:13] Hallelujah don't wrestle with the word
[1:59:17] accept it
[1:59:19] there's got to be something happen
[1:59:21] inside if you don't that's an artificial
[1:59:24] put on for down in your heart you desire
[1:59:26] to do it anyhow it can't be artificial
[1:59:29] it's got to be
[1:59:31] real
[1:59:32] he said there's only one Avenue that can
[1:59:34] come down and that's by the way a free
[1:59:36] moral agency come into your soul by your
[1:59:39] thoughts
[1:59:41] as a man thinketh in his heart so is he
[1:59:44] if you say this mountain move and don't
[1:59:46] die in your heart but believe what you
[1:59:47] said will come to pass you can have it
[1:59:49] there's the Battlegrounds if you can
[1:59:52] only get started first
[1:59:56] Brian says I've been misunderstood about
[1:59:58] having about talking about Alder calls
[2:00:00] and when I said I wasn't much on one he
[2:00:03] said
[2:00:03] I never said I never said I was against
[2:00:05] him
[2:00:06] right right
[2:00:08] this they're drawing this out of
[2:00:10] Christianity versus idolatry brother
[2:00:12] Brown preachers the previous year
[2:00:14] you see it's me you can't you can't help
[2:00:16] that people misunderstood what he's
[2:00:17] trying to tell him this is that we're
[2:00:19] not working on people's emotions
[2:00:22] are you with me we're not working on
[2:00:24] their emotions we're not working on
[2:00:26] things to get them into a place no no no
[2:00:28] no no no the word the word comes to have
[2:00:32] Mastery Upon Our Lives
[2:00:35] is to encourage Us in the word of God
[2:00:39] the word is what's to bring conviction
[2:00:42] the word is what's to bring Liberty not
[2:00:44] working on a memory of you know your
[2:00:46] grandmother really loved the Lord your
[2:00:48] grandmother where they serve God or your
[2:00:49] dad I didn't really believe this message
[2:00:50] brother so and so ready no it ain't
[2:00:52] about that
[2:00:53] said that's the wrong Avenue it'll never
[2:00:56] work
[2:01:00] you're present what are you saying I'm
[2:01:02] saying it's about you and God
[2:01:06] it's about you and God
[2:01:09] it's about me and God
[2:01:12] hallelujah oh he said it's gonna come
[2:01:15] down that line of free moral agency
[2:01:18] you don't come he said because you're a
[2:01:20] good neighbor because you're a good
[2:01:21] woman you come because God calls you to
[2:01:22] come and you accept him on the basis of
[2:01:26] his word that word is what what means
[2:01:29] everything that word and if you can get
[2:01:32] everything out of the way
[2:01:34] if you can get everything out of the way
[2:01:36] believe us now this yay Lord I believe
[2:01:38] the Thou Art the son of the Living God
[2:01:40] that was to come in the world if you do
[2:01:41] take away the stone

[2:02:10] glory be to God he said you see if we
[2:02:13] can get all the consciences and and
[2:02:16] senses and just let the word come in
[2:02:18] that word will produce just exactly
[2:02:22] but he said here we have it he said if
[2:02:24] you he said but if you receive it
[2:02:27] and you cover it over
[2:02:29] and you say well brother Branham these
[2:02:32] conscience and senses for and so forth
[2:02:34] they don't have nothing to do with the
[2:02:36] brother Branham
[2:02:39] he said certainly it does
[2:02:43] but if you'll let the word come in and
[2:02:45] cover it over with conscience
[2:02:47] it can't grow
[2:02:49] it'll be a deformed word
[2:02:51] it'd be like a plant he described a corn
[2:02:53] and you put like a rock or something my
[2:02:55] it'll grow out like this
[2:02:57] it's still growing
[2:02:59] but it's growing crooked

[2:03:18] been taught the Holy Spirit that's been
[2:03:20] living in us we've got too many things
[2:03:22] looking at somebody else let me just say
[2:03:24] this he's right here Among Us
[2:03:27] the desires
[2:03:29] that we have in him
[2:03:31] we need to look on him
[2:03:34] and we need to believe what the word
[2:03:36] says we are
[2:03:39] you understand me we need to believe
[2:03:40] what the word says we are
[2:03:43] who cares what so-and-so thinks
[2:03:47] they're not the king
[2:03:49] you don't know my mama your mama ain't
[2:03:51] the king
[2:03:53] the king
[2:03:56] but go not out of the presence of the
[2:03:59] king
[2:04:00] abide under his word
[2:04:04] because the Devil he's always going to
[2:04:06] try to point you to somebody's failure
[2:04:09] right
[2:04:11] oh I know somebody was like this and
[2:04:13] this is what happened and I know
[2:04:14] somebody you know what
[2:04:17] we ought to say God forgive us for
[2:04:19] talking about all the negative
[2:04:24] friends
[2:04:27] wrote look there's dead deer down this
[2:04:30] ditch line right here I don't talk about
[2:04:32] them dead deer
[2:04:35] there's times when I leave out of the
[2:04:36] office here you know what I talk about I
[2:04:38] talk about the leaves
[2:04:40] I'm not talking about me I ain't Lifting
[2:04:42] me up but I'm talking about in the
[2:04:43] spiritual
[2:04:46] you can't be looking at everybody else
[2:04:49] right you say what's going to happen
[2:04:51] whatever you look at you'll start
[2:04:53] walking towards it
[2:04:54] [Applause]
[2:04:55] come on Friends
[2:04:57] the church started looking at those that
[2:04:59] was going astray brother so and so since
[2:05:01] you're so and so this and this and that
[2:05:03] get your eyes off of people
[2:05:06] get your ass on Jesus Christ
[2:05:09] [Music]
[2:05:10] if there's going to be one by somebody
[2:05:12] make it I'm gonna be that one
[2:05:15] [Music]
[2:05:16] and I can't help nobody if I get my eyes
[2:05:20] off him I can't help nobody
[2:05:24] but if I keep my eyes on him
[2:05:28] those that are ordained
[2:05:30] will move right in line with the word of
[2:05:33] God
[2:05:34] [Applause]
[2:05:45] but if it comes from the true source of
[2:05:47] the word of God see when it comes from
[2:05:49] the true source of the word of God
[2:05:50] heavens and earth will pass away with my
[2:05:52] word
[2:05:53] and pass away
[2:05:56] let me tie this up here
[2:06:01] he said it must be accepted in the mind
[2:06:05] then it's believed with the heart
[2:06:07] then the word of God becomes a reality
[2:06:11] then every sense of soul and body is
[2:06:13] just scoured out
[2:06:15] with the Holy Spirit
[2:06:17] then your sense of God
[2:06:19] your conscience of God everything that's
[2:06:22] gobbling flows through you see what's
[2:06:23] happening you have the Mastery of the
[2:06:27] word
[2:06:28] working in your life
[2:06:30] what's it doing
[2:06:32] well
[2:06:33] the greatest thing even as it starts
[2:06:35] working to bring conviction to our heart
[2:06:38] what it brought conviction and Drew us
[2:06:40] to him
[2:06:41] you know what it's doing it's mastering
[2:06:43] Our Lives
[2:06:45] cleans us up it's mastering Our Lives
[2:06:48] right right
[2:06:48] then he moves in by the new birth
[2:06:52] there's a death and there's a
[2:06:54] resurrection but is it mastery
[2:06:57] Mastery the word is mastering
[2:07:00] circumstances
[2:07:03] then as that word is in our life oh I
[2:07:05] love this it's mastering and molding our
[2:07:10] character to match his character
[2:07:13] he's mastering
[2:07:15] they're being changed from Glory unto
[2:07:18] Glory
[2:07:20] we're not Observers
[2:07:22] we are participants
[2:07:24] to receive that word into our lives
[2:07:29] receiving it
[2:07:31] when it comes to Healing receiving that
[2:07:34] word down into our lives
[2:07:36] but you're doing mastering the
[2:07:38] circumstances
[2:07:40] you have to understand
[2:07:41] circumstances can Master you but it is
[2:07:45] the word in you that we must let have
[2:07:47] the right of way to master us
[2:07:50] and the circumstances
[2:07:52] because when the word listen to me now
[2:07:54] when the word
[2:08:00] then the circumstance is conquered
[2:08:04] I need examples of that I've read you
[2:08:06] some but if you want me to give you the
[2:08:09] examples of situations when brother
[2:08:10] Branham was standing there on the
[2:08:12] platform and the maniac of uh that that
[2:08:14] that that that that that insane man came
[2:08:16] up on the platform what was it brother

[2:08:23] be a boxer
[2:08:25] come on now sometimes we sometimes we're
[2:08:27] trying to handle problems in our life
[2:08:28] using the same techniques we've always
[2:08:30] done
[2:08:35] come on Friends the Holy Ghost did not
[2:08:37] put you in a glorified body that's right
[2:08:39] we're still trying to handle but I'll
[2:08:41] tell you what I'll get I'll get it
[2:08:45] brother Brandon said
[2:08:49] I got the thinking he said
[2:08:51] this man said got a family at home even
[2:08:53] begin to think he said I changed my
[2:08:55] thoughts oh God
[2:09:02] made a decision to change his thoughts
[2:09:08] what kind of thoughts did he think about
[2:09:11] oh this guy this guy wasn't such a
[2:09:13] blessed God In The Name of Jesus if he
[2:09:16] went no no no no
[2:09:17] he began to enter in
[2:09:19] why is he acting the way he's acting why
[2:09:22] is he responding the way he's responding
[2:09:23] you'll never get anywhere with anybody
[2:09:25] until you enter into their shoes
[2:09:30] never in relationships and anyway you
[2:09:33] have to be able to enter in
[2:09:36] who that's good this is free tonight
[2:09:39] you have to be willing to enter in yeah
[2:09:41] think about it when you know the story
[2:09:43] you know what happened there on the
[2:09:45] platform think about when he was there
[2:09:46] with with the bull right who was it that
[2:09:51] was mastered
[2:09:52] brother Brown
[2:09:54] when he came under the Mastery of the
[2:09:57] word then the circumstances around him
[2:10:00] he could say I take it I take every
[2:10:03] Spirit under my control for the glory of
[2:10:05] God
[2:10:06] let me tell you something that just was
[2:10:09] not
[2:10:10] for and confined to 1965. that was God
[2:10:15] demonstrating through an adopted matured
[2:10:19] Son of God
[2:10:21] are you hearing me one minute come up
[2:10:23] from the field to let you and I see this
[2:10:26] same life this message produces Sons and
[2:10:31] Daughters of God that have dominion over
[2:10:34] sin flesh the devil and the world
[2:10:40] Hallelujah
[2:10:42] it's held up for you and I that's why
[2:10:44] this message is preached and held up
[2:10:46] because it's Jesus Christ
[2:10:49] it's what gives you confidence to face
[2:10:52] the circumstances that surrounds your
[2:10:54] life
[2:10:57] in your home on your job with your
[2:11:00] family on and on
[2:11:02] there's nothing as powerful
[2:11:04] as the word of God
[2:11:08] I say oh God let the word Master my
[2:11:12] emotions
[2:11:13] let him Master my thoughts
[2:11:16] I'm tired of doing things my own way and
[2:11:19] you know what getting the same old
[2:11:20] results
[2:11:22] you know what the definition of insanity
[2:11:24] is right doing the same old thing and
[2:11:28] expecting different results
[2:11:31] that's not mine
[2:11:34] that's Dr W himself
[2:11:36] that's insanity
[2:11:38] you can't keep doing the same thing and
[2:11:41] expect different results can I bring it
[2:11:43] down you can't just keep saying well I'm
[2:11:46] just going to come to church you've got

[2:11:55] it into your life
[2:11:59] sometimes I I I'm under a concern of
[2:12:03] when I look at things

[2:12:08] there should be a continual moving up
[2:12:10] closer to the Lord Jesus
[2:12:12] not a oh yeah wait I was born again now
[2:12:16] let me see um I was born again so and so

[2:13:07] you no more holy no more self-righteous
[2:13:09] take God at his word
[2:13:12] hallelujah oh my
[2:13:15] God you see how powerful sometimes our
[2:13:17] thoughts even when we've been set free
[2:13:19] by the grace of God we have to be
[2:13:22] liberated from our Traditions many times
[2:13:24] we still pack traditions
[2:13:28] oh but glory be to God there is a word
[2:13:32] to master
[2:13:35] thank you
[2:13:37] [Applause]
[2:13:41] Hallelujah
[2:13:45] it's your mind brother Brown says you're
[2:13:47] mine I am closing I said that I said ask
[2:13:49] you give me a few minutes and here it's
[2:13:50] been
[2:13:52] you could say I'm used to it thank you
[2:13:57] and close my Bible and I know you say it
[2:13:59] means nothing
[2:14:06] selections
[2:14:09] sometimes I think what we're doing is
[2:14:11] and I I'm not saying this to scold
[2:14:13] anybody you understand me
[2:14:16] I've asked God to just
[2:14:18] really help me with these things I've
[2:14:19] been really
[2:14:20] he's been putting them on pressing on my
[2:14:22] heart for weeks
[2:14:24] sometimes remember remember we were
[2:14:26] looking at some weeks ago Satan's desire
[2:14:28] is to corrupt us
[2:14:30] from the simplicity
[2:14:33] of the Gospel
[2:14:36] he wants to make it complicated you know
[2:14:39] how he does that wanting to point out
[2:14:41] failures point out this point out why
[2:14:43] we're not worthy let me tell you
[2:14:44] something your acceptance of the word of
[2:14:47] God has nothing to do with your
[2:14:49] worthiness
[2:14:51] are you hearing me
[2:14:52] or if I can just make myself when I make
[2:14:55] myself worthy your leopard spots will
[2:14:57] stick out bigger
[2:15:00] because you can't make yourself worthy
[2:15:02] are you under hearing me it ain't you
[2:15:05] that can do it well I got to get worthy
[2:15:07] before I can come to church it ain't
[2:15:08] getting worthy before I come to church
[2:15:10] it's the word of God that sets you free
[2:15:13] if you can receive the word it'll loosen
[2:15:16] it'll Master every circumstance he'll
[2:15:20] overthrow every Hound of hell

[2:15:27] Hallelujah if the Serpent's been after
[2:15:29] you get back in the word
[2:15:32] because this word is authority to bind
[2:15:36] Satan
[2:15:38] he's Bound in the name of Jesus Christ

[2:15:45] it's liberty for you
[2:15:48] fear to master your doubt master your
[2:15:51] confusion master your unbelief
[2:15:54] I lose

[2:16:13] tell you what you're doing you're acting
[2:16:15] like your father
[2:16:17] because when Satan rose up in heaven
[2:16:19] Jesus never asked him would you leave he
[2:16:22] cast him out
[2:16:25] amen
[2:16:27] that's why Paul said cast down every
[2:16:30] imagination
[2:16:33] steam out
[2:16:36] let the word of God just come and
[2:16:38] penetrate
[2:16:40] let the word just move right down let me
[2:16:42] tell you this word has power

[2:27:46] that's what makes the meeting Lord
[2:27:51] that's what Lord builds

[2:28:10] the Wonders our heads our hearts are
[2:28:12] bowed in his presence
[2:28:15] I know we don't want to be observers I
[2:28:17] don't want to be Observer I know you
[2:28:19] don't
[2:28:21] but I'll say this
[2:28:23] if you know your life is not where it
[2:28:25] needs to be
[2:28:27] there's one way quickly to loosen that
[2:28:31] that's to repent
[2:28:35] that's to get things right back on track
[2:28:37] with God
[2:28:39] is so brother Samuel repentance is a
[2:28:41] very simple thing it is
[2:28:44] but it's
[2:28:46] it's
[2:28:47] what God leads us to
[2:28:50] the goodness of God leads us to
[2:28:53] repentance
[2:28:55] to recognize who's here in our midst
[2:28:58] even isn't as even as it was spoken he's
[2:29:00] been saying that throughout the service
[2:29:02] it's him and it's not just man that's
[2:29:04] saying it
[2:29:06] you know
[2:29:09] there's one here that's more than a man
[2:29:11] that knows your situation
[2:29:14] there's one who's called out even the
[2:29:17] thoughts of your heart
[2:29:19] because the word
[2:29:20] is right here with us
[2:29:23] it's a discerner of the thoughts and
[2:29:25] intents of the heart more powerful
[2:29:27] sharper than any two-edged sword it's
[2:29:30] alive
[2:29:32] why don't you let him cut from you all
[2:29:34] that unbelief
[2:29:36] why don't you let him cut from you all
[2:29:39] the doubt
[2:29:40] why don't you just welcome him in why
[2:29:42] don't you just let go and let God do it
[2:29:45] and let's just lay down every bit of
[2:29:47] Pride how long I've known the message or
[2:29:49] I've known this and I know no no where
[2:29:51] is your life
[2:29:53] where is your life with God
[2:29:57] because it takes your life the whole
[2:30:01] purpose of this message
[2:30:03] is that your life
[2:30:05] would be transformed by the quickening
[2:30:07] power
[2:30:08] to match the word of God
[2:30:12] and I say what Grace has come to us
[2:30:15] and what a day this is
[2:30:17] what a day this is what a light this is
[2:30:21] never been a light that shines so bright
[2:30:23] as this light
[2:30:26] and right now
[2:30:29] you've been encouraged
[2:30:31] take away the stone
[2:30:33] I encourage you take away the stone
[2:30:37] roll it away
[2:30:40] thoughts ways rolling away
[2:30:44] let the Holy Spirit
[2:30:46] let him just move and strengthen you
[2:30:49] that
[2:30:49] even here in this moment
[2:30:52] that you can walk from not just this
[2:30:55] place but walk from where you're at
[2:30:58] and you'll never be the same
[2:31:01] many things there could be things heard
[2:31:04] it's not just this isn't just a message
[2:31:06] of the new birth
[2:31:09] there is lives that need the new birth
[2:31:10] that's true but there's also lives
[2:31:14] that need healing
[2:31:16] need Deliverance hearts that need to be
[2:31:19] touched it
[2:31:21] still carrying hurt
[2:31:23] wounds
[2:31:25] complexes all those are stones
[2:31:30] but will you take away the stone
[2:31:33] will you remove it
[2:31:34] let the word go to work in mastery
[2:31:37] let it master that circumstance in your
[2:31:40] life
[2:31:41] I say right here this morning this altar
[2:31:43] is open
[2:31:46] I know God God met you there he can meet
[2:31:48] you right there in your seat too but I
[2:31:50] want you to be obedient to the Lord
[2:31:51] because we just don't want to recognize
[2:31:53] him
[2:31:54] we need to receive him
[2:31:56] we need to receive him
[2:31:58] to in many as received him
[2:32:02] to them gave he the power
[2:32:05] to become the sons of God
[2:32:10] we want to receive it
[2:32:12] Samuel what should I do I would lay
[2:32:15] aside my doubts lay aside all and
[2:32:17] believe cast every thought down all the
[2:32:20] failure every mistake cast it down
[2:32:23] because it's of no value
[2:32:27] but take the word of God
[2:32:29] that is of Eternal value
[2:32:31] and let the word lift you let it exalt
[2:32:36] your life
[2:32:38] above sin above doubt let it come let it
[2:32:42] move
